ADDRESS.
The present number commences our Fourth Volume, and we take the 
opportunity of addressing a few remarks to our readers and contributors.
To the former we tender our thanks for their continued support, and 
trust that it will not only be continued for the future, but that they 
will assist us in obtaining new subscribers to the forthcoming volumes, 
and make an effort to carry out to a successful issue the claims of the 
" Journal," as indicated in the circular recently issued to the members 
of the Union.
To our contributors our warmest thanks are due, for 
the valuable papers, notes and queries, sent for publication, and we 
feel convinced that those whose papers have been delayed, abstracted, 
or declined, will not attribute to us any want of courtesy to themselves 
in pursuing the course we have done.
Some little discretion must be 
allowed to us in our editorial capacity, and we can assure all our 
friends that it is with the greatest reluctance that we find ourselves 
compelled at times not to insert their communications, or to abridge 
them.
One part of our Journal we are anxious to see developed to a 
much greater extent than has hitherto been the case, viz., that devoted 
to short notes and queries.
These columns are intended to stimulate 
observers to keep a keen eye upon all new discoveries, doubtful points, 
and questions on all branches of natural history which may require 
elucidation, and to give an opportunity for the discussion amongst 
our members of any questions which may arise on the distribution, 
histology, physiology, systematic classification, Szc, in any of the 
sciences which come within our scope.
We are glad to find that con- 
siderable progress has been made in this direction in our last volume, 
and hope to see this department more fully developed in each succeeding 
one.
Let none be dismayed at asking questions for fear of showing 
their ignorance, aiid we will promise that so far as possible their doubts, 
questions, or difficulties, will be attended to ; and if we ourselves are 
incapable of answering them (which may possibly often be the case, 
as we make no professions of encyclopeedic knowledge), some of our 
contributors will be able and willing to do so, — indeed, in most cases 
we shall make it a point to give them the preference.
It is gratifying 
to be able to state that the useful papers on neglected orders " are

already bearing fruit, and some of our members are already beginning 
to work them up with considerable success, and we sincerely trust 
that their example will speedily be followed.
The harvest is ample 
enough, it only requires reapers.
As to meetings of Societies, we must ask our friends the secretaries 
to make their reports as short as possible consistent with their interest, 
and to report those portions only which may be of general interest, 
leaving out all extraneous matters ; this will save both them and our- 
selves much labour and not a little disappointment.
If they consider 
that at present the space at our disposal is only limited, they will 
readily see the reason for this friendly hint.
In conclusion, to all we would say, that as our labours are done con 
amove, give us your best assistance, and we will spare no pains or 
labour to render your work available and useful, and whenever we find 
it advisable, or possible, wiU increase the size of the Journal.
Our 
success depends entirely upon our subscribers and contributors ; let 
them only use their best endeavours to give and get us a fair measure 
of support, and we will guarantee that their labours shall not be 
without fruit.
ON MOSSES (Continued.) 
By Wm. West.
Forms of thickening are found in the spiral bands of the elaters 
of hepatic* and in the theca of mosses.
In Marchantiacea an epidermis 
is found, as well as on the thecse of mosses having stomatal perforations, 
and in the leaf, veins, and stems of the highest mosses, elongated cells 
are found approaching slightly to a fibro-vascular system.
On the 
foregoing characters is based the primary classification of the Muscinea.
I will now give you the distinguishing characteristics between the 
two groups of the Miiscine^, contrasting them as much as possible, 
in doing which I shall of necessity repeat something I have already 
said, but that will not matter if I can succeed in thoroughly showing-

to you the separation of the two groups.
Mosses develop the sexual 
generation from the spore with the interventiou of a pro-embrvo.
The 
hepatica^ develop the; sexual generation directly from the spore, or 
with the intervention of a small pro-embryo.
The sexual generation 
of mosses usually has a filiform stem, with leaves in two or more rows, 
having no bilateral structure, usually monopodial, never dichotomous.
The sexual generation in hepaticce is developed as a flat dichotomous 
stem or thallus, or finally as a filiform stalk furnished with two or 
four rows of leaves, and usually having one side applied to an object, 
and when the stem grows erect there is an apparent tendency to form 
an under as well as an upper surface.
The asexual generation of 
mosses is formed in the calyptra, which is ruptured at the vaginula, 
and raised by the sporogonium, enveloping the latter as a cup, and 
the young capsule produces the spores from an inner layer of tissue, 
the remaining inner tissue is sterile and produces the columella, 
the wall of the capsule has an epidermis, and it usually divides into an 
urn-shaped body and a lid.
The asexual generation of the hepatica> 
remains surrounded by the calyptra until the ripening of the spores?
the calyptra is then ruptured at the apex, and remains at the base of 
the sporogonium as a sheath, the spore capsule projects above this 
sheath and the spores are dispersed ; the mother-cells of the spores 
arise either from the whole mass of cells composing the capsule, except 
the outer layer, or the immediate cells usually develope into elaters.
I shall now confine my remarks to mosses alone.
The spore 
produces a protonema from which the moss, bearing leaves and the 
sexual organs, arises.
The endospore sends out a tube which elongates 
by apical growth indefinitely, and becomes septate.
These form 
branches close behind the septa, which may produce branches of a 
higher grade.
The part of the endospore opposite the germinating 
filament may develop into a hyaline rhizoid, which penetrates the 
ground.
The cell-walls of the protonema are at first colourless, but 
the primary axis, whether laying upon the surface of the ground or 
penetrating it, soon assumes a brown colour, the right-angled septa of 
which become oblique.
The cells above ground develop chlorophyll 
grains abundantly, and the protonema is thus nourished in an inde- 
pendent manner by assimilation.
It dies at once in most cases after 
producing lateral buds ; but in Pottia, Phjscomitrbim^ PJiascmn, &c., 
it retains its vigour after the development of the sporogonium, and 
here we have the three stages of the cycle of development presented 
to us simultaneously in genetic connection.
In Spliagimm the spores 
produce a flat plate of tissue, the margin of which branches, producing 
4 
The Natukaltst.
ieafy stems from the surface.
Tetradontium and Tttrapfds also produce 
a flat pro-embryo at the end of the filaments of a protonema.
Kiihn's 
investigations on Andreoea show that it also differs from the typical 
mosses, as the contents of the spore divide into four or more cells 
before bursting.
This observer has also shown that the first septum 
of the protonema is formed within the spore in the true mosses, as 
Mnium, Lemobryim^ Hypmm, and Bartramia.
The branches of the 
protonema of Andreoea may produce cellular ribbons as well as trans- 
verse and longitudinal divisions, and parallel to the surface of these 
divisions other divisions may be formed, and an aborescent erect 
portion of the protonema may result, but sometimes a single plate of 
tissue having a definite .outline is the result.
The length of the 
protonema varies from 1 m.m. to 300 m.m. The length of a moss 
varies from 1 m.m. to over 300 m.m., but the thickness does not vary 
more than from m.m. to 1 m.m. The leaf-bearing plant springs 
from the lower cells of the lateral branches of the protonema, and 
never from the apical cell of a filament of the latter.
From the first 
leaf-forming segments arise the first rhizoids.
I might here have 
gone into the manner in which the branching of the stem originates, 
but I must be content with saying that the branching is never dicho- 
tomous, and probably never axillary, although connected with the 
leaves.
The leaf-tissue of Sphagnum and Leucobryum is differentiated 
into cells of definite position, some containing sap, and some air.
The stolons of mosses are shoots with none or very small leaves ; 
they creep on or beneath the surface of the soil and then erect them- 
selves as leafy shoots.
The lamina expands right and left from the 
median plane, except in Fissidens, and here it is expanded in the 
median plane itself, proceeding from an almost sheathing base.
The 
rhizoids or root-hairs are plentifully developed except in Sphagnum, 
and are not morphologically distinct from the protonema ; they 
certainly do not contain chlorophyll, and they likewise tend to grow 
downwards, but they sometimes develop single branches as a proto- 
nema growing upwards, and the protonema also develops rhizoids.
To cause the protonema to be developed from the rhizoids, keep a 
turf of moss turned upside down and damp for a few days, when 
protonema will be developed, bearing plants in abundance.
Wo h ave seen that the usual method of reproduction is by means of 
the spores of the sporogonium, which sporogonium was proved to be 
equivalent to the entire leafy and rooting spore-producing plant of vas- 
vascular cryptogams, in 1851, by Hoflmeister, and is one of the finest 
revelations ever made in morphology and classification.
The protonema 
West : Ox Mosses.
5 
produced by the spores usually has a short life, in others its duration 
seems to be unlimited, as the apices go on growing and the oldest 
parts die, each branch becoming thus a separate bearer of plants.
Mosses also multiply by detached buds, stolons, gemmae, and by the 
rhizoids becoming protonema.
Some species, like Funaria and 
Phascum, persist perennially by means of their rhizoids.
Pulytrichum 
aloides and nanum produce gemmae from their rhizoids.
Minute 
tuberous buds, having reserve food material, are developed on the 
root-hairs of Barbida muralh, Funaria hygrometria, and others, but 
these rhizoids have been observed by Schimper to produce leaf-buds 
without having recourse to a protonema, and in this way the male 
annual plants of Dicramm undulatiim arise from the perennial clods of 
the female plants, and fertilize the latter.
The leaves of several 
species of Ortliotrichum produce protonema, which are club-shaped in 
O. phyllanthum ; the same phenomenon occurs in some other mosses.
In Buxbaumia — especially in B.
aphylla — the marginal cells of the 
leaves produce a protonema which envelops both them and the stem 
with its filaments.
Oncuphorus gtaucKt forms an interlaced mass of 
protonema on the summits of the plants when the reproductive organs 
are produced, and stop the further growth of the old plants.
Bryum 
an)iotinum produces branch buds which fall off and reproduce the plant, 
and even the branches of some mosses detach themselves and set up 
an independent existence.
Then there are the gemmae produced by 
Tetraphis and Aidacomnion androgynum, borne on a leafless elongation 
of the stem, and in Tetraphis elegantly surrounded by a cup of leaves.
A detached leaf of Funaria has been known to produce a protonema 
when kept moist.
Articulated filaments, called paraphyses, surround the archegonia 
in the female flowers; in the male flowers they surround the anther- 
idia, and are sometimes spathulate, consisting in the upper part of 
several rows of cells.
The mature antheridia are stalked sacs, with a 
wall consisting of a single layer of cells containing chlorophyll, 
which assumes a red or yellow colour when ripe.
In most mosses 
they are club-shaped, but in Buxbaumia and Sphagnum almost round.
In Sphagnace(2 they open as in the hepaticae, and in all others by a slit 
across the apex, through which the antherozoids are discharged in a 
thick mucilaginous jelly, still enclosed in their mother cells ; the 
mucilage dissolves in water and the antherozoids escape and swim 
about.
The mature archegonium consists of a large moderately long 
base, supporting a roundish ovoid ventral part, which supports a long 
thick neck often twisted on its axis.
The wall of the ventral portion

The Naturalist.
consists of a double layer of cells before fertilization, and the neck 
consists of a single layer of cells of from four to six rows.
They 
enclose together an axial row of cells, the lowest of which produces 
the oosphere from its protoplasm by rujuvenescence (that is — the form- 
ation of a cell from the whole of a protoplasm of an already existing cell) 
while the rest of the axial cells become mucilaginous prior to the 
fertilization of the oosphere, this mucilage bursts the four apical cells 
and allows the antherozoids access to the oosphere.
From the fertilized 
oosphere is produced the sporogonium, which in Sphagnum develops 
almost perfectly within the growing ventral portion of the archego- 
nium, which is transformed into the calyptra.
Tn all other mosses 
the calyptra is torn away at its base by the elongation of the sporo- 
gonium, usually long before the spore capsule is developed, and is 
raised up as a cap, except in ArcJiidium and its allies.
The wall of 
the capsule consists of several layers of cells having a distinct 
epidermis, sometimes with stomata.
In the development of the sporo- 
gonium the oosphere is clothed with a cell wall, and divides by a 
slightly inclined wall ; division continues both vertically and trans- 
versely, and a multicellular body results.
The mother-cells of the 
spores become isolated, and divide into four in all parts of the capsule 
at once.
The length of time required for the perfect develoj)ment of 
the fmit varies from three to twelve months.
Mosses are divided naturally into four families : Sphagnacea^ 
having one genus ; Andreceacece, having a few genera ; Phasmcece, 
having a few genera ; and Bi^yacecB (the true moss), all the remaining 
genera.
The spores of the Sphagnacece in water produce a branched protonema, 
but on a solid substratum a flat pro-embryo, while the abundant 
protonema of the BryacecB is wanting, and they only produce rhizoids 
when young.
The antheridia stand by the side of the leaves, and are 
never terminal, and have a roundish form and a long pedicel.
The 
archegonia are at the blunt end of the female branch, and are like 
those of the mosses.
The summit of the branch begins to develop 
after the formation of the sporogonium, and elevates the latter 
enclosed in the calyptra ; this stalk is called a pseudopodium, and of 
course is quite different from a seta.
The calyptra is ruptured 
irregularly, and the theca opens by detaching the upper part as 
a lid.
The Audreceaceoe are small, very leafy and much branched mosses, 
gr-jwing in a caespitose manner ; their long apiculate theca is sup- 
West : Ox ^Mosses.
7 
ported on a short leafless pseudopodium.
The calyptra is raised by 
the theca as a pointed cap, the short seta remains buried in the 
vaginula.
The theca opens by four longitudinal slits, which are 
closed in damp and open in dry weather.
The PhascacecB are small mosses, their protonema lives until their 
spores ripen.
The theca only opens by the decay of its wall.
The 
internal differentiation of the theca in Ephouerum and Phascum 
corresponds to that of the BryacecB^ but in Archidinm an intercellular 
space is formed in the theca, running parallel to its lateral surface, 
separating the waJl from the inner mass of tissue, as in the true 
mosses ; but in these latter a layer of cells parallel to this inter- 
cellular space produces the spore-mother-cells, while in Archidinm it 
is only a single cell laying in the inner tissue that becomes the 
primary mother-cell of all the spores.
This cell swells and supplants 
the other cells, until it lies free in the hollow of the theca ; it then 
divides into four cells, these each dividing into four spores.
In the Bryaceoe the sporogonium is always stalked, and the seta is 
generally long and cylindrical.
The theca always opens by a lid or 
operculum, which is either simply and smoothly detached from the 
lower part of the theca, or an annulus composed of a layer of 
epidermal cells is thrown off by the swelling of the inner walls, and 
thus the operculum is separated.
Around the margin of the theca is 
a peristome, except where gymnostomous.
The theca is at first a 
solid homogeneous mass of tissue, then an intercellular space is 
formed by means of several layers of cells separating from the wall, 
but the wall remains attached to the top and bottom of the columella.
Rows of cells containing chlorophyll stretch from the wall to the 
inner tissue, while the outer layer of the wall is developed into a 
cuticularised epidermis.
The third or fourth layer of cells of the 
inner mass of tissue, which is separated from the annular air-cavity 
by two or three layers of cells forming the spore-sac, produces the 
mother-cells of the spores.
The formation of the j^eristome must now be considered.
In those 
mosses not forming a peristome, the parenchyma of the inner face of 
the operculum is homogeneous and thin-walled, and dries up at the 
bottom of the lid of the ripe theca, and the operculum is essentially 
formed of the epidermis, or it is attached to the columella, and forms 
a thickening at its summit, projecting over the mouth of the theca, 
or else it forms a diaphragm over the mouth, as in nymenodomum^

REVIEWS.
" WEST YORKSHIRE." * Parts I.
& II.
We hail" with pleasure the tardy appearance of this long promised 
volume, and though not yet complete it is a welcome instalment.
The 
first 228 pages are devoted to the Geology of the District, by the pen 
of Mr. Davis, illustrated by a number of diagrammatic drawings 
of local sections, five geologically coloured plates of more general 
sections across the country in various directions, and a map (4 inches 
to the mile) exhibiting the area of the different formations and their 
relative positions.
The remainder of the volume, which is of joint 
authorship, is devoted to .
Physical Geograj^hy, and Botanical Topo- 
graphy, illustrated by a map on the same scale as the geological one, 
coloured to show the divisions of the river drainage ; these drainage 
areas are divided into ten, viz : — the Lune, Ribble, Mersey, Ure, 
Nidd, Wharfe, Aire, Calder, Don, and Trent.
One chapter is devoted 
to each of these areas, which after giving the leading details of the 
physical geography, and remarks on the scenery of the district, contains 
a list of the principal and more remarkable plants and mosses found 
therein, and in many cases with critical remarks upon them.
We 
regret to have to notice one or two inaccuracies in this portion of the 
work, as at p.
349 where the R.
Ribourne is stated to run north-west 
instead of N.E.
: again the "Ivy-leaved Bell-flower" is in some 
instances referred to as Campanula, and in others as WaJdeubergia 
Jiederacea : some varieties are printed as if they were species, e.g. p.
354 
Blindia tricliodes^ instead of B.
acuta var.
/3 tricJwdes ; Cardamine amara 
is certainly not indigenous in Storthes Hall Woods, and surely Ceratodon 
purpureiis is too common a moss to merit special mention.
The geological portion is as complete and exhaustive as the space 
will allow, and is indeed a production worthy of its author, who has 
evidently spared no pains to render the subject as clear and compre- 
hensive as possible.
A most useful and interesting addition to it is, 
the 40 pages devoted to the bibliography on the geology and physical 
geography, commencing with A.D. 1674, arranged iii years, and con- 
taining 491 references.
We can cordially congratulate the authors on 
the production of their first volume, and trust that the second, which 
is to contain complete lists of the flowering plants, ferns, mosses, 
lichens, and fungi, will speedily follow, and that before this year closes 
we shall have that basis to work upon in botanical science which is so 
great a desideratum with us at present.

"N^iTURAL HISTORY OF HASTINGS AND ST.
LEONARDS." 
This little work, wliicli appears to be the joint production of several 
members of the Hastings and St. Leonards Philosophical and Historical 
Society, is confessedly only intended as a first provisional list, and 
includes the whole of the authentic information obtained up to the 
present time.
It comprises lists without localities of the species of 
animals and plants found in the district, and it appears that some of 
what we call " neglected orders," are not neglected by this society, 
as the list includes the Polyzoa, Hymenoptera (170 species), Diptera 
(179), Hemiptera (55) Musci (97), Lichenes (102), Algse (159), and 
Fungi (131).
It is rather a pity that localities are not inserted, as 
this would materally have increased its usefulness, but still as it stands, 
it is a good basis from which any naturalist in the district may make 
his starting point for further observations.
Such works as these are 
always useful, and we earnestly wish that every county in the Kingdom 
would undertake to publish a similar list as a working basis, or where 
they have already got such a one, would supplement it by works like 
Baker's North Yorkshire, or Davis and Lees' ^Vest Yorkshire.

— On the evening of June 26th — a calm, 
quiet evening after a succession of scorching hot days — when returning 
homewards through Temple Hirst, near Selby, I was struck by a remark- 
able appearance.
Every tree as far as the eye could reach was surmounted 
with one or more narrow vertical wavy wreaths of what appeared to be 
black smoke.
Some of the thickest could be seen fully a mile away.
On 
a nearer approach, each of these clouds was seen to be composed of 
myriads of .gnats, and the whole air was filled with a humming noise hke 
that of a swarm of bees.
The gnats were no douht developed in these 
enormous numbers under the influence of the intense heat in the filthy 
black water of the Aire, which runs past Temple Hirst, but what is the 
cause of their partiality for the tree-tops ?
Even the hedges had long 
narrow lines of gnats hovering above them.
As the sun set, the clouds 
of gnats melted away and rapidly disappeared.

Notes on N^ttjkal History.
— The exhibition of Natm-al History has 
so much occupied the time of members, that there is httle out-door 
observation to record.
In a walk by Cawthorne to Denby Dale on the 
15th I only heard the songs of the yeUow bunting, titlark, skylark, 
whitethroat, bluecap, lesser redpole, and green hnnet, and the call-notes 
of the whinchat and grey linnet.
Swallows and martins were numerous 
in their favourite haunts, although in some places they are reported 
to be scarce.
Sand martins, spotted flycatcher and young, were seen 
about the quarries at Monk Bretton, — T, Lister.

The Naturalist.
Arrival of Spring Migrants.— Subjoined is a list of dates of the 
arrival of our spring migrants, as observed principally bj'- myself in this 
district during the present year :— Pied wagtail Feb. 24th, wheatear 
April 6th, willow warbler 14th, ring-ousel 14th,* redstart 17th, sand 
martin (several) 18th,* swallow 18th, tree pipit 19th, yellow wagtail 21st, 
cuckoo 22nd, whitethroat 24th, yellowhammer 27th, blackcap 28th, 
whinchat 28th, house martin May 1st, swift 4th,* spotted flycatcher 5th, 
fieldfares (last seen) 8th, nightjar 12th, garden warbler 19th.* An 
asterisk is placed against the species of which I am doubtful as to 
whether the date may indicate the earliest arrival.
It is evident 
that a record of dates, based upon casual observations of the first 
appearance of the migratory birds, can be of little or no value.
For instance, we very seldom see the swift in this locality before 
the middle of June (its nearest breeding haunts being Bingley), but this 
date affords a very fallacious indication of its arrival.
The same remark 
applies to the ring ouzel : their various breeding haunts should be 
frequently, at least daily visited.
It is also a common mistake to suppose 
that they announce their presence by their song immediately on arriving.
If the weather be cold, and food insufiicient, many species continue for a 
considerable time remarkably reticent — some even withdrawing alto- 
gether, as the house martins in 1877.
Of course this district being some- 
what elevated, they do not, as might be reasonably expected, make their 
appearance so early as in the low-lying districts.
This is especially the 
case with the exclusively insectivorous species.

A Xew West-Eidixg Sedge.
— Carex capillaris, a pretty httle sedge, 
untn now has been known in but twelve British counties.
To these 
Mr. William West has added a thirteenth, by his discovery of it 
in Gordale.
It grows on the mural scar, at an altitude of about 1000 
feet, on the left hand as the gorge is ascended, above the debris at the 
base of the cliff, but a Little below the narrow plain forming the summit.
It would appear to be very local, as I have been at the very spot indicated 
several times and never noticed it.
This addition of Carex capillaris to 
the West-Riding flora is interesting in many ways.
In Upper Teesdale 
it occurs with.
Relianthera)rni canu 111 s.Tidi PotentiUa cdjyestris, Dryas odo- 
jjetalu and Kohresia cariciaa.
We now know all these, except the last 
named, in the Craven district.
Who will be the lucky finder of the 
Kohresia on the Malham, Sedbergh, or Cam Fell moors \ It is very 
likely to occur.
Formerly only the Dryas was known in Craven, next 
the PotentiUa, next the Cistus, and now the Carex, have been discovered, 
leaving only the Kohresia to make the geographical alhance as complete 
in West Yorkshire as in Teesdale.
I am glad to say that INIr. West's 
discovery comes in time for inclusion in the West-Riding flora which 
will form Vol. TI.
of the work on "West Yorkshire," of which the first 
volume has just been issued.

AxoTHER Moss NEW TO YORKSHIRE.
— The West-Riding must take rank 
as possessing the richest moss flora of any tract of equal area in Great 
Britain.
I lia^e just received specimens, from the acute bryologists who 
have made the discovery, of Seligeria tristicha, Brid., from near Litton in 
Arncliffe-dale, near ^\Tiarfedale-head.
This pretty little moss was collected 
by Messrs.
S. Ashton and J.
WTiitehead, off dripping scar-limestone rocks, 
in June last, in the locality specified.
The moss is not only new to York- 
shire but to England as well, the only stations hitherto known for it beiag 
in the Blair Athole district of the Scottish Highlands.
It is a sub- 
montane species, like most of its genus ; and xerophilous — dry-loving, 
i.e. limestone preferring — in its role of dispersion.
Its discovery in our 
area brings up the number of West -Riding mosses to 330, out of the 569 
so far known for all Great Britain.
The last species, previous to this 
Seligeria, added to our moss flora was Polytrichuni stridum, Banks, found 
on Ingleborough slope by Mr. Wm.
West, of Bradford.
As his modesty 
has apparently kept him from sending a notice of his discovery to your 
journal himself, I may as well place the find " on record for him.

Baknsley Naturalists' Society.
— Meeting June 18th.
— The presi- 
dent, Mr. T.
Lister, gave a paper on birds at this season.
The song- 
birds which at the end of last month reached their full perfection of 
melody, continued to enhven our woods and fields in the midst of June.
Chief among these we have enjoyed the song of the prince of our wood- 
land minstrels, the nightingale.
We had the pleasure of hearing him 
in broad day, amongst twenty of our spring and resident songsters.
They 
will now be much engaged in breeding and caring for their young.
If we 
go to the quiet valley streams and sedgy pools, we may see the bright 
kingfisher, the moor-hen and coot, and sometimes catch a glance at their 
young on the margin of the pool or sedgy stream on the hills ; westward by 
Ingbirchworth reservoir, we may see the wild duck and young, the sand- 
piper, the mountain linnet, brambling, siskin, and higher still, the 
screaming curlew, t^'c.

Monthly meeting, 11th June, the president in the chair.
— Rev. E.
A. 
Fuller read an interesting paper on the Gyr-Falcon.
This bird is essen- 
tially a member of an arctic or sub-arctic fauna, its real home being in 
the coldest regions of the far north, as Greenland or Iceland.
In olden 
times it had on several occasions been found in Shetland and the Ork- 
neys, and very rarely in England or Ireland.
The lecturer's attention 
having been recently called to one of the Museum specimens, he had 
been led to discover the confusion surrounding its nomenclature — some 
authors giving but one species, some two, some three, and the latest four.
He then described the history of various discoveries of the bird or birds, 
and noted the four species recently described in Brit.
Mus. Cat., viz : — 
Eierofalco candicans, Greenland and North America ; H.
Islandus, Ice- 
land, N W Europe and Britain ; H.
Holhoelli, Greenland only ; and H,

— Excursion July 13th, to Holme-on- 
Spalding Moor, The party drove by road via Howden.
The country 
between Howden and Holme is a flat tract of barren clay land, presenting 
few features of interest ; but around Holme the clay is covered with a

deep yellow alluvial sand.
Holme Churcli stands on the summit of an 
isolated hill 150 feet high, which is composed of the new red, or Keuper 
marls, capped with a bed of gravel which consists entirely of rolled frag- 
ments of carboniferous sandstone and grit, local rocks being absent.
At 
the base of the hill, on a low ridge stretching away eastwards, is a pit in 
which the gravel, unlike that on the summit of the hill, is largely made 
up of the indin-ated green marls of the Keuper.
It is strongly current- 
bedded, the beds dipping at a high angle to the south.
East of Holme, 
near the Market Weighton canal, are some extensive woods of Scotch fir 
(native ?) growing on a heathy surface of wet alluvial sand.
In these woods 
mosses and lichens grow in a luxuriance rarely attained, as mentioned in 
a note in the Naturalist for June, 1878.
The best finds of the day were 
Hypnum ScJireberi (in fruit), and Cetraria Islandica, usually an arctic and 
alpine lichen, but found by Dr. Lees in Lincolnshire, in situations 
similar to the present {Naturalist, Feb., 1878).
The timber in Holme 
Park is very fine, and the trunks are draped with mosses and lichens in a 
way which we do not see in the West Riding.
The flora of Holme, 
though yielding no veiy great rarities, is rich in species, owing to the 
variety of soil and situation.
Upwards of 220 flowering plants were 
observed during the day, including Sisymbrium Sophia, Salvia Verbenaca, 
lAnaria minor, and Viburnum Lantana (in plantations).
There are in 
the neighbourhood of Holme, some remains of ancient ironworks and of 
a Roman pottery, from which fragments of earthenware, and of old slag, 
were obtained by some of the party.

Coleophora vibricilla and Pteraphorus rhododactylus, found by himself at 
Chattenden, in Kent, in June ; Mr. S.
L. Mosley, a fine mottled 
variety of Satyrus J anira and S.

upper side of the wings were more than usually distinct, both bred from 
Hartlepool.
Mr. Conacher announced that on a more careful examina- 
tion of the shells exhibited at the previous meeting as Limax tenellus, he 
found that some of the specimens given under the above name were really 
Arion fiavus, a still rarer species, and that the locality was Ayrshire, and 
not Forfarshire, as recorded.
Mr. Geo.

ox MOSSES .''—i Concluded.) 
By Wm. West.
TdrapJiis is the link that binds the last to those having a peristome, 
and here the firm epidermis of the upper part of the theca falls off as 
a lid, the whole internal tissue of the latter splitting across into four 
valves, the origin and structure of which are very different from a peris- 
tome ; for, except in Polytrichace<2, neither the teeth nor the cilia consist 
of cellular tissue, but of thickened and hardened parts ol the walls of a 
layer of cells, which is separated by layers of thin-walled cells from 
the epidermis which forms the lid.
These latter layers, as well as the 
delicate parts of the former, disappear, while the thickened parts of 
the wall remain after the lid is cast off.
When the peristome is 
double, the outer row is said to be composed of teeth, the inner of 
cilia.
There is a row of epidermal cells, thickened on the outside ; 
these cells are modified in shape where the annulus is formed, several 
layers of cells come next, and inside these is the layer of cells situated 
over the air-cavity from which the peristome is formed.
Near the 
base of this layer are some thickened cells, which serve to unite the 
edge of the theca with the base of the teeth.
The outer face of the 
layer of cells from which the peristome is formed, is thickened, and 
it forms the teeth ; the cilia are formed from the thickened axiul face 
of the same layer ot cells ; where and when this inner face does not 
thicken, there are no cilia formed.
The most highly developed 
mosses belong to Pohjtrkhim^ whose theca differs in structure from 
the other genera.
The teeth of the peristome are composed of 
bundles of thickened prosenchymatous cells, having the shape of a 
horse-shoe, the branches of two adjoining bundles form together one 
of the teeth.
There is also a layer of cells uniting the points of the 
teeth after the lid is cast off.
The spore-sac in some species (as in 
Polytrichum piliferum) is separated by an air cavity from the columella, 
which is penetrated like the outer air cavity, by conferva-like rows of 
cells.
The seta is swollen at its junction with the theca, in some 
species, forming an apophysis.
Mosses are subject to varieties as well as phasnogamous plants, 
and some varieties of one species sometimes differ from each other 
more than neighbouring species which are admitted as distinct.
Hijpnum cupressiforme is an example.
The peristome is sometimes 
present and sometimes absent in some species, as in Enccqdypta vuU 
garis^ hence the distinction of species is sometimes difficult.
N. S., Vol. iv., Sept., 1878.

The Naturalist.
The habitats of mosses are very varied, for while some species will 
grow either on the ground, on the trunk of a tree, or on a rock, others 
will grow only in certain situations — some preferring fallow fields, 
some only in calcareous soil, some at great elevations, others on dung, 
or within the influence of salt-water spray, on rich moist banks, 
dripping rocks, peaty heaths, in spongy bogs, or on naked clay.
Some mosses are almost cosmopolitan, as Bryum argenteum, Fanaria 
hygrometrica^ Polytrichum commune, Ceratodon purpureus^ and others.
There are very few British mosses which have not been also observed 
on the continent of Europe, while Schimper enumerates 280 con- 
tinental species not found in Britain.
Out of 249 species recorded in 
Hooker's " Flora of New Zealand," 41 are British or European.
A 
few ancient mosses have been found preserved in amber.
Mosses seem to be of very little use.
Sphagnum, when ground, is 
used as a food by man in cold climates, it is also one kind of the rein- 
deer's food.
The Esquimaux use one species as a lamp-wick, and 
peat, which is used as a fuel, is mostly composed of the remains of 
mosses.
In the trackless forests of America they are useful as a 
compass to the traveller, for by their presence on the north side of 
the trunks of trees, he can always tell which way to proceed.
In a 
dried state they are extensively used for packing.
They also afford 
lodgment and food to many insects, and if it were not for them, some 
tracts of land would probably remain barren, as they gather amongst 
their matted branches the fleeting particles of soil, and thus prepare 
the way for a higher order of plants.
Mosses can be easily cultivated in a small conservatory or fern-case.
With regard to collecting and preserving mosses there is no 
difficulty, for if you expose them to the air of an ordinary room they 
will dry, and if soaked in water whenever wanted for examination, 
they can then be examined as well as when freshly collected.
Portions 
are usually pressed flat and mounted on paper for the herbarium ; but 
I have found Dr. Wesley's plan to be the most convenient for 
herbarium purposes, that is — to place each species of moss in a paper 
bag, which is numbered according to the London catalogue at one 
corner, and all the other particulars necessary written on the bag ; the 
bags are kept in a box in such a manner that the corners can be 
turned down to look for any number wanted, which can be found, 
examined, and replaced with facility.
With regard to the minute systematic arrangement of mosses the 
text-book must be consulted (of which the three relating to British 
mosses are on the table) : the characters are obtained from the fruit,

the peristome, the calyptra, the vaginula, and siuiihir parts, as well as 
the position of the fruit j other minor characters serve for specific 
distinction, as the shape, nervation, serration, and insertion of the 
leaves.
I have had to leave unsaid much that I had intended to say, and 
have probably in some instances re-stated things, but my object will 
have been accomplished if I have succeeded in interesting any one in 
this neglected order of plants ; for we are situated in the midst of a 
rich neighbourhood, as 314 out of 570 British species are found in 
the West-Riding.
I forgot to mention before that 1250 species of 
mosses were known in 1870, and 700 species of Hepaticre , I have 
recently enquired of an eminent bryologist as to what is the present 
number on record, but he was unable to inform me.
Here is a large 
and interesting order of plants coraparatively neglected ; let me hope 
that my remarks may lead some of you to undertake the study of the 
humble mosses, for they charm the eye of the artist by their grace 
and loveliness whenever observed : and though observ.ition with 
regard to them is the exception rather than the rule, they help by 
their varied tints the adornment of every landscape from the coast to 
the line of perpetual snow.
FLOWERLESS PLxVNTS, AND THEIR HABITATS.* 
ByR Franklin Parsons, M.D., F.G.S.
The term " flowerles^s plants," though useful is not strictly accurate, 
and must be taken to signify not that organs fulfilling the office of 
ilowers do not exist in the plants so-called, but that these organs., 
when present, are formed on a different pattern from those of 
flowering plants proper.
The flowers of the higher plants, as I may 
remind you, consist essentially of two sets of organs, stamens and 
pistils, sometimes combined in the same flower, sometimes found only 
in separate flowers, or even on different plants.
Together with these 
there are usually certain whorls of modified leaves, the calyx and 
corolla, often conspicuous in form, colour, and odour, in order to 
attract insects.
The stamens bear at the end a knob, or " anther," 
•containing a yellow powder, the " pollen," which is the fertilizing 
agent.
The pistil -contains one ©r more ovules, or rudimentary seeds, 
enclosed in a case, the " ovary," (or in the con'iferas naked), the ovary 
l3eing tipped with a sticky knob, the stigma.
When the pollen falls 
epon the stigma it adheres, and emits fine tubes, which push their

The Naturalist.
way to the ovules and enter them through a minute hole at their 
apex, and thus fertilize them.
From the union of the pollen tubes 
with certain cells in the ovule, the young plant takes its rise.
The 
fertilized ovules develop into seeds, each of which contains an embryo 
or youjig plant ready formed.
When the seed germinates, the young 
plant bursts the seed coats and pushes forth root, stem, and leaves, 
the seed itself decaying.
In the so-called flowerless plants, the parts corresponding to the 
flowers, when present, are minute inconspicuous organs, called anthe- 
ridia and archegonia, quite unlike stamens and pistils ; hence these 
plants are called by botanists Cryptogamia— i.e. plants with concealed 
organs of reproduction.
The antheridia are club-shaped organs made up of cells, each of 
which contains a minute filament, which when liberated by the 
bursting of the cell, swims freely with a wriggling movement ; these 
filaments, which closely resemble what we meet with in the animal 
kingdom, are the fertilizing particles.
The archegonia are clusters 
of cells from which, when fertilised, the young plant or the spores are 
developed.
The process of reproduction is, however, so different in 
different orders of flowerless plants, that no general description can 
be given ; in very many cases we find two or even more methods of 
propagation in the same plant, and in a large number of species the 
true sexual reproduction is very rare, or altogether unknown.
In the 
higher orders of cryptogams the remarkable phenomenon of " alter- 
nation of generations " is met with analagous to what is found in 
^ome animals, as the aphides, described by Mr. Hunter in his paper; 
the life history of the plant presents two stages — a nutritive non- 
sexual stage, and a reproductive sexual stage.
The germs of the 
cryptogams are ^' spores," not " seeds," the difference being that the 
"seed" contains the young plant, the " spore " becomes the young 
plant.
Among the cryptogams we meet with a far greater diversity 
of form and function than among the higher plants, and many of the 
lower forms present phenomena of movement, and processes of 
nutrition, very like those of lowly organised animals.
Indeed the 
two great kingdoms of animals and plants, so widely divergent as 
regards their higher members, approach each other so closely below, 
that it is very difficult to draw the line between them, and there are 
several groups (as the sponges among animals, and the diatoms and 
volvocineae among plants) which form a sort of debateable ground 
the possession of which was disputed by botanists and zoologists for 
years before they were finally ceded to one or the other.

difficulty is met with iu defining the limits of the several orders : a 
lichen, a fungus, and a seaweed look very distinct, but intermediate 
forms are found connecting them so closely that it is difficult to say 
where one order ends and another begins.
The cryptogams are classified into two divisions — the acrogens, 
which have a distinct stem and leaves, and the thallogens, which 
consist of a frond without any distinction between stem and leaves.
Here again we find how hard it is to bind Nature by one rule of 
classification, for some of the liverworts have not only distinct leaves 
bat stipules, while others which resemble them so closely in other 
respects that they cannot be removed from them, have a flat green 
frond without stem or leaves.
On the other hand, the genus 
Delesseria among the red seaweeds has beautifully formed leaves with 
stalks and veins, though consisting only of cellular tissue.
The Acrogens are divided into two groups, according as they 
contain vessels and woody fibre, or are composed wholly of cellular 
tissue.
The vascular Acrogens comprise the ferns and three or four 
smaller orders, apparently of little consequence at the present day, 
but which have played a highly important part in the history of our 
globe, as containing the plants of which the carbonized remains form 
our beds of coal, and as being the road by which, if the theory of 
evolution be true, the vegetable world was developed in its upward 
progress through the coniferae into the flowering plants.
Time will 
not allow me to do more than glance briefly at the characters of the 
several orders.
Ferns have a stem which in our British species is 
either a short rootstock or a creeping underground rhizome, but 
which in many fossil and exotic kinds forms a tall erect trunk, and 
in some others has a climbing habit.
The leaves are large, generally 
much and elegantly divided, and coiled spirally when young.
The 
fructification is borne at the back of the leaves, or on certain 
modified leaves ; it consists of clusters of spore cases often covered 
at first with a transparent membrane.
The spore cases in most of 
our British species burst by means of an elastic ring round the 
margin, and scatter the spores.
This is the non- sexual stage of the 
plant.
The spores develop, not into a fern-plant like that from which 
they spring, but into a small green heart-shaped frond like a liver- 
wort, called the prothallus ; this frond bears antheridia and arche- 
gonia, from the union of which the young fern springs.
Thus, while 
the non-sexual stage may be a lofty tree, enduring for a century, the 
sexual stage is no bigger than one's finger-nail, and perishes in a few 
weeks.
In certain annual species, however, the prothallus is more 
22 
The Naturalist, 
persistent, so that tlie Juration of the two generations is more nearly 
equal.
The order of the horsetails, Equisetaceae, now contains but a single 
genus, Equisetum, not large, but of nearly world-wide distribution ; 
the order is also of high antiquity, and of great importance to the 
geologist, since it includes the gigantic and well-known plants of the 
coal measures, Sigillaria, Calamites, &c.
The horsetails have erect, 
hollow-jointed stems, bearing toothed sheaths, and whorls of branches.
The fructification consists of capsules borne on the under surface of 
umbrella-shaped scales, which are clustered together into a cone at 
the end of the stems.
The spores bear four long elastic arms, which 
are coiled tightly around them when moist, and unroll when dry : so 
that the spores when breathed on under the microscope, twist and 
writhe about in the most striking manner.
The germination is 
similar to that of ferns.
The Marsiliacese contain but a single British species, the pilTwort, 
a small creeping plant with grass-like leaves, but spirally coiled 
when young, like those of ferns.
The fruit consists of brown capsules 
like peppercorns ; these are divided by partitions into four cells, each 
cell containing many membranous sacs.
The sacs at the upper part 
of the cells contain many small spores, those at the bottom of the cell 
but a single large spore.
The small spores contain moving filaments 
like those in the antheridia of ferns and mosses ; the large spores 
have a hole in the outer coat through which a portion of the inner 
coat protrudes and becomes developed into a prothallus, bearing 
archegonia, which are fertilized by the contents of the small 
spores.
The Lycopodiace^, or club-mosses," like the horsetails, are a small 
order, but found in all parts of the world, and are of great antiquity, as 
the huge Lepidodendron of the coal measures belonged to this order.
Some are rigid and leafy, like miniature conifers ; others are more 
like mosses in habit, but may be readily distinguished by the leaves 
containing bundles of spiral vessels.
The greenhouse plants which 
gardeners call mosses, are really club mosses— Se laginella.
The 
fructification is entirely different from that of mosses, the spore cases 
are sessile in the axils of the leaves, and are of two kinds — one 
kind containing small and the other large spores.
The germination 
is similar to that in the pillwort, In the genus Lycopodium only the 
small spores are met with.

Cardnus eriophorus.
— 1 have to thank Mr. Webster for correcting my 
error as to this plant not having been recorded for South-East Yorkshire.
It was scarcely likely that so conspicuous a plant should have escaped 
notice.
I have not Baines's "Flora " by me ; but it is not given in 
" Topographical Botany," nor mentioned specially for the East Riding in 
Baker's Supplement.
In the south of England I have noticed the stems 
of this thistle to be commonly inhabited by a white grub, which eats the 
pith, and finally, having gone through the pupa stage, perforates the 
stalk (I do not know how), and emerges as a small slender-bodied moth 
with forewings, white spotted with black, ermine-fashion.

stated above, but the moth is brown with white blotch ; it is common 
in the north of England as weU as the south.

The Common" Scoter.
— On the 10th of August I shot a nice specimen 
of the common scoter {Oidemia nigra?), a male bird, in the Ryburne 
valley ; it was evidently an adult, and in very good plumage.
This 
species is not common in this part of Yorkshire, though occasionally 
observed — one having been shot in this district a coujile of years ago.
Being such excellent divers, and able to swim a long distance under water, 
and seldom remaining many seconds on the surface when distiu'bed, makes 
them rather difficult to shoot.
The bird is being preserved.

Spring Migrants.
— In Mr. Butteifield's list of spring migrants I 
notice the yellow hammer and the pied wagtail.
May I ask if these two 
birds are absent in winter in the district from which Mr. Butterfield 
writes ?
Both of them are constantly resident here (Lofthousej.
The 
latter-mentioned is said to leave the inland parts of the country and to 
resort to the coast in winter, but I have observed them here in the fallows 
in all the winter months.
May not the accession of wagtails on the coast 
in winter be from Norway or some other northern country 1 — George 
Roberts, Lofthouse, Wakefield.
Stonechat.
— Since my note on this bird in the March number, I have 
been anxiously looking for further information concerning its habits in 
the Huddersfield and Halifax districts.
Mr. Yarley contends that the 
stonechat is only an accidental visitor, and not a breeder.
I notice that 
it is entered in Mr. Hobkirk's work (2nd ed.) as remaining all the year 
round ; it therefore must breed, otherwise Mr. Hobkirk is wrong.
It is 
not conceivable that a species should remain permanently in a district 
and not breed.
In this instance we have two excellent observers residing 
in one and the same district giving us contradictory information.
It is 
not with a view of re-opening a dispute, but rather to elicit further details 
respecting the economy of the bird, that I have recurred to the subject.
If any readers of the Natwcdist have made any observations during the 
past season, I hope they will favour us with an account of them ; a little 
more light seems desirable.

Rare Lepidoptera at Wicken Fen.
— When at Wicken Fen last 
month, I had the pleasure of seeing tliree specimens of Bydrilla palustris 
m the local collector's boxes there.
I ascertained that at least fifteen 
specimens of this rare species had been taken this season.
I also saw 
long series of Macrogaster armidinis, Meli-ana flammea, and Nascia cilialis ; 
at least a hundred of each of these species must have been secured.

Awphydasis hetularia (Black Yar.)— On June 1st, whilst walking 
through Shipley Glen with some friends, my attention was called to two 
moths which were resting on the trunk of an oak tree.
On looking at 
them I was surprised to find a pair of A.
hetularia (black var.).
Here 
this variety seems to predominate, in fact very few indeed of the normal 
form are seen.

four specimens I observed in this district this season, three were of the 
black form.— G.

Acromjda alni.
— Mr^ Wait Palmer having spent a few hours at Escrick 
Park, the seat of Lord Wenlock, on July 25th, saw a caterpillar feeding 
ui)on a lime tree, which he secured and brought home for me.
You may 
be sure I was pleased to see it was a veritable alni.
— Thomas Foster, 6, 
Y^ren Lane, Selby, August 13th.
Acronycta alni in South Lincolnshire.
— On the 2nd of August, whilst 
botanising in Skegglethorpe Wood near Lincoln, with the Pev. W.
Fowler, 
I was lucky enough to espy, feeding upon the upper side of the leaf of 
Tilia parvifolia — the small-leaved lime tree — a caterpillar that at once 
attracted admiration and attention by its unique appearance.
Its dead- 
black velvety body, slashed across the back of each segment with a streak 
of lemon-yellow, each segment being adorned in addition by a pair of 
shining black bristles, enlarged and fl.attened at their free extremities like 
the ear-rests of a pair of old-fashioned spectacles, and unlike anything 
else in nature I ever saw, made a singular and beautiful picture against 
the full green of the lime leaf.
This was the rare A.
alni, as to the food- 
plant of which Mr. Newman, writmg in 1869, remarks there is consider- 
able doubt ; although from its specific name it should eat alder (Alnus) 
in a state of nature.
Mr. Newman, in his " History of British Moths," 
further states that the larva ' ' does not exhibit any symptoms of uneasi- 
ness when handled but here he was certainly in error, if this example 
of Alni is not the veriest untamed member of his species, for a more 
savage larva, pugnacious and intolerant of touch, I never saw.
The Rev.
W. Fowler can bear me out in saying the slightest touch with the finger 
or a pencil of one of the hairs (which seem peculiarly sensitive), would 
cause the creature to curve sharply round laterally, and attempt to seize 
the cause of annoyance with the comparatively powerful jaws of its glossy 
black head.
It is, moreover, a cannibal, for when I arrived at home I 
put it into a box with a couple of A .
megacepluda larvte for the night ; 
Rainfall for July.
25 
next morning one of them was more than three-parts deTonred, Ahd 
being surprised, not "red-handed " exactly, but at rest full-length with 
jaws to the remnant of his victim.
Since, solitary confinement " being 
the sentence passed upon him [tender-hearted entomologists don't believe 
in capital punishment], Alni has sparingly indulged in leaves of the 
common Hme (T.
Europop.a), which he does not seem to relish so well as 
the scraps of T.
parmfolia I brought back from Skegglethorpe.
A. alni 
has not before, I believe, been recorded for Lincolnshire ; which fact, 
together with the above new passage in its life-liistory (death-history for 
the Megacephala, 'spite of its big head), is my excuse for this perhaps 
prolix communication.
But I often wish the Naturalist contained more 
entomology.
Entomologists, however, prefer to " beat about the bushes " 
a good deal before they venture on quiU-diiving.

The Naturalist.
Taking advantage of this year being the centenary of the death of Linneus, 
he gave a general review of the progress of zoological knowledge since 
that epoch, and then taking Linneus's arrangement of the mammalia 
from the Systema NatnA^m, of which he had a large diagram on the 
screen, he compared it with the various genera and species as at present 
understood, concluding with these words: — '^Our knowledge of the 
living inhabitants of the earth has indeed changed since that time.
Our 
views of their relations to the universe, to each other, and to ourselves, 
have undergone great revolutions.
The knowledge of Linneus far 
surpassed that of any of his contemporaries ; but yet of what we know 
now, he knew but an infinitesimal amount, and much that he thought he 
knew we now deem to be false." The address was followed by the report 
of the ''Close Time" Committee, read by Rev. Canon Tristram ; this report 
dealt chiefly with the statements published by Messrs.
Buckland, Spencer 
Walpole, and Archibald Young, commissioners appointed by Government 
to report on the Scotch Herring Fisheries.
He boldly refuted nearly 
every statement made in their report, and showed that in numerous 
clauses the conclusions arrived at by the Commission were exactly the 
reverse of what their own statements warranted.
Instead of eleven 
hundred millions of herrings being destroyed annually by the gannets on 
these coasts, the report showed on almost incontestible evidence that the 
numbers destroyed by them could not exceed 350,350,000 ; and in the 
discussion which followed, in which Dr. Gwyn Jeffreys and others took 
part, it was shown that, instead of the herring being the chief or only 
food of the gannet as stated by the Royal Commission, it fed chiefly, 
though not entirely, on the coal-fish.
Dr. Williamson also read a paper 
on '' The so-called Radiolarians and Diatoms of the Coal measures," in 
which he produced evidence to show that these remains so-called by Dr.
Carruthers could scarcely be referred to that family, but from their close 
resemblance in internal structure to certain resting spores and seed-cases 
of some of the Cryptogamia, were much more likely to belong to the 
latter class of organisms — indeed some of the diagrams of these forms 
were so striking that no one could doubt their aflinity.
This opinion was 
concurred in by Sir J.
D. Hooker, Dr. Balfour, and Count Castracane.

held at Settle on Saturday, the 20th of July, the main object being to 
visit the famous Victoria Cave.
About 120 members and visitors took 
part in the proceedings, which commenced at nine a.m. by an examination 
of the various remains preserved in the museum of the Giggleswick 
Grammar School, Mr. R.
H. Tiddeman, M.A., F.G.S., secretary to the 
British Association Committee for the Settle Cave Exploration, acting as 
guide.
This done, the various exploration parties were formed — one led 
by Dr. Willis, of Bradford, taking the west route to Feizor, and another 
led by ]Mr. W.
Gomersall and Mr. B.
H. Tiddeman taking the east route 
past Castleberg and Attermere Scars for the old calamine shafts (which 
produced numerous mineral specimens), while smaller groups and indi- 
viduals dispersed in different directions.
At two o'clock all re-assembled 
at the Victoria Cave, where Mr, Tiddeman delivered an address upon 
the work of exploration, not forgetting to remind the members that the 
work is now at a standstill for want of funds.
Tea at the Mechanics' 
Hall and the Lion Hotel, Settle, having been despatched, and the 
sectional meetings concluded at the National Schools, the general 
meeting opened at six p.m. in the large National Schoolroom, the chair 
being occupied by ]\Ir. Thomas Tate, president of the Geological Section.
The roll being called, 15 societies were found to be represented.
The list 
of new subscribers included the Duke of Devonshire, jSIr. R.
H. Tidde- 
man, ]Mr. C.
Stainland Wake of Hull, Mr. J.
Ray Eddy, F.G.S., of 
"Repoets of Societies.
29 
Skipton, Dr. Wesley, of "Wetherby, and Mr. Matthew Foster, of Sancton, 
near Brongh.
The Hull Microscopical and Field Naturalists' Club was 
admitted into union.
A vote of thanks was passed to Mr. Tate for his 
efficient services as local secretary, to Mr. R.
H. Tiddeman, Dr. Willis, 
Mr. W.
Gomersall of Otterburn, Mr. Birkbeck of Settle, and Mr.
Clapham of Austwick, for their services during the day.
Mr. C.
H. 
Bothamley of Leeds reported the progress of the Exhibition Committee.
The reports of sections being next business, Mr. Thos.
Lister of Barnsley 
reported for the Vertebrate Section, and stated that Mr. John Grassham 
of Leeds was appointed on the Pubhcation Committee.
IVL^.
E. E.
Prince 
of Leeds, for the Conchological Section, reported that owing to the 
absence of conchologists comparatively few species had been collected, 
and that Mr. Wm.
Cash, F.
G. S.
, of HaUf ax, had been chosen for the 
Publication Committee.
For the Entomological Section Mr. John 
Grassham of Leeds stated that owing to a similar absence of entomolo- 
gists none but common butterflies and other insects had been taken.
For 
the Botanical Section Dr. Parsons reported that the Rev. W.
Fowler, 
M.A., president of the section, was elected its representative on the 
Publication Committee of the Union.
The localities explored diu'ing the 
day had been Settle, Giggleswdck, Feizor, and Stackhouse.
Another 
route taken was from Malliam by Gordale Scar, Malham Cove and Tarn, 
and Capon Hall to Settle.
The present was the first time that the section 
had met in a mountain-limestone district, and the flora had consequently 
presented some new features, as the mingling of limestone plants with 
species of a northern type, and also the abundance of certain very local 
species.
He noticed the abrupt change in passing from the limestone to 
the Silurian strata, the limestone plants suddenly ceasing, and being 
replaced by the heaths, Empetrum, Juncus squarrosus, &c.
The number 
of Vasculares observed during the day was 291, or higher than at any 
previous meeting, the following being the principal rarities : — Trollins 
europaeus, Meconopsis cambrica (denizen), Thlaspi occitanum, Viola 
lutea, Alsine verna.
Geranium sylvaticum, G.
sanguineum, and G.
lucidum ; Cochlearia alpina, Potentilla recta (?), casual, Pubus saxatiHs, 
R Chamsemorus, Rosa moUissima, Sedum Telephium, Saxifraga hyp- 
noides, Carduus heterophyllus, Crepis paludosa, Hieracium palHdum, and 
H. prenanthoides ; Vaccinum Vitis-idsea, Anchusa sempervirens (alien), 
Primula farinosa, Gnaphalium dioicum, Salix pentandra and purpiu^ea ; 
Potamogeton acuminatus, P.
heterophyllus, Taxus baccata, Gymnadenia 
Conopsea, Paris quadrifolia, Ruscus aculeatus (alien), Blysmus com- 
pressus, Carex ampuUacea, Sesleria caerulea, Koehleria cristata, Asplenium 
viride, Cystopteris fragilis, and Nephrodium rigidum.
Mosses and 
lichens were far more abundant than at any place hitherto visited by the 
Union.
The mosses included Sphagnum squarrosum (fr.), Ditrichum 
flexicaule, Trichostomum tophaceum, T.
crispulum, Tortula tortuosa, T.
Isevipila, Racomitrium lanuginosum (on limestone, a rare occurrence), R.
aciculare, and R.
heterostichum ; Ptychomitrium polyphyllum (fr.).
30 
The N/VTUralist.
Philonotis calcarea, Tetraplodon mnioides (fr.), Webera albicans, Bryum 
pseudotriquetmm, and B.
pallens ; Mnium serratum, Zieria julacea, 
Cinclidotus fontinaloides (fr.), Neckera crispa, Anomodon viticulosus, 
Hypnum revolvens, and H.
stramineus ; the hepaticfe, Cliiloscyphus 
polyanthus, Madotheca platyphylla, and Reboulia hemisphaerica (£r.
), and 
the lichens CoUema fluviatile, Endocarpon miniatum, &c.
Not many 
fungi were seen, Cantharellus muscigenus being the most noteworthy.
Among algse were Batrachospermum moniliforme, Conferva capillaris, 
Nostoc verrucosum, Rivularia calcarea, and Encyonema prostratum.
Mr. Tate reported for the geological section that the local silurian 
and carboniferous sections found full occupation for the members.
The Moughtow quarries exijibit the carboniferous limestone resting 
horizontally upon the denuded edges of Coniston flags, separated by 
a conglomerate of waterworn silurian pebbles in a calcareous matrix.
The series of Craven faults was clearly expounded by Mr. Tiddeman 
daring a stroll from Settle by Scalebar Foss and Attermere to the 
Victoria Cave.
Specimens of malachite, heavy spar, galena, calcite 
and calamine were obtained at the old lead mines.
Of the rarer lime- 
stone fossils we noted Psammodus porosus, Asaphus granuliferus, A.
globiceps, Bellerophon costatus, B.
cornu-arietis, Pleurorhynchus ala3- 
formis, Aviculo-pecten concentricus, Platycrinus ellipticus.
Dr. Parsons 
remarked the abrupt change, near Capon Hall and at Malham Tarn, from 
the calcareous flora to the peat morass covered with heath, Empetrum, 
SphagTium, &c.
(hardly a single species being common to the carboniferous 
and silurian areas), as an illustration of the assistance which a knowledge 
of botany afibrds in defining the limits of strata.
Mr. Tate says of the 
Victoria Cave that the remains found within it indicate successive 
occupations at different ages by man, and by animals now extinct in 
Britain.
The uppermost or Romano-Celtic layer contained Roman 
pottery and coins, Celtic imitations of Roman coins, dress-fasteners, 
or ''frogs," perforated bone studs, needles, spoon-shaped fibulae, 
bone and stone spindlewhorls, bronze brooches inlaid with coloured 
enamels, bronze and silver rings, transparent and coloured glass 
beads, with the bones of animals still living in Britain — the Celtic short- 
horned ox, the goat, pig, horse, dog, stag, badger, fox, and two species of 
domestic fowl.
Interbedded with the limestone talus six feet lower, we 
come upon the neolithic layer, containing polished stone implements (but 
no metals), chipped flint tools fastened into bone handles, arrow-heads, 
bone harpoons, one with double barbs facing in one direction, and a third 
reversed barb at the base, for attachment to the fish-spearing shaft.
The 
grizzly bear, brown bear, and reindeer evidence a cold climate, and their 
remains are preceded by twenty feet of glacial deposit, underlying which 
we have the palaeolithic layer, or the hyaena's den, containing the gnawed 
bones and teeth of Elephas antiquus.
Rhinoceros leptorrhinus, Bos 
primigenius, Hippopotamus major, Canis lupus, and a human fibula, 
together with a small humerus bearing very evident toolmarks thereon.
REroRTS OF Societies.

In the discussion which followed this report, Messrs.
Tiddeman, Jas.
Spencer, of Halifax, W.
Gomersall, and others took part.
The meeting 
concluded with an interesting general discussion on the geological 
structure of the district.
— Wm. Denison Roebuck, Hon. Sec.
The Fifth Meetiistg, on Bank Holiday, Monday, August 5th, was 
fixed for Bishop's Wood, near Selby, the Yorkshire entomologist's well- 
known happy hunting ground.
" The weather, which both previously 
and subsequently was rough and stormy, cleared up for the day, and, as 
usual, the Union was favoured with ''Queen's weather." There were 
about 50 or .
60 members present during the day, and, as might be 
expected, the entomologists — who were almost entirely absent from the 
previous meeting — turned up in preponderating numbers ; and as also 
might be expected, the crowds of geologists who visited Settle were 
almost totally absent at Bishop's Wood.
A few botanists investigated 
during the day Bray ton Barf, Morton Bog, and surrounding country.
After three-o'clock tea, served in a marquee at the Red Lion Inn — and 
Sections — the general meeting opened at five o'clock in the National 
School-room, the Rev. Wm.
Fowler, M.A., of Liversedge, president of 
the Botanical Section, occupying the chair.
Thirteen Societies were 
found to be represented.
The list of new subscribers included Mr. W.
Gomersall, of Otterburn, Bell Busk ; Dr. Willis, of Bradford ; Mr. Wm.
Robinson, of Sedbergh ; Mr. Wildman, of Settle ; Mr. T.
L. Matthew- 
man, of Selby ; Dr. R.
Spruce, the eminent botanical traveller, of 
Malton ; Mr. Thomas Wilson, of York ; and the Rev. H.
F. Barnes- 
Lawrence, M.A., C.M.Z.S., of Birkin Rectory.
Votes of thanks to the 
local secretary, Mr. Wm.
Prest, of York ; to the Vicar of Brayton, for 
the use of the school ; and to the Ecclesiastical Commissioners, for per- 
mission to visit the Wood — were passed.
The reports of sections were 
then taken.
— Mr. Roebuck stated that the Conchological Section had been 
represented by one member only, Mr. J.
D. Butterell, of Hull, who had 
taken many of the common species, but nothing of very special mark.
— 
Mr. W.
Prest then reported on the lepidoptera shown in the Entomo- 
logical Section, as follows : — About 60 species were taken and seen, 
amongst them being A.
Paphia, V.
cardui, L.
monacha, C.
immanata, 
(some fine varieties), C.
pyraliata, C.
spinula, H.
nictitans, X.

camelina, N.
dictsea, N.
dromeda- 
rius, IST.
ziczac, N.
dodonsea, &c., &c, Mr. Wm.
Denison Roebuck, of 
Leeds, remarked that the crowded state of the Entomological Section had 
rendered necessary the splitting off of a sub-section for the ''neglected 
orders," of which several had occurred.
The most noticeable beetles were 
Lina populi from Morton Bog, Strangalia armata and Chrysomela staphy- 
lea, from the wood.
The best hymenopteron was a black humble-bee 
32 
The Naturalist.
Bombus Harrisellus^ taken by Mr. J.
W. Shaw of Wakefield.
In other 
groups were noticed the ''cleg" (Hsematopota pluvialis), the scorpion 
fly (Panorpa communis), &c.
Mr. G.
Brook, ter.
(Huddersfield) had 
taken several species of Collembola.
For the Botanical Section Dr.
Parsons reported : The localities explored were Hambleton, Bishop's 
Wood, Morton Bog, Monk Fryston, Biggin, &c.
The nature of the soil 
varied in these several places between sand, clay, limestone, and peat, 
and the flora represented corresponding variations.
Few special rarities 
were found, the flora being the ordinary one of a lowland district ; never- 
theless, owing to the comparative richness in flowering plants of such 
regions, the number of species observed was fully as great as at any 
previous meeting.
Three hundred kinds were noted, the following being 
the more noteworthy : — Clematis Vitalba (denizen), Monk Fryston ; 
Genista anglica, Morton Bog ; Malva moschata, Biggin ; Hubus incurvatus, 
Morton Bog ; R.
hystrix, P.
carpinifolius, and R.
corylifolius, Hamble- 
ton ; Erigeron acris, Micklefield ; Leontodon hirtus.
Biggin ; Picris 
hieracioides.
Biggin and Micklefield ; Gentiana Pneumonanthe, Morton 
Bog : Linaria minor.
Monk Fryston, Chenopodium rubrum, Hambleton ; 
Zannichellia pedicellata, Monk Fryston (not given for M.
W. Yorks.
in 
Top. Bot.
) ; Potamogeton densus, and Sagittaria sagittifolia, Selby Dam ; 
Brachypodium pinnatum, Hambleton (by roadside, rare ofi" limestone) ; 
and Sedum Telephium (denizen), Hambleton.
About 23 mosses and a few 
other cryptogams were noticed, mostly the very common lowland species.
The fungi included Polyporus hispidus and Boestelia lacerata.
On 
behalf of the Geological Section Dr. Parsons stated that Hambleton stood 
on the new red sandstane, which rock was well shown in a section at 
Hambleton Haugh as a soft red sandstone strongly bedded, without 
fossils.
On the southern slope of Hambleton Haugh was a gravel mainly 
composed of rounded fragments of carboniferous sandstone and grit ; on 
the northern slope of Brayton Barf a few large boulders were scattered 
about, one of which appeared to be basalt.
Of the alluvial strata which 
surrounded this island of trias and covered the greater part of the area of 
the district, the most important member was a thick bed of laminated 
clay, in some places on the surface, in others capped with a thin layer of 
sand or warp.
At Monk Fryston, three miles to the west, the magnesian 
limestone came to the surface.
In a quarry by the railway a quarter of a 
mile south of Milford Junction, a few fossils had been seen on the 
weathered surface of the beds, mostly a small species of Axinus, and 
some spines, probably 05" some moUuscan shell.
In the same c^uarry was 
a fault, recently exposed in a new road cutting, and not marked in the 
Geological Survey map : the magnesian limestone being elevated into 
juxtaposition with the new red sandstone.
Near some calcareous springs 
at Monk Fryston was a patch of boggy ground full of semi-fossil shells of 
existing species.
—In Vertebrate Zoology the repr>rt was given by Mr. E.
Hunter, F.C.S., president of the section, and Mr. P.
Richardson, both 
of Goole.

FLOWERLESS PLANTS, AND THEIR HABITATS.
(Continued.) 
ByH.
Franklin Parsons, M.D., F.G.S.
We now come to the mosses.
The word " moss " is very loosely 
used in popular language, being applied to club mosses, liverworts, 
lichens, algee, fungi, and even small tufted flowering plants, as 
Sagina.
The plants called mosses (Musci) by botanists form, how- 
ever, a very distinct and easily recognisable order, and present, on a 
miniature scale, an exquisiteness of design, an elegance of form, and 
a beauty of colour, which, were they fifty times larger, would give 
them a high rank among ornamental plants.
The stems of mosses 
are short, sometimes almost wanting, and rarely more than a few 
inches in length, though in two or three of our British species they 
sometimes exceed a foot.
The leaves vary in outline, but are often 
ovate or lanceolate, and always simple and sessile.
They have usually 
a single simple nerve, not unfrequently prolonged beyond the blade 
of the leaf into a bristle-like point ; others are nerveless, and others 
have two short nerves at the base.
The nerve contains no vessel, but 
consists merely of cellular tissue, as also does the stem, and indeed 
the whole plant.
The blade consists usually of bat a single layer of 
cells.
The leaves often curl up when dry, and expand when moist ; 
and mosses are remarkable for their power of enduring drying, 
reviving on being moistened after the lapse of years.
The flowers of 
mosses are of two kinds, sometimes found together, at other times 
only on different plants.
The male flowers consist of sausage-shaped 
bodies called antheridia, mixed with slender threads (paraphyses), of 
which the use is not known.
The antheridia are composed of cells, 
each containing a minute filament ; these filaments when set free 
swim with a wriggling movement, and are the fertilizing particles.
The Archegonia are flask-shaped bodies containing an embryo sac, 
from which the fruit is developed.
The fruit is in some kinds borne 
at the end of the stem, in others in the axils of leaves ; the leaves 
surrounding it are often different in shape from the others.
The fruit 
when young is covered with the calyptra, a membranous envelope 
like that at the base of a rhubarb leaf.
As the fruit-stalk elongates, 
the calyptra is torn off at the base and carried up on the top of the 
fruit, leaving sometimes, however, a short sheath surrounding the 
base of the footstalk.

the fruit, the month of the urn is seen to be closed by a lid, often 
exactly the shape of the lid of a teapot, sometimes long and conical.
Under the lid the mouth of the nrn is in most mosses surrounded by 
one or two rows of teeth, in number either 4 or some multiple of 4 
by 2 — as 8, 16, 32, or 64.
They vary very much in shape in different 
mosses, but are always brightly coloured, and form beautiful objects.
They are highly hygroscopic, and exhibit remarkable movements with 
varying degrees of humidity or dryness, as when breathed upon, and 
at each movement a little cloud of spores is jerked into the air.
When the spores germinate they develop into a green conferva-like 
thread, which soon produces stem and leaves, and then perishes.
It is to be noticed that the product of the fertilized germ cell in 
mosses is not what from the analogy of higher plants we should have 
expected, a single spore, but a capsule containing many spores.
Hence it is considered by Hofmeister and other botanists that there 
is an " alternation of generations " in mosses like that of ferns, the 
duration of the two stages being inverted — the persistent sexual stage 
of the moss corresponding to the prothallus, and the fruit- stalk and 
capsule of the moss corresponding to the non-sexual perennial fern.
Besides the true spores mosses have several other means of propaga- 
tion ; some have creeping rhizomes and send up suckers, the stems 
of many send out rootlets and take root readily if broken off, others 
again bear minute green bulbs on the stem or leaves, which fall off 
and develop into young plants.
So efficient are these supplemental 
means of propagation, that many mosses which are common and 
abundant are rarely or never found in fruit.
Hepatic^ may be divided into scale mosses and liverworts ; the 
latter have no distinct stem and leaves, the former have.
The leaves 
of scale-mosses have never any midrib, they are placed nearly in the 
same plane as the stem, and inserted by a broad base, like the main- 
sail is attached to a mast.
They are often of singularly complicated 
shapes, and furnished with stipules underneath.
The fruit differs 
from that of mosses in several respects ; as the stalk elongates, the 
capsule bursts through the apex of the calyptra, which remains as a 
sheath surrounding the base of the stalk, generally enclosed in a 
calyx.
The capsule has no lid nor peristome, but contains mingled 
with the spores spiral elastic threads ; when ripe it splits into four 
valves, and the spiral springs elongating, scatter the spores like a 
pea is shot out of a child's toy-gun.
In the genius Riccia, which 
forms the link with the lichens, the spore-case is imbedded in the 
frondj it does not burst, and contains no elaters.
Parsons : Flowerless PlxVNts and their Habitats.

The remaining orders of flowerless plants — viz., liciiens, algse, and 
fungi — belong to the class of Thallogens, which have no distinction 
bettveen stem and leaves.
These orders are hard to define, as they 
embrace such a large variety of dissimilar forms, and are so closely 
connected by intermediate links, that the extremes of one order differ 
much more than some members of the order do from members of 
another order, and it is therefore very difficult to know where to 
draw the line.
Eoughly speaking, it may be said that lichens are 
perennial aerial plants, containing green chlorophyll cells, and drawing 
their nourishment from the air, and not from the substances on which 
they grow, and which they merely adhere to superficially, and do not 
penetrate.
Alg^e are plants containing chlorophyll, growing in water 
or on damp surfaces, and drawing their nouiishment from inorganic 
matters dissolved in water.
Fangi are plants without chlorophyll, 
never aquatic in their perfect fructified state, growing on and pene- 
trating diseased living, or decaying dead, organic matter, and deriving 
their nourishment from the substances on which they grow.
Chloro- 
phyll, I may remind you, is the green matter found in plants which 
has the power, under the influence of light, of decomposing the 
carbonic acid of the air, and appropriating the carbon to build up 
into organic matter.
Lichens vary much in appearance : some are like miniature 
branching leafless shrubs, others have a flat leaflike frond, and a very 
large number form merely a crust, closely adhering to the w^ood or 
stone on which they grow.
The fruit consists of knobs or saucer-like 
shields, generally of a different colour from the rest of the plant.
The male element is supposed to be represented by certain little 
cavities containing minute rodlike bodies, without movement, called 
spermatia.
Besides these organs, lichens bear very generally powdery 
warts, called soredia ; the grains of whick the powder consists 
germinate, like the bulbils of mosses, into new plants.
Many lichens 
rarely or never fruit, and are propagated almost wholly by the soredia.
Microscopically the frond of a lichen consists externally of a cuticle, 
or layer of closely-packed colourless cells, beneath this is a layer 
made up of round green cells, called gonidia, which are the active 
organs of nutrition; the deeper part of the frond is made up of long 
interlacing filaments, and beneath all is often a darker layer — the 
hypothallus.
The fruit is made up of elongated sacs called asci, each 
enclosing one or more spores.
Mingled with the asci are a number 
of slender threads called paraphyses.
Arguing from the resemblance 
on the one hand between the gonidia of lichens and certain single-

The Naturalist.
celled alg£B, and on the other hand between the filamentous layer of 
lichens and the tissues of many fungi, and between the structure of 
the fruit in lichens, and in those fungi which have their spores 
contained in asci, certain very advanced German botanists have 
started the wild hypothesis that lichens are not a distinct order of 
plants at all, but fungi, which enclose within their substance lowly 
organized algee — the gonidia — and detain them as slaves, to provide 
their captors with nourishment by decomposing the carbonic acid of 
the air.
Fungi consist of two elements — the vegetative structure, and the 
fructification.
The vegetative structure, or mycelium, is made up 
of long interlaced thread-like cells, which penetrate the decaying 
substances from which they draw nutriment.
In the mushroom this 
part of the plant may be found as a white, cottony-looking substance, 
penetrating the earth around the bottom of the stem : while what we 
call the mushroom is really not the whole plant, but only the fruit.
The fruit in the simplest fungi, as moulds, consists merely of spores 
borne on the ends of the threads ; in the larger and more complex 
fungi, the spores are produced from a special fertile layer, called the 
hymenium (in the mushroom forming the radiating gills or plates 
underneath) ; this is borne on a fleshy receptacle made up of com- 
pacted filaments.
There are two main divisions of the fungi : in the 
first the spores are borne free either on the surface or in the interior 
of the receptacle ; in the other the spores are borne, as in lichens, in 
sacs or cells, called asci.
The number of spores produced is very 
vast, and fungi have, in addition, other means of propagation — as 
conidia, which are powdery excrescences something like the soredia 
of lichens.
Indeed so varied are the stages in the life history of the 
fungi, that the progress of research is continually tending to lessen 
the number of species, by showing that what had been thought to be 
distinct kinds, belonging even to different families, are really only 
different conditions of one and the same plant.
Algse differ vastly in form and size ; many are microscopic, con- 
sisting, like the red-snow plant, of a single cell ; while on the other 
hand some of the seaweeds attain a large size, those forming the 
great floating masses called Sargasso Cof tropical seas) being among 
the largest known plants.
The algae are classed in three divisions, viz : 
the red, the brown, and the green, the first two being exclusively 
marine, while the green forms are many of them found in fresh 
water.
All the varied hues of colour depend upon the presence of 
varieties of chlorophyll, by the possession of which algae are distin-

guished from fungi.
In algte the tLallus, or vegetative part, forms 
the greater part of the plant, the fructification being inconspicuous, 
and in some kinds rarely met with ; in fungi the fructification is 
usually the most conspicuous part of the plant.
Algae consist 
entirely of cells, sometimes embedded in a mass of jelly.
In the 
simplest forms each cell constitutes a distinct plant, in others the cells 
are placed end to end in one or many rows, forming long threads, 
and in many seaweeds they form flat expanded leaflike fronds.
One 
order — the diatoms — is remarkable for the cell wall being of flint, and 
exquisitely sculptured with lines and markings of wonderful diversity.
Many of the lower algae possess astonishing powers of locomotion : 
thus the unattached Diatoms swim with a darting movement, Oscilla- 
toria by slow side-to-side undulations ; Vibrio by rapid wriggling ; 
Yolvox and its allies, by means of cilia.
The fructification of algae is very varied ; we often find several 
different kinds in the same species.
The principal forms met with 
are, antheridia containing moving, fertilizing particles ; spores con- 
tained in definite spore cases ; resting spores formed from the cell 
contents after fertilization ; tetraspores, cells containing spore-like 
bodies in clusters of four ; and zoospores, green bodies formed with- 
out impregnation from the contents of the ordinary vegetative cells, 
swimming actively by means of cilia, and which have even been said 
to possess an eye to guide their movements by.
In some of the green algee we find the process of fertilization 
reduced to its simplest 230ssible form — two exactly similar cells, lying 
side by side, become connected by a transverse tube like the letter H.
The green cell contents are all collected either into one of the cells 
or into the transverse tube, forming a round mass, which ultimately 
breaks up into spores.
There is yet one other order of Cryptogamia — the Characete — which 
I should probably have forgotten had I not been reminded of it by 
finding an interesting example on Saturday.
I cannot be said, how- 
ever, to have missed it out of the proper sequence, for these plants 
are so utterly unlike all others that it is not known what their proper 
place is ; they are sometimes placed after the vascular acrogens, at 
others next the algse, but in either case simply as a matter of con- 
venience.
Like Equisetacse, Characea^ is a small order consisting of 
but a single genus, Chara — of world-wide distribution and of great 
antiquity, being at least as old as the lias.
Charas are leafless water 
plants with a thread-like stem, and whorls of branches bearing 
branchlets \ they have an unpleasant odour, and are generally

The Naturalist.
incrustcd with carbonate of lime.
The stems and branches are made 
up of tubules, in which the circulation of the cell contents is plainly 
visible under the microscope.
The reproductiye organs arise at the 
junction of the branchlets with the branches, and are of two kinds, 
called granules and nucules.
The granule, or male organ, is a small 
bright orange body ; it has two coats, the outer is transparent, the 
inner is orange red, and made up of eight three-cornered plates, 
composed of triangular cells.
These cells project at the edges, 
forming indentations, by which the plates are locked together, like 
the bones of the skull ; when ripe, however, they burst open.
From 
the centre of each plate a tube projects internally, these in the centre 
of the granule meet together and are connected with each other and 
with another pillar, which is a continuation inwards of the short 
stalk by which the granule is attached to the branch.
From this 
point of union spring a number of long wavy, closely-jointed threads, 
each joint being a cell in which is developed a moving filament like 
those of mosses.
The nucule is an oval body made up of a mass of 
cells, and coated with five spirally-twisted tubes, the points of which 
project at the top of the nucule like a crown ; in the centre between 
them is a minute opening by which the fertilizing particles are 
supposed to gain access to the interior.
The nucule, when ripe, falls 
off and germinates, producing a prothallus, from which several young 
plants arise by budding.
Thus countless thousands of fertilizing 
filaments are produced for each nucule to be impregnated ; we meet, 
however, with a similar disproportion between the number of pollen 
grains and ovules in some flowering plants, especially those fertilized 
by the wind, as the hazel and the yew.
Having thus given a brief description of the flowerless plants, I 
now come to the second part of my paper, viz., their " habitats," — i.e., 
the places in which they grow.
The geographical distribution of the 
cryptogams has been but imperfectly worked out, but is a field full of 
promise to the student of geographical botany.
These plants are far 
less liable than the flowering plants to be introduced or exterminated 
by direct human agency ; the influence of man upon the cryptogamic 
vegetation is indirect in providing or removing the conditions of soil, 
atmosphere, and moisture suitable to their growth.
The following 
remarks will have reference especially to the perennial mosses liver- 
worts and lichens ; the other orders for the most part either follow 
the same general laws, or depend for their occurrence rather upon the 
presence of the particular soil required by them, than upon climatic 
conditions or geographical situation.

Seligerki tristicha in England.
— In the Aug. number of the Natundisty 
under the heading Another Moss new to Yorkshire," it is said : " The 
moss {S.
tristich-a) is not only new to Yorkshire, but to England as well, 
the only stations hitherto known for it being in the Blair Athole district 
of the Scottish Highlands," (where it was found by Miss Mclnroy in 1860).
In Schimper's " Synopsis of European Mosses," however, under the

Stonechat, Yellow Hammer, and Pied Wagtail.
— In answer 
to Mr. Roberts' question {Naturalist Yol. 4, p.
23) as to whether 
the yellow-hammer and pied wagtail are absent in winter in this 
district, I may say in reference to my notes on the arrival of spring 
migrants (vol.
4, p.
10), there is an error — Instead of yellow-hammer 
which is said to have arrived on the 27th April, it ought to have been 
yellow woodwren.
The pied wagtail unquestionably leaves the neigh- 
bourhood in winter, neither is this a matter of surprise when the 
character of the locality is considered ; occasionally a few may stay in 
exceptionally mild winters, although I have not been so fortunate as to 
see any.
I was surprised, however, to see one in the first or second week 
in November, 1870, near the station yard, at Sedbergh ; this seemed even 
a more unfavourable place, as a winter residence, than this locality.
Respecting the stonechat I quite reciprocate Mr. Roberts' remarks as to 
the desirability of more light being thrown on this subject.
I have 
obtained what information I could respecting it, viz : — whether the 
stonechat habitually breeds in this neighbourhood ; and have investigated 
during the past season all the most likely places in this district for the 
purpose of discovering it breeding, but failed to establish its claim.
An 
old naturalist, however, tells me he once found a nest near this village on 
a heathy waste.
My father, who knows the bird well, says he has never 
met with it here, although he has found it not uncommon near Clapham.
My brother never found it during the years he was collecting in this part.
So it would appear that if it does breed at all it is a very rare visitor.
Tliis conclusion is not based on the phenomena of an exceptional season, 
but from observations extending over a number of years.
This local 
distribution of the s-tonechat has often puzzled me, especially when taken

It is certain that 
the species in question is often confounded both with the whinchat and 
the wlieatear, indeed stonechat is invariably applied as a local name to 
the wheatear in this district, and also in other parts of England and 
Scotland.

Stonechat.
— Since my note in April on the stonechat, I have searched 
both likely and unlikely places for this bird, especially on Dalton Bank, 
where the one was shot on the 5th of April last, but 1 have not had the 
pleasure of seeing one.
I also spent the first week in May with my 
friends at Hebden Bridge, and was not successful there ; and my friend 
Mr, Sam Gibson, a good ornithologist, has only one record of it occurring 
there.
It is a bird that frequents fiat and low-lying land.
I have always 
found it on the seacoast both west and east, and also in north and south 
Wales, and plentiful at Sherwood Forest.

The Hawfinch breeding near Leeds.
— I have to record the dis- 
covery last spring, between Coble Hall and Roundhay, of the hawfinch's 
nest.
Jt was placed high up in a holly tree, and was such as to remind 
one of the ring-dove's flat platform of a nest, consisting of a foundation 
of small sticks and twigs, lined with roots, hay, &c.
It contained five 
eggs, which were easily identified as those of the hawfinch {Coccothraustes 
vulgaris).
This summer a hawfinch was caught in a garden near Newlay ; 
it was a fine female, and was easily taken by a boy, having gorged itself 
with berries to such an extent as to prevent its escape.
Another speci- 
men was shot last December, near Otley.

of Cardamine amara are in error.
He was not really aware that it was 
found there, and that his including it in his list did not refer to that 
locality, but referred generally to the district.
We gladly make this 
correction, as, knowing that it had been planted by the stream at Storthes 
Hall, we were under the misapprehension that he had that spot in his 
mind.

— The sixth and closing meeting for 
1878 was held on Saturday, the 14th September, at Wortley for Wharn- 
cliffe Woods.
By kind permission of the Earl of Wharncliffe the members 
were allowed to search for insects, &c.
, and to traverse the private roads 
dming the day.
The day was fine and very enjoyable.
The attention of 
members, of whom there was a large gathering (including at one time the 
Earl of Wharncliffe), especially from Sheffield, was chiefiy confined to the 
woods and craggs of Wharncliffe Chase, one of the remains of the forest 
country which was once co-extensive with Sherwood Forest, and was in 
ancient tunes the haunt of Robin Hood and his outlaws, as well as of such 
fabulous monsters as the ^'Dragon of Wantley.
" Tea was served at 4, 
sections met at 4-45, and the general meeting opened at 5-30 p.m., 
under the presidency of Mr. Henry Clifton Sorby, F.R.S., of Sheffield.
The roll-call showed that 16 of the 28 societies were represented.
The 
total attendance would be about 80 or more.
The list of additional 
subscribers included the Earl of Wliarncliffe, Rev. Wm.
Jessop, Governor 
of Wesley College, Sheffield, Messrs.
Geo. Tiadall (Doncaster), Matthew 
B. Slater (Malton), George Jackson (York), Wm. Standering (Selby), 
F. Is'orthrop (Skipton), H.
Stowe Bell, A.R.S.M.
(Sheffield), G.
R. Vine 
(Attercliffe), Thos.
Andrews, F.C.S.
(Wortley), E.
B. Jenkinson, F.G.S.
(Swinton), Jno. Guest, F.S.A.
(Rotherham), Jno. Hutchinson (Barnsley), 
A. H.
Allen, F.C.S.
(Borough Analyst, Sheffield), and Samuel Drew, 
D. Sc. Ed., F.R.S.E.
(Chapeltown, near Sheffield).
On the motion of 
the Rev. William Jessop, seconded by Mr. Alfred H.
Allen, F.C.S., a 
vot3 of thanks to the Earl of Wharncliffe for the permission to explore 
the woods and to traverse the private roads, was passed ; and also, on the 
motion of Mr. C.
C. Hanson, of Stainland, seconded by Dr. Parsons, one 
to Mr. W.
R. Carter, of Sheffield, for his services as local secretary.
Dr.
Parsons stated on behalf of the JMap Committee that in the tracing of the 
contour lines from the 6-inch ordnance sheets, they would be glad to be 
assisted by such of the members as would undertake a portion of the 
work.
The secretary (W.
D. R.) then read a statement concerning the 
proposed exhibition at Leeds in connection with the annual meeting, 
urging the members to let the committee know early what they intended 
to exhibit, and reminding them that it being a county and not merely a 
local exhibition, it would rest with the members to render it worthy of 
the Union and of Yorkshire.
He announced that the guarantee fund had 
reached the amount of £201 .
The reports of sections were then given, 
as follows : — Mr. James Spencer, of Halifax, secretary of the Geological 
Section, reported : The Section had met in the large room at the Wortley 
Arms Hotel, at 5 o'clock, Mr. Sorby, F.R.S., P.G. S., &c., president of 
the Union, in the chair.
The chairman read a short paper on ''The 
Geology of the District," of which the following is a sketch.
The strata 
at Wharncliffe and Wortley consist of the lower coal measures ; to the west 
Keports of Societies.
47 
we have various members of the millstone grit series — the rough rock, 
third grits, and the Kinder Scout grits.
The sandstone rocks of Wharn- 
clilfe Craggs belong to the Greenmoor rock (or Elland flag rock).
The 
lowest coal is the so-called soft coal of Deepcar, 60 yards above which we 
have the well-known gannister coal, which varies in thickness from two 
to four feet.
The general character of the gritstones of the lower coal 
measures is like that of the millstone grit.
The main direction from 
which the material of the beds of both formations have been drifted is 
north-east.
It has long been thought by geologists that the grit rocks 
must have been derived from the granite, but the quartz and felspar are 
rarely found associated together so closely as to indicate the character of 
the original rock.
Mr. Sorby has, however, detected some actual jDebbles 
of a granite which is quite different from any met with in England, but 
closely resembles the coarse-grained granite of Korway.
These facts seem 
to prove that in the carboniferous epoch a large tongue of land projected 
from the coast of Norway into what is now the North Sea, and it was 
from the detritus of that ancient land that the grits and sandstone of the 
coal measures and millstone grit were mainly derived.
Boulder beds : 
The district about Sheffield is very free from erratics and glacial drift.
This may be attributed to the high ground of the Pennine chain cutting 
off the glacial currents which came down East Lancashire from this 
district.
Mr. Sorby has, however, found a few pebbles of granite and 
other travelled boulders, but they are so few that the manner in which they 
came is very uncertain.
An interesting discussion took place concerning 
the premature decay of many of the fine oaks and other trees in Wharn- 
cliffe Woods.
Mr. Samuel Drew, F.R.S., D.Sc.E., said that this was 
probably owing to the exhaustion of the potash from the soil, and that 
perhaps some other trees might succeed better, on the same principle as 
a rotation of crops.
A number of fossils collected during the day, chiefly 
by the secretary, were placed on the table and named.
The secretary 
(Mr. James Spencer) reported to the general meeting : The rocks of the 
district of the day's ramble, belonging to the lower coal measures, con- 
tain a rich suite of organic remains — the gannister coal being well known 
for its fossils, both animal and vegetable.
The roof of the coal contains 
an abundance of marine shells and fishes, while the coal itself contains 
certain round balls, rich in vegetable remains.
He had found to-day 
Dadoxylon Oldhamii (a kind of pine), Lepidodendron selaginoides, 
Sigillaria vasculare, S.
organum, Stigmaria ficoides, Amyelon, fern 
stems, and spores in abundance ; while the baum-pots had yielded 
Goniatites Listeri, G.
Looneyi, Orthoceras, Nautilus, Aviculo-pecten 
papyraceus, Posidonomya, and other shells.
Dr. Parsons had found 
in the shales at Wharncliffe Anthrocosia, Goniatites Listeri, Aviculo- 
pecten papyraceus, Posidonomya, Stigmaria ficoides, while fine specimens 
of lepidodendrons in the stone had been observed by other members.
Dr. Parsons, F.G.S., of Goole, secretary of the Botanical Section, 
reported as follows : — The places visited during the day were Oughti-

bridge, Wharncliffe Woods, Wortley, Bradfield, &c.
The number of 
species of vasculares recorded was only 101, against 300 at Hambleton, 
and 290 at the Settle meetings ; the falling off was due partly to the 
season being too far advanced, partly to the less extent of ground 
covered, but especially to the poverty in species of the local flora in this 
as in other coal-measure districts.
The best   finds were — Ranunculus 
Lenormandi, Corydalis claviculata, Ulex Galli, Prunus Padus, Pubus 
Koehleri, Rosa molhssima, Lamium Galeobdolon, Myosotis repens, Salix 
Smithiana, Taxus baccata, and Carex la3vigata from Wharncliffe, Alope- 
curus agrestis from Oughtibxidge, and the curious Cotyledon umbilicus, 
with its succulent trumpet-shaped leaves, from Bradfield.
Of mosses 
twenty species were found, including Dicranum falcatum, D.
palustre, 
Campylopus flexuosus, Pogonatum aloides, Grimmia apocarpa, Mnium 
serratum, Plagiothecum undulatum, and P.
elegans ; the larger Hyp- 
naceae were comparatively scarce.
Six Hepaticae were noticed, including 
Scapania \indulata, Jungermannia barbata, Calypogeia Trichomanis, and 
Lepidozia reptans.
The larger foliaceous saxicolous lichens were plentiful 
as regards individuals, on the loose blocks of gritstone, which lay 
scattered about in great profusion, Corticolous lichens were scarce 
and stunted.
The following were the species of lichens observed : — 
Cladonia cornucopioides, C.
furcata, Evemia furfuracea, Platysma 
glaucum, Cetraria aculeata, Parmelia saxatilis and P.
physodes, Peltigera 
canina, and Usnea barbata.
No algae were seen ; a filamentous substance 
found in a stream of ferruginous water issuing from an old colliery, 
seemed to consist wholly of oxide of iron, without any vegetable tissue.
Fungi were plentiful in the woods, and about twenty kinds were recorded.
The most remarkable was Cynophallus caninus, a species the singular 
appearance of which is well indicated by the name ; this was found by 
Dr. Lees and stated by him to be new to South-west Yorkshire.
Among 
the other species were Agaricus vaginatus, A.
rubescens, A.
muscarius, 
A. melleus, A.
rutilans, A.
laccatus, A.
squarrosus, A.
hypnorum, A.
semilanceatus, Hygrophorus X3sittaciiius, H.
miniatus, Lactarius quietus, 
Russula virescens, Paxillus involutus.
Boletus luridus, Polyporus betu- 
linus, and Calocera viscosa.
Entomological Section : Messrs.
S, D.
Bairstow, C.
W. Richardson, G.
T. Porritt, and others had collected 
about thirty species of lepidoptera, but mostly of the commonest descrip- 
tion, Notodonta dromedarius and N.
camelina being the only ones 
worth mention.
Hemiptera and hymenoptera (Tenthredinidse) were 
abundant, however, and in tolerable variety.
Mr. Thomas 
Lister, of Bamsley, secretary of the Vertebrate Section, reported 
that the section was inferior at Wharncliffe to previous meetings.
There were eighteen resident birds, amongst which were the kestrel, 
ring-dove, mountain linnet, magpie, and a flock of Canada geese, 
only three summer migrants were seen, the swallow, martin, and wheat- 
ear.
The Conchological Section was not represented, and only one 
species of mollusk was actually reported, — Wm. Denisox Roebuck, Sec.

FLOWERLESS PLANTS, AND THEIR HABITATS.
(Concluded.) 
ByH.
Franklin Parsons, M.D., F.G.S.
The traveller wlio is gifted with an observing eye must have noticed 
the great difference between different parts of England as regards 
the abundance and luxuriance of cryptogamic vegetation.
In some 
districts, especially near the western coasts, as Devonshire and the 
Lake district, every tree trunk, stone, and bank is covered with a rich 
drapery of green moss and hoary lichen, giving a softness and charm 
to the scenery, which in other districts, as our own, is lacking.
In 
the eastern counties — and still more, in the smoke-blackened vicinity 
of manufacturing towns, — the tree trunks are bare, and the mosses 
that occur are mostly terrestrial kinds.
In travelling up to London 
from the west, I have noticed that the moss-covered trees disappear 
from the scenery somewhere about the borders of Wiltshire and Berk- 
shire.
It does not necessarily follow that such districts are actually 
deficient in species ; for instance, in our own Goole district I have 
found 130 species of mosses, which is as many as I found in North 
Somerset, where I formerly lived, although mosses were incomparably 
more abundant and luxuriant there than here.
In the following 
remarks I shall take the abundance, luxuriance, and fertility of 
individuals, rather than the number of species met with, as the test 
by which to judge whether a given locality be favourable to crypto- 
gamic vegetation or otherwise.
Among the cryptogams, the more 
luxuriant the individual, the more likely it is as a rule to produce 
fruit ; in the flowering plants, on the contrary, the functions of 
nutrition and reproduction are to some extent antagonistic.
Tree trunks appear to me to give the best criterion by which to 
judge whether the climate of a given district is favourable to crypto- 
gams or otherwise, as such stations eliminate the influence of the 
composition and drainage of the soil, &c.
All trees are not equally 
affected by mosses ; the ash is by far the favourite, and the Goole 
district would be much worse off for mosses than it is, were it not 
that the ash is the prevailing tree.
Indeed a district like ours, where 
mosses do not grow readily, serves to show their likes and dislikes 
better than one where they will grow anywhere.
The stumps and 
trunks of hazel and hawthorn in hedgerows are also favourite situa- 
tions.
They are always found most luxuriant on the weather side of 
the tree.

Ths Naturalist.
The circumstances common to the whole ot a district, which are 
favourable to the growth of mosses and lichens, are — a pure air, a 
moist and rainy climate, a hilly and wooded country, and a soil 
composed of hard ancient rocks.
These conditions are generally met 
with in the west of England, and hence the luxuriance of cryptogams 
there.
The Rev. W.
Leighton says : — " The abundance of lichens in 
a fully developed and fructiferous condition is a sure and certain 
indication of the purity of the air and salubrity of the climate," 
Ferns and liverworts like similar conditions ; the latter are especially 
."atlantic" in their type of distribution, loving the mild moist 
equable atmosphere brought by the Gulf Stream to our western 
coasts.
Club-mosses grow on mountainous moors, and horsetails in 
wet places and shady woods.
Cryptogams love to grow 
" Where things that own not man's dominion dwell, 
And human foot hath ne'er or seldom been." 
Both mosses and lichens, but especially the latter, shrink from man's 
defilements, though a few mosses, as Tortula muralis and Fimaria 
liygrometrica maybe found even close to our large towns.
In suburban 
situations we often find tree trunks covered with a green powder, 
which by some botanists is considered to be an alga, and called 
Ghlorococcum vulgare, and by others is thought to consist of the 
gonidia of lichens in a rudimentary state.
The extension of our railway system is not on the whole favourable 
to cryptogams, but there is one situation in which they may be 
frequently found — viz., the dwarf wall which supports the platform : 
this is out of the way of the smoke, and frequently moistened by the 
steam escaping from under the engine.
Like the "ivy green" of 
which Dickens sings, they are great lovers of antiquity : an aged 
tree, an ancient building, or an old exposed rock, will generally be 
found richly covered with them.
In alpine situations, however, rocks 
which are much exposed undergo too rapid disintegration to afford a 
favourable foothold to mosses and lichens, and they will consequently 
be found in greater plenty on the more sheltered and moister aspects.
Mountains are indeed the favourite home of mosses and lichens ; some 
large genera are almost confined to such situations.
They extend far 
above the snow-line, and some lichens, as Lecldm geograpJiica, may even 
be found on sheltered rocks at the summits of the highest Alps ; the 
larger lateral-fruiting mosses and foliaceous lichens reach their 
maximum, however, in sub-alpine woods rather than in the higher 
mountain regions, which are more frequented by acrocarpous mosses 
and crustaceous lichens.

or human agency are sometimes the habitat of mountain mosses ; thus 
o;i the gritstone coping of an old clough at Dykemarsh, near Thorne, 
I have found several species of mosses which do not, to my knowledge, 
grow elsewhere in the district, or at least within several miles — and two 
at least of them {Racomitrium laying inos am and PtycJiomitrium polypJiyl- 
lum) are of a decidedly mountain type, and, I suspect, have been 
introduced with the stones from the high moors of the west of 
Yorkshire .
Generally speaking, the older geological strata and the hard igneous 
and crystalline rocks are the most favourable to cryptogams.
This is 
well shown at Charnwood Forest, in Leicestershire — a tract a few miles 
square, where the old slate and granite rocks rise to the surface in 
the midst of the new red sandstone plain, forming hills with jagged 
outline like mountains in miniature, though only 800 feet high ; 
these yield an abundant cryptogamic flora, including many alpine 
species.
Dr. Lindsay says, however, that in Scotland comparatively 
few lichens are found on the basalt rocks.
I have not seen enough 
of basalt rocks to confirm or disprove this statement, but on the 
whinstone of Teesdale and the somewhat similar serpentine at the 
Lizard lichens are very abundant.* In the district where I used to 
live, where a great range of strata occurred within a small compass, 
I noticed that the calcareous oolitic rocks yielded more mosses and 
lichens than the chalk, and the carboniferous limestone than the 
oolites.
With sandy strata the rule does not appear to hold good ; 
the old red sandstone did not in Somerset yield more than the upper 
green sand ; and here the new red sandstone tracts are not nearly 
so rich in cryptogams as the alluvial sandy heaths.
The influence of the chemical composition of the soil upon 
the terrestrial cryptogamic flora is quite as marked as upon the 
flowering plants ; for instance, some kinds eschew lime, others 
require it ; and an old thatched roof in a calcareous district, or a 
limestone wall in a non-calcareous district, will often yield species 
not found elsewhere in the neighbourhood.
The classification of 
soils which I believe to be best for botanical purposes, is — 1.
Igneo- 
metamorphic, as granite, slate, &c.
; 2.
calcareous ; 3.
clayey ; 
4. sandy ; and 5.
peaty, with intermediate varieties.
Each of these 
classes of soil is marked by the presence or absence of particular 
species of cryptogamia ; but this is a wide subject, and I must leave 
it for another occasion.
* Those who have seen Mr. Brett's beautiful picture, "The Cornish Lions," in tke 
Royal Academy Exhibition of 1878 will remember the rich orange colour of the 
cliffs : due to the thick tapestry of orange lichen (Parmelia parietina) with which 
they are covered.
52 
The Naturalist.
Local conditions favourable to the growth of cryptogamic vegeta- 
tion are — moisture, the presence of decaying vegetable matter, and 
the absence of undue competition of the higher plants.
These 
conditions are met with on wet sandy heaths, and in moist woods, 
hence such places usually abound with mosses, lichens, and fungi.
Mosses and lichens, as I have said, shrivel up when dry, and revive 
with moisture ; when dry, all vital processes are of course suspended, 
consequently the more frequent or constant the supply of water, the 
more luxuriant, cotteris paribus, will be the growth.
The decaying 
vegetable matter no doubt furnishes them with an ample supply of 
carbonic acid.
Mosses and lichens " object to smoke," not on account 
of the carbonic acid, but of the sulphuric and hydrochloric acids 
which it contains.
They will always be found much more plentiful 
on the roofs of farm buildings than on those of dwelling-houses ; in 
one case they are poisoned by the soot and smoke, in the other they 
are nourishei by the decaying dust from straw, &c., which lodges on 
the roof.
Old thatch roofs are especially favourite places.
Mosses are usually the first vegetation which springs up on new 
soil, as freshly exposed rock surfaces sand and mortar, from which 
the seeds of other weeds are absent, and they serve an important use 
in such situations by forming the first thin layer of vegetable mould, 
in which plants of a higher grade following them can take root.
The 
mosses which first appear in such situations are minute annual kinds, 
which appear in abundance the first year, but soon die out, either 
from requiring a fresh soil year by year, or through being stifled by 
the growth of more robust plants.
Some mosses exhibit tastes for which there is no accounting : thus 
one genus, Splachnum, is only found on decaying animal substances 
in mountainous situations ; the hat of a traveller lost on the Alps has 
been found covered with one of these mosses.
A very common moss, 
F/iiiaria hygrometrka, loves anything that has been burnt, and is 
abundant on cinder paths, burnt heathy ground, brick walls, and mortar.
I never but once found it on a tree, and that had been charred.
These idiosyncrasies are still more marked in the case of the fungi ; 
a great number of the smaller species have their own special pabulum, 
upon the presence or absence of which their occurrence depends, 
rather than upon geographical and climatic conditions.
Many of the 
parasitic leaf fungi grow only on the leaves of a single species, or 
species belonging to one genus : the habitats of some other fungi are 
still more curious ; thus, Onygena equina grows on decaying hoofs of 
Parsons : Flowerless Plants and their Habitats.
53 
horses, the Torruhice on chrysalides of insects buried in the ground, 
Zasmidimn cellare forms the " cobweb " on old port wine bottles, &c, A 
good many mosses are aquatic, but none I believe grow habitually in 
salt water.
Some mosses, and more lichens, prefer rocks near the 
sea, and the common yellow lichen Parmelia parietina may be found 
growing on rocks quite down to high-water mark, and indeed (as I 
have seen) at a lower level than the upper limit attained by the sea- 
weeds Fiicus serratiis and canaliculatus.
The geographical distribution 
of the seaweeds will no doubt yield interesting results, but my oppor- 
tunities for observing these plants have been so few, that I am unable 
to say anything about their favourite places of grow;th.
The fresh- 
water algge, like the fungi, depend for their occurrence chiefly upon 
the presence of a suitable medium.
The most elegant forms are found 
in clear springs and mountain streamlets ; these are attached and 
branched.
The unattached filamentous confervoid species abound in 
stagnant waters ; much sewage pollution however destroys them.
Other kinds grow on damp ground, and a few are peculiar to mineral 
springs, as those of Bath and Harrogate.
It is an interesting question to raise, How comes it that we find 
special and peculiar habitats to be inhabited by special and peculiar 
species 1 Several different answers may be suggested, each of which 
may hold good in some instances, but not in others.
In the case of 
the lower algas and fungi, it is very probable that many of these 
peculiar species, as they appear to be, are really only forms of other 
commoner kinds, modified by the peculiar circumstances of their 
place of growth — " varietates loci." In some instances, as the alpine 
mosses on boulders in the plains, they may have been transported by 
some means from the situations in which they usually occur ; in other 
cases they may be outliers holding their ground under special favourable 
circumstances amid the changed physical conditions which have altered 
the character of the surrounding flora.
In not a few cases the answer 
must, I believe, be that the spores of such species (which we must 
remember are produced in vast numbers), aro frequently present in 
the .atmosphere, but that it is only very rarely that they happen to 
fall on good ground and germinate.
" Spontaneous generation " and 
" special creation " are other answers which may be, and have been, 
suggested ; but I have already trespassed too long upon your patience, 
and have neither time nor inclination to enter upon these vexed 
questions^ 
HABITS AND BREEDING OF MICRO-LEPIDOPTERA.* 
By J.
H. The ELF ALL.
Before entering upon this subject, a few general remarks on the 
observation and collection of micro-lepidoptera may not be out of place.
It has been objected by collectors of the larger species that the minute 
size and obscure habits of the micros place a too great difficulty in the 
way, especially of those whose time for study is limited.
I venture to 
say that this difficulty exists principally in the minds of those who 
say so ; and that even if it be true, that we should find in the fact 
itself reason sufficient for the increasing array of micro-] epidopterists 
throughout the country, and in no part of England are there better 
materials to be found for making excellent observers and manipulators 
than in this manufacturing district of Lancashire, where men's daily 
occupation compels them to think as well as labour — to use their heads 
in combination with their hands.
Also it is trae that as the organic forms of life become smaller, they 
are more abundant, and whereas in the case of the Sphingidee a few 
larvae only will generally be found feeding on a single tree, a nut leaf 
has been known to afford sustenance to more than a dozen of Nepticula 
microthenella.
The variety of habit and manner of feeding is quite as great as 
amongst the Macros, and the interest of the study will not be decreased 
by the reasonable hope of more frequent and interesting discoveries.
The trees which yield the most prolific harvest appear to be the 
birch, willow, oak, and thorn ; and during the months of May, July, 
and October fche first-named in favoured localities actually swarms 
with larvae feeding in the most diverse ways.
Small sheltered trees or 
low branches near the trunk afford chosen residences for the several 
species of birch-feeding Nepticulce and Lilhocolldes — the former indica- 
ting their presence to the eye "by narrow tracks in the leaf filled with 
excrement, or in a wider blotch.
The larvae may be seen by holding the 
leaf up towards the sky, and their operations whilst eating away the 
parenchyma of the leaf between the outside sheaths is extremely inter- 
esting under a lens.
The large family of Lithocolletes feed in a some- 
what similar manner, but the leaf is drawn together so as to give it a 
wrinkled or puckered appearance.
Once having become familiar with 
these the smallest objects, where none are large, all difficulty with 
regard to size vanishes ; the only one which remains is that common to

55 
the student of the larger species, viz., the invincible desire for conceal- 
ment manifested by these defenceless creatures.
I well remember some years ago the length of time occupied in 
searching for larvae of EidopJiasia messiugiella ; although told by Mr.
Hodgkinson the exact place, time, and plant on which he first dis- 
covered this insect, it was two springs before one day, whilst ruminating 
discontentedly on my ill luck, and meditating a final retreat, I observed 
a minute black bit of excrement on a leaf of Cardamines amara.
The 
bud above appeared just opening to the warmth of the spring sun- 
shine ; closer scrutiny discovered a single band of silk spun from one 
leaf tip to another, and on pressure a light green active larva backed 
out and dropped into the water below.
The sensations of that moment 
those who have succeeded after repeated disappointment will best 
understand ; and they will also appreciate the sentiment that without 
difficulty there would be no pleasure in success.
To attain this object 
of concealment, and still to carry out the double design of nature — of 
perpetuating their own existence and of keeping in due bounds the 
exuberance of vegetation — they have recourse to a variety of expedients.
A simple catalogue of their mode of feeding is as follows : — In shoots ; 
in cases ; on and in seeds ; in decayed wood ; in webs ; and as men- 
tioned above, in mines in leaves and grasses.
Shoot feeders.
— In spring, stirred by the all-powerful influence of 
heat, the eggs laid last summer by several families, especially of the 
GelecJiid(S, produce their inmates, which at once enclose themselves in 
the young and fast expanding buds sprouting from each tree and bush.
Signs of their presence are not wanting in brown -ness of their shoots, 
or even by the delay in opening caused by the internal web of the 
larva, and in some cases by an unnatural twist so marked as to form a 
right angle with the stem.
In cases.
— Others feed in cases of various colours, shapes, and sizes, 
according as the leaf out of which they are made is large or more or 
less thick and intensely veined.
The architect is always the insect 
itself, and no time or labour is lost, as the sheaths of the leaf from 
which the parenchyma has been first stripped and eaten are at once 
economised.
Such are Coleophoroe, whose habits in the perfect state 
are most retiring, thus forming a marked contrast to their larval state^ 
their presence then may be always detected by the yellow blotches, 
under which a case is sticking at right angles to the leaf.
The Psychidoe 
are another case-bearing family, but their homes are formed from 
lichens or grass stems, adorned in the most singular manner by remains 
of beetles, flies, &c., which form a part of their food.
56 
The Naturalist.
On seeds, many insects of various families pass the earlier stages of 
their existence ; of such are ColeopJiora Melilotella, which bores into 
the husks of melilot seed and uses it as a case afterwards, adding 
others until it is full fed ; and Olcopliora flavimaculella^ which webs 
together the ripe heads of Angelica sylvestris, and is very commonly 
distributed.
In decayed or sound wood, a few species feed.
C. Linneella boring 
into the bark of limetrees in the south, is an example of this class.
As 
miners in grass, mention must be made of the Elachistoe, on account of 
their interesting habit of feeding inside the blades of even the narrowest 
grasses, and it was a puzzle to me how the larva of Elachista trisena- 
tella existed at all under the apparent pressure it underwent in the 
minute Festuca ovina.
These insects also in the pupa state take up a 
position under a blade of grass and in the hollow side of it, and a single 
silken cord passed around keeps them in their place until the moment 
of their last transformation.
Li\dng gregariously in webs which occasionally extend over several 
branches of spindle or thorn trees, the small but beautiful family of 
the Ypometidoe pursue their- devastating labours unharmed by the 
attack of birds, and but little interrupted by attentions from the more 
dangerous family of ichneumons.
(To he continued.) 
ON PRESpRYING ilOSSES.
By C.
p. Hobkip.k, F.L.S.
The following remarks have been suggested by one of the later 
paragraphs in Mr.
"West's paper on Mosses, {Xaturali&t Vol. iv, p.
18).
There may be much to recommend the process there described, but 
I think there are better ways of preserving mosses than the one 
suggested.
Mr. West's method, too is open to at least one great 
objection: mosses when dry are very brittle, and by being kept 
loosely dried in paper bags, they will be seriously liable, even when 
carefully handled, of being broken up ; leaf-tips, capsules, calyptra, 
in fact almost every part will be almost certainly more or less injured 
by being turned over in the manner suggested by Mr. West.
I know 
from practical experience, the annoyance it is, when wishing to 
examine a dried specimen preserved (?) in this manner, to find 
scarcely a perfect leaf on a whole tuft, capsules reduced to powder, 
and the earthy matter which must frequently be gathered with the 
mosses, dusting the whole specimen and mixed up with the tufts so as 
HoBKiRK : On Peeserving Mosses.
57 
to render them perfectly useless ; with the smaller mosses such as 
Seligeria, &c., this method must eventually destroy them.
A far better method is the one I have long employed, which is a 
slight modification of that in practice at the Kew Herbarium, British 
Museum, and I believe all the large Herbaria.
The specimens when gathered, instead of being left to dry loose in 
the open air, should be dried in the same manner as flowering plants, 
between sheets of bibulous paper and not squeezed too hard.
In 
most instances this is easy enough, as in many of the Hypnoid group, 
where the plants merely require to bo laid flat between the sheets ; in 
others however which grow in dense tufts as Didymodon, Tortula, 
&c., or in cushions as Grimmia, before putting them in the press, I 
take a sharp long-bladed knife, and cut the cushion or tuft into thin 
sections right through its length ; in this manner a fair idea of the 
habit of growth of the plant is conveyed, and it is thin enough to be 
pressed without being crushed out of shape.
In Dicranum and other 
genera where the tufts are loosely coherent they may be separated into 
little bundles for drying, which will equally preserve the habits of them.
When the specimens are dried ready for the herbarium, take a 
sheet (double) of foolscap or other convenient size, and of moderate 
stoutness, and write the name of the genus and species (with a 
reference number) either on the top or bottom left hand corner ; on 
the inner (third) page, a number of small pockets may be gummed, 
made of various sizes to suit the size of the specimen, and into each 
pocket specimens from one locality only should be placed, and either 
on the pocket itself, or immediately below or above it, write the 
name of the gatherer, the locality, date, &c., or if the specimen have 
been sent ready dried with a ticket along with it containing these 
details, gum on the ticket instead.
The sheet should contain only 
one species, but if more specimens are obtained than would fill the 
sheet, another half sheet of same size may be easily placed inside 
with more pockets of specimens.
Each species being thus placed 
within a separate sheet, the sheets should then be all placed inside 
a somewhat larger and stronger coloured sheet, with the name of the 
genus written outside at a similar corner to the specific name of the 
inside sheet.
The sheets of genera may then be placed in their several 
families, as shown in the Lond.
Cat. of Brit.
Mosses ; each family 
being placed in a sheet which will entirely cover it up^ both ends and 
sides, to keep out dust, &c., and tied round with tape, which is much 
better than string, as it lies flat and does not cut.
The name and 
number of the family should then be written large (in same corner) 
58 
The Naturalist.
outside these sheets, with a list of genera contained in it, and a 
convenient number of these family groups maj then be placed 
between two sheets of millboard, and tied down to keep them from 
rubbing.
I need not dilate on the advantages of this method, a little thought 
will indicate them to any student.
It may take up a little more time, 
but it is well worth it, and if once adopted will not readily be changed 
— at least I think so.
As it would not be easy to write out a method 
of making the pockets named, I shall be glad to send a specimen of 
them to any one who may desire it, along with any other information 
required, on receipt of a stamped envelope.

— That rare and interesting little 
bird, the grasshopper warbler {Salicaria locustella) was found breeding 
rather plentifully with us^last spring ; I have found several nests con- 
taining either eggs or young Another was reported as having been found 
in the same locality, which contained five eggs, one of which I was so 
fortunate as to obtain.
The nests were constructed chiefly of dried grass, 
loosely put together, and were concealed in small evergreens.
They were 
all in the vicinity of water.
I also found a nest, containing eggs, of the 
grey wagtail (Motacilla hoariila) on Adel Moor.
I am glad to say that this 
bird, which is somewhat rare in this district, reared its young in safety.
The hooded crow {Corvus comix) was re^Dorted to have bred near Gledhow 
last spring.
The reporter, on whose authority I can safely rely, caught 
the bird while faithfully fulfilling the duties of incubation.
This is 
worthy of special notice, as the hooded crow seldom breeds inland, pre- 
ferring the cliffs of the sea-coast, where its nest is placed on a ledge of 
rock or on some stunted tree which presents a favourable site for its 
construction.
It seldom breeds in England, though not uncommon with 
us in winter, but in the north of Scotland it is a permanent resident

throughout the year.
Several large flocks of swallows were observed on 
the 4th October and for several preceding weeks, flying south-eastwards.
It has been very interesting to watch them collecting together in the 
vicinity of the river Aire, preparatory to their migratory flight to a 
wai mer climate, to return no more until next spring.
Mr. John Grass- 
ham tells me that he noticed small parties of swallows, perhaps three or 
four in number, at Gledhow, on the 13th instant.
Kingfishers and dippers 
have again returned to their favourite haunts at Roundhay Park, where 
formerly they bred along with other and still rarer birds.
No doubt they 
would still do so, were they not disturbed by the public.

Acherontia Atropos at Goole.
— Mr. Bunker, of Goole, informs me that 
an unusual number of the death's-head hawk moth (Acherontia Atropos) 
has occurred in the district.
Mr. B.
possessed two specimens, and 
reports five or six others.
Such a quantity I believe merits notice.

reported as new to West Yorkshire in your October issue.
Having had 
specimens brought me from two localities near York, namely, Butter- 
crambe in 1877, Tilmire Se^Dt. 28th, 1878, it seems worth while to men- 
tion the fact, in case it should be fresh also to this district.

Seligeria tristiclia in England.
— In answer to Mr. Wesley's enquiry 
about my having detected the above moss at Castleton, I beg to inform 
him that I have every reason to believe that the* statement in Schimper's 
Synopsis is a mistake, as I have no knowledge of having gathered it any- 
where before I gathered it in Yorkshire in June last.
I may also add 
that I know of several other gross errors with reference to personal 
authorities in Schimper's Synopsis, which in my opinion render an other- 
wise valuable work very unreliable.
I have made two special journeys to 
Castleton this year, but I have only found ISeligeria pusilla and Ayiodus 
Bonnianus.
Myself and Mr. Ashton found the moss {8.
tristiclia) on 
shady dripping limestone rocks near Litton, Yorkshire, on the 15th of 
June, 1878.
On the same rock we also gathered Seligeria pusilla and S.
recurvata.
— J.
Whitehead.
Js Seligeria tristiclia new to England or not 1 — As I recorded the 
discovery of Mr. Whitehead's Littondale moss as " new" to England in 
August, perhaps I may as well reply to the query on page 39 of last 
month's number.
The drift of the query is to show the inaccuracy of the 
words " new to England." When I wrote them, however, I did so on 
the best possible authority, viz., that of Mr. Whitehead himself !
I quoted 
his own statement — a remarkable one if he had previously found it in 
Derbyshire.
In Mr. Whitehead's letter (written last July), asking me to 
verify and notice his discovery, he himself says, " A moss not only new 
60 
The Naturalist.
to Yorkshire, but I believe new to England." So, then, Mr. Whitehead 
was, last July, unaware of any Castleton locality, and if he had found the 
moss before, it is inconceivable that he should have forgotten so rare a 
fact in regard to so characteristic a moss.
Prof.
Schimper may have 
detected S.
tristicJia amongst some other moss sent, unknowingly, from 
Castleton by Mr. Whitehead, but it is curious that his name should be 
quoted when he, the quoted one, knows nothing of it.

Barnsley Naturalists' Society.
— Meeting October Ist.
— The first 
lecture of the series proposed to be given monthly was delivered by the 
presidejit, Mr. T.
Lister, on Spring Migrants." The observations of 
birds up to the present date not yet reported in the Naturalist are : latest 
record made to us of departing migrants are, Sept.
7, swift and young 
whinchat, seen by Dr. Payne ; 15th, sand martin ; 24th, willow wren 
noted, but IMr. Talbot reported this and sand-martin Oct. 7th ; Oct. 2nd, 
the wheatear, seen by G.
Scholey : 16th, swallows and martins yet seen 
at Monk Bretton Abbey ; some pairs have had two or three broods.
I 
. heard the redstart sing so late as Sept.
13, a later date than I have known.
Of rarer birds seen were crossbills at Darfield, Sept.
10th ; a flock of 25 
wild geese at Stainborough Park, on the 15th Sept.
and some days after- 
wards ; also Canada geese on the pools.
Carrion crows, scarce here, 
noted on the 21st and 28th ; 15 herons seen by Dr. Payne at Colwick, 
and several by Mr. C.
Wemyss, Cannon Hall Park.
Oct. 3, fifty gulls 
were seen flying to south-west ; 11th, one tern seen at Smithies Water 
Works.

Meeting, Oct. 15th, Mr. lUingworth in the chair.
— Mr. Spence read a 
paper on the spiracles of insects, profusely illustrated by microscopical 
preparations diagrams and the blackboard.
Mr. Carter shewed, .on behalf 
of Messrs.
E, P.
P. and J.
A. Butterfield, Orthosia lota and macilenta — 
both new to the district record list ; Mr. Hop wood, Agrotis suffusa from 
the Bradford district.
— Wm. West, Sec, 
C-looLE Scientific Society.
— The last excursion of the present year 
was made Sept.
20th, to Haxey, in the Isle of Axholme.
The main body 
of the party left Goole by the 12-52 train, arriving at half-past two at 
Haxey station, where they were met by the Pev. W.
Fowler, who had 
previously been over the ground about Laughton, Ferry Flash and 
Owston, and by some other members who had gone by an earlier train to 
Stainforth, and walked across Hatfield Moor and by Wroot to Haxey.
The party then walked to Haxey village, and thence to Skier's Flash and 
" the tm-fery," a strip of unreclaimed wet, sandy, and peaty ground where 
many interesting plants occur.
Haxey itself, a large straggling village, is 
situate on a low hill, standing out of the fenny plain like an island out of 
62 
The Naturalist.
water, which indeed the name, " Isle of Axholme," shows that it has once 
actually been.
The hill is composed of the variegated red and green marl 
of the triassic series, but covered up first by a gravel made up of frag- 
ments of the marl, and above that by a bed of yellow alluvial sand.
Islets of new red sandstone, capped as usual with a gravel bed, occur at 
Hatfield, Hatfield Woodhouse, and Wroot.
The alluvial strata, which 
form the flat ground between these hillocks, are similar to those about 
Goole ; the warp, however, is only found near the Trent, and west of 
Haxey the peat is the uppermost bed, hence the surface soil in the fields 
is black, as in the fen district of Cambridgeshire.
On Hat'field Moor the 
peat bed attains a great depth, as on Thorne Waste.
The forest bed is 
found under the peat on Hatfield Moor, and as far at least as Haxey ; the 
remains of many large trees were seen in the ditches.
Under the peat are 
sand and laminated clay, as at Goole.
In one place near Haxey the loose 
sand was blown by the wind into a hillock, like the dunes on the coast.
The fen land is drained by large dykes which run in pairs, the water in 
the two baing at different levels, the low level dyke is for the drainage of 
such lands as lie too low to get a natural outfall, and the water has to be 
lifted by engines at pumping stations.
Owing partly to the wide extent 
of ground covered during the day, in spite of the lateness of the season, 
a large number of plants were observed, several being of very uncommon 
kinds ; the total number of flowering plants was 308, considerably more 
than at any previous excursion of the society.
The flora of Hatfield Moor 
closely resembled that of Thorne Waste, with which it was no doubt 
formerly continuous.
The white beak-sedge and the Andromeda, so 
characteristic of the Goole moors, occurred there, but only the common 
species of sundew were seen.
The flora of the turfery at Haxey more 
resembled that of Riccall Common, though differing by the presence of 
some species and the absence of others.
Among the more interesting 
plants found during the excursion were Cladium mariscus, a large sedgy 
plant with tough saw-Hke leaves ; Peiicedanum palustre, now becoming 
very scarce through the drainage of the fen districts ; and Utricnlaria 
vulgaris, an aquatic plant with finely-cut leaves, buoyed up in the water 
by a number of air bladders.
A good many mosses and fungi were seen.
Four or five well-marked brambles were plentifully met with, and it was 
noticed that the fruit of each species " or " variety " — whichever it may 
be called of this puzzled genus of plants — possessed a distinct and easily- 
recognised flavour.
Few birds were seen during the day, and nothing was 
done in the other branches of zoology.

— Meeting October 11th, Mr. G.
T. 
Porritt, president, in the chair.
— Mr. C.

Lancashire and Cheshire Entomological Society.
— Monthly 
meeting Sept.
30th, Mr. S.
J. Capper, president, in the chair.
A paper 
was read by Mr. Ellis on "Darwinism: its relation to Entomology." 
The president, in his remarks on the paper, stated he had just received 
from the author, Mr. H.
Goss, F.L.S., F.G.S., a work which he held in 
his hand, entitled " The Insect Fauna of the Recent and Tertiary 
Periods." Mr. Goss invited the attention of geologists to the importance 
of an acquaintance with the insect fauna of former times ; the study of 
their remains, he considered, was of the greatest value in assisting at the 
arrival of just conclusions as to the geological condition of the earth in 
past ages.
The president drew attention to the second part, just 
published, of Mr. Mosley's Illustrations of Lepidoptera Varieties, and 
congratulated the members that out of 17 figured, six of the originals were 
in the possession of members of the society.
Several exhibits were made, 
amongst which were — by Mr. Ellis, two live specimens of genus Blatta ; 
Mr. West, three lively pupse of A.
atropos, found a few miles from 
Liverpool.

HABITS AND BREEDING OF MICRO-LEPIDOPTEEA, 
By J.
H. Threlfall.
(Concluded.) 
It is a little curious to observe that those larvae which feed the most 
exposed in sunlight should engross so little of the notice of these their 
most determined enemies.
It may be on account of their slightly- 
hairy appearance, or perhaps it may be surmised that hidden and 
poisonous qualities exist, against the use of which Nature has placed 
the unerring guide of instinct.
Having thus noticed in a very sketchy manner some of the more 
general modes of feeding pursued by the micro-lepidoptera, it will next 
be advisable in a few words to say what is the best plan of saving their 
life, and eventually in a state of artificial confinement to produce from 
the immature stages of larva and pupa the more perfect and beautiful 
form of the imago.
And in this, as in other sciences in which Nature 
is our teacher, it will be found best to follow her example as closely as 
possible, and to preserve in temperature, in moisture, and in exclusion 
of all causes of disturbance, those conditions which are the most favour- 
able in a wild state ; here will be the difficulty to all except those who 
have plenty of room, good air, and light.
For in every instance where 
a new larva is met with, to make sure of bringing it to its perfect state 
it will be found the best to take the plant on which it feeds, and let all 
grow together in a flower-pot, over which glass or gauze should be 
placed to prevent escape.
In this way I have eight larvse of Goleophora 
Wockeella feeding on Betonica officinalis ; they are exposed in the 
garden, and at one time during the winter the pot was completely 
covered with a drift of snow.
Of course only rare larvae need be 
treated this way, as the others may be bred with less risk of a 
good result in other ways.
In the case of trees such as the oak being 
the food-plant, small twigs placed in a bottle and kept in a cool place 
out of doors, will be found to answer.
The Coleophorae are so difficult 
to rear in any other way, that it is by far the best to adopt one of these 
plans, and not to trust to those mentioned later.
For the shoot-feeders, if care be taken to slightly dry the leaves, a 
fair proportion of insects may be bred by placing the larvae in jam pots 
or flower pots whose rims have been rubbed level to admit of their 
being covered by a closely-fitting piece of glass.
These should be 
looked at every day, and shaken up so that damp and mould may be 
kept at a distance, as these are the greatest dangers to guard against.
N. S., Vol. iv., Dec, 1878.
The Naturalist.
All the Psychidoe and Coleophor(s require light and air, so that with 
them gauze should be used instead of glass ; and in some cases of seed 
feeders which hybemate, it is a good plan to place them in bags with 
the food-plant, and hang them out of doors all winter out of the way of 
rats and mice.
But the way of breeding which appears to be almost 
peculiar to the small fry is one used by all the old collectors, and 
which was strongly recommended to me by Mr. Sang, of Darlington, 
who has prosecuted the method most successfully.
He uses tubes of 
glass about Gin. long by 1 Jin. wide, such as the chimney of an argand 
lamp, places the larvae with the leaf inside rolled up in very soft paper, 
and corks up both ends.
The leaves must not be wet, nor must the 
tubes be left in the sun, but in a cool place out of doors, and the 
difficulty to be solved is to keep away either mould or excessive 
dryness.
This last plan is especially suited to the most minute forms, 
such as the Lithocelletes and Nepticuloe, which complete their larval 
existence on a single leaf, and when full-fed spin an oval cocoon of 
various colours on the paper.
And here it may be useful to repeat a remark which the same gentle- 
man made to me that the summer brood of larvee — viz., those feeding 
in June and July — never produce a tithe of imagos, and had better be 
left entirely alone, as in autumn they appear again, and can then be 
kept and bred successfully.
In spring also avoid tin boxes as perma- 
nent cages, although they serve very well as temporary prisons whilst 
away in the country.
These are some of the ways, and will probably be already known to 
many, of breeding the micro-lepidoptera.
They are used also in 
breeding the macros, and in mentioning them I can only plead the old 
but valid excuse of wishing to arouse, or to fan into bright flame, that 
earnest interest in the secrets of nature which makes the recollections 
of our past life happy, and may produce in the future, discoveries which 
shall benefit the distant generations of men.
.For Nature allows to size 
no priority ; her woiks, whether in the shape of distant suns or minute 
organisms such as the Bacteria of Tyndall, are of equal value and 
importance.
Neglecting nothing, but observing everything, let each man join the 
ever-increasing army of workers, determined to push on to the best of 
his ability that glorious time when ignorance shall be the exception, 
when to see shall be to know : thus fulfilling the undying though 
ancient dream of poets and philosaphers when peace and plenty shall 
be permanent, and the nations shall rejoice in wealth more precious 
and exhaustless than the far-famed land of gold.

LIST OF THE LAND AND FEESH WATER MOLLUSCA 
OF HULL AND VICINITY.
By J.
D. BUTTERELL.
The following list, wMcli is the result of several seasons' collecting, 
must not be considered as an absolutely exhaustive one, and further 
research will no doubt add some of the numerous varieties, as well 
perhaps as such species as Ancylus fluviatilis, Helix rufescens^ and 
Cochlicopa tridens^ at present conspicuous by their absence.
The district explored is chiefly the low-lying country in the imme- 
diate neighbourhood of Hull, with some places in Holderness ; Hessle, 
Brough, Brantingham, Welton and Slddby, which are situated on the 
chalk on a range of hills bounding the district on the west.
The river 
Hull, several canals, and numerous wide drains supply a home for 
the aquatic species.
Leven canal, commencing at Leven, runs through 
a dark soil of somewhat peaty texture for a .distance of three miles, 
and joins the Hull near Beverley.
The Barmston drain, which begins 
at BaiTQston, between Hornsea and Bridlington, traverses the county 
in a south-west direction, going through Beverley to Hull ; where 
quoted, the part within three miles of Hull is generally alluded to.
Spring Dyke (which is so prolific in individuals that its surface is in 
some parts quite brown with numbers of FlanorUs spirorbis) runs from 
the waterworks at Springhead to Hull.

WHITBY.- 
By Henry Ceowther.
Whitby, the Streonshalh (the town on the strand) of the Saxons, 
offers many agreeable changes to the inland naturalist, archaeologist, 
or even ordinary sightseer.
Approached by one of the most beautiful 
dales in Yorkshire — the vale of Pickering — on the one side, and by 
the sea on the other, one can indulge on the one hand in admiring 
the precipitous limestone escarpments, the pleasant blendings of moor 
and cultivable lands, interrupted and enlivened by extensive woods of 
larch and oak, at the foot of which meanders the Mark Esk ; or can 
view if sailing, from the south especially, an extension of Yorkshire 
coast scenery which for interest, particularly zoological, has perhaps 
no county equal.
But it is to the all-round zoologist, a student who is 
becoming commoner every day — one who, though he may have no great 
desire to become a specialist, has a craving to witness, alive if possible, 
types which form often the connecting links in the animal kingdom, 
of which the sea is the repository of the major portion, — that I com- 
mend this quiet, romantic, and interesting little seaport.
Situate where the river Esk joins the sea, with high cliffs rising 
nearly 200 feet above high water, the principal receptacle of St.
Hilda's exorcised and lapidified snakes, composed of the upper alum 
shale, &c., on the east side, which disappearing through a line of 
fault, dips under the harbour, and reappearing at the little village of 
Sandsend, some three miles westward, gives us on the west of the 
river a sandstone cliff somewhat under 100 feet high, having at its 
base an excellent expanse of sandy beach.
At the base of the high 
east cliff, which is capped with the Abbey and the Parish Church, is 
an extensive scar of liassic rock, on the face of which are visible 
innumerable Ammoniiidoe, Belemnitidoe, Ledoe, &c.
The geology of 
Whitby being proverbial, almost all visitors become students — too 
often, unfortunately, wantonly practical ones, for, armed with hammer, 
whatever they see in the form of a fossil on the scar has inflicted upon 
it such summary chastisement as to render its specific recognition a 
question of fancy.
The ladies are especially guilty, the modus operandi 
being to hit away at the object so that it will jump out of the matrix, 
and the result achieved in nine-tenths of the cases is something about 
which they care so much that they throw it away, and then (to use 
their own words) " look for something better." 
The scar discloses, when the tide is low, rock pools of varying sizes, 
miniature sea gardens and marine aquaria, lined with red and green 
74 
The Natuealist.
seaweeds, and dotted with Actinioe, especially crassicornis and mesem- 
hryanthemum.
Extending about a mile the scar reaches Saltwick 
Nab, a liassic promontory (and island at high tide) where the 
adjoining cliff is very low, due to the establishment formerly of alum 
works.
The East Pier on the east, the Nab on the west, on the south 
the precipitous cliff, and the sea stretching away to the north, form 
boundaries to a rich hunting ground.
To an earnest worker in 
zoology within and about these precincts is to be reaped a rich 
harvest.
On Saltwick Nab, where some tea gardens are established, 
are two ponds of fresh water, which at high water can be but few feet 
above its level ; near the end of one being, when we were there, a 
fishing coble drawn up out of the reach of the waves.
Yet, flavoured 
as the water must inevitably be with salty spray, Limnoea peregra is 
to be found crawling about by hundreds, and though their size is 
small they do not compare unfavourably with their congeners in 
another pool which caps the cliff at least 100 feet higher, a little 
beyond the footpath which leads from the cliff to the Nab. Here also 
were taken Dytiscus marginalis (fem.), Ilybius aier, and Gyrinus 
hicolor, the latter beetle, like the molluscs, swarming.
Descending we 
find that Ammonitidoe and Belemnitidoe abound, and that Leda ovum 
is specially abundant, and continues so to the western end of the 
limit we are considering.
Searching amongst these rocky pools on the lovely morning 
succeeding the awfully stormy day Sept.
12th, when nine vessels were 
wrecked, and Whitby beheld the stormiest day she remembered for 
ten years past, and which we partly felt as we returned from a fishing 
smack, — we found marine animals of great interest, numbers of dead 
jelly-fish, Cyaneoe, Thaumantioe, and occasionally a specimen of 
Cydippe pileus, which is plentiful off the coast : of sea-urchins, 
AmpJiidotus cordatus and Echinus sphoera.

variety is not given in Schimper's Synopsis, but is, so far as at present 
known, an American form.
It differs from tlie common form in its small 
size, dark green colour, densely i)ulvinate habit, and strongly falcate 
leaves.
Habitat : sandstone rocks, Wliarncliffe Crags.

A New British Moss {Aulacomnion turgidum).
— Perhaps it will 
interest, the readers of the Naturalist to h6ar of the discovery of 
Aulacomnion turgidum in the Breadalbane mountains.
This moss was 
gathered so far back as 1871 by Prof.
Barker, of Owen's College, but had 
laid neglected in his herbarium until a few weeks back.
Only barren 
specimens were found, but according to Schimper it has been found with 
good fruit in Norway and Lapland.
— Jno. Whitehead, Dukinfield.
— [Is 
it correct that this moss has been found in Yorkshire ?
— Eds. Nat.'] 
Seligeria tristicha at Castleton.
— With reference to the occurrence of 
Seligeria tristicha at Castleton, I recollect gathering a small barren moss 
on wet limestone rocks, ten years ago, at the above locality.
I took the 
specimens to Dr. Wood, of Manchester, and he told me it was Trichosto- 
mum tophaceum, but perhaps he afterwards sent it to Dr. Schimper, and 
he thought it was Seligeria tristicha.

Obituary.— Thomas W.
Wonfor, F.L.S.
— This gentleman, whose 
name has long been familiar to all naturalists, more especially to those 
resident in Sussex, died at 38, Buckingham Place, Brighton, on Sunday, 
the 20th October last, in the fifty-first year of his age.
Mr. Wonfor's 
entry on a public career in Brighton was made in connection with the 
Royal Literary and Scientific Institution, at the Albion Rooms, where he 
frequently lectured.
A year or two after the formation of the Brighton 
and Sussex Natural History Society in 1853, Mr. Wonfor was appointed 
an honorary secretary — a post which he occupied until the date of his 
death, and in the discharge of the duties of which he exhibited very great 
ability and energy.
It was as a microscopist that Mr. Wonfor chiefly 
distinguished himself ; and one of his papers " On certain Butterfly 
Scales characteristic of Sex," read at Brighton in November, 1867, was 
subsequently published in the eighth vol.
of the Microscopical Journal.
Besides his very numerous papers on microscopical subjects in the Pro- 
ceedings of the Brighton and Sussex Natural History Society, Mr. Wonfor 
contributed a great number of papers on almost every branch of zoology 
and botany, not only to the Proceedings of his own Society, but to those 
of other Natural History Societies in Sussex, and to various periodicals.
76 
The NA.TURALIST.
When in 1872 the British Association visited Brighton, Mr. Wonfor 
took a very active part in their proceedings, and acted as secretary to one 
of the committees.
Mr. Wonfor was appointed Curator of the Brighton 
Free Library and Museum in 1875 ; he was elected a Fellow of the 
Linnean Society in June, 1877, and a Member of the Entomological 
Society of London in February last.
He was '^also an Honorary or 
Corresponding Member of severalj.
Natural History and Microscopical 
Societies in various parts of the United Kingdom.

Barnsley Naturalists' Society.
— Meeting November 13th, T.
Lister, 
president, in the chair.
— Mr. A.
Kell, C.E., exhibited a fine case of eggs of 
British birds, commencing with birds of prey from the griffin vulture to 
the buzzards ; he accompanied this with a description of each egg, and a 
brief account of each bird, intending to continue the series throughout 
the British birds, of which he has nearly a complete collection of eggs.
Some observations on birds were made by the president, of which a 
summary is given.
The summer warblers were, with some exceptions, 
silent or not visible in the early part of autumn ; the main body appeared 
to have winged their flight to southern countries ; the returning milder 
weather caused some to stay beyond their usual time ; of these not 
Eeports of Societies.
77 
reported in the October Naturalist are the wood warbler, Sep. 10th ; the 
spotted'crake reported by W.
Talbot, near Hiendly, Sep. 1 3th, two more 
killed by telegraph wire ; the spotted fly-catcher, Sep. 22nd ; the yellow 
wagtail, Sep. 29th ; the whitethroat, Oct. 7th ; the ring-ousel, Oct. 16th ; 
the land-rail, Oct. 20 ; a swallow seen near Carr House, Masborough, 
Nov. 7th, another obtained by W.
Talbot, on the Calder, Nov. 13th ; he 
queries if we remember one so late.
I reply, no — but a brood of martins 
were seen by me, Nov. 11th, a few years back at Finder Oaks, Barnsley, 
some of which would stay a few days before finally starting southwards.
Of winter visitants we have the following records : the jack snipe, Sep.
13th, the grey wagtail, 16th : the fieldfares and redwings, Oct. 9th ; the 
brambling, Oct. 15th ; the mountain-linnet, Oct. 19th.
Of rarer birds 
we have had the haw-finch, Oct. 4th, sparrow-hawk dashing at partridges, 
seen Oct. 15th, creepers, gold-crests, cole and long-tailed tits, Oct. 25th.
Flocks of from 12 to 50 wild geese and ducks, many gulls, have passed 
over Barnsley district throughout the autumn months ; kestrels, herons, 
black-spotted woodpeckers, kingfishers, sandpipers, have been frequently 
observed in the district.

WHITBY.
By Henry Crowther.
(Concluded.) 
The torn-up seaweeds entangled the bodies of hundreds of star-fish, 
and the pools yielded the common sun-star, Solaster papposa, specimens 
having the full complement of fifteen rays not being rare ; the purple 
sun-star S.
endeca ; the eyed cribella, Gribella oculata ; lesser sand-star, 
Ophiura albida ; and the common cross-fish, Uraster ruhens, of which 
there are large quantities, chiefly noticeable at low water at the 
harbour's mouth, crawling over the mussel beds which occur at the 
foot of each pier.
Amongst the Crustacea the palm for numbers most 
certainly was earned by the Idoteadoe, which have the appearance of so 
many aquatic wood-lice, and are distinguished by having feet armed 
with pointed claws, and possessing two simple folding plates beneath 
the abdomen ; shrimps {Crangon vulgaris), small specimens of the 
great crab.
Cancer pagurus ; the dwarf swimming crab, Portunus 
pusillus; one representative of the masked crab, Corystes Cassive- 
launus (male) ; amongst mussels the pea-crab, Pinnotheres pisum ; 
and lastly, but not the least interesting, the hermit crab, Pagurus 
Bernhardus, in possession of slj^l-houses of all sizes from Nassa 
pygmoea to Buccinum undatum, and plentiful.
^ 
Nineteen species of recent mollusca, exclusive of varieties, which 
are often the species of some author or other, were obtained.
Purpura 
lapillus and Patella vulgata were so numerous that they covered yards 
of rock surface.
The latter should be well scrutinised, for at no time 
can types and their deviations be compared so advantageously as 
when an almost inexhaustible number may be examined ; in this 
case the varieties elevata, jncta, and coerulea were taken, on the fronds 
of seaweed Helclon pellacidum and its variety loevis.
This mollusc is 
easily found by searching the food-plant.
Much has been said about the depressions formed on rock surfaces 
by the continual returning to the same place of P.
vulgata ; as illus- 
trative of the same thing, we may add that in our possession is a piece 
of seaweed stalk in which is embedded a specimen of H.
pellucidum 
so deeply as to bring the apex of its shell on a level with the outer 
surface of the stalk.
These rock depressions, although occurring, are 
not as noticeable here as those seen by us at one or two places on the 
east coast of Ireland, particularly about Howth.
Whilst examining 
these, a specimen of Tectura testudinalis attracted our attention, and 
a good search resulted in eight or ten examples.
Twice were seen 
N. S., Vol. iv., Jan., 1879.
82' 
The NATURiiLisT.
Patelloe and Tecturoe in shallow basins of sea-water, crawling as if the 
bright rays of the sun torrified them, from which it was evident that 
the Patelloe travel much quicker, and cause the shell to oscillate some- 
what.
Chiton cinereus occurs about loose stones sparingly, Littorina 
rudis, L.
obtusata, and L.
littorea are well represented, some of the 
latter being large.
Both Trochus cinerarius and T.
Uneatus occur ; 
amongst the former are distributed forms varying from the flattest to 
the most conical, due to the zones it inhabits.
Whilst searching for these in one of the pools, we noticed a com- 
motion amongst these and several other molluscs which was of too 
brisk a nature for their well-known and characteristic slowness.
When the obscuring sand which they had thrown up in the fray had 
settled, we saw that the shells were principally in possession of hermit 
crabs, which under this guise were attacking a Purpura lapillus and 
dragging it from its shell.
We caught the whole school at once and 
transferred them to a collecting-bag ; the shells occupied were ]}^assa 
pi/gmoea, Trochus cinereus, Littorina littorea, three sizes, and a P.
lapillus, the sheik of the party, for he was taken red-handed.
We 
presume to think that if their object had not been frustrated, there 
would have been ere long a mutual exchange of crab's clothing.
On the west cliff, and thence towards Sandsend, we searched for 
land shells, taking Helix caperata and excellent specimens of the var.
Qvnata as abundantly as the type ; S.
pulchella and its var.
costata 
rarely.
H, sericea two taken ; H.
wirgaia, H.
rotundata, H, nemoralis, 
Cochlicopa luhrica and the var.
lubricoides, Zonites cellarius, Z.
alliariuSj 
Z. nitidulus, Z.
crystallinus, and the following coleoptera : — Badister 
hipustulatus, PterosticJms eryihropus^, Crepidodera salicarice, Apion pisij 
and Chrysomela dajphylcea.
A walk over Sneaton Moor to Falling Foss in Little Beck, six 
miles from Whitby, will repay the sightseer in scenery, or the collector 
of coleoptera, hymenoptera, or lepidoptera.
The conchologist finds 
so little that it is useless looking, but of the former order we took 
Cicindda campestris, the tiger beetle (which occurs not uncommonly), 
Geotrupes star cor arius^ G.
sylvaticus, and near a larch wood, G.
vernalisy 
Carabus catenulatus, Quedius cruentus, Aphoditis contaminatus, and several 
common forms.
At Robin Hood's Bay is another rich hunting ground^, on the out- 
skirts of which the following beetles were added : — Bembidium later ale, 
OUstJiopus rotundatus, and AncJiomenus albipes ; in a small horse-trough, 
L. peregra, the shell not large, but possessing a somewhat straight 
marginal mouth ; nothing beyond Z.
purus was added to our list of 
Crowther : Whitby.
83 
land and fresh-water shells.
The beach and the base of the cliffs will 
repay a careful search.
At Hawsker, on our way to the bay, we took 
in a large pond the var.
omta of Z.
peregra, apparently the sole occu- 
pant, as not another mollusc could be found.
On the way to Ruswarp, a pretty little village on the Esk, and 
somewhere about one mile from Whitby, we took the following fresh 
shells: — Pupa umbilicata plentifully, Succinea putris, Limncea truncatula, 
and Clausilia rugosa rarely.
The coleoptera were almost as elsewhere, 
the additions being Aphodim rufipes, Bembidmm ceneum^ Notiopliihis 
semipunctatus, and Agriotes sputator ; on our return.
Helix liortensis.
At 
the locality where the latter was taken are found both H.
nemoralis and 
Tiyhrida the variety.
The three taken in conjunction at once point to 
the beautiful pink-lipped hybrid form being an offspring of the dark- 
lipped nemoralis and the white-lipped liortemis.
From other observations 
made elsewhere this year on the same point, we are fully convinced that 
these two are the progenitors of the aptly-named hybrida.
Limax fiavus 
is abundant at Bagdale, on the outskirts of Whitby.
The river Esk (Celtic for water) yields TJnio margaritifer, the pearl- 
bearing mussel, a specimen of which, particularly to the Yorkshire con- 
chologist, is a desideratum.
The gift of a specimen gave us the desire 
to take it for ourselves.
A return ticket was taken to Egton Bridge, 
and we worked our way up Glaisdale towards Lealholm Bridge.
A 
careful search from point to point disclosed at last an indubious sign in 
the form of a piece of the black epidermis appertaining to this species.
Here we began to work.
A net is useless ; the best, in fact the only 
way to be successful is to take off shoes and stockings, roll up the 
trousers as far as possible — fastening them with straps is advantageous — 
and go into the stream.
A stout stick is necessary for support, as the 
stones are rough, and a step at times making a difference of a few inches 
or as many feet of water.
At last one was found, and an hour's searching 
brought several to light, and two hours more raised the total to over 
twenty.
We were not successful every time we essayed, but learned 
that they abound mostly about two feet from the sides, under bushes, 
and in shallow water.
The whole of the specimens were embedded 
three:quarters of their length in mud, sand, and gravel, a good pull 
usually being required to extract them.
Doubtless it is to this latter 
fact that is due the decomposition which obtains on the umboes, as from 
their oblique position having the anterior end buried, the ventral edge 
uppermost, with a gape of about three-eighths of an inch displaying the 
edges of the mantle, and the posterior end well pointed up stream, the 
umbonal region when the shell recUnes thus, must rest in the deepest

stratum, which is apparent every time a specimen is withdrawn to 
black mud.
Some of the older shells — subject, there is no doubt, to 
years of this lazy, quiet life, — are very deeply corroded, ofttimes two- 
thirds the thickness of the shell.
Some, too, had attached to them young 
living specimens of L.
peregra and Ancylus Jluviatilis.
The var.
sinuata 
occurs sparingly.
Compared with typical shells taken out of the river 
Dhoe, Isle of Man, the whole series taken are somewhat sinuous.
We 
searched on cleaning, for pearls, dreaming not to take gems, but desiring 
to realise for ourselves their occurrence, and we were successful, if finding 
four distorted partly spherical pieces of nacre can be called pearls.
Two 
were about one-eighth of an inch in diameter, and the others half that 
size ; one was found laid within the shell as if held in position by the 
exterior surface of the mantle.
The other three were taken from one 
exceedingly old specimen, and were attached, — embedded would be the 
better word, strange as it may seem, and still does to us, — on the right 
posterior adductor muscle.
The scenery of Glaisdale is most beautiful ; the dale, Egton Bridge, 
and Arnclifife Woods, exclusive of the conchological treasures, would 
repay the visitor.
Whilst returning towards the woods we took but two 
species of land shells, H.
Jdspida and S.
rotundata ; but in coleoptera, 
besides Philonthus hitermediiis, we fortunately captured two exceedingly 
small specimens of Anchomemis prasinus ; we are as yet unable to find 
any special mention being made of this variety.
Compared with the 
type, it is but half size.
One word more.
Knowing that the easy-chair naturalist, callous to 
the charms of personal collecting, asks, when he reads articles dealing 
thus with nature — " Has anything fresh been tendered, and what is its 
use ?' we feel tempted to answer ; but as he deems only his own cribbed 
effusions valuable, we leave him to ruminate upon them, and turn to 
those of OUT own way of thinking, whose name is legion, and aptly say, 
here is partly sketched a locality rich enough to repay careful working, 
for, from a fourteen days' stay we have put forth the fullest record of 
the occurrence and other particulars concerning H.
margaritifer as found 
in our Yorkshire Esk ; given prominence to a probably new variety 
amongst the despised, because so common, Anclwmentis jprasims ; we 
next claim to be the first to publish the occurrence of Tectura testudinalis 
in Yorkshire ; that it is indigenous in our county is therefore settled, and 
its southern limit extended from Hartlepool somewhere near forty miles, 
and if from a dead shell found by us in Robin Hood's Bay we may 
venture to predict its being found there, that limit must be extended six 
miles more.
Again, we claim still another record.
Hitherto the fact

that the hermit crab destroyed the living mollusc so that it might appro- 
priate its shell, has rested upon the testimony of trustworthy fishermen : 
we deem ourselves fortunate in having seen it, learning this latter fact 
but a few days ago ; and lastly, we feel we have fulfilled a duty in giving 
this exposition of the charms of a place situate in our own county.
With Pliny we exclaim — " Verily, for mine own part, the more I looke 
into Nature's workes, the sooner am I induced to beleeve of her even 
those things that seem incredible."

OBSERVATIONS CONCERNING THREE NEW WEST 
YORKSHIRE MOSSES.
By F.
Arnold Lees, F.L.S.
I HAVE pleasure in reporting the discovery of three new mosses, two of 
them new to Britain— in a sense at least, since their names do not appear 
in any catalogue of British mosses as yet published.
They are Ortho- 
IricJimi rupestre, Schleich.
; Atilacomiiinm targid^tm.^ Schpr.
• and Fonti- 
nalis gracilis, Lindb.
Let us consider them seriatim.
I. Ortfiotrichum rupedre, Schleich.
Until last month this ranked as 
dinincognit in the MS.
moss flora of the Riding now in course of compo- 
sition by the printers, since the only record was one of Dr. Carrington's, 
and that admittedly doubtful, viz : " I think I collected one tuft near 
Ingleborough in lfe57 1" for the plant recorded in Baiues' Flora of 1840 
as rupestre from near Bolton Bridge, was afterwards ascertained to be a 
form of 0.
haxatile, Brid..
then known as 0.
anoih alum of Bry. Brit.
In 
August last, however, Mr. W.
West and myself made an excursion to 
Whernside fur the purpose of investigating the altitudinal range of our 
sub-alpine mosses, and amongst the mosses we found this 0.
rupedre 
occurred.
Mr. H.
Boswell has verified the name.
It was growing on 
high exposed rocks at about 2,300 to 2400 feet {i.e. the summit ridge), 
with Racomitrium helerodichum var.
alopecurim, 
II.
Aulacomnium turgidum, Schimp.
— This moss was one of the fifty 
uota*ble species gathered by Mr. West and myself on Whernside, in the 
excursion already alluded to.
We did not recognise it at the time — 
indeed we gathered only one tuft of it (matted with Sphagnwn papillosnm\ 
and that, as nearly as I can recollect, on the north-east slope of the 
mountain, ascending the shoulder by Great Blake Gill frt^m Dentdale 
head.
I remember picking it, and saying to my companion, Aulacom- 
nimn'paludre ^Vl^ Sphagnum rigidum^"' and he acquiescing, the tuft was

consigned to the common bag (carrii d by West, in which fact I rejoiced, 
as it grew very heavy before we'd done !
) which held our gatherings.
It 
was not recognised until I sent Mr. Boswell a sample of several of the 
things we had found.
With regard to the aspect of the slope where 
found, it is a curious coincidence — unknown to me until the Rev. J.
Fergusson remarked upon it — that Prof.
Barker's Ben More moss, 
gathered seven years ago, was also found on the north-eastern side of the 
mountain, the aspect upon which spores blown from Iceland or Norway 
would be most likely to be deposited.
Or, regarding this more as a relic 
of a time when an alpine flora covered the land, the assertion might be 
ventured on that a north-eastern slope would have the bleakest aspect, 
and that on such a slope boreal types would longest survive.
It is to be regretted that such a limited quantity was gathered by Mr.
West and myself on Whernside, as if the moss is very local (as on Ben 
More) it may be no easy_matter to find the precise spot again.
The 
faciei of the moss, when growing, was not appreciably difi'erent from A.
palmtre, the only contrast being that the colour of the tuft, or young 
barren shoot, was of a paler, yellower green, and the leaves more imbri- 
cated, more closely overlying one another, than is generally the case in 
the common species.
The moss is one I had never before seen, and 
until Mr. Boswell recognised it neither he nor I knew that it was a 
British plant at all.
I have never received, or even seen, continental 
specimens, and should imagine the species to be almost unrepresented in 
English herbaria.
Mr. West and myself, if all go well, will certainly 
make an effort to re-gather it in quantity in the spring.
I had not 
intended to record its discovery at all until we had so re-gathered it ; 
this present record is forced upon me by others threatening to publish 
the facts if I do not.
III.
Fontinalis gracilis, Lindb.
(F.
minor, Wahlenberg.) This moss, 
not previously known as British, was detected at Malham Cove in 1876, 
by Prof.
Barker, of Owen's College — a most acute observer, as Mr.
Fergusson informs me.
I have received a specimen.
When not in 
fruit I do not wonder it should have been hitherto overlooked, since in 
fades it bears a considerable resemblance to Hypmm cordijoliiim when 
growing in water, or to H.Jiuitans.
I do not mean that examination 
with a lens will not instantly reveal the difference, for it will ; but to the 
naked eye the similarity is so great, that I am sure if I had chanced to 
find it growing by the Aire at Malham Cove, when last there, unknowing 
that Fontinalis gracilis grew there.
I should have said in my mind, 
" Hypmim fiuitaiis^'' and passed on.
Of course to so pass mosses is a 
dangerous thing, a bad habit ; and yet how often it is done, and espe-

Though the exigencies of the natural system of classification have neces- 
sitated the dispersion of the plants hitherto known as Fungi among the 
different classes of thallophytes, it is well-nigh certain that for a long 
time to come the term will continue to be used, if not as the name of a 
group morphologically distinct, at least as a very convenient designation 
for those thallophytes whose function of nutrition presents special pecu- 
liarities.
Chief among these peculiarities is the fact that in these plants 
the power of decomposing water, carbonic acid and ammonia, as such, 
and initialing new combinations of the elements of these, so as to pro- 
duce compounds of a higher degree of complexity, is entirely wanting, 
due to the absence of that green colouring matter called chlorophyll which 
is so characteristic of all other plants, with a few exceptions, from the 
simplest and smallest protophytes to the most highly ornamented 
phanerogams.
That such an important physiological distinction, which 
is practically a suppression of the functions of assimilation altogether, 
should avail little for the purposes of classification, will not seem strange 
* Read before the Leeds Natui-alists' Club and Scientific Association, Sep 17, 1878.
88 
The Naturalist.
if we remember that the functions of plants are remarkably uniform 
even in the most widely separated forms, and that in consequence, blink 
the fact as we may, here, as in the other moiety of the organic world, the 
best classificatioas are essentially morphological.
In speaking of fungi, 
therefore, it will be understood that I do so in the sense and with the 
limitations indicated.
For use, the term is simply a physiological one, 
and is not intended to connote either morphological or classificatory 
distinctions.
Another matter that perhaps needs a word of explanation is the 
meaning to be attached to the phrase "sexual reproduction." In the 
m )re highly organised plants, as among the higher animals, the sexual 
organs are so different, at least in external form, and the act of fertiliza- 
tion is attended with so many subordinate but co-operating processes, 
that its essential character is more or less obscured.
By the study of 
lower forms, however, it becomes obvious that all that is required to 
constitute a true case of sexual reproduction is the fusion of two indi- 
vidualised fragments of protoplasm, derived either from distinct plants 
or from different parts of the same plant, whose coalescence is the 
starting point of a longer or shorter series of changes in the fused mass, 
that ultimately issue in the production of one or more individuals 
specifically identical with the parent.
The fact that a process of this nature obtains to any extent among 
fungi has only been demonstrated within very recent years, through the 
investigations of Tulasne, De Bary, Pringsheim, Van Tieghem, and 
others, and, strange though it may seem, has hardly received from 
English botanists the attention its importance deserves.
I have thought, 
therefore, that a brief account of the principal results that have already 
been obtained would be interesting to the members of our Society, and 
might stimulate the working botanist to attempt the verification, and if 
possible the extension of the observations that have been recorded.
In the most recent classifications of the vegetable kingdom, the fungi 
are distributed, as already indicated, among the four classes of thallo- 
phytes, termed respectively ProtopJiyta^ Zijgospore(B, Oosporea^ and Car- 
posporece, and I shall best attain the object I have in view by considering 
the fungoid forms of each of these in order.
Protopliyta.
In the class of protophytes we have a number of fungi 
arranged under the heads of ScJiizomycetes and Saccharomyces.
The 
former includes the somewhat numerous forms of Bacteria, and the latter 
the so-called Torula, or yeast fungus.
In the ScJiizomycetes multiplication 
always takes place by transverse division.
In Saccharomyces it is brought 
about by gemmation, or budding, and by the endogenous formation of 
Hick : The Sexual RErEODUcxiox of Fungi.
89 
ascospores.
In neither group do we as yet know of any sexual process 
of propagation, and we may therefore pass on at once to the 
Zygospores.
The fungi placed in this class are grouped into two 
orders, Myxomycetes, or Myxogastres, and ZygomyQeU^s, in both of which 
examples of sexual reproduction are met with.
As might have been 
expected, however, from the simple structure of the organisms concerned, 
the process is by no means a complicated one, and is altogether wanting 
in some of the features usually regarded as essential.
Myxomycetes.
The life-history of the Myxomycetes is in many respects 
so peculiar, and their outward aspect, at certain stages, so different from 
that of most plants, that by some naturalists they have been excluded 
from the vegetable kingdom, and have been treated as animals.
But the 
best authorities now regard them as forming a distinct group of plants, 
which in the absence of chlorophyll, in the function of nutrition, and the 
mode of formation of their spores, have close affinities with the fungi.
Many of them, such as the Arcyrias, Physarums, Stemonites, and 
Trichias, are common in the autumn on old decayed stumps, where they 
may often be gathered in all stages of development.
Several of these 
form a peculiarly constructed sporangium containing a capillitium of 
closely meshed or free threads, among which a large number of small 
spores are produced.
The sexual process, which is here termed " conju- 
gation " on account of the similarity of the uniting masses of protoplasm, 
is effected by the contents of the spores, and may be described generally 
as follows : — 
The spores having been scattered by the rupture of the structureless 
walls of the sporangium and the elasticity of the capillitium, are capable 
of germination as soon as the requisite warmth, moisture, and a suitable 
substratum are obtained.
Should these conditions be wanting, their 
vital activity will remain inactive a considerably time, without being 
entirely lost.
On germination the spores do not form any structure 
comparable to the mycelial threads so commonly produced by fungus 
spores, but the cellulose coat ruptures, and the protoplasmic contents 
come out in a naked condition, and, as is usual with free fragments of 
protoplasm, assume a more or less globular form.
Losing this after a 
short time, and becoming elongated and somewhat tapering at one 
extremity, the protoplasm develops a fine cilium and moves about like an 
amoeba.
In this condition it lives for a little while, absorbing nourish- 
ment, increasing in bulk, and even multiplying by division, and may be 
conveniently spoken of as a zoospore.
But by-and-by the nucleus dis- 
appears, the cilium is lost, the amoeboid movements become sluggish, the

and give rise to a larger mass of protoplasm, termed " Plasmodium,** 
which has most of the characters of the individuals of which it is com- 
posed, differing from them chiefly in size.
Subseq^uently the plasmodia 
themselves conjugate in a wholesale sort of way, and growing by the 
absorption of fresh nutriment, the substratum becomes covered with an 
amorphous mass of richly granular protoplasm, whose appearance is 
remarkably characteristic.
Ultimately, by a species of contraction or 
condensation of the protoplasm round certain points, the mass becomes 
broken up into a number of naare or less distinct portions, which take 
on the form of the mature sporangia.
At first each of these portions of 
protoplasm is homogeneous throughout, but in a very short time the 
surface becomes ^differentiated into a kind of structureless membrane, 
while the interior passes over without the intermediate formation of any 
cellular structure, into spores and capillitium.
The whole now forms a 
perfect sporangium (Fig. 1, Plate II).
Thus the cycle of phenomena which in the aggregate make up the life- 
history of one of these remarkable organisms returns into itself, and so 
long as the conditions are favourable, may be indefinitely repeated.
That the process we have described as " conjugation should be regarded 
-as a sexual mode of reproduction, may appear at first sight an unwar- 
srantable use, or indeed an abuse of the terms employed ; we believe, 
nevertheless, that if due allowance be made for the many abnormalities 
exhibited by these plants, and the phenomena under consideration be 
compared with what occurs in other zygosporese, the interpretation put 
upon them will hardly be regarded as either strained or unnatural.

— I can add one or two species 
!to those in Mr. Butterell's list in the Naturalist for December.
Ancylus 
JluviatiUs occurs in the Hotham Beck, and in streamlets about Brough 
and Welton.
Vertigo edentula was found near Brough at the meeting of 
the Yorkshire Naturalists' Union there.
Helix rufescens can scarcely fail 
•to occur.
It is found at Goole, and our late recorder in conchology, the 
Rev. R, D.
Maxwell, took it at Bridlington.
Conovulus myosotis should 
be looked for in marshes by the Humber.
Mr. Maxwell found an empty 
shell among tidal debris on the banks of the Ouse at Goole, probably 
washed up from below.
The same gentleman also found two or three 
small specimens of Tellina tenuis, dead, but containing the soft parts, so 
that this species probably lives somewhere near the mouth of the Hum- 
ber.
If Mr. Butterell includes the Market Weighton canal in his area, 
Unio pictorum and U.
tumidus, which inhabit it, may be added to his 
list, and it is very likely that Sphcp,rium rivicola and the Paludinm 
would reward a search in the same locality.

Short Notes and Queries.
91 
Altitude to which Luzula spicata descends.
— Mr. F.
A. Lees is, I 
think, greatly mistaken in sui3posing {Naturalist, p.
69) that Luzula 
spicata does not, in Britain, descend below 2,800 feet.
In the " Students' 
Flora " it is said to grow as low as 1000 feet, and I have an impression 
that I have seen it (though I cannot at present say where) at not much 
above that altitude.
In Perthshire I have not seen it much lower than 
2,400 feet.
—F.
Buchanan White, Perth, 3rd Dec.
Bryological Notes.
— In recent numbers of the Naturalist Mr. White- 
head makes very interesting explanations regarding the discovery of 
Seligeria tristicha in England.
Schimper's statements in the last edition 
of the Synopsis, with regard to the British localities of this species, are 
rather curious when compared and analysed.
First of all he states that 
the plant is rare in England and Scotland — a general statement which is 
quite satisfactory.
At the end of the Synopsis, in the pages devoted to 
new localities for some rare mosses, he states that the plant had been 
gathered at Castleton by Mr. Whitehead, and at Blair Athole by Miss 
Mclnroy in 1860.
Notwithstanding Mr. Whitehead's explanation in the 
last number of the Naturalist, it seems to me still very doubtful whether 
the plant occurs at Castleton ; and with regard to the Blair Athole 
locality, the date of the discovery of the plant there as not correct.
It 
shouldjbe 1858, not 1860.
I pointed this out in one of the earlier num- 
bers of Grevillea, and I would not have noticed it here had it not been 
that Dr. Lees in a late number of the Naturalist accepts Schimper's date 
without suspicion, and that the error is likely to be accepted by others.
Mr. Whitehead refers to several other mistakes in the Synopsis.
For 
these unfortunately one has not long to search, for they are neither few 
nor far between.
Some of them are amusing mis-translations.
For 
example, under Fottia crinita, Wilson in his Bryologia gives localities for 
the plant, and dates when discovered or gathered — thus, " East coast of 
Angusshire, between Montrose and Redhead, 1827-8, also on the coast 
of Fifeshire, Thomas Drummond.
Near Aberdeen, Dr. G.
Dickie." 
This appears in the Synopsis thus : — " On the east coast of Angusshire, 
between Montrose and Bedhead, 1827 (Wilson).
On the shores of Fife- 
shire, near Aberdeen, Dr. G.
Dickie." This is a mis-translation almost as 
remarkable as that^by Bridel, in which he supposes that the name of the 
gentleman on whose property Grimmia unicolor was discovered in Clova, 
is the name of the discoverer of the plant.
Hardly any one, within the 
last dozen years, has been a more enthusiastic and successful worker 
among the mosses of the south of England than Mr. E.
M. Holmes, late 
of Plymouth, and now of London ; and it might have been expected that 
he would have been mentioned by Schimper in connection with some of 
the discoveries of species new to Britain or to science ; but no — I do not 
at present remember if his name occurs in the Synopsis, We have, under 
Bidymodon sinuosus, ^'Plymouth, Mr. Hunt"; under TricJwstomum 
littorale we have Plymouth, Mr. Hunt," again.
Mr, Holmes was the 
first to gather these and other important mosses near Plymouth, and 
92 
The Naturalist.
Mr. Hunt, I fancy, never gathered a single moss in Devon.
With regard 
to the mosses of the north of England, matters are still worse.
I think I 
am accurate in making the following corrections of, and additions to, the 
statements in the Synopsis.
Under Cam2Jylopns paradoxus, to " Near 
Levens, Westmoreland, communicated by Dr. Wood," add " discovered 
first of all near Wooler by Messrs.
Hardy and Boyd, and at Levens by 
Mr. Barnes." Under Discelium nudum, to "abundantly near Man- 
chester (Wood)," add '^discovered there by Mr. G.
Cayley, and after- 
wards found in many situations in the same neighbourhood." The plant 
was unknown when Mr. Cayley first gathered it.
Under Bryum Warnenm 
for "near Southport and at Ashton-under-Lyne, Wood," read, "Near 
Southport, Wilson and Marrat ; near Ashton-under-Lyne, Mr. White- 
head." Under Bryum calophyllum, ioT "Near Southport Wood 
near Ashton-under-Lyne.
Whitehead and Schofield," read, " Near South- 
port, Mr. Marrat ; near Ashton-under-Lyne, Mr. R.
Gordon." Under 
Bryum turbirud iin, for " long unobserved in Britain, but gathered abund- 
antly in 1865, on wet gravel near Ashton-under-Lyne by Whitehead and 
Schofield," read, " Long known in Britain before its discovery near 
Ashton-under-Lyne, by Mr. R.
Gordon." Under Atrichum crispum, for 
" At Staly Brushes where Dr. Wood in the year 1860 first detected it 
in Britain," read, "First observed by Nowell, near Todmorden ; Staly 
Brushes, Whitehead, 1859," &c.
Under Amblystegium confervoides, for 
" Near Kendal, J.
B. Wood," read "near Kendal, Barnes." Under 
Bryum neodamense but I need not extend the list by giving more 
instances, though a very large number could be given.
All will agree 
with me when I say, first, that it is a pity Schimper did not more closely 
follow Wilson's Bryologia, which is one of the most accurate, if not the 
most accurate work on mosses which I wot of, and which would have 
saved the Synopsis from many errors ; and secondly, that it is unfortunate 
that Schimper so often sinks the discoverer of a plant in a country or 
district — the plodding, hard-working discoverer, — below those who merely 
distribute what others have gathered and given them.

Baknsley Naturalists' Society.
— Meeting Dec. 11th.— Mr. E.
R..
Kell, C.E., continued his series of papers on The Eggs of British Birds," 
with plates and brief descriptions of the birds and their habits.
That 
useful family for destroying rats, mice, and other vermin, the owls, was 
graphically described.
The president (Mr. T.
Lister), made a few obser- 
vations of birds which, in-fekis extraordinary season, with a temperature on 
a succession of nights ranging from 6 to 20 degrees below freezing point, 
have afforded an unusual treat to field naturalists.
On the 12th Mr. W.
Talbot noted the merganser, scaup-duck, pochard, immense flocks of 
mallards, five snipe, many golden plovers ; three merlins on the 25th ; 
white-fronted goose, 28th ; on the 30th November as many as eight king- 
fishers, a great spotted woodpecker, and five male sparrow hawks.
Mr.
J. Whitehead saw a wheatear at Mexborough so late as Nov. 17th ; my- 
self and Mr. H.
Parker have noted many wild ducks at Stainborough, &c.
Five herons flew north over Barnsley Dec. 8th.
It is a hard time for the 
small birds — the thrush, blackbird, storm-cock, fieldfare, and redwing 
come about the houses for waste food, and even pied wagtails, titmice, 
and chaffinches come to share with the sparrows and robins.
The latter 
sang Dec. 12th.

94 
The Naturalist.
LL.D. The opening meeting was held Dec. IGfch, and an address was 
given by the president, who expounded in a most vigorous and learned 
manner the sciences of botany, chemistry, geology, microscopy, and con- 
gratulated the promoters upon the success which had attended them 
during the formation of the society.
A conversazione then took place, 
and several specimens of interest were exhibited by the members.
Bradford Naturalists' Society.
— Meeting Nov. 26th, Mr. Illingworth 
in the chair.
— It was decided to invite six gentlemen from neighbouring 
societies to the annual soiree.
Mr. Benney then gave a lecture on The 
Weather," showing that water must be expanded 860 times to be lighter 
than air at sea level, and that the rapid condensation of particles caused 
a vacuum, into which the air rushed with a rotatory motion, this latter 
theory having been promulgated by Mr. Rowell, of Oxford.
He also 
explained the various kinds of storms.
Meeting Dec. 10th, the president in the chair.
— This was the fourth 
annual meeting, which took the form of a soiree.
About seventy persons 
sat down to tea, after which the election of officers took place.
Mr. W.
Jagger was re-elected president, and all the retiring officers were also 
re-elected.
The annual report was read, and showed the society to be in 
a flourishing condition.
Messrs.
Jagger, Barber, and others addressed 
the meeting.

Cncullia ahsynthii, Lohophora viretata, Diasemia litemlis, Scopula ferrugalis, 
Cramhus dumetellus, Ephestia simtella, E.
cinerosella and Eudorea coarc- 
talis.
He also showed a series of beautifully coloured plates from the 
" Transactions " of the Linnean Society of London.
Mr. C.
P. Hobkirk 
showed the following mosses : — Aulacomnium palustre and A.
androgy^mm 
(British), A.
turgidum in fruit (Norway), and A.
heterostichum, United 
States.
The examination of these specimens under the microscope, 
and details of their characters, created great interest.

Mr. Johnson, 39 species of Tinece.
Leeds Naturalists' Club and Scientific Association.
— Ninth 
annual meeting, Dec. 3rd.
— The retiring president, Mr. Hy.
Pocklington, 
F.E-.M.S., occupied the chair.
The ballot for the new council resulted in 
the election of Mr. Edw^ard Atkinson, F.L.S., F.Z.S., as president ; the 
re-election of the secretary, Mr. W.
Denison Roebuck ; treasurer, Mr.
W. E.

elected were Messrs.
C. H.
Bothamley, B.
Holgate, F.G.S., W.

gate, and S.
Jefferson, F.C.S. The annual reports and balance-sheet 
were then read and passed.
The president reviewed the society's work 
during the past year, and votes of thanks terminated the meeting.
It 
will be seen that for convenience sake the annual meeting has been fixed 
to be held in future on the first Tuesday in December, the meetings being 
resumed in the last week of J anuary each year.
Manchester Cryptogamic Society.
— Meeting, Mr. W.
H. Pearson, 
V.P., in the chair.
— Amongst the objects exhibited was a beautiful series 
of microscopical preparations by Mr. Peter G.
Cunliffe, F.R.M.S., 
showing the progressive development of the fructification of Funaria 
hygrometrica.
A number of rare cryptogamic plants were exhibited, one 
of which was Aulacomnium turgidum, from the north-eastern slope of 
Whernside, where it was recently discovered by Mr. F.
Arnold Lees, 
F.L.S., and Mr. W.
West.
Fruiting specimens communicated by Mr.
Percival, from Norway, were shown along with it for the purpose of com- 
parison, leaving no doubt as to the British plant being the true A .
turgi- 
dum.
Another interesting moss exhibited was a fruiting specimen, also 
from the north of Europe, of Paludella squarrosa.
This moss was found 
growing at Knutsford so long ago as the year 1831, by the late Mr» 
Wilson, author of the " Bryologia Britannica," but it was in a barren 
state, and the station is now lost.
It has been found in small quantity 
in the West Riding of Yorkshire, and perhaps also in one or two other 
localities, but never fertile.
The fertile specimen exhibited was from the 
Dovref jeld.
Mr. Wild and Mr. Pearson exhibited some hepaticse new to 
Britain.

Wakefield Naturalists' Society.
—Meeting, Dec. 6th, Mr. William 
Talbot, v.p., in the chair.
— Mr. Spurling exhibited some fine specimens of 
Taxidermic art, including the following : — Porzana maruetta (spotted 
crake), and Turdus Uiacus (redwing).
The exhibits by Mr. H.
Sims were 
A. saucea, A.
citraria, A.
aura^itiana (male and female) ; by Mr. G.
Wilson, D.
Orion, A.
ripoe, and N.
trepida.
Mr. E.
B. Wrigglesworth 
read a paper on Melolontha vulgaris, the cockchafer.
He referred first to 
the system of Linnaeus, who divided this group into three sections, in the 
first of which the thorax is armed with horns, the second with the thorax 
unarmed but having horns on the head, and the third those like M, 
vulgaris, in which the head and thorax are both without horns, and in 
illustration showed specimens of Typhosus vulgaris, Linodendron cylindri- 
cum, Scarabceus lunaris, and Melolontha vulgaris.
He next explained the 
cause of its altered position in our modern nomenclature, pointing out the 
distinguishing features of the Melolontha, illustrating his remarks with 
a number of microscopic slides and a beautiful specimen of Lucanus cervus, 
the great stag-beetle, kindly sent him by G.
T. Porritt, Esq., F.L.S. He 
finally discussed at some length the habits and food of both larvae and 
imago.

THE SEXUAL REPRODUCTION OF FUNGI.
By Thomas Hick, B.A., B.Sc.
(Concluded.) 
Zygomycetes.
Another order of fungoid Zygospores in which a sexual 
mode of reproduction has been observed is that of the Zygomycetes., which 
includes the well-known Mucors.
A common but excellent type of the 
order is found in Mucor mucedo, which may be met with on raw and 
preserved fruits, animal excreta, &c., at all seasons of the year.
The 
vegetative body of this plant consists of a number of tubular, usually 
aseptate threads, which become more or less closely interwoven during 
growth, to form a felted mass termed the mycelium.
It is reproduced 
asexually by chlamydospores, and by spores formed endogenously in a 
sporangium, and sexually by zygospores which are formed in this way.
Two perfectly similar and neighbouring threads come into contact, or 
" conjugate," by' their free swollen extremities, the contents of which 
become shut off from the contents of the rest of the threads, by trans- 
verse partitions.
These threads are straight in Mucor, RJiizopus, and 
CJicetocladium, but in Phycomyces they are curved.
The double partition 
which separates the protoplasm in the dilated heads of the conjugating 
threads soon becomes absorbed, and the two portions then coalesce and 
blend together to form a single mass, which, having formed for itself a 
double cellulose coat, becomes the zygospore (Fig. 2, PL II).
The zygospore thus formed remains quiescent for a time, and is said to 
require desiccation before it germinates.
When this occurs, the delicate

The Naturalist.
inner coat protrudes itself and elongates into a short tube, which termi- 
nates, without the intervention of a mycelium, in an ordinary sporangium, 
in which spores are produced asexually.
In connection with the formation of the zygospores of PJiycomyces 
niteas, Van Tieghem and Le Monnier have described a somewhat curious 
but highly significant phenomenon.
During the time that conjugation is 
being effected by the arched cells, these produce on the zone adjoining 
the transverse partitions which cut off the uniting portions, a series of 
repeatedly dichotomous processes as represented in Fig, 2.
These do not 
appear simultaneously but in successive order, and upon one of the arcuate 
cells before the other ^ and the authors ingeniously suggest that in this we 
have a " first step in the differentiation of the two elements whose union 
forms the germ- cell, an indication as yet feebly marked, but still very 
distinct, of sexuality, in the process of conjugation." When we come 
to the Bisconiycetes and the Lichens we shall see how the formation of 
apparently homologous processes gives rise to the fruit-cup, so charac- 
teistic of these groups, as well as to the so-called " paraphyses " with 
which the cups are accompanied.
Oospores, In the fungoid Zygosporece'^d'^ conjugating cells — whether 
naked and motile, or stationary and clothed with a cellulose coat — are in 
the main so similar to one another, that in the majority of cases it is 
impossible to distinguish them as male and female.
In the Oosporece the 
case is otherwise.
Here there are such well-marked morphological and 
physiological differences between the two elements as to render distinc- 
tion both obvious and easy, and even to necessitate the employment of 
different terms.
Accordingly the male organ is spoken of as the 
Antlieridium, the female organ as the Oogonium, while the spore formed as 
the result of the sexual act is conveniently designated as an Oospore.
In this class sexual reproduction has been made out more or less 
satisfactorily in the genera Saprolegnia and Peronospora, which may be 
taken as types of the orders Saproleynics and Peronosporece.
Saprolegnieoe.
The Saprolegnias are fungi, not very dissimilar in some 
of their characters from the Mucors.
They make their appearance on 
animal substances partially or wholly immersed in water, especially on 
dead insects.
Sometimes they attach living fish, not only when domes- 
ticated in aquaria, but also in the wild state, as was pointed out by 
Mr. Brook in the Naturalist for May, 1878.
They are unicellular 
plants consisting of long unarticulated tubular threads, whose proximal 
ends penetrate the nourishing substratum, while the distal ones spread 
out into the surrounding water.
Under favourable conditions they 
multiply themselves very rapidly by asexual zoospores or zoogonidia, 
Hick: The Sexual Eepeoduotion of Fungi.
99 
which are developed in the clavate extremities of the threads, and it is 
only after an indefinite number of such generations have been produced, 
that the sexual individuals make their appearance.
The free ends of certain threads swell up into a globular form and 
become filled with a dense and richly granular protoplasm.
The cavity 
of this globular body becomes separated from that of the filament by a 
transverse wall, and it then forms the Oogonium.
The protoplasmic 
contents of the Oogonium contract by the expulsion of water and divide 
into two, four, or more portions, which rounding themselves off consti- 
tute the oospheres, and await the advent of the male element.
Meanwhile the male organs are also formed as much thinner lateral 
branches which usually arise below the Oogonium.
They are as a rule 
strongly curved so that their extremities are brought into close proximity 
with the Oogonium.
The extremity of each branch swells a little and 
becomes separated by a transverse wall, giving rise to a large terminal 
cell, which is the Antheridium (Fig. 3).
The process of fertilization of the oospheres by the contents of the 
Antheridium appears to be a remarkable one.
According to Pringsheim 
the inner wall of the Oogonium produces at different points a number of 
wart-like knobs, which may or may not remain covered with the outer 
wall.
When the Antheridium is fully formed it applies itself firmly to 
the outer wall of the Oogonium, and manages to cover one or more of the 
points at which warty protuberances have arisen.
The inner wall of the 
Antheridium now develops a small protuberance which penetrates the 
Oogonium wall, comes in contact with one of the projections from the 
inner layer, through which it grows, forming a short narrow tube whose 
extremity conceals itself among the oospheres.
The end of the fertilizing 
tube now opens itself ; the contents of the Antheridium pass through 
into the Oogonium, and the oospheres become fertilized thereby.
Subse- 
quently they surround themselves with thick firm walls, and remain for 
months quietly lying in the Oogonia.
When germination takes place 
the oospore either develops a germ tube, which immediately grows to a 
branched plant, in which later on zoospores are found, or the oospore 
puts forth a sLort tube which opens at the apex and empties the whole 
of its contents in the form of zoospores.
Pero7iospore(B.
The type of this order, Feronospora infestans^ has been 
the subject of repeated observation and discussion owing to the fact that 
it is the chief cause of the well-known potato disease.
Very prolonged 
investigations into its hife-history have been made by Mr. Worthing- 
ton G.
Smith whose papers in the Gardeners' Chronicle, Monthly 
Microscopical Journal, and Quarterly Journal of Microscopical Science 
100

may be consulted for full and elaborate details and carefully executed 
illustrations.
It is reproduced sexually in a manner which closely resembles that 
described in Saprol^gnia.
Some of , the articulated hyphoe give rise to 
thickwalled spherical oogonia, while neighbouring ones produce smaller 
bodies termed Antheridia.
These come into contact by a sort of conju- 
gation, and as a result the contents of the Oogonia become converted 
into oospores.
After passing through a period of rest, these germinate, 
and either produce vegetative threads which form the ordinary mycelium, 
or biciliated zoospores, which ultimately become quiescent, and then 
grow up into new plants.
Carpospoee-E.
We now come to an extraordinarily large number of 
fungi, very various in external form and appearance, of which our know- 
ledge is of a somewhat fragmentary character, but which are provision- 
ally placed among the CarposjjorecB.
They constitute the orders desig- 
nated by fiingologists Ascomi/cdes, JEcidionujcetes, Usfilaginece, and 
Basidioviycetes, the general of which will be familiar to all who 
have given any attention to these members of the vegetable kingdom.
In the three last orders, the existence of a sexual mode of propagation 
can hardly be said as yet to have been satisfactorily demonstrated, though 
in a few instances it has been asserted and circumstantially described.
Confirmatory observations, however, are still desiderated, and until these 
come to hand, we shall err on the safe side in not building too much on 
what rests upon the investigations of single observers.
Ascomj/cefes.
With respect to the Ascomi/cetes, however, no such 
caution is necessary, as in all the families it includes, sexual generation 
may be confidently stated to take place.
Thus in ErysipJie and its 
allies, the small globular perithecia or concepticles, are in fact but the 
sexually produced fruits, formed by means of sexual organs ; and the 
same may be said of the Eurotium form of Aspergillus glaucus.
In 
PemcilVium^ as well as in other genera of Tuberaceoe and in the Pyreno- 
7/jgcetes, the hitherto much misunderstood sclerotia have also been shown 
to be in close connection with a sexual act.
It is, however, in the Discomycetes that we have perhaps the most 
interesting details connected with the sexual reproduction of this order.
The family is tolerably well known from the fact that it includes the 
whole of the Pezizas and Ascoboli, which are almost universally 
distributed, and are as common as they are numerous.
A vertical 
section through a typical species shows that it consists of a vegetative 
part composed of fine mycelial filaments, and a reproductive part which 
is usually designated as the " receptacle," or " apothecium." The latter 
Hick : The Sexual Reproduction of Fungi.
101 
is a discoid body, the base of which is pseudo-parenchymatous, and 
whose upper surface bears a number of clavate " asci," containing spores.
Intermingled with the "asci" are numerous delicate filaments named 
" paraphyses/' whose free tips are usually slightly swollen and contain a 
little colouring matter.
The origin and homologies of these structures 
were never set in their true light until the course of their development 
had been carefully followed, and they were shown to be the result of 
of sexual impregnation.
This was first accomplished in 1863 by the 
indefatigable De Bary (with whom was subsequently associated 
Tulasne), who worked upon Peziza confiue/is, and showed that its 
"apothecia" arose from an act of sexual union.
In 1871 Janczewski 
wrought out the development of the receptacle in A-scoIjoIus furfu- 
raceuSj which is diagramatically shown in Fig. 4, and may be briefly 
described as follows : — 
The germinating spore gives rise to a delicate mycelium, portions 
of which become differentiated into the Carpogonium and the Anthe- 
ridium.
The former consists of a row of wider but shorter cells, and 
is strongly curved ; the latter consists of a branched thread, differing 
but little from the hyphee of the mycelium.
The Antheridium attaches 
itself to the anterior portion of the Carpogonium, around which it 
becomes tightly twisted.
In consequence of fertilization, one of the 
middle cells of the Carpogonium grows larger than the rest, becomes 
somewhat rounded, and by sprouting produces numerous threads, from 
which, later on, are developed the asci.
Meanwhile there has arisen 
from the hyphae bearing the sexual organs a mass of pseudo-parenchyma 
which envelopes the whole Carpogonium, and forms the sterile part 
of the fruit.
The ascogenous threads springing from the Carpogo- 
nium thus lie together within the fruit-body or sporocarp, in a sub- 
hymenial layer, and send outwards thick club-shaped branches — the 
asci — within which the spores arise by free cell-formation.
The 
sterile hyph^ also produce numerous parallel branches, the para- 
physes, which grow up between the asci, with which they form the 
hymenium.
Finally, the psuedo -parenchymatous sheath opens at the 
. summit, the hymenium comes to lie on the surface, and expands itself 
as armature receptacle (Fig. 4).
Only one other family of the order [Ascomycetes remains to be 
noticed, but that an important one, and one which has lately occupied 
a considerable share of attention.
I refer to the Liehens.
In treating 
them as Fungi, and thus bringing them within the scope of this paper, 
I am at once following in the wake of very high authorities, and 
giving effect to my own personal convictions.
Much has been said 
102 
The Naturalist.
both for and against the theory that Lichens are Ascomycetous Fungi 
parasitic on algse, since 1868, when Schwendener formally stated it, 
and I for one am not disposed to dogmatise upon the subject.
But 
this I must say, that the more I see of their structure and morphology, 
and the more closely I observe the different stages of their develop- 
ment under ordinary and natural conditions, on old walls, gates, the 
trunks of trees, &c., the more does the theory appear to me to harmo- 
nise with the facts.
In like manner the researches that have been 
undertaken during the last few years, with a view to demonstrate the 
truth or falsity of the theory, appear to me to leave a clear balance in 
its favour.
But this is by the way.
Let us turn to what more imme- 
diately concerns us, and consider the nature of the process by which 
their sexual reproduction is brought about.
Our knowledge of this phase of their life history is at present of a 
very limited character, but the investigations of Stahl* leave little 
doubt that, like their congeners among the true Fungi, they are 
propagated in this, as well as in an asexual manner.
In the thallus of every Lichen it is usually possible to distinguish 
two elements, the characters and relative proportions of which differ 
in different genera, and even in different species.
One of these 
consists of green cells, the so-called Gonidia, which in many cases are 
identical with free-living algge, while the other is made up of a 
number of colourless cellular threads or hyphse, whose morphological 
and physiological characters are in the main identical with those of 
Fungi.
The best known reproductive structures are usually spoken of 
as Ajjotjiecia and Sjpermogonia.
The apotJ/ecia are similar in almost 
every detail to the cup-shaped receptacles of the Biscomycetee already 
described.
They are composed of a number of clavate spore-bearing 
asci, intermingled with which are delicate filaments swollen at the 
tip — the paraphyses.
They commonly differ in colour from the 
thallus on which they are borne.
The Spermogonia are small cavities 
of various shapes in the upper surface of the thallus, which produce 
very small spore-like bodies called spermatia.
The "apothecia" of Lichens bearing such a strong resemblance,   
both in outward appearance and internal structure to those of Fungi, 
the idea naturally suggests itself that they may have a similar origin.
The results of the investigations of Stahl, mentioned above, enable us 
to assert that at least there is some evidence for the belief that they 
have.
* An excellent resume of these investigations from tlie pen of my able friend, Mr.
S. H.
Vines, M.A., of Cambridge, may be read in the Quarterly Journal of 
Microscopical Science for October, 1878.
Wesley : Fo^^TINALIS gracilis.
103 
Working 1123011 CoUema mlcropliylluui, Stalil found withiii the 
thalliis certain structures wliicli he regarded as Carpogonia.
Each 
carpogonium consists of a hrphal filament which is tyristed upon 
- itself two or three times to form an ascogonium, and then runs 
vertically upwards to the surface of the thallus, above which its 
terminal cell projects.
The vertical portion of the thread, from its 
relation to the ascogonium and the part it plays in the process of 
fertilization, he considers as physiologically homologous with the 
Trichogyne of the Floridese.
Fertilization is effected by the sper- 
matia which adhere to the Trichogyne, and apparently the wall 
becomes absorbed at the spot, and there is free communication 
between the interior of the spermatium and that of the Trichogyne.
As a result of fertilization, the Trichogyne withers, the Ascogonium 
enlarges, and filaments are produced from its cells which either 
become asci themselves, or develop asci as lateral branches.
Mean- 
while the hyphal filaments of the thallus give rise to a cup-shaped 
I investing mass of felt-work, from which branches grow up between 
the separating coils of the ascogonium and produce the paraphyses.
In this manner the apothecium is gradually built up and constituted, 
the asci and paraphyses originating from hyphje entirely distinct from 
each other as in A^coholn^ fiirfuraceus.
With this example of sexual reproduction among Fungi I must 
for the present take leave of the subject.
I am fully conscious that 
in the rapid review I have taken of it, many important and suggestive 
details have been omitted, and several most interesting analogies 
have been left unnoticed.
But I have already exceeded the limits 
assigned me, and must leave those who are sufficiently interested to 
fill in for themselves whatever is wanting to complete the outline.

FO.YTIlVALIS gracilis, Lixd.
J. S.
Weslev, M.B.
In the January number of the Xaturalist the moss Fontinalis gracilis, 
Lindberg, .is announced as a distinct species, and as being new to 
I Britain.
In the interests of botanical science this statement should 
not be allowed to pass without comment.
First, as to its claim to specific rank : Schimper in his Synopsis, 
Ed. II.
1876 gives it as Fontincdis antijpyretica, var.
y gracilis^ and his 
description, translated, is as follows :— " More graceful than the ordi- 
nary form, often more fasciculately branched, often half-a-foot long, and 
i 
104 
The Naturalist.
without leaves at the base, capsules generally more abundant.
Leaves   
narrower, more acute, the keel less arcuate, more glistening, of firmer ^ 
structure, leaf cells narrower, more frequently split along the keel, ^ 
and with the alar expansion at the base of one or other side less " 
reflexed.
Capsule and spores as in the type." Then there is given 
as the synonym Foiitinalis gracilis, Lindb., Not. Sallsk.
Fauna et Fl.
Fenn.
1868.* 
Schimper goes on to say : — " Against the opinion of the illustrious | 
Lindberg I consider variety y as not specifically distinct from F.
anti- | 
pyretica..
I have noticed it in very many localities, more especially in j 
the rivulets of the higher Vosges, where in 1837 I gathered a good ] 
supply of specimens loaded with fructificatioQ, and twenty years later I 
in the very same place found it manifestly passing in a transitional \ 
state towards the normal form.
The specimens sent me by its \ 
eminent describer exactly agree with those from the Vosges and   
others sent me from many localities pretty nearly all over Europe, J 
but not with the description set forth by the illustrious Lindberg in i 
the work quoted above.
The perichaetia are described as radiculose ;   
the fact is, that radicular fibres at the base of the perich^tial branch 
are sometimes present, sometimes wanting, just as in the type F.
anti- 
pyretica ; the leaves present the same characters as in it " (the type) ; 
" the capsule is found smaller or larger, as often as not of just the 
same shape and size as in it, not ventricose, nor when dry more 
constricted below the mouth, nor composed of cells twice as large, as 
Lindberg says of it ; the teeth of the peristome do not differ in the 
least, either in shape, length, number of articulations, arrangement of 
tubercles, nor yet in colour ; the spores said to be four times 
the size are found to be not really a quarter larger than in the 
common form ; in it, as in the variety under consideration, spores 
larger and smaller are found in the same capsule." 
There is more about the leaf cells, but the above is sufficient, and 
is intended for the information of those who have not Schimjoer's 
book.
What Mr. Boswell thinks of F.
gracilis as a species will be clear 
from this passage : — "At p.
553, he (Schimper) has rather a long 
observation which seems to be quite conclusive as to its claims to 
specific rank." 
As to Aulacomnium turgidum from Whernside, I don't know who 
the others were, but I plead guilty to having threatened to publish a 
* Schimper has misquoted the date ; it should be 1865.

discovery so[ interesting and creditable to its finders, if they did not.
It was lately shown at the Linnsean Society by Mr. E.
M. Holmes.
This is stated in the AtJienmm of Dec. 1 1 th, or thereabouts.
FONTINALIS GRACILIS, Lind., &c.
Rev. J.
FERGussoisr.
Fontinalis gracilis.
— When I accidentally mentioned .to Dr.
Lees that in 1876 Professor Barker had gathered Fontinalis gracilis at 
Malham Cove, I also mentioned that so far as I was aware it was new 
to Yorkshire.
Had I then supposed that Dr. Lees was to have 
recorded it in the Naturalist as a moss not known to be a native of 
Britain until it was detected at Malham Cove, I should, in all proba- 
bility, have given him some information as to its British history and 
distribution.
Such information may still be new and interesting to 
Mm, and to others also, and I accordingly send it to you for publica- 
tion.
I believe the first notice which is given of this plant as a native of 
Britain is contained in Wilson's " Bryologia Britannica," where it is 
stated on page 424 — " Two varieties of this {F.
antipyretica), if not 
distinct species, are found in Britain ; one of them with more slender, 
fasciculate, not spreading branches, and less complicated leaves, found 
near Dublin and in Scotland, but we have not seen any specimen in 
fruit.
It is probably var.
^ minor, and is often mistaken for F.
squamma, from which the carinate leaves will always distinguish it." 
These remarks, so far as they go, give a very accurate and character- 
istic description of Fontinalis gracilis, and should be sufficient to enable 
one to distinguish it from our other British species of the genus.
In July, 1866, Messrs.
Roy, Bisset, and myself, when botanising in 
Glen-Prosen, discovered there a barren Fontinalis, which Mr. Roy (the 
only one of us who knew one moss from another) supposed to be F.
squamosa ; and in the following year I again gathered the same plant in 
a barren state, and sent it to Mr. Wilson, who, with his usual caution, 
declined to say whether it was anything but a mere variety of F.
anti- 
pyretica, unless fruit were found and proved to be difi'erent from that 
of the other.
In 1868 or 1869 (I am not quite sure as to the date) 
the Rev. Mr.
Anderson found the plant with abundance of fruit, and 
submitted it to Mr. Wilson, who then pronounced it to be a distinct 
species, and gave it the name of F.
subglohosa.
He was too late in 
106 
The Naturalist.
doing so, for in 1865 Lindberg described and published the same 
plant under the name of F.
gracilis.
Before and since 1869 Mr.
Anderson and myself have distributed the species in great quantities, 
and it has been gathered and distributed to a greater or less extent by 
other botanists.
The species is indeed widely diffused throughout 
Great Britain, from the Shetland Isles in the north to the m_ountains 
of Kerry in the south-east of Ireland, and ranges from about 250 to 
2900 feet.
I was therefore surprised to find that Dr. Lees neither was 
aware, nor suspected, that it was known as a British species previous 
to the date of its discovery at Malham Cove.
It may be the case that no recent work on, or catalogue of, the 
British Mosses makes mention of this and other species which were 
gathered, recognised and distributed before the publication of such 
works.
It would have been extraordinary if such works had been 
complete, but ifc by no means follows that the unpublished is identical 
with the unknown.
However this may be, the notice of Fontinalis 
gracilis as a British species, given in last month's Naturalist, is not the 
first which has appeared : there is an earlier one in a list of mosses 
new to the county of Forfar, which list was published so long ago as 
1869.
It may be useful to know that the plant grows in streamlets, large 
springs, rarely in lakelets, and more rarely still, if at all, in streams 
entitled to the name of rivers.
It will be somewhat difficult for a 
fairly practised eye to mistake it for anything but a Fontinalis.
Diligent search in the field, and careful examination of small forms 
supposed to belong to F.
an,tipy7'etica, will no doubt enlarge the area of 
its distribution south of the Tweed.
I may state that I have specimens 
of the same plant from Wahlenberg's herbarium, named F.
minor, and 
that I think this name rather than Lindberg' s should be used.
Leptotrichum {TricJiost.) tortile, Schrad.
— Schimper describes this 
species as having a compound annulus ; Wilson describes it as having 
a simple one, European and American specimens show that Schimper 
is right ; Castle Howard specimens show that Wilson is right also.
And 
yet the annulus is much more constant in its character than almost any 
other organ of a moss.
Does not this point to a suspicion that our 
British plants may belong to a different species than some of the 
European and American forms I should be much obliged if anyone 
would send me specimens of this moss from any quarter.

ORisriTHOLOGiCAL ISToTES.
— The severe frost which we have witnessed 
during the past three weeks has brought many rare birds here to our 
sheltered districts.
Several flocks of ducks, chiefly wigeons, have been 
seen at Roundhay Park, also two or three water-rails.
A great many 
bramblings, fieldfares, and redwings were also observed.
I saw a redwing 
on the 13th of this month in one of our public streets (North-street).
I 
almost trod upon the bird, for so eagerly was it eating a piece of bread 
that it did not fly away until I was within a yard of it.
Birds at this 
season become very bold.
Robins and sparrows will come into the houses 
if the doors or windows be left open.

BeeedijSTG op Hawfinch.
— It is not without pleasure I have to record 
the breeding of the hawfinch in this district during the year 1878.
I was 
at Mr. P.
Dalton's, Bingley, on the 10th inst, when he showed me an 
immature hawfinch which had been caught at Myrtle Grove, Bingley.
The old birds were observed flying about in the neighbourhood all spring, 
but the nest, as far as I could ascertain, was never found.
I may also add 
that had not the Protection Acts been in force, in all probability the birds 
would have been shot.
This is the only instance I have known of this 
species breeding in this district.

A New British Species of the Gen¥S Achorutes.
— On the 13th Oct.
last I found two specimens of Achorutes similatus, Nicolet, amongst dead 
leaves in the garden, in company with A, purpurescens, Lubbock.
I have 
since searched for it, but have not been able to find any species of 
Achorutes in the same place, doubtless owing to the severe winter.
Sir 
John Lubbock, in his " Monograph of the Collembola and Thysanura," 
gives A .
similatus as being found in Switzerland and France.
Nicolet's 
description (Mem. Soc.
Helv.
1842) is as follows : — Entierement d'un 
gris plombe, non metallique, plus pale en dessous, avec quelques lignes 
longitudinales jaunes tres-peu apparentes sur le dos.
Deux petites taches 
du meme couleur sur le cou.
Yeux d'un noir terne.
Queue pale.
Longuer 1-2 millim.
sur les eaux stagnantes en ete, et dans les terres 
humides, vers la fin de I'automne et en hiver ; vit en societe, tres 
commune." My specimens agree with this description in every particular 
excepting the faint yellow lines on the back ; these I did not see, but 
think there can be no doubt as to the identity.
The antennae are short 
and thick, and do not taper to the apex as in A.
dubius.
A. similatus 
differs from A.
armatus and A.
purpuresceus by the absence of abdominal 
booklets, and also by its uniform dull leaden-grey colour.
A. Texensis of 
Packard, and A .
rdvicola of Fitch, are similar in colour, but both possess 
abdominal booklets.

Seligeria acutifolia in Yorkshire.
— I have to announce the discovery 
of the typical form of Seligeria acutifolia of Lindberg, on dry limestone 
rocks at ArnclifFe, Yorkshire, in June, 1868.
I gathered the moss as a 
form of *S^.
pusilla, but I have lately been giving my collection of Seligerice 
a thorough re-examination, and found that it agreed in every particular 
with Prof.
Lindberg's description.
The typical plant has, I believe, 
hitherto only been known to occur in Scandinavia, but the variety /3 
longiseta was gathered near Buxton, Derbyshire, by Mr. Wilson, so far 
back as 1831, also as a form of S.
pusilla.
I have sent specimens to Mr.
Fergusson, who writes to say that he entirely agrees with me in referring 
them to Prof- Lindberg's 8.
acutifolia, and also that they are decidedly 
the typical form.

Range op Luzula spicata, De Candolle.
— The following notes on the 
above are from unexceptionable sources : — From Dr. Dickie's ''Flora of 
Aberdeen," &c.
: " Upon the large boulders by the roadside between 
Bridge of Invercauld and Castleton : height 1150 feet." Mr. Watson, 
Cyhele Britannica, " Luzula spicata, De Cand.
Descends to 550 or 500 yds.
(1500 feet) in East Highlands." The above in reference to " note " by Dr.
Buchanan White in January No. of Naturalist, mentioning a footnote of 
Mr. F.
A. Lees in Mr. Wood's paper on Cumberland Plants.
— A.
Bennett, Croydon, Surrey, Jan. 2nd.
Range of Luzula spicata in Scotland.
— Dr. White is doubtless quite 
right in his correction that this alpine rush is, as a matter of fact, found 
as- low as 1000 feet in the very north of Scotland.
In my note to Mr.
Wood's paper, intended to point a caution, by a mere lapsus calami I 
wrote " Britain " for " England." Please read the word as " England," 
and my observation is correct ; and the reasons for doubting if Luzula ^ 
spicata really occurs on Blake Fell — quite a minor elevation — remaiiM 
forcible.
In Westmoreland its range is very limited, as is Myosoti^ 
alpestris and some other north of England plants ; and in southern lati- 
tudes one does not expect or find alpines to have such a wide vertical 
range as in northern latitudes.
A descent to 1000 feet at lat.
57° 
(Braemar district is about that) would about correspond thermometrically 
and climatically with 1900 or 2000 feet in north-west Yorkshire, so that, 
looking at the matter in this light, a plant that nowhere in Braemar 
descended below 1000 feet, I should not expect to descend below 1800 
feet in Yorkshire.
Of course in each case we must leave out the casual, 
accidental occurrence of a single specimen or so washed down to a low 
level by some mountain rill in spate, as such occurrences would vitiate 
any calculation as to the climatic range of any plant, for it is mainly the 
temperature that determines a botanical zone.
The range of heat of each 
botanical zone of 900 feet in Britain is about 3 degrees between its lowest, 
and highest limit, but there is also a diminution for latitude independent 
of elevation ; so that, small as is the latitudinal diminution in tempera- 
ture of sea-level in Britain (with its sea-influence climate), compared with 
Rainfall for December.
109 
what it is in central Europe, it is yet, betv^een the extremes of 50 degrees 
(Scilly) and 59 degrees (Orkney), very much more than equivalent to one 
zone in altitude.
The result of this is necessarily a successive overlapping 
of the zones as we proceed from south to north, the zone at sea-level 
changing from the lowest limit (highest in temperature) of inferagrarian 
at lat.
50 degrees, to lowest limit of mid-agrarian at 535 degrees, and to 
super-agrarian at about 57 degrees.
To express this in other words, we 
may say that the altitudinal limit of the lowest zone decUnes from 900 
feet above the sea at Scilly to sea-level at Lincoln ; whilst the upper limit 
of the mid-agrarian zone, which is 900 feet above the sea in Derbyshire, 
declines to sea-level in Forfarshire ; and the upper limit of the super- 
agrarian zone, which begins at 900 feet, and terminates only at 1800 feet, 
in Yorkshire and Westmoreland, dechnes to about 1000 feet in the Scotch 
Highlands, and touches sea-level (almost) in Caithness, and (quite) in 
Shetland.
This digression may serve to explain to some readers of the 
Naturalist a matter not understood by botanists so well as it ought to be, 
and give an inkling why Luzula spicata may be found at 1000 feet in 
Sutherland, and yet hardly a possible occurrence on Blake Fell (960 feet) 
in Westmoreland, for be it noted that I do not for a moment suppose Dr.
White meant to advance the fact of its low descent in the Highlands as a 
reason or argument for its descending so low in England.

— Similar observations to those given 
in the January Naturalist have been made in this extraordinary season.
The jlight and movements of birds yielded interesting observations ; many 
wild geese were recorded Dec. 12, and other flights since, passing over or 
near to Barnsley, a heron on the 15th, also large sea-gulls on Jan. 15th.
Mr. W.
Talbot recorded redshank at Kirkthorp J an.

with white-streaked neck and breast was brought to Mr. Lister on 
Christmas Day ; it is well cared for by a friend.
It will be curious to see 
what change will be developed in confinement.

Halifax, secretary.
On the motion of the president, seconded by Mr.
W. E.
Clarke, a vote of thanks to the committee of the Leeds Mechanics' 
Institute for the use of their building, at a merely nominal charge, for the 
holding of an exhibition, was carried unanimously.
The meeting then 
adjourned to the Albert Hall, where the president delivered the annual 
address, which was of unusual value and very great interest.
The latter 
portion gave an account of Mr. Sorby's own researches into the colouring 
matters of animals and plants — a subject which is peculiarly his own.
A 
vote of thanks was accorded to Mr. Sorby for his address, and his services 
in the chair, on the motion of Mr. Thomas Hick, B.A., B.Sc, seconded 
by Mr. E.
W. Chatwdn.
In connection with this annual meeting, a very 
extensive exhibition of natural history specimens and scientific apparatus 
was organised and held within the Mechanics' Institute from the 10th to 
the 17th January.
This exhibition is the subject of a series of special 
articles, which will appear in future numbers of the Naturalist.

NOTES ON YORKSHIRE MOSSES AND HEPATICS.
By G.
Stabler.
Whilst looking over some recent numbers of the Naturalist, it 
occurred to me that it might be of interest to its readers if I noted 
down a few of the rarer mosses and hepatics which have been 
gathered in the Dent valley, or more correctly speaking, in that part 
of Yorkshire to the left of the Dee, and which joins Westmoreland, 
The lists of Yorkshire mosses and hepatics in my possession are 
the following : — the Musci and Hepaticce of Teesdale, found by Dr.
Spruce ; the list of mosses in Baker's " North Yorkshire "; and 
Hobkirk's "Mosses of the West Riding of the County of York" 
(1873).
I will therefore abstain from mentioning any found in the 
foregoing lists.
I have the permission of my friend Mr. Barnes to say that on the 
27th of December, 1872, he gathered Grimmia conferta on the hills 
growing on a crumbling kind of dark-coloured rock or clay.
In the 
same year I also found Spliagnum teres and Habrodon Notarisii — the 
latter on an ash near the river, and since that time on sycamore near 
the same place.
Dr. Spruce's list is the only one of the three above mentioned 
which includes Hepatica, and being a record of plants observed by my 
eminent friend during one journey in one valley in the county, it is 
necessarily less comprehensive than the lists of the other two 
botanists, and this is why I have to enumerate more hepatics than 
mosses.
In the year 1872 I paid two visits to Dent, and along with many 
other species, were collected the following : — PlagiocJiila spinulosa, 
N. ab E ; Jungermannia Genthiana, N.
ab E.
; J.
pumila, With, ; Sacco- 
gyna viticulosa, Dum.
; Mastigohyum trilobatmn, N.
ab B.
; Lejeunea 
minutiss'ma, Dum.
(on trees) ; Frulla?iia fragilifolia, Tay ; Metzgeria 
conjiigata, Lindb.
; Rehoidla hemispJirica, Radd.
; Pellia calyclna, N.
ab E.' 
On the 1st of September, 1877 (I will not disguise my feelings on 
the occasion) I was delighted to find Lejeunea hamatifolia growing in 
the same district ; and this leads me to think that I could not find a 
more fitting opportunity to place on record something I have done.
It is this : Dr. Moore, of the Royal Botanic Garden, Glasnevin, with 
his usual liberality sent me fine living specimens of Dumortlera irrigua 
N. S., Vol. iv., Mae., 1879.
114 
The Naturalist.
N. ab E., and on my next visit to Dent to get more of the Lejeunea 
Jiamatifolia (alas !
it is rather scarce), I planted a fine healthy 
specimen of the Dumortiera, which I trust will thriye and multiply.
This is now about a year ago.
I am not aware that (Edipodiiim Griffi.tldanum, Schw., has been found 
in Yorkshire, but two or three years ago I found the plant on the 
western slope of Barbon Fell, about two miles from the Yorkshire 
boundary.
In a recent number of the Naturalist Mr. Boswell mentioned my 
name in connection with Hypnum im.povmis, pointing out that the late 
Mr. Wilson was most probably the first to identify the moss as a 
native of Yorkshire.
The specimen I received from him was 
collected on Strensall Common on 8th September, 1869.
On the 
13th of the same month he wrote to me as follows : — " I made last 
Tuesday what seemed to me a desperate attempt at another expedition 
to Strensall Common.
The occasion for selecting that place was 
this, viz., that I had some j^ears ago picked up and kept, without 
knowing its value, a small patch of Hypnum imponens^ and as its 
detection elsewhere is confined to a heath in Sussex, where Mr.
Mitten gathered it about the same time, I was naturally desirous to 
gather more before the Common had become arable land The 
moss being also in better state than the Sussex specimens, though 
without fruit." 
Paludella squarrom.
— As there is only a doubtful habitat given for 
this moss in Hobkirk's list, I think we may come to the conclusion 
that this beautiful moss has become extinct in these islands.
On a 
packet containing a specimen of this moss from Mr. W.
Wilson, a 
few years ago, he wrote " long extinct — always scarce." This remark 
applied to Knutsford Moor.
As Mr. M.
B. Slater and myself were 
most probably the last persons who gathered this plant in England, 
a remark on the subject may not be out of place.
In the year 1868 
and on the 7th of June, Mr. Slater of Malton accompanied me to 
Terrington Car, where he had gathered" the plant in plenty in 1855.
We found the place drained, and producing luxuriant grass, amongst 
which in one place were a few straggling stems of Paludella squarrosa, 
jand near to it was Hypmm nitens in greater quantity.
I have since 
visited the place, and could find neither the Paludella nor the Hypnum.
Amblydegium confervoides^ so far as I know, has not been published 
as found in Yorkshire.
In August of 1871 I found it in the neigh- 
bourhood of Hawnby (Bilsdale) growing on embedded stones amongst 
hazel bushes, &c.j below a scar the name of which I cannot give, but 
Fergusson : The Wharncliffe Dicranum.
115 
which I think formed a part of the eastern side of the Hambleton 
hills.
On the 26th of July, 1876, whilst on a ramble in the North Moors 
with my late lamented friend, Mr. S.
Anderson of Whitby, I found 
Jung, ciirvifolia growing on decayed wood in Blaeberry Gill, and in 
1877 MadofJieca lamgata was gathered by myself in the Shaw Wood, 
at Castle Howard, only in one place.
THE WHARNCLIFFE DICRANUM.
By Rev. J.
Fergusson.
It seems to me to be an exceedingly difficult matter to determine 
this moss ; and that any decision given about it will be likely to give 
rise to diversity of opinion among botanists.
Unfortunately it is in a 
barren state, and the two or three stems which I have of it, and 
which were kindly sent me by Mr. Hobkirk, are so miserable — only 
fragments apparently, — that I have the greatest hesitation in 
hazarding an opinion as to the species to which they belong ; and 
this notice is intended mainly to call out the views of others regarding 
them.
To the naked eye they look not unlike Die. scoparum var.
rupestre, if the specimen which Mr. Boswell has had the goodness to 
send me be an authentic one ; but when placed under the microscope 
they are seen to have an areolation of a type totally different from 
that which any form of Die. scoparum can possibly have.
On first 
seeing Mr. Hobkirk's mounted specimen of the Wharncliffe plant, 
which could not be dissected, and did not show the nerve structure or 
the bases of the leaves sufficiently, I supposed it to belong to D.
fuscescens.
On receiving his unmounted stems, and being at once 
struck with the remarkable papillosity of the pagina of the leaf, I 
concluded that they should be ranked with D.
montanum — a species 
found in several places in England and Scotland.
On more careful 
examination I find that this papillosity is not confined to D.
monta- 
num,^h\it is manifest in undoubted forms of D.
fuscescens, D.fulvum, and 
JJ.
Muhlenbeckii.
From D.
Mvhlenheckii the Wharncliffe plant differs 
iu the nerve bein^ very rough, not quite or nearly quite smooth on 
the back, and in other particulars.
D. fulvum, again, has a very 
broad, thick, flat nerve occupying nearly a third of the base of the 
leaf, the short quadrate cells descend almost or quite to the base of the 
leaf; and the leaf itself is quite different in form and direction.
From D.
montanum our plant differs in the dark green colour, absence 
116 
The Naturalist.
of tomentum (judging from my specimens), firm, not soft, falcato- 
secund leaves whicli are wider at the base, furnished with larger, 
laxer auricles, and a nerve much less depressed ; besides it grows on 
rocks, a thing which D.
montanum does not do, except very 
rarely.
From the ordinary forms of D.
fuscescens it differs much more 
decidedly than from Z).
montanum^ in being almost quite if not wholly 
destitute of the long narrow cells which advance upward from the 
base to about one-fourth the length of the leaf, and in the pagina^ 
being more decidedly papillose, but in these particulars D.
fuscescens 
varies exceedingly.
The nerve of the specimens gathered by Dr.
Parsons is much more that of D.
fuscescens than of D.
montanum.
Whilst fully recognising the close affinity of the Wharncliffe moss 
with B.
montanum, of which it may only be a rock form, I have the 
greatest difficulty in getting clear of the idea that it is closely related 
to specimens which I have from various quarters, which differ in 
aspect most decidedly from every form of D.
montanum which I have 
seen.
Such forms have been gathered at Dunoon by Dr. Stirton ; at 
Pateley Bridge, Yorkshire, by Mr. J.
S. Wesley ; at Staly Brushes 
by the late Mr. Hunt; in Mayo, Ireland, and in various places 
throughout the kingdom.
To me it seems that these cannot be easily- 
included in D.
montanum, but belong fully as much to B.
fuscescens 'j 
and it may be as well to delay deciding definitely what they are until 
better and more abundant specimens are obtained, or to regard them 
in the meantime as belonging to a doubtful variety, if not species, 
and to let it pass under the name of B.
saxicola.
A FORTNIGHT IN THE FENS.
By G.
T. Porritt, F.L.S.
When collecting in the New Forest last year with the Rev. T.
W. 
Daltry, M.
A., F.L.S., of Madeley "Vicarage, we came to the conclusion 
that, as for six or seven years we had kept pretty well to wood 
working, and had " done " some of the most noted localities of that 
character, it would be as well to change the nature of the ground for 
our excursion this year.
Accordingly we decided to try " the fens." 
Of these there are now three portions existing in England ; first, 
a fair extent, Mr. F.
D. Wheeler tells me, still undrained about 
Holme, in Huntingdonshire (the next station to Peterborough, on the 
Great Northern line) ; next, Wicken Fen, a small piece of perhaps a 
mile and a half square, the last relic of the Cambridgeshire fens ; and 
PoRRiTT : A Fortnight in the Fens.
117 
lastly, the Norfolk fens, all of which must be approached through 
Norwich.
These are very extensive, stretching along the course of 
the river Bure, and its tributaries the Ant and Thurne, and the 
" broads " or lakes they form.
These for the most part have to be 
worked by boat, being more water than land, but here and there spots 
are to be found where the ground is pretty firm, only it is necessary 
to take care or you'll get " bogged." These great stretches of fen are 
very similar in character.
Horning and Kanworth, which are 
adjoining parishes, have been worked^ very considerably, but as yet 
Thurne river and its great " broads " are wholly unworked, probably 
from being less accessible, and also very wet, though no doubt they 
would prove as prolific as any of the others.
To return to ourselves.
We had arranged to go to Ranworth in 
preference to the others, as we were very anxious to take Nonagria 
brevitinea, which occurs there only.
We had, however, " reckoned 
without our host," as on writing for lodgings we were told we could 
not be accommodated, and the only other place in the village (which 
is composed of about twenty houses only) where rooms were let, was 
also taken by other lepidopterists.
We had written for and obtained 
permission to work the fens from S.
Gurney Buxton, Esq., of Nor- 
wich, but after all had to give up Eanworth.
We then settled on 
Wicken, and there our application for quarters was fortunately 
successful.
I left Huddersfield on Monday morning, the 22nd of July, by the 
10-5 Great Northern train for Peterborough, expecting to be joined 
by Mr. Daltry at Grantham.
He had not turned up, however, when 
I reached Peterborough, so I went forward as soon as possible to 
Ely, and as I w^as evidently before him there, and knowing that the 
next train would not ariive for more than an hour, T took the oppor- 
tunity of visiting the Cathedral, and was so charmed with its beauty, 
particularly the interior, which is most grand, that I felt grateful for 
the cause which had given me the treat.
Soon after reaching the 
station, the train arrived, and with it my friend.
We at once 
engaged a -conveyance, and were soon on our drive to Wicken, which 
place we reached about seven o'clock.
By the time we had seen our 
rooms, had some tea, and unpacked our lamps, nets, and other 
collecting apparatus, it was getting dark ; still, our longing for a first 
experience of fen-coilecting was so great that we turned out, and 
induced a boy who was at play with a group on the green in front of 
the house, to shew us the way to the fen, which we were glad to find 
was within \qyj easy walking distance, though by the time we reached 
118 
The Naturalist.
the ground it was almost quite dark.
However, finding the fen was 
tolerably dry, we lit the lamps and struck into the thick of the reeds, 
sedges, &c, : and we had evidently hit upon a good place for the local 
Nonagria Hellmanni, as we soon netted a few nice specimens of it- 
Whilst wandering about, the darkness had become intense, and we 
were a little surprised to be visited by a man, who turned out to be 
the village policeman.
Instead of regarding us as suspicious charac- 
ters, however, he seemed to know pretty well what we were about, 
and very kindly put us into the right way of collecting, by fetching a 
long pole, which he stuck upright in the ground, and then fastened 
our lamps to it at a distance of six or seven feet from the ground.
This we found was the orthodox way of collecting in the fens, all other 
methods (at night) being of comparatively little good.
Some won- 
derful lamps, too, are used by the fen collectors ; usually they are 
from twelve to eighteen inches square, and have generally four large 
burners and reflectors.
"When a number of these lamps are on the 
fen at one time, as is often the case, mounted at moderately equal 
distances apart, the fen has somewhat the appearance of being lit up 
with street lamps.
That used by Mr. Wheeler, of Norwich, is a 
monster indeed, and after seeing it we were no longer astonished at 
his marvellous success with the fen moths.
When on the flat fen 
they of course give out a strong light for a long distance all around, 
and on favourable nights moths in the greatest variety — Nocturni, 
Geometr^e, Pseudo-Bombyces, Noctuae, Deltoides, Py rales, Cram- 
bites, and Tortrices come up in swarms, A great many species settle 
at once on the glass p anes, others fly round and round, and are easily 
netted.
It is, however, very uncertain work, as on some nights, 
from certain conditions of the atmosphere, hardly a moth will come, 
whilst perhaps on the very next they come in shoals.
On some of 
the nights we were there the sport was most exciting.
This we found 
to be the case after a warm, dry, but not sunny day ; whereas after a 
wet day, or when a mist rose on the fen, light was of but little use.
Our first night was one of the former, and we were in great glee ; 
but being tired after our long journey, we did not stay out very late, 
but returned to our lodgings, to dream of the wonders we were going 
to do every night after, — dreams, however, which, as usual, were not 
altogether realised.
Perhaps it will be as well to say here that the 
moths come to the lights in the greatest numbers from ten o'clock at 
night to about two o'clock in the morning, midnight being usually 
the very best time.
On setting our captures next morning, we found we had taken 
PoRRiTT : A Fortnight in the Fens.
119 
Nonagria Hellmanni commonly, along with Leucania pudorina, and a 
few lovely L.
phragmitidis.
An Acidalia which came very freely was 
immutata ; this delicate-looking moth we afterwards found was in 
the greatest profusion all over the fen.
Liihosia griseola, too, was in 
capital condition and very common, with many other species.
Having finished our setting, we went out to ascertain what the fen 
looked like by daylight.
We found it was composed of a rich variety 
of vegetation, and indeed was as gay as a garden with bright flowers 
of all colours.
Amongst the plants we recognised were sedge, reed, 
Sagitta sagittifolia, Ly thrum Salicaria, Thalictrum flavum^ Spircea 
Ulmaria, Butomus umbellatus, Eupatorium cannabinum, Vicia, Convol- 
vulus major, Peucedanum palustre, Angelica sylvestris, Symphytum 
offi,cinale, Valeriana oficinalis, Epilobium hirsutum, frogbit, and many 
others.
In the ditches the great water lily was abundant in full 
bloom, its large, lovely white flowers looking like stars on the surface 
of the water.
This varied vegetation altogether forms a tall and 
dense herbage, and, fortunately, is farmed profitably by the holders 
of the fen land.
I say fortunately as a lepidopterist, for, had it been 
useless, the whole of Wicken Fen would doubtless long since have 
been drained and properly cultivated, as indeed the great bulk of it 
(along with all the old surrounding fens) already has been, and as all 
will be sooner or later.
The fact that the Fen hay, as it is called, 
can be used to advantage, however, and made to pay, seems to deter 
some of the holders from going to the necessarily great expense of 
draining.
The dried sedge is used for thatching very extensively in 
the district, nearly the whole of Wicken — houses, stables, sheds, and 
outhouses of all descriptions being closely thatched to the depth of 
towards a foot with this material.
The older thatches, too, are often 
grown over with a thick layer of moss.
Turning from the plants to the lepidoptera, we found there was 
comparatively little to be done in the daytime in the fen.
Odd 
specimens of Hyria auroraria, Hydroelia unca, Liparis salicisj with a 
few Tortrices and Crambites, were about all we picked up as 
images.
Larvae of Eupithecia valerianata were plentiful in the flower 
heads of Valeriana oficinalis, and those of Simyra venosa occurred 
on sedge, but little else.
In the evening we went down again with 
our lamps, when moths were so abundant, in contrast to their appa- 
rent paucity in the daytime, that we marvelled where they had all 
been hid.
The species taken the previous night occurred again, and 
in addition to those previously mentioned, Nonagria despecta^ Miana 
<ircvma, Nudaria senex, Chilo phragmitellus, and Scopaiia pallida were 
120 
The Naturalist.
all abundant.
Litliosia stramineola occurred now and then amongst 
a lot of its brother griseola, and L.
complanula also accompanied 
them.
Mr. Daltry had sugared early in the evening.
This, in the fens, 
takes a good deal more time and labour than it does in the " rides " 
of a wood, for, as you will at once have called to mind, there are no 
tree trunks on which to brush the beguiling liquor.
We found the 
method there was to tie together several of the stems of the reed, or 
sedge, and put the sugar " on the knot formed by the tie.
In this 
way Apamea fibrosa was taken pretty commonly, but little else visited 
the sugar this night.

Deilephila galii near Bradford.

Linota linaria at Cottingley.
— On the 4th February last, I saw a 
mealy redpoll {Linota linaria) feeding upon the seeds of the alder, by 
the side of the river Aire, near Cottingley Bridge.
It was in company 
with lesser redpolls {Linota rvjescens) and as I afterwards found siskins.
So hoary did it appear at the first blush, that I took it to be the Arctic 
form of redpoll {Linota Hornemanni), but I subsequently satisfied myself 
that it was the above mentioned species, though in the absence of any 
clear differentiating features, it is very difficult to identify them beyond 
the possibility of a doubt, without actual examination.
It was, however, 
considerably lighter coloured than the examples of mealy redpolls shot at 
Manywells last year.
As my brother and I were going to the Exhibition 
on the 11th January last, we saw a strange bird which we took to be a 
grey shrike, flying over the railway lines to the south of Shipley Station.
One of this species was shot a few years ago in the Goit Stock Valley, 
and after passing through several hands ultimately got into the possession 
of Mr. P.

Schimper's Synopsis.
— As I am unwittingly the cause of the present 
discussion in the Naturalist on the mistakes in Schimper's Synopsis, 
through making the remark that S.
tristidia was not only new to York- 
shire, but new to England also, I think I can claim a right to have a say 
in the matter.
I have also another reason, and that is, that my name, a3 
the discoverer of several rare mosses, is often omitted or misplaced in the 
Shurt Notes and Queries.
121 
work above mentioned.
The first case I will take is that of Atrichum cris- 
pum, as I was never more surprised than to find that Dr. Wood was given 
as the first detector of the moss in Britain in I860.
I first gathered the 
moss at Stayly Brushes in 1859, and sent it to my lamented old friend, 
John Nowell, to name for me, when he wrote to inform me that he had 
known the plant for several years near Todmorden, and was unable to 
name it, but he had submitted specimens to Mr. Wilson, who said it was 
a form of A.
undulatum.
In the autumn of 1860 Dr. Wood and I made 
arrangements for gathering Climacium dendroides, in fruit in this district, 
when he told me that Mr. Wilson had sent him a mnioid moss from Oak- 
mere, Cheshire.
He described the moss to me, and then I told him that 
it was growing in plenty at Stayly Brushes, which we were then passing.
He told me that he wanted a lot of it for Dr. Schimper, and sent his son 
the following week to go with me to gather it.
He sent specimens to Dr.
Schimper under the name of A.
tenellum, and new to England ; but 
Schimper wrote back to say that it was A .
laxifolium, Wils.
, and new to 
Europe.
The other cases I beg to mention are Bryum turhinatum and 
B. calophyllum.
I deny altogether, as a wilful misstatement, that I and R.
Scholefield detected the moss at the place mentioned, as the locality was 
pointed out to me by R.
Gordon.
In concluding this note, I assert, with- 
out fear of contradiction, that Dr. Schimper has depended mostly on 
Dr. Wood for his information on British mosses for the Synopsis.

Thoughts on Ornithology : Suggested by the Exhibition of the 
Yorkshire Naturalists' Union.
By H.
C. Hewetson, M.R.C.S." Leeds, 
Chas.
Goodall, Cookridge-street, price 6d.
— This is a pleasant little 
review of the ornithological department of the exhibition, preceded by 
some remarks on the study of natural history in general, and of ornith- 
ology in particular.
Several pages are occupied with a critique upon 
the "setting" of preserved birds as generally followed, " mere mummies of 
a former existence,^' and how, considered from an artistic point of view, 
this should be done — a lesson required by not a few professed taxider- 
mists.
We understand the proceeds of the sale of this pamphlet will be 
added to the exhibition fund.

— Annual meeting Feb. 1st, the president 
in the chair.
In the report read by the secretary it was stated that the 
number of members had been increased from 48 to 67.
The excursions 
during the year were — on May 26th, with the Goole Scientific Society to 
Roche Abbey : on June 26th, to Byram Park ; on August 7th, to 
Riccall Common ; on August 21 to Escrick Park ; and on Sept.
11th, to 
Osgodby Woods.
At a council meeting held on April 18th, it was 
suggested by Dr. Parsons that recorders should be appointed to note the 
fauna and flora of the district.
This suggestion was acted upon, and has 
borne good results.
The financial position of the society is satisfactory.
Mr. J.
T. Atkinson, F.G.S., was elected president, and Mr. Wm.
Chees- 
man secretary.
— On Wednesday, Feb. 5th, Mr. Henry Crowther, of the 
Leeds Museum, delivered a lecture on "The Invertebrate Animals." 
After first noticing their position in the animal kingdom, — the broad, 
easily discernable distinctions that separate dead and living matter, 
animal and plant life, and vertebrate and invertebrate animals, — the 
lecturer proceeded to describe typical examples from the different classes, 
orders, &c., which together constitute the great division under consider- 
ation : these (which were illustrated both by diagrams and specimens) 
were treated in their scientific order, the better studied forms being 
dwelt upon at greater length.
In the short time at the disposal of the 
lecturer upon a subject of such magnitude, a pleasant and entertaining 
sketch was evolved in the description of forms of animal life, from the 
simple Gregarina, a parasitical protoplasmic particle common in the 
intestine' of the cockroach, &c., to the cuttlefishes of our seas.
Of all the 
incidents detailed, those which showed the development of protoplasm, 
and its adaptability to the varied wants of many of the lowly forms of 
animal life, and the marvellous evolution of free swimming jelly-fishes, 
from gonophores or generative buds in zoophites were most striking and 
interesting.

Yorkshire Naturalists' Uxion.
— Exhibition.
— In connection with 
the annual meeting of the Union, held in Leeds in January, 1879, was 
organised and kept open for a week a very extensive and valuable exhibi- 
bition of natural history specimens and scientific apparatus.
A series of 
special articles on the various departments having been arranged for, to 
be published from time to time in the Naturalist, it is unnecessary for 
us here to enter into details.
The credit of fiurst suggesting that there 
should be an exhibition, as well as efiiciently supporting it in every 
stage, is due to the Bamsley Naturalists' Society, and Mr. A.
B. Kell, 
C.E., of that town, on whose proposition it was that the Union resolved 
upon the venture.
The labour of getting up the aifr.ir — no slight task — 
of course devolved upon the members resident in the town where it was 
to be held.
The result, however, of that labour was an exhibition the 
like of which for extent, value, and interest has never been equalled in 
REroRTS OF Societies.

the county.
The directors of the Leeds Mechanics' Institution shoTred 
their sympathy mth the undertaking by granting the use of an extensive 
series of rooms at a merely nominal charge.
The principal room -was the 
large Albert Hall, which, suitably decorated, and containing an extensive 
series of aquaria and tables for microscopes, was mostly reserved for 
promenade, and formed an attractive rendezvous for all visitors to the 
exhibition.
On one side of this central !tall "were the picture galleries, 
devoted to a magnificent show of birds on the walls, and insects on the 
tables.
At the other side of the great hall were rooms on the same floor 
devoted to physical science and conchology, while above these were those 
set apart for geology and botany.
Each of these rooms forms the subject 
of a special article.
It may, however, be here pointed out that the walls 
of the conchological room were devoted to the exhibition of a splendid 
series of original drawings of acari, and of other microscopical objects, 
lent by IVIr. Tuffen West, F.L.S., the eminent natural history draughts- 
man, a native of Leeds.
A conversazione was organized for the first 
night, special attractions being provided, inducing the phonograph by 
the London Stereoscopic Company, the harmonograph, IMr. J.
Wood's 
patent atmospheric stereoscope, numerous demonstrations, and a large 
microscopic display.
The band of the Leeds Rifles performed selections 
of music, and at the commencement the exhibition was formally opened 
by the president of the Union, jNIr. H.
C. Sorby, F.R.S., and speeches 
delivered by Mr. Edwd.
Atkinson, F.L.S., F.Z.S., president of the Leeds 
Naturalists' Club, Mr. John Barran, M.P., and Prof.
A. H.
Green, M.A., 
F.G.S., of the Yorkshire College.
The next day (Saturday, the 11th of 
January) was the members' day, being the date of the annual meetings 
and the president's address.
A series of demonstrations and short 
lectures, and selections on the pianoforte, were delivered every evening 
during the ensuing week.
Mr. John Holmes gave a course of lectures on 
Prehistoric Implements, from Flint to Bronze," on " Early Metals and 
their uses," and '^Pottery from Prehistoric times to Wedgwood." 
Nearly every evening a party of visitors was conducted by Mr. C.
H. 
Bothamley round the ph^'sical science department.
Addresses in the 
geological room were given by Messrs.
B. Howgate, F.G.S., and Thos.
W. Bell.
Lectures on " Ferns " and on '^Mosses " were given by Mr, 
Thos.
Hick, B.A., B.Sc.
; "Hints on Collecting" by Dr. Parsons, of 
Goole : on "The Micro-Spectroscope" by IVIr. Henry Pocklington, 
F.R.M.S.
; on "Gems and their Colours" and on "Vibrations and 
Musical Pitch," by IMr. S.
Jefferson, F.C.S.
; on " The Flora of West 
Yorkshire" by Mr. Wm.
West; and on "The Transformations of 
Lepidoptera" by Mr. W.
H. Taylor.
Pneumatical experiments were 
conducted by Mr. Crebbin, demonstrations with the telephone and 
microphone by IMr. T.
Cuttriss, while microscopes were constantly on 
view.
The exhibition finally closed on Friday, the 17th January, audit 
is satisfactory to add that not a single breakage can be attributed to the 
committee or their officials.

The Naturalist.
Report on the Conchological Department.
— The conchological portion of 
the exhibition was, owing to the limited space at the disposal of the 
section, not* so comprehensive as could have been desired ; as far as it 
went it was, however, everything that could be wished.
The exhibitors 
were four in number, viz : W.
Nelson of Leeds, Robert Scharff of 
Bordeaux, J.
W. Taylor of Leeds, and J.
Wilcock of Wakefield.
The 
largest exhibitor was Mr. Nelson, who, in addition to his fine collection 
of Limnoeadce (of which group he has made a brilliant speciality) showed 
several drawers of Clausilice, Pupm, Helices, &c., which contained shells 
of great interest to students of Yorkshire conchology, as Pupa sempronii, 
P. secale, var.
edentula, &c.
The Limnseadse, which filled five large show 
cases, are a family interesting for the subtle variation of their forms, and 
their wide dispersal over the globe.
The collection embraced specimens 
of some of the rarest species, and several that are as yet undescribed.
The 
common Lmmcea peregra was represented by a large number of tablets 
which clearly showed that this species, under different names, is found 
throughout the world, the latest locality added being Tasmania, where it 
was found and described as new, under the name of Limncea hohartonen- 
sis, by the Rev. Teniso'^e Woods.
Many of the variations of this species 
described and named as distinct by foreign and British authors, were 
also represented.
The special feature of this magnificent collection is its 
wealth of examples showing the variations of the group, not only in our 
own country but throughout the globe.
Mr. Scharflf's exhibit is a small 
but beautiful collection of 38 species and varieties of the land and fresh- 
water shells of the department of the Gironde, France — all collected by 
himself in the environs of Bordeaux.
The collection has many points of !
interest, one of the most striking being the variations of our English species, 
as Unio Bequienii, &c., the series of variations in Cyclostoma elegans and 
Helix virgata are specially noteworthy.
Mr. Taylor exhibited a portion 
of his collection of Helices, formed mainly with the view of elucidating s 
the affinities of the many forms that have been so prodigally described as < 
new by foreign conchologists, and to illustrate variation as influenced by \ 
geographical distribution and physical surroundings.
The series of the » 
various reputed species of Xerophila and Tachea were of considerable 
interest.
In the latter subgenus was a number of tablets of H.
hortensis, j 
var.
hyhrida — a shell u^Don the identity of which a considerable amount 4 
of error and misconce^Dticm exists amongst Yorkshire conchologists.
Mr. t 
Wilcock, who is so well and favourably known as a diligent and successful i 
conchologist, exhibited his collection of the land and fresh-water shells of i 
Yorkshire, many of the species having been found by himself in the I 
neighbourhood of Wakefield.
He also exhibited a collection of models of 
their animals, made and coloured from nature by himself, to which 
subject he has given considerable attention.
The collection is well known 
to most Yorkshire conchologists, and embraces several shells of consider- 
able interest.

Naturalists' Union, held at Leeds on January- 11th, it was decided to 
ublrsh a LIST, with localities, &c., of the Lepidoptera of the county of 
ork.
Its compilation was placed in the hands of Mr. W.
Prest, of 
York, and myself.
May I ask, therefore, that every lepidopterist who has 
collected in any part of Yorkshire will kindly send list with localities of all 
the species noticed, with any notes that may be of use, to me, as early as 
convenient.
I need scarcely say that all such assistance shall be fully 
acknowledged,

A FORTNIGHT IN THE FENS.
By G.
T. Porritt, F.L.S.
( Concluded.) 
It is needless to particularise each day's doings separately, as we 
spent them very much alike.
From the second morning, however, 
we generally beat over the thatched sheds and stables in the daytime 
on our way to the fen, and in this way secured several species we 
might otherwise have missed.
Perhaps the best species taken was 
the very local Aylossa cuprealis.
I think we were as much pleased 
with this moth as with any we took on our excursion, as it was totally 
unexpected, and indeed I did not know any locality where it was 
taken.
The first two were found by Mr. Daltry in spiders' webs, on 
July 24th, and were of course dead ; fine living ones were found 
afterwards, but never more than one or two in a day, though these 
were in different spots miles apart.
One of them very obligingly 
deposited a few eggs, which hatched in due course, and I hope I have 
the larvae now feeding.
No doubt the species would be found 
generally distributed in Cambridgeshire if well looked for.
As was natural amongst so much moss-covered thatch, the Scoparia 
were in great force, though this was more in numbers than variety.
The best was lineolalis, but it was not common ; cembroe also occurred 
occasionally, but mercuralis was in profusion ; on the sides of two 
sheds in particular this species might have been taken almost every 
day in scores.
They varied very much in size and colour, some being 
small and dull, others, females particularly, being large, dark, and 
every marking clearly and distinctly defined.
On the fen in the daytime, in addition to the species mentioned 
previously, we were very pleased to find the larvae of Papilio Machaon 
in tolerable plenty.
We were evidently rather too late to see the 
imago on the wing, though it must have been out a considerable 
time, as the larvse were of every stage of growth.
The very small 
ones were insignificant-looking things, being dingy black, with pale 
patch on the back, but the larger ones were gorgeous creatures.
They were generally easily found, their intensely bright green and 
black, with red spots, shewing most conspicuously, especially as they 
were usually on the upper side of the higher leaves of the wild carrot.
Even when not seen directly, their habit of feeding at once betrayed 
their presence, as they strip off every vestige of leaf down one side of 
the plant, leaving the bare midribs, whilst the leaves on the other

The Naturalist.
side of the plant are often perfectly entire.
Though most were on 
the carrot, some were found eating with evident relish the common 
Angelica sylvestris.
Another very pretty larva, though belonging to a totally different 
order, was that of Cidaria sagittata ; these we found on the seeds of 
Thalictrum flavum, but, unlike Machaon, they required very close 
searching for.
Other larvae taken during our stay included fine Smerin- 
thus ocellatus on shoots of willow ; the green and brown forms of the 
beautiful and singular Ohoerocampa Elpenor'^ a G^ssus ligniperda 
crawling on the inn floor, perhaps strayed from the trunk of one of 
the fruit-trees in the garden ; Saturnia carpini ; Pterophorus micro- 
dactylus in the stems of Eupatorium ; and others.
Passing from larvae to the species taken in the imago state, the 
list is much longer, as might be expected.
Of the rarer species 
we were very pleased to take five fine Orgyia coenosa ; three on the 
night of the 26th July, and two more two or three days later.
This 
moth, though formerly abundant in the fens, is now exceedingly rare, 
occurring in Britain only at Wicken, and there very sparingly.
Last 
year only two specimens were taken, we were told, and this season 
only eight, five of which fell to my share, making the largest number 
to one net for several years.
We were very desirous of getting 
Macrogaster arundinis also, but were unsuccessful, though two were 
taken one night by a local collector at his lamp, at no great distance 
from ours ; this of late years has been considered purely a Wicken 
moth, until this season, when two were taken at Ranworth by Mr.
Fletcher.
Another peculiarly Wicken species, and until Mr. Wheeler's 
lamp turned it up a few years ago, hardly known in Britain, is Nascia 
cilialls.
June is the proper month for the species, but on the night 
of the 26th July (the coenosa night), as we were coming off the fen, 
one of the local collectors showed us a specimen he had taken at his 
lamp, remarking at the time that he had never known it to occur so 
late.
Judge of our surprise, then, next morning, when Mr. Daltry 
turned out his boxes, to find that he also had unknowingly taken a 
specimen, and a fair one too.
These were the only two secured during 
our stay, though we worked hard afterwards to get another.
Another 
rare species we took rather commonly was Tortrix dumetana.
It flew 
just at dusk, and was then easily netted ; later it came to the sugared 
flowers, and also to the lamps.
And now for the common species, and we will run through them 
more rapidly, as to particularise each at length would take up too 
much time, and is moreover unnecessary.

Vanessa lo flew about the lanes ; V.
cardid on the edge of the fen ; 
Satyrus Janira and Tithonus of course everywhere ; Chortohius Pam- 
philus on the fen ; Hesperia linea, and I think also Sylvanus ; a dead 
specimen each of Zeuzera cbscuU and Cossus ligniperda ; Chelonia caja 
and Odonestes potatoria were perfect plagues ; both species were most 
abundant, and came up to the lamps in numbers, banging against the 
glass, and then stunned by the blow, fell to the ground and went 
" fizzing " and spinning about, a number creating quite a concert.
Others would persist in getting into the nets, or would crawl about 
our heads and shoulders, whilst frequently a precocious individual — 
generally a potatoria — would actually crawl through the opening at 
the top of the lamp and get inside, sometimes putting out the light, 
A variety of the male, of the same colour as the female, was not 
uncommon.
The second brood of Arctia fuliginosa (and very large 
specimens they were) also came to the lamps.
We were previously 
under the impression that this species was solely a day flier.
Liparis 
auriflua and -L.
salicis, with Bomhyx neustria and B.
quercus were 
common of course.
Uropteryx sambycata occurred in the lane; 
whilst the geometers which came to the lights on the fen included 
the July brood of Selenia illunaria, Crocallis elinguaria, Ennomos 
tiliaria, Acidalia scutulata (in abundance), A.
bisetata, A.
emarginata^ 
some very pretty banded forms of Cabera exanthemaria ; large golden 
specimens of Strenia clathrata were very common j Abraxas grossu- 
lariata swarmed everywhere, occurring on the fen, and in all the 
lanes and gardens ; Larentia pectinitaria, Eupithecia succenturiata and 
dbsynthiata ; Coremia unide7itaria in profusion ; Phibalapteryx lignata 
in fine condition, and common; Cidaria testata and fulvata, &c.
Belonging to other orders two fine Ptilodontis palpina came, and 
when settled looked for all the world like bits of rotten wood ; Noto- 
donta ziczac (second brood) came to other collectors' lamps, though 
not to ours ; Miana arcuosa was very common ; Herminia tarsipen- 
nalis Bind cribralis Pyrausta purpuralis\ the four "China-marks," 
Cataclysta lemnalis, Paraponyx stratiotalis, Hydrocampa nymphoealis 
and stagnalis were all common ; Crambus pascuellus, C.
perlellus, and 
C. selasellus ; Rhodophoea marmorella and R.
suavella ; and a number 
of others.
" Sugar " on the fen produced Nonagria Helmanni ; Leu- 
cania phragmitidis, with lithargyria, impura, and pallens ; Miana furiin- 
cula, -including a very small form which puzzled us considerably for 
some days ; M.
literosa ; Caradrina alsines; Agrotis nigricatis and A.
ravida ; Tryphcena interjecta commonly (also flying about in the fens, 
and in the lanes in the daytime), with T.
fimbria, orbona, and j)ronuba ;

The Naturalist.
very fine Noctua mhi and umbrosa ; Gonoptera libatrix ; Mania typica, 
&c.
Species taken away from the fen included, besides many of the 
fen moths, Acidalia incanaria, Cilix spinula^ Herminia proboscidalis, 
Botys verticalis (in swarms), B.
fuscalis, Scopula lutealis, Crambus 
pinetellus, Melia sociella, and the pretty PteropJwrus pentadactylus in 
profusion.
One day, calling at Bailey's (a local collector) house, he 
showed us an old beehive from which he was breeding plenty of the 
interesting Galleria cerella, along with the more generally common 
MelipJiora alveariella.
I did not take much interest in the micro-lepidoptera, but Mr.
Daltry worked hard amongst them, and took (chiefly on the fen, 
though some were beaten out of thatch, &c.) a good many species.
Of Tortrices, besides Tortrix dumetana already alluded to, T.
heperana 
and T.
costana ; Veronea ShepJierdana was common, after Mr. Warren 
of Cambridge had shown us the right way of looking for it : this was 
to go on one's knees and carefully search on the ground close to the 
roots of the various fen plants.
Half-a-dozen specimens would thus 
sometimes be found at a single bunch of Eupatorium.

Sericoris fuligana.
Of Teineina, Orthotalia sparganella came to the 
lights, but only DepressaricE were taken much account of.
Of them, 
no less than nine species occurred, viz., liturella, arenella, subpupin- 
quella, conterminella, angelicella, carduella, yeatiella^ applaneMa, and 
pastuciardla.
This I think will finish our list.
The reader will already have formed a fair idea of what Wicken 
itself is like.
It is a rural village of the first type ; its low, white, 
thatched cottages, overgrown with vines and other creeping plants, 
with neat little flower gardens and bigger kitchen gardens attached, 
have a charming effect, and the liking for the place grew on us day 
by day.
The church is at one end of the village, and would certainly 
be the better for " restoration," though I do not approve of the 
restoration of old churches generally.
Though very interesting, it is 
one of the most " tumble-down " places we have seen for a long time, 
and is propped on two sides.
It would make a good hunting-ground 
for the botanist, being overgrown with lichens, mosses, grasses, and 
various plants.
Probably the " old complaint " operates here, as in 
many other parishes.
The vicar is an exceedingly nice person, and 
evidently greatly respected by his parishioners.

the Sunday afternoon, to ask Mr. Daltry to take the evening service ; 
however, as we had previously arranged to go to Soham Church, at 
the market town two miles away, he was unable to do so.
We left Wicken on Saturday morning, August 3rd, and had a 
pleasant drive to Ely, where in a corner at the railway station I 
boxed our last moth — a nice specimen of Aglossa ciiprealis 1 We had 
a nice run to Peterborough, where, having some time to wait, we 
examined the old Cathedral, the grand ancient Norman arches of 
which are something to be remembered.
And thus ended our 
excursion.

NOTE ON THE NEW BKITISH MOSS AULACOMNION 
TURGIDUM, 
By E.
M. Holmes, F.L.S.
The history of the discoTery of this moss is as follows : — Mr. West, 
a Bradford botanist, during a botanical excursion with Mr. F.
Arnold 
Lees in the North Riding of Yorkshire, gathered some moss which 
was supposed at the time to be Aulacomnion palustre^ a species which is 
of common occurrence in Britain.
On returning home, however, and 
re-examining it, Mr. Lees thought that it seemed to differ from that 
plant, and forwarded specimens to Mr. Boswell of Oxford, and the 
Rev. J.
Fergusson of Brechin.
By the latter gentleman it was 
identified as Aulacomnion turgidum — a verdict in which Mr. Boswell 
ultimately agreed.
Mr. Fergusson's attention being thus called to 
the plant, he found among some mosses collected by Prof.
Barker in 
1871, some specimens of the same plant gathered on the Breadalbane 
mountains.
Aulacomnion palustre being a very variable plant — in the south of 
Europe sometimes attaining a length of a foot or more, while in 
Greenland and Labrador it becomes less than one inch, in fact as 
small as A.
androgyrtum^ and sometimes assuming the habit of A.
turgidum — I may perhaps be pardoned for pointing out what seem to 
me to be the differences between the two species.
A. turgidum has 
leaves which are imbricated and erect, both in the wet and dry state ; 
they are obtuse and concave, only about half the length of those of 
A, palustre^ and their broadest diameter is usually above the middle 
of the leaf.
The cells of the leaf are also more sharply and regularly 
134 
The Naturalist.
angular than in that species.
From the varieties of A .
palustre which 
resemble it in habit, A.
turgidum may be known by the leaves being 
convex and not depressed at the base near the nerve.
In Aulacomnion 
palustre the leaves are much longer and more tapering, the broadest 
diameter being usually rather below the middle of the leaf.
The 
leaves are spreading when moist, but when dry each leaf becomes 
spirally twisted, and the back of the leaf near the nerve is seen to be 
depressed or concave.
The occurrence of this species in Yorkshire is of some little 
interest, because the plant has hitherto been considered to be almost 
exclusively a northern species, occurring in Greenland, Norway, 
Sweden, and Lapland, usually in company with other northern species 
such as Paludella squarrosa and .Hypnum nitens.
It has however been 
recorded from the Styrian Alps at an elevation of 2100 feet, but i 
a sterile condition.
In the " Bryologia Europoea," Prof.
Schimper describes the leave 
of Aulacomnion turgidum as perfectly smooth.
I find, however, hot' 
in specimens collected by him, and in those gathered in Britain, that 
this remark can apply only to the upper leaves, the lower being more 
or less papillose, although to a much less extent than in A.
palustre.
PHCENOLOGIOAL OBSERVATIONS ON MOSSES.
By Geo. Brook, ter., F.L.S.
A RECENT number of the " Revue Bryologique " contains a paper by 
Mr. H.
W. Arnell on the above subject.
The plan adopted is similar 
to that already in use in this country for other branches of natural 
history.
Thirty-three species of widely distributed mosses are chosen 
for observation, and records are required on two points : first, as to 
when the moss blooms, and second, as to when the fruit ripens.
Mr.
Arnell considers a moss in bloom when in at least two " flowers " one 
or two archegonia are opened, while the others are still closed and 
uncoloured.
If archegonia are not accessible, the antheridia may be 
observed, but care should be taken to see that the antherozoids have 
really swarmed, and not to be satisfied with an appearance of full 
development when the antheridium may not open for months after- 
wards.
Mr. Arnell's plan of observing approximately the date of blooming 
is to collect specimens weekly or fortnightly about the supposed time 
of fertilisation, and then at leisure to determine the time.
Mr. Arnell 
Brook: Phcenological Observations on Mosses.
135 
considers a moss to have ripe fruit when five to ten lids are detached 
from a specimen in situ.
The lids are detached from dried specimens 
often before ripe.
The following is a list of the species to be observed, 
and the various dates, so far as Mr. Arnell has observed them, for 
Hernoesand, Sweden : —

blossom about midsummer, and ripen their fruit six to eight months 
afterwards.
Eypnum Crista-castrensis requires sixteen to twenty-one 
months to ripen its fruit, Polytrichum commune thirteen months, and 
so forth.
This will explain the meaning of the figures in the second 
column.
All the mosses given in the list are British species, except 
Dicranum undulatmn, but many are rare or seldom found in fruit in 
this country, and so I would suggest for our own observations that 
the following common species be added to the list : — Sphagnum cymhi-

THE AUTUMN FLOEA OF WHERNSIDE : 
AN ACCOUNT OF AN EXCUESION IN SEAECH OF MOSSES.
By F.
a. Lees, F.L.S., and W.
West.
We left Dent Station one morning last August during a heavy 
shower of rain, and took our way towards the marble works, 
collecting the following as we went : — Blindia acuta, Bitrichum Uexi- 
caule, OrtJiotricJium cupulatum, Ulota Bruchii, Targionia hypophylla, 
Galium Molliigo, and Rom tomentosa, var.
scabriuscula.
From the 
marble works we crossed the wet meadow upland to Great Blake 
Gill, both sides of which we hastily worked.
(We believe this little 
gill would well repay a thorough working.) We found here Gym- 
nodomum rupjesire, Ziena julacea, Plagiothecium pulchellum, Bryum 
p^eudo-triquetrum, Breutdia arcuata, &c.
We now ascended the north-eastern shoulder to the spring, where 
the water rushes out of the hillside with great force at an altitude of 
1800 feet, picking up in the ascent (as we trod on Ruhus Ghamcemorus) 
Hyiocomium loreum, Sphagnum intermedium, S.
papillosum, and Aulacom- 
nion turgidum ; specimens of this latter moss were determined by Mr.
Boswell at the end of August, and we should have announced it ere 
this but for an arrangement we had made to work the same route in 
November, when we hoped to bring away a fair quantity of the moss 
for distribution, as unfortunately we only found a small quantity 
of it among the mosses we had collected that day, but unforeseen 
circumstances have postponed our intended journey.
We have since 
learnt that it has been collected by Prof.
Barker also on a north-east

slope in the Breadalbane mountains seven years ago, but was not 
determined until last October or November.
Its occurrence in a similar 
cold aspect in Scotland seems to point out that it is a moss which may 
have been more abundant when our climate was colder.
About the 
spring was plenty of Selajindla sdagbioides, and close by we found 
Fua alpina.
Zieria julacea we again found here, and other good mosses.
Along the morass and slope of Greensell Crags we found Encalypta 
ciliata, Racomitrium lamgmosiim, Polytrichum formosum^ P.
strictum, 
&c.
; we also noted Asplenium viride and A.
tricliomanes, var.
ariceps, 
and just before commencing the ascent of the steep east slope, we 
found Sphagnum plumosum and S.
cuspidatim, then in the steep ascent 
Racomitrium Tieterostichum^ var.
alopecurum^ R.
canescejis, R.
fascicular 
Andreaa petrophila and OrtJiotriclium rupestre, and also Lycopodium 
alpimim, L.
Selago, and L.
clavatum, with a great abundance of vipa- 
rous Festuca ovina.
The bare patches of soil about the summit-ridge 
to the cairn, are covered with tufts of Oligotriclium hercynicum, and on 
the well-top near the cairn we found Grimmia Donniana.
In des- 
cending to Ribble-head by the crags we found small patches of 
Encalypta ciliata again, along with several of the mosses already 
mentioned, — in fact some of the mosses mentioned we found nearly 
all along our route.
On the edge of the crags were Sesleria coeriilea, 
Alsine verna, AleJier/iilla vulgaris, var.
montana, and Draba while 
in the swamp below Hypnum stramineum was growing about the roots 
of Pedicidaris palustris, A little below here we had to wade the swollen 
stream, noticing all about an abundance of Epilobium paladre var.
ligu-

The following were among the mosses we found that day : — 
Funaria hygrometrica Climacium dendroides 
Philonotis fontana Homalothecium sericeum

Bryum csespiticium Brachythecium rivulare

other plants on the same route, 28 of which we observed at an 
altitude of above 2000 feet.
Obituary — Fkedeeick Smith.
— It is but fitting that a Yorkshire 
journal should notice the great loss which entomological science has 
sustained by the death of a man who has contributed more than any- 
other to the working out of the hymenopterous fauna of the county.
For 
the full record of the obligations under which he has laid the naturalists 
of this county, it will suffice to refer to the lists of Yorkshire hymenoptera 
in the Trans, of the Yorksh.
Nat. Union for 1877 and 1878.
Many 
seasons have been spent by him.
in the iavestigation of our hymenopterous 
fauna — some of them in company with INIr. Talbot of Wakefield ; and 
many of his new species were described from Yorkshire specimens.
Frederick Smith was born in London Dec. 30, 1805.
Of early artistic 
inclinations, he began life as an engraver, and in after days his own and 
other papers profited by his ability to execute the plates.
His tastes 
gradually inclining him more and more to science, he eventually, on the 
death of Sdwd.
Doubleday in 1850, received an appointment in the 
Zoological Department of the British Museum, an officer of which he 
remained to the day of his death.
In the same year he became a member 
of the Entomological Society, of which for many years he was on the 
Council, usually as a vice-j)resident, and in his turn he occupied for two 
years the presidential chau\ In 1855 he published his monograph of 
British bees, followed in 1858 by one on the ants, wasps, and fossores.
About the same time he published a series of catalogues of the Aculeate 
Hymenoptera in the Museum, besides enriching by his pen all the entomo- 
logical periodicals, and the Transactions of the Linnean, Zoological, and 
Entomological Societies.
In 1876 he brought out a second edition of his 
^'British Bees," and kept up his hterary work to the last.
He died 
suddenly in London, at the age of 73, on the 16th February last.
Of 
high general culture, a ripe Shakespearian scholar, of literary ability, of 
kindly and amiable disposition, his companionship was highly appreciated 
by his friends, while his popularity in the Entomological Society is 
attested by the frequency with which he was a vice-president.
His 
scientific reputation may safely be permitted to rest upon his published 
works, which include various important monographs.
Montaigne says he 
would have every one write what he knows, and as much as he knows, 
but no more," and this sentence is eminently characteristic of Frederick 
Smith.
He was a specialist who knew his own subject well, and gave his 
fellow-men the benefit of his knowledge.
He avoided two common 
errors : on the one hand he did not suffer his knowledge of his own 
speciality to perish with him : on the other he refrained from writing on 
subjects which he had imperfectly studied.
His name will never perish, 
for it is associated with a long roll of species of which he was the describer, 
or which were dedicated to him by his friends.
May we hope that among 
the small band of English hymenopterists there may rise up one who 
shall take the prominent place which was so long held — first by William 
Kirkby, and then by Frederick Smith.— W.

Baknsley Naturalists' Society.
— Meeting March 4th.
— Observations 
of birds from this neighbourhood and other places were made.
Not much 
was reported of insects and flowers, which are late in appearing.
Feb. 6th, a sandpiper noted in the Dearne valley ; I7th, yellow hammer, 
also the great tit ; 21st, many corn buntings at Day House, among the 
stacks ; a golden plover, among peewits, redwings, &c., found dead ; 
26th, flocks of starlings reappear ; 27th, chaffinches in song ; March 3rd, 
a gannet shot at Carlton, near Barnsley, not recorded in this neighbour- 
hood before ; 8th, grey wagtail seen at Cudworth, brood rarely noted 
this severe season — kingfishers, a few bullfinches noted at intervals ; 
12th, pied wagtails reappear near houses, these residents and others, 
as larks, buntings, and thrushes, partially disappearing during the intense 
frosts.
J. E.
Palmer, formerly of Huddersfield, writes from Dublin that 
the birds are dying by hundreds ; he had dissected two thrushes, a star- 
ling, sparrow, &c., found dead, and their crops were empty except that 
the thrushes and starlings had remains of snail shells.
Mr. Talbot writes 
(March 3rd) to record two Canadian geese, a hawfinch, and two female 
merlins.
On one day, during a fall of snow, were noted eight common 
and thirteen yellow buntings, six chaffinches, five greenfinches, and two 
mountain finches.
Of waterfowl in that part and at Cold Hiendley dam, 
which supplies the Barnsley and Wakefield canal, have been seen many 
wild ducks, including golden-eye, wigeon, pochard, and scaup duck.
Mr.
E. Hailstone, of Walton Hall, informed me on March 7th that on the 
breaking up of the frost early in March there were 400 waterfowl on the

lake.
The birds which generally stay on the estate have required more 
than their usual supply of Indian corn, yet some Brent geese and wigeon 
perished.— T.
Lister.
Bradford Naturalists' Society.
— Meeting Feb. 18th, Mr. lUing- 
worth in the chair.
— Mr. Firth gave the first part of a paper on ^' The 
Birds of the Bradford district/' enumerating all the birds that have as 
yet been recorded for the district, 128 in number, with their comparative 
rarity or otherwise, as well as their geographical distribution.
Meeting March 4th, the president in the chair.
— H.
rnpicapraria was 
shown from Shipley, and Flustra foliacea from Ireland.
Mr. Crebbin 
gave a paper on " Field Geology," in which he described hill-shaded and 
contour maps, and said that the latter were the best.
He also described 
the other kinds of geological maps.
Using a clinometer, he showed how 
to ascertain the true dip of a bed, and how, after a little experience, an 
observer can say what such and such surface beds are by the appearance 
of the escarpments.
He then described minutely the local geology of a 
section of the Aire valley from Idle Hill to Baildon Hill, with its out- 
lying coal measures, including the sectional appearance of a large esker 
below Shipley.
— Wm. West, Sec.
Elland-cum-Greetland Naturalists' Society.
— Monthly meeting 
March 3rd, at West Yale, the president in the chair, who exhibited a 
grey gull, and eggs of the nightingale.
Mr. B.
Noble read a short sketch 
of the Life of Robert Dick, the Thurso Baker.
— W.
H. Stott.
GooLE Scientific Society.
— Meeting Jan. 17th.
— The reports of the 
recorders in conchology, botany, meteorology, and geology were sub- 
mitted.
The Bev. B.
D. Maxwell's list of mollusca contained seventy 
species and seven varieties.
The localities were arranged in four columns 
according to the several vice-counties coming within the Goole district.
Mr. Birks, in his report on Botany, enumerated 61 species of flowering 
plants added to his previous list during the past year, among them being 
Eanunculus Jiuitans, Arabis perfoliata, Trifolium filiforme, Astragalus 
glycyphyllos, Peucedanum palustre, Carduns pratensis, Limosella aquatica, 
and Scutellaria minor.
Dr. Parsons submitted a report on the meteor- 
ology of the past year, illustrated with tables ; and also read a report on 
geology, in the first part of which he recapitulated the observations which 
had been made at the several excursions of the society during the past 
summer, and in the second part gave a summary of the information 
which he had been able to obtain from well borings and other sources.
Recent well borings had shown that the line of junction between the 
keuper marls and bunter sandstone passed under Goole, beneath the 
covering of alluvial deposits ; and from comparison with other sections it 
was shown that the dip of the strata was 92 feet per mile, to the east ; 
this would give 700 feet as the thickness of the keuper, and 1270 feet 
that of the bunter.

— A deputation was appointed to wait on Mr.
Creyke, lord of the manor of Rawcliffe, with reference to the preservation 
from enclosure of such parts of the Rawcliffe rabbit hills as were the most 
interesting to students of natural history.
A germinating cocoa-nut was 
exhibited, showing the enlarged pear-shaped fleshy cotyledon within the 
cavity of the albumen.
A paper was read by Mr. H, T.
Gardiner, on 
" Some points of local history." 
Meeting, Mar. 14th.
— A collection of lichens was exhibited by Dr.
Parsons, who described and pointed out the characters of that order of 
plants, and showed the way to examine them microscopically.
He also 
submitted lists of the cryptogamia of the district, which at present 
included 140 mosses, 22 hepaticse, 57 lichens, 179 fungi, and 80 algse.

Leeds Naturalists' Club and Scientific Association.
— 322nd 
meeting, Feb. 18th.
— The chairman, Mr. Benj.
Holgate, F.G.S., v.p., 
showed specimens of the stems of a very large number of arborescent 
plants, both exogenous and endogenous, and gave an interesting address 
in explanation of the different arrangements of the fibro-vascular 
bundles, as observable in the sections.
Mr. W.
H. Hay exhibited some 
interesting varieties of the egg of the blackbird (one, a pale blue one, is 
to all appearance the same as Turdus migratorius, or American robin), 
house sparrow, and guillemot.

exhibited the skin of a long-eared bat {Plecotus auritus), and a number of 
slides of the wings of various lepidoptera, some of them showing the 
plumules.
Mr. John Grassham brought a number of lepidoptera, 
including Argynnis adippe, var.
cleodoxa, Adel specimen of Vanessa 
polychloros, and Leeds and Doncaster examples of Vanessa antiopa.
Mr.
Walter Raine showed a number of birds' eggs, British and foreign, 
especially a pair of the Australian emu, which from their large size and 
dark green colour were very noticeable.
With the microscope Mr. B.
Saynor showed the spermatozoa of the common frog : Mr. Washington 
Teasdale, Schultz's artificial diatom-sHdes, also slides of cracked silica 
film from Mr. H.
J. Slack, Pres.
R.M.S., also a series of line and curve 
rulings (by himself) on glass, as dark-field test objects.
Mr. Jas.
Abbott 
gave a short description of the work done at the monads by Rev. W.
H. 
Dallinger, F.R.M.S., and Mr. D.'s method of examination.
325th Meeting, March 11th.— The chairman (Mr. B.
Holgate, F.G.S., 
v.p.,) showed a number of specimens of the sandstones found in the 
neighbourhood of Leeds, and gave a short address on their adaptability 
to building purposes.
A discussion thereupon arose as to the causes of 
decay of public buildings in Leeds and elsewhere, in which several 
members joined.
Insects were shown by several members, including 
Cymatophora flavicornis, taken on the 10th March in the Meanwood 
valley by Mr. Smethurst, who also showed a nice dark variety of 
P. pilosaria, taken recently at Shipley.
The microscopists discussed an 
excursion they had made two days before to Roundhay Park, at which 
many objects were collected, including stentors, diatoms, hydrse, vorti-

time and labour.
The president exhibited fresh-gathered specimens of 
Dicranodontium longirostre, Eudadium verticillatum, and Campylostelium 
saxicola — all new to the district ; also the rare Campylopus paradoxus, 
gathered at Stayley Brushes.
Another interesting moss exhibited (sent 
by Mr. Hobkirk) was a dried specimen of the Dicranum gathered last 
year at Wharncliffe Crags by Dr. Parsons, which has been the subject of 
much speculation and doubt.
It was at first thought to be the species 
falcatnm, but this was considered by competent bryologists to be 
quite erroneous ; and at length the Rev. J.
Fergusson gave it the 
provisional name of Dicranum saxicola.
The president exhibited fresh- 
gathered specimens of a closely allied moss from Stayley Brushes, and 
expressed his opinion that this latter, at all events, was a form of 
D. fuscescens ; also fine fruiting specimens of the moss mostly known as 
Hypnum elegans, Hook., gathered by himself and Messrs.
Ashton and 
Percival near Barmouth.
He also pointed out that it disagreed in several 
important characters from Hooker's figure and description in " Musci 
Exotici," and expressed his opinion that the name given to it by Dr.
Spruce in 1846 {H.
Borrerianum) would most likely be reverted to.
He also stated that he -was supported in this opinion by Prof.
Lindberg, 
Dr. Spruce, Dr. Braithwaite, and the Rev. J.
Fergusson.
A specimen of 
Orthodontium gracile from Tunbridge Wells, was exhibited, having been 
gathered there by Mr. Holmes.
This moss has been generally supposed 
to be peculiar to Cheshire and Yorkshire, but it was stated that Mr.
Borrer had gathered it at Tunbridge so long ago as 1844.
Mr. R.
R. 
Bastow read an interesting paper on the potato fungus Peronospora 
infestans, which was illustrated by specimens under the microscope, and 
lithographed sketches.
Wakefield Naturalists' Society.
— Meeting March 5th.
— Mr. E.
B. 
Wrigglesworth, v.
p. (in the chair) exliibited a very fine specimen of 
Goliathus magnus, from South Africa, and several species of British 
coleoptera.
Yorkshire Naturalists' UmoN Exhibition at Leeds.
— BepoH 
on the Entomological Section.
— This section made a good show, 
though, as is almost always the case, the exhibits in lepidoptera far 
exceeded those in all the other orders put together.
It is greatly to be 
deplored that our entomologists so persistently ignore the less conspicuous 
— but none the less interesting — other branches of the science.
Perhaps 
the most interesting exhibit was the grand collection of larvae sent by 
Lord Walsingham, the specimens preserved and mounted by himself.
It 
is impossible to speak too highly of this collection, so great an advance is 
this method of arranging the specimens in a cabinet over our old stifi" 
manner of'keeping simply a series of pinned images.
Here the space left 
for each species was about the same as in most cabinets, but only a single 
imago was placed at the top, and beneath it the food plant, on which was 
mounted, in the most natural positions, a number of larvse of the species

in various stages of growth, showing at a glance the complete history of 
the species.
The larvae of Papilio Machaon, Acronycta alni, and others, 
were enough to make a lepidopterist wild with delight.
Mr. W.
Prest, 
of York, showed his fine collection of imagos, which is undoubtedly one 
of the best in the provinces.
It was beautifully arranged, and contained, 
as did also that of Mr. G.
T. Porritt, of Huddersfield, which was also 
exhibited, an unusually large number of rare species.
Mr. Prest's 
included the following, not in the other collection : — Geometra dnarag- 
daria, Eupithecia extensaria, Euholia moeniata, Pachnohia alpina, Cram- 
hus adipellus, and others ; whilst Mr. Porritt showed Clicerocampa Nerii, 
Ennomos antennaria {ahiiaria), Nascia cilialis, Scoparia liiieolalis, 
Ephestia passulella, &c., which were wanting in Mr. Prest's.
Both 
collections contained some very fine varieties.
Messrs.
Chas.
Smethurst 
and John Grassham's (Leeds) collections were very good, and included 
some very extraordinary varieties ; the former had three beautiful 
examples of the broad black-bordered form of Abraxas grossulariata, 
also some as good varieties of Arctia menthastri, A.
mendica, and A.
caja, 
as we have ever seen.
Another exceedingly interesting collection was 
that exhibited by Messrs.
J. W.
Carter and J.
Firth, of Bradford, 
showing the lepidopterous fauna of that district, and all taken within six 
miles of the town.
We were rather surprised, but very pleased, to notice 
Larentia salicata, and several other species we should not have expected 
to come across in such a district, amongst them.
The other exhibits 
included Noctuce from Torquay, by Mr. Walter Buckton of Leeds ; two 
drawers of European butterflies by Messrs.
W. Buckton and H.

Mr. S.

of British lepidoptera, painted from nature by himself, which were justly 
and universally admired for their wonderful execution.
Lastly, Mr. C.

CHAPTER I.
Vun id V autre.
" And I have seen a man 
In happy moods conversing with a fly ; 
And as he 
Beheld its wondrous eye and plxunage fine.
From leaping scarce he kept, and perfect joy." 
"We are constantly in the habit of meeting with individuals who, in 
the ordinary course of conversation, refer in an indifferent manner to 
the various genera of that wide-spread and most important order, 
Eyriienoptera.
They term it abstruse.
Xow this wholesale condemn- 
ation of a grand study is scarcely fair criticism, yet we must allow 
that from a certain point of view it is correct.
But the fact of 
abstruseness lies in the inadequate attention which scientists have 
bestowed upon it.
Youngsters appreciate books which are replete 
with illustrations.
Speculators and tradesmen place their money in 
funds which yield the most certain amount of profit for the least 
investment.
Naturalists run after orders whose appearance and 
general qualifications render them fascinating and untroublesome.
What can be better, they say, than to have a goodly cabinet of 
gorgeous moths, of well-arranged birds' eggs, or stuffed animals ?
But if this method of argument and selection were to predominate, 
Xature would degenerate into a plaything for infants, and natural 
history would develop into unnatural nonsense.
Trees do not extend 
much unless by branching out.
So, unless we strike out new paths 
for ourselves, avoiding muddy tracks of worn-out roads, attacking 
subjects least attacked, embracing studies neglected and perchance 
ridiculed, we may not hope to obtain any merit for ourselves.
With 
this object in view I have taken up the pen, that, by offering a few 
interesting facts in connection with the Ichieumonidce, others may be 
induced to think with me that, instead of being a dry science and 
obscure, it is really one of beauty, and intelligible, replete with life- 
lessons and instruction of no ordinary quality.
Nature is a compound of two immensely divergent systems — 
generative and destructive.
The latter, though at first sight an

The Naturalist.
apparent absurdity in the work of vitality, is nevertheless as impor- 
tant and useful a requisition as the former.
One adds, the other 
abstracts.
We observe this principle involved in every phase of 
creation : without it, existence would be at cross purposes with itself, 
and obliteration must inevitably and indisputably ensue.
Greater- 
bodied and consequently less prolific animals are, then, exterminated 
by the fearful fertility of minor ones.
To counteract this obviously 
depressing and fatal superabundance, enemies are provided which 
keep a constant checkstring upon over-production, adjusted appa- 
rently to a nicety.
To this class of benefactors (as we may safely 
call them) the family in question belongs.
Par exemple, we are all 
aware how very common Pieris brassier, the familiar white butterfly, 
is throughout the summer.
We all know that the food upon which 
the larva regales itself (garden cabbage, &c.,) is exceedingly abun- 
dant, and we know also how rapaciously the caterpillar eats, how 
rapidly it grows, how sudden are its metamorphoses, how fertile is the 
female insect.
In short, then, if Brassica were permitted to breed so 
extensively with impunity, our cabbages would as extensively dis- 
appear, and we should be burdened with grubs instead of cabbages.
What is the remedy ?
Some agency must be invoked to arrest the 
evil.
And thus our little microgaster, by name Apauteles glomeratus^ 
of world-wide renown, comes forward and renders the needful assist- 
ance.
Anyone of an observant disposition .
will have noticed, in the 
summer time, a lot of small silky cocoons of a beautiful yellow hue, 
clustering about the niches or under the eaves of walls, and in various 
places, sometimes enclosing in their embrace the dead carcase of 
larval Brassim They are the progeny of Glomeratus, at once the 
fiend of common white, and the gardener's friend.
To breed and 
observe these tiny insects through all their stages and movements 
will repay us tenfold.
CHAPTER II.
LIFE HISTORY.
" Every mind was made for growth, for knowledge, and its nature is sinned 
against when it is doomed to ignorance." 
Having granted the utility and actual necessity of these insects, we 
would wish to see them in the act of warfare.
Where can we do so ?
Let us take a trip into the woods, and scan the hedgerows as we 
journey, and, with time and patience, we may be rewarded.
I say 
may, because it is much easier to study the effect than to discover the 
cause at work.
It is possible to watch a caterpillar for a whole 
afternoon without the least approach of an ichneumon, but defeat 
must be defeated by re-application, and I do not doubt that ultimately 
BaiRSTOW : IcHNEUMONIDiE.
147 
our hope will be realised.
The ichneumon seems to be aware instinc- 
tively of the exact spot where the larva is located.
Smartly pro- 
menading about its back, it takes in an ichneumon's eye-view of the 
scene, as if judging whether the opportunity and place are favourable.
Is the specimen a well-fattened one, not sickly and likely to die, and 
as the Insurance Companies would term it — an ordinary risk ?
If 
satisfied on this point, the insect pierces the caterpillar with its ovi- 
positor, leaving an egg at every stroke.
The grub winces, but does 
not appear to take very great notice of the oppression, unconscious of 
the death-knell which seals its doom.
One, twenty, perhaps a 
hundred eggs are deposited, our ichneumon has fulfilled a mission, 
" Not the least obeisance made he, 
Not a minute stopped or stayed he," 
flying off as carelessly as possible, and leaving its future progeny to 
fate.
The eggs soon hatch, and young grubs thus formed feed upon 
the food taken in by the caterpillar, or its natural fat, preserving or 
refusing the vital organs until such a length of time has elapsed for 
the perfect development of the grubling.
They then burst through 
the sides or skin of their victim, and spin cocoons in which to pass 
their metamorphosis.
Occasionally I believe the eggs are left on the 
outside of the larva, but this is a fact I have never personally noticed.
The ichneumon strikes deep enough so as to prevent any hindrance 
to the caterpillar's development and various skin changes, and as a 
means of security for its young against such changes.
Indeed the 
instinct of this genus presents a type of no ordinary quality.
Even 
as the males of Saturnia carpini are intuitively apprised of the conduct 
of the females, and refuse any attractive agency after the event, so 
will an ichneumon refuse to deposits eggs in the body of a larva 
already stung.
The smallest ichneumons are the most interesting 
and beautiful under the microscope.
" Contrivance intricate, expressed with ease, 
Where unassisted sight no beauty sees ; 
The shapely limb, and lubricated joint, 
Within the small dimensions of a point." 
Things of beauty they may be, yet to the poor helpless victims — 
insatiate demons.
In the same manner as an entomologist is sometimes startled by 
perceiving in his breeding cage, instead of a fine bombyx, some gaunt 
and grim-looking ichneumon, so the hymenopterist will discover 
instead of a fine Metopius, as expected, some peculiar dipterous insect 
appearing out of the Bombiis chrysalis.
This is a drawback which 
will have to be encountered, and I would recommend the hymenopterist 
us 
The Naturalist.
as well as the other to pin all such supplanters in his cabinet along 
with the subjective type he studies.
In mammalogy the ichneumon 
is an animal distinguished as the natural enemy and destroyer of 
snakes, crocodiles, birds, and various animals.
From this creature 
the ichneumon-fly has derived its name, the two bearing in common 
a boldness and ferocity by no means insignificant.
It would be diffi- 
cult to specify what insects and other things are not preyed upon by 
these little demons, but we will content ourselves in naming a few.
Of lepidoptera, both macro and micro are punished conspicuously, 
bombyces and noctuides, pyrales and tortrices, aphides, or plant-lice 
species of cynips or gall-flies ; others prey upon the eggs of spiders, 
taking up their residence in the cocoons.
Dr. S.
van Vollenhoven 
gives an example of two species of Rogas (circumscriptus and testaceus) 
discovered by M.
Ritsema, of Haarlem, in January, within the nests of 
birds, " by which fact it is proved that some specimens are enabled to 
endure the winter frost in the state of imago (or perfect insect) by 
concealing themselves in birds' nests." This writer also informs us 
that some species of ichneumon pierce dipterous larva living in mush- 
rooms.
Of ichneumonidae there are six sub-families, viz : — ichneumonides, 
cryptides, agriotypides, ophionides, tryphonides, and pimplides, com- 
prising no less than 136 genera and 1180 species.
It would take 
volumes to describe the distinctive qualities and peculiarities which 
make up these species, and even at the finish it is quite possible we 
might have as many more particulars to enumerate as those already 
touched upon, without regarding at all the problematic question of 
variety.
We can, however, with safety classify them into two kinds, 
having regard solely to the method of ovipositing in the female 
imago, thus : 
1. Ichneumons which require a sharp instrument to penetrate the 
skins of larvae (PI.
iv., fig.
2, 2a); 
2. Ichneumons which require a more mechanical arrangement, 
more complicate and sensitive, " to feel their way," pierce and deposit 
their eggs in the domiciles of insects, or into objects of solidity and 
strength (PI.
iv., fig.
3, 3«, 35).
The first kind conceal their swords in sheaths, so to speak, the sharp 
cutter reposing in an abdominal groove ; the second kind use instru- 
ments of a long thready appearance, composed of three distinct parts, 
each one in itself a lancet, the centre one being preserved when in a 
state of repose by the two exterior ones.
The central cord ends in a 
point flattened, and jagged or indented towards it, forming, in this

manner, a most certain and formidable weapon.
It would seem to be 
capable of piercin^g the most stalwart barrier of defence, and is 
wielded in a remarkably subtile and agile manner by its possessor.
According to Reaumur it is " able to raise or depress it, and bend it 
in various directions." The insect often uses the foreleg with which 
to guide its ovipositor, in case of a difficult or invulnerable obstacle.
The cocoons of ichneumons are perhaps as compact in shape as 
those of any other orders in the insect world.
Many lepidoptera^ 
such as Ghelonia caja, Saturnia carpini, some of the Cuspidates^ the 
Japanese Attacus {Bombyx) Tama-mdi are remarkably lavish and 
extravagant in the manufacture of their cocoons, whilst others again 
are equally slovenly and careless.
Most ichneumons, however, show 
a precision and care characteristic of the gentility of the order, 
McLauvin, in his fluxionary calculations, could not have had an order 
better suited for his mathematical experiments.
With some insects 
the cocoons made by the larvae are so differently shaped, that the law 
of saving material and period is as variously employed as the methods 
used by those beings are changeable and numerous.
But ichneumons 
would appear to have a more rigid rule of invariable form than most 
of their compeers.

LINCOLNSHIRE MARITIME PLAMTS.
By Rev. W.
Fowler, M.A 
At the close of a short paper on " Lincolnshire Coast Plants," ia 
the Naturalist for April, 1878, I proposed to trace them at some 
future time along the banks of the Humber and Trent, as Dr, 
Parsons had traced the Yorkshire ones along the banks of the Ouse.* 
As might be expected, a priori^ thera is a general agreement between 
the results of his observations and the results of my own, the Trent 
and Ouse being both of them tidal rivers, though, owing to the 
greater breadth of the Ouse, and its course with relation to the 
Humber, the salt water probably reaches a higher point in Yorkshire 
than in Lincolnshire.
For an examination of the plants occurring 
between Grimsby and Killingholme I am indebted to Mr. Cordeaux, 
of Great Coates ; the banks of the Humber above Killingholme, and 
those of the Trent to Wildsworth (above Owston Ferry, below 
Gainsborough) I have myself examined ; and though it is of course 
*  The i^aper by Dr, Parsons, to which reference is made, api)eared in tlie 
Naturalist for March, 18.76.
The Na^tukaltst.
possible til at I may have overlooked a plant or two, it is not probable 
that a further search would make any important addition to the list 
which I give.
Of the plants mentioned in my former paper, some 
seem to require such decidedly maritime conditions for their develop- 
ment, that they do not appear above Grimsby ; of the rest, the 
highest stations ascertained are the following : — CaJcile maritima, 
Triticum junceum, Great Coates : Statice Limonium, Suoeda maritimaj 
Killingholme : Armeria maritima, Triticum repens, var.
litioralis, 
Hordeum maritimum^ Atriplex littoralis, Goxhill : Artemisia mari- 
tima, New Holland : Spergularia marginata (Syme), Ferriby : Leptu- 
rus fiUformis, Winteringham : Spergularia neglecta (Syme), Plantago 
maritima, Trlglochin maritimum, Sclerochloa maritima, Alkbro : 
Gla.ux maritima, Juncus Gerardi, Sclerochlea distans, Keadby : Aster 
IVipolium,, Burringham : Apium graveolens, Scirpus maritimus, Sus- 
worth : Rumex maritimus, Ferry Flash.
Of quasi-maritime plants, Trifolium fragiferum occurs about Keadby 
and Burringham, Samolus Valerandi in the neighbourhood of Owston 
and Haxey, and Flantago coronopus at Burton Stather ; to none of 
these three, however, does salt water seem to be a necessary of life?
as they are frequently seen at considerable distances from either the 
sea or tidal rivers.
As on the Ouse, so on the Trent, the three 
really maritime plants that ascend highest are, Rumex maritimus, 
Apium graveolens, and Scirpus maritimus ; the last-named, however, 
was not flowering at Susworth, and seemed to be dying out.
Between 
Owston Ferry and Gainsborough, none of the above-named plants 
were noticed ; the following growing very luxuriantly, and occupying 
all available room on the banks : — Ranunculus repens, R.
sceleratus.
Geranium pratense, Spirota ulmaria, Angelica sylvestris, Valeriana 
oficinalis, Dipsacus sylvestris, Tanacetum vulgare, Petasites vulgaris, 
Arctium ma jus (Schk.), Arundo Fhragmites, Salix viminalis, and 
twining about amongst them and over them.
Convolvulus sepium, with 
its large white flowers.
Eoughly speaking, the distance from Grimsby at the Humber 
mouth to Goxhill, at the north-east corner of Lincolnshire, is 15 
miles — from Goxhill to Alkbro, near the Trent falls, 20 miles — and 
from Trent falls to Owston Ferry 20 miles more ; from which 
it appears that a few maritime plants are to be found at least 50 
miles from the sea-coast, not strictly speaking inland, but on the 
"banks of a tidal river, at that distance from the sea.

PLAGIOTHECIUM ELEGANS (Hooker).
By Jno. Whitehead.
I HAVE to announce the discovery of that rarely-fruiting moss mostly 
known as Hypnum elegans (Hooker), with plenty of good capsules, 
near Barmouth, by myself and Messrs.
Ashton and Percival.
We 
first saw the plant with young fruit in Dec, 1876, but we visited the 
place again the following April, and gathered ripe capsules.
My 
principal object in writing this notice is to question the identity of 
our British moss with the H.
elegans of Hooker, and to claim for it 
the original name of H.
Borrerianum, given to it by Dr. Spruce in 
1846.
Perhaps it may be as well to state that I brought a patch of 
the young fruit with me in Dec, 1876, and cultivated it, watching its 
growth daily during three months.
A few weeks back I saw a copy 
of Hooker's " Musci Exotici," and was surprised to find that his 
figure and description of H.
elegans differed in so many important 
characters from our plant.
He describes and figures the fruit as 
drooping, as in Br yum pendulum, with the leaves scarcely pointed, 
and the inner peristome pale yellow, outer red — characters entirely at 
variance with our plant, which has the fruit horizontal and sometimes 
fiub-erect, with the leaves much acuminated, and the outer and inner

I have mentioned the subject- to the Rev. J.
Fergusson, and he is also surprised to find that the two plants are 
distinct.
I have also sent specimens to Dr. Spruce, who sent me an 
interesting and valuable letter in reply, from which the following is 
an extract.
" The moss identified by Wilson with Hooker's H.
elegans I first 
called H.
Borrerianum, Ms., in 1846, and gave it under that name to 
my friends, but it did not appear in print until 1851, when Karl 
Miiller published it under my name in his ' Synopsis Muscorum.' In 
1855 Wilson gave it as H.
elegans, Hooker, in his ' Bryologia,' and 
in 1860 Schimper, in his ' Synopsis of European Mosses,' described 
the very same plant as H.
Millleri, Schimp.
I never was quite satis- 
fied with Wilson's determination, for Hooker's figure in ' Musci 
Exotici ' shows lanceolate concave leaves without any slender points, 
and a capsule as pendulous as that of a Bryum.
Lindberg, in his 
Manipulas Muscorum, Secundus, 1874,' says he has compared 
authentic specimens of the two, and found them quite distinct.
The 
true H, elegans was gathered by Menzies at Nootka Sound, in 1787.
The question of its identity with our British (and European) moss can 
only 'be decided by renewed reference to the Hookerian herbariun^."

former in the leaves being serrated at the points, and from the latter 
in the points alone being serrated, and from both by the singularly- 
drooping capsules.

MiGEATORY Arrivals.
— I saw a swallow on the wing in the Ryburn 
valley, on the morning of April 11th ; the wheatear on Norland Moor, 
on the 7th ; and a few willow wrens had arrived by April 9th.

The Eagle Owl (Bubo maximus) m captivity.
— Three living specimens 
of this beautiful bird are now being exhibited in Roundhay Park, near 
Leeds.
The largest, a female, was taken on Rombalds Moor in 1876 ; 
the other two are young birds, male and female, taken out of a nest last 
August, about twelve miles north of Aberdeen.
They are kept by Mr.
Short Notes and Queries.
153 
Todcl, photographer, in a small room built on purpose for them.
During 
the day they are generally asleep, but as night advances they become very 
noisy.
Their hooting at night may be heard at a considerable distance.
The barn and tawny owls of the neighbourhood come and perch on the 
roof above the eagle owls, and answering them by their respective cries, 
keep up a dismal concert all night through.
This only ends with the 
approach of morning, when the wild birds retire, and the prisoners fall 
into a deep slumber.
The food of the captive eagle owls consists of meat, 
rats, and other vermin.
They will consume in a week 14ibs of meat, 
besides a dozen rats.
This no doubt seems enormous, but I can per- 
sonally vouch for the truth of it.
I have seen them swallow pieces of 
meat weighing two ounces.
These fine birds are very cleanly in their 
habits, washing themselves in clean water every morning ; and it is 
singular that they will never wash twice in the same water.
It is a shame 
to see these noble birds in captivity, but were they set at liberty to- 
morrow, dozens of men would be out with their guns, and never rest 
till they had entirely driven them away, or laid them dead at their feet, 
such being the unfortunate, not to say culpable, propensity for destruc- 
tion which characterises the Englishman who sees a noble or rare bird 
before him — a propensity the result of which is the gradual extermination 
of all our rare birds.

Leeds, March 25th.
Nest and Eggs of Moorhen.
— During an excursion to Strensall 
Common last spring, I came across a nest of the common Gallmulaf 
containing 26 eggs — an enormous quantity, the usual number being eight 
or nine.
The eggs were in three distinct batches ; seven or eight were 
very similar, being of a warm stone colour, marked with large, rich brown 
spots.
Another lot were considerably smaller, and were very slightly 
freckled with rust colour ; while the third batch differed entirely from 
either of the preceding.
I think this is sufficient proof that three moor- 
hens must have laid their eggs in one nest — an instance which I think 
has never been known to occur before.
The nest which contained them 
was as large as and similar to that of the coot.
It would be interesting to 
know whether the three birds did their share during incubation, or the 
I original owner of the nest was left in charge of the whole.

Aulacom7iium turgidum.
— Neither of the two notices of Aulacomnium 
' turgidum given in the last number of the Naturalist is quite accurate, and 
I therefore trouble you with this short note.
Specimens of the Whern- 
side plant were submitted to Mr. Bos well in August last, and were at 
first regarded by him as J., palustre var.
imhricatum, Schpr., which is A.
turgidum of Funk, but not the true A.
(Mnium) turgidum of Wahlenberg 
and of recent authors.
The first specimen from Whernside which I saw 
was sent to me by Mr. Lees on the 23rd October last, and was marked 
" A, paludre, var.
turgidum.'' The next was sent by Mr. Wesley on the 
154 
The Naturalist.
24th, and marked ^' A.
palnstre, var.
imhricatum, Schpr A.
turyi- 
dnm, Funk, et al.
in litt." I pointed out to both gentlemen that the 
Whernside plant was not A.
palustre var.
iynhricatum, Schpr., or A.
turgidum Funk, but A.
turgidum, Wahlenberg, a conclusion at which Mr.
Boswell had arrived some time previously, on his re-examination of the 
plant.
Until to-day I was under the impression that he had done so only 
after he had seen or heard of specimens of A .
turgidum, Wahl.
, from Ben 
More, but it appears that he had done so altogether independently of 
them.
In any case Mr. Boswell was the first to identify the Whernside 
plant.
I had, however, something to do with the identification, or, 
perhaps, to be more precise, with the final determination of the Ben More 
specimens ; and I can assure Mr. Lees and Mr. West that they are quite 
wrong in their guess as to the time when this took place.
Instead of being 
October or November, it was certainly not later than the first week of 
September.
Mr. Boswell is satisfied that the Ben More specimens were 
correctly and unhesitatingly identified, before the Whernside ones were 
so — not after, as Mr. Lees and Mr. West imagine ; and with what satisfies 
Mr. Boswell, Mr. Lees I think must remain contented.
While writing 
on this subject it may be as well to state that Mr. Holmes is mistaken in 
supposing that Aulacomnium turgidum is found only in a barren state on 
the Styrian Alps.
Several years ago fruiting specimens were gathered 
there by the distinguished Austrian bryologist, Mr. Breidler.

— Monthly meeting, 21st April, 
Mr. J.
Whitehead, president, in the chair.
— From Mr. E.
M. Holmes, of 
LonAon, the secretary (Mr. Rogers) said he had received two mosses — 
Trichostomum •suhidatum (fr.) and T.
littorale — both extremely rare 
species, for the 'Society's collection.
In a note Mr. Holmes said that the 
former species he found in yellowish clay-slate soil, in shady hollows and 
hedge banks, along with Bryum Tozeri and Schistostega osm,v/iidacea .
He 
has gathered it at Saltash, at Sunny Corner, Truro, and at Bickleigh 
Vale, Devon.
In the first-named locality the original discoverer was Mr.
F. Brent ; near Truro it was first observed by.
the Rev. Mr.
Tozer, and 
afterwards by Mr. R.
V. Tellam.
The president mentioned the finding 
by himself of what he believed to be Trichostomum Bamhergeri, near 
Barmouth.
This moss, if his surmise be correct, will be an acquisition to 
the British flora.
He also exhibited specimens of Grrimmia Scludtziif 
which he found growing abundantly, in fruit, upon Cader Idris ; also the 
very rare LesJcea latebricola with male fl.owers ; and Didymodon cylindricv.s 
(fr.) of which five capsules only were gathered during the late Barmouth 
excursion.
The latter species was first found in Wales by the late Mr.
W. Wilson.
Another moss from Cader Idris was AmlrecF-a petrophila, in 
fine condition.
The president exhibited specimens of the very rare 
Ilypnum demissum, gathered by Dr. Carrington last week near Barmouth.
Killarney and Beddgelert were previously the only known stations for the 
species in this country.
Trichostomum niditum, lately gathered in 
Anglesey by Mr. P.
Rogers, was distributed by the secretary.
A commu- 
nication was read from Mr. W.
H.Pearson, enclosing specimens of two 
Hepaticce — Adelanthiis decipiem and Jungermannia Schraderi, collected by 
Dr. Carrington and himself, on the 12th inst-, near Cefn Coch, Merioneth- 
shire.
The former species has only been found previously in Cornwall, 
the West of Ireland, the West Indies, and the Andes (see Spruce, in 
Journal of Botany, 1876).
The last-named species was found many years 
ago in Scotland by Drummond, and more recently it had been gathered 
by Dr. Carrington in Glen Finnan, Invernesshire, and by Mr. G.
Stabler 
in Westmoreland.
No other station is known for it in the British Isles.

the word was wrongly used, and that some kind of locust was indicated by 
it : while the late Mr. Molyneux suggested that it was " that very kind of 
Scarahceus which the idolatrous Egyptians of old held in such high 
veneration as to pay it divine worship, and engrave its image on their 
obelisks." Mr. Sims formally announced that by subscription of a few

YoE-KSHinE Naturalists' Union.
— The excursion season of 1879 was 
opened by a field-day among the mountains, with Ingleton for rendezvous, 
on Easter Monday, the 14th April.
For some days before, the ground 
was worked over in advance by various parties of members, while on the 
day itself the attendance was quite up to the average, there being on the 
ground between 60 and 70 members, representing in all 14 Societies, 
while 13 were entirely unrepresented.
Various parties were organised.
One was led by Mr. Isaac Hindson, of Kirkby Lonsdale, who as a 
botanist and geologist was well known to, and a frequent companion of.
Prof.
Hughes and Mr. R.
H. Tiddeman, when engaged on the geological 
survey of the district.
Another which was headed by the Rev. William 
Fowler, M.A., was accompanied by Mr. Joseph CaiT, of Ingleton.
A 
third detachment made for the summit of Ingleborough, while various 
members took isolated directions.
After tea at the Wheatsheaf, and 
sections at the National School, the general meeting was opened in the 
school at 5-30 p.m., the chair being occupied by the Rev. W.
Fowler, 
M.A., ex-president.
A long hst of 48 new subscribers to the funds 
(mainly the result of the recent exhibition at Leeds) was read, and thanks 
voted.
The Hst included Mr. John Barran, M.P., Prof.
A. H.
Green, 
Mr. Isaac Hindson, and several Lancashire naturalists.
Mr. J.
W. 
Davies, F.L.S., of Halifax, moved a vote of thanks to the Rev. T.
D. 
Sherlock, M.A., vicar of Ingleton, for the use of the schools, and to 
Messrs.
I. Hindson and J.
Carr for conducting parties, which was passed.
Mr. Carr replied.
A vote of thanks to the local secretary was afterwards 
passed.
Mr. W.
E. Clarke, of Leeds, secretary of the Vertebrate 
Section, reported that ornithology was the only branch which had been 
attended to, that birds and observers had both been scarce, and that this, 
with the lateness of the season, would account for the shortness of the 
list.
The birds observed were : — Residents 26, including the dipper, 
cole and marsh tits, carrion crow, and curlew ; summer migrants, only 2, 
the ring ouzel and tree pipit.
Birds observed breeding : — dipper, two 
nests observed, one of which contained four eggs ; carrion crow, a nest 
with three eggs.
Mr. E.
B. Wrigglesworth stated, in the absence of the 
officers of the Conchological Section, that the shells found would be 
submitted to competent authorities, and in the absence of the officers of 
the Entomological Section that the earliness and backwardness of the 
Reports of Societies.

season, and tlie cold and dull weather of the day, had reduced the 
captures of insects to a rainimum.
Dr. Parsons, of Goole, secretary to 
the Botanical Section, reported that the places visited had been Ingleton, 
H elk's Wood, Thornton Force, Chapel-le-dale, Weathercote Cave, Ingle- 
borough, T^Tiernside, Dent, Sedbergh, Howgill Fells, Bow Fell, Hawes 
Junction, &c.
Owing to the earliness of the date, and the backwardness 
of the season, few flowering plants had been observed compared with what 
would have been seen later in the season.
The district, owing to its great 
variety of soil and diversity of surface, would no doubt yield a rich and 
varied flora.
As it was, 103 phgenogams were observed, including several 
rare alpine species, as Alchemilla alpina (Cautley Spout), Saxifraga oppo- 
sitifoHa, plentiful and in flower on an escarpment of Yoredale limestone, 
high up on Ingleborough ; also Draba muralis, Alsine verna, Paibus 
Chameemorus, Sedum Telephium, Saxifraga hypnoides, Chrysosplenium 
alternifolium, Yaccinium Oxycoccos, and Y.
Yitis-Idsea, Taxus baccata, 
and Sesleria cserulea.
Ferns and their allies were plentiful, 19 kinds 
having been observed, including Hymenophyllum unilaterale, Crypto- 
gamme crispa, Asplenium viride, Lycopodium clavatum, Selago and alpi- 
num, Selaginella selaginoides.
In mosses and lichens the district had 
proved extremely rich, the variety and luxuriance of the kinds met with 
far exceeding anything seen at any previous meeting of the Union.
Of 
the different kinds of rock met with in the district, each yielded its own 
particular mosses and lichens.
It was remarked that the mosses and 
lichens characteristic of alpine regions descended lowest on the slate, 
whereas the common lowland kinds ascended highest on the limestone.
The total number of mosses, so far as hitheito made out, is 130, including 
Andrefea rupestris, Gymnostomum squarrosum, Dicranella squarrosa, 
Seligeria pusilla and recurvata, Distichum capillaceum (fr.) Encalypta 
rhabdocarpa, Grimmia orbicularis and Donniana (fr.) Racomitrium five 
species (fr.) Amphoridium Mougeotii, I71ota intermedia (fr.) Orthotrichum 
Lyellii (fr.) Splachnum sphfericum, Bartramia CEderi, Breutelia arouata, 
Zieria julacea, Mnium stellare, Polytrichum strictum (fr.) Diphyscium 
foliosum (fr.) Hedwigia ciliata (fr.) Pseudo-leskea catenulata, Hypnum 
ochraceum and scor^jioides, Hylocomium loreum (fr.) and brevi- 
rostre.
Many rarely fertile mosses were found in fruit, as Eucladium 
verticillatum, Plagiothecium undulatum, Hylocomium triquetrum, &c.
The Hepaticse included Reboulia hemisphserica, Gymnomitrium concin- 
natum, Madotheca laevigata, &c.
Of lichens, upwards of 50 species were 
recognised, including Spheerophoron coralloides, Stereocaulon coralloides, 
Cetraria islandica, Peltigera horizontalis and aphthosa, Solorina saccata, 
Stictina fuliginosa, Parmelia c-aperata, perlata and conspersa, Urnbilicaria 
proboscidea, Placodium candicans, Lecanora ventosa, aurantiaca, atra, 
cinerea and badia, Lecidea geographica, and Endocarpa miniatum and 
fluviatile.
These lists will no doubt be largely added to, when the 
examination of the specimens is completed.

A discussion 
followed as to whether the conglomerate at the base of the carboniferous 
limestone was of carboniferous or devonian age.
The speakers were Dr.

The conclusion 
arrived at was that the conglomerate represented the bottom of the ocean 
in which the limestone was deposited, and was of the carboniferous 
period.— W.

— 
The room allotted to the Botanical Section was the smallest of the rooms 
occupied by the exhibition, and consequently it was not possible to 
display more than a tithe of the specimens sent in, though tables were 
crowded and walls tapestried with them.
An exhibition of botanical

possible to procure living plants, must necessarily be more attractive to 
the botanist than to the sesthetic lover of flowers, for the graceful forms, 
vivid colours, and sweet odours of living foliage and flowers cannot be 
preserved in the herbarium, being more or less completely lost in drying : 
hence, while stufied birds, butterflies, and shells are beautiful and 
attractive objects in the cabinet, a collection of dried plants to a non- 
botanical beholder is only so much Latin hay." The only exhibitor 
who attempted to treat his subject artistically was Mr. J.
R. Murdoch, 
who exhibited with other specimens an elegant wreath constructed of 
various species of mosses, and surrounding an appropriate quotation.
As objects of beauty, we must also mention an admirably-dried series of 
marine algae from the Isle of Man, exhibited by Mr. Thomas Hick.
To 
the botanist, however, there was much to interest arid instruct.
Mr. A.
Carr, of Sheffield, besides a number of other specimens, sent an excellent 
series of brambles and roses, which, though suggesting to the superficial 
observer the thought — "Caesar and Pompey, very much alike, specially 
Pompey," were full of interest to the botanical students who have 
mustered sufficient courage to attack these thorny and puzzlesome plants.
The specimens of each species contained, mounted on one sheet, the 
flowering shoots, the fruit, and the barren stem ; the only thing wanted 
to complete the illustration being a sketch of the plant to show the habit 
of grovrth — an important character which cannot be shown in a herbarium 
specimen.
Yorkshire and other British flowering plants and ferns were 
shown by the Goole Scientific Society and others ; a herbarium of North 
American plants by Mr. W.
West ; and a collection of alpine plants from 
Switzerland by Dr. Parsons, who also exhibited mosses, hepaticae, lichens, 
and fungi from Yorkshire and the south of England.
Some of the dis- 
coveries of the past year were on view, as Aulacomnion turgidum from 
Whemside, Carex capillaris from Gordale, Limosella aquatica from Raw- 
cMe, Carduus acaulis from Lindrick Common, &c.

CHAPTER III.
WAYS AND MEANS.
** Of writing well these are chief est things, 
To know the nature and the use of things 1" 
Summer sunshine allures thousands of these pert little insects from 
their hiding-places.
With sparkling, glistening wings 
" Whose azure floats in liquid fire " — 
wings whose hue it would be difficult to define, and 
" Must all the painter's art defy, 
And bid him from the task retire ": 
and with sharp, active motions they seem ever to be alert in quest of 
sustenance and enjoyment.
Indeed, when viewing their whole 
demeanour one is struck with the notion that life and life's blessings 
are relished to the uttermost degree.
They are generally easy to 
catch, being of such careless dispositions.
An ichneumon's location 
recognises no law of defined certainty : I find them by keeping my 
eyes open.
The way to make a collection, however, is by netting and 
boxing every glittering fly which comes within one's reach.
This 
wholesale imprisonment idea smacks of cruelty, but only applies to 
mere naturalist novices, as the more advanced ichneumon ologists are 
very soon enabled to form an adequate idea as to which insects 
they require, and which they do not.
Every species should be placed 
with a number and small piece of paper attached, descriptive of 
locality, date of capture, and full particulars 5 or, better still, index 
your note-book, and detail all memoranda there corresponding with 
the numbers in the cabinet.
As my friend Mr. G.
T. Porritt would 
observe, the best instructor of a naturalist is his note-book." Let 
me inform intending students that ichneumons require care and 
diligence illimitable, and unless they are prepared to take up the 
gauntlet in real earnest, it is better left untouched.
If it is to be 
done at all, let it be well done.
Another method of capture is the 
ordinary one employed by entomologists in larva-getting, viz., shaking 
the branches of trees into an umbrella or contrivance made for the 
N. S., YoL.

purpose.
Along vrith a medley of rubbish and insect life, the result 
will reveal most likely plenty of ichneumons.
On arriving on the 
gingham," they aptpear to be momentarily paralysed and bewildered, 
but long before " time " is called, and unless one is very quick and 
active, the little insect recovers from its temporary embarrassment, 
and flies away, perchance laughing at your gaping mouth and 
astonished features.
Anticipate escape by prompt action, out with 
the pill-box.
and in with your Pimpla, or whatever it proves to 
be.
But the difficulty of obtaining specimens is by no means insuper- 
able : the difficulty is in getting them well named when caught.
Let 
the collector once obtain a start in the nomenclature of insects by 
getting well acquainted with the more common ones, and the rest will 
soon follow.
Breeding is an essential and interesting part of the programme, 
and well worth a lot of trouble.
It facilitates observation and the 
taking of notes, fixing upon memory facts worth working for, and 
which no amount of out-door labour could as effectually realise.
I 
always prefer to keep my chrysalis cage moderately damp, and for 
this purpose adopt the practice of growing some moss in it.
The 
cage is divided into two compartments by a glass square, one half 
covered with moss on the bottom, and the other portion strewn with 
twigs, rotten wood, and dry earth, giving free access for the insect or 
larva to choose its own whereabouts.
The glass division may be 
shaped according to the ingenuity and desire of the workman.
At the 
top is a spiral-spring shaped glass tube, perforated with holes to allow 
the water poured into it to drop into the cage.
By means of an 
ordinary funnel made to fit into the top end of the tube, water can be 
passed into it at any time when required.
The base of the wetted 
half of cage should also be well perforated so as to prevent stagnation, 
the partition let into the wood deep enough to prevent the water from 
the wetted half travelling through, and directly underneath the former 
a tank or basin is placed to receive the water.
If this basin is adopted 
a tube may be fixed through the bottom, and by this contrivance a 
small branch of a tree or a plant can be used for a considerable 
period, and constantly renewed, adaptable for feeding larvse if 
required, receiving a supply of water from the basin and through the 
tube, which must be corked up when in disuse.
Something of this 
character will be found very useful, especially when aU our feeding- 
cages are taxed to the uttermost, and when saving time is an object 
with the breeder.
As the period comes round for the larva to select 
BaIESTOW : icHNEUMONID.1!.
163 
a conTenient spot wherein to undergo its metaniorpiiosis, there Tvill 
then be offered plenty of places and ample room to suit the most 
fastidious taste, and the cage will come in alike useful both to grub 
and to breeder.
Every workman prefers good tools, and I must 
confess, for my own part, to a decided partiality for adaptable 
apparatus.
Ichneumons do not succumb to fumes of potassic cyanide, chloro- 
form, or laurel leaves as soon as do various genera of lepidopterous 
insects, and very often when released from the killing bottle we notice 
with chagrin that they are " coming round " ; nevertheless as facile 
and expeditious methods of removal for larger-bodied ones, such as 
some of the genus Metopius or Amhlyteles, and others, I cannot find 
better.
Numerous entomologists strap their insects to setting boards, 
by means of small slips of card, through the extremities of which pins 
are pierced, and into the wood at either edge of the wings, thus 
avoiding damage, yet firmly fixing them.
Xow this is undoubtedly 
a fair idea for lepidoptera, as the wings of moths and butterflies are 
feathered, and very liable to be defaced ; but it scarcely acts as 
efficiently for hymenoptera.
The wings of ichneamons are similar in 
texture to the wrappers employed for sweet-packets, consequently the 
smooth surface renders them likely to slip away from the card, and 
when we return to unstrap them from the setting-board, to our 
astonishment the insect is set certainly, but quite unfit for any cabinet.
The better plan is to use thread and wind it aroimd both insect and 
board.
It can do your ichneumon very little if any harm.
By drawing 
the thread around and across we can fix our capture without fear of 
accidents.
Where a travelling case is used, the cardboard slips are 
apt to produce insect slips, bodies and wings falling out of position.
Loose setting boards have numerous and obvious disadvantages, and 
though answering in part for home use, they are utterly inadequate 
for journeying purposes.
I would advise every collector to keep a 
travelling-case.
Setting-boards must be of different dimensions, to 
suit all sizes of insects, and each one is spliced with a wooden base to 
run in a groove, the whole kept in position by the lid when closed.
Drawers will be found useful, also corked lid and an empty shelf.
The box can be manufactured with two lids if desired, so as to provide 
a case arrangement, in which to deposit the insects when taken from 
the boards.
Mr. W.
D. Roebuck's advice (quoted from Ent. Ann..
1874, p.
128, 
by Rev. T.
A. Marshall) is as follows : — " Any small-winged hyme- 
nopteron, if left to itself is sure to dry with the wings doubled up, or 
164 
The NATURAJ.I8T.
concealing the characters of the abdomen, &c., in some way that 
renders its identification or description impossible.
Much has been said 
against carding specimens intended for examination, but the objections 
apply less to parasitic hymenoptera than to most other kinds of 
insects.
The parts of the mouth are only of secondary value, and the 
leading characters are nearly always taken from the upper surface.
Without knowing what others may be able to do, I can say for myself 
that I rarely succeed in naming small obscure specimens unless neatly 
displayed upon cards.
As to running pins through the thorax or 
scutellum, obliterating the most characteristic parts of the body, it is 
generally throwing away all chance of identification.
When a small 
insect of this kind is carded, the legs should be stretched sufficiently 
to allow a side glance of the coxae, which are often important ; and if 
the head is prevented from resting forehead downwards on the card, 
so that the face can be seen, the maximum of convenience will be 
attained." Notwithstanding this most excellent modus operandi^ 
minute species are yet and will ever be difficult to identify on cards, 
as whatever portion of the insect is fixed to the paper, it must neces- 
sarily be out of sight and out of mind.
The entire frame of a small 
insect subjected to microscopic examination for determining, must by 
reason of its smallness be important in its entirety — hence the 
dilemma.
For average-sized hymenoptera (small yet not minute) I 
find that a slender pin glued underneath the centre of a small paper 
slip, and over which the insect is gently fixed, allows facility for 
bending the paper and obtaining the requisite scrutiny.
For the 
most minute insects use strong card-braces shaped to a point, — and 
place the specimen as far on the end as the acuteness of the point and 
adhesiveness of gum will permit.
Where more than one is admitted 
into the cabinet, more than one brace can be supported by the pin.
CHAPTER IV.
THE CABINET.
Each youthful collector is inspired with ideas the practical realisation 
of which is often contracted by the limits of the purse.
When a few 
insects are gathered together, or even whilst there is 
*' About his shelves 
A beggarly account of empty boxes," 
a glorious notion gradually insinuates itself into his mind, and he 
must have a cabinet at all hazards.
Every power is invoked, and no 
stone left unturned which can possibly assist in the achievement of this 
grand object.
It is, nevertheless, a mistake equally premature and 
mischievous.
Never buy a cabinet until able to obtain one of a 
BaiRSTOW : ICHNEUMONID^.
165 
first-rate quality ; let it be of such a character that it will last a 
lifetime, and be satisfied that the manufacturer is up to this sort 
of thing.
What can be more annoying, after expending several 
pounds upon a cabinet, after using every endeavour to place our 
insects in good and scientific array, and after working hard and long, 
to find a great big crack on the outside of the case, gradually but 
most surely widening — a consequence of inferior workmanship or of 
badly-seasoned wood 1 Again, consign the cabinet to the care of an 
" old hand." My own is made up of cases book-shaped, bought at 
intervals until the whole of the order taken up is represented either by 
insects themselves or by names.
The book shape I prefer on account 
of its being a superior preventative against dust, contrasted with 
drawers which lay flat in the cabinet and give more freedom of 
access for the dust to accumulate.
I may be possessed of somewhat 
old-fashioned prejudices, yet notwithstanding all the agitation about 
the question of mite-destroyers, and the particularly vindictive 
epithets applied to the use of camphor, I have still a lingering regard 
for, if not belief in, the efficacy of that estimable commodity.
If it 
does no good, it can certainly do but little harm.
When used, a small 
r^ceptack or incision should be made in some portion of the case, to 
prevent the crystals from tumbling amongst the insects, and causing 
demolition or accidents.
Whether a ridiculous preventive of these 
little Acari or otherwise, it is a fact that my own specimens have not 
been extensively victimised, and it is equally a fact that I have used 
no other " destroyer " ; but failing camphor (as I am well aware of 
the existence of powerful objections), corrosive sublimate and benzo- 
line are very good.
Let the insects be numbered respectively in the 
cabinet, and a book kept to correspond, with all necessary particulars, 
adjacent.
Marshall's catalogue, rebound with interleaves, answers all 
requirements.
CHAPTER V.
— LITERATURE.
One of the greatest difficulties one has to contend with in the study 
of parasitic hymenoptera is exposed in this fact — the literature is 
scanty and mostly foreign.
Of late years, however, the number of 
books has been largely and efficiently augmented, and I believe several 
works on this subject are at this moment in course of publication.
To 
the student two things are altogether indispensable — a good corres- 
ponding authority, and a British catalogue of known species.
Of the 
latter no better is extant than the one published by Eev. T, A.
Marshall (a work already alluded to), which will serve as an excellent 
166 
The Naturalist.
basis for the nomenclature of British species.
A catalogue is also in 
print containing the names of all the parasitic hymenoptera pertaining 
to the British Museum.
The best work undoubtedly offered to the 
public is Dr. Snellen van Volleuhoven's " Pinacographia," containing 
over 1000 figures, all remarkably well executed, and in cases where 
insects are shown magnified, dimension lines are given alongside.
The main points of construction delineating specific difierences are 
also particularised where needful.
Altogether, as a first-class work 
on an immature subject it cannot be too strongly recommended.
An 
English translation is rendered with the Dutch.
In the introduction 
to the book the author says : — " The text is a matter of secondary 
importance, and will only contain the explanation of the plates, 
diagnoses, and short descriptions of new species, with analytical 
tables and some remarks on biology.
Meanwhile it may be possible 
that the drawing of such a number of figures will procure me so much 
knowledge of the different genera, that I may be induced at the end 
of this work to give a general systematic review of the families 
examined." Until the appearance of this book doubtless the illustra- 
tions of works of a similar character were radically bad (I mean with 
respect to diagrams), and more especially to early students of the 
order this fact appeared as an insuperable barrier to progression.
Figures of hymenoptera are more valuable than descriptions, and 
consequently we must hail " Pinacographia " as a changing-point of 
the defection.
Most works on ichneumons are foreign, and lie inter- 
spersed amongst other groups.
The monographs by Holmgren 
(which can be purchased at a fair price) are notorious, and foremost 
in the literature of parasitic hymenoptera is Gravenhorst's Ichneu- 
monologia Europsea," from which indirectly emanated the publications 
of Ratzeburg and Desvignes.
Various works and scattered fragments 
are also to be met with, by Forster, Wesmael, Curtis, Marshall, and 
others, and chance articles in the British magazines.
M. Ed. Andre, 
member of the French Entomological Society, has forwarded to me a 
prospectus of a work he is publishing, entitled " Species des Hymen- 
opteres d' Europe." I believe he intends to commence his work with 
the Tenthredinida^ taking up afterwards Ichneumonidce and Braconida ; 
and if the book treats upon one-half of that which is specified in the 
prospectus, it promises to be an excellent undertaking.
And lastly, 
for Yorkshire hymenopterists we have Mr. Roebuck's inaugurative 
paper in the Transactions of the Yorkshire Union ; but he shames 
Yorkshire collectors by being only able to give a list of known county 
insects numbering 50 or 60 species.
It is but a sorry compliment to 
Meade : On Parasitic Diptera.
167 
our " big " county.
We have unlimited scope, with only limited 
interest — the harvest is plenteous, but the labourers are few." 
During the year 1878 I have many new county insects to report, of 
which I have made a careful list, but I shall be obliged to refrain 
from giving it here, as it is already sent to the " Transactions." 
Now, I should leave a cloud on the horizon of my conscience if this 
paper were to be closed without my giving a dig in the ribs of (what 
shall I call them ?) those stingy, meaningless individuals who perti- 
naciously and miserly stick to odd specimens which they come across, 
without knowing or seeking to know their names.
They are of no 
earthly use to them unless as a study, but the insect is appropriated 
and the study ignored.
Let them rather send them to some person 
who collects the order, or send them for purposes of identification and 
record.
Or, again, if they go upon the " penny saved, penny gained," 
or " thing of beauty " principle, and don't like to part with the insect, 
I would ask them to obtain a name for it, and duly record it in some 
such medium as our own Naturalist.
For my own part I shall be 
most happy to send back all specimens forwarded to me, and have to 
thank most sincerely Messrs.
Porritt, Roebuck, Mosley, Carter, 
Smethurst and others, for their great kindness in this respect.
In conclusion, I would remind such (un)naturalists as those I have 
alluded to, that upon the back of one of our scientific magazines there 
exists a couple of lines which it would be well if they learnt off by 
heart, viz : — 
" By mutual confidence and mutual aid, 
Great deeds are done, and great discoveries made."

ON PARASITIC DIPTERA.
By R.
H. Meade.
The flies which live in the larval state within the bodies of the larvae 
of other insects which they eat and slowly destroy are very little 
known even by dipterists.
They are very numerous in species, but 
few individually, and are therefore not very frequently seen.
They 
are mostly found upon flowers, for though so destructive to other 
insects while larv^, they are perfectly harmless in the imago state ; 
their mouths then being only adapted for sip|)ing sweets.
In their 
turn, however, they now sometimes get killed by other flies : for 
instance, I once captured a specimen of Asilus (a highly voracious fly) 
which had a female Trixa oestroides in its clutches.

The Naturalist.
The Tachiniidoe, as the family is called, are very difficult to name 
and describe, individuals of the same species varying greatly in size 
and even structure, and distinct species being very closely related to 
each other ; so it is only by the examination and comparison of 
numerous specimens that it is possible to acquire a critical knowledge 
of them.
There are many points of great interest respecting their 
natural history, one of the greatest being whether the same species 
of fly generally or always selects the same species of larva, or whether 
different species attack the larva of the same insect.
Systematic 
authors give but little information upon this subject, though a few 
desultory facts have been recorded ; thus it is quite unknown upon 
what caterpillar the larva of our largest species {Echinomyia grossa) 
feeds.
In this (dipterology) as in other branches of entomology, the 
determination and arrangement of species possess much more attrac- 
tion than the higher and more philosophical part of the science, viz., 
the study of the habits and manners of insects.
We really know very 
little more now respecting the economy of the parasitic diptera than 
what was recorded long ago by those giants in entomology — De Geer 
and Eeaumur.
Being interested in the study of Tachiniidoe, I am induced to make 
these few remarks in the hope that some of the numerous lepidop- 
terists who are readers of this journal may be led to assist me by 
carefully preserving all diptera (I do not want hymenopterous para- 
sites, though they are equally interesting) which may issue from the 
cocoons of butterflies or moths in their breeding cages, taking note of 
the species from the cocoon of which they are bred.
I will gladly 
undertake to name (as far as I can) any of the flies sent to me, and in 
this way some definite knowledge of their economy may be in time 
obtained.
About two years ago, Mr. Mosley, of Huddersfield, kindly sent me 
two or three specimens of Exorista vulgaris, which he had bred from 
Thecla quercus, and last year Mr. B.
Cooke, of Southport (late of 
Bowden), gave me one of Nemorea maculosa, which issued from the 
cocoon of Botys verticalis.
I have received a great many species from 
other entomologists, but, with the above exceptions, without any 
notice of the insect upon which they were parasitic.
To give some idea of the extent of this family, I may mention in 
conclusion that Meigen describes 315 European species in his great 
work on diptera, and F.
"Walker, 166 British ones in the second vol.
of the " Insecta Britannica," and says he only includes half of them.

— Mr. E.
M. Holmes, 
F.L.S., having been good enough to send me specimens in fruit of this 
rare moss from a ne-^y locality, perhaps a few remarks upon it may not be 
uninteresting.
The (English) history of this moss is as follows : — It was 
first discovered many years ago by the Rev. IVIr. Tozer, at Trethowell, 
Dear Truro, in W.
Cornwall, and, according to Wilson, a specimen was 
sent to Prof.
W. Arnott, named Didymodon pusillum operculo rostrato." 
At the time when Wilson's ^'Bryologia" was published, this was tho 
only British locality and specimen.
More recently it was found by Mr.
Holmes sparingly at Bickley Vale, in S.
Devon, but not at the time 
recognised, owing to the capsules being old and without lid.
The third 
find was at Saltash, in E.
Cornwall, by Mr. F.
Brent, of Plymouth, and 
on specimens being sent to IVIr. Holmes, he at once recognised it, the 
plants being in good condition.
Again it was found by I\Ir. P.
V. Tellam, 
at Sunny Corner, near Truro, in 1871 : possibly, but not certainly, the 
original locality of Mr. Tozer.
And lastly, JMr. Holmes has found it in 
fruit, at Easter in the present year, at Tamerton Ffolliott, in S.
Devon, 
about four miles from the Cornish locality at Saltash : Bickley Yale is 
about eight miles further east.
There are thus two Cornish and two 
Devon locahties.
It seems at present to be confined in Britain entirely 
to Watson's first province.

peninsula, 
and ]\Iid-peninsula, and its comital distribution is 1, 2, 3, W.

E. Cornwall, and S.

It differs from D.
homomallum (some of 
the smaller forms of which it resembles), in its time of fruiting — March 
and April — the latter ripening its capsules in the autumn ; in its shorter 
seta and shorter oval capsules, not ovate-oblong or elliptical, and in its 
obhquely rostellate, not short and conical lid, and also by its old capsules 
being usually a little bent to one side, and in its monoicous inflorescence.
It always grows in shady hollows, in hedgebanks, lanes, &c.

is certain to be not only interesting and readable, but full of useful infor-

This little work is no exception, either in style or matter ; it 
details the author's experiments in attempting to breed this " vastest of

Mr. Gosse gives the whole life-history of this giant 
from the egg to the perfect imago, chiefly from his own experiments and 
observations, and carries the reader with him in such a captivating manner 
as to make him wish he had been the companion of his labours.
We 
have read the whole with much profit, and the best recommendation we 
can give of it, is —to all our friends, whether general entomologists or 
those specially interested in the introduction of silk-producing moths — 
go and do likewise.

Barnsley Naturalists' Society.
— Meetings April 29th and May 
13th, Mr. T.
Lister presiding.
— This is usually a period of great interest 
in marking the arrivals of spring migrants, but owing to the severe 
season they are late in making their appearance, with a few exceptions.
Mr. W.
Talbot of Wakefield reports the wheatear our first spring visitor, 
March 22, and three sand martins on the Calder April 5 ; also the yellow 
or Ray's wagtail, all from five to eight days before their average time.
But the most exceptionally early was the wood warbler April 8th, due 
May 3 (not yet heard in our woods).
Mr. S.
Tomlinson, of New Park 
Spring, observed the chifi'-chafi" April 1, and Mr. Lister saw and heard it 
in Greenfoot-lane April 5 ; on same day Mr. J.
Matthews of Clayton- 
west saw the wheatear.
The cuckoo was seen by Mr. Senior, Tyer's- 
hill, April 7, and by the president in same neighbourhood on Good 
Friday, and three willow warblers same time.
None of the above birds 
sang, owing to the cold.
The first song of the cuckoo was reported April 
17th at Rockley.
The swallow was seen by Mr. Barker near Old Mill, 
April 17th, by Mr. W.
Carrington April 19th, by Mr. Lister and others 
on several succeeding days ; the house martin seen by Mr. Alderson at 
Swithern April 21 ; the whinchat seen in Clifi" Wood same date.
It was 
seen by Mr. Tomlinson April 17 ; he records the tree pipit April 21, the 
grasshopper warbler 22nd, the black-cap warbler 23rd, the redstart 25th 
April.
Mr. H.
Garland of Wood Hall saw the swallow April I7th, and 
the whitethroat April 22nd.
Mr. J.
Smith reported Ray's wagtail April 
8th, and the tree pipit April 15th ; the lesser whitethroat was seen April 
28th ; Mr. E.
Watson of Darfield saw the grey flycatcher in his garden 
April 23 ; he also saw the snow-bunting (a winter visitant not yet gone to 
the north).
He also recorded the sandpiper April 25.
The most choice 
records are two pairs of pied flycatchers seen by Mr. H.
Teasdale on the 
2Tid and 3rd May, near Clarke's colliery, a new locality.
Wentworth 
Castle, and sometimes Cannon Hall have been frequented by this beau- 
tiful bird.
Last and best, the nightingale was reported May 1st ; Mr.
Lister had the pleasure of hearing it on the 3rd, though a cold day.
Several flowers were laid on the table and examined, and the dates given.

Fergusson, from the following different 
localities : — Ben Lawers, Clova, Braemar, Brechin, and Cape Cater in 
the Arctic regions ; also Pottia ti'uncata, from Kirkheaton, Huddersfield, 
and new to the district.
Entomology : Mr. G.
T. Porritt exhibited the 
following Crambites : — Cramhus alpinellus and C.
adipellus, Homceosoma

Bairstow, living larvse of Lithosia camplanula, found on rocks at Llanrwst.
Mr. George Brook, ter., a living larva of Cossus ligniperda, from Alderley 
Edge.
Ornithology : Mr. James Varley showed the gizzard of a ptarmi- 
gan which was filled with catkins, apparently of birch.
He also reported 
the arrival of spring migrants as follows : — Willow warbler April 15th, at 
Mirfield ; chiffchaff and sand martin April 15th, wheatear April 16th, 
swallow April 19th, at Wakefield ; cuckoo April 29th, and martin April 
30th, at Huddersfield.
It was remarked that these dates were unusuaUy 
late, doubtless owing to the severe spring weather.
The secretary (Mr.
George Brook, ter.) then read an interesting and valuable paper, entitled 
Notes on Colembola and Thysanura.^' He illustrated it with Uving 
specimens of Campodea staphylinus found in the district, and with 
mounted specimens of many other species.

— Monthly 
meeting, April 2Ttli, Mr. S.
J. Capper, president, in tlie chair.
A paper 
was read by ]Mr. W.
H. Heyworth, of Alderley-edge, on ^^The Lepidoptera 
of Mid-Cheshire." A communication was also read, supplied through the 
kindness of IVIr. T.
J. Moore, from Mr. Dunkinfield Jones, of Woolton, who 
is at present studying the lepidoptera of Brazil, in which IVIr. Jones gives 
some interesting details respecting the miniature stages of several species 
of the genera Morpho and Papilio, with special reference to the venomous 
nature of certain larvae of that district.
The chairman then drew the 
attention of the meeting to the efforts now being made by IMiss E.
A. Orme- 
rod, Isleworth, and IVIr. E.
A. Fitch, Maldon, with other gentlemen, to 
interest entomologists generally in observing and recording the appearance 
and economy of certain insects annually selected, which were specially 
injurious to crops.
In presenting the report of last year's, observations 
to the meeting, the chairman impressed on the members the advi- 
sability of aiding, as far as was in their power, these efforts.
The 
insects selected for observation during the present year were sixteen in 
number, and IVIiss Ormerod would be glad to furnish any member or 
other gentleman interested in the subject, and willing to record his 
observations, with a printed form for that purpose.
The usual con- 
versazione terminated the meeting.

— The second meeting for 1879 was 
held at Harrogate on Saturday, the 10th of May. The ornithologists 
turned up in strongest force, the Pateley Bridge district being, from its 
varied character, specially attractive to them.
The main body of excur- 
sionists visited Pateley, and only a very few investigated the immediate 
neighbourhood of Harrogate.

secretary; to Mr. John Yorke, of Pateley, for permission to visit his 
grounds at Ravensgill and Guyscliffe ; to Capt.
Williams, for accompanying 
a party down the lead mines at Greenhow Hill ; and to Mr. Thomas 
Thorpe, of Pateley, for his willing co-operation in general.
The reports 
of sections being called for, on behalf of the Conchological Section, Mr.
John Emmett reported that only two shells had been found.
Messrs.
S. D.
Bairstow and G.
T. Porritt reported on behaK of the Entomo- 
logical Section : — In consequence of the cold frosty weather no lepidoptera 
had been noticed, and only a few species of coleoptera, hymenoptera, 
and neuroptera.
In the Botanical Section Dr. Parsons reported as 
follows ; — The localities explored during the day were Harrogate, Knares- 
"borough, Pateley Bridge, Pavensgill, Greenhow, Markington, Brimham 
Rocks, &c.
Owing to the extreme backwardness of the season, compara- 
tively few flowering plants were seen.

The Lichens, 20, were mostly the ordinary species, with the exception of 
Lecidea geographica on gritstone at Markington — a somewhat unusual 
habitat.
Among Algae Lemania fluviatilis, and among Fungi Agaricus 
umbelliferus, Rhytisina acerinum, and Stegia ilicis were observed.
A 
list of fresh-water alg^ observed in the neighbourhood of Markington by 
the Rev. J.

It contained 50 
species.
IMr. J.
Spencer, of Halifax, gave the report of the Geological 
Section, which had not been very successful in a Palseontological point 
of view, but otherwise the geology of the district was deeply interesting.

formation, which lies unconformably upon a bed of massive but rather 
soft dark red rock, of a gritty nature, but whether it belonged to the 
millstone grit or not he could not say, from so brief an examination.
Following the line of the permian escarpment along the banks of the 
river Nidd, Grimbald's Crag was reached, which consists of a great mass 
of magnesian limestone, resting unconformably upon a bed of pebbly grit 
belonging unmistakeably to the millstone grit series.
Between the 
permian and the millstone grit the great coal formation generally lies, 
but in the neighbourhood of Harrogate that formation is entirely absent.
It was the generally received opinion that the coal formation of Yorkshire 
was once continuous with that of Durham and Northumberland, as 
undoubtedly it was with that of Lancashire.
If such was the case, there 
must have been a great interval of time between the deposition of the 
coal-measures and the formation of the permian rocks, during which 
mighty disturbances took place, and the coal formation was swept off the 
grit rocks from Yorkshire to Durham.
The evidences of these disturb- 
ances abound in this neighbourhood.
The Yoredale rocks, for instance, 
which occupy a space about two miles broad by four miles long, stretching 
south-west from Harrogate to Pannal, were quite out of place.
They had 
been subjected to enormous pressure, folded and contorted in all manner 
of ways, and thrust up between the grit rocks to a level with them.
At 
Beckwith quarry, near Beckwith House, the effects of the upheaving and 
disturbing forces could be plainly seen, for the rocks were folded and 
contorted into a series of anticlinal and synclinal curves and broken 
up into fragments.
The spa wells of Low Harrogate most probably owe 
their existence to the same causes.
The Yoredale rocks abound in 
fossiliferous beds, and wherever these crop out at the surface in low 
ground, and water oozes from them, the decomposition of the fossils gives 
rise to sulphurous and other mineral springs.
The great number of 
mineral springs which occur in the Bog Fields is evidently due to the 
peculiarly folded nature of the rocks there.
The rainwater sinking into 
the upturned edges of those folds, and percolating through the fossilife- 
rous beds, which contain a large amount of sulphur and other minerals, 
oozes out in the Bog Fields as mineral springs.
In the Vertebrate 
Section ]\Ir. Lister reported as follows : — In a quick walk from Pannal to 
Harrogate, fourteen resident and four migratory birds were noticed.
Of 
these, four were not noted in the longer excursion to Pateley and the 
moors around, viz., magpie, jackdaw, lesser redpole, and swallow.
Of 
resident birds at Pateley Nidderdale, 31 were observed, the most 
important being the sparrow hawk, merlin, carrion crow, grey wagtail, 
curlew, stone chat (a partial migrant), golden plover, red grouse, lapwing, 
snipe, and mountain linnet.
Of spring migrants seven were noticed — the 
whinchat, willow warbler, redstart, blackcap, tree pipit, sand martin, 
and ring ousel ; of other animals — the viper, short-tailed field vole, and 
long-eared bat.

AT a Meeting of the VERTEBRATE SECTION of the YORKSHIRE 
NATURALISTS' UNION, held at Ingleton on the I4th of April, it 
was resolved to publish as the commencement of series B of the " Transactions " 
of the Union a LIST OP THE BIRDS OF YORKSHIRE, to 
include all recorded ocoirrences of the rarer species as far as is practicable.
Its compilation was placed in my hands.
1 now appeal to all our ornitholo- 
gists to give me their best assistance in the work by sending at once from all 
parts of the county LISTS, with remarks as to the distribution, abundance, 
breeding, and rare occurrences of the ACCIPITRES (Eagles, Hawks, and 
Owls) only, as the work will have to be done gradually.
When the list of 
this group is completed, it is contemplated to apply for information on the 
next succeeding group.
All assistance will be duly acknowledged.

Blackbird, March lOth.
— At Blackhill I observed an exceedingly 
beautiful pied specimen of tbis species, the shoulders and back of 
the neck being liberally dashed with pure white.
Dipper, April 16th.
— My friend Mr. Harrison found a nest con- 
taining four young birds — an early date for young ones.
Swallow, April 21st.
— I observed this species for the first time this 
season.
Sandpiper, April 22nd.
— This migrant had arrived on the Nidd.
Stockdove, April 22nd.
— I found a nest, with two eggs slightly 
incubated, in a hollow tree at Wilstrop.
Redshank and Snipe, April 27th.
— These species breeding on Stren- 
sall Common, where I obtained their eggs.
Grasshoppee Warbler, April 27th.
— I observed this species on 
Strensall Common, where I have no doubt it breeds.
Teal, April 28th.
— A family party, consistiug of a parent bird and 
nine young ones, on one of the lagoons on Strensall Common.
On 
observing us the old bird conducted the youug to a small rushy 
island, and then took flight.
Wishing to examine the young, 
three of us waded to the island, thinking we should have no 
difficulty in finding them, as the island was very small, and was 
situate in the centre of the lagoon ; but although we searched it 
thoroughly our efforts were all in vain.
Where they got to we 
could never tell.
Cuckoo, April 28th.
— One heard at Crossgates.
Golden Plover and Curlew, May 4th.
— Four nests of each of 
these species, containing 30 eggs, were found by my friends and 
myself on the moors above Ilkley.
Grasshopper Warbler and Wren, May 4th.
— I observed both 
these species quite on the moors — rather an unusual locality.
Ring-ouzel, May 4th.
— A nest ready for eggs among the heather on 
the moors above Ilkley.
This nest a week afterwards contained 
five eggs.
N. S., Vol. iv., July, 1879.

Swift, May 6th.
— At Kirkstall.
Spotted Flycatcher, Garden Warbler, Whitethroat, and Keed 
Bunting, May 26th, — All nesting at Bishop's Wood.
EuFF or Reeye, August 30th.
— An immature specimen shot at 
Kilnsea, now in my collection.
Turnstone, Sept.
1st.
— Some thousands of these birds on the shore 
near Spurn.
Judging from their great tameness they had arriyed 
during the night, and were tired ; they would allow me to approach 
within ten yards, and I was much interested in watching them 
turn over the debris at high-water mark, in search of sandhoppers, 
&c.
Many of the birds were still in their beautiful summer dress, 
but the greater number were birds of the year.
— Sept.
2nd, the 
turnstones have split up into small parties, consisting of five or 
six birds, and are very difficult to approach.
Wood Sandpiper, Sept.
2nd.
— It affords me great pleasure to place 
on record the occurrence of this uncommon bird in Yorkshire.
My 
friend Mr. Hewetson shot one, in my presence, as it was feeding on 
a drain side, near the village of Kilnsea.
This bird is now in my 
collection.
Sandeeling, Sept.
2nd.
— This species in its beautiful mottled 
plumage above, and silvery white beneath, was pretty numerous.
I obtained a few fine specimens.
Knot, Sept.
2nd.
— A few immature specimens of this species with 
the buff breast observed.
The main body has not yet arri7ed from 
the far north.
Oystercatcher, Sept.
2nd.
— A family of four at Spurn.
They have 
evidently nested in the neighbouring sandhills.
Lesser Tern, Sept.
2nd.
— A few of this summer visitant to our 
coasts seen.
The main body has already departed south.
Eedshank, Dunlin, Hinged Plover, and Curlew, Sept.
1st to 
7th.
Numerous on the Humber muds.
Great Blackback, Lesser Blackback, Herring and Blackheaded 
Gulls ; Kittiwake and Common Tern, September 1st to 7th.
— 
Observed on the coast.
Curlew Sandpiper, Sept.
7th.
— I obtained a fine specimen out of a 
small party of dunlins, in whose company it was feeding at low- 
water mark, at Kilnsea.
It was an immature bird, and in this 
plumage difficult to distinguish from the dunlin; but it maybe 
known by its long curved bill, white tail coverts, and buff breast.

Bartailed Godwit, Sept.
26tlL.
— Two .shot on the Humber and 
forwarded to me.
Goatsucker, Oct. 28rd.
— A fine female shot at Easington, where it 
frequented the gardens for some days.
On being opened, its 
stomach was found to be filled with small ColeojAera.
This is a 
late date for this species to remain with us.
Godwit, Oct 26th.
— I observed a godwit feeding on the Humber 
muds.
From its size I think it must have been a " bartail," which 
is the commoner species on our coast.
Kedwing, Oct, 26th.
— This winter visitant numerous on Spurn; I 
was unable to ascertain the date of its arrival.
"Wrex, Oct. 26th.
— Very numerous among the buckthorn on Spurn 
point.
Great Titmouse, Oct. 26th.
— A pair of these birds trying to make 
themselves at home on some stunted railings at the village of 
Spurn, where there are no trees, and all is sand.
They were 
evidently immigrants.
This opinion is confirmed by Mr. Cordeaux's 
excellent account of the " Autumn Migrations of 1878," (^coZ., 
Feb., 1879.) 
Grey Plover, Oct. 26th.
— This northern species numerous, feeding 
singly on the muds.
Sanderlixg, Oct. 28th.- — Xot so numerous as I found them in Sep- 
tember.
They have changed their mottled plumage, and put on a 
delicate grey above, the silvery white breast remaining unchanged.
This is their winter plumage.
KxoT, Oct. 28th.
— Flocks containing some thousands seen at high 
water.
As the tide recedes they spread themselves over the miles 
of mud.
This species has now assumed its grey and white winter 
plumage.
Swallow and Martin, Oct. 28th.
— I saw a few of each of these 
species on the wing at Spurn — a late date.
Fieldfare, Oct. 28th.
— This species arriving incessantly in parties 
of from thirty to fifty individuals, the whole day from the E.X.E.
All seemed to be very tired, and to fly almost mechanically.
They 
have had a rough passage, the wind blowing fresh from the N.W.
On arriving at Spurn some of these parties went south, whilst 
others pursued an easterly course.
This immigration commenced 
yesterday.
Ring Ouzel, Oct. 28th.
— I observed two birds of this species flying 
in from the sea.

The Naturalist.
Blackbird, Oct. 28th.
— Numbers of this species arriving at Spurn.
Grey Crow and Jackdaw.
— Arriving in parties from N.E. A grey- 
crow attempted to carry off a sanderling I had shot, as it lay in the 
water, although I was within about thirty yards of it.
Siskin, Oct. 29th.
— I watched for some time, at a distance of only a 
few feet, a party of five of this species ; they were feeding on some 
low seed-bearing herbs on the roadside at Easington.
In their 
movements they reminded me much of our familiar lesser redpoll.
Purple Sandpiper, Oct. 29th.
— I obtained a pair of these birds 
(male and female) out of a party of three, as they were feeding at 
high-water mark on the beach.
They were in full winter plumage, 
which is the most handsome in this species.
Wheatear, Oct. 29th.
— I shot a wheatear having a deformed bill ; 
the lower mandible being bent down at an angle, allowed the upper 
one to meet it only at the base.
In spite of this it was in good 
condition.
Goldfinch, Dec. 26th.
— A small flock in some market gardens in the 
Meanwood-road, Leeds.
This is the first instance that I have 
heard of this species being seen near Leeds ; it is uncommon in 
the county.
Blackbird, Thrush, and Redwing, December.
— These species 
perished in thousands during the severe weather.
The Spurn 
postman informs me that about Christmas was the most deadly 
period.
He saw hundreds of dead blackbirds, thrushes, and red- 
wings, but most of the latter species.
But it is indeed " an ill 
wind that blows no one any good," for the grey crows were in 
clover, and, to use the expression of my informant, grew as fat 
as butter " on the starved, weak birds.

The 
genus Exorista belonging to the family Muscidse and sub-family 
Tachiniidge, may be thus brielly characterised: — Eyes hairy; 
antennae with the third joint more than twice the length of the 
second ; style quite bare ; oral vibrissae not extending more than 
half way up the face ; wings with the first posterior (or middle) cell 
open at its extremity, and terminating before the tip of the wing ; 
abdomen oval, with the first ring short.

face oblique, silky white ; antennae with the first joint very short, the 
second somewhat elongated, the third stout and between two and 
three times as long as the second; style with both the nasal joints 
very short and indistinct, the third long, quite bare, and thickened

seated one on each corner of the apistome, above which a few small 
ones, gradually decreasing in size, extend up about one-third of the 
face ; palpi yellow for about half their length, but black at the base.
Thorax blue black, with grey reflexions on the anterior margin and 
shoulders ; has four narrow longitudinal black stripes, the middle 
pair rather wide apart, and indistinct posteriorly.
Scutellum blue- 
black.
Abdomen tessellated with black and white reflexions, 
arranged in irregular bands on the three posterior segments, and 
marked on the dorsum with a longitudinal black stripe, which is

[The parasite described above I bred from one of the larvae of A alni 
sent to me from Wakefield by Mr. William Talbot, in Sept., 1877

One or two other specimens emerged 
from the same larva, which I gave to Mr. S.

possibly there may be a female amongst them.

PERSISTENT VARIATION AMONG THE BRITISH 
SPECIES OF BUTTERFLIES * 
By S.
L. Mosley.
\^ead before Members of the Hudclersjield Scientific Club, \%th April, 1879.] 
In the following paper I have simply gathered together information 
which, so far as I am aware, has hitherto been scattered, at any rate 
so far as the British species is concerned.
On the continent of 
Europe they pay a great deal more attention to persistent varieties 
than we do in England ; perhaps they make rather too much of them 
sometimes by giving names to varieties of very trivial importance — 
scarcely distinguishable from their types.
But on the other hand, 
British collectors are too prone to pass over well-marked and distinct 
forms as not being worth notice — at any rate, not worth having a 
name given to them, and hitherto their very isolated ideas have pre- 
cluded them from naming varieties in common with the continental 
entomologists.
What British lepidopterist, for instance, if asked if 
he took Coenonympha Pamphilus, var.
lyllus, in his district, could give 
a satisfactory answer ?
Yet, I presume, few collectors have not taken 
this form of that very common insect, and numerous other similar 
instances might be named.
I think it well that we should know these well-marked and constant 
varieties by a name wherewith to distinguish them from their respec- 
tive types, and I think it important that these variations should be 
better understood by British collectors.
There is another variety of 
* For much valuable assistance in the preparation of this paper I am indebted to 
Mr. J.
E. Robson, of Hartlepool, who is preparing a catalogue of all persistent 
varieties found in Europe.
Either Mr, Eobson or myself would be glad of any 
information touching the occurrence and distribution of these varieties in Britain ; 
also particulars of local forms, &c.
MosLEY : Persistent Variation among Butterflies.
183 
Pamphilus, a pale one, which has several times occurred in Yorkshire, 
and no doubt in other places also, which, so far as I am aware, is 
without a name, and we can only speak of it as " the pale form of 
Pamphilus." Numerous other instances occur in the British lepidop- 
tera, and if these had occurred in botany, and especially in conchology, 
they would immediately have had names given to them so that they 
could easily be referred to, — in fact, the conchologists could not get 
on very well without these names, so striking and numerous are the 
variations in shells : look, for instance, at the common Helix nemo- 
ralis.
It might be objected that this naming of mere varieties has a 
tendency to cause confusion, as I have heard it asserted in regard to 
botany ; but I fail to see how any confusion can possibly arise where 
the name of the variety occurs only in conjunction with that of the 
type.
I should therefore be careful not to give a name to any variety 
until it had been proved that it was a lecurrent variety, either local 
or otherwise.
Again, if nomenclators would pay more attention to 
giving characteristic and sensible names, instead of making so many 
" Haworthii^s and other fancy names, which to me convey no meaning, 
and give no scientific impression at all, the probabilities ol confusion 
would be much lessened.
I purpose, therefore, in the following paper 
to lay before you some of the constant or permanent varieties to which 
the British species of butterflies are subject, both here and on the 
continent of Europe, for no doubt many varieties which have hitherto 
been recorded only from the continent, would be of frequent occurrence 
here, if properly understood and looked for.
To the evolutionist these varieties may be of the utmost interest as 
pointing to races gone before, or as offering indications to him of the 
approach of new species.
Are there not some occasions when we can 
call to our memory instances where the type has given place to the 
variety, and the variety in turn has become the type ?
This change 
has, no doubt, operated in cases where we get local races of the same 
thing, such as Lycoena Agestis, &c.
To some persons every family of 
insects seems to be but as varieties of the grand whole ; every genus 
but as varieties of the same family ; and every species as varieties of 
each other.
In fact, there seems to be no limit to variation.
Look, 
for instance, at the extent to which Golias Edusa can vary — a species 
which everybody, previous to the great Edusa year, supposed to have 
been tolerably constant.
Insects of every species seem liable to vary 
more or less, and even in the same insect I have found that the two 
opposite sides often disagree in some particular.
Take an insect and

examine it for yourselves, — say one of Abraxas grossulariata or Che- 
Ionia caja, — and you will frequently find that the pattern on one pair 
of wings is not an exact rejoetition of that on the other pair.
Again, 
on the other hand, many which now rank as good and distinct species 
might, if their natural history was properly understood, be sunk as 
mere geographical or altitudinal varieties of the same thing.
For 
example, the genus Colzas, and our own Udusa, has produced almost 
unmistakable Chrysothome, Esp., and other specimens very nearly 
approaching Myrmidone, Esp., Erata, Esp., and even Aurorina, H.S.
But I must end my introduction, and enter upon the description of 
the several forms and varieties which it has been my good fortune to 
have had under notice during my entomological career.

— On the 13th inst., Mr. A.
Kell, of Barnsley, 
Mr. Richardson, of Goole, and myself were looking for nests and eggs on 
the borders of Goole Moors, when we saw a redshank settle on a low tree, 
evidently watching us, and ready to give warning to its mate.
As we 
approached we saw it leave the tree, fly round screaming, and again settle.
Can any of your correspondents say if it is usual for the redshank to

I Caterpillars IN THE olden time.
— It is frequently said that "what 
' is true is not new, and what is new is not true," but sometimes we meet 
with statements that are neither new nor true.
The following quaint 
quotation is from an old folio Puritan dictionary, the sixth edition of which 
was printed at London in 1678, and sold by Thomas Sawbridge at the 
Three flower-de-luces, in Little Britain : — " Caterpillar : an hurtful 
worm, eating the leaves, buds, flowers, fruits of trees, herbs, corn.
It 
maketh webs as spiders, wherein it wrappeth it self the whole winter, 
reserving its pestiferous seed ; for it casteth certain eggs from it, whence 
in the spring springeth a brood of many caterpillars.

It's

The caterpillars are said to eat

They are a

valuable information " of the nature and properties of beasts, fowls, 
fishes, trees, plants, fruits, seeds, stones, &c.," said to be " extracted out 
of the most approved authors," "especially Petri Ravanelli," ''first

signed by Rev. W.' Fowler, George Brook, ter., F.L.S., and W.
D. 
Roebuck, on behaK of the members of the Yorkshire Nat. Union, 
to the House of Commons, through Mr. John Barran, M.P., against the 
proposal to enclose Maltby Common, near Sheffield, which we trust will be 
successful in its object.
Messrs.

NOTICES OF BOOKS, &c.— " Especes des Hymenopteres 
d' Europe et d' Algeria, par Ed. Andre : tome premier, premier 
fascicule, 1st April, 1879 : chez I'auteur, Rue Poterne, 10, a Beaune 
(Cote d'Or)," — This work, if carried out in the style proposed in the 
prospectus, will prove a great acquisition to the literature of hymenoptera, 
and a great convenience to the student of that order.
M. Andre proposes 
to issue the book in quarterly parts, each part containing a fixed amount 
of letterpress and number of coloured plates.
The subscription per 
annum is eighteen francs for the Postal Union.
The first part is the 
introduction to the study of hymenoptera, giving first a sketch of 
the qualifications possessed by the ideal entomologist (an ideal we 
fear never yet realised), then notes on entomological nomenclature, 
a glance at classification, notes on the pursuit of hymenoptera in 
the field, and the methods of collection and preservation, their deter- 
mination, and the use of dichotomous tables (which will be largely 
used throughout the work).
The author then gives what will be of the 
.greatest use to students, a description of the anatomy and structure of 
hymenoptera, illustrated by well-executed plates of the parts alluded to^ 
The introduction will be continued in the second fascicle.
On its com- 
pletion the author's intention is to give a succession of monographs of 
the various families or gi-oups composing this great order.
The descrip- 
tions will be thrown into a series of dichotomous tables.
Full notes on 
ife-history and economy will form a leading feature in the design, and 
coloured plates will represent one species at least of every genus, care 
being taken to select species not before figured.
Geographical distribution 
will also receive its due share of attention.
The first family to be 
monographed is that of the sawflies, or Tenthrediindce ; then will probably

follow the fossores, wasps, and ants.
Every monograph is intended to be 
complete in itself, so that if the herculean labour of describing the whole 
of the European species compel the cessation of the design, the book will 
not present an unfinished appearance.
In conclusion, let us urge our 
entomologists to support this most laudable enterprise by becoming 
subscribers.
The price is moderate, and the work will at every stage of 
its progress be of incalculable value ; while the French language ought 
not to be a bar to its use, considering how small a modicum of that 
tongue will suffice for the comprehension of entomological literature.

The Second Excursion of the season was made on May 16th, to 
Cottingham and Beverley.
The party walked through pleasant fields 
past Cottingham chalk pits, Risby Park, Walkington, Westwood and 
Burton Bushes to Beverley.
At the chalk pits good sections of the upper 
or white chalk (with flints) were seen, capped in one of the pits with 
drift beds.
Some remarks explaining the character and geological 
history of the chalk were made by the president.
No fossils were found 
here, but at Mr. Fisher's whiting works near Beverley, where the chalk 
is quarried to a depth of nearly 150 feet, a collection of fossils found on 
the spot was examined ; they comprised but few forms, the principal 
being Belemniies moicronatus (the last of its race), Ananchytes ovatus, and 
several kinds of sponges, especially Ventriculites.
Westwood is not, as 
its name would lead one to suppose, a wood, but a wide open common 
left by an abbot of old to the freemen of Beverley.
At one corner of it, 
however, is a genuine bit of ancient forest —Burton Bushes — with vener- 
able oaks and tall holly bushes scattered about in picturesque disorder, 
and open green glades between them.
103 flowering plants, 21 mosses, 
and some lichens and fungi were observed.
Among the birds noted were 
the swift, swallow and martin, the chiff'-chaff, willow- wren, coot, waterhen 
and stock dove, as well as the more common species.

Mr. Washington Teasdale 
criticised the recent planting of plane and lime trees (which he regarded 
as very unsuitable to the atmosphere of Leeds) on Woodhouse Moor.
Mr. Francis Somers exhibited a collection of eel fare, gathered in one of 
the tidal rivers ; at this season they are passing up to the fresh water in 
thousands from the breeding grounds ; Mr. Jas.

excurrent nerve, in growing on rocks and not on trees.
The occurrence 
of a variety of Mastigohryiun deflexum, Nees.
, at Tjm-y-Groes, near 
Dolgelly, was reported by Mr. W.
H. Pearson, and a specimen gathered 
by him in company with Dr. Carrington on the 12th of April, was 
exhibited.
Another rare cryptogam exhibited by the president, was 
Zygodon Novcellii, so named by Professor Schiniper in honour of its 
discoverer the late J ohn jS'owell of Todmorden, but described formerly 
by Mr. Wilson under the name of Z.
gracilis ; the specimen was received 
from Mr. West, who gathered it at Ingleborough last Easter.
INIr. Rogers 
exhibited specimens of a number of Indian ferns which had been collected 
on the Himalayas, which were interesting on account of their identity with 
species indigenous to Britain ; amongst them were Cigstopteris fmgilis, 
Asplenium septentriunale, A.
fontanum and A.
AdAanturn-nigrum.
The 
president mentioned that he was mistaken in his siu-mise aboat the 
T. Barnhergeri mentioned at the last meeting.
Meeting, June 16th, Mr. Thos.
Brittain in the chair.
— The chairman 
exhibited two species of parasitic fungi, (Ecidium tragopogonis and 
Puccinea glomerata, from Southport — the first upon the leaves of Trago- 
pogon pratensis, and the latter infesting those of Senecio J acohoea.
Several 
mosses, also from Southport, were exhibited by Mr. Holt, including 
Meebia uliginosa, Bryurn calopliyllum, Hypnurn lycopodioides, H.
polyga- 
rnv/in, and H.
Wilsoni ; very fine specimens of Bryum turhinatum, from 
Clifton, were shown by Mr. J.

Wild brought some 
rare HepaticcE which he had gathered during the preceding week in Cum- 
berland.
One of these was Lejennia ovata, from Lodore, a species not 
previously known to grow in England.
The hon.
secretary (Mr. Rogers) 
informed the meeting that he had been with the president and a party of 
friends in West Yorkshire, but had returned in order to attend the 
present meeting.
They found some mosses still unripe and unfit to 
gather, on account of the severity of the past winter ; but others were in 
beautiful condition, and he had the pleasure of exhibiting Encalypta 
ciliato., Mntum serratum, Bartramia gracilis, Leskea rufescens, and one or

Yorkshire Naturalists' Union.
— The third meeting for 1879 was 
held at York on Whit-Monday, the 2nd of J une, for the exploration of 
Askham Bog, a well-known and most prolific piece of virgin ground, for 
which permission had been granted by Capt.
Severne.
Here most of the 
members remained throughout the day, to their extreme profit and 
delectation, and very little was seen of other parts of the environs of 
York.
The meetings were held in the Victoria Hall, Goodramgate, York.
In the absence of the president and all the vice-presidents but one, the 
chair was occupied by Mr. Councillor Bulmer, ex-sherifi" of York.
It was 
found that fourteen societies were represented, and the attendance of 
members was about 60 or 70.
The Dewsbury Naturalists' Society was 
admitted into union, on the motion of Mr. P.
F. Lee, of Dewsbury.
The 
secretary announced the names of Messrs.
W. Gregson of Thirsk, W.
Jenkinson of Sheffield, and W.
Whitwell of York, as new subscribers, 
and a vote of thanks was passed.
Mr. Hick, B.Sc (Harrogate) proposed 
a vote of thanks to the local secretary (Mr. W.
Brest) and the members 
of the York Society who assisted him ; and to Capt.
Severne for permis- 
sion to explore the Bog, which was passed.
Mr. C.
P. Hobkirk, F.L.S., 
was appointed to represent the Union on the Council of the British 
Association at the Sheffield meeting.
It was announced on behalf of the 
Council that they had, at the request of the SheflSeld Naturalists' Society, 
petitioned the House of Commons against the proposed enclosure of 
Maltby Common.
The reports of sections were then taken.
Mr. S.
D. 
Bairstow, secretary of the Entomological Section, reported that the 
district would probably be found one of the richest in the county, though 
from the very late spring, little had been done that day.
The best species 
taken was Orgyia gonostigma, of which a few larvae were beaten out of

birch in Askham bog.
Tephrosia biundularia was common at Sandburn, 
with various other species.
Enpithecia lariciata and Melanthia albicillata 
had been taken at Bishop's Wood, near Selby, by members who had 
called there on their way to the meeting.
Dr. Parsons, secretary of the 
Botanical Section, reported that the undulating clay and alluvial country 
in the neighbourhood of York had yielded little but the ordinary plants 
of cultivated lowland districts.
Askham Bog was a swampy thicket, 
occupying the surface of a peat bed which filled up a depression in the 
clay ; it was probably a relic of the conditions which formerly prevailed 
over a large part of the vale of York.
The flora of the Bog had in the 
main a peaty character, but the absence, so far as observed, of the heaths 
and the foxglove, and the presence of certain limestone-loving plants, 
indicated that the soil partook somewhat of a calcareous nature.
Owing 
to the backwardness of the season comparatively few species were found 
to what would have been the case later in the year, but some of those 
found were of considerable rarity.
179 Vasculares were seen, among 
the rarer being Ranunculus Lingua, Stellaria glauca, Carduus pra- 
tensis (a southern plant), Hottonia palustris, and Cladium Mariscus.
The special rarity at Askham Bog was, however, a sedge ; Carex para- 
doxa, which grew in tall tussocks plentifully all over the Bog, but found 
in only three out of the 11 2 counties of Great Britain.
Of ferns, N'ephro- 
dium Thelypteris and Osmunda regalis were abundant in the Bog, but in 
deference to the desire of Capt.
Severne no specimens were brought away.
In neighbouring ditches were found Chara syncarpa and Riccia natans, 
a curious little liverwort closely resembling a duckweed in its appearance 
and floating habit.
Twenty-seven mosses were found, among them being 
Tetraphis pellucida (in fruit), Cinclidotus fontinaloides (Naburn Lock), 
Climacium dendroides, and Hypnum cordifolium.
Among algse were 
Oscillatoria nigra, Euglena viridis, Chsetophora tuberosa, Coleochsete 
scutata, Batrachospermum moniliforme, Pandorina morum, Closterium 
moniliforme, and Mougeotia genuflexa.
But few hepaticse, lichens, or 
fungi were seen.
Mr. E.
Jones, of Embsay, near Skipton, who was the 
only geologist present, stated that the chief point of interest in that 
section was a splendid series of photographs of the sections of the boulder 
clays exposed in excavating for the York new goods station, exhibited on 
behalf of Mr. J.
E. Clark, B.A., B.Sc. There were no representatives of 
the Vertebrate Section present, and the only bird reported was the house 
martin, building near Chandler's Whin.
Mr. J.
D. Butterell of Hull 
reported for the Conchological Section, in the absence of its officers.
He 
stated that 12 land and 13 freshwater shells had been collected, including 
Planorbis lineatus and Valvata cristata.
The circular having stated that 
86 species have been recorded for the district, and given a list of shells 
which had not, Helix sericea was announced as an addition to the list,' 
having been collected so long ago as 1858.
This shows the value of so 
writing the circular as to show the deficiencies in the knowledge of the 
fauna and flora of the district to be worked out.

AT a Meeting of the VERTEBRATE SECTION of the YORKSHIRE 
NATURALISTS' UNION, held at Ingleton on the Uth of April, it 
was resolved to publish as the commencement of series B of the " Transactions ' ' 
of the Union a LIST OP THE BIRDS OF YORKSHIRE, to 
include all recorded occurrences of the rarer species as far as is practicable.
Its compilation was placed in my hands.
I now appeal to all our ornitholo- 
gists to give me their best assistance in the work by sending at once from all 
parts of the county LISTS, with remarks as to the distribution, abundance, 
breeding, and rare occurrences of the ACCIPITRES (Eagles, Hawks, and 
Owls) only, as the work will have to be done gradually.
When the list of 
this group is completed, it is contemplated to apply for information on the 
next succeeding group.
All assistance tvill be duly acknowledged.

the meetings, it would be better if they were furnished to us as notes 
or papers, and then only referred to in abstract in the reports.
Eeports of the meetings of Local Societies will always be gladly 
received and inserted.
It should be understood, however, that as our 
space is limited, discursive reports would occupy too much room.
Papers on ISTatural History subjects read at these meetings, if of 
sufficient general interest and value, and containing original matter, 
should be sent for insertion as " Original Articles," under which 
heading we shall also be glad to publish original papers not read at 
any meeting.
In conclusion, we again ask for that generous and cordial support' 
we have already received, in return for which our own labours in 
editing and issuing the Journal will be lightened, and made a 
pleasure.

AERIVAL OF SPRING MIGRANTS IN SOUTH 
WEST YORKSHIRE.
By Thos.
Lister.
The whole of our summer migrants known to South- West Yorkshire 
having arrived, I give a complete list for the present as compared 
with the past year, and the average for ten years, as I think it will 
be interesting to compare these dates.
There are some exceptionally 
early arrivals which may be considered accidental ones (where this is 
the case a second date is given), as many individual birds, and the 
main body of all the species, were later.
One thing was remaikable 
in the late comers — they did not sing or utter their usual call notes 
for many days after they had been seen.
They appeared starved, 
having found only scanty leafage to shelter them.
The cuckoo did 
not sing for ten days after it was seen, also the willow warbler and 
the chiffchaff.
The wood warbler was not heard nor seen again, after 
being first observed, for more than a month.
The fact of this season, 
on account of its severity, being the most remarkable which naturalists

PERSISTENT VARIATION AMONG THE BRITISH 
SPECIES OF BUTTERFLIES.
By S.
L. Mosley.
(Concluded.) 
First on our lists is Papilio Machaon — an insect so constant that 
we rarely see a variety except in size and density of colour.
In 
England it is large ; in Switzerland, small ; in America, deep rich 
orange colour.
In the south of Europe they have a form they call 
Sphyrus, Hb.
: the fore wings are darker, and the blue spots on the 
hind wings larger than in the type.
Leucophasia sinapis, the next insect, is subject to several deviations 
from the ordinary type.
The one called Lathyri, Hb., Mr. Gregson 
assures me is quite distinct.
The difference is on the underside of 
the hind wings, which are dark with two light dashes, these being 
placed in the opposite direction to that of the ordinary dark shading.
This variety is found only in the south of Europe.
Then there is the 
one without the ash-coloured tip, which was described by Newman 
and others as the female.
This, I believe, is the variety Erysimi, 
Bkh., and may occur only in the female, but the absence of the dark 
tip I do not believe to be the distinguishing sexual character.
The next form is Diniensis, Bdv., in which the under surface of the 
hind wings is without markings.
Mr. Doubleday says : " In the 
northern parts of Europe the individuals of the autumnal brood only 
differ from the vernal ones in being rather smaller, but in the southern 
parts of Europe they differ so much from the spring brood that they 
were formerly considered by many entomologists to be a distinct 
species.
The ground colour of the wings is pure white, and the male 
has a circular black spot at the apex of the anterior wings which does 
not extend to the margin ; the under surface of all the wings is pure 
white, but in some individuals there are a few faint marks.
This 
variety occurs in the New Forest and in Tilgate Forest." According 
to Staudinger, there is a fourth form of smapis called Amurensis, Mem.
I do not know it, however.
I think it is a Siberian variety.
The British species of the genus Pi^ris are subject to two seasonal 
variations — vernal and autumnal broods.
Stephens separated them 
as probably distinct.
Sahellicce was the spring brood of napi ; metra 
the spring brood of rapcB ; and Chariclea either the spring brood of 
hrassiccB (H.D.) or a modification of the male, having the inner edge 
of the black tip straight in the variety, and arched between the veins of 
MosLEY : Persistent Vakiation among Butterflies.
5 
the type (C.S.G.) Sabellica and metra differ from the later broods of 
the same insects in being smaller and having a greater preponderance 
of black.
But anyone may see the difference of these two common 
species by capturing a series of each brood for themselves.
Besides these, napi is subject on the Alps to a dark form of the 
female having the wing rays clothed with dark scales ; it is called 
bryoncd, Och., and I have seen British specimens nearly approaching 
to it ; but in all the British examples I have seen the dark spots on 
the upper wings show, whereas in the true alpine hryonce the dark 
spots are obliterated, at least in those specimens which I have seen.
The variety napcecB, Esp., is larger than the type, and has no green 
veins on the underside of the fore wings.
Since the introduction of 
rapce into America, a variety of a bright sulphur yellow has turned up 
there, and has been named aurea, and specimens having a decided 
yellow tint have sometimes occurred in this country.
Daplidice here 
is only single-brooded, so we only get one form, but on the Continent 
they have two seasonal varieties.
They have also a form to which 
they have given the name Bellidice, H.S.
(non Bramb.).
It may be 
distinguished by being smaller and very dark in the green on the 
underside.
Of the genus Anihocharis we have only one species, and that pretty 
constant, except with regard to size and the production of herm- 
aphrodite coloured specimens; some very curious ones are known to 
me, and are and will be figured in my book on varieties, one having the 
ground colour yellow, and thus approaching Eupheno, Esp., if, indeed, 
it be not a reversion to that insect (coll.
C. S.
Gregson).
Gonepteryx rhamni has the y Siriet j farinosa, Zett., which is without 
the orange spot on the fore wing, and has a mealy appearance.
Mr.
Gregson has specimens from North Lancashire with the orange spot 
all but imperceptible.
Then there is Gonepteryx Cleopatra, Linn., which some say is 
nothing more than a geographical form of rhamni, though generally 
looked upon as a good species.
It differs from rhamni in having 
orange on the fore wings diffused into a large patch in the male, 
covering a great portion of their surface.
It is found in Spain and 
the south of France.
M, Boisduval is stated (H.
& W.) to have 
reared G.
rhamni and G.
Cleopatra, from eggs deposited by a female 
of the former, and there was no difference in the larvae.
We now come to the two British species of Colias, and in the 
TTonderful Edusa year of 1877 we had ample opportunity of studying 
the variations of that species.
The greater number of the different 
6 
The Naturalist.
species of Colias with which I am acquainted are subject to a pale 
variety of the female, though in some cases — as, for instance, in 
Palceno, Linn.
— the pale form seems to have become the type, and 
the dark form the variety {Werdandi, H.S.).* The pale variety of 
Edusa called Helice is well known, and Hyale has also a pale form of 
the female which has as yet received no name.
It used to be supposed 
that all the light Hyale were females, and all the dark ones males, 
but I think this notion has been laid on one side by most entomo- 
logists.
I have seen specimens of Hyale, from Abyssinia, of a beautiful 
yellowish-orange tint, but whether they are all alike from the same 
place I cannot say.
The variety Sareptensis, Stgr., has the hind 
margin of the hinder wings broadly black, and occurs — as its name 
indicates — in South Russia.
In the different species of Argynnis there are many varieties, the 
best-known example with us being A.
Paphia, var.
Valezina, which is 
a very dark form of the female of that insect, and not rare in the 
New Forest.
A. Adippe, var.
Cleodoxa, and A.
Niobe, var.
Eris, are 
each void of silver spots.
Aglaia is subject to a variety called Char- 
lotta, "which are dark females" (C.S.G.), and frequently have nine- 
teen instead of twenty-one silvery spots on the underside of the hind 
wings, several at the base being confluent.
I think this is mentioned 
by Newman.
A. Adippe, var.
chloradippe, H.S., is tinged with green 
underneath the hind wings.
This, Mr. Gregson tells me, occurs at 
the Devil's Galop, North Lancashire.
Variety Cleodoxa, I believe, 
has been mistaken in Britain for Niohe, but Mr. Gregson showed me 
an unmistakable specimen of Niobe, var.
Eris, which he says he took 
at the Devil's Galop.
Of the MelitcBCB, Artemis has many named 
varieties.
Merope, Prun., is the alpine form ; it is smaller, more 
distinctly marked, and not so greasy-looking as the type.
It is found 
on the Alps, and also in Scotland.
f Hyhernica, Birchl., is the Irish 
form, more woolly than the type, and the light spots near the apex 
of the wing generally very distinct and often almost confluent — in 
fact, divided only by the wing rays.
Another variety — provincialis, Boisd.
— is found in Central Europe, 
" and at Lydgate, in Lancashire " (C.S. G.) I have had specimens 
* This is a variety of the female only, and therefore it is just the same as Edusa, 
only the pale female of Paloeno being more abundant than the yellow, the former 
is considered the proper form of the female.
Probably all the Colias have pale 
females ; I have one of Philodice from N.
America.
So with Hyale, the pale female 
being commoner is considered true.
— J.
E. R.
t I don't think the Scotch form is Merope.
Hyhernica approaches M.
cynthia.
I 
find Artemis varies in every different locality from those taken elsewhere.
I have 
some Hertfordshire specimens as large and very like provincialis.
— J.

from Hungary.
This is larger than the type, lighter, and the colours 
more blended — in fact, it is in all respects quite the opposite extreme 
to the var.
Merope.
In the Vanessidce there is a very marked form found in Corsica and 
Sardinia, which is generally said to be a variety of urticce^^ but which 
might prove distinct.
Mr. Frederick Bond, F.Z.S., tells me he 
thinks there is some difference in the larvae.
It is called Ichnusa^ 
Bon., and I think has as much claim to be considered distinct from 
uriiccB as Eospiton has to be considered distinct from Machaon.
The 
general tone of the insect is more orange, and it is without the two 
isolated dark spots on the upper wings usually found in urticcd.
There is an intermediate form between the two found in Turkey, 
called Turcica^ Htgr.
The var.
polaris, Stgr., is dark, and has the 
spots large and confluent.
V. lo var.
leides, Och,, differs from the 
type only in being much smaller, and may be reared artificially.
Of 
F. Antiopa there are two well-known forms — the white and the yellow- 
bordered ones — the latter being the type, and the former the var.
Hygicea, Hrdch., I believe.
Of Liminitis Sibylla there is a dark form which has occurred in the 
New Forest.
Sometimes the usual white band is entirely obliterated.
Arge Galathea is subject to several freaks, the most distinguishable 
being Icucomelas, Esp. The difference is on the under side of the 
hind wings, which are devoid of the usual dark markings.
I am not 
aware that it has been taken in England.
Next comes our Erehia Cassiope, which is but a variety of the type 
Epiphron, Kn. The latter has white pupils in the centre of the 
black dots, while those of the former are entirely black.
In Scotland 
the females have white pupils.
The range of the var.
Cassiope is more 
extensive in Europe than that of the type Epiphron.
Blandina has 
a variety of the female, which has the under side of the hind wings 
banded with ashy-grey or bluish, but it is not distinguished by any 
name from the type.
Of the genus Satyrus I know little.
Janira, var.
Mispulla^ Hub., 
is a modification of the female, with the apical yellow markings 
large and distinct, and the black eyes with two white dots.
Semele^ 
var.
tariscBUS, Bon., is a rich fulvous form of that insect.
Our 
S. j^geria is the var.
JEgerides of Staudinger, the type being found in 
southern Europe, and differing from ours in having the pale markings 
* I think this insect gets darker further north.
Ichnusa as a southern form has 
less dark markings — Polaris, which I do not know, has more than the type.

The Naturalist.
orange yellow instead of pale ochreons.
S. Hyperanihus var.
arete, 
MiilL, has white spots underneath in place of the regular eyes.
I 
have seen specimens of this variety in the late Alfred Owen's 
collection, which have every appearance of being British, though I was 
not before aware that it occurred even in Europe.
Both the species of Goenonym-pha are variable.
Pamphilus has a 
variety called lyllus, with a dark border all round the margin of the 
wings.
I have taken this variety at Sherwood Forest, and it occurs 
no doubt, wherever Pamphilus is common.
But there is a much more 
distinct variety, which I believe is unnamed, the ground colour of 
which is a dingy straw, much paler than the usual ochreous.
Davus 
is very variable.
The variety we usually call Rothliebii, Stgr., has 
the eyes very large and distinct, showing plainly on the upper side.
The variety Laidion, Bkh, has fewer spots, less visible on the upper 
side.
It is found in Scotland and Ireland.
The variety Isis, Thup., 
is the Lapland race ; they are small insects, and usually have no 
eye spots at all.
It is also found, I believe, in the north of Scotland.
Mr. J.
E. Robson, of Hartlepool, suggested to me that the eye spots of 
Davus disappear as we get further north, and I believe this is correct.
Polyommatus pJilceas has two named varieties : one is Schmidtii, 
Gerh., which is the one having the ground colour silvery instead of 
coppery.
Intermediate varieties occur having the ground straw- 
coloured.
Both these have been taken in many parts of England.
The other variety is Eleus, Fab.
; it is very dark in the coppery part, 
and the spots are not so distinct as in the type ; it is also somewhat 
shot with purple.
This variety is not uncommon on the Continent, 
and I believe I have taken it at Sherwood Forest, though I am not 
aware that it has been previously recorded as British.
A third 
variety (unnamed) is without the coppery band along the margin of 
the hind wings.
Of the " Blues " Lycana Agestis^ is the most noticeable for its amount 
of variation.
The general form of this insect in the south and 
midland counties of England is blackish brown, dotted around the 
border with orange red.
From the midland northward as far as 
Witherslack, the orange spots become less and less conspicuous, 
* I have always considered the three forms of this insect were best divided thus : 
Type : Upper side, black spot on centre of fore wing ; under side, white spot with 
black centres.
Salmaois : Upper side, black spot as in type ; under side, no black centre to spots.
Artaxerxes : Upper side, white spot in centre of fore wing ; under side, white 
spots as in Salmmis.—J.
E. R.
MosLEY : Persistent Variation among Butterflies.
9 
until at Castle Eden Dene, in Durham, tliey finally disappear in 
most specimens if not in all, and a white dot appears in the centre of 
the fore wings of the female.
This is the Salmacis of Stephens, who 
considered it a distinct species.
Then further north still — in Fife- 
shire — all the wings have a white dot in the centre, and this is still 
by some cimsidered a distinct species.
Mr. Buckler, however, could 
detect no difference in the larvae.
This form is called Artaxerxes, 
Fab. The second brood, in which the under side is brown, is called 
Estiva, Stgr., on the Continent.
L. Alexis, var.
Icarifius, Scriba, has 
no spots on the under side of the fore wings between the central spot 
and the base.
My friend Mr. Robson says that he believes this is a 
common variety in England ; he took two one afternoon, asleep on 
flowers, where the variation was plainly visible.
Of Adonis, the variety Ceronus, Esp., is the female, very much 
streaked with blue on the upper surface, and a series of orange 
lunules along the hind margin of the hind wings.
Cinous, Hub., has 
the spots below not eyed.
The variety Pollona, Zett., is the same as 
Ceronus, with the blue confined to the hind wings.
L. Corydon, var.
syngrapha, Kef., is a similar modification of that insect to Ceronus of 
Adonis, Neither, I believe, has yet been recorded from England, 
though I have seen insects very nearly approaching to both of them.
The variety Apennina, Zett., is a pale form from the Italian moun- 
tains ; Hispania, H.S., is something similar from Spain; albicans, 
H.S., is whiter still, while Corydonus, H.S., is violet-blue, and Cauca- 
sica, Stgr., sky-blue.
Argiolus, var.
hypoleuca, Koll., has no spots on 
the underside.
Alsus, var.
Lorquinii, H.S., has the male shot with 
blue.
Acis has several named varieties : Ballis, Frr., is large, with 
red spots underneath ; Parnassia, Stgr., is similar, but small ; Helena, 
Stgr., has a red marginal " fascia " on the underside ; and Antrochmna, 
Ld., has the same above on all the wings.
This latter is a modifica- 
tion of the female.
Avion sometimes occurs small and without spots.
I have seen this variety in several collections in the south of England.
I am not aware that any of the named varieties of Adonis, Corydon, or 
Acis have occurred in England.
We now come to the last family of British butterflies — ^the skippers 
— in which occur one or two beautiful variations.
One is the variety 
of alveolus, which is figured by Newman as Lavaterce, but this I believe 
is identical with the Taras of Meigen, and the latter name having the 
priority, Newman's must be sunk.
It is that with large confluent 
spots in the centre of the wings.
This variety has occurred in 
England.
The only other variety is the bone-coloured linea.
There 
10 
The Naturalist.
is, however, another species on the Continent which comes very near 
to linea, and may only be a variety of it ; it differs from linea in 
having the underside of the hind wings of one colour, and not having 
a fulvous inner margin as in our insect.
It is called lineola^ Och.
This concludes my list of the butterflies.
Many other interesting 
varieties occur with which I am not acquainted, and also in moths 
many remarkable forms and varieties might be found, and I hope 
that before long these will be worked out and catalogued in a proper 
form.
This is a little bit of unworked ground for the British 
entomologist to enter into.

Perching or the Pedsha]st£ {Totanus calidris).
— In last month's 
Naturalist (vol.
iv., p.
184) Mr. Bunker asks if it is usual for the red- 
shank to perch on a tree.
In reply I beg to state that it is no uncommon 
sight on the Continent to see this and others of the class Grallatores 
perched on trees.
It is, perhaps, the absence of trees in their usual 
haunts in this country that accounts for the non-observance of this 
habit.
Speaking of the curlew in Norway, Mr. Hewitson, in his " Eggs 
of British Birds," 3 ed., vol.
ii., p.
323, says : — We afterwards found 
it, however, to be a practice by no means uncommon with the redshank 
and the greenshank to settle upon trees ; and what surprised me more 
was to see the long-legged curlew alight, as it frequently did, on the top 
of the highest trees of the pine forest, and to hear it as it passed from 
tree to tree utter its loud clear whistle." This habit is quite charac- 
teristic of the closely allied species^ the spotted redshank, and has also 
often been recorded of the common sandpiper.
— Wm. Eagle Clauke, 
Leeds, July 3rd, 1879.
Buzzard v.
Kite, at Bingley.
— In the Naturalist for February, 
1878, Mr. Butterfield records the occurrence of the kite at Bingley, 
identifying the.
species on grounds that I consider to be extremely doubt- 
ful, even on Mr. B.'s own showing, for he says " I must confess, however, 
its light-coloured (in fact it seemed almost white) head somewhat puzzled 
me." Now, as he was so near that he could see the colour of the head, 
it is a pity that he did not pay a little attention to its tail, for by this 
alone the kite may be identified at once beyond the possibility of a doubt 
the tail 'in this species being very long and deeply forked, and very 
conspicuous.
The buzzard is subject to great variety — light-coloured.
Short Notes and Queries.
11 
even white, heads being by no means uncommon.
Then again, Mr. B.
says " its mode of flight is so distinctive I could not be mistaken," and 
he describes it as ^'effected in large sweeping circles." This applies 
equally well to the flight of the buzzard, which I have had the pleasure 
of watching on several occasions.
In the absence of more weighty 
evidence, which I trust may be forthcoming, the decision I feel bound 
to pronounce is a verdict for the plaintifi"." — Wu. Eagle Clarke, Leeds.
Cuckoo.
— Cuckoos have occurred in this neighbourhood in greater 
numbers than I ever observed before.
Three, five, and as many as 
seven have been seen together.
Besides their ordinary call they have a 
laughing note, and when fighting can hiss like geese or snakes.
Have 
they been more numerous than usual in other districts this year ?

Singular Conduct of a Cock.
— A common domestic hen, having a 
brood of twelve chickens, began to thrash them away, to provide for 
themselves, about two weeks ago.
A cock — a cross between a Cochin- 
china and silver pheasant — struck the mother, called the chickens to him, 
and ever since has performed the oflice of guardian both night and day.
I saw him this morning with nine brooding under his wings, and three 
sitting on his back.

Breeding op the Long-eared Owl at Ryther.
— While staying for a 
few days at Ryther, in the neighbourhood of Bishop's Wood, I was 
informed that the long-eared owl had bred there last spring.
The three 
young birds, which are known as the ''horned owls," were taken from a 
wood on the estate occupied by Mr. Atkinson.
They were found by his 
sons in the nest of a magpie during the month of May, and are now in the 
possession of Mr. Paver, of Leeds.

Gymnostomum commutatum in Wales.
— I beg to announce the dis- 
covery of Gymnostomum commutatum, Mitten, in a second locality in 
Wales.
A few weeks back I had occasion to examine specimens of the 
moss from near Wrexham, re-discovered, I may say, by Mr. Holmes 
during last year, and was surprised to find in comparing specimens in my 
herbarium marked " Gymnostomum curvirostrum — wet rocks near Tre- 
friw, 'N.
Wales, June, 1861, Dr. Wood," that they agreed with Mitten's 
description, having the leaf cells nearly all elongated and pellucid.

Plagiothecium Borrerianum, Spruce.
— On looking over some mosses 
gathered at Whitsuntide (May 21), 1877, in the neighbourhood of 
Wetherby, I find a very fine specimen of the above moss in fruit, in the 
character of which it agrees in every respect with Mr. Whitehead's 
specimens from Barmouth, except that the seta is somewhat longer.
The 
specimen was gathered in a wood near to Collingham, on the south bank 
of R.
Wharfe.— C.

from the southern counties, recently sent to me by Mr. E.

F.L.S., I iind a'packet of H.
imponens, gathered on Fritham Plain in the 
New Forest, Hants, and marked abundant, though without date.
As I 
am not aware of this locality having been previously recorded, I think it 
as well to publish it, and should also be glad to hear whether it has been 
found in any other British localities besides this, Reigate Heath, Stren- 
sail Common, and Skip with Common (vide Nat. iii, 142).

REVIEW.— Outline Descriptions of British Coleoptera : by the Rev.
T. Blackburn, B.
A. London : E.
W. Janson, 28, Museum Street, W.C." 
— We are glad to see this reprint of a paper which has extended over 
the pages of the Scottish Naturalist for several years, as it is now in 
a handy form for coleopterists, to whom, and particularly to those who 
purpose beginning the study of the coleoptera (and of such there ought to 
be a number in our Union), it will be invaluable.
The descriptions are 
in a brief and condensed form, but the abbreviations are clearly and 
thoroughly explained in the introduction, and a short time spent over 
these and the glossary will render the descriptions intelligible and easy 
to read.
Unfortunately, IVIr. Blackburn left our shores for Honolulu 
before completing the work, but he is now adding very extensively to our 
knowledge of the coleoptera of the Hawaiian Islands, and we must hope 
that ere long he will be able to find time and opportunity to finish his 
Outhnes " in the Scottish Naturalist.

Barnsley Naturalists' Society.
— Meeting July 8th, the president, 
Mr. T.
Lister, in the chair.
— The reports of the sectional meetings, 
prepared the evening before, were read, and specimens of the plants and 
insects were examined.
Attention was called to the many interesting 
species of birds which may be observed when suitable localities are 
examined, as was done in the excursion to Edlington Woods, Roche 
Abbey, and Sandbeck Park, which were most successful in this respect.

Lajstcashtre a^td Cheshire Entomological Society.
— Meeting 
June 30th, the president, IMr. S.
J. Capper, in the chair.
— A paper was 
read, contributed by Mr. F.
Buchanan White, M.D., F.L.S., on "The 
Mountain Lepidoptera Britain." Groups such as these, specifically or 
generically identical over a whole zone, and restricted to an altitude and 
temperature which renders them peculiarly isolated, prove one of the 
principal difficulties in the acceptance of the theory of evolution, and this 
paper was specially directed to explain the present distribution of these 
species, their probable birthplace, and the route by which they arrived at 
their present habitats.
Dr. White assumes on geological evidence that 
on the close of the last glacial epoch the bed of the German Ocean was 
elevated so as to form a land connection between England and the 
Continent sufficient for the immigration of such species from Central 
Europe, and that as the temperature became warmer, these forms were 
forced up isolated mountain ranges, partly in obedience to the require- 
ments of their physical structure, and partly as a result of the greater 
competition for existence at lower altitudes.
The usual conversazione 
terminated the meeting.

YoEKSHiE-E Naturalists' Union.
— The fourth meeting for 1879 was 
held at Hebden Bridge, and was devoted to an examination of the 
Hebden and Crimsworth vaUeys.
The weather was thoroughly unpro- 
pitious, thus for once falsifying the luck by which the Union is nearly 
invariably favoured by fine weather.
The meetings were held at the 
White Horse Hotel, Hebden Bridge.
There was a very large number of 
members, comprising over 100 representatives from 17 societies.
The 
chair was occupied by the Rev. W.
Fowler, M.A., Liversedge, vice- 
president.
The list of new subscribers, to whom thanks were voted, 
included Messrs.
J. H.
Rowntree and F.
Bainbridge of Scarborough, 
James Backhouse of York, Dr. W.
Alexander, J.
P., of Halifax, and Rev.
W. C.
Hey of Guisborough.
On the motion of Dr. Alexander, thanks 
16 
The Naturalist.
were voted to the local secretary, Mr. C.
P. Hobkirk, F.L.S., of Hud- 
dersfield ; also to Mr. Lipscombe for permission to ramble through the 
woods.
Messrs.
Thomas Lister of Barnsley, and George Brook, ter., 
F.L.S., of Huddersfield, were chosen to represent the Union, along with 
Mr. Hobkirk, at the British Association Meeting at Sheffield.
Before 
taking the reports of Sections the chairman, in a few appropriate and 
well-chosen words, referred to the loss which the Union had sustained by 
the removal from Yorkshire of Dr. Parsons, who had accepted a position 
under the Local Government Board in London.
On considering in what 
manner the great services he has rendered to the Union should be 
recognised, the suggestions offered were allowed to stand over for further 
consideration.
The reports of Sections were then taken.
Mr. William 
West, Bradford, secretary of the Botanical Section, reported that a fair 
number of plants had been seen, considering that the botanists had to 
alternately shelter and botanise under cover )f an umbrella.
189 vascular 
plants had been observed, the rarest of which were Lathrsea squamaria, 
Paris quadrif olia, (Enanthe crocata, and Iris Pseud-acorus, from Ludden- 
den Dene ; Scutellaria minor from Midgeley Moor ; Melica nutans, 
Crepis paludosa, Corydalis claviculata, Pubus suberectus, Jasione 
montana, Carex remota, C.
pilulifera, Vaccinium Oxycoccos, Polypodium 
Dryopteris, and P.
Phegopteris, from the Hebden valley.
About fifty 
mosses were observed, including Neckera crispa, Fontinalis squmaosa, 
Atrichum crispum, Dicranella squarrosa, Dicranum fuscescens, D.
majus, Bartramia pomiformis, Leptobryum pyriforme, and Hyocomium 
flagellare.
Eleven species of lichens were observed, including Sphsero- 
phoron coralloides, Cetraria aculeata, and Peltigera canina (fr.) ; and ten 
hepaticae, including Jimgermannia barbata.
Six species of fuDgi were all 
that were noticed, including Uredo Potentillarum on Alchemilla vulgaris.
Prof.
A. H.
Green, M.A., F.G.S., president of the Geological Section, 
was present during the day, but was compelled to leave before the 
meeting.
Mr. Spencer, the secretary, read the report.
Want of time 
prevented the giving of further reports, which however would otherwise 
have been given as follows : — by Mr. W.
E. Clarke, Leeds, secretary of 
the Vertebrate Section ; and by Mr. S.
D. Bairstow, secretary of the 
Entomological Section^ including the following beetles reported by Mr.
E. B.
Wrigglesworth, of Wakefield : — Telephorus abdominalis, Timarcha 
coriaria, Otiorhynchus picipes, O.
atro-apterus, Phyllobius alneti, P.
viridicollis, and Barynotus moereus.
— W.
D. P.
[N.
B. — We much regret that, owing to the late date in the month when 
this meeting was held, and consequently the late period at which some 
of the reports of the Sections reached us, we have been compelled to 
either curtail or altogether omit them.
Some of the local Societies' 
reports, on account of late arrival, we have also been obliged to treat 
in the same manner.

LIST OF MOSSES OCCUREING NEAR WETHERBY, 
IN THE VICE-COUNTY OF MID-WEST TOKK, 
OBSERVED BY J.
S. ^YESLEY, M.B., Lond.
The following list includes no species but what occur within four 
miles from Wetherby.
The country about Wetherby is gently 
undulated, well wooded, and has the two rivers Nidd and Wharfe 
running through it.
The underlying rocks are mainly magnesian 
limestone and the sandstone known as Plumpton grit.
Fine perpen- 
dicular cliffs of limestone margin the Wharfe on its south side below 
Wetherby.
The disused quarries north and west of Wetherby have 
hitherto produced the greatest number of good species.
The chief value of this list, in the opinion of Mr. Lees, will 
probably be found to depend not so much on the great rarity of any 
of the species given, nor upon any great interest attaching to the 
several localities, as upon the fact that the records are unusually 
reliable — nearly, if not all, having been verified by such competent 
authorities as Messrs.
Boswell, Braithwaite, and Fergusson, through 
specimens submitted to them for verification.
Further, after four seasons' careful examination of a district 
thoroughly familiar to me, the list may be regarded as almost com- 
plete for the limited area of which it treats, with the exception that 
some of the smaller mosses probably growing here have not yet been 
detected.
I may add that the claim to inclusion in the W.
R. flora of the 
following species, viz., Pottia intermedia^ Turn.
; Bidymodon cylindri- 
cuSf Bruch.
; Fissidens viridulus, Wils.
Thiddium ahietinum, L.
; and 
Hypunm Sendtneri, Schpr., rests solely on Wetherby district localities.

A COLLECTING TOUE IN NOETH YOEKSHIEE.
By H.
Pollard.
Early in the present summer we set out on a Natural History 
collecting tour in the north of Y'orkshire.
As a conyenient starting- 
point Whitby was chosen, with the intention of extending the work 
which has already been done there.
On the morning after our arrival we began early in excellent spirits 
our work of collecting, which we continued vigorously and success- 
fully the whole of the time we remained in this locality.
As it is of 
but little use to enumerate the whole of the shells and beetles we 
took here, many of them being mentioned by Mr. Crowther in his 
article on Whitby," we will only give those which are additional.
In land and fresh-water shells we collected Biilimus ohsciiriis and its 
variety alha ; this last is very rare, and occurred but sparingly.
In a 
ditch near Larpool fine elongated specimens of Limncea truncatula 
were taken.
Another shell worthy of notice from its peculiar shape, 
was Limncea peregra^ taken near the small but picturesque village of 
Euswarp.
Helix nemoralis var.
liortemis appeared in profuse numbers, 
and with it were found several splendid specimens of the variety 
liyhrida.
In marine conchology we took, on the scar at Saltwick and at a 
distance of about two hundred yards from the shore, specimens of 
T'aves pullastra ; they were veiy dwarfed in size, and attached to the 
rocks.
Other beautiful shells fonnd here were Tedura testudinaiis and 
Trochus helicimis.
Eespecting the former, in the article already cited 
mention has been made of its probable occurrence at Eobin Hood's 
20 
The Naturalist, 
Bay ; as the place where we gathered it is about a mile and a quarter 
south of the author's hunting ground, we are led to believe his surmise 
may be true.
In coleoptera we took at Whitby LiojpJilaus ni(iihis, Fab., Amara 
communis, Panz., Harjjalus ruhripes, Dufts, OtiorJiynchis picipes, Fab,, 
DiacantJius Jiolosericeus, Fab., NotiopJiilus higuttatus, Fab., ApJiodius 
Jimetarins, L,, Sitoiies lineatus, L., S.
regendeineims, Hbst., Olihrus 
(Bnus, Fab., Bemhidium laterale, Oliv., TelepJioriis lividus, L., Clivina

argentatus, Fab., Liosumus ovatiilus, Clairv., Silpha atrata, L., Phyllo- 
hins Pomona, Oliv., and Aphodius testudinarius.
At tStakesby, Pliyllohius alneii, Fab., F.
pyri, L., and Liosumus 
ovoiulus, CI., were taken.
At Bluebank, near Sleights : Agahus fontinalis, Steph., Prasocuris 
oMcta, Fab., and one freshwater shell, LimncBa peregra.
At Sleights : CJwysomela polita^ L , C.
stapJiylcea, L., PyrocJiroa 
miens, Fab,, OtiorJiyncJius picipes, Fab., 0.
scabrosus, Anchomenus albipes.
Fab., TelepJionis testaceus, Corymbites Jiolosericeus, Fab,, and Agriotes 
sputato?\ Fab.
At Aislaby : TacJiinus riifipes.
Fab,, Stenus canaliculatus, Grylh, 
PJiilonthus laminatus, Creutz,, Latlirobinm fidvipemie, Gr., Xantliotii'ius 
pmictulatus, Payk., Philontlius varivs, Gyll., Stomis pumicatus, Panz., 
Loricera pilicornis.
Fab., and in molluscs Zonites alliarius.
At Euswarp : Silpha Icevigata, Fab.
At Egton Bridge : Zonites cellarius^ Z.
nitiduluSy and one beetle, 
Clivina fos-wr.
At Lealholme, Limnaa truncatula.
At Danby : NotiopJdlus palustris, Duft., Anchomenus albipes, Fab., 
Liosumus ovatulus, CI., and Leistus ferrugineus, L.
At Castleton : Byrrhus murinus, Fab., Clivina fossor, Phyllohius 
alneti, Fab,, Bembidium laterale, Othius pilicornis, Anchomenus albipes, 
Fab., and Phyllobius argentatus, L.
AVe next proceeded to Southbank, near Middlesborough, where we 
stayed better than a week.
As a rule, in collecting here we were 
very unsuccessful, the geology of the district being quite against us.
We, however, obtained the following shells : — Planorbis albus, P.
vortex, L.
peregra, Z.
nilidulus, Cochlicopa lubrica, and Pupa umbilicata.
Amongst the Limncea peregra, specimens taken in the reservoir of 
Messrs.
Bolckow Vaughan and Co., ironworks are worthy of special 
notice, on account of their very elegant form.
In colour they are 
black.
Pollard: A Collecting Tour in North Yorkshire.
21 
Searching at Normanby (about two-and-a-half miles from South- 
bank), we took L.
peregra in a ditch which ran through the middle of 
a meadow.
They were thickly coated with a confervoid growth.
In coleoptera we collected G-yrinm bicolor, Payk., Laccophilus 
ayalinus, D., Byrrhus pilula^ L., and Agriotis ^pidator.
By a run over to the fast-rising watering-place of Saltburn we 
were well rewarded.
We took the common heart sea urchin in large 
quantities.
On the ebbing of the tide, the beach, to use an hyper- 
bolic phrase, was covered with them.
In mollusca we obtained the following : — Madia dultorum, Bonax 
politum, Telina temm, T.
fabttla, Trochm cinereus, Littorhia obtusata, L.
IMorea, Solen sili(iua, Helcion pellucida and its variety IcBvis, Cardium 
edule, and Patella vulgata.
In a stream of brackish water, at a few yards above high-water 
mark, we collected very large specimens of L.
peregra, covered with a 
confervoid growth.
The only land-shell taken was CocJilicopa liibrica^ 
under old wood near the coast.
On resuming our tour south to Mash am, a break in our journey at 
Melmerby for almost an hour enabled us to gather Helix caniiana and 
H. nemoralis var.
Tiortemis.
Arrived at Masham, we at once began our 
work.
In a pond situated about half-a-mile from the town we took 
some of the finest specimens of Limrusa stagnalis and L.
paliistris it 
has ever been our pleasure to view ; in numbers they outstripped any 
locality we have collected in.
At one dip of the net more than once 
eight or nine were brought up.
Also from the same pond, but in 
less quantities, were taken Plaiiorbis corueus, P.
carinatm^ BytJiinia 
tentaculata, and L.
peregra.
In the river Burn, a tributary of the Ure, Ancylus Jliwiatihis was 
found very commonly adhering to stones.
Examining a ditch a few 
yards from the river, we discovered Succinea putris and its variety 
sulidula, S.
elegans, and Limncea truncatula^ the last-mentioned being 
very long.
L. peregra was also taken here and in three or four other 
ditches round Masham, but varied very much in shape and appear- 
ance in each.
In one the specimens had reflected lips.
Clausilia 
riigosa was taken very profusely among moss on old and decaying 
walls.
Amongst the crevices of one, nothing but the variety dubia 
was found.
G. rugosa var.
timidula was also present in several places.
The most commonly occurring shell in this district is without doubt 
Helix nemoralis, var.
Jiortensis varying as much as plain yellow, flesh 
colour and dark bands, often five in number could make them.
The 
varieties hybi'ida and minor of B^.
?iemoraUs were also abundant.
With 
22 
The Naturalist.
one exception all the former obtained, numbering about thirty, were 
flesh-coloured.
Though both the above varieties of H.
nemoralis were so common, 
yet the type shell was not observed.
The circumstance of H.
nemo- 
ralis being absent, and the variety hybrida occurring, strengthens our 
opinion as to what we consider the latter to be, viz., simply a variety 
of Jiortensis.
We were surprised, on reaching home, to learn from the Doncaster 
circular of the Union meeting that variations in form and colour of 
Helix nemoralis were quite overlooked by local collectors — a speciality 
of this ever-varying shell being made, to our certain knowledge, by 
many Yorkshire conchologists.
Other shells taken in and around Masham were — Pupa umbilicata, 
C. luhrica, H.
hispida, H.
Jiispida var.
albida, Helix rnfescens, Z.
cellarius, 
Z. alliarius, Z.
cellarius, var, alba, Z.
nitidulus, and Helix rotundata.
In coleoptera we took C.
polita, Hyhrvis tiliginosiis, L., Tel. lividus, 
Pi/roc/iroa rubens, Fab., Stomis p?mticatus, Panz., Ancliomenus albipes, 
Fab., Leistiis ferrugineus, L., and L.
rufescem.
Fab.
At Ellington, about two-and-a-half miles from Masham, Helix 
lapicida^ C.
riigosa, C.
hibrica, P.
umbilicata, and Helix liortensis were 
taken ; and at Ellingstring, about five miles distant, Sphcerium 
lacustre.
From Masham we made our way home, after having spent a very 
pleasant and profitable holiday, fully satisfied that we had done 
something at least towards the extension of the Natural History of 
our county.
We find that Clivina fossor is pretty well distributed, 
and that many of the coleoptera common in the Leeds district occur 
equally plentifully in the tract of country we have traversed.
In 
conchology we claim to be the first recorders of Bulimus obscurus var.
alba in Yorkshire.

Exorista hortulana, Mgn.
— In the July number of the Naturalist I 
described a male of this fly which was bred by Mr. Porritt from a larva 
of Acronycta alni.
Having lately had the pleasure of receiving from Mr.
Mosley a second specimen of this insect (bred from the same larva), which 
fortunately was a female, I am now enabled to complete the description of 
the species.
I am especially glad to do this, as the female was unknown

to Meigen, and differs so considerably from the male, that it might easily 
be described as a distinct species, and even be placed in a different genus.
The chief points of distinction between the sexes are these : — 1st.
The eyes 
in the female are only very slightly pubescent, while they are decidedly 
hairy in the male.
2nd.
The palpi in female are of a dark piceous colour 
at their extremities, while they are yellow in the male.
Besides these two 
special points of difference, the apex and free edge of the scutellum have 
a yellowish-red tinge in the female, which can be scarcely seen in the 
male, except in a very strong light.
The frontal space (as is usual in 
these flies) is wider in the female than in the male, occupying in the 
former about one-third of the width of the head.
In all other points 
of colour and structure the two sexes resemble each other.
In conclusion, 
I beg to return my thanks to Mr. Mosley, as well as to Mr. Porritt, for 
placing these specimens at my disposal.

Occurrence of Boletohia fidiglnarm.
— One of our men has just 
brought me a female Boletohia fuliginaria, which he caught on the 
wharf.
In getting it into a box he unfortunately damaged the right side 
upper wing, but in other respects it is perfect, A male specimen was 
taken on the same premises about twenty years ago, and is still in the 
captor's cabinet.

Unusual Nesting-place of Wheatear.
— During an ornithological 
ramble to Adel last spring, I obtained eggs of a wheatear from a hole in 
a bank which overhangs one of our beautiful streams.
The hole was once 
the nesting-place of the sand martin.
The nest was placed at the far end 
of the hole, which was about 3ft.
in length.
I only know of another 
similar instance on record, and that is given by the Hev. F.
0. Morris in 
his work on the nests and eggs of British birds.
I also procured eggs of 
the dipper, from a boy who had found them near the same stream a few 
days previously.
He discovered the old bird on the nest, and took bird, 
nest, and the five eggs.
He kept the bird in a cage for some time, but 
being unable to procure food for it, he was persuaded to let it go ; and 
not knowing the value of the nest, he destroyed it.
The dipper's nest 
and eggs are seldom found in this neighbourhood.

Leeds, Aug. 18th.
The Cuckoo.; — In last month's Naturalist (vol.
v., p.
11,) Mr. Hanson 
states that ^' during the present year cuckoos have occurred in greater 
numbers than he has ever observed before," and asks if the same has been 
noticed in other districts.
My brother and I have observed the same in 
this district, and consider it a rare and unusual occurrence.
I have 
several times seen two, three, and once saw four together, but have 
never seen so many as seven.
The cuckoo does not pair, and it is 
unusual to see even male and female together.
If two males meet in the 
course of their wanderings, they frequently fight with intense animosity.
I once heard a cuckoo sing while flying, and noted it down as a very 
unusual occurrence.
I found several eggs of the cuckoo last spring, and 
24 
The Naturalist.
judging from the situation of the nest, I should say it was impossible for 
the cuckoo to have laid her egg in the nest ; she, therefore, must have 
laid it on the ground and then carried it to the nest in her bill.
I have 
found both the eggs and young of this bird in pipits' nests, within a few 
yards of each other.
I find that incubation lasts about fourteen days, 
and the young bird is able to fly within a month.
I also noticed the 
nestling had a low plaintive chirp.
It was very interesting to watch the 
foster-parents feed the young monster.
I have a fine series of the 
cuckoo's eggs in my collection, and find they difier considerably both in 
ground colour and markings.
One which I took from a meadow pipit's 
nest is similar to the skylark's, while another taken from a hedge 
sparrow's is similar to the dark variety of the pied wagtail.

THE BRITISH ASSOCIATION AT SHEFFIELD.
The 49th annual meeting was opened on the 20th August, under the 
presidency of Dr. AUman, F.R.S., &c.
Amongst the distinguished 
savans present were the ex-president, William Spottiswoode, Sir John 
Lubbock, Prof.
Huxley, Prof.
WiUiamson (Owen's Coll.), Prof.
P. M.
Duncan, Dr. Evans, Comm.
Cameron, R.N., Prof.
Newton, of Yale 
CoUege, Conn., Clements P.
Markham, Major Serpa Pinto, Dr. H.
C. 
Sorby, &c., &c.
The President's Address was devoted chiefly to a discussion of the lower 
forms of life, commencing with a history and definition of the terms 
sarcode and protoplasm, passing from Huxley's Batliyhius upwards through 
the Protamceba (Monera), the Amceba, the condition of the egg, the 
spectroscopic relations of chlorophyll, &c.
" When, however, we say 
that life is a property of protoplasm, we assert as much as we are justified 
in doing.
Here we stand upon the boundary between life in its proper 
conception, as a group of phenomena having irritability as their common 
bond, and that other and higher group of phenomena we designate as 
consciousness or thought, and which, however intimately connected with 
those of life, are yet essentially distinct from them." The concluding 
paragraph is well worthy of quotation : - ' ' We are not, however, on that

account, forced to the conclusion that there is nothing in the universe but 
matter and force.
The simplest physical law is absolutely inconceivable 
by the highest of brutes, and no one would be justified in assuming that 
man had already attained the limits of his powers mind, as well 
as body, is thus travelling onwards through higher and still higher phases.
The great law of Evolution is shaping the destiny of our race ; and 
though now we may at most but indicate some weak point in the general- 
ization which would refer consciousness, as well as life, to a common 
material source, who can say that in the far-off future there may not yet 
be evolved other and higher faculties from which light may stream in upon 
the darkness, and reveal to man the great mystery of Thought 
Barnsley Naturalists' Society.
— Meeting Aug. 5th, the president, 
Mr. T.
Lister in the chair.
— Many of the rare plants collected during the 
Yorkshire Naturalists' excursion to Doncaster the previous day were on 
the table.
The absence of song birds about Barnsley up to the first week 
of July was noted ; most of the warblers, however, have since been 
heard, including the nightingale, the garden warbler, blackcap, grass- 
hopper warbler, sedge warbler, &c., not only in the extended excursions, 
but in the richly wooded districts about Barnsley.
All four of the 
swallow tribe have been numerous, though the swift had been scarcely 
noted near the town.
Starlings, grey and green linnets, and lesser 
redpoles, have been seen in mmierous flocks since the breeding time, 
though rarely noted before.
Blackbirds, thrushes, and skylarks are yet 
scarce, consequently gardeners and agriculturalists have found a difference 
in the over-abundance of worms, grubs, snails and other vermin.
The 
wood warbler was heard to the middle of July.
The willow warbler 
resumed its pleasing strain at the present date (Aug. 6th).
Mr. C.
Wemyss, of Cannon Hall, reported on Jul}^ 23rd the great snipe near 
the cascade there, also cuckoos and sandpipers on the moors, where 
several flights of gulls were observed.
He has since observed the goat 
sucker (rare this year), and a great snipe was shot on the moors on the 
12th August.
Lapwings have appeared in large flocks in the Dearne 
valley, on the grounds so frequently flooded.

— These woods are four miles from Appleby station, down the old 
Roman road called Ermine-street, and lie on the eastern slope of the ridge 
of oolite which forms the second of the three ranges of the Lincolnshire 
hills.
A quarry of cornbrash containing Rhynchonella spinosa, and other 
characteristic fossils, was examined near Appleby station ; and in the 
quarry of inferior oolite named Read's Quarry, near Broughton, many 
good fossils were found.
The flora of the neighbourhood is chiefly 
composed of dry limestone species, but some notable exceptions were met 
with during the day in the occurrence of one or two somewhat rare 
northern and southern species.
The lateness of the season made the list 
of flowering plants less than might have been expected, but 170 species 
were seen, the most noteworthy being Viola Jiirta, Silene nocUflora, 
Astragalus hypoglottis, Anemone Pulsatilla, Hippocrepis comosa, Spircea 
filipendula, Inula Conyza, Lactuca muralis, Campanula Trachelium, 
Echium vulgare, Ruhus saxatilis, Ophrys muscifera.
These woods are 
especially famous for the abundance of the lily of the valley {Convallaria 
majalis), which covers the ground for many acres, and generally blooms 
freely.
Twenty-three mosses were seen, also some lichens and fungi.
Moths and butterflies were abundant, but collectors were absent, and few 
captures were made.
The nightingale was heard during the walk down 
Ermine-street, and 30 other birds were noted by Mr. A.
Kell of Barnsley, 
and the Society's recorders, among them being the blackheaded gull (at 
Frodingham Warren), sand martin, wood warbler, blackcap warbler, 
gold-crested wren (nest and seven eggs), yellow-hammer, chaflnnch, marsh 
tit, jay, whinchat, ringdove, &c.

— Ordinary meeting, July 14th, 
Mr. John Whitehead, the president, in the chair.
— The president exhibited 
various interesting mosses gathered by himself and a party of friends in 
littondale, West Biding of Yorkshire, during Whit-week.
Foremost 
amongst these was Zygodon Nov:ellii — a very rare moss in any state, but 
particularly so with fruit.
Several capsules were found.
The moss was 
first discovered in 1856 by the late J ohn IS'owell, and its place in the 
muscal family was for some years the subject of much controversy.
Wilson gave it the name of Zygodon gracilis.
Schmiper, on the other 
hand, considered it to be a species of Didymodoii.
In 1866 the point was 
settled by the discovery of fruit by Nowell himseM, and Schimper 
bestowed upon the plant the name of Z.
Nov:ellii (in honour of the Lan- 
cashire muscologist), which is now generally adopted.
The president said 
Reports of Societies.
29 
that another rare moss — Mnium orthorrhynchum — was found in Litton- 
dale, with male flowers only, though Nowell was credited with the dis- 
covery of fruiting specimens.
Mnium serratura was plentiful and in fine 
condition ; also the rare Seligeria tristicha, but mostly barren ; excellent 
specimens of Orthotrichum rivulare ; and a curious variety {irdifera) of 
Encalypta vulgaris were the most important things gathered during the 
excursion.
The president further announced the receipt of Tortula 
Hihernica Mitt.
— a rare moss, whose only habitat is Cromagloun, near 
Killarney.
Trichostomum glaucescens, from Clova ; Mnium stellare (with 
male inflorescence) and Tortula vinealis, in fruit, from Derbyshire ; Ehyn- 
chostegium depressum (fr.), from near Bolton ; and Hypnum chrysophyl- 
lum, from near Ashton-under-Lyne, were also exhibited by the president.
Mr. W.
H. Pearson (vice-jDresident), who was unable to be presern;, for- 
warded a specimen of drawings of a rare species of hepaticEe collected on 
the 28th April by himself and Mr. Wild in the jjass of Llanberis.
The 
species, Mr. Pearson wrote, had been collected previously in Scotland by 
Messrs.
Black, Croall, Hunt, and Sim. He intimated that it would be 
given in the second fasciculus of the Hepaticse Britannicee Exsiccatse " 
(along with the variety laxior), which is to be issued this month.
The 
other specimens exhibited at the meeting comprised Bryum Marrattii, 
by Mr. Holt (found in considerable abundance this year at Southport) ; 
Leskea suhrufa, from Miller's Dale, by Mr. Wild ; also Catoscopium nigri- 
tum and Cynodontium Bruntoni, by Mr. Cash — the former from South- 
port and the latter from near Matlock.
The Catoscopium, with very 
young setae, was found on the 14th June growing in moist ground among 
the sandhills at Birkdale.
A single tuft was removed, and the capsules 
developed beautifully in cultivation.
Meetij^g, Aug. 11th, the president in the chair.
— A number of inter- 
esting cryptogamic plants were placed on the table for inspection.
Mr. T.
Brittain gave an account of Verrucaria nitida, a lichen which is found 
on the bark of trees, especially on that of the ash.
Its habits and 
stmcture were described, the latter being shown by means of the micro- 
scope.
The mosses exhibited by the president were Hedivigia striata, 
Wils, from Grasmere, which he, along with Mr. Fergusson, proposed to 
restore again to the rank of a distinct species ; Scleropodium ccespitosum 
from Miller's Dale ; and Rhabdoweissia fugax and R.
denticidata from 
Cader Idris ; also Gymnostomum commutatum, Mitt., gathered by Dr.
Wood on moist rocks at Trefriw, N.
Wales, June, 1861.
Mr. Holt 
showed Amblystegium irrignnm from Mellor, in fruit.
A few lichens and 
mosses from Connemara were shown by Mr. Hyde.

W. H.
Pearson 
exhibited Cephalozia Schlmezeri from Barton Moss — a new locality for this 
plant, — and promised to read a paper upon it at the next meeting.
YoKKSHiRE Naturalists' Union, — Hebden Bridge, July 19th, 1879.
Report of the Geological Section.
— In the absence of Prof.
Green, the 
president of the Section, Dr. W.
Alexander, J.
P., of Halifax, was elected

The Naturalist.
chairman.
Pieces of limestone containing fossils, obtained during th& 
day, were handed round for the inspection of the members, as were also 
a large number of slides of the material, full of the beautiful minute 
fossils which abound therein.
These had been mounted for the occasion 
by the secretary, from material obtained on a former visit.
A number of 
coloured sections of the strata of the district, also prepared by the secre- 
tary, were hung on the walls.
The chairman stated that he had written 
and published a paper on the geology of the district 40 years ago, which 
contained a list of fossils drawn up by the late Mr. Samuel Gibson, of 
Hebden Bridge.
Many of the names were crude and rather fanciful, and 
the sketch of the strata which he had drawn up was by no means to be 
compared with the elaborate sections drawn by Mr. Spencer, but still he 
hoped they would afford some little interest as memorials of Mr. Gibson, 
and in showing what had been done in former times.
Mr. B.
Holgate, 
F.G.S., said that he had been much pleased with his visit, and would 
have been more so but for the rain.
He had formed one of a party of 
four, including Prof.
Green, Mr. Spencer, and Mr. Ashworth, who had 
gone up the valley to the place where the limestone band cropped out.
They had obtained plenty of the material, but the bad weather had 
prevented them from breaking it up to extract the fossils.
The secretary 
had, however, brought a heavy load, and when he had worked up the 
material, the list of fossils obtained would be recorded in the minutes of 
the Section.
Mr. Tindall, of Huddersfield, offered a few remarks, after 
which the secretary gave a sketch of the geology of the district.
He said 
so far as he had been able to make out, the harvest of fossils obtained 
that day would be a good one, and .the list would most undoubtedly have 
been a very large one had the day been fine.
As it was, he had noticed 
the following species : — Goniatites Gibsoni (a most beautiful little fossil 
very like an ammonite), G.
reticulata, G.
Loonyi, G.
striatus, G.
spiror- 
bis, Orthoceras, Nautilus, Posidonomya, Modiolopsis and Aviculo-pectens.
Perhaps a few words on the physical geology of the district would not be 
out of place.
We are now in the valley of the Calder, which from Hebden 
Bridge to Todmorden has been scooped out of the Yoredale strata, as 
have also the deep valleys of the Hebden and Horsebridge Cloughs.
The 
Kinder grit forms the great escarpments overhanging those valleys.
Going from the Kinder towards the moor in any direction, we traverse 
the extensive series of the third grits.
These beds are very fossiliferous.
A short distance to the west we come to the apex of the Pennine anti- 
clinal, and the Kinder grit again crops out, facing the west like a great 
mountain wall, along which the line dividing Lancashire from Yorkshire 
is carried.
The dip slope of the great anticlinal is a gentle one of about 
one yard in 21 on the Yorkshire side, but on the Lancashire side the 
rocks dip rapidly, almost standing on their ends for some distance.
The 
consequence of this is, that we meet with the coal strata on the Lanca- 
shire side in a short distance from the summit of the ridge ; in some 
places they are said to actually come over the ridge into Yorkshire, but 
Reports of Societies.
31 
on the Yorkshire side we have to traverse mile after mile of wild heather- 
clad moorlands of millstone grit, and only come across coal strata at 
Halifax — a distance of ten miles from the apex of the ridge.
Yorkshire Naturalists' Union.
— The tifth meeting for 1879 was 
held at Doncaster on Bank Holiday, August 4th, and was very 
largely attended.
The district proved extensively rich and full 
of interest, and the operations of the day yielded good results to 
all the Sections.
The entomologists spent their day in the rich hunting 
grounds of Edlington Wood and Loversall Quarry, while several of 
the botanists explored Potteric Carr, Sandal Beat, and the sur- 
rounding country.
At the general meeting, which was held at the 
Reindeer Hotel, Doncaster, the chair was occupied by the president, Mr.
H. Clifton Sorby, LL.D., F.R.S., &c., of Sheffield.
A vote of thanks was 
passed to the new subscribers, namely, Messrs.
Jno. Marshall of Sowerby 
Bridge, John Potts and John Hawley of Doncaster, and the Rev. H.
Thomas of Warmsworth.
A similar vote was warmly accorded to the 
local secretary, Mr. Thomas Birks, jun., of Goole, for very efficient 
arrangements.
The Sectional Reports were then given as follows : — Mr» 
W. E.
Clarke, of Leeds, secretary to the Vertebrate Section, reported : 
The localities visited by the members of this Section were Sandal Beat, 
Cantley, Black and Potteric Cars, Conisbro', Edlington Woods, Darfield, 
Ickleton, Brodsworth, Marthwick, and Melton-on-the-hill.
The animals 
observed were the mole, squirrel, fox, shrew, and common bat.
The 
birds were numerous, 48 species being reported, representing 38 residents 
and 10 migrants.
The principal species in these divisions were among 
the residents — the sparrow-hawk, kestrel, jay, green woodpecker and 
young, hawfinch and young, goldfinch, bullfinch, and great bunting ; 
among the migrants, the whinchat, willow wren, whitethroat and young, 
spotted flycatcher, yellow wagtail, martin, sand martin, swallow, and 
swift — the most noteworthy species being the hawfinch and young, and 
the goldfinch, both observed by Mr. Wm.
Talbot during a long walk from 
Wakefield.
The president of the Section (Mr. Thos.
Lister) made some 
remarks on the abundance of certain species of the warblers this season, 
notably the chifi'-chafi'.
— Mr. Joseph Wilcock, of Wakefield, reported 
on behalf of the Conchological Section.
— Mr. S.
D. Bairstow, of Hud- 
dersfield, secretary of the Entomological Section, reported as follows : —   
The Section had had one of its most successful days in connection with the 
Union.
Messrs.
W. Prest, G.
T. Porritt, and Hinds had come across a 
colony of the very local Scoparia basistrigalis, and had taken it in 
abundance in an area of perhaps a hundred square yards in Edlington 
wood.
A dozen or more were repeatedly found on the trunk of a single 
large tree.
They had also found fine larvae of Notodonta chaonia 
crawling up the oaks on the same ground.
Other good species, taken 
either as larvae or imagos by various members of the section, included — 
Thecla W-album, Ennomos f uscantaria, Phorodesma bajularia, Timandra 
32 
The Naturalist.
amataria, Anticlea rubidata, Scotosia vetulata, Ebulea crocealis, Scoparia 
cratsegalis, and many others.
As showing the extraordinary character of 
the season, Abraxas iihTiata was still out commonly in good condition, 
and Melanthia albicillata was by no means over.
A good deal of the 
success of the section was due to the leadership of Mr. John Hawley, of 
Doncaster, and to whom a unanimous vote of thanks was passed.
— Mr.
William West, of Bradford, secretary of the Botanical Section, reported 
that the places botanised over during the day were all in the Don drain- 
age.
A larger number of species had been seen than at any previous 
ramble of the Union, and this was accounted for by the fine weather and 
the various strata botanised over, for Doncaster is built on the Bunter 
sandstone, which is overlaid in many places by alluvial deposits, while the 
productive Permian hmestone lies close to the town on the west.
But the 
richest ground of all was the peaty tract to the south, where there was a 
perfect feast of Hygrophylous plants, and where the Bunter pebble beds 
about Cantley are covered only by gravel, several of the rarest plants of 
the day were found.
One party worked from Conisborough to Doncaster, 
another to the south of Doncaster, while a third took the direction of 
Seat, Sandal Wood, and through Cantley, returning by way of Potteric 
Carr.
The total number of vascular plants observed was 452, and cryp- 
togamic plants were certainly not very conspicuous, though a few were 
observed, and many more would undoubtedly have been noticed but the 
Carrs had to be rapidly gone through by some of the investigators in order 
to reach Doncaster too late for tea.
Among the rarer plants observed 
were — Thalictrum majus.

All the above plants, except 
where the localities are specified, were got on the route embracing 
Cantley and the Carrs.
Twenty species of mosses were observed, 
including Brachythecium glareosum, Barbula Hornschuchiana, and Pogo- 
natum nanum.
Six common species of Hepaticae were noticed.
Six 
lichens were observed, including Peltigera polydactyla, and also twelve 
species of fungi, including Melampsora populina, Tilletia caries, JEcidium 
tussilaginis, Uredo Circeae, Trichobasis suaveolens, Phallus impudicus, 
and Polyporus squamosus.

A NEW BRTUM {B.
ORIGANUM).
By H.
Boswell.
Amongst a few critical mosses gathered by Mr. Wesley in Teesdale 
last June, and sent me for examination, is one which has proved very 
interesting and difficult to determine.
At first sight the reddish tint 
of the upper leaves suggested B.
pallens or turbinatum, but the habit 
and foliage were very unlike those mosses, and resembled B.
barbatum^ 
Wils., under which name I was disposed after some further inspection 
to let it remain, but there are certain points of difference which it 
seems impossible to ignore, and as at the same time the present plant 
seems to disagree with all previously known species, there seems to 
remain no other course but to give it a new name, however undesirable 
it may be to increase our list with another imperfect species, for it 
was unfortunately gathered in small quantity only, and is without 
flowers or fruit ; but the form and texture of the leaves appear 
distinct and sufficient to render it well marked.
The name 
proposed was suggested by the peculiar colours, and it may be thus 
described : — 
" Bryum Origanum, nov.
sp.
" Stems elongated about an inch or more, copiously radiculose and 
forming dense soft tufts.
Leaves ovate and ovate-lanceolate shortly 
pointed, scarcely acuminate, concave, nerved almost to the apex, cells 
leptodermous oblong and nearly rectangular, margins plane, slightly 
recurved when dry, formed of a single row of narrower cells." — Shady 
Old Wall, Teesdale, June 1879, J.
S. Wesley.
In soft dense tufts, foliage full green, the young leaves at the 
summit rosy -pink, the old foliage of former years and lower part deep 
brown, stems and leaves matted with numerous radicles.
Habit and 
general aspect much as in B.
barbatum, Wils., or some forms of B.
ceneum from Norway ; from the former it differs in the form of the 
leaves which are not piliferous -acuminate, in the nerve ceasing below 
the apex, in the form of the cells and their very thin walls.
The 
name of B.
barbatum has been changed in the second and recent 
edition of Schimper's excellent Synopsis, but for what reason does 
not appear, any more than in the analogous case of Zygodon 
gracilis.

A LIST OF BIRDS IN THE TOWNSHIP OF SCARCROFT.
By W.
H. Hay.
ScAECROFT is a Tillage about six and three-quarter miles north of 
Leeds ; it is a well Tvooded district, intersected by numerous streams, 
and contains several large ponds and mill-dams — making the district 
one of great interest to the ornithologist.
Kestrel [Falco tinnunculus) — I have only seen a few pairs of this 
hawk during all the years I hare worked the district.
Sparrow Hawk {Accipiter Nisus).
— Equally scarce as the kestrel.
A 
pair occasionally breeds in the woods, but are generally shot by 
the keepers before the young can fly.
Barn Owl (Strix Jlammea) and Tawny Owl {Syrnium aluco).
— These 
birds are now almost extinct in the Scarcroft district, owing to the 
enmity of keepers and farmers.
Spotted Flycatcher [Muscicapa grisola).
— I am happy to say that of 
late years this bird has become more frequent.
Missel Thrush {Turdus viscivorus), Storm Cock.
— Common in all 
parts of the township.
Song Thrush (Turdus musicus), Throstle.
— Equally common with the 
last named.
Fieldfare (Turdus pilaris), Felfer.
— A winter visitant arriving in the 
district about the middle of October, departing end of March or 
beginning of April.
Numerous.
Red-wing {Turdus iliacus).
— This bird is often confounded by the 
country lads with the missel thrush.
I have been told time after 
time that the Redwing was building in such a place, but I need 
scarcely add that the news was false.
Plentiful.
Blackbird {Turdus merula).
— A common bird in the township.
During the past severe winter of 1878-9 I noticed that the black- 
bird stood the cold and was in better condition at Christmas than 
either the fieldfare or redwing.
Hedge Sparrow {Accentor modular is).
— A very common bird in this 
district, one of our earliest breeders.
Robin {Eyrthaca ruhecola), Robin Redbreast.
— This bold little 
favourite is moderately abundant; it is also an early breeder.
Hay : List of Birds in the Neighbourhood of Scaecropt.
35 
Redstart {Phoenicura ruticilla) Red-tail.
— One of our sunimer 
migrants.
An irregular visitor in this township ; in 1875 it was 
common, whereas in the following year it was scarce.
Grasshopper Warbler (Salicaria locustella).
— A summer visitor, 
breeding in the township.
I am inclined to think that it is more 
common than is thought.
Stonechat (Saxicola rubicola).
— A few pairs make their appearance 
during the spring, but I do not think they breed in the township.
Whinchat [Saxicola ruhetra).
— Not common ; breeds here.
Sedge Warbler (Salicaria phragmites).
— This migrant is common at 
Scarcroft, and is often mistaken for the nightingale.
Black-cap {Curruca atricapilla).
— A very shy bird, common in this 
district : one of our sweetest songsters.
Whitethroat {Curruca cinerea), Nettle-creeper, &c.
— Common at 
Scarcroft.
Its nest may be found in any of the lanes.
Lesser Whitethroat {Curruca, sylviella).
— Not so plentiful as the last- 
named.
Willow Wren {Sylvia trochilus) Yellow Wren.
— A lively little bird, 
common in the township.
Chiff-chaff (Sylvia hippolais).
— Not very common at Scarcroft.
Golden-crested Wren (Regulus cristatus).
— About the smallest of our 
native birds.
Scarce in the township ; breeds here ; resident.
Great Tit (Parus major), Black-cap, Ox-eye.
— A common bird, that 
may be seen in gardens and fields at any time of the year.
Blue Tit (Parus ccsruleus), Bluecap.
— Equally numerous with the last.
Cole Tit [Parus ater).
— Not scarce in the township, but not so 
common as the last two.
Pied Wagtail [Motacilla Yarrellii), Water Wagtail.
— Common in the 
township.
Grey Wagtail [Motacilla hoarula), Yellow Wagtail.
— May be often 
seen during winter following the plough.
Tree Pipit [Anthus arboreus), Tree-lark.
— Not so plentiful as the tit- 
lark, for which it is often mistaken.
Meadow Pipit [Anthus pratensis), Titlark.
— This bird may be distin- 
guished from the tree pipit by its mode of singing.
The meadow 
pipit sings in both its upward and downward flight ; A.
arboreus 
only during its descent.
86 
The Naturalist, 
Skylark (Alauda arvensis).
— Common in the township.
Yellow Bunting (Emheriza citrinella), Yold ring, Yellowliammer.
— 
Eesident : very common in the township.
Eeed Bunting {Emheriza schceniclus), Eeed Sparrow, Black-headed 
Bunting.
— May be seen on any stream side.
Chaffinch [Fringilla coelehs), Bull-spink.
— This beautiful bird is very 
abundant all over the township.
Mountain Finch (Fringilla monti/ringilla), B rambling.
Plentiful 
during winter, when it consorts with the chaffinch.
House Sparrow {Passer domesticus).
— During a visit to New York in 
1874, I was struck by the rapid increase of this species, which was 
introduced into that State some short time since.
It takes possession 
of the breeding boxes which are placed against trees and houses 
for the convenience of the purple martin, and holds them after 
desperate fighting with the rightful owners.
Greenfinch {Coccothraiistes chloris), Green Linnet.
— Another equally 
common resident.
Breeds freely all over the township.
Linnet {Linota cannahind), Grey Linnet, Red Linnet.
— Common.
Lesser Eedpoll {Linota linaria), Chivey Linnet.
— Not so plentiful as 
the last, but well distributed.
Bullfinch {Pyrrhula vulgaris).
— Rather scarce, owing to the persecu- 
tion of bird-catchers.
Starling {Sturnus vulgaris).
— This brilliant-plumaged bird is common 
all over the township.
'Rook {Corvus frugilegus) — This well-known bird is very common, 
although it does not breed within three miles.
Jackdaw {Corvus monedula).
— A common bird, consorting with the 
rooks.
Magpie {Pica caudata).
— A few 'pairs breed here every season.
Are 
much persecuted by gamekeepers.
Jay {Garrulus glandarius), Blue Jay.
— A rare bird in the township.
I have only seen four or five since 1868.
Wren {Troglodytes vulgaris).
— During the breeding season of 
1876 a pair of these birds built a nest, and reared a brood of 
young, in the doorway of a summer-house in Mr. Mann's 
garden at Scarcroft.
Not a day passed without someone entering 
the place, yet the birds showed no signs of fear.
The same place 
Hay : List of Birds in the Neighbourhood of Scarcroft.

was chosen the following year.
Unfortunately the eggs were 
destroyed, and the birds forsook the place, only to breed in a rustic 
flower stand on the lawn.
Cuckoo (Cuculus canorus).
— A common bird all over the township.
Hearing the first cuckoo and seeing the first swallow are always 
great events to lovers of country sights and sounds.
Kingfisher (Alcedo ispidd), — This is the most beautiful of our native 
birds ; it is not common in the township, but is well distributed.
Swallow {Hirundo rwsi(ica), House Swallow, Barn Swallow.
— The most 
welcome of our spring migrants : common.
Martin {Hirundo urhica), House Martin.
— Another favourite bird, 
not quite so numerous as H.
rustica.
Sand Martin {Hirimdo riparia), Bank Swallow.
— Not numerous.
I 
only know of one breeding-place in the township, and that is in a 
sandstone quarry close to the high road.
Swift [Cypselus apus), Screech Martin, Long-winged Swallow.
— Not 
common.
Night Jar {Caprimulgm europaus), Goat-sucker.
— Owing to its noc- 
turnal habits, this bird is seldom seen by casual observers.
Far 
from numerous.
Ringdove {Columba palimbus), Wood Pigeon, Stockdove.
Common 
all over the township.
Pheasant {PTiadams colcJiicus).
— Not numerous.
Common Partridge {Perdix cinerea).
— Not common in this district, 
but more numerous than the pheasant.
Lapwing ( Vanellus cristatus), Pewit, Tewit.
— Common in the township.
Common Heron {Ardea c'merea).
Only an occasional visitor from 
Bramham and Harewood Parks.
"Woodcock {Scolopax rusticola).
— One seen here by Mr. Mann, the 
first week in January of this year (1879).
Land Rail {Crex pratensis), Daker Hen.
— Common in the district.
Moor Hen {flallinula cJiloropus\ Water Hen.
— Plentiful in most of 
the ponds and streams.
Wild Duck {Anas Bosckas).
— A few of these birds frequent the town- 
ship every winter.

The Hawfinch at Huddersfield.
— On the 2nd inst., I had the 
pleasure, for almost an hour, of watching a beautiful hawfinch in my 
garden.
I was under the impression this bird was usually considered a 
very shy one, but this was as fearless as a robin.
When first seen, it was 
feeding on the seeds of the grass growing at the edge, and on the gravel 
drive, twelve or fifteen yards from the front door of the house, but it 
gradually worked its way up to beneath the window, and was for a 
quarter of an hour or so only from about two to three yards from where 
I and Mrs. Porritt stood at the window watching it.
Although it must 
have seen us, it did not seem at all alarmed so long as we remained 
perfectly still ; but a slight noise evidently disturbed it once, when it 
flew over into the adjoining shrubbery, but was back again on the gravel 
path in a few minutes.
We of course saw every movement, and even 
every grass seed as the bird pecked them off.
The hawfinch has nested

here several times.
I remember seeing a nest and eggs taken outside the 
town, some years ago, and have heard of one or two other instances 
since.

Nesting of Montagu's Harrier near York.
— It is not without 
pleasure that I am able to record the nesting of Montagu's harrier {Falco 
Montagui), near York, and as this bird is very rarely met with in any part 
of Britain, perhaps a few notes concerning it will be interesting to the 
readers of the Naturalist.
In the spring of 1875, Mr. Widdas (a well- 
known naturalist both in Leeds and York) and two of his ornitho- 
logical friends were rambling through the woods, in the neighbourhood 
of Sutton-on-Forest.
They had been searching about for some time, 
when, approaching some whin bushes, out flew a harrier, which from its 
small size and general appearance they unmistakeably came to the 
conclusion was none other than Falco Montagui.
Luckily for the 
bird, Mr. Widdas' gun was unloaded at the time, so they contented 
themselves with gazing at the bird until it disappeared from view ; then 
advancing towards the spot where they first saw it arise, they were 
surprised to find a nest, containing one egg, placed on the top of some 
brambles.
As it was the first Montagu's harrier's nest they had seen in 
situ, no little time was spent in examining its structure.
The nest, which 
was built about 8ft.
above the ground, was chiefly composed of rushes and 
other aquatic plants.
It measured about l|ft.
in diameter.
In the centre 
was a hollow about the size of a boy's cap.
Other materials used were 
cow's hair, moss, grass, &c.
The egg is now in my possession, and difiers 
very slightly from other eggs of the Montagu's harrier in my collection.

Kite v.
Buzzard.
— In the Naturalist for August (vol.
v., p.
10) Mr.
Clarke expresses his opinion — or, as this term to a certain extent pre- 
supposes ignorance, it would perhaps be more correct to say judgment — 
that I was probably wrong in my identification of the bird I saw in the 
neighbourhood on the 7th Sept., 1877.
Mr. Clarke inclines to the belief 
that I mistook the bird for a buzzard.
This verdict he bases on two 
grounds : first, that he has himself observed the buzzard fly in exactly 
the same manner as my description of the flight of the above-mentioned 
bird ; second, that the buzzard is subject to great variety, light-coloured, 
even white, heads being by no means uncommon.
I quite agree with Mr.
Clarke, notwithstanding all that has been written to the contrary, that 
the buzzard does frequently fly at a somewhat great elevation and in 
sweeping circles, but this habit is not often indulged in when in quest of 
food.
The bird which I saw on the above date, and which I took to be 
a kite, was flying at an elevation of not less than 300 feet, and was 
evidently searching for food.
It wheeled around and around with 
motionless wings, over a field at the northern extremity of this village, 
with such ease, buoyancy, and elegance, and capable of being to all 
appearance prolonged to almost any length of time without apparent

exertion, that precludes me from entertaining the idea that it was a 
buzzard.
I find, on referring to the Zoologist for 1877, that no less than 
three kites were seen in the county of Norfolk.
One observed by Mr.
Gurney, jun., on May 2nd, had a light-coloured head.
The sky was very 
clear at the time, and he saw its head distinctly.
Another is recorded by 
Mr. Stevenson as having been killed about the third week in January.
Taking into consideration the facts that with advancing age the head 
becomes lighter-coloured, in one sex at least, and the above specimen 
mentioned by Mr. Gurney, the occurrence of the kite in this part with a 
light-coloured head is not an extremely improbable contingency.
I may 
add, in conclusion, that I was not favourably situated for observing its 
tail, even had it struck me at the moment, as I was on the brow of the 
hill overlooking the beautiful Goit Stock valley, with an extensive tract 
of moorland in the background.
If I had seen the bird from beneath, I 
could not have failed to notice the formation of its tail, which is its most 
distinctive feature.

Whitby Conchological Addenda.
— Seeing that so much care is being 
taken to compile a list of the moUuscan fauna of Whitby and neighbour- 
hood, perhaps it would be as well to send from time to time such 
additions as one comes across whilst there, in the hope of attracting 
other malacologists who reside nearer than ourselves to the work.
Common things which one scarcely ever puts into a list, such as Helix 
aspersa, Avion ater, Limax agrestis, &c., are here, as elsewhere, a 
nuisance ; nor is a yellow variety of the black slug A.
ater uncommon 
just outside the town.
To the slugs we might add Limax maximus, 
which occurs very abundantly in Bagdale, in company with L.
flavus, 
which has been already recorded.
Near to Saltwick we took, whilst 
examining in a pond some fresh-water algae, (Cladophora) Pisidium 
<imnicum and P.
pusillum.
At a short distance from this pond we came 
across Limncea peregra, var.
decollata, in a horse-trough.
Remarks 
respecting captures, in whatever order, being always more useful 
than bare lists, we append a Uttle observation made on this variety.
The 
trough is a small one, little used, and doing duty for two fields.
From a 
rill in one of these comes the supply of water, which fills the trough up 
to a certain height, where it is checked by an exit pipe.
The collected 
water is exceedingly clear, not a particle of mud visible, and but little 
sediment at the bottom — due, without doubt, to the filtration which the 
water has undergone while passing along the sandy bottom of the water- 
course.
It is evident that under such conditions little lime is present, 
and yet in this narrow area are hundreds of decollated peregra, living and 
multiplying.
If lime be very scarce or absent, abnormal shells must be 
produced, and this is practically the case, for thin, small truncated shells 
only obtain.
It has been put forth more than once that snails decollate 
their own shells.
This may be true of terrestrial ones, but, from observa- 
tions made upon some L.
stagnalis which I have now in an aquarium, 
existing under circumstances somewhat analagous to the case under 
Reports of Societies.
43 
citation, the cause of the erosion of shells is not hidden, for even when 
well supplied with algse, the animals take a delight seemingly in eating 
the shells of their associates, until in some cases the habitation is eaten 
through, and the animal dies.
Given, then, two aquaria — one artificially, 
and the other naturally supplied with water, in each case a certain form 
of shell being produced — might we not then surely say that decollation, 
especially in fresh-water molluscs, is due to the action of snails other than 
the occupants of the decollated shells, when its cause has been traced in 
the artificial, and no other cause can be assigned in the natural aquarium ?
Can we hope that we have given the deathblow to the long-drawn idea 
that water molluscs cut ofi" the apex of their own shells so that they may 
be lighter in travelling ?
In all my decollated peregra other points of 
erosion are palpable, plainly pointing to a natural cause for the production 
of the variety decollata amongst our fresh-water molluscs.

Cruckley Gill we found Unio Margaritifer, and rarely the var.
sinuata ; 
in the woods there, Helix fusca.

Entomologicae Captures at Skegness.
— At Skegness, on Saturday 
last, F.
Cardui was in great abundance ; I and Mr. W.
Talbot took six 
very good specimens each, and saw a great many more.
Flusia gamma 
literally swarmed, and proved a great nuisance.
The larvae of B.

Entomological Captures near Doncaster.
— At Edlington Wood, on 
Sept.
1st, with my friend ]Mr. C.
W. Simmons, I found Scoparia hasistri- 
galis stni out, but much worn ; and Theda W-alhum.
We had also the 
pleasure of taking a fine series of Hyponomeuta plumhella.
When I 
reached York I saw that Mr. Hind, who was with us at the August 
excursion, had also bred H.
plumhella from larvae then taken off spindle.
I also took in the wood fine specimens of Ennomos angularia and Tinea 
semifulvella.

Correction.
— In the "List of Mosses occurring near Wetherby," in 
the September number of the Naturalist, Ulota intermedia, Schpr., is an

Barnsley Naturalists' Society.
— Meeting Sept.
16th.
— The botanical 
section gave in its report of flowers noted, since last meeting, within five 
miles radius of Barnsley, and those from a distance.
The most rare for 
this part were Echium vulgare, Carduus palnstris and Linaria minor — all 
from the vale of Dearne.
The entomological section reported the insects 
taken, not many being different from former seasons.
In the ornitho- 
logical department, the resumption of song by the robin, willow warbler, 
wood warbler, and yellow-hammer, was noted.
The swift was observed 
on the second week of this month.
Night-flying birds noted August 12th, 
supposed to be stints and other waders disturbed by the guns on the 
moors, still fly over the town.
Gulls frequently observed flying overhead.
Blackbirds, thrushes, and larks yet scarce, and rarely heard to sing ; on the 
other hand lesser redpoles, meadow pipits, starlings, and titmice are seen 
about the houses near the town.

which he had taken two specimens at Skegness, on the Lincolnshire 
coast, last July.
With the imago he exhibited a figure of the larva, 
drawn by Mr, William Buckler, of Emsworth, from a continental speci- 
men.
The larva feeds on Artemisia campestris and probably other species 
of Artemisia.
Also specimens of another Eupithecia, supposed to be a 
new species, which had been bred from larvas found on Scabious on the 
coast at Lynmouth.
Also Phihalapteryx lapidata, taken by Richard

a few slides illustrative of the borderland between animal and vegetable 
life, and delivered an address upon them.
Mr. W.
Denison Roebuck 
exhibited Oynips gemmoe, L.
{C.
fecundatrix, Hartig.), Nematus virescens, 
Hartig., and Poecilosoma longicorne, Thoms., all collected by Mr. S.

table showing all the occurrences of 
Vanessa Antiopa in Britain in 1872, to the number of 176 specimens.
A 
letter from Mr. James Carter, of Masham, was read, in which he noted 
that Vanessa cardui was remarkably abundant in that locality this year, 
almost as plentiful as V.

351st Meeting, Sept.
16th, Mr. J.
R. Murdoch mentioned that Dr.
Wesley had presented to the Club herbarium a large number of mosses, 
collected about Wetherby, excellently preserved, and including Euryn- 
chium Swartzii, Camptothecium nitens, BracJiythecium plumosum, Hypnum

shown.
Mr. Walter Raine showed eggs of Montagu's harrier, taken at 
Sutton-on-the-Forest, near York ; of turtle-doves from Acomb ; of merlin 
from Darlington ; and three beautiful varieties of the thick-knee plover 
from Norfolk.— W.

Manchester Oryptogamic Society.
— Monthly meeting, Mr. John 
Whitehead, president, in the chair.
— The secretary (Mr. Rogers) read a 
letter from Mr. Bos well, of Oxford, enclosing specimens of several rare 
mosses.
The president laid before the meeting a moss of the genus 
Philonotis, gathered upon Ben Muich-Dhui in 1876, which appeared to be 
undescribed in any of the text-books.
He had sent a specimen to the 
Rev. J.
Fergusson, who, in reply, stated that the form was not unknown 
to him, but that he had seen fruit of it for the first time this season.
He 
had named it, provisionally, Philonotis firma.
With regard to Bedwigia 
striata, exhibited at the last meeting, from near Grasmere, the president 
said that in looking through Mr. Ashton's collection he had found a 
fruiting specimen gathered in Llanberis Pass.
This was a fortunate dis- 
covery, as the moss was extremely rare — three localities only being known 
for it.
It was first found by the late Mr. W.
Wilson in 1829, at Llyn 
Idwal, and named by him Ancectangium striatum.
Another very rare 
moss, Tortnla papillosa, was exhibited by the president, having been 
found on trees brought to Ashton-under-Lyne from the neighbourhood of 
Welshpool.
Fontinalis gracilis, which has been a subject of much dis- 
cussion amongst muscologists, was likewise exhibited.
Mr. Holt handed 
in a collection of mosses from Cressbrook Dale, Derbyshire, including 
several interesting species, namely, Bryum Zierii (barren), Necke^-a com- 
planata (fruit), Sissideyis pusillus, and Hypnum chrysophyllum.
Other 
members exhibited (Edipodium Griffithianum (a species peculiar to 
Britain), gathered upon Snowdon last month ; and the finding of Andrecea 
alpestris in the same neighbourhood, and of A.
falcata, crassinerma, and 
other species in Llanberis Pass was also mentioned ; but these are to 
form the subject of discussion at a future meeting.
Rhahdoweissa fugax 
and R.
denticulata were reported to have been found in great abundance 
this autumn both at Llanberis Pass, at Llyn Ogwen, and in the neigh- 
bourhood of Dolgelly.
OvENDEN Naturalists' Society.
— Monthly meeting, Aug. 31st, Mr.

— Mr. Smith exhibited a fine variety of 
Veronica spicata, with variegated leaves, cultivated ; also the following 
beetles : — P.
horticola and P.
fasciculus ; Mr. Bacon, the rufi"-and-reeve, 
with eggs (Machetes pugnax) ; Mr. Whitwell, specimens of Drosera 
anglica and D.
obovata, from Leckby Carr, the latter of which has not 
been, as far as we know, recorded in Yorkshire before.
Mr. Arnold Lees 
is of opinion that the specimens of obovata are hybrids between anglica 
and rotundifolia, both of which occur at the same spot ; also specimens of 
the rare Vicia bithynica, lately collected by him at Upgang, near Whitby.
Mr. Whitwell also showed specimens of fossil plants obtained by him from 
the fern bed at Whitby, lying upon the Dogger sandstone at the base of 
the oolitic series.
The following genera of ferns were represented : — 
Pecopteris, Sphcenopteris, Tceniopteris, and also specimens of Calamites 
and Otozamites.
Mr. G.
Jackson, fine bred specimens of Coremia uniden- 
taria, bred from the eggs ; Larentia ulivata and coesiata, and Cidaria 
populata, taken at the Pateley Bridge excursion : also Leucanea obsoleta, 
Nonagria cannce, Agrotis cinerea, and various others.

Yorkshire Naturalists' Union.
— The excursion season of 1879 was 
brought to a close on Saturday, the 6th of September, by an excursion 
to Piccall Common (over which there is still hanging the threatened 
doom of enclosure), followed by a meeting at Selby.
There was a fair 
average attendance, principally from Goole.
A few members investigated 
various other localities about Selby, including the never-failing Bishop's 
Wood.
At the general meeting held at the Londesbro' Arms Hotel, 
Selby, the business was commenced by Mr. J.
T. Atkinson, F.G.S., 
President of the Selby Naturalists' Society, who ofiered in their name a 
hearty welcome.
The Rev. W.
Fowler, M.A., in the absence of the 
president, took the chair.
Time being limited, some of the business was 
shortened.
On calling the roll it was found that 14 societies were 
represented, and 13 absent, the individual attendance being about 70 or 
80.
On the motion of Mr. G.
T. Porritt, F.L.S., Huddersfield, seconded 
by Mr. William Prest, York, a vote of thanks was tendered to Mr. W.
N. 
Cheesman, the secretary of the Selby Naturalists' Society, for his eflScient 
services as local secretary.
On behalf of the Conchological Section, Mr.
Joseph Wilcock, Wakefield, secretary, reported.
For the Entomological 
Section, Mr. S.
D. Bairstow, Huddersfield, secretary, reported a great 
paucity of lepidopterous insects as compared with the meeting at Doncaster 
the previous month.
The best noticed were Liparis monacha, larva of 
Acronycta menyanthidis, and pupse of Gortyna flavago in thistle stems.
48 
The NA.TURALIST.
Neuroptera, particularly dragon-flies, on the contrary were much more 
numerous at this excursion ; they abounded on the damp parts of the 
Common.
— On behalf of the Botanical Section, Mr. Wm.
West, Bradford, 
secretary, stated that the districts explored were E/iccall Common, the 
woods and ponds adjoining, the ponds at Kelfield, and the river bank 
from Selby to Turn Head.
The number of vascular plants noticed was 
313, notably amongst which were four species of Allium from the river 
bank above Selby, viz., carinatum, oleraceum, Scorodoprasum, and 
vineale, var.
bulbiferum ; the four species of Lemna, Helosciadium 
repens, Koch, Mentha Pulegium, Drosera intermedia, D.
rotundifolia, 
Gentiana Pneumonanthe, Thalictrum flavum, Rumex maritimus, Arctium 
majus, Pimpinella magna, Hypericum dubium, H.

autumnale, and Stellaria glauca.
Fifty-three species of mosses were 
observed, including Sphagnum rigidum, S.
subsecundum, S.
tenellum, 
Pottia minutula, Bryum pseudo-triquetrum, Atrichum tenellum, H.
Schreberi, and H.
imponens.
A few Hepaticse were noted, Riccia glauca 
from fields between Selby and Turn Head ; six common species of 
lichens ; many species of fungi, not all named.
Amongst those that have 
been named were Puccinia Amphibii, Coleosporium Petasitis, Lecythea 
Saliceti, and Agaricus hypnorum.
Many small algae were collected, 
Desmids being especially abundant.
The following are a few of the 
species collected on Piccall Common : — Spirogyra nitida, S.
quinina, 
Arthrodesmus convergens, Staurastrum gracile, S.
furcigerum, Euastrum 
(elegans ?), Scenedesmus quadricauda, Ankistrodesmus falcatus, Pandorina 
morum, Cosmarium pyramidatum, C.
margaritiferum, Tabellaria floccu- 
losa, Docidium baculum, and three species of Closterium.
— There was no 
meeting of the Geological Section, but Mr. J.
T. Atkinson, F.G.S , 
favored the general meeting with a brief outline of the geology of the 
district.
— On behalf of the Vertebrate Section, Mr. Thomas Lister of 
Barnsley, president, stated that, considering the limited range of observa- 
tion, the vertebrates were pretty numerous.
Of resident birds upwards of 
twenty were observed, the chief of which were — marsh tit, blue tit, twite, 
greenfinch, grey linnet, lesser redpole, pied wagtail, meadow pipit, moor- 
hen, little grebe, wild duck, heron, teal, kestrel, common bunting, yellow 
hammer ; of migrants (10) — willow warbler, sedge warbler, whinchat, 
whitethroat, Pay's wagtail, and swift.
Of animals, two vipers, the ringed 
snake, mole, and bat were noted.
— The chairman announced that the 
next meeting would be the annual one, at Huddersfield, on the 17th of 
January, 1880, and the secretary urged upon the members the desira- 
bility of their attending it, stating that the Huddersfield members were 
arranging to make it unusually interesting.
The secretary also requested 
the members to think over the names of places suitable for next season's 
meetings.

NOTES ON THE BUZZARD {BUTEO VULGARIS).
By Wm. Eagle Clarke.
In these days of game-preserving wlien the useful kestrel and owls, 
and even the magpie and the jay, are to be found in the rank and 
file of the keeper's enemies, it is not surprising that so large a hawk 
as the buzzard has ceased to perform those duties allotted to it by 
Nature for her economy, and to be an object adding to the beauty 
and interest of most of our woodland districts.
This is greatly to be 
deplored, as it is a most useful bird — a great destroyer of rats, mice, 
moles, and other animals, which, when they become numerous, are 
alike prejudicial to the interests of the agriculturalist and landowner.
It also preys upon weakly birds and animals, thus furthering Nature's 
design for the survival of the fittest.
But alas !
poor buzzard, you 
are sometimes guilty of snatching a young pheasant — a most heinous 
crime in this enlightened age !
consequently your good qualities are 
reckoned as nought, and you are doomed to perish, paying penalty to 
that insatiable tyrant, modern sport.
Among the wild mountain crags of England and Wales (also Scot- 
land, but my experience does not apply to that country), the buzzard's 
existence is not quite so precarious, though it often falls a victim to 
the baited trap, and on the moors to the pole trap.
This last is a 
most cruel instrument, and should by right come under the lash of 
the Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.
But even in these 
secluded wilds its numbers are very limited, and it can hardly be said 
to be increasing.
In the year 1876 I made a special tour in the 
north of England for the purpose of procuring autheniic eggs for my 
collection, and becoming acquainted with this species in its mountain 
home ; and in the years 1877 and 1878 I had again opportunities of 
observing it among the Welsh mountains.
In these districts its 
habits, flight, and nidification greatly resemble those of the golden 
eagle, and when seen on the wing at a distance, it might easily be 
mistaken for that species.
The expanse of wing of one specimen 
obtained in 1875 was 4ft.
Gin. Its food consists chiefly of moles, in 
the pursuit of which it is to be seen soaring in circles over the fell- 
sides, often at a considerable elevation.
It also feeds on carrion in 
the shape of dead sheep.
In winter it ceases to roost on the fells, 
seeking shelter in the plantations of the lower levels.
The character 
of laziness given to this species by some naturalists cannot here be

sustained, for the general barrenness of a mountain district precludes 
the possibility of a lazy bird existing.
The following are extracts from my note-book, made during the 
1876 excursions, and will give some idea of the nidification and other 
habits of this bird : — 
May 6th : At the hour appointed the cragsman arrives with his long 
rope (usually used to extract sheep from inaccessible places), my friend 
and myself accompany him.
Crossing the lake in a boat, we land 
and ascend the mountain to a spot where it is bi-sected by a deep and 
narrow ravine, at the angle of which a mountain torrent leaps 100ft.
below, forming a grand waterfall.
Carefully approaching the side, we 
are gratified by a sight of the old bird as she hurriedly leaves her 
nest, exposing to our anxious gaze her two eggs.
The nest is placed 
some 15ft.
below, on the broad stem of a large mountain ash which 
springs from the perpendicular side, and is simply a hollow surrounded 
by stout heather stems, lined with finer heather and dry grass.
The 
eggs are easily procured with the aid of ropes, and are of a dirty 
white ground colour, sparingly blotched with dull blood red.
Alto- 
gether the site is beautiful in the extreme.
Descending to the boat, we proceed up the lake for about a mile, 
and landing on the opposite side, proceed to a second nest, which 
is situate in an unfrequented valley quite in the mountains, and 1500 
feet above the level of the lake.
After a climb of an hour-and-a-half 
we arrive at the site, the precipitous rocky side of a torrent, locally 
known as a "gill." We again approach from above with caution, and 
are favored with a glimpse of the old bird as she leaves her nest, 
which is not visible from above.
Being wishful to inspect it, the rope 
is carefully adjusted, and I reach the nest some 20ft.
below, suffering 
slight inconvenience from the shower of small stones and sand from 
above ; but I am well prepared for the stones by having our united 
pocket handkerchiefs in the crown of my hat.
The nest is placed on 
a very narrow ledge, so narrow that it is impossible to stand upon it 
without support by the rope from above, and is of large dimensions, 
being quite two feet high and 18in.
in diameter — a very compact 
structure of heather stems of the thickness of one's little finger, lined 
with finer heather and dry grass.
The eggs, two in number, are 
remarkably clean, with rather more red markings than the last.
On 
the same ledge, a few feet to the right is a nest of former years, of 
similar construction, and apparently in good repair, placed between 
the face of the rock and the stem of a slender mountain ash I 
The eggs from both the nests proved to be considerably incubated.

May 8th : I am tempted to make a divergence from my subject, 
and to give the following interesting note on the nesting of the tawny 
owl.
Acting on information I had received last evening, I visited a 
certain barn, the hay in which reaches to within a yard of the roof, 
and on the top I find three eggs of the tawny owl placed on a slight 
depression, and immediately opposite a narrow opening in the wall.
The eggs had been forsaken some weeks owing to a curious misfortune 
having happened to the old bird, which somehow managed to find its 
way down a chimney into an unoccupied bedroom, where it was found 
almost starved to death, perched upon a chest of drawers.
In the evening we obtained information of another buzzard's nest, 
and after a hasty tea set out.
The climb being much more stiff than 
before, it is dusk when we reach the site, which is excessively wild 
and exposed, being the face of crag at the summit of a pike 2000ft.
high, and overlooks a desolate rocky valley whose almost perpen- 
dicular sides are strewn with detached rocks.
The nest is easy to get 
at from above, but unfortunately the rope is left behind.
The old 
bird is very reluctant to leave, although we shout and make a great 
noise, and it is some minutes before she is scared.
To my friend and 
myself this nest is quite inaccessible ; it is, however, reached by our 
guide in masterly style but at the greatest possible risk.
The eggs 
are two in number like the others, but more liberally dashed with 
red brown.
It is quite dark long before we reach the inn.
May 12th.
After climbing one of the wildest passes in England, 
and crossing an uninhabited narrow valley in which lies a secluded 
lake, we ascend the opposite mountain and recline to take a little 
rest, and look back upon the wild valley and mountains.
Before us 
is a celebrated mountain from whose inaccessible sides a buzzard flies ; 
at first she wings her way with heavy flight, performed by slow 
deliberate flaps of her broad and powerful wings, she pauses, almost 
coming to a standstill, and then wheeling, commences to rise by the 
most graceful and easy gyrations, performed apparently without the 
slightest effort.
Higher and higher the bird rises, until at last she 
becomes a mere speck in the clouds, and the elevation reached can- 
not be less than 6000ft.
It is the triumph of the wing, and we 
watch her long, leaving reluctantly to resume our way.
May 13th : We are favoured by a sight which is now-a-days a 
very rare one in England — a pair of ravens pursuing a buzzard.
The ravens, with bills upturned like bayonets and with vigorously 
flapping wings, are making vain endeavours to reach the hawk, which, 
as though to tantalise, keeps just above them, rising in very small

circles.
Presently the buzzard's mate appears on the scene, and, as if 
cheered, the pursued one makes a powerful stoop, and the pursuers, just 
escaping, realise the fact that "discretion is the better part of valour," 
and hurry away, leaving the buzzard master of the field, or rather the 
space.
This reminds me of the pair of buzzards mentioned by Thompson 
(Nat. Hist.
Ireland ; Birds, I, p.
73.) which usurped a raven's nest, 
the latter birds fought hard, but in vain, the buzzards conquered and 
reared their young.
Both incidents show that the buzzard is pos- 
sessed of considerable courage, the raven being an enemy not to be 
despised.
May 15th : After searching for sandpiper's eggs on the lake side, 
we ascend a bold crag which overhangs its surface and which is some 
300ft.
high.
This is a favourite haunt of the buzzard, and after a short 
search we succeed in putting the old bird from her nest ; she does 
not make off as before, but perches on a mountain ash just above the 
nest.
Having procured the rope and appearing again above the nest, 
the old bird leaves, uttering a loud and plaintive cry which has some- 
thing remarkably cat-like about it ; this she continues to do, flying 
backwards and forwards over the lake, until she is joined by her 
mate who appears mysteriously from far above, and then both sail 
quietly away.
My friend is lowered to the nest which is in the face 
of the crag, about 40ft.
from the top, and placed in a little cave in the 
rock, with a slender mountain ash springing immediately from its 
front.
The nest is similar to those already visited by us in construc- 
tion, and again contains two eggs, one of which is a very beautiful 
specimen, being dashed with neutral tint besides the usual reddish- 
brown markings.
During my visits to Wales I often observed the buzzard hunting, 
and sometimes hanging as it were almost motionless over the fell 
sides.
I am sorry to say that during the thirteen months that elapsed 
between my first and second visits the keeper had shot and trapped 
no less than fourteen birds ; one of these I imagine from his descrip- 
tion to have been a rough-legged buzzard, which, so far as our county 
is concerned, is the commoner bird of the two, although only occupying 
the position of an autumn visitor on the British list.
A young 
common buzzard obtained in Wales was useful in the garden, and 
would follow anyone digging, for the sake of the worms.
In conclusion, I would remark that, taking into consideration the 
habits, build, flight, &c., of the buzzard, which seem to be so much 
akin to the eagle, and also the fact that the rough -legged buzzard

shares with the golden and spotted eagles the peculiarity of being 
the only British members of the family FalconidcB that are feathered 
to the foot, I should be inclined, were I competent to be a systematist, 
to place the genus Buteo next to that of Pandion, that is before the 
true falcons, the hawks, and the kites, which now intervene.
But I 
rest quite content in knowing that those worthy of being looked up 
to as authorities have ordained otherwise, and I accept their decisions .

ON SOME CAUSES WHICH SEEM TO OPERATE IN THE 
PRODUCTION OF VARIETIES IN LEPIDOPTERA* 
By S.
L. Mosley.
Now that I have examined almost every large collection of lepidoptera 
in England, for the express purpose of picking out those which differ 
more or less from the normal type, it may not be out of place if I 
throw out a hint or two as to some of the causes which seem to 
me to operate in the production of these varieties.
The subject 
is as yet very obscure, and we require a great deal of facts and 
data before we can attempt to form any theory as to the uses or 
purposes of these variations.
Some of them may seem clear and 
certain both as to their use and the cause or causes which produced 
the variation, but we have yet a great deal to learn ; and it is only 
by each one telling what he knows — and only what he knows — that 
we can hope to arrive at any definite or satisfactory solution of the 
problem.
Some species of lepidoptera seem very constant, and we scarcely 
ever find anything differing from a given standard line in colour, or 
arrangement of pattern on the wings.
"Who, for instance, ever saw 
a var.
of any of the Sesidcs except the white-belted culiciformis ?
— 
always the same transparent wings, and bodies belted with either red 
or yellow ; or of any of the genus Procris ?
— always the same uniform 
brassy green ; or of any of the Litlioddce ?
Of course slight varieties 
have now and then occurred even in these, but as a general rule they 
are very constant, and anything approaching to a variety is very rare.
A great many of the Noctuce^ too, seem remarkably constant in their 
characters ; others, on the contrary, seem to have an almost ever- 
lasting change of colour or pattern : and I might give as instances 
two favourites of the variety -breeder, Ohelonia caja and Abraxas grossu-

Syhernia defoliaria, Gidaria immanata and russata^ Apamea

Some varieties seem to be influenced by latitudinal or altitudinal 
distribution : var.
Hospita and var.
Merope^ for instance, are con- 
sidered alpine forms, while the dark Polyodon, Duplaris, Occulta, and 
Orboiia are looked upon as northern forms, and vars.
Valezhia, and 
Dinie/isis- as southern forms.
Out of a list of 79 species of British macro-lepidoptera, which I 
made out as being subject to produce varieties, 37 had a tendency to 
vary from light to dark, while only 18 had the opposite tendency to 
vary from dark to light, and 24 had a tendency to vary in both 
directions.
Of the latter (those which varied in both directions) 14 
had a majority of specimens for the dark, five had a majority for the 
light, and five varied in both directions in about an equal degree.
Of those species Laving a tendency to produce varieties darker than 
the type, 24 had produced dark varieties which may be said to be 
persistent and for the most part named, while among the light varie- 
ties only 11 had become established.
Amongst the dark varieties, 
some, as Occulta., Duplaris, Belgiaria, Fuliginosa, &c., seem confined, if 
not to Scotland, to the northern portion of our island, which seems to 
go against the generally admitted rule that cold is productive of a 
bleached appearance ; hence some other cause must be assigned which 
acts stronger than the bleaching influence of the cold in these cases.
A striking instance is found in V.
urticce, where we find it in the 
south {Iclmma) lighter than the type, and in the north {Pylaris} 
darker than the type, but these are exceptions to the general rule 
which under our present state of knowledge we cannot account for.
MosLEY : On Causes peoducixg Variety in Lepidopteea.

All kinds of animals found within the arctic circle have a tendency 
to whiteness or uniformity of tint.
In insects, look at many of the 
arctic species of the genus CoUas ; as compared Tvith the more 
southern ones the tints are more sombre and more unifomily diffused 
over the wings — Nastes Boothii, &c.
; and though the dark Pobjodon, 
or the dark Occulta or 'Daplark from Scotland, may be darker than 
the same species from the south of England, yet the tint is more 
uniform, and may serve as much for a protection in the peat bogs as 
the whiteness of the ptarmigan or snow bunting does on the mountain 
top.
But it is curious, nevertheless, that a grt-at propurtiou of 
varieties are darker — and sometimes considerably darker — than the 
type.
Look, for instance, at the black variety of Betularia ; and the 
dark form of Biundularia in Delamere Forest.
It is strange, too, 
that at a certain place in Durham, many of the larvae of Grosm- 
lariata are black, or very nearly so.
I am not aware that this is the 
case in any other part of England, and I can at present only suppose 
that this is brought about by some process of natural selection, some 
enemy having taken a fancy to the larvse of Gromdariu.ta in this par- 
ticular district, and the blackness serving as a protection among the 
black stems of the currant-bushes ; and this view seems the more 
probable from the fact that the images in no way differ from the 
ordinary form, which might not have been the case if the variation 
had been due to meteorological or chemical causes.
It is said {Ent. x., 132) that dry and withered food has a tendency 
to produce small dark specimens, and that A.
betularia or A.
grossu- 
lariata^ when fed in this manner, becomes black in a few generations .
If this be the case, it may in some degree account for some of the 
dark varieties which predominate to such a degree over the light 
ones, both in a state of nature and in confinement.
In many cases I 
find that some particular variety was bred from the only larva 
collected.
Mr. Porritt has a very dark Quercus which was bred by a 
non-entomological relation of his, and might have been neglected and 
obliged to eat withered food ; it also remained in pupa two years 
before emerging.
I have only seen another specimen of this variety, 
which is in the British Museum.
There can be very little doubt that many varieties, or local races, 
are produced by natural selection, and the best instance I know of is 
Gnophos obsciirata.
This insect has the habit of settling on the 
ground like Belgiaria, and those individuals which difter most from 
the colour of the ground become the easiest prey to the birds ; hence 
on the black peat we find a very dark insect, while on the chalk thev 
56 
The Naturalist.
are pale, sometimes simply with only two dark lines running across 
the wings.
Between the chalk and the peat they are intermediate, 
and on the clay mud the insects are an ochreous mud colour.
The 
same takes j)lace in Thajiaos tages, and no doubt many other species, 
if properly examined, would be found to vary according to their 
particular habitat.
As a case of that kind I might mention Polia chi 
and the var.
olivacea^ the latter being found chiefly on the dark walls 
near the moor edges.
Yet there must in some cases be some other 
agent at work than that which we know as natural selection, for Mr.
Darwin has shown that the puj^a of P.
Nirem will assume the colour 
of almost anything to which it attaches itself ; and Miss Golding- 
Bird {Ent. xi., 108) tells us that the larvae of C.
nupta and Biston 
Jiirtaria are dark or light, according to their surroundings, even when 
kept in confinement, where no known process of natural selection 
could operate.
I have said that cold and shade have a tendency to produce dull, 
indistinctly coloured specimens ; we must therefore suppose that sun 
and warmth have the contrary effect of producing bright, distinct 
colours, and Mr. Bond told me of an instance which seems to bear 
out this theory remarkably well.
Mr. Bond obtained eggs from an 
ordinary female of SterrJia sacraria, and during the time he was 
carrying them through their transformations there was scarcely any 
sunshine at all — the dullest weather possible.
The previous year Mr.
McLachlan had obtained eggs from another ordinary female of the 
same species, and they were brought to maturity for him by the Eev.
E. Horton ; but during the time these were feeding up and coming 
to perfection the sun shone brilliantly almost every day.
These two 
lots did not differ two days from the time of the eggs being deposited 
to the time of the appearance of the first imago, yet Mr. Bond's were 
very dark, dull specimens, without the slightest tint of rosy, and Mr.
McLachlan's, with a single exception, were very bright with more 
than an average of rose tint.
Of course I do not say that in the one 
case the dull weather produced the dull specimens, or that in the 
other the bright sunshine produced the bright colours ; but the two 
cases are very suggestive, and harmonise very well with my ideas of 
light, heat, and colour.
That light has some influence on the colours of lepidoptera I think 
there can be little doubt.
Mr. Sidebothom {Sc. Gos., Dec, 1869) 
procured a large number of V.
urticcB when quite small and fed them 
up in three lots, one under blue light, one under yellow, and one 
under ordinary light.
" These reared in the blue light differed from 
MosLEY : On Causes producing Vatiiety in Lepidoptera.
57 
the ordinary form in being, on an average, much smaller ; the orange 
brown lighter in shade, and the yellow and orange run into each other 
instesd of being distinct and separate." " Those reared in the yellow 
light were also smaller, the orange brown replaced by a salmon color, 
the venation more strongly marked, and the blue dashes at the edge of 
the wings in the usual form were in these of a dull slaty color." The 
colours of butterflies which fly in the sunlight are more brilliant than 
those of the Geometr(S, which fly at dusk, and the Geometr(B are 
brighter-coloured than the night-flying Noctuce.
The sun-loving genus 
Fliisiais the most brilliant of all the Noctuce, and the hotter the climate 
the brighter the colour both of insects and birds.
Look at the gorgeous 
beauty of some of the Ornithopterce, and especially the Uranicd, which 
latter seem to me to be day-flying Geometers, though Newman states 
they are true butterflies of the " skipper " family.
The under side of 
butterflies, which is as much exposed as the upper side, is often quite 
as gaily coloured.
But there are some cases which seem to be excep- 
tions to this rule.
In the genus Catacola the under wings are brightly 
coloured, while the upper wings are simply sombre grey.
These 
insects rest by day on the trunks of trees, with the upper wings over- 
lapping the lower wings, and they fly in the night, so that the under 
wings do not come in contact with the sunshine at all, yet they are 
the brightest parts about these insects.
A similiar case occurs in 
the genus Tryphoena, where the under-wings are bright orange, 
though completely hidden during the day and only exposed during 
the night.
At present I am inclined to the belief that these may be 
lingering descendants of a day-loving and more brightly coloured 
race.
The genus Catacola is, in fact, only one degree removed from 
the Geometers, many of which fly during the day.
The genera Plusia, 
Brephos, and Gonoptera — all brightly coloured insects — belong to the 
same class.

Perching of the Redshank.
— In the Naturalist (vol.
V., page 10) 
Mr. Clarke observes in a note on the perching of the redshank on trees, 
that it is no uncommon sight on the continent to see this species, as well 
as others of this order, perched on trees.
In speaking of the non- 
observance of this habit in this country he correlates the fact with the 
absence of trees in their haunts.
From observations which I have made 
in this district I am certainly led to a different conclusion.

observed them alight, even once, on trees.
When the reservoir has been 
full I have several times seen them traverse its whole length in search of 
a suitable perching place.
A pair of sandpipers, however, which my 
brother and I saw in the Goit Stock Valley in the summer of 1876, and 
which were evidently breeding, perched on the lower branches of trees 
with great facility, bobbing their tails up and down as they flew from tree 
to tree, much after the manner of wagtails.
This idiosyncrasy cannot be 
explained, I think, on Mr. Clarke's theory, since the physical aspect — at 
least in its arboreal character — of the locality in the Goit Stock Valley 
differed in no material respect from Manywells.
Would it afford a 
sufficient eclaircissement of the matter to presume that the above birds 
were of continental extraction ?
Another instance I may cite, although 
belonging to another order of birds, without perhaps being thought 
irrelevant to the point at issue : A skylark's nest was built about 
half a mile from this village, near the old main road leading to Bradford : 
when the nest contained young I used to see one of the old birds (I think 
it was the female) frequently alight on the top of a high whitethorn 
hedge about forty or fifty yards from the nest.
This deviation from its 
usual habits was in no way connected with exceptional physical conditions ; 
within about ten yards from the nest was a wall which bounded the main 
road, yet it as frequently alighted on the hedge as on the old wall.
It 
is therefore, obviously not for lack of apparently suitable perching 
places that this abnormal habit can be accounted for.
Nevertheless I am 
free to confess that birds are by no means mere automata, impelled in all 
their movements by blind instinct, but in some of their actions there 
ajDpears to be indications of the faculty, if not of reason, at least of some- 
thing very near akin to it.

Dusky Petrel.
— I had a specimen of the dusky petrel {Pufinus 
ohscurus) brought to me to stuff on Friday evening last ; it is a male bird 
in splendid feather.
I think it as well to record this, as it is not in the 
"List of the Birds of Wakefield" as published in the Naturalist.

Great-crested Grebe, &c., near Goole.
— Three specimens of this 
bird have been shot on the Ouse during the last three weeks.
Mr.
Richardson reports the arrival of the redwing on the 1st inst.
; he saw 
the chiffchaff the preceding day, and, shortly before, three young water- 
rails and the parent bird.
He states it to be the first time during fifty 
years he has seen the young of the last-named bird.
I saw the house 
martin on the 12th, but have not observed it since.

Kite v.
Buzzard, — Those who have seen both the kite and^the buzzard 
can never mistake the one for the other, and I am inclined to think, from 
Mr. Butterfield's description, that Mr, Clarke is right.
I never saw the 
kite with a white head ; I have seen many with light-coloured heads, but 
they are always inclined to a reddish brown ; and the tail of the kite is 
so much longer than that of the buzzard, that in any position it cannot 
be mistaken for that of the latter.

The Pochard at Huddersfield.— On the 15th inst.
I had a fine 
specimen of the pochard (Fulignla ferina) brought to me, shot on Mr.
Day's dam, Almondbury Bank.
It is a male bird, in fine plumage.
In 
the evening of the same day I heard a flock of birds passing over, — 
evidently ducks, from the whistling of their wings.

ScARCROFT Birds.
— I always take a great interest in local lists of birds, 
but I am rather surprised at one or two remarks in Mr. Hay's Scarcroft 
list.
In all my long experience of birds I never saw the grey wagtail 
follow the plough in winter.
It is generally observed in some solitary 
place near a stream where leaves or other refuse have accumulated, but 
rarely in fields, unless where water runs down and rubbish has accumu- 
lated.
If we follow it to its breeding-place, we find that it loves some 
solitary glen where there is a waterfall, and where the golden saxifrage 
and other aquatic plants grow.
If disturbed, it always utters its plaintive 
note, "Twit, twit?" I often see the pied wagtail following the plough 
in winter, and its young are grey.
Mr. Hay also gives the blackcap 
warbler as common, and omits the garden warbler altogether, the latter 
being much the commoner of the two.
Early in July I spent a day in 
and about Roundhay Park, near Leeds, and I had the pleasure of hearing 
three garden warblers, but only one blackcap.
Their songs so much 
resemble each other, that they are often taken one for the other.
The 
song of the blackcap is more broken, and not continued so long as that 
of the garden warbler.

Crossbill and Turtle Dove Breeding near York.
— Though the 
crossbill retires to northern latitudes to breed, still there are a few 
instances on record of its staying, and nesting in England.
Every authentic 
instance should be recorded, as this bird may stay here more often than 
is generally thought, but on account of it nesting so early in spring, it 
has very rarely been noticed.
Mr. Widdas, whose name has been 
mentioned before in the pages of the Naturalist, found this bird's nest in 
a fir plantation, at Stockton-on-Forest, near York.
He and his friend 
were bird-nesting very early in spring, in the plantation, when Mr.
Widdas saw, as he thought, a greenfinch's nest built in a fir tree.
Immediately he began to ascend the tree, out flew a strange bird.
The 
nest contained four eggs, which Mr, Widdas was unable to identify at the 
time, but afterwards found to be those of the crossbill.
The nest, which 
CO 
The Naturalist.
was placed haK way up the tree, where a branch joined the trunk, was 
larger and of a flatter form than that of the greenfinch.
It consisted of 
a foundation of small twigs, lined with leaves, dried grass, and hair.
The 
eggs which are now in my collection, are larger than those of the green- 
finch.
There are two distinct varieties, leading one to suppose that they 
must be the produce of two different birds.
Two of the eggs are of a 
cream colour, thickly spotted especially towards the larger end with dark 
red and light grey.
I have also eggs of the turtle dove taken from a 
plantation at Acomb ; four nests were found within a short distance of 
each other.
The turtle dove's nest is seldom found so far north as York.

Abt^dance of Lithosia quadra in the New Forest.
— Larvae of 
LHhosia quadra actually swarmed in Matley Wood this season ; you 
could not walk without destroying numbers, and upwards of a hundred 
were counted on the trunk of a single tree.
Larvse of Cleora glabraria 
were also more abundant than I have ever before seen them ; and 
Eurymene dolabraria, Tephrosia consortaria, and T.
extersaria were 
tolerably abundant.
I have also Acronycta alni, and ninteen Stauropns 
fagi, the latter from the eggs.

Bulimus ohscurus var.
alba in Yorkshire.
— In the Naturalist, vol.
v., 
p. 22, Mr. H.
Pollard claims to be the first recorder of this shell in 
Yorkshire.
We are sorry to have to correct Mr. Pollard in this respect, 
but we feel quite sure that he will take the correction in the spirit in 
which it is given — namely, with all friendliness.
In looking over an old 
file of the first issue of the Naturalist, in vol.
iii.
(the last issued), page 
98, Nov., 1866, we find a note on some " Land and Fresh-water Molluscs 
collected at Knaresbro' and its vicinity by Mr. J.
Blackburn, of Leeds." 
In this list occurs the shell named, thus : — "26.
Bulimus obscurus var.
alba, Grimbald Crag, found by Mr. Beevers in my presence." Another 
shell in this list, also from Grimbald Crag, may be worth mentioning, as 
appended to it is this note : — "Mr. Jeffreys says it has not been found 
in Britain" : it is ^elix lapicida var.
albina.

Abnormal Plants.
— The past year has been very productive of 
botanical monstrosities, owing, no doubt, to the lateness of the season 
and to the great quantity of rain which has fallen.
I found one specimen 
of the common ribwort {Plantago lanceolata) in which each of the scapes 
bore three spikes.
The two outer ones were quite as large as those of the 
normal plant, but the inner one was very small, and apparently diseased.
In another specimen of the same plant, which is very liable to variation, 
the scape bore three leaves in the usual situation of the spike.
The Dutch 
clover {Trifolium repens).
— A curious abnormal condition of this plant has

been very frequent ; in this the petals and essential organs exhibited a 
tendency to return to the foliar state, many heads presenting, on a small 
scale, exact counterparts of the trifoliate leaves of the stem (see Science 
Gossip for Sept.
and Oct.) I have found the same plant (jT.
repens) in a 
viviparous condition.
A branched variety of Lolium perenne (ramosum,) 
has been frequent ; I found one specimen with six branches.
White 
flowered varieties have been not unfrequent.
The following is a list of 
those which I have observed : — Viola odorata, Campanula latifolia, C.
rotundifolia, C.
glomerata, Digitalis purpurea, Anagallis tenella : thus, 
purple, blue, or pink flowers appear to be the most liable to produce 
albino varieties.

CoREECTiON.
— In the account of Montagu's harrier breeding near York, 
in last month's number of the Naturalist, instead of " Lupton-on-Forest " 
read " Stockton-on-Forest." And instead of the nest being ''8ft." 
above the ground it should be " 2ft." The harrier's nest is seldom found 
3ft.

Note on a Correction (p.
43, Oct.).
— Permit me to say that TJlota 
intermedia, Schpr., is a moss of the Wetherby district, and that therefore 
the name in the Wetherby hst — which I assisted Mr. Wesley to draw 
up — is no error.
Ulota intermedia is one of the comparatively recent 
Schimperian segregates, and is the commonest species of the genus.
It 
was amongst the first examples, almost, of mosses gathered by Mr.
Wesley, who, early in 1878, sent me a tuft taken from off the bole of a 
young tree in some wood between Wetherby and Bramham, I believe, 
but the exact spot I do not know.
It was labelled OrthotrichumQ)" 
and I marked it crispum, and so thought it until later, when I found the 
same moss in woods near Market-Rasen, plentiful there on young ashes.
Mr. Boswell determined the species for me, and pointed out the differ- 
ences between it and crispum and Bruchii, with one or other of which it 
has doubtless been confused, since (I repeat) it is a more widely dis- 
tributed and commoner moss than either.
I inserted the name in Mr.
Wesley's list in place of TJ.
crispa, which I have not seen from the 
district.

Correction and Additions.
- The Atrichum tenellum reported for the 
Riccall meeting should have been A.
imdulatum.
The following algae 
were accidentally omitted from the Riccall list : — Peninm Brebissoni, 
Sphcerozosma vertebratum, and Gonium tranqnillum.
The Euastrum 
queried elegans is true elegans.
Barbula papillosa might be added to the 
Wetherby Hst of mosses, as I have gathered it between Kjiaresbro' and 
Wetherby.
To the list of algee of the Leeds district, pubhshed last 
month, may be added the following species : — Oscillatoria muscorum 
(Allerton), Penium Brebissoni (Riccall), Chcetophora tuberosa (York, 
Baildon, &c.), Campylodiscus costatus (Bingley), Euastrum elegans 
(Riccall), Cosmarium crenatum (Arncliffe), Tabellaria ventricosa (Adel), 
G2 
The Naturalist.
Oonium tranqiiill imi (Riccall), and Chroolepus aureiim, which is, according 
to the latest German authorities, classed with the algse.
It occurs on rocks, 
walls, and in quarries, near Bolton Woods, on all our N.
W. Yorkshire hills, 
and is abundant in the quarries near Wetherby, &c.
There are also 
above 40 more W.R. species in a list now going through the press, in the 
Transactions of the Yorkshire Naturalists' Union for 1878.
I may add 
that it is very instructive to compare the zygospores of the Cosmarinm 
with species of Pediastrum.

Barnsley Naturalists' Society.
— Meeting Oct. l(5th.
— The first of a 
series of paxiers arranged by the council to be delivered during the 
session, was read by Mr. A.
R. Kell, C.E., on crows, jays, flycatchers, 
and kingfishers, with choice and varied specimens of their eggs, and 
illustrations of the birds and their nests.
The botanical section had 
prepared a copious list of the flowers gathered during the last few weeks, 
mostly within a five-mile radius of Barnsley, and some from a distance.
The entomological and geological sections also gave in their reports ; 
some of their researches had been well rewarded.
In ornithology the 
observations are few, but not without interest.
The summer migrants 
noted are — swift Sept.
8th and 14th (a late stay) ; the willow warbler 
Sept.
20th.
(The latter bird sang a few days previously ; it is reported 
near Wakefield Sept.
25th.) The whinchat Sept.
26th ; Ray's wagtail 
27th.
The sand and house martin were also obeerved in numbers on 
that date over the Calder at Wakefield.

ON SOME CAUSES WHICH SEEM TO OPERATE IN THE 
PRODUCTION OF VARIETIES IN LEPIDOPTERA.
By S.
L. Mosley.
(Concluded.) 
One exciting cause in the production of varieties, no doubt, is the 
food-plant of the larvae, but entomologists make mistakes in supposing 
that wonderful results can be brought about by this means in a single 
generation.
Bomhyx quercus fed upon ivy, has a tendency to becofue 
destitute of scales ; bullfinches fed upon hemp seed become black, and 
primroses planted in cow-dung turn red.
Several closely allied species 
of moths might be referable to a change in the food-plant of the 
larvae.
Not that I wish to question their distinctness as species, but 
I think that a forced or accidental change in the food carried on from 
generation to generation might have been a means of bringing about 
their differences.
I may instance E.
linariata 2iTi^ jmlcliellaia^ Procris 
statiees and geryon ; and we seem to have something like proof in the 
case of E.
minutata and knaiitiata, for in the place where knautiata 
is taken they tell us that ling and minutata used to be found, and 
that the ling has since disappeared, and it seems probable that the 
insects were driven from the heather to the flowers of Knautia arvemis^ 
and that hiautiata is a species as good as some that I might mention, 
caused or greatly influenced by a change in the food of the larvee.
I 
grant that some experiments seem to show that food has no influence 
in the production of varieties.
For instance, Mr. Sidebotham 
{Sc. Gos., Dec, 1869) procured 2,500 larvae of C.
caja, and fed them 
in six different lots — one on willow, one on butter-burr, one on haw- 
thorn, one on plum, one on dock, and another on various kinds of low 
plants.
The result of this was, that " the variations in colour and 
markings were not to be traced in any case to the food." Another 
similar attempt is recorded (Ent. ix., 251) from France, in which 
5,000 larv^ of 0.
caja were obtained, and fed in different lots on 
walnut, horse chestnut, sumach, box, celandine, carrot, and lettuce, 
and some were reared in complete darkness.
But all this proved 
nothing further than that those fed upon lettuce were dull, discoloured 
specimens, which might have ended in something if lettuce had been 
continued for a few generations ; for we generally find that those 
insects which feed upon succulent plants ha\'ing a great deal of water 
in their tissues, or which frequent marshy land, are pale discoloured

The Naturalibt.
insects like the genus Leucania, Fieris, &c.
But, on the other hand, 
Mr. Cole is reported to have bred a series of Ennomos angularia, 
which differed slightly according as the larvag were fed upon oak, 
thorn, lime, or lilac.
It might be that in some cases a variety is 
caused by some disease or want of energy ; and it is worthy of note 
that many varieties either never leave the pupa case, or are crippled.
We frequently find plants single shoots of which are either variegated 
or completely white, and the cultivator has often taken advantage of 
this, and propagated the variation.
I have particularly noticed in the 
common dock that some portion of the leaves of some particular 
plant has been variegated with white or yellow, frequently divided in 
each leaf by the midrib, one half being green and the other half 
yellow.
The common cultivated geranium will often send out a 
branch upon which all the leaves are white ; and I know a gardener 
who has frequently cut these branches off and tried to grow them 
separately, but hitherto they have always withered and died, whereas 
if he had cut off an ordinary green branch, probably it would have 
grown without any hesitation — seeming to show that the white 
branch was diseased or had a want of energy.
This want of energy 
seems to be present in those insects which are unable to burst from 
the pupa case, or, having burst therefrom, are unable to expand their 
wings to maturity.
The two cases seem to be analogous, only with 
this difference — that when plants are diseased from what I call a want 
of energy, they generally assume a pale form, whereas many of the 
crippled varieties of insects are darker than the normal type.
In cases where the insects have bright red — as in the tigers and 
burnets — the red has a tendency to become yellow ; and Mr. Bond 
pointed out to me that the yellows (as in Flantaginis^ have a 
tendency to become red.
But this is by no means universal, and in 
the few cases we know of, might it not be that the insects were 
originally red, and the cases of red variation we see now are cases of 
reversion to the original stock ?
I think there are more cases of 
reversion than we are at present led to suppose.
Halia wavaria is a 
tolerably constant insect, but now and then we see one of a uniform 
dark slaty brown.
Cahera pusaria, another constant species, occa- 
sionally comes out a dark leaden colour, and if these be simply 
" sports," it seems strange that they should be all exactly the same.
A. cardamines I have seen with the ground of all the wings yellow, 
which seems like a reversion to some of the yellow species of Antlio- 
charis found on the Continent.
A specimen of C.
caja in Mr. Sydney 
Webb's collection, in the appearance of the under wings seems to

approach C.
Eebe, and an Ado7iis in Mr. Weston's cabinet is shot with 
copper on the under side of the same colour as that on the upper side 
of P.
pfilceas.
Argynnis Euphrosyne seems to have a tendency to 
become black at the base of the wings, and in this respect approaching 
to A.
Frieja^ Thunb., and many other cases could be cited where one 
insect seems to approach the form of another, and generally one that 
bears some close relationship to it.
There is another variation to which some insects seem particularly 
liable, to which I have not yet called attention, and that is the 
bleached appearance frequently seen in 8atyrus Janira^ often in the 
form of round spots, and often corresponding on the two sides.
I 
have seen what appears to have been brought about by a similar 
cause in S.
Tithonus, F.
piniaria, S, ^geria, and I think also in Erehia 
Blandim.
I also know of three specimens of Chelonia caja, (Sydney 
Webb, C.
S. Gregson, and F.
Bond) in which the brown on the upper 
wings is nearly bleached away, the red on the lower wings changed 
to a pink, and the usual black spots a pale drab.
One underwing of 
a male ;S^.
carpini in the late Mr. Owen's collection is the same, and 
such thing occurs also in the burnets.
In the case of Janira, Mr.
Gregson suggested that it might be caused by an old bottle or a dew- 
drop focussing the rays of light upon the pupae, which in this species 
are exposed ; and this idea seems strengthened when he told m.e that 
such Caja as the ones referred to above could be produced by the 
pupse being long exposed to the sun.
In the case of greenhouse 
plants, too, we frequently find that camellias, &c., are often scorched 
and discoloured by a speck in the glass focussing the rays strongly on 
one particular leaf, and the gardener has to put a dab of paint over 
the speck to stop the rays.
After emergence, too strong light 
destroys some colours in lepidoptera, and for some time I thought 
that this was the true explanation of the bleached appearance in 
Janira.
But if the spots were caused by focussing of the light, it 
would only touch on one part of the pupa, and could not be thrown 
on two sides corresponding exactly as they frequently do.
It seems 
to me, in tliis case, that the bleaching more probably is caused by 
fluid touching the two wings when they are hanging to dry.
In the 
case of F.
piniaria the bleaching is confined to one side, and in all 
cases except Janira to the margin of the wings.
It is noteworthy that in lepidoptera we never find an albino.
In 
the vertebrate animals, and especially in the birds, albinos are of 
frequent occurrence ; in fact birds do vary generally in colour, 
seldom in position of marking.
But in all the hundreds of varieties of 
68 
The Naturalist.
lepidoptera which have come under my notice, I have not seen one 
albino, using that term in the same sense in which we use it in the 
vertebrate animals.
The nearest approach is a white Grossulariata in 
Mr. Gregson's collection, and that is only white because of the 
absence of the usual black spots, the white is extended and the black 
diminished, and the white is not substituted for some other colour as 
is the case in true albinos.
It has been suggested that carbon in the form of smoke, &c., does 
its share in the production of melanic varieties by being taken in 
along with the food plant of the larvse, and this is not improbable in 
some cases, as some of the dark varieties like the black Betularia 
in manufacturing districts, and the dark Biundularia in Delamere 
Forest, are near to large smoky towns, and others like the dark forms 
we get from Scotland are near or on the peat bogs where carbon 
exists in another form.
Still, I think, all dark varieties cannot be 
referred to this cause, as, for instance, the dark Paphia in the New 
Forest.
Some insects are subject to suffusion, as in Edusa and Hyale, 
where the black border is sometimes suffused as far as the central 
spot, and Mr. Edwards, the American entomologist, thinks that this 
is often caused by long subjection of the pupse to severe cold ; and 
from my experience of the past year there seems to be something 
in this.
Last winter, as most of us well know, was very severe — not 
only cold, but cold continued for a very long time, and the season 
(which should have been summer) which followed was remarkable for 
the quantity of varieties it produced.
But as yet we cannot tell what is the " exciting cause " in the 
production of some of those extraordinary freaks which we sometimes 
see, like a Gaja in Mr. Webb's collection, one side of which is quite 
ordinary and the other side almost uniform dark brown.
But, as I 
said at the commencement, we want each one to record the results 
of his observations in this line.

OCCURRENCE OF THE FULMAR PETREL IN YORKSHIRE.
By J.
H. GuRNEY, JuN., F.Z.S.
Mr. Clarke may be glad of a memoranduin of a Fulmar Petrel, 
received in October 1868, from Flamborough Head.
It was caught 
with a boathook by a fisherman, who has since been drowned — a 
circumstance which invests it with a melancholy interest.
When held up by one leg by the friend from whom I received it, it 
discharged above a wineglass-full of oil — not from the mouth, as I 
should have expected, but from its nostrils.
I gave this bird to Mr.
Gould, and he honored it by figuring it in his work on British Birds.
It has only once happened to me to see the Fulmar petrel alive, 
and that was in the English Channel ; but I once— in June, 1869 — 
picked up a dead one on the shore.
It was exactly opposite Saltburn.
I had been taking a stroll, when my attention was caught by some of 
its feathers borne towards me by the wind.
A hundred yards on lay 
the ptti\il.
It was so covered with sand, it had been so remorselessly 
tossed about by the breakers, and its plumage was so soaked, that I 
despaired of ever being able to skin it : but after careful drying it 
turned out a much better specimen than could have been expected.
This 
bird was blind of one eye; perhaps it was because it could not see what 
it was eating that I found in its gizzard a small portion of a newspaper.
It must have been a remarkably literary bird to take that on purpose.
Besides these, I have had eleven Fulmar petrels, principally York- 
shire specimens, and I must say that not in any bird have I seen 
greater variation in size of beak and in weight.
The biggest pulled 
the scale down at 26oz., while the smallest weighed only 14oz.
This 
is a discrepancy more than sufficient for a species-monger to coin a 
new species out of ; but of course much depends on the condition the 
birds are in.
The majority obtained in England are diseased, the 
healthy ones keep out to sea, and the weak are blown in by gales 
which they have not strength left to contend against.
If the snow- 
white head and neck be the sign of the adult plumage, as is generally 
supposed, my oldest example had the smallest beak.
I hope that Mr. Clarke will make a thorough work of his " Birds 
of Y'orkshire." When so many counties have had excellent ornitho- 
logies written of them, and Norfolk in particular has had a work to 
be proud of, though not yet completed, it does seem very remarkable 
that no one should have come forward to do the same for the largest 
county in England ; and I hope Mr. Clarke will receive all the 
assistance he deserves in his efi'orts.

Additiox-s to List or Scap.croft Bieds.
— Garden warbler {Carruca 
hoi-tensis) breeds and is well distributed over the tovmsiiip.
The tree 
sparrow (Passer rnoydanus) also breeds freely in the district.
It is often 
confounded with the house sparrow, from which it may be distinguished 
by the chestnut-coloured cruwn of head.
In my previous list I remarked 
that the grey wagtail follows the plough ; that is a clerical error.
The 
remark about the grey wagtail ought to be tacked on the preceding bird.
I should have corrected the error before 'Mr. Vai'ley pointed it out, but 
in the pressure of business it was overlooked.

— A friend of 
mine gave me the other day a magnificent specimen of a light-coloui^ed 
Greenland falcon {Falco candican.s).
shot at Eagle Island, north-west 
coast of Donegal by Mr.

— On Oct. 18th last some 
boys caught a Manx sheairwater (Pv.ffinus anglorum) , in an exhausted 
state, at Long-lane, Dalton, Huddersfield.
The same day my son called 
my attention to a flock of gulls passing over ; and whilst we wxre v>-atching 
them, a flock of I should say fifty wagtails passed over.

Richardson's Skua at Wakefield and Norland Moor.
— On the 
morning of the 18th Oct.
, Mr. Wm.
Talbot, of Wakefield, brought in a 
fine specimen of Richardson's skua {Lestris Richardsonii), which had been 
shot on the 15th inst.
at Wakefield.
The following week I went to see my 
friend Mr. John Gibson at Sowerby Bridge, who showed me a specimen 
of the same bird which had been shot on Norland Moor also on the 15th 
inst.
— James Varley.
Great-crested Grebe and Kittiwakb at Wakefield.
— Mr. WilHam 
Talbot showed me a great-crested grebe (Podiceps cristatus), in immature 
female dress : also a kittiwake {Larus tridactylus), both killed at Wake- 
field this autumn.
— J ames Varley.
Little Grebe and Water Rail near Huddersfield.
— My friend Mr.
Morley, of Skelmanthorpe, has brought me two birds for identification.
One of them is the little grebe {Podiceps minor), the other the water-rail 
(Rallus aquaticiis).
The former was killed by flying against the telegraph 
wires, the water-rail by flying against a long chimney.
— James Varley.
Common Bunting (Emheriza miliaria).
— I received for preservation 
a very pretty fawn-coloured variety of this bird, shot in the north of 
Scotland last week.

— Three swallows were daily on the wing in the Rybum 
valley, during the last week in October.
I saw one on November 1st, 
but none after.

Correction.
— Dusky Petrel.
— The bird I announced as the dusky 
petrel turns out, according to the decision of Mr. J.
E. Harting and Mr.
Sharpe (head of the ornithological department of the British Museum), to 
be the Manx shearwater, although it difiers very considerably from the 
description given in Yarrell.
Prof.
Newton informs me the description of 
the petrel given in many books is very imperfect : hence the difficulty of 
determining the species to which a specimen belongs.
He knows of 
another case in which the Manx shearwater was announced as the dusky 
petrel.

REVIEW.— The Young NaturaHst." London: Bower Bros., 146, 
Walworth-road, S.E. Edited by S.
L. Mosley and J.
E. Robson.— 
Nos. I, II, and III.
— This new venture, as its name implies, and as the 
opening address tells us, "is to cultivate a taste for Natural History 
among the young." We trust, and moreover have every confidence, that 
it will succeed in so good an object.
Both editors are well known as good 
naturalists.
The articles thus far are well chosen, for though in the first 
two numbers we were inclined to think entomology received rather too 
large a share of attention in a general magazine, it is altered in No. III.
It appears weekly (every Saturday) in eight-page numbers, published at 
Id., and is consequently within reach of the pocket of every schoolboy.
Besides being printed in clear type, it is profusely illustrated ; and 
although we notice several slight errors, chiefly printers', there are not 
Reports of Societies.

more than we should expect in a first attempt, and no donbt they will 
rapidly disappear as further experience is gained.
Altogether we con- 
gratulate the editors on the result, and wish them every success.
Obituary — Noah GtREEning.
— We regret to have to record the death, 
from ulceration of the lungs, of this well-known lepidopterist, which 
event took place on November 13th, at Douglas, in the Isle of Man.
Mr. Greening was highly esteemed by entomologists all over the country, 
but was perhaps best known by those of Lancashire and Yorkshire.
His 
collection of British lepidoptera was one of the largest and best ever 
formed ; but at present its destination seems uncertain.
Barnsley Naturalists' Society.
— An interesting lecture was delivered 
by Dr. W.
J. Lancaster, entitled " Notes on a Ramble in North Wales," 
on Oct. 28th, illustrated by specimens of minerals and plants, aided by 
stereoscopic views.
The third lecture was given by Mr Geo. Milner 
Nov. 11th, on "Mineralogy," illustrated by minerals and coloured plates.
The botanical section reported 250 plants observed in this district during 
the present unfavourable season.
The ornithological division reported a 
few occurrences.
Few song-birds were heard.
Larks, which had almost 
disappeared since midsummer, heard by Mr. Lister in song Sept.
29th.
The chiff-chaff sang at Denby Oct. 21st ; starlings sang in chorus October 
25th, yellow-hammer 27th ; on same day 26 pochards, 2 terns, and 130 
lapwings were noted in Walton Park.
Richardson's skua was obtained 
near Wakefield on the I7th.
Many wild geese^ ducks, &c.
, passed over 
or settled on the pools near Barnsley ; also golden plover, in company 
with the green plover, in numbers.

Bradford Naturalists' Society.
— Meeting October 28th, under the 
presidency of Mr. Jagger.
— Mr. Hebblethwaite, chairman of the Bradford 
Floricultural and Horticultural Society, gave a lecture on ^' Window 
Gardening, and the Cultivation of Bulbous Plants." His remarks were 
based on the results of long experience in the cultivation of plants best 
adapted for windows, and of bulbous plants for outdoors.
Amongst the 
former he included the Dracena, Egyptian lily, Dielytra spectabilis, Ficus, 
Azalea, Spirea, Fuschia, and Geranium, &c.
; and amongst the latter, the 
narcissus, squill, snowdrop, crocus, &c.
He gave all the information 
necessary for their successful cultivation, and showed how, by strict care 
and attention, the choicest flowers may be grown in the centre of the 
town, notwithstanding the presence of gas and smoke.
Mr. Hebble- 
thwaite, in the course of his remarks, complained that architects, in pre- 
paring plans for the erection of houses — and especially was this the case 
in Bradford — neglected to provide that space which was necessary for 
the cultivation of plants.
He thought this was to be regretted, for the

presence of blooming plants in the homes of the working classes had a 
very pleasing and cheerful effect^ besides adding to the health and com- 
fort of the inmates.
The lecture contained many useful and practical 
hints, and was warmly received by a large and enthusiastic audience.
— 
A number of local insects were at the same meeting shown by Messrs.
lUingworth, Saville, and Carter.
HuDDERSFiELD SCIENTIFIC Club, Mr. S.
L. Mosley, vice-president, in 
the chair.
— Mr. G.
T. Porritt exhibited a very beautiful almost black 
variety of Folia flavocincta, taken at sugar on the night of Sept.
I7th ; 
also a hermaphrodite specimen of Acronycta menyanthidis, taken on 
Baildon Moor, near Shipley, by Mr. J.
W. Carter of Bradford ; Mr. S.
D. 
Bairstow showed a rat with a tanned hide, found, along with a cat in a 
similar condition, in an old building at Stratford-on-Avon, and which 
must have lain there many hundreds of years ; also various ichneumons 
showing different styles of setting.
The specimens included Pimpla, 
detrita, an undescribed Vlophos bred from Coleophora vibricella by Mr.
Porritt, Lisonota impressa (?) from Smerinthus ocellatus, Microgaster 
dilutas from Liparis auriflua, and Cryptus viduatorius ; also a pale variety 
of Abraxas grossulariata from Rock Ferry.
The Leeds Naturalists' Club and Scientific Association.
—358th 
meeting, Oct. 28th, Mr. Benj.
Holgate, F.G.S., vice-president, in the 
chair.
— The chairman exhibited fossils from the Baygill quarries, Lothers- 
dale, near Skipton.
By means of diagrams he showed the position of 
this remarkable deposit of remains of various extinct mammalia.
Mr.
Walter Paine showed a long-eared bat {Plecotus auritus) from Pyther.
Mr. W.
Howgate, the stormy petrel {Thalassidroma pelagica) ; also the 
skeleton of that bird, and for comparison, foot of albatross.
Mr. Chas.
Smethurst, Metrocampa margaritata from Moseley Wood, Horsforth ; 
Epione apiciaria, bred from Bishop's Wood larvse ; Nonagria fnlva from 
Bishop's Wood ; and some interesting varieties of Chelonia caja and other 
lepidoptera.
The microscopical exhibits included circulation in branchial 
tufts of young newt, leaves of Scapania, spores of Pellia, sections of frond 
of Marchantia, of receptacle of same, and plants of Riccia natans and 
Selaginella stolonifera (stained), shown by Mr. W .
Barwell Turner, F.
C. S.
; 
and lichens from Howden, spores of Achlya on fly's wing, Vorticelloi, 
diatoms, Floscularice, &c., from the canal at Leeds, by Mr. S.
Emsley, 
in whose hands a fluid containing creosote and alcohol seems to have been 
used successfully, many delicate objects having been mounted in it by 
him.
359th Meeting, Nov. 4th, Mr. C.
Smethurst, president of the Entomo- 
logical Section, in the chair.
— The election of officers for 1880 for the 
Entomological Section resulted as follows : — Mr. Henry Lupton, presi- 
dent ; Pev. M.
S. Dunbar, M.A., vice-president ; and Mr. Alfred Denny, 
secretary.
Numerous local insects were shown, as Sirex gigas from 
Masham and Leeds, Cynthia cardui from Masham, &c.
Mr. Henry 
Reports of Societies.
79 
Ibbotson of York, who was present as a visitor, showed a large variety of 
rare and local plants.
Numerous microscopical exhibits were made by 
Messrs.
Washington Teasdale, W.
Barwell Turner, F.C.S., and F.
Emsley, 
360th Meeting, Nov. 11th, Mr. W.
Barwell Turner, F.C.S., president 
of the Microscopical Section, who occupied the chair, was unanimously 
re-elected for the year 1880.
The Botanical Section also re-elected their 
president, Mr. James Abbott, and for secretaries, Messrs.
J. R.
Murdoch 
and Percy Alexander.
The exhibits were very numerous, and included 
two very ingenious "live-boxes," by Mr. J.
W. Dixon ; MoUer's " Typen- 
platte," Gyrosigma angulatum, G.
formosum, G.
hippocampus, and G.
Balticum, by Mr. Edward Thompson ; and insects by Mr. F.
Emsley.
Mr. Abbott showed Sphmroplea annulina, a morphological slide of Volvox 
glohator, Biccia glauca in fructification, and a series of beautiful stained 
preparations of the cockroach {Blatta orientalis).
From these is shown 
that the hairs on the antense pass through holes in the chitinous coats of 
those organs, and proceed directly from the nerve-tissue beneath, thus 
showing that the antennae are tactile organs.
Messrs.
W. Barwell 
Turner, F.C.S., and W.
E. Clarke, who are working at bird-parasites 
together, showed Docophorus variabilis, parasitic on the dunlin, Nirmus 
fuscus from the hen harrier, and also a Docophorus from the gray plover 
{Squatarola helvetica), which is not described in Denny's " Moncgraphia 
Anoplurorum Britannica " as infesting that bird.
Mr. Turner further 
showed the diatoms Actinocyclus Ralfsii, G&phyrea incnrvata, and Craspe- 
dodiscus pyxidicula.
Mr. J ames Fogg exhibited fresh-killed specimens of 
the gannet and great black-backed gull (immature), killed on the York- 
shire coast.

Whitehead, president, in the chair, — The following interesting and locally 
rare mosses were exhibited by the president : — Eurhynchium pumilum 
from Stirrup Wood, Derbyshire ; Gymnostomum squarrosnm from Hatters- 
ley, Cheshire ; and fine fruiting specimens of Climacium dendroides from 
near Stirrup Wood ; also the two locally rare hepaticse, Ptilidium ciliare 
and Mastigobrynm trilobatum, from Charlesworth Coombs, Derbyshire.
Mr. Holt exhibited Barhula marginata from Ashley Mill ; Pogonatum 
nannm from Halebarns ; and Dicranella Schreheri from near Rochdale — 
all of them rare in the Manchester district.
Mr. W.
H. Pearson, vice- 
president, mentioned that he had received from Mr. B.
M. Watkins, of 
Ross, specimens of a Biccia which he had determined as Biccia tumida 
(Lindenberg) ; it was collected within the past few months about ten 
miles from the other recorded Herefordshire station, where it was pre- 
viously collected with Biccia sorocarpa (Bis.) also by Mr. Watkins.
The 
other stations are Cardiganshire (Wm. Joshua), Barmouth (T.
Rogers 
and W.
H. Pearson).
Mr. Pearson also read a short note, translated 
from the Swedish by his friend Herr Zolier, on Andraa Rothii, by Prof.
Lindberg, who pointed out that in Scandinavia three species had been

confounded under this name.
In the first place there is the real A .
Rothii, 
which grows at or near to the sea coast, and has its leaf formed of from 
two to three cell layers ; second, A.
falcata, which is peculiar to the 
mountainous passes, and which varies considerably, especially as regards 
the leaf margin ; the third is A.
ohtusifolia, previously recorded from 
Greenland : it has been found by the Professor in Pitea, Lapland.
The 
honorary secretary intimated that the Society's soiree had been fixed for 
the 20th Dec, and also read a communication from the secretary of the 
Poyal Microscopical Society, pointing out that the council had recently 
passed a new rule admitting the president as an ex-officio Fellow of their 
Society, and also granting the privilege of receiving a copy of their 
J oumal for the Society's use.

the egg ; the living larva of Noctna rhomhoidea, sent to him by Mis~ 
Golding Bird, and taken by that lady in the New Forest ; also a fin 
series of Cnephasia cindana and Pterophorns spilodadylus, the latter 
species bred.
The hon.
secretary made the following ofier to the mem- 
bers, viz : — That during the months of November, December, January, 
and February he would be at home every first and third Monday to those 
members and friends who would like to inspect his collection, compare

BUYOLOGICAL NOTES.— NEW BKITISH SPECIES.
By Rev. J.
Fergusson.
Some time ago I received from Mr. Wkitehead, of Dukinfield, a Bryum 
found by him on loose earth among limestone rocks, near Litton, in 
June last.
The quantity gathered was very small, as is almost 
invariably the case with a species picked up for the first time by a 
collector, or unknown as a native of the district or county in which he 
resides.
Moreover the capsules, though perfectly formed, had not 
reached the very point of ripeness which is so desirable when careful 
dissections of the Gladodium group of Bryum have to be made.
The 
aspect of the plant is peculiar ; the seta in any case is not more than 
seven lines in length, is suddenly bent downward at the summit, and 
then curves inward, so that the capsule lies on its back looking upward.
Any one who turns to the figure of the left-hand capsule of Zieria 
demissa as given in the " Bryotogia Britannica,^' and supposes the loop 
formed by the seta and capsule to be constricted to half its size and 
the capsule raised proportionally, will have a very fair idea of the 
appearance of the seta and capsule of Mr. Whitehead's plant.
Tufts 
of other Brya, such as B.
inclinatum^ occasionally present a capsule 
here and there turned in the same manner, but with them this is the 
rather rare exception.
Here it is the rule without any exception.
At 
first I supposed the plant to be a new species, and I still hold this 
supposition to be worthy of careful consideration, though I now lean 
more to the opinion that the plant may finally have to subside into a 
variety of B.
arciicum.
It seems to difi'er from B.
arciicum in having 
the leaves twisted when dry, in their narrower border, in the rather 
bladdery capsule not at all constricted below the mouth, w^hich is 
extremely small and not oblique, in the short seta, in the smaller, and, 
so far as I can judge, smooth spores.
These are all, it must be 
confessed, fine distinctions — and distinctions which might not prove 
constant if more numerous specimens were subjected to examination.
Until these are secured it may suffice to call special attention to the 
plant, a description of which is appended to these notes, under the 
name of Bryum rufum.
During the past year I have been favoured by Professor Barker 
with a fine collection of Grimmicd gathered by him during various 
rambles through Scotland, England, and Ireland.
In this collection 
there are some specifes of great rarity, and one with the first fruit 
which has been observed in this country.
I was greatly delighted to

The NA.TUEALIST.
notice in it a plant which I at once recognised as Coscinodon cribrosus, 
the G.
pulvinatus of Sprengel and of modern authors — an immensely 
interesting addition to our British list.
For some years I had been 
expecting that this species (whose geographical position ranges from 
mid-N"orv/ay to South Italy, and from the Pyrenees to the Tyrol 
Mountains) should some day be discovered in Britain ; but I had 
fancied that it would have been reported from our Scottish mountains 
rather than from the English Coniston, where Prof.
Barker found it 
in April, 1867.
In connexion with this announcement of its occur- 
rence in Britain it may be allowable to make one or two statements 
about its early history.
It was first gathered by Persoon, near Goslar, in Hercynia, and 
named Grimmia crihrosa by Hedwig in his great work " Descriptio et 
Adumbratio Muscorum Frondosorum,'^ published in the years 1787-97.
In 1804 Sprengel removed it from the genus Grimmia to Coscinodon, 
a genus specially created for its reception, and essentially characterised 
by the remarkably cribrose condition of the peristome.
When placing 
it in this genus he substituted the new specific name of pulvinatus for 
the earlier name given by Hedwig — a proceeding not permissible in 
the circumstances — and thus Grimmia cribrosa, Hedw., became Cosci- 
nodon pulvinatus, Sprengel.
The " Bryologia Europcea " and most 
modern authors have adopted the latter name in its entirety, but 
Spruce, C.
Miiller, and De Notaris, while recognising the necessity of 
the generic change, have rightly adhered to the original specific name 
given to the plant by Hedwig.
A description of this interesting species 
is appended.

NOTE ON THE ANTIQUITY OF SOME SPECIES 
OF MUSCL 
By 0.
P. HoBKiRK, F.L.S.
Prof.
Bayley Balfour, of Glasgow, recently sent to me for deter- 
mination a small tuft of a moss, whicli possesses very considerable 
interest to the botanist, the archaeologist, and the geologist alike, and 
on which, with some others presently to be mentioned, I propose to 
offer a few notes.
Dr. Munro, of Kilmarnock, has been exploring one of the old 
" crannogs," or lake dwellings at Lochlee, near Kilmarnock, and in 
the course of his investigations has found in it a number of tree 
trunks of various species, such as oak, elm, birch, &c., and some 
relics of its human occupation.
A full account of his discoveries will 
be published by Dr. Munro in the Proceedings of the Society of 
Antiquaries of Scotland.
Amongst the other relics found are a 
number of tufts of the moss just named.
This is in a very brittle 
state, much pressed and matted together, broken and semi-carbonised, 
but "still sufficiently well preserved for identification.
On examination 
it proves to be Hylocomium splendens.
Some fringes and a girdle made 
of the stems of PolytricJium commune, plaited, were also among the 
relics.
Through the kindness of Dr. Munro I have received specimens 
of this moss and another for examination.
The JPolytricJium is well 
preserved, and is quite a characteristic specimen, not so much broken 
as the Hylocomium, but if anything blacker, and more carbonised.
It 
shows, however, distinctly the white margin and teeth of the leaf, 
which are quite brown under the microscope, as is also the hyaline 
portion of the base ; and the lamellae of the centre of the leaf may be 
distinctly recognised.
The third moss is almost denuded of leaves, 
and consequently it is difficult, if not impossible, to recognise it.
So far as I have examined it under the microscope I can find only 
the leaf attachments and the torn bases attached to the stem, which is 
some five or six inches long, rather rigid, shows signs of having been, 
more or less branched, and looks at first sight not unlike a number 
of stems of Hypnum stramineum or admieum.
Amongst these stems, 
in the form almost of " microscopic dust," is a quantity of debris of 
leaves, &c.
On examining these I am disposed to think that many 
fragments of tips and bases of leaves have belonged to Eurynchium 
prcelongum, but whether they belong to the stems is doubtful : I 
scarcely think so.
Another longer and narrow fragment looks very 
like a leaf of a Campylopus, whilst several fragments show distinctly 
the peculiar cell structure of Sphagnum, the spiral thread being 
HoBKiRK : The Antiquity of some Species of Mtsci.
85 
distinctly visible.
Another scrap shows plainly one leaf and part of 
another of Lepidozia reptam, whilst mixed up with the smaller dust 
are numerous diatoms, chiefly I think Navicula.
The chief interest of these specimens centres in the question of the 
antiquity of the Lochlee crannog, on which I am not in a position to 
decide ; but knowing generally the horizon of these structures, we 
are safe in considering that they have been there buried a goodly 
number of centuries.
They have evidently been so long buried as to 
have undergone the first stages, at any rate, of fossilization, and they 
are the most ancient specimens of mosses that have come under my 
cognisance.
For many years I have been hankering after a fossil 
moss, but have as yet come no nearer than these.
I have seen 
specimens so labelled from Burntisland which are not mosses at all — 
with which conclusion, by the way, Prof.
Williamson, F.R.S., 
entirely agrees, and there can be no better authority on those beds, — 
and 1 have seen specimens from the " Halifax hard bed," in the coal 
measures, but these j are also more than doubtful.
I have seen 
specimens from other localities as well, but to all such I must append 
the same verdict.
It would be interesting to be informed whether any undoubted 
specimens have been found in similar localities or in other formations, 
either in this or other countries ; and if so, what they are.
I have 
seen various lists drawn up by Prof.
Heer of the cryptogamic plants 
from various localities, and from older deposits than the one above 
named, but in none of them have I seen any mention of mosses or 
their allies.
Can any one supply information on this subject ?

NOTES ON SOME VAKIETIES OF BIRDS.
By Alfred Beaumont, 
At the request of the editors, I have much pleasure in laying before 
the readers of the Naturalist a few stray notes and remarks on some 
of the varieties of birds, of which specimens are in my own collection.
Beaumont : Notes on some Varieties of Birds.
89 
I have for some years past made it a point to look out for variations 
— with what success will appear from the sequel ; and though the list 
appended does not by any means comprise the whole of the varieties 
in my possession, yet it will give a fair idea of some of the principal 
variations from type which have fallen into my hands at one time or 
other.
It will be remarked that I have not, in all cases, given 
the locality where the bird was shot, nor yet the date of its capture, 
for this reason : where there is any doubt about either of these points 
I think it to be the best course to pursue, to withhold even the 
supposed localities, rather than, by giving them, to mislead any one.
With these few prefatory remarks, I at once proceed to indicate 
a few of the varieties in my possession, and, as shortly as possible, to 
point out their chief divergences from the types.
Fieldfare — Turdus pilaris.
— This specimen was shot at Hornby 
Castle, near Bedale, by Mr. Savage, the gamekeeper, and was given 
to me by him.
It is a beautiful specimen, and may be described 
as a peculiar light variety, with white wings and a light-coloured 
head.
Eedwing — Turdus iliacus.
— This again is an exceedingly light variety, 
and was received from Mr. Williams, of Dame-street, Dublin.
There can be no question as to the identity of the species, as it 
possesses distinctly the characteristic mark behind the eye.
The 
throat, breast, and tail are beautifully mottled with light tawny 
and white, the wing coverts being pale tawny.
EiNG Ouzel — Turdus torquatus.
— Is generally of the ordinary type, 
except the neck, which is spangled with white.
Furze or Whin-chat — Sylvia ruhetra.
— This is a white variety.
Snow Bunting — Emheriza nivalis, — This is a beautiful variety, having 
the throat and breast pure white, and an entirely black back.
Chaffinch — Fringilla ccelebs.
— Differs from the type in having the 
wings, back, and tail white.
Greenfinch — Coccothraustes cJiloris.
— An Irish specimen : is of a 
very pale yellow colour, with an olive tinge.
Starling — Sturnus vulgaris.
— This bird has the breast of the normal 
colours, the true spangle of the starling, whilst the head, back, and 
wings are buff-coloured.
EooK — Corvus frugilegus.
— The whole of the plumage of this specimen 
is of a light brown colour, with the upper part of the wings 
exceedingly pale.
90 
The Naturalist.
Magpie — Corms pica.
— Specimen shot at Woolley Hall, near Barns- 
ley.
In place of the normal black colour it is of a dirty white.
EiNGDOVE — Columba palumbtis.
— This is a very beautiful specimen, of 
a pure whits all over.
Red Grouse — Tetrao scoticus {Lagopus).
— Two specimens, male and 
female, shot on the Duke of Devonshire's estate, above Halifax.
The hen shot on the 12th August is of a pale buff colour ; the cock 
(shot a few weeks later), of a light dun colour.
Another specimen, 
shot on Slaithwaite moor, and presented to me by the late John 
Horsfall, Esq., has a light brown body, with dun or ashen-coloured 
wing coverts and tail.
Partridge — Perdix cinerea.
— I have four varieties of this bird : one, 
a dark, small variety, the ordinary form of our locality on the moor 
edges ; another, a light variety of unusually large size, from the 
North Riding ; the third, an albino shot near Doncaster ; the 
fourth is of the normal colouring, with white wings and partially 
white breast.

NOTES ON BIRDS OBSERVED IN DUTCH BRABANT.
By Wm. Eagle Clarke.
May 5th to 19th, 1879.
The following observations were made during an oological trip in 
south-eastern Holland in tbe month of May last ; and although not 
British, I venture to think they will be both interesting and useful 
to ornithologists, inasmuch as in every instance the species enume- 
rated occupies a place in the British, and (with one or two exceptions) 
the Yorkshire, list.
I have thought it desirable to give the notes under the head of the 
various species, deeming this to be the best and most concise form.
The list thus given should afford a fair idea of the ornithology of the 
district, there being four of us, and ornithology received our undivided 
attention during a fortnight's sojourn.
Leaving Leeds on the morning of Monday the 5th of May, and 
travelling via London, Queenborough, Flushing, Middlebourg, Breda, 
Boxtel, Eindhoven, we arrived at Yalkenswaard — our destination — 
by continuous travelling, about noon on the following day.
Yalkenswaard, our headquarters, is a village with about 1300 
Clarke : Notes on Birds in Dutch Brabant.
91 
inhabitants, in the province of Dutch or North Brabant, and is situate 
about five miles and thirty miles, respectively, from the Belgian and 
Grerman frontiers.
With regard to the character of the country ^ 
Valkens^Yaard is surrounded by vast heaths or plains, resembling 
flat moors, that on the eastern side of the village being the largest, 
and extends some twelve miles in length by three miles broad.
This is covered with heather for its greater part, and studded with 
numerous shallow lagoons, varying in size, and surrounded with 
long yellow grass.
Running through the plain from south to north 
is the river Tongreep, which is exceedingly deep and sluggish, and 
whilst narrow in some places, in others it spreads out, forming 
extensive marshes, with tussocks of coarse grass, and a luxuriant 
growth of aquatic plants.
Here and there in the marsh and lagoon 
are sedgy islands, on which the bog-myrtle, stunted willows, sallows, 
and alders flourish.
The other heaths are similar to the one described, that on the 
west being traversed by the rivers Dommel and Kierschop, which 
unite a little to the north of Yalkenswaard.
Thus three rivers run 
nearly parallel to each other at almost equal distances.
Pine and fir plantations and willow garths are numerous.
A few 
stunted pine trees are scattered in clusters or singly on the heaths.
The above brief sketch will give a sufficiently good idea of the 
general face of the country for the purposes of the present article.
Where a species is simply enumerated, it is meant to imply that it 
is common, and nothing special was noted concerning it.
The name appearing in brackets after the specific name is the 
Dutch name for that species.
Peregrine Falcon.
— This species will always be associated with the 
village of Yalkenswaard, which is famous for having in the days of 
falconry supplied Europe with both falcons and falconers ; but an 
indication of the present position of that noble sport may be found 
in the fact, that this once village of falconers now contains one 
family only, that of Mollen, which follows the calling.
The 
MoUens, father and two sons, capture this species whilst on the 
autumn passage by an elaborate system of trapping, and after 
training, send most of them to England.
Adrian Mollen, the 
father, filled the ofiice of head falconer to the King of Holland for 
many years, and has retired on a pension.
We frequently saw the 
peregrine on the heaths ; these birds belonged to the spring 
migration, and were unusually late in taking their departure.
On 
the 15th a fine flight was observed with a teal which, seeking the 
river with a splash, foiled its noble pursuer.
92 
The Naturalist.
Hobby {BoomvalJc).
— These birds were observed on the 11th, this 
being no doubt the date of their arrival.
We watched them long 
with our binoculars as they flew within twenty yards whilst 
hawking flies, &c., on the heath ; and were much interested in 
seeing how dexterously they fed on the wing by bringing the foot 
containing the prey to the mouth.

The above readings are from shaded thermometers placed on stands recommended 
by the Meteorological Society for use by meteorologists when taking readings for the 
use of that Society, and which give the true air temperature more accurately than 
thermometers exposed to rain and snow, which read lower in consequence of the loss 
of heat by radiation during the evaporation of moisture from the glasses.

On some Causes which seem to operate in the production of 
Varieties in Lepidoptera.
" — Mr. Mosley's ably -written and interesting 
article on the above subject will be welcomed by experimental entomolo- 
gists who have tried, but failed, to elucidate any bona fide results from 
their own personal observations in the matter of causes of variation.
The 
species of lepidoptera which he classifies under the head " constant " we 
should naturally suppose would come in that category, as in order to form 
themselves into varieties they would have to reveal a tendency for 
changing entire colours or shades, rather than individual patterns — the 
markings, in contrast to most of the other families, being limited in 
quantity (vide Sesidce, Procridcs, Lithosidm, and Zygcenidce.
In the latter 
(say filipendiUce, yellow var.) the tendency appeared to be more towards 
changing the entire colour.
I imagine atmospheric conditions are an 
important item in either forcing or straining variable peculiarities.
In 
the low and warmer spots of the North Welsh woods Larentia olivata 
appears much darker than in the more elevated and cold situations ; like- 
wise Gnophos ohscurata — those I have captured on the bleak Orme's 
Head being much paler than those from the Conway vale.
Mr. Mosley 
attributes this variation to natural selection or local race.
The close 
proximity of the Conway vale to the Orme's Head would not point to a 
localisation of species.
The dark caja which I bred some years ago (now 
in Mr. Porritt's collection) was reared in a kitchen, and at a high temper- 
ture.
Is it not a fact that rearing caja with lettuce for the food-plant, 
instead of its ordinary fare, makes it considerably more prone to 
variation 1 — S.
D. Bairstow, Woodland Mount, Huddersfield.
Podiceps minor at Sheffield.
— I received on the 6th instant a living 
specimen of the little grebe {Podiceps minor), taken on the Sheffield canal.
I believe the occurence of this bird is not frequent in the neighbourhood.
— E.
Howarth.
Arachnids near Selby.
— During September last I beat out specimens 
of the following spiders at Bishop's Wood : — Epeira quadrata, E.
scalaris, 
E. angulata, and E.
diadema.
They may be worth recording.
— Chas.
Smethurst, ISTov. 25th.
Coleoptera near Leeds.
— I collected some fine specimens of Coccinella 
IJf-guUata, also C.
ohlongo-guttata, at Horsforth on the 25th of August 
last.
I am not aware of any previous record of their occurrence in this 
district.

Flora of Surrey.
— Mr. A.
Bennett, of High-street, Croydon, Surrey, 
has favored us with a printed list of the plants reported to occur in the 
five counties adjoining Surrey, but not certainly known to occur in that 
county.
It is published as a first step towards a proposed supplement to 
the flora of the county, and with the wish that those botanists who may 
be able to help will kindly do so, either in confirming by specimens, any

doubtful plants, reported for the county, or by giving the localities where 
they were gathered, so that search may be made next season for them.
We gladly give publicity to this notice, and trust that such of our 
subscribers as can assist Mr. Bennett in the way suggested, will furnish 
the required information.
The catalogue will be lent by us to any 
botanist requiring it, on receipt of a stamped and addressed newspaper 
cover, to be retained seven days.

Manchkster Cryptogamic Society.
— Monthly meeting, Mr. John 
Whitehead, president, in the chair.
— The correspondence read by the 
secretary included a letter from the Rev. J.
Fergusson, who enclosed for 
the reference collection a set of British Grimmias, comprising about 30 
species and varieties.
The specimens brought for exhibition included 
the rare Gymnostomum tenne, discovered in fruiting condition by Mr.
Cunliffe, at Styal, in October.
The same moss had also, it was stated, 
been found barren at Ashley Mill.
It had not been observed in either 
of the localities named until this year.
The president had received, 
through Mr. Hobkirk, an Austrian specimen, which he exhibited, of 
Thuidinm piilchellum, a species rare in Europe, being previously known 
to exist in only one locality.
Another object exhibited by the president 
was a fragment of Hylocomium splendens, in a semi-fossilized state, taken 
from old lake dwellings at Lochlee, near Kilmarnock.
The specimen was 
originally sent to Mr. Hobkirk for identification, by Prof.
Bayley Balfour, 
and was interesting from its apparently semi-carbonised condition.* 
Along with it were picked up some articles of rude workmanship, including 
what appeared to be a plaited girdle, composed of the wiry stems of 
Folytrichum commune.
Mr. Entwistle exhibited an interesting collection 
of dried exotic ferns, including Folypodium minus, a native of Borneo, 
not known until very recently.
York and District Field Naturalists' Society.
— Meeting Dec. 10th.

Wilson exhibited a fine series of Boarmia ahietaria and cincfaria, 
both species bred ; also a fine variety of Ypsipetes elutata.
The honorary 
secretary, Mr. Prest, a specimen of Mixodia rubiginosana — a very rare 
Tortrix, and hitherto only taken in Scotland ; it was taken by him at 
Witherslack in June last ; also a fine series of very dark G.
ohscurata — 
a form only taken in the New Forest ; also specimens from near Lewes, 
very nearly white, where it occurs upon the chalk.

NOTE ON THE ANTIQUITY OF MUSGL 
By F.
Buchain-an White, M.D., F.L.S.
I READ my friend Mr. Hobkirk's note on this subject [page 84] with 
much pleasure, and though I have long ceased the active study of 
mosses (one can't do everything !), I am tempted to say what I know 
on the matter, the more especially as Mr. Hobkirk asks for inform- 
ation.
Taking the records of mosses that have any claim to be entitled 
" fossil " or " sub-fossil," in the order of their geological age, and 
beginning with the youngest, some of the mosses that are preserved 
in various of our peat-beds will come first.
Generally the soft con- 
stituents of peat are so decayed and broken up, that it is impossible 
to say what these have specifically been, but in some cases they are 
sufficiently well preserved to be determined.
For example, Mr.
Skertchley, in his " Fenland," mentions the occurrence of Hypnum 
fluitans beneath three or four feet of peat, in Norfolk, and is inclined 
10 think that the age thereof has been much under-estimated.
Perhaps not older than this Norfolk Hypnum fluitans, and quite 
possibly dating from as recent a period as post-Roman times, come 
the mosses of the Lochlee " crannog." Mr. Hobkirk will perhaps 
deprecate this attempt to rob him of his long-sought fossil moss, but, 
in view of the other " finds " at the crannog, including various 
metallic implements, it is evidently a comparatively recent structure, 
and may even be as I have said, of post-Roman date.
As I do not 
pretend to be a geologist to any greater extent than every naturalist 
should be, I ought perhaps to say that for all the geological state- 
ments put lorward in this paper I have the eminent authority of Dr.
James Geikie.
Much older than the above are some mosses found by me in an old 
peat-bed on the banks of the Tay, near Perth.
These mosses are 
Thuyidium tamariscinum and what appears to be Hypnum cuspidatum.
These I exhibited at the Dunkeld Conference (1877) of the Crypto- 
gamic Society of Scotland, but I think that I have not otherwise 
recorded their occurrence.
The peat-bed in question is very extensive, 
and lies under a varying depth of carse-clay, the depth at the place 
where I found the mosses being fifteen or twenty feet.
Along with 
the mosses were remains of various higher plants, such as oak, pine, 
ISalix, seeds of Menyanthes^ and stems of Scirpus, &c.
There were also

The Naturalist.
numerous wing-cases of Coleopttra.
In some places the trees have 
evidently grown on the spot where their remains now lie, in others 
they have drifted to it.
On the same bed of peat, but in another 
place, we saw an ancient canoe, which affords probably the oldest 
evidence of the existence of neolithic man in Scotland.
Similar 
canoes have been found in the Forth and Clyde valleys, but these 
were imbedded in the carse-clays, while the Tay canoe lay below 
these clays, and is hence presumably more ancient.
The age of this 
peat-bed, or, as it may be termed, buried forest-bed, is what Dr.
Geikie terms middle post-glacial, when Britain was still joined 
to the continent of Europe, and when there was a genial climate and 
a great growth of forest trees, even in places, such as on the higher 
hills and in the islands, where trees will not now grow.
At 
this time it is probable that our south-western flora received its 
peculiar Iberian character, as shown in the Cornish species of 
Ericce.
Coeval with this buried forest of the Tay, or perhaps a little earlier, 
are the mussel-beds of Spitzbergen.
(Perhaps I should mention that 
these mussels — the common Mytilus edulis — are not now found in 
Spitzbergen in a llviiig condition, but are like some of the mosses, 
which do not grow there now, evidences that the climate there was 
once more genial than it is now, just as the Suabian mosses, 
enumerated below, are records of an arctic climate in Suabia.) In 
these a goodly number of mosses have been found, and are recorded 
by Prof.
Oswald Heer, in his " Die Miocene Flora und Fauna 
Spitzbergens." The mosses were determined by Prof.
Schimper,

The next mosses that have been recovered date from inter-glacial 
times, and were found in the lignites, or brown coal, of Diirnten and 
Morschweil, in Switzerland.
They were determined by Schimper for 
Ileer, and are mentioned by the latter in his " Primaeval World 
of Switzerland." With one exception they seem to be all extinct 
species, though the flowering plants with which they are asso- 
ciated are all, except one, species still living, and many of the 
animals are also still existent.
The mosses are — Sphagmim cyrribi- 
folium^ Hypnum lignitorum, Schpr.
(allied to H.
palustre) ; H.
priscum, Schpr.
(very like ff.
sarmentosum) ; Hypnum sp., (repre- 
senting H.
siramineum and H.
trifarium) ; Thuyidium antiquum^ 
Schpr.
(closely related to T.
delicaiulum).
A little older than these Diirnten mosses is one mentioned by 
A. Nathorst in his paper, " Om den arktiska vegetationens ut- 
bredning ofver Europa norr em Alperna under istiden," as having 
been found associated with Salix polaris, in the earliest glacial beds 
of Norfolk.
This is Hypnum turgescens, Schpr., which is also found 
in Greenland, Spitzbergen, Nordland, (fee.
Dr. Hermann Credner records in his " Elemente der Geologic " 
the following mosses as having been found in a Palaeolithic deposit in 
the lowland of Suabia : — Hypnum sarmentosum, H.
groenlandicum, 
and H.
fluitans, var.
tenuissimum.
It will be noticed that these are 
all arctic or alpine species.
We now make a jump to miocene times, when Musettes Berggrcni, 
described and figured by Heer in the work cited above, grew in Spitz- 
bergen.
At this time also three species grew in Switzerland, as Heer 
records in his " Primeval World," but as he does not give their names 
I cannot mention them.
I fancy they are described in his " Flora 
tert.
Helv.," as the above-mentioned Muscites is said to be like 
Hypnum Schimperi, Heer, Flora tert.

I imagine the 
latter to be one of the mosses alluded to in the " Primaeval World.''

NOTES ON BIRDS OBSERVED IN DUTCH BRABANT.
{Conchided.) 
By Wm, Eagle Clarke.
Kestrel.
— Breeds in the plantations.
The sparrow-hawk was not 
observed.
Hen Harrier.— A pair or two on all the heaths, consequently this species 
was seen daily.
Its flight struck us as particularly laboured, being

The Naturalist.
slow and flapping.
Their appearance upon the scene usually called 
for unmerciful bullying on the part of the curlews and peewits^ and a 
single bird of either species seemed quite able to cause them anxiety, 
no resistance being offered.
This species is a late breeder, con- 
sequently no eggs were obtained.
A last year's nest from which 
three young in down had been taken in July, 1878, was shown us 
by Adrian MoUen, junr.
; it was a small structure among bog- myrtle 
on the heath, and composed of heather stems.
The light ashy 
plumage and black primaries of the old male make him both 
beautiful and conspicuous.
Little Owl {Steenuil, Kleinuil).
— Three nests with eggs were obtained 
by us.
The first was taken on the 11th, the situation being a 
rabbit's burrow in a pine plantation, where the trees were thinly 
scattered.
The eggs, three in number, were about four feet from 
the entrance, and laid upon dead needles from the pines.
Atten- 
tion was attracted to the burrow by the fact of a dead mouse lying 
at the entrance.
A second was found as some woodmen were 
removing a pile of felled timber, under which, on the bare ground, 
was an old bird sitting on her four eggs.
The former allowed her- 
self to be taken off the eggs, and both are now in my collection.
The third lot of eggs, two in number, were simply laid in a hole in 
an old birch stump ; castings consisting of the elytra, &c., of 
beetles being found on the tree.
The bird was occasionally 
observed on the wing at dusk.
Barn Owl.
— Only one observed.
It was sitting in a pine -tree.
Great Grey Shrike [Klaanwier, Klapekster).
— This species frequents 
the heaths, where it preys upon the numerous crickets, and nests in 
the small detached pines.
Each pair has its own limited district, 
and does not allow others of its species to trespass upon it.
During 
our stay we obtained several nests, all in such situations.
The 
nest, placed about five feet from the ground, is a considerable 
structure of grass and a profusion of feathers.
One nest had a 
quantity of fine heather, rag, string, and worsted in its composi- 
tion.
The usual number of eggs was seven.
This bird is shy, and, 
with the exception of once or twice observing it hawking for 
crickets and on the nest, was not to be seen.
Eed-backed Shrike {Graauwe Klaauwier).
— The first bird seen after 
leaving England.
On going on deck on the morning of the 6 th, 
at 4-30 a.m., the first object I saw was a splendid male, which 
seemed very tired, and allowed me to approach within a few feet 
Clarke : Notes on Bieds in Dutch Brabant.

before flitting to another part of the steamer.
On coming within 
sight of the Dutch coast it left the vesseL This bird was no doubt 
migrating.
Although frequently observed in the vicinity of 
villages, it was not nesting during our stay.
Woodchat Shrike {Roodkoppuje Klaanwier).
— A male observed on the 
17th.
This was the only occasion on which the species was 
observed.
According to Mollen it breeds not uncommonly near 
the villages.
Spotted Flycatcher.
Pied Flycatcher.
— Many were seen together on the 14th in a plant- 
ation near Waalre — the only occasion.
Golden Oriole iWielewaat).
— This beautiful bird arrived at Yalkens- 
waard on the 11th.
After this date we heard its oft-repeated wild 
flute-like song, and caught occasional glimpses of its rich dress.
Mistletoe Thrush {Be Groote Lijster).
— One nest found ; the bird was 
not observed.
Song Thrush {Zam/lijster).
— Strange to say, neither the bird nor the 
nest seen.
Eggs were observed in a local collection.
Blackbird [Zwarie Lijster).
— Not common.
Eing-Ouzel {Domini).
— A straggler seen on the heath on the 11th, a 
very late date.
It is observed here as a bird of passage only.
Hedge-Sparrow {Boeren-nachlegall).
— This familiar bird was con- 
spicuous by its rarity.
Not a single bird was observed, but a nest 
and eggs found, unmistakably belonged to this species.
Redbreast {Roodborstje).
— Another rarity.
Bird again not seen, but 
a nest with eggs was observed in the possession of some boys.
Nightingale.
— First heard singing on the evening of the 12th ; after 
this it became one of the commonest songsters both by day and 
night.
Bluethroat (Blaauiihorsije).
— The bluethroat found in Holland is 
the one with the white spot in the centre of the blue on the breast.
It is not uncommon, but is seldom seen, for frequenting the willow- 
garths, it is able to pop out of sight instantly.
Several nests with 
eggs were obtained on the 1 1th, all of which latter were considerably 
incubated, proving the species to be an early breeder.
The site of 
the nest (which is composed of bents, grass and moss, lined with 
fine grass) is at the foot of trees, on the side of a grip or bank.

The Naturalist.
in the willow-garths.
We had difficulty in obtaining fresh eggs.
The eggs are of a uniform brownish-green colour, and cannot be 
mistaken for those of any other species.
Redstart.
Black Redstart [Ztvartroodstaartje).
— One of the first birds seen on 
our arrival at Yalkenswaard on the 6th, and the same pair were 
observed daily on the trees close to our windows at the inn.
Their 
nest was subsequently found on the roof of an adjoining barn.
A 
nest, with eggs, taken on the 15th, was situate in a bank.
Stonechat {Roodborstje-Tapuit).
Whinchat (^Paapje).
Wheatear.
— Numerous, Many eggs were obtained from nests in 
bank sides, some of them being of a milk-white colour.
Great Reed- warbler {Groote Karukiet).
— This fine warbler was first 
seen on the 8th.
It was not, at the time of our visit, very numerous, 
and seemed to be confined to the banks of the Tongreep, where it 
delighted in the sallows.
Reed Warbler.
— One nest found on the 17th, ready for eggs.
Sedge Warbler.
Grasshopper Warbler {Spi'inJcJiaan rietzernger) — An abundant species.
Two nests found on the thick grass on the 17th.
One of the eggs 
obtained, now in my collection, is an exceedingly fine specimen, and 
has a zone of rich markings at the larger end.
Whitethroat.
Lesser Whitethroat.
Garden Warbler.
Blackcap.
Willow Wren.
Chiffchaff.
Wren {Winterkoning), 
Tree-creeper.
Great Titmouse.
Blue Titmouse.
Cole Titmouse [Zwarte Mees).
Marsh Titmouse {Zwartkopimees).
Crested Titmouse.
— Two nests of six and seven eggs were obtained.
In both instances the females were snared on the nests, which were 
placed in tree stumps.
One of these nests in my collection is a

103 
most beautiful and compact structure, composed outwardly of fine 
moss, and lined with the finest grey animal down, so finely inter - 
woven as to resemble felt.
Longtailed Titmouse.
— The species found in Holland, of which we 
obtained numerous beautiful nests and eggs, is not of the same 
species as that inhabiting Britain, but may be distinguished from 
it by the ever-present white head of the mature bird.
In Sharp 
and Dresser's " Birds of Europe," the name given to this species, 
which has occurred twice in England, is Acredida caudata ; whilst 
the British species, which is not yet known to have occurred in 
Europe, is given the name of A.
rosea.
We examined several 
birds caught on the nest, and considered that the snow-white head 
made this a much handsomer bird than his British cousin.
Pied Wagtail {Kwickdaart).
White Wagtail.
— More common than the pied species.
Three nests 
with eggs obtained, all of which were thoroughly identified by 
watching the bird to the nest, and in one instance the old bird was 
caught on the nest.
All the nests were placed in stacked sticks, 
in villages, and were loose in structure, ,and composed of bents, 
a small quantity of heather, and numerous feathers ; number of 
eggs, five.
Blue-headed Wagtail {Gele Ktoichstaart).
— A beautiful bird, rivalling 
our grey wagtail — superiority of colour making up for what is 
lost in form.
Two pairs were observed on the 10th at a few yards 
distance.
In the male the blue head and intense yellow of the 
breast make him a fine fellow.
The female resembles him, but is 
not so bright in colour.
Yellow Wagtail.
— Common.
A nest found on the 17th contained a 
cuckoo's egg.
Tree Pipit.
Meadow Pipit.
Skylark {Be Leuwerick).
^Woodlark (Boom leuwerick, Loittentoit).
— Plentiful.
Conspicuous on 
the wing by its short tail, broad wings, and pleasant song.
Several 
nests were found.
Yellow- Hammer, 
104 
The Naturalist.
Eeed Bunting.
This was tlie commonest bird observed.
Four nests 
containing young were found on our first day's nesting (the 7th), 
so that this species is an early breeder.
Male birds were observed 
sitting on the eggs.
Ortolan Bunting {De Ortolan).
— Noticed in the collection of Adrian 
Mollen, who informed me that it bred at Valkenswaard.
Chaffinch {Be Vink).
Goldfinch.
— A nest and eggs found.
Bird not seen.
Linnet.
Tree Sparrow.
House Sparrow.
Greenfinch, 
Bullfinch.
Starling.
Carrion Crow {Craai?).
— Very numerous.
A fine series of eggs 
obtained.
Book.
Jackdaw.
Magpie (Ekster).
— Everywhere.
A nest found in a sallow bush in 
the marsh, was only three feet from the surface of the water.
The 
eggs from this nest were the finest in size and richness of marking 
that I have seen.
Other nests observed in the stunted pines quite 
out on the heaths.
Jay ( De VlaamscJie Gaai).
— Very common.
Nests in the pine planta- 
tions ; the general number of eggs was found from five to seven.
Some nests were not more than five feet from the ground.
Green Woodpecker (i)<?
Groeyie SpecJd).
— The harsh laugh and un- 
dulating flight of this bird were often both heard and seen.
A 
nest got on the 13th, was in the heart of a solid ash tree, and took 
a Dutchman four hours to chop it out, when only two eggs were 
found.
(In Adrian Mollen's collection we saw greater, middle, and 
and lesser spotted woodpeckers.) 
Wryneck.
— The peculiar kestrel-like note of this species was heard 
on the 13th.
Hoopoe [De Hop).
— Not a numerous species in this district.
On the 
14th, when near the village of Aalst, a boy made us to understand 
by signs, &c., aided on our part by the little Dutch we had picked 
Clarke : Notes on Birds in Dutch Brabant.
IOj 
up, that he had observed a " hop " enter a hole in a tree, and that 
he had made it a prisoner by stopping the hole with grass.
After a mile's walk we arrived at a garth composed entirely of 
pollard oaks, about four or five feet high, and the lad pointed to a 
hole, about two feet above the ground, in one of the oaks.
We 
removed the grass carefully, and placing a butterfly net over the 
hole, endeavoured to make the bird leave by repeated blows and 
kicks on the tree, but this proving unavailing, we set to work with 
a chisel and chopper, and after a tough task were enabled to take 
the bird out from the hole made.
I need not relate what followed, 
let this suffice — it is now in the collection of a Leeds friend.
At 
the bottom of the hollow was a premature egg, of a pale lavender- 
white colour, in a broken condition.
It had, no doubt, been laid 
owing to fright, no sign of a nest being found.
Turtle Dove.
— Often seen ; too early for eggs.
Partridge.
Golden Plover.
— A pair in full breeding plumage was observed on 
two occasions.
Lapwing.
Heron (Rif/a), — Very numerous in the marshes, but does not breed 
near Valkenswaard.
Adrian Mollen informed me that at Loo, in 
Guelderland, there are 2000 nests annually^ 
Curlew {TFulj?, cillda).
— Very numerous.
Nesting on the heaths.
Redshank {Tareluur).
— Not numerous.
Wood Sandpiper.
— Perhaps half-a-dozen pairs of .this species were 
noticed.
It hovers at a considerable height above the marshes, 
uttering a short, oft-repeated, not unpleasant note, quite worthy of 
being called a song.
Two nests were taken — one on the 11th with 
four eggs, and another on the 17th with two eggs.
They were 
found among the heather on the banks of the Tongreep.
Black-tailed Godwit {Grutto).
— Not at all numerous.
Whilst searching 
the Dommel marsh on the 16th, one got u|) at a great distance, and 
flew away uttering its note " grutto, grutto." In the course of ten 
minutes it returned, and our suspicions were aroused that it had a 
nest.
Getting out of sight for a few minutes, we allowed her time 
- to settle down.
On our showing ourselves she again rose ; and 
although we searched thoroughly, we were unable, owing to the 
distance at which the bird rose from us, to find the nest.
We got 
concealed several times, but with the same rQsult, so decided to 
106 
The Naturalist.
leave the locality for a few hours.
On returning, the bird rose 
when we were nearly half-a-mile off.
It now began to rain heavily, 
which was an advantage, for now she could not leave her eggs long.
Lying in the heather in our mackintoshes, a few hundred yards 
from where we knew the nest must be, we waited for a quarter 
of an hour.
This time, the exact spot from which the bird 
rose was detected, and the nest found.
It occupied a tussock 
of dry grass, standing six inches above the surface of the water, in 
a small shallow lagoon.
It was composed of dry grass, and 
contained four fresh eggs.
On other occasions we put up this 
species in the marsh, when it proved to be a very noisy bird.
Ruff- and-Reeve {KempJmar).
— Observed, but far from numerous.
No 
eggs had been laid up to the date of our departure.
Common Snipe {Snip).
— Only two seen.
Jack Snipe.
— A pair seen on the Tongreep marsh on the 7th.
Spotted Crake {Klein Waterheti).
— A most abundant species in the 
Tongreep marshes, but the nest in these extensive swamps is very 
difficult to find.
The old birds, whilst you are traversing their 
haunts, will run about your feet, and with great difficulty can be 
made to rise, and then they flutter on weak wing for a yard or two 
only.
I purchased a bird from some boys, which had been caught 
by a dog.
On the 11th, whilst striding from one tussock to 
another, a crake slipped off her nest, which was quite under 
my foot.
How she escaped death I cannot tell.
The tussock was 
a tall one of green marsh grass, standing two feet above the surface 
of the water ; in the centre was a hollow, lined with short pieces of 
dry grass, each about two inches long, in which were thirteen eggs, 
two of which were broken by my foot.
After this we found several 
nests, and I noticed that when the situation was very wet, the bird 
made a considerable nest of dry grass.
Sometimes the nest and 
eggs were in the water, and quite buried under tangled grass of 
the marsh.
Moorhen (Waterhen).
Water Rail {Waterral).
— Perhaps not quite so numerous as the 
spotted crake, and confined to the marshes of the Dommel.
A fair 
series of eggs were obtained from nests of grass, placed in dry 
tussocks in shallow water.
Eggs eight and ten in number.
Shoveller {De sloheend).
— This species was observed on the Tongreep.
Pintail Duck (Pijlstaart).
— This species was easily distinguished when 
on the wing by the long attenuated tail.
It was scarce, and con-

fined to a few pairs remaining to breed.
On tlie 11th wq had the 
good fortune to find a nest with eggs on the heath where the heather 
was very thin, and not far from several lagoons.
The old bird 
*' wriggled " off her nest quite at our feet.
It contained seven eggs 
much incubated, and consisted of a depression surrounded by a 
great quantity of down plucked from the breast of the bird, which 
was held together by numerous particles of a green lichen, so 
common on heaths, and was therefore a most beautiful object.
It is 
now in my collection.
Common Wild Duck (Wilde annt).
— Numerous, and nesting in the 
long grass of the marshes.
Teal ( Winter taling).
— Very numerous.
A quantity of eggs obtained 
on the heaths.
Garganey {Zomer taling).
— Not uncommon.
A nest found by us on 
the 7th contained ten eggs; it was placed among heather about 
five inches long, close to the ground, and composed of broad dry 
grass surrounded with down.
The eggs were of a rich cream colour.
The bird rose when we were only a few yards from the nest.
Black Tern (Zwarte stern).
— A flock of this elegant species was always 
to be seen hovering in graceful evolutions over the Tongreep.
They 
breed in company on the swampy islands, but the date of our 
departure was a few days before the usual time for this species to 
have eggs.
Black -headed Gull.
— Only a few seen.
Leeds, December, 1879.
Black-Throated Diver near, Halifax.
— Dec. 15th, 1874, James 
Sunderland shot on the Albert Reservoir, at Halifax, a black-throated 
diver, the most perfect specimen I ever saw, an adult male in full 
plumage.
On the 3rd of January, 1880, the same man, on the same sheet 
of water, shot a female of the same species, in good plumage.
I have 
seen both birds.
The little grebe and kingfisher have been seen on the 
Calder, at Elland.
I never saw birds so scarce as they are this year.

Larentia rujicinctata in Yorkshire.
— Mr. J.
W. Carter, of Bradford, 
has sent me for determination a specimen of this insect taken on Malham 
Moor, August 27th, 1876.
I believe a specimen was taken some years 
ago on the moors near Huddersfield, but it seems to be an exceedingly 
rare species in Yorkshire.

The Naturalist.
FoALiia OF NiDDERDALE.
— Can any reader of the Naturalist furnish 
authentic information as to whether any of the following species of mam- 
maha and birds occur in the drainage basin of the Nidd ?
— the great bat, 
the common weazel, the stoat, the longtailed field-mouse, the common 
rat, the water shrew, the peregrine falcon, the hobby, the bam owl, 
tawny owl, long-eared and short-eared owls, the black-cap, sedge 
warbler, grasshopper warbler, and garden warbler.
None of these appear 
to have been recorded for any part of this extensive valley.
While on the 
subject I will add that I shall be glad to see information of any kind 
with respect to the Fauna of Nidderdale in any of its branches.

Anemone nemorosa var.
ccBrulea.
— It is surprising that so beautiful and 
distinct a variety as the above plant should be, without exception, 
entu'ely overlooked by writers of our descriptive English Floras.
Many 
describers mention the common " purple " variety, but none a blue one, 
and blue the present plant undoubtedly is ; its color being very little 
paler than that of typical apenrdna.
It difi"ers botanically of course, from 
the latter species, viz : — by its fewer and broader sepals, and its tuber 
being slender and nearly uniform, not knobbed at the end as in apennina.
I beUeve this blue variety was once mentioned in an early number of the 
PhytoJogist, or another contemporary publication ; but I have no 
knowledge of a more recent record.
It has been found in several of the 
southern counties ; it would be interesting to hear of its occurring 
further north, Yorkshire especially.
Like Anemone apennina it shows 
variations of color, some plants being paler than others ; but in its 
extreme form it difiers very little from that species.

Manchester Cryptogamic Society.
— Annual meeting, 17th Dec.
— 
This was made the occasion of a most interesting exhibition of objects 
illustrating the several departments of cryptogamic botany.
The musci 
were represented by several valuable collections sent by members, such 
species as were especially interesting being displayed under microscopes.
Mr. Peter G.
Cunliffe had a splendid assortment of beautifully prepared 
slides, mounted by himself, amongst which were to be found all the rarer 
British species.
A well-mounted series of pleurocarpous mosses was 
exhibited by Mr. Holt ; a collection of American seaweeds by the hon.
secretary (Mr. Rogers) ; one of dried Selaginellas and Lycopods — a magni- 
ficent series — by Mr. Entwistle ; British lichens by Mr. John Leigh, 
M.R.C.S.
; hepaticse by Dr. Carrington and Mr. W.
H. Pearson ; micro- 
fungi by Mr. T.
Brittain ; drawings of ferns, mosses, and other crypto- 
gamia by Mr. Hardy ; and a series of nature-printed ferns by Mr.
Forster.
Amongst other things kindly lent for exhibition were the 
original MS.
of Wilson's " Bryologia Britannica," and the author's private 
copy of that work, containing his sketches and memoranda as to different 
species.
The greater part of the evening was occupied in the exhibition 
and private discussion of the objects above enumerated.
Amongst those 
present were Dr. Carrington, of Eccles, distinguished for his labours on 
the hepaticse.
Dr. J.
B. Wood, and other well-known students of crypto- 
gamic botany.
In the course of the evening Mr. W.
H. Pearson, vice- 
president, took the chair, and after briefly indicating the more important 
objects in the room, called upon the hon.
secretary, who read a report of 
the work done by the Society since it came into existence twelve months 
ago.
The report specified in its general features what had been the 
Society's work during the year, and expressed indebtedness to the presi- 
dent (Mr. Whitehead) for the numerous facts which he had placed on 
record, and the exhibition of rare species of mosses which have come 
under his observation from time to time.

— The eighteenth annual meeting, 
held at Huddersfield, on the 17th January, was most successful through- 
out.
The business meetings were held in the Lecture Hall of the 
Literary and Scientific Society.
The Sections held their annual meetings 
at 3 30 p.m., resulting in the elections of the following officers: — Mr.
Thos.
Lister, of Barnsley (re-elected) president, and Mr. W.
E. Clarke, 
of Leeds (re-elected), secretary of the Vertebrate Section ; Mr. Wm.
Cash, F.G.S. of Halifax, president, and Mr. J.
Darker Butterell, of 
Beverley, secretary, of the Conchological Section ; Mr. G.
T. Porritt, 
F.L.S., of Huddersfield, president, and Mr. S.
D. Bairstow, of Hudders- 
field (re-elected) secretary of the Entomological Section ; Mr. C.
P. 
Hobkirk, F.L.S., of Huddersfield, president, Mr. William West, of 
Bradford (re-elected) secretary for cryptogamic, and Mr. F.
Arnold Lees, 
F.L.S., of Wetherby, secretary for phanerogamic botany, of the Botanical 
Section; and Prof.
A. H.
Green, M.A., F.G.S., of Leeds (re-elected) 
president, and Mr. J ames Spencer of Halifax (re-elected) secretary of the 
Geological Section.
The general annual meeting was opened at 415 p.m., 
the chair being taken by the president, Dr. H.
Clifton Sorby, F.R.S., 
Pres.
G.S., &c.
After the confirmation of the minutes, the list of 
additional subscribers was read, and thanks voted.
The annual report 
was read by Mr. George Brook ter., F.L.S., secretary.
It congratulated 
the members on the steady progress of the Union during the year, 
enumerated the meetings held, stated that the membership was about 
1500 (with 26 societies), recommended invitations being extended to other 
societies, reported the publication of Part ii.
of the Transactions, and 
referred to the exhibition held at Leeds in January, ] 879.
The report 
also informed the members that, with regard to the proposed map of 
Yorkshire, Mr. E.
Filliter, C.E., who had kindly undertaken to transfer 
the contour lines from the ordnance maps, had made substantial progress, 
and might be expected to finish it in the ensuing year.
The geological 
portion was, however, not reported in so forward a condition.
The 
petition sent to Parliament against the enclosure of Maltby Common, the 
formation of a library for the Union, and the increase of the number of 
subscribers from 164 to 221, were also referred to ; and the report con- 
cluded with an expression of the sense which the council entertained of 
the honour conferred upon the Union by Dr. Sorby's tenure of the chair 
for two years, and of the impetus thereby given to its prosperity.
The 
balance-sheet showed an income of £86 10s.
9d., and an expenditure of 
£63 3s.
9d.
The report and balance-sheet having been adopted on the 
motion of Messrs.
F. A, Lees and S.
L. Mosley, the excursion programme 
for 1880 was resolved upon, as follows : — Masham or Ripon, Easter 
Monday, March 29th ; Malton, Whit Monday, May 17th : Barnsley, 
Saturday, June 12th ; Boston Spa, Saturday, July 10th ; Marsden, 
Monday (Bank Holiday), Aug. 2nd ; and Market Weighton, Saturday, 
Sep. 4th.
It was also resolved to have a special excursion in the autumn 
for the collection of fungi, several promises of assistance by competent

mycologists having been made, and the details as to time and place were 
left to be fixed by a small committee.
The annual meeting was fixed for 
York, 15th January, 1881.
Proceeding to the election of general officers 
for 1880, Dr. Sorby proposed as his successor in the presidential chair, 
Prof.
W. C.
Williamson, F.R.S., of the Owens College, Manchester — a 
Yorkshireman by birth and descent — stating that Prof.
Williamson had 
consented to stand.
The nomination was supported by several members, 
and received with enthusiasm by the meeting, The two secretaries (Mr.
Geo. Brook, ter., F.L.S, F.R.M.S., of Huddersfield, and Mr. W.
Denison Roebuck, of Leeds) were unanimously re-elected ; and Messrs.
A. Crebbin of Bradford, and C.
W. Richardson of Wakefield, were also 
re-appointed auditors.
It was then resolved that a class of honorary life 
members be created, for the reception of men of eminent scientific 
attainments who may have rendered signal service to the Union ; and 
that their number be limited to twenty, of whom not more than two 
to be elected in one year.
Dr. H.
Franklin Parsons, F.G.S., late of 
Goole, was unanimously selected as the first of these honorary members, 
and afterwards a code of rules regulating future elections agreed to.
Votes of thanks for the use of the rooms, to the auditors, the secretaries, 
and the president, brought the meeting to a close — the president, in 
reply to the vote, stating that the experience of the Geological Society 
of London was against the tenure of the presidency for more than a 
limited term by one individual.
Tea was served at .5-30 p.m., and at 7 
p.m. an adjournment was made to the Victoria Hall for the delivery of 
the presidential address, the remainder of the evening being devoted to 
the Annual Microscopic Soiree of the Huddersfield Literary and Scientific 
Society.
The soiree was most brilliant and successful, and passed off well 
in every respect, the Union being much indebted to their Huddersfield 
constituents for so enjoyable a pendant to their annual meeting.
About 
sixty microscopes were shown, from all parts of the West Riding, and 
the attendance was very crowded.
Other attractions were provided, in 
the form of electrical experiments by Mr. H.
Marriott of Huddersfield, 
a lecture on Vortex Atoms," with experiments, by Mr. C.
Bothamley, 
of Leeds, paintings of butterfiies by Mr. S.
L. Mosley of Huddersfield, 
glass models of marine invertebrata, kinematic diagrams by Mr.
Washington Teasdale of Leeds, and drawings of the battledore scales of 
butterfiies by Mr. G.
Brook, ter., F.L.S. The soiree was opened at 
seven o'clock by Mr. Geo.
Jarmain, F.I.C., president of the Huddersfield 
Literary and Scientific Society.
Dr. Sorby then delivered his annual 
address to the Yorkshire Naturalists' Union, taking for his subject The 
Structure and Origin of Limestones," afterwards illustrating his remarks 
by microscopic sections of those rocks.
A vote of thanks to him was 
proposed by the Mayor of Huddersfield, seconded by Mr. Hobkirk, and 
carried unanimously, after which the company proceeded to the inspection 
of the numerous objects of interest shown.

LINCOLNSHIEE COAST LEPIDOPTERA.
By G.
T. Porritt, F.L.S.
Encouraged by the graphic description of the charms (!) of the Lincoln- 
shire Coast, given by the Rev. W.
Fowler, M.A., in his paper on 
" Lincolnshire Coast Plants," published at p.
129 of Vol. IlL of this 
Journal, Mr. C.
W. Richardson and myself determined to spend a 
few days investigating its lepidopterous fauna.
The 16th July last, 
therefore, found us on our way, per Great Northern Railway, to 
Skegness, a place which until the last year or two had scarcely been 
heard of by anyone outside Lincolnshire, but which, thanks to the 
enterprise of the Earl of Scarborough, and the Great Northern 
Railway Company, seems destined to become, and that very rapidly, 
a popular seaside resort.
Within the last few years several large 
hotels have sprung up ; and there are already wide streets with 
well-built houses and villa residences in plenty ; whilst all the 
ordinary seaside attractions are in contemplation, some indeed already 
in existence.
Though I have headed this paper " Lincolnshire Coast Lepidoptera," 
the title is rather a misnomer, as the whole of our collecting was 
confined to the neighbourhood of Skegness.
Very likely, however, 
the misnomer is more apparent than real, for, as Mr. Fowler says, the 
coast is of wonderfully uniform character throughout its entire course ; 
and, in all probability the insect fauna varies very little, less indeed 
than on any other equal extent of coast in Britain !
Some variation 
would no doubt be found on the mudflats prevailing at different parts ; 
at Skegness there being nothing but sand-hills.
The little work 
which has been done at Cleethorpes, the only other part of its coast 
at which anything seems to have been done, quite confirms this 
supposition, allowance being made for its more northerly position.
Mr. Fowler, in the paper alluded to above has already given us a 
list of the various plants occurring on the coast, consequently, it is 
needless in this short article to again allude to them.
Its lepidopterous 
fauna, on first thought, is rather peculiar, including, as it does, 
several species usually supposed to be fen or marsh insects only.
The weather up to the time of our visit had been very wet and 
unsettled, but we were, nevertheless, very much surprised to find one 
such species, Nudaria senex, very abundant in spots which in fine 
weather we imagined would be like the Lancashire and other 
N. S., Vol. v.— Mar., 1880, 
114 The Na^turalist.
sandhills, perfectly dry.
Herminm crihralis too, another marsh moth, 
was common enough.
In a few dnys.
however, a satisfact' ry expla 
nation had grown on us, for we found that however hot or dry the 
day might have been, the sandhills at night were always excessively 
wet, so that every evening we went out, we came in soaked thi'ongh.
This of course, whatever the natural cause of the moisture might be, 
was sufficient to account for the damp loving plants and moths.
Collecting in the daytime was dreary work, as there was not a 
decent species to be found.
There was indeed very little variety, and 
the few s})ecies that did occur were of the commonest description, such 
as Saiyrus Janim, Chortohius Fami>hi.liL'<^ Lyrcena Alexis, Zyjrsna 
filipenduJa, Euchelia J acohfce and Cnrrtptogramma hiUneata.
These 
were all plentiful enough, but there was hardly anything else to be 
picked up, even as occasional odd specimens.
Micro-lepidoptera 
were as scarce, one or two Crambites, several Tortrices and Tinei^a, 
with Pterophorus pterodactylus, being about all.
We never, however, 
saw a Pterophorus so abundant anywhere as was this one here, for 
it actually swarmed in the hollows, flying in hundreds, and we could 
have netted any quantity.
Some interesting coleoptera occurred, and 
the pretty hymenopteron Pompilus plumhem was running about the 
sand ; and the curious dipteron Tetanocera marginata was also taken.
The evening work was much more satisfactory.
We usually put 
on the sugar shortly before dusk, and there being no tree trunks, we 
had to be content with sugaring posts and palings ; fortunately there 
were plenty of them, and they made excellent substitutes.
By the 
time this work was completed, the early flying moths were on the 
wing, the first to put in appearance generally being N adaria sencx, 
which flew with a slow gentle flight just over the tops of the reeds, 
grasses, &c.
No sooner had it got well on the wing than it was 
followed by Herminia crib/alis, and a little later still by Nonngrra 
elymi : these three species, though belonging to totally different 
families, flew in a very similar manner, and all were frequently taken 
on the same spot, within a few inches of each other.
Whilst netting 
these at early dusk, a glance at a sugared post close by would now 
and then reveal a lovely f harocampa elpenor, poised with wings 
vibrating so rapidly as to seem almost motionless over the post, the 
sugar from which was being sipped by means of its long outstretched 
proboscis.
Soon afterwards we light up the lamps, and take our first 
round at the posts.
Noctu{e are on them in profusion— quantity 
sufficient surely to satisfy anyone, — but the quality, - well, perhaj s 
the less said about it, the better I For the number, probably never

did we see so common a lot, hardly a moth in fifty worth boxing, and 
still few^r worth setting ; for whilst long series of common things 
might have been taken in splendid condition, most of the better 
things were wretchedly worn.
The list following includes most of 
the species that visited the sugar: — Leucania comma, impura and 
pallens, plentiful ; Axylia putris ; Xylophasia lithoxylta and polyodon^ 
in abundance ; sublusiris not common ; Maw.estra anceps and alhicolon 
both common ; Apamea hasilinea, Miana literosa, fasciuncula, strigilis 
and arcuosa ; Tryphana pronuha with Agrotis segetum and exclam- 
ationis in swarms ; Noctua plecta and C-nigrum not uncommon ; 
N.ruhi; one fine female Aplecta occulta; Hadena oleracea and pisi 
in plenty, with late straggling thalassina.
Between the " rounds," 
and after sugaring, we searched the reeds, grasses and low herbage 
with tolerable success.
The most abundant moth in such situations 
was Nonagria elyml.
This moth, although so comparatively recent an 
addition to our list, is evidently very abundant all along our coast, 
from Spurn in Yorkshire, right away to Norfolk.
At Skegness we 
took nearly eighty specimens one night, but it was the only time any- 
thing like that number was reached.
We also got in the same way 
plenty of Nudaria senex, and a fair sprinkling of Herminia cribralis, odd 
Lithosia complanula, EiipitJiecia centanreata^ and a few very fine Anerastia 
lotella and Homceosoma nhnhella.
The most interesting species, how- 
ever, was EupitJiecia innotata, of which two specimens were secured.
When, some years ago, Mr. Crewe proved that the mnotata of our 
lists at that time was in reality not the Continental species known by 
that name, but a new one, which he named fraxinata, it was doubted 
if the true innotata did really occur in Britain, and the name was 
erased from our list.
Other species taken in various ways included — Orgyia antiqua, Boar- 
mia rhomboidaria, HemitJiea thymiaria^ Acidalia scutulata, interject aria, 
imitaria and aversata ; Timandra amataria, Larentia pectinitaria, Melan- 
thia ocellata, Pelurga comitata^ Noctua f estiva ; Caradrina Morpheus, 
common and in fine order ; a single fine Mamestra abjecta, the day 
before we came away, — evidently just appearing ; Caradrina bland a ; 
the local Scoparia Uneolalis ; Crambus pratellm, tristellus, culmelliis, 
perlellus, and Warringtonellus.
Writing of this Warringtondlus, I 
quite expect that when the larva of it and perlellus are thoroughly 
known, they will prove to be only different forms of one species.
It 
is quite possible that the New Forest Warringtonellus may be distinct, 
as it seems much darker and more constant than these Lincolnshire 
specimens, besides not always being found in company with perlellus, 
116 The Naturalist.
as is the case at Skegness and (as I also found it) in the Isle of Man.
The foregoing list of species is certainly very meagre, but it 
includes several very interesting ones, and there is no doubt that it 
the district were thoroughly worked, many rarities would turn up.
Unfortunately there appear to be no lepidopterists residing in the 
immediate vicinity ; but now that such facilities are given by the 
Great Northern Kailway Company for travelling there at an excep- 
tionally cheap rate from all our Yorkshire towns where the Company 
enters, there is no reason why some of the members of our Union, 
who can spare say two or three days each month from April to 
September, besides working up our own county (which of course 
stands first), should not do so.
I am quite sure they would be well 
rewarded, and would have the additional and greater pleasure of 
adding to our knowledge of the fauna of a district in which so 
little has as yet been done.

THE FLORA OF CARNARVONSHIRE AND ANGLESEA.
By J.
E, Griffith, F.L.S., F.R.A.S.
The following list of plants found in the two adjoining counties of 
Anglesea and Carnarvon, although more extensive than might 
have been expected, comparing their size with any other corresponding 
area in Great Britain, must nevertheless be looked upon as far from 
complete.
Owing to the insular position of Anglesea and the peninsular 
configuration of Carnarvonshire, both counties abound in algge and in 
the flora peculiar to maritime shores.
The former county contains 
many stretches of marsh and moor land, producing aquatic, sub- 
aquatic, and bog plants in abundance.
The latter county, owing to 
its mountainous character and the constant humidity of its atmo- 
sphere, is rich in alpine plants, while every boulder, stone, crag, 
ancient ruin and wall is covered with mosses and lichens in profuse

luxuriance.
Upwards of thirty lakes, great and small, nestle in the 
valleys and cwnis of Carnarvonshire.
Many of them are at a con- 
siderable elevation, and a careful examination of them will well repay 
the botanist in search of alp-lacustrine plants.

The plant seems to 
have been distributed by Mr. Curnow for some years back, under the 
name of F.

I understand that Mr. Boswell first found out 
the mistake from specimens gathered by Mr. Curnow, last November, but 
my specimens were gathered so far back as September, near Penzance.

Large Assembly of Magpies.
— During a walk to Adel on the 3rd inst.
my brothers, while passing the house of Mr. Tetley at Meanwood, were 
surprised by a loud chattering noise, which, when they got nearer, they 
found to proceed from a great number of magpies assembled together.
Within a very short space they counted twenty-eight, and there were 
many more perched on the trees, walls, and fences.
Without exaggera- 
ting they say there must have been upwards of fifty, and several persons 
were watching them.
Can anyone inform me what had attracted them, 
and if it is not an unusual occurrence ?
I have never seen more than two 
or three together.
It^seemed as if all the magpies in the neighbourhood 
of Leeds had met together to form plans for the new year.

Local Names of Fishes.
— Mr. Thomas Satchell, of Downshire Hill 
House, Hampstead, London, N.W., is compiling a glossary of fish names, 
a provisional index to which has been printed and distributed for the 
purpose of obtaining additions and corrections.
He not only wishes to 
record the local names of fishes, and the districts where used, but also 
the local designations of marine animals and fishing appliances, fishing 
terms generally, and notes on popular beliefs and superstitions connected 
with fish and fishing.
The glossary will ultimately be printed by the 
English Dialect Society.
Mr. Satchell will be glad to receive assistance 
from any who will forward him notes from any locality.
It would also be 
useful to readers of the Naturalist to record their notes in its pages.

Barnsley Naturalists' Society.
— Meeting, 17th February.
— A very 
interesting paper on rare migrating birds was read by Mr. G.
Rose .
The 
entomological and botanical sections meet regularly, and in the absence 
of observed specimens, good papers are read by members.
The ornitho- 
logical report treats of similar movements of water-fowl and land-birds as 
recorded in the last number of the Naturalist.

of Woodhall, reports the great grey gull, kestrel, fieldfares, and thrush, 
all rarely seen this winter until the breaking up of the first and second 
frost.
Jan. 11th, ISIr. W.
Talbot, of Wakefield, reports the occurrence of 
the great-crested grebe, red-throated diver (immature), and little grebe, 
on pools and streams between that town and Barnsley ; with rare birds 
as well as plants, locality not always given, so as to give less temptation 
to extirpate them.
Jan. 24th, Mr. Hailstone reports that flocks of twenty 
or more of Canadian geese came from !^y ostell.
He was disturbed recently 
by alarm cries of the waterfowl from the island on which Walton Hall is 
built, and on approaching he found a mallard caught by its beak in a rat 
trap which it had dragged upon the ice.
When rescued, the other birds 
became quiet.
It seems to him and to us something like reasoning 
intelligence.
A friend reports examining, in a bird-shop at Doncaster, a 
rough-legged buzzard, and a weasel, partly decomposed, which it had 
swallowed recently.
Mr. KeU reports the little grebe in a pool near Silk- 
stone, Feb. 19th, chaffinches singing joyously at the Limes, near 
Barnsley.

Bradford Naturalists' Society.
— Meeting Jan. 6th.
— The president 
delivered his inaugural address from the chair, reviewing briefly the 
present position of the society and its objects, and throwing out some 
valuable hints regarding future operations.
He suggested the formation 
of collections of objects of natural history, for the use of the society, and 
strongly recommended members to take up the investigation of some of 
the more obscure orders of the animal and vegetable kingdoms.
Mr.
West gave the first of a valuable series of demonstrations of the characters 
of the natural orders of British plants, dealing with the orders Banun- 
culaceae, Berberidaceae, Xymphasaceas, Papaverace£e, Fumariacese, and 
Cruciferae.

and showing the distance these organisms are from flowering plants.
He 
described their method of reproduction and growth, illustrated by black- 
board diagrams and coloured charts of many macro-fungi, both edible 
and poisonous.
A number of slides of minute fungi were exhibited 
under the microscope to illustrate the remarks on the micro-fungi.

and communications were made by Mr. J.
W. Dixon and other members.
368th Meeting, Feb. I7th, Mr. Henry Lupton, v.
p., in the chair.
— 
Short notes from Mr. Alfred Roberts, of Scarborough, were read, the 
subjects being — the fondness of animals (chimpanzee) for scent ; the 
nesting of the kingfisher ; the habits of the common bat ; and an anecdote 
of a snake carrying ofi" a starling's egg.
Mr. J ohn Grassham exhibited 
a male golden-eye duck in full adult plumage, in which state it is but 
rarely met with ; Mr. Walter Raine, eggs of the ostrich, emu, and great 
bustard.
Microscopic objects were shown by Mr. F.
Emsley, and an 
external parasite (unnamed) of the pig by Mr. Benjamin Saynor.

Manchester Cryptogamic Society.
— Monthly meeting.
— The presi- 
dent (Mr. Whitehead) exhibited a specimen of Coscinodon crihrosus, which 
the Rev. J.
Fergusson, in a recent number of the Naturalist, describes 
as an immensely interesting addition to the British flora.
The moss was 
collected so long ago as the year 1867, at Coniston, by Professor Barker, 
of Owen's College, but lay unrecognised until Mr. Fergusson quite 
recently detected it among a collection of British Grimmise which the 
professor sent him.
The president also exhibited a species of Fissidens 
new to Britain, viz., F.
serrulatus, gathered by Mr. Curnow near 
Penzance.
It was distributed by Mr. Curnow in 1872, mixed with F.
polyphyllus, and appears to have been mistaken for that species, from 
which, however, it is quite distinct.
A specimen of Mnium spinosum, 
for which Ben Lawers is the only known British station, was exhibited ; 
as were also Plagiothecium annotinum, and the various species of Timmia, 
128 
The Naturalist.
British and continental, of which only four are at present known.
One of 
the species, T.
Norvegica, was from Ben Lawers, where, as stated in 
Schimper's Synopsis, it was first collected by M'Kinlay.
A collection of 
fresh-gathered mosses from Malham and the neighbourhood, exhibited by 
Mr. Cunliflfe, were a source of much interest.
The species included 
Zygodon Nowellii, Omalia trichomanoides, and Anomodon viticulosus —the 
two latter with fruit.
Mr. W.
H. Pearson exhibited specimens of Diplo- 
phyllum ohtusifolium (Hook), detected amongst other hepaticae collected 
by Mr. C.
J. Wild, at Alderley Edge, in May, 1878.
It had previously 
been collected near the Manchester district, at Delamere, by the late Mr.
W. Wilson and Dr. Carrington.
Mr. Pearson also exhibited specimens 
of Metzgeria hamata (Lindb.), collected by Mr. E.
George, of London, 
last July, near Arrochar, Scotland.
Wakefield Field Naturalists' Society.
— Monthly meeting, Feb.
4th, the president, J, Wainwright, F.L. S., in the chair.
— The president 
read a paper founded on minutes he had made during his journey through 
Spain and Northern Africa in September, October, November, and 
December last.
He confined his remarks more particularly to the 
botanical portion of his notes, and gave an interesting account of the 
raisin and almond growth and wine manufacture in the Malaga district, 
as also of the orange district through which he passed.
York and District Field Naturalists' Society.
— Monthly meeting, 
Jan. 14th, the president, Mr. T.

FISSIDE^S SERRULATUS.
By H.
Boswell.
Bkyological readers of the Naturalist who may happen to visit the 
western coasts should keep a look-out for this handsorue moss, lately 
found for the first time in Britain by Mr. Curnow.
It is not impos- 
sible that it may grow by the side of some rocky stream between 
Carmarthenshire and the Hebrides, or in the south and west parts of 
Ireland.
Long supposed a native only of Madeira and the neigh- 
bouring islands, it was subsequently found in Portugal, and is one of 
a few mosses of sub-tropical character and affinities, whose presence 
with us is doubtless due to the influence of the Gulf stream; such are 
Ulota calvescens, Daltonia splachnoides, Hookeria locte-virens, Myuriiim 
Sehridarum, &c.
; and where they grow, F.
serridatiis may also occur 
if fitting habitat be found.
Mr. Curnow has occasionally, during the last twenty years, sent me 
specimens of JE.
polypJiyllus, and during last November sent me two 
more, of somewhat different aspect, together with a third plant which 
he thought seemed different from either ; and so it was, and-' from 
any that he had forwarded before, nor had I much hesitation in 
coming to the conclusion that it was unmistakeably P.
serrulatus — a 
very interesting addition to our British flora.
There is sufficient resemblance between the two to make it very 
possible to pass over F.
serrulatm as pohjpJiylhis, unless the attention 
is awake ; yet there is plenty of difference between them when closely 
examined.
In F.
pjolypJiyllus the leaves taper gradually to a point ; 
they are without border, entire except at the apex, which is serrulate ; 
the cells at the basal part are gradually enlarged from the margin 
inwards towards the nerve, those of the long-decurrent angles being 
linear-oblong, thin and hyaline ; the male flowers are eight or nine- 
leaved.
In F.
serrulatus the leaves are not tapering, but straight in 
outline and obtuse-pointed, the margins of the conduplicate portion 
finely serrulate, the apex of the lamina serrated, and they are 
furnished with an evident border of yellowish-coloured cells, some- 
what larger than the rest ; while the basal cells are uniform, and the 
male flowers three-leaved.
When the " Bryologia Britannica " was published, little was known 
of this species and its allies : and Wilson, with a commendable desire 
to avoid the needless multiplication of species, united his pnlypJiyllus with 
N. S., Vol. v.— April, 1880.
ISO 
Th E IS' A T U R A LI S T.
F. aqdenioides Swartz, and F.
serridatus Bricl.
; but further study and 
increased means of knowledge soon showed this to be a mistake.
F, 
serridatus and polypJiijllus are distinct enough, as shown above, though 
similar in size and general aspect.
F. asplenioiJes seems to be alto- 
gether a different plant, and much smaller, more resembling in size 
F. crassipes or h\yoides, so far as shown by the few specimens I have 
seen.
It is only known, I believe, from Bouth America and New 
Zealand.
In fact the whole group is a very difficult one to the student, and 
has been the cause of numerous mistakes, which are perhaps not yet 
all cleared up.
F serridatus, Hornsh.
in Flor.
Bras, is not the true serridatus, but 
a much smaller moss, in style like asplenioides, and is F.
Kornscliuclni 
of Montague.
More nearly resembling our plant in size and aspect 
are F.
syhaticus, Griff, (which is F.
Javanicus of Dozy and Molk.
Bryol.
Javan.) from India and Java; F.
nohdis, Griff, {filicinus, 
Dozy and Molk.) from the same countries, and F.
polypodioides, Hedw., 
an American species, but none rivals qVlX pohjpliyllus in size.
F. Wel- 
witscJiii, Duby, a south-west African species, has lately been reported 
from Portugal, but the identity is doubtful, and according to Sauer- 
beck the Iberian plant is a distinct one, F.
polypJiylloides.
Judged by 
the few imperfect specimens I possess, it seems to differ but very little 
from polypJiylhjs.

Acronycta memjanthidis.
— A specimen of this insect — supposed to have 
been a hermaphrodite — is reported (Nat. V., 78) as being exhibited 
before the Huddersfield Scientific Club.
I, at the time of its being 
exhibited, expressed doubt as to its hermaphroditism, and Mr. Porritt 
kindly lent me the specimen, along with P.
flavocinda reported, ,for 
examination and figuring, and the following is my opinion on the 
menyanthidis : — Menyanthidis seems to be clothed with 
three kinds of scales, something like the engraving.
Figs.
1 and 2 form the ground color of the wing, 1 the 
grey portion, and 2 the black markings, and Fig. 3 is 
more prevalent near the base of the fore-wings, which 
gives the insect the soft downy appearance.
On the 
left fore-wing many of Fig. 1 are wanting, and almost 
1. 2 3, all Fig. 2.
We therefore lose the black markings 
and the white ground, and the tawny membrane of the wing shows 
through the scattered (Fig. 3) scales, which gives the insect a rather 
pecuHar appearance.
I do not therefore consider that hermaphroditism 
has anything to do with the variation.
The P.
flavocinda is a beauty, 
and will be figured in my " Varieties of Brit.
Lep." I had a somewhat 
similar one from Mr. Carter two or three years ago.
— S.
L. Mosley, 
Primrose Hill, Huddersfield.
Note on Above.
— I did not make a microscopic examination of the 
specimen referred to above, and am, therefore, very glad that Mr.
Mosley has done so.
I think, however, he has overlooked the most im- 
portant item in his examination, viz.
, a comparison of the scales of the 
two sexes.
The fact remains that the left side wings of this specimen are 
of the exact shade and marking of the female of the species, whilst the 
right side wings are precisely like those of the male.
Mr. Mosley says, 
" On the left fore wing many of Fig. 1.
are wanting, and almost all Fig.
140 
The Naturalist.
2," &c.
The question naturally following is, whether this is not always 
a characteristic of the female ?
My opinion, too, was based as much on 
the antennae as the wings.
There is not very much difference in the 
sexes in this respect ; but those of the male are a little thicker, and in 
this example the right one seems to me distinctly thicker than the left.
The best proof would be in the anal appendages ; but the specimen was 
very dry when sent to me, and would require thoroughly relaxing before 
a proper examination could be made.
I still think the specimen a perfect 
hermaphrodite.

Badger at Bramham Park.
— A very large badger, wide across 
the back, and very heavy, was shot at Bramham Park, a week or two 
since by the keeper of G.
L. Fox, Esq. It was at the foot of a tree.
I 
have heard of badgers before in the same neighboiu-hood.
— John Emmet, 
Boston Spa.
Note on the Common Bat.
— Mr. Alfred Roberts, the well known 
Scarborough naturalist, has recently communicated to the Leeds 
Naturalists' Club the following note : — He was collecting moths under an 
apple tree one lovely evening in July many years ago : at the same time 
there were also a number of bats flying round the tree, chiefly the 
common or pipistrelle bat, one of which he netted.
While he was taking 
it out of the net it was very fierce, biting and squeaking at everything.
On reaching home it was placed in a small box.
Next morning he was 
examining the specimen and to his astonishment found it had a young 
one attached to its breast fixed with its tiny hooks.
So Mr. Roberts 
concluded that the female feeds her young whilst flying.
He let it 
remain in the box till evening, when on lifting the lid it instantly flew 
away with its young.
Magpies.
— It is not at all uncommon for magpies to congregrate in 
considerable numbers.
In the district around Halifax these birds are 
abundant, and it is not unusual to see a dozen or more together, and 
upwards of thirty have been seen at once.

Snake and Egg.
— Mr. Alfred Roberts, of Scarborough, recently 
communicated a note to the Leeds Naturalists' Club, as under : — In the 
summer of 1868 a young gentleman from Oliver's Mount School brought 
an egg to him to be named.
He told Mr. Roberts that he had taken it 
from an adder on the South Cliff whilst it was carrying it to a hole.
The 
egg, which was slightly crushed when brought to Mr. Roberts, was pro- 
nounced by him to be that of a starling.
Most likely a starling would be 
nesting in the cliff near.
Chrysomela fulgido., L.

B. Wrigglesworth inquires if this species has ever been 
Short Notes and Queries, 
141 
captured in or recorded for the West Riding.
The query does not seem 
to have been answered.
In reply I may quote the records I have seen.
The first is given in the appendix to Whitaker's " Loidis and Elmete,^' 
(1816) p.
63, thus : — Crysomela fulgida, viridi-cenea, elytris punctatis, 
auro nitididis.

Selby, 1806.— Mr. P.
W. Watson." The next record dates in 1831, and 
is thus given in Stephens' Illustrations of British Entomology, vol.
iv.
, 
p. 345 : Very common on tansey, near York." — W.
C. Hewitson.
The.
same author, in 1839, in his Manual of British Beetles, gives it as 
occurring on tansy, Yorkshire." In 1840, H.
Baines published his 
Flora of Yorkshire, in which, at p.
59, he gives the tansy as growing on 
the " banks of the Ouse, above and below York, abundant ;" and adds, 
* * It likewise affords nourishment to the larva and perfect insect of 
Chrysomela fulgida.
This splendid insect may be found on the tansy, on 
the banks of the Ouse, in great abundance." Lastly, in the Entomologist 
for August, 1873, vi.
460, Mr. T.
W. Wilson having asked for the name 
of a beetle which feeds on the tansy, commonly called the tansy -beetle," 
is replied to by Mr. Edward Newman, who gave the scientific name, and 
added that it occurs in marshy places in Yorkshire, Cambridgeshire and 
Norfolk, but that he did not recollect receiving it from any other county.
I give the records in full, to enable the reader to judge whether or not 
the localities are in the West-Riding.
My object, however, in writing 
this note is to ask a question.
Will someone tell us by what name it is 
now known, as I do not find any such name as Chrysomela fulgida in 
Sharp's Catalogue of British Coleoptera ; nor does the catalogue seem to 
afford a clue to the synonomy.

— Meeting, March 16th.
— An inter- 
esting paper was given by Mr. G.
Griffiths, being observations from his 
note-book of birds, here and in his native district on the Welsh borders.
A few additional plants were recorded in flower.
Most of our resident 
songsters cheer us with their fuller melodies.
The com bunting was 
heard March iTth ; the starlings, jackdaws, and rooks are busy in the 
fields picking up worms, grubs, &c.
; and among the plantations and 
woods the last two have been engaged some weeks in carrying sticks and 
other materials for their nests.
]\Ir. Hailstone writes on the 7th that the 
grey wagtail appeared on the Lawn at Walton Hall.
This winter visitant 
to South Yorkshire has been rarely seen this scarce season.
The pied 
wagtail — our resident bird of this family — appears more frequently than 
it did in the intensely cold months.
March 10th, IVIr. Berry reports a 
large flock of fieldfares in a field near Silkstone : he believes they are 
moving by daily stages to their breeding haunts in Norway.
A few gulls 
have been noted.
On the 18th another large flock of fieldfares was seen 
in a turnip-field at Day House.
This bird, and its companion the red- 
wing, have only been noted at rare intervals this season.

from Pomerania, May 18th, 1879.
He also showed a series of the very 
dark unicolorous males of Hibernia progemmaria.
The form — which is 
very difi'erent to the ordinary type — occurs pretty commonly in this 
district, and being unnamed, he proposed to call it var.
fuscata.
In the 
same box Mr. Mosley had a series of a Microgaster, bred from the pupa 
of Pieris rapce ; it was alUed to, but distinct from glomeratus.
Mr. G.
T. 
Porritt showed a nice imago, with empty cocoon, of Nola centonalis, 
given to him by Mr. W.
H. Tugwell of Greenwich, who had recently bred 
a series from eggs from an example taken in Kent in August last.
Previously there were only three or four known British specimens.
The 
periodicals laid on the table included the new American Monthly 
Microscopical Journal," The Annual Beport of the North Stafibrdshire 
Naturalist Field Club and Archaeological Association," &c.

recently published by Dr. Katter of Berlin.
The Rev. H.

exhibited some very interesting illustrations of Japanese Heterocera, and 
Mr. Kinder specimens of Sperclimis emarginatus — a water beetle lately 
taken plentifully near London after a disappearance of several years.
The Leeds Natuealists' Club and Scientific Association.
—369th 
meeting, Feb. 24th.
— Vertebrate section, Mr. W.
E. Clarke in the chair.
The meeting was devoted to the reading of lists bearing on the vertebrate 
fauna of the Permian limestone tract, including the country about 
Staveley, Knaresbro', Ribston,- Wetherby, Tadcaster, Bramham, 
Aberford, Sherburn, and Ledsham.
The list of quadrupeds sub- 
mitted was very meagre, and only included eleven species.
The 
catalogue of birds was more satisfactory, and included 108 species, 57 
being resident, 26 summer migrants, 10 winter visitants, and 15 stragglers 
or rare and accidental visitants.
The latter class included some very 
rare birds, three of which — the orphean warbler, the cream-coloured 
courser, and Ross's rosy gull — are represented by extremely few, and in 
the last case by no other, British-killed examples.
The list of reptiles 
was a meagre one, including five names only.
Mr. John Grassham 
read a list of thirteen fishes, to be found in the Wharfe at Thorp Arch.
370th Meeting, March 2nd.
— Entomological Section, Mr. Henry 
Lupton in the chair.
— The natural history of the Permian district was 
again gone into, notes on lepidoptera being communicated by various 
members.
A discussion arose on the ease with which the burnets are 
exterminated.
Mr. W.
H. Taylor stated that ZygcenafilipendulcE used to 
be common at Bramham about twenty years ago, but that when he 
collected there soon after, it had become extremely scarce.
He also 
stated that many years ago a colony of burnets existed in the borough of 
Leeds, just beyond Wortley — now of course extinct.
Mr. C .
Smethurst 
reported a similar instance in a field near Horsforth.
Mr. W.
H. Taylor 
showed, for Mr. Thomas Benn, a drawer of geometers, which included a 
moth found in the streets of Leeds, of a form which cannot be well 
identified, but is supposed to be Geometm jpapilionaria.
He also showed 
a box of the species of Acronycta and Sesia.
Mr. John Grassham showed 
some interesting moths, mostly Bombyces ; Mr. Washington Teasdale, 
F.R.M.S., dichroic scales of various lepidoptera, showing complementary 
colour according as they are viewed by transmitted or reflected light ; 
Mr. F.
Emsley, Hydra viridis from Sandal, near Wakefield, and, by 
special request, Mr. James Abbott brought his series of slides of the 
brain of the cockroach.
37lsT Meeting, March 9th, Mr. B.

— Mr. W.
E. Clarke exhibited a male and female 
shore lark {Aland a alpestris), shot at Spurn Head on the 13th of 
March.
A large flock had frequented that part of the coast since last 
December, being especially partial to a large bed of wrack, or sea-weed.
This bird had not occurred in any numbers on the Yorkshire coast for 
fifteen years.
Mr. Walter Raine exhibited some skins of foreign birds, 
including a pair of Indian partridges, the night heron, the paradise fly- 
catcher, and belted kingfisher ; Mr. Henry Lupton, a variety of Cymato- 
pJiora Jlavicorfds, in which the orbicular s]3ot is yellow — an unusual 
circumstance ; also a number of females of Hyhernia progemmaria.
All 
these insects he had lately captured within the borough of Leeds, at 
Hawksworth Wood.
Mr. F.
Emsley brought for exhibition the stomata 
and raphides of Byacinthus nutans, the blue-bell.

— Monthly meeting, 15th March.
— Mr. Whitehead, the president of the Society, read a paper on the 
Inflorescence of Mosses, in which he showed the importance of these 
organs in the determination of species.
In the works of Linnaeus 
the fruits of mosses were erroneously described as anthers.
The great 
German botanist, Hedwig, in his Muscorum frondosorum, demonstrated 
that other minute organs which he had discovered were really the true 
flowers of mosses.
This was disputed on the high authority of Necker.
The value of the organs pointed out by Hedwig was not fully appreciated 
until the studies of Bruch and Schimper were published in the grand 
Bryologia Europea.
Mr. Whitehead pointed out the difierent modes of 
flowering, and showed that in a great measure the flowers of mosses 
were analagous to the flowers of flowering plants proper.
After giving 
some practical hints of how and where to look for flowers, the members 
were invited to the inspection of a splendid microscopic mount of the 
flowers of Cindidium stygium, from Malham Tarn, prepared by Mr.
Whitelegg.
The honorary secretary (Mr. Rogers) afterwards read a 
translation, by Dr. Wood, from the Bryologia Europea on the Inflorescence 
of the genus Fontinalis.
Many rare local mosses were exhibited by 
Messrs.
Cunlifie, Holt, and Wild.
Mr. Thomas Brittain also exhibited 
several species of microscopic fungi, specimens of which he kindly 
distributed.
The honorary secretary announced that he had received a 
magnificent collection of European mosses, which had been presented to 
the society through Dr. Wood, by Professor Schimper, of Strasburg.

SHELL-HUNTING AT THE ANTIPODES.
By Thgs.
Ball.
Some time ago I left England for the Colony of New Zealand.
Having 
seen a little of what the coast produces, I comply with a request to 
publish, in the hope that my notes may not be altogether without 
interest to readers of the Naturalist.
The shells here are very interesting to a stranger from the " old 
country," on account of the great novelty of the forms which they 
present, and their contrast to the genera with which he has been 
familiar, in the living state.
He goes down to the coast line, perhaps 
through a Mangrove swamp, and the first shell he sees belongs to the 
curious genus Ampliibola — so characteristic of this antipodal region.
A flat through which I went down to the beach to-day is only 
covered with water at high tide, and was quite dry at my passing, but 
there the Ampliibola was crawling in a lively manner by thousands— 
so thickly, indeed, that one could not avoid crushing the fragile shell.
Setting down to the coast, the first thing that struck me was the 
amazing abundance of an Ostrcea, a species of rock oyster ; for miles 
the rocks are covered with it.
I had previously made acquaintance 
with this mollusc in the agreeable guise of an article of food.
The 
flavour, at any rate in the cooked state, is about equal to that of our 
English " natives " ; raw, it does not look quite so tempting, as the 
colour is slightly yellow — a tint to which one is not accustomed.
But 
the disadvantage of tint is compensated by the cheapness of the 
article.
Let an English lover of oysters try and fancy what it must 
be to get five score of his favourites for a shilling the lot !
— which is 
the price of the animal in its shell, But then comes the process of 
opening.
I tried knives of every known form, and worked round at 
every point of the circumference of the shell, but all in vain ; the 
occupant never thought of yielding to anything less than a hammer 
and a cold chisel, and very reluctantly even to that.
On account of 
the difiiculty of opening, these oysters are usually sold taken out of 
the shells and bottled.
The next shell that strikes one is a relative of Ampliibola, a pretty 
species of Siplwnaria.
Though so much like a limpet, it is at once 
distinguishable by its greater activity of movement, and by its sticking 
to the rock much less closely.
Then come large Turbines and Trochi, 
and when one has only collected shells at home before, there is the 
N. S., Vol. v.— May, 1880, 
146 
The Naturalist.
pleasant and novel sensation of tugging at a great big mollusc that 
requires both hands almost to push him off the rock.
And you may- 
have the pleasure of filling a basket with your captures as quickly as 
you had been accustomed to fill a little box.
Chitons are very 
abundant, both in species and individuals, and are many of them of 
good size.
The sub-genus KatJiarina is a novelty, and a very different 
object seen alive from what it is in the cabinet.
There it is as black 
as a bit of leather, to which indeed it is not unlike.
Living, it is a 
beautiful vermillion, and the mantle is granular.
I had seen several 
individuals of a species of Boris, to which the Katheriua bore such a 
close resemblance, that I had nearly passed it over ; but happening to 
touch it, the hard plates could be felt below the mantle.
There is a large species of Emarginnla with the shell all but the 
apex buried in the mantle, and in which the anterior slit has become 
such an imperceptible notch that it was a long time before I could see 
it.
A beautiful Triton with an ivory mouth, ornamented with dark 
brown teeth, seemed to be a great prize, till I was informed the natives 
took any quantity of them to eat.
Most collectors are familiar with the ParmopJionts, or duck's bill 
Limpet, but alive it presents a most unfamiliar appearance, and 
must bear the palm for ugliness in the moUuscan kingdom.
The shell 
(which is very small compared to the size of the animal) is entirely 
covered by it.
It is, indeed, not so very much larger than the shell of 
Limax maccimus, compared to that of the slug.
The animal is black, 
and has a couple of short thick tentacles.
The first I saw was 
squatting on a stone in an attitude which reminded me very much of 
a large toad, the tentacles resembling the fore paws.
I took the thing 
for a monstrous Aplasia.
On handling it, the creature emitted a 
copious lot of slime like a slug.
Evidently there was something hard 
in the back, which on examination proved to be the ivory shell of the 
Parmophoru8.
This repulsive animal is a favourite article of food with 
the natives.
I am told they wade into the sea at low water, and by 
running the hand along the ledges of rock under water, can easily 
feel the mollusc and bring it up.
It is often found as large as the 
hand.
A word about land shells must bring these notes to a close.
Wood- 
ward says — ''The moist and equable climate (of New Zealand) is , 
favourable to the existence of land shells," so I came with the hope of j 
making speedy acquaintance with some of them.
But for some time 
that hope was not realised — I could not find one ; and I was quite 
ready to agree with another authority, who says that " New Zealand 
Fowler : Lincolnshire Coast Lepidoptera.
147 
appears to have been very much over-estimated with regard to land 
shells." The fact is, that though the climate is suitable, the soil is 
not, as in many districts of the country there is a total absence of 
limestone in any form.
The consequence is, that shells that are at ail 
conspicuous are found only in small areas, none of which I have yet 
seen.
But I find there is a considerable number of very small species 
pretty generally diffused.
They are thin and delicate, like our 
Zonites, but many of them are beautifully marked with zebra-like 
stripes and patches of colour, and, though small, are therefore 
interesting.
Of fresh-water shells I have not yet been able to meet 
with a single specimen, with the exception of a Unio.
I understand there is an excellent catalogue of the New Zealand 
marine shells, to which, however, I have not yet had access, and so 
have had to omit specific names from my notes.
Unfortunately no 
list of the land shells has yet been produced.
LINCOLNSHIRE COAST LEPIDOPTERA.
By Rev. W.
Fowler, M.A.
Hoping that some of our Yorkshire Naturalists will act upon Mr.
Porritt's suggestion, and investigate the lepidoptera of the Lincoln- 
shire coast during the coming season, it may be well for me to point 
out two or three accessible centres of operation in addition to Skeg- 
ness.
From Cleethorpes to Saltfleet there are mud-flats as well as 
sand-hills ; from Saltfleet to Gibraltar point, south of Skegness, sand- 
hills only ; and from Gibraltar point (near Wainfleet) to Boston, and 
round " The Wash " to Sutton Bridge, sloping turf walls and mud- 
flats, similar to those between Cleethorpes and Saltfleet, but more 
extensive.
To all the places I have mentioned there are now railways, 
so that the lepidoptera of the coast could be easily worked (as the 
birds have been by Mr. Cordeaux), if those who make them their study 
would by way of a change, visit, say, Humberstone, near Cleethorpes ; 
Saltfleet ; Mablethorpe ; Gibraltar Point, near Wainfleet and Fos- 
dyke, near Algarkirk station.
They would thus secure both sand-hills 
and mud-flats, northern and southern species, and, as Mr. Porritt says 
— " add to our knowledge of the fauna of a district in which so little 
has as yet been done." 
The wetness of the sand-hills at nights Las been often noticed by 
me, and attributed to the radiating, and consequent dew-condensing, 
power of Psamma arenaria — a sea-grass which grows in great luxuri- 
ance there, and is called by the rustics " sines." On the Lancashire 
248 
The NatuPvAList.
sand-Mils the grass is perhaps that of shorter species, so that on it le&s 
dew is deposited : or (as the amount of dew varies, of course, with the 
quantity of watery vapour iu the air), it may be that its comparative 
absence at the time the Lancashire hills were visited by Mr. Porritt,

The Badger near Pickering.
— When on my holidays last August, in 
the neighbourhood of Pickering, I was interested to learn that the badger 
was still to be regarded as a native of that part of Yorkshire.
I was told 
that Mr. Marfitt, grocer, of that town, had one on his premises which 
had been caught in the neighbourhood.
I called on him, and he was 
good enough to show us the animal alive and apparently well.
He kept 
it in an outhouse in an enclosed yard, and would have shown us more of 
it in the yard if it had not displayed such a very strong objection to 
leaving the side of the wall, against which it laid very closely- and very 
determinedly, whilst Mr. Marfitt endeavoured to force it away with a 
stout stick.
It kept up a sort of savage grunt, and bit very hard at the 
stick.
At length he got it partly out, and to stand up so as to afford us a 
good view of it.
Mr. Marfitt had a coUey dog, which he put into the 
place with it, but the dog beat a hasty retreat with its tail between its legs.
He gave us various interesting particulars of the method in which the 
badgers are captured, and stated that he had had one before this.
The 
badger-hunters usually set off" from Pickering in the evening, the distance 
I being about seven miles.
They arrive at the place shortly before mid- 
night.
In company with a keeper who knows their haunts, the hunters 
keep very still until the badgers go out to feed ; they then get very 
quietly up to their burrows, into the mouth of which is inserted a bag 
with slots across it.
The greatest caution has to be observed, or the 
badgers will not leave their holes, or having left them, will rush back on 
the slightest uinusual sound, and before the preparations for their capture 
are completed.
All being ready, the dogs which accompany the hunters 
are sent into the woods, whereupon the badgers rush in hot haste to get 
''bagged." I was told by Mr. Marfitt that with their strong claws the 
badgers can penetrate a long way into the ground in a very short time ; 
and that it is a most diflicult thing for any dog which may be sent into 
the holes to dislodge the inmate, as the badger usually makes a sort of 
154

ledge or slielf in its burrow, upon which it rests, above the level of the j 
burrow itself, and upon this ledge it sticks like wax.
On one of our i 
fishing excursions we visited the place where these badgers were cap- 
tured, and where others of their species still exist.
Following a small 
beck, we had to force our way at times through the bushes and under- 
wood, and had several ugly falls where trees had been uprooted and 
holes left which had grown over with vegetation.
Had it not been for 
the existence within a mile or two of a line of railway, I should have 
considered this spot to be one of the quietest and most out-of-the-way 
places left in om: county ; and that in fact it is so, is proved, I think, by 
the above captures and the continued presence of such an animal as the 
badger.

Nesting of the Kingfisher.
— IVIr. Alfred Roberts, of Scarborough, 
recently communicated to the Leeds Naturalists' Club the following note 
on the kingfisher continuing to breed in the same hole after a second i 
robbery of her eggs.
In May, 1868, a man brought him six beautiful fresh 
eggs of the kingfisher, taken from a hole in a bank at Scalby Beck, near 
Scarborough.
In the beginning of June of the same year he brought six 
more as fresh and fine as the first lot.
On being asked from where he 
had got them, the man said they were from the same nest as those he 
brought before.
In July following, he brought five more from the old 
nest.

A new West Yorkshire Moss — Em-ynchium striatulum.
— On Easter 
Monday, whilst walking with Mr. M.
B. Slater from Tanfield to Mickley, 
I gathered ofi" a fallen tree bole, on a wooded bank half-way between 
Tanfield bridge and Mickley village by the field path, a quantity of a 
glossy green, creeping, pinnately-branched moss, with plentiful smooth 
reddish setae ; but for the most part the sporangia were past their prime, 
a few only still retaining their long pointed, conical lids.
It had to my 
eyes in the field somewhat the aspect of B.
plumosum, or E.
myosuroides, 
and I so remarked to Mr. Slater, who repKed that it was more like a 
small glareosum.
This moss turns out to be Eurynchium striatulum, 
Spruce ; hitherto known only from Sussex (Mitten), near Castle Howard 
(Spruce), Somersetshire (Berkeley), North Lincolnshire (Lees), Killarney 
(Wilson), and Wicklow (Moore) ; and curiously enough, it is a Pyrenean 
species, which (so far as my present knowledge goes) has hitherto occurred 
in several of the counties furnishing another Pyrenean species, B.
sale- 
hrosum, Hoffmann.
The form found by me in 1877, in Legsby Wood, 
near Market Rasen, has the leaves somewhat more squarrose, and the 
branchlets more curved {E.
circinnatum-like) than Westphalian and Sussex 
scraps of the same moss with which Mr. Boswell has furnished me.
The 
Mickley plant is very like the Westphalian.
It is a welcome and notable

Obituary- — Dr. Schimpee.
— It is with much regret we have this 
month to chronicle the death of our greatest modern bryologist — Dr.
Wilhelm Phillippe Schimper, Professor at the University, and Director 
of the Museum, at Strasbourg, which took place on the 20th March last.
Our space will not allow of any extended notice of the life of this great 
botanist ; but his works, which have made his name of world-wide 
renown, must have our humble tribute to their value.
His greatest 
work, the Bryologia Europea, which contains descriptions and magnificent 
plates of all the then known European species of mosses, was the result of 
the joint labours of M.
Bruch and himself.
Its publication commenced 
in 1836, when M, Schimper would be only 28 years of age, and the last 
portion — Corollarium — was completed 19 years afterwards (1855).
The 
first edition of his Synopsis Muscorum Europ?eorum " was published in 
1860, followed in 1864-5 by the " Supplementum Bryologia, or Musci 
Europeei ISTovi," of which only some four or five parts were issued ; and 
in the beginning of 1876 a second and much enlarged edition was issued 
of the '^Synopsis." Dr. Schimper paid visits to England more than 
once, the last occasion being in 1866, when he made collecting excursions 
to Scotland and Ireland in company with Mr. Wilson, Dr. Wood, Dr.
Moore, Mr. Hunt, &c.
His name is commemorated in the specific 
designations of several mosses ; but, apart from that, his published 
works are sufficient to perpetuate the renown of this great and accom- 
plished bryologist.
NOTICES OF BOOKS, &c.—'' The Geological Antiquity of Insects, 
by Herbert Goss, F.L.S., &c." : London, Yan Voorst (Is. 6d.)— Under 
the above title Mr. Goss has republished, in a separate form, the twelve 
papers on Fossil Entomology, with additions, which he has contributed 
to the Entomologists^ Monthly Magazine, vols.
xv.
and xvi.
We desire, 
and can confidently recommend to aU our entomological friends the 
careful perusal of this reprint, in the full assurance that they will be 
amply repaid.
It contains a compendious account of all that is known on 
the subject, with copious references to all the chief authors and their 
works, who have investigated this interesting study, which has been too 
much neglected in England.
Our space wiU not permit us to enter into 
any detailed account of its contents, but we may say that it contains 
detailed lists for each geological formation, both in England and abroad, 
of the^ orders, genera, and in some cases species, of the remains of insects 
which have been found or recorded down to the present date, and we 
trust only forms the basis for a much larger work on the same subject, 
which we are .convinced our author is well qualified to undertake, and 
bring to a successful issue.
Let all our entomological and geological 
friends obtain it without delay.

gladly call the attention of our bryological readers to the advertisement

The well-

it, but we may be allowed to add, having personally seen the drawings 
illustrating the first monograph, that they are all that can possibly be 
desired.

Leeds Geological Association, April 5th.
— Mr. Thos.
Tate, F.G.S., 
Bradford, delivered a lecture entitled ' ' Extra-Terrestrial Rocks and their 
Terrestrial Allies.
" Meteorites, from which examples were chiefly drawn, 
are either native iron associated with nickel and cobalt (Siderites) ; 
spongy iron, whose cavities are charged with stony matter (Siderolites), 
or stony with particles of iron difiused through the mass (Aerolites).
To 
the last group belong the singular carbonaceous meteorites consisting of 
iron and carbon, which are preserved only when they happen to fall upon 
ice or snow.
JSTo meteorite has, as yet, given evidence of its having 
crystallised from an aqueous solution, but all appear to have passed 
through a fiery ordeal.
Three minerals have been discovered not present 
in terrestrial rocks, and incapable of forming under terrestrial conditions, 
in the presence of atmosphere and water — a proto-sulphide of iron 
(troilite), phosphides of iron and nickel (schreibersite), and a monoclinic 
silica (asmanite).
The familiar volcanic minerals, enstatite, olivine, &c.
, 
chiefly silicates of magnesium or iron, having the base largely in excess of 
the silica, form the bulk of these extra-terrestrial bodies, and are such as 
are found only in the ultrabasic series of terrestrial rocks, the heaviest, 
158 
The Naturalist.
most unstable, and deepest seated of igneous products, and the last to be 
ejected during a prolonged volcanic outpour.
At times these bring up 
with them grains of unoxidised iron, showing Michenstatt lines similar to 
those exhibited by meteoric iron wlien etched out with acid.
In some 
instances, more particularly those of Ovifak, Greenland, these volcanic 
products have been mistaken for meteoric matter supposed to have fallen 
at the moment of eruption, and there are reasons for suspecting a like 
confusion in other examples from Hungary, the Urals, Mexico, and else- 
where.
The inference that may be fairly drawn from these investigations 
is that the extra-terrestrial bodies scattered like dust through cosmic 
space are built up of the same materials as constitute the interior of our

Yorkshire Naturalists' Union.
— The season of 1880 was opened by 
an incursion into the "N"orth Riding, and the northern edge of the West 
Riding, Masham being chosen as the place of meeting, and Easter 
Monday, which fell so early as the 29th of March, being the date.
Several of the members got off at Ripon, but the main body proceeded to 
Tanfield station, with the intention of visiting Hackfall, admission to 
which, as well as to Studley Royal and Fountains Abbey, was most kindly 
and freely granted by the Marquess of Ripon.
Both places were visited, 
as well as other parts of the picturesque country about Ripon.
The 
meeting, which was held at the King's Kead Inn, Masham, was attended 
by about thirty members, and the chair occupied by one of the vice- 
presidents.
Rev. Wm.
Fowler, M.A. The societies represented were — 
Huddersfield, Ovenden, Liversedge, and Bradford Naturalists' Societies, 
Leeds Naturalists' Club, Huddersfield Literary and Scientific Society, 
Huddersfield Scientific Club, Leeds Conchological Society, Leeds 
Geological Association, Bradford Scientific Association, and Dewsbury 
Natm-alists' Society.
The list of new subscribers, to whom thanks were 
voted, included Messrs.
J. H.
Gurney, jun., F.Z.S., Norwich, J.

Miss M.
Morton, Rev. Edward Gray, and Rev. H.
H. Slater, B.A., 
F.Z.S., of Ripon.
Mr. W.
Denison Roebuck of Leeds proposed, and 
Mr. F.
Arnold Lees, F.L.S., of Wetherby, seconded a vote of thanks to 
to the Rev. H.
H. Slater, B.A., F.Z.S., for his services as local secretary, 
and to the Marquess of Ripon for permission to visit his estates.
Mr. Roebuck remarked that in Mr. Slater, who has recently come 
into Yorkshire, the Union has received a welcome addition to its 
working strength, Mr. Slater was one of the three naturalists who 
accompanied the Transit of Yenus expedition to Rodriguez, and a 
naturalist of considerable attainments in various branches.
A vote of 
thanks was also passed for certain donations of books as a nucleus of a 
library.
The Sectional Reports were then called for, as follows : — Mr.
F. Arnold Lees, F.L.S..
secretary of the Botanical Section, stated that 83 
phanerogamia and ferns were observed during the day, only twelve of 
which were in bloom, owing to the early date of the meeting, and the 
lateness of the season.
The only four species worthy of mention were 
Draba verna, Adoxa Moschatellina, Chrysosplenium alternifolium, and 
Veronica montana.
Mr. Wm.
West, cryptogamic secretary of the 
Botanical Section, reported about 82 species of mosses observed, inclu- 
ding Pterygophyllum lucens, Eucladium verticillatum, Dichodontium 
pellucidum, Hypnum stramineum, and H.
Schreberi.
Seventeen species 
of Hepatics were observed, the rarer of which were — Lejeunia serpylli- 
folia, Ptilidium ciliare, Frullania dilatata, and Jungermannia connivens.
Nine common species of lichens were seen.
A few fungi were noticed, 
CEcidium Ficarise, and Melampsora salicina being amongst them.
Several 
algae were collected, including Chroolepus aureum.
The officers of the 
Vertebrate Section being absent, Mr. E.
E. Prince, of Leeds, stated that 
but little had been observed.
The squirrel was seen at Tanfield, and large 
quantities of dead moles in the grounds at Hackfall ; while of birds none 
but common species had been noticed.
Mr. W.
Cash, F.G.S., president 
of the Conchological Section, reported that nine species of fresh- water and 
25 species of land shells had been met with during the day.
In the 
Fluviatile species the most interesting were Ancylus lacustris, v.
com- 
pressa, obtained by Mr. Cash from the leaves of the yellow water-lily at 
West Tanfield, and two of Colbean's varieties (undulata and trifasciata) 
of Neritina fluviatilis, collected by Mr. J.
W. Taylor in the river Ure at 
Hackfall.
The most remarkable land shells collected were Helix sericea, 
var.
cornea, found at Hackfall by Mr. Nelson, and Clausilia laminata at 
Tanfield by Mr. Cash.
For the Entomological Section, the president, 
Mr. G.
T. Porritt, F.L.S., reported that in consequence of the early 
period of the year, and of the recent east winds, very little had been 
done, and the few species observed were of the commonest description.
He had no doubt, however, from the nature of the ground, that later in 
the year it would prove a very good district.
The Geological Section was 
represented by its president, Prof.
A. H.

secretary, Mr. James Spencer [no report received.] — W.

THE BUTTERFLIES OF NORTH WALES, 1876-80.
By S.
D. Baiestow, F.L.S.
A SHORT time ago I took occasion, with the assistance of Mr. D.
Elias, Pentraeth, to complain, through the newspapers, of an apparent 
scarcity of entomologists or Natural History societies in the counties 
bordering the coast line of North Wales.
I received numerous com- 
munications upon the subject, but there was lacking an authoritative 
and proficient naturalist to take the initiative, or, if such did exist, 
he did not seem willing to apply himself to the task before him.
From my own brief personal observations, whilst occasionally 
passing through the country (I visit Wales about thirty days out of 
the year), I venture to opine that this district is rich in botanical 
results, and food-plant must be, and undoubtedly is, productive of 
treasure to the entomologist who is willing to search for it.
My 
desire, in giving the following list — small as it seems — is to give a 
stimulus to the exertions of would-be lepidopterists, who I sincerely 
hope will join hand-in-hand mth others in forming societies of their 
own, for the sake of mutually benefiting each other, and in furtherance 
of that good old cause — the love of nature.
I hope this List of Butterflies will call forth some response.
Many 
more species, I fancy, could be added, as well as new localities.
Argynnis PapJiia.
Bettws-y-coed and Festiniog vale ; very occasional.
A, Aglaia.
On the mountain bogs at Penrhyn Dudriath, Newman

The North Welsh butterflies seem to be very fitful in 
character, and often disappointing to the collector ; but this may be 
taken for what it is worth, as the past few years have been no 
criterion for future success.

Abukdance of Nightingales.
— I do not kno^v whether the great 
quantity of nightingales in the south this year has been generally noticed.
During Whitsuntide I was collecting lepidoptera in Chattenden Woods, 
Kent, and found nightingales, not in twos or threes, but in scores.
They 
were everywhere.
Every place containing sufficient trees and underwood 
seemed to have its pair, and in the wood itself they were on all sides.
At 
night, standing still, half-a-dozen could be heard singing at one time all 
round one.
They sang equally well both night and day.
I made 
Higham head-quarters, and the railway station there is built in an old 
chalk pit, the floor of the pit occupying perhaps a couple of acres.
In 
this pit were some half-dozen of the melodious songsters, representing 
probably, as many pairs, and each having its own particular ground ; and 
although through the centre of the pit ran two sets of rails, and in one 
part of it four sets, and having the station, goods sheds, and several om 
houses, and the trains running through every few minutes, the nightin 
gales seemed as fearless and as mmch at home as in the heart of the wood.^ 
Even when the trains were in the station, and the passengers passing i 
and out, the birds went on singing without interruption.
The pit isj 
grown over with willows, sallows, hawthorns, &c., with a thick] 
undergrowth of lower shrubs and plants, and seemed a perfect paradis 
for birds ; the variet}^ of them was surprising.
I was very glad to be toL 
that no one ever thinks of molesting them, and this, no doubt, accoun 
for their tameness and numbers.
Of the lepidoptera taken, I ma; 
probably have something to say another time.

Cuckoo near Huddersfield.
— The first cuckoo reported to us 
heard in this district was on Sunday, 2nd May, at Clayton West, by Mr.

also seen the first swallow on same date.

Albino Weasel in Yorkshire.

Chrysomela fulgida.
— In answer to Mr. W.
D. Roebuck, who asks oil 
p. 141, vol.
V. of the Naturalist, April, 1880, for the synonymy of 
Chrysomela fulgida Steph., will you permit me to say that this extremely; 
beautiful local beetle is known in Dr. Sharp's catalogue as Chi-ysomelai 
graminis Linn., GylL, Suffr., dec.
I use the term " local beetle " because

think it will be found recorded.

A Correction.
— The Mickley Ewynchuim striatulum recorded in the 
May number of the Naturalist is a misnomer.
Dr. Spruce does not agree 
with Mr. Boswell, who thought the Mickley moss to be striatulum, but 
says it is B.

I may add that Dr. Spruce throws 
doubt upon the Lincolnshire E.
striatulum even being the true plant, but 
this matter is as yet suh judice.

— In a report of a meeting of the Wakefield 
Field Naturalists, p.
144, vol.
v., (Edemera ccerulea, Linn., is mentioned 
as having been captured at Wetherby by Mr. Roebuck.
That gentleman 
has kindly pointed out the error I made as to the locality, which should 
have been Loversall Quarry, near Doncaster ; and as we all knOAv how 
very desirable it is to have localities, when given, perfectly accurate, and 
the above insect not being a plentiful species, I am anxious, for the benefit 
of your readers who may be concerned, to correct the mistake.

Correction.
— I regret that the dried specimen named Zygodon 
Nowellii, exhibited by me at Huddersfield Scientific Club, and reported 
in last issue, p.
157, was not examined under the microscope previous to 
its being recorded.
A subsequent examination shows it to be only 
Barhula recurvifolia.
A note to the same effect has been received from 
Mr. West, who gathered it, and from Mr. F.

place as to the best means of destroying them.
Mr. Geo.
Jannain gave 
a most interesting lecture, in which he explained a new system of 
decimalizing weights, on somewhat the same principle as Messrs.
J. J.
Griffin and Sons had decimalised the gallon.
In illustration he showed a 
neat series of weights in mahogany box, made to decimals for him by 
Messrs.
Avery of Birmingham.
He shewed clearly the immense advan- 
tages of using them for weighing different materials, especially from 
Continental formulae of dye mixtures, &c.
By his method this could be 
done without the least calculation, whilst now the ordinary English 
artizan is utterl}^ at a loss to translate these formula into ordinary 
British weights.
We believe Mr. Jarmain proposes shortly to bring the 
method thoroughly before the public.

— Mr. James 
Spencer gave a report of the meeting of the Yorkshire Union of Naturalists, 
held on Easter Monday, at Masham, for the Ripon district, and gave a 
short account of the geology of that neighbourhood, exhibiting the 
following fossils from a quarry in the millstone grit rocks, between 
Fountains Abbey and Brimham : — Orthis resupinata, Produdus maritima, 
P. semi-reticulatus, PTiynclionella, Pleurodon, and Belleroplwn costatus, 
which were only a few of the specimens obtained.
Mr. T.
Hirst exhibited 
a pair of French partridges, pair of summer ducks, and pair of teal ducks.
Ramble in the Luddenden Valley.
— The members had a ramble 
through the Luddenden Valley, on 8th May, through Wheatley to Warley 
Edge, and through HoUins Wood.
Owing to the recent cold weather the 
specimens taken were not numerous, and those only of the commoner 
species ; bat the members had a very pleasant and enjoyable excursion.
—Joseph Ogden, Hon. Sec.
Yorkshire Naturalists' Union.
— The second meeting of 1880 was held 
at Malton for the^exploration of Castle Howard and Hildenley, on Whit- 
Monday, the 17th of May, and although not so productive of rarities or 
novelties as was expected, was an interesting and successful meeting.

The Naturalist.
The day ^as brilliantly fine throughout.
The greater number of the 
excursionists alighted at Castle Howard Station, only a few proceeding to 
Malton to inspect the quarries and other sections which abound in the 
immediate vicinity.
The Castle Howard party split up into several groups, 
each led by a local gentleman.
Capt.
Russell was in charge of one party, 
which proceeded by way of Welburn to Castle Howard, where the house 
and grounds were inspected and the route afterwards prolonged through 
the Hildenley Estate, the seat of Sir C.
W. Strickland, Bart., the High 
Sheriff of Yorkshire, to Malton.
Sir Charles, who is himself a good 
geologist and botanist, not only threw open his grounds, but kindly 
allowed his collection of fossils — a very fine one — to be inspected.
The 
grounds contained some noble specimens of coniferous trees, and Hildenley 
wood, a patch of old forest ground, contains some rare plants.
The other 
parties, conducted by jMessrs.
M. B, Slater, H.
Hurtley, S.
King, and 
Chadwick, followed a difi'erent route to Castle Howard, by way of Gilla 
Leys, Crambe Beck Stream, and the Ray Wood, collecting by the way.
One or two of the botanists made a call upon Dr. Spruce, the eminent 
bryologist; at his residence a.t Coneysthorpe.
The party which investigated 
the vicinity of IMalton was entirely geological, and was accompanied by 
IMessrs.
G. Slater, W.
Constable, G.
Edson, and others ; besides examin- 
ing the C[uarries, they had the opportunity of inspecting a collection of 
fossils, which, contributed by some of the Malton collectors, was laid out 
in the meeting-room of the Geological Section.
All parties made their 
way to Malton by about four o'clock, when tea was served at the Talbot 
Hotel.
The sectional meetings were much interfered with by the fact 
that many members, including officers of sections, had to leave by train, 
about five p.m. The general meeting was held in the large room of the 
Literary Institute, and was presided over by the new president, Prof.
W. C.
Williamson, F.R.S., of Manchester, who met with a hearty 
welcome on being introduced to the meeting by Mr. Thos.
Hick, B.A., 
B. Sc.
; the attendance was large, about 70 or 80, including representatives 
of the Ovenden, Bradford (Naturalists' Society and Scientific Association), 
Leeds (Naturalists' Club and Conchological Society), York, Huddersfield 
(Literary and Scientific Society), Driffield (Literary and Scientific Society), 
and Dewsbury Naturalists' Societies.
A vote of thanks to Capt.
Russell, 
Messrs.
H. W.
Pearson, Chadwick, Wm. Constable, and E.
Bamby of 
Malton, ]\Ir. T.
Townsley of Leeds, Mr. J.
Bennett of Bradford, 
Zylr.
John Braim of Pickering, Mr. J.
Whitfield, F.C.S., and Miss Whit- 
field, of Scarborough, !Mr. John Wright of Terrington, and Rev. E.
Maule Cole, vicar of Wetwang, for becoming subscribers to the funds, 
was passed unanimously.
On the motion of Mr. J.
Thrippleton, seconded 
by Mr. Thos.
Hick, B.A,, B.Sc, thanks were voted to Mr. M.
B. Slater 
of Malton, for his services as local secretary ; to Capt.
Russell, Messrs.
W. Constable, H.
Hurtley, George Edson, J" Gibson, jun., S.
Chadwick, 
and G.
Slater, of Malton, for acting as guides and leaders of parties ; to 
Sir C.
W. Strickland, Bart., for permission to visit his grounds ; for 
Reports of Societies.
175 
similar permission for Castle Howard ; and to the committee of the 
Literary Institute for use of rooms.
Mr. G.
T. Porritt, F.L.S., having 
presented a volume of the Linnean Society's Journal to the library, 
thanks were voted for this and some pamphlets presented by other 
members.
Mr. Thomas Hick proposed and Mr. W.
Prest seconded a 
resolution that a memorial be drawn up, and signed by the president, 
congratulating Mr. Darwin upon his having lived long enough to see the 
twenty-first anniversary of the publication of the " Origin of Species," 
and to witness the impetus given thereby to the development of biological 
science.
Prof.
Williamson, saying that he could not have been more 
gratified than by such a resolution being proposed on the first occasion on 
which he occupied the chair, delivered an eloquent tribute to the genius 
of his friend Mr. Darwin, after which the resolution was passed unani- 
mously.
The president, Mr. Hick, and Mr. J.
W. Davis were chosen as 
the sub-committee to draft the memorial, to submit to a future meeting.
The president then delivered an address, in which he contrasted the 
scientific activity of York and the towns on the coast in the days of John 
Phillips, Wm. Bean, John Williamson and others, with their present 
inactivity, and hoping that the residents of the North and East Pidings 
would take up and complete the work begun by their scientific fore- 
ruimers.
The reports of Sections were then taken.
Mr. James Spencer, 
secretary of the Geological Section, having left, his report was taken as 
read.
It stated that Malton is situated on the coralline oolite, which is 
well exposed in the neighbourhood in quarries and cuttings.
The rock is 
generally a cream-coloured coarse-grained limestone, but varies consider- 
ably, sometimes passing into a sandy freestone, used for building 
purposes, and sometimes becomes very hard and flinty.
In a lime quarry 
at Old Malton were obtained many fossils, including a species of the 
spiral Phasionella, CucuUsea, and an ammonite a foot in diameter ; 
another quarry yielded some fish-teeth, whilst a third, in the drift, 
chiefly composed of the debris of local rocks, also furnished some 
travelled boulders.
Interbedded with the drift is a bed of pure 
loamy clay, and in one place, near the surface, what appears to be a 
lacustrine deposit, with many modern shells.
The most interesting 
object furnished by this quarry was a fine neoUthic stone hammer-head, 
about half-way down the face of the deposit.
There can be no doubt 
of the genuineness of this find, but the peculiarity is its being in a deposit 
considered to be of Paleolithic age.
— The Vertebrate Section was not 
represented, and the only observations made were of a numerous colony 
of sand-martins in a quarry near Castle Howard station ; a blindworm 
and young, noted by Mr. W.
Cash, near Castle Howard.
The Concho- 
logical Section was represented by Mr. W.
Cash, F.G.S., president, and 
Mr. J.
Darker Butterell of Beverley, secretary.
They reported that 33 
species had been observed — nine fluviatile, and 24 land-shells — aU of 
them being of the common types.
As, however, very few members of 
this section were present, and a large district had to be rapidly gone 
176 
The Naturalist.
through, the list may be considered satisfactory ; and there is no doubt 
that, if energetically worked, the neighbourhood of Malton will prove 
very productive.
Mr. William Prest, of York, reported for the Entomo- 
logical Section (in the absence of its officers) that the only insects seen at 
Castle Howard were Pieris napi, Anthocharis cardamines, Argynnis 
Euphrosyne, Eupithecia abbreviata, and Micropteryx subpurpurella, the 
results being otherwise nil.
Bees were equally scarce.
He gave a list of 
insects which he had taken at Sandburn during the previous day, 
including Pieris napi, Anthocharis cardamines, EUopia fasciaria (larvae), 
Odontopera bidentata, Crocallis elinguaria (larvae), Tephrosia biundularia, 
T. punctulata, Macaria liturata, Fidonia atomaria, Eupithecia lariciata, 
E. albipunctata, E.
abbreviata, Thera variata (larvae, pupa and imago), 
T. Armaria (larva), Melanippe subtristata, Anticlea badiata.
A, derivata, 
Oonoptera libatrix, Penthina prselongana.
Coccyx hyrciniana, Incurvaria 
masculella, Micropteryx subpurpurella, and Coleophora genist83colella.
For the Botanical Section Mr. F.
Arnold Lees, F.L.S., reported upon 
the flowering plants seen during the day, stating that — partly owing to 
the early date of the excursion, and partly to the paucity of collectors 
present — the number of Phanerogams noted during the day was only 
135, a number smaller than usual .
Of these only seven were worthy of 
special mention, viz : — Ranunculus circinatus (Hutton Mill) ; Actsea 
spicata (Hildenley Wood) ; Geranium pyrenaicum (roadside bank near 
Coneysthorpe) ; Crataegus oxyacanthoides, ThuilL (by Crambeck Bridge) ; 
Myrrhis odorata (several places), and Veronica montana (Gillaleys and 
Lowdy Hill Gill).
Two alien (not native) species were gathered in the 
woods, much of the younger timber in which has been planted — neither 
the beech nor the elm having a claim to be styled aboriginal, albeit 
attaining great perfection at Castle Howard — these two species being 
Geranium phseum and Sambucus racemosa, Willd., an early-flowering 
kind of elder, semi-aborescent, with a globose cyme of yellow-green 
flowers, and pinnate smooth-stalked leaves composed of five leaflets equal 
at the base, the berries being red, — Mr. William West reported for the 
Cryptogamia that the species observed included 60 mosses, the principal of 
which were Seligeria pusilla, Eucladium verticillatum (fr.), Campy- 
lopus flexuosus, Eurhynchium striatum (fr.), Mnium undulatum (fr.), 
Physcomitrium pyriforme (fr.), Hypnum Sommerfelti (fr ), H.
chryso- 
phyllum ; thirteen Hepaticae, the rarer of which were Jungermannia 
Wilsoniana, Cephalozia connivens, C.
multiflora, Calypogeia Sprengellii, 
and Chiloscyphus pallescens ; about ten species of lichens, mostly com- 
mon ; 20 species of fungi, among them being Corticeum coeruleum, 
Trichia chrysus, Nectria episphaeria, Spheeria aquila, S.
acuta, Oidium 
monilioides, Pleurotus septicus, Kummularia Baillardii, Hypoxylon 
fuscum, Puccinia violae, Trichobasis mercurialis, Uromyces Ficariae, 
^cidium albescens, leucospermum, JE.
violae, and ficariae.
A 
number of algae were collected, the best being a green variety of Batra- 
chospermum moniliforme.

merits further investigation another season.

[Thuidium abietinum, L.
Mr. Wesley discovered this, sparingly, 
in an old limestone quarry at Ingbarrow and Kirk Deighton ; 
since I came to reside at Wethe]'by I have noticed it in several 
new localities, in one of which — Jackdaw Crag, near Sutton — it 
is strange it was not noticed long ago, seeing that that quarry, 
and the district about, were well worked by Spruce, Ibbotson, 
and others.
This is assuming, of course, that it was there then, 
the contrary hypothesis opening up a wide and interesting 
inquiry.
I, myself, am disposed to believe it may well have 
originated since, as the locality has altered.
We know it is the 
rule for ground freshly broken up, or turned over, to yield relays 
of vegetation.
Take a 'railway cutting, for example, and we 
know that the first year or two its surface is appropriated by 
coarse annuals, these gradually disappearing and another florula 
taking their place, these again gradually giving way to a third 
type of perennials.
Why not so with an old quarry ?
York 
Minster was partly built of stone quarried from Jackdaw Crag, 
and most certainly for the first few years subsequent to its being 
let alone it is not a matter for doubt that the broken ground 
would yield orchids, gentians, and the usual plants of a recent 
lime-quarry.
Year by year these would grow scarcer, and the 
rocks slowly become moss-clothed ; at first Hypnum serpens, 
lutescens, and chrysophyllum, with other coarse vigorous species, 
prevailing ; and then others, and, finally, yet others.
Now, in 
this quarry, on the weathered and moss-grown rock-faces we 
have several species of a decidedly montane type, and yet I can 
find records of none of these latter in the floras of 1840, 1854, 
and only of one in that of 1862.
I may perhaps be pardoned 
prolonging this digression by proceeding to give illustrations : 
Antennaria dioica, two GoUemas, Frullania Tamarisci, Thuidium 
abietinum, Cylindrothecium concinnum, Tortula tortuosa, Ncclzera 
crispa, Cladonia rangiferina, and — best example of all — the mon- 
tane lichen Endocarpon miniatum may to-day be found occurring 
there.
The Endocarpon occurs nowhere nearer than Malham 
Cove, and being a slow grower, it must have taken well-nigh a 
century to clothe the face of the bare vertical rocks in the 
abundant way it does now.]

Wetherby, 
Dr. Wesley" — C.
P. H., in Jour.
.Bot., Dec, 1879.
I confess to 
not clearly differentiating this from large, distant-leaved infertile 
examples of F.
denticulatum mitil recently, when I became the 
recipient of opinions on the matter from Dr. Spruce and Mr.
Boswell.
Too many moss-lovers, myself amongst them, too often 
fail to give their first and closest attention to the characters 
afforded by the inflorescence.
P. sylvatioum is dioicous ; and, 
apart from its greater rarity than P.
denticiilatiim, in consequence 
fruits less frequently ; though when it does, the long rostrate beak 
of the capsule at once reveals it ; but when without inflorescence it 
is no easy matter to tell one species from the other, Mr. Boswell 
remarks that " sylvaticum may be known by the larger areolae of 
the leaves, by their stronger nerves, and (I presume he means when 
in process of drying) by the shrinking of the foliage," making 
them look more distant.
So far as my observation goes, P.
sylva- 
ticum, when growing, is of a much deeper, richer green (often with 
a tinge of golden-brown in it) than its monoicous double, and in 
drying for the herbarium loses its glossiness, becoming dull and 
opaque, the leaves disposing themselves naturally in two opposite 
ranks with a loss of contiguity.
P. denticulatum varies much, and 
there is a distant-leaved variety, but has evident complanate leaves 
inclined to overlap, their edges recurved, and of a paler green, with 
a high gloss not lost in drying.
The dates given in manuals for 
the fruiting of the respective species need revision.
P. sylvaticum 
is said to fruit in autumn, and denticulatum in spring ; but I have 
seen not over-ripe capsules of P.
sylvaticum — as determined by 
better " authorities " than I lay any claim to be — gathered near 
here and at Castle Howard in February, April, and May of this 
year ; whilst P.
denticulatum is in like good condition at the same 
time about here.
It would be more correct to regard both species 
as summer fruiters, as John Nowell long ago stated.

West !
A pretty little 
moss resembling diminutive chry soph yll urn, monoicous, with, 
cordate-ovate squarrose nerveless leaves ; not new to the Eidingy 
for two records exist of its occurrence long ago to Hooker and 
Brunton, at Weathercote and Studley, but hitherto overlooked by 
compilers, since it is not given either in Carrington's List in 1862, 
or Hobkirk's in Jour.
Bot.
(1873 and 1879).
Mr. Slater informs 
me he has long known it about Malton, chiefly on small stones in 
woods, often growing with H.
serpens.
It is a species which pre- 
eminently illustrates the need of a complete descriptive moss-flora 
for the county or riding, which, by painstaking consultation of 
public herbaria, and the framing of concise differential diagnoses, 
shall be exhaustive of old records, faithfully reflective of recent 
progress, and a finger-post facilitative of future discovery.
The twenty-four additions to Mr. Wesley's List here enumerated 
raise the total number of species known to occur within four miles of 
Wetherby to 146 — i.
e. about 25 per cent, of the known British 
species.
The district shows up badly in the genera Sphagnum, Cam- 
pylop?iS, Grimmia, and Bryum, but must, nevertheless, be considered 
peculiarly rich for an area with little bog and no mountainous tract 
within its limits.

Correction of a Corkection.
— A further and ampler specimen of the 
Hypnoid moss (alluded to in the last number of the Naturalist) having 
been sent me by Dr. Lees, aifords greater facility for study.
It possesses 
one capsule with the operculum thereon, which being conical and not 
beaked, shows it to belong to Brachythecium, and not to Eurynchium ; 
but as the nerve or midrib of the leaf extends to the apex, it must be 
referred to B.
populeum, not plumosum, in which latter the nerve ceases , 
about the middle of the leaf.
The plant, after all, appears to be 
B. populeum, var.
majus, as to which vide ''Schimper's Synopsis." The 
Beta is so slightly rough, that at a first glance it seems smooth.
All this 
offers one more proof of the need for extreme caution in giving names to 
small and imperfect specimens of mosses, for they are very likely to mis- 
lead even a practised observer.
No such specimen should be considered 
safe, if it belongs to an intricate group, till it has been remanded for a 
time, and brought up for a second examination, when it will often be j 
found that some important point was overlooked at first.
As Wilson; 
used to say, "we do not at all times see the same thing with the samei 
eyes." Austin states that B.
populeum plainly passes into j^Zumoswrn," j 
and in uniting the two he is followed by some other American writers ; j 
hut we may demand more proof of its correctness before accepting this | 
dictum as final.
I, at least, have seen no intermediate links.

— Fortnightly meeting, June 12, 
the president (Mr. J.
Varley) in the chair.
— The tables were well covered 
with specimens, the naming and discussion of which occupied the whole 
evening.
In botany the specimens were very numerous, brought chiefly 
by Mr. Varley from the neighbourhood of the Eden, in Cumberland, and 
by Mr. Fisher, from Kirkburton.
The following, among others, were 
noticed : — Orchis Morio, Trifolium filiforme, Geum rivale, Geranium 
molle, Hottonia palustris and Ranunculus aquatilis.
Conchology was 
represented by Helix hispida and Clausilia rugosa.
In entomology Mr.
EUis showed a few choice moths, and Mr. Varley some fine insects from 
Cumberland.

notes communicated by Mr. Moore, of the Museum, who had received 
them, from Mr. Dunkenfield Jones, and illustrated by original diagrams, 
were read, and referred to the metamorphoses of the lepidoptera of 
Brazil, which group of insects Mr. Jones is studying at San Paulo.
The 
Hev. H.
H. Higgins introduced the result of some recent investigations 
into the causes of the persistent dissimilarity between the vernal and 
autumnal broods of the same insects, with special reference to the well- 
known continental examples of Levana and Frorsa.
Investigation was 
invited into the common English double-brooded forms of Napi and 
KapcB, as being likely to throw considerable light upon the origin and 
genesis of all our lepidopterous insects, and would be regarded with much 
interest.
The usual conversazione terminated the meeting, during the 
course of which the following exhibits were made : — Rhaghim bifasciatum, 
by Mr. W.
Gardner ; Acherontia Atropos, by Mr. E.
D. Fish ; CuculUa 
ehamomillce, by Mr. Dixon.

and sedge-warbler.
Thirty-six residents, comprising most of the thrush 
bunting, and linnet families known to Yorkshire (except the winter 
visitors), were noted, and comprised the missel and song thrush, black- 
bird, green and grey linnet, lesser redpoll, magpie, daw, ringdove, 
stockdove, yellow, blackheaded and corn buntings, great tit, marsh tit, 
blue tit, chaffinch, bullfinch, starling, meadow pipit, pied wagtail, wren, 
great-spotted woodpecker, kingfisher, tree sparrow, skylark, lapwing, 
moorhen, coot, Canadian goose, &c.
The Conchological Section was not 
represented, though the shells collected by other members included 
unusually fine examples of Succinea putris taken at Storr Mill.
Messrs.
G. T.
Porritt and John Harrison reported, for Entomological Section, 
that the lepidopterists had done tolerably well, Messrs.
W. Brady, C.
W. 
Richardson, W.
Berry, and others having taken about 24 species.
Nearly 
all the collecting was done in New Park Spring Woods, and Melanippe 
hastata was found there in abundance, with Asthena sylvata, Melanthia 
albicillata, a very dark form of Cidaria russata, Tephrosia biundularia, 
&c., &c.
Mr. John Harrison reported that M.
hastata and A.
sylvata 
were also both very common at Edlington Wood, near Selby, this year.
Mr. C.
P. Hobkirk, F.L.S., reported, for the Botanical Section, that 159 
vascular plants had been seen, the following being the best : — Ranunculus 
Lenormandi, Spergularia rubra, Rosa moUisima, R.
arvensis.
Campanula 
latifolia, Lamium Galeobdolon, Alopecurus agrestis, and Orchis Morio ; 
fifteen mosses, including Aulacomnion androgynum and Brachythecium 
plumosum ; six hepaticae, amongst them being Chiloscyphus polyanthus, 
Jungermannia bicuspidata, and Calypogeia trichomanes ; four species of 
fungi — Stereum hirsutum, Hypholoma fascicularis, Stropharia semi- 
orbicularis, and Sphseria acuta ; three common lichens, and 18 algae, 
including Gomphonema constrictum, Meridion circulare, Melosira 
varians, (Edogonium vesicatum, and Mougeottia genuflexa.
No botanist 
accompanied the Dearne Valley party, hence possibly the paucity of 
plants.
Mr. Jas.
Spencer reported for the Geological Section as follows : 
Bamsley is situated on the middle coal-measures, and yields the usual 
coal-measure fossils — Stigmaria, Sigillaria, Lepipodendra, Calamites, 
Sternbergia, Dadoxylon, Asterophyllites, Pecopteris, Neuropteris, &c., 
together with Anthracosia, Spirorbis, and fish-scales and teeth.
The 
museum of the Barnsley Naturalists' Society contains a good series of the 
above genera ; also a splendid specimen of the rare fossil Limulus, or 
king-crab, and a very fine specimen of the sandstone cast of a Lepido- 
dendron, which is about 5ft.
in length, dividing into two branches about 
the middle.
The main stem is about 1ft., and the branches about 6in.
in diameter.
It is one of the forms commonly called Kjiorria taxina, 
but Prof.
Williamson (our president) has shown that Knorria taxina is 
only one of the difi"erent states of preservation in which the Lepidodendron 
occurs, being a Lepidodendron divested of its outer cortical layer.
B. BROWN, PRINTEE, MARKET PLACE CORNER, HUDDERSFIELD.
POSTPONED at the last moment owing to 
circumstances over which the local Secretaries

REGENT STREET, GLOUCESTER.
THE RISE OF THE LITERATURE OF ENTOMOLOGY.
By Willoughby Gardner.
(Read before the Lancashire and Cheshire Entomological Society, 
April 5th, 1880.) 
The old book I have laid on' the table is, as yon will see, an early 
work on Entomology, and indeed it is the very first work ever 
published on all orders of insects, as a separate volume.
^ It was 
printed at London in the reign of Charles I., a.d. 1634 — two 
hundred and forty-six years ago.
Although I call it the first important 
book on Entomology, it must not be supposed that I mean that there 
was nothing written about insects previous to this book.
The fact is, 
several works prior to this treated of insects amongst other things, 
but were not devoted entirely to them ; others, again, were published 
wholly devoted to certain species, such as hive bees, silk worms, &c.
; 
but this was the first book which treated of Entomology exclusively, 
and which described all orders of insects.
I now propose to give the results of a few notes I have been 
collecting for some time past, on the rise of Entomological Literature, 
hoping to shew its progress from the first notices we find of insects, 
till it arrived at the dignity of a whole Latin folio volume to itself.
Entomology is, comparatively speaking, a young science, not 
esteemed of much consequence till, we may almost say, the commence- 
ment of the present century.
Botany, no doubt on account of its 
close connection with medicine ; and mineralogy, linked as it was 
with chemistry (whose great theme was to find out the far-famed 
" philosopher's stone," which was to turn everything it touched into 
gold) were both studied all through the middle ages, while hardly 
anyone took any notice of Natural History, including Entomology ; 
consequently no books treating of insects are to be found.
But as 
there is an exception to every rule, so we find some few men turning 
their attention to Nature, and even noticing insects briefly in their 
works, though their ideas were necessarily very vague, and many of 
their opinions exceedingly erroneous.
We may even go back past 
the middle ages — past the Roman era — to that great age of arts, 
sciences, and literature — the Grecian, to find the first notice of insects 
recorded.
We cannot now tell who was the first man the world saw 
who condescended to observe and write about insects ; but this we do

The Naturalist.
know, that Aristotle, who wrote more than three centuries before the 
Christian era, took a great deal of his information from previous 
observers, whose names have perished, but some of whose observa- 
tions are included in Aristotle's works ; therefore we must rest 
content to know that some naturalists did exist so far back in time, 
but we can only commence our list of names with Aristotle, the 
tutor of Alexander the Great, who was born in Greece, B.C. 384.
This great philosopher and naturalist wrote, among many other 
works, a " History of Animals," in which he includes all that was 
then known relative to the history of insects.
He is reported to have 
written this book at the express desire of Alexander the Great, who 
encouraged and supported him in a truly royal manner ; for he not 
only supplied him with money for the undertaking to the amount of 
800 talents, but in his Asiatic expedition employed above 1000 men 
to collect animals, which were carefully transmitted to the philospher !
Aristotle in his " History " describes the habits of those species of 
insects most generally known; among Lepidoptera he notices the 
various kinds of Tinece, feeding on wool, fur, books, &c., and one on 
honeycomb — no doubt Galleria cerella ; and he also relates how 
butterflies are produced from caterpillars.
Among the Hymenoptera 
he gives the mode of life and economy of the honey bee, the wild bee, 
the humble bee, the wasp, the hornet, and the ant ; other insects he 
describes are the grasshopper and the locust.
Aristotle does not in 
his work draw up in a tabular form any classification of insects, but 
from his writings we are enabled to gather that he divided them by 
what is called the wing system, making two primaiy divisions, 
the winged and the wingless, and subdividing the former into I 
six, and the latter into two families.
From all this it will be 
seen that Aristotle without doubt paid some attention to the 
insect world ; and though he did certainly entertain some very curious 
ideas on the subject, he was not so ignorant of the truth as is gener- 
ally supposed.
We shall all have often come acress Aristotle's 
theory of the generation of flies, set forth as a sample of his entomo- 
logical knowledge.
He says : — Flies spring from dead animals of 
their own accord" — a popular error even at the present day, though 
more than 2100 years have passed away since Aristotle wrote it ; 
and further, that the flies inherit the nature of the animals from which 
they spring.
Thus, a lion will produce fierce flies which will attack j 
and sting, while inoffensive flies spring from domesticated and peace- 1 
fully inclined animals !
I think all will see that this is not at all a 
fair example to quote, after the list of insects I have given above i 
Gardner ; Rise of the Literature of Entomology.
3 
whose life histories he sketches fairly correctly, and that Aristotle's 
entomological knowledge has been greatly maligned.
Passing from the Greeks to the Romans, the name of Pliny the 
Elder figures as the great naturalist historian.
He was a very ardent 
student of Nature, and wrote several books on Natural History, one 
of which (No. 11) is divided into 23 articles devoted to insects, which 
however treat chiefly on bees ; these he holds as his fixed opinion 
spring from certain flowers.
Pliny met with his death during the 
eruption of Mount Vesuvius, which destroyed Pompeii a.d. 79.
YiRGiL, the great Latin elegiac poet, also wrote on bees, devoting 
the whole of the fourth book of the Georgics to their economy.
Conceruiug their origin he says : 
" From herbs and fragrant flowers 
They cull their young." 
— an idea much more poetical than correct.
Beyond these two writers — with the exception perhaps of 
Columella, who is supposed to have lived in the first century, and 
who in his work on Agriculture devotes some attention to bees, no 
further notice was taken of insects during the Roman era.
After the 
decline of the Roman empire all literature fell to a low ebb in Europe, 
and, excepting by ^lian, Natural History was unnoticed and un- 
thought of for a long period.
tElian, a doctor, was born in Greece in 
the twelfth century, and wrote a " Natural History of Animals," in 
twenty-seven books, containing a short account of insects, which, 
however, did not put forth anything new, merely quoting the opinions 
of Aristotle and Pliny.
Thus we may leap over a very long period, 
extending from the first to the fifteenth century — 1500 years — 
without finding anything new added to the history of Entomology.
With the revival of learning, however, towards the end of the 
middle ages, a few persons resumed the pursuit of Natural History.
Among these the foremost was Conrad Gesner, a man born of poor 
parents at Zurich, a.d. 1516, but who seems to have been the most 
apt and indefatigable of men.
His various biographers are full of 
admiration for his personal qualities, and his learning in all branches 
seems to have been, as Hallam says, " simply prodigious." The same 
author speaks of him as " probably the most comprehensive scholar of 
his age." Gesner wrote on many subjects, yet his fame rests chiefly on 
his almost incredible achievements in Natural History, on which he 
wrote^many volumes, all illustrated by thousands of figures drawn by 
his own hand from specimens in his collection, or executed under his 
own eye by his assistants.
His museum of animals, plants, fossils, 
4 
The NATrp.ALTST.
Szc brougM visitors from all parts, and his correspondence wai5 
carried on with the learned men of every nation.
When we consider 
that he accomplished all this while ohtaining his living as a medical 
man, that he was always of delicate health, and died under fifty years 
of age, his achievements seem tnily wonderful.
He died in the scene 
of his many laborious studies, amongst the objects he had spent his 
lifetime in collecting — being carried at his own request to a couch 
prepared for him in his museum.
Gesner's "Natural History" 
contained all that was previously known relative to the history of 
animals: he filled up many gaps by his own personal observations, 
and thus completed five large folios with merely the Natural History 
of the Yertebrata ; before he reached the Invertebrata, however, death 
carried him off.
a.d. 1505.
Our poor insects were not destined to 
come to the front just yet, for Gesner's posthumous papers on the 
subject fell into the hands of the well-known Joachim Kamerarius, 
with whom we leave them for the present.
About this time several other books on Natural History and 
Botany were published, one or two of which contained some slight 
notices bearing on the objects of our study.
The various books in which we may look with hope of success for 
any mention of insects may be, for convenience, classed under the 
following heads : — 1st, Medical works ; 2nd, General histories of 
various countries, including books of travel ; 3rd, Works on Natural 
HistoiT generally ; and lastly, books on certain species of insects, 
conspicuous for their utility or otherwise.
Under the first head — 
medical— we find many writers noticing insects briefly, mostly how- 
ever in connection with their injurious effects on the bodies which^ 
they wound or sting, and the remedies for such attacks ; and many) 
insects were also then used in medicine.
Chief among such works 
is the "Materia Medica" of Dioscoeides of Anazarba, the first] 
printed edition of whose works was not, however, published till 
Conrad Gesner edited it at Frankfort a.d. 1549.
^ Then followed 
Mathioli's " Materia Medica," first published in fol, at Venice, a.d.,' 
1554.
This great Italian physician was much prone to credulity, yet 
his work was of long reputation.
Also in Jodoc Willich'si 
" Anatomic," ^ published in the same year, we find a dialogue or' 
locusts.
In the next class, including general histories of countries 
and books of travel, we find the works of the great doctor and

naturalist, Pierre Belon, who published a book at Paris a.d. 1554, 
On many singularities and notable things found in Greece"'*; and, 
three years afterguards, a volume — " Portraits of Animals and Birds 
of Arabia and Egypt," ^ — both of which describe the most remark- 
able insects of the countries of which they respectively treat.
Gesner 
has been called the " compiler," and Belon the " observer " of nature ; 
the latter certainly, by his laborious research, made many additions 
to Zoology.
He went on an expedition to the Levant, on purpose to 
collect specimens there.

The Sun Fish.
— A very fine specimen of this was taken ofi" Brighton, 
recently, and is now exhibiting in the porpoise tank in the Aquarium.
It measures between 4ft.
and 5ft.
in length, and weighs nearly 2 cwt.
The Great Atjk.
— Two eggs of the great auk, not previously recorded, 
discovered in an old private collection in Edinburgh, were sold by auction 
recently, by Mr. J.
C. Stevens, of King-street, Covent-garden, one 
fetching 100, and the other 102 guineas.
Dr. Schimper's Herbarium.
— We understand the Baroness Burdett- 
Coutts has purchased the whole of the Cryptogamic Herbarium, and the 
numerous MS.
notes, &c.
, respecting the specimens, from the executors, 
and has presented them to the Royal Herbarium at Kew. We heartily 
congratulate the Kew officials upon this most valuable acquisition.
Apatura Iris.
— Last month I had the pleasure of seeing a nice lot of fine 
healthy larvae of Apatura Iris, beaten out of sallows in the New Forest, 
by a friend : and another lepi-dopterist also showed me a few he had 
beaten out in Monk's Wood.— G.
T. Porritt, July 9th, 1880.
Lohophora viretata m Sutton Park, Birmingham.
— During a short 
stay at Sutton Coldfield, a fortnight or more ago, whilst collecting, I 
captured some pretty little Geometers, which, not knowing jDetter, I 
designated as L.
olivata, though with a strong feeling of indecision in my 
mind.
They were at rest on the trunks of fir trees.
In all these 
specimens, however, the beautiful azure green bloom upon the wings was 
very conspicuous.
I sauntered leisurely up a grassy lane bisecting the 
wood, and there, squatting on some railings, was a similar insect, 
marvellously dissimilar.
My doubts were removed.
Never having cap- 
tured this truly "yellow-barred Brindle," and not having one in my 
collection, I had still a hovering idea as to its identity, and numerical 
position in Newman.
On my return home, Mr. Porritt pro- 
nounced the insect to be L.
viretata.
I took quite a dozen first- 
class specimens, which were soon dispersed amongst Yorkshire 
moth-men.
One word as to the relative value of Sutton Woods 
to entomologists.
The district is a first-class hunting ground, but I 
suppose on Whit-Monday some 15,000 to 20,000 excursionists would be 
Shoet Notes and Queries.

dispersed through the Forest.
The result is obvious — insect depopula- 
tion !
I saw dozens of L.
argiolus (which swarms at Sutton) dying and 
dead, slaughtered by the ruthless "billycocks" of tourists.
The woods 
are free to all comers ; why not reserve a few plantations of this vast 
acreage in the interests of Natural Science 1 The undergrowth is not 
very rich within the woods, but it is widely different to what we find in 
the north.
I found over 30 pupae by digging, but sugar proved a failure, 
only one moth G.
lihatrix, being attracted by the intoxicant.
I took a 
very nice series of E.
lariciata on the wing, and some curious dark T.
crepuscularia amongst other things.

Notodonta dictmoides near B arnsley.
— Whilst collecting on the evening 
of the 21st June last, in Lunn Wood, about three miles from here, I 
secured a specimen of Notodonta dictoeoides.
The moth, which is a fine 
male, was taken at rest on the shooting-box.

Yorkshire Coleoptera.
— I shall be grateful to any reader of your 
valuable magazine who will at any time furnish me with specimens of 
beetles, or notes of captures in Yorkshire, for the benefit of the members 
of the Yorkshire Union of Naturalists, and the better improvement of 
the " Transactions " of that body.

TorUda squarrosa in Derbyshire.
— Being engaged on a list of Derby- 
shire mosses, I am much pleased to be able to add the above rare moss to 
the list.
I gathered the plant a few weeks back near Bakewell, and am 
inclined to believe that it has not hitherto been found so far north.
Of 
course it is barren, as usual.
I enclose a specimen.

Dukinfield, 22nd June, 1880.
The Masham " Hypnum striatuliim.''^ — If Dr. Lees had correctly copied 
the name for this moss, as given him by Dr. Spruce, viz., Hypnum 
popideum, (3 major of Wilson's " Bryol.
Brit.," there would have been no 
need for Mr Boswell's " Correction of a correction " (Naturalist, July, 
1880), for there was no mention whatever of Hypnum plumosum.
The 
moss was gathered by myself and Dr. Lees in Mickley Wood, near 
Masham, on the occasion of the Easter Monday meeting of the 
Naturalists' Union, and Dr. Spruce's note on my fresh specimens is as 
follows :— " The moss you send from Mickley Wood is neither more nor 
less than Hypnum popideum, ^ major ; it has the monoicous inflorescence, 
the slightly scabrous pedicel, the nerve running quite to the end of the 
slender serrulate leaf -point, &c., of that species." — Matthew B.

Remarkable Fungoid Growth.
— About a week ago I saw several 
mushrooms growing out of the joints of a stone wall at Horbury, some

from the ground ; one that I brought away with me was well formed 
I and about two inches in diameter.
This wall had, about eight or nine

years ago, formed one side of a stable, but since that time has been 
utilised as a fence wall to divide two properties.
Taking it for granted 
that the spawn had its origin at the level of stable floor, say eight years 
ago, I think it a notable instance of the tenacity of life the spawn must 
possess, and very remarkable that it should have worked its way for 7ft.

Babnsley Naturalists' Society.
— Meeting, July 6th.
— The entomo- 
logical section reported about 50 species of moths and butterflies, some of 
which, being comparatively rare, were exhibited.
Gulls had been seen 
as early as May 20 ; stragglers generally appear after the breeding 
season ; two were seen by IMr. W.
J. Dandison flying over his house 
June 19 : IMr. T.
Lister observed on July 12 four large gulls wheeling 
about over Cockerham-road, finally disappearing northwards.
Three 
common terns were reported by Mr. E.
Hailstone, over Walton Lake, 
May 28.
It is singular that these sea-birds have been reported by him 
in three different months this year — January, April, and May. Four 
dotterels were shot on the neighbouring moors early in July ; they 
evidently breed in these parts.
A heron was seen flying over the Dearne 
valley to south-west July 10.
Two hawfinches had been received by Mr.
Lister from T.
Dymond, Esq., Burntwood Hall, May 26 — another among 
many instances of their breeding in this part of Yorkshire.
Three pairs 
of nightingales are reported near Wentbridge ; this, with those between 
Ryhni and Nostell, and at New Park Spring, make five pairs.
The 
cuckoo sang distinctly on July 9.
During the Barnsley Naturalists' 
Eeports of Societies.
11 
excursion to Edlington Wood July 12, many birds were noted — as the 
bulliinch, great spotted woodpecker, carrion crow, magpie, and jay, — all 
scarce, from persecution by gun and snare.

July 5th, the president in the chair.
— A good display of the local flora 
included Solanum Dulcamara, Geum urhanum, Valeriana officinalis, 
Corydalis claviculata, &c.
Mr. C.

HuDDEESFiELD Naturalists' Society.
— Meeting 12th July, Mr. J.
Varley in the chair.
— Some very good botanical specimens were 
exhibited, principally by Mr. J.
Armitage, who named them : Bianthus 
deltoides, Lychnis vespertina, Helianthemum vulgare, Geranium lucidum, 
Alchemilla alpina, Anchusa sempervirens, and Laihyrus pratensis.
In 
geology Mr. Jno.
Yarley sent several teeth of an extinct species of shark, 
ventriculites, &c., from the Suffolk crag.
Mr. J.
Robinson gave a short 
paper, entitled " Popular errors of the people in respect of K"atural 
History subjects," saying that ignorance had long fostered beliefs that 
were at entire variance with the truths of Nature.
He showed living 
specimens of the ringed snake {Natrix torquata), the common toad {Bufo 
vidgaris), the common frog {Rana femporaria), and the green tree frog — 
ail of which reptiles have been persecuted almost to extermination in 
some parts of the country.
Yet each of these had its use, and by their 
destruction man destroyed that balance in nature which was so essential 
to the welfare of both the animal and the vegetable kingdom.
Several of 
the feathered tribe had been held in abhorence by farmers and others for 
centuries, as the rook and magpie.
While in some instances these had 
been known to do injury to the growing crops, he maintained that the 
good done by the destruction of worms, grubs, &c., was of inestimably 
greater value.

—385th 
meeting, June 22nd, the president, Mr. B.
Holgate, F.G.S., in chair.
— 
A petition to Parliament was adopted, praying that hawks and owls be 
protected by law.
A note from Mr. H.
Pocklington, F.R.M.S., on the 
breeding of siskins in captivity — an unusual thing — was read.
Mr. W.
Raine gave an account of the nesting of the blackheaded gull at RiccaU 
Common.
Mr. A.
P. Dobson exhibited a fine 8inodend/ron cylindricnm 
from Studley ; Mr. Roebuck, Bhagium inquisitor from New Park Spring, 
Plnsia chrysitis, Xylophasia rurea and other insects from Weeton.
The 
eggs and a juvenile larva of Attacus Atlas were shown by Mr. Henry 
Marsh.
The fly orchis, gathered at Burton Leonard limekilns by Mr. C.
Blenckhom, was shown on his behalf.
Mr. J.

388th MEETiJfG, July 13th, the president in the chair.
— Mr. John 
Kirby showed a specimen of Indian shrew known by the name of "musk 
rat " {ISorex indica) and described its habit and odoriferous properties from 
personal observation at Kurrachee.
Bird-skins collected in Eastern and 
Central Africa by the late Rev. VV.
Dodgshun, a former member, were 
shown.
Mr. W.
B. Turner, F.C.S , F.R.M.S., showed slides of the male 
^at {Culex pipiens), the marsh fly {Tetanocera aratoria), and the sheep 
tick {Melophagus ovinus).
Common local insects were shown by various 
members.
Mr. W.
H. Taylor exhibited a branch of aspen, showing the 
mode of life of Saperda popidnea ; also a full-grown larva of Bo-yophila 
perla, which he had found "feeding on the stone wall " of Roundhay 
Park, and straightway took into custody for damage to Corporation 
property.
Leeds Geological Association.
— On June 19th an excursion was 
made in connection with the Society to Guiseley, under the leadership of 
Mr. W.
Cheetham, v.
p. On arrival at Guiseley, a heavy thunderstorm 
prevented immediate action, but when it had somewhat abated the party 
proceeded to investigate the various geological features of the district.
In a sandstone quarry at Esholt Springs the strata were noticed to be 
very much broken and shattered in consequence of the close proximity of 
a, fault, a good section of which is exhibited in the railway cutting a few 
yards beyond, having a down-throw to the north — the rough rock, orj 
millstone grit, being faulted against the Halifax soft coal bed.
Nearj 
JEsholt J unction another fault is recognised, having a downfall to the 
-south.
The whole line of fault is consequently what is termed a ' ' truugh 
fault.
" At the sandstone quarry before mentioned, near Esholt Springs, 
large concretionary masses are exhibited in the face of the rock.

where the strata are much broken, and there has heen a passage for water 
to force its way through them, this is not an unusual occurrence.
A 
portion of the rock here also contains deep impressions of some kinds of 
fruit which have the effect of causing it to split into laminae or flags.
The 
stone obtained in this quarry is only fit for paving purposes.
The strata 
at the Guiseley end of the Esholt railway tunnel are composed of shales 
and coal seams, whilst at the Bradford end (a distance af about a quarter 
of a mile only) they consist of Haslingdon flagstones, and dip towards the 
entrance of the tunnel.
The top of the tunnel is capped with rough rock 
or millstone grit, beneath which is the Haslingdon flagstone.
A search 
amongst the material taken out in the excavation of this tunnel yielded 
several fair specimens of Goniatites.
It might be worthy of remark here, 
that when the tunnel was being excavated, a large quantity of ice- 
scratched stones were observed, some of them having apparently 
travelled a great distance.
In the railway between Guiseley and Shipley, 
the 36yds.
band coal four inches thick was observed.

— The monthly meeting on the 
21st June proved more than usually interesting, on account of the 
numerous and interesting species of mosses laid upon the table, for the 
most part recently collected at Malham and Littondale, in Yorkshire, by 
Mr. Cunliffe.
Amongst them were fine fruiting examples of Cinclidium 
stygium, which Mr. Cunliffe distributed.
There were also recently 
collected specimens from that botanical paradise.
Miller's Dale, which 
would be too numerous to name in a brief report, but amongst them may 
be mentioned the minute Seligeria pusilla and S.
acntifolia, and 
Gymnostomum tortile, G.
microstomum, and Anomodon viticulosus, all in 
fruiting condition.
But the rarest and most interesting species was the 
Seligeria tristicha, which had been discovered growing there in May by 
Mr. Cunliffe, this being only the second recorded locality in England.
Tho specimens exhibited by Mr. Cvmliffe were in fine condition, and 
mounted for microscopic examination in his well-known style ; and the 
members present congratulated him on finding so rare a moss in a 
district so well worked as Miller's Dale.
Mr. Percival reported that the 
ground where he and the honorary secretary some few years ago had 
found fruiting specimens of the very rare British moss Bi yum neodamense, 
at Southport, had now become quite grown over with other species, and 
this moss was nearly extinct.
Mr. Percival, however, brought away 
specimens of Mnium affine, var.
elodes, growing near the same place.
Mr. John Whitehead, the late president of the Society, having resigned, 
it was suggested by Mr. Thomas Brittain, vice- president (who was in the 
chain) that Dr. B.
Carrington should be invited to take the office of 
president.
This was cordially accepted by Dr. Carrington, who was 
unanmously elected accordingly, and read from the chair an interesting 
memoir of the life of Mr. Coe F.
Austin, the eminent American bryolo- 
14 
The Na^turaltst.
gist, who died in March last, after having made known and added about 
180 new species of mosses and hepatics to the American flora.
It was 
suggested that at some future time Dr. Carrington's memoir of Mr.
Austin's life might be printed in full.
OvENDEN Naturalists' Society.
— Monthly meeting, 5th June, Mr. T.
Scott, V.
p. , in the chair.
— The following botanical specimens, collected 
during the day in the Shibden valley, were exhibited : — Stellaria media, 
Myosotis pahistris, Caltha palustris, Myrrhis odorata, Pedicularis sylvatica, 
Lysimachia vulgaris, Viola palustris, and Paris quadrifolia ; of ferns, 
Polypodium vulgare and P.
phegopteris.
Meeting July 3rd, Mr. Scott, v.
p., in the chair.
— During the day the 
members had a ramble, but owing to the unsettled state of the weather, 
few botanical specimens were obtained, those gathered being Veronica 
montana, Lotus corniculatus, and Trientalis europea ; of mosses, Tortula 
muralis, Thamnium alopecurum, Didymodon ruhellus, Bryum nutans, and 
B. capillare.
Mr. T.
Hirst exhibited the scarlet ibis, bee eaters, and a 
case containing the male and female of the summer duck, and teal.

Yorkshire Naturalists' Union.
— The fourth meeting for 1880 was 
held at Boston Spa, on July 14th.
The weather was very unfavourable, 
and, in consequence, but a part of the programme as to conducted 
parties, &c., outlined in the unusually full circular issued could be 
carried out.
Seven adventurous bryologists, guided by Dr. Lees, never- 
theless visited Aketon Bog near SpofForth, and St. Helen's and Jackson's 
quarries near Deighton, at the cost of a thorough drenching ; and Mr. J.
Emmett drove a small party to Bramham Park, but had to leave Jackdaw 
Crag and Black Fen unvisited.
Some microscopists walked from Thorn er 
by way of Terry Lug, Wothersome Pool, and the Bramham Park fish- 
ponds — in one of these, Volvox globator being found by Mr. Emsley, the 
discovery of the day, and probably the only gathering of any rarity 
resulting from the excursion, which was not mentioned in the circular as 
already known for the district.
At five o'clock, at the Royal Hotel, after 
tea, the sectional consultations were held, followed at six o'clock by the 
general meeting, which, in the absence of Prof.
Williamson, was presided 
over by Dr. Lees, F.L.S. Only nine societies had representatives 
present.
The business before the meeting was lengthier than usual, and 
it is to be regretted that perfect unanimity did not prevail.
Thanks for 
new subscriptions from the Rev. J.
Challoner, Messrs.
Ormerod, Hugh, 
Gill, and others, having been given, the customary vote to the gentlemen 
(Col. Holden and Geo. Lane Fox, Esq.,) who gave permission for their 
estates to be traversed, was unanimously accorded ; coupled with which 
were similar acknowledgments for the services of the local secretaries, 
whose good intentions were rendered impossible of performance by the 
heavy rain.
No district could well be richer in interest to the naturalist, 
nor better repay a second visit from the Union under happier circums- 
Reports of Societies.
15 
tances.
The chairman read an interesting commiinication from the Rev.
J. Challoner, relative mainly to ornithology, and specially to a duck of 
his that had recently assumed the plumage and colouring of a drake — a 
mallard ; an occurrence almost unique, or at least much rarer than the 
contrary change.
He also drew attention to the fact that seams of copper 
had been found in a quarry near Newton, haematite iron at CoUingham, 
and some curious elliptic-ovoid stones (pyritic '?) in the bed of the Wharfe 
at Woodhall.
On the motion of JVIr. Roebuck, seconded by Mr. Clarke, 
the fungus foray contemplated for next October was postponed indefi- 
nitely, after various expressions of regret, and a suggestion from Mr.
Cheesman that the Market- Weighton field day be given up instead, on an 
explanation by Mr, Roebuck that funds were insufiicient for the purpose 
of a seventh (supplementary) and more-than-ordinarily costly meeting, 
unless indeed the " Transactions " (which it is the grand feature of the 
Union to furnish the subscribers with yearly) were to be curtailed — a 
very undesirable alternative .
The next business on the paper concerned 
the memorial address to Dr. Charles Darwin, F.R.S., proposed and 
carried at the Malton meeting, and to draw up which a sub-committee 
was then and there appointed.
A draft drawn up by hmiself, Prof.
Williamson, and Mr. J.
W. Davis, was then read by ]\Ir. Thomas Hick, 
B.A., B.
Sc., and presented to the meeting for endorsement.
Its 
adoption was proposed by Mr. Slater, and seconded by Mr. West.
An 
amendment proposing to postpone consideration of the question, on the 
ground of the meeting being a small and therefore somewhat unrepre- 
sentative one, was lost upon a point of order, the Malton meeting having 
decided unanimously that an address should be presented.
An amend- 
ment involving a rejection of the draft, was next moved by Mr. Emmet, 
seconded by Mr. Gill, and supported by the Rev. W.
Fowler, M.A., 
mainly upon the objection that, whilst all members of the Union must 
necessarily have the highest admiration of Dr. Darwin's talents as a 
naturalist, some of them could not accept his conclusions as regarded his 
evolution " theory ; and, further, that to present a complimentary 
address to any one for such a' special work as the Origin of Species," 
involving acceptance of the teachings formulated^ was beyond the province 
of a Union composed of working JSTaturalists holding diverse opinions, 
bonded together for a specific purpose alone, viz.— the investigation of 
facts in local Natural History.
With respect to whether or not the 
adoption of the address pledged the Union to endorsement of the 
Darwinian view of bio-genesis, &c., the Rev. W.
Fowler, M.A., remarked 
that he freely admitted the felicitous wording and altogether admirable 
character of the address, viewed from the standpoint of those who 
beheved in the doctrine enunciated by Dr. Darwin ; but that he, for one, 
dissented wholly from the conclusions of which he held the address 
approved by its eulogy ; and to congratulate an author on the fact of a 
certain work having attained its majority, and placed its argument on a 
permanent scientific basis — if that basis were dissented from — seemed but 
16 
The Naturalist.
a poor compliment.
Mr. Emmet's amendment was, however, lost, several 
members not voting ; and the original motion that the address as drafted 
be endorsed, was put to the meeting and carried.
The time left for 
making sectional reports was now limited, and such as were presented 
were very brief.
The weather had alike prevented attendance and 
hindered investigation.
No Geological Report was made, and, beyond 
viewing the upper limestone and Plumpton grit in juxtaposition at St.
Helen's quarry, little had been seen.
The Entomological tale was soon 
told: a few ''blues" (Polyommatus alexis) and a five-spot burnet 
(Z.
Lonicerse), none the better for their bath, seen at rest upon grass 
culms, and a few common Geometrse disturbed from the bushes, made 
a miserable total that afforded no index of the insect productions of the 
district.
Neither the president nor secretary of the Conchological 
Section was present, but Succinea putris, Pisidium cinereum, Planorbis 
spirorbis, and Clausiha rugosa were reported, amongst others, as having 
been gathered.
For the Botanical Section Dr. Lees observed that only a 
portion of the route it had been planned to travel had been actually 
traversed.
Amongst plants (not localised in the circular) at present 
blooming in the district may be mentioned Hyoscyamus niger (CoUing- 
ham), Orobanche minor (Collingham bank), Scirpus multicaulis (White 
Carr wood), Glyceria plicata (bog below Etchell Crags), Verbena offici- 
nalis (Wetherby), Rhamnus Frangula (Moss Carrs and Wharton Spring 
wood), and Epichloe typhina (Aketon Bog) — the last a well-named 
microscopic fungus infesting grass sheaths, and mimicking on a small 
scale the reedmace of our ponds.
Mr. Slater reported having seen several 
rare mosses ; the localities of all, however, have already appeared in the 
Naturalist.
Amongst the liverworts, Scapania nemorosa and Junger- 
mannia affinis, Wilson ( turbinata E-addi), had been gathered in Jackson's 
quarry, Deighton.
Of algse, Yolvox globator, Chroolepus aureum, 
Nostoc commune, and Lemania fluviatilis were the chief species observed.
Altogether, unpropitious as the elements proved, 362 species of plants 
were registered : 280 phanerogams and vasculares, 56 mosses, 8 hepaticai, 
8 lichens, 4 fungi, and 6 algse.
For Vertebrate Zoology Mr. Clarke 
reported that not alone from the conformation of the district, but also 
from certain information received, he felt considerable doubt respecting 
the " category of citizenship " — native or alien — in which to class the 
badger killed under a tree at Bramham in 1880.
It appears that a pair 
were imported into the district, not long ago, from Wentworth ; of these 
the female was killed, and the male escaped into the woods.
The weight 
of this was known, and it was a male of not incompatible bulk which was 
some time later shot by Mr. Fox's head keeper, in a situation most 
unlikely for a wild badger to take shelter in.
A nest of the sedge 
warbler (with eggs) was observed by Bardsey pool.
This concluded the 
meeting.
At the Marsden gathering on August 2nd, the form (whether 
engrossed on vellum or otherwise) the Darwinian memorial shall take, ; 
will come up for decision.
' 
WITH THE YOEKSHIRE NATDRALISTS," 
[Eeprmted from the " Huddersfield Weekly News,^^ 
Av^ust 7th, 1880.] 
The fifth meetingr and excursion for 1880 in connection 
with the Yorkshire Naturalists' Union took place on Mon- 
day last.
I was favoured with an invitation, and as it 
may not be generally known what naturalists do on their 
excursions, an account of what took place may not be un- 
interesting.
I must confess that I joined the party in 
fear and trembling.
There are only two conventional 
ideas of a naturalist.
One is that of a wizened old Dryas- 
dust, with goggle eyes and a skin the colour of lemon and 
the texture of parchment, who prowls about stagnant 
pools carching water-newts, and for whom little sympathy 
is felt (by unnatnralists) as 
He got hold of her tail, and to land almost brought her, 
When he plump'd head and heels into fifteen feet water.
The other accepted notion of a naturalist is precisely 
similar to the last one but of the feminine gender.
So far 
as Yorkshire naturalists, at any rate, are concerned, 
however, there could not be a greater misconception.
Genial and jolly, full of spirits, rich in the glow of 
health, and merry as the sunshine, it is evident that the 
studies they pursue are a pleasure to them, and that these 
scientific excursions are their delight.
They speak 
scientifically, of course, and an uninitiated person is 
somewhat taken aback when he hears the veins 
in a leaf described as " isolated fibrovascnlar bundles '' 
or a stinging nettle called an ' Urtica dioica." But one 
soon gets used to this kind of thing, and, as poets often tell 
us, we may enjoy all the beauties of Nature without 
knowing the name of a rock or a fiower.
By what narne 
Botanic, ye are known, 
I care not ; you're the same — 
In glory garmented — each in your own ; 
And. God's benignant mercy to his creatures 
Speaks out in all your fascinating features.
But it must be remembered that scientific names appeal 
not only to Englishmen but to all the world, and are not 
2 " With the Yorkshire Naturalists'' 
merely names but descriptions.
It would be as well, too, 
if the general public copied men of science ia this respect, 
and were a little more exact in the way they speak of 
things.
We should not then find such blunders made as 
calling a whale a "fish or as by the asthmatical old lady 
who complained that where she lived there were "equinoctial 
gales all the year round." 
The Huddersfield contingent of the Yorkshire Naturalist 
Union assembled at the Huddersfield Station to meet the 
train due from Leeds at 10-10 a.m., when tbey joined 
their brother naturalists from Leeds, Harrogate, and other 
parts of Yorkshire and went on with them to Greenfield.
Other batches of the human species, and belonging to the 
same Yorkshire Union, were already on their way to other 
parts of Yorkshire.
Some were traversing Crosland Moor, 
Honley woods, Meltham, and Deerhill, conducted by 
Mr. S.
L. Mosley, of Primrose Hill.
Others went to 
Holmhrth, thence by Ford Inn, visiting the site of the 
buried forest discovered four years ago, over Harden Moss 
to Wessenden Head.
Mr. J.
W. Davis, F.G. S., of Chevinedge, 
near Halifax, made a tour all by himself by train from 
Elland to Huddersfield, where he observed several specimens 
of perambulating humanity on the platform, which he duly 
examined, and then proceeded (by train) to Marsden, to 
await the arrival, in due course, at Blake Lee, of all the 
other little armies of natnralists that were scaling the hills 
and invading the valleys in every direction.
I accompanied 
the Greenfield detachment, which numbered twecty-two.
At Greenfield station we were met by Mr. J.
Hirst, of 
Saddleworth, who had kindly consented to act as guide.
A more fortunate selection could not have been made.
Mr.
Hirst has made a special study of the whole neighbour- 
hood.
He had something to say, not only about every pro- 
minent feature in the district, but about every jutting 
rock, every dell, every road, and almost every field.
No 
sooner had the ascent began from Greenfield station by a 
bye-lane leading to Bill's o' Jacks, than ha drew attention 
to the boulders wbich are seen on tbe sides of the road, 
and embedded in the road itself.
These, he said, were 
foreign metamorphic boulders, and he particularly wished 
the limit, i.e., where they ceased to be found, to be 
noticed, and this was done, and doubtless the geological 
section of the Union will take the hint and inquire into 
the particulars of the glacial action which has caused 
the travelling boulders to so suddenly stop in their 
career.
Near this boulder limit Mr. Hirst drew atten- 
tion to Wharmton Tor, the peculiarity being that it is 
the most northerly peak in this district known as a Tor, 
the word usually applying to the conical hills in the 
southern counties.
The names of the places, too, showed 
what had been the nature of the country in days gone by, 
as, far on the horizon's verge was "Hart's" head, and 
" With the Yorkshire Naturalists:' 3 
the spot on which we were standing was '* Hawk's '' yard 
Mr. Hirst also pointed out the nature of the rock in the 
neighbourhood, which he said he now believed to be 
Yoredale shale.
In conversation of this kind we strolled towards Bill's 
o' Jack's, each member of the party looking after his own 
speciality.
Now it was a particular kind of moss that 
attracted the attention of Mi. C.
P. Hobkirk, or a fern 
with a big long name that delighted Mr. Thomas Hick ; 
or Mr. G.
T. Porritt had fallen in love with a rare 
caterpillar; or Mr. Prince would tell the name of a 
bird, where it had come from, where it was going, and 
what its business was, while Mr. Conacher searched dili- 
gently for shells ; so that hardly a stone or a bird, or 
a flower, or an insect was seen witbout its history, and its 
uses being talked about and discussed.
Arrived at Bill's o' Jacks, the party rested for a short 
time to enjoy the scenery, which was all the more beautiful 
because lie up with the glory of sunshine.
An old poet 
has sung : — 
" The sun when he hath spread his rays, 
And shown his face ten thousand ways.
Ten thousand things do then begin 
To show the life that they are in.
The heaven shows lively art and hue 
Of sundry shapes and colours new, 
And laughs upon the earth." 
And so on.
So it was on Monday.
The sun was in his 
glory, and Irom amid the witchery of a soft blue sky 
peered through the soft fleecy whiteness of silent clouds, 
upon a magnificent panorama.
The majestic sweep of 
the hills, in verdure clad, and, it is no hyperbole to say, in 
strength arrayed, stretched as far as the eye cnuld reach, or 
until but dimly visible in the blue haziness of the distance, 
through whicb glittered like crystal the silver streaks of 
the mountain rills.
Even such a common-place thing as 
a reservoir in course of construction by real navvies in real 
corduroys, looked picturesque in the verdant bosam of the 
Greenfield valley ; surrounded on all sides by hills decked 
with the heath with its full-round bells of brilliant pink, 
the less pretentious heather, and the orange-blush leaves 
of the bush of the bilberry.
It was a day on which all 
nature was filled with gladness, and the earth and the 
heavens, the fields and the hills, were joying with an 
exceeding great joy.
Leaving the well-known rustic inn already mentioned, 
we began a short but steep ascent in order to reach the 
moors.
It was tough work for the shoulders and knees, 
and many a one stopped — of course, not for rest — but to 
look at the beautiful landscape and to exclaim, or rather 
to sigh as well as their gasps would allow them, " What — 
a— splendid — view !" Here we encountered a specimen of 
4 Wiih the Yorkshire Naturalists r 
the adolescentula decepta, whose special function may be 
described as vara spe allicere.
" Yo look wairm," said the 
specimen.
''No wonder 1' said a naturalist.
"Well," 
added the specimen, " I ha gotten summut in a bottle 'ere, 
wad yo loike to sup." "Yes, yes," eagerly answered a 
dczan naturalists.
" Well then," replied the adoles- 
centula, " noan on yo shall hev a drop " — and she 
went on her way rejoicing.
So on we tramped across 
the moor, looking out for the game-keepers who 
were looking out for us ; knowing it was near the 
" twelfth of August," and knowing, too, that some of 
our party had been turned back in attempting a moor 
on which it was known were some specimens of the 
rare Malaxis paludosa.
S)on we came in sight, far cff, 
sleeping silently, nestling amid hills where the heavens 
kiss the earth, of the town of Oldham, with its tall 
mill chimneys, its grey church tower, and its hazy 
canopy of soft smoke.
We gave it a passing glance, 
as not belonging to us, because Lancashire, to York- 
shire naturalists is (on these occasions) forbidden ground.
So we passed on, leaving S^ddleworth Church to the 
left, and making towards Digs:le.
Mr. Hirst shewed 
US en route the effects of denudation in modern times 
— the best instance in this neighbourhood.
The cattle 
tracks which have had to be made higher and higher 
as the denudation has proceeded were distinctly visible, 
as were also some other interesting features about the 
stream which is still carrying on its denuding work.
Near 
this spot, too, Mr. Hirst pointed out to us, far away across 
t he valley, an ancient "verge of the salt sea fl lod." High 
up the mountain there, fifteen hundred feet above the pre- 
sent sea level, was once the ocean, with its tides, its 
beach, its shells (which are still there), and almost every- 
thing just ae it is at Blackpool at present, except that then 
there were no bathing machines, or donkeys, or lodging- 
hcuse keepers, or nigger minstrels.
We then struggled across fields, climbed over walls, and 
at last reached Diggle Mill (where is the largest water- 
wheel in England).
In the stream hard by Mr. Hobkirk 
came across a rather rare moss, the Hypnum cordifolium ; 
and others amused themselves with the echo at the outlet 
of the reservoir.
We proceeded along South Clough, where 
are cart-loads of fossils in the shale, chiefly of worm 
tracks.
About here, too, Mr. J.
Dore found several beau- 
tiful specimens of the white heath, a by no means com- 
mon plant in the neighbourhood.
South Clough had to 
be ascended by leaps from rock to rock, and from stone to 
stone.
It is a magnificent cleft in Diggle Moss, down 
which the white waters merrily leap.
Here we rested a 
while and drank of the cool stream, and enjoyed "cur 
'baeca" to the music of the summer torrent's gentle dash.
It was a rest well earned, and what with the splendour of 
" with the Yorkshire Naturalists:' 5 
the sky above ns, and the glory of the scene around us, it 
is perhaps not surprising that a naturalist grew ssnti- 
mental, and showed me a scrawl at the back of an envelope 
which began 
I stood on the top of a moss-clad hill, 
Where I stood twenty long years ago ; 
I hear the soft dash of the mountain rill 
As it steals to the valley below.
I see the streams as they ling'ring run 
To the lake with its fringe of red rushes, 
Now baring its bosom to the warmth of the sun 
Now in the forest hiding its blushes.
I feel the glow of the heavens above 
And the perfume of the breezes that blow, 
I feel all the life, the glory, the love, 
I felt twenty long years ago.
***** 
No, not all I miss the maid with the soft blue eye 
And cheeks tinged with the loveliest hue.
I miss the lips so tremblingly shy 
I kissed — 
I interrupted by asking my friend if he had ever seen a 
'  moss-clad hill,'' on which he folded up his scrawl, and 
said I should read it when it had got the finishing touches 
to it.
Leaving this delightful spot, which, as was said of it, 
as well as of a fine ragged peak near Greenfleid, would 
be an attraction to visitors for miles round if situat-ed in a 
place with celebrity as a fashionable resort, like Winder- 
mere, we began the climb to the top of BroadheaJ 
Moss.
The mountain side is rugged and steep —almost 
perpendicular in some places, and the task tried the 
lungs of us all.
It is a hill, too, that delights in 
prac ical jokes, for we often thought that we had 
gained the brow, when really we had only reached a 
ledge that led us to a steeper climb.
However, there 
is an end to everything— even a Lancashire and York- 
shire train arrives at last — and we did, at length, reach 
the top.
We then went across the moor, stepping 
briskly on the black peat, soft and springy as a Turkey 
carpet, and seemingly anything but likely to become a 
bed of coal, which, Mr. J.
W. Davis assured us in the 
evening is its destiny.
A few drops of rain fell here, 
but the cloud soon passed away, though in the distance 
we could see that it was raining in torrents.
We passed 
over Black Moss, and after a walk, or rather a series of 
jumps, of about a mile, over boggy and lumpy ground, we 
found ourselves at Redbrook Reservoir and Standedge, 
whence we v^ent fo Bicike Lee, where the other sections of 
the Naturalists' Union concentrated, and we all made a 
hearty attack upon a substantial tea.
After tea references were made to the programme of the 
proceedings, wtiere was found a glowing description of the 
6 pr/M the Yorkshire Naturalists'' 
lovely spot known as Blake Lee, and which concluded with 
these words, "There is a petrifying well just behind the 
house." "Just behind the house " turned out to be across 
half-a-dczen fields, necessitating climbing over three stone 
walls, and three gates specially spiked to tear one's clothes.
Then one had to stride over a waterfall and seizing hold 
of the end of a wall give a judicious swing to the other 
side, and drop a few feet to the bank of a merry 
gambolling brock.
This had to be crossed by wading, 
and then was reached a grassy bank amid the verdure of 
which was trickling the petrifying water.
This was the 
well : nothing to look at, at first, but which repays exami- 
nation.
The water, strongly impregnated with carbonate 
of iron, percolates the grassy bank, and the result is that 
the whole of it, though locking soft as any other grassy 
bank, is already half turned into ironstone, and is hard as 
rock.
Many of the naturalists brought specimens away, 
as a memento of the one solitary grass bank which, when 
the denudation about it has done its work, will in years 
to ccme be a huge ironstone rock.
We went back to 
Blake Lee by keeping to the banks of the brook, enjoying 
the walk much better than the gate climbing and the 
jumping by the way we took when looking for "just be- 
hind the house." 
In the evening the various sections of the Union held 
meetings, and compared notes as to what had been ob- 
served on the excursions.
Societies from the following 
places were represented : — Huddersfield, Dewsbury, 
Heckmondwike, Ovenden, Elland, Honley, Bradford, 
Leeds, Greetland, Liversedge ; in all fourteen societies 
were represented.
Afterwards there was a general 
meeting, presided over by Professor W.
C. Williamson, 
F.E S., the president of the Uaion.
Some formal resolu- 
tions were duly submitted to the " contest of the eyes and 
nose," and the " ayes" had it all their own way.
Mr. Thos.
Hick, B.A., B.Sc, of Hairogate, was then 
called upon to give the report cf the sub-committee upon 
the address to be presented to Dr. Darwin on the fiftieth 
anniversary of the issue of his great work.
Mr. Hick 
said : G-entlemen, In accordance with the instructions 
given at the Boston Spa meeting, we have considered the 
best form the address should take, and the other matters 
connected with it.
We are prepared to recommend the 
Union to have it printed, or engrossed on a parchment 
sheet, put into a neat Morocco case, and then handed over 
to Dr. Darwin, either by a small deputation, or in some 
other way most convenient to Dr. Darwin himself.
We 
do not think it wise to call upon the Union to pay the cost 
of this, and we have got together a few subscriptions 
which will enable us to get the address up in a neat and 
simple manner worthy of the occasion.
The committee 
have also to suggest that you appoint another committee, 
" With the Yorkshire Natutalists!' 7 
or the same one, to get the address printed, signed by the 
oflScers of the Union, the president, the vice-president, the 
secretaries of sections, the general secretaries, and the com- 
mittee.
Mr. J.
W. Davis, F.L.S., F.G.S.
(Elland) said he still 
wanted a few more subscriptions to defray the cost.
— Professor Williamson remarked that coming as it 
would from a number of working naturalists it would be 
better to have the memorial very neatly drawn up on 
parchment, and put into a proper and appropriate bind- 
ing without any very extraordinary flourishes or displays, 
or more than was absolutely necessary.
Mr. G.
T. Porritt, 
F.L,S.
(Huddersfield), moved, Mr. S.
Bairstow, F.L.S.
(Huddersfield), seconded, and it was carried, that the same 
committee be reappointed to see to the work regarding the 
memorial being carried out.
Mr. George Brook, ter., 
F.L.S.
(Huddersfield), read a list of new subscribers, and, 
on the motion of Mr. Hick, seconded by Mr. E.
F. 
Brook (Huddersfield), thanks were voted to them.
Mr. Davis moved a hearty vote of thanks to Messrs.
Hobkirk and Mosley, and to Mr. John Hirst, of Saddle- 
worth, for their kindness in conducting the parties.
Mr.
Barrett (London) seconded the resolution, and it was 
passed.
The reports of the different sections were then given by 
the different secretaries.
— Mr. S.
D. Bairstow reported as 
to the entomological specimens, which were very few in 
number, but still fully as many as they expected.
— Mr.
Hobkirk reported as to the botanical specimens, which 
numbered 170, including 124 flowering plants, 33 mosses, 
6 fungi, algce, &c.
— Mr. Davis, in the absence of Mr.
Spencer (Leeds), spoke of the geological features of the 
district.
— Mr. Hick said Mr. Hirst pointed out a number 
of shales, which were supposed to be Yoredale rocks.
— 
Professor Williamson said he thought the district should 
be rich in fossil plants, and that what was required was 
that new localities should be opened out and worked.
— 
Mr. Prince, in the absence of Mr. J.
Varley (whose 
absence on account of illness was very much regretted), 
said that twenty-five species of birds had been seen.
A 
song-thrush and nest with young had been found, which 
was recorded as rare at this period of the year.
— Mr, 
CoNAOHER (Huddersfield) reported on conchology, stating 
that the moors were not fertile in shells, and as a 
consequence only six or seven specimens had been found, 
and these were not of a nature requiring special mention.
— 
Mr. W.
D. Roebuck (Leeds) proposed that Mr. Thos.
Lister, of Halifax, be the representative of the Union at 
the next meeting of the British Association.
— Mr. Davis 
seconded the motion, which was carried unanimously.
The rest of the evening was spent in a pleasant chat and 
stroll with Professor Williamson, who is not only a good 
8 ** With the Yorkshire Naturalistsr 
naturalist bnf a good companion.
Thus ended a well- 
spent day.
There can be no doubt that such excursions 
are productiTe of an immense amount of good.
Flowers 
are beautiful for their colours alone, it is true, and the 
landscape is pleasing to the eye, as is the song of the bird 
to the ear ; but the enjoyment is multiplied a thousand 
fold when each boulder on the road, every patch of green 
moss at the water fall, every butteifly that flutters in the 
sunbeam, speaks a volume.
The head as well as the heart 
is then gratified, and how easy, with patience and per- 
severance, it is thus to enjoy " the charms of nature," is 
evident from the fact that everything on the face of 
the earth, in the heavens above the earth, and in the waters 
under the earth, has a lesson to teach to those who are 
willing to learn.
Look for instance at a little daisy I 
Simple and humble as it is.
yet if we peer into its golden 
disc, we see in it one of Nature's most complicated and 
delicate works — a whole head of flowers, each in perfect 
miniature, crowded into a circle of half-an-inch diameter.
The circlet of single blosBom is in reality a thick-set head 
of lovely little bells, clustered thickly together, each with a 
yellow fringe, shaped like a Canterbury Bell.
In the very 
heart of the flower, each tiny fl ixei is still unopened — in 
the bud so to speak — and they stand like little golden 
knobs too small to be courted by the naked eye.
Each 
one is a perfect miniature flower.
Is not all this worth 
knowing ?
Is it not worth while to inquire into the why 
and the wherefore of the arrangement, to learn all about 
the joint effect of incident sunlight, freer elbow room, 
natural selection, and a host of other things that can- 
not be entered upon here ?
Surely it is, and it is in 
this way that flowers, and insects, and birds, and rocks 
should be studied, not simply gazed at ; as well ask the 
blind to enjoy the glories of a sunset, or exhort the deaf 
to drink in the sublime strains of Beethoven, as expect an 
ignoramus thoroughly to enjoy a walk in the country.

REGENT STREET, GLOUCESTER- 
THE RISE OF THE LITERATURE OF ENTOMOLOGY.
By Willoughby Gardner.
(Continued.) 
In the third class, the first book on the list is that of Peucer, 
whose work on " Quadrupeds, Insects, &c.," was fii'st published at 
Leipzig A.D. 1550, and went through many subsequent editions.^ 
Next we find one of our own countrymen, the learned Dr. Wotton, 
publishing at Paris, in 1552, a work on " Natural History,'"'' in 
ten books, dedicated to King Edward VI.
Dr. Wotton subse- 
quently purchased Gesner's posthumous papers on insects, of which 
I spoke above, from Joachim Kamerarius.
Another writer, according 
to Percherou, treats about this time of water insects, viz., Guillaume 
RoNDELET, who published a large folio in 1554 at Lyon, on " Fishes, 
&c."S I cannot say, not having seen the book, whether it contains 
very much of note entomologically, but Rondelet had a great 
knowledge of fishes — so much so, that his work has formed the 
foundation of all subsequent ones on the same subject, and indeed it 
is said that very little of importance has been added, since his work, 
to the natural history of the fishes of the Mediterranean.
In the 
last class we find several small works on various species of insects 
noticeable for their utility, their ravages, or otherwise.
The first is 
a small volume by Chr. Hagendrophinus (^), published a.d. 1526 ; 
the next, in point of time, is by the Latin poet Marcus Hieronimus 
ViDA, who was born at Cremona a.d. 1490 ; he wrote a long poem 
on " The Culture and Use of the Silkworm," (}^) which was first 
published at Rome in 1537, and went through as many as nine 
subsequent editions, thus showing that there was no lack of interest 
in the silkworm at that time.
Then the bees have their turn, for 
GiovANNK RucELLAi, an Italian, filled an 8vo volume with a poem 
describing their economy, which was first published, after his death, 
at Venice, a.d. 1539 Q^) ; this, like the last, was evidently a popular 
work, for it went through five other editions, and we find it said by a 
N. S., Vol. vi.— Sept., 1880.

The Na.tuealist.
contemporary writer that the " Bees," an imitation of the 4th 
Georgic of Virgil, was esteemed " a poem of exquisite sweetness." 
Two years after this (a.d. 1541) we find in volume i.
of a book by 
Erasmus Ebeenerus, a description headed " The Praise of Ants" (i^) 
The next year, a German of the name of Ruscheyt brought out a 
volume Q-^) describing the " Grasshoppers seen in Silesia in 1542 " ; 
two years later, we find a small volume on " Fleas," by Moschetti 
(1*), and in the year 1546 one Ant. Thylesius brought out a book 
on " Spiders and Gloworms." (^^) 
Such was the state of Entomological Literature when Oxford 
University produced a learned student of nature, and more particu- 
larly of the branch in which we are specially interested — Dr. Moufet 
or MuFFET.
This Dr. Muffet (to quote Anthony Wood in his 
Athense Oxoniensis," was " educated in this University" — i.e., 
Oxford — " and afterwards travelled into divers countries in Europe, 
where he became known to the most eminent physicians and chymists 
of that time, and was doctorated in physic in some noted university 
in his travels He became much honored and beloved by 
Peregrine Bertie, Lord "Willoughbie of Eresbie, and esteemed the 
famous ornament of the body of physicians, and the true pattern of 
all polite and solid literature, &c." Such was the man who, far from 
despising entomology, not only deemed it worthy of his attention, but 
even made it the favourite study of his life.
Dr. Muffet wrote several 
books, (^^) but his greatest achievement was undoubtedly his 
" Theatrum Insectorum" This work he probably commenced during 
his travels on the continent, when at the different universities he 
would have access to the numerous books he consulted ; and, as 
Wood says, he became intimate with the most scientific men of his 
time.
I have enumerated above all the notices of insects now 
generally known to exist in printed books at that period ; but Muffet 
in his book gives a list of 406 authors whose writings he had con- 
sulted in compiling his own work.
Many of them I find to be 
(12) Encomium Formicaram, A.mpMtlieatr., Dornanii, t.
1, and with "Melanck- 
tlion " in 4to, Argent,, 1541.
(13) "Walirliaftige Zeitung in ScUesien geschelien, 1542, von unerhorten Heusch-

Gardner : Rise of the Literature of Entomology, 19 
medical writers who rank certain insects among their Materia 
Medica, or on the other hand give receipts for the cure of the baneful 
effects caused by bites and stings ; others, again, are names of well- 
known classical authors — Greek and Latin — who draw similies from 
insects and their economy.
But of a great number I can find no ' 
mention, and I suppose we may conclude that they were possibly only 
M.SS.
which have since perished with the names of their authors also.
I must now digress a little to follow the vicissitudes of Conrad 
Gesner's papers on Entomology.
I mentioned them above as having 
been purchased at his death by Joachim Kamerarius, and afterwards 
falling into the hands of Dr. Wotton, who sent them to a publisher 
in London named Thomas Penn, also a great student of Nature, and 
an observer of insects in particular.
For some reason or other Penn 
did not fulfil his commission, and at his death these poor knocked- 
about papers fell into the hands of Dr. Muffet, who purchased them 
along with some other M.SS.
by Dr. Wotton and T.
Penn, to incor- 
porate with his " Theatrum." We thus see that Thomas Muffet's 
book contains the writings of Gesner, Wotton, and Penn, which he 
weaves together into a tangible form, adding and correcting from the 
authors whose names he enumerates at the commencement of his 
work ; in addition to these, his own observations and those of certain 
entomological friends he seems to have had, form no small part of the 
contents.
Soon after completing his book Dr. Muffet seems to have 
died, leaving it in M.S., in which state it lay for many years almost 
forgotten.
Meanwhile, while Muffet had been writing his book, and after his 
death, numerous other works were published containing more or less 
brief accounts of insects.
These may be divided in the same manner 
as before, to guide us in our search.
In the first class — books on 
medicine — we find insects mentioned by Bauhin, who in 1598 
published a " History of the wonderful Medicinal Spring in the 
Duchy of Wirtemburg, with many Figures of various Insects found 
in the Xeighbourhood." (^^j This Bauhin obtained his greatest fame 
as a botanist ; he and his brother are said to have labored for forty 
years for the advancement of that science.
In the same class of 
books insects are casually treated of by Laurent.
Catelan, a chemist 
(17) Historia admirabilis fontis Bollensis, in ducato "Wirtenburgico,, cum pltirimis 
figuris -variorum Insectarum quae in et circa lianc fontern reperiimtur ; in 4to, 
Blontisbeligardi, 1598 ; in German, in 4to, Stutgarten, 1602.
He also mentions 
iiLsectsin De aquis medicatLs nova methodus, in 4to, Mont., 1605-7-12; and a book 
witk no other title tlian "Vivitur Ingenio caetera mortis eiant treats of insects 
and i>lants.
20 
The Naturalist.
of Moutpellier, (i^) by Angelinus, (i^) and by Bertaldi.
Theodosius, also a learned doctor, in his " Letters on Medicine," 
devotes one to Glow-worms, (^i) The second class, which contains 
histories of countries, includes Castaqueda's large " History of 
Oriental India," (~~) which mentions certain insects, and Schwenk- 
feeld's " Theriotrophium," {^^) in which, according to the title, the 
" nature and use of certain animals, birds, insects, &c., are set forth." 
In the class in which we rank works on Natural History in general — 
No. 3 — we find several works appearing about this time.
The first in 
chronological order is the work of Scaliger, in fifteen books, 
which contains cantharides, bees, silkworms, and locusts.
Next comes 
the large folio Nat. Hist, of Feeraxte Imperato, (^^) and the same 
year we find that most important work on the same subject by Ulysses 
Aldrovaxdus, published in folio at Bologna (^6).
Vol. iv.
of this 
tremendous achievement, which appeared a.d. 1604, contains seven 
books on insects, which recapitulate all that had previously been 
written on the subject; the letter-press is supplemented by very 
numerous illustrations, making it altogether a most important work — 
not, however, a separate publication like Muffet's, but merely a single 
volume of a more comprehensive work.
In the year 1605 Glusius 
(who, as we gather from hints in Muffet's work, was no mean 
entomologist, and himself a personal friend of Muffet's) published a 
" History of Exotic Animals and Plants." (^7) This author, whose 
descriptions are remarkable for exactness and elegance, is most 
generally known to the scientific world as the delineator, in the work 
mentioned above of that curious and now extinct bird, the dodo.

Creation, including insects, found in the Holy Scriptures." Q^)

Bottle-nosed Dolphiw on the Yorkshire Coast.
— My attention has 
I recently been called to two Cetacea which were offered for sale in 
Sheffield, and described by the owner as Grampus whales," caught at 
Spurn Point in September last.
On inspecting them I found they were 
not Grampus whales, but probably the bottle-nosed dolphin Delphinus 
twsio, Fab.,) and as the occurrence of this species is very unfrequent, 
perhaps its appearance on the Yorkshire coast may be worth noting.
In 
order to satisfy myself as to the exact place of capture, I communicated 
with the secretary of the Literary and Philosophical Society of Hull, who 
referred me to Dr. Foster, of that town.
Dr. Foster informs me that 
there were two specimens of the Hyperodoon — one 28ft.
long, a female 
caught ^at the junction of the river Hull with the Humber, and the other 
in Patrington Haven, which communicates also with the Humber.
These 
animals were killed whilst stranded.
The one caught in Patrington 
Haven was denuded of flesh and the bones brought to Hull, Dr. Foster

consenting to superintend their articulation ; and the skeleton afterwards 
passed into the hands of some private individual.
If this cetacean was 
accurately identified as Hyperodoon, only one species of which — known 
as the bottle-head {H.
ButzJcopf, Lacep.) — occurs on our coasts, its 
appearance is very remarkable on account of its extreme rarity.
Dr.
Foster also informs me that five specimens of Grampus were killed a few 
days after these between Kilnsea and Spurn, and I have little doubt that 
the specimens offered to me are a part of this capture.
The following 
description will, I think, show that they are bottle-nosed dolphins : — They 
are both adult specimens, and are 10ft.
and lift, long respectively.
The 
head is produced into a snout, with a distinct forehead 4iin.
from 
snout, the lower jaw projecting a little beyond upper; blowhole 
crescentic, 16in.
from end of snout, and with a flattened and somewhat 
hollow space for six inches behind it.
Teeth ^ conical and sHghtly 
incurved ; eye at side, in line with gape and immediately beneath 
blowhole.

Pectoral fin 25in.

edge ; length of gape 14 inches ; tail 23in.
wide, pointed at each end, 
but without any decided notch.
On the other hand, an adult Grampus 
measures about 21ft.
in length, has only about eleven teeth on each 
side of each jaw ; the head is blunt, and not produced into a snout, 
and has no distinct forehead.
Another cetacean, a young specimen of 
the northern rorqual {Balmnoptera hoops, Flem.) 16ft.
long, caught at 
Bridlington April 5th, 1880, has recently been exhibited in Sheffield.

Malformation op the Rook's Beak.
— While examining a private 
collection of birds belonging to Mr. Matthewman, of Selby, I was shown 
a singular freak in the beak of the rook.
The lower mandible was of the 
usual size and shape, but the upper mandible was as long again as the 
lower one, and curved downwards after the manner of the curlew's beak, 
which gave the bird a very singular appearance.
It was shot near 
Selby.— Walter Raikb, Leeds.— [We know of other maKormations in 
the beak of the rook ; in one case the mandibles cross each other in the 
same way that those of the crossbill do, but to a greater extent.—

Polecat near Leeds.
— Last February, my friend Mr. Harrison and 
myseK had the good fortune to see a polecat at the Seven Arches, near 
Adel.
We disturbed it from under the root of a tree, near the stream 
that runs under the arches.
We should not have noticed it, had it not 
attracted our attention by its cries.
The polecat is a very scarce animal 
in the neighbourhood, for, being great enemies to the gamekeepers, they

do all they can to destroy them.
They are often found, like the stoat, to 
be minus a leg, for if caught in a trap by the leg, they frequently release 
themselves by biting off the leg close to the trap, thus enabling them to 
escape.
A stoat that was caught in this way a short time ago only 
possessed one leg, having had to sacrifice the other three to save its life.
It is a pity that this martyr of a stoat's life was not spared, as it could 
not have done much harm in the way of destroying game, and would have 
to be contented with mice, rats, worms, &c., for its diet.
I have lately 
obtained a fine pair of weasels wiiich were caught by a cat at Ryther.
Both stoats and weasels are rather plentiful in the rocky neighbourhood 
of Adel, but the place where they are to be seen in greatest numbers is at 
Bishop's Wood, near Selby, where on my last visit I counted above 200 
specimens hung up at the storekeeper's museum.

August 13th.
Captures in the New Forest.
— I had a few days at Brockenhurst last 
week.
Larvae were very plentiful, and included Lithosia quadra, JDemas 
coryli, Cleora glabraria, Nola strigula, Notodonta i/i^epida, chaonia and 
dodonoea, Cymatophora ridens and flavicornis, Liparis monacha, Trachcea 
piniperda, Ennomos erosaria and tiliaria, and many other commoner 
species.
Of imagos I took Limenitis Sibylla, Argynnis Valezina (5), 
Adippe and Selene, Pieris cratcegi (one worn-out specimen), Lyccena 
^gon, Macaria alUrnata (a worn female specimen), Eupithecia succentu- 
riata, Emmelesia alchemillata, Cidaria picata, Melariippe rivata and 
unangidata, Zygcena meliloti, Eulepia crihrum, Lithosia mesomella, &c.
I also saw three empty chrysalis cases of Apatura Iris found by other 
collectors, two on one twig of narrow-leaved sallow, the third by a lady 
close to where I was standing, in New Park enclosure.

Polypogon monspeliensis near Leeds.
— IMr. Jas.
Abbott showed to the 
Leeds Naturalists' Club, on the 17th of August, specimens of tliis grass, 
which is only found native in damp positions on the south-east coast.
He had found them on rubbish heaps by a roadside near Leeds, where it 
had no doubt sprung up from seeds casually introduced.
Dr. Lees has 
no previous record for Leeds, but Mr. Hobkirk has recorded it in his 
" Natural History of Huddersfield " as occurring near that town under 
similar suspicious circumstances more than once.
It is an alien, casually 
introduced, and as it is an annual there is no certainty of its springing up 
again in the same spot.
IMr. Abbott refrained from mentioning the 
exact spot, in order to give the remaining plants a chance of perfecting 
and depositing their seed.

— Meeting Aug. 17th, the president, 
Mr. T.
Lister, in the chair.
— The following amongst other species of moths 
were exhibited : — Urapteryx samhucata, Pericallia syringaria, Emmelesia 
alchemillata, dncania, iithargyria, Ahrostola triplasia, and Plusia chrysitis.
In an excursion to Langsett five magpies were seen at Brockholes, the same 
place where the curious facts about the snipe and cuckoo were reported 
by Mr. W.
Dransfield.
A haK-fledged snipe taken from a retriever, was 
fed by the keeper's wife on bits of rabbit and raw flesh, which it would 
take from the hand, and dip its long bill into a deep plate filled with soil, 
and might have grown to maturity to throw light on the questions of 
natural and acquired habits, so much talked about in these days, but it 
met the usual fate of favourites — perishing from accidental neglect in the 
absence of the family.
A titlark's nest, with its sole occupant a young 
cuckoo, was pointed out by his setter.
It was replaced, to the satisfaction 
of its foster parents.
Mr. Creighton reported a cuckoo fed by pied wag- 
tails at Hemsworth ; also the pied fly-catcher and young at that place — 
another locality for this scarce migrant, which has been chiefly noted at 
Wentworth Castle and Cannon Hall.
A note from Mr. E.
Hailstone 
states that on August 7th three terns, or sea swallows, were for a 
short time over Walton Lake, where all birds are protected as in 
Waterton's time.
He has reported the tern in four diflerent months this 
year — a curious fact as regards these "dwellers by the pathless deep." 
Mr. Lister heard the willow warblers sing in the park Aug. 10th, and 
again in his excursion with the Rotherham Naturalists' Society Aug. 19th.
in Sprotborough woods ; also the whitethroat and whinchat.
It is desir- 
able that the last occurrence of migrants should be recorded.

singular case was a swallow's nest and young in the harrier's kennel during 
an excursion of the Barnsley Naturalists to the house and grounds of 
W. Norton, Esq., J.

remarks Mr. Hebblethwaite referred to his recent visit to Holland, 
and said that although he had chosen for his subject the Bulb Gardens of 
Holland, he thought a more appropriate title would have been " The Bulb 
Fields or Farms of Holland, for with that nation the flowers which were 
so highly prized in this country for their attractive blooms as well as their 
sweet odours, were grown in acres and even in miles of helds.
Mr.
Hebblethwaite gave a practical illustration of the modus operandi of the 
cultivation of the hyacinth and tulip from the seeds and offsets to the 
mature bulb, which was explained to him by M.
Yantubergen, one of the 
largest hyacinth growers in Haarlem.

Boebuck exhibited a female lizard {Zootoca vivipara) which he had taken 
on the Gill Beck moors, near Barden, and five young ones which it had 
produced in captivity.
Mr. Henry Lupton, M.E.S., described his ento- 
mological tour in the Isle of Arran, and exhibited his captures, including 
a very fine variety of Boarmia repandata and examples of Dasydia 
ohfuscata, Pelurga comitata, Plusia mterrogationis, Platypteryx lacertula, 
Agrotis valligera, and a very large species of Tahanus, or horse-fly.

392nd Meeting, Aug. 10th, the president in the chair.
— The principal 
object of interest was a full-grown living larva of Attacus atlas, belonging 
to Mr. H.
Marsh, which had been reared by Mr. W.
H. Taylor.
It was 
hatched on the 22nd August, and spun up Aug. 17th.
Mr. Washington

Foyle and County Down, and slides of mosses.
393rd Meeting, Aug. 17th.— The president, Mr. B.
Holgate, F.G.S., 
who was in the chair, exhibited for the Rev. R.
ColUns a stuffed specimen 
of the smallest known deer {Moschus Meminna) from Ceylon ; he also 
mentioned some curious facts with respect to the elephant in Ceylon, on 
Mr. Collins' authority, whereby there appeared to be a correlation 
between the height of the animal and the number of its toes.
A young 
Kandyan chief named Dunnwille informed Mr. Collins that there are in 
the same herd various sizes of elephants, and that, when young, the 
number of their toes is an indication of the height which they will attain 
at maturity.
The largest have 18, the smallest 16, while medium-sized 
elephants have 17.
Mr. H.
Marsh exhibited living larvae of Orgyia pudi- 
hinda from Windermere Lake side.

— The fifth meeting for 1880 was 
on the Bank Holiday Monday, August 2nd, at Marsden.
Two main 
parties were formed.
One, led by Mr. C.
P. Hobkirk, F.L.S., and Mr.
John Hirst, F.R.M.S., of Dobcross, started from Greenfield, over the 
moors, past Bill's o' Jack's, Diggle, Saddleworth, and Standedge by Red- 
brook reservoir, Mr. Hirst giving very good descriptions of the physical 
geology of the country traversed.
The other party was led by the other 
local secretary, Mr. S.
L. Mosley, from Lockwood, over Crosland Moor,

skirting Dungeon Wood to South Crosland, through Honley Woods to 
Meltham, thence past Blackmoorfoot reservoir to Deer Hill, over the 
moors to Wessenden Head, and down that vaUey to Marsden.
The 
common rendezvous for all the parties was Blake Lee, a pleasant resort 
on the edge of the moors.
Here the meetings were held.
At the general 
one, Prof.
W. C.
Williamson, F.R.S., the president, occupied the chair 
There were about 50 or 60 members present, representing 14 societies 
The list of new subscribers included Messrs.
T. Pape of Hehnsley 
A. Bear of Bradford, and P.
B. Mason, F.L.S., of Burton-on-Trent 
Votes of thanks to Messrs.
Hobkirk and Mosley for their services as 
local secretaries were adopted.
Mr. Thos.
Hick, B.A., B.
Sc., reported 
with respect to the address to Mr. Darwin, that the committee recom 
mended that it should be printed on vellum, signed by the officers of the 
tJnion, bound in a morocco case, and afterwards either forwarded to Mr 
Darwin, or presented by a small deputation.
The committee also thought 
it advisable not to charge the cost of it on the Union funds, and had 
opened a subscription among the members and friends.
The report of the 
Committee was accepted, and the committee re-appointed to carry out 
their recommendations .
Mr. Thomas Lister, of Barnsley, was chosen to 
act as representative of the Union at the coming meeting of the British 
Association at Swansea, on the motion of Mr. W.
Denison Roebuck, 
seconded by Mr. J.
W. Davis, F.S.A, The officers of sections then 
reported as follows : — For the Entomological Section Mr. S.
D. Bairstow 
F.L.S., reported that but little had been done.
Scoparia coarctalis had 
been taken by Mr. C.
Smethurst, larvse of Polia flavocincta by Mr. G.
T 
Porritt and by Mr. J.
P. Barrett of London (who was present as a visitor) 
whilst Larentia caesiata and Oidaria populata were noticed in abundance 
by all the members of the section.
Tipulidse had been noticed in profu- 
sion all over the moors, and various ichneumons, including Amblyteles 
fasciatorius, had been noticed.
Mr. C.
P. Hobkirk, F.L.S., reported for 
the Botanical Section.
The total number of vascular plants noted during 
the day was 120 among which were Claytonia alsinoides, Rubus chamse- 
morus, Vaccinium Vitis-idsea, and Carex binervis.
Thirty-six species of 
mosses were observed, including Dicranella cerviculata, Bartramia 
pomiformis, Atrichum crispum, Oligotrichum hercynicum, Hyocomium 
flagellare, and Hypnum ochraceum.
Jungermannia trichophylla, Chilos- 
cyphus polyanthus, and nine other species of hepaticse were collected.
Three species of lichens were noted, Lecidea contigua, forma hydrophila, 
being the best.
Six species of fungi were collected, including Ascobulus 
Crouani.
Fragilaria virescens, F.
mutabilis, Pinnularia viridis, Stigeo- 
clonium protensum, and six other species of algse were gathered.
As 
botanists were forbidden to go on the moors, many plants which occur in 
the district were not seen.

THE mSE OF THE LITERATURE OF ENTOMOLOGY, 
By Willoughby Gaedxer.
(Concluded.) 
We now come to tlie last class of books, in which we include all 
those giving accounts of individual species.
Xaturally the insects 
taken most notice of are the bees, and therefore we find frequent 
allusions to them among the writers of the various countries of 
Europe.
Beginning at home, Thomas Hill in his work on 
gardening, has a chapter on bees ; in Spain, Torres fills an 
octavo on the keeping of bees.
(^2) Some time previously, in Ger- 
many, Stanhuff devoted a whole quarto to the habits of bees, and 
the allegories suggested by them.
{^^) Silkworms, also, on account 
of the practical value of the silk they produced, claimed some atten- 
tion, and accordingly we find Serres (3^) at Paris and London, 
LiBANUS (25) in Germany, and Tellier (^6) in Paris again, publishing 
works on their history and culture ; and in London, in 1609, an 
anonymous writer fills a large volume with the history of the mulberry 
tree and the silkworm (3").
At this time also the ants obtained a 
small volume on their history by Jerome Wilde (^^) ; Aristotle's 
theory about wasps was compiled in a work by Cagxatus, (^^) a 
naturalist of Yerona ; and a curious volume was published a little 
later by an anonymous writer.
(^) Last, but not least, was Jacob 
Hoefnagel's book called " Various Illustrations of Flying Insects, 
illustrated most accurately from life." ( ^^) This book — which has no

letterpress, and which in the copy in the British Museum forms part 
of a larger work on Natural History generally, — is certainly well 
described by the latter part of its title, for the clearness of the figures 
is a most conspicuous feature.
The part on insects contains fourteen 
plates, and was published at Frankfort a.d. 1630.
We must now turn our attention again to the M.SS.
left by Thos.
Muffet.
According to A.
Wood, in his " Athenae Oxoniensis," a 
few imperfect copies of the "Theatrum" were published by Laur.
Scholzius in 1598, but of these I can find no mention elsewhere.
Be 
that as it may, they were imperfect copies, and only one or two were 
printed, so the M.SS.
practically lay by idle until they came into the 
hands of Sir Theod.
de May erne, who published them at London in 
1634, under Muffet's original title of " Insectorum sive minimorum 
ANIMALIUM Theatrum." Thus wc sce, with the appearance in print 
of this book, Conrad Gesner's writings on insects at last saw the 
light of day, about a century after their origin, and after passing 
through many vicissitudes, having changed hands as many as five 
times.
Such was the struggle this study went through in its early 
days.
Thomas Muffet has well been called the father of Entomology, and 
certainly he did a great deal for this particular branch of Natural 
Science, for his book is most comprehensive, containing as it does a 
history of each order of insects, and recapitulating everything that 
had been discovered on the subject previously.
We must remember, 
also, that to compile a work like Muffet's was no light task in his 
day ; it would no doubt require endless research in numerous foreign 
libraries to obtain the various authors he quotes from — for books, as 
we know, were very few and far between in those times, very different 
from our own, when we can get almost any volume we may desire in 
our large public libraries.
Muffet enters most thoroughly and 
heartily into his work ; he is not content merely to record the few 
bare facts he could glean from previous authors concerning the 
different species of insects, as other writers had done before, but in 
each case, by means of his own and his friends' observations, he 
strives to arrive at a practical reason and definite use for all the 
phenomena he observes.
True, his conclusions may not have been 
entirely correct, but even then they formed a basis from which 
subsequent investigators could start with additions and corrections, 
till at last the amount of certain knowledge which we possess at the 
present day has been arrived at.
I may here mention a statement of 
Muffet's which, though a gross error, has had a long-lived reputation.
Gardner : Rise of the Literature op Entomology.
35 
He says that when the pupa changes into the imago, the head of the 
pupa becomes the tail of the imago, and vice versa !
This certainly 
seems a strange idea for such an entomologist as MufFet to have 
taken into his head ; but although Swammerdam, in his great work 
in 1669, took the trouble to disprove the statement at some length.
Muffet's theory has been copied by compilers of works on Natural 
History from one to another, without scruple, for over 200 years, and 
I daresay many have, like myself, met with it in ^ome of the so-called 
popular books on Natural History, even at the present day — Muffet's 
name alone having been taken as a sufficient guarantee for the truth 
of such an absurd assertion.
Thus we have endeavoured to trace the rise and progress of 
Entomological Literature from unknown writers before the time of 
Aristotle (who was born nearly 400 years before the Christian era) 
down to the publication of Muffet's " Theatrum Insectorum," a.d.
1634.
We have seen that although insects were by no means 
unnoticed before, Muffet's " Theatrum," which was printed- at London^ 
was the first separate work, on all orders of insects, published, to the 
world.
England, which has been, and we 'hope ever will be, first in 
most things, can thus claim to have produced the earliest important 
work on Entomology, the book before us.
I fear, now I have come to a close, that many will say (rightly too, 
perhaps) that these notes are more fit for an Antiquarian than for an 
Entomological Society ; but still I trust it has not been unprofitable 
to devote a little time and trouble in tracing out the early history of 
our interesting study.

additions to the above.
ANCIENT PEAT BOG NEAR OLDHAM.
On Monday evening, the 13th Sept., about eighty ladies and gentle- 
men met in front of the General Post Office, Greaves-street, at the 
invitation of the Oldham Microscopical Society, and led by Mr. James 
Nield, proceeded to the very interesting section of boulder clay 
enclosing a bed of peat which has recently been uncovered near Rhodes 
Bank.
Mr. Nield entered into various explanations as to the peat, 
after which the company adjourned to the Union Club, where Mr.
Nield read the following paper : — 
" The section before us, though not a large one, is very varied and 
full of interest.
In the depth of 14 feet we have two thick beds of 
36 
The Naturalist.
drift, with partings of fine clay, and, midway in the section, we have a 
well-defined bed of peat, with a maximum thickness of about 18 inches.
Another bed of peat, less clearly defined, and not so pure as the 
former, is likewise present, the two beds having beneath them a band 
of exceedingly fine clay, of a bluish grey colour, which evidently 
corresponds to the "seating" or "floor clay" which is so invariable 
an accompaniment of our coal seams.
The beds of drift that enclose 
the peat are alike in some of their main features, but very unlike in 
others.
In both, boulders, principally of foreign extraction, are in 
great abundance, and give a striking appearance to both beds.
In 
the bed beneath the peat we have one or two bands of fine clay, coarse 
sand, or grit pebbles, and boulders, while, as you will see, the upper 
one, with some little variation, is made up of a very uniform arenaceous 
clay, and a great number of boulders — a somewhat indifi'erent and 
unprofitable material for making bricks.
" The section of 14 feet before us gives but an imperfect idea of the 
* thickness of these deposits as they existed at the time of their final 
appearance above the sea, and we have not the means of determining 
this thickness with any degree of exactness ; but, while remembering 
that the brook which runs close by has worn out what we now know 
as the valley of the Medlock, let us draw an imaginary line at right 
angles to the trend of the valley, from, say Glodwick on the south to 
Yorkshire-street on the north, and I think we may then hazard an 
opinion that the bed of peat has at a former period in the remote past 
been capped by from 50 to 100 feet of characteristic boulder clay, the 
upper beds being known to the geologist as the "upper drift," and the 
lower beds — stratified sand and gravel, with pebbles and boulders — as 
the " middle drift," the lower and other deposits being wanting in this 
neighbourhood so far as is known.
" These deposits are said, with good reason, to be of marine origin ; 
that the clay is but the half-dried mud of an old sea bottom ; that this- 
clay, and a great per-centage of the boulders, pebbles, gravel, and sand 
have been derived from distant districts, more or less northerly from 
our present standpoint ; that these were brought and dropped here, 
where we find them, by passing icebergs, assisted by shore ice sailing | 
over the latitude in which we now live, and melting in the slightly 
warmer waters and balmier breezes during the period known as the 
" Ice Age," when the tops of our highest hills alone stood above the 
level of a glacial sea, and when the plants now met with only within 
or about the line of x^erpetual snow were denizens of this part of our 
country, when the now extinct mammoth and the hairy rhinocerus, the 
Ancient Peat Bog near Oldham.
37 
now living grizzly bear of North America, the Arctic fox, the tailless 
hare, and reindeer, shared with primeval Britons the meagre fare of an 
uncharitable soil.
We can form no conception of the time that has 
elapsed since these events and changes took place, but you will agree 
with me that that time must be immense, if you will bear in mind 
that since their occurrence sea and land have changed their relative 
level, the rigours of the climate have been softened, the configuration 
of the country has been altered, and a general change in the plants and 
animals has been effected, these latter having migrated to more 
northern latitudes, or where the conditions of cold, moisture, &c., such 
as their nature loves and requires, can still be found.
Appearances of 
great physical changes, I think, are plainly visible in the section before 
us.
The bed of gravel enclosing waterworn pebbles and boulders, at 
the base of the section, may be taken to represent a shallow water or 
shore deposit, indicating a thickening of the accumulation, or, pro- 
bably, a rising of the land generally.
At this point a pause in the 
upward tendency seems to have ensued.
This pause was of sufficient 
duration to allow of the uninterrupted growth of innumerable genera- 
tions of aquatic and other plants, whose buried remains have built up 
the bed of peat which we have this evening come to see.
At length 
the further growth was, by some means, arrested.
I know the danger 
I incur in hazarding an opinion as to the nature and extent of these 
changes, but will venture to suggest that the period of growth was 
finally closed by the slow and gradual subsidence of the area, which 
subsidence continued till the thickness of say 100 feet of subsequent 
deposits was attained.
This bed of peat differs from other beds with 
which we are acquainted, in this, that it is infinitely older than 
the more familiar examples.
In proof of its greater age let us 
remember that, while the more recent peat growths are invariably 
found above the boulder clay, the example before us is beneath the 
identical beds, thus proving its seniority.
" It is quite impossible to determine, with an\' degree of accuracy, the 
nature and the number of species of plants whose remains have gone 
towards the making up of this bed of peat.
The conditions for 
preserving them have not been sufficiently favourable, and the time 
that has elapsed since they lived has been too great for the solution 
of the problem.
With the aid of the microscope, however, I have thus 
far been enabled to recognise some four or five species of mosses only, 
with a few thin stems exhibiting exogenous structure, and belonging 
to a higher order of plants, a few leaves of what I believe to be grasses, 
and to give to Caesar Caesar's due, let me add that my eldest son has

The Naturalist.
been so fortunate as to find one of the wing cases, and one of the 
thoracic plates of a beetle of yet unknown affinities.
The labour of 
further investigation, and of identifying the mosses, if that be possible, 
I have placed in abler hands — the hands of one of our society's 
honorary members, Mr. John Whitehead.
" It would, T think, be unreasonable, and scarcely in accordance with 
the teachings of geological science, to expect that the plants under 
examination would be identical with those to be met with in the 
latitude of Oldham at the present day.
When these mosses, &c., 
adorned the earth with their bright green cushions, we had perhaps 
not exactly an arctic climate, but a sub-arctic one.
Our summers were 
short and our winters were long : the higher hills were covered with 
snow the year round ; the valleys sent down their glaciers, the 
vegetation was scanty, and had but a limited area upon which it could 
find shelter and sustenance ; the sea shore was ice-bound in winter, 
and in summer the surrounding waters were chilled by the presence of 
innumerable icebergs which, partly melting, here dropped their heter- 
ogenous burden of clay, boulders, pebbles, gravel, and sand, on the 
then sea bottom, now the land upon which we stand to look, to think, 
and to wonder.
Should it be possible to identify these beetles, mosses, 
stems, roots, &c., with species now living, I will venture to predict 
that it will be found that their present habitat is in more northern 
latitudes, or at a considerable altitude on our mountains, where alone 
they meet with the temperature and other conditions that they 
require."

Water-eail Breeding near Selby.
— I have been informed by Mr.
Pulleyn, of Selby, that six eggs of the water-rail (Rallus aqnaticus) were 
brought to him during the spring of 1879 ; they had been taken from a 
nest found in a drain near Selby.
Though water-rails are frequently 
obtained in the neighbourhood, I think this is the first time it has been 
noticed breeding.
I also saw in Mr. PuUeyn's possession a pair of spotted 
crakes that had been shot near Selby last winter, and a hawfinch that had 
been obtained in the neighbourhood last May.

by hundreds ; they came in flocks, then a few stragglers, to be followed 
by flocks again, and so they continued for an hour.
The majority were 
martins, the rest swallows, and along with the last batch was one solitary 
swift.
I never observed a swift so late before ; they flew low and straight 
forwards, just skimming the house tops.
Their course was east.

Coremia munitata.
— In the August number for 1880, of the Naturalist , 
page 12, 1 noticed a short account of the proceedings of the 386th meeting 
of the Leeds Naturalists' Club.
Mr. C.
Smethurst exhibits a good list of 
lepidoptera, taken during a visit to Wharnclifi'e Woods ; amongst them 
I noticed Coremia munitata.
May I ask Mr. Smethurst if he is correct 
with that species ?
— because we visited Whamcliffe about the same time, 
and took every species shown by him at the above meeting, but in place 
of Coremia munitata we took Coremia propugoiata.
If Mr. Smethurst 
really took Munitata at Wharnclifie, it will add another species to our 
local (Barnsley) list, and for that reason I write you.
Perhaps Mr.
Smethurst will reply in next number of the Naturalist.

Locusts in Yorkshire.
— The locusts have again put in an appearance, 
the first since 1876, that I have heard of.
The first specimen I saw was 
one which was taken at Goole, on the 3rd of September, and which Mr.
T. Bunker kindly allowed me to retain a few days for examination.
It 
seemed to me that it was of the same species {Pachytylus cinerascens) as 
those which formed the flight of 1876.
On the 2nd of September, one 
(which I have also had under my eye by the kindness of the captor) was 
taken in Round Street, Bowling Old Lane, Bradford, by Mr. Terry 
Holmes.
At the meeting of the Leeds Naturalists' Club on the 7th Sept.
I saw one which had flown into the window of a house in Crimbles Street, 
Leeds, and was shown by Mr. Raine, on behalf of his friend Mr. Briggs.
Mr. Raine has since informed me of another, which has been taken near 
Meanwood Street, Leeds, but this I have not seen.
Mr. Thomas Lister 
tells me one has been taken near Barnsley, and the newspapers report , 
one occurring at Scarborough.
On hearing of these, and knowing that | 
this species always comes from the East, I asked Mr. Clarke to write to 
his friend Mr. Lawton and ascertain whether any had appeared in 
Holderness, which district is almost certain to produce locusts.
The 
results of these inquiries were precisely what I expected, for I learnt that 
Short Notes and Queries.
43 
several had occurred about Easington.
The specimens which I have seen 
varied slightly in colour from the locusts of 1876, and did not by any 
means exhibit so much of a tendency to green coloration ; they were 
brown or leaden-grey in tinge.
The cause of the visitation is obvious.
The weather — the gloriously fine and warm sunny days of the last weeks 
of August and the first week of September, the warmest days we have 
had this year — just suited these insects, assisted their devolopment, and 
facilitated their wanderings.
To my mind there is just a shade of ground 
for surmising that it is possible that the locusts breed in the East Riding, 
if any of our members will endeavour to investigate the point, and try to 
find the larvae.

Locust at Bradford.
— A very fine specimen of the above was

Orthodontium gracile, Wils.
— In the " Revue Bryologique," 1880, page 
84 (Sept.), the Abbe Boulay points out an unaccountable error respecting 
the peristome of this moss, made by its discoverer the late Wm. Wilson.
In the "Bry. Brit." we read, Outer teeth nearly twice as long 
as the narrow processes of the inner peristome." In the ''Bryol.
Eur." the same statement is made : Cilia duplo hreviora ; Mueller's Syn., 
is the same : peristoma denies internidimidiohreviores, whilst Schimper 
quite recently in his Syn. Muse.
Eur., Ed. II., p.
389, repeats the same 
thing : interni processus multo hreviores.
M. Boulay states that the first 
peristome of this moss, which he examined from Guipavas, shewed the 
interior processes quite as long as the exterior teeth, at times even sur- 
passing them, which caused him at first to doubt his determination of the 
specimen."^ But on referring to authentic specimens, viz.
: No. 677, of 
Ilabenhorst's Bryotheca Europsea, gathered by Mr. Curnow in Cheshire, 
he found the internal processes " terminating in long cilia equalling or 
surpassing the external teeth." The strangest thing about it is, that, 
Wilson's figure on pi.
xlvii., is so far contrary to his diagnosis that the 
, teeth are of equal length, and in two of the three figures of the peristome 
the internal are the longer !
Having thus had my curiosity aroused, I 
referred to some good fruiting specimens in my herbarium,, gathered by 
I my late friend Mr. G.
E. Hunt, at Alderley Edge, in 1863, and I find they 
agree with Wilson's figure and M.
Boulay's remarks.
How Mr. Wilson, 
who was generally so careful and exact in his descriptions can have made 
such an error, is strange.
The Abbe conjectures that the original speci- 
mens must have been in an imperfect state and either not fully developed 
i or too far advanced ; and the moss being very rare, authors who have 
1 subsequently written upon it contented themselves with reproducing the 
*The specimen above referred to was gathered by M.
Tanguy, Jun., on the soil of 
, a talus at the side of the Fontaine de St. Euenan, at Larvez en Guipavas (Finisterre).

the 'Original description.
However this may be, he says, the diagnoses 
ought to be modified as follows : processus peristomii interni dentibus 
extemis sequilongi, humiditate conniventibus, apice contiguis." Will 
some of our Cheshire bryologists examine fresh specimens when fully 
ripe, and thus confirm these remarks if they find them correct ?

was in a growing state, and had recently been found in Scotland.
It was 
technically described by the president, and compared with its new ally, 
Jungermannia Hihernica (Hook).
The hon.
secretary also exhibited 
growing specimens of male plants of Dumortia irrigua, which had been 
collected by Mr. Curnow, at Ilfracombe, and a number of the rarer mosses 
which had been collected during a recent excursion to the Breadalbane 
mountains.
Amongst them it is interesting to record that Leskea 
rufescens and Mnium spinosum were found in fruiting condition.
Bryum 
demissum, Dissodon splachnoides, and the rare fern Cystopteris montana 
were amongst the other rarities brought home.
The remainder of the 
mosses were reserved for future examination and discrimination.
Mr.
W. H.
Pearson laid upon the table specimens of Jungerraannia lurida 
(Dmrt.) collected by himself and Mr. Whitehead, at Woodhead ; also 
Scapania umhrosa, from the same locality ; and Ciymnomitrium ohtusum, 
8 new species described by Prof.
Lindberg.
This has been collected 
by Messrs.
Byrom, Neild, and Pearson on Snowdon, June, 1880.
Mr.
Thomas Entwistle, of the Botanical Gardens, called attention to four 
interesting cyptogamic plants which he had recently received.
They had 
been collected in the Kurum Valley, Afghanistan, by Dr. Aitcheson last 
year, and were as follows : — Eqnisetum elongatum, Bartramia calcareay 
Botrychium lunaria, and the pretty SelagineUa sanguinoleida.

Yorkshire Naturalists' Union.
— The last excursion of the season 
took place in the East Riding on the 4th Sept.
, and was well attended 
by East Riding naturalists.
The place fixed was Market Weighton for 
the investigation of Londesborough Park, Holme Woods and Houghton 
Moor.
Besides numerous small parties three main routes were followed.
The botanists worked from Holme Station, by Houghton Moor to Sancton 
and Market Weighton.
Mr. Frank Parkinson conducted a numerous 
party to Londesborough, the parks, gardens, fishponds and woods, thence 
to Goodmanham and back by the Springwell Brook to the meeting place.
Mr. Matthew Foster of Sancton, one of the local secretaries, conducted 
the geologists in a southward direction.
The day was sunny and cloudless, 
very fine and warm.
The meetings were all held at the Londesborough 
Arms Hotel.
At the general meeting the Rev. William Fowler, M.A., 
vice-president, occupied the chair.
Eleven societies were found to be 
represented, sixteen being absent.
There was a good individual 
attendance, about 70 or 80.
The minutes were taken as read, for want 
of time.
The Hull Field Naturalists' Society was admitted into the 
Union.
Messrs.
W. Hodgson and Jno. Key of Malton, Alfd.
Harker and 
B. Carlill of Hull, and Mr. Foster Parkinson of Market Weighton, were 
thanked for becoming subscribers.
Numerous donations to the library 
from Messrs.
G. T.
Porritt, F.L.S.
(Entomological Transactions for 1879, 
&c.), Thos.
Lister and Matthew Foster (two valuable MS.
sections of the 
East Riding oolitic rocks) were also acknowledged by a vote of thanks.
Thanks were also voted to Messrs.
W. N.
Cheesman and M.
Foster, 
the local secretaries ; to their coadjutors ; and to Messrs.
J. Young, H.
Stourton, C.
Langdale and Rev. J.
Blow, for permission to visit their 
estates, on the motion of Mr. J.
T. Atkinson, F.G.S., of Selby, 
seconded by Mr. E.
Hunter, F.C.S., Goole.
The Sectional Reports were 
then given as follows : — Fifty species of cryptogamic plants were seen, 
consisting of six species of vascular cryptogams, twenty-two mosses, six 
lichens, two hepatics, and fourteen fungi.
Among the latter were 
Amanita pubescens, Lepiota procerus, Paxillus involutus, Lactariua 
serifluus, Russula alutacea, R.
emetica, R.
nigricans, Polyporus perennis, 
P. abietinus, and Boletus edulis.
None of the other plants seen were 
rare, the least common moss being Plagiothecium undulatum.
Mr.
Matthew Foster, of Sancton, reported for Geological Section, as 
follows : — Starting from Market Weighton on Sancton-road, the first 
appearance of the oolite was found at Gofer Hill — a very thin bed, not 
more than two feet, including its accompanying sandbed, overlying which 
the red chalk was very conspicuous in the high road.
At Sancton, on© 
mile further, the sandbed appears as a stratified rock 36ft.
in thickness ; 
this bed lies in a fault, dipping to the south at an angle of about ten 
degrees.
The red chalk is seen on the top.
Some large blocks of oolite 
which had been taken from below the sandbed, were lying near ; out- 
wardly they presented the usual appearance of the common oolite, but, 
when broken, the centre is found to be a very hard compact blue stone.
48 
The Naturalist.
containing small specimens of coral.
Proceeding to Newbald, two miles 
further, the sandbed is again seen about 20ft in thickness, unstratified, of 
a brown or reddish colour.
This bed rests on the oolite, and is capped by 
a thin bed of the Kelloway, which, however, was scarcely visible, on 
account of a mass of brambles and weeds growing on the margin of the 
pit.
About six feet from the top, running horizontally along the western 
side of the pit, is an ammonite bed about Gin. wide, full of holes like a 
honeycomb.
Some attempts were made to obtain specimens, but they lie 
too far in the rock, which, when dry, is very hard.
The floor of this bed 
was formerly an oolite quarry, from which the large circular stones 
(eddystones) were obtained.
Some were used for bridges across the 
brook ; one was deposited in the centre of the village green.
This latter 
was visited, and found to be almost a perfect circle about 4| ft.
in 
diameter, and about 14in.
in thickness, the base being left in the pit, 
which is now filled up with rubbish.
At South Cave, three miles further, 
the sandbed appears again, about 10ft.
in thickness, dark-brown colour^ 
coarse and gritty ; this also rests on the ooHte, capped by a mixture of small 
stones, sand, &c., embedded in Kimmeridge clay, the red chalk being about 
100 yds.
distant eastwards.
This bed is full of fossils — Terebratula, Modiola 
numerous, Am. communis present but rare.
Time not allowing for a visit 
to St. Austin's Stone, the route was directed to Hotham.
Passing over the 
escarpment of the oolite, the middle lias beds are found in a road cutting 
near the village, from which specimens were taken.
Passing over the 
escarpment of the lower lias, and skirting the hills, we arrive at North 
Clifie ; but time being short, we just glance at the cutting through the 
hill, and leaving it on the right, and Bulsbeck with its mammalian 
remains on the left, Weighton is reached just in time for the meeting.
Mr.
Foster, conductor of the geological party, exhibited fossils from the chalk, 
sandbeds, oolite, middle and lower lias, and the tertiaries at Bulsbeck.
In Vertebrate Zoology Mr. T.
Bunker reported having noticed, between 
Brough and Market Weighton the following : — Kestrel (2), common gull, 
coot, waterhen, lapwing, (now in flocks) greenfinch, yellow hammer^ 
spotted flycatcher, willow wren, whitethroat, sand martin, &c.
Mr.
Roebuck stated, on behalf of Mr. Butterell, secretary of the Conchological 
Section, that the day had been too fine for land shells, and that several 
freshwater species had been found, none of them of very special interest, 
except a curious form of Limnaea peregra from the fish ponds of Londes- 
borough.
Mr. William Prest, of York, reported for the Entomological 
Section that very little of any note had been observed.
Peronea sponsana 
occurred rather freely amongst beeches, and other species noticed included 
larvae of Cossus ligniperda, Notodonta camelina, &c.
A locust taken at 
Goole the previous day was exhibited.
The meeting -closed with an 
announcement from the chair that notices of motion for the annual 
meeting in January, 1881, should be sent to the secretaries in time to 
print in the circular convening the meeting.

BEYOLOGICAL NOTES.
By W.
West.
Mr. Hobkirk says, in tlie last number of the Naturalist^ tliat Boulay 
states in the " Revue Bryologique " that Wilson made an error in his 
description of the peristome of Orthodontium gracile.
Before bryolo- 
gists accept that Wilson made such a mistake, his specimens ought 
to be examined ; so ought those of Schimper and Miieller, as they 
are said to fall into the same error.
I have carefully examined a few 
mature capsules, and I find that the inner processes are shorter than 
the outer peristome, but irregular, mostly about half the length, a few 
attaining nearly the same length.
The capsules examined were from 
tufts gathered on the 3rd of May, 1879 ; they appeared to have just 
shed their lids, all the other capsules (about 93 per cent.) still having 
them on, their beaks being oblique in dried specimens.
I also 
examined capsules collected in March, 1878, but these appeared to be 
the fruits of 1877, as the peristome had almost vanished.
The above specimens were sent to me by Mr. E.
M. Holmes, who 
had collected them at West Hoathly, Sussex, and Tunbridge Wells 
respectively, therefore this note records (if Mr. Holmes has not 
recorded them before) two new localities for a very rare moss, and 
Mr. Hobkirk's foot-note as to localities requires alteration.
As I had 
very little material to work upon, I hope some one having a plentiful 
supply will also examine a number of specimens, and report the 
result.
Mr. Hobkirk interestingly remarks that Wilson's description 
and figure disagree, and that he also finds Cheshire specimens sustain 
Boulay's remarks : my present opinion is, that the inner processes 
vary in length in different examples, and are somewhat irregular even 
in the same specimens.
My examples seem to indicate a different 
time for mature fruit than March, which is given by Schimper and 
Mr. Hobkirk.
Mr. Lees states, in a former number, the localities known for 
JEurhyncliium striatulum.
To these I can add Wormhill, Derby- 
shire, where I gathered it in May, and Plymouth, where Mr. Holmes 
got it years ago.
I also have specimens gathered at Cleveland, 
Bristol.
Whether this locality be in Somersetshire or Gloucester- 
shire I know not; but if in the latter, it makes another locality.
I 
have specimens from Muggendorf, Oberfranken (Arnold) and from 
near Baden (Juratzka).

The Naturalist.
In the report of a meeting of the Manchester Cryptogamic Society 
in the Naturalist for October, 1879, it is stated that CEdipodium 
Grijffithianum is confined to Britain.
Schimper gives the following 
Continental localities : — Prope Ulvig in Osedalen provinc.
Bergen 
Norvegice, in Alp. Setensfjeld provinc.
Romsdalen, in Jotunfjeldena ad 
Sogue, in Laxfjalla Lapponice umensis.
Timmia megapolitam is reported as occurring on Ben Lawers in 
Mr, Hobkirk's Synopsis ; it also finds a place in the London 
Catalogue of British Mosses.
Does this species occur in Britain ?
I gathered a Timmia on Ben Lawers last August, which 1 find named 
T. norvegica ; but on referring to the catalogue and to Mr. Hobkirk's 
Synopsis, I thought that my plant must be T.
megopolitana, as that 
species was recorded as British, and there was no mention of T.
norvegica.
I therefore sent some to the Rev. J.
Fergusson, and 
others, as T.
megapolitana.
Mr. Fergusson at once replied that my 
plants were T.
norvegica, and that T.
megapolitana was not known to 
occur on Ben Lawers.
Schimper also states that the Ben Lawers 
plant is T.
norvegica, and happily summarises the differences between 
the species.
I also brought specimens of Hypnum ocliraceum from an altitude of 
3000 feet on Ben Nevis, sixteen inches in length, and I have no 
doubt that I could find longer specimens if I had picked them.
Schimper says, " semipedales nempe, reperimtiir^'' I collected the var.
fiaccidum, Milde, at Marsden last January, ten inches in length.
At an altitude of over 3000 feet on Ben Lawers I found a yellow- 
green form of Hypnum sarmentosum, which puzzled me very much.
Mr. Fergusson says it is often found within the Arctic Circle, 
being far from common in this country.
The leaves of Grimmia to7'qmta are described by Schimper as 
margine recto " ; I find them to have the margins somewhat 
recurved.
Berkeley says " slightly reflexed." 
BracJiythecium albicans generally has the margin of the leaves 
recurved.
This is not mentioned in any of the books I have seen.
Hypnum virescens, Boulay, is said by M.
Renauld to prefer clear 
cold streams containing in solution carbonate of lime ; this is pre- 
cisely the habitat in which I found this plant at Malham last year, 
but M.
Renauld gives several Continental localities, with their 
altitudes, the lowest of which is at le pied de Gabizos " at 1200 
metres.
The Malham altitude is only 230 metres.
HOW TO EXAMINE A MOSS.
By CP.
HoBKiRK, F.L.S.
It has been suggested that if a few papers on elementary science, 
practically treated, were to appear occasionally in the Naturalist, they 
would materially increase its interest in the minds of many of its 
subscribers, and would also probably help many of the younger 
students in their labours.
The matter has been talked over amongst 
some of our friends, and several promises of assistance in this way 
have been given.
It is in the hope of stimulating those gentlemen 
who have so promised to begin their labours, by setting them the 
example, that I have been led to publish the following notes, and I 
trust they will shortly be followed by several others on different 
branches of Natural History.
Before examining our moss, it will be necessary — like the cook with 
the hare — first to get our moss.
It is not my intention to write any- 
thing more on this point, as Dr. Parsons, F.G.S., has already given 
full directions for the purpose in his excellent paper on "Flowerless 
Plants and their Habitats," in vol.
iv.
pp.
23 and 49.
Having, then, visited some suitable locality — say an old damp 
wall — in early spring, and gathered there a very showy and pretty 
looking moss, we must now proceed to find out what it is — what is its 
name.
I would here observe, that the simple naming of any object in 
Natural History is not to be the ultima thule of our ambition ; at the 
same time it is undoubtedly necessary, before we can go any further 
with advantage in our researches, that we should know the name of 
the object under examination ; and then we can go further, and learn 
something of its relations to other species of the same genus, and to 
other genera and families ; its comparative structure and functions, and 
its geographical distribution, &c.
In the study of mosses nearly all 
these points, however, have to be considered, to a greater or less extent, 
together, before we can arrive at the name ; and having once got the 
name, we already know a good deal of its intimate structure.
It is necessary that we should have some tools, and particularly a 
microscope of some kind.
As a hint to beginners I would say, avoid 
all cheap (1) showy-looking instruments ; they are a delusion and a 
snare.
I may add, without wishing to be invidious, that one of the 
best instruments I have seen for our purpose is made by Mr. Charles 
Collins, of 137, Great Portland Street, London.
This is called the 
Histological Microscope," and its great advantages are that the tube 
is made of the full diameter, so that the eye-pieces of all the best 
makers will fit into it ; and it is also made with registration screw for 
56 
The Naturalist.
the objectives, and thus the objectives of all the chief makers may be 
used with it.
Its price also is another recommendation.
It can be 
purchased, with all necessary parts for the examination of mosses, for 
£5 10s., or with polaiiscope and other additions, for £7 10s.
A few 
glass slides and thin covers, a few needles stuck into wooden handles 
(an old soft-wood penholder will do) with the points downwards and 
projecting about a quarter or half an inch, with the wood neatly cut 
down at the point like a pencil— and you are fully equipped.
Now sit down, having arranged your microscope and light, and get 
out a single plant of the moss, with a capsule (fruit) on it.
The first 
point you have to ascertain is, does the fruit spring directly from the 
summit of the moss, or does it spring from the side of the stem 1 In 
the first case it belongs to the Acrocarpi (from two Greek words, 
ahros at the top, and karpos a fruit) — or it may be pleurocarpous, that 
is, side-fruited (from pleuron a rib, or the side, and karpos.) There is 
also another style of fruiting, in which the capsule is terminal on a 
short branch springing from the side of the stem.
Supposing, then, 
you have Wilson's " Bryologia," or any work based upon his classifi- 
cation, your next point to ascertain wiU be — assuming that your moss 
is acrocarpous — whether there be upon it a removable lid.
Taking 
it that your moss has such a lid, we will for the present pass 
by those three genera which are not so provided, to be considered on 
some future occasion.
Having removed the lid with the point of one 
of the needles, you must now examine the mouth of the capsule left 
open by its removal to ascertain whether there is a fringe of teeth 
surrounding it and springing from it, or not.
Passing by those that 
are without teeth [gymnostomi—gumnos naked, stoma a mouth), we 
find your moss has a mouth surrounded by a number of small teeth 
(peristome — peri around, and stoma), in one row only, i.e., peristome 
single.
You must now try to find a capsule which bears what is 
called a calyptra (kaluptra a covering or veil).
This is a thin mem- 
branous veil at first covering the whole of the capsule, but as the stem 
grows it splits off, and a portion of it is carried upwards on the summit 
of the unripe capsule.
Should you find one, notice whether it be 
formed like the extinguisher of a candle, open at the bottom only — 
i.e. mitriform — or slit up on one side, i.e. dimidiate.
Finding it to be 
dimidiate, you must now slit the capsule from base to summit on one 
side with a sharp knife, spread it out on a slide with a little water, put 
on a thin covering glass, and place it on the stage of the microscope 
under a 1-inch objective, and proceed to count and examine the teeth 
of the peristome, and their relative positions and conditions.

OENITHOLOGICAL NOTES.
MiGRATiGN OF Birds.— This season, nearly all our summer birds have 
left us a month sooner than usual.
All the warblers, swallows, and 
martins departed by the middle of September, with a few exceptions.
I 
saw a few martins flying over the canal Oct. 9th.
Mr. Parkin, of 
Brampton, Cumberland, informs me that he saw a flock of redwings 
Sept.
25th; and Mr. John Cordeaux, of Lincolnshire, writes to Mr.
Clarke that almost all the winter visitors are nearly a month sooner this 
year.
This is a sure indication of a severe winter.

Bank.— J.

A Bird's Nest in the Heart of a Tree.
— On the 5th of the present 
month, while the sawyers at the Farnley Ironworks, near Leeds, were 
engaged cutting up a Dutch elm from the Castle Howard estate, they were 
surprised to find in a cavity in the heart of the trunk a bird's nest con- 
taining eggs, the exact n amber of which is not quite certain, as some were 
broken in the process of sawing, but six of them were obtained quite 
uninjured, and the broken remains are estimated to represent from four 
to six more.
The cavity was situate 21 ft.
from the root end of the 
trunk (which at this point was 16 inches in diameter), and measured 
24 inches in depth by 3 inches across.
The nest occupied the bottom of 
the cavity, and consisted of a quantity of moss in a very decayed state.
The eggs are described as being of a dirty white ground colour and 
spotted somewhat faintly with dark brown, inclining to red ; but so many 
years have elapsed since they were deserted, that the contents have 
entirely evaporated, leaving not the faintest trace of a former presence.
I am inclined to think, from the number and description of the eggs, and 
the situation of the nest, that they are most probably those of a blue tit- 
'inouse.
The thickness of the solid timber wall, which entirely closed the 
cavity from the outer world, was five inches at the lower extremity and 
three-and-a-half at the upper extremity, the latter being the minimum 
thickness.
The number of "rings of growth" between the cavity and 
the bark, counted at the thinnest part, was sixty.
This would indicate 
that the cavity had been sealed for at least that number of years, although 
the nest and eggs must be considerably older ; for there must be added 
the number of years that necessarily intervened between the abandonment 
of the nest and the final closing of the aperture, before the formation 
of complete rings of growth could have commenced.

Great-crested Grebe near Leeds.
— On the 18th September my 
brother and I observed a pair of great-crested grebes on Waterloo Lake, 
at Roundhay Park.
We watched them for about an hour, and with the 
aid of a field-glass were able to see them very distinctly.
These birds are 
very scarce in this neighbourhood.
We also saw at the same time a brood of 
young waterhens, apparently not above a week old ; this is rather late to 
meet with young waterhens.
Last winter I saw a pair of little grebes, 
at Roundhay.
This is also a rare bird, not a single previous instance of 
its breeding in this locality having come under my observation.

ENTOMOLOGICAL NOTES.
East-Riding Lepidoptera.
— I have just been reading the Transactions 
of the Nat. Union, lately issued.
In the remarks upon the macro- 
lepidoptera for 1878 I see allusion made to Anchocelis lunosa, as a York- 
shire rarity.
If this applies merely to that year, it is undoubtedly true, 
but otherwise the insect is by no means uncommon on the fen land here.
I take it on the flowering reeds, and sitting on gas lamps, and in ordinary 
years usually bring home several in an evening's walk, when out for 
lutosa (Reed flowers, it might not perhaps be generally known to 
your readers, areas attractive as sugar.) For the past two years, how- 
ever, I have missed lunosa, nor have I seen it this autumn.
— A Yorkshire 
rarity, I believe, is Mamestra abjeda, of which I took eleven at the 
mouth of the Humber in August, this year, and to my certain knowledge 
missed three more.
From the locality I judge they may be always found 
there.
On the same occasion I took the finest series of Agrotis cursoria 
I have ever seen.
Both these and Piipm are much darker in Yorkshire 
than are southern specimens.

Vanessa Antiopa near Bradford.— A non-entomological friend recently 
described to me an insect as a large dark moth with a white edge," 
which he had seen flying and resting on geraniums, &c, , in an ornamental 
flower garden at Manningham.
I took out a drawer from my cabinet, and 
asked him to show me the insect he had seen, when he unhesitatingly 
pointed to Antiopa.
It had been noticed for several days.
The 
following Sunday (Sept.
26th) I had the pleasure of seeing one fly over 
my head and into some villa gardens near the same place (Lister Park) ; 
at least from its size and general appearance I feel sure it could be no 
other butterfly.

Locusts in Yorkshire,— Second appearance in 1880.
— After the 
appearance of the flight of locusts recorded in last month's Naturalist, 
the weather, which had so favored their appearance, changed to cold, and 
of course checked their wanderings.
In the third week of September, 
however, it became again fine and very warm, and the locusts again 
appeared.
Mr. Henry Pollard secured one which had been taken in a 
field in Pontefract-lane, Leeds, on the 27th Sept., and about the same 
time one was taken near Wortley, at the other extremity of Leeds 
borough.
I have also heard vague rumours of others, but nothing 
definite.

Small Sirex gigas.
— I have just had sent me by my friend Mr. Barra- 
clough, chemist, Chapeltown-road, Leeds, the smallest specimen by far of 
Sirex gigas which I have ever seen.
It is a female, and only measures 
one inch (exactly) in length from the head to the end of the ovipositor.

It was growing in from four to eight feet of water, with 
Potamogeton crisp^ts, Myriuphyllum spicatum, and other water plants.
It

four- to eight-rayed star-like bulbils, through which the rhizomes pass.

There are some western 
European forms that will almost certainly occur with us, especially several 
Scandinavian species, so that all may have a chance of finding something 
new and original." We recommend any of our friends who are studying

There is an 
uncertainty as to the exact habitat of the last-mentioned plant.
About two 
months ago I gathered some very fine fruit of Campylopus turfaceus, near 
Wetherby ; the ripe spores were shed in such abundance in drying, that 
I placed some on slides, and carefully laid covers on them, placing them 
in a large evaporating dish with Bradford tap-water, covering the dish ' 
with sheet glass.
This was done to grow the protonema of the moss.
• 
When I looked for protonema I found an abundant crop of fine examples 
of Asterionella formosa on the slips and covers, and I am unable to 
pronounce whether it originated from the Bradford tap-water or the 
Wetherby spores and dust, though 1 lean to the latter, because thej 
Asterionella grew all over the bottom of the dish, the slips, and covers ( 
quite away from the sown spores as well as near them.
I have now sown 
the bottom of the evaporating dish with small glass circles, in anticipation 
of a fine harvest.

Coremia munitata.
— Correction.
— The insect which I took at Wharn- 
cliflfe was, as Mr Harrison suggests ( Naturalist vi., p.
4:2.), C.
propugnata, 
and it was under that name that I exhibited it to the Leeds Naturalists' 
Club.
The mistake was made by the member who wrote down the name 
of my insect from my dictation for the secretary's use, and he either 
misunderstood me, or else wrote munitata for propugnata inadvertently.
At all events, I showed the insect under its right name.
Our secretary is 
not to blame either, for he copied the list as supplied to him.

R. 
Manchester Cryptogamic Society.
— Monthly meeting, 20th Sept., 
Dr. Carrington in the chair.
— Messrs.
Cunliffe and Rogers exhibited a 
further series of mosses gathered during the month of July, upon the 
Breadalbane mountains.
The specimens were mounted both for the 
herbarium and the microscopical cabinet, making altogether an interesting 
and instructive series.
Mr. CunliflFe also exhibited freshly-gathered 
specimens of Dichodontium pellucidum, var.
fagimontanum, from Hand- 
forth, Cheshire, and some slides of mosses from the " Arctic Peat Bog" 
at Oldham, recently discovered by Mr. Neild.
The discussion upon the 
latter subject was deferred until the October meeting.
Amongst other 
mosses exhibited were fine specimens of Encalypta streptocarpa (fruit) 
and Myurella julacea, by Mr. Cash, both gathered by him in the month 
of August — the former near Bolton Abbey, Yorkshire, and the latter 
along with E^icalypta ciliata and other rarities on the summit of Ingle- 
borough.
The occurrence of Fhyscomitrella patens at Appleton, Cheshire, 
was reported by the same member, and specimens were exhibited.
Mr.
Entwistle read some interesting correspondence he had had in reference 
to the beautiful fern Adiantum Farley ense, which is so universally 
admired.
The late Mr. Smith of Kew Gardens, had stated that it origi- 
nated as a barren sporeling sport from Adiantum tenerum at Farley Hill 
Hall, in Barbadoes, but it had also been received, as a wild fern, in the 
autumn of last year from the Island of Montserrat, and specimens from 
there were deposited in the herbarium at Kew. Mr.
Rogers called 
attention to the fact that a similar variation of form occurred in the 
British maiden-hair fern, found by Mr. Tyerman in Cornwall, and now 
known as Adiantum Cornuhiense, which, like A.
Farleyense, is seldom 
found fertile when true to varietal form.
OvENDEN Naturalists' Society.
— The following mosses were obtained 
in the neighbourhood of Saddleworth by Mr. J.

deputation by the pressure of his professional duties.
The deputation 
arrived at Mr. Darwin's residence about 1 p.m., and was received in 
a most hearty manner by the great naturalist himself, Mrs. Darwin, 
and other members of the family, including Miss Darwin and Mr.
Francis Darwin.
Fortunately Mr. Darwin was in a much better 
state of health than he has enjoyed of late, and on that account the 
fears of the deputation that their visit might prove too fatiguing for 
him were happily not realised.
The members of the deputation were 
introduced individually to Dr. Darwin by Dr. Sorby, and then the 
interesting ceremony of the presentation of the address was pro- 
ceeded with.
Dr. Sorby stated that the Yorkshire Naturalists' Union, on whose 
behalf the deputation appeared, was a confederation of natural history 
societies which are located in various towns in the great county of 
York.
It was originally formed in 1861, but was reorganised and 
renamed in 1877 ; and at present there are twenty-seven societies in 
ths Union, with an aggregate of about 1,500 members.
Among the 
objects of the Union are the investigation of the natural history of 
the county in all its branches ; the combination and organisation of 
individual effort ; and the cultivation and diffusion of a taste for 
natural history pursuits.
The work of the Union is done by means 
of sections, each devoted to one department, after the plan of the 
British Association, and from time to time reports of what has been 
done are published in the form of Transactions.
The address was then read by Mr. Thomas Hick, and formally 
presented to Dr. Darwin by Dr. Sorby, who expressed the great 
gratification he personally felt in doing so.
Replying to the address.
Dr. Darwin assured the deputation of his deep sense of the honour 
the Yorkshire Naturalists' Union had conferred upon him on that 
occasion, and only regretted that he had not done something more 
deserving of such an honour.
He had no idea previously that there

was so strong a body of working naturalists in Yorkshire, but be was 
pleased to learn that such was the fact, and to find, from the Trans- 
actions that had been forwarded to him, that they were doing useful 
work.
Coming from such a body, the address was all the more 
gratifying to him, though he still feared he hardly merited the good 
things that had been said of him.
The address which had been 
presented to him, he and his family would for ever treasure and 
preserve, and he desired to express his warmest thanks, both to the 
deputation and those whom they represented, for it, and for the kind 
and considerate manner in which everything connected with it had 
been arranged.
Subsecjuently the deputation were entertained at luncheon, and 
having spent a short time ia familiar conversation with their 
distinguished host and his family, took their departure amid mutual 
expressions of kindness and regard.
The following is the text of the 
address, which is beautifully engrossed and illuminated by Mr. Chas.
Goodall, of Leeds, and very handsomely bound : — ^ 
To Charles Dabwin, LL.D., M.A., F.E.S., &c., &c.
Sir — The Council and Members of the Yorkshire Naturalists' Union, all 
of whom, with scarcely an exception, are working students in one or more 
of the various branches of natural history, desire to express to you in a 
most respectful manner, and jet with the greatest cordiality, their admir- 
ation of your life-long devotion to original scientific research, and their 
high appreciation of the almost unparalleled success of the investigations 
by which you have contributed largely to the modern development and 
progress of biological science.
More especially do they desire to congratulate you on the fact that 
your great work on " The Origin of Species " will come of age at an early 
date, amd that your life has been spared long enough to enable you to see 
the leading principles therein enunciated accepted by most of the eminent 
naturalists of the day.
On the conspicuous merits of that and your 
other published works they need not dwell, as those merits have been 
recognised and admitted even by those who have dissented most strongly 
from the conclusions at which you have arrived.
They may, neverthe- 
less, be permitted to remind you that your writings have been instru- 
mental in giving an impetus to biological and palseontological inquiries, 
•which has no precedent in the history of science, except perhaps in that 
which followed the promulgation of the gravitation theory by Newton, 
and that which was due to the discovery of the circulation of the blood 
by Harvey.
One of the most important results of your long-continued labours, and 
one for which you will be remembered with honour and reverence 
wherever and as long as the human intellect exerts itself in the pursuit 
Peesentation of Memorial to De. Daewix.
67 
of natural knowledge, is the scientific basis you have given to the grand 
doctrine of evolution.
Other naturalists, as you yourself have shown, had 
endeavoured to unravel the questions that had arisen respecting the 
origin, classification, and distribution of organic beings, and had even 
obtained faint glimpses of the transformation of specific forms.
But it 
was left to you to show, almost to demonstration, that the variations 
which species of plants and animals exhibit, and in natiu-al selection 
through the struggle for existence, we have causes at once natural, 
universal and efiective, wdiich of themselves are competent not only to 
explain the existence of the present races of living beings, but also to 
connect with them, and with one another, the long array of extinct forms 
with which the palaeontologist has made us familiar.
Further, the Yorkshire naturalists are anxious to place on record their 
firm conviction that in the care, the patience, and the scrupulous con- 
scientiousness with which all your researches have been conducted ; in 
the ingenuity of the experiments you have devised : and in the repeated 
verifications to which your results have been submitted by your own 
hands, you have furnished an example of the true method of biological 
inquiry that succeeding generations will deem it an honour to follow, and 
that cannot, but lead to still further conquests in the domain of organic 
nature.
In presenting this small tribute of their high regard and esteem, the 
members of the Yorkshire Naturalists' Union cannot but hope and pray 
that many years of happiness and usefulness may yet remain to you, and 
that our science and literature may be still further enriched with the 
results of your researches.

It is admirably expressed, 
and the engrossing seems to me an exquisite work of art.
I fear 
that I by no means deserve all that is said of me in the address ; but 
it shows the great kindness and sympathy of the senders.
Pray 
accept my best thanks for all the kind interest which you have 
shewn in the affair, and believe me, dear sir, yours faithfully,

ORTHOBONTIUM GRACILE.
By J.
Cash.
The discrepancy between Wilson's figure and the description of the 
peristome of this moss in the " Bryologia Britannica,' is certainly 
curious, and it were much to be desired that wa had some means of 
explaining it.
The species was unknown until, on the 25th March, 
1833, Mr. Wilson discovered it at Helsby, Cheshire ; and, as appears 
by his journal of that period, he devoted " nearly a whole day " (29th 
March) to making a drawing of it.
It is therefore certain that, so far 
as this drawing is concerned, no inaccuracy can have crept in from 
any want of care or pains bestowed upon the subject.
I happen to 
possess several tufts which were gathered by Afr. Wilson at the time 
named.
The packet is labelled, in his own writing, as follows : — 
" Bryum gracile (Wilson in Eng. Bot.
Suppl.
t. 2835.) Orthodon- 
tium lineare, Schwaeg.
Near Warrington, March, 1833.
On sand- 
stone rocks.
W. Wilson." 
The condition of these specimens indicates that they must have 
been gathered when the fructification had reached maturity.
Most of 
the lids are fallen ; in some cases they still adhere to the perfect 
capsule ; in a few, the lids, though adhering, are partially lifted ; and 
in one, at least, there is a calyptra in situ.
I sacrificed several cap- 
sules — one of which was just ripe, and full of spores — in order to 
elucidate the point which has been raised, namely, as to the 
comparative length of the internal processes of the peristome.
These processes I found in most instances fragmentary, as may be 
imagined in specimens nearly half a century old, but in one or two of 
the capsules they were still perfect, and the result of my examination 
was to confirm the accuracy of the figure in Bry. Brit.
The perfect 
cilia are unquestionably equal in length to the outer teeth of the 
peristome.
West : Buckinghamshiiie Lichens.

The figure in " English Botany Supplement," above referred to, is 
not identical with that which appears in Bry Brit.
; but in this, the 
older, figure — just as in Bry, Brit.
— the filiform processes are repre- 
sented fully as long as the external teeth.
I have no doubt that this 
English Botany figure is the one upon which Mr. Wilson bestowed so 
much pains on the 29th March, 1833.
The italics in the following 
passage, from the description which accompanies the figure in English 
Botany, make the Bryologia Britannica description all the more 
inexplicable : — 
" Outer peristome of sixteen pale yellow acuminated teeth, which 
in dry and mature specimens are strongly incurved so as to be con- 
cealed within the capsule.
Inner peristome a membrane divided 
almost to the base into sixteen very narrow filiform erect processes, as 
long as the outer peristome, without intermediate cilia." There are 
appended to this description the well-known initials, "  W.
W." 
Perhaps Mr. West will pardon me if I say that the Tunbridge 
locality is not new.
The credit of that discovery belongs to the late 
Mr. Borrer.
In a letter to Mr. Wilson, dated July 15th, 1844, 
referring to various mosses, he wrote : — " Ortliodontium gracile I have 
found on sand-rocks near Tunbridge Wells."

COLEOPTERA OF THE BROUGH AND MARKET 
WEIGHTON DISTRICT.
By E.
B. Wrigglbsworth.
All the beetles mentioned in the annexed catalogue were collected 
during the rambles of the Yorkshire Union of Naturalists at the 
above places, on the 10th June, 1878, and 4th Sept., 1880.
So far as my experience of these districts proves by two days' 
investigation, I am assured many good additions to our Yorkshire 
list might be added by a more careful and lengthened search.
There 
is probably no portion of our county better adapted to the habits and 
requirements of that numerous and interesting group of British 
beetles, the Hydradephaga, than this part of the East Riding.
The 
many ponds and dykes which line the roads in all directions give 
ample proof of their existence.
A more frequent examination of 
these spots might produce a rich harvest, especially in the large 
family Hydroporus, which I think is not so well known as it might 
be.
The extensive and varied flora of that neighbourhood, together 
with its situation near the coast, is also greatly in favour of its 
productiveness.
I am always glad to get over " new ground," and, in consequence, 
have often to be satisfied with small mercies ; but the two rambles 
here mentioned left nothing to be desired, save a wish to remain a

THE LEPIDOPTERA OF ARPAIST.
By Henry Lupton.
Believing that the Lepidoptera of the Isle of Arran are not much 
known, I purpose giving a short description of what we observed 
there during a few days in July this year.
Mr. G.
H. Kenrick of 
Birmingham, Mr. W.
Buckton of Leeds, and myself spent from the 
6th to the IGth of July on the island ; with one or two slight excep- 
tions we had fine weather, and generally a gentle breeze.
We made 
Brodick the head-quarters for the first three days, and afterwards slept 
at Corrie, six miles further up the coast.
As we had no information 
respecting localities for insects, we were unable to do so well as we 
might have done, had we known where to work for diff'erent 
insects.
The total number of species observed is divided into 13 
butterflies, 15 bombyces, 26 noctuse, and 32 geometry; we did not 
collect micros.
LurTON : The Lepidopteea of Arran.
73 
As is frequently the case when in pursuit of insects, what appeared 
to be a favourable spot or a good evening for them, turned out often 
very badly.
Sugaring was very discouraging at Brodick ; we sugared, 
on two nights, palings for the distance of a mile at the side of a 
plantation, and very near an open moor of heather, &c., and the only 
result was one common Noctua.
At Corrie we sugared on four evenings — twice in one place, and 
twice in another, both times on low levels near the coast.
One evening 
we counted nine moths of the five commonest species that visit sugar, 
and on the other three nights not even so many.
Netting, both in the 
daytime and in the evening, produced by far the most insects ; the 
best we got in the evenings were Dasydia ohfuscata, Pelurga comitaia, 
Hepialus velleda, and Agrotis vallige.ra.
Obfuscata is, I think, the best 
insect we took ; this we found a mile from Brodick, on the Lamlash- 
road, on a small piece of moorland, and for about half an hour on two 
evenings it was tolerably abundant.
During the rest of our stay we 
only met with three specimens in other localities — one at rest on rock, 
and two flying.
Gomitata occurred one evening on the sandhills at 
North Sannox, and we ca[)tured ten.
Valligera also occurred there, 
and on one evening only we took five, over flowers.
Velleda was 
tolerably abundant on several evenings.
During the daytime, by searching trees, palings, &c., we found one 
Hadena contigua, several Cymatophora duplaris one Notodonta camel- 
ina, one Ellopia Jasciaria, Venusia cambrica abundantly, one fine 
variety of Boarmia repandata, Larentia coesiata, and Cidaria imma- 
nata in thousands ; several Coremia propugnata and Tanagra choero- 
fhyllata.
By beating the trees, most of which are birch and alder, 
we obtained a few larvae, viz : — N.
dictoeoides, N.
dromedarius and N.
ziczac, G.
ridens.
A. menyanthidis, three Drepana % (which died), 
and S.
illastraria.
On heath and heather we found L.
quercus and 
carpini, the latter abundant ; these were full fed by Aug. 15th.
The following were also observed on the island : — 
P. hraesicse 
P. rap£e 
P. napi 
S. Jaiiira 
S. Semele, a few at Catacol, rather 
small and dark

Arran is easily accessible from the centre of Yorkshire in twelve 
hours, via Ardrossan, and a fortnight can be spent there very well 
without exhausting all the points of interest.
There is one large 
hotel at Brodick ; in the other villages hotel accommodation is limited, 
but as far as our experience went, it was clean and comfortable.
The 
summit of Goatfell (about 3000 feet) is the highest point in the island, 
and from it we get extensive views of the mainland and the Isles of 
Bute on one side, and on the other the Mull of Cantyre and (on fine 
days) the Irish coast.
Goatfell can be ascended from Brodick in two 
hours and a half.
Should I go again, I should endeavour to make a 
better acquaintance with the west side of the island, which I hardly 
know.
Catacol would make a good point to .start from, and then 
work down the coast by Blackwater Foot and round by Whiting Bay 
and Lamlash.
I have no doubt that there is much to be done entomo-

Correction.
— The hepatic recorded in the Naturalist for last month as 
Porella pinnata, is not that species, but P.
rivnlaris.
I first doubtfully 
named it Phragmicoma MacJ::uii (as I had not seen either that species or 
P. rivnlaris), and sent it to Mr. Lees as such, who shortly afterwards 
replied — Your Phragmicoma Mackaiiis Porella pinnata Ldg., in which 
name I am positively confirmed by Dr. Carrington." Of course I bowed 
to this decision, though I could not make it agree with Cooke's description 
and figure.
The figure in the same work of P.
rivnlaris, with serrate 
leaves, is apt to mislead, as all the above specimens had entire leaves.
Another more experienced person than myself said '^my Phragmicoma 
appeared to be right.
" Mr. Pearson has made a thorough examination, 
of the specimen, with the above result.
On page 54, line 10, read 
" which IJirst named Timmia " for ''which I find named Timmia.'" On 
the same page, line 22, omit "hacV On page 60, line 11, insert " Douk 
Ghyll " after lacunosum.

The ''Miller's Thuzje.
"— On the 16th of February, 1876, a green 
sandpiper was sent into Is orwich to be stuff'ed, which had choked itself 
with a small " Miller's Thumb." I saw both the bird and the fish.
This 
is not an uncommon event with Dabchicks.

of the water rail.
I find a note of my father's dated 3Ist Jan..
1838, of 
an instance of the kind.
He says : — " Water rail.
— On the morning of 
this day (the 31st), one of these birds was found dead, in a ditch on 
these meadows (Earlham, near Norwich), with a miller's thumb about 
three inches in length in its mouth.
The broad head of the fish had 
stuck in the bird's throat ; the two small sharp spines with which it is 
armed on each side of the head being fixed in the inside coat of the rail's 
throat, having one of them actually perforated through the outer skin as 
well, sufibcation had ensued.
About two inches of the tail part of the 
fish was hanging out of the water rail's mouth.
As the bird was in very 
good condition it would not appear that it had been pressed by hunger to 
swallow so large a morsel.
The bird was only just dead and was brought 
to me in exactly the state which I have described, and so firmly was the 
fish fixed that I was obliged to have recourse to a corkscrew to extract it 
from the throat of the bird.
The water rail would appear not to be very 
select in its diet.
In the York Museum the throat of one is preserved, 
which was choked by the swelling of some large peas which it had 
swallowed, and which are still to be seen in the dried gullet." — J.

Dasypolia Templi, &c.
— Dasypolia Templi has this autumn again been 
very plentiful in the Huddersfield district, and has been taken in large 
numbers by difierent collectors.
Celoena Haworthii, too, I found in 
abundance on the Marsden moors, early in September.

Watching a Beetle.
— I think I have discovered something new in 
the economy of a beetle, the identical specimen I enclose.
I was sitting 
on a rock at Sea Point, (a suburb of Cape Town), smoking and thinking 
of the beautiful sea which was busy in its efibrts to dislodge the spotted 
mineral boulders, when I noticed my gentleman walking about intent on 
spoil.
First he went in for a feed off the flower (also enclosed with its 
leaf), which I presume is a kind of dandelion.
Off he trudged again, and 
after a long promenade, came to a dead standstill.
What's up 1 queried 
I. He raised himself gently on his forelegs, and lifted his abdomen aloft, 
then allowed it to fall with (for him) a very large noise as the result ; this 
he repeated several times, and then walked off again.
At each small 
pebbly place, succeeding a run of green grass or vegetation, he stopped 
and tapped again.
Suddenly I noticed a sort of spider jump up from 
underneath one of the stones, and the beetle " jawed " him up like a shot.
Excuse tlus unscientific language, please, but it is very expressive.
Now I,

want to know if this is the method in which our friend obtains his 
delicacies ; but whether or not, I venture to think the fact is worth 
knowing.
I shall be particular in watching the species further.
Quite a 
couple of hours were devoted to Mr. Beetle, when I was obliged to run to 
catch our departing steamer.
I have enclosed specimens, also a small 
co3kroach, the pest of the vessel, and a species of Zygoena (found in 
swarms at Kondebosch, near Cape Town), and I want you to get me the 
names of all three, as they will be useful to me.

letter to Mr. Porritt.) 
Rocks Microscopically Examined.
— On the 22nd of November, Mr.
Thomas Tate, F.G.S., delivered an address before the Leeds Geological 
Association, in the Yorkshire College (chairman.
Professor Green, 
M.A., F.G.S.
,j his subject being — " The Determination of the Mineral 
Constituents of Eruptive Pocks Microscopically." The optical behaviour 
of mineral crystals in thin slices beneath the microscope may be observed 
in four ways.
By transmitted light they appear either colourless, 
coloured, or opaque.
They may next be examined by the polariser alone, 
when some will shew alterations of the colour from light to dark shades 
as the polariser is rotated (dichroism), while others will remain unaffected 
(non-dichroic).
If the analyser be now added, those minerals which 
depolarise light will give more or less brilliant chromatic effects when the 
polariser is rotated (anisotropic) ; while other crystals will give no colour 
changes, but will merely darken between crossed prisms (isotropic).
The 
glassy forms, for example (obsidian, tachylite, .
&c, ), are isotropic.
The 
commonest colourless sections are those of quartz, felspars, leucite, nephe- 
line, enstatite, olivine, apatite, all of which are usually anistropic save 
leucite, which grows dark between crossed Nicols, and apatite, which 
remains bright in all positions of the prisms.
Enstatite is also dichroic.
Muscovite, brotite, hornblende, hypersthene, augite, and diallage are 
coloured — anistropic and dichroic — except the last two, which are non- 
dichroic.
Magnetite and iron-pyrites are opaque ; but viewed by reflected 
light, the former is of a leaden and the latter of a brassy hue.
The 
advantages which this most recent method of research offers are very 
decided.
By it the investigator is enabled to determine most accurately 
the character and relative amounts of the constituent minerals present in 
compact micro-crystalline rocks, whose constitution has been hitherto 
little more than guessed.
The large crystals in rocks having a more 
granite structure, are by this method often found to be crowded with 
enclosures of foreign minerals entangled during the process of con- 
solidation, the presence of which, in hand specimens, would be unsuspected, 
but which must vitiate their chemical analysis ; and this fact, revealed by 
the microscope, doubtless accounts for the wide variation in the published 
percentage of the chemical elementary constituents.
Further, by a care- 
ful study of the glassy forms, with their fluxion structure of streaming 
microliths or embryo crystals surrounding the entangled crystals, and the 
78 
The Naturalist.
spheralitic structures subsequently developed^ or by tracing the sequence 
in which the minerals have crystallised out of the fused magma, and the 
order in which these crystals have been caught up and imprisoned within 
each other, the observer is enabled to work out the life-history both of 
the rock mass and its individual particles, and to read in legible characters 
the natural history of the eruptive rocks.
Mr, Tate exhibited original 
drawings and microscopical slides of igneous rocks, including a series 
prepared from chippings made by workmen in paving the streets of Leeds.

Barnsley Naturalists' Society.
— Meeting Nov. 9th, Mr. T.
Lister 
presiding.
— Several communications to him were read by the president, 
with observations made by others.
The most important features were 
the late stay of summer migrants, notwithstanding the severe season and 
ice-storms experienced.
On October 23, swallows in small flocks were 
seen by Mr. Lister near the town, and on the telegraph wires at Darfield ; 
stragglers Nov. 6 by T.
Rose, and Nov. 8 by E.
Brady, jun.
— both near 
the town, and one obtained at Redditch, near Manchester, Nov. 9th.
Martins noted nearly as late (Nov. 4) over the Calder, reported by 
Mr. F.
Laxton, Brighouse ; five seen on the 5th by Mr. T.
Dymond, of 
Burntwood Hall, near Barnsley.
A swallow was reported Nov. 4th, by 
Mr. T.
Ormerod, of Brighouse, near the canal there.
These cases show 
a wide range of occurrence, and mostly in companies — contrary to the 
experience of some good naturalists this season.

Grange Abbey, and chifi"chaff heard by Mr. Tomlinson, woodman, at New 
Park Spring ; same day, Ray's wagtail seen in numbers with the pied 
wagtail, the resident species, in Dodworth-road.
A puffin, inland, was 
sent to the president by Mr. W, Dransfield, of Penistone ; it was caught 
in a field Nov. 2nd, fed on flesh, and died two days afterwards.
It 
proved a young puffin (the bill not being developed), with the peculiar 
form which obtains for the adult bird the name of sea parrot, and is a 
rare visitant here.
Of winter visitants, the jacksnipe was reported by 
Mr. J.
W. Salter ; it had been wounded, and probably stayed all summer.
He saw the great grey shrike Oct. 23 (very rare), the tree creeper and 
coletit at Nostell, also herons, kingfishers, wigeons and scaup duck.
Mr.
E. Hailstone reports (Nov. 6) ^' wigeons have come back to Walton Lake, 
and a stoat was caught on the island before the Hall, which had gone 
over the bridge." Several kestrels, a sparrow hawk, sea-gulls, and 
hooded crows have been noted about Barnsley, and field-fares, in flocks, 
were seen Oct. 2nd.

BIED-LIFE AT THE FAENE ISLANDS.
Wm. Eagle Claeke, 
MEMBEB OF THE BRITISH OEKITHOLOGISTS' THMON.
There is not, so far as my experience goes, a more interesting scene 
tlian that afforded by a visit to one of the great breeding stations of 
the sea-fowl at the height of the season.
Here, assembled within a 
limited area, for a period extending over a few weeks, are vast 
numbers of birds which at other times are scattered far and wide 
over ocean and shore, then displaying a nature of extreme 
wariness and suspicion, but now to be approached within a few yards, 
thus affording to the field-naturalist a golden opportunity of making 
himself familiar with their habits and plumage — to do which is his 
special aim.
To the ornithologist, such a habitat is a perfect 
paradise, and even the outsider must indeed be callous to the claims 
of Nature on our attention, for whom the scene has not a charm.
As a breeding station, the Fame Islands present more than 
ordinary interest, owing to a greater number of species resorting to 
them than is usually found in like stations off the English coast ; in 
this respect they are quite remarkable, and it is doubtful if they are 
surpassed by any other locality in the British Isles, certainly by none 
if area be taken into consideration.
Another interesting feature is, 
they mark almost the southern boundary of the distribution of the 
eider duck in the breeding season, in fact the few miles from Coquet 
Island to the Tweed include all the English localities in which it 
breeds ; this being the chief of them.
On two occasions have I 
visited these islands — on the 18th of May, 1876, and on the 12th of 
June, 1877 ; and I propose to go over the scenes of my second visit, 
making such allusions to the first as may be desirable.
Of course 
such scenes can only meet with very inadequate treatment from the 
pen.
The Fames are a group of islets, rocks, and reefs, over twenty in 
number, composed chiefly of basalt, lying off the Northumberland 
coast near to its northern limit ; the nearest and largest island, known 
as Fame Island, is about two miles from the mainland, and the 
others stretch away from it in a north-easterly direction for a 
distance of three miles.
They may be reached by boat either from 
North Sunderland or Bamborough, both of which are a few miles from 
the railway from Newcastle to Berwick.

The Naturalist.
The morning of the 12th June, 1877, found a couple of kindred 
spirits and myself on the beach, ready to embark ; the weather was 
fine, but what is known as " roaky " — that is, a white sea mist 
prevailed.
The sea was calm, and the breeze favourable.
After an 
hour's sail we made the Longstone, arriving amidst the hideous 
blasts of that ingenious piece of mechanism, the American fog-horn, 
which fortunately ceased very shortly after we landed, the mist 
having lifted, and the sun shining brilliantly, which it continued to 
do for the remainder of the day.
The Longstone, the outermost of 
the group but one (a mere rock), is famed for having been the home 
of Grace Darling, and the surrounding sea the scene of that exploit 
which has rendered her name a household word.
The first sight which attracted attention, on nearing the Long- 
stone, was a fiock of terns fishing — a most interesting and beautiful 
spectacle, especially when viewed from a distance of only a few yards.
The elegant forms, delicate plumage, and graceful flight of the birds 
were seen to perfection as, hovering over the glassy surface of the 
sea at an elevation of some twenty feet, their hooded heads with coral 
beak down-turned, intent upon their finny prey, their deeply forked 
tails depressed, now winnowing the air with their long sharp 
wings, and now precipitating themselves, gently breaking the surface 
with a splash, and immediately rising with their wriggling silvery 
prey.
It was indeed a sight not to be forgotten.
On the Longstone a colony of arctic and common terns were 
nesting, their innumerable eggs being scattered in ones, twos, and 
threes on the shingle above high-water mark, so thickly crowded 
together that great care was necessary to avoid breaking some of 
them whilst selecting a few varieties for the cabinet.
It is quite 
impossible to discriminate between the eggs of the two birds, of 
which the arctic species is by far the most abundant on the islands ; 
both were easily identified as they hovered over us, screeching the whole 
time of our intrusion ; the greater length of the tail and the darker 
plumage of the upper surface being distinguishing features of the 
arctic tern.
In the midst of this great collection, forming quite a 
distinct group by themselves, were about a dozen of the beautiful 
eggs of the Sandwich tern.
This is a much larger bird than the 
others, and the beating of the pinions deep and springy.
Amongst 
this same crowd was a single egg of the oyster-catcher, the owner of 
which, in its pied coat, saluted us with its flute-like kweep, kweep^ 
from an adjoining rock.
Clarke : Bird-Life at the Farne Islands.
83 
The next island visited, the Xorth Wamses, is the great breeding 
resort of the puffin ; having in former years abounded in rabbits, 
this bird finds a congenial nesting-place in the old burrows with 
which the turf is honeycombed, but it is, however, supposed that they 
frequently excavate fresh burrows for themselves.
The eggs are best 
obtained by lifting the friable mass of hummocky turf containing 
the burrow, and turning it over, leaving exposed Mrs. Puffin on her 
solitary egg, which, in a few instances, is cradled on some green 
herbage, an apology for a nest.
She is very loth to quit her treasure, 
and after being cautiously lifted off, will sit at your feet, apparently 
quite unconcerned, eyeing you quaintly all the time.
Another method 
is to insert the hand an arm's length into the burrow and withdraw 
I the bird ; this requires due caution, and should be performed with a 
thickly-gloved hand, for the bird resents forcible ejection, and its beak 
is a weapon not to be despised.
Most of the eggs are coated with 
peat, which when removed leaves a whitish egg faintly marked with 
brown and purple.
At this date they were in an advanced stage of 
incubation, but on the 18th of May, the year before, fresh eggs were 
plentiful.
It is a pleasure to be able to state that this species has 
i largely increased in numbers since the days of Mr. W.
C. Hewitson, 
the author of our standard work on British Birds' Eggs, and a gentle- 
man thoroughly acquainted with the avifauna of the Fames.
Numerous nests of the lesser black-backed gull, the most abundant 
species occurring on the islands, are deposited in the depressions of 
the rock and turf; they are large structures of coarse grass lined 
with finer grass, and occasionally a few feathers.
On this visit th» 
eggs had been systematically taken during the past four weeks for 
sale on the mainland, where they are highly prized for domestic 
purposes, and I was much struck by the smaller size and the fantastic 
colouring and marking of the eggs, which exhibited a wide divergence 
from the typical specimens.
Some of these had the appearance of 
having been dipped in ink, others were pale blue, and many had huge 
blotches of black and other tints.
Xo doubt by some persons these 
would be considered as fine varieties, but in my opinion it is to be 
attributed to degeneration, the result of over-production from frequent 
robbing.
On the 18th of May, 1876, 1 accompanied the keeper on his 
first visit to the islands that season, for the purpose of taking the 
eggs.^ They were then very numerous, and of a large type, showing 
very little variety both as regards ground colour and markings, the 
former being a clear pale brown or a clear pale green — the former, 
however, being the prevailing tint, spotted somewhat finely with 
84 
The Naturalist.
various deeper tints.
The lesser black-back is essentially the gull of 
the Fames, They immediately assail the visitor, on his landing, 
with their discordant croakings, which are incessant during the 
intrusion.
They are to a certain degree fearless, those alighting 
allowing a close inspection of their blue-black backs, which contrast 
grandly with the snowy head and under surface, and their lemon- 
coloured legs and richer yellow bills.
Accompanying them annually 
are a few, very few, pairs of the.
herring gall, at once recognisable by 
their paler, dove-coloured backs and flesh-coloured legs.
The eggs of 
this species, if wanted, must be here obtained by watching the bird 
on to the nest — a precaution necessary for their identification, the 
eggs and nest being indistinguishable from those of the lesser black- 
back.
There were also several nests of the eider duck on this island, 
placed in hollows between the rocks, and in situations similar to 
those of the lesser black-back ; they were entirely composed of down 
of a smoky brown tint, the shafts at the ^omt of insertion being paler, 
giving to the structure a spotted appearance.
Eider down is not 
white, as many suppose.
This down the duck plucks from her body 
as incubation proceeds, until a large nest of down, held together by 
small particles of dry stalks, &c., has accumulated, in which the eggs 
(usually five in number) are almost hidden.
On my visit in May, 
1876, only three nests were found; two of them contained a couple 
of eggs which had been carefully covered with fresh-plucked weeds 
by the old duck on leaving.
These nests did not then contain a particle 
of down, but were wholly composed of dry grass.
When leaving the 
nest, the bird sometimes leaves her eggs covered with liquid excre- 
ment of a pale brownish-white colour ; this may be due to fright, for 
I only observed it in cases where the bird was actually put off the 
nest.
I believe that the mottled green appearance of most of the 
eggs is caused by this, for those in the nests containing one or two 
eggs only were of an uniform even pale green.
Single eider's eggs 
were found in several instances in the nests of the lesser black- 
backed gull, attributable no doubt to their own nests being taken 
before the complement of eggs had been laid.
In 1876 a detachment of cormorants from the headquarters on the 
Megstone had nested for the first time on the South Wamses, and I 
took a few of their chalk-coated eggs from their tall nests built up of 
seaweed to a height of about two feet, lined with dry grasses and 
finer seaweed, and in one or two cases a few feathers.
On approaching 
this island, which was the first one visited in 1876, these birds 
erected their tall gaunt forms, looking from a distance like so many

85 
cliampagne bottles ; they soon after took fliglit, and we had to make 
all haste to the nests to anticipate the gulls, ever ready to pounce 
down upon exposed eggs.
The stench from the nests and the dung 
of the birds was already considerable, but nothing to what it would 
be when incubation has advanced, when it becomes unbearable.
This 
year (1877) the cormorants again wished to take up their old 
quarters, but the gulls objected, and their numbers prevailing, the 
cormorants had to retire to their companions on the Megstone, which 
has been their station from of old.
Every egg from this colony on 
the ]\Iegstone had been taken by some scoundrels from the mainland, 
and as the season was then advanced, it is tolerably certain that the 
Fames in 1877 did not contribute to the numbers of this species.
The Brownsman Island is the home of numbers of gulls and the 
smaller terns.
Eiders are, perhaps, more numerous on this island than 
elsewhere in the group ; under the old wall, in front of the keeper's 
house and the old buildings, is a favourite haunt of the bird, which 
at this season becomes remarkably tame, allowing an approach to 
within a couple of feet of the nest without showing the least sign of 
alarm, and many may even be stroked as they sit on the nest.
The 
nests on this island are chiefly placed amongst nettles and other 
herbage.
Xumerous eider drakes in their handsome black-and-white 
plumage were floating peacefully on the sea or resting on the rocks 
at the water's edge.
The duck, in her sober brown and grey dress, 
is a great contrast to her lord.
Both are heavily built birds, weighing 
some six pounds, and have massive heads.
On this island we obtained 
two nests, with eggs, of the rock pipit, a species not uncommon here.
The nest, which is placed on the ground, is a rather loose structure 
of dry grasses.
Staples Island is chiefly attractive on account of its being adjacent 
to the ''Pinnacles," a stack of three isolated basaltic columns about 
forty feet high, which lie only a few yards, perhaps ten, off it.
To 
stand on this island, opposite to, and on a level with the tops of the 
Pinnacles is one of the sights of the Fames   the flat summits of 
these columns are the only breeding-places offered by the islands at all 
suited to the requirements of the gnillemot.
Here they sit perfectly 
upright, and huddled together as closely as possible.
The eggs are 
almost as thickly laid, and so crowded that when the birds take flight 
in a body, they are accompanied by a shower of their eggs.
When 
thus uncovered the eggs, especially the intense blue-green ones, have 
a very beatitiful appearance as they lay on a surface perfectly whitened 
with the dung of the l)irds.
The Pinnacles can r)nly be approached 
86 
The NA.TUEALI8T.
in the calmest weather, and are to be ascended by the aid of a ladder 
and a chain hung from the top of one of them ; with these, it is not a 
yery difficult task to reach the summit.
On the sides of the Pinnacles 
we also look down upon several nests of the kittiwake, glued as it 
were to the inequalities on the face of the perpendicular rock — 
seemingly a most precarious position.
There are also several more 
on the face of the cliff on whose brink we stand.
These nests are 
composed of seaweed and grass ; on some the birds are sitting ; 
others are uncovered, showing the eggs ; whilst a few of these elegant 
birds sail beneath, almost within arm's reach.
There too sits a 
solitary female shag ; she has no nest, but according to Mr. John 
Hancock (" Birds of Northumberland and Durham this species has 
nested on the Fames in one or two instances.
A few pairs of the 
razorbill are also nesting in the crevices, but the guillemots object to 
their presence so close to their domain, and this, together with the 
limited space of suitable breeding ground — for it is confined to this 
single site — accounts for this being one of the scarcest species here.
Its single egg is tolerably safe, in the cleft, from the spoon and rod 
used to obtain it and those of the kittiwake.
The Knoxes, the next island we visited, is one of the principal 
haunts of the terns ; here they are found amongst the herbage, which 
is abundant.
We had expected to find eggs of the Sandwich tern 
among the great numbers lying around, but only a single specimen 
was seen.
The eider was also nesting, several nests with eggs being 
observed, and a flock of about thirty birds flew off as we landed.
On 
the reef lying on the north, which is connected with the island at low 
water, known as the Knoxes Eeef, terns' eggs were very abundant, 
being thickly scattered over the shingle and on the hard-dried sea- 
weed.
Amongst this immense collection were a cluster of the eggs of 
the Sandwich tern, from which we selected a few contrasting varieties 
for our collections.
The variety with the white tinted ground colour 
was greatly in the ascendant.
A nest and eggs of the oyster-catcher 
was also among this assemblage, and numerous empty depressions 
prettily surrounded with shells and white stones, the nest of this 
bird, were noted.
The ring dotterel, a pair or two of which nest on 
all the islands suitable, viz., having a sandy or fine shingly beach, 
had also a nest, or rather a depression scratched in the shingle, 
containing three eggs, our last find on the Fames.
We have now 
worked our way back to Fame Island, the innermost of the group^ 
on which we did not land, for it does not afford the attractions of the 
other islands, having a lighthouse and several other erections upon it.
HoBKiRK : How TO Examine a Moss.
87 
On one of tlie islands the keeper (who resides during the season on 
the Brownsman) knew of a nest of the sheldrake, in burrow, con- 
taining thirteen eggs, which he did not wish to have disturbed.
This 
species only breeds occasionally on the islands, but many nest on the 
extensive links of the mainland.
From the above account it will be gathered that no less than four- 
teen species breed annually on the Fames ; and occasionally two 
others, the shag and the sheldrake.
Formerly a few pairs of that 
beautiful bird, the roseate tern, visited the group during the summer, 
associating with the mob of commoner members of its genus, and 
laying in their company ; but persecution has banished them from 
their former haunts, and I am afraid a similar fate awaits the Sandwich 
tern ; it can only be a question of time, for Mr. Hewitson some 
twenty-five years ago, speaks of the "many hundreds" of eggs of 
this species, on the Fames.
I should now be almost afraid to describe 
them as many tens.
There can be no doubt that the Fames are most 
unmercifully and openly robbed, to say nothing of the extensive 
poaching which prevails.
During the day we watched a pair of red-throated divers and 
several gannets fishing off the islands, exhibiting a great contrast 
in their modes of proceeding.
The lithe forms of the divers dis- 
appeared almost without rippling the surface, whilst the gannets 
dropped like thunderbolts from a considerable height, pluL'ging into 
the water amidst a cloud of spray.
In conclusion, I think we may fairly venture to assert that a day 
on the Fames is a veritable " multum in parvo for the lover of 
Nature.
Leeds, Dec. 17th, 1880.
HOW TO EXAMINE A MOSS.
By C.
p. Hobkirk, F.L.S, 
(GontiQiued.) 
In our last paper, we left off with the split capsule, laid open on a 
slide under the microscope, for the purpose of examining the teeth of the 
peristome.
Now, you will invariably find that w'hen there is a peristome 
at all, whether single or double, the number of the teeth is always four 
or a multiple of four, i.e., either 4, 16, 32, or 64.
You will find that 
our moss has sixteen of these teeth, but if you do not examine it 
carefully you may be deceived, and suppose there a-re thircy-twOj 
88 
The Naturalist.
because you can count thirty-two points, but if you look carefully you 
will see that there are really only sixteen teeth, and that each is biiid 
or split nearly down to the base, and that they are placed at equal 
distances from one another, forming a regular series round the mouth.
You mil further observe, that across these teeth, or rather across the 
segments of each tooth below, are a number of transverse bars, in part 
joining the segments together, and called trabeculse, (from trdbs^ a beam, 
trahecula, a little beam) ; and that each tooth is composed of two layers?
one, the outside, of deep lake or crimson colour, the other, the internal 
one yellow, and that the yellow one projects on either side beyond the 
red one, being the wider of the two.
If this capsule be ripe or nearly so, 
and it should be, to be properly examined, you may find that your vision 
of it is much obscured and hindered by a great number of little dot- 
like bodies floating about it in the water on the slide.
These are the 
spores, of which more hereafter ; at present they are in your way, and 
must be got rid of.
This may be done by gently washing them away 
with a wet camel's hair brush, and then placing the capsule on another 
clean slide with water.
If now you examine another capsule with a good hand magnifier, 
you will find that its general shape is cylindrical, that it stands nearly 
upright from the stem which supports it, called the seta {seta, a hair or 
bristle), or sometimes you will find it a little inclined from the perpen- 
dicular.
This is a character found in many capsules of other 
genera, but note particularly that on one side, near the base, there is a 
little protuberance, caUed a struma, hence it is said to be strumose 
{struma, a swelling in the neck, a wen,) and that there are a 
number of lines or low ridges running from the apex to the base ; it 
is thus what is called striated {stria, a ridge).
Having made yourselves so far master of the structure of the gener- 
ative organs of your moss, turn to the analytical key at the beginning 
of Wilson's Bryologia, or my Synopsis, which is nearly, but not quite 
the same.
You find your moss is acrocarpous, of division B, capsule 
with a deciduous lid : Sect.
II, peristome single : Sub-div.
II, calyptra 
dimidiate : b.
calyptra not inflexed at the base : * * * teeth 16, deeply 
bifid, equidistant : J J J capsule cernuous or inclined, unequal ; and on 
reading over the first generic diagnoses under this section, you wiU 
find your moss is of the genus Ceratodon (see p.
11, Hobk.
Syn.) You 
have now attained the first step in your examining process, and should, 
on having reached this point, have gained some considerable insight 
into the structure of mosses generally ; at the same time, the method 
you have been pursuing is, in its main features, a purely artificial 
Ellis : Coleopteea of Liverpool and Neighbouehood.
89 
method, and in that respect resembles the Linnean system of counting 
the anthers and stigmas among the flowering plants, thereby grouping 
together very dissimilar genera, which in a natural system would be 
placed much further apart.
At the same time, for a beginner it is 
useful, like the Linnean system, in enabling you to get at the genus of 
a moss without much trouble.
You will further observe that in this 
key, as we may call it, the greatest stress is laid upon the presence or 
absence of the peristome, and, when present, of the number of teeth, for 
the purpose of forming the sections and the genera.
This method 
is, however, now gradually becoming discarded, and a more natural 
grouping — as in flowering plants — is being adopted.
Such genera as 
Pottia (1.
c. p.
2) and Anacalypta (1.
c. p.
9), which in this artificial 
system are in two distinct divisions, the former being without peristome, 
and the latter having a single peristome, are by the more natural 
system not only placed in the same division^ but are made into one 
genus, viz., Pottia, having a certain number of species bearing a 
peristome, and the remainder without.
There can be no question but that in a few years the natural 
arrangement, when it has been further perfected, wdll entirely supersede 
this artificial method, as a means of grouping and determining the 
limits of genera, just as has obtained amongst the flowering plants.
No botanist now ever uses the old Linnean artificial method, either in 
grouping or in endeavouring to make out the name of any flowering 
plant, and the same thing will certainly ensue amongst the mosses.
In 
the latest propounded natural system, that of the late Dr. August 
Jaegar, our genus Ceratodon is grouped under the 7th Tribe Pottiacae, 
instead of being in juxtaposition with such genera as Fissidens and 
Bicranum, as we find in this artificial method.
There is only one 
species of the genus found in Britain, yiz.
, purpureus so that having 
found out our genus, we have in this case also found the specific name.
C. cylindricus, of Wilson's Bry. and Hobk.
Syn., is now removed to 
another genus, Trichodon.

COLEOPTERA OF LIVERPOOL AND NEIGHBOURHOOD.
By John W.
Ellis, L.R.S.C.E.
In looking through the pages of the " Flora of Liverpool " recently, it 
occurred to me that a list, with localities, of the beetles found in our 
neighbourhood, compiled after the plan of the " Flora," might be of 
service to those entomologists who include the coleoptera in their 
90 
The Naturalist.
studies.
With tlie exception of two papers — one on tlie Geodephaga, 
the other on the Hydradephaga of the district, read before the 
Historic Society of I^ancashire and Cheshire by Mr. Charles S.
Gregson, which papers are printed in the Transactions of that society 
for 1861-2 — and a few remarks on coleoptera new to the district by 
by Mr. F.
Archer, in the Liverpool Naturalists' Scrap-book (vol.
1 67- 
169), we possess no list of our coleoptera.
Having therefore to rely 
on the collections of myself and friends (with the exception of the two 
groups mentioned above, where Mr. Gregson has ably paved a way 
for me), it will be an impossibility to give a complete list of our 
species ; but, since a poor list is better than no list at all, as it may 
form the basis of a more perfect one, I trust that my endeavours in 
this direction will meet with approbation.
I intend to devote this occasion to a consideration of the species of 
the group Geodephaga, of which, according to Dr. Sharp's Catalogue, 
we possess 311 British species.
In the list of Geodephaga of the 
district alluded to above, Mr. Gregson enumerated about 140 species 
as having been taken in our neighbourhood ; since this time Mr.
Archer has added one species — Anchomenus puellus, D ; Mr. F.
Kinder has added three species, viz., Amara hifrons, Gyll., A.
plebsia, 
Gyll., and h'arpalus pemeticoUis^ Pk. I myself have added seven 
species to this list, viz., Notiophilus substriatus, Wat.
; Dromius meridio- 
nalis, D.; Anchomenus atratus, Duft.
; Ani&odactylus poeciloides (Steph.; 
Barpalus tardus^ Px.
; Ilarpalus iynavus, Duft.
; and Bembitlum 
guttula, F.
This addition of eleven species gives us a local list of 
nearly half the Geodephaga occurring in Britain.
Although we have lost a few of Mr. Gregson's localities — such as 
Wallasey Pool by the formation of the Birkenhead Docks, and the

doubt not that if the high lands about Heswell and Thurstastoa^ on 
the marshy land between Bidstow and Leasowe (through which the 
rivers Birket and Tender wend their way), were explored, we should 
find new localities for many of the more local species, in addition to 
species new to our district.

Flying about the barest sandhills on both sides of the 
river, on the hottest days of summer.
The variety (if it is a variety 
only) maj'itima — which is, I believe the usual form on the south

Stormy Petrels at Hegkmondwike — Two good specimens of the 
stormy petrel were caught on the 27th October — the one in the lower 
part and the other in the upper part of the open valley.
They 
appeared to have been forced to the ground by the heavy fall of wet snow 
which had taken place during the previous night.
Both died, but were 
preserved and mounted.

between 21bs.

contained roe.
On the 27th November, at the 
same pond, I caught another weighing one and-a-half pounds, full of 
spawn, well developed.
Is it usual for pike to contain spawn in autumn ?
I was under the impression they deposited it from March to June.

Great Grey Shrie:e at Scarborough.
— It may interest readers of the 
Katuralist to know that a fine specimen of the great grey shrike was seen 
in this neighbourhood on the 11th of this month, about four miles from 
Scarbro', near Hackness.
I had a capital opportunity of observing it, 
and its appearance and action are capitally described by Yarrell, so that 
I had no difficulty in identifying it from liis account of it.

Obitnary — Mr. F.
T, Bucklaxd.
— We regret that we have this month 
to record the death of iMr. Francis Trevelyan Buckland (better known as 
Frank Buckland), which took place at his residence, 37, Albany-street, on 
Sunday, the 19th ult.
He was the eldest son of the Very Rev. Wilham 
Buckland, D.D., Dean of Westminster, and was born Dec. 17th, 1826.
He was a scholar of Winchester College, and student of Cluist Church, 
Oxford, where he took his B.A. degree in 1818.
Inheriting from his 
father a strong taste for physical science and natural history, he devoted 
himseh to the study of medicine, and having served the office of house 
surgeon to St. George's Hospital, became, in 1851, assistant-surgeon to 
the 2nd Life Guards, from which post he retired in 1863.
He was an 
extensive contributor of papers on pisciculture and on other branches of 
natural science, to the columns of the Times and of other periodicals, and 
conducted for many years the ^'Sea and River Fisheries" and Practical 
JiTatural History " columns of Land and fVater.
He established at his 
own expense, the Museum of Economic Fish-culture" (under the 
Science and Art Department, South Kensington), at the Royal Horticul- 
tural Gardens.
This museum illustrates the cultivation of salmon, trout, 
and useful fresh-water fish, as weU as oysters and sea fish.
In 1866 he 
received a silver medal for his labours in the promotion of this branch of 
science from the " Exposition de Peche et d'Aquiculture " at Arcachon, 
in France, and in 1868 the Diploma of Honour from the Havre 
Exhibition.
He is the author of Curiosities of Natural History " (first, 
second, and third series) ; and of '^'Fish-hatching." He edited, in 1858, 
his father's Bridgewater Treatise on Geology and Mineralogy.
In 1859 
he discovered, in the vaults of St. Martin's, Charing Cross, the coffin of 
the great surgeon and phj'siologist, John Hunter, which was re-interred 
in Westminster Abbey by the Royal College of Surgeons.
For this he 
received the thanks of the Council of that body, and a bound copy of the 
Catalogue of the Hunterian Museum.
The Leeds School of Medicine 
also presented him with a silver medal.
In 1867 he was appointed 
Inspector of Salmon Fisheries for England and Wales, and in 1870 
Special Commissioner to inquire into the efi'ects of recent legislation on

His early death will be regretted by 
a large circle of his Natural History friends, to whom his genial good 
humour had endeared him.

Barnsley Naturalists' Society.
— Meeting Dec. 21st, Mr. T.
Lister 
in the chair.
— A few observations were made on birds, the most rare 
noted being the hoopoe, on Nov. 17th, obtained at Crofton ; only one 
had been previously recorded, brought some years ago from Womb well 
Wood.
The common buzzard was noted by Mr. Creighton on the same 
date, also on Dec. 12th.
On the 30th, a white, or barn, owl was caught 
on a low tree, asleep, near Stainborough Park, where these and other 
birds are protected ; a pair of magpies noted in Mr. T.
Ormerod's plant- 
ations, Brighouse, many others by Mr. A.
Drury, Tankersley Rectory, 
and by another observer about Wortley ; flocks and fieldfares, redwings 
and missel-thrush there, and about Cudworth.
Another young puffin 
taken near Wortley.
The bird-preserver who received both birds, 
believes it came inland with the one captured Nov. 2nd, and made its 
way down the Don a day or two after.
In Walton Park a flock of twelve 
wigeons, gold-crests, immense flocks of green linnets, starlings, &c., 
were noted.
The keeper observed a merlin and a rough-legged buzzard 
about the lake.

Bradford Naturalists' Society.
— The sixth annual meeting was 
held on 7th December, when the usual annual report was presented, 
which gave a resume of the society's proceedings during the year, and 
showed the society to be in a healthy and prosperous condition.
Numerous 
papers on Natural History have been read, and at alternate meetings 
special facilities have been given for the exhibition of specimens, when 
many plants and insects new to the district record list have been laid on 
the table.
After the reading of the report Mr. F.

— Mr. J.
L. Ellis read a paper on the coleoptera of the district, 
illustrated by his own collections.
The paper had special reference to 
the Geodephaga, and recorded about 150 species as natives of this 
locality, several locally new species having been discovered by Mr. Ellis 
himself.
Mr. Johnson also read some very interesting notes upon, and 
exhibited specimens of, C.
splendana.
Meeting, Monday, Dec. 20th, in Liverpool.
— A paper was read by Mr.
Keyworth, of Alderley Edge, Cheshire, on " Stainton and Newman 
compared," and the relative values of their works, more especially as text 
books discussed.
Mr. N.
Cooke, of Liscard, announced that a Eupithecia* 
which he had exhibited at a previous meeting, was one undoubtedly new 
to Britain.
It had been bred by Miss Greening, of Warrington, from 
larvae found this summer in the Isle of Man. Mr.
Cooke has provisionally 
named this species Eupithecia Blancheata ; it seems nearly allied to 
Lariceata, but may be distinguished from other species by a dorsal row of 
white dots on the abdomen.
The usual conversazione terminated the 
meeting.

A X X U A L ADDRESS,

AT YOEK, 15th JAX., 1881, 
By pEor. W.

[ABSTFACT.] 
Prof.
'Williamson commenced by stating, that lie had been under 
the impression that the address he was about to deliver was to be 
given before the members of the Yorkshire Union only, and he had 
so prepared it as to be adapted for scientific students, and not for a 
popular assembly.
He was therefore afraid that some of his audience 
might find it rather dry.
It had been mentioned that both himself 
and Dr. Sorby were Fellows of the Eoyal Society, but it was very 
possible that some of his hearers, before he had finished, might feel 
disposed to translate those letters, F.E.S., in a sense certainly not 
very flattering, viz., fellows remarkably stupid," as he had once or 
twice before heard them interpreted.
He wished to speak that evening on the differences between the 
older methods of studying botanical science, and those which now 
prevail among modern botanists.
Prior to the time of the immortal 
Linnasus, there existed — contrary to the popular opinion — a great 
variety of botanical literature.
From the time of Theophrastus 
(about 300 years b.c.) to that of Linn^us, there were hundreds of 
treatises written, the names of the authors of which are mostly 
forgotten.
Yet most gardeners are really familiar with their names, 
though they do not often know it, as they have been preserved in the 
names of many plants called after them, such as Lobelia, Calceolaria, 
Matthiola, and so forth.
These writers were, however, mostly 
interested in discovering and naming new species and genera.
The 
naming of known plants, and the discovering of new ones, occupied 
their whole time and writings.
Chemistry and other cognate sciences 
were then scarcely even in their infancy, and were very imperfect ; 
consequently the earlier botanists did not, and could not, enter into 
any physiological problems.
Only two names can be given as 
attempting anything in this direction ; these were Malpighi, an 
Italian, and Grew, our own countryman.
They laid the foundations 
of modern botany by directing their attention to the functions and 
morphology of plants.
After naming and discovering plants, many

The Natuealist.
of the earlier botanists proceeded to study the medical properties of 
plants.
This was very easily done.
Men knowing themselves to be 
afflicted by various diseases and accidents, naturally looked around 
them amongst the vegetable kingdom for remedies.
This is even yet 
the case amongst savage nations.
Another aspect of the subject to 
which attention was directed was the economical one — to what 
practical every-day use plants could be employed.
In regard to all 
these aspects the earliest botanists were guilty of the greatest 
mistakes, particularly with regard to the functions of plants.
They 
advanced speculations and theories innumerable, but altogether 
ignored facts ; and possibly not one in ten thousand of their theories 
is of the slightest use or value to us from a scientific point of view.
Linnaeus introduced many and great reforms into the study of 
botany ; but even before him two other men, had made a lew 
important advances.
Among the Egyptians there was some know- 
ledge of the sexes of plants, and they learned the way to produce 
perfect seed in certain plants by introducing the pollen of the male 
flower into the pistil of the female ; but it is not at all likely they knew 
anything of the theoretical reasons for their so doing.
Millington and 
another re-discovered something of the sexuality of plants, by finding 
that the functions of the pollen and the ovary were different.
Lobel 
also discovered that onion and grass, and some other seeds, when 
sowed, came up with only one seed-leaf, or cotyledon, while on the 
other hand the radish, the oak, and some other plants always 
produced two seed-leaves.
These and others were preparing the way 
for Linneeus.
He wrote that the characteristic of a botanist of those days was, 
that that man was the best botanist who knew the names of the 
greatest number of species.
Linnaeus first adopted and introduced 
what we now call the binomial system of nomenclature — by which 
system all plants which possess certain characteristics in common are 
united into one genus, under one name, and their specific distinctions 
are denoted by another name added to it.
(The Professor gave a 
number of instances illustrative of this method.) The re-discovery 
of the sexuality of plants was made use of by Linnajus as a 
means of classification.
The two Jussieus did great service to 
botanical science, and the younger of them introduced a new 
system of classification.
That of Linnaeus was an artificial 
one, as he himself well knew, and brought together many plants 
that are undoubtedly allied, and many others also which have 
no natural alliance whatever ; but he also left a sketch of a more 
Prof.
Williamson : Annual Address, Y.
N. U.
99 
natural system, which, however, was very imperfect.
Then came the 
younger Jussieu, who laid hold of Lobel's discovery, and on it based 
the two grand classes of flowering plants, the Dicotyledons and the 
Monocotyledons, or those having two and one seed-leaf respectively.
Desfontaine next discovered the connection between the dicotyledo- 
nous mode of germination and the exogenous method of stem growth.
(The Professor here enlarged considerably upon this connection, 
adducing Tarious examples.) The next great discovery was partly 
morphological and partly physiological, and was made by a man from 
whom we should scarcely have expected it a priori.
But (loethe had 
the spirit of a scientific philosopher, and he showed that the flower is 
morphologically a leaf-bud, and that every part of every flower is 
merely a modification of an ordinary leaf.
Gardeners know how easy 
it is in many cases to cause a plant to be so prolific in flowers that 
the ordinary foliage is almost hidden.
The reason of this is, that the 
ordinary buds are converted into flowers.
Another discovery was now made.
When a flower is young, its 
component parts are regular, all the whorls having frequently the 
same number of parts and being symmetrically arranged.
But De 
CandoUe showed that by the suppression of certain parts, the 
cohesion of parts, and the increased development of others, we have 
irregular flowers, like the pea and the snapdragon, developed from 
regular ones ; and Dr. Robert Brown deserves and receives the 
highest praise for his investigations into the development of the 
flowers of orchids, which was especially a brilliant achievement by a 
man the whole of whose work was well done.
The Professor then passed on to the consideration of the Crypto- 
gams, or so-called flowerless plants.
Linneeus found many plants in 
which he could discover no trace of a flower, such as ferns, mosses, 
&c., but he very wisely called them cryptogamic, and not agamic — 
flowers hidden, not flowers absent.
Up to 1840 men sought in vain 
for the reproductive organs of the cryptogams, simply because they 
looked in the wrong place.
To Nagel is due the honour of having 
first discovered it among ferns.
The first growth from a fern spore 
is a small dark-green cellular film, about the size of one's finger nail, 
which we call the prothallium, and this bears the organs which 
correspond to the stamens and pistils of flowering plants.
Nagel 
discovered the antheridia, or male organ, in 1844, and a Polish 
Count the archegonia, or female, in 1848.
Since then, a host of 
observers have made one discovery after another, until this depart- 
ment of botanical science has been brought into its present state.
100 
The Naturalist.
Mettenius soon discovered tlie sexual organs in Ijcopods, and in 1849 
Hofmeister did the same for the Rhizocarpas, and also in 1855 in the 
eqiiisetums.
To him also is due the discovery of the relation between 
the reproductive structures of the cryptogams and those of the higher 
flowering plants.
Thus he showed that the embryo sac of a phane- 
rogam was the analogue and representative of the prothallus of a fern.
At the present day the great majority of modern botanists are 
devoting themselves to the study of the laws of vegetable life, the 
mode of development, and the chemical processes that go on within 
the plant.
The collection of species is a valuable aid in another 
department — the geographical distribution of plants, hence Prof.
Williamson recommended the naturalist not to neglect the collecting 
and recording of species, and shewed how that all may, in one way or 
another, aid the grand work of obtaining a complete knowledge of 
plants.
The great question of the present hour is that of evolution : 
and in considering it for a few moments, he paid a very high and 
deserved compliment to the splendid researches and deductions of 
Mr. Darwin — which even those who do not agree with his conclusions 
must also endorse — for the grandeur of his work, which must mark 
an epoch in biological science.
ON THE ORGA.NISATION OF THE FOSSIL PLANTS 
OF THE COAL MEASUPvES.
By Thos.
Hick, B.A., B.
Sc.
Peof.
Wtlliams'on's tenth memoie on this subject has just been printed 
from the Transactions of the Poyal Society, and is well deserving of 
close study on the part of both botanists and palseontologists.
It is not 
wanting either in the interest or importance which have characterised 
the preceding memoirs, but is perhaps chiefly valuable for the complete 
settlement which it aff'ords of some questions which have hitherto 
been held in dispute.
In the first place, the Professor takes up the consideration of the 
remains of carboniferous plants met with in certain thin shales, 
imbedded in volcanic ash, which were discovered in 1865 at Laggan 
Bay, in Arran.
These remains were found in the position in which 
they originally grew, and consist for the most part of thin cylinders of 
vegetable tissue, which originally formed the outer bark of the stems 
of trees.
The interior of these cylinders " was in most cases filled with 
Hick : On the Fossil Plants of the Coal Measures.
101 
volcaDic ash^ but in a few instances by vegetable (debris introduced 
from without ; and in one specimen, imbedded in the vegetable mass, 
are several diploxyloid axes, of very old stems." By some authorities 
these axes have been regarded as young growths that sprang up within 
the cylinders of bark after the inner tissues of the stems had been 
destroyed ; but Prof.
Williamson is of opinion that this is an error, 
their magnitude and decorticated condition, as well as the nature of 
the materials with which they are intermixed, pointing rather to the 
conclusion that they have been introduced from without.
A question 
of primary importance was the botanical character of these stems, as 
indicated by the remains of their bark, and by the nature of the 
numerous fragments of twigs, branches and fruits in the overlying 
beds ; and the course of the investigations which Prof.
Williamson 
undertook was shaped with a view to its solution.
The results, which 
are here given with the most ample details, show unmistakably that 
the stems in question are all lepidodendroid in nature, and that they 
present none of the characters that should be met with had their 
affinities been rather with the Sigillar'nB.
It is true that the surface 
is marked longitudinally by a number of fissures which at first sight 
suggest a comparison with those of Sigillaricd, but on closer examina- 
tion they are found to be of mechanical rather than of organic origin, 
while, as we have said, the characteristic structure of Sigillarics is 
altogether absent.
On the other hand, the composition and arrange- 
ment of the tissues of the stems, so far as they are preserved : the 
structure of the leaves ; and the form and arrangement of the leaf- 
scars, are all of the lepidodendroid kind, so that there is both negative 
and positive evidence of the strongest kind in support of the con- 
clusion arrived at.
The general nature of the specimens being thus determined, the author 
proceeds to a detailed description of their structure as exhibited in 
thin sections prepared for microscopical examination.
The description 
is drawn up in excellent style, and is accompanied by well-executed 
illustrative figures, as in the previous memoirs.
Both the descriptions 
and the figures bear out the interpretations put upon the specimens in 
the previous paragraphs, and incidentally throw light on the somewhat 
vexed question, the affinities of the Sigillari/je.
As is well known to 
those who keep themselves an coitrant with these investigations, 
MM.' Brongniart and Renault, the eminent French pahTo-botanists, 
are of opinion that while the Lepidodendra are undoubtedly crypto- 
gams closely allied to existing Lycopods, the Sigillarice belong to 
higher order of vegetable life, and are to be ranked as exogenous 
102 
The Naturalist.
Gymnosperms.
Prof.
Williamsou is altogether opposed to this 
view, believing the Sigillaricd to be no less cryptogamic than the 
Lepidodendra, and we believe the next part of his " Memoirs " will be 
largely occupied with a demonstration of the truth of his conclusions 
based upon a careful comparison of a somewhat large series of 
specimens.
In the descriptions under notice, however, there is 
sufficient evidence to warrant a strong presumption that on this point 
Prof.
Williamson is in the right, inasmuch as they show that although 
the Arran plants are of lepidodendroid affinities, they yet possess the 
" cylindre ligneux," or, as Prof.
Williamson terms it, the " exogenous 
zone," which, in the opinion of the French savants, is characteristic of 
fossil gymnosperms.
The evidence derived from the fossil fruits met 
with in company with these stems, points likewise to their lepido- 
dendroid nature.
These are all true Lepidostrohi, though of probably 
distinct species, containing both macrospores and microspores, some 
of which, in one or two instances, are preserved.
The Arran plants disposed of, the author next adverts to the stem 
of Ulodendron, and certain spores and conceptacles described in his 
previous memoirs, on which additional light has been thrown by the 
examination of further specimens.
He also gives descriptions of two 
new fern stems, supplied by Messrs.
Binns and Spencer, of Halifax, 
of whose industry and patience in unearthing fossil plants and 
preparing them for microscopic investigation it is impossible to speak 
too highly.
In this connection he returns to the discussion on the 
nature of Traquarics, on which there has been considerable difference 
of opinion between him and some other naturalists.
Thus, Mr.
Carruthers, who early called attention to the objects so-called, came to 
the conclusion that they were animal in their nature, and were, in fact, 
carboniferous liadiolarians.
Prof.
Williamson, on the other hand, has 
for some years maintained their vegetable origin, and has lost no 
opportunity of becoming further acquainted with them, in the hope of 
obtaining decisive evidence of their character.
This he appears to 
have now done, and the elaborate descriptions here given of the more 
characteristic individual specimens will leave little doubt in the mind 
of the student that their supposed animal origin is disposed of for ever.
It may be added that he is supported in his opinion of their vegetable 
origin by Professors Haeckel and Strasburger, of Jena, the latter of 
whom, adopting Prof.
Williamson's diagnosis that they are crypto- 
gamic macrospores, suggests that their nearest allies will possibly be 
found in those of Azolla and other Ehizocarpous genera.
Passing from these objects, the author devotes a few paragraphs to 
Ellis : Coleoptera of Liveepdol and Neighbouehood.
103 
the bodies known as Zygosporites,.
and the reported, but as yet 
unconfirmed, presence of diatoms in coal; and concludes with an 
account of a group of peculiar structures whose nature has not yet 
been satisfactorily determined, but which are here described under the 
provisional name of Calcisphcera.

The 
census numbers shewing the distribution of each species through the 18 
Watsonian provinces of Great Britain are a further addition to the 
original catalogue.
These will be found very useful to the student of 
distribution, as although confessedly to a certain extent imperfect — as 
indeed at present they must be — they will at least indicate what are 
the desiderata for completing the census, and will also enable collectors 
to ascertain when they have discovered an unrecorded species.
The 
number of species given is exactly the same as in the first edition, but 
they are not altogether the same, as several additions have been made, 
which are, however, exactly balanced by the elision of doubtful or 
erroneous records.
These are indicated in a separate list at the end of 
the Catalogue.
Altogether, we must congratulate the Club on the neat 
manner in which the list has appeared, as well as upon the contents.
Copies printed on one side only can be obtained at a slightly advanced 
price.
We regret that the space at our disposal this month will not permit 
our entering upon the details of the alterations in the moss-list, but this 
is of httle importance, as every moss-collector must have a copy or two, 
and can thus see for liimself.

— Annual meeting, 4th January.
— 
The accounts prepared by Mr. W.

and meetings.
Several interesting species were recorded.
Mr. T.
Lister, in resigning the office of president, which he had held from the 
infancy of the society, gave a very brief glance at the work accomplished 
and the progress made, urging to continued efforts in promoting the 
success of the society.
He alluded to the excursions carried out last year 
by the Yorkshire Naturalist Union, one of which included the Dearne 
valley, Wentworth Castle, Canon Hall, &c, and strongly recommended 
that the excursions and meetings should receive the increased support of 
members and friends of societies.
The election of officers was then made 
as follows : — President, Mr. A.
Kell ; corresponding secretary, Mr. C.
Bellamy ; financial secretary, Mr. W.
Barraclough (the two last-named 
being re-elected).
A few occurrences of birds have been noted.
A late 
stay of the night-jar, or goatsucker, is confirmed about the end of 
October ; three specimens were observed, unfortunately shot, also several 
of those useful vermin-killers, the white and long-eared owls.
A white 
sparrow, a black bullfinch (just dead), and a pied blackbird were seen at 
Stainborough Jan. 34th ; a great spotted woodpecker recorded by Mr. E.
Hailstone at Walton, and widgeons still there.
Fieldfares, redwings, 
snow buntings, wood pigeons, bullfinches, carrion crows, kestrels, and a 
few sparrow hawks are recorded by many observers.
— T.

Bradford Naturalists' Society.
— Meeting Jan. 18th.
— The president 
(Mr. W.
West) delivered his opening address.
At the outset he spoke of 
the distribution of butterflies, after which he thoroughly described the 
nature of fungi, and referred to the animal nature of the myxomycetes.
In speaking of lichens he treated of their structure, and showed the 
similarity existing between the fruit of these plants and ascomycetous 
fungi.
He then stated that lichens were no longer considered as a separate 
class of plants by leading mycologists, but they were in reality ascomyce- 
tous fungi, parasitic on algse.
The address was illustrated by sketches 
on the blackboard, and by a number of interesting slides under the 
microscope.
HuDDERSFiELD Naturalists' SOCIETY.
—Meeting 15th Jan., Mr. J.
Yarley in the chair.
— Mr. S.
L. Mosley exhibited some fine specimens of 
exotic moths and butterflies, including Mania raphoeus, Madagascar : 
this is universally acknowledged as being the finest butterfly in the 
world : Atticus luna, North America ; A.
cynthea, China ; Banias 
chrysippus, European ; Grapta interrogationis, North America ; PapJiilio 
Hector, Asiatic ; Danias lemnacea, Asiatic Islands ; Delias lucharis, India ; 
Diadema boliva, India ; Papilio dimoleus, Africa.
The above will be 
seen to comprise some very rare specimens, and are a splendid assortment 
of insects.
In the course of some observations Mr. Mosley remarked 
that there was difficulty in ascertaining the fact whether some of the 
insects are butterflies or moths, and stated that this difficulty arises from 
our having no larvae of the exotic insects, only the perfect insect itself 
exhibited.
The chairman exhibited a pair of snow buntings, shot at 
Reforts of Societies.
109 
Dalton last week.
Mr. Mosley here pointed out the difference between 
the old and young bird, the mature being much whiter than this season's 
bird.
He also gave some very interesting facts as to the wearing of the 
feathers, in relation to the change it causes in the appearance and colour 
of the bird.
Mr. Yarley remarked that he had observed a great diminu- 
tion of the small birds in this locality, his opinion being that it was the 
result of the last two inclement winters.
0 VENDED Naturalists' Society.
— Monthly meeting, 15th January, 
Mr. James Spencer in the chair.
— An hour was pleasantly spent in 
examining some geological specimens which were shown by the president, 
viz.
, a sporangium containing Zygosporites hrevites.
These pretty spores, 
which are plentiful in our coal-balls, bear a striking resemblance to the 
fossil Xanthidia of the flint nodules which occur in the chalk rocks.
Prof.
Williamson, who has examined and named them, was doubtful 
whether they belonged to the Desmidise or were spores of some unknown 
form of lepidodendroid plant ; though, from the fact that no undoubted 
desmids have yet been discovered in the coal measures, he inclined to the 
latter opinion.
Mr. Spencer's new discovery helps to confirm the 
Professor's surmise, by jplacing Zygosporites among the lepidodendroid 
spores.
This is the first time, so far as Mr. Spencer is aware, that these 
pretty little spores have been found enclosed in a sporangium.
— Joseph 
Ogden, Sec.
Wakefield Naturalists' and Philosophical Society.
— Tenth annual 
meeting, Jan. 5th, the president, J.
Wainwright, Esq., F.L.S.,inthe 
chair.
— There were no exhibits.
A favourable report of the proceedings 
during the past year, with a balance-sheet, was read by the secretary, 
and passed.
Ballot papers were then given to each member, containing 
the names of a number of gentlemen, and the various officers were 
elected, including Mr. Joseph Wainwright, president (re-elected), and 
Mr. Edwd.
B. Wriggles worth, hon.
sec.
The president then read a paper 
on " The Peculiarities of Plant Life " (colour), in the course of which he 
endeavoured to point out how all the varied colours of flowers were 
supposed to have been caused, in illustration of which many known 
flowers were alluded to.

at 6-30 p.ia.-) the chair being taken by Prof.
W. C.
Williamson, F.P.S., 
of the Owen's College, Manchester.
The minutes of the previous annual 
meeting were taken as read.
The list of new subscribers, to whom thanks 
were voted, included Lord Herries, Lord-Lieutenant of the East Riding, 
Dr. A.
K. Polhtt, F.R.A.S., of Hull, the Rev. Joseph Foxley and Mr.
J. Proudcock, of Market Weighton ; Messrs.
W. Brook, T.
Bunker, and 
J. Harrison, of Goole ; John Harrison of Wilstrop, Wm. Atkinson of 
Leeds, Wm. Foggitt of Thirsk, J.
Ligleby of Eavestone, J.
H. Wilson of 
Harrogate, Wm. Hewett of York, and Edwd.
Hailstone, F.S.A., of 
W'alton Hall.
Thanks were voted for donations to the library, including 
various societies' publications sent in exchange.
The annual report and 
balance sheet were read by Mr. Geo.
Brook, ter., F.L.S., secretary, as 
follows : — 
"The Council, in presenting the 19th annual report, have to congratulate the 
members on the steady continuance of the progress which has marked the 
history of the Union since its re-organisation.
The reports of the varioas 
sections will show what progress has been made in the direction of the investi- 
gation of the Natural History of the county.
During the year six excursion 
meetings have been held as follows : — Eipon, March 29 ; Malton, May 16 ; 
Barnsley, June 12 ; Boston Spa, July 14 ; Marsden, Aug. 2 ; Market Weighton, 
Sept.
4. It had been intended to have in the autumn a special meeting for the 
collection and study of fungi, at which a number of the best British mycolo- 
gists would have been present and assisted the Union with their special know- 
ledge and experience, but reasons of a financial nature compelled its postponement 
to a future year.
A gratifying result of the second meeting — the one held at 
Malton — was the subsequent formation of a strong Naturahsts' Club in the town, 
the direct outcome of the impression produced by the visit of the Union.
The 
club— now associated with us — numbers sixty members.
When the year com- 
menced there were in the Union 26 societies.
None have withdrawn ; and on 
the other hand, two — the Malton Naturalists' Club, 60 members, to which 
reference has just been made ; and the Hull Field Naturalists' Society, 23 
members — have joined during the year.
These additions bring up the total 
number to 28, of which one is in the North Biding, two in the East, and the 
remainder in the West Biding.
The statistics which have been furnished to the 
Union by the secretaries of the different societies show that the individual 
membership is in the aggregate 1, 422 .
Adding to this figure the 250 subscribers, it 
will be seen that the Union now consists of 1,672, an increase of 169 upon the 
previous year.
The draft of the proposed map has been at a total standstill 
during the year.
Ths loss of Dr. Parsons has been here very keenly felt, and 
the map committee would be glad to meet with some competent geologist who 
would take up the mapping out of the lithology at the point where Dr. Parsons 
left it.
Mr. Filliter, of Leeds, to whom the Union is much indebted for having 
gratuitously traced the contour-hnes for the greater portion of the county, has 
also been compelled — by the exigencies of a large and increasing practice— to 
resign into the hands of the committee the work so far as he has been able to do 
Eeports of Societies.
Ill 
it.
It "will therefore be incumbent on tbe committee to make provision for the 
completion of this portion of the work.
The publication of the Union's Trans- 
actions having led to an exchange with societies of similar aims, the library has 
been increased by the addition of such publications as are issued by the societies 
in question.
Various presentations have also been made by members of the 
Union.
The secretaries will be prepared to lend books or pamphlets belonging 
to the Union to such societies or subscribers as may wish for the loan.
The 
number of subscribers has increased from 221 to 265.
At the last annual 
meeting a series of resolutions was passed, whereby a new class of 
members was created — that of honorary life members.
The regulations 
governing their selection provide that the total number shall be limited to 
twenty, and that no more than two be elected annually ; that their proposers 
shall be required to show a double qualification — first, acknowledged scientific 
attainments, and secondly, signal ser^-ices rendered to the Union ; and that such 
members shall have all the privileges and rights of ordinary members and 
subscribers.
It is also provided that every successful candidate shaU have a clear 
majority of three-fourths of the votes, first of the council, and then of an annual 
or specially convened general meeting.
Dr. Parsons, late of Goole, whose 
services and co-operation were of such inestimable "v alue to the Union, and the 
loss of whom is still keenly felt, was unanimously elected as the first of these 
members.
On the occasion of the twenty-fir^jt anniversary of the publication of 
the " Origin of Species," it was arranged to congratulate Mr. Darwin, the 
author, upon so interesting an event.
It was accordingly decided to prepare an 
address, and, when suitably engrossed, that a small deputation should present it 
to Mr. Darwin personally at his residence.
This was accordingly done on the 
3rd of November.
The cost of engrossing in book form, and of a number of 
reprints of it, was borne by voluntary subscription among the members.
Mr.
Thomas Lister was appointed to represent the Union at the Swansea meeting of 
the British Association, and when there, assisted at a conference of delegates of 
provincial scientific societies, when it was arranged that a more representative 
conference should be held in York next August, to consider in what manner best 
to promote the interests of the various societies represented.
The president and 
secretary of the Union are, by the rules of the British Association, entitled to 
sit on its general committee, either personally or by delegates.
The present year 
being that of the celebration of the jubilee of the Association, when it will again 
meet in the city of its nativity, your Council hope that members will do their 
best to secure the complete success of what is a memorable and ought to be a 
brilliant event in the history both of the Association and of the county of York.
In concluding their report, your Council congratulate the members on the good 
fortune which the Union had had in securing the services, as presidents, of 
Yorkshiremen who have made their mark in the field of scientific discovery." 
The report and balance-sheet having been adopted on the motion of ]\Ir.
Thos.
Hick, B.A., B.Sc, seconded by INIr. B.
Holgate, F.G.S., the 
excursion programme for 1881 was resolved upon, as follows : — Skipton, 
Easter Monday, April 18th ; Sheffield, for the Rivelin Valley, Saturday, 
May Mth ; Hornsea or Flamborough Head, Whit Monday, June 6th ; 
Thorne Waste, Saturday, July 9th ; E-ichmond, Bank Holiday, Monday, 
Aug. 1st ; and a fungus meeting at Leeds about the end of September or 
beginning of October ; the annual meeting to be held at Bradford on the 
112 
The Naturalist.
first Saturday in March, 1882.
It was also decided, on the recommenda- 
tion of the Council, that the circulars for the first five excursions be 
limited to a single page.
The officers for 1881 were then elected, Prof.
Williamson being again chosen as president, on the motion of Dr. H.
C. 
Sorby, F.R.S. Mr. W.
Denison Roebuck, Leeds, was re-elected as 
secretary, and, Mr. Brook retiring from office, Mr. W.
Eagle Clarke, 
M.B.O.U., Leeds, was elected to the second secretaryship.
The auditors 
(Messrs.
A. Crebbin of Bradford, and C.
W. Richardson of Wakefield) 
were re-elected.
A vote of thanks to Mr. Prest for acting as local 
secretary, and another to the various officers of the Union for their 
services during the year, were passed.
Seventeen societies were repre- 
sented at the meeting, and eleven entirely absent.
After an adjournment, 
the presidential address was delivered * in the large hall at seven o'clock, 
the chair being occupied by the Lord Mayor of York (Mr. J.
S .
Rowntree) 
who was accompanied on the platform by the City Sheriff (Mr. R.
Thompson), Dr. Sorby, Mr. Aid.
Terry, president of the York Society, 
and other gentlemen.
A vote of thanks to the president was proposed by 
Dr. Sorby, seconded by Mr. Thos.
Hick, B.A., B.Sc, and supported by 
the Sheriff, and carried ; also one to the Lord Mayor for presiding.
The 
company then proceeded to the enjoyment of a conversazione and 
microscopical soiree, which had been provided by the York and District 
Field Naturalists' Society, and which passed off very successfully.
The 
hall, had been fitted up with tables, on which were tastefully displayed 
the principal treasures of the above society, and also several valuable 
contributions from members of other societies in the Union.
Amongst 
the local contributions there was a large collection of British grasses, by 
Mr. Bewlay of York : a capital exhibition of lepidoptera and coleoptera, 
principally shown by Mr. Prest, the secretary, and by Mr. Jackson, 
York : a valuable assortment of British and foreign ferns and other 
plants, collected and mounted by Mr. J.
H. Carr, York.
Amongst other 
curiosities were also a collection of shells and petrifactions from Knares- 
borough, and a beautiful series of drawings by Dr. Sorby, of Sheffield, 
made during the cruise of his yacht the Glimpse, from May to October 
last year.
The drawings had special reference to meteorology, and to 
climatic and meteoric changes.
But valuable and interesting as these 
exhibits were, the microscopes formed the chief centre of interest.
Of 
these there was a grand display, some most valuable ones having been 
contributed for the occasion by Mr. Farmer (late Cook and Sons), Coney- 
street, and Mr. R.
Smith, High Ousegate.
Dr. Tempest Anderson, York, 
Messrs.
C. P.
Hobkirk, F.L.S., and G.
Brook, F.L.S., of Huddersfield, 
Thomas Hick, B.A., Harrogate, T.
Birks and J.
Harrison, Goole, 
Washington Teasdale, Leeds, and other gentlemen connected with the 
Union, also contributed to this department of the soiree.
The chief of 
the objects shown by the microscopes had special reference to botany, 
and were designed to illustrate the presidential address.

MOTHING AT CHATTENDEN.
By G.
T. Porritt, F.L.S.
Chattenden is the estate of Lord Earnley, and is situate in North 
Kent, at about equal distance from Higham and Strood.
Ever since 
my first visit there in July, 1874, it has been one of my favourite 
localities, and consequently I have repeatedly returned to it since.
It 
is of easy access from London, trains running frequently from Cannon- 
street, London Bridge, or Charing Cross Stations, and a ride of an 
hour or a little over brings you to Higham.
To collect at Chattenden, 
however, it is first necessary to obtain permission from Earl Darnley ; 
but a courteous letter to his lordship's steward at Thong, Gravesend, 
never fails to bring a printed form bearing the requisite authority.
Without such authority one may as well stay at home, as old Pank- 
hurst, the keeper, is " down " on every person almost as soon as he 
enters the woods, and he is a clever persuader who can get over him.
But be armed with the necessary " pass," and he is the most obliging 
of keepers, and will find you a hop-pole on which to fasten your net 
to catch Iris at any time.
Either Strood or Higham will do to stay 
at.
At Strood much better accommodation is to be had, but Higham 
is preferable in other respects, there being excellent collecting all the 
way from the village to Chattenden.
And those who are not afraid 
to rough it, will find fair quarters at the Pailway Inn, near the 
station, or at the Chequer Inn, a little further on in the village.
My 
first visit there will never be forgotten.
A friend had preceded me, 
and, had written me that he was taking Nola albulalis, at that time one 
of our greatest rarities, and almost exclusively in the hands of a dealer 
at Dartford, who had contrived to keep the knowledge of the locality 
well to himself.
The morning of the 1 3th of J uly saw me on my way 
to Strood, where I joined my friend just before dusk.
Fatigued with 
the long journey, we did not go up to Chattenden that evening, but 
instead walked to the marshy river side close by, where we took the 
PoREITT : MOTHIXG AT ChATTENDEN.
117 
lovely Acidalia emutaria rather commonly, amongst a number of other 
species.
The next four evenings were devoted to Kola albidalis, with 
what success will be judged when I say that in that time we secured 
nearly three hundred specimens, fully half of them falling to my net.
It occurred in two adjoining ash plantations, right in the Chattenden 
woods, and in no other spot could a trace of it be found.
A few could 
always be beaten out in the daytime, but it was just at dusk when 
they began to fly, and then for half an hour the collector who 
could most quickly box his specimens got most, as one had only to 
stand still and net them as they rose in profusion from the grass and 
low undergrowth, flying slowly and conspicuously only about a foot 
from the ground.
As it became darker they got wilder and flew 
much higher, and were then proportionately more difiicult to take.
Since that time albulalis has found its way into all our collections, 
although to this day the ash plantations at Chattenden remain its 
only known British habitat.
The following May we went down again 
for a day, in order to try and find the larva, but entirely without 
success, though how we missed it seems now inexplicable, as a year 
later Messrs.
W. H.
Tugwell and J.
P. Barrett found it in numbers 
feeding on the common dewberry (Rnbus ccBsins) ; and from a supply 
Mr. Barrett then kindly sent me, I had the pleasure of giving a full 
description in this journal {Naturalist n., 17.) Since then I have 
found it myself easily enough.
Although on that journey we missed the larva of albulalis, we found 
that of another species which pleased us almost as much.
In the 
previous year we had frequently netted about the rose-bushes one of 
our most beautiful and rarest of plumes, Pteropliorus rJiododactylus, 
and our search for its larva was as successful as the other was the 
reverse.
For a rosebud on almost the first rosebush my friend 
examined produced the prize, and we were soon able to collect as 
many as we wanted.
They were feeding beneath the leaf which wraps 
round the rosebud, eating into the bud from the side ; others were 
beneath similar leaves around the young succulent shoots, into which 
they ate, and were detected at once by the frass at the top of the bud 
or shoot.
On some bushes they were in plenty, so we readily collected 
about 130, and might easily have got as many more.
Another species common at Chattenden, and one which everyone 
who begins the lepidoptera is ambitious to take, is the purple emperor 
butterfly, Apatiira Iris.
The larvce of this species feed on the 
numerous sallows growing in the lower part of the woods, but, as is 
118 
The Naturalist.
well known, the imago generally seeks tlie highest point of ground in 
its district ; and hence it is easily taken in numbers in this particular 
locality.
For through the highest part of the collecting ground is 
fortunately a sufficiently wide drive with most suitable oak trees 
growing along each side, and there the Chattenden Iris congregate.
Armed with nets fixed at the end of long poles, we used to wait for 
them in the drive ; and most exciting it is, and to a lepidopterist one 
of his gTeatest treats to see one of these grand butterflies come skim- 
ming and gliding over the oaks, and then settle with its brilliant wings, 
the purple glistening in the sun, as is usually the case, at the end of 
one of the outermost side twigs of an oak.
It then requires a cool 
head to secure the prize, as using a net at the end of a twelve- 
feet pole is altogether a different thing from using our ordinary 
pocket nets.
After one or two failures, however, the thing is done, 
and afterwards there is but little trouble, as Iris is by no means so 
difficult to net as is generally supposed.
I have known one collector 
secure towards 40 during four or five following days at Chattenden.
But to give such detailed accounts of all the interesting species that 
occur in this locality would take up a great many more pages of the 
Naturalist than can be spared, so we must refer to a few of them but 
briefly.
I have not visited the locality before the middle of May, nor 
later than the last week in July, consequently all the species alluded 
to in this article occur in one stage or another during the two months 
between those dates.
Besides Iris the butterflies include Antliocharis 
cardamines ; MelitcBa Athalin^ about the ash plantations ; Vanessa urtica, 
polycliloros, and Atalanta all common ; the beautiful Arge GalatJiea in 
abundance in the open corners of the woods ; Satyrus Mgeria^ Janira, 
Tithomis^ and HyperantJms all abundant, with Megcera less commonly ; 
CJiortobiiis Pamphilus ; 'iJiecla quercv,s and W -alburn^ both plentiful, the 
former about the oaks, the latter about the elms ; Polyommatus Phloeas^ 
Lycoena Alexis^ SyrichtJms Alveolus, Thanaos Tages; and Hesperia Sylvanus 
and linea, both " skipping" about the rides in plenty.
The Nocturni are 
also well represented.
Stsia myopaformis abundant in the apple 
orchards at Strood ; Zeuzera oesculi, Zygmia lonicerce and filipendaloe ; 
Nola cucullatella and albulalis , the beautiful Colligenia miniata ; 
Lithosia mesomella, rather common; EucJielia Jacobeot; Euthemonia 
russula ; Liparis clirysorrhoea and auripm both common, the former on 
the hedges between Higham and Chattenden ; Orgyia pudibunda and 
antiqua ; Trichiura cratcegi, larvte on the whitethorn hedges between 
Higham and Chattenden ; Bombyx neustria in profusion ; rubi and 
querciis ; and Lasiocampa quercifolia.
POctEITT: MOTHIXG AT ChATTENDEN.

As miglit be expected with so great variety of trees and underwood, 
the Geometree are in great force, and beating for them in the broad 
rides is easy and profitable work.
One of the most interesting species 
is the very local pretty little Acidalia riisticata.
It does not occur in 
the woods, but is in profusion on two short adjoining elm hedges at 
Higham, close to the village, and indeed the first hedges on the way 
from there to Chattenden.
The moths are found sitting on the upper 
sides of the elm leaves, but near the ground, and are so numerous 
that five or six dozens may easily be collected in an hour or two any 
fine day during the middle of July.
I have hitherto tried in vain to 
find its larva, and no one seems to know on what it feeds there, though 
probably it is one or other of the low plants growing beneath the elm 
bushes, or possibly on the ivy growing about the lower elm stems.
In 
confinement they are readily reared on knot grass, as are indeed almost 
all the species of Acidalioe.
In the woods the fine Angerona pruuaria 
flies very freely, and the dark broad-banded variety seems almost as 
common as the type.
Scotosia veUlata is not uncommon ; as are also 
very fine Cldaria picata ; and Todis vernaria flies about Clematis vUalba.
In May the delicate Corycia taminata is abundant, and a week or two 
later is followed by its brother temerata — both of course about the 
wild cherry trees.
Other species of more or less interest are Onrop- 
ieryx sambucata, Venila maculata, Earymene dolahra?'ia, Selenia illustraria, 
Himera pennaria (larvae plentiful in May), Pseudopterpna cytisaria, 
lodis lactearia, HemitJiea thymiaria common, Ephyra omicronaria 
common about maple, E.
punctaria, Asthena luteata and candidata, 
Acidalia scutulata, bisetaia, interjectaria, incanaria, subsericeata, immutata, 
remutata^ emutaria (before alluded to), and emarginata ; Timandra 
<iinataria ; Strenia clatlirata, very common j Scoria dealhata ; Anisop- 
ieryx cescularia, larvee in May ; various EupithecicB ; M.elanthia rubigi- 
nata, very common; ocellata and albicillata Auticlea derivatUy 
Coremia ferrugata, Cidaria corylata, pyraliata, and very fine Juhata ; 
Eubolia mensuraria, bipunctaria, and pahmbaria.
No doubt the Pseudo-Bombyces are fairly represented if worked for, 
though I have only myself taken Notodonta camelina.
The Xoctuse 
are numerous, and include some nice species.
Perhaps the most 
interesting to me was Toxocampa pastinum, which occurs at sugar and 
at flowers of Galium in July; but is best collected in the larva 
state in May. It is then just about full-grown, and may be found 
freely in the ash plantations at night wuth a lamp.
The very 
beautiful larvse are most conspicuous, and are usually seen feeding on 
the top of the fragile Vicia plants ; or they may be found quite as 
120 
The Na^turalist.
easily in the daytime, as the plants which their feeding has bared of 
leaves — frequently the central stalk being about all that is left — are 
readily seen : and then, by following the stem down to the ground, 
a fine fat larva, sometimes two or more, will usually be found coiled 
up in the moss on the ground.
The pale southern form of Epunda 
viminalis, too, is very plentiful at sugar in July, and quite swarms 
in the larva state in May. The sallow bushes are full of them, and 
a fair-sized tin box may often be filled with larvee from one low bush.
With them will generally be found a fair sprinkling of those of 
Orthosia lota, with here and there a few of one or two species of the 
Xanthias.
Other larvas include Taniocampa crnda in plenty, and miniosa 
less commonly; and in the evening big fat Tryphoenajimhria are plentiful 
enough, along with several of the common LeucanldcB and NoctuidcB.
Of imagos at sugar may be mentioned Thyatira derasa and hatis ; 
Oymatophora duplaris, common ; Acronycta psi, ligustri, and rumicis ; 
Xylophasia lithoxylea and hepatica, common ; Carad.rina Morpheus, not 
uncommon ; Agrotis ravida ; 2'ryphoena fimbria, abundant ; Gonoptera 
lihatrix, and many others.
The pretty Erastria fuscula flies freely in 
some of the broad rides ; and last May I took a late specimen of 
Toeniocampa gracilis.
Amongst the Deltoides, Herminia oarhalis and Rivula seiicealis are 
both very common ; whilst the Py rales are represented by Ebulea 
crocealis in abundance amongst fleabane ; a few Botys cinctalis ; with 
Pyrausta purpuralis, Botys verticalis, Juscalis, and iirticalis ; Scopula 
clival?^ and prunalis ; Scoparia cembroe and mercuralis in more or less 
abundance.
Of Crambites occur Crambiis pascuellus, pinetellus, and Warrington- 
ellus ; Phycis rohorella ; the neat Bhodophcea consociella, rather 
commonly in some of the higher parts of the ground ; whilst R.
tumidella is apparently abundant about the oaks all over the 
woods.
A Tinea which pleased me much was the very pretty Coleophora 
vihicella : its larva feeds on the Genista tinctoria, and they seemed to 
abound everywhere where that plant grew.
The cases are very notice- 
able, being just like large black seed vessels, and the plants were 
perfectly studded with them.
On the 26th June, 1878, I collected 
great numbers of them containing both larvee and pupae, from which 
I reared a large number of beautiful imagos ; as well as a minute 
hymenopterous parasite which I am told is perfectly new and un- 
described.
POREITT : MOTHING AT ChATTENDEN.
121 
I did not pay much attention to tlie Pterophori, except to the rose 
feeding rhododactylus, but Uthodactylus is very plentiful amongst 
Inula dysenterica ; and the snow-white pentadactylus is, as might be 
expected equally abundant and generally distributed.
This paper thus far has treated only of such species as occur at 
Chattenden, and its immediate vicinity.
Those, however, who go 
there for two or three weeks, and like to vary the collecting as much 
as possible, have ample scope for so doing ; as short excursions for 
an afternoon's or evening's work may very easily be made from either 
Strood or Higham.
By sugaring in the Thames marshes several 
good species are taken, such as Leucania pudorina and straminea, 
Senta uhce, very dark Agrotis c/irsoria • pupae of Nonagria geminipuncta 
in the reed stems, and many other species.
Off Gravesend, too, larvge 
of the very local Bomhyx caslreusis occur, and indeed a little earlier in 
the spring are collected there in the greatest profusion.
A. few hours 
on the Downs will furnish a good series of Lyccena Corydon ; with the 
gay llythyia carntlla, Botys hyalinalis, &c.
In fact pleasant and 
profitable outings may be made all around the district.
The country around Chattenden is all a lover of nature can 
require, and is in fact a perfect example of " the sunny south." 
The immense hop fields, the cherry orchards, the old chalk pits about 
Hisiham overgrown with luxnrient vegetation, or, as is sometimes the 
case, made into a prolific garden or orchard, with the owner s cottage 
built in the midst are things which we dwellers in northern smoky 
towns know little of.
The picturesque railway station at Higham, 
enlivened all round'with its numerous nightingales and other feathered 
songsters, I have already written of in this Journal {Nat. vol.
v..
p. 1()8).
My Sunday morning's walk last May from Higham up to the beautiful 
little church on Gad's Hill, about a mile away, and where lived our 
great novelist Charles Dickens : and the evening at Rochester 
Cathedral (Rochester being only separated from Strood by the river's 
bridge), will not be soon forgotten.
Nor will another morning's 
walk, before breakfast, over the grounds of the old Rochester Castle.
But why need I write longer 1 Surely I have said enough to commend 
the spot to everyone who has the leisure and opportunity of visiting it.

of the variety 7mridio7ialis (Boisd.) of Polia flavocincta, recently sent to 
me by Mr. W.
F. Kirby for the purpose, I find that the form of the 
insect taken in this district (and I should think in other parts of the West 
Hiding) is that variety.
I do not think the paler real type of the species 
occurs here at all, but meridionalis is abundant enough ; whilst South of 
England specimens seem to be all of the paler ordinary type.
Meridio- 
nalis is known in Corsica, but I believe has not previously been recorded 
as occurring in Britain.
Guenee describes Polia Jiavocincta var.
meridio- 
nalis from Corsica as follows :— " The black atoms are so numerous as to 
make the ground colour dark ashy in male, and grey-black in female.
The orange colour is also more intense, and the patches of orange on the 
subt.
1. are surrounded on both sides by ill-defined blackish marks, which 
lose the sagittate form.
Hind wing considerably darker, distinctly 
bordered with black : the lunule in the cell is well marked, and nearly 
touches the median line above ; while below, where it is still more sharply 
defined, it is as far from it as in the type." — Geo. T.
Porritt, Highroyd 
House, Huddersfield, Feb. 9th.
A Correction.
— In the account of the meeting of the Bradford 
Naturalists' Society, last month, the report is hardly worded to express 
what I said.
I referred to the " supposed animal nature of the Myxo- 
mycetes," by Messrs.
S. Kent, F.
B. White and others ; I did not say 
that I held them to be of an animal nature.
Then again : with regard to 
the lichens I said that most of the leading botanists — not mycologists — 
classed them as fungi, neither did I subscribe to this opinion.
The fact 
is, that physiological and morphological botanists mostly swell the ranks 
of those who hold the Schwendenerian doctrine, whilst practical botanists 
(followers of Linne), who know most about species, still assert that the 
lichens are a distinct class of plants.

REVIEW.—" A List of British Birds," and " The Graduated List," 
H. W.
Marsden, Regent-street, Gloucester : 6d.
— Mr. Marsden has 
compiled two more of his useful lists, under the above titles — this time for 
the benefit of ornithologists and oologists.
The first-named, indeed, 
comprises both lists, the ''Graduated" being added as an appendix.
Separately, the "Graduated List" is gummed for labelling eggs, and 
consequently printed on one side only.
There are several advantages 
over other lists we have seen ; for instance, the different sections of 
British birds are clearly and accurately indicated ; the occasional visitors 
of the European faunas ; the accidental visitors of exotic faunas ; the 
African, American, Asiatic, and Australian visitors — are not only all 
added, but the natural habitat of each species clearly shewn.
Altogether 
we consider the lists the most perfect we have seen, and, as such, 
thoroughly recommend them to our readers.

Lancashire and Cheshire Entomological Society.
— First meeting 
of the present session, Jan, 31st, the president, Mr. S.
J. Capper, in the 
chair.
— The society elected the following officers for the current year ; — 
president, Mr. S.
J. Capper (re-elected) ; vice-president, Mr. Nicholas 
Cooke ; secretary.
Dr. J.
V/.
Ellis.
After a vote of thanks to the 
retiring officers, Mr. Capper, in the course of a few remarks, stated his 
appreciation of the confidence expressed by the members of the society 
in again electing him president.
He said that at the formation of the 
society, four years ago, he expressed a wish that some member more 
thoroughly acquainted with entomology in all its branches would be 
elected to the office of president, and he still hoped that before long such 
a person would be found among the younger members of the society.
He 
congratulated the society on its success, it having commenced four years 
ago with about half-a-dozen members, and now having about 50.
He 
was much pleased at the general good tone of the papers read before the 
society during the past year, some of which have been printed for 
distribution among the members.
A short communication was read from 
Mr. Dukinfield Jones, and the subject of devoting the balance in the 
hands of the secretary to the formation of an entomological library for 
the use of the members was considered, and postponed until the next 
meeting.

Dr. Hartlaub, of Bremen, are E'iipleHes capensis, Hinmdo piiella, Mela- 
nopepla atromhens {Bradyoxoris ater), and Nectarina Jardinei.
Towards 
the close of the meeting there was a short discussion on micro- 
photography.
412th Meeting, Feb. 8th, the president in the chair.
— Mr. W.
Atkin- 
son exhibited a box of insects from India, containing specimens of 
beetles, lantern-flies {Fulgora candelarin), grasshoppers, &c.; and also 
various British lepidoptera, amongst which was the Camberwell beauty, 
Vanessa Antiopa.
Mr. Walter Raine showed a beautiful series of eggs of

; Mr. W.
Denison Roebuck, a photograph of a white variety of the common mole, 
taken alive at Stillingfleet, near York, in March, 1879.
Other examples 
of the same variety occurred there in December, 1879, and March, 1880.
All the specimens fell into the possession of Mr. George Edson, of 
Malton.
White varieties of the mole are not uncommon, but the chief 
point of interest was the persistence of the forms in the same locality.
The president brought a collection of Desmidiacece from North Wales, 
Eepoets of Societies.
127 
comprising MicraHerias angnlosa, Staur'astrum anatmum, T.

Mr. Washington 
Teasdale, F.R.M.S., showed a section of a cryptogamic plant (probably 
Asteromyolon) which was discovered about sixteen years ago, by an 
eminent, though humble, naturalist named Adam Mathison, of Jedburgh, 
Scotland ; Mr. C.
R. Nf wton, a series of slides illustrative of the adult- 
eration of flour with rice, peas, oats, barley, maize, &c.
Amongst other 
microscopical objects Mr. F.
Emsley showed parasites of the corncrake, 
a stained section of ivy, and earth mites.
There were also exhibited 
several lichens, collected on a piece of wet moorland near Harrogate, by 
Mr. James Grainge.
— H.
Pollard, Sec.
Manchester Cryptogamic Society.
— At the January meeting of 
this society.
Dr. Carrington, the president, brought before the notice 
of the members a series of Hepaticse which he had collected at Killarney 
in the year 1861.
He called especial attention to some specimens of 
Radnla aqnilegia, which he had described in his " Gleanings amongst 
Irish Cryptogams," published soon afterwards.
One of the specimens 
was named Eadula aquilegia, var.
majors but since that time Dr. Moore 
and Mr. G.
E. Hunt had found it with male plants, and Prof.
Lindberg 
had also, during a visit to Ireland, been fortunate enough to discover 
the fertile plant.
Dr. Carrington having recently received specimens, 
strangely enough, through the executors of the late Mr. T.
C. Austin of 
America, he now no longer hesitates to rank it as a distinct species, and 
names it in honour of his late friend Dr. Moore of Dublin, as Radula 
Moorei.
Dr. Carrington said that at the time he collected it he was 
strongly inclined to recognise it as a species, but in the absence of 
fructification, and in deference to the opinions of Dr. Gottsche and Prof.
Lindberg, he had then described it as a variety only.
Meeting, 21st February, Dr. Carrington, F.R.S.E., in the chair.
— 
After the minutes of the previous meeting had been confirmed, Dr. Car- 
rington wished to correct an error in the description of Radula Moorei^ 
so far as the reference to the fertile specimens of Prof.
Lindberg had 
been made.
Mr. W.
H. Pearson exhibited specimens and drawings of 
Radula commutata, of Gottsche's M.SS., a species new to Britain.
Specimens of this species had been collected some time ago, by A.
Croal, 
but the particular specimen then exhibited had been collected last J uly, 
on the Breadalbane mountains, by G.
A. Holt, these, however, had not 
been recognised as Radula comm.utata until a recent examination made 
by himself.
Specimens of Lepidozia reptans were referred to in Carring- 
tcm's and Pearson's E<pitic(B Britannicm Exsiccatce (which lay on the 
table).
Dr. Carrington pointing out that the particular specimen from 
Tyn-y-Croes had been examined by Dr. Spruce, and found to be quite 
distinct, he having had specimens sent to him by Mr. Pearson for that 
purpose, and which he now named as Lepidozia Pearsoni.
The examina- 
128

tion of a portion of Austin's collection of American mosses, -which, had 
been brought by Capt.
P. G.
CunlifFe, occupied the rest of the evening.
It was suggested that a further examination of these American mosses 
should be made on a future occasion.
— Thos.
Rogers, Hon. Sec.
Wakefield Naturalists' and Philosophical Society.
— Meeting 19th 
Jan., Dr. Crowther, v.
p., in the chair.
— The proceedings of the evening 
were of a varied and interesting description.
Mr. J.
Spencer, of Halifax, 
delivered a lecture on " The Fossil Plants of the Coal Measures," 
illustrated by some very beautiful diagrams of sections, fossil remains, &c.
taken from specimens in Mr. Spencer's pcssession.
The subject was 
thoroughly and clearly explained, and the various fossils common in the 
coal strata ol this district were fully and graphically described.
A micro- 
scopical soiree of a very instructive character, in which Dr. Crowther, 
Mr. Spurling, and Mr. C.
W. Richardson took part, terminated the 
proceedings.
Meeting, Feb. 2nd, Dr. Crowther in the chair.
— A most interesting 
paper was read by Mr. Thos.
Lister, of Barnsley, entitled " Walton Hall 
— past and present." The lecturer commenced hio address by compli- 
menting the members of the society on their excellent display of 
microscopes, &c., and also on having secured such a capital room for 
their meetings ; he tl^ en briefly alluded to the wonderful effects produced 
by the snow and frost during the recent severe weather, and spoke of the 
Creator and His wondrous works, as seen in the largest as well as the 
smallest objects ; and he condemned in the strongest language the mania 
on the part of many persons to kill everything which comes under their 
notice in the fields and woods, and then style themselves " naturalists." 
He then traced the history of the Waterton family, and gave some 
interesting particulars with regard to Walton Hall, the home of Squire 
Waterton, the naturalist — to some of whose extraordinary adventures he 
alluded, and described the valuable collection of lace, books, &c., 
possessed by the present tenant, Mr. Hailstone.
The microscopical 
section then exhibited several beautiful and interesting objects.

THE YORKSHIRE NATURALISTS' UNION, ITS ORIGIN, 
CONSTITUTION, AND MODES OF WORKING, 
WITH REMAEKS UPON THE STUDY OF NATURAL HISTORY.
By H.
Bendelack HEWETSO]sr, M.R.C.S., Leeds.
Theoughout every historically recorded era in the progressive develop- 
ment of nations, there has always been, at one time or another, some 
special mark of the intellectual standing of the period.
For instance, 
one nation would be notable for its arms, another for its arts or its 
philosophy, and so on ; but it would seem that it has remained for 
the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries of the Christian era to be 
peculiar among all other times for the universal study of natural 
history and natural science.
The application of the knowledge so 
gained has resulted in being the chief motive power of the nation.
Another effect is the formation of a school of Natural History painting, 
which by far transcends any previous efforts at recording in faithful 
imagery organic and inorganic forms.
From what other age could 
we obtain botanical illustrations approaching those produced by Curtis 
or Sowerby, or the illustrations of shells in Reeves' ConcJiologia Iconica % 
What other period has produced an ornithological woodcutter equal 
to Bewick, or the last perfection of bird painting reached by Mr.
and Mrs. John Gould, who have by elaborate labour succeeded in 
transcribing the iris of the humming bird or the dazzling beauty of 
the king bird of Paradise ?
Again, the magnificent bird-painting by 
Keulmanns in his illustrations of that monumental work — just about 
completed — Dresser's Birds of Europe.
The painting of exotic butter- 
flies and the eggs of British birds by the late W.
C. Hewitson are 
simply beyond all praise, as are also the colored drawings of Agates, 
by the greatest of art critics, and a deep student of nature — John 
Buskin.
What other age in the history of the world has produced such a 
wonderful series of naturalists as Baron Cuvier, Linn^us, Darwin, 
Owen, or Huxley, besides many more of vast intellectual power, 
although not gifted with that inborn grant — original thought 1 
The wave of investigation into the hitherto hidden regions of 
natural history and natural law, has been swelling vaster and vaster 
of late years.
Hardly a town of any importance exists without its 
natural history society, or its field club.
Natural history is also 
taught in schools as a matter of daily routine, and even young ladies 
are scarcely looked upon as "finished," unless they have attended 
and obtained certificates in Physiology, upon a course of lectures by 
N, S., Vol. VI.— Apk., 1881.
130 
The Naturalist.
some itinerant professor, and can satisfy the examiners tliat they 
do possess sufficient knowledge for their peculiar station in life, as to 
their innermost pulsations and ultimate neuro-ramifications.
It is not 
however, the object of this paper to follow either in cause or effect the 
results of such broad-cast natural history, but rather to show the 
origin and modes of working of field naturalists in societies, and the 
advantages derived from a general union of such societies, which shall 
at various meetings in their county, at specially selected spots discuss 
and place on record the observations of the different sections from 
time to time.
In the early part of this century the formation of philosophical and 
literary societies did good work in arousing attention to the study of 
natural science and by collecting in their precincts museums, at the 
same time providing lectures for the instruction of general audiences, 
•who required that the subject should of necessity be lowered %o the 
level of their existing state of ignorance.
It was therefore in the 
hands of a few only to investigate and teach.
There were many, how- 
ever, who, pent up day by day in the dingy offices and the dull shops 
of our large towns, longed for a more intimate knowledge and deeper 
personal acquaintance with nature as it worked in its reality.
Their 
appetite for such was, however, not appeased — though probably 
considerably whetted — by the demonstrations of the periodic lecturer.
To supply this want, Natural History societies were started by those 
who felt the want the most, and whom, I fear, have rather been 
despised than assisted by their " Philosophical brethren " in their 
more stately habiliments.
The might of right, however, always 
flourishes by opposition, and many a working man and cottager meet 
agreeably on equal footing the professional man, or retired gentleman 
for a pleasant evening's chat, interesting and instructive alike to 
each — especially the latter.
In Yorkshire many such societies have 
had their origin, and have bravely struggled on amidst damping clouds 
of quiet contempt, kept together mainly by that guiding star, 
enthusiasm, thirsting after hidden knowledge and concealed revelation.
The first attempt to amalgamate and give a common object to the 
working of Naturalists' Field Clubs in Yorkshire was brought about 
under the title of the " West Riding Consolidated Naturalists' 
Society," whose object it was to investigate the fauna and flora of 
the West Riding, and meet for discussion.
Unfortunately, however, 
the utility of their work is entirely lost, there being no medium in 
which their observations could be recorded and preserved.
About the ' 
year 1876 — stimulated by that energy which is the happy instigator 
Hewetson : Origin, &c,, of Y.
N. U.
131 
of but a few men earnest in their attachment to Nature — the West 
Eiding Consolidated Naturalists' Society received new blood, a fresh 
impetus which led to the formation of a council of management, and 
the extension of the Society's title to that of the " Yorkshire 
Naturalists' Union," which had for its objects the investigation of 
the Natural History of the whole of Yorkshire.
At the same time it 
was resolved that the transactions of the Union should be preserved 
in a suitable manner, so that the records in ornithology, entomology, 
botany, conchology, &c., should each have their apportioned pages in 
the transactions, and retain their individual sequence.
I will refer, for 
example, to a most important work, at present in progress, by 
Mr. W.
Eagle Clarke, which is intended to record, in their natural 
order, all obtainable information relating to the occurrence and habits 
of Yorkshire birds.
Messrs.
Nelson & Taylor, of this town, are 
producing a like work in conchology.
Mr. Porritt intends to carry out 
a similar work on lepidoptera.
I must ask pardon for passing over 
these sections without a remark, being obliged to confess that I am 
not cultivated enough in their especial lines to make any criticism of 
mine of value.
Reports of the sections into which the Union is divided 
are prepared upon this principle — that when complete they can be 
bound in separate volumes, which will enable a future reader to obtain 
whatever information he may be in search of more readily.
The 
Union was finally remodelled in 1877, and the working is continued 
as successfully as it was then commenced.
The ultimate success of the Yorkshire Society, and its smooth 
transition from the ovum to the imago, I am reminded was in a large 
measure due to the geniality and untiring zeal rendering popular the 
Rev. William Fowler, M.
A., who held the presidential helm, and guided 
safely and surely the reunion to its ultimate completion.
Dr. Clifton 
Sorby, F.R.S., next filled the presidential chair, followed by Professor 
Williamson, F.R.S. It needs no words of mine to show the enormous 
advantage derived by the Union from its possessing on its council such 
marked examples of truly scientific and eminently original men.
It is the custom for the Yorkshire Naturalists' Union to meet about six 
times a year.
Previous to the meeting the locality is fixed upon, and 
a general sketch, sent in prospectus, pointing out the chief natural 
features of interest to each section.
A map of Yorkshire is being 
prepared, which will greatly assist in this respect, and enable the 
various sections to set to work, at once, upon their arrival at the place 
of meeting.
The day over (and a meal disposed of with a relish, to 
which the fresh air and an enthusiasm known only to naturalists greatly 
132 
The Naturalist.
contributes), the president of each section sets before the general 
meeting the chief features of the day's work, selecting such as may be 
considered most interesting or important.
The next question which 
suggests itself to my mind is, what is the outcome of the study of 
Natural History as regards its effect upon ourselves and its results 
upon the indigenous plants and animals of our country 1 If carried on 
in the proper spirit of honest research, as a true naturalist, not as a 
mere collector, the result is undoubtedly of the highest benefit to the 
community.
Nothing tends to refine and humiliate a man more than 
Natural History pursuits of one kind or another ; humiliate, because 
every atom of further knowledge gained only goes to prove to an 
honest thinker the vast extent of his own ignorance ; and what can be 
more refining than to become conversant with the infinite loveliness 
and exquisite refinement of Nature ?
There are, however, naturalists, 
and naturalists — men of the collector type, to whom the possession of 
an object is of far more attraction and importance than any history 
or knowledge about that object.
Collectors certainly do discover a 
new species, or occasionally an unrecorded diatom ; but what assistance 
is given to Natural History investigation by men who do this, when 
they are ignorant of the life-history of the commonest objects in 
Nature, and totally insensible to their beauty — merely because it is 
common, and what every one has got, therefore (lovely and interesting 
though it may be) beneath their notice ?
This is not Natural History, 
nor will science be advanced one whit by such a type of naturalist.
No. The greater the man, the more the common objects around his 
every-day life open out marvels to his imagination, and picture 
wondrous images to his restless fancy, leading him onward deeper 
and deeper from the known to the yet unknown.
I am told that there is a great rage just now amongst " insect 
collectors " for varieties.
No one can say one word against the study 
of varieties whereby some scientific problem can be elucidated as the 
outcome of natural inherent tendencies, or as an evidence of the results 
of obstruction to natural development.
But there are processes 
whereby varieties of lepidoptera are manufactured to meet the existing 
requirements of the insect market.
I hear of entomologists who first 
feed the larvae upon its own wholesome diet, and then upon something 
else totally at variance with the natural tendencies of its appetite.
At 
the same time the unhappy caterpillar is subjected to the alternate 
heat of a warm fire, and the cold of a damp cellar.
Now these 
experiments are all very well in their way, but they have clearly a 
tendency to divert men from the true objects and aims of Natural 
History study — in fact, to make them followers of artificial history.
West : Cryptogamic Bepoet foe 1880.
133 
The aims, then, of Natural History societies must be based upon 
the great principle of protecting as well as observing the objects of their 
study — a study which is so engrossing, and contributes so markedly 
towards lighting up the deep shadows in our lives.
One important feature of the Field Naturalists' societies is, that they 
are in direct opposition to the miserable skeletonised mockery of a 
closet naturalist.
Let it be the object of all naturalists to study the 
out-door features of Nature : not to be annihilating all that is rare 
or beautiful to satisfy a too -frequent craving for collecting.
But 
rather let them be collectors of historical details and facts in the 
life-history of plants and animals.
Finally, the true naturalist must 
so guide and control his study that, in the eagerness to possess, he 
will not abdicate his position as a man — and " pity the plumage, but 
forget the dying bird." 
YOKKSHIRE NATURALISTS' UNION.— CRYPTOGAMIC 
REPORT FOR 1880.
By Wm. West, Cryptogamic Secretary.
Cue " Transactions" have hitherto (up to the end of 1879) included a 
record of what has been done during the year by members of the 
Union at the meetings, and also a record of the best work done in 
Yorkshire by members privately.
It is now wished that this part of 
the labours of the Union may appear in the organ of the Union — the 
Naturalist — and that the Transactions in future shall consist of 
systematic and thoroughly authentic lists of the recent and fossil 
fauna and flora of the county as complete as it is possible to provide 
them, and of additions to such lists.
Repetition of records should be 
avoided as far as possible ; I therefore do not intend to re-mention 
anything that has already appeared in the reports of the Union 
meetings as given in the Naturalist.
When we state what number of Cryptogams have been collected at 
the meetings of the Union, we speak with regard to those fully 
recognised in the field or at the meetings, also in the report in the 
Naturalist we speak of those recognised up to the date of writing the 
report ; but in addition to these there is usually a surplus left un- 
worked up, and it is mostly for these remnants that we are indebted 
for anything now mentioned.
A large number of these " arrears " are 
still unexamined, so that until these are exhausted we cannot fully 
estimate the work accomplished by means of the " rambles." 
134 
The Naturalist.
, The only additions worth mentioning for the Masham excursion are 
the following : — Sphagnum acutifolium Ehrh., var.
ruhellum Wils., S.
cuspidaium Ehrh., var.
plumosum Nees, Campylopiis pyriformis Brid., 
Barhiila Icevipila Brid., Pogonatum urnigerum L., Leucodon sciuroides L., 
BurhyncMum myomroides L., and Hypnum exannulatum Gumb., to the 
mosses ; Trichocolea tomentella Ehrh, Radula complanata L., PlagiocMla 
asphnioides L., and Jungermannia harhata Schreb., to the hepatics.
The best additions to the list for the Castle Howard meeting are — 
Barbula spadicea Mitt., Ulota BrucJiii Hornsch., Fissidens viridulus 
Wils., and RJiyncJwstegium inurale Hedw., to the mosses, and GompJio- 
nema olivaceum to the algse.
There is nothing worthy of note further than what has already 
appeared for the meetings at Barnsley and Boston Spa.
Peziza liepatica Batsch., Cymbella gastroides Kg., Cosmarium margeri- 
tiferum Breb., and Comiarium pyramidatum Breb., were collected at 
Mars den.
The best addition to the Market Weighton list is Polyporus 
annosus Fr.
The following lists illustrate the best finds of members during the 
year, whilst privately investigating the flora of the county : — 
VASCULAR CRYPTOGAMS.
Lycopodium Selago, L., near Selby, W.
N. Cheesman.
k rather 
interesting discovery in such a locality, the altitude being only 
about 20 feet.
Mr. Cheesman writes : — " I found it last autumn, 
growing in a railway delving about a mile from the town at 
the extreme border of the West Riding.
I am not aware of its 
occurrence an}^here in the district.
The plants numbering about 
20 or 30, were growing in a patch of rather elevated sandy soil in 
the cutting, the subsoil of which had been thrown up for the railway 
embankment.
The lycopod was fruiting freely, and seemed as much 
at home as some I had observed a few weeks before on Ingle- 
borough.
* * * I should like to know how it is that L.
Selago has 
sprung up in this place.
Is this plant another ^ relic of a boreal 
age,' and have the spores lain dormant in the ground during the 
ages that have passed since the last glacial period, and become 
quickened into life through the sun's influence on the removal of 
the two or three feet of soil from the present ground Mr. Chees- 
man then invites opinions on this occurrence.

INSECT-HUNTING IN SCOTLAND.* 
By Nicholas Cooke.
About last meeting, our worthy secretary suggested that I should 
write a paper on the above subject for the next meeting, which I 
willingly consented to do, and thought of commencing by making 
some excuse for the matter of it ; bnt when we consider the simple 
fact that the richest clothing worn by the ladies of all lands is the 
produce of a moth, insect-hunting needs no apology, nor does it want 
recommendation.
When I thought of the many delightful hours I have spent whilst 
hunting for insects, in company with other kindred spirits (some of 
whom are gone to a brighter clime and happier hunting-grounds), the 
words of a poet were brought to my recollection : — 
" Man cannot stand beneath a loftier dome 
Than this cerulean canopy of light, 
The Eternal's vast, immeasurable home, 
Lovely by day, and wonderful by night ; 
Than this enamelled floor, so greenly bright, 
A richer pavement man hath never trod.
He cannot gaze upon a holier sight 
Than fleeting cloud, fresh wave, and fruitful sod — 
Leaves of that boundless book writ by the hand of God !" 
My first journey to Scotland was in June, 1864, in company with 
my sons Benjamin and Charles.
We arrived at Rannoch on the 25th 
* Eead before Lancashire and Cheshire Entomological Society, Feb. 28th, 1881.

The NA.TURALIST.
of that month, and lodged at the hut of Miss Cameron, the postman's 
sister who drove us from Pitlochry railway station to this place, a 
village named Camachgouran, about three miles from the head of 
Rannoch.
In this hut of two small rooms, a kitchen and parlour and 
bedroom combined, we were made very comfortable by the tenant, who 
kept a cow, so that we were supplied with good milk, butter, and eggs, 
but could get little else, except bread and oatmeal.
Nothing better is 
needed by those who are determined to enjoy the country life such as 
we went there on purpose for.
The worst of it was, the want of light, 
the only window in the room being but about eighteen inches square.
We worked chiefly on property belonging to Mrs. Eobertson, now 
living at Cross Crag, close to the village at the edge of the Loch, but 
when we were there she lived in a large house at the head of the Loch.
She likes to be asked permission to collect insects on her ground, but 
we did not find this out till afterwards.
I asked her permission to fish 
the Loch one day, and she kindly gave me liberty to do so, and sent 
her keeper to wait on us with her boat.
At sugar we got plenty of Reciilinea^ Adusta, Brunnea, Festiva, 
Duplaris, Ferruginea^ Trilinea, Dentina, with a few Occulta and Tincta, 
the latter very shy, flying off on our approach.
To capture them you 
must either be quick or make them drunk by adding plenty of rum to 
the sweets.
We got other common species at sugar, and on the low 
ground took on the wing Blandlaia, common, also Casiata and Ruptaria^ 
&c.
; on the mountains Salicata, Munitata, Alpinalis, Schulziatia, Ger- 
ningona, Coniferata &c., also one Glauca was brought to us by sofiie 
person.
On the summits of Cross Crag and Scheialion we took 
Trepidaria ; it was flying on the latter mountain at an elevation of 
about 3,500 feet at eight o'clock a.m.
; and on the former we found it 
at all hours of the day.
I found pupa skins of iScoliaeformis sticking 
out of birch trunks, and some old stumps long since dead were com- 
pletely riddled by this species.
I sent one of my sons to Eannoch on 
purpose to get this insect the following year, as we were then too late, 
the weather having been very hot ; but he only obtained three 
specimens.
He, however, obtained a remarkably rich specimen of 
Hirtaria, some fine Carbonaria^ and on a mountain Melaiiopa, but not 
many of either.
When sugaring, we found each night a considerable 
number of that beautiful beetle, Cdonia metallica, on the old sugar.
On the 24:th June, 1866, 1 visited Edinburgh.
Mr. Edwin Birchall, 
who had intended to join me, could not leave home as he had hoped, 
but sent his son Howard, who afterwards joined me at Fort William ; 
and I found on Arthur's Seat fresh specimens of Artaxerxes flying.
An old man kindly showed me the spot most frequented by this

butterfly, which is on the east side, close to a wall, and in a few 
minutes I boxed about a dozen, and then went away, as it was Sunday 
afternoon, and a large crowd had soon collected round me.
After Mr. Howard Birchall met me at Fort William, we proceeded 
to Spean Bridge, and obtained lodgings at a farm-house named Juch, 
about three miles up the river Spean ; but I spent a day before he 
came to me in Glen Nevis, where I found Alexis and Davus in plenty 
flying over the heather, also fumata, and ChcBrophyllata in the greatest 
profusion ; and higher up Ben Nevis Mimitata and Salicata (common), 
also a Carahus nitens, the only specimen it has been my good fortune 
to see alive.
On the 27th we took Alpinalis and Epiphron in plenty 
on Ben-e-Bhean ; near the river, at sugar, Occnlta, Batis, Contigua, 
MenyantJiidis, Leporina, Aiigur^ Festiva, Conflua, Exclamationis^ Pleda, 
Gemina, Pallens, Impura^ Lithargyria, Rumicis, Adusta, Basilinea, 
Rurea, Polyodon, Pronuha, Duplaris^ C~nigrum, Pisi, Denti?ia, Lucipara, 
&c.
My object in visiting this locality was to ascertain if Mr.
Buxton's report in the Entomologist that he had seen pupa skins of 
ScolicBformis sticking out of birch trees near Roy Bridge was correct ; 
and on the 28th June I examined the trees on the river bank, where 
the river Roy joins the Spean, but could find no trace of the moth.
I 
took a singular variety of Camelina here, and at sugar Tincta, Nebulosa^ 
Brunnea, Bella, Rectilinea, Fe&tucce, PorpJiyrea, Eerruginea, Oleracea, 
Suffusa, and Bespecta\ on the 4th July, Cubicularis, Unanimis, Trian- 
gulum, Typica, Meticulosa, TJialassina, and Baja.
On the mountain I 
took Uujicinctata, Munitata, Salicata, Alpinalis, Sylvdlus, &c.
; on the 
moor Davus was in good condition, but not numerous.
Selene was 
common by the side of the river Cour, and we saw a few Napi very 
much darker than our English type.

Picus major at Skircoat.
— On the 1st of March, a gentleman at Skir- 
coat put some suet and birdlime to catch a pair of great-tits, under the 
impression that they were blackcaps {Sylvia atricapilla).
He caught a fine 
female specimen of the great spotted woodpecker {Picus major), which he 
kept three days and then set at liberty.

The Lark was heard in full song by Mr. Berry, near his house,

Cuckoo.
— A correspondent informs us that he heard the cuckoo several 
times on the morning of the 12th March, at Netherton, near Hudders- 
field, and called the attention of others of his family to bear him witness.
This is earlier by at least a month than its earliest recorded appearance

in this district, and on our expressing our doubts about it, lie positively 
asserts that there can really be no question of the fact, as it was heard by 
others on the same morning, though not since.
Can any of our corres- 
pondents confirm this extraordinary statement?

CoERECTiON.
— There is a slight error in my paper on The Coleoptera 
of Liverpool and Neighbourhood." It is the capture of Dromins linearis 
and Demetrius atricapillus on mugwort {Artemisia campestris) ; it ought to 
have been " on A.

REVIEW.—'' British Birds : their Nests and Eggs.
By S.
L. Mosley 
(Huddersfield and Hartlepool)." In monthly parts, superior edition 2s., 
cheaper edition Is.
: Nos. I., II., and III.
— Although we have no lack of 
books on British birds and their eggs, we think there is still quite room 
for one of the character of Mr. Mosley's.
Each part contains four 
beautiful plates, hand-colored by the author, in almost every case from 
examples of birds and eggs in the cabinets of our ornithologists and 
ODlogists — two of them representing the birds, and the other two the eggs, 
described in the part.
The text is clear and distinct, although we notice 
an occasional slight printer's error ; and full and accurate particulars as 
to size, plumage, flight, migration, nest and eggs, of each species and 
variety are given.
The whole is corrected and revised by a well-known 
ornithologist, one of our most honoured naturalists, and a Fellow of 
the Zoological Society ; for although his name does not appear in con- 
nection with the work, we at once guessed who it was.
The superior 
edition is very well got up, and the cheaper one is not far behind it ; 
indeed for all working purposes we think it quite as good as the other.
It may be as well to add, also, that the "Birds " and ''Eggs " mayJbe 
had separately at half-price.
" North Staffordshire Naturalists' Field Club and Archaeological 
Society: Fifteenth Annual Report, 1880." — We have just received the 
above report, which, as usual, is a model of completeness.
It contains 
full reports of all the excursions which have been made, and of papers 
read, which are of great interest.
It is evident that the Society is a 
prosperous one, and doing good work, and we heartily commend their 
example, both of the work and its method of record, to other kindred 
institutions.
Obituary.— We deeply regret to record the death at the early age of 
thirty-five, of Mr. Edward R.
Alston, F.L.S., well known for his re- 
searches in connection with the birds and rodents.
Mr. Alston had 
always been very delicate, but had given promise of soon becoming one of 
our foremost men in his knowledge of the rodents, &c.
He had recently 
been elected secretary of the Linnean Society of London, and the Fellows 
of that Society, at the meeting on March I7th, shewed their sympathy, 
and their grief at his loss, by adjourning the meeting directly the 
formal business was disposed of.

scopical objects.
The chairman exhibited sections of Osmnnda and filix- 
mas, thorn of rose, and a number of interesting slides of insects, crystals, 
&c.
Mr. W.
West, a number of interesting slides illustrating anatomy, 
entomology, and botany.
Amongst the botanical exhibits of the latter 
were the archegonia of Milium pundatum, and the characteristic utricles 
of Sphagnum tenellum.
Mr. Faull, Batrachospermum moniliforme and 
scale mosses.
Meeting March 15th, Mr. J.
Firth in the chair.
— Mr. F.
Richmond 
read an instructive paper on Manu,re, and the Assimilation of Plants," 
in which he described the various manures that were used by farmers, 
&c.
In large towns great difficulty was experienced in disposing of 
night-soil ; in some cases it was buried, and got rid of in other ways.
The 
consequence was, a great loss was sustained.
If it were taken on to the 
land, over and above the farmers' manure, much better crops would be 
produced, as nightsoil was the best manure.
— H.
T. Soppitt, Hon. Sec, 
HuDDEESFiELD Naturalists' SOCIETY.
— Meeting 28th February, the 
president (Mr. 0.
P. Hobkirk) in the chair.
— Mr. S.
L. Mosley laid on 
the table a malformation of the egg of the domestic duck.
The egg was 
shaped somewhat similar to an oval bulb, the thin end being so prolonged 
as to give it the appearance of having been affixed to the stem of some 
plant.
Mr. Mosley drew attention to a number of different malformations 
both as to shape and colour, found in the eggs of domestic poultry and 
game, the eggs of many of our birds being entirely destitute of colouring 
matter whatever ; others having the colouring on one end only, when it 
should be spread all over the egg ; and, again, the colouring being at the 
small end when it should be at the opposite.
He intimated that the 
members would do well to look into and try and find some solution for 
these differences.
Mr. C.
P. Hobkirk then laid on the table a number of 
mosses from the islands of Colonsay and Oransay, off the west coast 
of Scotland, viz., Hypnum aduncum, molluscuw,, polygamum, and 
stellatum ; Bryilm pendulum and alpinum, Campylopus fragilis, and var.
densus, Racomitrium aciculare, and Ulota phyllantha.
Mr. Hobkirk then 
gave his lecture on " Some of the different Developments between Seeds 
and Spores," explained and illustrated by diagrams.
Meeting 12th March, Mr. Joseph Tindall in the chair.
— Messrs.
J. Yarley and G.
H. Crowther laid on the table the following botanical 
specimens : — Galanthus nivalis, Cardamine amara, Ficaria verna, Salix 
viminalisy catkins of Corylus avellana, and Betula alba.
In geology a 
specimen of Sigillaria oculata, by Mr, Yarley.
Mr. S.
L. Mosley showed 
a number of beautiful drawings of birds' eggs sent to him by Mr.
Battersby, Rathowen, Ireland ; they represent a number of different 
varieties of certain kinds of eggs.
The following were among the number 
shown : — Sparrow hawk (Accipiter nisus), kestrel {Falco tinnuncidus), 
sandpiper {Tringoides hypoleucus), dunlin {Tringa alpina), curlew {Nume- 
niits arquatus), landrail {Crex pratensis), nightjar {Caprimulgus eioropceus), 
hawfinch {Coccothraustes vulgaris), and the hooded crow {Corvus co7-nix).
Repoets of Societies.
143 
These were of great interest to tlie members on account of the beautiful 
markings and different shapes of many of them.
Mr. Varley laid on the 
table the stomach of the willow grouse, which was quite full of 
particles of twigs of the birch, thus showing to a certainty the kind of 
food they subsist upon.
Mr. Varley then proceeded with his paper upon 
*' The General Character and Structure of Birds," in which he noticed 
the differences of the lungs of birds and the mammalia, showed how the 
air is taken through the lungs into those hollow bones which in the 
mammalia and young birds are full of marrow, thus rendering the birds 
capable of being easily supported in the air, and many other points in 
their structure, well known to anatomical naturalists.
Lan"cashire and Cheshire Entomological Society.
— Monthly 
meeting, February 28th, in the Free Library.
— The president (Mr. S.
J. 
Capper) read a letter he had received from Miss Ormerod, of Isleworth, 
which was accompanied by a copy of her "Notes of Observations on 
Injurious Insects, for 1880." The object of the work, he said, was the 
study of the life-history of certain insects injurious to our crops and fruit 
trees, so as to provide means for preventing their ravages.
He was sure 
the members of the society who had not already assisted Miss Ormerod 
by their observations ought to do so.
The number of insects selected for 
observation this year is thirty-two.
He then called attention to a work, 
now in the press, by the same authoress, entitled " Manual of Remedies 
and means of prevention for the attack of insects on food crops, forest 
trees, and fruits." The work, which will be published at 3s., will be 
invaluable to farmers and producers.
Mr. Nicholas Cooke read a paper 
entitled "Insect-Hunting in Scotland," in which he detailed his expe- 
rience of many summer holidays spent in collecting insects in various 
parts of Scotland — illustrating his paper with two cases of Scotch insects 
compared with English representatives of the same species — among 
which was a fine series of Cry modes exulis, one of the rarest moths of 
Scotland.
During the conversazione Lieut.
Mason exhibited some 
butterflies and beetles collected in Africa.

tion.
On behalf of Mr. W.
Grainge, of Harrogate, were exhibited a 
number of cryptogamic plants of various species, collected about that 
town.
Mr. W.
Atkinson showed the head of a four-horned Spanish 
sheep, bred at Tong Hall, near Leeds ; also a slab of flexible sandstone.
The president shewed a great variety of marine algse ; Mr. J.
W. Dixon, 
microphotographs ; Mr. E.
J. Ladmore, a section of mountain limestone 
from Denbigh, and one of oolite from North Ireland.
417th Meeting, March 15th — The president, who was in the chair, 
exhibited a specimen of the deep-nosed pipe-fish {Syphonostoma typhle), 
taken oflf the Yorkshire coast.
Mr. William Atkinson exhibited a large 
collection of marine algae collected at Whitby, Scarborough, Filey, 
riamborough Head, and Bridlington, including Wormshioldia sanguinea^ 
Forphyra laciniata, Dnmontia filiformis, Cladophora areta, Laurencia

P. 
Hobkirk, F.L.S., Huddersfield, gave a lecture on "A Drop of Water." 
Mr. Hobkirk carefully considered the molecularity of water, and in the 
course of his lecture exhibited many useful and interesting experiments 
bearing upon the subject, showing, amongst other things, in a very 
scientific manner the marvellous eSects produced by atmospheric agency 
upon ice and water, or the two combined.
The origin, formation, 
structure, and final dissolution of glaciers was next dealt with, in 
illustration of which some very magnificent views were shown by means 
of the oxy-hydrogen lantern.
Meeting Mar. 9th, for the purpose of confirming the new rules and 
laws, it being intended to place the Society upon a permanent found_a- 
tion, so that, when got fully into operation, much good work may be 
expected as the result- Dr. Crowther occupied the chair, and called upon 
the general secretary (Mr. E.
B, Wrigglesworth) to read over and explain 
the proposed alterations, which, after some rather lively discussion, were 
passed in their entirety.
The Society is about to inaugurate rambles and 
excursions, which will take place during the coming summer, for out- 
door investigation in Natural History.
Meeting March 16th, Mr. Wainwright, F.L.S., in the chair.
—A paper 
was read by Mr. John Spurling, Wakefield, on " The Fertilization of 
the Salvia and Orchids.
" The chief topics taken up in the paper were 
the structure and habits of the two orders.
After the lecture, the 
members and public present were entertained to a series of microscopical 
exhibits of a very varied description, of which the following, amongst 
others, may be mentioned : — Trichini in human muscle, Mr. J.
L. 
Chaplin ; pollen from hollyhock ; fern spores and pollen from Eucharis, 
Mr. Fletcher ; Polycystina from Barbadoes, and some exceedingly 
interesting diatoms, Mr. Spurling ; water animalcules and spiders, Mr.

ON YORKSHIRE BATS: 
ANt) ON THE PEOBABILITY OF ADDITIONS BEING 
MADE TO THE LIST.
By W.
Dbnison Roebuck.
While preparing my share of Mr. Clarke's and my forthcoming 
" Handbook of Yorkshire Vertebrates," I found that there was at least 
one specimen of bat absent from our list, which may very reasonably 
be expected to occur when looked for.
While pointing this out, it 
may be of interest to take a general view of the present state of our 
knowledge of Yorkshire Chiroptera.
So far as at present recorded the list includes five out of fifteen 
bats known to inhabit Britain.
These are — 
1 Plecotus auritus, long-eared bat.
2 Vesperiigo noctula, great bat.
3 V.
leislerij hairy-armed bat.
4 V.
pipisirellus, common bat.
5 Vespertilio nattereri, reddish-gray bat.
Three of these are common, and the other two ver^^ rare, only being 
recorded in individual cases.
I will treat of the five species in detail.
1. Flecotus auritus (L).
The long-eared bat, which ranges throughout England, Ireland, and 
Scotland, is widely distributed, and I believe very common throughout 
Yorkshire, In some places it is reported to be not so common as the 
Pipistrelle, as, for instance, at Huddersfield, and at Guisborough, in 
Cleveland.
On the other hand, at Glaisdale, in Cleveland, it is 
reported as exceeding the Pipistrelle in numbers.
So far as my own 
observations made near Harrogate are concerned, I have met with it 
oftener than I have met with the Pipistrelle ; but I do not regard my- 
seK as able to say which is the more abundant of the two species.
2. Vesperugo noctula (Schreb).
The Noctula, or great bat, which is more solitary in its habits and 
flies higher in the air than the other bats, is specially interesting to us 
on account of its geographical range.
As is the case with the 
nightingale, the northward range of this fine bat terminates — so far as 
it is known — in the county of York ; and, like the nightingale, it is 
entirely absent from Scotland and Ireland ; while throughout the 
whole area of Yorkshire, and of the midland, eastern and southern 
counties of England, it is generally distributed and of frequent 
occurrence.

The Naturalist.
The records of its Yorkshire distribution whicli are in my possession 
through the kindness of numerous correspondents, show that the 
Noctule is found as far to the north as Carperby, Masham, Keighley, 
Northallerton and Whitby ; while it is not uncommon at Scarbro, 
Leeds, Harrogate, Tadcaster, Boston Spa, and Goole.
It would be 
interesting if the naturalists of Durham and Northumberland would 
ascertain whether its range can be extended beyond the line of the 
Tees, which at present forms its northern boundary ; while for York- 
shire naturalists only remains the task of filling up the blanks in the 
records of its range within the county.
3. Vesperugo leisleri (Kuhl).
The hairy-armed bat, which is known to inhabit the English shires of 
Warwick, Worcester, and Gloucester, and the Irish county of Armagh, 
is known for Yorkshire only by a single record.
Mr. Edward Newman, 
in a series of " Collected Observations on British Bats," published 
in the Field for March 7, 1874, p.
218, remarked that Mr. Bond 
said that he had only seen three specimens of this species, all of which 
were taken from a chimney-shaft near Leeds.
4. Vesperugo pipistrellus (Schreb.) 
The Pipistrelle, or common bat, is generally diffused and very 
abundant, not only in this county, but throughout the British Islands, 
extending even to the Outer Hebrides, and the Orkneys.
There is no 
need to enter into any details as to its Yorkshire localities.
5. Vespertilio natter eri (Kuhl.) 
The reddish-grey bat, which is widely distributed, though local, in 
England and Ireland, has only once been reported to occur in Scotland, 
and once in Yorkshire.
Mr. Henry Denny, who published, in 1840, a 
catalogue of animals of the Leeds district, stated that of this species a 
living pair were brought him for the Museum of the Philosophical 
Society, in June of the preceding year (1839), which were taken out of 
an old tree in Oakwell Wood, near Birstall.
This completes the Yorkshire list ; but it may be of service to consider 
what other species may be expected to occur.
Of the ten remaining British 
species, two may be at once rejected as unlikely to occur, having each 
been admitted to the British list on the strength of a single individual 
being taken ; Vesperugo discolor (Nattererj, the parti-colored bat, and 
Vespertilio murinus (Schreb.), the mouse-colored bat.
The former 
occured at Plymouth, and the supposition is induced that it was most 
probably accidentally introduced in the rigging of a ship.
The latter 
was taken in the gardens of the British Museum, in London, and this 
Roebuck : On Yoekshire Bats.
147 
instance, consequently, lies open to suspicion also.
But it is remark- 
able that this species, which is pre-eminently the common bat of the 
European Continent, should be so entirely absent from Britain.
The accidental occurrences being weeded out, we have eight species left.
Of these, we can hardly expect to meet with those species whose 
geographical range is restricted to the southern counties of England.
This consideration deprives us of the expectation of adding to our 
fauna the two horseshoe bats (Bhinolophus hipposideros and E.
ferrum- 
equinum), the serotine (Vesperugo serotinus), Vespertilio dasycneme^ 
Bechstein's bat ( V.
Bechsteinii), and the whiskered bat {V.
my sf acinus).
There then remain two species only to be looked for.
The Barbastelle 
{Synotus barbastell.us) which is very widely distributed in the southern 
and midland counties of England, reaches as far northwards as 
Cheshire and JSTorfolk, though it has never been reported for the 
north of England, nor for Scotland and Ireland.
Possibly we may 
yet have the Barbastelle added to our county list.
There only remains one species to consider, and the whole practical 
outcome of this paper may be summed up in a sentence — that Dau- 
benton's bat, Vespertilio Dauhentonii Leissler, — ought to be found with 
us, judging from its known recorded distribution.
It is very widely 
diffused over the whole of the British Isles, though perhaps rather 
local.
Possibly it is overlooked from the great peculiarities of its 
habits and mode of feeding.
In Bell's British Quadrupeds, 2nd ed., 
1874, p.
61, we find its habits thus described : — 
" So peculiar are the vespertinal habits of this species, that, while 
very abundant, an ordinary observer might be quite unconscious of 
its existence.
It is essentially an aquatic species, if such an expression 
be admissible, applied to an animal which never enters the water.
It 
haunts that element continually, flying so near its surface as to render 
it difficult to distinguish between the creature itself and its reflection.
The flight, quivering and slow, is performed by very slight but rapid 
strokes of the wings ; it may, indeed, be said to vibrate, rather than 
fly, over the surface of the water.
It could not well fly in any other 
manner so near the surface v/ithout often striking it, and this it seldom, 
or perhaps never, does, although it often pauses to dip its nose into 
the water, whether to drink or pick up some floating food, we have 
been unable to ascertain.
The Daubenton's Bat is, we suspect, rather 
an abundant species in the middle parts of England, * * *." 
This species thus appears a very likely one to occur in Yorkshire, 
especially as we learn from Alston's Catalogue of Scottish Mammalia 
that it has occurred in various Scottish localities and is pretty widely 
148 
The Na^turalist.
distributed on the Scottish mainland, and also when we further leam 
it has occurred in the neighbouring county of Durham.
It would be of interest if our naturalists would keep a steady look- 
out for this interesting species during the coming summer, as from 
the above remarks it would in all probability be found.
Sunny Bank, Leeds, 
April 5th, 1881.
INSECT-HUNTING IN SCOTLAND.
By Nicholas Cooke.
(Concluded.) 
In a meadow by the Spean we took great quantities of Blandiata, and 
on the low heathy ground were myriads of Ckaropkyllata and Fumata, 
a few Tkecla rubi, and Alexis.
We took forty- three species of Noctuse 
here in ten days.
Amongst the larvsB found here were Trichiura 
cratcegi and JPoecilocampa poiyuli.
This locality abounded with insect 
life in greater profusion than any place I ever visited, and I doubt not 
that if it were properly worked, it would prove even more productive 
than the famed Rannoch ground.
In June, 1867, I again visited Inch, for the purpose of trying to 
find the nest of the snow-bunting, having seen a number of these birds 
the previous visit, on the summit of Ben-e-Bhean in breeding plumage^ 
but was disappointed, as we did not find a single bird, though we 
ascended the mountain — nearly 4,000 feet in height — twice for this 
purpose.
I added to my previous list Cambricata, lunaria and silaceata.
On the 30th June, 1869, I visited Moy, and that night at sugar 
obtained my first specimen of Exulis.
This locality is by no means 
as good a one for collecting insects as Roy Bridge, ten miles 
lower down Glen Spean, the number of species being very much fewer.
There are, however, some good things to be met with, such as 
Dictceoides, Myricce, Lutulenta, var.
luneburg&nsis, Rectilinea^ Vetusta, 
Conflua, Cofitigua, FestuccB, Leporina, and Epiphron.
Furcatellus 
abounds high up on Craig Maighaidh, with Alpinalis, Eudorea alpina 
and gracilialis\ also irriguana, I once took a Trepidaria, but only 
one.
The butterflies are few, Daviis, PampJiilus^ Aglaia, Papliia, Alexis^ 
and UrticcB being all I have seen, except an occasional " white," 
probably Rapee.
Tristata is common on the moors, and Hastata, riifi- 
cinctata^ ericetata, and blandiata also occurred amongst the sweet gale.
Since 1869 I have visited Moy nearly every year, and have been out 
Cooke : Insect-Hunting in Scotland.
149 
there at all hours of the night and day, and never enjoyed the country 
so much as there.
From the summit of the mountain there is the 
most extensive view of mountain-tops in every direction that it has 
been my lot to see.
The entomologist may find plenty of occupation 
here, but I must confess it is the fishing, together with hope of 
obtaining Exulis, that has attracted me so much to the spot.
Why some of the Scotch varieties of lepidoptera should be darker 
in colour than English examples of the same species, and others lighter, 
is a mystery I have never heard satisfactorily explained ; and I have 
brought a small collection of Scotch contrasted with English specimens, 
as well as a few Continental ones, for your inspection.
You will 
observe that Festucce and Leporina are lighter in colour than our 
specimens — the latter being almost perfectly white at Moy — whilst 
ISlapi, Jdusta, Polyodon, Orbona, Rurea, Glareosa, Impura^ Dentina, &c., 
are darker than ours.
With regard to Exulis, I wish to add that sugar 
cannot be the proper way to take this species, though as yet I am not 
aware that it has been got in any other way, except perhaps a single 
specimen at rest in the daytime.
I am convinced that it must be as 
common as most species if we only knew how it breeds, for it is spread 
over an extent of at least 200 miles from west to east, and probably 
exists on all the moors in the north of Scotland.
There is nothing to 
prevent it from being common.
If our variety is, as Dr. Staudinger 
pronounced it to be, only a variety of the species which he found 
abundant in Iceland, how is it that we cannot find it in the same way 
that he did 1 It does not at Moy hang on the long grass at dusk as 
he says it does in Iceland, nor do the larvae make galleries in the moss 
as he says they do, nor do they fly at the flowers in the daytime as he 
has seen them in Iceland.
There is a flower — that of Orchis maculata — 
which is attractive to it by night, but I never saw it feeding that way, 
though I have collected the flowers in bunches and placed them in jugs 
of water in situations I thought likely to attract them when on the 
wing.
How I know that they frequent this flower is, that I captured 
several with the pollen of it sticking to their palpi.
The figure 
supposed to represent the larva which I have seen might have been a 
portrait of that of Humuli, so much is it like that species ; and I 
strongly suspect that some blunder has been made about this matter.
I cannot believe that the larvse of our Exulis will turn out to be similar 
to that of Humuli, and I hope to have the opportunity of hunting for 
- the full-fed larvse this spring.
I have never been in Scotland when 
the larva could have been feeding, or, if it was hatched, they could not 
be large enough by the middle of September to catch the eye, if even 
they were feeding on the outside of blades of grass.
150 
The Naturalist, 
My heart's in the Highlands, wherever I go " — not chasing the 
wild deer, nor following the roe, but hunting for Exiilis ; and I still 
hope the life-history of this rich insect is reserved for me to find out, 
I kept the last one I took alive for eleven days (I caught her on the 
26th August, 1879), to try to obtain eggs, but she laid none.
I have 
not had more than three or four females altogether, and I never knew 
one to part with an egg.
I visited Loch Awe last August for a few days.
All I saw at sugar 
were two or three Fimbria and a few PoJyodon, some dark.
By the side 
of the loch, about five miles up on the south side, I took about thirty 
Medea in bad condition at the edge of the wood.
There were also a 
quantity of what I thought were Napi, flying in a meadow, and one 
Aglaia.
In the wood were multitudes of common Geometrse, 1 also 
took by the shore of the loch a large ichneumon, Tragus lutorius, said 
to feed in larvae of Ocellatus or Atropos.
With regard to localities that I have seen on my journeys, I think 
of all places I ever saw, the Trossachs surpasses every other in appear- 
ance as a collecting ground, but no doubt nearly all the head of Loch 
Lomond, as well as the foot of Loch Katrine, also the east side of 
Loch Tay, are grand hunting-grounds ; as is also the country round 
Pitlochry and Dunkeld, and up the valley of the Tummel along the 
high road from Pitlochry to Kinloch-Ptannoch, the happy hunting- 
ground of most collectors who have visited Scotland.
Then again, on 
the west coast there is a fine collecting country round Oban, near 
which pretty little port Nuhigena has been taken.
Further north is' 
Ballachulish, a magnificent bay, and in the neighbourhood is fine 
timber and nice ground as far as the entrance to Glencoe, at the other 
end of which is the great moor of Rannoch, twenty miles across.
The country round Forres also wants searching ; there is fine timber 
near Sandhills like our own.
The late Mr. E.
C. Buxton told me that 
he had found sugaring most successful about some of the salt-water 
lochs in the far north.
Occulta and other fine noctuse being more 
abundant there than elsewhere, and he has seen a great part of Scotland 
and tried nearly every place he visited for insects, though his object 
was sport — principally fishing.
The larva of Alpina is said to feed on 
Vaccinium Myrtillus, but not having met with the species myself, I can 
give no more information about it ; and Noctua sobrina is another rarity 
which I have not met with, but which must have been bred in quantity, 
as it has been lately offered for threepence each.
I should advise any- 
one ascending mountains for the purpose of collecting small things, to 
take up his setting case and stay and set all worth setting on the spot.
Cooke: Insect- Hunting in Scotland.
151 
The disappointment of finding all your captures spoiled by the jolting 
of a deep descent, together with the heat of a summer's day (such as an 
entomologist delights in, for then his game is most plentiful), is very 
discouraging, whereas, had they been set on the spot there would be 
some pleasure in looking at them when brought home.
I have seen 
C r ambus fur catellus in countless numbers at an elevation of over 3,000 
feet, and a lovely thing it is when just emerged from the pupa, but 
carry it down in a pill box on a hot day and it will not be worth a pin.
Ericellus is on lower ground, but I never met with it in plenty.
The 
EpipJiron on Craig Maigdaiith are the largest and brightest in colour of 
any I have seen.
I have never paid much attention to Coleoptera 
when in Scotland, but have taken Garabus glabratus plentifully ; also a 
pair of Arvensis at sugar, the only ones I ever met with, though I 
suppose it is regarded as a common species.
In Diptera I have noticed 
the Tabanidse in great abundance and variety, and very vicious in hot 
weather, but for the last two summers there have been very few flies 
of any kind, and last year bees were very scarce, so much so that the 
country people remarked to me that there were no bees in the heather 
bloom, although there was a profusion of flowers of all kinds.
I never 
saw Scotland so gay with flowers as last August.
With regard to the peasantry of Scotland I may say that I have 
found them very honest, and I feel a degree of trust in them that I 
feel nowhere else ; the only beings I fear in the Highlands at night are 
travelling tinkers and gipsies.
Owls also have occasionally caused a 
funny sensation at the roots of my hair when their extraordinary 
noises were not expected.
The Scotch are very reserved ; it is difficult 
to get information out of them, and some are superstitious, perhaps 
those of Irish extraction, of which there are many near Roy Bridge, 
where we tried a moth trap, leaving it out all night on- a wall where 
the light, unfortunately, shone across the village.
Mr. Buxton came 
next morning from his fishing box, Corry Hoyle, to tell us that we 
had better shut up our moth traps, as the peasantry had got it into their 
heads that we were making signals for some purpose that would not be 
to their interest, and we should be mobbed if we persisted in showing 
the light at night.
Again during the last summer I was sitting 
chatting with the mistress of the house out of doors at Moy (an old 
woman, upwards of 70 years of age), and she said, " Mr. Cooke, do you

the road, in winter, when covered with snow, there being no trees near 
Moy. A lichen-covered stone is as good as any tree to sugar.
Some 
things one would expect to find common on the Scotch moors are not 
so, Davus, Quercus^ Rubi, and Carpini being met with only sparingly.
The larvae of Qmrcus are very large towards September, and the 
Carpini small compared with ours ; this you may observe is the case 
with the specimens of the perfect insects in my box.
The little 
collection of types which the box contains, will, I trust, prove of more 
interest than what I have read on the subject.
I will only add that I 
believe any entomologist visiting the Highlands will wish to go again, 
and the probability is that if some of our young men would try some 
of the fresh localities I have named they would add species to our 
list.

conspicuous species, Zygcena exulans and Sciaphila argentana,

Cuckoo in March.
— With reference to the paragraph about the 
cuckoo in your last number, I may state that a report was made to me by 
a resident at Goole that he had heard the bird (but had not seen it) about 
the 18th ult.
I paid but little attention to it till I read your statement.

Ichneum.onidce at York.
— It may interest the members of the York- 
shire Naturalists' Union to know that the following species of Ichneu- 
monidca have been taken mostly in this neighbourhood.
They have been 
named for me by Messrs.
Fitch and Bridgman : — Ichneumon luctatorius 
found in Edlington Wood, near Doncaster ; I.
trilineatns, two examples 
by searching under bark of alder trees in Askham bog : all the remainder 
taken in this neighbourhood.
Paniscus cephalotes, bred from pupa of 
Dicranura vinula, P.
testaceus, flying round some hawthorn bushes, two 
specimens ; Eurylahns dims, bred, but am not certain about its host ; 
Enryproctus nigriceps, four specimens, bred from cocoons of Trichiosoma 
hetuleti, Pimpla rufata, nncum, and Stercorator, captured at large ; 
Platylahus pedatorius, Perilissns p)allidus, and Exetastes osculatorius, which 
I believe are new to the county ; Mesoleius opticus and aidicus, hovering 
above some willow stumps with larvae and pupse of S.
hembeciformis in.
These specimens came from the stumps, but whether from these larvae or 
not I am not prepared to say.
TrypJion elongator, Lissonota snlphurifera, 
and Agrypon canaliculatum, beat out of a hawthorn hedge in September, 
1879.
Ophion minutus, captured flying along a hedgerow.
In the Ento- 
mologist, vol.
xiii., page 54, Mr. Bridgman says of this species thai it is 
new to the British list.
This will, therefore, be the second British 
example.

Yorkshire Natural History.
— The editors of the Entomologists' 
Monthly Magazine, in reviewing the Transactions of the Yorkshire 
Naturalists' Union, make some remarks which are worthy of reproduction.
They say : — " The existence of such a multitude of Natural History 
Societies in a small district (for so Yorkshire is, notwithstanding it is our 
largest county), is probably an almost unique fact, and we believe we are 
154 
The Naturalist.
correct in stating that the majority of the members are of the artisan 
class.
* * * Those amongst Britishers " who know the tastes 
of some of the better class amongst our artisans in the great industrial 
centres (of which Yorkshire is one) will be little surprised at finding 
Naturalists so abundant among them ; to foreigners the fact must be a 
matter for some little astonishment.
It was a happy idea to unite these 
Societies under a central governing body, and this latter, if wise, should 
use its position for educational purposes on broad principles, by impressing 
upon the members the necessity of recognising the fact that Yorkshire is 
not Britain, and that Britain is only an island in the northern seas." —

143.) 
Mining Terms.
— I am compiling for the English Dialect Society a 
glossary of mining terms, and shall be much obliged to any one who will 
help me by sending lists of terms actually in use in any district, or 
references to works in which such terms may be found.

to the library, the former by the Rev. H.
H. Higgins, and the latter by 
Mr. Weightman.
Mr. C.
H. H.
Walker then read a paper on the 
Ichneumonidce, referring to the great number of British species of this 
family of insects, and describing the anatomy of a typical species^ illus- 
trating his remarks with well executed drawings.
He described the 
manner in which the female insect laid her egg in or upon the bodies 
of the caterpillars of butterflies, moths, or flies — the eggs hatching and 
the ichneumon grubs feeding inside the body of their host until they kill 
the caterpillar — when they leave the dead skin and spin their cocoons, 
from which the perfect insect emerges in a short time to carry on the 
work of destroying the enemies of our vegetable crops.
During the 
conversazione which followed Mr. Walker exhibited a case of ichneumons 
to illustrate his paper, Mr. Wall specimens of living insects under the 
microscope, and the secretary living larva of Agrotis porpliyrea taken at 
Bidston, and beetles collected during the last fortnight on the New 
Brighton sandhills.

Masham and Carperby, and the Pipistrelle, or common bat, from 
Masham.
Mr. Walter Raine showed a long-eared bat from Ryther, and 
read an interesting note on its habits in captivity ; he also showed (in the 
flesh) a fine squirrel in winter dress from Ryther.
A note by Mr. H.
G.^ 
Faber, relative to the black rat at Stockton-on-Tees was read, whereby 
it appeared that it was not quite so scarce there as had been reported.
Mr. Roebuck showed a photograph of the rough-legged buzzard captured 
in 1876 at Kilburn, N.
Yorks., and now in Mr. J.
Edson's collection.
A 
note by Mr. T.
H. Nelson, of Bishop Auckland, on the former abundance 
of seals at the mouth of the Tees, was read ; also a query from Mr.
Foster, of Sancton, as to the cause of twigs of Scotch fir dropping 
to the ground.
No explanation was arrived at.
Microscopic objects 
were shown, and Mr. Henry Marsh showed lepidoptera of recent 
capture.
421sT Meeting, April 12th, the president in the chair.
— He showed a 
series of spines of star-fish, including those of Luidia fragilissim-a from 
Aberdeen ; of Asterias vulgaris and Uraster ruhens from Flamborough 
Head ; and Ophiocoma neglecia from Devon.
Mr. F.

quantity of diatoms and desm\ds from Weetwood, amongst which were a 
considerable number of Meridion circulare ; Mr. W.
Teasdale showed 
crystalline forms of the aromatic bodies derived from coal tar by Dr. Otto 
N. Witt, who used the German nomenclature of chemical substances, 
Mo7ionitrodiphenylnitrosamine being a sample of the result.
Mr. J.
W.

— Monthly meeting, March 21st, 
Dr. Carrington, F.
R.S.Ed., in the chair.
— The principal part of the 
evening was devoted to the subject of " Ferns," Mr. Foster having 
brought a very large series of dried ferns, beautifully mounted.
The 
greater number were abnormal forms of British species, and the extreme 
variations shown were a source of interest to those who took a special 
interest in this class of cryptogams.
A collection of the ferns of Madeira, 
which had lately been presented to the Free Reference Library by the 
executors of the late John Windsor, F.L. S.
, was partially examined by 
the members present.
The Hon. Sec.
(T.
Rogers) called the attention of 
the members to a series of microscopic slides which he had brought, 
showing the prothallus of ferns in various stages of development, some 
showing the sperm cells, and others the perfected young plants.
Two 
slides showed the germination of the spores of Hymenophyllum while 
stilbm situ in their bi-labial indusium.
Other slides showed the germi- 
nation of young ferns direct from the spore receptacles on the vein lets 
of the pinnules of Adiantum capillis-veneris .
In some cases these could 
be seen under the perfected indusium, whilst in others the indusium was 
imperfect and rudimentary.
Mr. W.
H. Pearson exhibited specimens 
158 
The Naturalist.
and drawings of a hepatic new to Britain — Jungermannia Juratzhana 
(Limpriclit), which he had detected in a collection made by Mr. West 
of Bradford, last year, when on Ben Lawers.
Mr. Pearson also read a 
translation of a paper by G, Limpricht on Gymnomitrium adustnm, in 
which he clearly establishes the fact of a true Gymnomitrium adustum 
(Nees.) He therefore alters the name of Sarcoscyphus adustus (Spruce) 
to Sarcoscyphus Sprucii (Limpricht).
Specimens and drawings of the two 
species were afterwards shown.
Mr. Pearson exhibited specimens of the 
new Radida commutata (Gottsche), which had been collected by Mr.
C. J.
Wild, in the same locality, as previously mentioned at the last 
meeting.
— T.
Rogers, Hon. Sec.
OvENDEN Naturalists' Society.
— Meeting, March 26th.
— The 
president (Mr. James Spencer) exhibited a series of interesting micro- 
scopical sections of coal plants, including another new sporangium.
It 
is about the same size and form as the one shown at the last meeting, 
containing Zygosporites brevipes.
The present one contains microspores 
of a most peculiar form ; they are shaped almost like a cockle shell, and 
very much smaller than Zygosporites brevipes.
At the first glance they 
look like a miniature copy of the large fringed microspores so common in 
our coal balls, but upon closer inspection they are seen to be of a more 
decidedly triangular form, and the fringe, of extremely delicate hair, is 
chiefly confined to what may be termed the base of the triangle, or mouth 
of the spore.
The spores are arranged in groups, each group containing 
four spores, hence their name of tetraspores.
Some idea may be formed 
of their minuteness from the fact that the sporangium or " bag " which 
contains them is only about the one hundredth part of an inch in breadth 
by about the thirty-fifth part of an inch in length, and yet it contained 
many hundreds of spores.
He also exhibited the fossil fungus Peronos- 
porites antiquarius in several coal plants, and, for comparison, sections of 
the recent pine (Pinus sylvestris) containing fungus mycelium.
The wheat- 
ear was heard in Ovenden on the 20th March, and a kittiwake was found 
dead in Shroggs Wood on the 22nd.
Meeting, April 11th.
— A lecture on " The Fossil Flora of the Coal- 
measure " was given by Mr. James Spencer, illustrated by specimens of 
plants from the splendid collection of the Society's Museum, and by a 
large series of diagrams illustrative of the various fossil plants, shewing 
their internal structure, found by the lecturer in the coal strata of the 
district.
Yorkshire Naturalists' Union'.
— The inaugural excursion of the 
present season took place in the West Riding, at Skipton, on Easter 
Monday, the 18th of April.
In addition to the immediate vicinity of the 
place of meeting — the Church, the Castle and its woods, — the following 
localities were visited and explored by the members : — Barnoldswick, 
Gisburn, Elslack, Thornton, Draughton, and Cracoe.
Geological parties 
were arranged and successfully led by Mr. Jones, the local secretary for 
Reports of Societies.
159 
the meeting.
The day was very favourable, the bright sunshine doing 
much to counteract the effects of a cold east wind.
A most enjoyable 
day was spent.
The meetings were held at the Devonshire Hotel, 
where about forty members partook of tea.
At the general meeting the 
number of members was considerably augmented, and in all between 
fifty and sixty members were present, representing eleven of the incor- 
porated Societies.
The chair was filled by Mr. Wm.
Cash, F.G.S., of 
Halifax.
The minutes having been read and confirmed, the Keighley 
Scientific and Literary Society was admitted into the Union on the 
motion of Mr. Jones, seconded by Mr. Roebuck.
A list of new sub- 
scribers, ten in number, was read to the meeting, and a vote of thanks 
recorded.
Yotes of thanks were then presented to the local secretary 
for the able manner in which he had arranged for the meeting ; to the 
donors of several valuable acquisitions to the library ; to Mr. Ross, the 
agent for Sir H.
J. Tufton, and to Mr. Dewhirst, for permission to 
ramble on their estates.
The Sectional Reports were then given as 
follows : — Mr. Wm.
Eagle Clarke, for vertebrate zoology, stated that in 
a walk from Barnoldswick to Gisburn and back, twenty-three species of 
resident birds had been observed, including local species of the northern 
type, such as the dipper, grey wagtail, and curlew ; six summer visitants, 
the redstart, willow-wren, swallow, sand-martin, white wagtail, and pied 
flycatcher — the last two being most interesting observations ; the white 
wagtail having been recorded on very few occasions in the county; 
whilst Ribblesdale (Yorkshire) is a new locality for the extremely local 
pied flycatcher.
Mr. Wm.
Cash, for conchological section, reported 
eleven species (freshwater), viz., Sphserium corneum, Bithinia tentaculata, 
Valvata piscinalis, Limnsea peregi'a, L.
palustris, L.
truncatula, Succinea 
— gracilis, Planorbis contortus, P.
vortex, Physa fontinalis, and Ancylus 
fluviatilis — all at Gisburn ; also twenty-two land species, viz., Yitrina 
pellucida, Zonites cellarius, Z.
alliarius, Z.
nitidulus, Z.
crystallinus, 
Z. purus, Z.
nitidus.
Helix hispida, H.
caperata, H.
arbustorum, and 
H. nifescens, in woods near Skipton Castle ; H.
rupestris at Draughton ; 
H. nemoralis, H.
rotundata, ClausiKa laminata, C.
rugosa, C, rugosa.
var.
dubia, Cochlicopa tridens, C.
lubrica, and Pupa umbilicata, obtained 
near Skipton Castle ; Balea perversa at Draughton ; and Corychium 
minimum, also near Skipton Castle.
In the entomological section Mr.
G. T.
Porritt reported that the prolonged winter had retarded vegetation, 
and consequently there were but few insects.
A few species in the 
various orders had been taken, but none worthy of special note.
Mr. W.
West reported for the botanical section.
The localities visited were the 
immediate vicinity of Skipton, and the district about Elslack, Thornton, 
Barnoldswick, and Gisburn.
The season being very backward, only 184 
species of vascular plants were noted, Ranunculus Lenormandi, Yiola 
hirta, Nuphar lutea, and Primula farinosa being among the rarer ones 
collected.
A large number of mosses were collected, fifty species being 
recognised at the meeting ; Brachythecium rivulare, Eurhynchium 
IGO 
The Naturalist.
piliferum, Hypnum chrysophyllum, and Antitrichia curtipendula being 
amongst them.
Four common species of Hepaticse were collected.
Eight 
species of lichens were gathered, none of them being rare.
Sixteen 4' 
species of fungi were seen, including Spheeria sperinoides, Hysteriui 
pulicare, Peziza stercorea, and Puccinia adoxse.
A number of algte wf 
collected, Gomphonema olivaceum, Cymbella gastroides, Mouge 
genuflexa, Closterium lunula, Fragilaria virescens, Meridion circuL 
Synedra splendens, and Pinnularia viridis being amongst them.
For 
geological section Mr. T.
W. Bell reported.
This section was divided 
into three parties.
Those who arrived at Skipton by the earlier trains 
proceeded direct to Thorpe ; of the later arrivals some went to examine 
the limestone strata at Cracoe ; while others decided to sjk the Skipton.
Rock at Skipton and Draughton.
The boss of limestonJ^nown as the 
" Skipton Rock," is a portion of an extensive system of anticlinals 
developed in the mountain limestone of the Craven district, and forms a 
low range of hills extending from Skipton to Bolton Abbey.
The mem- 
bers who went over this district report that at Skipton and Draughton 
large portions of this anticlinal are exposed in section, and show the 
strata dipping at various angles, and in some places contorted in a most 
remarkable manner.
On the north side of the Skipton Rock, and 
presenting a bold escarpment towards it, rises a hill known as ^'Embsay 
Crag." This crag is capped by the lower portion of the millstone grit, 
and the valley between it and the "Rock " is occupied by rocks of the 
Yoredale series.
Sections of these rocks were seen on the Cracoe-road, in 
the beds of numerous small streams that traverse the district.
At Cracoe 
and Thorpe, the main mass of the upper mountain limestone is again met 
with, its position at these places probably being due to a large fault which 
extends from Malham Tarn towards Grassington.
The limestone at 
Thorpe is exceedingly fossiliferous, and some good specimens have been 
obtained.
Mr. J.
W. Davis here secured a fine specimen of Spirifera, 
having the outer portion broken away and showing the internal spiral 
arrangement beautifully preserved.
At Cracoe tlie strata exposed at the 
base of the quarries do not seem to contain many fossils, but in the 
higher beds they are fairly numerous.
The party visiting this district 
found some very good fossil specimens, also several concretionary nodules 
filled with fine pyramidal crystals of calc spar.
In the short time at the 
disposal of the sectional meeting it was impossible to determine all the 
species with accuracy, but the following list will give an indication of 
what was collected ; — Cephalopoda : Nautilus, Goniatites, and Orthoceras ; 
Gasteropoda : Pleurotomaria, Euomphalus, Belerophon, Buccineum (?) ; 
Brachiopoda : Terebratula hastata, Spirifera glabra, S.
sp.
(?) 
Productus gigantea, P.
striata, P.
semireticularis, P.
sp.
(?), Orthis 
resupinata, Rhynchonella, sp.
(?) Of Conchifera several specimens were 
found, but none sufiiciently perfect for identification.
Portions of 
encrinites were abundant, and several fossil corals were collected.
A vote 
of thanks to the chairman closed the meeting.

REGENT STREET, GLOUCESTER- 
ON THE METHODS OF MICROSCOPICAL RESEARCH 
IN USE IN THE NAPLES AQUARIUM.
SUMMARY (By GEO.
BROOK, F L.S.) or a Paper by Dr. Paul Mayer, in 
THE "MlTTHEILUXGEX A.
D. ZoOLOG.
StATIOX, ZU NeAPEL," VOL.
2, PART 1, 1880.
Dr. Dohrn's Geological station at Naples, including as it does every 
facility for dredging and studying marine fnrms, has commenced a 
new era in the study of marine biology which cannot be too closely 
imitated in this country.
The methods employed in this establish- 
ment in preserving the objects to be studied, the various processes 
by which they are stained, mounted, &c., cannot fail to be of interest 
to every working microscopist, for although the methods here 
enumerated are only mentioned in connection with marine forms, 
they are as a rule equally applicable to fresh-water organisms, insects, 
&c.
It is for this reason that I have ventured to lay before the 
readers of the Naturalist a summary of Dr. Mayer's paper.
PRESERVATIVE METHODS.
Picrosulphuric Acid.
— First in importance as a preservative 
medium, and one which is now becoming most generally used, is 
picrosulphuric acid.
Kleinenberg's formula for preparing it is as 
follows : — 
100 parts cold saturated solution of picric acid in water ; 
2 „ strong sulphuric acid.
The liquid, when filtered and diluted with three times its bulk of 
water, is ready for use.
For Arthropoda Dr. Mayer uses the acid 
undiluted.
One of its greatest advantages is that it supplants the water 
in the animal's body, as well as that adhering to its outer surface by 
a liquid which, after having done its work, allows itself to be entirely 
replaced by alcohol.
With osmic and chromic solutions, it is well 
known this is not the case.
They also produce an inorganic precipi- 
tate in the tissues of the objects which prevents proper staining 
afterwards.
With picro-sulphuric acid it is necessary to use plenty 
of the liquid, particularly for objects with a large body cavity, which 
it is necessary to preserve whole.
It penetrates with difficulty 
through thick chitine, though even in this respect it is preferable to 
other media.
With the larger objects it is indispensable to open the 
body its whole length with a pair of scissors, and by means of a

The Naturalist.
pipette to inject it full of the acid.
Time should uot be giTen for 
the blood to coagulate and fasten the organs together, nor should the 
object be allowed to remain for any length of time in a turbid liquid.
Too much stress cannot be laid on this simple rule, for in its non- 
observance lies the occasion of so many unsatisfactory results.
How 
long an object ought to remain in the acid depends greatly on its 
nature.
Usually a few hours is sufficient, but for large objects, and 
thdse containing a large per-centage of water, a longer time is neces- 
sary, and also an occasional stirring up or change of liquid.
Often, 
if left in the acid a whole day, the objects appear to sustain no 
injury.
While in chromic acid the tissues are apt to become too 
brittle unless taken out in time, in picrosulphuric acid there is a 
certain death to the cells, but no true hardening.
In cases where 
carbonate of lime, in the form of gypsum, forms a part of the animal 
structure, this would be acted on by the sulphuric acid, and there 
would be a softening rather than a hardening of the whole structure.
When the objects have remained a sufficient time in the acid, they 
should be transferred to 70 % alchohol.
As long as any colour is 
given to the alcohol it must be continually changed, for until every 
trace of picric acid has been removed the object will not stain 
properly.
This is often a tedious process, and requires long washing 
and continuous stirring up of the liquid.
Small objects may be 
conveniently placed under the microscope to see if any tinge of the 
yellow picric acid remains.
When every trace of colour has been 
dissolved out, the preservative process is complete, and the objects 
may be kept in 90 % alcohol for luither study.
Picro-sulphutic acid must not be used for animals containing 
carbonate of lime, where that is desired to be preserved.
For 
example, in Echinoderms the carbonate of lime is dissolved by the 
picrosulphuric acid, and then thrown down as crystals of gypsum in 
the tissues.
In its use with vertebrates it must always be borne in 
mind that the acid swells up the connective tissues.
Prof.
Emery 
finds this process very useful for embryos of vertebrates and for 
fishes, but they should not be allowed to remain in the acid more than 
three or four hours.
Kleinenberg has recently used creosote made 
from, beechwood tar along with the acid, to avoid the swelling-up of 
the tissues, with very lair results.
Although this method is con- 
siderably the best for preserving Crustacea as a rule, it will not do at 
all for the parasitic species.
It causes the object to swell up to such 
an extent as often to rupture the walls.
In order to avoid the 
deposition of gypsum crystals in those objects containing carbonate

of lime, hydrochloric acid or nitric acid, in place of sulphuric acid, 
has been used with good results.
The mode of preparation is as 
follows : — 
100 parts sat.
sol.
picric acid in water.
8 „ hydrochloric acid containing 25 % H CI.
or, in place of the 8 parts hydrochloric acid, 5 parts pure nitric acid 
of 45 % N2 O5 may be used.
These solutions act in most respects like 
the picro-siilphuric acid, but the picric acid is not quite so easily 
"withdrawn by alcohol.
Alcohol.
— In a certain antithesis to the working of picrosulphuric 
acid stands that of alcohol.
The latter causes in thick walled objects, 
particularly in those which are chitinous, a more or less marked 
maceration of the interior of the object, which presently begins to 
decay.
Again, strong alcohol fixes the salt of the externally adhering 
sea-water on the walls of the object, and so hinders a proper penetra- 
tion of the liquid.
Afterwards when the object is required to be 
stained, unless an aqueous solution of the staining medium is used, 
by which the precipitated sea-salt would be again dissolved, a proper 
staining of the interior cannot be obtained.
In staining with 
cochineal it appears that in consequence of the existence of sea-salt 
crystals on the outside of the object, a grey green precipitate is 
thrown down which often spreads over the whole object and makes it 
unfit for use.
This may, however, be avoided to a great extent by 
first soaking the ol ject for a few hours in acid alcohol (1-10 parts 
hydr(^chloric ai id to 100 parts of 70 % alochol).
From what has 
been said it will be seen that alcohol per se is not a desirable pre- 
servative medium, at least for objects which are intended for 
histological research.
Acid Alcohol.
— In order to avoid the maceration caused by ordinary 
alcohol Dr. Mayer has tried a slight addition of Hydrochloric or 
nitric acid to alcohol of 70 %, also to alcohol of 90 % with good 
results.
He finds the best proportion to be 3 of hydrochloric acid to 
97 of 90 % alcohol.
The object should only be allowed to remain in 
the liquid until it has become thoroughly soaked through and then 
transferred to pure 90 % alcohol.
In order to ascertain how far the 
process has gone, a little picric acid is dissolved in the liquid so that 
on subsequent washing in clean alcohol the yellow colouring matter 
shows how far the alcohol has penetrated.
In the use of acid alcohol 
164 
The Naturalist.
it must he remembered that the liquid after some time loses its 
properties and at the expense of the hjdrochloxic acid, builds up 
ether compounds.
Boiling Alcohol.
— In some cases amongst the Arthropoda it is 
almost impossible, with the ordinary methods in use, to kill as quickly 
as necessary.
In these cases Dr. Mayer has used boiling absolute 
alcohol which kills instantly, as for instance in the Tracheata.
Osmic Acid.
— Dr. Mayer's experience of the use of osmic acid is 
not very satisfactory, and he now sehlom uses it at all excepting when 
such oi'jects as hair, bristles, <&c., are to be stained to show the 
histological details.
Without doubt one of the best objects to stain 
by this means is Phronima sedentaria when every cell and nucleus 
comes out most beautifully.
According to Emery the yellow and red 
fatty pigments of fishes can be better stained by osmic acid than by 
any other means.
The great drawback to the use of osmic acid is 
that the preparations are very liable to get overstained, and thus a 
precipitate is formed which interferes with the working of the 
subsequent staining medium, for instance carmine or picro-carmiue.
There is, however, no difficulty in removing the osmic acid again 
provided the ohject be at once immersed in 70 or 90 % alcohol.
Enough crystals of common salt are shaken into the liquid to cover 
the bottom of the vessel and then with a pipette a few drops of 
hydrochloric acid are aided until by stirring the liquid it is seen that 
chlorine is being generated.
This is easily recognised by its yellow- 
green colour.
If the bleachirg solution is placed on a water ba h 
the process is considerably accelerated.
Dr. Mayer has found that in 
half-a-day he has been able to restore large Felagia, Cariniay 
lililzostoma, &c., so that practically they were as good as ever.
The 
objects then require to be kept in pure alcohol again and the liquid 
will require changing a few times to get rid of the smell of the 
chlorine.
This process of bleaching may also be used in getting rid 
of natural pigments, as for instance in the eyes 'of insects and 
Crustacea, but in these cases it is better first to cut the sections and 
afterwards to bleach them, so that the chlorine gets a better chance 
of acting on the pigments.
Chromic Acid.
— In the Zoological station at Naples, chromic acid 
is now little used for invertebrates, as it has all the disadvantages of 
osmic acid without possessing its advantages.
It is, however, 
frequently made use of, along with Kleinenberg's acid, where the 
Brook : Summary of Methods of Microscopical PtESEARCH.

tissues are req^iiired to be hardened more than the latter would do it 
alone.
Dr, Lang's Medium,.
— Dr. Lang was induced by an old paper of 
Blanchard's to work with corrosive sublimate, to which he added 
acetic acid or picrosulphuric acid.
The original prescription is as 
folio vys : — 
100 parts distilled water.
6-10 „ common salt.
5-8 acetic acid.
3-12 corrosive sublimate, 
and ultimately \ part alum.
The Planarians, for which this medium was intended, are laid oil 
their backs and freed as much as possible from water, and the mixture 
is then poured over them.
They then die fully extemled.
In half- 
an-hour they are placed in alcohol of 70 %, then in 90 %, and finally 
in 100 % alcohol, and in two days they are quite hardened.
Later Dr.
Lang has used a saturated solution of corrosive sublimate in picro- 
sulphuric acid with 5 % acetic acid added ; or simply a saturated 
solution of corrosive sublimate in water.
In cases where it is difficult 
to kill the object suBiciently quickly, the liquid must be used boiling.
According to the researches of Lang and others, this medium is very 
useful for liydroids.
corals, small Cumopliores, some Gephyrea and 
Balanoglossiis^ Echinoderms, Sagitta, many annelids, and for Rhobdo- 
coda.
Dendrocoela should only be preserved by this method when 
wanted for histological purposes.
To the foregoing may be added 
C^sfoda, Trematoda, and larvse of Turhellaria.
As a rule Planarians 
killed by this method should not remain more than a few days in 
alcohol, as they become very brittle.
It is better to stain them at 
once and imbed in paraffine ready for section cutting, where they may 
remain for a considerable time.
Wi'h the Arthropoda Dr. Mayer has 
not been able to obtain good results by this method.
Prof.
MetlceVs Medium.
— This consists of a solution of one part each 
of platinum chloride, and chromic acid in 800 parts of water.
Dr.
Eisig has obtained very good results by this method with annelids, 
and thinks that as a rule four to six hours is a sufficient time for the 
objects to remain in the medium.
After further treatment with 
alcohol, the objects stain splendidly.

This family seems to be more neglected than any other, and we 
believe that the chief reason is because there are few of this group 
of plants to be found near our large smoky towns, where most of our 
botanists reside.
There is plenty of good work to be yet done in 
Yorkshire, in this family, therefore let us hope that something may 
be d me this year by those members who may have opportunity.

— I wish to report the 
finding of the above interesting moss in Miller's Dale, on shaded lime- 
stone rocks.
This is, I believe, the first time its occurrence in Derby- 
shire has been noticed.

Migratory Arrivals.
— Ray's wagtail I first saw on April 17th, in the 
E-yburne Valley, the cuckoo on the 30th, just three weeks later than the 
first swallow.

Spring Migrants.
— March 7th, a flock of green plovers, in their 
northern migration ; March 14th, a flock of green plovers ; April 2nd, 
wheatear at Dalton ; April 15th, willow-warbler.
Penny Spring Wood.
April 24th, a friend told me he had seen a woodcock in Penny Spring, 
which I very much doubted.
But the following morning I went to the 
place and found its droppings, though I did not see the bird ; I went again 
the following morning, and found another place where it had been, but 
again had not the pleasure of seeing the bird.
April 28th, I had a walk 
to Sowerby Bridge, and on my way saw the following spring migrants : — 
wheatear, Ainley Top ; willow warbler, Elland Wood, plentiful ; wood- 
warbler, two pairs ; chiflchaff ; pied-flycatcher, at the Tunnel End ; also 
the redstart and tree-jjipit, at Calder Hebble ; swallows were j)lentiful ; 
also martins and sand-martins.
I then took the Canal Bank, and saw 
the pied wagtail, plentiful ; also several pairs of Ray's wagtail.
May 1st, 
I had the pleasure of hearing the cuckoo, at Broken Cross and Mellor 
Wood.
May 2nd, I saw several pairs of whinchats ; also spotted 
flycatcher, in Penny Spring Wood.
May 14th, I heard the landrail, top 
of Dalton and near Roundwood, one in Pontey's Gardens, and one at 
Tinderley, Almondbury.
May 17, grasshopper warbler at Dalton Lees, 
sedge warbler, Pontey's Gardens ; blackcap warbler and garden warbler, 
Roundwood ; also lesser redpoll in Pontey's Gardens.

Ornithological Notes, Leeds — In this district the present spring 
has been very backward, both for the breeding of our resident birds, and 
the arrival of spring migrants.
The ringdove, song thrush, and missel 
thrush, which are amongst our earliest breeders, had not eggs until the 
fourth week in April, whereas during the past five years, we have seen 
eggs before the end of March.
During the month of April, the weather 
was fine, but exceedingly cold, and this may account for the spring 
migrants not being noticed so early as usual, as they do not sing for some 
170 
The Naturalist.
days after their arrival if the weather is cold and unfavourable.
On April 
the 16th, the willow wren, chiffchaff, and swallow had arrived.
April 
18th, I saw a nest of the carrion crow containing six eggs, at Ryther.
April 23rd, magpie had eggs, the wheatear, grasshopper warbler, and 
sand martin were to be seen and heard at Adel.
April 30th, I heard the 
cuckoo at Roundhay.
May 1st, yellow wagtail at Roundhay.
May 2nd, 
my brother saw five black-headed gulls at Fewston Reservoir, and also a 
pair of common sandpipers at Leathley, The cuckoo had also arrived in 
Wharf edale.
May 7th, one single swift in company with sand-martins at 
Strensall Common ; also heard the whitethroat and landrail near York.
May 8th, heard the landrail near Leeds.
May 14th, ring-ouzels were 
plentiful on Rombalds Moor ; they had not yet begun to nest.
Up to the 
present date I have not seen a single house-martin.
They are becoming 
more scarce every year in this district.
— Walter Raine, Leeds, 
May 17th.
Jack Snipe's Nest at Barkisland.
— A jack snipe's nest was taken 
on Ringstone Edge, Barkisland, in July, 1879 ; it contained four eggs of 
the normal type, and two days after the parent bird was shot.
The 
nest, eggs, and bird are now in the possession of Mr. Farrar Lumb, 
Westgate, Elland.
I think the above is proof positive of the nesting of 
the jack snipe in Britain.
— C.
C. Hanson.
The Cuckoo.
— I had not intended taking any notice of your Netherton 
correspondent, with regard to the cuckoo, on March 12th.
But one 
mistake generally leads others astray, for in this month's Naturalist I see 
that Mr. Bunker gives the 18th of March, at Goole.
Now, in all my 
long experience with the cuckoo, I never saw it before the end of March, 
in forward springs.
It is a soft-billed bird, and feeds on insects and 
larvae, and could not have subsisted so far north, in a spring like this.
It never begins to sing until the leaves of the sycamore and.
larch trees 
begin to expand.
1 have looked in all the likely places which it haunts, 
and did not see it before the first of May.
— James Varley, Almondbury 
Bank, Huddersfield, May 9th.
Osprey {Pandion haliceetus) near Huddersfield.— I have had this 
bird brought in to preserve.
It was killed on Goodbent Moors, by 
Robert Hogg, gamekeeper for Messrs.
Seth Senior and Sons, Shepley, 
on May 8th, at eight o'clock p.m. It measured 21in.
from beak to tail- 
end, and 5ft.
expanse of wings; weight, 21bs.

It is a mature 
male bird, and its crop contained the remains of a fish.

Dunlins, &c., at Strensall Common.— On the 7th of May my 
brother and I visited Strensall Common, where we came across a small 
flock of dunlins, which were very tam.e, and allowed us to creep within 
thirty yards before taking flight, and then only flew to the margin of an 
Short Notes and Queries.
171 
adjoining lagoon, where, with the aid of a field glass, we were able to see 
them very distinctly.
This is an unusual place for these birds at this 
time of the year, though they are said to breed on most of our Yorkshire 
moors.
I should be glad to hear of any authentic instance of this bird 
breeding in Yorkshire.
I visit the home of the curlew and golden plover 
regularly during the spring and summer, but still I have never caught 
sight of the little dunlin.
We also saw at Strensall a very large flock of 
pied wagtails, and a pair of fine herons.
— Walter Raine, Leeds, 
May 16th.
Pied Flycatcher at Bingley.
— Whilst sauntering through Bingley 
Wood on the 14th inst., my brother and I had the gratification of seeing, 
for the first time in this locality, that local and beautiful bird the pied fly- 
catcher.
Since the above date I have been several times for the purpose 
of ascertaining whether it was breeding, or merely migratory, as I had 
not seen the female bird until to-day.
This morning, however, after 
waiting some time, I observed the female with some building material in 
her mouth, which she took at last to her nest, which was placed in a hole 
of the trunk of a fine beech tree.
Immediately alter the flycatcher had 
been to its nest I saw a blue-tit enter, possibly in search of a breeding 
place ; and my only fear now is that it will dispossess the rightful owners, 
as its pugnacity is only equalled by its impudence — E.

Vanessa Antiopa in Wharfedale.
— On the 11th inst.
my brother 
chased a V.
Antiojoa for a considerable distance along the highway near 
Barden Tower, in Wharfedale.
A friend of his, who was with him, 
first started it, and called out, "A Camberwell beauty." My brother 
says he could not possibly mistake it for any other butterfly.

Acronyda alni in my breeding cage.
It is now on my setting board.

Ejlling Insects with Ammonia.
— A method of killing lepidoptera 
and other insects more frequently used in the southern than our counties, 
is by means of ammonia.
I first saw it used by Mr. W.
H. Tugwell, of 
Greenwich, when collecting with him in Abbots' Wood, in Sussex, about 
five years ago.
Three or four ounces of carbonate of ammonia (which 
may be bought for a few pence, and will last a whole season through), are 
placed at the bottom of a wide mouthed jar (glass is best), big enough to 
hold fifty or sixty ordinary chip boxes, and having a close-fitting cork or 
stopper.
Into this jar the chip boxes are emptied just as they are, 
without even removing the lids at all, on coming in from a collecting 
excursion, and then left alone until next morning.
The insects inside 
the boxes will then be found to be in perfect order, and in splendid 
172 
The Naturalist.
condition for setting ; better even than when just killed by the ordinary 
methods.
I experienced one objection to this plan, which, however, does 
not appear to have been shared by others, viz.
: that the ammonia in the 
bodies of the insects sometimes affects the pins in such a way that with 
very little pressure they break off ; and this being as likely to occur in a 
valuable specimen as in any other, is apt to be very annoying.
It is 
necessary also to have tAvo sets of chip boxes, as the ammonia fames cling 
to them for some hours.

Roebuck's subject was " The Extinct Animals of Yorkshire." After 
pointing out from a map several forest districts which formerly existed in 
this county, he proceeded to refer to some of the extinct wild animals 
which inhabited the forests, and in speaking of the haunts of these 
animals Mr. Roebuck introduced numerous old legends having 
reference to the animals he mentioned, and said that the last wolf and 
wild boar in Yorkshire were said to have been killed by John O'Gaunt, 
at Rothwell.
Wolves were formerly rather plentiful at WooUey, and wild 
boars at Chevet, and the latter animals were frequently served up as

its Compounds." Mr. George Parkin presided.
The lecturer com- 
menced by alluding to the wide difiusion of this element through nature.
Accepting the nebular hypothesis as the most plausible theory of the 
world's origin, he described the probable condition in which carbon must 
have existed at that period.
After referring to the various forms in 
which carbon is found to exist on the earth's surface, he entered into a 
brief explanation of the laws of chemical combination, showing how they 
affected the element of carbon He then rapidly reviewed many of its 
combinations, which he classified under various heads.
The concluding 
part of the lecture was occupied with a notice of the important work 
accomplished by carbon in the vegetable and animal kingdoms.
The 
lecture was illustrated by various experiments, conducted by the 
lecturer's son, Mr. J.
H. Chaplin.
Mr. Wrigglesworth reported the 
following spring migrants.
Swift, at Fenay Bridge, May 1st ; sand- 
martin, at Clayton West, May 2nd ; house-martin, at Bretton West, 
May 2nd ; landrail, at Thornes, May 2nd.— E.B.W.
Yorkshire Naturalists' Union.
— The second excursion of the year 
was made on Saturday, 14th May, to the Rivelin Valley, with Sheffield as 
a rendezvous and meeting-place.
Admirable arrangements having been 
made by Mr. J.
C. Burrell, the local secretary (who is also the secretary 
of the Sheffield Naturalists' Club), two parties started in the forenoon for 
the exploration of the Rivelin Valley by two separate routes.
One — a 
botanical party — was led by Mr. A.
Carr ; the other — geological — by Mr.
J. A.
Blaydes.
Such of the Sheffield members as were able only to 
spare a half-day, drove in the afternoon to Cliffe Rocher, or "Little 
Matlock." The meetings were all held at the King's Head Hotel, 
Sheffield.
In the absence of the president and vice-presidents, Mr.
Alfred H.Allen, F.I.C, &c , president of the Sheffield Naturalists' 
Club, was called to the chair.
The roll-call showed that representatives 
were present from Barnsley, Goole, Holmfirth, Leeds (Concholgical 
Society, Geological Association, and Naturalists' Club), Rastrick-cum- 
Brighouse, Sheffield, and Wakefield.
The individual attendance, mostly 
Sheffield members, was about 70 or 80.
The list of new subscribers 
included Messrs.
Geo Foster and Wm. Foster of Market Weighton, Mr.
A. Bottomley of Keighley, Mr. T.
E. Vasey of Harrogate, Mr. C, J.

Thanks were voted, also for 
donations to the library, of which the list included 26 titles.
A 
hearty vote of thanks was then passed to the local secretary, to the

leaders of parties for their assistance, and to the Sheffield Naturalists*" 
Club for defraying the additional cost of publishing a four-page instead 
of a one-page circular.
The Sectional reports were then taken.
In the 
absence of the officers of the Conch ological section, Mr. W.
Denison 
Roebuck reported that very few shells had been obtained, the weather 
and geological character of the locality being both unfavourable.
For the 
Entomological section Mr. E.
B. Wrigglesworth (secretary) reported.

The officers of the 
Botanical section being absent, Mr. A.
Carr of Sheffield enumerated 
the mosses found (46), including Sphagnum pluraosum, S.
con- 
tortum, S.
cynibifoli'.im, var.
squarrosulum, Aulacoraniimi androgynura, 
Fontinalis squamosa, Pterygophyllum lacens, Hyocomium flagellare, and

The most uncommon hepatics (i8) noted were 
Asterella hemisphserica, Bazzania trilobata, Blepharozia ciliaris, Mylia 
Taylori, Nardia emarginata, Aneura pinguis, and Aneura sinuata.
No 
lichens, fungi, nor algce were reported.
Mr. Councillor F.
Brittain, of 
Sheffield, then followed, with interesting observations on the phanerogamic 
plants noted, which included Cardamine amara, Hjqoericum elodes, Ulex

Polypodium Dryopteris, and Equisetum maximum, Mr. Brittain also 
•gave some remarks on the flora of the district, and regretted the Union 
had not chosen a more productive locality.
Mr. B.
Holgate, F.G.S., 
of Leeds, secretary of the Geological section, reported.
In the 
•absence of the officers of the Vertebrate section, Mr. Thos.
Lister of 
Barnsley reported birds in the Rivelin Valley and the wooded glens of 
Wyoming and PJbbleden : — Migrants — all of the swallow tribe, also, 
the cuckoo, sand-piper, white-throat, willow and wocd warblers, tree- 
pipit, redstart, sedge- warbler, whinchat, corn-crake, garden-warbler j 
amongst the residents were magpie, missel thrush, blackbird, wren, 
meadow pipit, pied wagtail, grey and green linnets, and lesser redpoll, 
bullfinch, yellow and corn bunting, chaffinch, starling, ring-dove, marsh 
tit— twenty residents.
The curator reported the short-eared owl, May 
12th, and the rough-legged buzzard, Sept.

THE ISLAND OF EODEIGUES, AND ITS FAUNA, 
AS THEY "WERE, AND AS THEY ARE.* 
By the Rev. H.
H. Slatek, B.A., F.Z.S., &c., 
President Vertebrate Section, Yorkshire Naturalists' Union ; late Naturalist to 
H.M. Transit of Yenus Expedition to Rodrigues, 1874, &c., &c., &c.
The Island of Rodrigues, which is to form the subject of the following 
observations is, geographically speaking, very insignificant ; it is 
about twelve miles long and six in greatest breadth.
It is situated out 
by itself in the middle of the Indian Ocean, the nearest land being the 
Island of Mauritius, distant a little more than SOO miles to the 
W S W.
Its latitude is about 20° S., and its longitude 65° E.
Having said so much as to its position, I must next attempt to give 
some idea of its general appearance.
It is, from the sea especially, 
a charming island, though less so than Mauritius, which goes by the 
poetical name of " The star and key of the Indian Ocean." Rodrigues 
is anything but monotonous, there being hardly an inch of level ground 
in it.
The highest hills are in the centre of the island, the chief one 
about 1,300 feet above sea level, and several others coming near this 
height.
From these central peaks many small streams run down to 
the sea, mostly through deep ravines, often well-wooded.
These 
ravines have frequently almost precipitous sides, which makes an 
inland journey a very considerable affair, as to make five miles as the 
crow flies (though the crow doesn't fly in Rodrigues at all), you may 
have to walk a dozen of the very roughest, with vegetation in some 
places above your knees.
People consequently don't travel much by 
land, but go round the coast in a pirogue (or canoe) to the nearest 
point to where they want to get.
In many parts, owing, I believe, to the wanton destruction of the 
woods by fire, and otherwise, the country looks bare and desolate, but 
in others it is well wooded.
The woods, too, have a very picturesque 
appearance, especially to an English eye, as palms of various kinds are 
a great feature in them.
The island is surrounded by coral reefs, which, in some places, are 
three miles from the shore, and in others only as many hundred yards.
Within the reefs there is shallow water, in which little islands are 
scattered here and there.
N. S., Vol. vi.— July, 1881.
* Read before the Leeds Naturalists' Club and Scientific Association, May 31st, 1881.

The Naturalist.
The climate, considering that the island is within the Tropics, is a 
pleasant one, and the temperature averages about 78*^ all the year 
through.
During the fine season, which lasts from May till October, 
the weather is fine and dry, and pleasant enough.
From the middle 
of November till the end of April it is much hotter, and often 
uncomfortably warm.
From December to April one may chance to 
come in for a cyclone, or hurricane — a sufiiciently unpleasant 
experience — which I had the good fortune to be spared.
To give 
some idea, however, of what a hurricane can do when it tries, I will 
mention a few of the effects produced by the great cyclone of 1868 in 
the sister island of Mauritius.
" Coming events " are popularly supposed to " cast their shadows 
before them," and this event was no exception.
For ten days 
previously the weather was intensely oppressive, and the heat scorching, 
the atmosphere, meanwhile, being so full of electricity as to produce 
great and continual discomfort ; the barometer fell by fits and starts, 
and the wind blew in gusts from all points of the compass alternately, 
~a sure precursor of a cyclone.
Then the storm burst.
The tempest raged furiously for three days, 
and on the 13th of March, when it ceased, the island was devastated.
About ninety persons were killed, mostly by falling houses.
Of seventy 
ships in the harbour of Port Louis, many had been torn from their 
moorings and dashed against others, or stranded.
Many of these 
were afterwards condemned with their cargoes, — a loss of several 
hundred thousand pounds.
The iron railway viaduct over Grand River was dismantled.
Two 
of the enormous girders, each 200 feet in length, and more than 300 
tons in weight, were torn bodily from off their piers and dropped into 
the river.
Imagine, if you can, the terrific force of a wind which 
could do this.
The Tay Bridge accident is far short of this, when the 
bridge, a tall and rather flimsy erection, gave way owing to lateral 
pressure and the weakness of the piers.
Here the piers stood, but the 
bridge was torn off and flung down.
Over 23,000 dwelling-houses, 
mostly coolies' huts, were blown down or carried away, and about as 
many more damaged.
One large wooded house, near Port Louis, was 
turned upside down, and left standing on its roof.
Sixty-five bridges, 
many of stone, were destroyed, and the havoc among trees and cattle 
was enormous.
When we went to the East, we were anxious to see all that could be 
seen, but we all " drew the line " at cyclones.
Slater : Rodrigues, and its Fauna.

To return to Rodrigues.
The geology of tlie island, which 
previously to our visit in 1874, was supposed to be of granite, was 
found to be less interesting than was expected.
The island consists 
of a large pile of that kind of lava which geologists call Dolerite, of 
which the numerous flows could be almost counted by studying the 
sides of the water-courses.
In some parts of the island there were 
line cliffs of basalt, in the form of columns packed close together, 
looking like rows of vast organ pipes, and very similar in appearance, 
though upon a larger scale, to those which have made our Island of 
Staffa so famous.
No minerals were to be found of any beauty, 
though Arragonite and Zeolites occurred sparingly.
The only exception to the general volcanic structure of the island 
lies in some patches of coralline limestone, found only in the western 
end of the island.
These consist of large beds, as much as a mile in 
diameter, and fifty feet or more in depth, of marine coral, slightly 
altered by atmospheric agency, upheaved by the basalt, and lying upon 
it.
In these patches are found caves, which contain the bones and 
other remains of the extinct fauna of the island, which it was my 
special province, on the Transit Expedition, to investigate.
Rodrigues has no history to speak of.
In 1761 it was the scene of 
another Transit of Venus expedition — a French one, under the Abbe 
Pingre, of which the results are well known to astronomers.
Next, in 1806, the Indian Government decided upon taking from 
the French, with whom, as you know, we were then at war, the islands 
of Mauritius (then called Isle de France) and Bourbon (or Reunion).
As a preliminary step they occupied Rodrigues with a large body of 
troops and Sepoys, and great stores.
After several unsuccessful 
attempts Mauritius and Bourbon were at length taken in 1810, and 
Rodrigues abandoned.
Connected with this expedition there is a circumstance, which I 
may mention, of considerable interest.
There was at the time in 
Mauritius a remarkable French Creole (M.
Fillifay), who had the 
power of discerning objects at a vast distance out at sea, long before 
they were visible to anyone else.
And he came to the French 
Governor, in 1810, and told him he had seen the ships assembling at 
Rodrigues, 300 miles distant, for the invasion of Mauritius.
For this 
piece of news it is supposed that he was imprisoned for raising false 
alarms.
He was afterwards employed regularly at the Port Office to 
give notice of ships approaching.
On one occasion he declared that 
he saw two ships joined together, and shortly afterwards a four-masted 
American schooner made its appearance, the first four-masted vessel

that had visited Mauritius.
On another he described an East- 
Indiaman dismasted 400 miles off, and said afterwards that he could 
see her rigging up jury-masts, and steering for Port Louis, which was 
the case.
He used to stand on a hill on the coast at dawn, and after surveying 
with the naked eye, not the horizon, but the sky, he used to go and 
describe what he had seen.
Objects appeared to him upside down, as 
as they do under the microscope.
Though he tried his powers in 
Europe, and even in Bourbon, he could only exercise his uncommon 
faculty in Mauritius, a circumstance probably due to the extreme 
rarity of the atmosphere of that island.
After the conclusion of the French war in 1810 — to return once 
to Eodrigues — nothing of interest occurred there till 1874, when the 
Transit of Venus expedition, to which I had the honour to be 
attached, visited the island.
The trade of Eodrigues has seen better days.
Formerly planters 
lived there, and cultivated sugar-cane, indigo, vanilla, and coffee ; but 
the cyclones were so destructive to the crops that they gave it up, and 
the only traces of their occupation are found in the orange and coffee- 
bushes and indigo plants, and so on, now growing wild.
There are 
now only two exports — dried fish, caught round the island, and cattle, 
which are bred there, and which live to the number of many thousands 
in a half-wild state all over it.
We were advised to carry a few ball 
cartridges w^hen w-andering over the island, in case the cattle were 
aggressive, as I believe they are occasionally.
The principal imports, 
as far as I know, are rice and rum.
The rice, with patates, or sweet 
potatoes, and dried fish, forms the staple food of the natives ; and as 
for the rum, they consume as much as they can get hold of.
The natives, or Creoles, are a mixed race ; the principal element in 
the breed is Malagash, or Madagascar negro.
Then they have a touch 
of Hindoo, and a touch of French blood ; and they have inherited, I 
think, the vices of all these three races, and have a few of their own 
besides.
They may, of course, have inherited all the virtues of the 
three nations as well, but I must say they don't quite give you that 
idea.
They are dishonest, dirty, revengeful, and very idle.
The most 
energetic of the natives are fishermen ; they catch fish in long nets, 
treat it like Finnan haddocks, and dry it on the rocks in the sun, 
after which it is sent to Mauritius, tied up in large bundles.
Others 
plant sweet potatoes and a little tobacco, and pass the rest of their 
time as happy, idle loafers.
They all carry knives, and would be very 
unpleasant neighbours if they had more courage.
One drew a knife,

doubtless with sinister intentions, upon the magistrate whilst we were 
there, when his back was turned.
Fortunately the magistrate heard 
it, and turned round quickly, got his customer up into a corner, and 
treated him to a little " science " ; but he quite expected to get a 
knife into his back some day.
This is the kind of gentry the natives 
of Rodrigues are.
I would willingly give them a better character if I 
could, though I do not know whether they would like it even if I did, 
and they heard of it.
The island is governed by a police-magistrate appointed by the 
Mauritius Government.
Captain Bell was the magistrate when we 
were there — a gentleman for whose kindness the naturalists were very 
grateful.
Amongst other things he gave us up his official residence 
as our head-quarters.
His staff consists of a white sergeant and a 
corporal, and several policemen who are Mauritius Creoles.
In addition 
to the magistrate and his family, the sergeant of police, an Italian 
storekeeper, and a French priest form the whole white population ; 
the natives, I believe, are about 1,500 in number.

LEPIDOPTERA COLLECTING IN THE NEW FOREST, 
HAMPSHIRE.* 
By Samuel James Capper.
My first visit to the New Forest, Hampshire, for the purpose of 
collecting lepidoptera, was in the month of June (viz., from the 5th 
to the 28th), 1869, when I was accompanied by my friend Mr. Isaac 
Cooke.
We at first proposed locating at Lyndhurst, then and still 
celebrated as a most excellent central position for an entomologist's 
head quarters.
We were diverted from Lyndhurst by the advice of 
Mr. Benjamin Cooke, who had a few years previously paid a most 
successful visit to Brockenhurst, which he emphatically pronounced 
the better situation.
After considerable experience in collecting in the neighbourhoods of 
each village, I am inclined to endorse Mr. Cooke's opinion, although 
it is exceedingly difiicult to decide between two such splendid 
positions, each being surrounded with the finest possible country for the 
entomologist, and swarming with lepidoptera.
The accommodation at 
Brockenhurst is not so good as at Lyndhurst, but this, to my mind, is 
compensated for by its being less frequented, and consequently more

private.
It was with very happy anticipations we started from 
Liverpool for our three weeks' holiday.
Some time before arriving at 
Brockenhurst we gazed with delight on the beauties of the Forest on 
each side of the railway as we rushed through it.
On arriving at 
Brockenhurst we inquired for the best hotel, and were directed to a 
small country inn, the " Rose and Crown," the hostess of which 
seemed not a little perplexed as to how she should provide for such an 
unusual influx of visitors.
We commenced operations early the following morning.
We had 
plenty of choice as to collecting ground.
There was the extensive 
Forest in every direction, also numerous enclosures, besides the open 
commons, &c.
We selected for our morning's explorations " The 
Park Enclosure," which we had hardly entered when my companion 
called me to see what he thought was a fine specimen of B.
rohoraria, 
settled on one of the trees ; this proved, however, to be consortaria^ 
nevertheless a great prize.
Those present who knew the delight of 
seeing T.
biundularia sitting on the trees in Delamere Forest can 
understand our pleasure in capturing this grand moth.
We, of course, 
worked very hard after this discovery, examining thousands of trees, 
and were successful in securing a fair number of specimens.
In 
addition to these, on arriving home after our morning's labour we 
found our boxes filled with hosts of butterflies, and amongst the moths 
Crepuscularia, Ruhricollis, Dolabraria^ Pimciulaia, BarbaLis^ &c.
The difficulty, in having so many excellent collecting places to 
choose from, was day by day to decide which to select, each planta- 
tion, heath, and common swarming with its own peculiarities.
The 
profusion of butterflies everywhere particularly surprised us, making 
collecting so different to that in the North of England.
During our stay at Brockenhurst we took the following butterflies : 
CratcBgi (a few), Sinapis, Cardamines, Sibylla, Selene^ EupJirosytie, 
Lucina, Rubi, Argiolm, Alsus^ Alveolus^ Agestis, Tages^ Sylvanus, 
&c.
We a,lso spent one day in the Isle of Wight, filling our boxes 
with M.
Cinxia and L.
Adonis.
The weather was not favourable for 
collecting, being cold and wet.
We sugared almost every night, but 
without much success.
The species we met with were, with few 
exceptions, most abundant.
Butterflies literally swarmed, the 
difficulty being not how to fill our boxes, but what to select.
An 
enumeration of our captures may be interesting.
In addition to the 
butterflies mentioned, we took Fuciformis, Bombyliformis, Filipendula, 
Complam^ Quadra^ Rubricollis, JacobecB, Russula, Fillica, Mendica^ 
Quercm, Coryliy Advenaria, Fasciaria, Maculata, Margaritaia^ Bolabraria,

Blanda^ Alsines, Fimbria, Bella,, Nebulosa, jEnea, and hosts of common 
NoctucB.
Although Of'ion has since been taken plentifully, it was then 
considered a great rarity.
One of our first excursions was to Lyndhurst, a distance of some 
four or five miles, the coach road being right through the Forest, and 
consequently we had grand collecting ground all the way.
We often 
repeated this walk, taking one side of the road on our way thither, and 
the other on our return.
On our first visit to Lyndhurst we called 
upon a dealer and made some purchases.
Amongst other insects, I 
thought myself fortunate in securing a poor specimen of Orio)/ for four 
shillings.
That same evening, whilst sugaring, a young man (about 
20), came and introduced himself to us, stating that a year or two 
before, he had as.sisted a collector of lepidoptera, and had obtained a 
considerable knowledge as to localities, &c., and kindly offered to give 
us all the information in his power.
This young man — Walter Oliver 
— proved a great acquisition, and attended us in most of our excursions, 
and on a subsequent visit to the Forest the following summer, I 
engaged his services for the whole of the time I spent there.
We told 
him of our visit to Lyndhurst, and of our purchase of Or Ion. He said 
the collector he had been with offered to give him one shilling for all 
the Orion he would send him, and he sent him a hundred.
He said 
he would take us to the locality, which was some five or six miles 
away.
We visited it the following evening, but were only successful 
in securing one specimen ; indeed I have never been fortunate in 
taking this lovely insect in quantities.
Oliver stated that very few collectors had visited Brockenhurst, but 
that one old fellow, a dealer, had frequently spent the summer there.
He told us many amusing anecdotes about him.
" Old T " (as he was 
called) and his wife appear to have been extraordinary characters.
They were most secretive as to the localities, &c.
It is said they dis- 
covered some beetle there — a great rarity — and from one tree alone 
they obtained sufficient specimens to produce them £60.
From our little inn to the Forest we had to cross over a common on 
which the village lads assembled for cricket and other games.
Almost 
186 
The NA.TURALI8T.
whenever we passed, butterfly nets in hand, these youths used to shout 
after us, " Oh !
it's only a flopper." We were much perplexed as to 
what could be the meaning of this, until Walter explained that " Old 
T " used to offer the village lads and lasses one penny for each 
insect they brought to his house, provided it was of any use to him.
He supplied them with pill boxes, and gave directions that they should 
not injure the specimen.
When they brought their captures to his 
house, he was in the habit of opening the boxes in his parlour, 
emptying the contents into the room, and with the exclamation " Oh I 
it's only a flopper," dismissing the children minus their pennies.
After the disappointed youngsters had departed, " Old T " was to be 
seen, net in hand, capturing what he had pronounced " a worthless 
flopper." The value of insects was then much greater than at present, 
and it is said " Old T " would have reaped a golden harvest if both 
he and his wife had been faithful members of a temperance society.
Unfortunately they were not so, and very curious stories were in 
circulation about them.
On the suggestion of Oliver we spent one day at Ringwood, visiting 
Parley Heath, the celebrated U.
cribnim locality.
We had to walk 
about four miles to our hunting ground ; then, having provided 
ourselves with small branches of trees, we commenced sweeping the 
heath and capturing the moths as they rose.
There is considerable 
excitement attending this operation ; sometimes we swept for hours 
without any success, at other times we captured several specimens in 
a few minutes.
We were quite satisfied with our day's work, returning 
to Brockenhurst with some twenty or thirty specimens.
Parley Heath 
is almost the only locality in England for E.
cridrum, and there is 
great excitement in securing such a rarity.
A. caliginosa is hunted for 
much in the same way as is cribrum.
It frequents one or two rides in 
one or two woods, which have to be swept in the same way, as, like 
cribrum, caliginosa is very sluggish in its habits, at any rate in the 
daytime.
We sugared almost every night, but without much success.
This we attributed to the inclement weather.
My second visit to Brockenhurst was in company with my lamented 
friend Mr. Alfred Owen, from the 15th to 22nd April, 1870.
The 
weather was very fine, and we took the following species: — Rhamni 
and PolycJiloros, hybernated specimens, the former very plentiful ; 
Cardami7ies, Slnapis, jEgeria, Argiolus, Rubi, Ridens, Gothica, Instabilis, 
Populi, Stabilis, Gracilis, Mimosa, Cruda, Lithoriza, Illunaria, Crepus- 
cularia, Pictaria, Multistrigaria, Irriguata, Lobulata^ Badiata, j^sculariuy 
Adustata, Darivata, &c.

187 
The same STimmer I engaged the services of Walter Oliver as a 
companion for a fortnight, commencing the 11th July.
We had a 
glorious time of it, working night and day.
When I mention that I 
frequently worked eighteen hours a day, either capturing or pinning 
out my trophies, you will give me credit for some industry.
We 
usually commenced our excursions at say ten o'clock in the morning, 
returning home at six or seven o'clock, and after a hasty dinner-tea, 
started for the night's sugaring.
Nothing can describe the profusion of butterflies, Sibylla, Papliia, 
Adippe, Aglala, &c., swarming.
We took a considerable number of 
Valezina, hardly troubling ourselves with the others.
This was one of the celebrated seasons for Sponsa and Promism.
These beautiful insects are taken every year in the Forest, but some 
years much more abundantly than others.
In the years 1870-71 they 
were in the greatest profusion.
There is great excitement in their 
capture.
The sugar ought to be applied quite early in the evening, as 
the moths come to it long before it is dark.
It was usual to sugar a 
considerable area, and the trees some distance apart, and we had 
positively to run over our sugaring ground.
Activity in all ways is a 
necessity, as the moths are extremely coy, and do not generally settle 
on the sugar, but are very restless and easily alarmed.
To take them 
in a net and immediately chloroform them we found the most success- 
ful way of securing them, but unless this is done most expeditiously 
they are sure to injure themselves, exhibiting a bald head.
I never 
experienced such a season for sugaring ; our trees were covered with 
hosts of Noctua ; Turca and Pi/ramidea so numerous that we had to 
brush them away in capturing more valuable game.
Until accustomed to it, sugaring in a large forest — or indeed any- 
where — in the middle of the night is rather a weird-like occupation.
Examining the sugar for the Catocalaswas, lively enough, as we used to 
hunt in couples — one netting whilst the other held the lantern ; but 
frequently we sugared our own particular trees, which we then 
examined, fixing a certain place to meet one another.
The owls of the 
forest did not cheer our spirits, as they used to hoot most horribly.
A brother of mine from Southampton came over for a day's mothing 
with us, and expressed a desire to see how we sugared.
We fitted him 
up with a lantern, gave him a ride in a wood to sugar and examine, 
telling him to meet us at a certain time.
He had quite enough of it, 
and said, when we met, that he had never passed a more horridly 
lonely night in his life, and should prefer company on the next round- 
This reminds me of an adventure that happened to a brother entomo- 
188 
The Natuealist.
legist, who related it to me.
Together with a friend they had been 
sugaring some trees in a wood some miles from human habitation.
It 
was getting dark, but not sufficiently so to light their lanterns and 
examine the sugar.
A smoke was suggested, and for this purpose they 
proposed to adjourn to a small log hut.
The companion of my friend, 
in pushing open a rude door, suddenly drew back, saying somebody 
was hanging in the hut.
They struck a light, and much to their 
horror discovered the body of a woman hanging from the roof.
She 
was perfectly dead.
They felt themselves in a dreadful position, but 
wisely concluded to at once make for a police-office, some miles off, 
and state what had happened.
The result of a coroner's inquest, 
which of course they had to attend, elicited the facts that the woman 
was a kind of travelling pedlar, who was last seen at a public-house 
about a mile off.
It was concluded that she had entered this hut and 
committed suicide.
Nothing so terrible happened to ourselves, but to 
a great extent I can sympathise with my brother, and always preferred 
company on the rounds.
Unfortunately I have not a complete record of our captures during 
this visit.
Most of the insects mentioned as taken in June the year 
before were still 'out, and Sponsa, Promissa, Aureola, Miniatay 
Momcha, Dipsacea, Fmcula, and hosts of To?
trices and TinecB may be 
added to the list.
Sufficient has been said, however, I think, as to 
the profusion of lepidoptera to be collected in the neighbourhood of 
Brockenhurst, to make our younger members long to pay it a visit ; 
should this be the case, I would say by all means do so, and I only 
hope they will derive as much pleasure as myself, and in after years 
be able as I am now to recall the weeks passed there as amongst the 
happiest in their memory.

A Plague of Heliophohus popularis.
— A correspondent at Clitheroe 
"writes : — " Great commotion prevails in Clitheroe and the towns sur- 
rounding the famous Pendle Hill, in consequence of an extraordinary 
phenomenon.
The cause of the excitement is the arrival of a huge 
quantity of insects which occupy the ground from Wiswell to Mearley, 
near Pendle Hill, a distance of about three miles.
They travel together 
in thousands at a good speed, and devastate the land over which they 
pass to an alarming extent.
The inmates of a roadside inn are kept 
continually at work brushing them out of the house.
The road is almost 
black with the insects, which are of a strange kind, being about an inch 
long and of a dark colour.
Hundreds of persons are continually going to 
view them, and numbers of the insects are exhibited in the shop 
windows." Through the kindness of Pev. Edwd.
Boden, of Clitheroe, 
we have received two specimens of the insect referred to above, which 
are evidently the larvse of Htliophohus popularis.
Their occurrence in 
such numbers is most extraordinary, and we should think quite unprece- 
dented in this country.
Another species similar in habit, Charceas 
graminis, often causes great destruction in Sweden, laying waste the 
meadows and annihilating the hay crops ; and several occurrences of 
almost equal destructiveness by this insect in our own country are also on 
record.
We should not be surprised if many, probably most, of these 
Clitheroe larvse prove to be the latter species ; and they may also include 
a third species of similar habits, namely Luperi7ia cespitis.

Nesting op the Jack-Snipe.
— In your last number we are asked to 
believe that the jack-snipe — a bird that has hitherto never been proved 
to nest in the British Isles or any country of Europe of equal 
southern latitude (excepting Russia) — has bred in this country, and this, .
on the strength of evidence which is most eminently unsatisfactory, viz.
: 
the mere fact of a nest and eggs being found one day, and the perfectly 
unconnected circumstance that a jack-snipe was shot in the same locality 
two days after.
We are also informed that the eggs were those of the 
normal type.
Unfortunately the eggs of the jack-snipe lack decidedly 
discriminating characteristics, and are fac-similes of small specimens of 
those of the common snipe, being only a trifle less, and very large when 
the size of the bird is taken into consideration, in this respect proportion- 
ally much larger than eggs of the common snipe.
Although Mr. Hanson 
considers that the facts stated by him are proof positive, to me they 
are wholly unworthy of consideration ; and I venture to opine 
that no ornithologist in this country will, after so many false alarms, 
place any reliance in the eggs of the jack-snipe being obtained here 
190 
The Naturalist.
unless the old bird is actually snared upon her eggs.
In conclusion, I 
may say that the eggs in the possession of Mr. Lumb will, I think, prove 
to be those of the dunlin or the common snipe.

of the Wakefield NaturaHsts' Society, Joseph Wainwright, Esq., F.L.S., 
when endeavouring to capture one of the above venomous reptiles at 
Wentbridge, on Saturday, the 18th June, was bitten by it in the finger.
None of the party had any ammonia, and it was consequently some time 
before any proper assistance could be given, and we understand that Mr .
Wainwright therefore lies in a very critical condition.
We are quite sure 
that all our readers will join us in expressing our sympathy, and earnest 
hope that no serious consequences will ensue, and that Mr. Wainwright

Tetradontium Brownianum at Staley Brushes.
— In the report of the 
Manchester Cryptogamic Society in last month's Naturalist, Mr. Cash is 
mentioned as having discovered Tetradontium Brownianum in Staley 
Brushes.
This is really not a discovery, as I and several of my 
friends have known the above moss to occur at Staley Brushes many 
years back.
On referring to my herbarium I find that my specimens 
from that locahty are marked ''Feb., 1867." I also beg to report the 
occurrence in this district of Plagiothecium Borrerianum^ with good 
fruit.
It was found so far back as May, 1872, by Messrs.
T. Ashtonand 
J. Nield, in a wood near Marple.
I have much pleasure in stating that 
it still produces fruit in the same locality, as I and my friend Mr. Holt 
gathered good specimens on the 5th of June.

NOTICES OF BOOKS, &c.— ''Insect Variety: its Propagation 
and Distribution, by A.
H. Swinton.
London : Cassell, Petter, & Galpin, 
1881." — There can be no doubt that the mass of our amateur and local 
naturalists, so-called, are simply so in name, and content themselves 
with collecting specunens, naming or getting them named for them, 
exchanging such specimens with other collectors, and placing them when 
so named in cabinets, drawers and herbaria, and here their work, good 
in- its way, stops.
More especially we believe is this the case with 
entomologists — and chiefly so amongst lepidopterists.
There be many 
estimable collectors who can tell us, from wing-markings and similar 
superficial data, what is the name of any insect and its comparative rarity 
and value.
But how few amongst them can go any further, or know 
anything of insect economy, anatomy and physiology, or the connection 
and bearing of entomology with other cognate sciences.
This is a grave 
error on the part of such persons, and one which we hope to see, ere 
long, eliminated ; and any assistance or incentive to study the whole life- 
history of this exceedingly interesting class of animal life should be 
welcomed by all true naturalists.
Such a help and incentive, not the 
Eainfall for May.
191 
first in the field we know, is now before us, and we heartily recommend 
its careful perusal by all entomologists.
We further trust that such 
perusal and study will, to them, be an incentive to study their favourite 
science in a philosophical spirit.
In his introduction, Mr. Swinton gives 
us an account of his early studies in entomology, and tells us how he was 
led to improve upon mere collecting by stud^nng the habits and anatomy 
of insects.
In the other chapters he gives a detailed account of the 
results of his researches ; the passions of insects, their senses of touch, 
smell, hearing, their circulation, luminosity, stridulation, musical 
capacities, and the organs used for these varied purposes, their situation, 
connection and methods of use ; the whole of these being illustrated by 
numerous well-executed plates of dissections, nervous system, and varied 
actions, in all the orders of insects.
A useful chapter is devoted to the 
connection of all these phenomena, with migration, shewing how together 
they induce variation and natural selection.
The style in which the book 
is written renders it eminently readable even by non-entomologists, 
though it is open to question whether this semi-poetical method of treat- 
ment wiU be pleasing to all readers.
That is a matter of taste.
Whilst 
welcoming this book as a great step in the right direction, and one which 
we trust will bear useful fruit, as it deserves to do, we cannot overlook 
that it bears the marks, in occasional badly-constructed sentences and 
other slight errors, of having been composed too hastily.
Though these 
blemishes do not impair the general usefulness of the work, we hope to 
see them removed in future editions.

Barnsley Naturalists' Society.
— JNIr. Lister forwards a few notes of 
bird arrivals, and promises a tabulated comparative list for next issue.
Amongst other arrivals in the Barnsley district are two or three instances 
of the.
nightingale, besides several reports of the same which have proved 
to be erroneous.
In all these cases an amount of drunkenness and 
ruffianism has occurred amongst the nightly visitors to hear the birds, 
which Mr. Lister characterises as disgraceful.
It is a great pity that the 
law fails to meet such cases.
Bradfort) Naturalists' Society.
— Meeting May 24th, Mr. Spencer in 
the chair.
— The chairman read an instructive paper on ''Plant-lore," in 
which he showed how the names of many plants, both British and

Lancashire and Cheshire Entomological Society.
— Monthly 
meeting, the vice-president, Mr. N.
Cooke, in the chair.
— Mr. H.
H. 
Corbett, of Cheadle Hume, read a paper on "Some secondary Sexual 
Characteristics in Common Insects," in which he considered the differences 
in structure which are often observed in the sexes of insects, generally 
tending to a higher development of some of the organs in the male sex, 
such as greater power of locomotion, brighter colors, and a greater 
devolopment of the antennae, &c.
In many cases he explained the 
reason of this difference in structure.
During the conversazione which 
followed, Mr. N.
Cooke exhibited some Scotch insects recently collected 
by himself ; the Rev. H.
H. Higgins exhibited a number of lepidoptera, 
accompanied by the preserved larva and pupa of each species, collected 
by Mr. Dunkenfield Jones, at San Paulo, Brazil ; Mr, Johnson, a 
specimen of Ennomos alniaria : the secretary, Mr. Ellis, a smoky variety 
of Phigalia pilosaria, from Bradford ; and Mr J.
Wall distributed living 
specimens of Lepisma saccharina, the scales of which are used as test- 
objects for the microscope.

W. Ellis, Hon. Sec.
Manchester Cryptogamic Society.
— Monthly meeting, Monday, 
June 16th.
— Captain Cunliffe, vice-president, in the chair.
Mr. W.
H. 
Pearson exhibited specimens of Gymnomitrium crassifolium gathered on 
Ben Kevis by Mr. W.
West ; Jnngermannia laxifolia from Glydr Vaur, 
collected by himself, and abundant specimens of Nardia alpina recently 
collected during an excursion to Bowf ell in company with Mr. Geo.
Stabler.
According to Dr. Gottsche this species had not previously been found 
in perfect fruit.
Mr. Cunliffe exhibited specimens of that rare 
and critical species, Gymyiostomum sguarrosum, which it is interesting 
to note was found so near home as Handforth ; also Pleuridium alter-

nifolium from Styal, and Zygodon conoideus from Barmouth.
Mr. Cash 
gave a brief account of a recent visit along with Captain Cunliffe 
to the valley af the Wharfe, and described the finding of such rare 
mosses as Encalypta streptocarpa in fruit !
and Orthodontium gracile and 
Tetraphis pellucida in the same interesting condition ; specimens of the 
latter species he kindly distributed.
The rest of the evening was spent 
in examining a fine collection of European mosses, which had been 
presented to the Manchester Free Reference Library by the executors of 
the late John Windsor.
The collection had been made by the late Prof.
Schimper, and was in excellent condition, the specimens being very 
ample, and a large number of them rare as British species : fruiting 
specimens of Lescuroea striata, Mnium spinosum, M.
stellare, Mypnum 
Halleri, and others equally represented.
The members were much 
pleased with the examination, and expressed their gratitude towards the 
donors for their generous gift to the town.
— T.
Bogers, Hon. Sec.
Wakefield Naturalists' and Philosophical Society.
— Meeting 
June 1st, Dr. Crowther, v.
p. occupied the chair, and exhibited two living 
species of German and Italian snakes of the genus Lepidonotus, in allusion 
to which he made some remarks upon the habitat, life, and method of 
locomotion common to each species.
Mr. Thomas Mason showed the 
whipcord snake from Java, and the spotted snake from India, both in 
spirits.— E.

Yorkshire Naturalists' Union.
— Hornsea, Whit-Monday, 6th June.
— Favoured with a bright sun and an unclouded sky, the members of the 
Union had a very pleasant day.
The collections obtained were valuable 
and numerous.
Due attention was paid to the natural beauties of the 
neighbourhood, and the various objects of interest with which it abounds, 
these including the broad band of loose, heavy, sloping sands, stretching 
beneath a line of clayey clifis upon which the sea is making rapid and 
serious inroads ; the ancient church, built upon a vaulted crypt, used, it 
is said, at one time, as a receptacle for smuggled goods, and containing 
an alabaster tomb of 1430 of A.nthony St. Quintin ; and the hollow lands 
known as "The Carrs " — once a region of bog and water, covering the 
remains of an ancient forest.
Amongst other spots around which the 
naturalists lingered was Hornsea Mere, with its reeds, shallows, and wild 
fowl — its wooded islands, and, at one end, its belt of thickly growing 
trees, forming an agreeable shade from th^ almost tropical heat of the 
sun.
Permission to visit the Mere estate had been obtained from Mr.
Constable.
The Mere, it may be mentioned, is of special interest to 
ornithologists, and has produced some of the rarest Yorkshire specimens.
Several rare species of beetles have also been found.
As yet the district 
around Hornsea has been but little explored by conchologists, but there 
is little doubt that careful research would considerably extend the list of 
species.
Pisidium roseum has been taken in the Mere, and much variety 
of form exists in the Anodons from the same place.
It was four o'clock 
Eeports of Societies.
195 
before the naturalists had completed their researches, and shortly after 
that hour they adjourned to the Alexandra Hotel for tea.
Subsequently 
the sections met for the purpose of classifying the various specimens, and 
afterwards the general meeting was held.
Mr. C.
P. Hobkirk, F.L.S.
(Huddersfield), v.p.
, presided, and the following societies were represented : 
— Bradford Naturalists' Society, Bradford Scientific Association, Driffield 
Naturalists' Society, Goole Naturalists' Society, Huddersfield Naturalists' 
Society, Huddersfield Literary and Scientific Association, Huddersfield 
Scientific Club, Hull Naturalists' Society, Leeds Conchological Society, 
Leeds Geological Society, Leeds Naturalists' Field Club, Malton Natu- 
ralists' Society, and Selby Naturalists' Society.
Several new subscribers 
were added to the Union, and a vote of thanks was passed to Mr. N.
F. 
Dobree, of Beverley, for his services as local secretary.
— Mr. S.
Jefierson 
proposed a vote of thanks to H.
S. Constable, Esq.
, for his permission to 
visit the Hornsea Mere estate.
Mr. Dobree stated the result of the 
investigations of the entomological department, remarking that the 
section had little to report, owing to the early date of the meeting and the 
inclemency of the spring.
Of lepidoptera, diurni were not seen beyond 
the commonest species ; of geometrse the most noteworthy were Acidalia 
emarginata, Melanippe montanata, and Emmelesia decolorata, the latter 
being new to Holderness.
Mr. T.
E. Holder, of Hull, the only coleopterist 
present, reported coleoptera more abundant ; Athous liEemorrhoidalis, 
Otiorhynchus picipes, Hister bimaculata, were taken, and also seven 
species which have been submitted to Mr. Wrigglesworth to be 
named, but whose report is not yet received.
The day's doings in botany 
were reported upon by Mr. F.
Arnold Lees, F.L.S. Of phanerogams 
eighty species had been observed in bloom, of which the following were 
the most noteworthy : — Thalictrum flavum, Ranunculus circinnatus, 
Cochlearia danica, &ilene maritima, Honkeneja peploides, Geranium 
columhinnm, Hippuris vulgaris, Myriophyllum eu-spicatum, Ceratophylluni 
aquaticum, Slum latifolium (border of Mere), Menyanthes trifoliata, 
Convolvulus Soldanella, Hottonia palustris, Plantago Coronopus, Bumex 
Hydrolapathum, Hydrocharis Morsus-ranse, Elodea canadensis, Orchis 
Morio, 0.
ustulata, O.
incarnata ; Habenaria viridis, Carex arenaria 
(sands by sea), Carex paludosa, C.
riparia, Glyceria aquatica, and Elymus 
arenarius.
The eight of the foregoing placed in italics are " New County 
Records," i.e. they are additions to the divisional distribution given in 
" Topographical Botany," fiot having been published before for the vice- 
county 61 — the south-east fifth of Yorkshire.
The Elymus, the Slum, 
and the 0.
incarnata were only recently placed on record for the division 
in the B.
record Club Reports.
In cryptogams little was done during 
th'e day.
One fern — Ophioglosum vulgatum — wojthy of mention, was 
seen ; no mosses beyond the very commonest ; three kinds of common 
corticolous lichens occur in some luxuriance on trees on the islands in 
the Mere — Evernia, Ramalina, etc.
; and three micro-fungi were col- 
lected : Puccinia segopodii, -^cidium rubellum and valerianacearum.

The Naturalist.
Marine botany produced one object only.
The chairman remarked that 
Mr. W.
West, of Bradford, the secretary for cryptogamic botany, had 
been obliged to resign his position, owing to pressure of business.
— It 
was resolved to accept his resignation, and to forward a vote of thanks to 
him for his services.
Mr. W.
B. Russell, secretary of the geological 
section, said the only strata in the neighbourhood were the glacial and 
post-glacial.
It seemed that the common boulder clay was characterised 
by being very densely crammed with blocks of rocks.
They found the 
carboniferous limestone, the millstone grit, the permian rocks, the red 
chalk, &c.
An enormous block of chalk was seen — 21 yards long and 6ft.
thick — in the midst of post-glacial gravel.
Amongst other things were a 
great amount of roots of various trees and the seeds of plants.
— The Rev, 
H. H, Slater reported on the vertebrate zoology section, stating that thirty 
birds — twenty-one resident and nine non-resident — had been noticed.
The list is as follows : r denoting Resident ; v Summer Visitor and 
h breeding.
— Thrush, r and b ; missel-thrush, r; robin, r ; garden -warbler, 
V ; white-throat, v ; reed warbler, v and h, abundant ; pied wagtail, r, 
probably in small numbers ; meadow pipit, r, in small numbers ; hedge 
sparrow, r and b ; greenfinch, r ; chaffinch, r and b ; house sparrow, r 
and b ; reed bunting, r and b, abundantly by Mere ; starling, r ; rook, r ; 
carrion crow, r and b ; swallow, v ; house martin, v ; sand martin, v ; 
skylark, r, probably in small numbers ; swift, v ; ringdove, r ; waterhen, 
r and b ; coot, r, though to some extent migratory in autumn ; common 
gull, r ; herring gull, r ; pochard, r and b, unusually abundant ; mallard, 
r and 6 ; great-crested grebe, r, doubtless breeding ; miite swan, r and b.
In addition to this list, the heron, which was believed to breed at 
Hornsea Mere, was conclusively proved not to do so, and it is probable 
that it has not done so for nearly ten years.
The quail has nested at 
Ulrome near here, on the authority of Mr. Boynton ; and the shoveller, 
which did not exhibit itself to the Union on June 6th, breeds there 
annually in small numbers, according to Mr. Boys.
Mr. W.
D. Roebuck 
stated that the conchological section had met with the best success of any 
of the sections.
Thirty species had been found, of which eleven were 
new to the district, and one species, Planorbis lineatus, was recorded for 
the first time in the East Riding.
It was abundant at Askham Bog, near 
York.
Only five species of land shells were observed, the members of 
the section having devoted their attention specially to the fresh-water 
species of the INIere, which seems to be particularly rich in the rarer kinds.
The following is the list : — Spha3rcum corneum, S.
