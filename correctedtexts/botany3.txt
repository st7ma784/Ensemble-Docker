interesting species.
Bullfinches and goldfinches were not uncom- 
mon, and some timber by the river- banks rendered the scenery 
more pleasing, h'uonipmts europunis and Origannin ruhjarr.
occurred, 
while wild roses, especially 11.
arvensis, were abundantly in blossom.
JiDictis (jlaucus has been our constant companion ; so also are 
Poh/i/onum ampldbinm and Sclrpus lacustris.
Near Abbeyleix, I first 
noticed here a rather large sedge, Carex vesicaria; and in the 
Abbeyleix Woods Campanula Trachelium was obtained at the river's 
brink.
Below Abbeyleix Equisetuin hycmale, Gyiimadenia conojisea, 
Quercits sessi/ijiora, and Carex paludusa occurred.
Nearer to Durrow 
Thalictruvi fiavum, characteristic of the larger rivers in the inland 
counties of south-eastern Ireland, first ajjpeared.
At Durrow we 
passed a night.
The accommodation in these little towns cannot 
be expected much of, but the people usually take pleasure in doing 
their best, which makes up for many shortcomings.
From Durrow we rejoined the Nore by the banks of a tributary, 
the Erkina.
In it were seen the (Knanthe already mentioned, 
Ranunculus Lingua, Sium angustifolmvi, and Carex vesicaria.
In 
thickets alongside of it, on the right bank near the junction, 
ULercurialis peremiin''- was found in the greatest abmidance for some 
distance.
This is a very rare plant in Ireland, only occurring in 
about half a dozen localities, chiefly in the north, of which 
Parsonstown is the nearest.
Along here occurred also Campanula 
Trachelium (sparingly), Orchis rnoriu, Euonymus eurupcBus, Scutellaria 
galericulata, Lgsimachia vulgaris, Gymnadenia conopsea, Nasturtixmi 
(Armoracia) amphibium, and Carex paludosa.
These were noticed 
in the order given along the right bank of the river to Ballyragget, 
where we have entered the County Kilkenny.
The river is pretty, 
diversified with wooded banks.
At Ballyragget Matricaria Chamo- 
milla was found in a waste-heap by a mill-race ; it is an alien, and 
appears very rarely.
I have never gathered it in Ireland except 
once at Howth and once in Wicklow, both times in waste ground.
Malvu moschata, one of our prettiest wild flowers, was gathered.
At Ballyragget we crossed to the left bank.
About four miles down 
Nasturtium sylvestre again occurred.
Yellow water-lily Avas frequent, 
the white hardly being met with.
About two miles above Kilkenny, 
on the left bank, is a large patch of a naturalised Aster, which 
Mr. Baker believes is an American species, A.
Icevis.
Its occurrence, 
with all the outward appearance of a native, for it is far from a 
garden at present existing, or pleasure ground, is very interesting, 
I found it again in still more unsuspicious circumstances, and 
farther from a road below Woodstock on the other side ; and I 
have seen the same Aster since, apparently established, by a 
stream near Biuidoran, in Donegal, and in a garden at Glengarrifl', 
in Cork, In none of these places had it any sympton of a flower, 
up to the end of August at Bundoran.
A little below the Aster, 
and from that to the town of Kilkenny, in wet meadows close to 
the river, Culchicum autumnale was met with abundantly, and now 
* I have recently received specimens of this phmt from Glassloui,'h, Co.
Monaghan, where Miss i'oung finds it iu abundance.
230 BOTANICAL NOTES ALONG THE RIVERS NORE, RLACKWATER, ETC.
in fruit.
The entrance to Kilkenny is very fine by the river, the 
Castle of the Ormondes being a most imposing structure.
An 
excellent hotel afforded us a good night's rest.
On the following morning (Tuesday, July 8th) we left Kilkenny.
Senebicni (Jidi/nia was noticed about the town.
(J.
sanguinea, in 
the large shrubbery form, is naturalised below the town in several 
places.
Thalictntvi Jiavum, Nastiutium palnstre, and Verbena offici- 
nalis occurred at Bennett's Bridge.
The scenery has become 
wooded and beautiful.
Colchicum autumyiale still occurs.
The two 
commoner Spargani^ims [S.
minimum and S.
ramosum), Oriyanum, 
Phalaris, and liuuiex Hydrolapathum were seen to Thomastown on 
the right bank.
Alliitm vineale and Lysimachia vulgaris occurred 
freely at Mount Juliet, the seat of Lord Carrick.
Near this, too, 
Campanula Trachelium was very plentiful in wet thickets near the 
river and at its very edge.
Between Thomastown and Innistiogue 
I noted the Campajiula, the large water-dock, Centaurea Scahiosa, 
Ononis arvensis, Orchis pi/ramidalis, Scahiosa ((rrensis, and Kpiluhium 
hirsutum as the species of most interest.
At Innistiogue we stopped 
for the night in a most delightfully clean, well- supplied, and 
prettily- situated inn.
About Innistiogue, on old ivied walls, Orobanche hcdera is 
abundant.
The great attraction to this little village is the 
beautiful demesne of Woodstock, at the gate of which it lies.
The gardens of Woodstock are famous, and an hour or two were 
well spent in them under the guidance of a most intelligent Irish 
gardener.
With especial pride he showed us a magnificent 
Araucaria, over fifty feet high.
This, he stated, was the second 
best in the kingdom, the best being at Dropmore, which was 
planted a year earlier, the Woodstock one being planted in 1834.
As a matter of fact the two oldest in the kingdom date from 1796, 
one at Kew and the other at Dropmore, the latter being, I believe, 
the best grown, and about sixty feet high.
There is also here a 
double line of younger Araucaria: (1850), about 300 yards in 
length, with a grass lane between, under which circumstances they 
show to peculiar advantage.
In the woods above the river, on the right bank, Carex pendula, 
Luzula pilosa, and the wood onion, occurred.
Blackcaps were 
singing in many cases ; they are local birds in Ireland.
I met 
them in a similar and almost as beautiful place by the Barrow, at 
Borris, the previous year.
From a little below Woodlands Campanula Tracheluou becomes 
most abundant, all along the river amongst the coarsest weeds on 
dykes and embankments, and in tangled thickets at the water's 
edge to New Boss.
I found it very sparingly the previous year near 
Portarlington, on the Barrow ; the Nore, on which it has been long- 
known, is its most satisfactory habitat in Ireland.
From Woodstock to New Boss, along the edge of the Nore on 
the right bank, is a kind of exploit in pedestrianism which demands 
some enthralling motive to make it go cheerfully.
The river is 
tidal, and the osier banks and beds of reeds are often intersected 
by stagnant, sunken courses of slimy water on a bed of " glar."

Wide detours are sometimes imperative ; but when one is tired it 
is astonishing how much filthy wading will be endured in pre- 
ference to a wide detour.
My friend, however, retired far inland.
I foimd along here, in the order quoted, (Enanthe Lachenaid.
Scirpus maritimus (first symptom of saline growth), Carex pendula, 
iilyceria aquatica, Carex riparia, Aster s-p.
? [A.
lavis f), (Encmthe 
Jistulosd, Apium graveolens, Hordeuin prutense (a very rare grass), to 
Ballyueale.
From Ballyneale onwards Lycopus europams, Dipsacus 
sylrestre, Orobanche hedercv.
were met with, and (Jlyceria, Campanula, 
and Carex riparia occurred to below the junction of the Nore and 
the Barrow.
We arrived at New Eoss in the afternoon of July 9th.
On the 
following day we made use of the steamer to Waterford, and thence 
by rail to Cappoquin for the Blackwater.
The Nore had been a 
decided disappointment compared with the Barrow.
Both in 
scenery and botany the more western river exhibits a falling off.
Bits of the Nore, as about Woodstock and Brown's Barn, are nearly 
as good as Graignenamanagh or St. MuUins, on the BarroAV, but 
there is far more monotony along the Nore.
The decrease in the 
rarer plants can easily be seen by referring to my paper on the 
Barrow in the ' Journal of Botany ' for January, 1885.
On the 11th of July we steamed down the Blackwater Estuary 
from Cappoquin to Youghal.
There is not a more lovely bit of 
scenery than this in the British Isles.
If the Blackwater yields 
fewer rare plants than the other large Irish rivers, it can at any 
rate boast that it has no rival in beauty.
From Youghal to 
Mallow is about seventy miles by the river, which we walked in 
three days, and the whole distance almost lay from one well- 
wooded gentleman's place to another.
On the first day, Youghal 
to Cappoquin, the waters are tidal, and we also came in for floods, 
and had many difficulties to contend with.
Hideous slimy chan- 
nels, that could neither be swam, waded, nor jumped, often threw us 
far astray.
In the salt-marshes near Youghal Statics bahusiensis, 
Carex vulpina, C.
extensa, (Enanthe Lachenalli, Apinm, and other 
commoner kinds occurred.
Eqaisetum maximum may also be men- 
tioned.
Carex jmniculata, Scrophnlaria aquatica, Carex riparia, 
Litliuspermum arvense, were the most interesting plants along 
the left bank to Villierstown.
Near Cappoquin Elodca canadensis 
has established itself.
On the following day (July 12) we kept the right bank up the 
river to Lismore.
Near Cappoquin Carex pendula was found, and 
farther on Xasturtiuin palustre and Lycopus europccus appeared.
At 
Lismore, or rather a little above the bridge, a fine clump of 
Butoiniis umbellatus, in full flower, was a most refreshing variety.
Rumex Hydrolapatliuin, Scropliularia aquatica, and Mentha rotundi- 
folia occurred here, the latter in two places, one below Lismore, 
and quite established.
This mint is not (probably) native in 
Ireland.
Xasturtium palustre is very abundant, and much larger 
than I have seen it elsewhere in Ireland along here.
Carex 
vesicaria, Scirpus sylvaticus, Lysimachia cuhjaris, Lycopus, Ejiihjbiuin 
hirsutum, Aparyia hispida, Symphytum ajjicinale, Limpinella iiiayna, 
232 BOTANICAL NOTES ALONG THE RIVERS NORE, BLACKWATER, ETC.
and Saponaria ojficinalis were gathered to Ballyduff.
From 
Cappoquin the walking has been splendid, firm banks with a good 
hard sward, and just a reasonable amount of impediments.
Near 
Fermoy liutomus occurred again, and with it Nasturtium sylvestre.
Since ]>allyduff we have been in the County Cork.
The 
Blackwater lies chiefly in this county, a small portion at the north- 
west end, where it rises, being in Kerry, while the last twenty miles 
of its course are in Waterford.
Cork has received more special 
attention at the hands of botanists than any other Irish county, 
and I may here refer to the latest work on the subject by the Eev.
Thos.
Allin, Avhose flora renders it unnecessary for me to mention 
species which he has shown to be common in the county.
Having passed the night in a capital hotel in Fermoy we 
followed the left bank up the river to Mallow on the 13th.
At 
Castle Hyde, a lovely place, I noticed Epipactis latifolia, Armaria 
trinervia, and Oruhanche Hedera;.
At Ballyhooly I saw (JEnanthe 
Phellandrium, the only place in the Blackwater it occurred.
About 
a mile above Cregg Castle, on the left bank, I found a real rarity, 
AUiiuii Scorudnjirasum.
I met with it again on the same bank at 
the lower part of Norreys Castle demesne near Mallow.
It was 
growing in small grassy thickets near the stream in each locality, 
and had all the appearance of a native, not being on the brink, as 
species conveyed by the river usually are.
The only other stations 
for this Allium in Ireland are Foaty Island, in Cork, and thickets at 
Killarney.
Near Killawillin fhiphurhia kiberna was first met with ; 
it is found as far east, however, as Cappoquin.* Geranium lucidum 
and Lithuspermwii arcense were fi'equently seen.
The decrease in 
the interesting river species as we travelled west was most note- 
worthy.
Gradually they all disappeared, giving place to few species 
of any interest in their stead.
About three miles above Mallow, 
which we left on the morning of the 14th, I met with Nasturtium 
amphibium in a drain leading to the river on the left bank.
I will 
not positively commit myself to this locality, as I unfortunately did 
not secure a specimen ; but being very familiar with the plant I 
can hardly have made a mistake.
It is very rare in Cork, Mr.
Allin being only able to supply two localities.
Kuphorbia hiberna ' 
and (Enanthe crocata are consj)icuous plants to Mill Street, and 
with regard to the rest I have simply noted " all common." 
From Mallow the Blackwater had neither botany nor beauty, 
so we bade it good-bye at Mill Street, and went westwards to 
Killarney, and thence over the Eeeks to Sneem.
In spongy bogs 
behind Sneem I found lihijnchospora fusca and Carcx liiiiosa in some 
profusion, and at Derryquin, near Sneem, Lijcopus europmts, not a 
common plant in Kerry, occurs by the roadside.
From Keumare we crossed by Cleonee and Inchiquin Lakes to 
Glengarifi', back again from Kerry to the County Cork.
About 
Cleonee Iwtrijehium Lunaria, Utricularia intermedia, and Eriucaulun 
septantjulare Avere gathered.
At Inchiquin Lake a natural wood of 
some extent of holly, oak, alder, birch, hazel, crab-apple, and 
* [I found it still further east in 18«0, a CoUigan, near Dungarvan, 
Co. Waterford.

Viburnum occurs.
The floor of it is literally paved with Saxifraga 
hirsuta and S.
umhrosa.
Irish spurge and the two filmy ferns are 
also common.
This wood is called Uragh Wood.
In it I found 
also Carex pallesccns and Neottia Nidus-avis.
The latter is very 
rare in Ireland, and has not been found in the South of Ireland 
below Wicklow previously.
Near Glengariff Scrophularia aquatica, 
Anthcmis nobilis, Carex lirnosa, Uadiola Milletjrana, and Scutellaria 
galericulata were found on the way to Berehaveu.
The Scutellaria, 
with the smaller one, S.
minor, grows on the limestone shingle 
close by the edge of the sea in Bearhaven Bay, near Adrigoole, an 
unusual situation.
On bare rocky mountains above Glen Lough, 
north-east from Adrigoole, I gathered Sai/ina snbulata and Juniperus 
nana, both very rare in Cork.
In one at least of the many lakes 
here Eriocaulon septangulare is abundant, an important addition to 
Mr. Alhn's Flora.
In the foregoing herborization the following species are addi- 
tions to the Flora of District 3 of ' Cybele Hibernica ' and its 
Supplement : — 
Nasturtium sylvestre.
Mercurialis perennis.
Armoracia amphibia.
Piuniex Hydrolapathum.

Xeottia Nid^ts-avis is an addition to the Flora of District 1, its 
locality being just inside the Kerry boundary, and Eriocatdon sept- 
angulare is an addition to the Flora of Cork ; while new localities 
are given for several rare species, notably Allium.
Scorodoprasum.
and Rhynchvspora fusca.
THE MOSS FLOEA OF SUFFOLK.
By the Eev. E.
N. Bloomfield, M.A.
On looking at the last edition of the ' London Catalogue of 
British Mosses and Hepatics,' it will be observed that the compilers 
knew little for certain of the Moss Flora of the Ouse Province, 
which comprises the counties of Norfolk, Suffolk, Cambridge, (fee.
I think it may not be amiss, therefore, to brmg together all the 
information I can procure as to the Flora of one of these counties, 
which may be taken as a fair specimen of the productions of the 
> 'ovince.
I am fortunate in possessing very trustworthy materials for this 
enumeration in the case of the county of Suffolk.
I have a good 
number of specimens from the late Mr. E.
Skepper, of Bury 
St. Edmunds, Co-editor of the ' Flora of Suffolk.' These are sup- 
plemented by specimens gathered by the late Mr. F.
K. Engle, 
234 THE MOSS FLOKA OF SUFFOLK.
also of Bury, kindly communicated by Mrs. Skepper ; and also 
some from the late l)r.
White, of Lavenham.
In addition to these, 
I have a good many specimens from the Eev. W.
M. Hind, LL.D., 
of Honington, and also some from Mr. W.
Jordan, of Cockfield, 
while I have gathered a few myself, both in East and West 
Suffolk.
These specimens have been verified, and in not a few in- 
stances determined by Mr. H.
Boswell, of Oxford.
By permission of Mrs. Skepper, the moss herbarium formed by 
i\Ir. E.
Skepper was sent to the Eev. James Eergusson, of Fern 
Brechin, who has carefully examined it and favoured me with 
copious notes on the species contained in it.
Thus I am able to employ the nomenclature of the ' London 
Catalogue,' with the assurance that few errors are likely to have 
crept in, at any rate as regards the specimens examined.
The principal omissions will be the new critical species of such 
genera as Sphagnum, Burbula, Bryxim &c., which have not been 
collected to any extent.
Mr. Skepper's and Dr. White's specimens were mostly collected 
about the years 1860—62.
Mr. F.
K. Eagle's, in the first half of 
the present century ; only one or two packets having dates.
The western division of the county has been fairly well 
searched, and I have a pretty good set of specimens from it.
The 
eastern division has only been examined, to any extent, near 
Yarmouth, in the beginning of the present century, by such good 
observers as Sir W.
Hooker and Messrs.
Dawson Turner, Dick- 
son, &c.
In order to indicate the distribution, as far as I can at present, 
I have added E.
= Eastern Division, W.
= Western Division, but 
if neither of these marks are added it shows that specimens have 
been examined fr'om both.
When we have seen no specimens the mark * is affixed.
In all 
other cases I have had specimens myself, or there are some in 
Mr. Skepper's herbarium, or Mr. D.
Turner's herbarium, fide 
Wilson in Bry. Brit.
; but if in these exclusively Sk. Herb, or 
Turner Herb, is added to the locality.
Where a species has not 
been met with in the vice-county since Mr. Eagle's time, but I 
have specimens collected by him, I have added (Eagle), but these 
are for the most part species easily overlooked.
The ' Natural History of Yarmouth,' which is quoted so often, 
is by Messrs.
Paget (i.
e., Sir James Paget and his brother), and 
was published in the year 1834.
The parishes of Tuddenham and Wangford, mentioned in this 
list, are the parishes of those names in West Suffolk, both lying in 
the sand tract to the north-west of the county, sometimes called the 
Breck District.
Where no localities are given, the species is believed to be 
somewhat generally distributed,^ as indeed are many others for 
which localities are given here.
The localities given are in most 
cases those only from which specimens have been examined.

NOTES ON THE FLORA OF CEYLON.
By Henry Trimen, M.B., F.L.S.
(Coutiuued from p.
209).
Wrightia flavido-rosea Trim.
— Brandies cylindric, the young 
twigs finely pubescent ; leaves lanceolate, tapering at botli ends or 
slightly caudate-acuminate, sessile, entire, membranous, rather 
rough on both surfaces, with short hairs scattered on the veins ; 
venation prominent and reticulated beneath ; cymes 3-flowered, 
two or three together at the ends of the branches ; pedicels long, 
much thickened upwards, iiubescent; buds pointed; calyx-segments 
broadly oval-triangular, obtuse, thick and gibbous at base, mem- 
branous at edges ; scales small, ovate, alternate with the segments; 
corolla with the short tube one-third longer than the calyx-segments ; 
lobes oval-oblong, obtuse or subacute, puberulous on both sides, 
not fleshy, orange-salmon-coloured, becoming purplish grey when 
withering; coronal scales of the same colour, 10 sti-ap-shaped, cut 
one-third down into 3 filamentous segments and 10 undivided 
linear ; anthers with a tuft of white hairs at summit, pubescent 
externally, dirty white ; style thickened upward ; stigma with two 
short papilbe on summit ; fruit not seen.
NOTES ON THE FLOKA OF CEYLON.

Hab. Near the foot of Doluwe Kande, north of Kurunegala, 
N. W.
Province, May, 1884.
A small tree with very tough and fibrous inner bark.
Branch- 
lets thickened at the nodes.
Leaves 4-6 in.
long, deep apple-green, 
paler beneath.
Flowers large, 1^ in.
across, the tube of corolla 
| in.
Coronal scales a darker colour than the corolla-lobes, and 
arranged thus : — The 6 outermost trifid ones opposite the corolla- 
lobes and adherent to them for their lower one-third, the 5 inner 
trifid ones alternate with these and immediately outside the sta- 
mens ; the 10 undivided ones in pairs between the bases of 
the stamens.* The flowers, when quite dry, become dull 
bluish grey ; both they and the leaves, when fresh, are full of a 
milky juice.
This is no doubt the plant doubtfully referred to by Thwaites 
(Enum.
p. 193) as IF.
Bothii, var.
puherida.
The specimen (C.
P. 
1837) is from Dambulla, collected by Gardner.
In the ' Fl. Brit.
Ind.' (iii., p.
653) W.
Ruthil G.
Don is placed as a variety under 
W. tmctorin, but neither is given for Ceylon.
Our plant does not 
well agree with Eoth's description (Nov. PI.
Sp., p.
121), but it 
ought perhaps to form no more than a subspecies of W.
tinctoria.
From the ordinary forms of that species (which is met with in 
Ceylon in cultivation only) it differs remarkably in the colour of 
the flowers (which are always white in W.
tinctoria), and in the 
more slender habit, form of the leaves, &c.
The change of colour undergone by the flower before withering 
is analogous to that of W.
tomentosa.
In that species the corolla 
(which is thick, fleshy and brittle, and has an unpleasant scent) is 
at first pale dull greenish-ochre (quite green externally), the corona 
alone being salmon-coloured, but soon the whole changes into a 
dull inky-purple.
Hence the discrepancies in descriptions as to 
colour alluded to in 'Fl. Brit.
India.' In this species the coronal 
scales are coherent, forming a fleshy, truncate, somewhat 5-lobed, 
short tube or ring.
Tylophora flava Trim.
— Absolutely glabrous in all parts ; 
leaves ovate or oblong-ovate, cordate at base, rounded and suddenly 
acuminate at apex, thick and fleshy, rather glaucous, yellowish 
green, with paler conspicuous veins ; petiole very short, without 
glands ; peduncles very short, usually dichotomous ; flowers on 
slender pedicels, crowded on the contracted branches so as to be 
sub-umbellate in axils of very small acicular bracts ; calyx-segments 
long, lanceolate, quite glabrous or occasionally with a few bristly 
hairs ; corolla-lobes ovate-oblong, subacute, pale greenish yellow, 
the throat stained Avith purple ; coronal processes adnate to the 
gynostegium at the base, and there broad and fleshy, tapering 
above into thick triangular incurved points reaching the stigmatic 
table ; fruit-carpels spreading in a line, each about 3:^ in.
long, 
linear, tapering to a blunt point, cylindrical, smooth.
* In IViifihtia zeylanica there is a further (-Ith) row of these bodies, con- 
sisting of five more pairs of erect undivided filaments, just outside and opposite 
to the stamens.
In W.
anriustifulia Thw. there is but one row of live tritid and 
laciniate bodies alternate with the petals.
240 NOTES ON THE FLORA OF CEYLON.
Hab. Abundant on the sandy coast southward from Colombo 
with other sea-shore plants, and conspicuous from the bright 
colour of its foliage.
Leaves often nearly 5 in.
long, more or less 
bullate ; petioles not ^ in.
long.
Pedicels about ^ in., soon dis- 
articulating at the bract-axil.
Flowers ^ in.
diam.
This I should have regarded as a maritime variety of T.
ostJimatica, but for the different form of the coronal processes.
These in that species are very abruptly narrowed into a short 
filiform point, instead of gradually tapering off, as in T.
flaca.
The 
other points of difference are the complete glabrosity, shorter 
peduncles and pedicels, larger flowers of a different colour, and 
narrow follicles.
Thwaites' var.
(jlahra of T.
asthmatica (C.

may be this plant in part, but the specimens here are insufficient 
to decide.

Flowering-stem short and stout, bearing 3-8 large flowers on rather 
long thick pedicels from axils of obtuse or rounded scales, not 
crowded ; pedicels naked, with no bracts beneath the flowers ; 
calyx over 1 in.
long, glabrous, completely closed in the bud and 
produced into a point, so that the bud is beaked, semispathaceous, 
dee];)ly 2-cleft, the lips usually more or less deeply cut into 2 and 8 
teeth ; corolla large, infundibuliform, curved, glabrous externally, 
uniform pale yellow; stamens scarcely exserted; filaments glabrous; 
both pairs of anthers coherent, the upper with short, the lower with 
very long spurs projecting forward; style a little longer than sta- 
mens and more exserted ; stigma large, broad, crescent-shaped or 
reniform ; placentas large, fleshy, meeting in the centre, and 
ovaliferous throughout, except where in contact.
Hab. Palagalla, Oct. 1853.
(C.
P. 2971 in Herb.
Perad.).
"Whole plant of a bright pale yellow colour, the flowers paler," 
quite glabrous, the rhizome short and stout.
Flowers li-2 in.
long, 
the corolla decidedly 2-lipped.
I have not seen this living ; it is 
described from good herbarium-specimens and an excellent coloured 
drawing.
Thwaites' short description of C.
unicolor [loc.
cit.) was 
clearly principally made from this plant, but the old coloured 
drawing, which was the whole foundation of Gardner's species, 
seems to have been also used.
This old figure is very unsatisfactory, 
but, as it shows two bracts beneath each flower, it is apparently a 
different species, and may be perhaps rightly placed under C.
neihjherriva, as done by Sir J.
Hooker; the flowers are small, and 
the calyx nearly truncate.
But as no specimens corresponding with 
this figure exist,* C.
unicolor Gardn.
must ever remain inde- 
terminable.
C. neilgherrica is rightly made synonymous with Cawphellia 
* C.
P. 1780, quoted doubtfully by Thwaites for C.
iniicolor, is represented 
here by a single flower, not named, but collected by Gardner.
It is probably C.
hlcolor.

cytinoides Wight in the 'Fl. Brit.
India,' but this is very distinct 
from the plant above described.
It is not infrequent in the high 
mountainous forests here, growing on the roots of Strohilanthes, and 
I have had several opportunities of examining fresh specimens.
I 
am inclined to think Wight's genus a good one, and its reunion 
with Christisonia by Sir J.
Hooker to be uncalled for.
The structure 
of the anthers is very different in CamphelUa; they are strictly one- 
celled, open by a terminal pore, and are quite free from one another 
and without spores ; the style, too, is different, being hooked, 
ovoid, and quite entire.
The genera are, however, closely allied, 
and their station away from one another in different natural orders, 
as in the ' Gen. Plant.,'* is as clearly an extreme in the opposite 
dh-ection.
The structure of the ovary and placentas is quite the 
same in both genera, truly one-celled in all I have examined, 
except occasionally near the base.
C. ThwaitesU, from its ebracteolate pedicels and large fleshy 
placentas, is referable to Wight's genus OligophoUs, which is 
generally regarded as not distinct from Christisonia ; but this also 
requires further examination of fi'esh specimens, which I hope 
I may get the opportunity of making.
Christisonia bicolor Gardn., var.
spectabilis.
— C.
spectabilis Thw.
ms, — Differs from var.
pallidijiora Thw.
(C.
pallida Gardn.) in its 
much larger size, the flowers reaching 3 in.
in length, with a more 
spreading limb, which is pure white, the tube being yellow and the 
calyx pink ; the rhizome is much stouter.
Hab. The Eaiuckles Hill, Kallebokka Vallev, Central Prov., 
Sept.
1868.
(C.
P. 3983 in Herb.
Perad.).
A very beautiful 
variety of this variable species, connected with the type through 
forms of pallidi/lora.
Scutellaria spicata Trim.
— Stem stout, erect, densely covered 
with short deflexed hairs ; leaves ovate or ovate-oblong, on hairy 
petioles, cordate or subcordate at base, obtuse at apex, strongly 
crenate, nearly glabrous above, densely velvety-hairy on the 
prominent veins beneath ; flowers few, very shortly stalked or 
subsessile, forming a terminal erect unbranched spicate inflorescence 
3-4 in.
long ; bracts broadly oval, longer than the pedicel, all 
densely hairy, with spreading hairs; calyx longer than in other 
Ceylon species, strongly pilose ; corolla very large, the tube wide, 
hairy without, the segments very wide.
Hab. By streams on Adam's Peak, at about 5500 ft.
elevation, 
March, 1883.
This may perhaps be no more than a variety of the 
common and variable ;S'.
violacea ; but the very large wide -tubed 
coralla (over ^ in.
in length), large bracts and nearly sessile flowers 
give it a very distinct look, and may be sufficient for specific 
separation.
I have not seen a specimen of S.
robnsta Beuth.
(DC.

must come very near ; and is placed by Thwaites (Enum.

(Epistylis).
— Leaves small, crowded, oblong-linear, very shortly stalked, 
tapering at base, acute at apex, not oblique, copiously dotted ; 
midrib prominent beneath ; stipules subfalcate, very acute, per- 
sistent ; flowers few, mostly in the upper axils ; peduncles filiform, 
nearly as long as leaves ; male perianth with 4 broadly oval, 
rounded, very obtuse, glabrous, entire segments ; female perianth 
with 6 similar segments twice the size of the male ; capsule quite 
smooth.
Hab. None given with the specimens, but presumably Uak-

narrow leaves, which are not at all oblique.
I have not seen it in

Ficus Trimeni King ms.
— Urosti(jma Tjiela Thw. Enum.
p. 2G5, in part (nou Miq.).
— "A gigantic tree with few aerial roots, 
all parts glabrous ; leaves coriaceous, oval or elliptic, with a short 
blunt apiculus, entire edges, and a slightly tapering obscurely 
3-nerved base, 3 to 4-5 in.
long; midrib thick and prominent; 
lateral nerves diverging from the midrib at a low angle, slightly 
prominent when dry, numerous, close, straight, anastomosing just 
within the thickened slightly revolute margin; petioles about -75 in.
long; stipules ovate-acuminate, •4--6 in.
long.
Pi.eceptacles sessile 
in pairs, axillary, globular, slightly verrucose when ripe, •4--5 in.
across, with three small spreading ovate-cordate slightly pubescent 
basal bracts." 
Hab. Not uncommon in the Central Province, especially in the 
lower hills, at an elevation of 1000-2000 ft., as Peradeniya, 
Kaduganawa, &c.
(C.
P. 2220 in Herb.
Perad.).
" This species approaches F.
Tsiela Roxb., and F.
retusa L., 
var.
nitida, but differs from both by its more numerous straight 
primary nerves, much more spreading habit, and fewer aerial 
roots" (King ms.).
It is not confined to Ceylon, having been 
collected in the Indian Penmsula by Law — in Cauara, Dhurwar, 
and Bellary Districts.
I am much indebted to Dr. King, of the Calcutta Botanic 
Gardens, for sending me the above description, which will appear 
in his forthcoming monograph of the Indian Ficus.
I had 
determined the tree as F.
indica L.
Syst., and it is given under that 
name in my "Hand-Guide" to the Peradeniya Botanic Gardens of 
1888 (p.
23).
A gigantic tree here is a well-known and prominent 
object, and is referred to by Thwaites in a note under U.
Tjiela in 
his ' Enum.,' p.
265.* This tree commenced life parasitically on a 
Jack-tree, which it strangled and superseded ; it is now a mag- 
nificent specimen, with symmetrically spreading misupported 
* A photograph of the trunk of this tree was taken in 1879, and there is, if I 
remember riglitly, a copy of it in the Timber Museum at Kew Gardens.
It is of 
further interest as containing a portrait of the late Dr. Tliwaites seated beneath 
the branches of the tree.

Hab. Paregodde, Pasdun Korle, Western Prov., June, 1883.
A few specimens only of this were brought in by the Garden 
collectors, and I have not yet succeeded in obtaining more ; but 
Dr. King, to whom I have submitted one of them, agrees that they 
represent a distinct species hitherto undescribed.
The collectors 
described it as a large tree.
The twigs are stout, with a yellow-grey 
bark, strongly marked with the scars of the fallen leaves and 
stipules.
Elatostema lineolatum Wight, var.
petiolake Thw. ms.
— 
Leaves 4-5 in.
long, including the petiole of ^-J in., into which the 
blade tapers gradually, narrowly lanceolate, caudate, with a long 
linear or strap-shaped tail, with 2-4 very coarse and large teeth on 
either side in upper part, entire below ; cystoliths linear, only 
showing on the under surface and on midrib and margins above, 
dark green, very pale beneath.
Hab. Central Province, May, 18G6.
(C.
P. 3920 in Herb.
Perad.).
A remarkable form of an extremely variable species, or perhaps 
of specific distinctness.
The leaves are as large as m var.
majus 
Wedd., and, besides the presence of a petiole, are remarkable for 
the absence of cystoliths on their upper surface, which becomes 
dark brown after drying.
Dendrobium albidulum Thw. ms.

Bulbophyllum crassifolmm Thw. ms.
— Small ; pseudo- 
bulbs small, numerous, about the size of a pea, nearly spherical, 
smooth ; leaves solitary, ^-f in.
long, sessile, very fleshy, oval, 
obtuse, the midrib marked by a furrow above ; flowers solitary, 
each on a very short peduncle in the sheath of a short truncate 
bract ; sepals nearly equal, broadly ovate, the upper one erect, 
arched, the lateral ones spreading, yellowish green, densely and 
minutely j)unctate with red ; petals minute, broad, truncate ; 
labellum very small, tongue-shaped, obtuse, white.
Hab. On the trunk of a tree, Kukul Korle, Western Pro v., 
Sept.

(C.
P. 3879 in Herb.
Perad.).
A very small and inconspicuous species, of which I have only 
seen the herbarium specimens above described.
Belongs apparently 
to the elegnns section, but remarkable for its very small solitary 
flowers.
The leaves are dark green, and very like those of some 
Hoija.
The above description is principally taken from a MS.
note 
of Dr. Thwaites.

Hab. Not an uncommon orchid on trees in the moist low

The specimens described were collected at Heneratgoda, 
Western Prov., in February of the present year (1885).

Mr. Bcntham, in Gen. Plant, iii.
p. 581, has pointed out that 
this plant is not the C.
nua-ulosiim of Lindley (to which he refers 
the Ceylon plant called by Thwaites Saccolabiuiii iincolatum), but 
seems to be a new species near C.

here, is a very accurate representation of the plant.
I have had, 
therefore, to re-name the species; which I do witli some hesitation, 
as it seems not improbable that C.
dccipiens Lindl.
in Bot. Mag.
1844, Misc.
p. 11, may be the same.
This species is from Ceylon; 
but the description is brief, and in the form and colour of the sepals 
and petals, and some other points, does not quite agree with that 
above given.
Disperis zeylanica Trim.
— D.
ttipetaloidea Lindl.
in part (non 
Drijopeici tripetaluides Thouars) ; Thw. Enum.
p. 311.
— Flowers with 
the lateral sepals connate for their lower half; labellum deeply 
bifid, with long linear divaricate lobes.
It is noted by Mr. S.
Moore, in Fl. Mauritius, p.
331, that the 
Ceylon plant is evidently different from the Mascarene D.
tri- 
petaloides, and indeed the above characters abundantly distinguish it.
This singular little i^lant is found amongst decaying leaves and 
rocks in the forests of the lower hills, now, however, mostly cleared.
It flowers in April and May, which is the period at which the 
majority of our orchids blossom.
I also met with it in the Nilgiris, 
South India, below Coonoor, in 1883 ; where there is also a second 
species of this curious chiefly African genus.
Curcuma oligantha Trim.
— Small ; tubers oblong-ovoid or 
fusiform ; leaves petiolate, the petioles dilated into long sheaths 
below ; blade oval, acute at both ends, much undulated, glabrous, 
thin, with distmct veins and transverse veiulets ; flowering-scape 
appearing with the new leaf-shoot and given off' from the axil of 
one of its basal scales, short and slender, with two or three blunt 
brown scales, terminated by the very reduced spike of 4-6 erect 
acuminate bracts, all of which are floriferous ; flowers very few, 
large, erect, as long as the spike, white ; corolla-tube 1 in.
long, 
slender, white ; segments long, acuminate-obtuse, pinkish, the 
posterior rather longer and more acute, petaloid ; staminodes sub- 
acute, crisped, pure white ; labellum large and broad, rather deeply 
bifid, white, with lemon-yellow stains in the throat ; anther short ; 
basal spurs rather long, curved ; seeds without an aril, oblong, 
grey, shining.
Hab. Uma-oya, near the Maha-weli Eiver, north-west of 
Badulla, Cent.
Province, Oct. 1884.
A small plant for this genus.
Tubers 1-1 i in.
long.
Leaf-blades 5-7 in.
long, the texture 
remarkably thin, of a bright light transparent green.
The flowering- 
scape and young tuft of leaves are on one and the same new axis, 
which is given off" laterally from the old root-stock.
Bracts about 
1 in.
long, pale green.
A single flower only is open at once in each 
spike, and as it stands up much above the bracts the scape appears 
at first sight to be one-flowered.
This species is allied to C.
alhiflora Thw., figured well in Bot.
Mag. t.
5909, and, like that, has no terminal tuft of empty bracts, 
as in the rest of the genus.
The texture of the leaves in C oliijaiit/ui 
is very unlike that of all other species of Curcuma.
I have no doubt that the fragmentary specunens (C.
P. 3700) 
from Auaradhapura mentioned by Thwaites (Enum.
p. 316j are to 
be referred to this species.

is doubtless the nearest ally of Mr.
Ford's trouvaille, which however differs, as shown by Blume's 
beautiful figure and analyses, "^^^ by the shape and extreme villosity 
of the middle lobe of the labellum, by the form of the leaves, and 
especially by the very remarkable raised plate over the alternate 
nerves, equally noticeable in the living and dry plant, nothing 
approaching which can I anywhere find recorded.
I am not aware that any species of Pogonia has hitherto been 
recorded from China, but I have a lovely species (§ Eupoyonia[ 
gathered in May 1881 on wet rocks near Wu hu, in the province 
of An liwei, at an altitude of 3000 feet, by Mr. Bullock, with bright 
scarlet flowers (according to the collector) an inch and more in 
length, and a fimbriate labellum.
Furthermore, the Eev. B.
C. 
Henry collected on the Lo fau shan range, in May 1883, at an 
elevation of 2500 feet and upwards, a plant which I am inclined to 
refer to P.
opliio(jlossuides Nutt.
(already known from Japan), though 
the blossoms are conspicuously smaller.
I may take the opportunity of stating that Mr. Ford has quite 
recently found very sparingly, on Mount Parker, Hongkong, a Vri/da//- 
zynea, which does not appear to differ from the Javanese V.

There can be no doubt, therefore,

Fruit and Seed of Eomecon chionantha.
— Although I have 
had this interesting plant in cultivation ever since its discovery, I 
have not been able to coax it to ripen fruit.
It has, however, set 
one or two this spring in the Hongkong Gardens, and I am 
indebted to the courtesy of Mr. Ford, the Superintendent, for the 
opportunity of examining one of these ; and am thus enabled to 
render the generic character more complete : — 
Capsula stipitata, oblonga, a basi usque ad apicem dehiscens, 
valvis placentas duas cum stylo persistente nudantibus.
Semina 
oblonga, testa Crustacea, pallide brunnea, in sicco tuberculata, 
raphe cristata.
Embryo minutus, juxta basin albuminis carnoso- 
oleosi, flaventis, situs.
It will be seen that Eomecon differs (so far as carpological 
characters are concerned) from Sangumaria only by the capsule- 
valves becoming free from the base and remaining attached at the 
apex, instead of the contrary mode of dehiscence, and by the seeds 
bei^g tuberculate and smooth.

ON THE CAULOTAXIS OF BEITISH FUMARIACEM.
By Thomas Hick, B.A., B.Sc.
The term "caulotaxis" is here used in the sense defined in a 
previous communication to this Journal,* viz.
, as a designation for the 
arrangement and relation of the central and lateral axes of a plant.
Every practical botanist is aware that plants exhibit some 
variety in their modes of branching, and that the relative positions 
of the main axis and the branches are often much modified as 
these parts pass from the rudimentary to the mature condition.
Of the latter fact examples are by no means difficult to meet with 
among British plants, though these are seldom or never referred to, 
even in our native text-books on Botanical Science.
Hence an 
account of the caulotaxis of British FianaiiacecE may not be without 
some interest, and may possibly afford a clue to the explanation of 
other and more complicated cases.

4. Young i^lant bearing its first inflorescence.
A convenient starting-point will be afforded by the following 
description of the axis of Corydalis claviculata, drawn up some time 
ago The specimen consisted of six internodes, which formed the 
terminal portion of one of the long slender shoots characteristic of 
this species.
As the specimen lay before me, the following points 
were noted : — At the Jirst node, i.e., the lowest on the specimen, 
there was a leaf on the le/t,\ and a peduncle bearing flowers 
* 'Journal of Botany,' Oct., 1882.
t It need hardly be said that the terms left and right, as used in this 
description i'or the successive leaves, are not to be taken strictly as indicating a 
distichous pliyllotaxis.

on the right, so that the inflorescence was what systematists term 
leaf-opposed.
At the second node there was a leaf on the rhjht, with 
a lateral branch in its axil ; the axillary branch terminated in three 
flowers, just below which was a leaf with an axillary branch of the 
second order.
At the third node the leaf was on the left, and opposite 
to it was a peduncle bearing flowers.
At ihefoxirth node there was 
a leaf on the left, with an axillary branch.
At WiQ fifth node the 
leaf was on the right, and a leaf-opposed peduncle on the left.
At 
the sixth node there was a, leaf on the right, and from this point the 
stem was continued into a peduncle with flowers, so that here the 
peduncle was terminal.
From this it appears that, in the specimen described, leaf and 
axillary branch alternated regularly with leaf and opposed peduncle.
Many other specimens subsequently examined exhibited essentially 
the same organisation, the inflorescences being invariably leaf- 
opposed, except at the apex of the shoots, where they are terminal.
We may take it, therefore, that there is some reason for regarding 
this as the typical arrangement of leaves, branches, and inflores- 
cences, and they may represent it diagrammatically as 'in Fig. 1.
Interpreting the arrangement on the same principles as were 
applied to the Geraniums,* it will be obvious that the long slender 
shoots of this plant are in reality pseiulaxes or sympodia, each one 
being made up of a series of successive lateral branches, which 
have become organised into a continuous axis.
The leaf-opposed 
peduncles are thus the terminal portions of each section of the 
pseudaxis, which have become pushed aside by the more vigorous 
growth of the lateral shoots.
Hence a rational view of the whole 
structure may be represented as in Fig. 2.
For descriptive purposes it will be convenient in future to speak 
of the sections of the pseudaxis as ^^ caulomeres,'' and to distinguish 
the caulomeres as uninodal, binodal, &c., according to the number 
of nodes they carry.
Those with more than three nodes may be 
termed multinodal.
Using this language, the shoots of the speci- 
mens referred to may be described as pseudaxes, built up of binodal 
caulomeres.
As stated, however, these were but the terminal 
portions of the shoots, and it became necsssary therefore to see 
whether the same structure obtained in the older parts.
For this 
purpose it was deemed best to have recourse to young plants, 
whose growth and development could be watched from the earliest 
stages until they reached maturity.
The results, which are sum- 
marised in the next paragraph, sliow that the formation of pseud- 
axes, in the way described, in'actically prevails over the whole 
plant, the chief point of diflerence being that in the older portions, 
one, two, or a few of the caulomeres are of a higher order than the 
binodal.
In germination the hypocotyl elongates more or less, and raises 
the cotyledons above the soil, where, as is usual among dicotyledons, 
they present themselves as a pair of simple, entire, opposite leaves 
(Fig. 3).
The leaves subsequently developed appear in pairs, which 
decussate regularly with one another, but the petioles of each pair 
* Loc. cit.
ON THE CAULOTAXIS OF BEITISH FUMAKIACEiE.

are not inserted at the same level.
The interval between them is 
scarcely perceptible at the base of the stem, but becomes consider- 
able at higher levels, where the opposite and decussate phyllotaxis 
becomes changed into an alternate one (Fig. 4).
This, it may be 
noted in passing, appears to be brought about by the elevation of 
one of the leaves of each pair, through unequal growth on opposite 
sides of the stem.
The number of nodes between the cotyledons 
and the first inflorescence varies in different seedlings, but is 
generally an even number — four, six, or eight.
In a few cases it 
appears to be odd, and may actually be so ; but this only occurs, so 
far as observation has gone, when the phyllotaxis at the first node 
above the cotyledons is strictly opposite.
In either case the first 
caulomere is multinodal.
After the first two or three, however, 
the caulomeres usually become binodal, and so remain throughout 
the whole length of the pseudaxis, except in some instances, where 
they change again near the apex and become uninodal.
Thus, as 
a rule, each adds two leaves and two internodes to the principal 
axis, and then runs out into an inflorescence.
The lower leaf of 
each often produces an axillary branch, whose organisation agrees 
with that of the principal axis, except that the basal caulomere is 
not of the same order in all cases.
As intimated above, therefore, 
the whole plant is built up of a series of pseudaxes, one of which 
constitutes the main axis, while the rest form the so-called lateral 
branches.
Moreover, the caulomeres are for the most part binodal, 
only the basal ones being of a higher order and the apical ones of a 
lower.
The other species of Corydalis included in British Floras, viz., 
C. solida and C.
lutea, are not regarded as true natives, though they 
are occasionally met with.
No opportunity of studying their 
development has presented itself, but an examination of herbarium 
specimens is instructive.
In C.
solida the stem is usually simple, 
consisting of but a single multinodal caulomere, which terminates 
in a racemose inflorescence.
Here, then, the organisation of the 
axis is reduced to its simplest form, and corresponds to that of the 
basal caulomere of C.
claviculata.
In C.
lutea the stem is more or 
less branched, but both principal and subordinate shoots are 
pseudaxes, built up of caulomeres, which, except at the base and 
the apex, are generally binodal.
Turning now to Fumaria, the other genus of the order, we find 
a caulotaxis in general agreement with that of Corydalis, though 
presenting minor modifications.
Complete specimens of F.
offici- 
nalis show that the phyllotaxis is at first opposite and decussate, 
but quickly becomes tetrastichous.
Between the foliaceous cotyle- 
dons and the first inflorescence eight leaves are often met with, 
though there is some variety in this respect.
Thus, the first caulo- 
mere is of a high order, but the rest are for the most part binodal, 
except at the apex, where they may become uninodal.
Fumaria 
capreolata is in close agreement with F.
ojlicinalis.
The only point 
that need be referred to is, that here the leaves display a greater 
tendency to produce two buds in their axils, instead of one.
When 
this occurs at a node which carries a leaf-opposed inflorescence, it

shows that the production of a second bud is a common feature at 
the other nodes also, where it occupies the same relative position, 
viz., betvi'een the Laf and the axillary shoot.
As might be expected, 
the subspecies !< .
confusa Jord.
agrees in the main with its type; 
and the same may probably be said of the subspecies F.
muralis 
Bonder., though further observations are necessary to remove the 
qualification.
Of the species F.
densifiora DC.
and F.
parviflora Lamk., only a 
few herbarium specimens have been examined, but these show both 
unanimity among themselves and conformity to the organisation of 
the species described.
Thus, throughout the whole of this order, 
as represented in the British Isles, a remarkable unity of organisa- 
tion prevails.
In all cases, save that of Corydalis solula, the main 
stem is a sympodium or pseudaxis, composed of binodal caulomeres, 
except in the basal region, where they are of a higher order, and 
often in the apical region also, where they become uninodal.

Je me suis propose de rediger un catalogue general qui a pour 
but d'etablir les affinites naturelles des especes du genre Carex.
Vu 
les difficultes nombreuses qui retardent I'achevement de ce travail, 
je crois etre utile a quelques botauistes qui cultivent ce genre en 
douuant, pour le moment, Tenumeration des especes d'Europe y 
compris les lies atlantiques : Azores, Madere, Canaries, dans leur 
groupement naturel tel que je I'entends.
Ce catalogue pourra 
servir a rectifier en quelques points la liste donnee par M.
Nyman, 
dans la 2™^ edition de son ' Conspectus Flor® Europtefe.' 
J'ai fais mention des especes douteuses pour attirer I'attention 
des botanistes sur ces formes.
Je saurais gre a ceux qui pourraient 
me commuiiiquer des specimens de ces formes critiques.*

C. vesicaria var.
alpif/ciia 
Fries is added as a synonym.
Wight's plant, of which there are specimens in 
the Herbarium of the British Museum, is intermediate between C.
vesicaria and 
C. pulla, being taller and with paler spikes than the latter.
It seems to be less 
frequent than C ^jtilla, or less frequently collected.
Hooker, in the ' Students' 
Flora,' ed.
iii., p.
4G4, makes both it and pulla subspecies of C.
vesicaria, which 
certainly seems the correct view to take of the male plants.

is represented in the British Museum by a sheet 
from the herbarium of Roemer and Schultes, on which are fastened two 
specimens of very young C.
tomentosu and a single specimen of C.
pnecox.
Tliis 
is labelled " Carex subinllosa, Tauria," in Bieberstein's handwriting.
The speci- 
mens of C.
tomoitosa do not show the fruit, which is ripe in C.
jyrcecox ; so that 
if this sheet really represents Bieberstein's subvillosa, the description of the fruit 
was probably taken from that of C.
pm'cox, and the species, being derived from 
an admixture of plants, must be expunged.

NOTES ON THE FLORA OF CEYLON.
By Henry Trimen, M.B., F.L.S.
{ Concluded from p.
245).
Amomuni Benthamianum Trim.
— Leaves lanceolate-linear, 
rather abruptly acuminate, smooth above, minutely puberulent 
beneath, sheaths and especially short rounded ligule rather densely 
covered with fulvous hairs ; peduncle from the rootstock slender, 
short ; spike capitate, very small, globose, dense ; bracts ovate, 
acute, thin, nearly glabrous ; flowers too imperfect in the specimen 
for examination ; capsule ovoid, f in.
long, blunt, not ribbed, 
copiously echinate, with irregular short curved spines.
Hab. Reigam Korle, Sept.
1864 (0.
P. 3864 in Hb. Perad.).
This C.
P. number is referred to by Bentham in ' Gen. Plant.,' iii., 
p. 645, under Amomimi as " species crista lata lobis 2 rotundatis 
cum intermedio triangular!
minore"; I regret that the only speci- 
men in the Herbarium here does not allow me to examine the 
flowers, but the characters of the fruit seem to show the plant to 
be distinct.
This species comes near to A.fiilviceps Thw., which has, how- 
ever, much larger heads, densely golden-tomentose bracts, and the 
anther-crest is semilunar and slightly bifid.
Cyanotis arachnoidea Clarke, var.
obtusa Trim.
— Large ; 
leaves of erect barren shoots numerous, densely placed, distichous, 
curved, bract-shaped but not keeled beneath, obtuse, subapiculate, 
glabrous or slightly floccose beneath and on the margins, bright 
rather glaucous green above, more or less purple beneath ; flowering- 
shoots coming ofl" from axils of former leaves on the rootstocks, 
long-trailing, stout and succulent, compressed below, afterwards 
cylindrical ; leaves oblong, like those of barren shoot but smaller, 
all glabrous or nearly so, except at the nodes, which are slightly 
cob webbed or silky-floccose ; spikes sessile or shortly stalked, in 
clusters of 4 or 5 in axils of upper leaves ; bracts falcate, acute, 
much imbricated, nearly glabrous outside, but with floccose hair

round the flowers within ; sepals ovate, acuminate, transparent, 
villous with delicate cottony hair ; petals ovate-spathulate, obtuse, 
the broad claws coherent, the blades spreading, pale bright violet- 
blue ; stamens equal, very much exserted, erect ; upper half of 
filaments covered with long moniliform spreading blue hairs ; apex 
dilated into a flask-shaped bulb with an attenuated point bearing 
the minute anther ; ovary truncate, covered with erect silky hair ; 
style precisely like the filaments of the stamens, and similarly 
terminated by a pointed bulb ; seeds dark brown, the testa covered 
with very numerous minute prominences.
Hab. On hot exposed rocks at Doluwe Kande, Kurunegala, 
and other low hills.
A rather striking plant, not devoid of beauty; 
the leaves of the barren shoots are 9-10 in.
long by 1:^ in.
wide, 
the flowering- branches trail to a great distance, and are usually 
entirely coloured an intense deep red-purple.
I had at first referred this to the widely- spread eastern species 
C. barhata Don, but afterwards named it C.
ohtusa, sp.
nov.
I am.
however, informed by Mr. Hemsley that it agrees with C.
arach- 
noidea Clarke, under which I here place it.
I have no authentic 
specimen of that species, which Mr. Clarke (Mon. Phan.
in.
250) 
gives as a native of the Ceylon mountains as well as of Peninsular 
India.
He also quotes for it Wight's figure of C.
pilosa (Ic. t.
2083), 
which is very unlike my plant.* I have, however, kept it as a 
variety under C.
araclmoiclea ; though from the type of this it differs 
considerably in its much larger size and much less wool, and in the 
filaments, like the style, being thickened at their summit into a 
bulk.
The forms of this group are most difficult to limit satis- 
factorily.
Phoenix zeylanica Trim.
— FAate sylvestris Linn, (pro maxima 
parte).
Plueidx sylvestris Thw.
(non Eoxb.).
— Stem erect, simple, 
rarely branched at the base, stout, reaching a height when full 
grown of 12, 14, or even more feet, but as usually seen much shorter, 
covered with the bases of the fallen leaves ; leaves rather short, 
the pinnte very numerous, not fasciculate, but nearly equally 
distant on the rachis, the lower ones reduced to strong sharp spines 
3-3^ in.
long, the rest lanceolate-linear, the largest 7-10 in.
long, 
conduplicate, very sharp-pointed, smooth, bright and shining, deep 
green, thick, rigid, distinctly 4-ranked, the ranks spreading nearly 
at right-angles, those pointing downwards set on obliquely with a 
twist at the base ; spathes sparingly covered with shaggy orange- 
coloured down.
Female floAvers : — Calyx somewhat truncate, half 
the length of the petals, strongly 3-toothed, not ribbed; petals 
rotundate, each with 2 staminal rudiments at the base; fruit ^-f in.
long, ovoid-oblong, apiculate, deep inky-purple when ripe, scarlet 
when half-ripe.

considered the same as the common and well-known wild Date of 
India, P.
sylvestris Eoxb.
It is, however, clearly distinguishable 
by its different habit, stouter trunk, shorter leaves, with more rigid, 
dark green, shining, non-fasciculate segments and black fruit.
It 
is a common plant in Ceylon, but is not known in South India save 
in the Botanic Gardens.
Tlie fruit has a scanty pulp, which is 
scarcely edible.
Linnaeus's original Elate sylvestris (Sp. Plant, i.
1189) was mainly based on this plant (= Fl. Zeylanica, n.
397), 
but he also quotes Kheede, ' Hort.
Malab.,' iii., tt.
22-25, which is 
probably the common Indian species.
Whether the other Ceylon 
Flucnuv, noted in a former part of this paper as P.
imsilia Gaertn., 
is truly a distinct species may be open to doubt, but both it and 
P. zeylanica are quite different from the yellow-fruited P.
sylvestris 
of India.* 
I have been accustomed for some years to call our Palm P.
zey- 
lanica, and the name has also been published for it in the List of 
Palms cultivated at Kew, printed as an appendix to the Eeport of 
that establishment for 1882.
Sir Joseph Hooker, who has made a 
careful study of the genus, is convinced of the distinctness of the 
Ceylon plant.
Calamus nivalis Thw. ms.
— Leaf-sheaths armed with copious 
large, straight, flat, yellow prickles, passing on the rachis beneath 
and at the sides into distant, solitary, recurved ones ; no terminal 
cirrhus ; rachis raised above, smooth ; segments numerous, closely 
placed, equidistant, broadly linear, tapering at both ends, with 3 
principal nerves and other intermediate ones, with a few distant 
scattered setae on the principal nerves beneath and at the apex ; 
spadix slender, elongated, set with hooked thorns, extended into a 
terminal thorny lorum, slightly branched; flowering branchlets 
usually short, numerous but not crowded, more or less stiffly 
recurved ; larger spathes prickly, smaller ones slightly so or 
smooth ; bracts ciliate ; male flowers crowded, with scanty fulvous 
scurf ; calyx cut half-way down ; petals and stamens raised on a 
stalk so that the former appear as long again as the calyx ; female 
flowers larger and less crowded ; corolla 3-toothed, fulvous- 
puberulous ; fruit f in.

Not a large species.
Leaves about 3 ft.
long, the longest segments about 9 or 10 ins., bright pale yellow- 
green.
A near ally of C.
tenuis Roxb., which differs in its general 
furfuraceous covering, smaller more distant and usually hermaphro- 
dite flowers on shorter branchlets, and nearly globular fruit with 
larger scales.
I am indebted to Mr. W.
Ferguson for fresh speci- 
mens in flower, collected about five miles from Colombo by the 
Koti Canal.
* Tlie liuit of this is, when ripe, 1 in.
long by ~ in.
wide, and of a dull 
purplish orange, having passed through in ripening a bright oransfe-chronie 
yellow ; the pulp is more copious, with a sweet flavour quite similar to that of 
the cultivated date.

Calamus ovoideus Thw. ms.
— Stem stout ; leaf-slieaths 
densely set with many close rings of broad, flat, often lacerate, 
deflexed black prickles ; racliis with deciduous down when young, 
concave above, the lateral ridges set with short sharp prickles, 
convex beneath, with distant solitary sharp rcflexed spines, 
becoming more numerous on the petiole, extending into a long 
cirrhus set with numerous closely-placed semicirclets of stout 
hooks ; leaflets equidistant, broadly linear, attenuate, many-nerved, 
the two principal ones (besides the midrib) with a few long weak 
setae on the upper surface ; apex bristly ; spadix branched, the 
lower spathes with stout deflexed hooks, the smaller ones smooth ; 
no lora ; flowers not seen ; fruit -^-^ in.
long, oblong-ovoid, beaked, 
tapering slightly at base, which is supported by the much enlarged 
persistent perianth ; scales numerous, small, furrowed down the 
centre, pale greyish yellow, very narrowly edged with orange-brown.
Hab. Safl'ragam District, Western Prov., 1866.
(C.

in Hb. Perad.).
Native name, " Tambutu-wel." A large species, 
a specimen of which is in the Botanic Garden ; leaves 14 ft.
long 
or more, of which 4 ft.
is occupied by the long tendril ; longest 
leaflets about 14 in.
long, bright shining apple-green above, duller 
beneath.
Judging from the fruit only, this species appears to be near C.
acantliospathus Grifi'.

Khasya, but the foliage of that plant is not described.
Cryptocoryne Beckettii Thw. ms.
— Petiole slender, from 
1^-3 times as long as the blade, sheathing at base ; blade lanceo- 
late-oblong, the base cordate or subauriculate, the apex subacute, 
entire, undulated, glabrous, minutely dotted above, 5-7-nerved, 
texture thin; spathe sessile, small; tube narrow, straight, glabrous, 
striate, scarcely contracted above the inflorescence ; blade small, 
not more than half as long as the tube, ending in a short tail ; 
stalk of male inflorescence shorter than it; female flowers (carpels) 
5 ; fruit not seen,

Kootstock small; petioles 4-8 in.
long; leaf- 
blades 2^-4 in.
; spathe sessile, not an inch long.
In some 
specimens (?
submerged) the leaves are larger and narrower than 
above described, and less cordate.
I have only herbarium specimens, and only one has an in- 
florescence, which is perhaps not fully matured.
The species is 
apparently near C.
cordata Grifi".
(Ic. t.
172), from which it diti'ers 
in its narrower and differently-veined leaves, sessile inflorescence, 
and shorter spathe.
Lagenandra insignis Trim.
— Leaves with long petioles, the 
blade oblong-oval, acute at both ends, especially at apex, glabrous 
above, closely dotted beneath ; midrib beneath very thick and pro- 
minent, and with the numerous close lateral veins rough or woolly 
with short harsh scurfy hairs or papillfe ; spathe very large, the 
tube short, funnel-shaped, the limb many times longer, expanded, 
thin in texture, crisped and undulated, suddenly narrowed into a 
short tail, the upper part falling over (like an Arisicma), glabrous.

Leaves 12 in.

This

the spathes dyed the drying-paper deep purple.
Boots were also 
brought for the garden, but have not yet flowered here.
Near the very common L.
toxicaria Dalz.
(= Arum ovatuni L.), 
but very distinct by the large purple drooping spathe ; the leaves 
are also well characterised by the peculiar indumentum of the veins 
beneath.
This adds a fifth species to this genus, all of which are 
natives of Ceylon, and four of them endemic here.
Eriocaulon fluviatile Trim.
— Submerged ; rhizome creeping, 
slender, flexuous, ascending at the end, attaining several inches in 
length, and emitting copious long roots ; leaves about 4 to 8, very 
long (8 to 10 in.), not closely inserted, very narrow (scarcely ^\ in.
wide), solid, compressed (oval or section), channelled along one 
face, flaccid, dark green, shining, gradually dilated at base into a 
membranous sheath lined with a cottony wool ; scape solitary, 
ai^parently terminal, rather shorter than the leaves, erect, stiff, 
slender, cylindrical ; basal sheath about h^ in.
long, loose but not 
dilated, smooth, thin, split down one side from the top for a short 
distance, free portion acute ; heads small (about J in.
diam.), 
depressed-globular ; involucral scales short, roundish-oval, entire, 
very obtuse, smooth, brown, floral ones linear-oblong, with coarse 
white hairs on the upper part ; flowers apparently dioecious, minute, 
densely crowded on the semiglobular receptacle ; female flowers 
with sepals and petals spathulate-linear, the latter narrower, 
pellucid, with scanty white hairs at top ; style deeply 3-cleft ; 
seeds smooth, pale orange ; male flowers not seen.
Hab. Plentiful in a quick-flowing stream (the Kappara-ela) now 
flowing into the reservoir at Labugama, West Prov., Jan. 1885; in 
company with Mr. AV.
Ferguson.
The plant is entirely submerged in 
the rapid current, only the heads of flowers being elevated above the 
surface ; it is abundant in the smaller tributaries, as well as the 
Kappara-ela main stream.
Mr. Ferguson had previously sent me 
specimens of this curious species collected in or near the same 
place in 1882, on the occasion of the Elephant Kraal held there in 
that year.
I also think that specimens in the Herbarium here (of 
leaves only) under C.
P. 3057, labelled "Galle and Hewesse," may 
be the same plant.
The only Indian species which seems to be allied at all closely 
to this is E.
DalzeUii Koern.
{E.
rivulare Dalz.), from Western 
India.
But this, as described in Kew Journ.
Bot. iii.
p. 280, has 
the stem densely leafy, the leaves flat, 1 line broad, 7 -nerved and 
much shorter, the scapes umbellate-congested and only twice as 
long as the leaves, and the involucral bracts lacerate.
IsACHNE ATjSTRALis E.
Br., var.
EFFUSA Trim.
— Differs from the 
type, as seen in Ceylon, in its larger size, much broader, more 
compound panicle 3-5 in.
long, with the branches more horizontal 
and the flowers on longer pedicels, and quite glabrous glumes.

The name was

185) bestowed on the Ceylon plant 
mentioned by Brown when he published the genus Isachne as being 
a member of it (Prod.
Fl. Nov.

196).
The specimen is in 
Hermann's herbarium, and is alluded to by Linnaeus in ' Flora 
Zeylanica' under No. 43.
Mr. Ridley, of the British Museum, has 
kindly examined the original, and informs me that it is precisely 
C. P.
880 (i.e., /.
aiistralis).
The Sinhalese name " Meneri-tana" 
(tana = grass) is, however, erroneously applied to this by Hermann ; 
it rightly belongs to two species of Fanicum — P.
iiiiliare and P.
psilopodinm — which are commonly cultivated as dry grains in the 
low country.
Panicum reticulatum Thw. ms.
— A large, erect, perennial 
grass, 3-6 ft.
or more in height ; leaf-sheaths strongly hispid with 
bristly hairs ; nodes silky ; blade linear, rather long, somewhat 
hispid beneath near the base; ligule short, erect, jagged-ciliate ; 
panicle very large and compound, the branches long, erect or 
ascending, the lower in tufts not verticillate, all flexuous and 
rough ; spikelets rather scattered and distant, on slender pedicels, 
under ^ in.
long, acuminate, glabrous ; outer glume subacute, not 
half the length of the spikelet, broad, 5-nerved, somewhat gibbous; 
2nd and 3rd glumes subequal, very concave, apiculate, with a hard 
tip, 7-9-nerved, all three similar in texture, membranous, olive- or 
purplish-green, the parallel nerves connected mostly in the upper 
part by 2-4 short transverse ones forming a loose reticulation, the 
3rd glume with a rather large empty membranous palea in its axil ; 
flowering-glume not much shorter, smooth and shining ; grain 
plano-convex, hard, smooth and polished, bright ochre-yellow.
Hab. Borders of paddy-fields, Hewessee, Pasdun Korle, Aug.
1865 (C.
P. 3890 in Herb.
Perad.) ; Culloden Estate, near Kalutara, 
1881, W.
Fenjusun.
A large handsome species, attaining a great 
size, and with very hispid sheaths when grown in a garden at 
Colombo.
The arrangement of the spikelets and branching of the 
panicle is somewhat similar to those of the universally cultivated 
"Guinea Grass," F.
maxivmm L., to which indeed the present 
species is allied.
I am informed by Mr. Hemsley that this species is also in 
Herb.
Kew from Malacca (Grifiith) and from the Philippines 
(Cuming 652 & 1667).
The latter specimens are named by Ben- 
tham and Munro "P.
cccsium Hk.
& Arn. ex Nees"; but Mr.
Hemsley points out that they are quite distinct fi'om the Macao 
plant so named by Hk.
& Arn. in Bot. Beechey's Voy. p.
235, 
which is clearly a species of the Fchinochloa group.
Steudel has 
copied their description (Syn. p.
47) under "P.
cccsium Nees (in pt.)," 
272 NOTES ON THE FLORA OF CEYLON.
and the locality given for this is "Ceylon." Under these circum- 
stances I believe our plant to require a name, and I now leave it 
under Thwaites' very appropriate appellation, though in the list of 
additional C.
P. numbers at the commencement of this paper I have 
given it as P.

Panicum.
blephariphyllum Trim.
— Leaf-sheaths smooth or 
the upper ones with scattered spreading bristly hairs ; ligule 
obsolete ; blade broadly linear, gradually tapering to apex, broad 
semi-amplexicaul and auricled at the base, closely veined, thin, flat, 
glabrous on both sides, the margin furnished with long, fine, 
straight, spreading, stiff cilia from small bulbous bases ; panicle 
long-stalked, 8-10 in.
long; branches solitary or two together, 
scattered, ascending, rough, slightly branched, with a tuft of long 
hairs at base ; spikelets stalked, solitary, about |- in.
long ; lowest 
glume more than three-fourths the length of the spikelet, strongly 
apiculate, broad, normally 3-nerved, the nerves strongly scabrous ; 
2nd glume acuminate-cuspidate, with central midrib and a pair of 
closely-placed nerves on either side, smooth ; 3rd glume rather 
shorter, acute, similarly veined, with a male flower in axil ; 
flowering-glume about half the length of 3rd, obtuse, thick.
Hab. Euanwelle, Western Prov., Nov. 1883, Mr. W.
Ferguson.
Very near P.
Leptochloa Nees (C.
P. 918), especially in the 
spikelets, which scarcely differ save in being rather longer and less 
crowded, and with somewhat broader glumes.
Both belong to that 
group of Panicum in which the lowest glume approaches the others 
in length.
P. Leptochloa is, however, a more slender grass ; and 
its leaves are narrow and rigid, and not or but very slightly dilated 
at the base ; nor have they the marked ciliation of the margin.
I notice that the lowest glume is very frequently 4-nerved, and 
then somewhat unsymmetrical.
Dimeria laxiuscula Thw. ms.
— Perennial, tufted ; stems 
erect, rather slender, 2-3 ft.
high, scarcely branched ; nodes with a 
thick tuft of white silky hair ; leaf- sheaths smooth in lower, hairy 
in upper part ; blade narrow, linear, erect, strongly keeled, more or 
less hairy on both sides, and long-ciliate on margin ; ligule short, 
truncate ; spikes 5-10, 3-4 in.
long, slender ; spikelets small, 
shortly stalked, each with a short tuft of silky hair at the base, 
much flattened ; lowest glume linear, very acute, strongly con- 
duplicate, with loug cilia on the keel below ; 2nd glume longer, 
almost aristate, with hyaline margins, glabrous but for a few long 
hairs on the back above ; 3rd glume much shorter, hyaline and 
transparent ; terminal glume hyaline, deeply bifid, and with a bent 
arm four times its length ; stamens 2.

Teinostachyum P maculatum Trim.
— Densely tufted ; 
rhizome much and intricately branched, the short curved branches 
clothed with thin yellow or brown scales ; culms closely placed, 
attaining about 25 ft.

sheaths lax, striate, smooth, auricled at top, the auricles angular 
and provided with a few long filiform deciduous appendages ; 
flowers not seen.
Hab. Forming jungle in several places in the districts of 
Ambagamua, Ruanwelle, and regions to the south-west of Adam's 
Peak.
The specimens described were collected on Galbodde Tea 
Estate, Ambagamua, Dec. 1883, by Mr. C.
J. Ferguson.
A gre- 
garious bamboo, the slender stems rising erect for 8 or 10 ft.
and 
then commencing to di'oop, the straggling upper branches requiring 
support and becoming subscandent, as is the case with many other 
small bamboos, e.g., Anindinaria debilis and Teinostaclujum attenu- 
atum.
In the absence of flowers and fruit it is of course impossible 
to refer this with good reasons to any established geims.
The 
native name is "Rama Batali," the latter word being the name of 
the very common Ochlanclra stridula, the small bamboo which 
covers hundreds of square miles of country in the south and west 
of Ceylon.
The history of the detection of this very pretty species here is 
rather curious.
It resulted from the exhibition, at a show held by 
the Agri-horticultural Society of Colombo, in August, 1883, of some 
light furniture, boxes, &c., cased with the mottled stems split and 
varnished.
I at once recognised these as distinct from any recorded 
species in Ceylon, and on enquiring of the native gentleman, Mr.
P. de Saram, exhibiting them, was inform d of its Sinhalese name, 
and that it was not uncommon on the southern slopes of the 
Adam's Peak Mountains.
Mr. W.
Ferguson afterwards learnt that 
it also grew near Ruanwelle, and on a visit thither in November 
was able to confirm the report.
It has since been collected in 
other places ui the same climatic district of Ceylon, and plants are

now growing in the Botanic Gardens.
It is indeed remarkable that 
so characteristic a bamboo, and one so well known to the natives, 
should have remn-'ied quite unnoticed by the numerous collectors 
and botanists who have been over the country during the past fifty 
years.
It is much to be hoped that flowering specimens may be 
obtained, as it may not improbably form a new genus of Bambusem.
Trichomanes Wallii Thw. ms.
— Fronds simple, ^ to nearly

Hab. Stones and tree-trunks in the stream running through 
the Labugama Elephant Kraal, March, 1870, collected with masses 
of T.
muscoides by Mr. W.
Ferguson (C.
P. 3989 in Herb.
Perad.).
Khizome very slender ; fronds not crowded, subsessile.
Very near T.
Motley i V.
de B., and perhaps not more than a 
variety of it, but distinguishable by the sunken not exserted 
involucres.
The shape of the fronds varies ; the ones bearing fruit 
are less cordate, or even tapering at the base.
The name T.
Wallii Thw. has been published in Mr. W.
Ferguson's pamphlet, 'Ceylon Ferns' (Colombo, 1880), preface, 
and in Mr. G.
Wall's ' Check List.' It is not mentioned in Col.
Beddome's 'Handbook' (1883).

In July last I made a special search for Car ex tomentosa in the 
water meadows of Marston Measey, but without success.

A meadow at Marston showed Blysmus cornpressus as one of the 
commonest ingredients in its vegetation, Iris acoriformis is the 
common Iris of the Upper Thames, and, judging from immature 
specimens, negleetum is the common Sparganiuvi.
Bromus raccmosus 
is a frequent meadow-grass.
Rosa mollis is common above Bampton, in Oxon, and stretches 
into both Wilts and Gloucester, as above stated.
On the stiff 
Oxford Clay at Bampton R.
canina seemed very variable, as it does 
on Otmoor, in Oxon, and as there the Faihi were almost confined to 
R. discolor and R.
corylifolius.
A Festuea form from Marston and Lechlade, and also from 
Oxon, is worth further study; it is the same form as the one 
gathered on Brean Down by Dillenius, and referred to in the 
' Eichardson Correspondence.'

A CLASSIFICATION OF GAEDEN EOSES.
By J.
G. Baker, F.E.S.* 
A GOOD general monograph of the genus Rosa is needed.
Lindley's 'Monograph' was published in the year 1820, and since 
then a great number of new species have been discovered, and a 
very large number of books and papers have been written bearing 
upon the subject in one way or another.
The difficulty which one 
finds at the outset in using Lindley's book is that his primary 
groups are characterised so briefly, and that the points of contrast 
which they present are not fully and clearly brought out into view.
The following key shows the best way of getting over these diffi- 
culties which, after having had a large number of specimens 
through my hands during the last thirty years, I am able to 
suggest.
The list of species is only intended to be exhaustive so 
far as garden roses are concerned, with the addition of a few well- 
marked types not yet brought into cultivation.
What I have aimed 
* From the ' Gardeners' Chronicle,' August 15th, 1885, p.
199.
282 A CLASSIFICATION OF GARDEN ROSES, 
at is to give a separate number to well-marked types only, and to 
place under these the subspecies and varieties into which they 
deviate.
Of course I am well aware that in liusa, of all genera, 
even if independent observers work from the same standing-point, 
it is not in the least likely that any two of them will draw the line 
between species and subspecies in the same way.
What follows 
must therefore be taken as a rough draft of a very condensed guide 
to the determination and classification of the garden types.

TWO NEW BRITISH PLANTS.
By H.
N. Ridley, M.A., F.L.S.
(Plates 261, 262.) 
The persevering efforts of our British botanists in the North 
have again been rewarded by the discovery of two S2)ecies of 
Cyperacea not hitherto recognised as belonging to our flora.
Tliese 
are ScJuenus fernujineus L., obtained by Mr. James Brebner in 
Perthshire, and Carex salina var.
kattegatensis Fries, found by Mr.
J. Grant in Caithness.
Of the genus ScJmnus only two species occur in the North 
Temperate Zone, viz., S.
nigricans L.
and S.
femtgineus L., the 
bulk of the species, upwards of sixty in niimber, being natives 
of Australia and New Zealand.
The first-named species has 
the widest range of any in the genus, extending from Sinai to 
Western North America, and occurring also in the Cape of Good 
Hope.
Sclucnus ferrugineus is of a much more limited distribution, 
being entirely confined to Europe, and by no means universally 
distributed even there.
It is found, however, sparingly over the 
whole continent from Scandinavia to South Russia, excluding the 
extreme north and south, being apparently absent from the Spanish 
Peninsula, Italy, and France, with the exception of the Jura.
Its 
habitat, like that of the other species, seems to be open peaty 
moors, often, especially in Southern Europe, at a considerable 
altitude.

— This is a peculiarly interesting 
addition to our flora, on account of its distribution.
The whole of 
the section to which it belongs, the Maritwm of Nyman, are plants 
very characteristic of Arctic sea-shores, descending a little further 
south here and there along the coasts or on the mountains in the 
colder parts of Europe and North America.
C. salina Walil.
is 
perhaps the commonest of the section, and is a very variable plant, 
on account of which it has received a very extensive synonymy.
Boott.
(Illustr.

160) classified the varieties and divided 
them into the tall typical form, and the variety minor, including all 
the smaller forms with narrower and slenderer leaves and culms, 
and fewer often sessile spikelets ; but he remarks that the two 
vai'ieties pass gradually into each other.
Besides varying in these 
points, there is great variation in the length and scabridity of the 
mucro in the female glumes, whence arose Wahlenberg's vars.
cuspidatd Sind nuitica ; also in the number of stigmas, some speci- 
mens having two and some three, and in the colour of the glumes.
In the very reduced forms, subspathacea, reducta, &c., the glumes 
are quite pale-coloured, as is often the case in high Arctic 
glumaceous plants ; while in some of the taller forms from further 
south, e.<i., Massachusetts, the southern parts of Scandinavia, and 
the Caithness locality, the glumes are very dark in colour, forming 
the varieties luematolepis, hdttegatensis, &c.

NOTES ON THE INOCULATION OF FISHES WITH 
SAPROLEGNIA FERAX* 
The following notes are extracts from Keports made from time 
to time by Mr. G.
Murray to Prof.
Huxley.
They have special 
reference to the trausmissibility of the disease : — 
I. 
" On February 2nd, 1882, I received from Prof.
Huxley several 
flies covered with Saproleynia ferax, which had been obtained by 
him from a diseased Conway salmon in the previous December.
The cultivation of this fungus was continued, and four inoculations 
were made with it on Sulnio ferox during July, but without success.
" Oogonia and oospores were found in the cultivations for the 
first time on January 31st, 1883, very nearly a year from the time 
I obtained it, and after fourteen months of cultivation, during 
which period a constant and almost daily watch had been kept on it.
" With this fungus, of which the zoosporangia and oospores 
were plentifully ripe, I attempted the inoculation of two healthy 
specimens of Salmo ferox (February 1st) and two healthy dace

(February 19th), by rubbing the top of the fish's head with a fly on 
which the fungus was growing.
In the case of one Sahno ferox a 
very shght abrasion of the epidermis over the region referred to had 
been previously made by gently rubbing it with fine sand.
" Again no result followed these experiments, and on March 2nd 
they were repeated on the same two dace, this time by rubbing 
(without previous abrasion) the left side of the fish midway between 
the gills and the tail-fin.
The change in the region rubbed was 
made in consequence of the observation that on nearly all the 
diseased dace I had seen the part named was commonly the first 
affected, the right side equally with left.
On March 5th each of 
these fish had a small tuft of what was afterwards found to be 
SaproU'i/nid fera.v growing on the region of inoculation, and by 
March lOtli it had grown to a large patch.
On this day one of the 
fisii escaped from the water, and when found was lying dead close 
to the vessel in which it had been confined.
It then bore a similar 
appearance to the other, as regards the progress of the disease.
The other died on March 16th, its body being nearly covered with 
a luxuriant growth of Saprolenniaferax, the oospores of which were 
present, but sparingly.
" Of the eight unsuccessful experiments half had been made 
before the appearance, and half in the presence, of oospores.
Since, however, none had been successfully made in the absence of 
oospores, I determined to enquire if that affected the possibility of 
infection.
Two healthy dace were therefore rubbed, on March 26th, 
over the same region as in the successful cases, with Saprolegnia 
ferax, on which neither oogonium nor oospore could be found, the 
zoosporangia being plentiful, however, and numerously ripe.
In 
both cases the experiment was successful, and indeed the activity 
of the disease appeared to be greater from the fact that one fish 
succumbed in ten days and the other in fourteen.
" In the case of the fish which died on the tenth day the body 
was nearly covered with the fungus, but in the case of the other 
which died on the fourteenth day the disease was confined to one 
side, extending from the mouth over the gills down to the tail-fin, 
both sides of which, however, were badly affected.
" On both fishes, contrary to my expectation, oospores were 
more numerous than on those individuals which had been inoculated 
with oospore-bearing material." 
II.
" In continuation of the inoculation experiments with Sapro- 
ler/nid fenix made last year on the dace, I have begun a fresh series 
this time on fishes belonging to the Salnionidcc, and the results are 
briefly as follows: — 
"The agent used in all the inoculations was Saprolet/niti fcrax, 
directly continued by cultivation from the fungus obtained by Prof.
Huxley in December, 1881, from a diseased Conway salmon.
These 
cultivations have been maintained since then on the fly, and 
observed almost daily.
The fungus of this stock, if it may be so 
termed, was used last year in the inoculation experiments on the 
304 NOTES ON INOCULATION OF FISHES WITH SAPROLEGNIA FERAX.
dace, and it has at different times been observed to grow freely on 
pieces of bladder, young cockroaches, and a variety of other hosts.
In the autumn of last year oospores were formed on it within a 
week of their corresponding appearance in the previous year,* — 
and this year they were first detected on January 29th, two days 
before their first occurrence last year.
" The first inoculation experiment of the present series was 
begun on February 1st, when oospores were few in number.
The 
fish was a healthy Salmo fario, and the inoculation was made (as 
in all following cases) by rubbing several Hies bearing the fungus 
on the top of the fish's head without any abrasion of the epidermis.
The disease was first observed on the fourth day in the form of a 
patch of numerous short filaments on the region rubbed.
From 
this it extended gradually, and the fish (as in all other cases 
described here) showed symptoms of irritation, followed after a 
time by languid movements, and finally died on the fourteenth day 
after inoculation, February 15th.
On February 12th another 
inoculation was made, the conditions being precisely the same as 
the last, except in this respect — that the fungus used bore many 
oospores, but very few ripe zoosporangia.
No appearance of 
successful inoculation followed, and on the 20fch, after I had given 
up all hope of any result, I went to Scotland for a fortnight, leaving 
the fish in an apparently healthy state.
Eeturning on March 6th, 
I was surprised to find it extensively diseased, and in fact dying.
It died on the following day — three weeks and two days after 
inoculation.
A few oospores were found on the fungus growing on 
the fish, as sometimes occurs in other cases.
I may venture to put 
forward here a supposition, which seems to me to throw light on 
this case.
The material used was, as already mentioned, rich in 
oospores, but bearing few ripe zoosporangia.
I have frequently 
observed oospores germinate in ' hanging drop ' cultivations after a 
period of about a fortnight.
Supposing this inoculation was effected 
by the product of oospores germinating after such a period, the 
remaining time was sufficient for the development of the fungus to 
the condition observed on my return.
Most unfortunately, and to 
my great regret, I left no arrangements for having the fish watched 
and its appearance noted, as I had quite given up hope of result 
from the experiment, and in the absence of evidence this supposition 
is ventured.
"At an early period of the late Fisheries Exhibition a consider- 
able number of fish died in the aquarium from the disease, and this 
was coincident with the presence of much lime in the water from 
the newly-constructed artificial rockwork.
To determine the part 
played, if any, by lime in the water in cases of disease, Prof.
Huxley 
suggested to me certain experiments, of which the following is the 
result : — 
" On March 7th two healthy S.
fario were inoculated in the 
manner just described.
In both cases the disease appeared on the 
third day, progressed in the fashion described, and the fishes died, 
* In a cultivation of different origin.

305 
the one on the twelfth day, the other on the fifteenth day, after 
inoculation.
At the same time the experiment was extended to two 
other healthy S.
J'ario, and the only difference made was that, in 
the latter case, the fishes were supplied with water containing about 
half per cent, of lime-water added.
Here, again, the disease 
appeared on the third day on both fishes, but on the eighth day 
they died, not so extensively diseased as those in ordinary water — 
the fungus infesting them being in amount almost equal to that on 
the fishes of the corresponding experiment after the same period of 
time.
They died soon after the beginning of what may be called 
the time of languid movements.
Before these inoculations were 
made newly-killed flies were rubbed on the mucous coating of all 
the fish, and these flies were then placed in cultivation by them- 
selves, some in ordinary water and others in the water containing 
lime from the supply-cistern.
On none of these flies did Suprulcgnia 
appear, but in a few days they were covered with a common mould 
— just as has happened in all my attempts to obtain Suprolegnia by 
simply placing flies in water (whether ordinary water or water con- 
taining lime), though this method has succeeded in the hands of 
many other observers in other places.
" A fresh attempt was then made on March 15tli with a more 
convenient arrangement of tanks, the subject of experiment this 
time being young salmon hatched in the Fisheries Exhibition.
These fish were, or rather, I should say, are — since they are still 
alive, except one — parr, beginning to lose their spots.
They were 
all perfectly healthy in appearance.
Three of them were placed in 
each of the four tanks — two tanks supplied with ordinary water, 
and two with water containing lime, this time about \ per cent.
The three in one tank fi-om each of the pairs of tanks were 
inoculated, the two other tanks remaining untouched as check 
experiments (in all cases a similar arrangement has been made) ; 
and, after a slight appearance of the fungus on inoculated fishes 
living inider both conditions, the promise of success was not 
fulfilled, and by March 20tli they were all apparently healthy again.
Similar cultivation experiments with flies rubbed as before on the 
fish previous to inoculation were made, and again there was no 
result.
On March 20th the whole of the experiment of the 15th 
was repeated on the same fishes.
The slight appearance of the 
disease followed as before, gradually diminishing, and has dis- 
appeared except in three cases — two in ordinary water and one in 
water containing lime.
One of these fishes I have killed, and 
examination shows a slight development of the fungus, more in 
the epidermis than externally ; and the others remain, giving some 
promise of success.
A negative result was again obtained with the 
flies rubbed before inoculation.
" I should state that in all successful cases the disease has first 
appeared on the region of inoculation, and from there it has spread 
not always continuously ; sometimes an outbreak has occurred on 
a new place, most frequently on the tail.
The time from inocula- 
tion to death corresi^onds with the periods in the cases of inoculated

(except, of course, extreme beat and cold) that I am not at present 
disposed to attach much value to their influence in cases of in- 
oculation, and certainly nothing has yet been observed of any value 
in this direction.
The water containing lime was prepared in a 
cistern from which a supply-pipe led to two tanks bifurcating, and 
thus serving each from the same source.
" These experiments at least furnish starting-points for fresh 
experiments, from which it is to be hoped some light may be 
obtained as to the influence of the presence of lime." 
III.
' ' During the latter part ot spring and the early summer of last 
year a considerable number of the fish inhabiting the tanks in the 
Fish Culture Museum suffered from the attacks of Saprole<jnia.
The young salmon, which had been hatched in the Fisheries 
Exhibition and reared in the Fish Culture Museum, sufl^ered most, 
and nearly all of those attacked died.
This outbreak was entirely 
unexpected, and, considering the circumstances under which it 
took place, its origin was at first inexplicable.
The water in which 
the fish in question were living came from the same source as that 
which had a great number of times undergone the test of immersing 
flies in it without these showing a sign of the growth of Sapro- 
legnia.
I applied this test again to water taken before it entered 
the tanks, and the supply remained as pure as before ; while, as 
would be expected, water from the tanks themselves yielded Sapro- 
legnia readily.
It was thus made certain that the disease was not 
conveyed to the fish through the water supply, and the next 
direction enquiry took was to ascertain if by any means the disease 
had been communicated to these fish from those in adjoining tanks, 
which were the subject of inoculation experiment.
Careful enquiry 
brought no result.
The experiments were being conducted in an 
isolated manner, and the landing-nets, &c., used in the capture and 
handling of diseased fish had never been employed in other tanks.
In my difficulties Prof.
Huxley, foreseeing that the result of such 
an enquiry could not fail to be instructive, encouraged me to 
prosecute it, and suggested that the food given to the fish might 
be the vehicle of the infectious material.
A consideration of this 
enabled us to pitch upon the earthworms used for this purpose as 
most likely to yield result.
Several of these were intercepted 
while being conveyed to the tanks for food, and were placed under 
cultivation.
After the lapse of two days the Sajyrolegnia un- 
mistakably showed itself, and, though comparison satisfied me of 
the identity of this fungus with that of the disease, the matter was 
put to absolute proof by using this fungus as the agent of inocula- 
tion in the final successful experiment recorded last year.
Exami- 
nation disclosed the presence (in two cases) of oospores in the 
earthy contents of the worms, and these, I believe, were the 
oospores of Saprolcgnia.
I never succeeded in finding any worm at 
large on which the Saprolcgnia was growing, and, though the 
ground was damp, I was sufficiently surprised to find alive even 
the resting- state of this purely aquatic fungus, since desiccation at 
NOTES ON INOOUIiATION OF FISHES WITH SAFROLKGNIA FERAX.

an ordinary temperature soon kills it.
The fact that I ceased to 
find worms bearing Saprolegnla as the summer advanced I attribute 
to the great dryness which resulted from the exceptionally hot 
weather.
" The immediate cause of the outbreak having been thus 
ascertained, the grave question remained, — where did the earth- 
worms obtain the SaproUytda ?
I procured worms from various 
parts of the country, including the neighbourhood of a river [the 
Tweed] which contained diseased fish, and on none of these could 
Saprolegnia be reared without inoculation.
I continued to find it 
on earthworms — though not on all — procured from a piece of waste 
ground adjoining the Fish Culture Museum, and it soon became 
notable that worms only from a certain region (a few yards in 
diameter) of this ground yielded the fungus.
It could never be 
found on those dug up in the adjacent grounds of the Natural 
History Museum.
Now, over the particular region indicated there 
were lying a number of fish-bones, which at once aroused curiosity.
The remarkable results obtained by M.
Pasteur in his observations 
on earthworms as carriers of infectious material suggested a clue 
to the way out of the difficulty, though I was unwilling to believe, 
as 1 am now, that this aquatic fungus could maintain life for any 
length of time in the ground.
However, the discovery that the 
bones just mentioned belonged to certain fish which had died in the 
tanks erected by the Fisheries Exhibition Commissioners, and had 
been so cast out there a few months before, seemed to point in the 
direction which my suspicions took.
Mr. Edon (to whom I am 
much indebted for assistance throughout this enquiry) informed 
me, however, that to the best of his knowledge worms for food 
were never dug up in that particular place, and its appearance bore 
out his belief.
Matters remamed for some time in this unsatisfactory 
position, until, in going over the ground one day, I observed a 
labourer digging in the very region which had been infected.
On 
questioning him he succeeded in remembering having once or twice 
in rainy weather earlier in the year obtained his worms from there.
(It was near shelter.) The agreement thus established forces upon 
me the conclusion that the infectious material was obtained from 
the dead fish cast out, — that during the damp weather it remained 
alive in its resting-state, and was spread abroad in the ground by 
earthworms, and that it was finally conveyed by them into the 
tanks where the outbreak took place.
Later in the year, as 
described, this source of infection was dried up, while the outbreak 
was stopped by the precautions Mr. Edon took in his treatment of 
the fish.
" Towards the end of November a species of Bictyuclnis hitherto 
unknown to me began to appear along with the Saprulci/nia in the 
cultivations.
It rapidly increased in power, and in the course of a 
few days obtained complete possession ; and the Sajirolc<i)tia, which 
had first been placed in cultivation three years before (all but a few 
days) by Prof.
Huxley entirely disappeared.
The suddenness and 
completeness with which it was driven from the field were highly 
impressive, as well as not a little annoying after a period of 
808 HEPATIC^ OE SUFFOLK.
attention to it of so long duration.
However, the circumstance 
had its signiticance, in exhibiting the existence of a powerful 
competition with the Saproliujnia.
Whence did it come ?
"What 
influence does it exert at large on this disease of fishes m thus 
driving it from its stronghold in the bodies of insects, &c., in 
water ?
Especially, what is its action on the skin of fishes ?"

In common with several other counties in the East of England, 
Sufiblk has no hills worthy of the name, the air is dry, and the 
rainfall but scanty.
Hence we need not be suriarised that this 
family is represented by few species, and even these occur but 
sparingly.
The only common species are Fndlania dilatata and Radula 
complanata, on trees ; Marchantia polyviorpha, C'onocephalus conicus, 
and Fellia epiplujUa, on sides of streams, &c.

By H.
N. Kidley, M.A., F.L.S.
Among the plants recently collected by M.
Leon Humblot in the 
Comoro Islands occurs a species of this genus, which appears as 
yet to be undescribed.
The genus is typically characteristic of the 
East African archipelago, occurring also on the mainland.
It is 
remarkable for its copious and long roots, absence of leaves, 
excepting for a few sheaths upon the stem, and minute flowers.
The present species, in its long slender stem and very small flowers, 
approaches G.
ciphyUa Eich., but the spur is cylindrical, tapering 
gradually to a point, which, with the narrow petals, distinguish it 
clearly from the rest of the genus.
The roots are slightly flattened, 
somewhat rough, and fewer than in G.

to find Polygonum maritiiimm growing near Dawlish beside P.

My friend Mr.

Eediscovery of Eeiophorum gracile in Surrey.
— In June last 
I met with this rare cotton-grass in a bog in the basin of the River 
Blackwater, where, though very local, it was fairly abundant.
Some notes on its habitat may be interesting.
The plant is 
entirely confined to the wettest parts of the bog, growing, in peaty 
water, among Sphagmim.
and the roots and stems of the various 
bog plants, two or three feet about the peat itself.
Although the 
roots, which proceed from the base of the flower-stem and from the 
fascicle of leaves which terminates the stolon, are longish, as 
described by Mr. Townsend (Fl. Hants), they do not seem to reach 
the peat below, and the plant a^Dpears to live entirely among the 
moss.
It does not occur even on wet peat, and would evidently be 
quite unable to exist on the comparatively dry peat which often 
sufiices for its allies ; thus its disappearance on the approach of 
drainage is explained.
The spikes, when in bud, and stolons, arc 
much more slender than those of angustij'olium, the former being

elliptic, and of a beautiful grass-green colour.
It will be seen 
from these notes that the term undenj round , as applied to the 
stolons, does not correctly describe the Surrey plant, though this 
would, of course, not be apparent even in the fresh specimens 
from which Mr. Townsend"s description was drawn.
It has long 
been extinct in the Wliitemoor Common station, whence a speci-

last record known to me of its occurrence there, — W.

"Wiltshire Plants (see p.
274).
— Mr. Druce's unsuccessful 
search for Carex tnmentosa at Marston Maisey goes to prove that 
this species has at least become extremely rare there.
I have had 
repeated hunts after it myself, always in vain, the last being towards 
the close of the June of this year.
Even so, I can hardly bring 
myself to believe in the entire extermination — through the partial 
draining of the water-meadows— of this particular Carex in a spot 
where some dozen of its congeners still continue to flourish.
The 
fact, however, remains that for some years past the plant has not 
been found there.
I observe Mr. Druce records Chara hispida from 
the neighbouring canal.
I also observed it there on my last visit, and 
have never seen it there before, though I have frequently botanised 
along the banks, from which I conclude that it does not apj)ear 
every season.
As Mr. Druce states.
Iris acoriformis Bor. is the 
prevalent form there, but I noted true Pseudacorus in ditches near 
Marston Maisey Village (Wilts).
I think it probable the immature 
SiKtryaninm he mentions as most likely neylectam would turn out to 
be merely ramosmn.
A month ago I believed our Woodchester 
plant to be the former, so like did its young fruit seem to the figure 
in ' Journal of Botany.' However, as it gradually ripens, I find 
that it is showing itself to be, day by day more clearly, nothing 
but ramosiim.

Mr. Ford, who is now in this country, 
called my attention to the fact ; and, when he sent the specimens 
to Kcw, he wrote mentioning that the plant had been published by 
Dr. Hance, though he did not remember the name for the moment ; 
but that letter was not before me at the time I described the plants.
It is, however, quite inexcusable on my part to have overlooked 
Dr. Hance's published description, especially as I have access to 
Mr. Forbes' s references to all the plants described by the former.
In extenuation I may add that my description includes the male 
inflorescence, which was unknown to Dr. Hance.

Dictionary of the Names of British Plants.
Intended for the use of 
amateurs and beginners, as a help to the knowledge of the 
meaning and pronunciation of the scientific names of British 
wild flowers.

London : 
Bailliere.

When the author began the study of botany, he " experienced 
a great want in the absence of a book dealing with the names of 
flowers." It is to be regretted that neither then nor since has he come 
across Mr. Alcock's ' Botanical Names for English Readers ' : had 
he done so, he would have found the work he has here undertaken 
ah'eady accomplished, and that in a more satisfactory manner.
He, however, includes the names of varieties, which Mr. Alcock 
omits : biit the mode of treatment is very unsatisfactory.
To be 
told that Bachii is "named after a M.
Bach" and Bellardi " named 
in honour of a Mr. Bellard " reminds one of the man who, being 
asked what was an archdeacon, replied "one who performs archi- 
diaconal functions." To render the book of interest, some informa- 
tion — such as dates of birth and death, and some reference to 
published works, if any — should have been given ; and this might 
have been done, in the case of dates at least, without adding to the 
bulk of the book.
On the same page with the examples cited we 
find " Baltici.
Named after the Baltic, on the shores of which 
this plant is abundant: Bsamvia Baltici'" ; but the name is baltica, 
not Baltici.
But Mr. Fitzgerald takes more daring flights than this.
To be 
told that sirviina is "from Latin scru, I scatter, probably because 
the plants so named are widely scattered," is calculated to surprise

the reader; but it is quite as likely as that SanioUis was " named 
after the Isle of Samos, where the plant was first discovered, by 
Valerand, in the sixteenth century." Of dizoides our author tells 
us that " aides in all words = hke ; resembling aiz."{\) 
We can say nothing in commendation of this little book, save 
that the author's motive in writing it seems to have been an 
excellent one.
But he has not succeeded in carrying it out.
The Report of the Stonyhurst College Observatory for 1884 
contains a list of the dates of the flowering of plants during 
the year .
Mr. H.
C. Hart has pubhshed in the ' Transactions of the Royal 
Irish Academy' a "Report on the Botany of Sinai and South 
Palestine" — the result of his expedition with Prof.
Hull in 1883.
The descriptive account of the journey is written in that pleasant 
readable style with which readers of this Journal are familar in 
Mr. Hart's contributions to our pages, and is followed by a 
systematic list of the plants coUected, about seventy of which are 
new to Palestine, while three — (Tulkun petrcB, Boucerosia Adronis, 
and Daphne linearifolia — are here described and figured for the 
first time.
Mr. Hart also sends us his ' Report on the Flora of South- 
west Donegal' (Proc.
Royal Irish Acad., 2nd Ser., vol.
iv.), which 
may be regarded as supplementary to his paper in this Journal 
for 1882.
A PAMPHLET by M.
a. Albert, entitled ' Botanique du Var : plantes 
nouvelles ou rares' (Draquignan, Latil) contains descriptions of two 
new species, Capsella hyhrida and Bunium collinam {" B.

crtsi«M»./H L., pro parte"); there are also five named forms under 
Capsella Bursa-pastoris.
The last part (vol.
iv., pt.
3) of the ' Proceedings of the British 
Naturalists' Society' contains the eighth instalment of Mr. Oedric 
Bucknall's "Fungi of the British District," with three coloured 
plates ; a paper on Apospory in Ferns, by Mr. G.
T. Druery ; and 
an instalment {TrUliacem to NaiadacecB) of the ' Flora of the Bristol 
Coalfields.' 
We are glad to announce the issue of a new part — the ninth — 
of Dr. Braithwaite's ' British Moss-Flora.' It contains the 
conclusion of Tortnla, the description of Pleurochaate, and the 
greater part of Mollla.
Twenty -three species are figured on four 
plates, in the usual style of excellence which has marked this work 
from its commencement.
Mr. Thomas Kirk sends us a reprint of some papers published 
in the ' Transactions of the New Zealand Institute,' " On the 
Flowering Plants and Ferns of Stewart Island" [Dracophyllnm

sorry to see that Mr. Kirk encourages by example the ugly and un- 
authorised spelling which substitutes a small initial for the capital 
in commemorative names.
We are glad to learn that the valuable information contained 
in the ' Herefordshire Pomona ' with reference to the cider and 
perry industry of Hereford, Worcester, Gloucester, Devon, and 
Somerset will be issued in a form easily accessible to those who 
cannot afford the larger work.
It will embrace a history of the 
orchards and their management, a description of the best varieties 
of fruits, the chemical analysis of their various juices, and an 
account of the manufacture of cider and perry.
Woodcut sections 
of the best varieties of fruit will be given.
The price to subscribers 
will be 5s.

Dr. Wittrock has issued a first fasciculus, containing twelve 
numbers, of ' Erythrfeie exsiccatae,' the specimens in which are of 
great beauty and interest.
They are : E.
pulchella Sm. and typica; 
eight forms of " E.
vulgaris (Kafn.) Wittr." (which we usually call 
E. littoralis Fr., and which is recognised by Dr. Wittrock as the 
plant of the ' Noviti^e ' ed.
i. and of most Swedish authors ; 
E. glomerata Wittr., a new species much resembling E.
capitata, 
but placed in a different section ; E.
Centaunum L, a.
typica and 
E. capitata «.
typica.
This last, from Oeland, seems to us to 
correspond very closely with Mr. Townsend's var.
sphasrocephala, 
but Dr. Wittrock (who has compared his specimens with the 
original ones of E.
capitata in the Berlin Museum) says that the 
latter " differt floribus paullo minoribus, laciniis corollae paullulo 
magis ovalibus obtusisque, sepalis paullo brevioribus." Notes are 
attached to each specimen, and in the Botaniska Notiser for 1884, 
pp.
110 — 118, other remarks upon them by Dr. Wittrock will be 
found.

BOTANICAL NEWS.
The Scottish Eights of Way Society of Edinburgh lias recently 
sent an active deputation to traverse some of the mountain-paths 
in the centre of the Highlands, and particularly to erect guide- 
posts.
This expedition has dealt with the Braemar district, and 
made an excellent beginning.
Botanists who have been excluded 
from Glen Doll, Clova, will be glad to hear that a guide-post has 
been erected at its foot, indicating through it a "Public path to 
Braemar." Another notice-board erected previously by Mr. Mac- 
pherson, the proprietor, stands beside it with the inscription, 
" Private entrance to Glen Doll." Experience has proved, since 
this step was taken by the Eights of Way Society, that visitors on 
being challenged have only to assert their determination to proceed 
to gain access to this beautiful and botanically interesting spot.
Admirable as the action of the Society is in recovering for the 
public so many ancient paths, yet it will be matter for regret, 
especially to naturalists, if this much should satisfy the public 
demand for "access to mountains." Game-keepers will still confine 
travellers to certain tracks, and thus exclude the naturalist from 
his most interesting hunting-grounds.
While the gratitude of 
botanists is due to the Society for such benefits, there should be no 
relaxing of efibrts in favour of Mr. Bryce's "Access to Mountains 
Bill," which is intended to provide wider access everywhere.
The portrait of Mr. Bentham — a copy of that in the rooms of 
the Linnean Society — for which subscriptions were invited some 
time since in these pages, has been placed in the Kew Herbarium.
OBITUARY.
Me. Joseph Sidebotham, J.P., F.L.S., &c., of Erlesdene, Bowdon, 
Cheshire, was perhaps — at all events latterly — better known as an 
entomologist than a botanist, his collections of British Lepidoptera 
and Coleoptera ranking among the finest in this country ; but most 
of his attention in his earlier years was bestowed upon the study of 
Botany.
In his native place, Apethorne, near Hyde (he was born 
in 1824), he devoted much time to the exploration of the Tame 
Valley, adding no less than twenty-five species to those previously 
rendered.
A life-long friend of Mr. L.
H. Grindon, the latter 
dedicated to him his ' Manchester Flora,' published in 1859, " in 
admiration of his talents as a successful student of Nature in all its 
branches, and of Botany in particular." For many years he was a 
820 OBITUABY.
frequent contributor to the ' Pliytologist.' Nor did he alone turn 
his attention to Phanerogamia — Cryptogams merited a full share of 
his research, and he particularly studied the Musci, Fresh-water 
Algae, and Diatomacese.
Eespectiug the Musci, as he informed the 
writer of this notice, he was unable to procure a copy of Wilson's 
'Bryologia Britannica' at the time of its first publication, and so, 
borrowing the book fi-om a friend, he most diligently and faithfully 
copied the whole of the plates, including the magnificent drawings — 
a work involving infinite trouble and patience.
He was for many 
years a partner in the well-known calico-printing firm called " The 
Strines Printing Company," retiring only in 1876, upon becoming 
possessed of large properties in the neighbourhood of Hyde and 
elsewhere, which came to him upon the death of a relative.
When 
at Strines he was always endeavouring to interest his work-people 
in Natural Science, and gave up much time to them, especially in 
contributing articles of interest to the ' Strines Journal,' a MS.
record of the Botany and Natural History of the locality.
Mr.
Sidebotham was for thirty-three years a member of the Manchester 
Literary and Philosophical Society, and was particularly active in 
the management of its Microscopical and Natural History Section, 
for several years acting as Secretary, and serving on the Council.
He was also one of the founders of the Manchester Photographic 
Society, aud, in company with Mr. Grindon, of the Manchester Field 
Naturalists' Society.
A most intimate friend of James Nasmyth, 
the inventor and astronomer, it was to him that the first discovery 
by Nasmyth of the "willow leaves" structure of the sun's photo- 
sphere was addressed.
Indeed, Mr. Sidebotham was himself no 
mean astronomer, and had erected a small observatory in his 
grounds, in which was placed a remarkably fine telescope.
A man 
of more varied accomplishments it would be almost impossible to 
find.
A great lover of church music, he was a splendid performer 
on the organ, and had built a large one in his house at Bowdon.
Erlesdene was in fact a perfect treasure-house, stored with beautiful 
and rare objects of Nature and Art, all witnessing to the innate 
force and culture of the man, by their arrangement or by their 
selection.
Those whom he numbered among his intimate frieuds, 
and they were many, unanimously testify to his kind, unselfish, and 
simple child-like nature — never so happy as when doing good aud 
benefiting others.
Three years ago he built, at a large expense, 
and endowed the beautiful church of St. Anne, Haughton, near 
Denton, but just before the consecration he had the great misfortune 
to lose his wife.
He never seemed quite the same man afterwards; 
his health, which had not for some time been strong, necessitating 
wintering abroad for two or three years, gradually declined still 
more, and though his friends hoped he was gradually mending in 
the spring of this year, he passed away on Saturday, May 30th, in 
the sixty-second year of his age, widely and deeply regretted.

Mr. Henry tells 
me that he cannot doubt that tea is really wild here, as it occurs 
here and there in the thick jungle, associated with other plants.
Tea is not cultivated at all by the Lai tribes, nor do they use it as 
a beverage ; but they pluck and dry the leaves of the wild plant, 
and supply the Chinese settlements with a small quantity of what 
is called " Lai tea."

No species of this interesting genus, respecting the affinities of 
which there is some divergence of opinion amongst botanists 
(Cfr. P>aillon in ' Adansonia ' xi.

The Hai-nan plant differs from all the species of our

with C.
sumatrana Miq. It is not unlike the Amazonian C capituli- 
fera Spruce, except in the texture and vestiture of the leaves.

('Krit.

distinct.
J, LeschenauJtii is a perennial, belonging to the division

This shows such an evident approach to 
A. heterocarpum Walk by the greater pellucidness of the leaflets, 
their narrow more acuminate shape, and the tendency of the sori

prove to be an extreme form of this widely diffused species.

One advantage of the publication of local floras, like Mr. J.

Baker's recent ' Flora of the English Lake-district,' is that it stirs 
up both residents and visitors to record deficiencies or additions.
To the very great accuracy and value of Mr. Baker's Flora I can 
bear practical testimony.
A very few notes made during a six 
weeks' stay between Ambleside and Langdale may be worth

The following contribution to the hepaticology of Gloucester- 
shire is the result of personal observation at intervals during five 
years.
It cannot therefore pretend to be complete, but, so far as 
it goes, will serve to show that this county, which has a deserved 
reputation for a rich and interesting phanerogamic flora, may also 
be considered fairly productive in this particular department of

BOTANICAL NOTES OF A TOUE IN CAITHNESS AND 
SUTHERLAND, JULY, 1885.
By the Eev. H.
E. Fox, M.A., and Frederick J.
Hanbury, F.L.S.
To the ordinary tourist Caithness does not present a promising 
field for floral search.
The long stretch of wet moorland through 
which the railway passes is only succeeded hy the fringe of coast- 
cultivation, even less picturesque than the other, and both without 
a tree or hedgerow to break the monotony of flatness.
The flag- 
stones which mark the divisions of the fields in severely regular 
lines are not suggestive of much but agricultural economy.
The 
elevation of the greater part is slight, and the sluggish streams 
which drain the peat-bogs of the central area are quite unlike the 
brawling burns which the traveller crosses on his northward journey.
The district, however, is not without its botanical riches.
The county of Dick could not fail of interest to fellow lovers of 
Nature.
An evening stroll along the banks of the Thurso River 
did not yield us the Hierochlue, which grows almost opposite the 
spot where the Caithness naturalist lies buried.
The plant is at all 
times difficult to be found, and has probably suffered at the hands 
of collectors ; its season, too, was long past ; a single head, how- 
ever, was gathered about three weeks before our arrival by Mr. A.
H. 
Bremner, of Thurso, which he kindly gave us.
Juncus balticiis, Carex 
aquatilis var.
Watsimi and C.
ampuUacea were abundant along the 
margin of the stream.
Vicia si/lvatica was growing on the grassy 
banks opposite the cemetery, the only locality in which we noticed 
it in either county.
Trull ius europmis, which is fi-equent everywhere 
in the two counties, adorned the meadow herbage.
Viola tricolor 
and Anchxisa arrensis were the characteristic weeds of the cultivated 
soil, with SiJenjida arrensis and LamiiDii amplexicanle.
L. purpureum 
and L.
interinediuni were also common ; but L.
album was not seen, 
and is said not to grow in the county.
Cariim.
Car id occurred as a 
casual by the road-side near Thurso, but was abundant, and had all 
the appearance of being native further west, on sand-hills at the 
mouth of Strathalladale.
The sand-hills of Murkle Bay produced 
Cakile maritima, Cerastium tetrayidruin, Elijmus arenaritcs, flowering 
abundantly, and other common maritime plants ; and where the 
ground was wet, Pamassia palustris, Primula veris, Pinyuicula 
vuli/aris, and Orchis latifolia grew almost down to the sea ; the latter 
was especially fine and abundant, and with its deep crimson flowers 
was one of the most conspicuous plants of the neighbourhood in 
almost every field and ditch.
SciUa verna is common on all the 
grassy headlands.
Taking the train to Bilbster, we crossed a short piece of wet 
moorland which surrounds the shallow and boggy Loch Winless.
Aira pracox and A.
cari/oiiJn/llca abound on all the drier spots, as 
leverywhere on the peat-soil through the two counties.
Hippuris 
vidf/aris, Comarum palustre, Veronica scntellata, Catabrusa aquatica, 
and Chara fragilis were noted in ditches at the head of the lake.
In the lake itself the most interesting plant was Xuphar piimila, 
not easy of access on account of the treacherous but Lorn of thick

mud, above which it floats.
Equiseluni limosum was abundant, and 
on a sandy promontory we found Leontodon pratensis.
In the 
stream flowing out of the lake Potamofietmifiliformts, Mi/no}ihylliim 
(tlternijionun.
(very common also elsewhere), and Heloscunliuni inmi- 
datum occurred.
Crossing a slight rise by the main road, we struck the Wick 
River at the point where it is crossed by the railway.
Three 
hundred yards below this we found Curex salina /3.
kuttef/utensis, 
which was discovered for the first time last year by Mr. J.
Grant ; 
it was growing in abundance, together with Carex Watsoni, and 
continued on both banks of the river to within a mile and a half of 
the town.
Mini ul its luteus, thoroughly established in marshy places 
by the river-side, was flowering in beautiful contrast with Mi/osotis 
strUjulosa Reich.
We were unsuccessful in our search for Ajiuja 
jiyramidaUs, which is recorded from the banks of this river ; but it 
was late in the season for this, and the herbage was very high.
We 
gathered Fi;rola media among the heather about a mile and a half 
above the town.
Bhjsmus rufus and Scirpus unvilurnis, with other 
salt-marsh plants, grew lower down among stones at the edge of 
the river.
At Wick we were fortunate in making the acquaintance 
of Mr. J.
Grant, and enjoying the hospitality of his family.
This 
intelligent young botanist has already been successful in adding 
two plants to the British Flora from his own county, which have 
escaped previous observers.
The road westward from Thurso passes over the low watershed 
between the river of that name and the Forss.
Besides Primula 
scotica, a very pale and dwarf form of Anthyllis Vulneraria, and 
Carex dioica (which latter is common everywhere in marshy places 
through the two counties), nothing of special interest was noted 
till the sea was again struck at the mouth of the Forss River.
Lujusticum scuticum and Populus tremula were here growing on the 
low rocky clifl's near the shore.
The common Primrose was still 
flowering (July 7th) on grassy banks and along the headlands; its 
exquisite northern congener, P.
scotica, again occurred in profusion, 
together with a very dwarf and richly-coloured form of Kuphrasia 
officinalis, with capsules much longer than the calyx, apparently 
the form called E.
maritiina in Hooker's ' Student's Flora,' hitherto 
recorded only from Shetland.
Silene maritima, Plantago Coronopus, 
and P.
vKtritiiiia presented a curious appearance, on account of their 
stunted growth and abnormally-thickened leaves.
At Downreay, about two miles west of the Forss, we met with 
Oxytropis Uralensis for the first time ; it recurs in more or less 
abundance along the coast at various places, but we did not notice 
it further west than the mouth of the Borgie.
Mertensia maritiina was gathered in a sandy bay about two miles 
east of Reay.
The sand-hills of this place are full of interest.
The 
burn which flows past the little inn to the sea is choked with 
masses of a cultivated form of Miinulus, which was swept out of a 
neighbouring garden some years ago by a winter flood, and has 
now thoroughly established itself for more than half a mile along 
the stream.
Myosotis striyidosa was here again in great beauty.

and in damp sandy places near the sea Carex incnrva in some 
plenty ; this is a fairly common sedge on the maritime sands of 
Sutherlandshire, and, amongst other places, was growing in fine 
form at Farr Bay and the shores of the Naver.
On tlie Keay links 
a very large and distinct variety of VUiplirasui njfinnalis * was noticed, 
as well as the following: — Thalictrum minus var.
mdritiinnm, Spinm 
Uimarid, Lujusticnni scotieiim, and Hahenaria viridis, which were all 
growing in the loose sand and struggling with the universal 
Psamma arenaria ; and by the rocky margins of a burn to the E .
of the 
Links a Hieracium which does not appear to agree with any known 
British species, and about which we hope to write at a future date.
Melvich, at the moutli of iStrathalladale, is worth a visit on 
many accounts.
Besides fair loch-fishing in the neighbourhood, 
some of the finest coast-scenery in E.
Sutherland is close to the 
village.
There is also a comfortable inn, which has not yet been 
turned into a tourist-haunted hotel.
Oxijtwpis Uralensis grows in 
great luxuriance in several places along the cliffs.
Sedimi lihodiola 
descends to the sea-level.
On the moors westward iiaheiiaria aJhlda 
is not inh-equent.
A little before the main road reaches the Naver it crosses the 
opening of Farr Bay, where Botnjchimn Lunana was growing, 
curiously associated with Triticuiii jimceum, Centaurea Scahiosa, and 
Oxytropis in dry sand.
On broken ground below the cliffs, which 
rise above the road half a mile east of the Bettyhill Inn, the 
vegetation was more rich and varied.
A tangled undergrowth of 
blackthorn, hazel, and rowan concealed luxuriant oak and beech 
ferns.
The yellow heads of TruUius and Uier<iciiuii'''- dotted the 
darker background, and sea-green clumps of Eock rose clung to 
the grey crags.
Arena /nibescens was also observed.
An equally 
interesting but quite different piece of ground on the other side of 
and below the inn, along the river-bank, will repay search.
The 
soil is sandy, but saturated With moisture, and bears a rich herbage, 
amongst which !Saxifra(/a aizoides, Listera ovata, Gyvmadenla conujisea, 
and Carex capillans were the most noteworthy, Carex extensit var.
minor, Bhjsmiis nifus, a curious and very slender form of Jmicus 
Gerardi, and Scirpus paucijiurus grew at the margin of the river, 
bushy shrubs of Rosa spinosmUiia and Pupulus tremula higher up, 
and on all the drier banks a luxuriant growth of Oxijtropia.
The sandy fiats on the west shore of the Naver yielded abun- 
dance of Carex incur ca, and several jjatches of Juucus halticus.
At 
the base of the low hills which come down to the shore Bryas octo- 
petala, of a peculiarly stout and vigorous growth, was holding its 
own, even on the wind-driven sands.
A few feet higher up on the 
rocks were Arabis hirsuta, Saxifraya oppositifolia, Taraxacum pahistre, 
Hieracium viurorum, Asplenium Trichovianes, and Cystopteris frayilis.
Carex capillaris was again abundant, and Primula scutica in a wet 
hollow among the hills.
On the boggy slopes leading down to the 
B(u-gie Pinyuicula lusitanica, which occurs plentifully everywhere 
westward, was noted for the first time, with its usual companions, 
* We hope to supplement this short paper by a few critical notes ou the 
forms of Hieracia, Euphrasia, and Carex vtilyaris found on this northern coast, 
but must defer this for the present.

anr/lica.
The drier ground was covered 
with juniper and ArcUMaphijloH Uva-ursi, amongst which appeared a 
few phints of Draba incana and the last of (Xei/tropis.
Small marshy 
lochs on the moorland beyond the river produced a dwarf form of 
NymphcRd alba, Lobelia Dortmanna, and Carex (impullacea.
Potaimxjeton 
lieterophyllus and NiteJla optica were gathered in a little loch by the 
road-side, and Pijrola minor in woods near Tongue House.
The weather prevented much botanising on the Kyle of Tongue 
or Loch Erribol.
The ground between the two is a low dreary 
moorland, and only interesting for fine views of Ben Hope and the 
neighbouring mountains.
Leaving Erribol, we again met with Dryas and Draba near the 
Smoo Cave.
At the same place ValerianeUa olitoria, abundant 
forms of Hicraciuiii (anylicuin/), Scolopendriuin vuhjare, and Cystopteris 
frayilis were conspicuous, marking the presence of the limestone, 
which gives so striking a character to the flora of Durness.
On 
hillocks by the road-side west of the Durness Inn ThaUctrum 
alpinum, Draba incana, Dryas octopetala, Rubus saxatil/is, Hieracium 
Cixsium., and Fpipactis ovalis Bab. formed an interesting group 
of plants, together with Antennaria dioica and Botrychium Lu- 
naria, which are both common throughout the whole of West 
Siitherlandshire.
In a dried-up loch at the back of the Free 
Church Juncus balticus with two or three forms of Carex vuhjaris 
occurred, aud in the stream flowing out of its northern end 
Potamoyeton filifonnis in fine fruit.
The sand-hills leading to Far-out Head are full of ThaUctrum 
minus var.
maritimnm and Viola Curtisii.
Several patches of 
Primula scotica lay in the damper hollows, and Scilla verna almost 
formed the herbage on the dry headlands.
Sedum Rhodiola, Silene 
maritima, and Armeria maritima grew in every chink of the rooks, 
Avena pubescens on the grass-lands.
In a wet meadow about three- 
quarters of a mile north of the inn we found, besides Menyanthes 
tri/oliata and other marsh-loving plants, Carex dioica, C.
teretimcula, 
and C.
limosa.
A low range of hills bounds the limestone area on 
the east ; on the most northern and lowest of these, Benin 
Ceannabeinne, Saussurea alpina was growing at an elevation of 
scarcely 300 ft.
Arctostaphylos alpina and Juniperus nana covered 
the summit, a few stunted plants of Listera cordata amongst them.
In a marshy pool where the road crosses the Alt Smoo we gathered 
Carex /iliformis, with C.
ampnUacea and Lobelia Dortmanna .
Time prevented our reaching Cape Wrath, and our next halting 
place was the tidy little village of Scourie, with its comfortable inn.
Handa Island, which is distant about half an hour's sail, is well 
worth a visit, but chiefly for its magnificent clifl's and the extra- 
ordinary number and variety of the sea-birds which frequent them.
We were not successful in finding any plants of much interest on 
the island itself ; but in the neighbourhood of Scourie we gathered 
Sayina saxatilis, Sedum anylicum on rocks above the village, Lobelia 
Dortmanna, NympJuca alba, Scirp}(s fiuitans, and Malaxis paludosa 
in a small loch south of the village (marked on the Ordnance Map 
Leathan nan Cruicheanj, and on boggy ground at its head.

BOTANICAL NOTES OF A TOUR IN CAITHNESS AND SUTHERLAND.

the road to Badcall, about half-way between it and Scouric, is Locban 
Dubh, in which Potanioi/eton nit ens was growing; and a low hundred 
yards further a piece of marshy ground, in whicli Carer, liinosa and 
Vtricularia interi)icdia were abundant, tiie latter without a trace of 
flower.
On rocks south-west of Scourie Asplenluiii iinirinum wag 
growing scantily, Litiusticuin scotictim and Sediwi Hhoiliuhi plentifully, 
and on crags at Badcall was Hieracium pallidum.
The long drive to Lairg yielded nothing of special interest.
Birch-trees clothe the lower parts of the hills.
Populns Ireinnla and 
Horn spinosissima cling to the rocks.
A few hollies and an occasional 
stunted oak give variety to the higher foliage.
To those who could give longer time than our hurried tour 
allowed us, and could include some of the higher mountains, as 
Morven, Ben Hope, Foiniven, and Ben Arkle in their search, the 
two counties would doubtless yield many other plants of interest ; 
but our notes are enough to show that there are few districts in 
Great Britain where a walk of ten days would bring within reach 
of the botanist so rich and varied a flora.

MIDDLESEX PLANTS.
By John Benbow.
The following plants, apparently not frequent in Middlesex, 
were gathered in the early summer of this year : — 
Ranunculus parvijiorus.
Uxbridge and Uxbridge Moor.
Moenchia erecta.
Uxbridge Common.
TriyoncUa ornithopodioides.
Abundant on waste land west of 
Hounsiow, near the bridge on the Staines road, with Moenchia erecta 
and Myosotis collina.
MIDDLESEX PLANTS.

ValeriancUa auricula.
Between Eastcote and Northwoocl (new

Crcpis taraxacifolia.
Thames side near Hampton Court (new

— C.
biennis.
In great iDrofusion in a meadow by Wood 
Hall, near Pinner ; and again abimdaut in meadows about Hare- 
field.
Beyond doubt therefore a well-established species in Middle- 
sex.
Specimens are also occasionally met with about Iver Heath, 
in Bucks, a mile or two from Uxbridge.
Orchis pijramidalis.
Several plants near Harefield ; and sparingly 
on the downs near Springwell.

of Harefield.— 0.

Opkrys apifera.
Frequent on hilly pastures about Harefield and 
Springwell.
Hahenaria chJorantha.
Several plants near Harefield.
It is a 
curious fact that none of the Orchids reported by Blackstone 
and Collinson to be abundant in the old chalk-pits at Harefield, 
about the middle of the last century, have ever been found there 
since.
It is noticeable also that they were all stated to be collected 
in this one spot only, and nowhere else in the neighbourhood.
A 
cursory search of a few hours, however (assisted by my son and 
nephew), was sufiicient to prove that they are not all of them 
extinct, as hitherto supposed, and that they are to be found, more- 
over, in stations beyond the area of the old chalk-pits.
It is 
possible that others may hereafter be added to the list ; for a much 
closer survey of the district is yet required to exhaust the chances 
of further discovery.
Luzula Forsteri.
Pinner Wood (confirming Mr. Hind's record).
Eriophorum poh/stachion.
Moors below Springwell Lock.
Carex paradoxa.
Extremely abundant on the moors below 
Springwell Lock ; in meadows between Denham Lock and Hare- 
field Moor ; and not infrequent by the side of ditches and canals 
from Denham Lock to the boundary.
It grows also in the con- 
tiguous meadows of Herts.
I at first concluded that this was a 
new record for Middlesex, but have since discovered that Mr.
Warren gathered a specimen by the " canal near West Drayton," 
which he queried C.
paradoxa /, and which it undoubtedly is.
A 
straggler had therefore found its way some five or six miles lower 
down the valley.
Arena pubescens.
Very abundant in all the meadows round 
Harefield, Springwell, and Drayton Ford.
It is strange that both 
this and the preceding, two of the commonest plants in our district, 
should for so many years have escaped detection.
Up to the date 
of publication of Trimen and Dyer's ' Flora of Middlesex ' there 
had been no record of A.
irubescens (save as a casual in 1688).
Dr.
Trimen collected a specimen in 1871 from " Hillingdon Place, near 
Uxbridge," but this could only have been a straggler from the 
chalk ; for, although living on the spot myself, I have never noticed 
it there, nor, indeed, anywhere nearer than the Harefield district, 
where it abounds.
I gathered several plants of this species and 
Bromus erectus in the spring on the tow-path near Hampton Court ;

but similarly they must have been merely waifs from some of the 
upper reaches of the Thames.
Kouleria cristata.
Uxbridge Common.
And since the above : —

On rough gravelly banks of the railway 
between Uxbridge and West Drayton.

It will thus be seen that Orchis pyra7Hidalis, O.

naria chlorantha, and Avena pubescens are happily not yet lost to the 
county flora.

348 ENUMERATIO SPECIERUM VARIETATUMQUE GENERIS DIANTHUS.
DeCandolle genus Dianthus in cluas partes sectionesve dividit, 
quibns nomina Armeriastrum et ('ari/upJii/lliini imposuit.
Sectio 
prior species floribus capitatis v.
corymbosis, altera species floribus 
paniculatis v.
solitariis prfeditas continet.
Ad Armeriastrum 
DeCandolle Diantlium etiam proliferum speciesque affines retulit, 
quas postea Kuntli a genere separavit atque in genus proprium, 
Kolilrausckia dictum, conjunxit.
Qufe separatio non approbanda 
est, quod forma et structura capsulne seminumque, imo habitus 
illarum specierum cum Diantliis genuiuis omnino seminumque 
congruunt.
Nihilominus D.
prolifer speciesque consanguinese ad 
sectionem Armeriastrum referri non possunt, propterea quod in iis 
structura calycis, squamarum calycinarum, et petalorum a struc- 
tura, quam liaec organa in Armeriastris genuinis possident, magno- 
pere differt.
Quam obrem sectionem propriam constituant necesse 
est.
Genus etiam Tunica a Scopoli creatum, quod D.
saxifragum 
speciesque ei affines, continet cum genere Kohlrauschia conjunctum 
est, quod nominatum Pseudodianthus formare, genere seniore con- 
tinente, Dianthus (v.
Eudianthus), priores sectiones Armeriastrum 
et Caryophyllum.
Utrumque genus sic dictum dua in subgenera 
dividendum est, et quidem Pseudodianthus in subgenera Tunica et 
Kohlrauschia; Eudianthus in seotioues Anneriastnomet CarijoyhijUum.
Sunt quidem species inter Armeriastrum (v.
quo nunc nomen sub- 
genericum Carthusianastrum imposui) et Caryophyllum (nunc sub- 
genus Canjojjhi/llastrum) — v.
c. D, toletanus, graniticus, et Seguieri, 
sed pleraeque utriusque sectionis species typum sectioni peculiarem 
possident, quam ob causam sectiones illffi conservandae sunt.
Sub- 
sectiones format£e ob marginem petalorum limbi house sint, sub- 
sectiones formats autem prasterea ob squamarum calycinarum 
(bractearum) configurationem pariter naturales videntur.
Haec 
distinctio in forma squamarum calycinarum, subsectionibus Macro- 
lepides et Microlepides nomina imponunt.
In Diantliis latisquamis 
latitude squamarum longitudinem fere fequat, in angustisquamis 
longitude latitudinem multo superat.
Species latisquamaB v.
Macrolepides squamas breves obtusas v.
ex apice obtuso breve aut 
in mucronulum possident ; species angustisquamae v.
Microlepides 
autem squamis longis acutis v.
acuminatis v, plus minus sensim in 
mucronem aut aristam productis prasditse esse solent, Dianthi 
latisquami petala Integra v.
dentata, rarius fimbriata, angusti- 
squami petala dentata aut fimbriata, raro Integra possident.
Etiam 
verum est observatione, quidem attamen concedendum est, petala 
integra et fimbriata, item petala dentata et fimbriata in una eadem- 
que specie non occurrere.
Quibus principiis, ergo, cum aliis, qualis 
dispositione appositioueque intioroscentite, classificatio naturalis 
exsequatur.
Nouiiua trium subgenerum tribus speciebus typicis fundantur, 
videlicet : — 
Carthusianastrum, Caryophyllastrum, et Proliferastrum (=Kohl- 
rauscbia).
Species omnes in herbariis in Museo Historias Natu-

SHOET NOTES.
Epilobium Lamyi F.
Scbultz in Worcestershire.
— I gathered 
specimens of this ])lant from an arable field near Malvern a few 
weeks ago.
It was growing in great abundance, but, owing to most 
of the plants having their lower leaves much withered, it was im- 
possible to procure good examples.
Mr. Eidley, who has seen some 
of the specimens, suggests, with great probability, that when it is 
better known it will prove to be much more common than is usually 
supposed.
It may easily, before the development of the rosettes, 
be passed over for nhscuruw, and later, when the leaves of the stem 
become withered and the rosettes apparent, for teiragonum.
It is, 
however, a smaller plant than either.
Possibly, if herbarium 
specimens labelled '' obscurum," yet wanting the long styles, were 
examined, some might prove to be this species.
— E.
F. Towndrow.
Astragalus alpinus in Forfarshire (p.
310).
— With reference 
to Mr. Brebuer's remark on the Glen Dole station, I may say I 
have specimens gathered by Dr. Greville in 1837, and others 
gathered by the late Mr. Sadler in 1872 " on Craig Maid, Glen 
Dole." — Arthur Bennett.

each.
These last two parts of ' English Botany' contain the account 
of the Churacete.
Dr. Boswell, owing to ill-health, was unfortu- 
350 NOTICES OF BOOKS.
nately unable to add the fiuisliing touches to the description of 
this order, and Mr. N.
E. Brown, of Kew, has been entrusted 
by the pubhshers with seeing it through the press.
The species are described under the two genera Chara and 
Nitella, Tobjpella and LycJmothammis being treated as sections.
Dr. Boswell has taken the "himping'' view of these plants, 
describing nineteen species and reducing to the rank of varieties 
several which are usually regarded as species, such as Xitella 
capitata, Tolijpdla prolijera, and ('hura puli/acaiitlia.
The de- 
scriptions are drawn up in Dr. Boswell's usual careful manner, 
and it is much to be regretted that the completion of the work has 
necessarily fallen into other hands.
A number of additions have 
been made by Mr. N.
E. Brown, many of which are unnecessary 
or erroneous ; indeed, most of the sentences of any length included 
in square brackets contain one or more blunders.
This might 
have been excused in one having no previous knowledge of the 
gi'oup had it not been for the dogmatic and authoritative tone 
adopted.
The off-hand manner in which the conclusions of the 
greatest authority on the order, the late Alex.
Braun, are dismissed 
would certainly be amusing, as showing what intense egotism can 
produce, were it not for the discredit thereby brought upon British 
Botany ; for instance, under ^Y.
nidijica Mr. Brown did not happen 
to see the difference between plants which Braun had dis- 
tmguished, so he had no doubt Braun was wrong, and wrote, 
•' The nucules examined by Braun must have been quite immature 
ones." As if Prof.
Braun did not know unripe nucules when he 
saw them !
The trustworthiness of Mr. Brown's work may be gathered 
from the remarks under C.fragifera, p.
217, where, after referring, 
m a footnote, to our notice of a monoecious state, and saying that 
he had not seen a specimen, he unhesitatingly states of the globules, 
" Barely on the same plant, and placed immediately beneath the 
nucule." Now, as he professes to rely on our statement as to the 
existence of a monoecious state, his description of the position of 
the globules (Avhich happens to be quite erroneous as regards our 
specimen) must be purely conjectural.
Again, under .Y.
(jlomerata 
var.
Smithii, he writes : — " I have very carefully examined Mr.
Borrer's Lancing specimen, and only find globules upon it, not a 
trace of a nucule : this is therefore, I have no doubt, another case 
of a polygamous species, as in that of N.
Jlexilis." Now, any one 
in the habit of examining CJiaraceie should have had no difficulty 
in finding young nucules on that specimen.
We first have an in- 
excusable blunder, and then one of those generalisations which 
seem to come so naturally to the careless observer.
We will cite 
but one more passage, p.
216: — " C.
cunnivens appears to be but a 
sexual state of C.Jhtgilis, as strictly it only difi'ers from that plant 
in sex." Comment on this would be superiluous.

NOTES ON SOME PLANTS FEOM NOKFOLK ISLAND.
By Baron Von Mueller, K.C.M.G., M.D., Ph.D., F.R.S.
Last year, when offering to this Journal the description of 
Asplenium Rohinsonii, (pp.
289-290), I had occasion to refer 
also to Pterocarpus australis from the same locality as likely 
belonging to Wistaria or Millettia, which two genera might well be 
combined.
This supposition has proved to be correct, because Mr.
Isaac Eobinson has succeeded after much search to find of the 
large climber, assigned by Endlicher to Pterocarpus, at last a single 
fruit, which is completely in accord with Millettia, as will be seen 
from the following notes : — 
Pod (the only one seen) ellipsoid, turgid, ending gradually into 
an almost subulate apex, tapering also at the base, tardily and 
imperfectly dehiscent, glabrescent and brownish outside, including 
the apex, 8|- in.
long, nearly l^- in.
broad ; valves hard, thick, 
almost lignescent ; cavity divided by cross-partitions between the 
seeds, invested by a whitish fibrous membrane.
Seeds only two 
ripened, measuring f-1 in., almost globular, but next to the septa 
more or less truncate, yellowish brown, smooth ; hilum much 
elongated, linear ; testa coriaceous, pallid inside ; embryo emitting 
a strong odour, when dry of horny hardness, whitish fresh, turning 
livid ; cotyledons nearly equal ; radicle about f in.
long, ellipsoid, 
placed obliquely, only a small portion emerging beyond the cotyle- 
dons.
Several ovules remain undeveloped, therefore the fruit may 
ripen sometimes more than two seeds.
Thus we have also now become aware that Millettia australis 
approaches closely M.
nm/asperuia : the leaflets are, however, almost 
blunt, and reticulated by more prominent veins ; the stalklets of 
the flowers are shorter, the bracts narrower, the calyx-lobes shorter 
and less pointed, the pod produced is into a longer apex, and not 
velvety outside.
It may, however, here be mentioned that the late 
M. de la Camera insisted on the occurrence of two kinds of Wistaria 
on the Eichmond Eiver, one with pods nearly glabrous outside, 
containing more numerous seeds of hardly half the size of those of 
the true M.
mei/asi>erma.
He found this Wistaria — which, in memory 
of his zealous collecting efforts in the primeval forests of East 
Australia, I wish to call as a species or variety Millettia or Wistaria 
Camerana — to climb up to a height of eighty feet or even more ; the 
flowering specimens from the Eichmond Eiver show also consider- 
able differences of the length of the calyx-lobes, which may indicate 
specific discrepancies.
While offering these remarks on a long-misunderstood plant of 
Norfolk Island, it may here not be out of place to note that the 
great fern investigator, Mr. J.
G. Baker, refers to Asplenium 
Robinsonii as the doubtful recorded variety of A.
squannilatum of 
Hooker's Spec.
Filicum, iii.
88, the origin of which had remained 
for very many years obscure ; this particular fern, now shown to be 
a native of Norfolk Island, is evidently not identical with Blume's 
Journal of Botany.

probably endemic to the far-isolated oceanic spot as a remnant of 
a bygone vegetation, where indeed it is now nearly extinct, as 
trading horticulturists have carried away three of the only five 
individual plants known from various spots of the island.
Mr.
Eobinson writes concerning this fern, that in habit it is not unlike 
A. Nidus, so that four fronds gathered from one plant could scarcely 
be missed, and that all fronds appeared fructified, yet it shows no 
inclination for natural dispersion ; specimens lately received exhibit 
the spikes semiterete and channelled, and the apex of the frond 
acute.
In Endlicher's list and Cunningham's addition of Norfolk 
Island plants is not contained Mclicytus ramijiorus, a plant all the 
more interesting from thence, as it seems nowhere represented by 
any congeneric form in the flora of Continental Australia.
As 
regards the Olea from Norfolk Island, it might be now incidentally 
remarked that it should be distinguished as Olea Endlicheri, inas- 
much as Vahl described in the Symbols, iii.

from New Zealand.

PBOTOPLASMIC CONTINUITY IN THE FUCACEM.
By Thomas Hick, B.A., B.Sc.
Part II.
The following notes and observations are a continuation of

a recent issue of this Journal.* They should, indeed, have formed 
part of that communication, but their publication was unavoidably 
postponed.

PKOTOPLASMIC CONTINUITY IN THE FUCACE^.
355 
HiMANTHALIA LOEEA Lyilgb.
The stalked, funnel-shaped thallus of this "weed," witli its 
coriaceous fruit-body divided dichotomously into thong-like branches, 
is a well-known inhabitant of British coasts.
In its mode of repro- 
duction and general structure it closely agrees with the Fucacece 
already dealt with, and with which systematists usually associate 
it.
The thallus is composed of Epidermal, Cortical and Central or 
Medullary tissues, though there is no sharp line of distinction 
between them.
Save in the presence of the conceptacles bearing 
antheridia or oogonia, the reproductive part, which constitutes by 
far the major portion of the thallus, has substantially the same 
structure as the sterile part.
The Epidermal tissue is composed of several layers of cells, 
often so connected with one another that the cells of each layer 
appear to arise by the dichotomous branching of those of the next 
inner layer.
The cells of the outermost layers have their longest 
diameter perpendicular to the surface of the thallus, and their 
narrow, oblong, or wedge-shaped protoplasts forcibly remind one of 
the columnar epithelium of animal mucous membranes.
The Cortical tissue is a thick parenchymatous mass, whose con- 
stituent elements vary in size and shape, and in the thickness of 
their walls.
Small where they abut on the epidermal tissue, they 
become longer and stretched in the longitudinal direction, towards 
the interior, and finally pass over somewhat abruptly into the fila- 
ments and fibres which constitute the central tissue.
The proto- 
plasts are irregular in shape, and send out radiating pseudopodia- 
like processes in various directions.
Transverse and longitudinal 
sections show that the cell-walls are more strongly thickened in 
the middle region of the cortex than in the inner and outer 
portions.
The Central tissue, like that of other Fucoids, is composed of 
cellular, filamentous structures, which originate, at least in part, as 
outgrowths from the cortical cells.
These are loosely interwoven 
longitudinally and transversely, though the great majority run in 
the former direction.
Two kinds may be distinguished, viz., fila- 
ments proper and fibres.
The former are stouter, have more homo- 
geneous walls, and more watery protoplasmic contents.
Their 
articulations are provided with a thick annular ingrowth, which 
surrounds the transverse partitions where such are present.
A 
constriction of the outer surface, at irregular intervals, is a common 
phenomenon in these filaments.
The fibre-like structures are 
finer, and have very dense protoplasmic contents, while their walls 
are longitudinally laminated.
At intervals, which are sometimes 
considerable, are placed transverse septa, which are extremely 
oblique, tbe fibres in this, as in other characters, resembhng the 
fibres described and figured in Ascophijlluja nudusum.* Both fila- 
ments and fibres branch more or less freely, but the former are not 
connected with each other by lateral diverticula, as are those of the 
plant named.

356 PROTOPLASMIC CONTINUITY IN THE FUCACE;E.
In examiiiiug these tissues for evidences of the continuity of 
the protoplasm, great difficulties have been met with, greater even 
than those encountered in the Fiici.
Hence the results, though 
conclusive as to the existence of continuity in the central and 
cortical tissues, are not quite demonstrative as to its permanence, 
nor as to its extension over the whole thallus.
The methods 
employed for preparing sections for examination were those already 
described in detail, swelling and clarifying reagents being absolutely 
indispensable.
In good sections prepared by these methods, stained, &c., the 
following details may be made out with tolerable ease : — 
1. The protoplasm of the filaments, fibres, and cortical cells is 
certainly interrupted, in many cases, at the transverse partitions, 
longitudinal contraction of the proloplasts having at least equalled 
that in other directions.
2. In other cases, however, there are indisputable phenomena 
of continuity conforming to at least two of the types met with in 
AscvpJiylhivi nodosum.
Thus in the filaments and fibres of the 
central tissue, as well as in the cortical cells, many instances are 
met with in which the continuity is brought about directly by a 
comparatively stout undivided cord of protoplasm.
Others are to 
be found, though scarcely more frequently, in which continuity is 
effected by means of a sieve plate, in which case the pores are 
either scattered over the whole plate or restricted to its margin.
There are also cases which give rise to the suspicion that continuity 
is sometimes maintained by a single, central, attenuated, thread of 
protoplasm, but a perfect demonstration of this can hardly be said 
to have been obtained.
With regard to the epidermal tissue, it must be admitted that 
decisive preparations either for or against continuity are still a 
desideratum.
The best sections hitherto obtained seem to point to 
previously existing connecting threads running from protoplast to 
protoplast, but in none of them have such threads been found intact.
It may be that the modes of treatment are too rough for such 
delicate structures as these, but in any case this point will require 
further investigation.
From what has been stated it will be obvious that in Hiiuanthalia 
lorea the arrangements for continuity are either not so universal or 
not so permanent as in the Fuci, or else they are more easily 
destroyed.
Taking all the circumstances of the case into careful 
consideration, and giving due weight to the appearances presented 
by the sections, even where the continuity is interrupted, the 
writer regards the last of these possibilities as by far the most 
probable one.
Laminaria digitata Lamx.
Though not usually classed with the Fucaced, Laminaria diijitata 
may be dealt with here, seeing that in histological structure and 
the phenomena of continuity it exhibits, it bears some resemblance 
to the forms already considered.
Sections through the thallus show that, both in the rounded 
stipes and the flattened lamina, the tissues may be described as 
FLINTSmilE PLANTS NOT RECORDF-D IN ED.
2 <)!<' ' TOP.
BOT.' 357 
epidermal, cortical, and medullary or central, though the aspect of 
these is not quite the same as the tissues so named in other forms.
In the stipes the epidermal tissue consists of several layers of small 
cells, placed in rows vertically to the surface.
The cortex is un- 
usually thick, and is formed of cellular elements with greatly 
thickened walls, while the medullary tissue is reduced to a thin 
central band.
The lamina presents the same series of tissues, but 
the epidermal layers are not so numerous.
In both portions the 
central tissue is made up of branched filamentous structures, which 
run longitudinally, closely interwoven with others of a more 
fibrous character, which, for a part of their course at least, run 
transversely.
To observe the phenomena of continuity presented by sections 
of these tissues recourse must be had to the most effective reagents 
for swelling, clarifying, and even partially dissolving the strongly- 
thickened walls of the histological elements.
In sections success- 
fully treated with these ends in view, it is not difficult to make out 
an elaborate system of connections between the protoplasts, both 
in the central and the cortical tissue.
The type of continuity here 
presented is chiefly, if not exclusively, that which is maintained 
through the intervention of a sieve -plate.
The protoplastic con- 
tents of the central structures are for the most part reduced to 
comparatively small threads, but at the transverse partitions they 
dilate to the full breadth of the plate.
In some cases the whole 
plate is traversed by the connecting threads, but in others the 
connections appear to be altogether peripheral.
The protoplasts of the cortex are rhizopod-like masses, with 
pseudopodia spreading in such a manner that the cells of each 
layer are brought into connection both with one another and with 
those of adjacent layers.
As in the centre, continuity is effected 
through the intervention of sieve-plates, the whole or merely the 
periphery of which may be traversed by the protoplasmic threads.
As in the case of Rimanthalia lurea, the presence of continuity 
in the epidermal tissue is still doubtful, though a^Dpearances are 
suggestive of it.
The fact remains, nevertheless, that in spite of 
many efforts to make a suspicion a certainty, a demonstrative case 
has not yet been met with.

Although the county of Flintshire in North Wales is of small 
extent, the Flora is varied and extensive.
Including the estuary of 
the River Dee, it possesses a considerable amount of sea-coast, and 
its geological features are of much interest.
Limestone is often 
present, so many plants are found peculiar to this formation.

THE FOESTER HERBARIUM.
By Jajies Britten, F.L.S.
The acquisition by the Kew Herbarium of some of the plants 
collected by the Forsters in the latter half of the last century was 
made the text of an interesting article by Mr. Hemsley in ' Nature ' 
for Sept.
24.
The article, however, seemed to me to require 
supplementing, inasmuch as Mr. Hemsley gave a somewhat 
erroneous impression as to our previous knowledge of these plants.
I therefore wrote to ' Nature,' pointing out certain particulars 
which I thought should be placed on record.
The Editor declmed 
to insert my letter, and I print it here.* 
Mr. Hemsley's article is as follows : — 
" Botanists will learn with pleasure that this herbarium, a 
portion of the collections of Cook's second voyage, has been 
acquired by exchange from the Liverpool Corporation for the Kew 
Herbarium ; and it will be incorporated in the general collection.
From the introduction to the ' Catalogue of Plants ' in the Botanic 
Gardens at Liverpool, published in 1808, it appears that the pro- 
prietors of that establishment possessed, at that date, about 3000 
specimens of dried plants, collected by the late Dr. Forster, in his 
voyages to the South Seas, with large and valuable contributions 
from his friends and correspondents.
How these plants came into 
their possession is uncertain, but they could hardly have been 
presented to them by Mr. Shepherd, the Curator, as stated by Sir 
Joseph Hooker in the introductory essay to his ' Flora Novg3- 
Zelandiffi,' or his name would almost certainly have been men- 
tioned as the donor.
At least this may be inferred, because on the 
very next page a very high tribute is paid to Mr. John Shepherd 
for his services to the Garden.
Be that as it may, the collection 
will shortly be accessible to botanists generally, thanks to the per- 
severance of Sir Jose]5h Hooker and the sensible view of the 
matter taken by the present members of the Corporation when it 
was represented to them that these dried plants where practically 
useless where they were, but would be valuable at a botanical 
establishment like Kew. This act of the Corporation deserves to 
be recorded, because some thirty years ago, when Sir Joseph 
Hooker was engaged on his ' Flora Novae -Z elan diie,' he applied to 
the then custodians of the collections to transmit it temporarily to 
Kew for comparison and publication, and his request was refused.
* Mr. Carruthei's has before called attention (Journ.
Bot. 1880, p.
35, 
footnote) to the action of the Editor of ' Nature ' in matters of this kind.
THE FORSTER HERBARIUM.
861 
" Botanical investigations in connection with the ' Challenger ' 
Expedition again brought to mind the existence of this interesting 
collection at Liverpool, and it was determined to make another 
effort to rescue it from oblivion, which was fortunately successful.
A few words respecting the botanical collection of Cook's voyages 
generally, and of this one in particular, will be welcome to those 
interested in botany.
Sir Joseph Banks and Dr. Solander accom- 
panied Capt.
Cook on his first voyage round the world ; John 
Eeinhold Forster and George Forster, father and son, were the 
botanists of the second voyage (1772-75) ; and Mr. Anderson, the 
surgeon of the expedition, collected a little on the third voyage.
From a statement in Sparmann's ' Travels in South Africa,' it 
seems that Forster the elder undertook the duties of naturalist to 
the expedition for the sura of £4000, and he took his son with him, 
then only seventeen years old, as an assistant.
On arriving at the 
Cape of Good Hope they fell in with Sparmann, who, at the 
instance and expense of Forster, was added to the scientific staff, 
and continued with them until the return to the Cape in 1775.
Considerable collections of plants were made in New Zealand, 
many parts of Polynesia, and the extreme south of America, and 
smaller collections in some of the Atlantic Islands, including 
St. Helena, Cape Verd Islands, and Canaries.
On returning to 
England the Forsters soon commenced publishing the botanical 
results of the expedition, and an authenticated set of all the pub- 
lished plants at least was deposited in the British Museum.
The 
Cape plants, however, which they did not publish, are apparently 
not represented there.
The first botanical work, ' Characteres 
Genera Plantarum,' appeared in 1776, and the title-page bears the 
names of both father and son, and this was the only one published 
in England.
For the rest, the botany was done by the son alone.
His ' Florula Insularum Australium Prodromus ' appeared at 
Gottingen in 1786, and ' De Plantis Esculentis Insularum Oceani 
Australis ' at Berlin, in the same year, followed by ' De Plantis 
Magellanicis et x\.tlanticis,' at Gottingen, in 1787.
" These works, we believe, constitute the whole of the published 
botany of the expedition, and, though very meagre, are extremely 
interesting, being the foundation of our knowledge of New Zealand, 
Antarctic, and Polynesian vegetation.
" The collection now acquired for Kew is excellently preserved, 
and the plants mostly named and localised.
It comprises altogether 
1359 species, 785 of which were collected on the voyage with 
Cook, and the rest, from various parts of the world, are probably 
some of those alluded to above as having been presented to Forster 
by his friends.
" The collection includes a large proportion of the plants pub- 
lished by the Forsters, but it is not complete.
Eoughly, there are 
187 species from Polynesia, 119 from New Zealand, 21 from the 
extreme south of America, 23 from the Atlantic Islands, including 
all those described by Forster from St. Helena, and 9 from Aus- 
tralia.
Besides the foregoing, which are all phanerogams, there 
are 36 ferns, but they include only a small portion of the species 
described by Forster." 
362 THE FORSTER HERBARIUM.
The following is the letter which I wrote to ' Nature,' and 
which was refused insertion : — 
"It is gratifying to learn that the Kew Herbarium lias acquired 
from Liverpool a collection of plants made by the Forsters during 
Cook's second voyage.
But I think these plants are much more 
widely distributed than Mr. Hemsley seems to imply.
Laseguc 
mentions Forster's plants as existing in the herbaria of Sir W.
J. 
Hooker, Vienna and Lcyden ; and DeCandolle (' Phytographic,' 
p. 412), states that there are " un grand nombre d'echant.
de 
I'expedition autour du monde dans I'herbier de I'Univ.
de Kiel," and 
others in the Paris Museum.
" At the British Museum we have the -herbarium of G.
Forster, 
purchased at Lambert's sale, which David Don describes as ' the 
entire Herbarium of George Forster, collected during Cook's 
circumnavigation, and from which he published his 'Florula of 
South Sea plants' (Appendix to Lambert's ' Pinus,' p.
28) ; and 
sets from other localities visited diiring the voyage, and presented 
by the Forsters to Sir Joseph Banks.
Some, at any rate, of these 
seem more extensive than those received at Kew, e.g., the latter 
collection contains ' roughly ....
23 from the Atlantic Islands ' ; 
whereas the list of plants sent to Banks by the Forsters contains 
78 species from Madeira alone.
Our collection of ferns is also 
much more extensive.
Mr. Hemsley says, ' The Cape plants ....
are apparently not represented in the museum ' ; but we have a list 
of 85 species presented to Banks by the Forsters, the specimens 
corresponding with which are in the National Herbarium.
"We have also a large collection of drawings — 301 in all — of the 
plants collected by G.
Forster during the voyage." 
Besides the plants referred to above, we have in the Museum a 
third set, included in the Herbarium of Pallas, which was also 
purchased at Lambert's sale, and of which an interesting account 
was published by Lambert in Trans.
Linn, Soc. x.
256-265.
He 
says, " George Forster ....
sent to Pallas fine specimens of all 
the plants gathered during his voyage with Cook.
I find several 
species here not in his own herbarium which I purchased some 
years ago from his father-in-law.
Professor Heyne." There is also 
a fourth set, comprising only a few specimens mounted on small 
paper and endorsed " G.
Forster's little Herbarium." 
There would seem to be some confusion as to G.
Forster's own 
herbarium.
Although D.
Don describes the collection in Heyne's 
possession as " the entire Herbarium of G.
Forster," the preceding 
rema]-k of Lambert shows that it did not contain all the plants 
collected by him.- Moreover, writing to Banks from Cassel, Nov.
26, 1780, he says, " We know not whether you were ever informed 
that, on my quitting England, my books, instruments, curiosities 
and herbal, were embarked on board a Hamburg trader, which 
was lost on the coast of Jutland.
My chests were saved, it is true; 
but, owing to my great misfortune, when I received them here, 
their contents were all thoroughly rotten ; so that the expense 
* The number of species contained in it was 453.
THE FORSTER HERBARIUM.
OOO 
of carriage hither as well as the charge of saving them from the 
wreck were a dead loss.
The loss of my herbal has never been 
replaced, as I had in it most of those specimens of which there are 
now no duplicates, except those which j^oii had from us at the 
revision of our herbals." (MSS.
Banksian Correspondence, i.
309).
This " revision of herbals " took place in 1778 ; we have a list 
in Sir Joseph Banks's handwriting headed, "List of plants given 
me by Messrs.
Forsters when I looked at their specimens in Jan. 1778 
and compared them with my Herbarium." This list contains about 
236 species, of which 85 are from the Cape ; another list enume- 
rates 78 from Madeira ; and there is also a ' Catalogue of a collec- 
tion of plants presented to Joseph Banks, Esq., by John Eeinhold 
Forster and George Forster ' (in the handwriting of the former), 
in which 255 species are enumerated, 19, however, being " blank 
or wanting in this Herbal C." 
It may be of interest to transcribe a note by Kobert Brown, 
which is among the MSS.
in the Botanical Department of the 
British Museum.
It is a copy of a memorandum by Banks, and 
Brown appends to it — " Copied March 9th, 1828, having obtained 
leave the same day to do so from Sir Edward Knatchbull, to whom 
I delivered it, along with the portrait of Captain Cook, Sir J.
Banks's diplomas, and several other things of smaller importance." 
The note runs thus:— "John Eeynhold Forster and George his son 
embarked in the year 1772 on board the ' Eesolution,' Capt.
Cook, 
bound to the South Seas on discovery, sent by the Board of 
Admiralty ; the father as naturalist and the son as his assistant, in 
my room when I was disappointed of my anxious desire of under- 
taldng that voyage, by the machinations of Sir Hugh Palliser, the 
Comptroller of the Navy.
For their reward they had 4000 pounds, 
which at my desire was voted by the House of Commons to enable 
Dr. Jas.
Lind, of Edinburgh, M.D., to accompany me ; but the vote 
having passed in vague terms it was thought proper to apply it to the 
benefit of the voyage of discovery in that manner.
On their return 
they did me the favour to present me with very many specimens, 
both of plants and animals which they had collected in the different 
countries they had visited.
In the year 1776 I purchased of them, 
for 400 pounds, all the drawings of animals and plants which they 
had made in the course of the voyage," J.
E. Forster's letter 
('Banksian Correspondence,' i.
132), dated Jan. 9, 1776, speaks of 
the sum offered by Banks as four hundred guineas.
The drawings are in various stages of completeness, some being 
coloured throughout, others in part, and others merely pencil 
sketches, some of them very incomplete.
They are localised and 
dated by Forster and named by Solander.
Among them are the 
originals of the plates illustrating G.
Forster's ' Fasciculus Plant- 
arum Magellanicarum ' in Comment.
Soc. Getting, ix.
(1789).
From them were prepared a number of copper-plates, of which 
Pritzel says, " Icones plantarum in itinere ad insulas novis aus- 
tralis coUectorum ineditte 130 tabulae senere in folio, fuerunt olim 
in Bibl.
Lambertiana." This copy is described in the Catalogue of 
Lambert's sale (April 19, 1842), as containing 131 plates, "in 
864 THE FORSTER HERBARIUM.
2 vols, royal 4to, calf"; it was bought by Mr. Bolm for £1 12s.
I 
have met with no reference to any other copy, but we have in the 
Botanical Department a similar volume, containing 129 plates, all 
written up by Solander with reference to the place where the plants 
were published, which was for the great majority Gr. Forster's 
' Prodromus.' The plates are all in a very unfinished state.
I can 
find no reference to these copper-plates, either in the ' Banksian 
Correspondence,' or in the works of either of the Forsters.
George, 
in his preface to the ' Prodromus,' speaks of the figures — mere 
details of flowers — published in the ' Characteres,' but does not 
refer to any larger work, such as must have been projected.
There are numerous letters from and concerning both the 
Forsters in the ' Banksian Correspondence,' but these do not throw 
much light upon their botanical work.
It may be worth while to 
reproduce, from Eees's ' Cycloptedia,' the account of the father : — 
" Forster, John Keinhold, an eminent naturalist and philo- 
logist, was the son of a burgomaster at Dirschaw, in Polish 
Prussia, where he was born October 22nd, in the year 1729.
In 
early youth he had few advantages for education ; but about the 
age of fifteen years he was admitted into the Gymnasium of 
Joachimsthal at Berlin.
Under the tuition of Menzelius and 
Heinsius he made considerable progress in the learned languages ; 
and he also devoted a part of his attention to the study of the 
Coptic, and to the acquisition of several of the modern languages, 
and particularly the Polish.
In the year 1748 he was entered at 
the University of Halle, where he studied Theology, and continued 
his application to the learned languages, among which he com- 
prehended the Oriental.
After three years he removed to Dantzic, 
and distinguished himself as a preacher, imitating the French 
rather than the Dutch manner ; and in 1755 he obtained a settle- 
ment at Nassenhuben.
In the following year he married his 
cousin, Elizabeth Nikolai.
During his residence in this place, he 
employed his leisure hours in the study of philosophy, geography, 
and the mathematics, without desisting from further improvements 
in his acquintance with the ancient and modern languages.
With 
a small income and increasing family, the difliculties he experienced 
induced him to accept the proposal of removing to Eussia, in order 
to superintend the new colonies at Saratow.
Much, however, as 
he was approved, during an interview with the members of Govern- 
ment at Petersburg, some circumstances occurred which rendered 
his new appointment of short duration ; but on his return to the 
capital, advantageous offers were made to him by the Academy of 
Sciences, and by that of Moscow, both which he thought proper to 
decline.
Having for some time indulged unavaihng expectations 
from the Eussian Government, he removed to London in the year 
17GG, with strong recommendations, but with very little money.
After his arrival, he received from the Government of Eussia a 
present of 100 guineas ; and he also made an addition to his stock 
by the translation of ' Kalm's Travels ' and ' Osbeck's Voyage.' At 
this time Lord Baltimore proposed to him a settlement in America, 
as superintendent of his extensive property in that country, but he

865 
preferred the place of teacher of the French, German and Natural 
History, m the dissentmg academy at Warrington.
This situation, 
however, he soon abandoned, and returning to London, he was 
engaged, in the year 1772, to accompany Captain Cook, as a 
naturalist, in his second voyage round the world.
At this time he 
was 48 years of age, and his son George, who went with him, was 
17.
Upon his return to England in 1775, the University of 
Oxford conferred upon him the degree of Doctor of Laws.
At this 
time he was projecting, with the assistance of his son, a botanical 
work in Latin, containing the characters of many new genera 
of plants, which they had discovered in the course of their voyage.
An account of the voyage having been published by his son in 
English and German, the father was supposed to have had a con- 
siderable share in it ; and as he had entered into an engagement 
not to publish anything separately from the authorized narrative, 
he thus incurred the displeasiu-e of Government, and gave offence 
to his friends.
Independently of the violation of his engagements, 
he was also chargeable with having introduced into his work 
several reflections on the Government which appointed and also on 
the navigators who conducted the expedition.
The father and sou, 
finding that, in consequence of those circumstances, their situation 
in London was become unpleasant, determined to quit England.
Before the execution of their purpose, their condition became 
embarrassed and distressing ; but happily for Mr. Forster, he was 
invited, in 1780, to be Professor of Natural History at Halle ; he 
was also appomted Inspector of the Botanical Garden, and in the 
following year he obtained the degree of M.D. His health, how- 
ever, began to decline, and the death of his son George so deeply 
impressed his mind as to aggravate his other complaints.
Towards 
the commencement of the year 1798 his case became desperate ; 
and before the close of this year, viz., on the 9th of December, his 
life terminated, at the age of 69 years and some months.
Mr.
Forster' s disposition was, unfortunately for his happiness and 
reputation, extremely irritable and litigious, and his want of 
prudence involved him in perpetual difdculties." 
It is evident, from this account, that J.
E. Forster was a man 
of very varied attainments and great energy ; the ' Banksian 
Correspondence ' contains abundant evidence that the judgment 
passed upon him in the last sentence is a correct one.
His 
dedication to Solander of the ' Flora Americse Septentrionalis ' is 
couched in terms so flattering as to be fulsome.
Forster con- 
sidered he had been unfairly treated by Cook ; and from his own 
statement of the case, as detailed in a long letter to Banks (not 
dated, but apparently written in 1778), it would seem that he had 
some ground for his belief.
It would certainly appear, from the 
following passage in a letter from Solander to Banks, dated Sept.
5, 
1755, — which I cite because it gives a contemporary opinion of 
Forster's character,— that it was at any rate contemplated that 
Forster should be part author of the account of the voyage.
" Mr. Forster overwhelms me with civilities upon your account.
He is of all men I know either the most open or the greatest fool.
366 THE FOESTER HERBAKIUM.
He certainly has made some clever remarks during the voyage ; but 
he talks rather too much of them.
You cannot imagine how much 
the man is mended since he came home ; the officers say they 
hardly know the man.
He came home thinking himself very 
great ; now he, like Bruce, is reduced, even in his own opinion.
Some days ago he desired me to call upon him, and he then 
desired me to pick out of his insects two of each species, one for 
you and one for the Museum, which I did not think proper to 
refuse.
He has very few indeed from the South Seas, but some 
very fine ones from the Cape.
I believe I told you before, that in 
the rest you are to be the third sharer : 1st, Br. Mus.
; 2nd, Eoy.
Socy.
; 3rd, Banks ; 4th, Tunstal ; 5th, Lever, &c.
" Ld. Sandwich has desired him to, by way of specimen, send 
in some sheets, containing an account of what happened at Dusky 
Bay, New Zealand.
If approved of, he is to write the account of 
the Voyage, and he is to have ^ the profits, and ^ to Captn.
Cook." 
The manuscript, when sent in, was rejected by Lord Sandwich, 
"without alledging any other ostensible reason than the general 
expression, it would not do ; " and Forster further adds, that the 
same nobleman " had already represented [him] to His Majesty as 
an obstinate, violent, and impracticable man, instead of recom- 
mending me to the King according to his promise." He certainly 
seems to have met with an unfavourable reception at court, and he 
attributes this to the action of Sandwich.
He considers he fell 
under Sandwich's displeasure on account of a circumstance which 
he thus narrates : — "I bought at the Cape of Good Hope various 
live animals in order to present them to Her Majesty, to the 
amount of 200 f.
When I arrived in England, Lord Sandwich 
came on board the ' Eesolution,' accompanied by Miss Eay. She 
saw the animals, and repeatedly told my servant she wished to have 
them ; but my man told her they were destined for Her Majesty, 
but I am sure had I preferred Lord Sandwich's mistress to the 
King's royal consort I would have done better ; whereas, now I 
have brought upon me the noble lord's odium." The whole letter is 
of interest, but too long for transcription ; it occupies pp.
171-181 
of vol.
i. of the ' Banksian Correspondence.' A letter, dated Sept.
26, 1778, shows that Forster did not despair of obtaining some 
payment from the Government : in it he writes : — 
" I have proposed Lord North a plan for sending 20 millions 
sterl., without taxing the public.
I begged only secrecy in case my 
plan were rejected, and I stipulated a sum and an annuity if it were 
adopted.
His secretary, Mr. Robinson, tells me in his letter that it 
is not usual to make stipulations, and promises that my plan shall 
be examined with candour and due attention, if I will give it to 
Ld. North without promising me the least reward.
But I have 
some notion that Lord North will not be long at the head of the 
Treasury ; and I shall reserve my j)lan for his successor, to whom 
I can likewise offer £10,000 from a foreign Prince.
You'll think me 
crazy talking in such a strain, but it is all fact." It would be in- 
teresting to know how Banks replied to this proposal.
George Forster seems to have resembled his father in many 
THE FORSTER HERBARIUM.
367 
respects.
Of his earlier work his father gives the following account in 
dedicating to him his ' Enchiridion ' (1788) : — 
" Tandem decimo a3tatis tua3 anno exacto, mccum iter in Rossiam 
suscepisti.
In hoc itinere quotidie, prout sorte res novse se olfere-

Of his life after their return to England, Eees gives the follow- 
ing sketch : — 
" On leaving England, he wished to settle at Paris.
After a 
temporary residence in that city, he removed, in the year 1779, to 
Cassel, and undertook the office of Professor of Natural History in 
the University of that place.
He afterwards accepted the offer of 
a chair in the University of Wilna, but found no permanent satis- 
faction in a country where liberty was expiring under the intrigues 
of Eussia and Prussia.
Desirous of a retreat, he entered into a 
treaty with Catherine II., who projected a voyage of discovery round 
the world ; but the proposed expedition was prevented by a war 
with the Ottoman Porte ; and thus the hopes of Forster were 
frustrated.
His active mind, however, led him to wish for useful 
employment, and the reputation which he had acquired induced the 
Elector of Mentz to appoint him President of the University of 
that city.
He hailed the dawnings of the French Eevolution, 
says M.
Pongens, little apprehending, we may say, the clouds that 
subsequently overshadowed them ; and he was deputed by the 
people of Mentz, who had formed themselves into a convention, to 
repair to Paris, and to request that they miglit be invited to the 
French Eepublic.
But while he was thus employed, the city of 
Mentz was besieged and taken by the Prussian troops.
By this 
disaster he lost his whole property, and his numerous MSS., which 
868 A NEW CHINESE SALVIA.
fell into the hands of the Prince of Prussia.
The domestic un- 
easiness of a conjugal kind, which he afterwards experienced, led 
him to form a resolution of visiting Hindoostan and Thibet, for 
which he acquired the necessary preparation, by studying the 
Oriental languages, but the chagrin occasioned by his misfortunes 
aggravating a scorbutic affection, which he had contracted during 
his voyage round the world, prevented the accomplishment of his 
purpose by terminating his existence, which event took place at 
Paris, February 15th, 1792." 
Papers like the present, if of no great importance in them- 
selves, may have the effect of inducing botanists to realise that 
there exists in the Department of Botany of the British Museum a 
vast store of material which is comparatively unknown and un- 
consulted, but which is readily accessible and of historical im- 
portance.
From time to time evidence of this has been brought 
forward in this Journal.
Mr. Hemsley's paper " On Bermuda plants 
in the Sloane Collection " (Journ.
Bot. 1883, 257), and my own on 
Masson's collection of plants and drawings (Journ.
Bot. 1884, 
114, 144), may be cited as examples ; while Mr. Jenman has 
recently examined the Ferns of Sloane's Jamaica Herbarium, with 
interesting results which will be published in the January number.

The flowers of this neat little plant are quite small, but they 
are produced most profusely, and are of so bright and delicate a 
colour, forming such a marked contrast with the olive-green 
foliage, that it is worth growing for ornament.
The species is a well-marked one, nearest in aflSnity to the 
Nipalese 6\ saxicola Wall.

SHOET NOTES.
The Charace^ of ' English Botany,' ed.
hi.
— In the review of 
the above-named work (p.
350) the Messrs.
Groves seem to me to 
have been rather severe in their criticism.
They say : — " Under 
N. nidifica Mr. Brown did not happen to see the difference between 
plants which Braun liad distinguished, so he had no doubt Braun 
was wrong, and wrote, ' The nucules examined by Braun must have 
been quite immature ones.' As if Prof.
Braun did not know unripe 
nucules when he saw them!" Now Braun himself (' Fragmenta 
einer Monographie der Characeen,' p.
94) writes, '' Tolypella nidifica 
forma intermedia, — .
. .
. Semina ....
unreif." And a few lines 
later he again says — "Antheridien habe ich niclit gesehen.
Spo- 
rangia unreif." For the Messrs.
Groves to have overlooked Braun's 
statement that the nucules were miripe is altogether inexcusable, as 
Mr. Brown devotes six lines of text to a translation of what Braun 
says.
And if Mr. Brown did consider it "questionable whether N.
nidifica and N.
glomerata are more than varieties of each other," 
yet he kept them distinct, and left the matter subjudice till the plant 
should " again be found in the British Isles." And Braun himself 
admitted that he was doubtful to which of the two his ''forma 
intermedia" was most allied.
Ecspectiug the absence of nucules 
from Borrer's Lancing specimen of X.
(jlomerata var.
SmitJiii, Mr.
Brown is certainly wrong.
I have examined a small branch of this 
specimen, and find very young nucules present ; but it requires a 
magnification of 150 diameters to make out clearly that they are 
nucules.
The specimen is in a very young state ; the best developed 
nucule I found being in the condition represented in Sachs' ' Text- 
book,' ed.
i., fig.
208 (ed.
2, fig, 201).
I could not find them at all 
on some branchlets.
The blunder may be '• inexcusable," but Mr.
Brown is not the first to make it.
The specimen is figured in 
Sowerby's ' English Botany,' t.
1708.
Sowerby found no nucules, 
so added a fragment from another plant (from Cley) to show a 
nucule.
Sir James E.
Smith (in the description) says, "no germens 
[nucules] could be found." Borrer (Engl.
Bot. Suppl.
sub t.
2762, 
correcting an error as to the locality of the Lancing specimen) 
states, "no nucules were produced." It is clear that these authors 
are wrong, and it is also satisfactory to be able to clear up a 
batch of blunders.
But I think it would have been better to 
have left the reference to "intense egotism" out of the question.
