EDITORIAL.
At the end of last year I made a special appeal to the 
readers of this Journal to extend its circulation.
That appeal 
has been responded to, and I have now the satisfaction of 
stating as a result that the balance, although not a large one, 
is this year on the right side.
I shall therefore be able during 
1884 to return to the original plan of the Journal, and issue a 
plate with each number.
Certain alterations in arrangement 
— some of which have already been adopted — will enable me 
to give additional matter without increasing the cost of 
production.
It is therefore my pleasant task to thank the many friends 
— some of them known to me, others unknown— whose help 
has brought about this satisfactory state of affairs.
To both 
contributors and subscribers I tender my grateful acknow- 
ledgments for their help in the past, while I venture to express 
a confident hope that I may look forward to its continuance in 
the future.

A SYNOPSIS OF THE GENUS SELAGINELLA.
By J.
G. Baker, F.R.S., &c.
Ferns excluded, half the known number of species of vascular 
Cryptogaruia belong to the genus Selagindla, as recast by Spring.
What was known about them from a structural, systematic, and 
geographical point of view was fully and carefully summed up by 
Spring in the second volume of his Monograph on the Lycopo- 
diaceae ' which was published in 1848.
Since that date a large 
number of new species have been collected by various travellers, 
but only a small proportion of them have been named and de- 
scribed.
The genus at the present time would make an excellent 
subject for a new monograph on the scale of Spring's, and I should 
much like to recommend such an undertaking to any of our 
younger cryptogamists who are in search of a speciality.
What I 
have attempted in the present paper is merely a working synopsis 
on the same scale as our ' Synopsis Filicuin.' The leaf-organs in 
this genus, by their arrangement upon either a distichous or multi- 
farious plan and then- uniformity in shape and character or dimor- 
phism, furnish four excellent primary subdivisions, and there is 
seldom, although not invariably, any room for doubt under which 
any given species, when in a state of fructification, should be 
classified.
In Sehn/hiella dimorphism in shape and the distichous 
plan in arrangement is the rule as regards the proper leaves, but 
we have an exception to this in the only British representative of 
the genus and a few of its allies.
In Lycopodiam f on the other 
hand, uniformity in shape and the multifarious plan in arrange- 
ment is almost universal, there being three exceptional species 
(compla nation, volatile, and scariosion).
The Selaginellas have always 
the fructification concentrated into a distinct terminal spike, never 
as in the Selago Lycopodiums (which constitute half the genus) and 
Psilotum, placed in the axils of entirely unmodified leaves all down 
the stem.
In a minority, but yet a considerable number of Sela- 
ginellas, dimorphism in shape and a distichous plan of arrangement 
is carried out not only in the proper leaves, but also in the bracts

of the spike.
Nearly always (and I am quite unable to see any 
reason for this, and should much like to have it explained) the 
smaller bracts are on the same plane as the larger leaves, and 
the larger bracts are on the same plane as the smaller and more 
ascending leaves.
In the majority of Selaginellas (those constituting 
the subgenus for which I have used Palisot Beauvois' name of 
Stachygynandrum) we have distichous dimorphic leaves, but a 
square fruit-spike, with bracts of uniform shape.
The genus is 
concentrated in the tropical zone, and has its head-quarters in 
Tropical America.
Only two species extend their range into 
Europe, and the Selaginellas of the Cape, Temperate Australia, and 
South Temperate America are neither numerous nor remarkable.
In the New World and the Old World the species are entirely 
different, with but one exception amongst the distichous -leaved 
tropical species, S.
flabellata, and two of the multifarious-leaved 
species, S.
rupestris and spiuulosa, both of which are character- 
istically temperate types.
It is very rarely that any of the tropical 
species is found in more than one of the three continents, but 
it will be seen that three out of the four subgenera and most of 
the subordinate groups are represented alike in America, Asia, and 
Africa.

Sporangia minute, orbicular, laterally compressed, membranous, 
1 -celled, inserted in the axils of bracts so as to form a dense spike 
at the end of the leafy branches, the microsporangia numerous, 
the macrosporangia few and confined to the base of the spike.
Microsporangia slitting across the top of the broad diameter, con- 
taining numerous dust-like microspores.
Macrosporangia usually

quadrangular, the faces angled (stems goniotropous, Spring) or the 
faces flat (stems pleurotropous, Spring) ; nodes sometimes dis- 
tinctly articulated.

CINCHONA LEDGEEIANA A HYBRID.
By Otto Kuntze, Ph.D.
Dr. Henry Trimen published in this Journal for 1881 (pp.
321-325) a paper entitled M Cinchona Ledgeriana, a distinct species/ 1 
wherein he maintains that C.
Ledgeriana is not a variety of C.
Calisaya, as Mr. J.
E. Howard had svipposed.
He cites the 
following marks in support of his position : — (1) the leaves of C.
Ledgeriana have always the broadest part at or about the middle, 
(2) the flowers approach those of C.
micrantha in their drooping 
habit, small size, short inflated tube, white colour, and also (3) by 
their buds, which are not at all or very slightly widened at the 
end, and never abruptly enlarged there, as they are in C.
Calisaya.
This last character is new to me.
C. Calisaya and C.
micrantha are the only species mentioned as 
nearly allied to C.
Ledgeriana.
I have described indeed ( '.
Ledgeriana 
as a hybrid of these two species in my monograph of Cinchona,* 
wherein I acknowledge only four species : — Wreddelliana = C.
Calisaya pro parte; C.
Pavoniana = C.
micrantha p.p.; C.
Howardi- 
ana = C.
succimbra p.
p. and C.
Pahudiana How. All other 
Cinchonas I regard as synonyms or hybrids of those four species.
The hybridization of Cinchonas has been proved (1) by some direct 
artificial production of several hybrids, (2) by the fact that the 
( 2 
nth 
seeds of marked trees produced plants with the mixed characters 
of another species.
There cannot be any doubt as to the copious 
hybridization of Cinchonas ; and it is well known that the hybrids 
in the Cinchona plantations have plenty of good fertile seeds ; 
only C.
Ledgeriana shows an exception, and its more or less great 
sterility has been often noticed.

6 CINCHONA LEDGERIANA A HYBRID.
Cinchona Lcdgeriana originated spontaneously in the government 
plantations of Mungpo in Sikkim, as published by me in my 
monograph of Cinchona.
Dr. Trimen did not know this fact, and 
it would seem that he has not read my monograph ; for he writes 
(p.
322), " I made inquiries of Mr. Moens, who assured me that he 
never saw anything like ledgeriana ....
to come from seed of a 
Calisaya.
I understand that Mr. Gammie has the same experience." 
During my visit to Java I never observed spontaneous C Ledgeriana, 
but in Mungpo- Sikkim Mr. Gammie and the late Mr. Biermann 
assured me that " C.
Ledgeriana had originated spontaneously there 
in the Calisaya-field." Besides Dr. Trimen supports this state- 
ment, saving " In our own plantations in Sikkim, after years of 
neglect as one of the troublesome and hopelessly variable forms of 
C. Calisaya, the plant (C.
Ledgeriana) is now the object of careful 
cultivation." Dr. Trimen is therefore in error to write that " all 
existing plants in the East are descendants of seeds collected .
. .
in Bolivia, in June, 1865." 
But the testimony of the Cinchona cultivators — valuable as it 
may be — is not necessary, for we know a fact that proves the 
hybrid origin of C.
Ledgeriana in Mungpo : the imported Cinchonas 
in Mungpo are trees, with exception of C.
Calisaya, and all descen- 
dants of C.
Calisaya are shrubs ; pure Calisaya are small shrubs, 
and the hybridized Calisaya are very large shrubs, because the 
other hybridizing Cinchonas are only trees.
C. Ledgeriana of 
Mungpo is also a large shrub ; it became only more tree-like by 
the art of the cultivators, who prefer trees for bark collecting.
When I visited Mungpo C.
Ledgeriana was mostly not yet tree-like.
In contrast to this shrubby Ledgeriana of Mungpo the descen- 
dants of Bolivian Ledgeriana in Java, and Southern India, perhaps 
also in private Sikkim plantations, are veritable trees.
I do not 
know if there has been imported Bolivian Ledgeriana to the Mungpo 
government plantations after 1875 ; but until that date no Bolivian 
Ledgeriana existed there.
The Mungpo Ledgeriana shows another individual mark, by 
which I can easily distinguish it from Bolivian Ledgeriana ; the 
former has very divaricate panicles with slender ramification, the 
Bolivian descendants have a more dense panicle with thicker or 
shorter branches.
The C.
micrantha of Mungpo has accidentally 
such slender divaricate panicles, and all its hybrids at Mungpo, as 
well as C.
Ledgeriana, show that individual mark.
The Mungpo 
Calisaya-field is of very great extension, and it is the same place 
on which the former intendant of that plantation, Mr. C.
B. Clarke, 
sowed the Calisaya.
Mr. Clarke said in November, 1875, to me, 
" We sowed Calisaya and got other plants," and among these 
other plants were many shrubs of C.
Ledgeriana.
I am anxious to correct the erroneous point of Dr. Triinen's 
publication, because Dr. A.
Garcke* has briefly quoted the paper 
of Dr. Trimen against my deduction of the hybrid origin of C.
Ledgeriana ; he says also " Messrs.
Moens and Trimen prove that 
* i 
Handworterbui'h der Pharmakognosie von Wittstein," 1882, p.
131.
CINCHONA LEDGERIANA A HYBRID.
7 
C. Ledgeriana bears fruits like all other Cinchonas, and they 
consider it therefore as a distinct species." As all other artificial 
and spontaneous Cinchona hybrids ripen good seeds plentifully, 
the fertility only would be no proof for the establishment of a 
species ; besides, the fertility of C.
Ledgeriana is neither existing 
nor confirmed by Dr. Trimen in that manner.
* Cinchona Ledgeriana is the only Cinchona that suffers from 
sterility, and only ripens more fruits, if it gets fertilized and 
hybridized by other Cinchonas ; that happens often, and therefore 
the descendants of Ledgeriana are mostly degenerated, and the 
so-called Ledgeriana-b&vk of Java contains often very little quinine 
(till only 0-8 per cent !).
Dr. Trimen says that " the seedlings 
[of C.
Ledgeriana] , since Mr. Gammie uprooted nearly all the 
neighbouring trees, come remarkably true, whereas before that 
was done the sporting was so great that Dr. King would not 
propagate by seed at all/' No Cinchona species shows a similar 
degeneration as C.
Ledgeriana if growing between other Cinchonas ; 
even the Calisaya-field of Mungpo shows yet a greater part of 
true C.
Calisaya, Dr. Trimen says nothing about the great 
fertility of C.
Ledgeriana, as Dr. Garcke supposes, but he gives an 
illustration of partly abortive fruits.
I may refer to some other 
notes on the fertility of C.
Ledgeriana : Ledger wrote to Howard,* 
on the discovery of C.
Ledgeriana in Bolivia, " he then told me 
the best bark trees had not produced ripe seeds for four years/' 
whereof frost cannot be the cause, for all other Cinchonas there 
around ripened good seeds.
In the " Berigte nopens de Gouverne- 
ments Kina Onderneming" (2.
Kwartaal 1874, No. 19) we read, 
G. Ledgerianas give few seeds, and deceive us ; the best trees were 
flowering to death.
In the 3rd Kwartaal, 1875 : from C.
Ledgeriana 
only fifty trees ripen sometimes a few fruits.
In the 4th Kwartaal, 
1877 : the seeds of C.
Ledgeriana have failed.
Visiting the Java 
and Mungpo plantations I observed also the poor fertility of C.
Ledgeriana.
As all other Cinchona hybrids are always extremely fertile, I 
suppose C.
Ledgeriana must be an irregular hybrid ; irregular, 
because the several qualities of the two parent species are not well 
combined as in the regular hybrids of Cinchona.
For instance, 
officinalis 
gular 
Calisaya and 0.
species.
Both hybrids have the broadest part of the leaves at or 
about the middle, because C.
Calisaya has leaves with the broadest 
part below the middle, and C.
micrantha has leaves with the 
broadest part above the middle ; C.
officinalis, which also originated 
spontaneously in Mungpo, shows intermediate flowers and fruits 
with little variability, but C.
Ledgeriana possesses the flowers of C.
micrantha and the fruits of C.
Calisaya, and shows great variability.
Dr. Trimen confirms the great affinity of C.
officinalis and C.
eriana

8 CINCHONA LEDGERIANA A HYBRID.
If we consider that (1) C.
ledgeriana after its doubtless origin 
as a high shrub in the Calisaya-field of Mungpo must be a hybrid, 
(2) C.
Ledgeriana is a very rare plant of the American Cinchona 
region, (8) C.
Ledgeriana shows only small fertility with its own 
pollen, (4) G.
Ledgeriana shows the best character of hybrids^ in 
preferring strange pollen to its own, as its typical degeneration 
proves, (5) C.
Ledgeriana shows only the specific qualities of C.
Calisaya and C.
micrantha — we must conclude that C.
Ledgeriana 
is neither a variety of C.
Calisaya nor a distinct species, but a 
hybrid of C.
Calisaya with C.
micrantha.
I gave two theses on the quantity of quinine in the bark 
relating to the hybridity : — 
(1) Only for the regular hybrids : the quantity of quinine 
increases by hybridity.
For instance, the bark containing quinine 
averages :* 
i. C.
Howarddana (succirubra, p.p.), 0-98 per cent.
ii.
('.
Pahudiana Howard, 0-15 per cent, 
in.
C. Pavoniana (micrantha p.p.), 0*01 per cent, 
iv.
('.
WeddeHiana (Calisaya p.p.), 0-84 per cent.
i. x ii.
(( '.
I'ubescens Vahl, cordifolia Mutis, purpurea K.&P., 
caloptera Miq.), 072 per cent.

(C.
heterophylla Pavon), no analysis existing.

(C.
Humboldtiana Lambert, C.
Hasskarliana Miq.), 
070 per cent,

x iv.
(C officinalis Hooker), 2-58 per cent.
(2).
Only for irregular hybrids (till now only C.
Ledgeriana): 
with the greater irregularity [i, e.
the more the several marks of 
the parents are separate in the hybrid) increases the quantity of 
quinine.
That is proved by my choice of the best sorts according 
to the botanical qualities of the many forms of C.
Ledgeriana in 
Mungpo, and confirmed by the analysis of their barks.
On the origin of the irregular hybrid I gave the following 
hypothesis, which must yet be confirmed by experiment: the 
pollen of a newly sprung hybrid fertilized the ovary of a species.
As the regular Cinchona-hybrids of older origin seem to act like 
species it would be better to prefer new or young hybrids.
I 
recommend the fertilization with pollen of long-styled hybrid 
flowers on the stigma of long- styled parent (species) flowers, or 
with the pollen of short-styled hybrid flowers on the stigma of 
short-styled parent flowers, because the crossing of equal hetero- 
styled flowers acts like a hybridization and therefore the effects of 
hybridization must be increased.
This is only a scientific hypo- 
thesis, but the experiment causes no extraordinary expenses to 
Cinchona planters and it is easy to execute : as the stamens are 
inserted in the corolla tube it is only necessary to put away, before 
the corolla is opened (or the pollen is not yet developed), the

deciduous corolla from the flower whose stigma shall be fertilized ; 
further to take the opened corolla with mature pollen of the hybrid 
and to put it over the isolated style of the other plant.
The 
experiment promises great success by increased quantity of quinine, 
so that it may be recommended to all Cinchona cultivators.
ON THE CHINESE PLANTS COLLECTED BY 
D'INCARVILLE (1740-1757).
By Francis Blackwell Forbes, F.L.S.
The valuable paper on " Early European Eesearches into the 
Flora of China/** contributed by Dr. Bretschneider to the ' Journal 
of the North China Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society for 1880/ 
has already led to the unearthing of one of the botanical treasures 
to which he drew attention.
On page 120 of his pamphlet he 
noticed the work of the Jesuit Father d'Incarville, who was a 
missionary in Peking from 1740 till his death there in 1757, and 
who during his residence not only transmitted to Europe the seeds 
of many plants which have since become well known in cultivation, 
but forwarded to his instructor Bernard de Jussieu, in Paris, 
dried specimens collected with a care unusual at that time.
Regarding these specimens Dr. Bretschneider says: — <; I am not 
aware to what number of species this collection amounts.
It has 
been incorporated with the herbarium of the Museum of Paris, 
but has never been worked up in any regular form.
Only a few 
new plants of it have been occasionally selected for publication by 
French botanists, and, it is strange to say, from thirty to eighty 
years and more after the specimens were received in Paris." 
Luckily for those who are interested in Chinese plants, the 
above paragraph attracted the attention of the eminent botanist 
M. Franchet, who is now on the staff of the Museum d'Histoire 
Naturelle in Paris, and who soon succeeded in finding Father 
d'Incarville's specimens there.
Having as far as possible deter- 
mined them, he laid the result before the Societe Botanique de 
France on January 13th of last year, f exhibiting at the same time 
the packet of specimens which d'lncarville had collected at and 
near Peking.
It appears from M.
Franchet's paper that d'Incarville's plants 
are now in the Paris Museum just as they were when generously 
handed over in 1857 by the heirs of Adr. de Jussieu.
The most 
interesting are 149 species collected in the Peking district, and 
since preserved in a special packet in the order given them by the 
collector himself.
i Of the remaining 144 species, all from Macao, 
thirty-five specimens are now to be found in the herbarium of

A. L.
de Jussieu, and the rest have been kept, like the Peking 
plants, in a special packet.
I append an abstract of M.
Franchet's list of the plants, in the 
belief that it is well worthy of reproduction in a Journal where it 
will be more accessible to English readers than in the French 
Botanical Society's 'Transactions/ The letter "P" before the 
names indicates that the plants were collected in the Peking 
district, the letter "M" that they came from Macao.
An asterisk 
after the specific name indicates that seeds were transmitted by 
d'Inearville at the same time as the specimens.
M. Franchet 
informs us that some of these seeds are still at the Museum, while 
the others were no doubt sown and became the origin of the 
Chinese plants cultivated for more than a century at the gardens, 
this being the case with Polygonum tiuctorium L., Callistephus 
chinensis Nees, (Ueditschia sinensis Lamk., and probably also with 
Sophora japonica L.
The following translations from M.
Franchet's notes may be of 
interest: — "I must here join my regrets to those of Dr. Bret- 
sclmeider, and with him deplore the neglect with which Father 
d'Incarville' s plants have been treated for nearly a century and a 
half.
I have found scarcely twenty-five species which have been 
studied snd named in his two herbaria, and when among these are 
seen generic types of a real interest like Ailantits glandulosa Desf., 
Incur cillea sinensis A.
L. Juss., Cedrela sinensis Adr. Juss., we cannot 
help feeling surprised that such materials should not have further 
stimulated the scientific curiosity of their possessors.
Perhaps the 
reason of this indifference may be sought in the poverty of the 
specimens, some of which might at first sight appear insufficient 
for strict determination.
" However this may be, it is none the less true that the types 
of most of the genera recognised and described by M.
de Bunge 
in 1832 had existed hi a French collection since 1740, and that to 
the learned Jesuit must be referred the discovery of Orychophragmus, 
Ictinidia, Xanthoceras, Paratropia, Myripnois, Botryospermum, &c.
Furthermore, he was the first to gather those rare species which up 
to the present have only been found in Northern China — Anemone 
chinensis Bunge, CorycUdis Bungeana Turcz., Zanthoxylum Avicenna 
Lamk., Indigo/era Bnngeana Steud., Deutzia parvijiora and D.
grandifiora Bunge, Oxytropis hirta Bunge, Guldenstaedtia multiflora 
Bunge, Viburnum fragrans Bunge, Myri}>nois dioica Bunge (a curious

amiirensis Kupr.
and S.
villosa Vahl, Andrachne chinensis Bunge, 
Selaginella mongoliea Rupr.
and S.
Stauntoniana Spring, &c.
u One of the characteristic traits of Father d'Incarville's col- 
lections is that each plant has its label, giving sometimes its 
popular French name, sometimes its name in Latin, or more rarely 
in Chinese.
Besides this, the locality of each plant is exactly 
indicated, a remarkable thing for that period.
For instance, in the 
little special herbarium the collector lias taken care to distinguish 
the plants gathered in Peking itself from those which came from the 
mountains near the city.
The Macao plants are also kept perfectly

distinct.
In these various ways are indicated the care taken by 
Father d'Incarville in collecting, and the confidence which can be 
placed in his information.
" 
When I was in Paris last June, on my way home from China, 
I had the pleasure, by the courtesy of M.
Franchet, of looking over 
the packet of Peking plants.
Although the specimens are, as 
M. Franchet says, poor according to modern ideas, they do not 
appear to me on the whole worse than some which 1 have since 
examined in the Linnean herbarium.
That they have abundantly 
sufficed for determination in the hands of a competent botanist is 
evident from the fact that, out of the 289 specimens : ' : enumerated, 
there are only thirteen to which M.
Franchet has not ventured to 
give specific names.
The fate of the early collections of Chinese botanical specimens 
sent to Europe, with one exception, can hardly be deemed 
fortunate.
The earliest of all was made by James Cunningham, 
an Englishman in the East India Company's service, who, between 
the years 1698 and 1703, was stationed at the island of Chusan 
and at the more southerly port of Amoy.
The next collectors 
were d'Incarville at the north, and Peter Osbeck, who, as chaplain 
of a Swedish Indiaman, was at Canton for about four months in 
1751, or at about the middle period of d'Incarville's missionary 
residence in Peking.
Three other Swedish East India Company's 
employes — Toreen, Eekeberg, and Sparrmann — were also in Can- 
ton between 1762 and 1766, and contributed to science either 
botanical notes or specimens.
Later on, between 1779 and 1782, 
the Portuguese missionary Loureiro, author of the   Flora Cochin - 
ehinensis,' was also at Canton, where, as Dr. Bretschneider t 
states, he has enumerated the collection of 294 species.
Of the above the Swedish collectors have fared decidedly the 
best, because they alone had the inestimable advantage of sending 
then* specimens direct to LinnaBixs, who forthwith made them 
available to science by publication.
The Linnean herbarium itself, 
as far as I can judge from a slight examination, appears to tell but 
little as to the origin of specimens, but I have reason to believe 
that among his manuscripts will be found enough indications for a 
tolerably complete list of the Chinese plants which were in his 
hands.
There is a voluminous correspondence with Osbeck, from 
whom no doubt most of the specimens came, and further informa- 
tion will probably be found among Linnaeus' s MS.
notes in his 
interleaved copy of the ' Species Plantarum.' 
Father d'Incarville' s plants, as we see, have only now come to 
light, nearly 150 years after their collection.
Of Loureiro's 
herbarium, such part as the army of the first Napoleon could 
manage to carry away from Portugal is now at the Jardin des 
• Although M.
Franchet (I.e., p.
B) says that d'Incarville '3 collections com- 
prise 149 species from the Peking district and 144 species from Macao, or a total 
of 293 species, his lisf enumerates only 289 labelled specimens under 273 
species.
Probably the discrepancy may be duo only to a printer's error.

Plantes at Paris, and some specimens sent to England by Loureiro 
himself are at the British Museum,!
in both cases intercalated in 
the general collections; in neither case, so far as I am aware, 
either catalogued or fully worked up.
The English Cunningham, full notices of whose works have been 
brought together with so much pains by Dr. Bretschneider, cannot 
be said to have fallen entirely into oblivion, as his name is 
commemorated in Cunninghamia sinensis R.
Br. Still, his Chinese 
collections have remained in the Sloane Herbarium for nearly 200 
years, with very few exceptions undetermined.
I have lately 
looked over his Chusan plants, and I agree with the Editor (' Journ.
Bot.,' 1882, p.
249) that many of the specimens, small as they 
mostly are, could be readily identified by anyone familiar with the 
A number of them I am sure 
can be easily matched from my own collections in the Shanghai 
and Ningpo districts.
Dr. Bretschneider, on page 44 of his ' Early Researches,' says : 
M It appears from Cunningham's letters and from Petiver's 
quotations that the latter had also received from Cunningham a 
collection of Chinese drawings representing Chinese plants.
Petiver frequently speaks of Herbarium nostrum sinense pictum." 
In answer to my recent enquiries at the British Museum, a 
gentleman well acquainted with the Sloane manuscripts informs me 
that he has no recollection of ever coming across the " herbarium

that it refers to the "herbarium pictum" in question ; and I hope 
soon to have an opportunity of making a further search for the 
drawings themselves.

ON THE FLORA OF THE UPPER TAMAR AND 
NEIGHBOURING DISTRICTS.
By the Eev. W.
Moyle Sogers, F.L.S.
The following notes embody the chief results of a season's 
botanizing in a neighbourhood quite new to me.
No stations are 
given but those in which the plants referred to were seen in 1882, 
either by myself, or by my friend Mr. T.
B. Archer Briggs, who 
during a week's stay at my, house in August explored much of the 
country and added greatly to my knowledge of its Flora.
The parts most examined are the river valley in my own 
immediate neighbourhood at Bridgerule, and the coast about Bude 
where I spent three weeks in July- But it seems best to divide 
the whole country treated of into four districts as follows : 
I. The seaboard from the N.
W. boundary of Cornwall at 
Morwinstow to Tintagel ; with the road along the high ground 
from Launceston to Kilkhampton as eastern limit.
II.
The valley west of the Tamar, from its source to Launceston, 
including both sides of the Launceston and Kilkhampton Boad.
III.
The country east of the Upper Tamar and drained by its 
affluents, extending nearly to Okehampton.
IV.
The Okement and Upper Taw.
L and II.
are in E.
Cornwall ; III.
and IV.
in N.
Devon.
Three interesting papers on the Flora of I.
and II.
by the Bev.
Dr. Hind and Messrs.
J. G.
Baker and T, B.
A. Briggs, respec- 
tively will be found in this Journal for 1873, pp.
36-43, 97-101.
What I now contribute is supplemental to what appears in 
these papers.
Indeed all the actual stations named here are, I 
believe, additional to those hitherto published ; except in the few 
instances in which the name of the earlier recorder is found in 
brackets after the station.
The Tamar divides the parish of Bridgerule into Bridgerule 
West and Bridgerule East.
Hence the frequent occurrence in 
these notes of " Bridgerule ' in two of the districts (II.
and III.), 
in Cornwall and Devon respectively.
By " New record is meant a species not hitherto recorded for 
the vice-county, so far as I can ascertain.

NOTES ON BRITISH CHARACEJE.
By Henry & James Groves.
The following notes are the result of the examination of 
specimens, which have passed through our hands, during the past 
year.
The most important additions to our previous records are 
Xitella mncronata from Beds., Chara tomentosa from Norfolk, C.
baltica from Dorset, and C.
tenuissima from Anglesea.
We would thank our correspondents for the many specimens 
which they have given us the opportunity of examining.
We are 
especially indebted to Mr. Arthur Bennett for the large number 
received from him.
In cases where more than one specimen of a 
species has been received from the same county, the earliest col- 
lected has been used.
Much still remains to be done in working out the distribution 
of our Characece.
Of the 71 botanical counties m England and 
Wales there are 19 from which we have not been able to record a 
single species, from the 41 Scottish counties 21, and from the 37 
Irish counties 21.
We shall therefore be very glad to see any 
specimens that may be collected, in order as far as possible to 
complete the census.
A list of the species has been added, with the number of counties 
and vice-counties from which we have seen specimens.

By H.
C. Hart, B.A.
Innishowen, the north-east part of Co. Donegal, is a well-marked 
and naturally defined division of the county.
It lies between 
Loughs Foyle and Swilly, running northwards to Malin Head, the 
extreme northern part of Ireland in latitude 55° 23 ', while it is 
bounded by a line drawn irregularly across the narrowest part of 
the neck of land between the upper parts of the two loughs.
The 
district under consideration thus includes about half the eastern 
boundary of the comity, as well as the extreme northern parts.
It 
is composed of three baronies — East Innishowen, West Innishowen, 
and the north-west Liberties of Derry or Templemore, which was 
formerly a part of Innishowen, and is so geographically, being in- 
cluded in the Donegal province by the author of the ' Cybele 
Hibernica.' The total area of Innishowen is three hundred and.
eighteen square miles.
Innishowen extends from its most southern part along the 
Foyle below the point of junction of the three counties, Derry, 
Tyrone and Donegal, to Malin Head due north, a distance of 
thirty-one miles ; w r hile its greatest width from Innishowen Head 
on the east to Dunree on the west is twenty-five miles.
Its shape 
is roughly that of a boy's kite, lying evenly north and south.
The 
geological structure of Innishowen is of Cambrio- Silurian age, with 
much quartzose and gneiss, the latter probably of Laurentian age.
Granite occurs at Dunaff Head chiefly, and trap rocks are repre- 
sented there also and more abundantly near Buncrana, while in the 
main part some of the mountains, as Bulbein, expose sections of 
schist, shales, and impure limestone.
There is little limestone, and 
the prevalence of that most barren of all rocks, quartzose, is detri- 
mental to the vegetation, especially in the western mountainous 
margin bounded by Lough Swilly, which would otherwise, no 
24 ON THE FLORA OF INNISHOWEN, CO.
DONEGAL.
doubt, contain a good alpine flora.
The surface of the country is 
for the most part mountainous, a raised table-land, with outer 
mountains and many valleys penetrating far, giving slopes and 
lower levels, which afford rich agricultural districts.
The moun- 
tains find their highest point in Slieve Snacht, 2019 feet ; Rachtin- 
more, 1657 feet ; and Bulbein Mount, 1650 feet.
Cultivation 
extends up to about 750 or 800 feet in favoured places, as on the 
southern slopes of The Scalp.
There are several mountain lakes, 
some considerable estuaries, with salt-marshes and low muddy 
flats.
Two of these estuaries, those of Malin and Culdaff, partly 
separate the extreme peninsula of Malin from the mainland, and 
with this outer headland I have dealt separately.
The coast-line of Innishowen is in many parts wild and magni- 
ficent ; from Glengad Head to Stook-a-ruddan a fine series of pre- 
cipitous headlands faces the sea, and the walk from Culdaff to 
Malin Head, which included this coast, was one well worth the 
labour.
The rugged boldness of Malin Head itself should be seen 
in a storm to be properly appreciated ; nevertheless, there is one 
inlet west of the Signal-tower which gives an idea, even in a calm, 
of the terrible force of the Atlantic " cataract sea." In the water 
stand dislodged pinnacles of rock, while around and above freshly- 
fallen or tottering boulders give the place an appearance as if it 
had been recently shelled or blasted.
There is one headland at the 
entrance of Lough S willy, Dunaff Head, which, though scarcely 
700 feet high, is, in my opinion, the most fascinating bit of sea- 
cliff scenery in Ireland.
In variety of shape, sheerness of descent, 
with grand and picturesque grouping and surroundings, I have 
found nothing to surpass it.
I have endeavoured to show that the surface of Innishowen is 
of very varied character, and well adapted for sheltering plants 
whose requirements are widely different ; and I trust that I shall 
be able to prove that the flora is a highly interesting one.
Apart 
from its importance geographically, in studying the distribution of 
Irish plants, the occurrence of several very rare and local species 
renders it doubly attractive.
A separate list of them, which are 
chiefly alpine and northern, will be given later on.
Innishowen has attracted many botanists.
The illustrious 
Robert Brown visited it in his earlier days.
Subsequently to him, 
Dr. Dickie, Dr. Moore, and Mr. Charles Moore all paid attention to 
it, and from their records in the ' Flora of Ulster,' compiled by 
Dr. Dickie, — a list given in the Ordnance Survey Report of 
plants found in the parish of Templemore, about Deny, by Dr.
Moore, has been also referred to, — and the * Cybele Hibernica,' by 
Dr. Moore and A.
G. More, much information has been derived.
I am also indebted to the recent observations of my cousin, W.
E. 
Hart, of Kilderry, for many notes of the plants about Greencastle ; 
a list which he has supplied me with those in that neighbourhood 
and about Glenagivney and Moville, Fahan and Kilderry, being 
frequently quoted from in the following pages.
My own observations were made through a series of years 
during numerous visits to the western parts of Innishowen from 
ON THE FLORA OF INNISHOWEN, CO.
DONEGAL.
25 
Lough Swilly ; while in the present year I examined the coast-line 
from G-reencastle to Binnion, a little east of Dunaff, as well as 
botanising the mountain lakes and moors, exploring the higher 
mountains, and making a detailed examination of the estuaries, 
swamps, and reclaimed lands in the neighbourhood of Inch Island 
and Blanket Nook.
A visit to Innishtrahull was unfortunately 
hindered by rough weather, but Dr. Dickie has given an estimate 
of the flora of that remote island, which proves it of no special 
interest.
Several parts of Innishowen may, perhaps, require further 
examination, and for some, especially those in the immediate 
neighbourhood of Derry, I am relying upon the observations of 
other botanists.
Moreover, I have seldom had opportunities of 
spring visits ; thus my list is perhaps deficient in some of the 
earlier grasses, sedges, and orchids.
But the labours of Drs.
Dickie and Moore no doubt cover many of these supposed gaps, 
and my information is, I believe, on the whole sufficient to give a 
good, if not an exhaustive, account of the plants.
Fifteen, or at 
the most I should think twenty, species, unrecorded here, may 
yet probably be found.
The present paper, as well as others 
written by me for this Journal, may be regarded as being a portion 
of what it is my hope in time to complete, a Flora of the County 
Donegal ; and having this in mind I have no hesitation in offering 
it for publication.
I will first give a list of the rarest species occurring ; localities 
will be found in the systematic list.
Corydalis claviculata.
Calaniintha Clinopodium.
Draba incana.
Mertensia maritima.
Crambe maritima.
Polygonum viviparum.
Silene acaulis.
Ceratophyllum demersum.
Ligusticum scoticum.
Poa compressa.
Sium latifolium.
Elymus arenarius.
Saussurea alpina.
Equisetuni umbrosum.
Bartsia viscosa.
Of the above, Corydalis has been already recorded by W.
E. 
Hart, but the record has not found its way into the pages of the 
1 Cybele Hibernica/ nor its Supplement.
With regard to Crambe, 
I shall be more explicit, since it is a very rare plant, and has 
become extinct in several of its Irish localities.
The record in the 
' Cybele Hibernica 'is "at Nonvany Point, in the parish of Clon- 
mary, Donegal.
Mr. Charles Moore." I was quite familiar with 
this record, and have always hoped, in my Donegal excursions, to 
discover Nonvany Point sooner or later.
The name, however, not 
being known in Innishowen, either on the map or by the inhabi- 
tants, I believed it to be in some other part of the county ; nor was 
it till my return this year that it occurred to me that " Clonmary" 
must be a misprint for " Clonmany," and "Nonvany" perhaps 
stand for " Norway," which is a name on the map near a point a 
little east of Dunaff Head, a point included in a space of about 
three miles, which I have never succeeded in reaching, but which I

shall make an early opportunity of examining.
This mysterious 
point is twice subsequently quoted in the   Cybele,' under Ligusticum 
scoticum and Mertensia maritima ; and a station given under Eu- 
phorbia portlandica, "Rocks at Cockmany, Innishowen," is most 
likely referable to the same locality.
Siam latifoliiim is included, 
since the locality given in the ' Cybele ' is, properly speaking, in 
Innishowen, and belongs to District 11, not District 12.
(To be continued).
SHORT NOTES.
APHYLLUM 
The station 
for this plant near Ludlow is in Herefordshire, not Shropshire.
It 
is not found in a new county as yet.
I know where the wood is 
situated, but do not mean to publish it.
There is sufficient reason 
for not doing so.
We expect the plant to be found some time in 
other damp woods in that district.

Phyllody of the bracteoles in (Enanthe ckocata.
— A root 
of this plant was found last August by Mr. E.
F. Cooper of this 
town, on the shore of Ennerdale Water, Cumberland, bearing 
flowers of a very abnormal appearance.
On examination I find 
the umbels small and about 12-rayed, the umbellules only about 
one-third of an inch in diameter; bracts few and small, but 
bracteoles abnormally developed, from one to three of those on 
each umbellule being half to one inch long, narrowly obovate, 
spiculate, slightly glaucous and reticulate below, in fact precisely 
similar to what the ultimate divisions of the normal leaves would 
be if they were separated to the base of the leaflet.
A few of these 
abnormal bracteoles are compound.

Carduus lanceolato-crispus in Bebks.
— By the roadside be- 
tween Marsham and Hilford I gathered, growing with typical 
lanceolatus, a thistle which was evidently a hybrid between that 
species and C.
crispus.
The anthodes, though smaller, were near 
those of lanceolatus; the spinous- tipped phyllaries were also very 
suggestive of lanceolatus, while the leaves in outline nearly re- 
sembled those of crispus, the armature in a few being, however, 
nearer lanceolatus.
The whole plant was very variable.

Report on the Progress and Condition of the Royal Gardens at Kew 
during the year 1881.
By Sir J.
D. Hooker, Director.
London: 
Clowes [Dec] 1882.
» 
As is always the case, the Kew Eeport contains a store of 
interesting and useful matter ; and we give the name of the pub- 
lisher in order that those who wish to learn more of its contents 
than our limited space will enable us to extract may know where to 
obtain the full text.
The resume of the progress of applied botany 
contained in its pages is, so far as we know, the only thing of its 
kind ; and although its practical usefulness may be a little lessened 
by the late date of its publication, it is still indispensable to the 
economic botanist.
A list of the exotic economic and medicinal 
plants cultivated under glass at Kew is appended ; this will be very 
useful to those who wish to know which of such "plants can be seen 
at Kew in a living state, and might well be reprinted for distribution 
or added to the Guide to the Gardens.
In this Journal for 1881 (p.
381) we referred to the publication 
of nomina mtda in the Kew Eeport for 1880, and expressed an 
opinion that such publication was " very reprehensible.' ' Dr. Trimen 
(Journ.
Bot., 1881, p.
239) demurred to this expression, stating 
that the names in question represented " the results of hard work 
at a troublesome set of plants M .
. .
. and that " no writer on the 
rubber-yielding species of Landolphia and Willughbeia could be 
justified in neglecting them." The Eeport now before us furnishes 
a curious comment upon this justification.
Two of the new rubber- 
yielding plants were named (but not described) in the 1880 Eeport 
as Chilocarpus jiavescens and Willughbeia Rtirbidgei.
We are now 
told (Kew Eeport for 1881, p.
48) that the former " appears to be 
a true Willughbeia, and will find its place in the Flora [of British 
India] as W.
Jiavescens ; w r hile the latter "turns out after com- 
parison with authentic sj^ecimens of IF.
Jirwa, Bl.
....
to be 
identical with that species." * If our contention that the 1880 names 
" have no claim to recognition or adoption by future workers " be 
allowed, the erroneous determinations may pass unnoticed ; but if 
Dr. Trimen's view be adopted, botanical nomenclature will be 
* The identifications here indicated are carried out in part ix.
of the 'Flora 
of British India/ which has c< me to hand since the above remarks were written.
But it is to be noted that while the former is cited as " W.
Burbidgei, Dyer in 
Kew Gard.
Rep. 1880, 44, 46," the latter is given as " Chilocarpvs Jlavescens.
Kew 
Gard.
Report, 1880, 47," no authority being appended to the specific name.
As 
we have before pointed out (Journ.
Bot. 1882, p.
280, foot-note) no indication of 
the dual authorship of the Kew Report for 1880 is to be found in its pages— a 
circumstance which further complicates the difficulty of quoting its nomina nuda 
as authoritative.
We note in passing that Sir Joseph Hooker, in the ' Flora/ 
Uniformly adopts a new spelling — Willovghbeia — for the genus in question.
28 ARTICLES IN JOURNALS.
burdened with at least two names which are at once useless and 
misleading.
But this is not all.
This 1881 Report is dated Jan. 1st, 1882.
But in June 15th of the same year Mr. Dyer read a paper before 
the Linnean Society in which he described Willughbeia Burbidgei as 
a new species.
Are we to conclude from this that Sir Joseph 
Hooker was wrong in reducing this plant to a synonym of W.
forma 1 Looking at the two dates we should naturally suppose this 
to be the case ; but the true explanation is we believe to be found 
in the fact that the Kew Report, though headed Jan. 1st, was not 
really written until late in the year.
It may be well to point 
out that the true time of publication of these Reports will be 
found on the last page, where, in the Report in question, we find 
12/82 
But surely these corrections and 
confusions are strong evidence that such publication of nomina nuda 
may fairly be called " very reprehensible.' '

Dr. George Dickie was bom at Aberdeen November 23rd, 
1813, and died there July 7tli, 1882.
He was educated in that 
town and graduated at Marischal College A.M., in 1830, and 
studied medicine during 1832-33, and in Edinburgh in 1833-31 ; 
in the latter year he became M.R.O.S. of London.
He lectured 
on Botany at King's College, Aberdeen, from 1839 to 1849, and 
delivered occasional courses on Materia Medica and Natural 
History in the same University, receiving from it in 1842 the 
degree of M.D. He was appointed, in 1849, Professor of Natural 
History in Belfast, and in 1860 Professor of Botany in Aberdeen, 
retaining that post until 1877, when the state of his health 
induced him to resign.
His separate works were the i Flora 
of Aberdeen' (1830), 'Botanist's Guide to Aberdeen and Banff' 
(1860), and ' Flora of Ulster ' (1864).
With Dr. McCosh he wrote 
'Typical Forms and Special Ends in Creation.' He was a 
constant contributor to various journals, our own among the 
number ; his earliest botanical paper, ' On the reproductive 
organs of Pilularia, and the globules of Char a vulgaris, ' appearing 
in Jardine's ' Magazine of Zoology and Botany/ in 1837 ; and 
latterly, having but few equals in his knowledge of Algse, he 
almost restricted his work to that group, his last published 
paper being one on Algae from the Himalayas, printed in the 
' Journal of the Linnean Society,' xix., 230 (June, 1881).
The 
list oi nis papers, ntty-iour m number, published in the lioyai 
Society's Catalogue, shows that his botanical knowledge had a 
wide range, embracing the structure and geographical distribution 
of phanerogams and mosses as well as Algae.
He was elected 
F.L.S. in 1863, and F.R.S. in 1881.
The death of Richard Parnell, M.D.
, took place at Edinburgh late 
in 1882.
He devoted himself especially to the studies of Ichthyology 
and Botany, contributing numerous papers on the former subject to 
the   Proceedings of the Royal Society of Edinburgh ' (1832-44), in 
which also appeared (vol.
i. pp.
367-9, t.
L), his paper upon a 
grass which he described and figured as " a new species of the 
genus Holcus " — H.
biararutatm—& plant which he subsequently 
(' Grasses of Scotland,' p.
51) reduced to a variety of 
distinguished by having " both [florets] furnished w 
dorsal awn." The work just mentioned is his most important 
contribution to Botany ; it contains figures drawn and engraved by 
himself, and elaborate descriptions of the species and varieties 
of Scottish grasses, prefaced by a list, with localities, of those 
found within fifteen miles of Edinburgh.
He appears to have paid 
H 
OBITUARY.
81 
special attention to the Graminea in various regions, for in his 
preface he speaks of " possessing an extensive collection of Grasses 
made by myself, not only throughout this island, but also in the 
West Indies and the southern parts of North America." In this 
work he proposes a genus, Bucetum, to include Festuca pratensis, 
F. elatior, and Browns gig aniens, and describes as new certain 
forms of Poa — P.
polynoda, P.
Montana, and P.
Balfouri, — the 
last of which is retained by Babington as distinct, but is placed 
by Nyman as a subspecies of P.
cmia.
The   Grasses of Scot- 
land ' was published in 1842 ; a second part was published in 
1845, and the two were then issued in one volume with the title 
1 The Grasses of Britain.' Professor Babington | who named in his 
honour Poa ParneUii (Eng. Bot.
t. 2916), speaks of this work as 
" an invaluable addition to our knowledge of grasses." In order 
vy v^ A 
that no doubt might exist as to the plants considered by him 
as types of his descriptions, Dr. Parnell deposited with the 
Linnean Society of London " specimens of the original grass 
plants employed in the description and figures throughout the 
entire work." Since that time he does not seem to have taken 
any active interest in science, and the news of his recent death 
at Edinburgh surprised most botanists, who had fancied that he 
had long since passed away.
George Gulliver, F.R.S., who died at Canterbury on the 17th 
of last November, was born at Banbury on the 4th of June, 1804.
In his earlier days he paid some att utimi to local British Botany: 
although it was not until 1841 that he published his   Catalogue 
of Plants collected in the neighbourhood of Banbury, ' the plants 
themselves (which were then in the possession of the Literary 
Society of Chatham) were, as he tells us in his preface, collected 
chiefly between the years 1818 and 1824.
The most noteworthy 
feature in the ' Catalogue ' is the large number of Cryptogams 
enumerated.
Mr. Gulliver, in his preface, speaks of having for 
many years taken " a final leave of botany ; " but about 1860 his 
old love returned, though in an altered form.
In the ' Annals 
of Natural History ' for that year he published a paper   On the 
marginal nerves of the leaves of Mosses ; ' and to the same 
Journal for 1861 he contributed the first of those papers on the 
crystals called Eaphides, in connection with which his name will 
chiefly be remembered, and to the existence of which bodies he was 
among the first to call attention.
Several papers from his pen appear 
in the earlier volumes of this Journal, among the most interesting 
being that in which he pointed out the difference in size between 
the pollen grains of Lotus conu'culatus and those of L.
major ( Joum.
Bot. 1866, 281-4).
About 1868 Mr. Gulliver took up his residence 
at Canterbury, and became secretary to the East Kent Natural 
History Society ; and it was here that he published (in 1880) his 
last botanical work, * Notes of Kesearches ...
in Botany.

John Sadler was born on the 3rd of February, 1837, at 
Gibbleston, Fifeshire.
In his early days he was associated with 
his father in gardening ; but in 1854 he was appointed assistant to 
Dr. Balfour, then professor of botany at Edinburgh, a position of 
32 BOTANICAL NEWS.
which he availed himself for increasing his knowledge of the 
subject.
In 1858 he was appointed Secretary to the Botanical 
Society of Edinburgh, which post he held until his appointment to 
the office of Curator to the Botanic Garden in 1879.
Mr. Sadler 
devoted a good deal of attention to the study of British Mosses ; 
he published numerous papers upon them, the first of which 
appeared in the   Transactions of the Botanical Society of Edin- 
burgh, ' in 1863, and made a collection of several hundred 
specimens, which was acquired for the National Herbarium at the 
British Museum in 1861.
Mr. Sadler assisted Professor Balfour 
in the preparation of the not very satisfactory ' Flora of Edinburgh,' 
published in 1863 ; and published in 1873 a list of the plants 
of the Isle of May, Firth of Forth (Trans.
Bot. Soc.
Edin.
xi., 
390-2).
He had a good knowledge of the localities of the rare 
Willow 
/ 
him Salix SaAleri (see Journ.
Bot. 1875, pp.
33-35, tt.
158, 159).
Mr. Sadler died at Edinburgh on December 9th, after a short 
illness ; a portrait of him will be found in the * Gardeners' 
Chronicle ' for January 18, 1879 (n.s., xi., 81).

NEW PASSIFLORE^.
By Maxwell T.
Masters, M.D., F.R.S.
The following note comprises a description of some previously 
undescribed Passiflorea, of which specimens are to be found in the 
herbaria at Kew and in the British Museum (Natural History) at 
South Kensington.
The new genus proposed {Mitostemma), together 
with Passiflora decipiem, P.platystyla, and P.ianthina, are noteworthy 
not only as additions to the order, but also on morphological 
grounds and from the point of view of geographical distribution.

This hitherto undescribed genus is chiefly remarkable for its 
peculiar corona, and the hypogynous stamens wholly separate 
from the gynophore.
The corona springs from the mouth of the 
very short flower-tube, and consists of a large number of separate 
thread-like thick processes arranged in a triple series ; the 
outermost are terete, acute, fleshy, reddish orange, somewhat 
shorter than the petals ; next to these is a series of lobes like 
those just described, but each has a membranous lacerate wing on 
either side, so that the thick fleshy thread is, as it were, a midrib 
between the tw r o membranous wings ; the third and innermost 
series consists of a number of oblong processes, wholly membranous, 
crisped, and lacerate at the edges.
There is no other corona, except 
this triple series at the throat of the tube.
The 8 or 10 stamens 
are hypogynous and more or less coherent at the base, surrounding,

but entirely free from, the gynophore.
Under ordinary circum- 
stances, in allied genera, the stamens are hypogynous and the 
ovary sessile in the early stages, but as development goes on the 
stipes of the ovary lengthens into the gynophore, and the stamens 
being undetached from it are upraised with it.
In the present 
case they are wholly free from the gynophore.
Thus this genus, 
so far as the arrangement of its stamens goes, presents a con- 
dition intermediate between that of Passiflora vntltiflora, in which 
the stamens are hypogynous and the ovary sessile, and that of 
most Passifloras wherein the ovary is raised on a long stalk to 
which the stamens are attached.

Very like the preceding, but differing from it in the thicker 
texture of the leaves, looser venation, smaller flowers, longer styles, 
and narrower ovary.
It is a singular circumstance that the only 
known representatives of an entirely new and distinct genus should 
have found their way into the herbarium about the same time and 
from two such widely separated districts as British Guiana and 
South Brazil respectively.
Probably others will hereafter be 
discovered in the intervening district.

A very interesting species, intermediate in some respects 
between tlie subgenera Astrophea and Granadilla.
Thus, while the 
habit, the form of the flower, the faucial corona, and the gynophore 
with a central node or dilatation, are those of § Astrophea, the deep 
tubular basilar corona encircling the gynophore is like that of 
§ Granadilla.
The median or membranous corona is entirely 
absent, a very rare circumstance.

It is remarkable that so distinct a species should not before 
have been recorded from so well-worked a district.
The head- 
quarters of the subgenus Astrophea are in the extreme north-western 
corner of South America, but a few are found in Brazil, among 
them P.

This last-named species is nearly allied to 
the present one, which, however, has larger flowers, with a more 
funnel-shaped tube, war ted in the interior, ecorniculate sepals, 
glabrous gynandrophore, and flat styles.

This is a remarkable species, belonging to that section of the 
subgenus Murucuia in which the membranous corona emerges 
from near the base of the tube.
In the form of the flower it is 
much like a true Tacsonia, but the filamentous faucial corona, 
occupying the upper third of the flower-tube, and the membranous 
corona springing upwards from the tube just above the dilated 
partion, serve to indicate its relations to the Murucuia group.

ON THE FLORA OF INNISHOWEN, CO.
DONEGAL.
By H.
C. Hart, B.A.
(Concluded from j>.
26.) 
Let us now consider the Flora of Innisliowen with regard to the 
different groups of species of which it is composed, as separated by 
Watson into " Types." The Highland or Alpine type is well 
represented, about half the total number of Irish species being 
found in Innisliowen.
Highland Type.
Draba incana.
VaccitUum Vitis-Idaa.
Silene acanlis.
Polygonum riviparum.
Sedum Rhodiola.
Salir herbacea.
Saxifraga o)> posit if olia.
Juniperus nana.
? S.
stellaris.
( 'a rex rigida.
Hieracium anglicum.
Isoetes lacustris.
H. crocatum.
Lycopodium alpinum.
Saussurea alpina.
L. selaginoides.
Arctostaphylos Uva-ursi.
Of the above, those in italics alone maintain a Highland 
character in Innisliowen, and of these Vaccinvum, SUetie, and Salix 
occur below 1000 feet.
The low vertical range of some alpine 
species in Ireland is very noteworthy, that of Salix herbacea espe- 
cially so.
The following belong to the 
Northern Type.
Drosera anglica.
Galeopsis versicolor.
Parnassia palustris.
Pinguicula vulgaris.
Sagina subulata.
Empetrum nigrum.
Primus Padus.
SaUx pentandra.
Rubus saxatilis.
Gymnadenia albida.
[Myrrhis odorata.] Listera cordata.
Ligusticum scoticum.
Blysmus rufus.
Crepis paludosa.
Carex dioica.
Antennaria dioica.
C. limosa.
Lobelia Dortmanna.
Elvmus arenarius.
Pyrola media.
Festuca sylvatica.
Mertensia maritima.
Equisetum umbrosum.
Lamium intermedium.
This is somewhat more than a third of the total list of Northern 
or Scottish species found in Ireland.
The above two sets of species 
show well the boreal tendency of the flora.
The Atlantic or Western type is poorly represented.
Species of 
this group decrease northwards ; thus in Scotland we find about 
half the number found in Ireland.
The development of this type 
is at its minimum in Donegal, and, strange to say, less than to the 
east, in Antrim, where the northern type is much better repre- 
sented also.
To this subject I will have occasion to return.
48 on the flora of innishowen, co.

Atlantic Type.
Kaphanus maritimus.
Bartsia viscosa.
Viola Curtisii.
Orobanche Hederaa.
Hypericum Androssemum.
Pinguicula lusitanica.
H. Elodes.
Euphorbia portlandica.
Sedum anglicum.
Scirpus Savii.
Cotyledon Umbilicus.
Lastrroa asmula.
• (Daucus maritimus.) Hymenophyllum Wilsoni.
Crithmum maritimmn.
This is less than a third of the total found in Ireland.
The 
flora of Innishowen contains a little above five hundred species.
Fifty-six of these belong, as we have seen, to Highland, Northern, 
and Western types ; of the remainder, about fifty belong to 
Watson's English type, and the remaining four hundred are the 
commoner or British species.
The following have not previously been recorded from the 
County Donegal, District 11, of the   Cybele Hibernica ' : — 
Draba incana.
— Sandy ground near the sea between Buncrana 
and Fahan.
Trifolium arvense.
— Sandy fields at Shroove, a little south of 
Innishowen Head, where it was first found by W.
E. Hart ; also at 
Ardmalin Sth., on the west side of Malin Head.
Fatbits cashes.- — Banks by the Foyle above Derry, Dr. Moore, Ord.

E. H.
Sium latifoliuw.
— The locality given under District 12 in the 
i Cybele Hibernica,' " Marsh near Culmore Point," belongs to 
District 11.
It is taken from the Ordnance Survey Nat. Hist.
Kept, of Derry, by Dr. Moore.
Filago minima.
— Sandy warren near Greencastle.
Discovered 
by W.
E. Hart, who sent me specimens from this locality, where it 
is accompanied by Filago germanica.
Hieracium crocatum.
— Steep banks above the sea near Glena- 
giveney.
ILaminm album.
— A weed at Kilderry, W.
E. H.
Ceratophyllum demersum Linn.
— In a marsh by the side of the 
Foyle above Derry, Dr. Moore.
This, like Stum, has been wrongly 
allotted to District 12 in the   Cybele Hibernica." 
Amongst the rarities which Innishowen can boast of, there is 
one, Bartsia viscosa, which deserves particular notice.
My friend 
Dean G-wyn first drew my attention to an unusual-looking yellow 
flower which he observed from the railway, and which proved to be 
this species.
I have already recorded its discovery in the pages of this 
Journal, and have endeavoured to outline its distribution.
This 
summer I have, however, devoted several days to a botanical 
survey of the district in which it grows, and I find that my views 
require modification.
The plant was not in flower when I believed 
I saw the young leaves upon Inch Island, and that part of the 
habitat is unfortunately erroneously stated.
i 
ON THE FLORA OF INNISHOWEN, CO.
DONEGAL.

From near the brick-kiln at Burnfoot, its eastern limit, the 
Bartsia extends across the fields and partly reclaimed swamps to 
the west of the second embankment (half a mile south of east 
Inch Eoad) which it just crosses ; a distance of a mile and two- 
thirds.
On the north it is bounded by the Lough Swilly Eailway, 
which it barely crosses a little north of Burnfoot Station, and along 
which it reaches for about a mile and a half west of Burnfoot.
To 
the southward it extends over fields to within half a mile of 
Carrownamaddy Meeting-House, and does not appear to cross 
westwards the main road to Inch from Carrownamaddy.
The 
whole area over which the plant extends is about a square mile, 
and all of this is land which formerly was below high-water mark.
Some of this land has never been broken up, and was left to 
Nature after it was reclaimed.
On this the Bartsia is not so 
plentiful ; on fields which have been cropped it is astonishingly 
abundant.
The crops have chiefly been flax and oats, and the 
land has been reclaimed above thirty years.
At one time I was 
inclined to the opinion that the plant might have been introduced 
with flax, but that seems unreasonable, since the flax-seed comes 
from Belgium or Biga, north, I believe, of the range of the plant, 
and if so introduced, or introduced with any crops, it would 
certainly have appeared as a colonist elsewhere.
Flax is a frequent 
crop in Donegal ; moreover, the seeds are too small, I think, to be 
likely to be introduced by any of the usual means by which 
colonists are transported, I have thought it possible that some of 
the numerous ducks, geese, or waders, which resort here in great 
numbers in the autumn months, may have touched at Dumbarton 
or in the Clyde estuary on their southerly migration, and trans- 
ported the capsule by means of its sticky adherent sepals.
This is 
only guesswork, but Darwin* and others attach importance to this 
very means of dispersal.
Leaving such suggestions, I am still of 
opinion that the plant grew in smaller quantities on the old coast - 
margin, or near it, and has spread far and wide over this so suitable 
an area.
Its not occurring now upon ground above the old coast- 
line is not necessarily important, since places formerly perhaps fit 
for it have now been much drained, altered, and cultivated, so as to 
drive the plant outwards to its newly-made home.
This has pro- 
bably been the case with Potamogeton pectinatus and Ruppia maritima, 
companions of the Bartsia.
It will seem strange that a con- 
spicuous flowering plant like the present species has not been 
recorded before now ; it may be thought that this is a proof of its 
recent appearance, but this part of Innishowen does not appear to 
have been visited by botanists, nor does it look interesting.
The 
plant, whatever its origin, does not seem to have spread within the 
last two years, as it might easily have done, but it is perhaps more 
plentiful where it grows.
It will, I think, be interesting, and throw some light on the 
question, if I describe the flora of this reclaimed land.
The soil is 
rich and yields good crops and pasturage, but is imperfectly drained

and intersected by deep stagnant dykes leading into main drains 
whose fall is quite insufficient to do more than partially carry off 
the surplus water.
The water of two small, but sometimes much 
flooded, streams, empties itself into this estuary, the one from low 
lands southwards towards Derry, the other from a valley running 
east towards Muff.
I examined the banks and marshy spots along 
these streams for a considerable distance inland, and was able to 
trace most of the estuary plants to their original habitat.
These 
are chiefly: in the drains Potamogeton pecthiatus, P.
pusiUus, Ruppia 
maritima, Myriophyllum alternijhrum, and Ranunculus heterophylliis ; 
and more sparingly, Utricularia vulgaris, Myrhplnjlliim spicUtum, 
and Zannichellia palustris.
On the sides of the ditches and else- 
where the chief plants of interest, besides Bartsia, are Ranunculus 
sceleratus, Scrophularia aquatica, CEnanthe crocata, Epilobium palustre, 
E. parvijlorum, Phalaris arundinacea, Fhruf/mites communis, Carex 
distans, C.
vulpina, and Equisetum maximum.
The number of 
species on this reclaimed land will be found to be small.
Coltsfoot 
and charlock have become pestilential weeds, as is also the common 
reed.
Several of the above, rare elsewhere in Donegal, are here 
unusually plentiful, but in most instances I found them in small 
quantities in the neighbourhood outside the margin of the reclaimed 
land in a swamp on the east side of the railway south of Bridge 
End. This is a limited area, and a very trifling amount of drainage 
would confine the range for a wide area of some of the above to 
the same grounds as the Bartsia.
There is a similarly reclaimed estuary, upon a smaller scale, 
a couple of miles south of Inch Island along the same shore of 
Lough Swilly, called Blanket Nook, which I searched for Bartsia 
without success, and I am convinced the plant is confined to the 
area described.
I may add that I have made fruitless enquiries of all persons in 
the neighbourhood that seemed likely to be able to give any 
information upon the subject.
I have sought the opinion of other 
botanists and adopted various suggestions in search of a clue, but 
the problem is still free to speculate upon.
One is tempted to 
wonder, can this be an extraordinary instance of the well-attested 
and marvellous power possessed by many seeds of remaining inert 
until exposed to the influence of sunlight, and that instead of 
a recently introduced species we have recorded an old inhabitant of 
a recently submerged flat ?
Bartsia riscusa belongs to a group 
which probably flourished at a very recent period north of its 
present limit along the European coasts.
In the foregoing remarks I have expressed my belief that 
Bartsia is native in Donegal ; and I am able to show that, 
though so very local in Ireland, it is one which we should 
not be surprised to meet in Donegal.
It is one of those south 
and south-west European species which extend up the west coast 
of Great Britain, failing in numbers as they travel northwards, 
until a few only have found a home in Scotland.
These are 
classed together by Watson in his Atlantic or Western type, and 
the group is well represented in most of the maritime counties

of Ireland.
Considering the extent of coast-line and the mild- 
ness of the Donegal climate, it is remarkable that this type is 
here at its weakest in Ireland.
I expect, however, that further 
exploration in the west and south-west of the county will strengthen 
the list.
Most of the "Atlantic" plants which reach Scotland 
occur throughout Ireland, Sinapis monensis alone being entirely 
absent.
Of those in Scotland some are widespread, several get no 
further north than the Clyde Estuary (District XII.
of Watson's 
1 Cybele Britannica'), while two have a further range to Dumbarton 
and its proximity (District XVI., Watson).
These two are Carum 
verticillatum and Bart&ia viscosa, and all these more northern 
"Atlantic" plants in Scotland, excepting Bartsia, have also been 
found in the extreme north of Ireland.
The range of Carum 
affords a strikingly parallel case.
It is commonly found associated 
with Bartsia in Kerry and Cork, the latter being the more abundant 
there, though not previously found elsewhere in Ireland.
On the 
western side of Great Britain, from Cornwall and Devon to 
Dumbarton, to which they are strictly confined, their range is local 
and similar.
But Carum is found in the north of Ireland, about 
twenty miles east of Burnfoot in the estuary of the Bann, and 
again near Belfast, but nowhere else in Ireland.
So that the 
occurrence of Bartsia might have been reasonably predicted in the 
north or north-east of Ireland ; and, having been found, the 
parallelism is complete.

Ranunculus ophioglossifolius in England.
— In the summer of 
1878 I collected near Hythe, South Hants, a specimen of what, at 
a glance, I took to be a very broad-leaved form of R.
Flammula, 
and, in consequence of the large number of other plants then 
gathered, it was dried and sorted away, as such, without further 
examination.
A short time ago I came across the specimen, and 
then found it to be R.
opkioglo&sifblius* It differs, however, from 
the continental plant by its less strongly tubercled carpels.
The 
distribution of this species, as given in Nyman's * Conspectus,' 
shows it to be a likely plant to occur in Britain, as it reaches north 
to Gotland, and is found throughout France (including the Channel 
Islands) ; it also extends over the greater part of Southern Europe.
The out-of-the-way place in which the plant grows in Hampshire 
makes it improbable that it was introduced, although it did not 
occur in great quantity, and was only noticed over a small area.
Of course the occurrence of a plant in Jersey gives it no claim to 
be considered "British"; and I think it is to be regretted that our 
Flora should be artificially enlarged by the addition of species only 
occurring in what is geographically and botanically a part of France.

Babington 
for examination a suite of specimens of Rubi collected by Mr. S.
A. 
Stewart and myself in the north-eastern counties of Ireland, which 
constitute district 12 of the ' Cybele Hibernica.' The results of his 
investigation proved of extreme interest, yielding at least six species 
hitherto unrecorded from any part of Ireland.
These were : — Rubus

Dasya venusta in Britain.
— About the end of August last year 
I found on the beach at Bournemouth three or four plants of a 
species of Dasya.
My friend Mr. E.
M. Holmes, to whom I for- 
warded the same, pronounces them to be Dasya venusta, and this 
opinion is corroborated by Mrs. Merrifield ; so that I think there 
can be no doubt about the correctness of the name.
Mr. Grattan 
mentions in his ' British Marine Algae' that this plant is occasion- 
ally cast ashore on the coast of Sussex, and Mr. Holmes informs 
me that he finds in Mrs. J.
E. Gray's herbarium in the Cambridge 
Museum specimens of the same plant, gathered at Swanage and 
Studland in August, 1861.
I think therefore that we may now 
fairly claim the plant as a British species.
Mr. Grattan says it is

Bournemouth is at times a very good place for 
Algae.
Last summer I found on the beach between Muddiford and 
Poole fine specimens of Halymenia Ligida, Sporochmis pedunculatus, 
Arthrocladia villosa, and Champia parvula ; also Paonia atomaria, 
Bonnemaisomiia asparayoides, Callithamnion roseiim, Cutleria multifida , 
&c.
; the most common of all was Corynospora pedicellata, of large 
size.
I have said Bournemouth is at times a good place for Algae, 
because days and days pass without anything worth speaking of 
being cast up.

— In reference to Prof.
Babington's 
note on the habitat of this plant in a certain wood near Ludlow, 
permit me to say that the wood lies on both sides the boundary-line 
between Shropshire and Herefordshire, there being a very con- 
siderable portion on the Shropshire side ; and as the lady who 
gathered the plant does not know in what part of the wood she 
gathered it, I fear there will be a prolonged contention between 
local botanists as to which county shall claim it.

reasons, otherwise it would not be difficult to show that the pro-

Principal additions.
— Under this head three gifts of great 
interest and value require prominent mention : — 1.
The collection 
of dried fungi belonging to the late Frederick Currey, M.A., 
F.R.S., Treasurer of the Linnean Society, presented by his 
executors in accordance with his wish.
This collection, although 
not very large, is of great value, as it contains the types of many 
species described by Mr. Currey.
2. The European herbarium of 
the late George Curling Joad, F.L.S., of Oakfield, Wimbledon 
Park, presented by his widow in accordance with his wish.
The 
herbarium consisted of two parts, 1, the personal herbarium of 
Mr. Joad, consisting of plants collected by himself for the most 
part in Southern and Central Europe ; 2, a general European 
herbarium, formed of published sets of dried plants.
3. The 
British herbarium of the late H.
C. Watson, of Thames Ditton, 
presented by J.
G. Baker, Esq., F.R.S. This herbarium, which 
will always have a classical interest to students of British botany,

also presented to Kew a selection from Mr. Watson's books and the 
beautifully kept manuscript collections for his various published 
works, which have since been carefully bound for the library.

THE ROYAL BOTANICAL GARDEN, GLASNEVIN, DUBLIN.
The   Twenty-ninth Keport of the Science and Art Department 
of the Committee of Council on Education,' dated 3rd July, 1882, 
has lately come into our hands.
We find in it a report of the con- 
dition of the Botanic Garden, Glasnevin, Dublin, which in some 
respects is very unsatisfactory.
The Garden itself, as every 
one who has visited it knows, is maintained in a high state of 
efficiency by the energetic Curator, Mr. F.
W. Moore ; but the fol- 
lowing statement by Dr. W.
R. McNab, the Professor of Botany at the 
Royal College of Science, will show that there are matters connected 
with the Gardens which require immediate attention.
Dr. McNab 
write : — " The want of a proper library, herbarium, museum, and 
offices, was prominently brought before the Visitors at their visita- 
tion on the 11th of March, 1881.
A new building to replace the 
present offices and temporary museum is required for the accommo- 
56 NOTICES OF BOOKS.
dation, first, of a reference herbarium; second, a museum of such 
parts of plants as cannot be prserved in the herbarium ; third, a 
reference library ; and fourth, suitable offices.
At present the 
herbarium is kept in the office.
The plants are merely tied up in 
bundles, are very difficult of access, and liable to injury from damp, 
dust, and other causes.
As a step towards the formation of a 
proper herbarium, cases ought to be provided for the collection 
without delay.
Part of the collection which should properly be at 
the garden is at present stored in the Museum of Science and Art, 
and I think that steps should be taken to render the late Admiral 
Jones's collection of lichens accessible to the student." Dr. McNab 
calls attention to the deficiencies of the library, instancing as 
examples of books required the recent volumes of the ' Botanical 
Magazine,' which is complete down to 1878, the   Flora Aus- 
traliensis,' the * Flora of British India/ and the ' Journal of the 
Linnean Society,' Such a state of affairs is hardly creditable to 
the chief botanical establishment in Ireland.
He concludes his 
statement with this sentence: — "Botanical science is but little 
appreciated in Ireland, and it is only by having a properly equipped 
botanical establishment that any impetus will be given to the 
study of the subject." 
Mr. Moore bears out this melancholy testimony to the existing 
state of things : — " The plants," he says, "are tied in bundles, and 
put where room can be found for them.
The place is so damp 
that many valuable plants were completely lost during the year, 
and they must continue to deteriorate unless suitable cases be 
provided for them." 
We learn from Mr. Moore that the Herbarium contains, among 
other collections, a large series of Irish Phanerogams and Ferns, 
formed by the late Dr. Moore, and of especial value in connection 
with the ' Cybele Hibernica ' ; a full collection of Irish Musci and 
Hepaticse, mounted and arranged — the latter prepared for micro- 
scopical examination ; collections of Irish Lichens and Mosses, 
formed by Dr. Taylor and Admiral Jones ; European Hepatic® and 
Mosses, from Lindley, Hepp, Rabenhorst, Wilson, and Gr. E.
Hunt ; 
and other plants from various parts of Europe.
We trust that 
something may be done, and that without delay, to save the 
collections from the ruin which seems impending.

its appearance any remarks which suggest themselves.
But we 
may say briefly that M.
DeCandolle has here worked out the 
history, ancient and modern, so far as it can be ascertained, of all 
cultivated plants of importance, amounting in number to nearly 
250.
Every page bristles with interesting facts and details 
bearing upon the subject ; and the number and variety of the 
authorities cited show that the learned author has left no source 
of information unexplored.
The following enumeration of the 
species which are unknown, or but doubtfully known, in a wild 
state, will, we think, be of interest to our readers, showing, as it 
does, the various degrees of uncertainty attaching to the various 
groups.
A hundred and sixty-nine out of the 247 species enume- 
rated are placed by M.
DeCandolle in his first group, which he 
defines as consisting of " Spontaneous, that is to say wild species, 
seen by numerous botanists far from houses and cultivation, 
having all the appearance of indigenous plants, and under a form 
identical with one of the varieties cultivated.
These number 
169 : 31 of them are of very ancient cultivation ; 56 have been 
cultivated less than 2000 years, and the others are of mediaeval or 
unknown date/' The remaining 78 species are grouped as 
follows : 
II.
Seen and collected in the same conditions, but by only one 
botanist and in only one locality — 3.
Gucurbita maxima, Faba vulgaris^ Nicotiana Tabacum.
III.
Seen and mentioned, but not collected, in the same 
conditions, by one or two more or less ancient non-botanical 
authors, who may have been mistaken — 2.
Carthamits tinctorius, Triticum rulgare.
IV.
Collected wild by botanists in several localities, under a 
form slightly differing from those cultivated, but which most 
authors would not hesitate to rank as the same species — 4.
Olea europaa, Oryza sativa, Solanum tuberosum, Vitis vinifera.
V. Wild, collected by botanists in several localities, under 
forms considered by the authors as constituting different species, 
although others treat them as varieties — 15.
Allium Ampeloprasum Porrum, *Cichorium Endivia var.
Crocus sativus var., *Cucumis Melo, Cucurbita Pepo,

Subspontaneous, that is to say, almost wild, resembling 
one of the forms cultivated, but with the possibility that they may 
have escaped from cultivation, owing to local causes — 24.

The Botanical Exchange Club of the British Isles.
Notes on the plants 
gathered iu 1881.
Edited by F.
Arnold Lees, M.R.C.S., 
L.R.C.P., F.L.S. Manchester: James Collins [Dec] 1882.
The 1881 report is distinctly wanting in the interest which 
usually attaches to the issues of the Exchange Club.
There is an 
almost entire absence of the critical notes by more or less com- 
petent observers which have hitherto rendered the Reports valuable

to critical botanists, and which we have from year to year trans- 
ferred to our columns.
On this occasion we find little which we can 
profitably extract, although the notes on the specimens distributed 
will be of interest to those who possess the plants to which they 
refer* Mr. Varenne sends examples of Bramea Briggm from 
Penzance (see Journ.
Bot., 1881, p.
360) ; Dr. Boswell notes that 
I tubus spectabilis, recorded by Mr. Melvill as occurring in Kent 
(Journ.
Bot., 1881, p.
251), is M naturalised in many places in 
Arran" ; the hybrid thistle (C(irduus pal tutrix xheterophyllus), which 
Mr. Jenner called C.
Carolorum, has been cultivated at Balm u to y a 
single specimen having been brought from Glen Garry ; Mr. Purchas 
reports Daphne Mezereim " amongst bushes on a steep, stony hill- 
side, apparently truly wild, near Alstonfield, Stafford." Of an 
Alopecums sent by Mr. E.
P. Linton from " Bottesford to Belvoir 
Castle, Leicester, Mr. Lees says " I have examined it carefully, and 
from its size (4 ft.), villose-ciliate united glume, long awn, and 
creeping runners, I call it nigricans, Hornem." Mr. Leefe says of 
a Willow sent by Dr. Fraser from Tattenhall, Wolverhampton, " 1 
consider your plant to be Sa/Lv holosericea Willd., not Hook.
I 
never saw a British specimen before " ; and Dr. Boswell confirms 
this identification.
We are sorry to see that Mr. Lees adds a new 
synonym to the interesting sedge figured and described by Mr.
Ridley (Journ.
Bot. 1881, p.
97, tab.
218) as Carew pilulifera, var.
Leesii.
Mr. Lees now calls this plant " C.
pilulifera, var.
ecu-umbra 
Lees (1880)." This is erroneous ; Mr. Lees published the plant, 
not as a variety, but as a species, with the specific name Saxumbra.
If retained as a species, that name must of course stand, although 
Mr. Lees himself has since quoted it has " C.
Leesii Ridley " (see 
Journ.
Bot. 1882, p.
93) ; but if the plant is a variety of pilulifera, 
there is no possibility of setting Mr. Ridley's name aside.
Dr.
Boswell notes upon the specimens sent (from the original locality 
at Plumpton) to the Club — " Certainly a most remarkable form ; 
the glumes are so totally unlike those of ordinary jnlulifera.
It 
is desirable the plants should be cultivated to see if it be not 
distinct." 
The Colours of Flowers as illustrated in the British Flora.
By Grant 
Allen.
London : Macmillan.
1882.
This is a very readable little volume, the contents of which 
have already appeared in * Nature,' and are now reprinted in the 
1 Nature Series.' The opening chapter is devoted to the statement 
of a theory that petals are derived from flattened and abortive 
stamens.
Mr. Allen puts this view before us with much plausibility; 
but we do not think botanists will be convinced that the generally 
accepted theory has been disproved.
The bulk of the little volume 
is occupied with a very interesting analysis of the colours of our 
British flowering plants.
Mr. Allen considers that "all flowers 
were in their earliest form yellow; then some of them became 
white ; after that, a few of them grew to be red or purple ; and 
finally, a comparatively small number acquired various shades of 
60 NOTICES OF BOOKS.
lilac, mauve, violet, or blue": these last being the most highly 
developed.
It is unnecessary to say that Mr. Allen tells his story 
in an attractive manner ; and his conclusions follow naturally 
enough if we accept the premises upon which they are based.
But 
Mr. Allen's notions of the colour of many flowers seems to us far 
from accurate.
We do not agree with him in thinking that the 
petals of the cherry are " usually deeply tinged with pink" (p.
30) ; 
we should not call the flowers of Lobelia Ihrtmanna u sky blue" or 
those of L.
urem " dingy purple'' (p.
48) ; it is not the " throat," 
but the upper lip, of T Anuria spuria, that is " purple " (p.
68) ; the 
flowers of Hesperis matronal in are not " a fine purple M (p.
44) ; the 
red of the apple-blossom is more than a "slight blush" (p.
75).
These are small matters, and would be of no importance did not 
Mr. Allen base theories upon them.
Thus he says, " Sometimes 
we may say that the new colour has not yet begun to fix itself in 
the species, but that the hue still varies under our very eye.
Of 
this the little milkwort {Pohjgala vulgaris) affords an excellent 
example, for it is occasionally white, usually pink, and frequently 
blue.
Here we may fairly regard the pink as the normal hue, 
while the white is doubtless due to reversion, and the blue to 
progressive modification, not yet fully selected by insects ; so that 
in all probability it is now actually in course of acquiring a new 
colour " (p.
74).
We think it would be generally admitted that the 
milkwort is more frequently blue than any other colour.
Mr. Allen 
andiji 
of 
Aceras anthropophora as having "green sepals and petals, edged 
with red, and a yellow lip, pink fringed" (p.
70), would convey to 
any one who did not* know the plant a by no means accurate 
impression.
He tells us that "floating plants tend as a rule to 
become green - flowered " (p.
102); but this rule is 
sur 
an 
account such floating plants as the water-lilies, Hydrocharis, 
Limnanthemum, Polygonum ampbibimn, Hottonia.
Alisma natans, 
Batrachium, and Utricularia.
Allen 
little prone to bend facts so as to fit them in with his own theories.
He miglit well take a lesson from Mr. Darwin in this matter ; and 
his conclusions will be more valuable if they are based on a larger 
amount of observation.
A Handbook of Cinchona Culture.
By Karel Wesel von Gorkom, 
formerly Chief Inspector of Cultures in the Netherlands East 
Indies.
Translated by Benjamin Daydon Jackson, Secretary 
of the Linnean Society of London.
Amsterdam: Bussy.
London : Triibner.
1883 [1882] .

The indefatigable Secretary of the Linnean Society lias found 
time, in spite of his numerous duties, to translate this important 
book from the original Dutch.
The title, although correct so far as 
it goes, hardly gives a fair idea of the w r ork, which deals not only 
with the culture of Cinchona, but includes its early history, 
NOTICES OF BOOKS.
61 
descriptions of the various species, an account of the introduction 
of Cinchona into Java, the preparation of Quinine, and kindred 
subjects ; as well as — last, but certainly not least in importance — a 
capital index, for which the translator is, we believe, to be thanked.
It will thus be seen that, although the work is thus primarily 
intended for the use of those engaged in the cultivation of Cinchona, 
it yet deserves also to find a place on the shelves of the student of 
applied botany.
It is a little disappointing to find the author saying, " We do 
not attempt a bibliography of the subject Cinchona": these 
bibliographies of special subjects are very useful, and we should 
have been glad if Mr. Jackson had seen his way to give something 
of the kind in an appendix, for which his 'Vegetable Technology' 
would have afforded material sufficient for a basis.
Only three 
works are recommended for consultation — a selection which seems 
to us very insufficient.
Cinchona Ledgeriana, which has been 
the subject of two papers in this Journal, is treated as a 
form of C.
Calisaya ; Mr. Jackson in a footnote refers to Dr.
Trimen's description of the plant as a species — showing that 
the translator does not confine himself to the information given by 
Van Gorkom.
The volume is beautifully got up, and the typographical errors 
are very few, considering that the work was printed abroad.
Appealing to but a small circle, it is not to be wondered at that the 
work is expensive ; but its general style leaves little doubt in the 
mind that those who take an active interest in Cinchona culture 
will find this ' Handbook ' indispensable.
We have received a copy of the new edition of Dr. Smiles's 
1 Life of a Scotch Naturalist, Thomas Edward, A.L.S.' (London : 
Murray, 1882), from which the ' Fauna of Banffshire ' is omitted ; 
the general reader, however, is more than compensated for the 
absence of this by the addition of a new preface, containing much 
interesting matter, especially portions of an admirable address 
lately delivered by Mr. Edward to the boys of a school near 
Liverpool.
Mr. Edward's botanical collection came to an untimely 
end.
In 1845, when " he went to overhaul the box " which con- 
tained about two thousand specimens — the result of eight years' 
labour — u he found that the lid had been shoved to one side, and 
that numerous cats had entered it and made it their lair : the 
plants were completely soaked and rendered utterly worthless." 
Although he replaced them M to a certain extent," he does not 
seem to have devoted special attention to botany after this.
Not 
the least remarkable circumstance connected with this most 
interesting volume is the fact that no fewer than four translations 
of it have appeared in Eussia.
The book abounds with anecdote 
and suggestion, and should be in every good library.
We notice 
in a recent (December) newspaper the announcement that Mr.
Edward has resigned the Curatorship of the Banff Museum, which 
he had held for thirty years.

62 NOTICES OF BOOKS.
The English Dialect Society has issued to its members a 
reprint of the very interesting ' Glossary of Devonshire Plant- 
Names,' contributed by the Eev. Hilderic Friend to the volume for 
1882 of the ' Transactions of the Devonshire Association/ It 
contains, as might be expected, many additions to Britten and 
Holland's ' Dictionary of English Plant-Names,' issued by the same 
Society, and is very carefully done.
Mr. Friend quotes from a local 
book a sentence — "The * thorrnantle,' excellent as a medicine in 
fevers," — and says, " it would be interesting to know exactly what 
flower is meant." There is little doubt but that the Tormentil 
(Potentilla Tormentilla) is intended, and Mr. Friend's idea that the 
name has some allusion to Thor must, we fear, be abandoned.
The last part (Vol. III., part 3) of the ' Transactions of the 
Norfolk and Norwich Naturalist's Society ' contains a memoir, with 
portrait, of Samuel Pickworth Woodward, by his son, Mr. Horace 
B. Woodward, Although chiefly known by his' 'History of 
Mollusca,' Mr. S.
P. Woodward, especially in early life, paid some 
attention to botany.
When about fifteen, he was employed by 
Dawson Turner in the arrangement of his herbarium, and he 
subsequently "formed a large and valuable herbarium himself, 
which was ultimately purchased for the Royal Agricultural College 
at Cirencester." His name is associated with the doubtful thistle 
called by Mr. Watson (Cyb. Brit., ii., 83), provisionally, Cardui 
Woodwardii ; this was found by Mr. Woodward, near Swindon, in 
1848.
He was born at Norwich, on Sept.
17th, 1821, and died at 
Heme Bay, July 11th, 1865.
Other papers of botanical interest 
are, ' The Lombardy Poplar and its destruction in Norfolk in the 
winter of 1880 ' : by Herbert D.
Geldart ; and   Lists of Norfolk 
Naiadaceae and Characeae,' by Arthur Bennett, F.L.S. The local 
character of these Transactions is a very satisfactory feature.

TWO NEW POTAMOGETONS.
By Arthur Bennett, F.L.S.
(Tab. 235.) 
Potamogeton Griffithii, n, sp.— Stem branched, 2-3 ft.
long.
Lower leaves alternate, sessile, slightly clasping, strap-shaped, 
hooded at the apex when fresh, entire, slightly undulated, 11 -veined, 
with 4-5 fainter veins close to the midrib, semitranslucent.
Upper 
(floating) leaves opposite, long-stalked, oblanceolate, gradually 
attenuated into the long petiole, 13-17 veined with distinct 
areolation over the whole surface, more conspicuous towards the 
midrib.
Stipules long, narrow, blunt.
Peduncles moderately 
slender, distinctly narrowed towards the base of the spike, slightly 
enlarged towards the centre.
Spike cylindrical, densely flowered.
Sepals roundish -oval, broader than long.
Young fruit oval, with 
the beak forming the continuation of the inner edge.
Bipe 
fruit not seen.
Submerged leaves tinged with yellowish brown, 
floating leaves green.
Lower leaves 7-12 in.
long, £-f in.

long, petiole 2-4 in.

Stipules 2 in.

Peduncles 2-|-5 in.

Spike ^-1

The plant lias the habit of P.
prmlongits Wulfen.
The floating 
leaves much resemble those of the N.
American P.
Claytonii Tuck.
; 
the submerged, those of P.
longifolins Bab.
(not of Gay !), but the apex 
of the leaves in P.
Grijfithii is decidedly boat-shaped, although not so 
much so as represented in the plate.
I examined most of the broad- 
leaved Potamogetons in a fresh state last autumn, to see if there was 
any tendency to this boat- shaped apex of the leaf, but cannot find it 
in any except pmlongns and (rriffithii.
There does not seem to be 
any approach to floating leaves in P.
pralongW among the numerous 
specimens I have examined from N.
America and Europe ; the 
nervation of the leaves and spikes of Griffithii is also totally 
different.

When Mr. Griffith sent me the first specimens I was strongly 
inclined to refer them to P.
longifolins Bab.
; but on his visiting the 
locality (which is somewhat difficult of access/ twice afterwards, 
and kindly sending me a supply of specimens in the fresh state 
and with floating leaves, I saw it could not be so referred.
Later 
I thought it might possibly be a hybrid between pmlo?igus and 
nifescem, though I am a decided opponent of referring every 
uncertain plant to a hybrid origin ; but Mr. Griffith especially

searched for either of these species without success, and he informs 
me that the water is so clear that by ascending the mountain side 
you can see the bottom of the lake and its vegetation plainly.
It is difficult to believe in a plant being wholly confined to a 
o e Welsh lake, and the alteration that may take place by 
isolation should be well considered, especially after the evidence 
Mr. F.
Day has brought together from the zoological point, i.

among the British Salmomda.
Still it is impossible to refer 
Mr. Griffith's specimens to any known species of Potamogeton, and 
equally so to place it under any species as a sub-species.
Potamogeton Cheesemanii, n.sp.
— Stem simple (?), striated, 
internodes strongly marked by an irregular annulus.
Lower leaves 
alternate, strap-shaped, gradually attenuated into the petiole, less 
so at the apex, not denticulate, 5-7 veined, connected with few 
cross veins, semitranslucent ; upper leaves (opposite where the 
peduncles are given off) varying from lanceolate to oval, the upper- 
most coriaceous, 11-15 veined, with very numerous cross veins, 
and close areolation all over the leaf when held against the light.
Stipules broad, subacute, very translucent, and soon decaying.
Peduncles rather slender, slightly thickened towards the middle ; 
spikes dense flowered, oblong-cylindrical, sepals (perianth leaves)

Morong (to whom I sent a scrap and a sketch

suggesting whether it " might not be regarded as a young autumnal

ON SPRMEELLA AND ITS ALLIES.
By M.
C. Cooke, M.A., LL.D.
The genus Spharella, as originally proposed and accepted, was 
a tolerably natural one, including such species of the old genus 
Spharia as grew upon leaves, or the green and succulent parts 
of plants, the perithecia being small, more or less membranaceous, 
with oblong or elliptical sporidia of two to four cells, sometimes 
only one, hyaline or slightly coloured.
These were, in fact, the 
limits proposed by De Notaris, and no very strong objection could 
be urged against them.
But Saccardo was not content, and in his 
recent 'Sylloge' he has split it up over five or six genera, in 
conformity with his monomaniapal idea.
Nevertheless, we purpose to attend more to his species than to his 
genera in the following remarks, and shall on this occasion apply 
ourselves principally to two, that is, Lastadia, or species of Sphar- 
ella with simple spores, and SpJuerella, inclnding the species with 
bilocular spores; the species with a larger number of cells must 
wait a future opportunity, when the second volume of the   Sylloge ' 
is published.
We purpose regarding all as Spharella, according to 
Notaris, grouping them in subgenera under the names adopted by 
Saccardo, thus : — 
Sphjerella, DeNot.
One-celled = subgen.
Lastadia 
Two-celled = „ Spharella 
Three-celled= ,, Sphartdina.
and so on.
This will permit of the combination of all that is good 
and practicable of the artificial system with the natural.
The two first-named subgenera include in the Sylloge 
Lastadia ....
59 species 
Sphcerella ....

>> 
As to the soundness of basing generic distinctions on the 
sporidia, we will only remind its adherents of one fact, well known 
to all who have had botanical experience, especially with the 
68 ON SPH^ERELLA AND ITS ALLIES.
cryptogamia, that the natural tendency of the vegetable cell is that 
of undergoing septation.
The spore is a vegetable cell, inheriting 
a natural tendency towards subdivision.
How far then can it 
possibly be philosophical to adopt such an unstable element as a 
vegetable cell as the fundamental base of a system of classification ?
Of the 337 species in the ' Sylloge,' about 100 are unknown to us ; 
of these, 50 at least belong to very recent Italian species, of which 
nothing is known in other parts of Europe, except the names and 
descriptions, specimens never having been published or distributed.
Some of the remaining 50 are species long ago described, perhaps 
imperfectly, but which cannot be regarded as other than doubtful.
Our remarks on the species are made in the order in which they 
are published in the ' Sylloge,' with the intercalated species denoted 
i « 1 ' *   ^ -* *.****« + mm + m 
by an asterisk.
We 
except casually, where we have recognized a species in our opinion 
misplaced.
Hence we hazard no opinion concerning the species 
included under them, or whether any belong properly to SphareUa.

Evidently Saccardo regards this as Microthyrium microscopicvm

the specimens published by Desmazieres, and we have collected 
and examined the same in the fresh state.

peltate superficial perithecia.
A section of the leaf may he cut 
with a little care, showing the perithecia imbedded in the leaf.
Moreover, we have detected no septum in the sporidia.
The 
radiating asci in Microthyrlinn is an arrangement not met with in 
the Sphcerella.
Hence it is evidently a too hasty assumption that 
the Spharia Buxi of Desmazieres is Microthyrium.
In fact, if the 
cuticle be stripped from the leaf and submitted to the microscope 
this will be proved.

This we regarded hitherto as a variety of Sphceria Biui, but 
further observation disproves this.
The perithecia are more pro- 
minent, usually two to four together, of a darker colour, nearly 
black, and the sporidia twice as long, and probably would be 
uniseptate when fully matured.

ON THE FLORA OF SOUTH BEDFORDSHIRE.
By James Saunders.
About eighty years have elapsed since Abbot's * Flora Bed- 
fordiensis ' was issued, during which time many changes have been 
effected in the county, both by drainage and agricultural ope- 
rations.
Hence it may be surmised that some interesting plants 
have been exterminated, and a few agrarian weeds introduced, in 
addition to which others have been discovered which were then 
unrecorded.
Nor is it a matter for surprise that there are several 
new county records, since the 'Flora' referred to is essentially that 
of the Bedford district, and the middle of the county generally.
Facilities for locomotion were in those days very limited, hence the 
u stations M recorded for the extreme south are very few.
It is proposed in the following list, as in Abbot's 'Flora,' that, 
with the exception of possibly a few ubiquitous forms, having a 
very high comital census, every record should be based on a 
voucher specimen, so that in case of doubt reference may be made 
to it.
This will possibly exclude some species that have been 
noticed, but of which specimens have not been preserved ; it is, 
however, the plan which most commends itself to one's judgment.
72 ON THE FLORA OF SOUTH BEDFORDSHIRE.
The district implied in the term " South Beds" includes the 
whole of the cretaceous strata, from the upper "chalk- with- flints," 
and its overlying drift in the extreme south, to the lower green 
sand at Ampthill, and near Leighton.
Within this area the 
lithological characters of the strata differ greatly, those of the 
upper beds being calcareous, of the middle chiefly ax'gillaceous, and 
of the lowest or most northern entirely arenaceous, strongly 
impregnated with iron.
Such plants as are characteristic of any 
of these zones, will be noted in their places.
Within the district 
the watershed formed by the Chiltern Hills occurs, and it is also 
characterized by the absence of any large river.
The highest 
elevation is a little over eight hundred feet above the sea level, so 
that the whole of the area may be regarded as " lowland." 
The list, as a whole, will give a fair idea of the plants that are 
associated with the cretaceous formation as it occurs in England, 
uninfluenced either by littoral or lacustrine conditions, with the 
trifling exception of the small " lake 1 ' in Luton Hoo Park.
The specimens have all been gathered since 1878.

(Continued from p.

Innishowen is well situated for studying the distribution of 
plants in the extreme north of Ireland.
With this object in view 
I shall enumerate those species which increase westwards, con- 
trasting them with those which become scarcer.
Characteristic or 
76 ON THE FLORA OF INNISHOWEN, CO.
DONEGAL, 
tolerably frequent species only are taken into account.
The 
district of Fanet, which is frequently mentioned, lies west of 
Lough Swilly, between it and Mulroy.
In latitude it lies imme- 
diately south of Malin, to which it is quite similar in physical 
features.
With its botany I am especially familiar, and an account 
of it has been already given in this Journal.
The following species 
belong to Watson's English type : 
those 
Nymphaa alba.
— More frequent in Fanet and westwards.
Drosera anglica.
— Abundant from Kilmacrennan to Gweedore, 
and in the Bosses.
Radiola Millegrana.
— Much commoner in Fanet, and westwards 
in many places.
Sedum Rhodiola.
— Increases westwards steadily, attaining a 
maximum iu Aranmore.
Saxifraga stellar is.
— Very scarce in Innishowen, but quite frequent 
about Muckish, Errigal, &c.
S. umbrosa.
— Malin is the eastern limit in Ireland of this plant; 
common on Errigal, Muckish, Slieve Snacht West, and in the West 
of Ireland generally.
Eryngium maritimum.
— Commoner in Fanet.
Crithmum maritimum* — A scarce plant in Donegal, but it is 
plentiful at one place in Rossgull, and at Hornhead.
Bid ens tripartita e ; B.
cernua e.
— Increase in frequency 
westwards apparently, but both are local.
Cardans pratensis e; Achillea Ptarmica.
— More abundant and 
characteristic westwards, the thistle especially so ; it is rather 
scarce in Innishowen.
Lobelia Dortmanna ; TJtricularia minor.
— More plentiful in lakes 
and bog-holes westwards, as about Muckish, Glenveagh, and 
Errigal.
Arctostaphylos Uva-ursi.
— More abundant about Crohy Head 
and Aranmore than elsewhere.
Pyrola media ; Beta maritima ; Euphorbia portlandica.
— These 
three are all more frequent in Fanet than Innishowen.
Beta 
increases westwards from Malin Head, especially on headlands 
and outer cliffs.
Polygonum Hrjdropiper.
— Much commoner in Fanet.
Littorella lacustris.
— Becomes very abundant westwards, and 
fringes all mountain lakes at moderate altitudes.
Habenaria viridis.
— Very frequent in Fanet.
Jim i perns vana.
— Increases westwards ; characteristic in Fanet ; 
profusely abundant on Aranmore.
Sparyanium nutans.
— Commoner in bog-holes and lakes from 
Ramelton to Fanet than elsewhere.
S. minimum; Schcenus nigricans; Rhynchospora alba; Molinia 
cwrulea.
— More prevalent throughout the north-western moorlands.
Sparganium occurs in almost every lake westward.
Asplenium marinum.
— Much more abundant on the rocky coast 
of Fanet than Innishowen.
ON THE FLORA OF INNISHOWEN, CO.
DONEGAL, 77 
Osmimda regalis.
— Very rare in Innishowen ; becomes at once 
common and characteristic upon crossing Lough Swilly.
Hymenophyllum Wilsoni.
— Increases steadily westwards ; very 
abundant about Glenvegh, Slieve Snacht West, &c.
The above list only includes plants found in Innishowen, but to 
give a full idea of this subject I will mention a few characteristic 
or locally frequent species of Donegal which do not appear in 
Innishowen ; these are — 
Trollius europmis.
Polypodium Phegopteris.
Centunculus minimus, e.
Hymenophyllum Tunhriyense.
Eriocaulon septangidare.
None of these have yet been found in Innishowen ; Centunculus is 
likely to occur.
The above group of plants illustrates one fact : that the 
climate increases in humidity westwards.
Innishowen is drier and 
probably also colder than the western parts of the county.
The 
increasing variety and plenty of ferns show this, and others in the 
list are plants which are as much dependent upon the damp 
atmosphere for their leaves as damp soil for their roots.
The 
influence of the Gulf Stream is thus displayed, and especially in 
its rendering the winter milder to the west.
The species next enumerated diminish or disappear altogether 
after we cross Lough Swilly.
Rare plants are not taken into 
consideration : — v 
\Papaver dubium.
— Much scarcer in Fanet and westwards; a 
rare colonist.
Nuphar lutea e.
— Scarcer in the west.
\Barbarea vulgaris e.
— A rare colonist in North Donegal.
\ Sisymbrium officinale.
— Perhaps a colonist in Innishowen; 
almost certainly so in Fanet and farther west.
Capsella Bursa- pastoris.
— Decreases steadily, and probably a 
colonist far west.
*Senebiera Coronopus e.
— Not met with west of Innishowen; not 
native in Donegal.
I Reseda Luteola; Silene anglica e.
— Not met with west of 
Innishowen ; both are probably introduced weeds.
\S.
inflata e.
— Not met with in the extreme north-west.
Sarothamnus scoparlus — Scarce; rarer westwards, and not seen 
west of Mulroy.
Ulex europmis.
— Not native in the extreme north-west.
Trifolium pratense.
— Probably not native in North-west 
Donegal.
T. medium.
— Very scarce, but occurring to the extreme north- 
west ; a characteristic species of Innishowen.
T. ar reuse e.
— Not met with west of Innishowen.
Lotus major.
— Very rare westward.
Vicia hirsuta.
— Characteristic in Innishowen; much scarcer in 
Fanet, and not seen west of it.
V. ang-ustifolia.
— Not seen west of Innishowen.

Lathgrus pratensis.
— Not seeii in the extreme west.
Geiun urbanum.
— Scarce west of Dunfanaghy.
Kpilobium parvijlorum.
— Very rare, and soon disappears west of 
Lough S willy.
Epilobium hirsutum.
— Very rare west of Innishowen.
Ligusticam scoticum.
—   This species reaches a maximum in 
Innishowen ; its western limit is Tory Island.
Torilis Anthriscus.
— Not seen west of Carrigart.
Petasites vulgaris e.
— Not seen in the north-west, and probably 
not native west of Innishowen.
Lycopsis arvensis.
— Very rare in Fanet, and not seen west 
of it.
Mertensia maritima.
— I have seen this in one locality, on Boss- 
gull, west of Innishowen.
Scrophalaria aquatica e.
— Diminishes westwards.
I have no 
certain record west of Bamullan.
Utricularia vulgaris.
— Very scarce westwards.
Potamogeton pectinatus.
— Not seen west of Innishowen.
Car ex remote ; Melica wiiflora e ; Sclerochloa loliacea e ; 
Festuca arandinacea, e.
— None of these were met with in the 
extreme north west.
Equisetum maximum e.
— Not seen in North Donegal west of 
Glenvar, on the west side of Lough Swilly.
Lycopodium claratum.
— Not seen west of Innishowen.
Several of the above, and some others which might be adduced, 
are introduced plants or weeds of cultivation, which naturally 
decrease in the wilder parts of the county.
About half the 
decreasing species belong to the English type or are u inclining to 
English," the remainder being mostly British species which 
probably require more sun and less rain than Western Donegal 
can afford.
Plants belonging to the English type almost all 
decrease northwards and westwards.
There will be found three or 
four exceptions to this in the increasing list, t arditus pratensis being 
the only notable one.
Highland, Northern, and Atlantic species 
all increase in the western parts of the county, both in number and 
profusion, the Atlantic type only slightly so.
Speaking generally of 
the larger families, Umbellifera and Garices seem to fail most in 
Donegal, both in quantity and kind.
In contrasting the flora east and west of Lough Foyle, there is 
little more to be said than that the variety of species as we pass 
east steadily increases.
I am not going to enter into this contrast 
in detail, since it concerns the county Derry ; but, crossing from 
Innishowen Head to Magilligan Strand and then ascending Ben 
Evenagh, I at once found several species not met with in Northern 
Donegal, as Ilanunculus Lingua, Ahine wrna, Drgas octopetala, 
and Hordeum mnrimtm; Scilla nrna is also found there; and I 
noticed that others which have barely found their way across 
Lough Foyle are abundant on its eastern side, as Tri folium ar raise 
and Silene anglica; while colonists, weeds of cultivation, and 
species of Watson's English type of distribution become more 
prevalent.

With regard to Highland plants, Innishowen enters into closer 
competition with the mountains eastward, three species oc- 
curring which are unknown in the north-east of Ireland.
These 
are Saiissurea alpina, Polygonum viviparum, and Carex rigida.
The 
alpine flora of Innishowen is almost equal to that of Derry, Antrim 
and Down together, so far as they are yet made known, although 
these counties contain several mountain groups and the highest 
summits in the north of Ireland.
When we consider the size of 
Innishowen, this is equivalent to a decided increase.
The alpine 
flora of Donegal is superior to that of the north-east district in 
about the proportion of three to two.
The alpine flora of Ireland 
is best developed in the mountains of Sligo and Leitrim, diminishing 
northwards in Donegal, slightly more so in Galway and Mayo, and 
still more so in Kerry, although the highest Irish mountains occur 
there.
Northern and Atlantic species would perhaps have been expected 
to increase in the more western and northern districts, but this is 
by no means the case.
Excepting two, Trot/ins europmcs and 
Potamogeton Ji/iformis, which have not been found in Innishowen, 
all the northern species occurring in Donegal and many more are 
found in the north-east, where this group is best developed in 
Ireland.
With regard to Atlantic or Western plants, this type is poorly 
represented in the north of Ireland ; it is, moreover, quite 
unexpected to find a greater variety in the north-eastern than in the 
north-western counties.
Innishowen contains two species not found 
in the north-east, viz., Orobanche Hedera and Bartria riscosa; while 
two others, Statics occidental is and Adiantum Capillw- veneris, each 
occur in a single locality in the west of Donegal.
In opposition to 
this there are, according to the ' Cybele Hibemica,' eight Atlantic 
species in the north-east district which I have not found in Donegal.
This group of plants increases southwards on both coasts of Ireland, 
but more rapidly on the east ; and attains its maximum, I believe, 
in the south-east corner of Ireland.
In conclusion, the flora of Innishowen will be found to contain 
slightly above five hundred species ; about half the Irish flora, and 
five-sixths of the flora of Donegal.
Thirty species at least occurring 
in Innishowen do not appear to occur elsewhere in Donegal.
The 
area of Innishowen is about one-fifth of that of the whole county.
The extreme northern part of Innishowen, — the district of Malin, 
lying north of Culdaff and Malin estuaries — is a well-defined 
peninsula,, rising north of a low neck of land, at once, to a low 
mountainous country and from the most northern point of Ireland.
A rise in the sea-level of about four or five feet would connect 
Culdaff estuary on the east with Malin estuary on the west, and 
transform Malin to an island.
There is little cultivation on 
Malin ; it is chiefly moorland or devoted to sheep pasture, and is 
quite similar in physical features to its western neighbour Fanet.
Malin is oval in shape, its greater axis, from Culdaff to Malin Head, 
being twelve miles in length, and lying north-west and south-east, 
while its lesser axis is about five miles.
Its greatest elevation is 
80 A SYNOPSIS OF THE GENUS SELAGINELLA.
about 859 feet, insufficient, apparently, to harbour any of the truly 
alpine species found a few miles southwards.
Its area is not much 
less than that of Fanet, but its flora is much scantier.
I was 
unable to visit Innishtr ahull, but Dr. Dickie has recorded the 
finding of 44 species thereon, none of which appear to be of 
particular interest, except perhaps a remarkable variety of Euphrasia 
officinalis.
Some curious forms of this and other plants occur also 
about Malin Head.
Euphrasia sometimes occurs with long spikes, 
whose leaves are fleshy and densely packed along the stem, and the 
flowers large ; another variety has no stem, but forms an hemi- 
spherical body of white flowers, lying on the ground like a little 
snowball about two or three inches across, perhaps due to con- 
tinually being browsed on by sheep.
Teiicrium Scorodonia becomes 
fleshy, with wrinkled reflexed oblong leaves, quite a queer-looking 
plant.
Triodia decumbens grows in prostrate patches, its stem about 
three inches long.
Plantago lanceolata has thick leaves which 
almost conceal their ribs, and become so narrow as almost to equal 
in width and resemble those of wide-leaved alpine forms of Plantago 
maritima, which also occur.
Lastrea Filir-mas is very stunted and 
s l ia ggy> equivalent to alpine var.
abbreviata ; and Kcderia grows on 
the west side, from two to three inches in height, and is almost 
unrecognizable.
On the other hand, Asplenium marinum, Sediw 
Rkodiola, and Liyusticum scoticnm attain great perfection ; Mertenda 
maritima is more luxuriant than I have seen it, except in Greenland, 
and Honckenya peploides had to be looked at in the hand before 
it could be identified.
I have described it in its proper place.
The 
soil at the extremity of Malin Head is a carpet of stunted Sedum 
ayxglicum, Plantago maritima, P.
Coronopus, and Armaria maritima, 
grass there being scanty.
A few species increase northwards, and 
are more plentiful in this district than elsewhere in Innishowen.
These are 
Vicia hirsute.

Warren, near Frodingham ; and a publication of the fact was given 
at p.
134 of the ' Botanical Eecord Club Report ' for 1875, after an 
examination of a Mr. E.
Coates's specimens — one in fruiting state ; 
the other a creeping, barren branch.
The stratum upon which 
they grew, and the general conditions of the site, being very similar to 
those of the West Gloucester L.
com planatum , Mr. Druce suggested 
that the Lincoln plant had in reality been complanatum also.
Thinking it might possibly be so, I have procured the loan of what 
are, I believe, the only specimens now in existence of this extinct 
Lincolnshire species.
They were gathered in 1857, by Messrs.
W. 
Fowler and E.
Coates, at a spot where ironworks now stand; and 
they are, as you may see, undoubtedly typical alpinum, not even 
showing that approach to a complanate arrangement of the leaves 
which is presented by Mr. Druce's intermediates gathered in West 
Boss and South Aberdeen.
His Glydyr Fawr specimens seem to 
me much nearer Father Reader's Gloucestershire ones.
A similar 
intermediate form grows on Ingleborough, in West Yorkshire, the 
approach to complanatum being most evident whilst the plant is 
young and barren, and spreads fan-like upon the ground ; but I 
should call none of these true complanatum, nor indeed expect that 
to occur at all in our more alpine stations, since even in the United 
States the typical plant has a tendency to southern restriction, and 
in Canada and the North becomes sabinu folium Willd.

Utricularia neolecta Lehm.
in Middlesex.
— Messrs.
C. 
Chantre, J.
E. Jackson, and myself, found this species in con- 
siderable quantity, in the autumn of 1881, in several large ponds 
near the railway- station betw r een Staines and Wraysbury.
At first 
I was in doubt whether to credit Bucks or Middlesex with the new 
ft 
record, but a reference to the railway authorities settled the matter 
in favour of the latter county.
In the first place it is better to 
state that Professor Babington, who kindly examined my plant, 
has confirmed the name.
The figure in   English Botany/ hi., tab.
1125 bis, is a bad one ; the foliage, as represented there, gives no 
idea of the foliage of the living plant, and the form of the Up too 
is quite unlike that in the fresh flower — indeed, the only character 
fairly rendered seems to be that supplied by the length of the 
pedicels and their position.
The figure in 'Flora Danica,' 12, tab.
1981, is much more satisfactory.
There seems a pretty general 
belief amongst British botanists that U.
neglecta is a small plant ; 
the Middlesex one is, however, almost as large as U.
vulgaris* The 
lip is described in Babington's Manual has a broad flat spreading 
margin, and one character not mentioned in that work I par- 
ticularly observed in the fresh state, W:., the veining of the palate.

Aliens in Gloucestershire, — There is a spot in the parish 
of Kingswood, Gloucestershire, about four miles north-east of 
Bristol, which deserves mention on account of the extensive 
collection of alien plants known to have existed there for some 
years.
It is a small heap of shaly debris (about 50 yards by 25) on 
the slope of a low hill, and surrounded by cornfields.
This heap 
may have been the result of an old trial-boring for coal, but at 
present there is no pit or working in the near vicinity; and 
enquiries show that the place has remained undisturbed for about 
twenty years.
Last summer a friend and I made several visits to 
the place, and gathered the plants whose names are appended.
We 
cannot learn the means whereby they were imported; — probably 
with foreign corn or fodder.
They are all alien to the Kingswood 
district, and, with few exceptions, to that of the Bristol coal-fields.

BOTANICAL NOMENCLATURE.
[The following note was communicated by Baron von Mueller 
to the Melbourne ' Chemist and Druggist ' for September, 1882, 
and seems to us of sufficient interest to deserve wider circulation.] 
At first sight it may seem unimportant to devote close atten- 
tion to the synonymy of plants ; but it should be considered that 
unless phytographic authors came to permanent agreement about 
nomenclature, we would have to burden our memory with a 
multiplicity of names, much against facility and acceleration of our 
studies.
To effect conformity of opinion on names in biomorphic 
science, whether phytological or zoological, the only rule to settle 
disputes is that of (djsolut<> priority; and that rule ought to be 
subject to no exceptions, unless the original names were untenable 
through generic misplacement or through etymologic incorrectness 
— the former having been of freciuent, the latter of rare, occurrence.
BOTANICAL NOMENCLATURE.

To illustrate the argument, I have chosen the genus Vahea 
Some difficulty arises in fixing the precise date of the first pub- 
lication of this genus, because the * Illustration des Genres/ in 
which at page 292 of tome 2, and on planche 169, Vahea <jiunmifera 
was established by Lamarck, was elaborated at a time when 
horrors of war, intensified by their duration and extensiveness, 
were disturbing all peaceful scientific research at the verge of the 
last and at the commencement of the present century ; thus the 
"Illustration," which was arranged according to the Lhmean 
system, and had therefore Vahea in the Pentandria, though com- 
mencing to appear in 1791, became finished only by Poiret in 1823 
(as I notice in my own bound copy), long after its originator had 
been struck with blindness, a calamity which he had to bear during 
many of the last years of his life.
Collaterally also the volumes 
of Lamarck's ' Encyclopedic Methodique ' were successively issued, 
commenced in 1783, but continued from 1804 — 1817 by Poiret 
also ; and as that work was arranged alphabetically, Vahea could 
take its place only in the last volume.
This led to the supposition 
that the description of Vahea was issued only in 1817, and 
seemingly for this reason the venerable Bentham, in the ever- 
memorable ' Genera Plantarum,' which resulted during the last 
twenty years as one of the main achievements of his and Sir Joseph 
Hooker's great labours, thought proper to suppress Vahea, when 
observing its identity with the genus Landolphia, which latter 
became described and figured in 1801 by Palisot de Beauvois 
('Flore d'Oware, i., 54, t.
34).
Nevertheless I felt persuaded that 
even Lamarck's plate alone of Vahea gummifera was sufficient for 
claiming priority, and with this view I transferred Landolpliia to 
Va/na, when in the Calcutta, Sydney and Cassel editions (the 
latter a translation by Dr. Goeze) of my ' Select Plants for In- 
dustrial Culture,' and also in the enlarged English edition of Witt- 
stein's   Organic Constituents of Plants ' I had to deal with the 
India-rubbers among other plants.
But eager to ascertain whether 
the views held by me were correct, I incidentally addressed Iff.
Alphonse de Candolle, whose illustrious parent had much co- 
operated botanically with Lamarck, especially by editing and much 
enlarging the third edition of the ' Flore Franeaise ' as published 
in 1805.
This leading phytographer, who had himself, for his 
father's " Prodronius," in 1844, elaborated the Apoct/naeea, to which 
also Vahea belongs, affords me now from Geneva (under date 
of 27th July, 1882) the desired information, which, so far as Vahea 
is concerned, I verbally translate : — " Your question, relative to the 
parts (livraisons) of Lamarck's illustration, has given me some 
trouble, as our copy at Geneva does not indicate anything.
For- 
tunately, while searching through the old periodicals, I found in 
Burner's   Archiv fur die Botanik 
ik,' ii.
(1799) that Millinhad spoken 
is ' Magasin Encyclop^dique, vol.
i. 
of Lamarck's publication in his 
As I had not this at Geneva, I asked Dr. Fournier to search for it 
in Paris, and to give if possible the dates of the numbers of 
Lamarck.
He found that Millin did allude to them in 1797, by 
saying the sixtieth livraison had appeared, and that the number of 
88 NOTICES OF BOOKS.
plates published was seven hundred.
We need therefore not look 
further at what date each number came out, as it is certain that 
Vahea and all the names anterior to plate 701 are older than those 
of Palisot de Beauvois, his belonging all to the present century.
If Fournier should succeed in finding out the dates of each number 
of Lamarck, he will likely publish them in the ' Bulletin de la 
Societe Botanique de France." It remains still to be noted that 
nearly forty years ago Alphonse de Candolle regarded already 
Pacouria of Aublet (' Histoire des Plantes de la Guiane Frai^aise,' 
i., 268, t.
105) as closely allied to Vahea; but even if both should 
prove congeric it would be best to adhere to the appellation Vahea, 
because Aubiet in the same work has among Composite a genus 
Pacourina, vol.
ii., 800, t.
316 (1775), which the elder De Candolle 
and lately also Bentham and Hooker have maintained.
[In the last number (the 94th) of his * Fragmenta/ Baron von 
Mueller points out that the well-known Sapotaceous genus Bassia 
is not the rightful possessor of that name.
He says: "Bassia 
generice stabiliebatur ab Allioni in Melanges de Philosophic et de

The steady progress of this very important contribution to our 
colonial floras is a matter for congratulation.
Sir Joseph Hooker 
has been fortunate in securing the active co-operation of so accurate 
and steady a worker as Mr. C.
B. Clarke, who is responsible for 
the greater portion of the part now before us, the orders Sapotacm$ 
Ebenacere, — which we had expected Mr. W.
P. Hiern would have un- 
dertaken, — Myrwnem and Styracea, having fallen to his share, while 
Sir Joseph Hooker has elaborated the Primulacem and Apocynem.
It would be impossible for anyone possessed of less knowledge 
than the illustrious botanists named to criticise the execution of 
the work from the botanical standpoint ; but there are one or two 
minor, though not unimportant, matters which suggest a word or 
two of comment.
NOTICES OF BOOKS.
89 
We have before animadverted* upon the unfortunate and 
misleading practice of quoting as if from the ' Genera Plantarum ' 
names which are not to be found in its pages.
Both Sir Joseph 
Hooker and Mr. Clarke constantly sin in this manner.
Thus 
we have — 
5> 
" Alyxia gracilis Benth.
in Gen. PI.
ii.
697 [698] .
" Iiauivolfta densifiora Benth.
in Gen. PI.

" 
11 Baissea acuminata Benth.
in Gen. PI.
ii.
719." 
" Rhynchodia Waliichii Benth.
in Gen. PL ii.
720." 
None of these names are to be found in the   Genera.' Of course 
Mr. Daydon Jackson will take care to set all this right in his new 
' Steudel' (which all botanists will be glad to know is making 
steady progress) ; but people w T ho have not the ' Genera ' to refer 
to, or are content to take their names as the authority of the 
1 Flora of British India,' will append " Benth." to these names as 
a matter of course, although "Hook, f." is the real authority.
Mr. Clarke (p.
588) names two species of Symplocos thus : 
" S.
Henscheli Benth.
in Gen. PL ii.
669.
Cordylohlaste Henscheli 
Moritzi." 
" 8.
Maingayi Benth.
in Gen. PI.
ii.
669." 
We turn to the reference, and find " Sect.
2. Cordylohlaste" of the 
genus Symplocos, consisting of two species, " Cordylohlaste Moritz.
in Bot. Zeit.
1848, 604, et species nova a Maingayo lecta." Even 
if it be assumed that Mr. Bentham elaborated the Styracea for the 
1 Genera,' and that he would have retained for Moritzi's plant its 
original specific name, what evidence is there in the above extract — 
all that bears upon the subject — that he named Maingay's plant 
Maingayi f 
In dealing with the Primulacece Sir Joseph Hooker appears to 
have overlooked a paper by Klatt, on the species collected by the 
brothers De Schlagintweit, in High Asia, in 1855-57, published in 
this Journal for 1868, pp.
120-125.
In this paper is described and 
figured (t.
78) a new species of Primula, P.
(Aleurita) Tdemachica 
Klatt, which finds no mention in the   Flora of British India.' 
Lysimachia evalvis Wall., is said to be " apparently identical with 
the Chinese L.
Famum-yracum Hance MSS."; but this latter 
species was fully described by Dr. Hance in this Journal for 1877 
(p.
355), where it is said to be " closely allied to L.
ramosa Wall." 
L. evalvis is scentless, but certainly seems otherwise to correspond 
very closely with Dr. Hance' s specimen of L.
Vcmum-gr cecum in the 
National Herbarium.
Under L.
javanica Bl. are cited as syno- 
nyms " L.
consobriua Hance MSS., L.
decurrem Hance Herb." 
L. consobriua was published by Dr. Hance in 1860 (Ann. Sci.
Nat., 
5 Ser. v.
244), and has since been reduced by him (Joum.
Bot., 1877, 357) to L.
decurrem Forst.
— an identification which is 
borne out by Forster's type- specimen in the National Herbarium 
and apparently accepted by Sir Joseph Hooker, who includes New

Caledonia in the distribution of the species.
It is not easy to 
understand why Blume's name (1825) should take precedence of 
Forster's, published in 1786.
A new species, L.
chennpodioid.es, 
is cited as of M Watt in Journ.
Linn.
Soc. ined.," but it does not 
appear in his paper on Indian Primulacea recently published in the 
Linnean Society's Journal.
Under L.
prolifera Klatt, the MS.
name lineolata, under which u Lysimachia No. 3" of Strachey and 
Winterbottorn's Himalayan Herbarium was distributed, might 
have been cited.
L. obovata is quoted as of " Herb.
Ham.
; Wall.
Cat. 1488." We do not know on what authority Hamilton's name 
is attached; there is certainly no plant so named in his herbarium, 
and Wallich, in his Catalogue, — or rather ' List,' — no.
1488, calls 
the plant L.
obovata Wall.
With regard to the new species of 
Primula a point of some difficulty arises.
On the last page 
(index excluded) appears a statement that "all the species here 
for the first time described will be found, t< " 
them, in a paper by Dr. Watt, shortly to be published in the 
'Journal of the Linnean Society'"; and in the ' Flora,' "Watt 
in Journ.
Linn.
Soc. ined." is appended to the names of most 
of these.
Dr. Watt's paper appeared on December 18th, and 
we believe we are accurate in saying that this was the first 
publication of these species.
Of course, had the description 
first appeared in the ' Flora' as stated, "Hook, til." instead of 
"Watt" would have had to be cited by subsequent writers as 
the authority for them.
We have already referred to the new spelling of the name 
Willughbeia — " WHUnujhhda" — which is adopted throughout the 
genus.
At first sight this seems only another case of Oh inch on a v.
Cinchona.
Had it been so, the innovation would have been 
unjustifiable; but when we find that the name of the friend of 
Ray, whom it commemorates, was always spelt Willughby,* we are 
at a loss to imagine what can have suggested the alteration.
Miquel's genus Micrechites is spelt Microchites, but this is probably 
merely a slip.
It need hardly be added that criticism of this kind does not, and 
is not intended to, detract from full recognition of the value of the 
work as a whole.
But we venture to think that a little more 
attention to the rules of nomenclature would improve what is as it 
stands a most useful Flora.
Mr. E.
M. Holmes has issued the first fasciculus, containing 
25 species, of his * Algae Britanniese rariores exsiccatae.' Twenty 
of the species are new to Britain, and the remainder are very rare.
Mr. Holmes writes : — " No. 5 (Dictyosiphon ktppuroide*) is of especial 
interest, since Agardh, erroneously I feel sure, regards it as a form 
of Chordaria Jla<jeUiformis.
It is never met with in the Soutli

understand Agardh's determination, except by supposing that on 
the shores of Norway and Sweden it is almost always found on that 
plant, just as Elachista fucicola or Polysiphonia fastu/iata are on 
Fucus in this country.
No. 23 is a plant which has long passed 
under the name of Spkaeelaria plumosa, but it is quite distinct from 
Lyngbye's plant in having fruit on the ultimate ramuli.
No. 1 has 
been identified as the Spkaeelaria plumom of Lyngbye by a com- 
parison with a portion of Lyngbye's type -specimen, lent to me for 
the purpose by Dr. Bornet.
Lyngbye's plant has fruit on small 
special branches, forming a dense velvety layer surrounding the main 
stem or primary axes, and is therefore a Cladostephus, with which 
also it agrees in stem structure.
I have therefore named his plant 
Cladostephus pluniosus, and the other Spkaeelaria pluwiyent" The 
fasciculus is well mounted and arranged ; and the specimens, 
although sometimes small, on account of their extreme rarity, are 
well selected.
Undek the title ' Colin Clout's Calendar ' (Chatto & Windus), 
Mr. Grant Allen reprints a series of essays from the ' St. James's 
Gazette.' " The greater number of the papers are botanical, and 
these," says Mr. Allen, " I hope will be found to contain some new 
and original evolutionary views." We trust the said views will be 
found more accurate than some of the facts upon which they are 
based.
Thus we read, il Whenever you find a single comparatively 
inconspicuous plant among these families — for example, Solomon's 
Seal, with its small drooping greenish-white blossoms — one is sure 
to find also that it is a bulbless annual"!
This is M new, but not 
true." The essays, how r ever, are very pleasant reading,

contains much useful information conveyed in a pleasing manner.
We are glad to record the appearance of another part (the 15th) 
of Baillon's admirable * Dictionnaire de Botanique ' (Cycl — Diet.).
Valuable as it is, its usefulness will be seriously impaired unless

LINNEAN SOCIETY OF LONDON.
December 7, 1882.
— Sir J.Lubbock, Bart., President, in the 
chair.
— The following gentlemen were elected Fellows of the So- 
ciety : — The Rev. R.

H. Corry, 0.
L. 
Fraser, D.
Houston, A.
W. Howitt, H.
McCallnm, E.

C. Stone.
— The Rev. R.
P. Murray showed speci- 
mens of Althaa hirsuta, Vicia Orobus, and Phlamis fruticosa, obtained 
by him last summer in Somerset.- — Mr. Dyer exhibited and ex 
plained maps illustrative of the Phylloxera in Spain and Portugal.
In 1881 there was only one infested centre to the east of Oporto ; 
in 1882 there were five others, and there could be little doubt 
that it would over the whole of northern Portugal.
In Spain the 
vineyards of the province of Malaga were more than two-thirds 
infested ; there seemed no hope that any would escape, and 
the consequent loss would be very great, as the annual value of 
their products was a million and a half, more than that of all the 
other agricultural products put together.
— Mr. Dyer also exhibited 
photographs of the cultivation of Cinchona succirubra (trees eight to 
ten years old, 25-30 ft.
high) and C.
officinalis in Ceylon.
— A paper 
by J.
G. Otto Tepper was read, wherein he recounted the discovery 
by him, near Adelaide, South Australia, of above ninety species of 
Tasmanian plants.
—   A contribution by Dr. W.
Nylander and 
the Rev. J.
M. Crombie was read, " On a Collection of Exotic 
Lichens made in Eastern Asia by the late Dr. A.
C. Maingay.' 
Those enumerated were from British Burmah, China and Japan ; 
some are interesting as illustrations of Lichen distribution, and 
others as new species and varieties.
— The Rev. R.
P. Murray 
afterwards made some remarks on cleistogamic flowers of Hoya 
carnosa producing fertile flowers.
Dec. 21.— A.
W. Bennett, Esq., M.A., in the chair.— Prof.
A. 
Ernst, of Caracas, and Dr. W.
C. Ondaatje, of Ceylon, were elected 
Fellows.
— Mr. Thos.
H. Corry read a paper   On the Development 
and Mode of Fertilization of the Flower of Asclepias Cornuti Dene./ 
of which the following is a summary : — R.
Brown (1809), J.
B. 
Payer (1857), and H.
Schackt, have all made Asclepias the subject 
of careful study.
Mr. Corry has nevertheless been able to add 
new observations thereto.
The large disk-shaped body which 
crowns and is common to the two styles, and which he terms for 
convenience the stigma-di&k, is shown to be formed by the fusion 
of the two style-apices, and not by that of the two stigmas.
He has 
carefully indicated the mode of formation of the stigmatic corpuscula 
and their appendages, both of which are simply elaborate cases of 
the external excretion of a viscid liquid gum from certain papilli- 
form cells of the surface of the stigma-disk, which afterwards 
dries and hardens.
The antlier-alfe he finds originate as lateral 
processes of the connective; and he has further ascertained, in 
opposition to the ideas of Brown and Brongniart, that at five points, 
LINNEAN SOCIETY OF LONDON.

directly opposite the five alar fissures, a slight means of communi- 
cation exists between the parts enclosed in the interior of the 
staminal tube and the exterior of the flower.
Owing to the 
adhesion of the lower edge of the stigma-disk to the apex of the 
staminal column not being so complete here as in the regions 
of the five anthers, five radial furrows are in consequence left, by 
means of which the papillar tissue of the stigma, which he finds 
clothes the whole inferior surface of the stigma-disk, is exposed.
From a very complete study of the different stages in the develop- 
ment of the pollen mass in Asclepias, it appears that this genus 
presents, in its entire details, a perfectly unique, isolated, and 
peculiar case of formation.
The earlier stages are only to be found 
paralleled in the single instance of Zoster a (which had been studied 
by W.
Hofmeister), a genus that affords either the most primitive 
or the most aberrant type of pollen formation known.
The later 
stages find no precise parallel in the entire range of the vegetable 
kingdom.
The late period to which the tape turn persists, and the 
conversion of those walls of its cells which adjoin the contents 
of the loculus into cutin to form the firm investing membrane 
of the pollen-mass, the absence of an endothecium, and the peculiar 
mode of dehiscence of the anthers, are among the especially note- 
worthy features.
In connection with fertilization, the mode of 
formation of the curious combination of corpuscula with each 
other is elucidated, and these series are shown to be of two kinds, 
viz., unilateral and dichotomous.
Cross-fertilization is the great 
law in Asclejnas, and in some cases it is requisite that the cross 
should be not only between distinct flowers, but between those 
of distinct individuals produced from seed in order that progeny 
may result, the plant apparently being self-impotent to its own 
pollen.
— Mr. Baker then read the second part of his ' Contributions 
to the Flora of Madagascar,' in which he dealt with the descrip- 
tions of about one hundred and sixty new gamopetalous dicoty- 
ledons, gathered in Madagascar by recent English collectors, 
especially the Eev. E.
Baron, F.L.S..
of the London Missionary 
Society.
The most interesting is Schismatoclada, a new genus 
of PiubiacecB allied to Cinchona.
The other new genera are Telia- 
spidium, of the group of semiparasitic Serophulariacece, such as 
Pedictdaris and Melampyrum, which turn completely black in 
drying, remarkable for its four shield-shaped one-celled anthers ; 
Forsythiopm, an erect shrubby Acanthaceous genus, with flowers 
like For$ythia and leaves not fully developed till after the flowers 
fade; and Mnnachochlamys, another genus of Antnthacetz allied to 
Mendoncia and Thunheryia, with numerous small flowers, each con- 
tained in a persistent spathaceous bract, like the hood of a 
Franciscan monk.
Of representatives of well-known European 
genera the present collection includes two species of Anayallis 
nearly allied to tenella, two Ajugas, a Salvia, two Micromerias, three 
species of Stachys, five Senecios, three Cynoglossums; and a Lysi- 
wachia.
The genera represented most largely are Datiais, Veronica, 
llelichrysutn, Oaertnera, Clerodendron and Hypoestes.
There is a single 
species of the beautiful Acanthaceous genus Strohilanthes, which is 
96 LINNEAN SOCIETY OF LONDON.
represented in India by above a hundred species, and a new Vinca, 
allied to rosea.
Of endemic genera, known previously in the 
Island, there are new species of Aspilia, Epallage and Onco sternum.
Of Cape types the principal are a Ly/htfootia, a Halleria, an Alectra, 
and two heaths of the genus Philippia.
— Mr. Baker also communi- 
cated a paper containing descriptions of about thirty new plants 
from Fiji, named, but not characterised by Mr. John Home, in his 
recently-published report to Sir Arthur Gordon on the economic 
capabilities of that group of islands, which we noticed in this 
Journal for 1882 (p.
27).
— The Eev. J.
M. Crombie read a short 
paper on additions to the Lichens of the i Challenger ' Expedition.
January 18, 1883.
— Sir John Lubbock, Bart., President, in the 
chair.
— The following gentlemen were elected Fellows of the 
Society : Edwd.
A. L.
Batteris, Alf. J.
Burrows, Edgar F.
Cooper, 
Prof.
J. A.
Harker, and Geo. Lewis.
— Mr. H.
Groves exhibited a 
specimen of Ranunculus ophioglossifolius from Hampshire (see p.
51).
A paper was read, " On the fall of branchlets in the Aspen 
(Populus tremula)" by Samuel G.
Shattock.
The author remarks 
that in the exogenous trees, with some few exceptions, the death of 
a branchlet is followed by its ultimate detachment, but only after 
the lapse of a long period, during which the wood of the dead part 
undergoes changes which render it so brittle that it is readily 
snapped across.
In this process the living parenchyma of the bark 
furnishes by transverse partitionipg a line of corky tissue, sharply 
defining the living from the dead structures.
In a few cases 
demarcation ensues in the pith and medullary rays, the woody 
tissue and bast-fibres alone remaining continuous.
After separation 
of the dead stump, the fractured surface is covered in by an over- 
growth of new tissue produced from the cambium.
There is still 
another process, named many years ago by the Rev. M.
J, Berkeley 
" Cladoptosis." In this externally the union of the branchlet with 
the branch shows a marked enlargement similar to what occurs at 
the base of petioles.
Through the middle of this disarticulation 
takes place.
A longitudinal section shows a general increase of the 
medullary area, wood, and cortical system.
We are glad to learn that it has been decided to open Kew 
Gardens to the public at 12 instead of 1 p.m. When the agitation 
which has resulted in this satisfactory alteration was first set on 
foot, we expressed an opinion (Journ.
Bot., 1878, p.
128) that 
" their earlier opening was much to be desired, " and that any 
danger of interference with the strictly scientific work of the 
Gardens was " wholly in apprehension"; and we shall be surprised 
if the Kew officials find any cause to complain of the consequences 
of a concession which might, we venture to think, have been more 
generous than it is at present.

(Herb, propr.

An interesting addition to the small group to which it belongs, 
very distinct by the form of its leaves.
Besides the four species 
enumerated by Bentham and Hooker fil.,* I have no doubt that 
the Arctic- Siberian P.
Pawlowskianum Glehn belongs here, and not 
to the section Aconogonon, where its founder placed it.f I have 
been enabled to compare mine with all five plants.
It is not without sadness that I dedicate this, the last botanical 
novelty received from him, to my accomplished friend F.
B. Forbes, 
one of its discoverers, who, to my deep regret, and very unfortu- 
nately for the interests of Chinese Botany, has recently bidden a 
final farewell to the Central Empire.

TWO NEW BEBMUDAN PLANTS.
By W.
B. He.aisley, A.L.S.
With the exception perhaps of the Palms, which are at present 
imperfectly known, the following are the only probably endemic 
fiow r ering plants in the Bermudas.
I say probably endemic, 
because I think it equally probable that these forms may occur on 
the American continent, or in the West Indies, as well as in the 
Bermudas.
In this poverty of the endemic element the vegetation 
of the Bermudas finds a parallel in the flora of the Azores.

— Perennis, habitu foliisque 
Ccnyza ricularis, a qua differt capitulis radiatis minoribus nurnerosi-

TWO NEW BERMUDAN PLANTS, 105 
This Erigeron is in habit a very distinct species ; but it may 
have acquired its distinctive character from its habitat in the 
islands in a comparatively short period.
In habit, foliage, and 
even achenes, it bears so strong a resemblance to the Brazilian 
Conyza rivularis Garcln.
that I could not resist the comparison.
Of 
course the decided ray, as the genera are limited, would stamp it 
as an Krigeron.
The name of the Hon. J.
H. Darrell has been associated with 
this plant as an acknowledgment of the service rendered to Botany 
in his communications to Sir J.
H. Lefroy.
Mr. Darrell is a native 
of the islands, and the oldest inhabitant; and he has recorded 
some useful information respecting the introduction of certain 
plants, not only of facts within his own memory, but also of others 
transmitted from his father.

— In salsuginosis Wai- 
singham Bermudae, Lefroy.
This is probably the same plant identified as Statice Caroliniana 
Nutt.
by Dr. J.
Eein.
What the true S.
Caroliniana Nutt.
is I am 
not able to define ; but the Bermudan plant is quite distinct from 
anything I have seen from North America.
Its nearest affinity is 
with S.
J>a/n<siensis, from which it is distinguishable at a glance, 
tbough the technical characters that separate the species are slight.
The differences are chiefly in the habit and stature of the plant, 
the mode of branching of the panicle, the slenderness and straight- 
ness of the ultimate branchlets, the size of the spikelets, and the 
size, consistence, and shape of the bracts.
Dr. Asa Gray regards 
all the eastern coast forms of Static* as belonging to S.
Limonium, 
whilst Chapman retains #, Caroliniana as a distinct species, fol- 
lowing in this M.
Boissier in his monograph in DeCaudolle's 
'Prodromus.' I think myself there are two species represented by 
the eastern North American specimens I have seen.
General Sir 
J. Henry Lefroy was formerly Governor of the Bermudas, and 
during his governorship he collected a considerable number of wild 
plants that we have seen from no other source, to say nothing of 
the important historical works connected with the islands that he 
has edited.

or Phyllostieta Kahnicola, is the form represented by the authentic 
specimens, therefore the adoption of another specific name is 
perhaps justifiable.
Specimens of Septoria Kalmia Cke.
& Ellis, 
from New Jersey, called Septoria Kahniacola Schwein., do not 
correspond to anything we know amongst the descriptions and 
specimens of Schweinitz, and therefore its filiform spores are 
sufficient to entitle it to retain the distinct name of Septoria 
Kahnue C.
& E.
Whether it is the stylosporous condition of 
Spharella (L&stadia) hwnatodes B.
& C.
is open to doubt.

SHOET NOTES.
Cephalozia Turneri Hook, in North Wales.
— Becently, in 
looking over my first collection of hepatics, made at Dolgelly, North 
Wales, March, 1875, I found associated with other species this rare 
and beautiful one.
According to Dr. Spruce's memoir ' On Cepha- 
lozia,' this species has only previously been found in the South- 
west of Ireland; Bantry (Miss Hutchins) ; Cromaglown (S.
0, 
Lindberg).
England : Sussex, Tilgate Forest (Edw. Jenner, May, 
1812 ; GL Davies, 1879).

Agrostis nigra With.
— Wishing to have the opinion of that 
eminent botanist, Prof.
Hackel, of St. Poelten, on the Agrostis 
nigra With., noticed in this Journal for 1882 (pp.
65, 66 ; tab.
227), 
I recently sent him specimens of the plant, together with typical 
specimens of A.
vulgaris and A.
a! ha.
A few days since I received 
a very courteous reply from Prof.
Hackel, and, as his remarks on 
these plants may possibly interest English botanists, I send the 
following quotation from his letter : — u I am very much obliged to 
you for the kindness with which you have furnished me the 
materials for forming a judgment of my own on the Agrostis nigra 
of your country.
There is no doubt that this form is in some 
degree intermediate between A.
vulgaris With, and A.
alba L., and 
that it weakens the distinction between these two almost generally 
accepted species.
But whoever will take the trouble of assembling 
in his herbarium as many specimens of the two species from as 
many stations as possible (and I may say I possess about a hundred 
specimens from various stations between Gibraltar and Tromsoe 
juul the Caucasus) will find that there are many more of such 
intermediate forms as your A.
?dgra 9 though I have none in my 
herbarium exactly identical with it.
Some specimens from the 
Pyrenees (A.
vulgaris, var.
macroglossum mihi) come very near to 
your plant.
On the other hand, there are forms of A.
alba with 
panicle-branches naked below, and spreading, even when fruit- 
bearing.
There are only two ways of expressing the existing state 
of things: either we restrict the names of A.
alba and A.
vulgaris 
to the typical forms (as represented in your collection) and admit 
at least three or four intermediate species between the two, or we 
reunite all into one, which must be called A.
stoloni/era L., and 
distinguish its various forms as subspecies, varieties, &c.
I should

locality, which has been placed in the Herbarium of the British Museum.

SHORT NOTES* 111 
prefer the latter way, as I am inclined to consider species as natural 
groups, seldom homogeneous, but more frequently consisting of 
inferior rank and slighter differences, though these differences may 
be constant in a great number of specimens.
In making out the 
European Festucas I made the experience that it would be quite 
impossible to distinguish all distinguishable and perhaps hereditary 
forms as species ; and the genus Af/rostis would give, I am sure, 
another proof of the same kind." I may state that I am able in 
part to corroborate the opinion of Prof.
Hackel, that there are still 
other forms of A.
vulgaris than the one that I have ventured to call 
A. nigra Withering, as last year I found an abundant growth of a 
grass intermediate between that variety and typical A.
vulgaris, i.e., 
having the same habit as A.
nigra, the same vigorous growth, but 
having the shorter or less prominent ligule, and only slightly- 
toothed glumes of A.
vulgaris; and I also found a form of A.
alba 
near Kenilworth that in the flowering state closely resembled 
A. nigra ; but in the fruiting state the panicles were mostly closed, 
though in many instances the upper branches were closed, whilst 
the lower ones were open.
This last differed from A* nigra, how- 
ever, in the paler flowers, more prominent acute ligules, and very 
rough leaf-sheaths.

Gloucestershire Aliens.
— Mr. White's description (p.
86) of 
the little colony of aliens observed by him at Kingswood, near 
Bristol, is interesting from the fact that these plants seem to have 
held their ground for several years.
In number and variety of 
introduced species — waifs and strays of casual origin — few counties 
probably exceed Gloucestershire.
The splendid herbarium of that 
county, formed by Dr. St.
Brody, and lately, I believe, presented 
to the Gloucester Museum, contains specimens of all such aliens 
met with by that gentleman — and very numerous they are.
On 
waste ground at Sharpness Docks — fifteen miles below Gloucester 
— I have found, summer after summer, large numbers of foreign 
plants introduced with grain from different parts of Europe.
Amongst them have been most of those mentioned by Mr. White, 
together with others — Xantluum spinosum, for instance, and Bromtu 
patulus.
At the same time, though the ground has not been enclosed 
or otherwise disturbed since I have known the locality, no two suc- 
cessive years have produced the same set of plants.
Saponaria 
Voce aria, let me say, has been plentiful one summer, but next season 
has given place, perhaps, to some unfamiliar Crucifer or Composite, 
An exception must be made for Lepidium ruderale, — equally, no 
doubt, an introduction from abroad, but one which has become 
permanent, and is spreading.
Considering the very inconstant 
character of the alien flora at Sharpness, it seems curious that 
similar plants succeed in reproducing themselves from year to year 
at Kingswood, in the same county.

NOTICES OF BOOKS.
The Flora of Hampshire, including the Isle of Wight ; or, a List 
of the Floiverintj Plants and Ferns found in the County of 
Southampton, with localities of the less common species.
By 
Frederick Townsend, M.A., F.L.S., &c.
London : L.
Keeve 
and Co. 1883.
The scientific literature of one of the most beautiful and inte- 
resting of the English counties has received a valuable addition 
through the publication of a Flora of a first-class description.
The 
* Flora of Hampshire/ promised for some time past, but delayed 
in publication by the regretted illness of the author, has at length 
appeared.
The amount of valuable information brought before us 
in the volume is immense, and does credit to the industry of the 
author, especially as his details are generally such as to make us 
wish they were fuller rather than otherwise.
Of all the British 
county Floras with which we are familiar, this one of Hampshire 
most nearly resembles Trimen & Dyer's admirable one of Middlesex.
The main divisions of the two works are very similar.
The Intro- 
NOTICES OF BOOKS.
121 
duction comprises short particulars respecting the topography, 
climate, and geology of the county ; also outlines of the twelve 
botanical districts, founded on the river basins, into which it is 
divided ; a list of the principal works quoted and herbaria con- 
sulted ; and an explanation and abbreviation of the signs employed.
The Flora proper next occupies no less than 469 closely printed 
pages.
The work, however, is continued up to 524 pages by notes 
on the districts ; lists of the rare and more noteworthy plants in 
each district ; comparison of the flora with that of the neighbouring 
counties ; of Hampshire mainland with the Isle of Wight ; com- 
parison with Mr. Watson's sub-provinces ; list of species having a 
certain limit in the county as compared with the rest of England ; 
reference to M.
Thurman's • Essai de Phytostatique' ; a short article 
on introduced plants ; an Appendix of nearly a dozen pages, filled 
with critical remarks or valuable notes concerning some of the 
plants mentioned in the body of the work ; four pages of additions 
and corrections ; an alphabetical index of the orders and genera ; 
and finally, another of the "more popular English names," brings 
the well-filled volume to its end.
It moreover contains a good map, 
showing the districts.
Notwithstanding the many details and the variety of the matter 
dealt with, one interesting feature of the * Middlesex Flora 1 is 
lacking, viz., a sketch of the progress of botanical investigation in 
the county.
This is to be regretted, as a chronological notice of the 
contributors to the botanical literature of Hants would have been 
of very great interest.
Particulars of their writings are, however, 
partly supplied by the list of the principal works quoted, which 
is a very full one.
Considering the area of the county is about 
1,032,105 acres, and that this surface is divided into 12 districts 
for the express purpose of tracing, so far as possible, all its plant 
species through them, the self-imposed task Mr. Townsend set 
himself to perform, and has now carried out, appears great 
indeed.
It is true that many of his quotations of previous records 
have been shorn of much of their interest and some of their value 
through being given in the form of mere names of places instead of 
in the exact and fuller words of the original writers ; but to have 
dealt otherwise with them, especially those from Dr. Bromfield's 
writings, would have added greatly to the size of the book and 
consequently to its price.
If it be of importance, as we consider it 
is, to know the " first record " for a plant in a given tract or at a 
certain spot, a practice which the author says he has sometimes 
followed must be open to objection, — that is if we are to understand 
him in the following words to assert an ignoring of any published 
records of plant-stations, in addition to some unrecorded manuscript 
ones privately furnished by correspondents or friends: "When I 
have myself," says Mr. Townsend, "also seen the plant in the 
locality, I have, unless the record be an old one or seem to require 
confirmation, allowed it to rest on my own authority alone." A 
regards the term " first record " he tells us this may be " a printed 
or written one, published or unpublished ; it may be the name of 
the finder, or of the author of a book, or it may be a dried specimen

preserved in a herbarium." We question the propriety of making 
11 first record " cover so many sources of information, and would 
restrict it ourselves to some published statement, though of course 
this would not involve a suppression of the other particulars.
The knowledge the author possesses as a critical botanist and 
man of learning, together with his literary ability, make his notes 
and remarks valuable and attractive paragraphs for study and 
reflection, and we feel sure portions of the work, the   Appendix ' 
especially, will be read and dwelt on by many botanists besides 
those interested specially in the flora of Hants.
Mr. Townsend calculates the number of Hampshire species at 
1114; inclusive of Rubi, Characea, and some other plants not 
reckoned by Mr. Watson in his enumeration of British species in 
Cyb. Brit.
iv.
pp.
499-519, and G.
C. B.
pp.
23-32.
Those contained 
in Mr. Watson's calculation he makes 1045 against the 1425 for the 
whole of Britain.
Three species of the M British type M are absent, 
Geranium sanguineum, Potentilla vema, and Cystoptens frayilis.
The 
species found only in Hants are Isnardia pahistris (formerly also in 
Sussex), Gladiolus illyHcus, Spartina alterni [flora, and the recently 
described Spartina Townsendi.
Since the last pages of the work 
were put in type a note added to the " additions" informs us that 
Ranunculus ophioylossif alius was found sparingly in a ditch west of 
Hythe, by Mr. H.
Groves, making an additional species peculiar to 
the county.* Those given as having their main range in the county, 
with the few plants named above, are Mathiola incana, Arctium 
intermedium Lange (in I.
of W.), Erythraa capitata, Calamintha 
sylvatica, Pidmonaria anyustifolia, and Spiranthes cestivalis.
Erythraa 
capitata was first distinguished by Mr. Townsend, who seems to 
have paid particular attention to the genus to which it belongs.
He names the Hampshire form, which occurs in both of the 
two botanical districts into which the I.
of Wight is divided, var.
sphcerocephala, and says: " Erythrcea capitata is a peculiarly in- 
teresting addition to the English Flora.
It is a well marked species, 
and is not known now to occur anywhere else in the world but in 
the I.
of Wight and in Sussex.
The other form of it was found 
some fifty years ago, somewhere in the neighbourhood of Berlin 
(the exact locality not being known), and though sought for dili- 
gently it has never been found again." Both the typical plant 
and the English variety are described in the Appendix,!
and two 
excellent plates, lithographed by Fitch, from drawings by the 
author, show various forms of the I.
of Wight plant and enrich the 
work.
These plates, which Mr. Townsend has kindly allowed to be 
used for this Journal, are issued with the piesent number.
Although the degree of frequency of a species in the county, as 
a whole, is usually given in some general way, as " common/' 
"not uncommon, " "rare," "local," &c, we miss the use of a 
Flora of Mid- 
species within 
graduated series of terms, like that employed in the   
dlesex,' to indicate the comparative frequency of each 
the whole area.

NOTICES OF BOOKS.
123 
A want of care to give quite accurately the periods of flowering 
of many species is certainly one of the defects of the book.
Surely 
Ran unc ulus Lenormandi and I!, hederaceus must open their flowers 
before June in Hants, since in Devon and Cornwall they are both 
in blossom in April, the former even in March.
Cochlearia danica 
quickly follows Draba verna and Cardamine hirsute in unfolding its 
petals, and only this spring we noticed some out before the middle 
of March, but under it appears M May- Aug.' ' Frayaria vesca, in 
the South of England, begins to flower six weeks or two months 
before May, though its blossoms for a considerable period in the 
spring seem never to produce fruit.
Our experience has been to 
find Veronica arvensis flowering during six months out of the twelve ; 
so certainly its blooming season cannot really be limited to July in 
Hants.
Veronica Biwbaumii will continue to open its flowers con- 
siderabty later than September, even after sharp frosty mornings 
have occurred.
Centunculus minimus is one of our latest annuals, 
as it flowers until the month of October.
The habitats named in the Flora cannot always have that 
exclusively local application desirable in a work of the kind.
For 
instance, under Epilobium lanceolatum we find " walls, roadsides, 
and other dry places, " though followed by the record of only ft 
single station for the whole county, and this a "raised hedgebank 
on right-hand side of road from Lrphook to Woolmer Forest." We 
would ourselves prefer the entire omission of statements of habitats, 
together with periods of flowering, from a local Flora, if not 
relating exclusively to the plants as species of the area embraced, and 
derived from careful observation therein.
We confess to having been startled at seeing some of the species 
inserted in the "List of plants, most of which have certainly and 
some probably been introduced by human agency, " and we have 
come to the conclusion that the author's views must be peculiar on 
the matter.
From our own point of view we should have accepted 
without question, as indigenous species, Sisymbrium officinale, 
Arabis Thaliana, Lychnis diurna, Armaria serpyllifolia, MaJva mos- 
chata, Geranium molle, Trifolium arvense, Potentilla reptans, Carduus 
arvensis, Arctium minus, Inula dysenterica, Convolvulus arvensis, Mentha 
arvensis, Rumex Acctosa, Allium rinca/e, and several others.
On the 
other hand, we should have either placed in the list some other 
species, or else marked them as possibly or certainly introduced, 
when treating of them in the body of the work.
Amongst them 
are JEgopodium Podayraria and Silybum Mariunum.
Having noticed 
what seem to us some blemishes in this work, we might, on the 
other hand, fill many pages with such valuable quotations from 
it as could not fail to make those reading them desirous of possess- 
ing a copy of the book for quiet perusal and study.
Mr. Town- 
send's careful observation is apparent in the remark under Ayrimonia 
odorata, " The furrows of the fruit extend to the spines," given as 
a mark of distinction between it and A.
Fupatoria.
The same nice 
observation is seen in the following extract : — " In its natural 
condition Erytkraa pidchella forms an open, much-branched panicle, 
branched from the base.
The root leaves are smaller than those 
124 NOTICES OF BOOKS.
produced later, and do no not form a rosette like all our other 
native species.' ' One of the paragraphs of the Appendix is on 
Oerastium viscosum, and in it Mr. Townsend tells us : — " An 
examination of authentic specimens of (J.
glutinosum, kindly com- 
municated by Prof.
Fries, has convinced me that his plant is 
identical with our C.
pusillum" Some remarks on Orchis incarnata, 
considered in connection with the recent paper of Mr. C.
B. Clarke, 
in Joum.
Linn.
Soe. xix., 206, are especially worthy of attention.
We have also a description of a supposed hybrid plant, named 
0. latifolio-maculata.
Under Carex (Ederi, we find the observation, 
"I have never found this plant either in England or on the Con- 
tinent, except on ground which has been covered by water during 
the winter and is left comparatively dry during summer.
Thus the 
favourite station for C (Ederi is on the margins of large pools or 
lakes/' Mr. Townsend now identifies the Glycerin plicata, var.
nana of his ' Contributions to a Flora of the Scilly Isles,' with G.
declinata Brebisson, Fl. Nom., ed.
3 and 4, and enters fully into 
particulars respecting it in the Appendix.
We have also a descrip- 
tion of a variety of Sclerochloa maritima Lind., which he has 
named riparia* 
An apparent desire to swell the number of the species for the 
county has led to the admission of some plants, Orchis hire hi a for 
instance, into its list on what would seem very slender evidence 
indeed.
Professor Babington's arrangement of the genus Rnbus is the 
one adopted, and Mr. J.
GL Baker's that for the genus Rosa.
Mr.
Townsend follows Babington in making Rubus ramosits Blox,, 
identical with, or a variety of, R.
imbricatns Hort.
We, however, 
feel confident the two are as distinct as are R.
Lindleiamts Lees, 
and R.
rhconnifolixis W.
& N.
The author of the ' Flora of Plymouth ' is curiously enough, 
though at the same time quite logically, given as the authority for 
11 first record " of Rnbus hirtifolms Mull.
& Wirt., for Isle of Wight, 
through his having been allowed by Professor Babington to print 
some remarks forwarded in a letter embodying the statement, 
" I have what seems to be the same [as the Plymouth plant] 
from Alborne, Sussex, and Apse Castle Wood, Isle of Wight." 
Fl. Plym., p.
117.
* Two other new varieties of well-known species are named and characterised 
as follows: — Lepidium Smithii, var.
b. alatostyla.
"An interesting var., with 
the pouch not notched, the brings being ndnate to the style throughout their 
length, has been found by Mr. J.
Groves in tolerable plenty, between the rifle- 
range at Millbrook and Redbridge." — Veronica arvensix, var.
b. eximia.
" Plant 
prostrate, branches simple from the base of the stem, upper leaves, bracts and 
sepals not exceeding the capsule.
A remarkable var., apparently constant under 
cultivation ; possibly V.arven*is f v&t.
perpurilla Bromf., from Isle of Wight (speci- 
mens are in Kew Herb.) belongs here.— -Sandy field west of Hengistbury Head, 
1879.
The var.
I have named eximia is a very distinct-looking plant; I have it 
under culture from seed, but it has not yet flowered.
The growth of the central 
stem seems to be arrested at an early stage, and branches are produced from the 
axils of the cotyledons and lower leaves, giving the young plant the appearance 
of a compact tuft."

Every British botanist who wishes to increase his knowledge 
concerning critical plants and varieties, should not fail to obtain a 
copy of the   Flora of Hampshire.' 
T. E.

The recently issued part of Dr. Just's invaluable ' Botaniseher 
Jahresbericht ' concludes the records of the year 1878.
The index 
of the species referred to in the two volumes for that year occupies 
nearly two hundred pages of three columns each.
Messrs.
Vilmorin, Andrieux & Cie. have issued, under the title 
* Plantes Potageres,' a handsome and fully illustrated volume 
devoted to the description and cultivation of the principal vegetables 
of temperate regions.
Although not strictly a botanical book, it 
contains a large amount of information which will be very useful, 
and indeed invaluable, to those who study the history and develop- 
ment of cultivated plants.
So much interest attaches just now to Madagascar botany, that 
it is worth while to direct attention to the Rev. J.
Sibree's very in- 
teresting volume entitled,   The Great African Island ' (Triibner k 
Co.).
It contains much information regarding the more striking 
characteristics of Madagascar vegetation, the economic applications 
of trees and* plants, &c.
While speaking of Madagascar botany we 
may note that a list of plants of some considerable length is to be 
found in a little-known work entitled,   A Voyage to Madagascar 
and the East Indies, by the Abbe Rochon ....
Translated from 
the French.
London, 1702.' The list is headed " Description 
of Trees, Shrubs and Plants, which grow in the northern part 
of Madagascar, and which I carried to the Isle of France in the 
end of the year 1768." The native names only are given, with 
notes on the uses of the plants, and it would probably in many 
cases be difficult to identify them.
The Fifth Annual Report of the Dulwich College Science 
Society (1882) contains a paper on the Botany of Dulwich, by 
Mr. S.
W. Carruthers, the Secretary of the Society.
It is entirely 
bibliographical, consisting of extracts dating from Merrett's 
'Pinax' (1666) to Brewer's 'Flora of Surrey' (1863).
Mr.
Carruthers says that Dulwich " can still put in its claims to a 
flora M ; and we hope he will give us in the next Report a list of the 
plants which still hold their ground there.
South African botanists have reason to be grateful to Messrs.
MacOwan and Bolus, for the botanical portion of the ' Catalogue 
of Printed Books and Papers relating to South Africa," which has 
just been issued by the South African Philosophical Society, in the 
form of a pamphlet of 77 pages.
Not only are separate works, 
dealing entirely or partially with South African plants, included, 
but a large number of papers in periodicals are indexed (under the 
authors' names), with, in many cases, brief but extremely useful 
notes by the compilers.
We should be glad to see a similar work 
undertaken for British botany.
The only point to which we could 
1 6 ARTICLES IN JOURNALS.
take exception would be the citation of the new series of this 
Journal (1872-1882) as "Trim, Journ.

in strict accuracy applies only to the volumes for 1880-1882.

convenient, as it is the most accurate, mode of citation.
The ' Proceedings of the Linnean Society ' from November 
1880 to June 1882 has been issued during the past month.
We 
are glad to learn that so useful a record, the temporary abandon- 
ment of which we always regretted, will be again issued regularly.

The two Carices here figured are selected from the large number 
of novelties which have been lately received from Madagascar, to 
illustrate how closely allied to British types are many of the species 
from the high levels of the centre of the island.
They were both 
gathered recently by the Eev. R.

which reaches an elevation of nearly 10,000 feet above sea-level.

A CHINESE CLETHRA.
By H.
F. Hance, Ph.D., F.L.S.
The genus Cletkra, comprising about twenty-five species, is 
divided into two groups of very unequal extent.
The first, with 
persistent foliage, and containing the great majority, is distributed 
from Mexico towards the southern extremity of the North American 
continent, through the different states of South America and the 
West India Islands, as far to the south as Brazil on the tropic, and 
Northern Chili ; whilst there is besides a solitary outlying species 
in Madeira.
Of the other, deciduous -leaved group, but four species 
have hitherto been known, two from the United States, another 
from Japan, and a fourth from the higher regions of some of the 
islands of the Malay Archipelago.
To these I am now enabled to 
add a fifth, from the mountains of Kwang-tung, of which I subjoin 
a brief diagnosis.

CINCHONA LEDGER!
ANA.
i 
By Henry Trimen, M.B., F.L.S.
With 
Kuntze, printed in the January number (pp.
5-9), it does not seem 
necessary to do more than controvert the two statements upon 
which his hybridity-theory is based.
Firstly.
On p.
6 it is said " C Ledgmana originated spon- 
taneously in the Government plantations of Mungpo in Sikkini"; 
and " Mr. Gammie and the late Mr. Biermann assured me that 
1 C.
Ledgeriana had originated spontaneously there in the Calisaya- 
field.' " To settle this it seemed best to write direct to Mr. Gammie 
on the subject, and this is what he replies (20 Feb., 1883): — 
" Dr. Kuntze must have one of our hybrids in his mind's eye, and 
not Ledgeriana, as having originated spontaneously in the Calisaya- 
field at Mungpo.
Certainly I never told him so of Ledgeriana " ; 
and he further adds, " You are quite right in thinking that all our 
Ledgerianas originated from the smallpacketof Ledger's S.
American 
seed I got from the Nilgiris in the early part of 1866 ; and Moens 
is equally right in stating that I have never seen it from any other 
source.
So that the Sikkini experience of it is identical with that 
of Java." This is conclusive, and I think it is pretty clear that if 
Dr. Kuntze ever knew C.
Ledgeriana he does not know it now.
Secondly.
Dr. Kuntze states (p.
7) " C.
Ledgeriana is the only 
Cinchona that suffers from sterility, and only ripens more fruits if 
it gets fertilized and hybridized by other Cinchonas ; that happens 
often, and therefore the descendants of Ledgeriana are mostly 
degenerated," &c.
This being a practical matter I have requested 
the opinion of several Cinchona-growers upon it, and I now give 
some portions of a letter (30 Jan., 1883) from Mr. T.
N. Christie, 
who is a very trustworthy observer, and possesses one of the finest 
plantations of C.
Ledgeriana in Ceylon.
He says, " I find Ledgeriana 
loth to blossom compared with officinalis or ( <t!imya 9 but in no way 
sterile.
Climate and seasons affect the blossoming very greatly.
The Yarrow Ledgers had a prolonged drought in 1881, many of 
them drooped and partially withered, and as a result were covered 
with seed the following season, so much so that many of the branches 
had to be propped up to bear the weight of the fruit.
Last year 
they had a wet season and as a result they have not this year one 
third of their last crop.
There is no sterility about the blossom 
when it comes ; I find it comes perfectly true from seed.'' This is 
our experience throughout Ceylon ; the species flowers later in life 
than the others, is quite as fertile as other kinds, and when pro- 
tected from cross-fertilization and carefully collected the seed is 
remarkably true.
The contention of this species being a hybrid is thus a singularly 
unfortunate one ; it is I think also much to be regretted that such 
unfounded and careless statements as those of Dr. Kuntze's should 
have been published.
Further acquaintance with more and older 
1(32 FLORA OF THE UPPER TAMAR AND NEIGHBOURING DISTRICTS, 
trees since the date of my former paper (Nov. 1881) has confirmed 
my opinion of the speciiic distinctness of ( '.
Ledgeriana from 
C. Calisa?/a, and its " great variability" exists only in Dr. Kuntze's 
imagination.
In conclusion, I wish 
that there are no C.
Led 
the 
descended from Mr. Ledger's seed from the Kio Mamore ; the 
species is doubtless a very scarce one, and has not up to the present 
been re -discovered in S.
America.

140 
VARIATION IN NEW ZEALAND FERNS.
By H.
C. Field.
I have thought that the following notes respecting our New 
Zealand Ferns may interest some of those who give attention to 
that class of plants, and particularly to those who seem disposed to 
regard slight differences as sufficient to constitute new varieties.
The differences in the same ferns are surprising, and in some 
localities they seem to occur in different ways from those observed 
in others.
In England they seem to run in the directions of 
cresting or depauperisation, while here they are rather in colour, 
and particularly in variegation and in texture.
During more than 
thirty years' residence, spent mostly in the bush, I have never met 
with a crested New Zealand Fern, and only once or twice with 
depauperated ones ; while variegations of yellow, crimson, and 
copper-colour are very common ; and hardly any two plants are 
exactly alike in texture and character of foliage.
But one of the 
most striking differences is the tendency which many of them have 
to occur in creeping and non-creeping forms.
Xephrodium decom- 
position, for instance, creeps rapidly, and soon covers a large space 
of ground ; while its var.
(/label!
ton will never spread six inches, 
and is usually a tufted plant.
A r .
hispidum again occurs in the two 
forms, and occasional plants of N m velutinum creep to some extent.
V. Thelypteris seems always to creep, but some plants do so far 
more than others.
Most of our Lomarias exhibit the same pe- 
culiarity, and some plants of one (L.
rulcanica) send up single 
fronds at intervals from a creeping rhizome, while others produce 
caudices with tufted crowns in the same way.
Some plants of 
Davallia again creep rapidly from the time that the first fronds 
appear, while others will take many years to travel beyond the 
margin of a six-inch pot; and in one part of the colony (Tuhua) 
this fern occurs as a distinctly-tufted plant, and in large specimens 
develops a stout conical caudex like that of the Todeas.
These 
peculiarities are of consequence in selecting plants for cultivation, 
and great difference of opinion exists among our New Zealand 
fernists as to how far they should be regarded as constituting new 
varieties, particularly as there is sufficient difference in the foliage 
to enable the kinds to be at once distinguished.
The foliage of the 
creeping Davallia is wiry, and the frond rarely more than a foot 
high and of ovate-lanceolate form ; while the non-creeping one is 
often three feet high, with triangular fronds and thin texture.
The tufted one, however, has a wiry frond, scarcely distinguishable 
from that of the creeping plant.
The variation of the foliage is in 
fact far less than occurs in different plants of what no one disputes 
as the same fern — as for instance, Asplmium bulbiferum, which 
ranges from merely pinnate, with entire or barely indented edges, 
to tripinnate, with deep narrow lobes like those of A.
Colensui, and 
from a harsh texture almost like that of A.
flaccidum, so that it is 
often difficult to class the plant, to thin and plumose forms.
A.Jiaccidum again varies greatly, some plants appearing like merely 
A SYNOPSIS OF THE GENUS SELAG1NELLA.
141 
enlarged specimens of the English mountain spleenwort, while 
others have broad oval or triangular pinnse.
Some forms of it also 
creep considerably, and produce fresh tufts along the rhizomes, 
whilst the great majority never do so.
Some forms of A.
obtusatum 
again propagate themselves in the same way, and there is a great 
difference in plants of A.
wnbromm in the same respect, as well as 
in the character and colour of the foliage.
As a rule, non-creeping 
forms have broader thinner foliage than creeping ones.
In fact, if 
the various peculiarities of our New Zealand Ferns sufficed to 
constitute separate varieties, we should require thousands of names 
to designate the whole of them, and should have to be constantly 
adding to the list as fresh forms appeared or were noticed.
A 
slight difficulty in classing occasional plants is, to my mind, a far 
less evil than this would be ; and the more so as, even now, many 
persons are deterred from studying our ferns by the difficulty which 
they experience in recollecting the names of the several kinds.
It 
is a great pity that so many of our ferns are being destroyed, 
through the country being cleared and brought into cultivation.
Some kinds, formerly tolerably plentiful here, are no longer to be 
found at all, the places where they grew being now under grass or 
crop, and no doubt this evil will increase as time goes on ; and 
therefore anything which deters people from cultivating, and so 
saving, the plants is to be deprecated.

ON CUDRANIA TRILOBA Hance, AND ITS USES 
IN CHINA.
By Francis Black well Forbes, F.L.S.
Dr. Hance first described Cudrania triloba in the ' Journal of 
Botany,' 1868, p.
49, from a specimen gathered in the interior of 
Shantung Province, North China, and amended his description 
later (Journ.
Bot. 1876, p.
365), after Mr. Swinhoe had sent him 
specimens from Chefoo, also in Shantung.
In 1877 I myself fotmd 
the plant on the Feng-wang Hills, near Shanghai (Kiangsou Pro- 
vince), and Dr. Hance made the following note on one of the 
specimens which he kindly determined for me : — 4< An unfortunate 
specific name, as the foliage seems very variable." 
This remark is abundantly justified by the numerous specimens 
which I have since then collected at various places in the Shanghai 
district, as well as at Chefoo.
The typical form is distinctly trilobate, 
with the central lobe sometimes twice as long as the lateral ones ; 
but frequently unlobed leaves of varied outlines are also found on 
the same specimen.
As far as I have been able to observe, the 
three-lobed forms occur principally in younger low-trailing plants, 
which also seem to be more spiny than the taller shrubs found in 
the same localities.
As the plant grows, the tendency seems 
towards larger and entire leaves, with at the most an indistinct or 
irregular lobing, their general form comprising many variations 
between oblong and lanceolate, or even (more rarely j obovate and

The growing shrub is easily recognised, notwith-

one who looks at a series for the first time.

who has published in the   Actes de la Societe Linneenne de Bor- 
deaux' "Florules" of both places, does not seem to have met with 
it himself at either.
He quotes, however, in a supplement to his 
11 Florule de Tchefou" Dr. Hance's above-mentioned notice of Mr.
Swinhoe's specimens, adding that in all the specimens of C.
triloba 
in M.
Franchet's herbarium, which came from Kiangsou, the 
leaves are "obliquement ovales." But it is difficult to see how 
the leaves even of any single specimen of this plant could be 
defined in M.
Debeaux's words, or in any others equally simple.
I venture to add here a description of this species somewhat 
fuller than that which the material at the disposal of its eminent 
author enabled him to give originally.

This plant has an economic interest specially on account of the 
use made of it by the Chinese in feeding silkworms.
In May, 1881, 
M. Brunat, a French gentleman, who had gone to the silk- districts 
to purchase cocoons for the firm in which I was a partner, wrote to 
me in Shanghai from Wu-sieh (Kiangsou Province) about the 
rumoured complaints of a scant supply of mulberry-leaves.
He 
stated, however, that he anticipated no deficiency of food for the 
silkworms in that (the Taysaam) district, as he was informed that 
they could be reared partly on leaves gathered from certain wild 
shrubs of the neighbourhood.
He could not himself give a name 
ON CUDRANIA TRILOBA AND ITS USES IN CHINA.
147 
to these, but said that they certainly "n'avaient aucun rapport 
avec le murier." At my request he brought back to Shanghai good 
specimens of the shrub, which I at once recognised as >clrania 
triloba.
All were apparently from one plant, with rounded or oval 
leaves, hardly at all lobed, the female capitula in young flower with 
exserted styles.
The Chinese name for M.
Brunat's specimens, given me by a 
native of the silk-districts, was cha-shu, while a small tree of the 
same species growing near my house in the Shanghai suburbs was 
named by my Chinese gardener poh-hsi.
Local plant-names vary 
greatly in China, but, apart from this, neither of my informants 
would have liked to appear unable to answer my questions, so that 
I attach little value to the information in either case.
My own 
conviction is that my specimens are to be referred to the che, 
nu-che, or shift tree, the notices of which in standard Chinese works 
have long been a puzzle to botanists.
For the following indication of references to this plant I am 
indebted to two papers published by Dr. Bretschneider in the early 
part of 1881.* I may remark that part of the difficulty in tracing 
the che tree has doubtless arisen from its comparison in the Chinese 
works about to be quoted with the tsoh tree, which Dr. Hancet has 
identified with Quercus mongoUca Fisch., and from the fact that the 
venerable sinologue, Dr. S.
Wells Williams, misled by this com- 
parison, calls the che tree (Chinese Diet.
p. 39) " the silkworm oak 
of China." 
The 'Pen-tsao-kang-mu,' xxxvi., pp.
9, 10, 11, gives long 
descriptions of the che and the nu-che, the following abstract of 
which has been kindly prepared by my friend Mr. Donald Spence, 
of H.
B. M.
Consular Service : 
11 Native authorities state that the che prefers stony ground, and 
the tsoh hilly arable land.
Hence it is that the etymological 
meaning of the character che is " stone-tree." The che wood is 
streaked inside, and may be worked on the turning-lathe into small 
articles.
Its leaves are used for feeding silkworms, but it is also 
said that its leaves are hard and not so good as the mulberry.
According to another author, the che abounds everywhere among 
the hills, having leaves of a thick texture, round, terminating in a 
point.
Silkworms are fed on these, and the silk so produced is 
employed in making lute-strings which give a clearer sound than 
the ordinary ones.
Another author says that bowmen use this 
wood to tip their bows with ; and that the tree affords a reddish 
yellow dye, called the che yellow, which is used for the imperial 
garments.
It is elsewhere stated that chS wood, to which has been 
applied a paste made of coal-dust and vinegar, can be dyed black in 
a single night.
11 The nu-che grows in the wild hilly country of Eiangnan.
It 
resembles the che tree, and has thorned nodes and persistent

leaves.
Another writer says that the nu-che is like the che, but 
smaller ; and that its leaves, which resemble those of the tsoh, but 
are not so large, are used for feeding silkworms." 
Both the che and the nu-che, according to the ' Pen-tsao-kang-mu,' 
have medicinal properties, but it is needless to quote here the 
detailed instructions for administering preparations of them to 
women troubled with constipation, flatulence, &c.
M. Isidore Hedde, in a report* published in 1848, says as 
follows, quoting partly from a translation from the   Imperial 
Cyclopaedia of Chinese Agriculture,' made by M.
Stanislas Julien : — 
" The tche shou or tche tree is celebrated in China for feeding 
the silkworms called "compagnards." It is a low tree with small 
leaves, rough to the touch, and in outline round terminating in a 
point ; the brandies bear spines, whence it is sometimes called the 
tse-tsang, or thorny mulberry.
The fruit, called Kia, resembles 
pepper.
The leaves of the tche tree are alternate and numerous.
The stem is slender and straight.
The leaves are thick.
An 
interval of a year must be allowed between two gatherings of 
leaves, otherwise they would contain properties noxious to the 
silkworms.
11 The tche tree grows everywhere in the north.
Its wood is 
hard and solid.
Its bark is covered with fine serrated lines which 
bear a great number of white spines.
Its leaves resemble those of 
the mulberry, but they are smaller and thinner.
Their colour is 
of a pale yellow ; the extremity is triangular.
They are excellent 
for feeding silkworms.
There is a variety of the tche tree, called 
the 71011- tche." 
The two plants are also figured in the ' Chi-wu-ming,' vol.
xxxv., which I have examined at the British Museum, folio 46 
being a drawing of the che and folio 27 of the nu-che.
Both 
drawings are very characteristic in their rendering of the various 
forms of leaves, and a comparison with my specimens of Cudrania 
triloba shows beyond doubt that both represent this species.
It is 
stated briefly in the Chinese text that the che leaves can be used as 
food for silkworms, that the wood yields a yellow dye, and that the 
wild form, or nu-che, is a small shrub.
This latter is said to grow 
in Kiangsi Province, having prickles and large triangular leaves.
The plates in the ' Chi-wu-ming ' show very little difference 
between the che and the nu-che, except that the latter has spines ; 
and it may be inferred from the annexed descriptions that the che 
is cultivated, since the nu-che is spoken of as a tvild variety.
Among my own specimens of C.
triloba are some taken from two 
small trees (male and female) which, with thousands of the ordinary 
native trees and shrubs, had been set out by the Foreign Municipal 
Council of Shanghai along their main suburban road.
The leaves 
of these are larger and thicker than in the wild specimens, and are 
generally entire, though with slight lobings near the tips of a few, 
and with all the other varieties of form which characterise the 
species.
Mr. Carruthers, who has examined all my specimens, is 
* " Description methodique des produits divers receuillis dans un voyage en 
Chine," par Isidore Hedde.
Chambre de Commerce, St. Etienne, 1848.
ON CUDRANIA TRILOBA AND ITS USES IN CHINA.
149 
inclined to separate this form from C.
triloba Hance, but I cannot 
help thinking that the greater luxuriance of the whole plant may 
fairly be accounted for by its having exchanged its home on the 
thin soil of the Kiangsou hill- sides for the rich alluvial earth of the 
Yangtze delta, where it has been long cultivated.
There is in the 
Herbarium of the British Museum a corresponding specimen, 
collected by Sir George Staunton in 1793, in the western part of 
Shantung Province.
Lord Macartney's embassy, to which Staunton 
was attached, traversed this province only along the line of the 
Grand Canal through an alluvial country, and there is therefore 
reason to suppose that his specimens were, like my own, gathered 
from a cultivated tree.
I may add that my own observations have 
not enabled me to detect any differences between the wild and 
cultivated forms, as regards either flowers or fruits.
In the very valuable series of reports on silk-production issued 
by the Inspector- General of Chinese Maritime Customs in 1881, 
M. Kleinwachter, Commissioner at Chinkiang (Kiangsou) alludes 
to the che or shih tree, which, following Dr. Williams, he calls 
" the silkworm oak of China/ 7 His information is evidently 
gathered entirely from Chinese works, and the two drawings 
appended to his report are by no means as faithful as those in the 
'Chi-wu-ming,' to which I have already referred.
M. Isidore Hedde states in the paper above quoted that he had 
brought to France a growing tche tree, which had been obtained for 
him by a missionary in Chusan, but the plant perished before 
reaching Paris.
I may here note that I saw last year, at the 
Jardin des Plantes, in Paris, a growing Oudrania triloba, about ten 
feet high, which, if my memory serves me, had been sent from 
Shanghai.
Its leaves appeared to be generally entire, or only 
obscurely lobed.
As further bearing on the identity of the che tree with Dr.
Hance 1 s species, some Chinese writers describe the che fruit as 
resembling a mulberry, which the fruit of C.
triloba certainly does.
By others the che seeds are said to be like pepper.
In all the 
specimens I have examined the seeds are straw-coloured or light 
brown, so that this comparison seems to require some stretch of 
imagination, unless indeed the appearance of the seeds changes at a 
later stage.
Finally, Eumphius (Herb.
Amboin.
V., p.
24) has 
described the Javanese Cudrania as furnishing a yellow dye ; and 
on the theory of the che tree being a species of the same genus, it is 
not surprising to find it used by the Chinese for the same purpose.
There is, it must be admitted, a certain vagueness in all the 
Chinese descriptions, which tempts one to think that the same 
plant which had been taken by one author as the che tree may have 
been referred by another to the nu-che.
As regards the economical 
value of the species, the further most important question remains 
to be studied of how far the che leaves are restricted by the Chinese 
to the rearing of the wild varieties of the silkworm, and to what 
extent they may actually be employed in producing the Wusieh 
cocoons, the excellent quality of which is well known to the silk- 
trade,

SHORT NOTES.
Saxifraga pedatifida Sm. as a British Plant.
— This species is 
one that has long been on the border-land of doubtful natives.
Babington admits it in his earlier editions on the authority of Don 
from Clova and Wynne from Achill Island; but subsequently 
excludes it as probably of garden origin.
Hooker relegates it to 
the " excluded species." Looking recently over a long-neglected 
parcel of duplicates in my herbarium, I found about a dozen 
specimens with this name, labelled as having been gathered in 
Achill Island in 1853 by the late Mr. W.
Andrews.
They were 
placed along with a number of other Saxifrages, all from the west 
of Ireland; and were undoubtedly given to my father by that 
gentleman, who used frequently to bring him Irish rarities.
On 
comparing the plant with the type specimens, with the assistance 
of Mr. J.
G. Baker, there was no doubt about referring it to this 
species ; it appears to belong to the form S.
ceratophylla of Aiton, 
distinguished by its rosette of somewhat rigid leaves.
I have 
placed specimens in the National Herbaria at South Kensington 
and Kew. The distribution of the plant on the continent is very

On the Etymology of Vincetoxicum.
— In the admirably clear 
and concise   North American Flora,' of which it is to be hoped a 
further portion may shortly be issued, I notice that Dr. Gray gives 
the derivation of Vincetoxicum as "from vineeus, that which serves 
for binding, and toxicum, a poison, i.
e., poisonous bindweed."* 
But this is surely a quite untenable etymology, as a reference to 
the few works of the Fathers which I am able to consult in my far- 
off home appears conclusively to show.
Leonhart Fuchs, writing 
of the plant, in 1542, uses these words: " Ao-xTwnxs Graecis, 
Asclepias Latinis, herbariis Hirundinaria, officinis Vincetoxicum, 
Germanis Schvvalbenvvurtz, Gallis autem Domte venin appellator.
Vincetoxicum vel rectuis mcnro^Kov, haud dubie dicta 
est quod illi insignis ad versus venena vis sit."f In 1554, Matthiolus 
says of it : " Vis eis magna ex toluis similitudine substantias 
adversus omnia venena, unde illi nomen."{ Dodon^eus also, in 
1583, remarks : " Facilitate autem Vincetoxici radices calidse sunt 
et sicca* : venenis adversari creduntur"; § whilst, at the same date, 
Caesalpinus says: " Quidam hodie Vincetoxicum vocant, quia 
venena depellit."|| As to vineeus, the fact appears to be that an 
unscholarly copyist, transcribing Plautus, misread the line, 
11 Nam mihi jam intus potione juncea onerabo gulam,"1F 
and thus unwittingly endowed the Latin tongue with a word of his 
own creation.
It occurs nowhere else in classical literature, and 
the Mai correct reading, given in the celebrated codex discovered 
by Cardinal in the Ambrosian library at Milan, is adopted by all 
recent editors.
The above considerations will, I believe, establish 
beyond contest that the true etymology is from vincere and toodcum.

Worcestershire Plants.
— I am desirous of forming a Her- 
barium exclusively of Worcestershire plants, specimens of both 
common and rare species, with their varieties, being wanted from 
the four botanical districts (see ' The Botany of Worcestershire,' by 
Mr. Edwin Lees).
At present I do not propose to collect any 
cryptogamous orders, excepting those enumerated in the London 
Catalogue, 7th ed.
; viz., Filices, Lycopodiaceae, Marsileaceae, 
Equisetacese, and Characeae.
My own specimens chiefly represent 
the Malvern District, and to those botanists who collect in other 
parts of the county I should feel much obliged for assistance in 
forming the collection, which, I need hardly say, while in my pos- 
session, would be at the service of any who might wish to consult it.
I should of course be pleased to supply, as far as I could, the wants 
of others from the plants of this neighbourhood.
I should add 
that there are many Malvern and Teme Valley plants I also should 
be very glad of.

Die Usher bekannten Furopaischen Characeen.
By P.
Sydow.
B erlin, 
1882.
8vo, 104 pp.
For many years the late Prof.
A. Braun was collecting 
materials for a Monograph of the Characem, but unfortunately did 
not live to complete it.
His notes, however, have fallen into most 
competent hands, and the present volume, under the editorship 
of Dr. Nordstedt, is the most important work that has appeared on 
the order.
It is especially useful as clearing up Braun* s work, and 
describing, or settling down, the very large number of plants to 
which he has given manuscript names in public herbaria.
The classification is mainly the same as that adopted in the 
Author's previous works ; the number of genera has however been 
increased to five.
Under Xitella 70 species are included, of which 
17 are here described for the first time, viz.: — monodactyla, poly- 
gyra, glomerulifera, prcelonga, remota, Jtobertsoni, dispersa, pseiulo- 
flabellata, capitellata, pygnuBa, Asagrayana (Nordst.), microglochin, 
conglobata, diffusa, polycephula, trichotoma and Lechleri.
Under Toly- 
pella there are 8 species, of which longicoma, apiculata and californica 
are new.
Lamprothamnus consists of only one species, alopecuroides 
(formerly included under Lychnothamnus).
Lychnothamnus includes 
3 species, stelliger (formerly under Char a), macropogon and barbatus.
Chara includes 60 species, of which 11 are described for the first 
NOTICES OF BOOKS.

time, viz.
: — Wallichii, succincta, Leptopitys, Grijfithii, psilopitys, 
Thwaitesii, nudifolla, Schaffneri, altaica, infirma and leptosperma, 
making in all 142 species.
Some of these are stated as subspecies, 
but as they are not included under other species, and are numbered 
separately, and in all other respects treated as species, we think 
they must be intended to rank as such.
The new genus Lamprothamnas is based on the relative position 
of the globule and nucule, the former being above the latter, 
whereas in Lychnothamnus they are side by side.
The removal 
of Char a obtusa (C.
stelligera Bauer) to the genus Lychnothamnus is 
an important step, based upon Dr. Nordstedt's investigation of the 
development of the globule and nucule.
There are seven plates containing 273 figures, principally 
illustrating the new species.
Dr. Nordstedt has added a key, which 
will no doubt prove very useful.
A chapter is devoted to problems 
and queries, which contains suggestions of some of the important 
questions to be solved in relation to the order.
The information as 
to the geographical distribution is a great advance on that previously 
published.
There can be no doubt that this work is the result of 
an immense amount of investigation and very careful editing.
Dr. Sydow's work contains descriptions of the European 
Characea, with synonyms, and with localities for some of the rarer 
species, prefaced by a chapter on structure.
It may prove useful 
to those who have not copies of Braun's and Nordstedt's papers, 
but it seems to contain little that is original, and following so 
closely after the publication of Braun's ' Fragmented it is noticeable 
that the systematic portion is little more than a compilation from 
the matter relating to the European species in that work and in 
Braun's account in ' Krypt.
Flor.
Schlesien.' The information as 
to distribution, which we think should be an important feature in a 
work dealing only with a limited area, is very incomplete, judging 
from that relating to our own plants : thus C.
ceratophylla (C tomen- 
tosa) y C.
baltica and C.
fray if era are not recorded for Great Britain 
at all ; C.
polyacantha is given for England, but not for Scotland or 
Ireland ; IV.
translucens is not given for Scotland, and Tolypella 
glomerata and T.
intricate are not noted for Ireland, while N.
syn- 
carpa is recorded for England without locality or authority.
The 
synonymy is very extensive, apparently for the most part copied from 
Braun, but is far from complete ; we find, for instance, that under 
Lamprothamnus alopecuroides, the most important synonym, Lychno- 
thamnus alopecuroides is omitted, whereas, under the same species, 
Braun has been followed in quoting seven utterly useless manu- 
script names.

We have received the   Eeport of an exploration of parts ot 
Wyoming, Idaho, and Montana ' made by Lieut.-Gen, P.H. Sheridan 
in the autumn of last year.
A list of the plants collected is added, 
in which we notice a new Gentian [Gentiana Forwoodii A.

Dr. J.
Croumbie Brown has compiled a readable little volume 
entitled   The Forests of England and the management of them in 
bye-gone times ' (Edinburgh : Oliver & Boyd).
We have received the ' Boletim Annual ' for 1880-1882, issued 
by the Sociedade Broteriana (Coimbra, 1883).
It contains a 
localised list of the plants distributed by the Society, to which are 
added critical notes on some of the more interesting, with des- 
criptions of Pulicaria microcephala Lange, and Andryala Ficalheana 
Daveau, species new to science.
Under the title * Timehri,' the Eoyal Agricultural and Commer- 
cial Society of New Guinea is issuing a half-yearly journal, Mr.
E. F.
im Thurn being editor.
In the second number, Mr. G.
S. 
Jenman has some useful   Remarks on the Aspect and Flora of the 
Kaieteur Savannah ' ; and there is also a letter from Dr. Schom- 
burghk of Adelaide, giving some interesting autobiographical details.
Mr. William Trelease sends us a reprint from the Proceedings 
of the Boston Society of Nat. History of his paper " On the struc- 
tures which favour cross-fertilization in several plants." A large 
number of observations upon numerous species are recorded, those 
upon Lemna minor being especially interesting.
Under the title   Wild Flowers of Switzerland, 1 Messrs.
Samp- 
son Low and Co. have issued a handsome large quarto volume 
containing sixteen coloured groups of alpine flowers.
Although 
not strictly botanical, the book will be useful to the many who wish 
to ascertain the names of the more striking plants met with in 
their rambles among the Alps.
The flowers have been painted 
natural size, from living plants ; each species stands out clearly, 
and the colouring is very careful.
Each group is accompanied by 
an outline sketch, from which the names may be readily ascertained.
NOTICES OF BOOKS.

The letterpress, as far as it goes, is accurate ; and the book is above 
the average of such works.
The authoress, Mrs. Ward, modestly 
conceals her name under the initials   H.
C. W.' 
Messrs.
Cassell have re-issued, at a very low price considering 
the goodness of the book, the adaptation of Figuier's ' Vegetable 
World' for which Mr. Dyer is understood to be responsible, and 
which, as might be expected from this fact, is an exceedingly useful 
little volume.
We reviewed it at some length in this Journal for 1872 
(pp.
347-349), and need not do more now than endorse the favourable 
opinion there expressed.
We note that certain small errors have 
been corrected.
For the general reader it is a very useful volume, 
and the numerous and beautiful illustrations make it a very 
attractive one.

" On the Structure, Development, and Life-history of a tropical 
epiphyllous Lichen/' by H.
Marshall Ward.
The author's observa- 
tions lead him to believe that the epiphyllous cryptogam in question 
supports the view that a Lichen is a compound organism composed 
of an Alga on which an ascomycetous fungus has become more or 
less intimately affixed and dependent.
It is developed on the 
leaves of many plants, but it has been more closely watched on 
Michelia furcata.
The Lichen presents four types, — orange-red 
stellate patches, greyish green blotches, clear grey spots, and white 
shining circles, — but these pass imperceptibly into one another, and 
vary in size from a speck to a quarter of an inch in diameter.
The reddish spots of the earlier stages is an Alga, of which the 
radiating filaments are in part reproductive organs and in part 
barren hairs ; it subsequently passes into the grey and green stages 
and by a modification of growth the invasion of a fungus mycelium 
succeeds.
The white matrix of the complete Lichen consists of 
the same algal thallus invested by dense masses of the fungus 
hyphae, which produce black dots, viz., the fruit-bodies.
The author 
describes in detail the peculiarities of growth and reproduction of 
the Alga and fungus, and formation of the Lichen.
He alludes to 
and criticises Dr. Cunningham's account of Mycoidea parasitica, 
which latter is evidently closely related to that described by himself.
Assuming that Mycoidea and Ward's Alga are generically the 
same, either Cunningham discovered a female organ of reproduction, 
which becomes fertilized and produces zoospores, or he confounded 
this with fertile hair-organs.
As regards the systematic position of 
the Algae, a comparison with Colcechceta suggests that there is very 
little in common, beyond mode of growth, of the disk-like thallus 
and the production of zoospores from certain cells.
The genus 
Chroolepus, moreever, presents features which agree in several 
important points, viz., orange-red oily cell-contents, habitat, 
production of zoospores in ovoid cells developed terminally and 
laterally.
The structure of the thallus and relative positions of the 
main masses of fungal and algal portions agree with what occurs in 
heteromerous crustaceous Lichens, as Graphidea ; but the peri- 
thecia indicate an angiocarpous alliance, bringing this form nearer 
such families as Pertu&aria and Vernwaria, to the latter of which 
it may ultimately be referred.

butions to the Flora of Madagascar." This includes descriptions of 
the new Incomplete and Monocotyledons contained in the col- 
lections lately received from the Eev. E.
Baron and Dr. Gr.
W. 
Parker.
The only new genus is a Balanophorad much resembling 
in habit a compound Spharia, which Sir J.
D. Hooker proposes to 
cell Cephalopkyton, but of which the material is still incomplete.
A large number of the new species belong to widely spread tropical 
genera, such as Ficus, Loranthus, Croton, Aca/ypha, and Peperomia.
In Lauracea, an order hitherto feebly represented in the island, 
there are several novelties.
Types characteristic of the Cape and 
mountain regions of Central Africa are represented by Faurea, 
Peddiea, Dais, Kniphojia, and Dipcadij one species each, and by 
three Aristeas and four Aloes.
The Dipcadi is curious because, as 
in an Angolan species gathered by Welwitsch, the tails of the three 
upper segments grow longer and longer in the upper flowers of the 
raceme, till at the top the lamina is entirely absorbed.
Of endemic 
types there are three new Obetias and two Tambourissas.
The 
Bamboo of the forests of Imerina, now received from Dr. Parker 
for the first time in flower, proves to be the same species that is 
common in the interior of Bourbon.
Of novelties nearly allied to 
north temperate types there are three species of Bromiis, one of 
Stipa, and two Carices from the Ankaratra mountains, one near to 
divisa and the other to ampullacea* A plant not in flower, with 
curious compound phyllocladia, is probably an Exocarpus allied to 
the Norfolk Island E.
phyllanthoides .
There is a third species of 
the new Alismaceous genus Weisneria, hitherto known in India and 
Central Africa ; and a new species of Centratherim, a genus of 
grasses hitherto confined to India and China.
Mr. C.
B. Clarke 
has contributed a complete synopsis, with synonyms, of the species 
of Cyperas known in Madagascar and the neighbouring islands.
Mr. G.
Murray read a paper " On the outer Peridium of Broomeia 
congregata." This gasteromycetous fungus, which is nearly related 
to Geaster, consists of a mass of individuals closely seated together 
on a corky stroma.
These individuals have been found up till now 
with only one peridium, and the Eev. M.
J. Berkeley, who first 
described the plant in 1844, treated the stroma as the homologue 
of an outer peridium.
Mr. Murray has found on some specimens 
brought from Dammara-land by Mr. T.
C. Een a true outer 
peridium common to all the individuals.
From an examination of 
it he is able to throw light on the mode of development of this 
fungus.
— Mr. W.
B. Hemsley read a communication, " On the 
synonymy of Didymoplexis, and on the elongation of the pedicel in 
1>.
pollens" The latter saprophytic Orchid is widely scattered in 
Tropical Asia, though apparently nowhere very common.
At the 
time of flowering the pedicels are shorter than the flowers, which 
are less than half an inch long; but afterwards they elongate, 
sometimes as much as a foot.
The object seems to be to carry the 
ripening fruit clear of the wet decaying vegetable matter in which 
the plant grows.

IN MEMOEY OF GEOBGE STACEY GIBSON, F.L.S.
By G.
S. Boulger, F.L.S.
(With Portrait.) 
That critical knowledge of local floras, which seems to become 
rarer as a general knowledge of Botany becomes more common, has 
sustained a serious loss in the death of George Stacey Gibson, 
which occurred on April 5-th.
Mr. Gibson was born on July 20th, 1818, at Saffron Walden, 
the small town in the north-western corner of the county of Essex, 
in which he.
spent most of his life, and which he enriched by his 
numerous and munificent benefactions.
He was the only child of 
Wyatt George Gibson and his wife Deborah, daughter of George 
Stacey, of Alton, Hampshire, his father's family being mainly from 
the North of England and connected with those of Middlebrooke, 
Johnson, and Atkinson, from the neighbourhood of Doncaster, 
Wilson of Kendal, and Wyatt, Mr. Gibson being lineally descended 
from Sir Henry Wyatt, the father of the poet.
His branch of the 
Gibson family migrated into Essex, from Norfolk, about 125 years 
back ; and, though another branch was previously settled at Great 
Chesterford, the great grandfather of the late author of the ' Flora 
of Essex,' George Gibson, for fifty -two years a minister of the 
Society of Friends, was the first of the family to live in Saffron 
Walden, coming there from Maiden.
Born to ample private means, though occupied during much of 
his life by the cares of a large business, and of many municipal, 
charitable, and religious institutions, Mr. Gibson seems to have 
imbibed at an early age a love of Nature, which, as in the case of 
many of his most eminent co-religionists, was mainly directed to 
Botany.
He seems, when little more than twenty, to have become 
so well acquainted with our British flora that his keen powers of 
observation not only added many species to the list of Essex plants, 
but also detected several forms previously unknown in Britain.
The following is a chronological list of the latter : 
1. Cuscuta Trifolii .
1842.
2. Crepis setosa .

in 1848 by a party of four, but the actual discoverer is believed to 
have been Mr. Gibson.
Lastly, the finding of Potentilla norrojica, 
in Burwell Fen, Cambridgeshire, in 1868, was recorded in our own 
pages (Journ.
Bot. vi.
(1868) p.
802).
In 1846 he communicated to Mr. Watson a list of West Cornish 
plants, which is incorporated into ' Topographical Botany/ where 
also records are acknowledged from Mr. Gibson for North Essex, 
Cambridge, East and West Norfolk, Surrey, West Sussex, North 
and South Devon, Monmouth, Badnor, Cardigan, Merioneth, 
Denbigh, North and West Yorkshire, Durham, and Perth.
As early as 1843, as we are told in the Preface, he " entertained 
the thought of compiling a Flora of Essex, and wrote to several 
botanists on the subject, among others to Edward Forster, from 
whom" he " learnt that he had already collected considerable 
materials for such a work, and had begun to arrange them.
Finding the task in such good hands/ 1 says Mr. Gibson, u I gladly 
made over to him all the information which had come within my 
reach, and during the few latter years of his ( Forster's) life we had 
frequent conversation and correspondence on the subject of his 
intended Flora.
After Ms death, in 1849, no manuscript of this 
description was found among his papers, and therefore I was 
induced to resume the undertaking, for which material from 
various sources were gradually accumulated, till the appearance of 
the Floras of Suffolk and Cambridgeshire stimulated me to put 
them into shape for publication.
M Accordingly, in 1862, ' The 
Flora of Essex ; or a List of the Flowering Plants and Ferns found 
in the County of Essex; with the Localities of the less common 
Species ascertained by recent observation and reference to former 
GEORGE STACEY GIBSON.
163 
Authors, and Illustrated with four coloured Plates of the Plants 
peculiar to the County, and a Map, small 8vo ; pp.
1. and 470, 
London,' was published by William Pamplia.
Issued at six 
shillings, which can hardly have exceeded the bare cost of pro- 
duction, this work was a considerable expense to its author; but 
yielded him in return a well-merited scientific reputation as a local 
botanist.
It was in several respects a distinct advance on preceding 
county floras.
As had been done in the ' Flora Hertfordiensis ' and 
1 Flora of Cambridgeshire,' he carefully traced the distribution in the 
county of common as well as of rarer plants ; but he also searched 
and incorporated the work not only of Eay, but of most of his 
predecessors : he gave a table of the earliest and latest known 
observations of the less common species, and one comparing the 
flora of Essex with those of Suffolk, Cambridge, Hertford, and 
Kent ; and he affixed biographies of four of his chief predecessors 
in Essex botany, Kay, Dale, Warner, and Forster, which are alike ac- 
curate and concise.
The only great improvement in county floras 
established since the publication of this work has been the substitu- 
tion of the division into river-basins for that into artificial districts.
Everyone who has followed in his steps in the study of our older 
botanical writers will fully endorse his remark that " the examination 
of these old works has produced a decided conviction that much 
care was exercised by" their authors, "both as regards descriptions 
and localities, and that they may generally be relied on." Un- 
fortunately, though Mr. Gibson possessed an excellent general and 
botanical library of his own, without means of access to public 
collections, he was unable to render the early records in his book 
as complete as they might have been.
Thus Turner is not quoted, 
Gerard and Johnson are somewhat confused, and some of Dale's 
observations credited to Eay. It is but fair to mention here, as is 
done by the author in his preface, the great assistance rendered to 
him, as to the writers of several other local Floras, by his friend, 
Rev. W.
W. Newbould, who undertook excursions in several out- 
lying districts to note localities, who searched the herbaria of Dale, 
Buddie, and others, corrected the proofs, "and added many critical 
notes, 1 ' thereby greatly enhancing the accuracy of the work.
In 1845 Mr. Gibson married Elizabeth, daughter of Samuel 
Tuke, Esq., of York, and sister to the well-known physician.
In 
1847 he became a Fellow of the Linnean Society; but, after the 
publication of his Flora and the death of his father, other duties 
took him away from active scientific work.
He nevertheless 
evinced to the last his deep sympathy with the multiform progress 
of knowledge.
He was a skilful photographer, and took great 
interest in the progress of electric lighting ; and among his many 
services to his native town was the promotion of the branch railway 
from Audley End. His father having, in 1830, discovered a number 
of human skeletons in his garden, Mr. Gibson in 1876 commenced 
a series of excavations which have resulted in the discovery of a 
most important series of remains belonging to the 9th or 10th 
century, underlaid by a prehistoric village of pit-dwellings, which 
wall be described in a most interesting paper by Mr. H.
Ecroyd 
164 GEORGE STACEY GIBSON.
Smith, illustrated, at Mr. Gibson's expense, by twelve valuable 
plates, in the forthcoming part of the * Transactions of the Essex 
Archaeological Society.' Besides a good herbarium, including that 
of Lightfoot, he possessed an admirable collection of fossil shells 
from the Crag ; and one of the chief occupations of the last three 
years of his life has been the re-arrangement of the very excellent 
local Museum of Natural History originally founded by him in con- 
junction with his uncle, Jabez Gibson.
In 1877 and 1878 he held the office of Mayor of Walden, and at 
the time of his death he was an alderman and J.
P. for the borough, 
and senior partner of the firm of Gibson, Tuke, and Gibson," 
whose banking-house is one of the chief ornaments of the Market 
Square, where also stands a handsome fountain erected by Mr.
Gibson in commemoration of the Prince of Wales's marriage.
He 
built a new Town Hall and several almshouses in the town ; 
further endowed the Hospital founded by his father ; gave thirty 
acres as a site for the Friends' School, of which he was Treasurer; 
and a site with the princely donation of £10,000 to the British and 
Foreign School Society's Training College.
He was also a liberal 
contributor to the Free Grammar School and many other institu- 
tions, by no means exclusively those of the sect to which he 
belonged; and during the winter months frequently found work 
for the poor and unemployed.
For many years he had presided, 
as " Clerk of the Yearly Meeting," over the conferences of the 
Society of Friends, and the very last act of his life was in con- 
nection with this office ; since, acting as president during a long 
discussion on   The Book of Discipline,' he aggravated an internal 
disease of long standing, and died, after five weeks' illness, at the 
Temperance Hotel, Bishopsgate Street, E.C., on April 5th, of 
inflammation of the kidneys.
He was buried on the 11th in the pretty little burial-ground 
behind the Friends' Meeting House, in his native town, being 
followed to the grave by about five thousand people, testifying to 
the general respect for one of whom it has been said that "he does 
not seem to have left a single enemy." 
Small of stature and with a face in which several persons have 
been struck by a resemblance to Mr. Herbert Spencer, he was quiet 
and unobtrusive in manner.
Seldom speaking until he had formed 
a matured opinion, he was an unusually "well-read" man, of wide 
culture and of sound judgment.
Exact, punctual, cautious, and 
conscientious in an unusual degree, he was alike fitted to succeed 
in business or in scientific investigation.
It has been written of 
him by those who knew him personally that "the blending of 
intellectual and moral qualities made him what he was.
He 
grudged no amount of costly or toilsome research to verify a fact 
or arrive at the true understanding of anything with which he had 
to deal.
His unbounded liberality was never indiscriminate : he 
* He was thus one of the remarkable number of botanists for whom we are 
indebted to the banking profession, among whom have been Dawson Turner, 
William Borrer, Edward Forster, and the present President of the Linnean 
Society, the two last members of one firm.

would never pay more for anything than what he considered its 
true value, and he never gave to any object as to which he was not 
perfectly satisfied.
Few men of equal wealth can ever have taken 
as much pains to dispose of it rightfully, and the extent of his 
private charities will never be known.
Plain-spoken, he was yet 
considerate for the feelings of others, and would interest himself in 
their behalf as completely as in his own affairs.
So punctual was 
he in keeping engagements that at a meeting at which he chanced 
to be two minutes late it was concluded that he had been altogether 
prevented from attending." 
As a botanist he may not have had any wide knowledge of 
continental forms ; but with characteristic modesty he submitted 
all the discoveries to which his acute powers of observation led him 
to the judgment of his friends, Mr. Borrer, Mr. Forster, and 
Professor Babington.
For much that I am here able to say of him I am indebted to 
his friends, Joshua Clarke, Esq., J.
P., F.L.S., B.
M. Christy, Esq., 
and the Rev. W.
W. Newbould ; but interested as I am in the 
Essex flora, it gives me much pleasure in being able to add my 
mite of admiration for one who must undoubtedly take high rank 
among the pioneers of the modern critical study of British plants.
NEW CHINESE CYRTANDRE.E.
By H.
F. Hance, Ph.D., F.L.S. Memb.
B. Soc. Batisbon, &c.
When, in 1861, Mr. Bentham published the   Flora Hong- 
kongensis,' the QesneraG$m % — all belonging to the tribe Cyrtandrem, — 
known from the vast empire of China, were but three in number ; 
JEschynanthus acuminata Wall., < Jurita sinensis Lindl., both from 
the extreme south, and Bcea hygromettica B.
Br., from the Peking 
mountains.
Five years later, the present writer was enabled to 
add four species to these, Didymocarpu* oreocharis (now Oreocharu 
Benthami C.
B. Clarke), < hirtia anachoreta, Chirita ?
macroriphon, a 
somewhat doubtful plant as to position, all from the province of 
Kwang-tung, and Bcea Swinhoii, a Formosan under shrub; and 
again, seven years subsequently, he recorded + the existence in the 
mountains of northern China of a plant which he supposed to be 
identical witli the North-west Indian Didymocarpus lanuginosa Wall., 
but which Mr. Bentham has since referred to Oreoehari$> In 1872 
M. Maximowicz reviewed the Japane and Chinese CyrUmdrm\ % 
falling into the same error witli the writer as to the identity of the 
North Chinese plant with the Kashmir species (and, indeed, they 
are outwardly indistinguishable) ; but he only added one to the 
Chinese list, Isanthera discolor, gathered by Oldham in Formosa.

Finally, in 1875, Mr. S.
Le Marekant Moore recorded the Japanese 
Lijsionotus paucijiorm Maxim, from Kiu-kiang, and described a new 
plant from the same locality, under the name of Didymocarpus 
dwicula*, — but which Mr. Clarke informs the writer is either 
referable to Oreocharis, or perhaps sui generis, — thus bringing up 
the Chinese numbers of the order to eleven.
The exploration by the Rev. B.
C. Henry, one of the most 
assiduous and successful investigators of the Kwang-tung flora, of 
the lovely and romantic regions of the Lien-chau River, has now 
brought to light eight other species, of which diagnoses are subjoined, 
a few of them unfortunately drawn up from incomplete specimens.
Mr. Clarke also reports an undescribed Chirita, collected by the 
late Mr. Swinhoe at Amoy, so that, within a period of twenty years, 
the number of Chinese Cyrtandretz known has been increased more 
than six-fold.
The occurrence of eight new species of one group, 
all collected by a single person, within a limited region, shows the 
extraordinary richness of the flora, and the great amount of 
interesting novelties still awaiting discovery, as the area of ex- 
ploration is enlarged.
In concluding these brief remarks, the writer desires to record 
his opinion that Ciirtandrew have at least as good (or as little) a 
claim to separation from Gesnerea as Vacciniacea have from Kricacem ; 
and that he thinks the Cyrtandreous genera require subdivision, if 
they are to be — as they should — considered equivalent to those of 
the American sub-order.
They do not seem to have been quite 
satisfactorily dealt with in the 4 Genera.

This pretty little plant is very delicate, and exceedingly trouble-

I have only had a single flower to 
examine.
It is so wonderfully like a Primula, even when in blossom, 
that it was only dissection which showed me it was a Gesneracea.
Mr. Henry says that, when alive, the glandular pubescence exhales 
a powerful odour of tobacco, which it communicates to the hands 
of anyone touching it, and that it is universally known to the 
natives by the name of Shek-in, that is ' Kock Tobacco.'

Ononis arvensis L.
— Buncrana, W.
E. H.
I could not find it 
there in Sept.
1882.
This plant is recorded, without locality, from 
Donegal in the ' Cybele Hibernica.' I have never been able to meet 
with it.
Medico <jo lupulina L.
— Rather scarce.
A7ithyllis Viilneraria L.
Common.
iTrifolium pratmse L.
— Common.
T. repens L.
— Common.
The native situation of these two clovers 
appears to me very distinct!
in Ireland.
The present species thrives 
in damp or even very wet ground, either by the sea or to a consider- 
able height on mountains, while T.
pratense always looks most at 
home on dry banks and bluffs by the seaside.
Red clover is more 
doubtfully native in the north west than the Shamrock.
T. repens 
is commonly pink in salt marshes, where it resembles T.
fra</iferum.
Some botanists believe neither species indigenous to Ireland.
1\ medium L.
— Local, but quite a characteristic plant in Iimis- 
howen, where I have observed it in the following localities : — 
between Kilderry and Slieve Snacht; Dunaff Head; Leenane ; 
sandy ground at Ardmalin South, on the west side of Malin Head ; 
at Knockglass, west of Malin, and at Goorey, by the school-house.
I have found it also in Northern Donegal at Aranmore.

Owing to a misprint in the Cybele Hibernica ' I did 
not observe that this plant has been recorded from Hornhead by 
Mr. C.

frequently botanized over Hornhead without meeting it.
It also 
occurs in this county near the town of Donegal, Dickie.

The plant here is in all respects similar to 
(E.
crocata, except that it has not got the tuberous roots, and, not 
being familiar with (E.

PODOPHYLLUM A FORMOSAN GENUS.
By H.
F. Hance, Ph.D., F.L.S., &c.
Although during the past twenty-two years the writer has been 
able to add no inconsiderable number of species to the Chinese 
flora, it is doubtful if it has often been his good fortune to record a 
more interesting discovery than that which forms the subject of 
the present brief note.
Specimens were first sent by the writer's 
friend, Mr. T.
Watters, H.
M. Consul at Tam-sui, in the spring of 
1881 ; but these were so imperfectly dried and packed that they 
arrived with the floral organs all detached, so that it was impos- 
sible to ascertain whether the flower was iso- or diplostemonous.
A living specimen was shortly after forwarded, but although 
very carefully tended, and growing nicely, it has only just now 
(March, 1883) j>roduced a solitary blossom, the others having 
aborted, no doubt from exposure to cold.
At the same time a 
liberal supply of flowers, both expanded and in bud, preserved in 
alcohol, has been received, through Mr. Watters's thoughtful 
kindness, and thus ample materials have been in hand for a 
complete examination.
The genus Podophyllum has hitherto consisted of but two species ; 
the North American P.
pel tat urn Linn.
! the May apple or Mandrake 
of the United States (where the fruit is eaten, and from the rhizome 
of which the purgative resin named podophyllme, so much employed 
in hepatic derangements, is prepared), which has twice as many 
stamens as petals, and the Himalayan P.
Kwodi Wall.
! recently 
detected in the Tangut country, province of Kan-su, by Przewalsky ,* 
in which petals and stamens are equal in number, and both of these 
have solitary white flowers.
In the very distinct plant under 
notice the much larger isostemonous flowers are of a dull red, 
arranged in a pendulous group of five or six, in the fork of the two 
stem-leaves; they are bractless, and exhale a strong odour of 
putrefying flesh.
The sepals are not caducous, and the connective 
is conspicuously prolonged beyond the antl i cells ; but the essen- 
tial characters are in every respect those of the genus.
The occurrence of Diphylleia and Caulophyllum in Japan and 
Sachalin, and of Jejfersonia m Manchuria, would of course have 
prepared us for the present discovery.

F. Duthie, M.A., F.L.S.
In the course of getting together, for the Amsterdam Exhibition, 
a collection of agricultural specimens from the neighbourhood of 
Sahuranpur, I have had opportunities of obtaining some informa- 
tion which I venture to think may be usefully recorded in the form 
of short notes.
The climate of Saharanpur is essentially that of the plains of

Northern India, though somewhat tempered by reason of its 
proximity to the Himalayas.
The Siwalik range of hills divides 
the district of Saharanpur from that of Dehra Dun, where the 
climate is some degrees cooler and the vegetation correspondingly 
different.

Wheat is the most important winter crop of Upper India.
There are several distinct varieties, including the bearded and the 
beardless ; different names are also given according to the nature of 
the grain as to its colour, size, and consistency.
This crop is very 
frequently sown mixed with barley, also with certain kinds of 
mustard and rape (lirassica campestris, vars., and ILjuncea), the oil 
from which is largely used by the natives for various purposes.
With wheat are also grown Lathy r us sativus (Kisari), Cicer arietinum 
(Gram or Chana), and Ervum Lens (Masur), three kinds of pulse 
which will be alluded to further on ; also, but less frequently, 
Linum usitatissvnum (Linseed), and another oil-plant called " Duan " 
(Eruca sativa).
Barley is another cold-weather crop, and of this there are two 
well-marked varieties, viz., the 2-rowed and the 6-rowed (Ilordeum 
distichon and H.
hexastichon) , the latter being the one most com- 
monly cultivated in India.
Like wheat, it is usually sown mixed 
with the mustards and other plants not mentioned.
A black- 
grained barley was exhibited at the Saharanpur Agricultural Show 
last year.
Oats are extensively cultivated in the stud farm at Saharanpur 
for the use of the depot horses.
On the hills it is grown mixed 
with barley, and both grains are ground up and eaten together.
Rice is by far the most important crop of the kharif or rainy 
eason.
The varieties are most numerous, and some of them very 
distinct in appearance.
The finer kinds are usually transplanted 
from seed-beds, whilst the inferior sorts are sown broadcast.
It is 
largely grown in the Himalayan Valleys and wherever the ground 
can be irrigated.
Maize or Indian Corn.
— Compared with the other crops this is 
a recent introduction.
It thrives well both in the plains and on the 
Himalayas.
It is a rapid grower, capable of coming to maturity 
within six weeks from sowing, should the season be favourable.
180 VEGETABLE PRODUCTS OF N.W. INDIA.
The young stalks are a favourite fodder for cattle.
The varieties 
are mainly distinguished by the colour of the cob, varying from 
pale yellow or white to a deep claret~red.
The cobs roasted whilst 
green are much eaten both by Europeans and natives.
A common 
bazaar sweetmeat is made of the popped grains roasted with sugar.
A variety called " cuzco maize" was introduced from America a 
few years ago, and has succeeded fairly well, at the Government 
Garden at Chajuri, on the Himalayas.
Great Millet or Guar [Sorghum vulgar e).
— This is largely 
cultivated during the rainy season.
It is usually sown mixed with 
u Til" (Sesanmm indicum) , and Arhar [Cajanus indicus), and other 
pulses, such as Lobiya (Vigna Catiang), Mung (Phaseoliis Mungo), 
Urd (P.
Mango, var.
radtatus), so as to ensure some sort of return 
in case the guar should fail.
There are two varieties, one having 
reddish grains, and the white.
This plant is much valued as a 
cattle fodder, and is often cultivated exclusively for this purpose, 
under the name of Chari.
Mr. Wright, in his Memo, on the 
Agriculture of the Cawnpore District, gives an interesting descrip- 
tion of some native observances during the harvesting of this crop : 
11 The guar was heaped by the cultivator in the shape of the 
figure 8, one end towards the Ganges, and a sickle and a branch of 
Madar (Calotrojris gigantea), in honour of Shaikh Madar (a local 
saint), stuck up in it.
All round the heap a line of cow-dung was 
traced, and the smoke of a sacrificial fire made to blow upon the 
heap to keep off evil spirits (jins).
A double handful of grain was 
given in honour of Shaikh Madar, one to the village minstrel 
(bh&t), one to the Brahnin, one to the family priest (parohit), and 
half a seer each to the village carpenter, blacksmith, barber, and 
water-carrier." An allied recently introduced species called 
S. bicolor is cultivated on the Saharanpur stud lands under the 
name of imphi or black sorghum ; the stems are full of saccharine 
matter.
Spiked Millet or Bajra (Pennisetum tgphoideum).
— Better known 
perhaps under the name of PeniciUaria spicata : it forms a very 
handsome crop during the rains.
It is inferior though to juar, 
both as to its grain and for fodder purposes.
Bajra is sown mixed 
with the seeds of the same plants which accompany juar.
Italian Millet or Kangni (Set aria italica), is another rainy 
season crop, though preferring a light elevated soil.
It is very 
rarely sown by itself, being usually mixed with Sawan (Paninun 
fntmentaceum), or with Chena (P.
mtiiaceum).
The flour is thought 
very highly of by the Brahmins, who use it for porridge and cakes ; 
it is also considered next to wheat the best for making pastry.
Kodon (Paspalitm scrobiculatum).
— This is very little cultivated 
about Saharanpur, and used only by the poorer people.
In other 
districts, however, it is largely grown on account of its being easily 
cultivated on poor unmanured land.
Chena (Panicum miliaceum).
— This is usually sown as a hot- 
weather crop, and, as it requires constant irrigation, it is generally 
to be seen growing in the vicinity of wells or canal channels.
As 
the plant ripens the panicles become gracefully bent, owing to the

weight of the seed.
It is cultivated on the Himalayas up to 
6000 feet.
Sawan (Panicum frummtacmm).
— This and the last-named Millet 
are very quick-growing kinds, coming to maturity within six weeks 
from sowing.
It is grown extensively on the Himalayas, as well 
as on the plains.
In rich damp ground the stems are apt to topple 
over, and, rooting at the nodes, throw up strong secondary shoots.
The hill name is Jhangora.
An allied species, P.
colonnm, is a 
common wild plant during the rainy season, and is called Jangli 
Jhangora or Jangli Sawan by the natives, who sometimes collect 
and use the seeds.
Mandua (Kleusine corocana).
— This is very extensively grown 
both on the plains and Himalayas.
In Dehra Dun and the neigh- 
bouring hilly districts it forms the staple food of the inhabitants.
On the hills it is usually mixed with certain coarse pulses, $.g. t 
Dolichos biflorus (Kulat or Kulthi), Glycine Soja (Bhat, Soy Bean, or 
Japan Pea), and Phaseolus Mango, var.
radiatus (Urd).
It prefers 
a light soil.
Another species of Eleasine (E.
(Bgyptiaca) is a com- 
mon grass in the jungles, and the seed is collected for food by the 
poorer classes.

SHORT NOTES.
Saxifraga pedatifida Sm. as a British Plant.
— The evidence 
adduced by Mr. A.
W. Bennett at p.
152 does not, I am afraid, 
place the claim of Saxifraga pedatifida to be considered as belonging 
to the British Flora upon any stronger or more satisfactory footing 
than that upon which it has hitherto rested.
Irish botanists have 
of late years regarded the distributed plants of Andrews (especially 
Saxifrages) as open to very grave question with reference to the 
localities from which they were reputed to be derived ; for it is no 
secret that many of these plants were taken from specimens 
cultivated in Mr. Andrews* garden, and that hence accidental 
mistakes in their issue not unfrequently arose.
It is more than 
probable that the specimens referred to by Mr. Bennett belong to 
this category, since no other botanist has ever found the plant on 
Achill, notwithstanding the fact that the island has been frequently 
searched.
In any case until further direct confirmation of its 
occurrence there is obtained they cannot be regarded as settling the 
point, any more than Dr. J.
T. Maekay's specimen of Alchemilla 
alpina, preserved in the Herbarium of Trinity College, Dublin, can 
be held to settle the occurrence of the latter species in District 9 
of the   Cybele Hiberniea,' where we are now certain that it does 
not occur.— Thos.

staminate and pistillate flowers in the same inflorescence.
Upon 
subsequent examination it was found to contain not only diclinous 
flowers, but hermaphrodite ones also.
Of these, some conformed 
to the normal type of the pistillate flowers, but developing perfect 
stamens in place of staminodia.
One of the others had four perfect 
stamens, which were growing one on each side of the usual 
staminodia ; and another had three perfect stamens, arranged two 
on one side of the septum and one on the other.
Several of the 
pistillate, and one of the hermaphrodite flowers, contained tri- 
merous fruits, but in no case was the additional cell fully developed.
The three stigmas of these fruits presented no difference that could 
be detected with an ordinary lens.
All the staminate flowers 
contained fewer than the normal number of stamens, most of them 
- seven.
A clearer idea may possibly be given by the following 
summary of the fully developed flowers, besides which there were 
several unexpanded staminate buds.
The total number of spikes 
on the plant was five.

Besides the specimen just described several hundred spikes were 
examined, from the same hedgebank, and only one other abnormal 
plant was detected.
This had three spikes, on which were numerous 
(about 15) staminate flowers, and three pistillate ones, but all of 
them were of the normal types.
The occurrence in the first 
mentioned example, of both hermaphrodite flowers and trimerous 
fruits, would suggest a reversion to an ancestral form characterized 
by perfect flowers and trimerous symmetry.
The abnormal fruits 
also indicate a close affinity with the tri-carpellary gynsecium of 
both Bxixus and Euphorbia.

NOTICES OF BOOKS.
On Cephalozia (a genus of Hepatica), its Subgenera, and some allied 
Gmera.
By Richard Spruce.
Malton : Slater, 1882, pp.
vi.
96.
Under the above title has appeared a short memoir by our most 
distinguished hepaticologist, in which are given some of the results 
of his profound study of the group.
In the preface the author proposes to employ, as aids to classi- 
fication, certain characters, the value of which had not previously 
been adequately appreciated, and adds remarks on nomenclature 
and synonymy.
The memoir itself contains full descriptions of all known 
European species belonging to or nearly allied to Cephalozia, with 
short diagnoses of other species known to the author, especially 
South American, the latter of which will be more fully described 
in his forthcoming work on the ' Hepaticse of the Amazon and 
Andes/ — a work awaited with anxious curiosity by students, and 
one which will probably rank amongst the most important contri- 
butions to the literature of hepaticology.
Up to the present time 
great importance has been attached to certain characters in the 
division of the Jnngermaniacea into tribes, genera and species, such 
as — 1st.
The frondose, or those with frond-like stems, as contrasted 
with the foliose, or those having distinctly leafy stems, which has 
constituted for a long time the primary division in most systematic 
arrangements.
2nd.
The insertion of the leaves on the stem, either 
succubous, having the apex of each leaf lying under the base of the 
next ; or incubous, having the apex of each leaf overlying the base 
of the next.
3rd, The fructification being either terminal on the 
stem (acrogenous) or lateral on short branches (cladogenous), how 
insufficient of themselves these characters are to separate tribes 
and genera is illustrated by the fact that they are all found in the 
different species of the single genus Cephalozia.
In place of these the author points out the existence of other 
characters upon which a more natural division of these plants 
might be based, characters which have either been esteemed^ of 
little value or have not previously been noticed at all, but which 
have been proved, by careful and extensive study, "to be constant 
throughout large groups of species, and therefore of great diagnostic 
value," 
184 SPRUCE ON CEPHALOZIA.
These are — 1st, The insertion of the branches on the stem, 
either all postical or all lateral, or some combination of these 
modes, but very rarely antical ; 2nd, The origin of the primary 
keels or angles of the perianth ; 3rd, The structure of the capsule - 
walls, and the number of the cell-layers composing them ; 4th, The 
number of the sexual, and especially of the male, organs.
The genera Cephalozia and Kantia are examples of those genera 
having a postical insertion of branches ; and Lejeunia, Radida, and 
Fridhniia, of those having only lateral branches.
In the author's notes on the perianth are some original and 
valuable observations on its origin and structure.
He finds that 
two types of perianth obtain throughout the leafy J unyermaniacece ; 
the one (Epigonantha) is distinguished by having the keels, or 
angles, of the perianth at the actual sutures of the connate flower- 
leaves.
These angles are normally three, and the third angle is 
always in front.
This form of perianth is accompanied by a 
laterally compressed stem and involucre, such as we see in 
Lophocolea, Chiloscyphus, &c.
In the other type [H ypoyonianthce) 
the angles of the perianth are the medial folds of the complicate 
flower-leaves, and not their marginal sutures ; and these leaves 
being three, two lateral and the third postical, their union produces 
a trigonous perianth, with the third angle at the back, as in 
Cephalozia, Lepidozia, Bazzania, &c.
; and although additional (or 
supplementary) angles may be developed in the perianth of certain 
genera and species, it is rarely difficult to refer the perianth with 
certainty to one or the other of these two normal types.
Of the 3rd character, the structure of the capsule-walls and 
the number of the cell-layers, little is said by the author, the chief 
distinctions being the presence or absence on the innermost layer 
of semiannular fibres, and the number of cell-layers in the capsule 
of each genus or species.
4th.
The number of the sexual organs, 
especially of the male (which character, although noticed by some 
writers, has not been sufficiently attended to), is found to be very 
constant in many genera.
The author does not, however, propose the two divisions, 
EpiyonianihcB and Hypogonianthw, as primary ones, but we may 
venture to conjecture that when he writes more fully upon the 
larger subject of the natural arrangement of the Jungermaniacea 
they will occupy an important place.
A history of the genus Cephalozia Dum. is given, followed by a 
summary of its main characters, with a division of it into eight 
subgenera, and a sketch of the relations which each subgenus has 
to the others, together with notes on conterminous species, which 
oblige us to unite the subgenera into a single comprehensive genus.
Although there are some startling combinations, as for instance 
of the frondose-like Pteropsiella and Zoopm on the one hand, with 
the genus Odontoschiswa Dum.
(which is reduced to a subgenus), 
on the other, the consummate manner in which the author treats 
the subject shows us that we have an honest endeavour to arrive at 
a natural arrangement of these minute and complex plants.
The eight subgenera are: — 1.
Proto- Cephalozia S., which con- 
SPRUCE ON CEPHALOZIA.
185 
tains one of the most curious forms that have been found amongst 
the hepatics, viz.
Cephalozia ephemeroides S., found by the author 
in Venezuela, growing on moist earth in shade, and on little 
mounds thrown up by mud-worms, and appearing to the eye only 
a greenish confervoid film, like the protonema of a true moss.
It 
is one of the simplest forms yet discovered, having, properly 
speaking, neither stem nor leaves, but from the base of the pro- 
thallium arises a female flower, and at the end of the thread-like 
branches of the prothallium are male spikes.
2. PteropsieUa S., a 
subgenus represented by a single species, P.frondiformis S., found 
by the author in South America.
This species is one which 
illustrates the difficulty of relying upon the divisions " frondose 
and foliose," for although it is entirely destitute of stem-leaves, 
and in its general aspect resembles species belonging to the very 
remotely-allied genera Blyttia and Metzgeria, having, like them, a 
stem bordered by a broad green wing of from four to eight rows of 
cells on each side ; yet it has the cladogenous male and female 
flowers, with the perianth and capsule exactly of a ( </ halozia.
3. Zoopsis, a genus founded by Hooker to include the J.
argmtm 
of Taylor, a species which has occupied the especial attention of 
several hepaticologists, — Hooker, Mitten, Lindberg, and Leitgeb.
The plants embraced in this genus have a flat ribbon-like 
appearance, with a crenate margin, and hence were looked upon 
by Taylor and others as being frondose ; upon closer study these 
supposed crenate margins were found to be minute but true leaves, 
and the author has observed that the two original species, 
Z. argenUa Tayl.
and Z.
tetulosa Leitg., have really bilobed 
leaves, a fact overlooked by all previous writers.
4. AlobUUa S.
is represented by four species, all found in South America by the 
author ; one of them also in the Antilles by Mons.
T. Husnot, and 
named by Gottsche in his honour.
It had, however, been previously 
collected by the author, and named in his MSS.
E. lancifotia, but 
not being published the well-merited complimentary name of 
Gottsche must stand.
In this subgenus the leaves are normally 
entire, rarely cloven at the apex, nearly flat, of an oblong or 
lanceolate shape, with large pellucid elongate cells.
5. Eu-Cepha- 
lozia S.
is a subgenus typified by our common J.
bicmpidata, and 
comprising the great bulk of the Cephalozue of the north temperate 
zone.
6. Lembidium, a subgenus, founded by Mitten as a genus, 
includes a species [C.
Boschiana Lac.) which approaches in habit 
to Odontoschism a denudation, and has the trigonous perianth and 
inonandroiis male bracts of Odontoschisma and Eu-Cephalozia.
7. Odontoschisma Dum.
: in this subgenus are included our two 
British species 0.
Sphagni and O.
denudation, and one (0.
G. obcor- 
data S.) collected by the author in South America.
8. Cephaloziella 
S. is distinguished from the other groups by the slender stems, with 
the cortical layer similar to the inner layers ; the absence of flagella ; 
the minute leaves, with very small cells; the perianth, usually 4, 5 or 
6 angled.
It contains most of the smaller species of Cephalozia, of 
"which we may cite the common J.
divarieata as an example.
^ 
Especially interesting to the British hepaticologist is the

description given of several species new to our flora, and the 
exhaustive notes on those hitherto little known or misunderstood.
Amongst those published for the first time are Cephalozia heterostipa 
Carr.
et Spruce, found on Ingleborough by Dr. Carrington, and on 
the Glyders, North Wales, by E.
M. Holmes.
Cephalozia Jackii 
Limpr., which is fully described, but not recorded for Britain, has 
recently been discriminated by the author amongst specimens 
collected by the late Wm. Wilson near Warrington.
Cephalozia 
leucantha S., collected by J.
Sim, Potarch, near Banchory, Scot- 
land.
Cephalozia ceraria Pears., found by W.
H. Pearson at the 
mouth of an old copper mine near Tyn-y-groes, North Wales.
Amongst those of our British species, which have hitherto been 
only announced as British, but not described, are Cephalozia 
fiuitans (Nees), G.
mxdtiflora S., C.
Lammersiana (Huben), C.
elachista 
(Jack) ; and in the appendix is given a description of Anthelia 
Juratzkana Limpr., which was found lately by W.
West in Scot- 
land, and announced in our journal at the time as new to Britain.
In the appendix is given a description of the following genera 
nearly allied to Cephalozia: Hyyrobiella S., Pleuroclada S., Arach- 
niopsis S., Mytilopsis S., Anthelia Dum., and Blepharostoma Dum., 
the first four being genera published for the first time.
To the 
first is relegated J.
laxifolia (Hook), which had previously been placed 
by Lindberg amongst the Cephalozite, but which differs from them 
by its laterally inserted branches, by being almost or quite destitute 
of radicles, and by the female flowers being constantly terminal, 
with a very lax but trifarious involucre.
Two other species of 
recent discovery were added to the genus by the author, J.
myrio- 
carpa Carr., and J.
nevicensis Carr.
; but in our annotated copy he 
has adopted a new subgenus, proposed by Prof.
Lindberg (Eremo- 
notis), for J.
myriocarpa, a species differing from J.
laxifolm, 
in the absence of stipules, the cell-structures, and the bifarious 
involucre.
Another species, about which much doubt exists, 
is added to this genus: J.
nevicensis Carr., found in a damp 
situation on Ben Nevis by Mr. John Whitehead, of which 
no trace of flowers of either sex has been found.
Herr Limpricht, 
in his "Neues Arten und Formen der Gattung Sarcoscyphus," 
seems inclined to look upon it as a Sarcoscyphus.
The genus 
Pleuroclada is proposed to contain J.
albescens Hook, which had 
been assigned by Dumortier and others to Cephalozia, but from 
which it is distinguished by its lateral and subpinnate ramification, 
bluish white colour, very fleshy perianth, and other characters.
The genus Araelmiopm S., so-named on account of the 
different species comprised in it forming broad thin films, like 
spider's webs, contains some most beautiful forms.
Three species 
only are known, all found by the author in South America.
The 
new genus Mytilopsis S., " having leaves so equally and closely 
complicate, that they resemble in miniature a slightly-gaping 
bivalve shell, such as that of the mussel;" hence the name 
approaches nearer to the genus Micropterygium, but is distinguished 
trom it by its very flat and frond-like stem, with branches springing 
from the under side, as in Cephalozia.
This fine genus is repre- 
sented by only one known species, Mytilopsis albifrons S.
GAELIC PLANT-NAMES.
187 
In closing his memoir the author reviews the tribes founded by 
Dumortier, and from examples given justifies his opinion that, with 
such eccentric combination of genera, their adoption becomes im- 
possible.
The systems of Nees and of Lindberg are also subjected 
to criticism, followed by remarks on the development of certain 
forms, and concluding with a masterly attempt to indicate the 
affinities, or more properly speaking the homologies, of the pouch- 
fruiting Jungermaniacm.
We understand that only 200 copies of this memoir have been 
printed, so that very soon we may expect it to become, by reason 
of its excellence, a rare and much sought-after publication.
Gaelic Names of Plants, Scottish and Irish, .
. .
with notes on their 
etymology ...
By John Cameron.
Blackwood & Sons, Edin- 
' burgh & London, 1883, 8vo, pp.
ix.
130.
This very interesting little volume presents hi a collected form 
a series of papers which have appeared in the * Scottish Naturalist ' 
a journal we regret to learn has ceased to exist.
Mr. Cameron 
tells us that "nearly ten years have been occupied in searching 
through vocabularies, reading Irish and Scottish Gaelic, and 
generally trying to bring into order the confusion to which these 
names have been reduced, partly by the carelessness of the com- 
pilers of Dictionaries, and frequently by their botanical ignorance.
To accomplish this, numerous journeys had to be undertaken among 
the Gaelic- speaking populations, in order, if possible, to settle 
disputed names, to fix the plant to which the name was applied, 
and to collect others previously unrecorded.' ' Only those who have 
been engaged in similar work know how much is implied in these 
remarks, and we can sympathize with our author when he says 
that " if the difficulties of its accomplishment had been foreseen, he 
would have hesitated to make the attempt." No collection of 
Gaelic names with English translations has, so far as we know, 
been hitherto published ; and Mr. Cameron has been fortunate in 
securing the co-operation of the Very Rev. Canon Bourke, of Clare- 
morris, a well-known Gaelic scholar.
It is to be regretted that Mr. Cameron did not include in his 
list the collections of Gaelic names published in Threlkeld's 
* Synopsis Stirpium Hibernicarum ' (1728), and K'Eogh's < Botano- 
logia Universalis Hibernica ' (1735).
Many of these are of course 
taken up in M'Donald's vocabulary published in 1741, and so are 
included by Mr. Cameron ; but a comparison of Threlkeld's ' Index 
of the Galeagh or Irish names ' with Mr. Cameron's list of Gaelic 
names shows that many of the former are omitted from the latter.
We should have been glad had Mr. Cameron indicated clearly 
which of the names are in actual use and which from printed 
sources ; some of them seem to us to be derived from vocabularies, 
for example, we should hardly expect to find a genuine Gaelic 
name for such plants as Amaranthus caudatus, or Cichorium Kndiria; 
Tais aphione looks like a book-name for Paonia, — m& indeed several 
of the Gaelic names seem to be rather translations than independent

synonyms.
Among omitted names may be mentioned that for 
Euphorbia hybema, given by Mr. Hart in this Journal for 1873 (p.
339) 
as   makkin-bwee ' — a name of some interest as being one of the 
few Irish names that has found its way (spelt 'makinboy') into 
English books.
We suspect that Mary's Candle would be the 
correct translation of Guinea] Mhuire, a Gaelic name for Verbascum 
Thapsus which Mr. Cameron derives from ' citing, asthma, or 
shortness of breath.' Some of the parallels to English names are 
very interesting — and to the student of plant names the book is 
indispensable.
We regret that this notice, already too long delayed 
in consequence of the demands upon our space, is for the same 
reason necessarily a brief one.
Under the title ' A Handbook of Higham : or, the Curiosities 
of a Country Parish,' (Wildish, Eochester), the Kev. C.
H. Fielding 
has published a handy little volume, undertaken with the laudable 
motive of creating an interest in the Natural History and Antiquities 
of the Eochester district, in which Higham is situated.
The list 
of plants, with which alone we are concerned, contains 426 species 
of Phanerogams, with four ferns and four Equiseta.
It is at once 
obvious that the number might be easily extended; only three 
Carices are enumerated, while there is no attempt at critical work 
among the Eoses or Eubi ; and it is hardly likely that there are no 
forms of Batrachium except circinatus and fluitans.
There is a 
pleasant introductory chapter to this part of the work, at the close 
of which Mr. Fielding asks for additional information, to be included 
in a second edition.
We have received ' French Forest Ordinance of 1869, with 
historical sketch of previous treatment of forests in France ' (Edin- 
burgh: Oliver & Boyd), compiled and translated by Dr. J.
Croumbie 
Brown, and intended as a companion to his * Forests of England,' 
which we mentioned last month.
Mr. English, of Epping, who has prepared specimens of the 
larger fungi for various museums, and has succeeded in retaining 
their form and colour, has issued a little ' Manual for the preser- 
vation of the larger Fungi in their natural condition ' (Epping : 
Davis), which contains useful hints upon the subject.
A supplement to Chapman's ' Flora of the Southern States ' 
has been issued, containing 15 species new to science, and a large 
number not previously recorded from the region with which the book 
deals, no fewer than 200 of such additions being from Florida.
The fourth volume of the   Monographic Phanerogamarum ' 
has just been published.
The orders monographed are Jlurseracece 
and AnacardiacM, by Dr. Engler, and Pontederiacea by Count 
Solms-Laubach.
In Anacanliacea two new genera are established : 
— Pleiogynium (on Spondias acida Soland.), and Pseudospondias (on 
Spondias microcarpa Eich.).
Three plates are devoted to dissections 
of the genera of Ihirseracea, the remaining twelve illustrating the 
Anacardiacea.

Dr.
Begel describes a new genus of I'nibelliferee, which he names 
Renardia, founded on'> plant collected in Turkestan by Fetison.
The recently issued part of Dr. Beccari's   Malesia ' contains a

OBITUARY.
Frederick Naylor died at Kew on the 21st December last, aged 
71.
Mr. Naylor had a fair acquaintance with British flowering 
plants, in a general rather than a critical sense, and contributed 
three papers —   On the Flora of Jersey,' ' On Bare Plants col- 
lected [in 1863] in the South-west of England,' and   On Asple- 
nium Petrarcha D.C., as an Irish Plant* — to the Transactions of 
the Botanical Society of Edinburgh, of which he was a Fellow.
He had a large and valuable collection of the autographs of 
botanists.
Baron Vincent Cesati, Director of the Botanic Garden at 
Naples, and until recently Professor of Botany at the University 
there, died on the 13th of February last.
He was born at Milan 
on the 24th of May, 1806.
His attention was mainly devoted to 
Fungi, upon which he published numerous memoirs ; but his 
earlier publications were upon flowering plants, among which may 
be mentioned that on the Umbellifera of the Swiss, German, and 
North Italian Floras (1836), and the ' Stirpes Italics rariores ' 
(1840), for which he also drew the plates.
His last work, a 
bibliography of Italian Algology, appeared in the Comptes-rendus 
of the Naples Academy of Sciences in 1882.
William Horsefield, one of the ' working-men botanists ' of 
Manchester, died at Besses-o'-the-Barn, near that town, on the 
17th of January last.
He was born at the same place on April 16th, 
1816, and was the son of John Horsefield, a well-known member 
of the Banksian Society of Manchester.
From his boyhood he 
entered heartily into the study of botany, and in company with 
another well-known botanist, James Percival, he rambled over 
some of the most beautiful parts of Yorkshire and Durham.
For 
many years he was president of the Prestwich Botanical Society, 
and for upwards of twenty years he faithfully filled the office of 
postman at Whitefield.
He was highly respected in the neighbour- 
hood in which he lived as a man whose character was without 
reproach.
He was returning from B meeting of the Botanical Society 
when he was seized with an illness from which he never rallied.
Edwin Clough, of Ashton, another of the old Lancashire bota- 
nists, died, after a short illness, on the 8th of February.
He took 
an active part in the formation and management of many of the 
working men's botanical societies of that district.
Dr. William Edward Steele, Director of the Science and Art 
Museum, Dublin, died at that place on May 6th, aged 66.
He was 
the author of a ' Handbook of Field Botany,' published at Dublin 
in 1847, of which a second edition appeared in 1851, but does not 
appear to have paid any special attention to Irish plants.
He took 
his degree of M.D. at Dublin University in 1837, and was a Fellow 
of the Irish College of Physicians ; he was for some time assistant 
Secretary of the Royal Dublin Society.
About three months before 
his death Dr. Steele was seized with an attack of paralysis, from 
which he never recovered.

SAMUEL DALE.
(With Porte ait.) 
In the course of my tracing the history of botany in Essex, I 
came to the life and works of Samuel Dale, the neighbour and 
executor of Ray, and found that less was known of him than his 
great critical acumen and knowledge deserve.
I also looked through 
his valuable herbarium, transferred some years ago from the 
Apothecaries Company's Garden at Chelsea to the British Museum, 
and from his own admirably drawn up and neatly written labels 
many of the facts of the following biography are obtained.
Samuel Dale is said to have been born in 1659, which date 
agrees with the inscription c4 setatis suae 78" on his portrait 
engraved by Geo. Vertue, 1737, and prefixed to the third edition of 
the ' Pharmacologia,' published in that year.
He was apprenticed 
on the 5th of May, 1674, as the " son of North : Dale of ye parish 
of St. Mary Whitechappell in County Middlsx.
silk-thrower ...
to 
Thos.
Wells for 8 yeares ; " but as he seems never to have practised 
as an apothecary in London it was not necessary for him to take 
out his freedom as a member of the Society of Apothecaries, and 
he seems never to have done so.
A manuscript note by Dawson Turner in a copy of Pulteney 
in the British Museum says, " He was born at Braintree about 
1658.
M The year may be more probable than 1659 ; but I have 
been unable, as yet, to confirm the statement as to the place of 
his birth.
He settled at Braintree, practising apparently both as a phy- 
sician and as apothecary, though the biographical dictionaries copy 
one another in saying as apothecary only.
Ray, in the Preface to 
the first volume of his ' Historia Plantarum ' (1686), alludes to him 
as "D.
Samuel Dale, Medicus et Pharmacop^eus vicinus et fami- 
liaris noster, Brantriaa in Essexia degens, qui libris diligenter 
collatis Synonyma examinavit, errata correxit, et omissa supplevit, 
praeterea siquas species per incuriam aut festinationem omissas 
observavit, me commonefecit, ut ejus ope Historia nostra aliquot 
mendis repurgata, et speciebus aucta sit." 
This was only written about seven years after the return of the 
great naturalist to his childhood's home (1679) ; but Pulteney's 
surmise that "it is highly probable, that from their vicinity to 
each other, Dale owed to Mr. Eay his attachment to natural 
history and the great proficiency he so early made in that study," 
is, as we shall see, confirmed by a statement by Dale himself.
When Eay thus wrote of him he was not more than six or seven 
and twenty, and a careful comparison of the work of the teacher 
and that of the disciple will probably convince most people that 
the latter, confining his attention to a more limited field, reached 
a far higher pitch of critical accuracy of detail.
In 1688 Eay printed the small supplement to his   Catalogus,' 
Journal of Botany.— Vol. 21.
[July, 1883.] o 
194 SAMUEL DALE.
known as * Fasciculus Stirpium Britannicarum post editum Plant- 
arum Angliae Cataloguni observatarum a Joanne Eaio et ab amieis/ 
which consists only of 27 pages.
It contains several plants collected 
by Dale in various parts of Essex, and he is again spoken of as 
" medicus et phamiacopaBus," i.
e. both as physician and apothecary.
In the Preface to the ' Synopsis Methodica Stirpium Britannicarnm ' 
(1690) he is styled " Pharmacopteus, Brantriae in Essexia Medi- 
cinam faciens." 
In 1692 Dale sent to Plukenet a specimen of Malaxis palitdosa, 
which was figured by the latter in his ' Phytographia ' (1691-2), 
247, and in the same year commenced a series of 84 letters from 
him to Sloane — which are extant (Sloane MSS.
4042), and extend 
from June, 1692, to February, 1736, — and his contributions to the 
1 Philosophical Transactions/ which are nine in number and occur 
from vol.
xvii.
to vol.
xxxix., i.
e. over the same term of years.
The first of these (Phil.
Trans, no.
197) consists of queries as to 
" Entalia, Dentalia, Blatta byzantina, Purpura and Buccina of the 
shops/' and his earlier letters to Sloane consist mainly of enquiries 
as to the cases of his patients, requests for the loan of books, and 
more particularly for suggestions as to the various editions of the 
1 Pharmacologia.' This, Dale's chief published work, first appeared 
in duodecimo in 1693, its full title being   Samuelis Dale Pharmaco.
logia, seu manuductio ad materiam medicam : in qua Medicamenta 
Officinalia Simplicia, hoc est Mineralia, Vegetabilia, Animalia, 
eorumque partes in Medicinse officinis usitata, in methodum natu- 
ralem digesta succincte et accurate describuntur.
Cum notis 
generum Characteristicis, Specierum Synonymis, differentiis et 
viribus.
Opus Medicis, Philosophis, Pharmacopasis, Chirurgis, &c.
utilissimum.' It is dedicated " celeberrimo collegio Regali Medi- 
corum Londinensium " by the " devotissimus autor," and was 
perhaps the first systematic work on the subject.
In the Preface 
he acknowledges the assistance of Ray, Sloane, Tancred Robinson, 
Plukenet, keeper of the king's garden, Dr. Martin Lister, F.R.S., 
Doody, keeper of the Chelsea garden, and James Newton, and 
makes also this important statement : 
"Primo initiatus sub Auspiciis Excellentissimi Viri et Rei- 
publiese Philosophies Principis Dignissimi, Joannis Raii, progressus 
feci et militavi^ non sine fructu.
Testes sint Elucubrationes meae 
Botanicae Anglice scripts et lucem favente Numine, aliquando 
visurs ; taceo opusculum hoc leviusculum et impolitum sed Tyron- 
ibus haud inutile." 
Thus it would seem that Dale, thirty years the junior of Ray, 
succeeded Willughby (who died in 1672) as his disciple and 
fellow-worker, a relation which continued between them for the 
remaining five and twenty years (1679-1705) of Ray's life.
Since there is a long review of the * Pharmacologia ' in no.
204 
of the   Philosophical Transactions/ published in October, 1698, 
the work must have appeared earlier in the year ; thus preceding 
Dale's three next communications to the Royal Society, which 
belong to the same year.
The first of these is " An Account with 
figures of three Saxon coins dug up at Honedon in Suffolk/' dated 
SAMUEL DALE, 195 
September, 1693, and appearing in Phil.
Trans., no.
205, vol.
xvii., 
p. 874.
In the same number, p.
970, is a letter from Dale to John 
Houghton on "Bread made of Turneps in a scarce season," that 
of 1693, dated December 6th; and in no.
211, vol.
xviii., p.
158, 
is his account, in a letter, dated October 27th in the same year, to 
Dr. William Briggs, M.D., F.B.S., of " the case of a woman who 
laboured under an obstinate Jaundice, accompanied with that 
defect of sight which Pathologists have called Ambyopia Crepus- 
cularis ; in which vision is quite lost after sun -set and gradually 
returns as day-light comes again." 
No doubt at this period of his life Dale, in pursuit both of his 
profession and of his hobby, closely connected as they then were, 
visited the greater part of the county in which he lived, his journeys 
often extending into Suffolk.
This is testified by the records on 
his authority in the two editions of Bay's   Synopsis,' and by the 
generally dated labels of his (Dale's) Herbarium.
In this there 
are hardly any specimens earlier than the date of the first edition 
of the ' Pharmacologia,' nor does it contain records of his visits to 
London and more distant places prior to 1709.
Like most botanists 
of his time he did not confine his attention to flowering plants, 
and in the second edition of the ' Synopsis ' (1696), in which Bay 
speaks of him as " Kei Botanicae scientia penitus imbutus, ssepius 
a me nee immerito laudatus," besides many other records, there is 
a short "fasciculus" of fungi, received from him after the work 
was in type.
Kay was now attempting the task, then almost 
as superhuman as it was in the time of Linnaeus, of becoming 
acquainted with the entire natural history of the globe, and as 
might be expected the accuracy in detail of the * Historia Plantarum,' 
and in critical discrimination in the ' Synopsis,' suffered from the very 
wideness of view which gave us the ' Methodus.' He was, more- 
over, sixty-two when the first edition of the ' Synopsis ' appeared, 
and sixty-eight at the publication of the second ; and his delicate 
health and enormous literary toil kept him much at home.
Thus 
he relied upon Dale for plants even from the neighbourhood of 
Black Notley, which is but little more than a mile from Braintree, 
and, as he says plainly on many of his admirable herbarium tickets, 
Dale was able in many cases to show how plants had been not only 
omitted, or wrongly placed in the i Historia,' but often repeated 
under two or three different names.

several insects," in which he sends " Cervus volans " from Col- 
chester, Scarabs, Cantharides, and Ladybugs, and notes sea-mice 
and various " cochlear marinae " as observed at Harwich during the 
preceding summer.
It was probably at this time (1698) that Dale 
discovered the fossil shells of the Crag, for which, as he says in a 
later work, he received due credit from Dr. Woodward, 
196 SAMUEL DALE.
Whether previously acquainted with Petiver or not, it is not 
until after the visit of the latter with Buddie to Eay, in 1699 (Sloane 
MSS.
4039, fol.
275), that the 24 letters to him from Dale, 
which are preserved in the Sloane collection (Sloane MSS.
3322), 
commence.
The first of these, dated May 13th, 1700, exhibits 
that interest in the " herborizings " of the Society of Apothecaries 
which appears in many ways in Dale's life.
It opens thus : — 
" Dear Pettiver, Hapning upon the Orchis Anthropophora 
Oreades Foem : Col. and Arachnites sive Sphegoid.
hirsuto folio &c, 
I have sent you some against your herborizing day tomorrow." .
. .
The plants mentioned are Acerm (Anthropophora and Ophrys aranifera.
In another letter, dated October 23rd in the same year, is the 
following reference to Ray's work at the third volume of the 
'Historia': — "Mr. Ray is now describing Dr. Sherrard's plants, 
and if please to communicate yours they will be very acceptable to 
him My service to Dr. Sloan & Mr. Buddie." 
It was probably owing to his close connection with Ray that 
Dale, especially after his teacher's death, was brought into such 
close intercourse with London botanists.
He may possibly have 
had an earlier herbarium ; but among the earliest in date of the 
specimens now in the British Museum, some few of which go back 
to 1692, are plants received from Dr. Edward Bulkley at Madras, 
between 1701 and 1712, and from a brother of Mr. DuBois, of 
Mitcham, who was at Fort St. George (i.
e. Madras), in 1703.
After Ray's death, and still more after the year 1710, he seems to 
have visited London frequently, and the number of correspondents 
with whom he exchanged plants considerably increased.

xxiv., p.
1568, is the letter to 
Edward Lhwyd on the fossils in Harwich Cliff, dated February, 
1703, in which Dale enumerates twenty-eight species of Mollusca, 
and shews himself to be also acquainted with their occurrence in 
the Crag at Bawdsey and elsewhere.
Since the encroachment 
of the sea has now removed all the Crag that then capped Harwich 
Cliff, Dale's observations possess more than a merely historical 
interest, and have been duly made use of in the   Memoirs of the 
Geological Survey/ 
From a letter from him to Petiver, dated June 9th, 1703, 
referring to a visit of Compton to Ray, it is perhaps worth while to 
quote the following sentence : — " The Bishop of London, in a visit 
he did Mr. Ray the honour to give him lately, acquainted him that 
Mr. Tournefort's Corallarium was come to England, and that 
Mr. Newton's Herball hath been some time published.
" The work 
here alluded to was probably that   Enchiridion Universale Plan- 
tarum,' of which, according to Dryander, only the first book was 
printed (See Trimen & Dyer,   Flora of Middlesex,' p.
389).
With 
reference to its author's acquaintance with Ray, the following 
herbarium-label of Dale's, which probably refers to some time prior 
to 1695, when Ray recorded the locality for Trlfolium ornitho- 
podioides in Gibson's Camden, may be of interest : U Fcenum 
graecum humile repens, Ornithopodii siliquis brevibus erectis Raii

myself, shew'd it us on a sandy bank in Tolles-bury, Essex." 
In 1704 appeared the last completed work of Kay's life, the 
third volume of the 6 Historia,' and in the Preface to it Dale, along 
with Dr. Tancred Robinson and Edward Lhwyd, is once more 
thanked for his assistance, in the words: ".hi sunt triumviri, 
quibus in opere hoc locupletando prsecipue debitores sumus." 
Closely following the publication of this work come the 
melancholy series of letters from Dale to Petiver and Sloane, 
referring to the death of his illustrious friend and teacher.
On the 
10th of January, 1704 (1705, New Style), he writes to the former : 
M Last night I visited our worthy friend, Mr. Eay, and found him 
so bad as not like to continue many days." Under date the 17th, 
he writes : " Yesterday I was againe to visit our worthy good friend 
Mr. Kay, whome I found alive and yt.
was all, his sences being 
fleeting and not well to be understood what he said " ; and two days 
later he writes : " The post by which I sent my letter of the 17th 
had not been got out of town above a quarter of an.
hour, before the 
dolefull but expected tidings of the death of our good friend was 
brought me." 
Derham, whose life of Eay was largely based on information 
furnished him by the widow and by Dale, says " all his collections 
of natural curiosities he bestowed on his friend and neighbour, 
Mr. Samuel Dale, author of the " Pharrnacologia,' to whom they 
were delivered about a week before his death." 
On January 24th, Dale wrote to Sloane with reference to the 
income (much less than the £60 annuity that died with the 
naturalist) left to Mrs. Eay and her three daughters, mentioning 
the amount already written of the i History of Insects M ; and he 
seems to have sent the letter in Phil.

have measured well the limitation of his own powers.

the publick, but believe this undertaking to be above my sphere.
Were it only to finish the English part, I do not doubt but that 
with your assistance to do it (being better acquainted with Mr.
Eay's insects than any man), but the exotic part I cannot fathom, 
it requiring more brains and time than I can give, nor am I master 
of so good language as anything joyned to Mr. Eay's would

NOTES ON RANUNCULUS FIGARIA L.
By Thomas Hick, B.A., B.Sc.
The position assigned to this plant by systematists has under- 
gone some variation from time to time, but at present, by English 
botanists at any rate, there seems to be a disposition to accord it 
only specific, or at most subgeneric, rank.
By Dillenius and De Candolle it was regarded as constituting a 
distinct genus, though I am not in a position to state on what grounds 
this was done.
' The Treasury of Botany,' edited by Lindley & 
Moore, contains a description of Ficaria as a genus, distinguished 
from Ramdmculm "by its having 3 deciduous sepals instead of 5 
persistent sepals, and 9 petals instead of 5." " In all other respects" 
the description goes on to say, " it is a true Crowfoot."* In the 
English edition of Le Maout & Decaisne, it is stated, in the account 
of the genus Ranunculus, that "Ficaria has been separated from 
having 3 sepals,.
6-9 petals, and obtuse carpels.
1 ' t On the other 
hand Sir J.
E. Smith, following the example of Linnseus, described 
the plant as a species of Ranunculus, J as does Sir Joseph Hooker, § 
who however makes a separate section for it, characterised, mainly, 
by " the chiefly radical " leaves, the 3-5 sepals, 8-12 petals and 
beakless achenes.
Perhaps, however, the most recent authoritative statement on 
the position of Ficaria, is that contained in the ' Genera Plan- 
tarum' of Benthara and Hooker, which it may be well to quote : 
" Ficaeia Dill, ex B.C. Syst.
Veg. i.
304.
— Species unica 
Europsea, ob sepala ssepius 3, petala <x> , et stylos brevissimos a 
Ranunculis olim separata, ab auctoribus hodiernis iterum cum 
illis jungitur ; characteres enim iidem in aliis pluribus species 
occur runt." || 
It would seem then that both by the older and later authorities 
the number of sepals and petals, and the form of the carpels, have 
been considered the chief points of difference between this plant 
and the Ranunculi, and according as these were deemed sufficient 
or insufficient for the purpose, it has been accorded or refused the 
dignity of generic rank.
It would be extremely rash on my part to attempt to decide a 
matter on which the authorities referred to have disagreed, but 
additional light may perhaps be thrown upon it by a brief account 
of some other important differences, which, so far as I am aware, 
have not been previously described.
If a number of well-grown specimens be collected and carefully 
examined in the fresh state, it will be found that, in spite of some 
individual variation, they all approximate more or less closely to 
one type of organisation.
The flowers are in every case terminal 
structures, developed at the extremities of the central axis and the

successive lateral branches, as is the case with the Ranunculi 
generally.
But the leaves are in the main opposite, and not seldom, 
particularly in the taller plants, decussate also.
Many specimens 
are to be met with in which the opposite phyllotaxis is departed 
from at one or more nodes of each individual plant, but a simple 
application of the statistical method will show that opposition is 
the prevailing leaf arrangement.
While this paragraph was being 
written six specimens were collected quite at random, on which 
there was a total of 39 nodes.
Of these 28 bore opposite leaves, 
single leaves being present at the remaining 11.
It should be 
noted, however, that in these specimens the nodes with single 
leaves were all on the peduncles of the flowers, the main stem and 
lateral branches in every case showing the opposite arrangement.
On the other hand instances occasionally occur in which a unifoliar 
node is met with on a stem or a branch, but this is quite exceptional.
At the base of the stem the leaves are reduced to mere membranous 
scales, but in these the same arrangement may often be seen as is 
met with in the ordinary leaves.
Moreover in the young plants 
just sprouting from detached tubers, which come up in the spring, 
the same phenomena are demonstrable.
In such plants the tuber 
is often surmounted by two small opposite scales, from between 
which is continued the central axis.
At the first node on this axis 
are a pair of opposite scales, followed by a pair of ordinary green 
leaves, with long petioles, which are also opposite.
Hence the 
opposite-leaf arrangement may be regarded as the normal one in 
R. Ficaria, an arrangement in which it differs conspicuously from 
the other species of the genus.
Passing on to the flowers, careful examination reveals important 
differences here also.
The number of sepals and petals has already 
been referred to, as having long ago attracted the attention of 
botanists, and as having received due consideration.
But the 
arrangement of these organs appears to have been overlooked, or at 
any rate has not been set prominently forward.
It must be 
allowed that in this arrangement, as in the number, there is a 
certain amount of individual variation ; but if we again apply the 
statistical method, we shall find that in the great majority of cases 
the calyx and corolla are fundamentally trimerous, and not penta- 
merous as are the other Ranunculi.
In the majority of specimens, 
the outer envelopes of the flowers will be found constituted as 
follows : — 1.
A whorl of three sepals, diverging from the thalamus 
at approximately equal angles.
2. Alternating with the sepals, a 
whorl of three petals, separate and distinct from the rest, from which 
they are readily distinguishable.
3. An inner whorl of 5 petals.
Occasionally other petals are developed in addition to these, but 
even when this is the case the arrangement of the two whorls 
mentioned is not interfered with, the extra parts arising within the 
second whorl as though they were modified stamens.
That this is a very different arrangement from what obtains in 
other species, goes without saying.
In these last the calyx and 
corolla are both pentamerous, and in no case that I have observed do 
the five petals form more than a single whorl.
But in Ficana the 
200 NOTES ON CARRUTHEHSIA AND VOACANGA.
calyx and the first whorl of petals each consist of three parts only.
Moreover, if the second or inner whorl of petals be carefully 
examined, it will be found difficult to resist the conviction that its 
five parts have arisen by the modification of three.
As a matter of 
fact, one of the five is often obviously larger than the other four.
The 
four smaller petals form two pairs, and each pair occupies an angle 
between two of the outer petals, as though it represented a single 
organ.
It would appear then that, theoretically, the inner whorl .
of petals, like the outer, consists of three parts, but that as a rule 
two of these give place to four by a process of dedoublement, and 
the number is increased to five.
In confirmation of this view, it 
may be stated that on rare occasions flowers have been met with 
in which only one of the inner petals had been doubled, so that this 
whorl only consisted of four parts.
On other rare occasions all 
the three inner petals were doubled, and this whorl was six-partite.
In these last cases the six parts were in three pairs, and the pairs 
alternated with the three outer petals.
When the number of petals 
exceeds eight or nine, the extra ones are almost invariably within 
the second whorl, as has been stated already.
Thus amid all the variations met with in the floral envelopes 
of Ficaria, a definite and fundamental plan is more or less clearly 
discernible.
Of that plan the leading feature appears to be a 
tr 'onerous arrangement, in which Ficaria differs not only from its 
nearest allies, but also from the great bulk of dicotyledons.
It 
would seem then, that, in addition to the important differences 
usually recorded as distinguishing Ranunculus Ficaria from the 
species associated with it, we must recognise others of, as I think, 
not less importance.
These are (i.) the opposite phyllotaxis ; 
(ii.) the ternate arrangement of the outer floral envelopes; and 
(iii.) the separation of the petals into at least two whorls.
Whether with this accumulation of distinctive characters, 
Ficaria is entitled to regain its position as a genus, I will not, on 
this occasion, attempt to decide.
It is clear, however, that in any t 
case the descriptions usually given of it will need to undergo 
revision.
NOTES ON GABRUTHERSIA AND VOACAXGA.
By R.
A. Eolfe.
The genus Carruthersia was founded by Seemann, upon material 
gathered at Port Kinnaird, Isle of Ovalau, a small island of the 
Fijian Group; the single species, C.
scandens Seem., being well 
figured (Fl. Vit.
p. 156, t.
80), at least as far as the flowering 
specimen is concerned, for the fruit represented belongs to another 
plant.
In the 'Genera Plantarum ' (vol.
ii., p.
718) a second 
species was added, Kopsia t pi/osa DC.
Prodr., viii., p.
352, from 
the Philippines, with the following note: — " Fructus in utraque 
ignotus, nam quod a Seemannio descriptum ver similiter an plantam 
alienam (Orchipedam *) pertinet." This second species is well

known, with the exception of the fruit, and must now figure as 
Carruthersia pilosct.
The flowers are smaller, much more numerous, 
and arranged in a large terminal panicle, and the leaves very 
pilose.
Abundant material of Carruthersia scandens Seem., col- 
lected by Mr. Home, has now been received at Kew, with flowers 
and fruit in situ, which enables me to give the following description 
of the fruit : — Follicles elongate, slender, terete, slightly striate, 
and minutely puberulous, 4-6 in.
long, 2-2£ lin.
broad, gradually 
tapering from middle to an acute point; seed (not well developed) 
linear, subcompressed, 5 lin.
long, coma of copious hairs, 1-1 £  in.
long.
Mr. Home says, " Strong growing climber on trees in the 
forests, Viti Levu.
Common in many other parts of Fiji." It has 
also been collected in the Island of Ovalau, by Grseffe (no.
1587), 
There is a specimen sent by Mr. Home, of which the genus is un- 
certain, as it only consists of a leaf, a portion of stem, and a fruit* 
The follicles are very divaricate and much stouter than in the 
other plant : the note says, "Large growing climber on trees in the 
mountain forests near Koro Suli, Viti Levu.
Juice white, yields 
caoutchouc." It may therefore prove different when more material 
comes to hand.
The fruit represented by Seemann has the structure of a 
Melodinus, and most likely belongs to a specimen gathered by him 
in the Island of Ovalau (n.
311), which he refers to M.
scandens 
Forst.
It is however different from that species, and may be 
described as follows : 
Melodinus vitiensis, sp.
nov.
(M.
scandens Seem.
Fl. Vit., 
p. 155, non Forst.).
Climbing ; stem glabrous, striate.
Leaves ovate- 
lanceolate or oblong, obtuse ; base attenuate to short petiole, 
glabrous.
Panicle lax ; sepals ovate, acute ; corolla not well 
developed, but covered outside, as well as the pedicels, &c, with a 
close cinereous scurfy tomentum.
Island of Ovalau, Seemann n.
811.
As this is the only species of Melodinus known from Fiji, and 
gathered by Seemann, it is probable the fruit figured as Carruthersia 
belongs to it, and has by some accident been transposed.
M. scan- 
dens Forst.
differs in the subsessile leaves with subcordate bases, 
shorter pedicels, and the broader, more obtuse sepals.
The genus Voacanga was described in 1806, by Thouars (Thou.
Nov. Gen.
Madagasc.
p. 10), but owing partly to the somewhat 
incomplete description, and partly to the scanty material in most 
herbaria from Madagascar, it has remained doubtful up to the 
present time.
In the   Genera Plantarum ' it is doubtfully referred 
to Tabemamontana, — "Hue etiam verishniliter referenda Voacanga

understood the genus rightly, and described an additional species,

(Coinm.

genus should still remain doubtful.

lines, obovate, acute, on a broad claw.
One large reflexed callus 
near the base and about nine or ten other large flat calli along the 
centre of the disk, surrounded by numerous small clavate slender 
calli ; the large reflexed callus greenish, the others dark red-brown.
The labellum itself light red-brown.
Petals of the same form and 
colour as the labellum, except that the labellum is alone articulate 
and the calli on the petals are hardly so fully developed as on the 
labellum, and the labellum is slightly broader.
Column shorter 
than the petals, not much curved and but slightly winged along its 
whole length, the wing extending behind the anther into a deeply 
four-toothed crest; anther with a short point.
This is an interesting 
species from the fact that the petals being formed with the pecu- 
liarities of a labellum prove the correctness of the theory that the 
labellum is a transformed petal.
C. trilabra was obtained on 
Mount York, in the Blue Mountains, N.S.W., and appears to be a 
very local species.
It flowers in March.
Cirrhopetalum clavigerum, sp.
n. — Creeping, rhizomes in 
joints of about three or four lines, covered with long hairs, especially 
round the pseudobulbs, producing roots below the pseudobulbs and 
forming dense patches.
Pseudobulbs conical, from about six lines 
to one inch six lines long, and about five lines to one inch broad, 
deeply ribbed and furrowed.
Leaves thick, oblong, pedicellate, 
from three to six inches long, about one inch four lines broad ; 
scape from six to eight inches, slender.
Bracts lanceolate, leafy.
Flowers six or seven, in a horizontal half-circle, on pedicels of ten 
lines, a few small acute bracts at their junction.
Dorsal sepal 
hooded, acute, dull yellow, spotted in parts with purple, about four 
lines long and four broad, terminated in a clavate hair, about four 
lines long.
Lateral sepals lingulate, united from about a quarter 
of their length nearly to the ends, about one inch and a half long 
and three lines broad, acute, yellowish.
Petals lanceolate, ciliate, 
purplish.
Labellum thick, lingulate, much curved, articulate on 
the basal projection of the column.
Wings of the column recurved 
at the anther, acute.
The Cirrhopetalum which comes nearest to 
this species, as far as I am aware, is C.
Thouarsii Lindley.
C. clavigerum was obtained at Cape York, Northern Australia, and 
flowers in January.

Bolbophyllum punctatum, sp.n.
— The description of Cirrho- 
petalum clavigerum is equally applicable to this plant, with the 
exception of the inflorescence.
Scape one-flowered, rather slender, 
about two and a half inches high.
A small sheathing acute bract 
at the base of the scape.
Flower large, dull yellow spotted with 
red-brown.
Sepals lanceolate, thick, about ten lines long and four 
broad.
Petals lanceolate, not so thick as the sepals, about eight 
lines long and three broad.
Labellum three lines long, thick, 
channelled at the base, contracted in the centre, blunt, curved, 
articulate on the basal projection of the column.
Column short, 
with two prominent teeth.
This plant is also from Cape York, 
Northern Australia, and flowers hi January.

ASPLENIUM GERMANICUM Weiss.
IN HONGKONG.
By F.
B. Forbes, F.L.S.
I am able to note a small but interesting addition to the 
recorded flora of Hongkong.
In 1874, a collection of plants of 
that island was made for me by a Chinese, engaged through Mr.
Ford, Superintendent of the Hongkong Government Gardens.
In 
laying out the specimens into my herbarium, I disentangled from 
some roots of Drijmoglossum camosum Hook., a small fern, which 
was submitted to Mr. Baker in 1876, and pronounced by him to be 
Asplenium germanicum Weiss.
On my return to China I communi- 
cated the specimen to Dr. Hance, who confirmed the determination, 
adding that he was quite ignorant of the occurrence of the plant 
in Hongkong, nor am I aware that it has been again gathered 
there.
The geographical distribution of this little fern, as given by 
Milde,* is throughout most mountainous regions of Europe ; in 
Germany, Belgium, the Vosges and Jura Mountains, Switzerland, 
France, Portugal, England, Scotland, and Scandinavia ; rarer in 
chalk formations ; wanting in nearly all Russia, the Caucasus, in 
Asia, Africa and America.
There is, however, in the Kew Herbarium a specimen of A.
germanicum, gathered by the late Dr. Stewart in the Ravibasi, 
Chumba territory (Western Himalayas), at an elevation of 6,000 
feet above sea level.
Mr. Baker kindly drew my attention to this 
specimen, which, by some oversight, was not mentioned by Mr.
C. B.
Clarke in his Review of the Ferns of Northern India.!
The 
range of the fern is thus found to extend from the extreme west of 
Europe to the eastern Asiatic coast, although, as Mr. Baker informs 
me, it nowhere occurs plentifully in European countries, while it 
would seem to be still rarer in Asia.

Milde (loc.

suppositions that this species is a hybrid, between A.
septentrional* 
and A.
Ruta-muraria, according to Bory, or, according to Ascherson, 
between A.
septentrional e and A.
Trichoynanes.
The two latter ferns 
both occur in Northern India,* but no one of the three supposed 
progenitors of A.
germanicum has, to my knowledge, been yet 
recorded from either Hongkong or South China.

The Date of Plukenet's k Phytographia.' — In my * Early 
European Researches into the Flora of China/ I have pointed out 
(p.
44, note) the contradiction which exists between the date 
of publication (1692) given on the title-page of the third volume 
of Plukenet's « Phytographia J and the fact that Plukenet represents 
in this volume many of the Chinese plants which J.
Cunningham 
transmitted to him only ten years later.
Now I see that in this 
Journal for 1882 (p.
340), Mr. Jackson also states that the third 
volume of Plukenet's iconographical work appeared in 1692.
But 
this at any rate must be a mistake.
Plukenet described Cunning- 
ham's plants in the ' Amaltheum,' which was issued in 1705, and, 
as each engraving in the ' Phytographia ' is referred to the 
j Amaltheum,' whilst no reference to the * Phytographia ' is found 
in the ' Amaltheum,' there can be no doubt that the iconographical 
work, the third volume at least, was brought out subsequently to 
1705.
— E.
Bretschneider.
[I think that Dr. Bretschneider must be under some mis- 
apprehension here ; possibly caused by the copy of Plukenet's 
works used by him having all the plates bound up in one series.
Part 3 of the * Phytographia ' consists of plates 121-250, prefixed 
to these being an engraved title-page and prefaces, dated 1692 ; 
this part resembles its predecessors by having the descriptive 
phrases at the foot of each plate.
Part 4 was issued in 1694, with 
a title-page partly in letterpress, embracing plates 251 to 328 ; this, 
the concluding part of the   Phytographia,' differs from the others 
by the entire absence of descriptive phrases at the foot of each 
plate.
The text to these was furnished by the < Almagestum ' in 
1696, followed by the ' Mantissa ' in 1700, with plates 329 to 350.
Lastly, in 1705 the   Amaltheum ' came out, having plates 351 to 
454, the references in juxtaposition to the plants depicted being to 
the accompanying text or that of the   Mantissa/ whilst the text 
simply indicates the plate and the figure thereon.
In the ' Phyto- 
graphia ' I have detected no allusion whatever to Cunningham's 
plants, whilst in the 'Amaltheum' they abound, entire pages 
sometimes being devoted to the enumeration of the new plants 
sent over by that collector.

HYPOGLOTTIS 
I last month found 
this" plant growing plentifully on the Warden Hills, about three miles 
north of Luton.
The subsoil is chalky, and the old Roman road,

It grew in 
company with Senecio campestris, Orchis ustulata, and Koeleria 
cristata.

Babington has thus named a plant I sent him at the end of May

It is, I see, identical with a plant I found 
on a hillside near Okehampton.
— W.
Moyle Rogers.
Fissidens rufulus Schpr.
— I gathered this moss in two 
localities widely apart in Bolton Woods, West Yorkshire, on the 
26th of last March ; it grew in rather dense tufts on rocks in the 
River Wharfe, associated with Amblyste<iium jiuviatile Swartz, 
Cinclidotus fontinaloides Hedw., Barbula spadicea Mitt., and the 
river form of Grimmia apocarpa L.
The plants were packed 
with rock debris, in a similar way to what obtains in the acuminate 
variety of Andretea petrophi/a Ehrh., only the debris was coarser, 
though hardly so coarse as Dichodontum flavescens Dicks, and 
Atrichum crupum James love to revel m.
The rocks it grew upon 
are grits of the coal measures, but there are plenty of mountain 
limestone pebbles in the river, washed down from above.
The 
altitude is about 500 ft.
I mention all these particulars, as I wish 
bryologists to keep a look-out for it in other places, this being its 
second British station and county.
Gatherings of F.
crassipes 
Wils., should be examined (especially the earlier ones), as this 
species occurs under precisely similar circumstances in the water- 
shed of the Wharfe, both above and below the station for F.
rufulus 
Schpr., in one place on grit and in the other on limestone.
In 
fact, after a preliminary glance at one or two of the younger plants 
(which had not acquired a rufulous tinge), I distributed several 
packets as F.
crassipes Wils., but my eagle-eyed friend Mr, Curnow, 
of Penzance, recognised it at once, and informed me of my 
mistake.
F. crassipes Wils., has larger cells than F.
rufulus 
Schpr., and they are succulent-looking and very different from the 
more regularly rounded-hexagonal cells of F.
rufulus Schpr.
; the 
dry leaves too of tin latter are not so crisp as those of /''.
cras.upes 
Wils.
One or two capsules and a few fruit-stalks were present ; I 
should think it will mature fruit in late autumn.
A lid was 
present on one capsule, the shape being decidedly conical-acumi- 
nate, thus differing from Sullivant's figure of F.
rentricoms Lesq., 
which is supposed to be the same species ; still as this is the only 
British operculum yet to hand we must wait and see.

A handbook of Indian ferns in a compact form and at a mode- 
rate price has been much wanted, and no one has ever had a more 
thorough and practical acquaintance with these plants than Colonel 
Beddome.
His official work for the last thirty years had caused 
him to travel continually among the forests of Southern India, and 
we are indebted to him for the set of fern-illustrations in con- 
tinuation of Wight's   Icones,' that fill the same place for Indian 
ferns that ' English Botany • does for our home flora.
His   Ferns 
of Southern India and Ceylon/ which was issued in parts and 
completed in 1863, contains plates of 271 species and varieties.
His < Ferns of British India/ in two volumes, which was completed 
in 1878, contains plates of 345 species and varieties not known 
within the limits of the area covered by the first volume.
In a 
Supplement, which was published in 1876, he gives plates of 45 
additional species, carrying the whole series to 660 plates, and a 
revised enumeration and classification of the whole.
These were 
all brought out whilst he was still in India.
He has now retired 
from his official position and returned to England, and has spent 
the first years of his leisure in working out the present handbook, 
which contains a complete synopsis of the Indian genera and 
species, full-page plates with analyses of each of his 98 genera, 
and a large number of woodcuts of smaller size, interspersed among 
the text, with a sketch of the distribution of each of the species.
The area covered is precisely the same as that included in the 
'Flora of British India,' by Sir J.
D. Hooker, and within its 
bounds are found about twenty -five per cent, of all the known 
ferns.
Although ferns dry so easily, many of them are so 
large that they can only be represented very inadequately in 
herbarium specimens, and they are often so extremely variable in 
" cutting " that it is very easy to mistake a casual variation for a 
species.
In no department of botany is the synonymy more 
extensive and intricate, and in none have more bad species been 
made.
Up till a comparatively recent date nearly all that had 
been written about Indian ferns was by authors who had never 
been in India, and who therefore had had no opportunity of 
studying the limits of the species in the field.
Now the list, as 
made out from herbarium material, has been twice thoroughly 
revised by botanists who have had ample opportunities and paid 
special attention to species-limitation in the field through a long 
course of years, first by Mr. C.
B. Clarke, who published a revision 
of the Bengal ferns, in the   Transactions of the Linnean Society ' 
(n.s. Botany, vol.
i.), and now by Colonel Beddome, whose experience 
has mainly been gained in Southern India, and who, after a 
leisurely comparison at home of his own collections with the types 
216 NOTICES OF BOOKS.
of "Wallicli, Hooker, Blurne and others in the London herbaria, 
has again reversed the whole list.
The difference in the number 
of species which he admits, as compared with Mr. Clarke's list and 
the ' Synopsis Filicum,' is not so great as that between recent 
British floras.
It is not likely that many new species of Indian 
ferns will be discovered, and the species have now been so 
thoroughly sifted that the list as it now stands will probably not 
be materially modified by further research.
Colonel Beddome 
follows Presl, J.
Smith, and Moore, in using genera founded often 
on differences of veining alone.
His descriptions are, as might be 
expected, a great improvement upon his earlier work.

Ferdinand Hanck.
Leipzig, 1883.
Few algologists have such advantages as Dr. Hanck for carrying 
out the work he has undertaken.
Eesiding, as he does, close to 
the sea, and possessing a large herbarium containing a great 
number of type specimens, and having a large circle of algological 
correspondents and an extensive knowledge of species, he is 
peculiarly fitted to produce a flora of the most trustworthy 
character, and to give all that is known of the life-history of the 
marine Algae.
Of the three parts already issued, the first contains 
a chapter giving directions for collecting, examining and mounting 
marine Algae, followed by another explaining the various terms 
used in relation to their reproductive organs.
This chapter is parti- 
cularly lucid and concise.
Then follows a scheme of classification.
Dr. Hanck divides seaweed into four groups, according to the colour 
of the endochrome, viz., Rhodophycem, Phmophycea, Chlorophycece, 
and CyanophycecE.
The characters of each family follow, with a 
list of the genera included in each, the generic descriptions being 
subsequently given under their respective heads.
The arrange- 
ment of the families and genera differs but little from that adopted 
in recent floras, such as Farlow's ' Marine Algae of New England,' 
or Le Jolis' ' Liste des Algues Marines de Cherbourg,' and fairly 
represents the views held at the present time by leading algologists.
The author has followed Agardh in placing Dumontia in Crypto- 
nemiacew and Catenella in Solieriacem , but differs from him regarding 
the position of Gloisiphonia, which he has arranged in the Cerami- 
acea, between which and Cryptonemiacerr it obviously forms a link.
The genus Callithamvion is distributed as follows : — C.
(Chant- 
ransia) virgatulum, C.
(Spermothamnion) Turneri and C.
(Monospora) 
pedicellatum are placed in the IVranyeliacea, C.
(Rhodocorton) Rothii, 
C. (Antithamnion) plnmula, C.
(Antithamnion) cruciatum, and 
C. (Pleonosporium) Barren being retained with the other Calli- 
thamniece in Ceramiacea.
C. pluma is not referred to Ptilotharn- 
nion, although it would appear to have as much claim to a generic 
rank as Pleonosporium.
In most cases mention is made of the 
fructification being unknown where this is the case, but it is not 
surprising to find that in a few instances the recorded fructifi- 
ARTICLES IN JOURNALS* 217 
cation has been overlooked, since the literature of the subject 
is scattered in so many different publications, some of which 
are not easily obtainable.
Thus, the tetraspores of N malum 
and Helminthora are said to be unknown, which is not the case, 
those of the former being tripartite and those of the latter zonate.
It must, however, have been through inadvertence that the crypto- 
carpic fruits of Callithamnion thuy aides, C.
polyspenmim, C.
Borreri, 
Ceramium tenuissimum, and Grrateloupia idicina are omitted, since 
they are described and figured in Harvey's * Phycologia Britannica.' 
It is not possible to agree with the author in giving Spharoccocus 
nicaensis Etz. as a synonym of PhyUophora palmetto ides, as the 
very slight ebb of the Mediterranean has probably prevented him 
from observing the habit of growth of these species, which are found 
at extreme low-water mark in this country.
The former has a filiform 
creeping stem attached at intervals, so that the plants resemble 
strawberries in forming a network of stolons (see Harv.
Phyc.
Brit., 
tab.
cxxxiv., f.
3).
The latter form extensive rounded patches, 
arising from a continuous spreading disk, from which numerous 
closely packed stems arise.
The fronds are always incurved at the 
margins, so that the tuft resembles a rose with expanded petals.
8. nicaensis has perfectly flat fronds, and its fructification is correctly 
figured by Rutzing, while the tetrasporic nemathecia of P.
palmet- 
toides are illustrated by Harvey in the Phyc.
Brit., tab.
cccx., figs.
1, 2.
The work is illustrated with numerous zinc engravings, representing 
the plants as seen under the microscope, one or more being given 
in each genus.
There are also five plates illustrating various 
species of Lithotkamndon and allied genera, printed by the alberto- 
type process, which give a tolerably good idea of the appearance 
of these singular Algas.
The flora promises to be particularly valuable to British algo- 
logists who can read German, since it includes not only the 
Austrian and Italian species met with in the Mediterranean, but 
also those of the North Sea and Baltic as far as Heligoland, and 
therefore approaches in many points to that of Britain.
Indeed 
it may serve as a guide to the species likely to be found in this 
country, since many Scandinavian species have been found on the 
Scotch coasts during the past few years, while many Mediterranean 
species have been met with on the southern and western coasts of 
England.
It would have been still more useful had the exact 
character of the habitat of different species been indicated, to- 
gether with the time of fructification.
In any case, however, it 
will be valuable as a standard work of reference to British algo- 
logists until a new edition of the marine flora of this country is 
issued.

W. Bennett 
read a paper " On the constancy of Insects in their Visits to 
Flowers." He stated, as a summary, that the different classes of 
insects show very great difference in this respect.
Butterflies show 
but little constancy, except in a few instances ; but they would 
appear to be guided to a certain extent by a preference for par- 
ticular colours.
The Diptera exhibit greater constancy, though by 
no means absolute.
A much greater degree of constancy is mani- 
fested by the Apidae ; and this becomes all but absolute in the 
hive-bee.
It is an interesting circumstance that this constancy 
appears to increase in proportion to the part performed by the 
insects in carrying pollen from flower to flower.
A much larger 
number of observations is, however, needed in order to determine 
with certainty any general law, and especially a careful microscopic 
examination of the pollen attached to the proboscis, mandibles, 
legs, and under side of the abdomen and thorax.
As respects pre- 
ference for particular colours, the Lepidoptera paid, while under

— There followed a communication " On the Methodic 
Habits of Insects when visiting Flowers," by Mr. E.
M. Christy.
The author records in detail the movements of 76 insects whilst 
engaged in visiting 2400 flowers.
He tabulates the results, and 
concludes that insects do possess a decided preference for a number 
of successive visits to the same species of flowers, although this is 
not invariably the case.
Most of the observations were made on 
bees, which seem to perform the fertilisation of at least one-half of 
all the flowers fertilised by insects in this country.
Butterflies, as 
a rule, seem to wander purposelessly in their flight ; nevertheless 
some species, including the Fritillaries, are fairly methodic.
The 
author believes that it is not by colour alone that insects are guided 
from one flower to another of the same species, and the sense of 
smell is suggested.
Bees, he avers, have but poor sight for long 
distances, but good sight for short distances ; of 55 humble bees 
watched, 26 visited blue flowers ; 12 of the bees were methodic in 
their visits and 5 not so ; 13 visited white flowers ; 5 were 
methodic and 8 not at all ; 11 visited yellow flowers, of which 5 
were methodic and 6 not ; 28 visited red flowers, 7 were methodic, 
9 nearly so, while 12 were not.
Mr. Christy inclines to the opinion 
(though admitting paucity of data) that bees, in a flight from 
their nest, confine their visits exclusively or principally to one 
species of plant.

todioid; also specimens of Diplazium tracancoricum, a new species 
from the Travancore Mountains.
He pointed out that Mr. C.
B. 
Clarke makes a new subgenus, PseudaUantodia, founded on the 
allantodioid character of the sori, but Colonel Beddome's specimens 
show that this is a character common to the genus Aspleninm in 
general.
— Mr. J.
Eliot Howard exhibited a series of living and 
dried plants and barks in illustration of his paper.
— Mr. Thomas 
Christy brought forward specimens of Bolivian Cinchonas, and 
made remarks thereon in connection with Mr. J.
E. Howard's 
paper.
— Mr. J.
Eliot Howard read a paper, " On Cinchona Calisaya 
var.
Ledgeriana How., and C.
Ledgeriana Moens." The author 
brought forward proofs that the Dutch Government had realised 
most valuable results from having secured the true Calisaya 
Ledgeriana varieties of Cinchona, whereas in India inferior varieties 
of Cinchona had been planted and the stock had greatly deteriorated, 
and no doubt owing to the best plants having been cut down for 
the sake of the bark.
He brought forward plants obtained from 
seed which he had received from the Yarrow estate in Ceylon, the 
bark from these trees having yielded as much as from seven to 
twelve per cent, of quinine.
By the side of this he placed plants 
that he had raised from the seed given to him by Mr. Thomas 
Christy, that had come direct from Bolivia, and he drew the 
following conclusion, viz.
: — that he believed that no one has 
received true seed of the more valuable sorts of Cinchona Calisaya, 
except Mr. Thomas Christy and Mr. Ledger, from South America.
There followed a paper by Mr. W.
T. Thiselton Dyer, "On a new 
species of Cycas from Southern India "; the species, C.
Beddomei, is 
so distinct that it is difficult to indicate its relationship ; but on the 
whole it might be regarded as a very reduced form of C.
circinalis, 
its Malabar congener, though differing from it in many striking 
particulars.
May 24.
— Anniversary Meeting, Sir John Lubbock, Bart., 
M.P., F.E.S., President, in the chair.— Mr. R.
M'Lachlan, on 
behalf of the Audit Committee, read the Statement of Receipts 
and Payments for the year, and the Treasurer (Mr. Frank Crisp), 
followed with a detailed explanation of the various items, showing 
that the Society was in a very sound financial condition, for 
besides investments of about £5000, the balance at bankers (80th 
April) was £514 8s.
Id. Afterwards the Secretary, Mr. B.
D. Jackson, 
read his Annual Report.
Since the last Anniversary 11 Fellows of 
the Society and 1 Foreign Member had died, and 11 Fellows had 
withdrawn; while 54 new Fellows had been elected.
Between 
purchase, exchange, and donations 407 volumes and 422 separate 
222 UNNEAN SOCIETY OF LONDON.
parts had been added to the Library.
— Mr. G.
J. Romanes, on 
behalf of the subscribers, formally handed over the portrait 
of Charles Darwin painted by Mr. J.
Collier ; its exhibition at the 
Eoyal Academy last year having then prevented its presentation.
A bust of the late Professor Louis Agassiz, by the American 
sculptor Mr. Hiram Power, was handed over by Professor Allman 
to the Society, as a present from the sculptor's son, Mr. H.
Power, 
of Florence.
An engraving from Gainsborough's painting of the 
old English naturalist Mr. Thomas Pennant, was presented by 
Mr. Howard Saunders, in the name of Mrs. Alston, as a bequest 
from her son, the Society's late Secretary, Mr. E.
R. Alston.
— The 
President then delivered his Anniversary Address, commenting 
generally on the events of the past year, with special reference to 
their bearing upon the Society ; in congratulating the Society on 
its annual balance-sheet, he reminded the Fellows that besides 
investments (supra) the property of the Society might be valued at 
£25,000, or a total of £30,000.
He alluded to Colonial Fellows 
and the good scientific work they are doing, incidentally referring 
to the British Association Meeting in Canada to take place in 1884.
Reference was also made to the progress of rearrangement of the 
Biological Collections in the new Natural History Museum at South 
Kensington.
This was followed by Reports on the various 
botanical and zoological publications issued at home and abroad 
during the last twelvemonth.
— The purchase of a portrait of the 
Oxford botanist, Jacob Bobart (1598-1679) was announced ; and 
the President presented a valuable portrait of Linnaeus, from life, 
by the Swedish artist Magnus Hallman.
A resolution was unani- 
mously accorded by the Society, at the instance of the Chair, to 
to Mr. Bentham and Sir J.
D. Hooker, on the completion of their 
great work the • Genera Plantarum.' Obituary notices of some 
deceased Fellows — Professor Dickie, Dr. Thwaites, Dr. Jameson, 
Mr. Gibson, and Mr. Moggridge — were read by the Secretary.
The Scrutineers having examined the ballot, then reported that 
Mr. T.
Christy, Mr. H.
E. Dresser, Mr. G.
R. M.
Murray, Mr. H.
Saunders, and Mr. H.
T. Stainton, had been elected into the 
Council, in the room of Mr. H.
W. Bates, Mr. G.
Busk, Mr. C.
B. 
Clarke, Sir John Kirk, and Mr. R.
M'Lachlan, who retired; and 
re-elected for Officers, Sir J.
Lubbock as President, Mr. Frank 
Crisp as Treasurer, and Mr. B.
Daydon Jackson and Mr. G.
J. 
Romanes as Secretaries.
June 7.— Sir John Lubbock, Bart., President, in the chair, 
Mr. R.
J. Clarke and Mr. Frank Matthews were elected Fellows of 
the Society.— Mr. W.
T. T.
Dyer exhibited a series of copals, some 
from Inhambana near Mozambique, the product of Copaifera 
Gorskiana, of various sorts, with a melting-point from 310° to 360° 
Fahr.
; others from Lagos (obtained by Captain Maloney), used by 
the natives for burning, and powdered by the women as a body 
perfume.
These last are supposed to be from a species of Daniellia, 
the native name being " Ogea."— Mr. Hiern drew attention to 
specimens of Quercus Ilex, var.
Fordii, from Barnstaple, Devon, 
showing remarkable alteration in the leaves after pruning.
— Mr. G.
LINNEAN SOCIETY OF LONDON, 223 
Murray exhibited specimens of dace killed by the fungus disease 
(Saprolegnia ferax), the result of inoculation, and said to be the 
first recorded experimental proof of the communicability of the 
disease to those fish.
— A paper was read by Mr. H.
N. Ridley, u On 
New and Rare Monocotyledonous Plants from Madagascar.'' The 
plants described were in part collected by the Rev. W.
Deans 
Cowan in East Central Madagascar, and sent by him to the British 
Museum ; to which were added notes and descriptions of others 
collected by Hildebrandt and Hilsenberg and Bojer.
Among them 
is a fine new species of Drimia (a genus not hitherto recorded 
from Madagascar) called " Rat-onion" by the natives, who use it to 
poison rats ; and a species of Xerophyta closely allied to X.
dasyliri- 
oide$ y but with the leaves thickly covered with spines.
Several 
specimens of Dioscorea hexagona, collected by Hilsenberg and Bojer 
and later by Hildebrandt are worth notice.
The species was 
described by Mr. Baker in Journ.
Bot. 1882, p.
270, as a climbing 
plant with cordate leaves, but these specimens are erect in habit, 
about a foot high, with narrow, oblong, reticulated leaves, looking 
quite unlike a Dioscorea.
In some of the other Dioseoreas, such as 
D. pyrenaica, the young plant is at first erect and then trails along 
the ground, but is never more than about an inch in the erect 
growth, whereas D.
hexagona grows to the height of one foot erect.
Among the orchids are two new species of the small- flowered 
group of Polystachya, and two of the typically Madagascar genus 
Cynosorchis, one of which is remarkable for its possessing but one 
or two very large handsome green, white and purple flowers.
Among the Gyperacem, Gourtoisia cyperoides, a well-known Indian 
plant, was collected by Hildebrandt in Madagascar, thus extending 
its range westward.
A new species of Fintelmannia was obtained 
by Mr. Deans Cowan, and there are also specimens from Hilsenberg 
and Bojer in the British Museum Herbarium.
The genus hitherto 
has only contained a single well-known Brazilian species, which 
differs very considerably from the Madagascar plant, which has 
numerous small spikelets, of which far the greater number have 
only male flowers, the females being usually two or three together 
in the upper parts of the lowest spikelets ; the leaves are setaceous 
and armed with fine spines.
There is also a new genus (Acriulus) 
of the Scleriece, allied in some respects to Gryptangium; of this 
there are two species ; one from Madagascar, where it was collected 
by Baron and also by Hildebrandt, the other from Angola, collected 
by Dr. Welwitsch.
They are tall marsh plants, with somewhat the 
habit of a Cladium or Galmia, with broad leaves edged more or less 
conspicuously with spines, and a panicle of small purple or green 
and purple spikelets.
The greater number of the flowers are male, 
the female spikelets are very few and placed in the lower part of the 
panicle ; indeed these have not been seen in the Angolan plant.
The stamens are provided with a conical apiculus, crimson in 
the Angola plant, covered with short processes, which from their 
shape and position suggest some homology with stigmatic hairs.
The style is remarkably cleft almost to the base, where it is dilated, 
then contracted so as to appear articulated to the next.

chiefly bearing out views already noticed on a former occasion (see 
Journ.

BOTANICAL NEWS.
We are glad to notice that the Royal Irish Academy is actively 
encouraging the further investigation of the botany of Ireland.
The following are among the scientific grants recommended by the 
Council and sanctioned by the Society at its meeting on the 28th 
of May.
£10 to Mr. T.
H. Corry, to complete the botanical 
survey of Ben Bulben; £15 to Mr. S.
A. Stewart, for a botanical 
survey of Lough Allen and the Slievanierin Mountains ; £15 to 
Mr. Greenwood Pirn, to investigate the Irish fungi, especially 
those of Killarney; £10 to Bev. Mr.
Lett, for an examination 
of the mosses and lichens of the Mourne Mountains; £15 to 
Mr. R.
M. Barrington, for the exploration of the flora of the Shannon 
Lakes.
We regret to learn that the premises of the printers who were 
engaged upon the plates of Dr. Cooke's   Illustrations of British 
Fungi' and * Freshwater Algas,' have been entirely destroyed by 
fire, and with them all the work in progress.
This will cause 
uncertain and unavoidable delay, but as soon as possible arrange- 
ments will be made for the continuation of these works.
We are glad to see that the Senate of the University of Cam- 
bridge has decided to open the Botanical Gardens on Sunday 
afternoons during the summer, to members of the University and 
their friends.
It is perhaps not generally known that the opening 
of Kew Gardens an hour earlier applies to Sundays as well as 
week-days, so that on Sundays the gardens are now open at 1 p.m.
It is hardly likely that many visitors will be present between 1 and 
2, but the step is one in the right direction.
Now that the 
Cambridge Botanical Gardens has joined the Boyal Gardens at 
Kew and Hampton Court in Sunday opening, it may be hoped that 
the authorities of Oxford will not be long behind in granting a 
similar boon, which we should like to see extended to others 
besides the members of the University and their friends.
The Hebdomadal Council of Oxford University have resolved, 
under the provisions of the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge 
Act, 1877, to suspend further until November 30, 1883, any 
election to the Sherardian Professorship of Botany.
It is satisfactory to learn that the ' Scottish Naturalist/ to the 
discontinuance of which we referred at page 187, is to be revived 
under the editorship of Professor Trail of Aberdeen.
The annual 
subscription is only 4s.
6tZ., and it is to be hoped that this revival 
will meet with the success which it certainly deserves.
Prof.
Bureau has been appointed Director of the Jardin des 
Plantes.

SAMUEL DALE.
(Concluded from p.
197.) 
Having discharged his duties as Ray's literary executor, Dale 
returned to his own work, and in 1705 published a supplement to 
the • Pharmacologia,' forming a duodecimo volume almost equal in 
bulk to the original work.
His continued interest in Botany during 
the few succeeding years is evidenced by his letters to Sloane.
In 
1706 he writes : — " The death of Mr. Doody hath quite extinguished 
my hopes of seeing the ' Plantarum Incompletarum Historia,' he 
was so long about, published, unless his plates and notes fall into 
some good hand." On September 3rd, 1707, he writes : — " By the 
coach this day I sent a Hanch of Venison for you and some of my 
friends to eat together, but directed to your house ....
the Persons 
I desire may be at eating are yourself, Dr. Robinson, Mr. Stone- 
street, Mr. Buddie, Dr. Thorp, and Mr. Petiver." From a message 
sent with the haunch, Dr. Thorp appears to have been compara- 
tively a stranger, as he speaks of him as "the Physitian who 
assists in the Transactions, whose [name?] at present I cannot 
remember.'' 
In 1708 he seems to have collected a few choice plants for pre- 
sentation to Dr. Sloane.
They are in vol.
94 of the Sloane 
Herbarium, and from the labels he appears to have been at 
Harwich and at Hildersham (Cambridgeshire) during that year.
In a letter dated December, 1708, he alludes to having been in 
London five months previously.
From the labels in his herbarium 
he appears to have collected specimens in the Chelsea Botanick 
Garden in 1709, and in almost every succeeding year down to 1738, 
besides receiving many specimens from Rand, who was Pr&fectus 
from 1724.
In 1709, also, he visited the garden of his friend 
Eales, at Welwyn, Herts, went to Hampton, and in July paid his 
only recorded visit to the Oxford Garden, from which Bobart after- 
wards sent him specimens.
In 1710 he seems to have been at 
Norwich and at Chislehurst, and at the De Beaufort Garden in 
Chelsea.
In the same year he published the second edition of the 
1 Pharmacologia, 1 incorporating the Supplement of 1705, but 
retaining the duodecimo form.
In 1711 he visited the garden of 
Fulham Palace, that of Uvedale at Enfield, that of the Earl of 
Manchester at Leez, and that of Mr. Jekyll at Hedingham Castle ; 
and during that and the three following years he received many 
plants, mostly foreign, from Stonestreet.
In 1712 he visited 
Putney, and was again at Enfield ; and between 1713 and 1724 he 
received a large series of plants from Catesby, from Virginia, 
Carolina, and Jamaica.
These exotic forms he seems to have 
studied as carefully as his British collection, his labels discussing 
their synonymy in great detail.
In 1714 he visited Fairchild's 
garden at Hoxton, and received specimens from Charles Du Bois 
of Mitcham ; and in 1715 we find he was at Waltham Abbey.
Under date August 14th, 1716, he writes to Petiver;— " I

should be glad to know what success Mr. Sherrard and you had in 
Suffolk, and whether you found the Loving land Conyza and the 
Orford Medica.
I have been in Kent, and at Dover found the 
Lychnis and Limonium, but mist the Daucus lucidus." The 
plants here alluded to are probably Senecio paludosus, Medicago 
denticulate , Silene parado.va, Statice Bahusiensis (?), and Dauais 
gumnu'fer.
Under date August 20th, 1717, he writes to Sloane (made a 
Baronet in 1715) :— -" Sr. At the request of Mr. Innys I am now 
going to finish the History of English Plants, which 1 many years 
ago began, and made a considerable progress in it then, but have 
long discontinued it by reason of the death of Hen. Faithorn : I am 
very sensible that the late Mr. Buddie made many discoverys in 
English Plants not mentioned by Mr. Bay in his last Synopsis, and 
he being dead his work is not likely to be published : And being 
acquainted that his copy is in your hands, my humble request to 
you is that you will please to vouchsafe me the perusal of it, and I 
do assure you that it shall be safely return'd, and right done to the 
Author 
ii 
Two months later he repeats his request in a letter of interest 
with reference to Buddie, and also as showing the thoroughness of 
his own work:^-" Oct. 30, 1717 Mr. Buddie had write a 
Synopsis, Cataloge or some such thing on English plants which he 
did one time show me, and told me he intended to publish it, and 
had gone so far as to draw the Dedication and Preface, but that 
which hindered him in his design was this : Having either in Dedi- 
cation or Preface said that the method was with the approbation of 
Mr. Stonestreet and others, but they not approveing of it made him 
decline it : This latter part I had from Mr. Stonestreet more than once ; 
and the same if I mistake not from Mr. Band : Now having been told 
that you had purchased not only his plates but likewise this copy, 
made me write to you to desire the perusal of it and was the 
more surprised when I understood you had it not', because I could 
not conjecture what had become of it, nor how you came to miss of 
it.
I thank you for the kind offer you made of a sight of his plants 
at your house, but this must needs be impracticall as to me, for 
being in business, my time will not permit my being so long in 
London, as the taking out of notes, and descriptions will require 
besides, it will be needfull for me to compare my own dryed plants 
with yours, and to have my own copy at hand that so 1 might not 
thro' mistake impose upon the world, and the design be perverted 
by leading into errors insted of correcting them : and this I am not 
without hopes may in some measure be prevented (for humanum 
est erxare) if you will please to permit the volums of English plants 
to be sent to Braintree, which they may be without prejudice, by 
being put in a wooden case made to them ; if you please to grant 
this favour Mr. Innys hath order to have such a case made, and 
you may assure yourself they shall be carefully used and returnM 
faithfully." It does not appear, however, whether this suggestion 
was ever acted upon.
The Mr. Innys mentioned was his publisher, 
and Henry Faithorne had been printer to the Boyai Society.
SAMUEL DALE.

During the next twelve years we know but little of Dale's life 
and work.
In 1721 he was at Bainsgate, and received plants from 
Uvedale; and in the following year he visited Cambridge and 
Eltham.
He was also at Sherard's garden, at the latter place, in 
1724, '25, '26, and '31.
In 1723 and '24 lie received specimens 
from Andrews, of Sudbury, with whom he seems to have been on 
intimate terms, their practices being within riding distance, and 
whom he visited in 1725.
In 1725, also, he received a fascicle of plants from Mr. Matthews, 
Deputy-Governor of St. Kitt's; in 172G some specimens from 
Dillenius, then at Eltham; and in 1727 " plants India* Orientalis 
collects a Francisco Dale." This Francis Dale, spoken of as 
"cognatus," " consanguineus," and as "Junior," was, I believe, 
either a nepbew or a first cousin once removed, being the son of 
Francis Dale, practising at Hoxton, who seems to have been either 
an elder brother or a cousin .
Francis Dale, junior, seems to have 
travelled both in the East and West Indies, and in 1730 sent his 
relative a large number of specimens from New Providence, and, 
in 1732, from Bahama, with seeds, some of which were raised in 
the Braintree garden.
In 1730 Dale published the second great work of his life, 
• The History and Antiquities of Harwich and Dovercourt, in the 
County of Essex,' by Silas Taylor, Gent.
; to which is added a 
large Appendix, containing the Natural History of the Sea-coast 
and Country about Harwich, particularly the Cliff, the Fossils, 
Plants, Trees, Birds, and Fishes, &c, by Samuel Dale;' 4to.
It 
is dedicated to Sir Hans Sloane, "In grateful acknowledgment of 
his many favours." Of Dale's share in this book, Pulteney, who 
styles it " a real acquisition to science," says that in the "large 
notes, amounting to much the greater part of the book.
Howso- 
ever respectable our author may appear as an antiquary ....
he is 
equally so as a naturalist." In the preface Dale says that "dwell- 
ing more than 30 miles from the place, and being continually 
employed in his Profession," he " could not afford more time than 
perhaps one day or two in a year, and that in the summer months." 
He dwells at length upon the cliff, " whose imbedded Fossils," he 
says, " I had there discovered ; the first Invention of which the late 
Dr. Woodward in publick company attributed to me." He describes 
cement-stones, "copperas stones," i.e. pyritous nodules, used in 
manufactures in the neighbourhood, amber, " selenites," "a 
congeries of Vermiculi," a "Patella," 20 " Cochleata," or uni- 
valves, 18 bivalves, " Odontopetra," or shark's-teeth, and a verte- 
brate "ileum;" and gives a plate representing the Crag resting 
upon the London Clay, and forming an overhanging cliff.
In the 
Appendix he enumerates twelve Crustacea, sixty fishes, forty-seven 
birds— chiefly sea-fowl, six " marine insects," thirty-six Testacea, 
and ninety-four of the less common plants; so that, whilst the 
original manuscript of the work was that of an ordinary local 
history, it became in his hands a record also of the natural 
productions of the neighbourhood, such as is seldom produced 
even in our own da v.
It reached a second edition in 1732, 
228 SAMUEL DALE.
In 1731, besides visiting Eltham and the Chelsea Garden, we 
learn from his herbarium that he visited those of Sir Charles 
Wager and Mr. Grey at Fulham, and made a summer tour into the 
West of England.
He visited Mr. Blaitwaite's garden at Dereham, 
Gloucestershire ; was at Keynsham, between Bath and Bristol, on 
May 21st; went to Bristol, Bath, — 
Wells 
Wimborne 
and also at Wareham and Poole.
This year is also the first in 
which I have any note of his receiving plants from Peter Collison, 
of Peckham, whom he visited in 1732.
In this last year he was at 
Mr. Greene's garden at Fulham, and again at Sir Charles Wagers 
at the same place, and also at Andrews' at Sudbury; as also in 
1733 and 1734.
In 1734 he visited the Gog-and-magog Hills, and 
Dr. John Spurgeon's garden at Halsted; and in 1736 "the noble 
Lord Peter's garden," probably that at Thorndon Hall, Essex.
Dale's last contribution to the • Philosophical Transactions' 
belongs to the close of the year 1736, and accompanied a 
present of a pair of antlers of the Moose deer to Sir Hans Sloane.
It is entitled, " Descriptions of the Moose deer of New England, 
and a sort of stag in Virginia ; with some remarks relating to Mr.
Bay's description of the flying squirrel of America" (Phil.
Trans., 
vol.
xxxix., p.
384).
To this year also belong the earliest of his 
letters to the " Rev. Mr.
(afterwards Dr.) Thos.
Birch in St. John's 
Lane, near Hickes-Hall" (Sloane MBS., 4304).
These refer mainly 
to the third edition of the ' Pharmacologia,' which Dr. Birch appa- 
rently translated into Latin.
Dale speaks of himself as "I who 
have been more than 60 years from school," and elsewhere says, 
"I find a note or two wanting which I dare not trust my own 
Latin with, but hope your goodness will excuse my troubling you 
with the request of doing it for me." Few of the naturalists of the 
time could approach Eay in his graceful style of classical composi- 
tion, and it is possible that Dr. Tancred Robinson may have 
previously assisted Dale in these matters as he assisted Petiver.
In this series of thirty-nine letters Dale speaks of " my kind friend 
Mr. Mark Catesby," and "my respected friend Mr. Isaac Rand," 
and also alludes to the death of the two sons of his " nephew Dr.
Thos.
Dale," who was resident in South Carolina.
The third edition of the 'Pharmacologia' was published 
between May 11th and August 11th, 1737, in quarto.
The title is 
the same as that of the previous editions, with addition of the 
letters u M.L." to the author's name, and at its close the words, 
M Ad calcem adjicitur Index duplex : Generalis alter, nominum, &c, 
alter Anglico-Latinus ; in gratiam Tyronum, Tertia editio, multis 
emendatis et aucta." As a frontispiece there is a fine portrait of 
the author, lettered " Geo. Vertue sculpsit 1737," similar to the 
one prefixed to the present memoir, but surrounded by a frame 
inscribed, " setatis suae 78." The letters " M.L." no doubt signify 
Licentiate in Medicine ; but I have as yet been unable to discover 
from what body Dale received such a diploma.
Of this work 
Pulteney justly remarks, that "In an interval of more than forty 
years, between the first and last editions several excellent 
SAMUEL DALE.
229 
publications had taken place abroad, which, aided by the improve- 
ment at home, enabled Dale to select better materials, and give his 
last edition the importance of a new work.
Scarcely in any author 
is there a more copious collection of synonyms.
" It is perhaps 
necessary to explain that this edition was followed by several others 
after the death of the author.
In the preface is a passage of such interest, in connection with 
the herborizations of the Society of Apothecaries, that I may perhaps 
be justified in quoting it at length : — " Ut stirpes in agris nascentes 
melius ediscant Pharmacopsei Juniores, sex per sestatem Plantas 
investigandi gratia instituit eadem Societas itinera (mense Julii 
excepta) quibus confectis, herbarum nomina inter Tyrones quisque

At Grande

quod quidem institutum centum abhinc annos invaluisse videtur.
Clarissimus enim Thomas Johnsonus in Itinere plantarum suo 
investigationis ergo suscepti a decern sociis in agruni Cantianum, 
Anno Domini 1629 hsec habet : Paucis abhinc elapsis annis con- 
suetudo vere laudabilis inter rei herbaria studiosos crevit, bis aut 
saepius quotannis triduum aut quatriduum iter Plantarum investi-

dictum afferunt, ubi Pnefectus in pnesentia Magistri, Gardia- 
norum, &c, eas demonstrat, ad cujus Pnelectionem cuilibet curioso 
datur Accessus." 
Dale's appreciation of the work of Johnson is further exhibited 
by the fact that in his copy of the   Therinae BathonicaB' (1634) and 
'Mercurii Botanici pars altera 1 (1641), now in the Banksian 
library, he has transcribed in his own neat handwriting the whole 
of Johnson's other minor works, viz.

and 1632, the two Hampstead lists of the same dates, and

The last letter to Dr. Birch is dated August, 1738 ; but beyond 
this, and the fact that he collected specimens in the Chelsea 
Garden during that year, we know nothing as to the last few 
months of Dale's life.
He died on the 6th of June, 1739, being 
then.
about eighty years of age, and was buried in the Dissenter's 
Burial-ground at Bocking.
In the   Gentleman's Magazine ' he is described at his death as 
Dr. Samuel Dale, F.R.S.
; and many notice, of him speak of his 
being a Licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians.
He, how- 
ever, seems never to have received or used the title of M.D.
; his 
name does not occur in Dr. Thomson's list of the Fellows of the 
Royal Society, nor in that by Dr. Munk of the Licentiates of the 
College of Physicians.
There is, in fact, no reason to suppose that 
either of these three titles have been rightly applied to him.
230 SAMUEL DALE.
His learning received recognition during his lifetime^ from 
Linnaeus, whom he may possibly have seen during his visit to 
England in 1736, in the dedication to him of the genus Dalea.
This was founded in the ' Hortus Cliffortianus ' (1737) for a South 
American papilionaceous plant, communicated to the Cliff ort 
garden by Philip Miller, of Chelsea.
In the ' Species Plantarum ' 
(1753) Linnaeus included this species in Van Boyen's genus 
Psoralea, as P.
Dalea; but Jussieu and Willdenow restored the 
genus, which includes several species both from North and South 
America.
Another genus Dalea was established by Browne shortly 
afterwards for a Jamaica species, Eupatorium Dalea L.
In Eloy's ' Dictionnaire Historique de la Medecine ' (1778) the 
author of the ' Pharmacologia ' is made a distinct person from the 
editor of the ' History of Harwich.' This is copied in Adelung's 
1 Jochers Gelehrten Lexicon ' (1787)- Hoefer's ' Nouvelle Biographie 
Generale' (1856) gives the date of his birth erroneously as 1650, 
but makes the further statement : — " On lui doit l'introduction en 
Europe de plusieurs vegetaux exotiques, dont la plupart lui 
avaient ete addresses de la Caroline par Catesby." This is very 
probably true.
Perhaps the best account of him is that in Eose's 
1 Biographical Dictionary,' vol.
vii., 1857.
In the Sloane MSS.
there is the following " copy of that clause 
in the late Mr. Dale's will which relates to his Legacy of Books 
left to the Worshipful Company of Apothecaries London.
Also I 
give and devise unto the Master Wardens and Society of Apothe- 
caries of the City of London all such of my Books in Botany as at 
present they have not and also all my Hortus Siccus or collection 
of dried plants including those collected by my kind friend and 
neighbour the late learned Mr. John Ray upon condition the said 
Master Wardens &e.
shall within twelve months next after my 
Decease make or erect proper conveniences in their Physick Garden 
at Chelsea in the County of Middlesex for the Eeception thereof 
and under such Regulations for the keeping and preserving them 
as shall be agreed on and approved of by Sr. Hans Sloane Bart.
M.D. President of the Royal Society London and my Executor 
hereafter named." 
Among the books thus bequeathed is a presentation copy of the 
second edition of Ray's Synopsis, to which are added two manu- 
script appendices enumerating some forty additional species, 
mainly from Essex, in Dale's handwriting.
It is difficult to put in words the grounds for one's opinion as 
to the merit of a botanist who was mainly a collector.
Much may 
be merely fancy; but when we find critical forms of Mentha, 
Atriplex, Artemisia, Statice and Arctium separated, though in many 
cases not named, we shall probably not be wrong in classing Dale 
with his friend Buddie as one of the first critical students of our 
British Flora.
As a specimen of his work I will quote the label of 
the specimen of Orchis militarU in his herbarium, the only record 
that I know of its occurrence in Essex : —

The 
armes thighs and spur behind are purple the body slender and 
paler, but springled with deeper spots.

So carefully drawn up are the tickets, of which this is a speci- 
men, that they not only far surpass those of any of his predecessors, 
but also may possibly have been those " Elucubrationes Botanic® " 
alluded to in the preface to the first edition of the   Pharmacologia,' 
and have been destined for incorporation in the ' History of English 
Plants,' the manuscript of which is not known to exist.
A somewhat dingy oil-painting of the botanist is preserved at 
Apothecaries' Hall ; but, though his reputation has become similarly 
dim in the lapse of time, 1 trust that my researches, in which I 
have received great assistance from many friends, but especially 
from the officers of the British Museum, may have shown that 
there yet remains much of value in the life and writings of 
Samuel Dale.

TWO RECENT ADDITIONS to the BRITISH MOSSES.
By H.
Boswell.
Bryum gemmiparum Notaris.
— Three or four weeks ago I 
received from the Rev. Augustin Ley some specimens of a Bryum 
which he had just found on the banks, or rather in the bed, of the 
Usk in Breconshire, and a great puzzle it proved.
The first 
aspect was somewhat that of B.
SchleicJieri or latifolium in a 
dwarfish state, but the form and structure of the leaf were quite 
different when brought under the microscope.
Large forms of 
Webera albicans /3.
ylacialis [Br. glaciale Schleich.) are said to bear 
a resemblance to B.
Schleicheri ; but with the best endeavours to 
make them agree it was evident that there was a great discrepancy 
between the descriptions of B.
glaciale and the moss in hand; 
moreover it did not resemble albicans at all.
The leaves were in 
outline and structure a good deal like those of B.
Muhlenbeckii, but 
the habit and aspect of the plant as well as the place of growth 
were very different, and as the details accorded with no other 
known British species it became necessary to seek farther.
Even- 
tually I found it to be identical with B.
gemmiparum Not., a quite 
unexpected and very interesting addition to our flora, as it is 
hitherto only recorded for the extreme south of Europe — Provence, 
Italy, Sardinia, and the Attic mountains.
As yet no fruit has been 
found, and it is to be feared that it will prove to be one more of 
those mosses which remain M in Britannia sterilis," fruiting only 
in warmer latitudes.
Sphagnum Torreyanum Sulliv.
— Another moss of consider- 
able interest, new not only to Britain but to Europe, was found by 
Mr. Ley and myself during a ramble in North Shropshire last 
summer, growing in pits of deep water in bogs near Whitchurch.
This is the Sphagnum Torreyanum of Sullivant's 'Icones,' reduced

234 ON ALLIOSPORA, A SUPPOSED NEW GENUS OF DEMATDEI.
by later writers, including Dr. Braithwaite, to the rank of a variety 
of S.
cuspidatum, which is no doubt its proper position.
It is larger 
and more robust than any of the other forms of that variable 
species, with stout erect stems standing well up out of the water, 
and students of the tribe may expect to meet with it in similar 
situations; for on sending a specimen to Mr. Whitehead he at once 
identified it with others which he had gathered before on Risley 
Moss, near Warrington, but had not determined.
These, however, 
are a trifle less robust, and might easily be passed as merely large 
jAumosum.
The Shropshire specimens are identical with those I 
have from N.
America, where alone this Sphagnum had hitherto 
been found.
Another of Sullivant's figures represents a very similar plant, 
from California, called Sph. Mendocinuvi ; this is treated by Dr.
Braithwaite as identical with the above, while Messrs.
Kau & 
Harvey in their Catalogue assign it the position of a distinct 
species.
I have not seen this, and so have no opinion to give ; 
the figure shows little difference.
ON ALLIOSPORA, A SUPPOSED NEW GENUS OF 
DEMATIEL 
By Greenwood Pim, M.A., F.L.S.
Early 
Sapu9aya-nut kernel.
To the naked eye it presented a velvety 
appearance, intensely brown-black in colour, and resembling a 
small dark Aspergillus.
Under the microscope, however, the 
necklaces of spores, instead of being attached spore to spore, 
arose from delicate threads, somewhat like Haplaria.
I showed a 
specimen at a meeting of the Dublin Microscopical Club, in whose 
Proceedings a note of it appears, under the title of Alliospora 
Sapucaya, the name Alliospora being in allusion to the arrange- 
ment of the spores resembling hanks of onions.
A young crop 
shortly appeared on the nut, which was placed in a damp 
atmosphere.
These resembled Aspergillus in every respect, and 
showed no appearance of the before-mentioned threads.
Owing to 
circumstances I was unable to pursue the development of this 
curious plant, and it was only a few weeks since that I was able to 
further examine the specimens in my cabinet.
I then found that 
what I had taken for the simple globose head of an Aspergillus was 
of more complex structure than I at first imagined.
On the top 
of a long slender hypha, with very strongly thickened walls, 
is seated a small globose columella, areolate on the surface ; from 
this arise a great number of very much elongated basal cells, 
which by mutual pressure form a solid layer outside the columella, 
and nearly twice its diameter in thickness.
From the ends 
of these basidia, if I may so call them, arise the sponferous 
threads, which appear to be in general simple and septate till just 
AND

at the extremity, where four or five short branches form a little 
umbel.
The tips of these branches produce spores by division, as 
in Penicillium.
_ Such a structure will not, I think, come under any of the 
existing genera of Hyphomycetes ; hence I venture to propose a new 
one as follows :

onions, globose, '0002 inch ; purple-brown.

ARUM MACULATUM AND ITS CROSS-FERTILIZATION.
By Robert Miller Christy and Henry Corder.
Most of the following observations have been made by both of 
us in common, but our respective names are attached to any special 
one which seemed to require it.
We are aware that many of our 
observations are not new, although we believe that some of them 
are so.
In any case so few persons seem to be aware of the inte- 
resting peculiarities connected with this plant that we make no 
excuse for describing them in detail.
Laying up during the summer a large stock of nutritious matter 
in its great tuberous corm, the Arum forms underground during 
the autumn its next year's leaves and spathe, and is thus ready to 
appear above ground as soon as the frosts of winter have taken 
their departure.
So early indeed does it make its appearance, 
that we believe we are correct in saying that, if not quite, it is very 
nearly the first plant which puts its leaves above ground in the 
spring time.
Dr. Bromfield states that he has "even remarked 
them springing up at the close of autumn at Bonchurch." During 
a mild winter they may often be seen in the month of January, or 
even earlier.* These leaves have a very rapid growth, and the 
three or four which each plant bears reach their full size about the 
beginning or middle of April, according to the season.
The petioles 
are whitish, with a delicate tinge of pink at the bottom, and are 
enclosed in a sheath of four parts, which are in pahs, opposed to 
* Thus we found plenty appearing above ground on the 26th of December, 
1881, at Chelmsford, and at Saffron Walden on the 1st of January following; 
and at the latter place on December 80th, 1888, many were already two inches 
above ground.
After a severe winter, however, they do not appear so early.
On the 22nd of February, 1880, many were about five inches high ; and on the 
18th of the same month in the following year, after a hard and late winter, some 
at Bardfield were only about two inches high, though others at Walden on the 
28th were six inches.
236 ARUM MACULATUM AND ITS CROSS-FERTILIZATION.
one another, and all of a greenish colour bluntly pointed.
The 
tips of one pair sometimes appear a little above the ground, while 
the other two are generally an inch or so below.
The leaves are 
smooth and shining, of a dark green colour, and always more or 
less arrow-shaped ; but they are subject to a great deal of variation 
in this particular.
The younger the plant the more oval the leaf, 
and only the older plants exhibit the truly hastate pattern.
On 
their first appearance the young leaves are of a yellowish colour, 
but they very quickly open and acquire their proper tint.
The 
spots on its leaves, from which the species takes its name, are also 
extremely variable — indeed by far the larger number of the plants 
one meets with do not exhibit the slightest trace of spotting ; but 
in the Isle of Wight, Dr. Bromfield says, " The varieties with 
spotted and plain leaves are almost equally common, and grow 
intermixed.
,r Eeichenbach seems to have considered the spotted 
and plain leaves as proving the existence of two species, but this 
character is of no specific value whatever.
We have not been able to observe any particular conditions under 
which the plants usually produce either spotted or plain leaves, and 
do not at all know to what to attribute the difference.
In the neigh- 
bourhood of Saffron Walden Mr. Christy has observed that the two 
forms do not generally grow intermixed, although they occasionally 
do so; and he can remember once finding a single plant with large 
dark spots growing among a great number of unspotted ones.
He 
has further observed that the plants growing together in one spot 
often bear a greater or less resemblance to one another in the manner 
of their spotting, for there is as great variety in the nature and 
appearance of the spots as in their number and intensity.
We 
have sometimes thought that the spotted leaves are rather later in 
appearing than the plain ones, but this may not be so.
Spots 
certainly are not in any way a mark of the age of the plant.
Dr.
Bromfield writes, " In this island I can perceive no difference in 
the time of flowering, and the leaves of both are alike variable in 
size and shape.
The spotted form would appear to be rarer towards 
the north, where, as in Sweden and Denmark, this variety is an 
entire str anger.' ' It seems then almost impossible to draw any 
conclusions from the presence or absence of the spots.
Sometimes 
the spots are small and specky, at others medium-sized or blotchy, 
even up to one inch in length, and not unfrequently they are 
arrow-shaped.
At times they are of a very dark colour, at others 
dull, as if half washed out.
They are always darkest on the upper 
surface of the leaf, and generally faint on the under.
Very often 
the part which they cover is more or less sharply concave above 
and convex below ; and on rare occasions we have seen such plants 
in which this peculiarity has been carried to an extreme, the leaves 
having borne many dark-coloured medium-sized roundish spots, 
and being so indented on the top and bulged out below where the 
spots were that they suggested the idea of their having been struck 
by a charge of large shot possessing sufficient force to cause a deep 
indent but not to go right through.
In many cases these hollows 
were more than half as deep as they were broad.
In such speci

237 
mens, as also occasionally in less spotted ones, the spots are often 
faintly developed on the leaf- stem, and the wing or ribbon which it 
bears, but never on the sheath ; and it is observable that the spots 
which appear on their spathes are always bulged inwards ; so that 
if a spathe may be regarded as a modified leaf, it may further be 
regarded as one rolled backwards.
We have generally noticed these 
very darkly marked specimens, which are often very handsome 
objects, growing in woods, but, as a rule, we believe that they are 
generally unspotted in such situations.
We have not unfrequently 
observed unspotted leaves to be faintly marked along the veins with 
a pale milky white colour.
Although the growth of the leaves is so rapid, that of the 
spathe is extremely slow, and the former have often arrived 
at maturity before the latter has grown itself free of the wing 
of the inner leaf which wraps it round.
Nevertheless the spathe 
and all its contents are fully formed long before the leaves 
appear above the surface of the ground, and may easily be found by 
digging up an entire plant during the winter, when it will be dis- 
covered as a small tightly rolled-up spike about one inch in length, 
situated slightly above the root and in the centre of the stem; but, 
if opened, the floral organs will be found to be fully formed, although 
of course very small.
At this period all is of a yellow colour, like 
the leaves on their first appearance, except the spot and the 
anthers, which latter are generally of a bright orange.
Gradually 
the whole flower grows and elongates, until the tip of the spathe 
emerges from between the tops of two side wings of the inner leaf- 
etem.
A long while then elapses before the whole spathe appears, 
but by the time it is quite free it is almost of its full size, though 
still tightly rolled up ; and although the sunlight has never reached 
the spadix or anthers, these are already of their proper colour.
The stalk continues to grow until it reaches a length of about two 
inches, and the tip of the spathe is rather higher than the leaves.
At this stage a halt is made for some days, and although apparently 
quite fully formed and ready to open, it does not do so.
As show- 
ing the slowness of development of the spathe, we may remark that 
one Mr. Christy observed on January 15th, 1882, with its tip 1£ 
inches above ground, did not open until April 6th.
The date of the 
first opening of the spathes, like that of the first appearance of the 
leaves, seems to vary much according to the season.
Thus in 
1880 and 1881 Mr. Christy found them first on May 5th and 8th 
respectively, but on the Cth of April in 1882, and about the 23rd in 
1883, after mild winters.
In about a month from the appearance 
of the first ones there are very few to be found out unwithered.
Six inches would perhaps be about the average total length of a 
spathe, but we have on some occasions seen much larger ones ; 
one, for instance, 9f in.
long and 8$ in.
broad, while two others we 
have measured 10 and 11 in.
long.
It is a curious fact that the 
spathes are rolled up indifferently either way— either dextrally or 
sinistrally — in about equal numbers.
The long period of quiescence preceding the opening of the 
spathe is followed by a short one of great activity and interest ; 
238 , ARUM MACULATUM AND ITS CROSS-FERTILIZATION.
but, before describing this, we wish to speak as briefly as possible 
of the strange-looking flower which has unrolled itself suddenly 
before us in the course of an hour or two, presenting us with 
the well-known hood, with its sides wide apart, disclosing between 
them the brightly-coloured spadix, and tapering elegantly to a 
sharp point at the tip, which hangs slightly over forwards.
The more essential floral organs are concealed within the 
lower part of the spathe, which never opens, and which for con- 
venience we will term the "bulb." The spathe itself is nearly 
always of a pale green, but, like the leaves, it is often spotted, and 
a spotted spathe almost invariably accompanies a spotted leaf.
As 
a rule, there are fewer spots on the former than on the latter, 
although the spots on the spathe partake generally of a good deal 
of the nature of those on.
the leaves, and on both they may be dis- 
covered as small purple specks in their very earliest stages, long 
before they appear above ground.
The spathes are often very 
handsome objects, and exhibit colouring which the leaves never 
possess.
Thus the tip is generally shaded with a strong vinous 
tinge ; the inside of the bulb, especially round the neck, is often of 
a fine reddish purple, and the extreme edge is nearly always 
coloured, even in specimens otherwise plain.
The most beautiful 
form we have yet seen is an unspotted one deeply shaded with 
claret, as if it had been dipped in colour and hung upside down to 
dry — the colour being most intense at the tip, the lower part being 
pale yellowish green.
The shape of the spathe is subject to a good 
deal of variation.
Those growing in hedgerows and other rather 
dry situations are generally small, short, and rounded, whilst those 
growing in moister and more luxurious spots, such as woods, are 
larger, longer, and more tapering towards the point.
It seems to 
be a matter of no importance to the plant whether the opening of 
the spathe faces the light or not, and those growing on a bank often 
face directly towards it.
The reproductive organs of the plant are arranged round a 
central column in the bottom of the bulb, and are of a peculiar 
nature.
The ovaries, generally thirty to forty in number, are 
lowermost, and as a rule they are white, but sometimes are 
purple at their tips, which are furnished with a small tuft or brush 
of stigmatic bristles to catch the pollen.
A few of the upper 
ovaries are modified and converted into short hairs.
Shortly 
above these come the anthers, which are sessile, forty or fifty 
in number, and often of a fine purplish red, though sometimes 
muddy yellow.
Above these again, after another short interval, 
come a number of fine, slender, tapering filaments from £ to £ in.
long, white at the base, but often tipped with purple, extending 
outwards and slightly downwards, and situated in the narrowest 
part of the neck of the bulb, which they almost fill.
Above these 
rises an upright straight cylindrical column, which shortly enlarges 
and forms the curious elongated club-shaped spadix.
This is hard 
and brittle, and is generally of a fine bright purplish red, but it 
varies to pale muddy yellow.
It usually partakes of the same 
colour as the anthers, and those flowers which have it most

intensely coloured generally have the inside of the bulb of the 
same tint ; but we have not been able to observe that the colour 
of the spadix has any connection with the amount of spotting on 
the leaves or with any other peculiarity of the plant.
During the period in which the mature spathe remains un- 
opened it is often subjected to the attacks of some animal 
presumably a rabbit.
We have repeatedly observed this in more 
than one locality, and especially in woods ; the number of flowers 
destroyed by this means must be considerable.
We have never 
known the leaves to be eaten, and as the tip or side of the spathe 
is rubbed off and nothing but the spadix is taken, it is evident that 
the extraction of this is the real object of the animal.
That this 
should be eaten seems rather peculiar, for to us it is poisonous ; 
and a very small piece, if placed in the mouth, produces most 
unpleasant effects, being so pungent that it causes the lips and 
tongue to sting sharply for some time after — often an hour or more.
As to the time of day when the spathes open, there seems to be 
some doubt.
Very fresh-looking ones may often be seen in the 
early morning, and indeed at all times of the day ; but Mr. Corder 
is convinced that the majority open in the ,e veiling about 5 or 6 
o'clock.
This is certainly true of a number which we have ob- 
served growing, and of others which we have gathered and kept in 
water ; but it is quite certain that all do not open at this time, and 
it is even probable that some open during the night.
Immediately following upon the unrolling of the spathe some of 
the most curious circumstances take place which occur in connection 
with any plant in this country.
The spadix at once begins to emit 
a strong smell, which to the senses of some people (Mr. Corder 
among them) presents itself as rather sweet and sickly, though not 
particularly objectionable ; but to the majority of persons it is a 
disgusting stench when smelt close at hand.
Fortunately it is not 
of power sufficient to spread itself on the air, but two or three 
spathes are enough to make a good- sized room smell very dis- 
agreeably.
The spathes seem to open and emit their scent as well 
in plucked flowers as in growing ones, and some have continued to 
smell in water until at least 10 o'clock at night.
There is another peculiar phenomenon which is pretty much 
contemporaneous and co- existent with the smelling, namely, the 
emission of heat from the spadix,* which even makes the whole 
* To what temperature above that of the atmosphere the club of the spadix 
may be raised by this natural heat we are unable to say, on account of our not 
having used a thermometer suited to the purpose.
The following figures were 
taken by cutting a portion out of the side of the club, and pressing into it the 
bulb of a small common thermometer (F.); but it is obvious that to obtain the 
cornet temperature an instrument should be used small enough to be inserted 
into the centre of the club, as the evaporation from a wound is likely to lower 
previously existing temperature.
The scent is certainly sometimes given out 
after the spadix lias cooled.
I \>r instance, one spathe was fully opened, smelling 
a little and slightly warm at ( .) p.m. on April 6th, 1882; early in the morning of 
the next day the heat was gone, but the smell continued, and a trace of it even 
remained until the following day, when the pollen was being shed.
In most 
spathes the smell does not last so long as this, but as the plant was growing in- 
doors it probably continued to smell longer through want of fertilization.

lower part of the spathe perceptibly warm, so that on thrusting 
the bulb of a small thermometer down into it the mercury is raised 
five or six degrees.
The following are some of the temperatures of 
different individuals, which we have taken for several years past 
with common thermometers :

The best of these observations show that the spadix was from 
12° to 30° above that of the atmosphere, and these readings 
would unquestionably have been higher had better means been 
taken to ascertain the truth.
Prof.
Henslow says, " The spadix of 
the common Arum attains a temperature of 7° R.
or 47|° F.
above 
that of the atmosphere* and the Arum cordifolium in the Mauritius 
has been observed to obtain a temperature of 44° to 49° R.
or 131 
to 142° F„ that of the surrounding air being at 19° R.
or 47f° F.
These effects take place only once for each plant." During the 
time of heat the spadix is, we believe, more pungent than at other 
times, and it seems to be giving out much moisture ; for if laid 
upon a table or piece of glass, it quickly damps it as with steam.
These interesting phenomena are, as Prof.
Henslow remarks, 
doubtless produced by some chemical action ; but, leaving this 
point for a brief mention hereafter, we will pass on to the results 
which follow from them.

A New British Plant.— Najas major AIL— On the 21st of July

once recognised as Najas major.
Further search showed it to be

Hybernacula of Utricularia intermedia.
— Writing of the 
occurrence of this plant in Mayo and Galway, Mr. H.
C. Hart says 
(Proc.
Eoyal Irish Academy, 2nd ser., iii., 700):— " This plant 
forms hybernacula, and if the fragile stem be lifted gently and 
traced through the mud with the fingers for the root, a little 
tuberous formation about the size of a bean will usually be found at 
the end of the stem.
This habit is not mentioned in the British 
text-books, but Mr. Baker informs me that there are specimens 
exhibiting these hybernacula at Kew. I have seen undeveloped 
leaf-buds of U.
vulgaris at the end of the summer, although not so 
dense ; and Darwin says these " fall off and lie dormant during the 
winter at the bottom, " In U.
intermedia they remain attached, and 
from the point at which the arrested growth recommences the 
following season.
Such a means of living is the more necessary to 
the present species, since it rarely seeds itself/ 1

Wexford coast, but is hardly, as I think, native.
The present 
habitat, which is quite satisfactory, is perhaps the southernmost 
limit of its indigenous ran<*e in Ireland.
In the same locality I 
also observed Salvia Verbenaca, apparently at its northernmost 
habitat.

VEGETATION OF COQUIMBO.
[We are indebted to Mr. John Ball for the following abstract 
of a letter recently received by him from Prof.
F. Philippi.] 
Professor Frederick Philippi, the son of the veteran explorer of 
Chili, has lately returned from a very interesting excursion in the 
province of Coquinibo, still imperfectly known to naturalists.
Although Coquimbo lies but a short distance north of Valparaiso — 
the province extends from about 29° S.
to 31° S.
— it is known that 
the climate is remarkably different, as its northern border is on 
the verge of the so-called rainless zone, and the annual rainfall in 
the coast region ranges from five to ten inches only.
In the low 
country near Ovalle on the river Limari the vegetation consists 
mainly of Cactem and shrubby Composite, with a few fruticose 
representatives of other natural orders, of which Cord i a decant Ira 
is mentioned as especially ornamental.
Herbaceous vegetation is 
extremely scanty, and scarcely to be found except in spring.
From Ovalle Prof.
Philippi proceeded to visit a range of hills 
running parallel to the coast, which is named on Peterniann's map 
Altos de Talin« y and tinted as extending from 500 to 1000 metres 
in height.
try 
JExto 
of Frai Jorje, and the height is estimated by Mr. Philippi at about 
1500 metres.
During the greater part of the year the summit is 
covered with a stratum of fog which extends downward for a few T 
hundred feet, and then abruptly ceases.
On making the ascent 
he found to his surprise that the upper part, exactly coinciding 
with the limit of the fog, for a distance of 8 or 9 miles in length 
and varying from half a mile to three miles in breadth, is covered 
with wood of a character exactly agreeing with the forests about 
Valdivia in the rainy region of southern Chili, about ten degrees 
farther south.
The prevailing tree is ~ 
abundance of mosses and southern ferns, including Aspleniuhi 
magettariwum.
In descending the mountain Prof.
Philippi was 
struck by the extreme abruptness of the change in the vegetation 
on emerging from the fog zone.
u A few steps farther down," as 
he states, he found Pourretias, Haplopappas, and other species of 
the arid region.
The existence of such southern plants in this 
region is of course explained by the constant fogs supplying 
moisture and screening them from intense solar radiation; the 
difficulty, as he justly remarks, is to account for the transport of 
so many species over a wide area affording, so far as we know, no 
resting-place in the present conditions of climate.
Some species 
may possibly have extended along the range of the Andes and 
thence been carried to the coast, and it is possible that when the 
migration of birds on the western side of the continent is more

fully known some further light may be thrown on the subject.
As the season advanced Prof.
Philippi turned his course to the 
portion of the Cordillera range lying near the sources of the river 
Vacuna, and was able to make very interesting botanical collections 
which probably include several new forms.
But of even greater 
interest are the geological observations made by him during this 
excursion.
Excepting at one point, where they are broken by the 
protusion of a pyroxenic rock, Prof.
Philippi found this portion of 
the Andes to be entirely composed of stratified deposits, and at a 
height of about 4500 metres he found a bed of Jurassic fossils, of 
which specimens were secured.
The more detailed account of this interesting expedition which 
Professor Philippi will doubtless give to the public will be anxiously 
awaited by naturalists in Europe.

The Fertilisation of Flowers.
By Prof.
Hermann Muller.
Trans- 
lated and edited by D'Arcy W.
Thompson, B.A., Scholar of 
Trin.
Coll., Cambridge.
With a Preface by Charles Darwin.
With Illustrations.
London : Macmillan & Co., 1883 ; pp.
x. 669.
Prof.
Hermann Muller, of Lippstadt, has long earned for him- 
self the first place among the observers of those relationships 
between the needs of insects for obtaining honey from flowers and 
the needs of plants for having their pollen conveyed from flower to 
flower, which have thrown such a flood of light on the structure of 
both insects and flowers.
It needed a trained entomologist and 
botanist in one, and at the same time a man of keen powers of 
observation and unwearied industry, to solve the problems which 
arose in each separate case of mutual adaptation — a task which 
has been performed with astonishing success in Mutter's two great 
works,   Die Befruchtung der Blumen durch Insekten ' and ' Alpen- 
blumen, ihre Befruchtung durch Insekten.' Mr. D'Arcy Thompson 
now presents us with a translation of the former of these two works, 
in which he has inserted also references to, or very short abstracts 
of, the results recorded in the second of them also.
A fuller 
account of these would have made the work a more complete 
record of our present state of knowledge regarding the part played 
by insects in the fertilisation of flowers.
The families of insects concerned in the fertilisation of flowers 
are mainly four, viz.
:— in the order of their importance (1), 
Hymenoptera, chiefly Apidae; (2) Diptera, chiefly Syrphidse ; 
(3) Lepidoptera ; (4) Coleoptera.
The special adaptations of struc- 
ture of the insects belonging to these groups for the obtaining of 
nectar and pollen, and for the transmission of pollen, are most 
clearly described by Prof.
Muller in the introductory portion of his 
work, the understanding of the text being aided by admirable 
NOTICES OF BOOKS.
' 249 
drawings of the various parts concerned of the different insects.
The greater part of the volume is then occupied with a description 
of every species of plant observed by the author, as far as regards 
its floral structure, with special reference to its adaptation to the 
visits of insects ; and to this is appended a list of all the insects 
observed by him to visit this particular species.
A mass of 
observation is thus accumulated which is invaluable to the student 
of this most interesting branch of Natural History.
It is not too 
much to say that every page teems with information of the most 
interesting and valuable kind.
And, vast as is Prof.
M tiller's 
accumulation of facts, the ground yet unworked is vaster still, 
and is one in which every young naturalist of assured accuracy of 
observation can work.
It needs only some knowledge of insects 
and of flowers, a collecting vasculum and a pair of fly-catching 
forceps, a drawing-block and a pencil, and an addition to our store 
of knowledge may be gained.
This will be further increased by a 
compound microscope for the purpose of observing the more 
minute points of structure in both insect and flower, and the form 
and size of the pollen-grains found attached to the hairs on the 
body of the insect.
Mr. D'Arcy Thompson has rendered good service to the English 
naturalist unacquainted with German in this translation.
As far as 
we have observed, the rendering is faithful and accurate; and in one 
respect the English translation is decidedly superior to the original 
in the more scientific arrangement of the species described, following 
the system of Bentham & Hooker's * Genera Plantarum,' instead of 
the very unsatisfactory German classification, which begins with 
Juncacece and ends with Valerianacea.
The kindly preface from 
the pen of Mr. Darwin was one of the very last of his writings.
A 
most useful bibliography of the subject (which has also been issued 
separately) adds greatly to the value of the work.

have been felt by every working botanist who does not confine his 
studies to our British Flora.
Pritzel's * Index Iconum ' is a work 
hardly second to his * Thesaurus ' in usefulness, but while the 
latter work has been brought down to the end of 1880, by Mr. Jack- 
son's persevering labours, the former has received no addition since 
1866, nor do we hear that any further supplement is in contempla- 
tion.
What botanists feel with regard to figures of plants in 
general, Mr. Edmund Tonks felt with regard to the * Botanical 
Magazine' in particular; and, the Index now before us having 
been prepared " by an enthusiastic naturalist, Mr. Henry Buckley, 
his own use," he undertook to edit it and bring it before the 
for 
public.
and

work will no doubt be useful to the country gentlemen and others 
who have sets of the   Botanical Magazine ' upon their shelves.
The volume is well printed, every other page being blank, to allow 
of the interlineation of additions.
But we regret that he did not see 
his way to following the advice of M the authorities at Kew," who 
said " that to be a creditable performance the index should be 
revised by a competent botanist/ ' Mr. Tonks frankly tells us 
"that he is not a botanist, but only a lover of plants"; and his 
having " taken some liberties with the names M is evidence of this, 
as well as his justification of this line of conduct by the statement 
that " botanists' nomenclature is very curious, and apparently 
limited by no rules " !
One or two instances of the mode of treatment adopted will 
serve to give an idea of the insufficiency of the book.
Mr. Tonks 
says that the editors have " frequently made the mistake of 
re-illustrating plants already depicted in their own work." Open- 
ing his Index at random we find what seems at first sight to be an 
instance of this — 
14 Cypripedium parvifiorum 22, 911 
57, 3024.
»» 
But on consulting the text to plate 3024 we find that " C.
juirvi- 
florum of Old Series of Bot. Mag.
t. 911, should assuredly be 
referred to C.
pubescens" A botanist would have noticed this 
correction, but Mr. Tonks, naturally enough, has not done so; so 
that his Index contains two references to (\ parvijlnrum, while C.
pubescens is altogether omitted.
Coburgia trichromat again, figured on 
t. 8867, was repeated on t.
5686, not through any " mistake/' but 
because the earlier plate "gives so little idea of its size and beauty 
that another figure [was] absolutely required." No doubt in 
some cases Mr. Tonks's censure is deserved, as in that of luyonut 
Wayeneriana, figured on t.
4988, and again on t.
5047.
The index of synonyms, as given in the same 107 volumes, also 
suffers from want of botanical supervision.
A botanist would not 
have passed as a synonym such a fragment of an old descriptive 
phrase as " Alsine forte ;" and would have discriminated between 
useful synonymy and.
such as is practically useless.
Nor can we 
commend the "Index of Popular Names." "Fair Maids of 
France/' for instance, is not a popular name for the genus Ranun- 
culus, as Mr Tonks seems to imply, but only for one species, 
R. aconitifoliiiSj fl.
pi.
We cannot help feeling sorry that Mr. Tonks did not add to 
hi* Preface a sketch of the history of the   Botanical Magazine.' 
Extending back, as it does, for nearly a century, such a sketch, 
with lists of the botanists and artists engaged upon the work, 
would have been both useful and interesting, and would have added 
value to this General Index.
We are indebted to our correspondent, Mr. H.
C. Hart, for 
copies of two papers published by him in the last number (2nd 
Ser. vol.
hi.
(Science), no.
10, June, 1883) of the 'Proceedings of 
the Royal Irish Academy.' The first is entitled " Notes on the 
NOTICES OF BOOKS.
251 
Flora of Lambay Island, Co. Dublin," and is so evidently a 
complete catalogue of the plants of this small island that the two 
first words seem calculated to convey a false impression of the 
paper.
"Disregarding several subspecies or varieties, the flora 
consists of 291 flowering plants and ferns, of which 33 species are 
probably not native." An interesting comparison is instituted 
between the flora of this island on the east coast and that of Inish- 
Bofin on the west.
Mr. Hart's second paper is a " Report on the 
Flora of the mountains of Mayo and Galway." His most important 
find is Saxifraga ccespitosa, which " has rested hitherto as an Irish 
plant upon the evidence of an imperfect specimen from Brandon, 
gathered in 1829." Mr. Hart found this species upon Muckanaght, 
one of the Twelve Bens, or " Twelve Pins," as they are popularly 
called, of Connemara ; and his identification has been confirmed by 
Mr. Baker.
His notes upon the vertical range and distribution 
of certain plants are full of interest.
With regard to the range 
of Saxifraga umbr&sa, however, Mr. Hart points out in a letter to 
us, that the statement that it " never descends lower than 1700 or 
1800 feet in the Tipperary and Waterford range " requires qualifi- 
cation, inasmuch as he has found it in or near the river-courses at 
600 or 700 feet above sea-level — a correction which we are able to 
corroborate from our own observation.
We extract a note from 
this paper at p.
246, and regret that we have not space for further 
notice of this interesting contribution to our knowledge of Irish 
plants.
Mr. Van Voorst (Paternoster Row, E.C.) has issued two pages 
of   Addenda to the Eighth Edition of Babington's Manual of 
British Botany/ which may be obtained on application by pos- 
sessors of the work.
Descriptions are given of Selitmm Carrifolia, 
Spartina Townsendi, Agrostis nigra, and Lycopodium complanatum, 
and various corrections are made.
" Ringwood Chase, near Lud- 
low, 1 * is given as a locality for Epipogum aplujllum.
We are glad to learn that Mr. Alfred Fryer is engaged upon a 
Flora of Huntingdonshire, in which he will be glad of help.
His

The recently issued part of the ' Proceedings of the Bristol 
Naturalists' Society ' contains a further instalment (the Co roll i flora) 
of the 'Flora of the Bristol Coal-field, 1 as well as the sixth part of 
Mr. Cedric Bucknall's < Fungi of the Bristol District.' In the 
latter are descriptions of two new species — Peziza Arctii Phillips, 
Stictis pteridina Phill.
& Buck.
We would suggest that the extracts 
from Sir J.
E. Smith, and similar notes upon the general history 
of the species, might well be omitted.
Two recently-issued parts (iv.

'The Westbury House School Ephemeris' is a little monthly 
journal issued by a school at Worthing in which commendable 
prominence is given to local Natural History.
We would beg our 
young friends, however, to refrain from publishing new and un-

attention to the spelling of proper names.

for his own use, and has been put in type for the benefit of those 
specially interested in the Chinese Flora, to whom it cannot fail to 
be useful.

— Mr. W.
T. T.
Dyer exhibited several 
interesting vegetable economic products, and made remarks thereon.
Of a species of wax extracted by Mr. D.
Morris, of Jamaica, from 
Myrica microcarpa, it was stated that while the berries are used for 
obtaining wax in South Africa, the West Indian fruits had not 
hitherto been used for this purpose.
Of a grey camphor-like 
substance, the product of Artemisia Moxa, he mentioned such to be 
a rare example among the Composite ; and there was a proba- 
bility that this camphor was that used in the production of Indian 
ink by the Chinese, and which gave the peculiar aromatic odour 
to the true China ink.
A Rosary made of fruits of Trapa verban- 
ends de Not.
(locally called Frutti de Lago) from the Lago di 
Varese, Italy, had been purchased for one franc ; specimen of wax 
and candles made from Rhus vemicifera of Japan ; the latter 
preparation is quite a local industry which unfortunately is now 
ceasing on account of the rivalry of the cheap American oils.
— A 
paper was read by Mr. R.
A. Bolfe, of Kew, " On the Selaginese 
described by Linnaeus, Bergius, Linnaeus fil., and Thunberg." In 
working up a monograph of this neglected order it has been found 
that the species of the early writers have been entirely misunder- 
stood.
This has partly arisen from the imperfect descriptions and 
absence of authentic specimens ; likewise from certain species 
being excessively local leading to wrong names being applied ; — 
thus Hebenstreitia dentata L., and Selago fruticosa L.
were unknown 
to Thunberg, though he applied the names to very different plants ; 
and other instances similar in kind could be mentioned.
The author 
has adopted a chronological order in treating of his subject as being 
most convenient.
He has noted the condition of the original 
specimens preserved in herbaria, and what has been done with 
each by the later writers.
Choisy's monograph in the 12th volume 
of De Candolle's * Prodromus ' (1848) is taken as the latest revision 
of the order.
The Selagineae of Bergius in Stockholm, of Thun- 
berg' s in Upsala, and of Choisy's types in Berlin, have kindly been 
placed at the author's disposal by Professors Warming, Fries, and 
Eichler, and a careful comparison been made of all the specimens 
in the herbaria of the British Museum and Kew, some of the old 
types in the former collection being especially interesting.

BERMUDA PLANTS IN THE SLOANE COLLECTION,

writin 
published at p.
104, an article on the scope of the forthcoming 
volume on the Botany of the ' Challenger' Expedition,* and other 
articles!
on the vegetation of the Bermudas and the Bermuda 
Cedar, I have more fully studied the flora of the islands, and the 
result is a considerable modification of my views respecting the 
endemic element.
The number of apparently endemic species now 
known is still small: yet one at least, a palm, is a conspicuous 
feature in the vegetation.
When I wrote the article on the Cedar, 
my opinion, based upon the fact that no wild specimens of it 
from any other country existed in the general herbaria at Kew and 
the British Museum, was that it was endemic.
The only specimen 
in the General Herbarium at the British Museum from the West 
Indies is from Antigua, and was collected by De Poiithieu, who 
wrote the following memorandum on his label:— " Brought here 
from the Bermudas, and not common." This, together with the 
fact that all the specimens of Cedar is the two herbaria from the 
West Indies are the Red Cedar, Junipa ~ " 
j ustify 
Nevertheless the Bermuda Cedar is not endemic, as I am able to 
show through the kindness of Mr. Carruthers and Mr. Britten, who 
took the trouble to look up in the Sloane Collection not only the 
original specimens of Juniper described and figured by Plukenet, 
Petiver, and Sloane, but also all the Bermuda plants which form 
the subject of this paper.
The existence of Jumper* bennudiana 
in Jamaica has quite lately been confirmed by a parcel of Juniper- 
berries sent to Sir J.
D. Hooker.
. 
The Bermuda plants in the Sloane Collection are only seven 
in number, yet among them are my Erigeron Darrellianiis [see 
p. 104) and a species of Carex (H.
S. xxxii.
(Herb.
Sloan, xxxu.

mudiana (H.

figure.- These plants were collected by a Mr. J.
Dickinson + 
about 1699, and are, we believe, the oldest specimens of the 
vegetation of the islands in existence.
In the narratives of the 
early voyagers we find records of a Palm, a Cedar (Juniperus), 
Prickly Pear (Opuntia), and a few other plants ; but F.
A. 
Michaux was the first botanist who visited the islands and pub- 
lished an account J of the plants.
He particularly mentions the 
Palm (a species of Sabal), the Juniper, and Rhus Toxicodendron 
among the indigenous plants; and he enumerates the following 
European plants as being so common as to have all the appearance 
of being indigenous : — Verbascum Thapsus, Anagallis arvensis, Mer- 
curialis annua, Leontodon Taraxacum, Plantago major, Urtica urens, 
Medicago sp., Gentiana nana, and Oxalis Acetosella.
The two last 
should probably have been Erythraa and Oxalis corniculata.
But to return to Dickinson's plants.
It will be seen that, 
besides Erigeron Darrellianus and the Carex, he collected one other 
plant that has a claim to be regarded as indigenous, namely, 
Sisyrinchium Bermudiana.
Michaux, it is true, does not mention 
it ; but he being a prisoner of war on board an English man-of- 
war, had only, through the kindness of the commander, oppor- 
tunities for two or three short walks.
It is now spread all over 
the islands, and is one of the commoner flowering plants.
Its 
claim to be regarded indigenous rests upon the fact that the variety 
found in the islands is distinct from the various forms of the species 
widely spread in North America.
According to Baker, § it is the 
S. iridioides of Curtis (Bot. Mag.
t. 94), figured by Dillenius|| 
under Tournefort's designation Bermudiana iridis folio radice fibrosa.
This variety is taller and more robust than the others.
Most 
likely the species was originally conveyed to the islands, perhaps 
by seed in the mud sticking to the claws of a marsh-bird.
Certainly it is a good colonist in many countries, multiplying and 
spreading at a rapid rate.
It has established itself in various parts 
of South America, Mauritius, and Australia ; and in New Zealand,

on the authority of Dr. Hector, it is common on the hills near 
Wellington, where it forms a considerable part of the pasture, and 
is greatly relished by cows, yet able to maintain its ground and even 
to continue to spread.
The same species, it will be remembered, 
has been found in a wild state in several places in Ireland, though 
how it reached there is uncertain.
As already stated, the Sloane Collection contains specimens 
of Juniperus bermudiana from the West Indies.* The original J.
ber- 
mudiana was founded by Hermann t on a juvenile or sterile state 
raised from seed received from England, and reported as coming 
from the Bermudas.
All the evidence goes to show that Parlatore \ 
has given the correct synonymy of the species, and that he was 
right in regarding it as distinct from J.
virginiana.
The accom- 
panying woodcuts, kindly lent for reproduction by the editor of the 
1 Gardeners' Chronicle,' give a very good idea of the characteristics 
of J.
bermudiana, as well as the differences in the foliage of J.
virginiana.
The latter has much slenderer ultimate branchlets, 
smaller, more acute leaves, with a distinctly resinous gland on the 
bark ; and there appear to be very good distinctive characters in 
the fruits and seeds of the two species ; but these I have not yet 
been able to compare fully.
Sloane's specimens of J.
bermudiana 
are from Jamaica, § the Barbadoes and English gardens ; none from 
the Bermudas.
Erigeron Darrellianiis\\ (Tab. nostr.
259, fig.
1) is called u Hen 
Hogweed" on Dickinson's label in the Sloane Collection — "it grows 
amongst bushes and flowers in February and March " : and there is 
a second species of Erigeron, perhaps E.
linif otitis, on the same sheet 
and from the same country, named " Hogweed" simply.
Which of 
these two is intended by Plukenet 11 under the designation Eupatorium 
angastiorifolio Bermadense, &c, is uncertain : the figure is not a good 
representation of either.
The Carex is the most interesting plant in this collection, being 
the only specimen of the genus I have seen from the Bermudas.

It is very closely allied to the endemic St. Helena G.prmalta Boott.* ; 
but it is much slenderer, and probably not more than half as tall.
All the spikelets in our plant are sessile or subsessile, and the 
bracts are narrower ; and the glumes and utricules are dotted as 
in C.
aquabilis, another species endemic in St. Helena.
It seems, 
however, to be an undescribed species.
There are two culms, the 
large one bearing five spikelets in a rather advanced state, and two 
leaves.
The glumes and fruit have fallen away from the lower half 
of the lowermost spike.

I was at one time disposed to believe it probable that not a 
single species of plant had been lost to the islands since they were 
settled ; but the discovery of this Carex, which nobody, so far as I 
know, has collected since Dickinson, and various other circum- 
stances lead me now to a contrary conclusion.
A very obvious fact 
is the great rarity of a large proportion of the indigenous species.

Dr. J.
Rein's list of the flowering plants and ferns collected by 
himself in the islands, and which he seems to have regarded as 
tolerably complete, contains only 128 species, fifty of which at least 
are doubtless introduced plants.
My list comprises about 130 
indigenous species, besides about fifty others that may have reached 
the islands independently of the agency of man.
In addition there 
are about 130 certainly introduced species.
Many of the species 
that are in one collection do not occur in any other ; and it is very 
probable that a botanist would find a number of additional species 
in the marshes.

ARUM MACULATUM AND ITS CEOSS-FERTILIZATION.
By Eobekt Millek Christy and Henry Corder.
(Concluded from p.
240).
The powerful scent or the brightly- coloured spadix attract large 
numbers of a small species of fly,* which, after remaining for 
a moment on the inner surface of the spathe, fly down into 
the bulb, where they remain fast prisoners, securely shut in by 
the hairs at the mouth, which by pointing slightly downwards 
admit of their entrance but not of their exit.
The number of 
these flies thus caught is very variable in different flowers, but is 
often remarkably large.
We have both repeatedly opened spathes 
in which were fifty at least, and often far more ; for instance, 
among others, we have opened some which we have estimated to 
contain 70, 100, 100, 150, and 230 flies.
On the 1st of May, 1882, 
we found a large spathe during the morning, with the spadix cold 
and pollen shed, in which we actually counted no less than 365 
live flies and 12 dead ones, or 377 in all, the vast majority of which 
were of one species.
In another spathe we found 45 living and 53 
dead flies.
At first thought it seems difficult to say where such 
large numbers of these usually unnoticed insects can come from ; 
but they are so minute that they are very easily overlooked, and a 
few may generally be seen about near large numbers of Arums.
This species seems to be the only one which habitually frequents 
the flowers of A.
maculatum ; but most spathes contain one or two 
insects of other* sorts which have most likely got in by accident, 
such as small beetles, weevils, tiny flies, and other insects.
In 
more than one case we have observed dung-flies on the spathes, 
but these are probably too large to enter.
We have also noticed 
that slugs {IAmax agrestis) and spiders sometimes enter the bulb of 
the spathe — the former probably for shelter and the latter possibly 
for the flies.
The heat and smell seldom last more than a few 
hours — we believe about six or seven, or perhaps less.
Mr. Britten 
has kindly drawn our attention to a note in the   Phytologist , f in 
which Mr. G.
B. Wollaston records that his little boy was picking 
* H.
Miiller, in his • Fertilisation of Flowers' (see Thompson's English trans- 
lation, p.
562), states that the only insect he has found within the spathe of 
Arum maculatum is the small dipter, Psychodia phalcenoides, and that in great 
quantities; while Delpino has observed A.
italicum to be fertilized by six 
different flies belonging to the genera ^Ceratopogon, Chironomus, Sciara, 
Psychoda, Limosina, and Drosophila.
He thus describes the process of fer- 
tilisation : — " In the first stage of flowering the stigmas only, which are borne 
by the base of the spadix, are mature; a foul ammoniacal smell attracts the 
Psychodae into the prison, where they cross-fertilise the stigmas if they have 
come from other plants.
In the second stage the stigmatic papillte wither, and 
a drop of honey appears in the middle of each stigma.
In the third stage the 
anthers dehisce, and the greater part of their pollen falls upon the floor of the 
chamber; the insects dust themselves over and over with it, and finally, when 
the palisade of hairs withers in the fourth period, they pass out, and enter 
another flower in its first stage." — A.

ARUM MACULATUM AND ITS CROSS -FERTILIZATION.

Arums at Chiselhurst, and brought him one, exclaiming, " This 
thing in the middle is quite hot." He continues — " Finding that 
the warmth continued the whole of that and part of the next day, 
I tested it by applying both the spadix and spathe to the bulb of a 
good thermometer, and found that the clubby portion of the spadix 
was 71° Fahr..
whilst the spathe only 57^°, making a difference of 
18$°.
M A spathe seems to catch its full complement of flies 
very quickly — indeed they begin to enter as soon as ever the 
spathe is unrolled, and often before that operation is complete.
As it seems probable that they are attracted by the scent, 
perhaps assisted by the spadix (Sir John Lubbock makes no 
mention of the heat or smell, but says they enter " attracted 
by the showy central spadix, the prospect of shelter or of honey"), 
it follows that they must all be caught within a very short space 
of time.
The imprisoned flies have probably (as will hereafter be 
shown) brought pollen from some other Arum, which they are 
sure to deposit on the brushes of the stigmas whilst crawling 
about them and in the bottom of the bulb, up the sides of 
which they are unable to climb, and thus the cross-fertilization 
of the plant is accomplished.
These flies are peculiarly adapted 
for the carriage of pollen, having very hairy bodies and wings ; 
so that under the microscope they may often be seen to be covered 
with it.
Very shortly after the fertilization of the ovules the ovaries may 
already be observed to have begun to swell — even, we believe, 
before the pollen is shed.
They very quickly lose the brush of 
short hairs from their tips, and its place is afterwards occupied by 
a small round hole.
The ovides are now of course incapable of 
receiving any further fertilization, having received the great ad- 
vantage of crossing; and hereafter we shall give reasons for 
believing that this species has lost the power of self-fertilization.
At this stage a minute drop of liquid exudes from the hole in the 
tip of each ovary, and as we have sometimes seen flies greedily 
devouring this it is probably of the nature of nectar.
Shortly after 
this the anthers ripen, and as they burst the pollen is thrown down 
in abundance upon the flies, which, from being utterly unable to 
climb the extremely smooth sloping sides of the interior of the 
bulb, are compelled to congregate together in a heap at the bottom 
or on the ovaries (which they are able to ascend with difficulty), 
being in either case in a position in which the pollen must neces- 
sarily fall on them ; and as a matter of fact they may be seen to be 
covered with it.
We do not know any use for the lower circle of 
hairs, which are always more or less rudimentary, unless they 
are- to prevent the flies climbing up to the anthers and the space 
above them, where they would not receive the shower of pollen.
After this the filaments blocking the entrance to the bulb shrivel 
up, and the flies, escaping, carry the pollen away to some 
other recently-opened strong-smelling spathe, and, after ferti- 
lizing, its ovules go through exactly the same adventures as have 
already been described, being in the end dusted with fresh pollen, 
264 ARUM MACULATUM AND ITS CROSS- FERTILIZAtflOtt.
which, after again escaping, they perhaps carry to yet another 
dower.* 
According to Darwin, Fabricius and Sprengel both state that 
flies do not again escape from the flowers of dristolochia when 
they have once entered ; but this is obviously absurd, as in that 
case they could not possibly assist in the cross-fertilization.
It is perfectly certain that the majority of flies do escape, 
but it is equally certain that all do not do so.
The following 
very keen observation is given by Darwin.
t He says: — "On 
examining several spathes [of A.
maculatum] , from thirty to 
sixty minute Diptera belonging to three species were found in 
some of them ; and many of these insects were lying dead at the 
bottom, as if they had been permanently entrapped.
In order to 
discover whether the living ones could escape and carry pollen to 
another plant, I tied, in the spring of 1842, a fine muslin bag 
tightly round a spathe, and on returning in an hour's time several 
little flies were crawling about on the inner surface of the bag.
I 
then gathered a spathe, and breathed hard into it; several flies 
crawled out, and all without exception were dusted with Arum 
pollen.
These flies quickly flew away, and I distinctly saw three 
of them fly to another plant about a yard off ; they alighted on the 
inner or concave surface of the spathe, and suddenly flew down into 
the flower.
I then opened this flower, and although not a single 
anther had burst, several grains of pollen were lying at the bottom, 
which must have been brought by one of these flies or some other 
insect.
In another flower little flies were crawling about, and I 
saw them leave pollen on the stigmas." That some of the flies 
should die thus in the flower seems very strange, and suggests the 
idea that the plant may have some other object, besides its cross- 
fertilization, in view in thus entrapping the flies ; for it seems 
certain that every fly that dies in a flower lessens the chance of 
fertilization of all the neighbouring flowers, which would be 
prejudicial to the welfare of the species.
It is hard to say exactly 
what is the immediate cause of their death, but we do not ever 
remember to have noticed dead flies in any flower before the heat 
and smell had gone off ; most appear to die about the time of the 
secretion of the nectar, and certainly they often do so before the 
shedding of the pollen.
On the evening of April 12th, 1882, Mr.
Christy opened two flowers, both of which were devoid of heat or 
smell, but the pollen was not shed.
One contained about one 
hundred live flies, and the other thirty live and two dead ones.
Another flower, rather more advanced and with all the pollen shed, 
* It seems, from a note kindly sent us by Mr. Bennett, that (i.
KraUi has 
tested the elevation of temperature, &c, in Arum italicum, and found that a 
thermometer placed in the midst of five opening spathes rose from 17*?° to 
44*7° C.
The heating commenced at the apes, of the spadix.
where it was most 
considerable, and proceeded downwards.
The rise of temperature in the anther 
takes place much later, and is less considerable ; the stigmas experience no rise 
at all.
It would be interesting to compare the description of the means of fer- 
tilization of £rum mac ulatum, as given above, with the description of that of 
Aristolochia Clematitis, as given by Mr. Bennett (Pop. Sci.Kev. April, 1875, p.
113).

AHUM MACULATUM AND ITS CROSS -FERTILIZATION.

contained two live flies, and eight or ten dead ones lying at the 
bottom covered with pollen.
Most Arum flowers kill a few flies, 
and these may of course be found in them after the rest have 
escaped ; but some kill far more than others, and a few we have 
noticed have apparently killed all, as they contained sometimes as 
many as one hundred dead.
It seems to us rather like a piece of gratuitous kindness on 
the part of the Arum for it to secrete a drop of nectar for the 
flies just before their departure, "thus repaying the insects for 
their captivity," as Sir John Lubbock says ; for the flies can 
hardly enter the spathes for the sake of this honey, as it does 
not exist when they do so.
The plant, presumably, catches 
the insects by its odour, and therefore secures all it requires 
(supposing that it wants nothing but fertilization) ; and no one will 
imagine that it entertains feelings of such considerate kindness 
towards the insects as to pay them for their services which it must 
by this time be aware (so to speak) that it can obtain equally well 
without payment.
It may be, however, that during their captivity 
the insects require food, and the plant has to feed them to secure 
its own ends.
But if cold weather were to intervene, the secretion 
of the nectar would probably be retarded, and thus some of the 
insects might starve.
The fact, however, that most Arums kill 
some flies makes one think that they must have a definite object in 
so doing.
We do not wish to state our belief that this object is the 
obtaining of nutriment from the bodies of the dead flies, but an 
observation which Mr. Christy has made formerly led us to believe 
that this might possibly be the object.
He has frequently seen 
dead flies stuck to the tips of the ovaries after the rest had all 
escaped, and on several of these occasions he has plainly observed 
that these flies' bodies had been by some means or other drawn 
partly into the hole at the tip.
Sometimes the wings of the flies 
have been drawn by their tips nearly half into one of these holes, 
and on one occasion he has seen one wing of a fly drawn into the 
tip of one of these ovaries, whilst the other wing was drawn into 
the tip of an adjoining one with such force that the right wing had 
been torn from the body.
This might, however, have been 
accomplished by the swelling and consequent growing apart of the 
two ovaries rather than by suction.
With these facts before us we asked ourselves whether it 
could be that Arum was insectivorous, and, if not, on what 
other supposition could we account for the foregoing evidence ?
Being unable to answer these questions, we applied to Mr. A.
W. 
Bennett, who has taken a very kind interest in our observations.
His reply was as follows : — M I have examined under the micro- 
scope several of the specimens of Arum you have been kind 
enough to send me, but find no evidence of any absorption or 
digestion of insects.
The spot at the apex of the ovary is the 
stigmatic opening, there being no style; this opening is fringed 
with hairs, which are evidently the stigmatic hairs, and have for 
their function the excitement of the emission of the pollen tubes 
and the conduction of these to the ovules.
The interior of the 
266 Arum maculatum and its cross-fertilization.
ovary is also clothed with hairs.
The insect to which you called 
my attention had been caught and retained by these hairs ; but I 
cannot discover any evidence that the capture of insects is any 
function of these hairs, or that there are any absorptive or digestive 
glands in the substance of the ovule.
I have, however, preserved 
several specimens in alcohol for careful examination when I am 
rather more at leisure." Mr. Bennett has further been kind enough 
to send us an extract from the Italian Journal of Botany,* to the 
effect that G.
Arcangeli has observed the rise of temperature, &c, 
in several species of Aracece, but does not consider that there is 
sufficient evidence to warrant the assumption of carnivorous habits 
in these plants, there being a complete absence of any digestive 
fluid and of any special digestive glands in the spathe.
Under all 
the circumstances, it seems as if some other explanation than that 
of carnivorousness would have to be sought for.
After the escape of the flies the spathe very quickly begins to 
wither, and we believe that very few last more than twenty-four 
hours ; so that the plant spends many weeks in producing what, 
when mature, it only uses for.
a few hours, which may be cited as 
an example of the extreme care exercised by plants to ensure the 
production of offspring.
The ovaries rapidly swell and continue 
growing until, about the end of June, they reach the size of large 
peas, and burst the dry withered bulb of the spathe.
These ovaries 
contain either two or three seeds each, and they remain on the 
erect flower-stalk till the autumn, when they turn to a bright 
vermilion-colour and form the conspicuous objects which are so 
often seen in hedge -bottoms after the leaves have fallen.
At the 
beginning of winter the rotting of the base of the stalk causes it to 
fall to the ground, when the berries become detached.
We have 
never yet detected any bird eating these berries, but, judging from 
their attractive colour, it is probable that they are habitually eaten 
by some species.
The leaves last sufficiently long to enable the 
root to lay in a store of nutritious matter for use in the following 
spring, but before midsummer they have often so completely rotted 
away as to be scarcely discoverable in places where, a few months 
earlier, they were abundant.
In spite of all these precautions for ensuring the production of 
seed, it seems to us quite certain that the number of plants pro- 
ducing scarlet berries in the autumn bears but a small proportion 
to those which produce spathes in the spring, though we do not 
know what the cause of this may be.
At any rate it seems, from 
Mr. Christy's observation, that the plant is so strongly protero- 
gynous as to be quite incapable of self-fertilization.
He covered 
four spathes with a net before they opened on April 28th, 1882, 
and all died without setting seed; but, as others growing near 
them did the same, it may have been from some other cause than 
that of non-cross-fertilization.
In like manner two from which, 
before opening, he removed the spadices, both died; but two 
from which, before ripening, he removed the anthers, and one

from which, before opening, he removed the filaments, all set 
plenty of seed.
On the 26th of May, 1881, Mr. Christy found a most curious 
variety of the flower in Debden Park, Essex.
The external appear- 
ance was exactly as usual, as also was the spadix, which was of a 
deep red-purple.
On opening the spathe the floral organs were all 
found to be normal, except that no less than seven of the ovaries 
were themselves developing into small spadices of the same colour 
as the large one.
Five of them, of which the largest was about 
half an inch, were perfect, and had small filaments round their 
bases.
The other two were merely small coloured tubercles on the 
ends of two ovaries.
Altogether this spathe contained eight more 
or less perfect spadices.
Another monstrosity which we gathered 
on May 1st, 1882, had only two ovaries, one or two anthers, and a 
very short spadix.
With regard to the great heat given out by the spadix during 
the maturity of the stigmas, there can, we think, be no doubt that 
chemical action of some sort is at the root of the matter.
Our 
friend Mr. J.
E. Clark, of York, writes that it is most probably 
due to the slow process of oxidation which goes on day and night 
in the flowers of plants.
"It is," he says, "very natural that such 
heat should be further utilized in the production of a peculiar 
scent." Mr. Bennett has observed of the spadix that " its cells are 
full of starch, and each contains an evident nucleus." There can 
be no doubt that to sustain a heat and smell such as have been 
described must require some pretty powerful chemical action; 
hence doubtless the large amount of material to be found in the 
club at this period.
But when the heat is once over, the club is no 
longer required, and very quickly withers and dries up ; and as the 
ovaries are at this period growing at a great rate, it seems probable 
that they may draw their sustenance from the now useless spadix 
as from a reservoir.

Thanking M.
Barbusa Bodriguez for his courteous kindness in 
defending me in my suspected mistake, I must confess I did not 
want it.
What makes the note more surprising is, that M.
Barbusa Bodriguez immediately continues in stating that I have 
combined by mistake Oncidium flabelliferum Pinel and Gardnen 
Lindl.
He teaches us this is not right, and endeavours to give 
comparative marks of distinction.
Hence it results that the 
Professor makes one fine mixture of Oncidium pubes, Gardneri, and 
flabelliferum.
It is impossible to follow well the ideas of M.
Barbusa 
Bodriguez from his descriptions, yet he is quite right at all events 
in discerning his Oncidium Gardneri and flabelliferum.

to make the observation that, whatever his Oncidium " Gardneri" 
may be, it is decidedly not Lindley' s.
We must understand this 
from the remark, "mezochile long" [why not "mesockile long"?] .
The isthmus (called mezoehile by M.

A STUDY OF THE SUBVIVAL OF THE FITTEST.
By J.
G. Baker, F.B.S.
About three years ago a piece of ground at Kew was specially 
set apart to contain a collection of hardy herbaceous plants for the 
use of botanical teachers and their pupils.
It was a perfectly level 
square of ground in the immediate neighbourhood of the Herbarium, 
which for a long time had been covered with grass, amongst which 
a few trees were planted.
It was spaced out into beds with walks 
between them, and about 250 species were selected, and a good 
tuft of each was planted in the beds.
Each species had a distinct 
plot allotted to it, the soil being quite uniform, and the species 
arranged according to their systematic sequence.
I have now had 
the collection under constant inspection for three years, and have 
made a catalogue of the species, classifying them in three groups, 
272 A STUDY OF THE SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST.
according to their power of survival under the conditions as explained, 
viz., first, the species that show a decided tendency to spread 
themselves spontaneously over the walks and the plots of ground 
that properly belong to their neighbours ; secondly, those which 
grow so as to fill up their property plots fairly, but do not spread ; 
and, thirdly, those that, unless they were renewed, would soon die 
out and disappear.
The foreman, Mr. Dewar, who has had charge 
of the collection since it was started, has looked over my lists and 
suggested a few alterations.
I need not of course point out that 
the struggle for existence under the conditions as just explained is 
something quite different from, and very much less intense than, it 
would have been if the same species had been experimentised upon 
when grown mixed up together indiscriminately.
It is very likely 
that many of the species placed in the category of those that have 
held their ground have not been reproduced from seed at all, but 
have simply multiplied from the original stock by mere vegetable 
reproduction.
But of course to keep a record of a struggle for life 
in which a great many species were concerned, carried on under 
perfectly natural circumstances, would be a very difficult matter.

Species that have shewn a distinct tendency to spread over 
the walks and take possession of the plots of ground that belong to 
their neighbours.

A NEW PUCCINIA.
By W.
B. Gkove, B.A.
For several years I have been acquainted with (Ecidium 
depauperans, Vize, which has occurred near Birmingham, at Perry 
Barr, Moseley, and Sutton, on cultivated Violas ; but until this 
year I have not seen the (Ecidium followed by a Puccinia.
This 
has now appeared at Sutton, and, as it seems to differ somewhat 
from Puccinia violarum, I have named it P.
cegra.
A description is 
annexed.
Puccinia segra, n.
sp.
I. CEcidhim depanperans, Vize.
— Cups on all green parts of the 
plant, scattered, not collected on stvollen patches, roundish or 
elliptic, with a torn, white, sometimes recurved margin.
Spores 
roundish or oblong, angular, smooth, orange-yellow, 17-21 /x long, 
14-16 /x broad.
II.
Pustules numerous, amphigenous, on yellow spots, not 
small, scattered or collected in groups, roundish, flatly convex, 
covered with the silvery shining persistent epidermis.
Spores elliptic or 
obovate, delicately spiny, brown, about 28-30 p long.
III.
Pustules as in II.
Teleutospores elliptic, oblong or 
roundish, very irregular, rounded or tapering at base or apex, 
sometimes truncate, smooth, not constricted, dark brown, 22-30 p 
long, 18-24 fjL broad.
This fungus attacks cultivated Violas of all colours, white, 
yellow, blue, and purple.
The (Ecidium appears at the end of 
May, and continues till autumn.
The same plant which bears the 
Puccinia may still continue to produce the (Ecidium, and all three 
kinds of spores may be found even on the same leaf.
Its impoverishing 
effect is most marked; the stems affected by it become flaccid, 
lanky and yellow, with imperfectly developed leaves.
The uredo- 
pustules, which are confined to the leaves and stipules, render them 
very weak and yellow ; the epidermis remains for a long time as a 
dome-shaped covering, and at last splits irregularly or by a 
longitudinal fissure.
The teleutospores are more usually broadest 
at the septum : they appeared in August.

PoLYPODIUM DRYOPTERIS AND P.
EoBERTIANUM IN BUCKS.
Last 
June the Rev. A.
Robertson and Mr. Armstrong were botanising in 
South Oxfordshire, and in a small spinney on the borders of the 
county gathered some specimens of the oak fern.
As they were 
not certain as to the exact wood it was found in, being unprovided 
with an ordnance map, I went over to Princes Risborough and 
walked to Chinnor, and after some time found the fern in a small 
spinney, locally known as Bollard's Wood, which actually forms the 
border of the county, the wood being just in Buckinghamshire.
The 
fern is plentiful, but restricted to a small space, and is associated 
with L.
spinulosa and L.
dilatata.
It is apparently absent from the 
large neighbouring wood, Tunley Wood, Pijrola minor and Hordeum 
sylvaticum plentifully occurring.
P. Robertianum is given for Bucks 
in * Top. Bot.,' on the authority of a specimen seen by Mr. Britten ; 
but the above is the only record of Dryopteris for Central and 
Southern England, the nearest stations being West Gloucester and 
Staffordshire.
— G.
C. Druce.
As a pendant to Mr. Druce's note, it may be worth while to 
give details as to the single instance known of the occurrence of 
P. Robertianum in Buckinghamshire.
About 1863 Mr. H.
Ullyett 
(now of Folkestone) found two specimens in King's Wood, close to 
Hazlemere, a village near High Wycombe.
The most careful 
search on his part, and subsequently on mine, failed to discover 
another specimen ; nor have I heard of its having been found there 
280 
SHORT NOTES 
before or since.
In Oxfordshire, where it is recorded as having 
occurred at Wychwood Forest, I believe it has not been found 
for many years.
— James Britten.
Naturalised Plants.
— I remember that Prof.
Thiselton Dyer 
as far back as 1871 called attention in this Journal to the plants 
observed on the site of the Exhibition of 1862, amongst which he 
mentioned Epilobium august if olium.
Since then I have frequently 
noticed that this plant has a remarkable tendency to hold its 
ground wherever it once obtains a footing.
On the railway running 
from Whitchurch to Ellesmere, which crosses an extensive bog 
known as Whixall Moss, it lines both sides of the road, and when 
I passed there last week formed a very showy and conspicuous 
object.
I noticed the same plant on Shawbury Heath, forming an 
extensive bed.
When wandering up a retired valley of the Long- 
mynd recently, near Church Stretton, I was much surprised to find 
Mimulus moschatiis in vigorous growth by the side of a little 
mountain- stream.
Naturally curious to know how it came to be 
in such an out-of-the-way place, I followed the stream a short 
distance up, and found it passed a cottage whence no doubt 
it had escaped.
Many of the cottiers hereabout are fond of 
their gardens, and possibly at some future time other instances 
of naturalisation may be observed in out-of-the-way spots.

Phillips.
Myosurus minimus, Native or Colonist ?
— This plant, extinct 
in South Cambridgeshire, still grows abundantly about Chatteris 
on sandy and gravelly highland loams, rarely extending to the 
black soil of the fens.
It is usually found only in wheat-fields, as 
it is an early plant, and consequently destroyed by the spring 
tillage necessary for other crops.
Thus it has the appearance of a 
colonist, but perhaps only because the natural conditions of its 
growth have been destroyed by cultivation.
A more natural 
habitat is under trees growing on old highland pastures at Woods 
End, near Chatteris, where the soil is bared by the stamping of 
cattle which congregate for shade and to resist the attacks of flies.
In such situations it successfully disputes the bared ground with 
Poa annua, and even extends for some little distance amongst the 
permanent herbage of the field.
Our turbaries give evidence of the 
abundance of wild cattle in pre-historic times, so that we may fairly 
assume that Myosurus did not then lack the "cultivation" which 
seems necessary for its growth, and it may therefore be truly 
native.
Has anyone seen it growing in "waste places"?

— While botani- 
zing in Deeping Fen, South Lincolnshire, at the end of July last, 
I observed the above plant in two places.
It was rather frequent 
in one drain in the Fen, and I found a single specimen in another 
drain about four miles distant.
Its occurrence in the various 
drains probably depends chiefly on the time of year at which they 
have been cleared of weeds.
Rare even as a European plant, it is 
not known to have been gathered in England since the time of the

OFFICIAL REPORT FOR 1882 OF THE DEPARTMENT OF BOTANY 
IN THE BRITISH MUSEUM.
By W.
Carruthers, F.R.S.
The preparation of the cases in the public Gallery has occupied 
much of the time of the officers of the Department during the year.
Specimens fitted to exhibit the characters of the various Natural 
Orders of Flowering Plants have been selected, mounted, and 
arranged in the cases.
There have been incorporated with the great Herbarium series 
of plants belonging chiefly to the following Natural Orders : 
Capparidece, Cruciferce, Caryophyllea, Turneracea, Onagracea, 
Lythracea, Cucurbitacete, Compositm, Acanthacea, Campanulacea, 
Orchidacea, Liliacea, Amaryllidacece, Juncacea, Eriocaulonea , 
Cyperacea, Filices, and Fungi.
A portion of the extensive herbarium of Mosses recently pur- 
chased from the representatives of Dr. Hampe has been mounted 
and arranged for consultation.
The collection of plants in spirits has been classified and 
arranged in the new cabinets prepared for its reception.
Large additions have been made to the British Herbarium.
The principal additions to the collections during the year have 
consisted in a continuation of the valuable Herbarium of Indian 
Plants presented by Charles Baron Clarke, Esq., F.R.S.
, amounting 
to 2335 species ; of 187 species of Himalayan Plants collected and 
presented by J.
P. Duthie, Esq., of Saharunpore ; a small collection 
of Australian plants, presented by J.
C. Melvill, Esq.
; and an 
extensive collection of plants from Japan, from the Herbarium of 
J. Bissett, Esq. By purchase the following collections have been 
acquired: — 201 plants from Central Victoria, Australia; 1962 
plants from Mexico, collected by Parry and Vasey; 320 plants 
from the southern United States, collected by A.
H. Curtis ; 300 
plants from Washington Territory, collected by Suksdorf; 475 
from Arizona, collected by Lemmon ; 100 plants from Sicily ; 100 
plants from Lapland ; 340 species of German Fungi from Thuemen ; 
282 NOTICES OF BOOKS* 
200 species of Fungi from Italy, collected by Saccardo ; 50 species 
of Fungi from Austria, collected by Rehm ; and 400 species of 
American Fungi from Ravenal ; 200 species of Lichens from Fin- 
land, collected by Norrlin ; and 135 species of Lichens from 
Burmah, collected by the late Dr. Maingay ; 200 Algas from 
Mauritius, collected by Robillard; the collection of Diatomaceae 
formed by the late Rev. E.
O'Meara, containing 1155 specimens ; 
and 500 European Cryptogamia, collected by Sintenis.
A series of fruits, and of complete plants of Myrmecodia from 
Java, collected by H.
O. Forbes, have been added to the collections 
of fruits and woods.
To the British Herbarium there have been added 461 species 
from the Rev. W.
H. Painter; 392 species from C.
Bailey, Esq.
; 
80 species of Sussex plants from F.
0. S.

Valuable additions have been made to the collection of prints 
and drawings of plants by the presentation by the Misses Maund 
of the original water-colour drawings of the plates in Maund's 
4 Botanic Garden,' representing 1248 plants, and by the purchase 
of an extensive series of original drawings of Indian Plants con- 
tained in 13 folio volumes, formerly the property of Dr. Fleming.

It would be difficult to find a work which has been looked 
forward to with more anxiety than this new edition of   Topogra- 
phical Botany ' ; difficult, too, to find a book which more thoroughly 
fulfils the anticipations formed of it.
That these anticipations were 
high it is unnecessary to assert.
In the whole range of British 
NOTICES OF BOOKS.
283 
botanists it would have been impossible to find two so well fitted 
for the task of editing the work as those whose names are attached 
to the short preface with which it opens.
United to Mr. Watson 
by strong ties of personal friendship, Mr. Baker and the Rev. W.
W. Newbould are otherwise singularly well adapted to carry on his 
work, possessing, as they do respectively, the faculty of generalisa- 
tion and the critical mind which were combined in Mr. Watson with 
such happy results.
i 
Only a hundred copies of the original edition of ' Topographical 
Botany' were printed, and those were privately distributed, so that 
to very many the present will be a new book.
To the possessors of 
the first edition the present one will also be indispensable, the 
additions, made for the most part by Mr. Watson himself in an 
interleaved copy, being very considerable: — "The few additions 
which we have made on our own authority," say the editors, " may 
be distinguished by having the name of the personal authority 
placed in parentheses.' 1 It seems to be implied, therefore, that 
every other addition and' alteration is Mr. Watson's own.
Some of 
these alterations are a little puzzling.
For example, in ed.
1, 
Ado?iis autumnalis is recorded as "non-indigenous"— that being the 
meaning attached by Mr. Watson to curved brackets — from 
counties "5 6 7 13 14 17 18 19 21 to 29 33 34 40 55 57 58 59 62 
64 66 68 75 77 83 " : in the new edition it is recorded as a 
" supposed error " — for this is the signification of the square 
brackets— from " 25 26 27 28 29 33 34 40 55 57 58 59 62 63 66 68 
75 77 80 83." Apart from the alteration in the estimate of the 
position of the species, we cannot help wondering what has become 
of the previously-given records for the counties between 5 and 24.
Have they slipped out unnoticed ?
* 
But puzzles of this kind are scarce ; not so the evidences of 
care and steady work, which may be traced on every page.
The 
segregates have received much attention, — Ranimcultis aquatilis, 
for instance, represented by only 3 in the 1st edition, has here 
10 placed under it.
We are surprised, by the way, to find 
R. penicillatus (pseudofiuitans) credited to only 6 counties, and 
suspect that some of those placed under fliritans should be trans- 
ferred here.
Prof.
Babington contributes the distribution of the 
fruticose Rubi ; the Boses remain much as before.
Detailed distri- 
bution of the Callitriches is given, 6 species being enumerated.
The Hleracia have received much attention, no fewer than 20 
segregates being added.
Galinsoga jmrviflora is inserted as 
naturalised in Surrey and Middlesex.
A comparison between the two editions is full of interest, and 
suggests many points for enquiry, the reasons for certain changes 
not being always apparent on the surface.
But space will not 
permit us to enter at further length upon the investigation of the 
work; nor indeed is it necessary to do so.
To all who are 
interested in County Floras, or in the general subject of plant 
distribution in Britain, ' Topographical Botany' is indispensable.
* We have dince learned from Mr. Baker that this is the ease.

A sumptuous book, in tbe best style of topography and chromo- 
lithography, containing an enumeration of the Monocotyledones 
and Dicotyledones collected on two voyages of the Princes of Saxe- 
Coburg Gotha, — one round the world, and the second to Brazil 
only, — together with descriptions and coloured figures of a number 
of new species.
The value of this book lies in the admirable 
illustrations.
Anyone familiar with the " Aroidea Maximiliance M 
can form an idea of their quality, as the drawings are by the same 
artist, — Leipoldt, — and the chromo -lithography by the same 
printer.
The voyage around the world was accomplished by various 
modes of travelling, and the stoppages were mostly of short 
duration.
Liverpool was the point of embarkation, and New York 
their destination, where they arrived August 10th, 1872.
A few 
days were spent in making excursions from the latter city, and 
then the party proceeded by Pacific Kailway to California, visiting 
Salt Lake City on their way, where the first collecting was done.
On September 27th they left San Francisco for the Sandwich 
Islands, or, as we ought to say now, Hawaia.
Here an accident 
prevented Dr. Wawra from collecting, but their stay was only of a 
week's duration ; and their next landing place, except for a few 
minutes in the Samoa Islands, was Auckland, in New Zealand, 
arriving there in the middle of October.
Sydney was reached by 
the 24th of the same month, and left again on the 26th.
A little 
more than a week was spent in Victoria, and a few hours in the 
neighbourhood of Albany, W.
Australia ; and by the end of 
November the travellers were in Ceylon.
Then followed a flying 
visit to Japan, touching at Singapore, Saigon, Hong-Kong, and 
Shanghai ; and calling at Batavia on the return voyage.
Ten days 
were spent in Java ; and the next place visited was Pulo Penang, 
where, however, the stay was of the briefest, as they embarked for 
Bombay the same evening, and arrived there on March 12th.
Thence a tiger-hunting and sight-seeing tour was made through 
India.
This lasted about three weeks, and the greater part of the 
time was spent in rapidly travelling from place to place.
The 
homeward voyage was by way of the Suez Canal ; and the party 
arrived in Vienna on April 20th, 1873.
From the foregoing brief sketch of the route, it will be evident 
that the botanical collections could not be very extensive ; yet we 
find new species described from Australia, Java, and India.
But 
the greater part of the botanical collections was made during 
NOTICES OF BOOKS.
285 
a month's stay in Brazil, in 1879, special attention having 
apparently been paid to the JJromeliacea, more than half of 
the plates being devoted to that natural order.
The greater part of the novelties discovered, and here figured 
for the first time, have been already published by Dr. Wawra in the 
1 CEsterr.
Botanische Zeitschrift' ; so that we have in the pre- 
sent volume only seven species hitherto undescribed : — Psidzum 
ItatiaitB, P.
paraibicum, Oxymeris Itatiam, Symplocos Itatiaia, 
Kbermaiera gracilis, E, Itatiaia, Argostemma javanicum, — all, save 
the last, being from Brazil.
"We are glad to welcome the first number of vol.
xii.
of the 
3rd edition of • English Botany' (Bell & Sons, York St., W.C.), 
in which the Vascular Cryptogams are begun.
It contains twenty 
plates, three of which 
Hy.
I. echinospora — are entirely new : it is, we think, to be regretted 
that some of the old plates — notably the very inadequate one of 
Osmunda regalis — should not also have been superseded.
The 
descriptions of the species are well up to the standard of the 
former volumes.
Lycopodium complanatum, somewhat to our sur- 
prise, is only given as an excluded species, and, what is still more 
remarkable, no allusion whatever is made to the Gloucestershire 
plant which Prof.
Babington and Mr. Carruthers agree in referring 
to that species.* It is scarcely correct to say that Dr. D.
Moore 
described his Isoetes Morei as " a distinct swi-species" : he called it 
a new species oi Isoetes." We are glad to note the absence of the 
so-called " popular portion" of former volumes.
It is to be hoped 
that the work will quickly proceed to completion.
In the 10th part of the ' Flora of British India,' Sir J.
D. Hooker 
describes the Asclepiadece and Scrophidarinea, the remaining orders 
Loganiacece, Gentianacea, Polemoniacece, Hydrophyllacece, Borra- 
ginem, Convolvulacea, Solanacea — being the work of Mr. C.
B. Clarke.
In the first-named, several new genera are established — Athero- 
lepis, Genianthus, Pmtabothra, Adelostonma, Lygisma, Treutlera, and 
Dittoceras.
The inaccurate method of citation which has charac- 
terised the work almost throughout still continues ; thus, the five 
species of Trigonitis are ascribed to " Benth.
in Gen. PL ii.
558," 
but not one of them is there specifically named.
We regret to see that Messrs.
George Bell & Sons have printed 
the misleading words " eighth edition " and the date 1883 on the 
cover of a recent issue of the 'London Catalogue.' It is merely 
the seventh edition in a new wrapper, not the smallest alteration 
being made in the text : this is obvious from the reference, at p.
81, 
to " this seventh edition," while the work ends with the announce- 
ment that " inquiries may be addressed to the compiler, Hewett C.
Watson"!
The mistake has since, we understand, been rectified 
as far as possible, but copies are in circulation lettered "eighth 
edition."

We ought ere this to have noticed Mr, W.
Jolly's * Life of John 
Duncan, Scotch Weaver and Botanist' (1794-1881), (Kegan Paul & 
Co.).
It is a biography of the style with which Mr. Smiles has 
made us familiar, and of a man of the type of Eobert Dick and 
Thomas Edward; and we do not intend to disparage its merit 
when we say that both in subject and treatment it seems to us to 
fall short of the two lives just named.
But Mr. Jolly has made too 
big a book out of the materials at his disposal ; and his merits as a 
biographer fall short of those of Mr. Smiles.
It is somewhat a 
matter of wonder to us that no work in similar style has been 
undertaken for any of our English working-men naturalists : there 
have been men in Lancashire who have quite as much claim on 
public notice as either John Duncan or Mr. Smiles's Scotch 
proteges.
In the Appendix is given a " List of Plants found in the 
Vale of Alford and the surrounding districts of Aberdeenshire," and 
some notes on other plants found in Duncan's herbarium.
A 
capital etched portrait of Duncan in his seventy-second year serves 
as frontispiece to the volume.
Dr. Masters has contributed a handy little volume on ' Plant 
Life ' to the series of the Handbooks of the Farm now being issued 
by Messrs.
Bradbury, Agnew & Co. His aim is "to supply a sketch 
of the physiology or life-history of plants; of the way in which 
they are affected by the circumstances under which they exist, and 
of the manner in which they in their turn react upon other living 
beings and upon natural forces"; and in this he seems to have 
succeeded.
We regret that the pressure on our space prevents our 
giving a more detailed notice.
Messrs.
W. Swan Sonnenschein & Co. have just added to their 
marvellously cheap series of i Young Collectors' Handbooks ' one on 
1 Flowering Plants ' by Mr. Britten.
It would obviously be unfitting 
to say more in this Journal ; but the fact that a handbook devoted 
to the collection and preservation of plants, consisting of thirty -two 
well-printed pages, fully illustrated, can be obtained for the sum of 
one penny is sufficiently remarkable to claim this word of notice.
The same publishers send us ' A Season among the Wild Flowers,' 
by the Rev. H.
Wood — one of those popular introductions to a 
knowledge of British plants of which the number seems almost 
unlimited.

"The delicate tints and feathery fronds of Ferns are 
so inseparably associated with recollections of delightful 
summer rambles that a glance at the fern-case will lift 
the spirits over the depressing influence of the darkest day 
of midwinter.
But it is hopeless to attempt the culture 
of ferns without some adequate knowledge of their nature 
and habits, and a desire for information on th« subject is 
admirably met in the handsome work issued by Messrs.
Cassell & Co., under the title of ' European Ferns.

author describes minutely every variety of fern found in 
Europe, their scientific order, their habits, places where 
found, and the best methods of propagating them when 
they are transferred to the rockery or fern-case.

RHODYMENIA PALM ETTA, Var. XW&ENSIS.
By E.
M. Holmes, F.L.S.
(Plate 240.) 
The seaweed which bears this name in Harvey's ' Phycologia 
Britannica' has hitherto been considered of somewhat uncertain 
affinity, owing to the fructification being imperfectly known and to 
the absence of any striking characteristic in the cellular structure 
of the frond.
Duby, who first described it in the * Botanicon Gallicum ' 
(ii., p.
942), named it Halymenia Nicaensis.
Agardh, in ' Alg. Mar.
Medit.
et Adriat.' p.
153, 1842, referred it to Rhodymema Palmetta 
J. Ag., as var.
£. Nicamsis, distinguished from the type chiefly by 
the terete dichotomous threads, in which the apex of the frond 
frequently terminates, and which either dilate into new leaves or 
bear prolifications.
This arrangement was followed by Harvey in the   Phycologia 
Britannica.' In that classical work he points out, however, that 
the plant bears a close resemblance to the var.
/3.
of Phyllophora 
Brodicei J.
Ag.
(Phyllophora pahnettoides J.
Ag,), but that it always 
springs from decumbent fibres.
He adds that, while Mediterranean 
specimens have usually a quite simple frond prolonged at the apex 
into a cirrhous appendage, British specimens are more commonly 
forked, and their apices, though attenuated, are seldom produced 
into the characteristic appendages.
Kiitzing figures it in his * Tab. Phyc/ xviii.
t. 96, as Sphcero- 
coccus Nicaensis, and his illustration shows cystocarpic fruit near 
the base of the frond.
The tetrasporic fruit has not, however, so 
far as I am aware, ever been described or figured; and on the 
characters afforded by this mode of reproduction must depend in 
some measure the position rightly assigned to the plant, since if 
the tetraspores were arranged in nemathecia it would apparently 
belong to the genus Phyllophora.
Owing to the great similarity in 
the shape and structure of the frond to that of Phyllophora palmet- 
toides, the two plants probably often pass the one for the other when 
the terminal cirrhi are absent and the fronds are collected without 
the root, which in the latter is a spreading disc and in the former 
a creeping stoloniferous prostrate stem.
In some specimens collected by Mr. E.
Batters in company with 
myself at Hastings, in April last, I was so fortunate as to find 
tetraspores in the terminal filiform appendages.
These were 
cruciate and scattered without order, and did not form a distinct 
sorus, as in P.
palmetto ides.
The cystocarps were unfortunately so 
pressed in drying that their contents were lost, but, being situated 
near the base of the frond instead of towards the apex, as in R.
Palmetto., the plant under consideration may, I think, be fairly 
separated, and provisionally retained as a distinct species under 
the name of Rhodymenia Nicceensis, until the structure of the 
Journal of Botany.
— Vol. 21.
[October, 1883.] u 
290 NOTES ON BKITISH DESMIDIE-E.
cystocarp can be ascertained.
It may be here observed that, 
when the frond of Phyllophora pahnettoides is examined under a 
low power (} inch), it appears to be mottled with pale rounded 
spots.
These are seen by careful focussing with a higher power 
(l-4th or l-5th inch objective) to be caused by the shape of 
the large internal cells of the frond, which in this plant are 
rotundate -hexagonal, whereas in R.
Nicceensis they are oblong- 
hexagonal.
This difference in the shape of the internal cells is 
noticed by Prof.
Agardh in the   Epicrisis Floridearum,' p.
330, 
and this seems to me to indicate that the specimen of Haly- 
menia Nicceensis with cystocarps, examined by him, may have 
been a specimen of P.
pahnettoides, since he states that the cystocarps 
have the structure of Phyllophora, and that the internal cells are 
shorter than those of R.
Palmetta.
Indeed, a sample I have 
received labelled Halymenia Nicceensis Duby, from Marseilles, which 
had cystocarps, proved to have the short or rounded hexagonal 
cells and mottled appearance, under the microscope, of P.
pahnet- 
toides, and presented when moistened the incurved margins of the 
frond characteristic of that plant when growing, but which I have 
never observed in R.
Nicceensis.
Another specimen without fruit 
from the same locality presented branching lateral root-like fibres, 
different in character from the stolons of R.
Nicceensis.
Kiitzing's figure of Sphcerococcus Nicceensis represents the cysto- 
carp as immersed in the frond, and not attached by a short pedicel 
as Agardh describes it.
Kiitzing's figure exhibits also the charac- 
teristic creeping stem of R.
Nicceensis.
Dr. Hauck, however, is of 
opinion that there is in the Mediterranean a Phyllophora with 
creeping stem, which otherwise resembles P.
pahnettoides, and of 
this plant he has seen cystocarps, nemathecia, and antheridia.
He has also met with a form of R.
Palmetta with creeping stems in 
the Mediterranean, but with cystocarps evidently those of a 
Rhodyme?iia.
These I have not seen.
It is obvious, however, 
that the position of the tetraspores and cystocarps, and the creeping 
stem of Harvey's plant well distinguish it from R.
Palmetta.

The zygospore in this species is very remarkable, as the 
members of this genus whose zygospores are known have these 
bodies smooth ; this seeming abnormality, however, simply shows 
the close affinity between this genus and Cosmarium, the latter 
having sometimes smooth zygospores, sometimes spinous, and 
sometimes intermediate, as in margaritiferwm, which has a series

CINCHONA LEDGERIANA, 
By Dr. Otto Ktjntze.
^ To maintain the supposed species ft Ledgeriana Moens, Dr.
Trimen attempts (p.
131) to controvert two of my statements, upon 
which my hybridity theory of that plant is based ; but he (1) seems 
to me to contradict his own former statements, and (2) draws an 
erroneous conclusion from the opinion of one of his correspondents.
(1.) Dr. Trimen wrote in this Journal for 1881 (p.
321): — 
(a.) " In our own plantations in Sikkim, after years of neglect 
as one of the troublesome and hopelessly variable forms of ft 
Calisaya, the plant [ft Ledgeriand] is now the object of careful 
cultivation.
" And (p.
322), " In India it was not distinguished 
from other yellow bark trees [= 0.
Calisaya and descendants] , 
and it is only in the last few years that the trees have been picked 
out and identified by their botanical characteristics." 
(b.) " In Java, too, it was soon observed that though showing 
a good deal of variation." " Seed from the latter [C.
Ledgeriana] 
has [not hitherto been found to come very true." (Journ.
Bot.
1881, p.
322).
Dr. Trimen now writes (p.
132) : 
" There are no C.
Ledgeriana trees in the East that have 
been descended from Mr. Ledger's seed from the Eio Mamore." 
" Its great variability exists only in Dr. Kuntze's imagination." 
As the communications of the planters and intendants, who 
are often no botanists (as, for instance, Mr. Gammie and Mr.
Moens), are not seldom contradictory, of which Mr. Gammie gives 
me a new proof, an exact botanist must judge chiefly from bota- 
nical researches ; and I have proved that the C.
Ledgeriana of 
Mungpo differs from the Bolivian descendants by shrubby habit 
and divaricate panicles with slender ramification, — two charac- 
teristics that can only originate from Mungpo specimens of the 
parents: — C.
WeddeUiana {Calisaya) with shrubby habit, and C.
Pavoniana (micrantha) with slender panicles, which species grow in 
no other wise in Mungpo.
Besides, Messrs.
Gammie and Bier- 
mann had shown me, as the only ft Ledgeriana existing there, 
those shrubby or artificially tree-like ft Ledgeriana with slender 
panicles, and therefore Mr. Gammie gave me different information 
from Dr. Trimen ; but the former information of Mr. Gammie, and 
that of the late chief gardener in the Mungpo plantations, Mr.
Biermann, accords strictly with the above (1 a) given citations of 
Dr. Trimen, who may have got them from the Reports of the 
botanical superintendant of the Sikkim Cinchona plantations, Dr.
King.
The best proof of the hybridity of the Mungpo 0.
Ledgeriana 
lies in its botanical marks, as I have shown here, and more exten- 
sively in my monograph of Cinchona.
(2).
If Mr. Christie, a planter, whose letter is partly cited by 
Dr. Trimen, had said that isolated trees of ft Ledgeriana were fertile 
294 CAMPYLOPUS BREVIFOLIUS SCHPR.
in the manner of other Cinchonas, there would be a contradiction 
to my statement in this Journal (p.
7), " C.
Ledgeriana is the 
only Cinchona that suffers from sterility, and only ripens more 
fruits, if it gets fertilized and hybridized by other Cinchonas ; that 
happens often .
. .
;" for it is well known that G.
Ledgeriana, if 
not isolated from other Cinchonas, ripens many, but degenerated, 
seeds.
If Mr. Christie generally writes, C.
Ledgeriana comes per- 
fectly true from seed, I find it contrary to my own numerous 
observations, to the testimonies of nearly all other planters, some 
of which I cited in this Journal (p.
7), and also to the former com- 
munications of Dr. Trimen, who wrote the above cited (1 b), and 
(Journ.
Bot. 1881, p.
323), " The seedlings [from C.
Ledgeriana], 
since Mr. Gammie uprooted nearly all the neighbouring trees, 
now come remarkably true, whereas before that was done the 
sporting was so great that Dr. King would not propagate by seed 
at all." This " remarkably true" is not perfectly true, which would 
be necessary for a species.
I never asserted that C.
Ledgeriana was absolutely sterile ; and 
if it gets few seeds by self- fertilisation, some of them may give 
true descendants.
But the fertility, even if existing, cannot be an 
argument for a species in the genus Cinchona, because all artificial 
and all other spontaneous hybrids of Cinchona are extremely 
fertile.
In regard to the fertility of C.
Ledgeriana, Dr. Trimen 
confounds the facts of rich cross -fertilisation and poor self- 
fertilisation ; his own plate of C.
Ledgeriana shows partly abortive 
fruits, and confirms my observations and communications on the 
sterility of that plant.
CAMPYLOPUS BREVIFOLIUS Schpr.
By H.
Boswell.
At the latter end of July I paid a visit to Breconshire, in 
company with the Kev. Augustin Ley, hoping that we might haply 
find further traces of the Bryum gemmiparum of which mention was 
lately made in the Journal, and possibly come upon it in some 
other stream.
This hope was disappointed, though we wandered 
in various directions and examined a great deal of ground, and all 
we saw of the Bryum was in the neighbourhood of the place where 
Mr. Ley first found it in May.
Nor can it be said that on the whole the region surrounding the 
Brecon Beacons is a very muscose one : many species that might 
be expected are conspicuous by their absence, especially Orthotrirha 
and Ulotm, whilst on the moors scarcely a trace of Sphagnum was 
seen in many miles.
The only thing of much interest, after the Bryum, was found on 
the last day of the ramble, on the bank of the Wye ; this was a 
Campylopu* which at first sight rather reminded me of C.
fragiltSj 
but with a different aspect from any form of that rather variable 
SPICILEGIA FLOR^ SINENSIS.
295 
species that I had seen.
Arrived at home I soon found by the aid 
of the microscope that it was C.
brevifoliics Schpr.
(Bryol.
Eur.
SuppL), which appears to be the same thing as C.
subulatus.
Both 
names are appropriate enough : Dr. Braithwaite adopts the latter 
in his British Moss-Flora, now issuing.
But C.
brsvifolius is 
described and figured as a very dwarfish species, and the specimens 
I possess from Forfarshire and the Continent were dwarfish 
enough, with a starved aspect quite agreeing with the description ; 
while the Wye plants are about two inches high, freely grown, and 
forming large bold patches.
The leaves, however, present no 
difference, but the habit and aspect are so different that it may be 
well to take notice of it as a rather remarkable variety, charac- 
terised thus : 
Campylopus bkevifolius Schpr.
= C.
subulatus ejusd.
Var. ELONGATUS.
Tufts broad, extended, compact and solid ; stems slender, 
filiform, elongate, copiously radiculose below, repeatedly inno- 
vating with fastigiate branches above ; branches without radicles.
Leaves as in minor forms.
In sandy mud by the Wye, near Builth, growing in company 
with Tortula cylindrical Trichostomum topkaceum, Hyjma, &c.
; 28th 
July, 1883.
In all its forms C subulatus (or brevifoliics) is readily known 
from C.
fragilis by the shorter subula and narrower cells ; from 
C. Schimperi, which it more resembles, by the absence of the 
diaphanous vesicular cells near the base.
C. Schwarzii is more 
robust, and has large well-pronounced auricles.

comparison with Mr. Hancock's Ning-po specimen, identified by

S. Bulloc/xii, described in the first fasciculus of these * Spicilegia,'

As, like some species of Smilax, the

I refer 
the specimen with some little hesitation to this species, very briefly 
characterised by DeCandolle (Prodrom.

veg.
ii.
248), and which was totally unknown to Ledebour (Fl. ross.
i. 566).
It has been found recently in the Tien-shan moun tarns (Osten- 
Sacken & Euprecht, Sertum Tianschanic.
42).
As stated by the 
late Dr. Euprecht, the legume is not moniliform ; though turgid 
over the seeds, and compressed between, there is no constriction, 
the two margins being quite even, and when soaked in boiling 
water, the legume is anfractuose, as he describes it, or inclined to 
twist from right to left.
It is downy, and besides clothed with 
short fungiform glands, and the stem is not unarmed, but furnished 
with short asperities.
If Mr. Mesny's plant is not referable to 
Fischer's species, it must be new.

I record this locality for the purpose of 
noting that every specimen gathered had cordate-ovate undivided 
leaves.
In the Hongkong plant the leaves are usually divided to 
about one-third of their length, but I have specimens in which 
some few of them are either simply emarginate or even quite entire.
I had always hitherto supposed, and indeed observed, that the 
amount of leaf-division was an exceedingly stable character in this 
genus, and Mr. Baker has (Fl. Brit.
Ind. ii.
278) adopted it for the 
divisions of the section Phanera.
In the present case f at any rate, 
it is not of specific value even.

recognizing the genus Docynia, established by my lamented friend 
the late Prof.
Decaisne : indeed I feel no little hesitation in 
admitting it even as a section apart from Mains.
The present 
species is referred to Cydonia by both Spach and Eoemer (Fain,

examined in a fresh state, is a true apple in every respect.
It is 
made into a preserve by the natives.
In his remarkable dissertation 
on Spiraea (Act. hort.

Maximowicz 
appears to me to have most happily solved the difficult question of

Nor, though I

to me that there is any solid ground for objection to the genera he 
has separated from Spiraa.
All M.

I have been much surprised to find this eminently

but there is no doubt of the correctness of my determination, both 
from Lehmann's figure (Monogr.

Potent, t.

comparison with the specimens gathered at the River Kolyma by 
Augustinowicz.
The plant is not glabrous, but slightly downy 
(Cfr. Trautvetter, Act. hort.

The Chi-fu flora is 
well worthy of extended study, and I hope my valued friend F.

thoroughly.

ON THE FALL OF BEANCHLETS IN THE ASPEN 
(POPULUS TREMULA).
By Samuel G.
Shattock, F.K.C.S.* 
The ready fall of the branclilets in the Aspen (Popuhis tremula) 
is a sufficiently remarkable occurrence among the larger exogenous 
trees to merit a close investigation, and with this object the fol- 
lowing account may not be wholly without interest.
In the exogenous trees, with scarcely any exceptions beyond 
those to be noticed, and of which the Aspen is the most remarkable, 
the death of a branchlet is followed, indeed, by its ultimate 
detachment, but only after the lapse of a long period, during which 
the wood of the dead part undergoes changes which render it so 
friable or brittle that it is readily snapped across by the first 
violence that befals it ; if of considerable size, perhaps, by its 
sheer weight.
It may be sufficient to say, for the present purpose, 
that in this process of usual detachment the living parenchyma of 
the bark, the cork alone excepted, furnishes by transverse par- 
titioning a line of cork and underlying phellogen, by which the 
living part is abruptly demarcated off from the dead ; in some 
circumstances a similar demarcation ensues in the pith and 
medullary rays, the woody prosenchyma and bast-fibres alone 
remaining continuous, the dead with the living.
The parenchyma 
of the dead part shrinks ; the cork is in consequence circularly 
fissured, and the dead parenchyma subsequently softens and is 
washed away under the influence of rain and wind, leaving the 
stump of denuded wood still attached to the living branch ; the 
dead wood at the same time becomes so brittle as to fracture on 
the first violence and complete the separation of the dead parts.
The immediate cause of this brittleness of the dead wood the 
microscope shows to be an extreme thinning and confluence of the 
woody cells and vessels.
After the separation of the dead woody 
stump, the fractured surface is covered by an overgrowth of new 
tissue produced from the cambium, the new tissue undergoing 
transformation into wood, at first of a modified kind, and a proper 
cortical system.
By the progressive advance of this tissue the 
broken surface, though never healed, is covered in.
In this process 
no vital changes are set up by which the dead wood of the dead 
part is cast off from the living, and the actual surface of the 
fractured wood remains unhealed.
The other process of fall has been named by Berkeley!
" Cla- 
doptosis." In a short communication, one of a valuable series, 
Berkeley notices this fall as occurring in the white willow and oak.
I have observed the same in both trees ; but he does not mention 
the Aspen, in which the process is most marked, and the details of 
the process, with which the present communication is concerned, 
he did not investigate.
In the following account I will limit 
* Read before the Linnean Society, Jan. 18th, 1883.
t ' Gardeners' Chronicle, 7 Sept.
8th, 1855.
THE 
myself to the Aspen, but in the oak and willow the changes are of 
a similar kind.
In the larger branches of the Aspen the process 
does not occur, but branchlets half an inch in diameter and below 
this readily allow of this peculiar separation from their parent 
branch.
Externally, the union of the branchlet with the branch 
offers to view a marked enlargement, comparable with that which 
is seen at the base of the petioles in exogenous trees or at the 
bases of other deciduous stalks.
The swelling or enlargement is 
concentric with the branchlet ; and it is through the middle of this 
that the disarticulation takes place, and where the secret of the 
process lies.
A longitudinal section of the enlargement shows a 
general increase in the sectional area of the medulla, the wood, and 
cortical system; though indistinct, there is nevertheless a some- 
thing in the wood across the middle of the enlargement which 
engages the eye; the wood is less white, and on probing with a 
needle an area is detectable which is markedly softer than the 
wood on either side ; this area is from about l-12th to l-8th of an 
inch in breadth ; it crosses the bark at right angles to the surface 
of the enlargement, but the wood with slight obliquity towards the 
parental branch, the zone being as a whole concave outwardly, or 
forming a very obtuse outward angle.
If the bark be stripped off, 
the surface of the enlargement will be seen to present a series of 
longitudinal clefts, the woody elements being disparted by an 
intrusion of parenchyma.
It is not that the woody tissue of the 
tree is peculiar, from any great natural and general shortness of 
the woody cells, or otherwise.
Nor is it, again, that the death of 
the wood is itself the source of the separation.
For if it be the 
terminal portion of a branchlet which dies, it remains without 
showing any tendency to this disarticulation, and its subsequent 
history is the same as that of the dead parts of other trees.
On the contrary, if a branchlet be removed so as to leave, 
however, a stump devoid of buds, the part dies, and is cleanly 
separated across its base, in the same way as the petiole of a 
deciduous leaf is cast off if the lamina be artificially removed.
In the process of separation the branchlet is detached long before 
it presents the later signs of death ; indeed it is difficult to believe 
sometimes that the fallen part has entered upon a total death ; its 
leaves and buds may be still fresh upon it, and its bark not dis- 
tinguishable by the eye from what is unequivocally alive.
The 
enlarged base of such a recently fallen branchlet displays a soft 
pale yellow minutely granular surface, moist, and uniformly convex, 
except at the margin, which, with the fissured edge of the cork, is 
slightly raised.
After the detached parts have become dry, the 
wood presents, instead of a continuous surface, a series of deep 
radiating clefts, the surface of the dried medulla is depressed, the 
wood convex, the bark concave, these changes being severally 
resulted from the drying and disappearance of the parenchyma 
which covers and interdigitates with the woody lamellee.
On the 
parent branch the corresponding surface acquires characters of a 
more permanent kind, and the resulting cicatrix is cupped, radially 
ridged in the situation of the wood and in a finer manner beyond, 
308 ON THE FALL OF BRANCHLETS IN THE ASPEN (POPULUS TREMULA).
and uniformly brown from changes in the cork which covers it.
The cicatrizing process is peculiar, inasmuch as it occurs simul- 
taneously in the whole of the surface ; but I will refer to this again.
Now what does the microscope show regarding the structure of 
the articular enlargement ?
How does the area through which the 
disarticulation occurs differ from the rest of the branchlet ?
Two 
transverse sections prepared from wood hardened in alcohol, 
stained with magenta and glycerine, washed, and mounted in 
pure glycerine, show the following differences.
The section of the 
branchlet displays a uniformly and deeply-stained wood, traversed 
by medullary rays (of cells in single rows), and perforated with 
vessels arranged with uniform irregularity, though slightly larger 
and in excess in the limits of the annual rings.
The wood is suc- 
ceeded by a lightly- stained cambium, then by an abundance of soft 
bast, in which lie groups of bast-fibres ; through both of these the 
transversely elongated cells of the medullary rays are extended, 
and it is to the presence of these that the fine radial markings 
referred to in the cortex of the scar and separated branchlet 
are due ; more outwardly is a larger-celled ground-tissue, bounded 
finally by phellogen and cork.
Contrasting with this, the section of the zone through which 
the disarticulation of the branchlet occurs presents almost solely a 
lightly-stained parenchymatous tissue, of cells square in section, 
intersected with the transversely elongated cells of medullary rays, 
and having the vessels arranged in radiating planes, instead of 
promiscuously as in the branchlet ; the woody cells are very few, 
scattered in groups adjoining the vessels; in other sections the 
woody cells are quite absent ; the cambium and cortical system 
offer nothing peculiar.
Longitudinal sections made through the enlargement show the 
wood to cease on either side of this parenchymatous zone, the 
vessels alone being continued uninterruptedly through it; the 
same section shows the parenchyma of the articular zone to be 
composed of longitudinally elongated cells crucially intersected by 
planes of similar cells which form the medullary rays.
This 
absence of parenchyma and the free presence of vessels explains 
at once the readiness with which the branchlets admit of artificial 
detachment, and how it is that the construction of the parts allows 
of cell-changes by which a disarticulation may be effected similar 
to that which occurs in the active fall of a leaf.
The changes which precede and prepare the way for the fall of 
a branchlet are essentially the same as those which precede the 
fall of the leaf or other articulate organs.
A circular fissure in the 
cork along the middle of the swelling is the first outward and 
visible sign of the process proceeding within.
Longitudinal sections 
made in this stage exhibit beneath the microscope a transverse 
zone of cork already formed in the paren^iyma of the swelling 
beneath the circular fissure in the general cork.
The bast-fibres and vessels of the wood pass through the new- 
formed cork, and are indeed the only structures which really 
connect the deciduous part with the parent branch; both are 
ON THE FALL OF BKANCHLETS IN THE ASPEN (POPULUS TKEMULA).
309 
ruptured by the first slight violence, but the surface of the branch 
thus rudely exposed is already healed throughout by the cork, the 
ends of the vessels and the bast-fibres alone excepted — these project 
unhealed in the scar, though eventually the periodic growth of the 
parenchyma and cork buries them beneath the surface.
The pro- 
cess of healing is therefore quite different from that by which 
a fractured surface is closed over in other exogenous trees ; in 
these it occurs, as before noticed, by the progressive advance of 
new tissue produced from the cambium.
Such is the structure of comparatively recent scars in the 
Aspen, but in time wood is formed in the parenchyma or ground- 
tissue of the scar beneath the phellogen and cork, in conjunction 
with, and as an extension of, the yearly addition of wood to the 
general surface of the branch ; the ground-tissue produces a 
secondary wood-forming meristem in extension of the general 
cambium, which is normally continued around the parenchyma of 
the articular zone to the branchlet beyond, though these cambium 
cells do not under the ordinary circumstances produce woody tissue 
on the inner side, but furnish only the elongated parenchyma of 
the articular zone before described.
The reasons why the branchlets should be thus constructed, 
ready for such a disarticulation, and why they fall, are difficult to 
render.
Very often the fallen parts appear healthy, and have their 
buds and even leaves fresh on them.
Berkeley remarks, M The 
cause of death in the branches is uncertain, sometimes, perhaps, 
cold, or superior demand of other parts of the tree which divert that 
nourishment which was destined for their use." The fall occurs in 
the autumn ; after the cell-changes at the articulation have 
occurred a gale may strew the ground with branchlets, as it 
will disarticulate leaves when ready for their fall ; but the living 
process is a necessary antecedent to the detachment which does 
not own a purely mechanical causation.
Cladoptosis occurs in the other genus of the same natural order, 
viz., in the willow; and it occurs also in the oak, the scars of 
which closely resemble those of the Aspen, and are similarly 
formed, not by an overgrowing of new tissue from the cambium, 
but by a simultaneous healing of the entire surface.
Amongst 
trees not indigenous or acclimatized it occurs in some of the 
genera of the Artocarpaceffi, Antiaris to.ricaria (Upas tree) and 
Antiaris saccidora, as well as in.
Castilloa elastica, the india-rubber 
tree of Central America.
But why of all trees these few should be so constructed it is, to 
say the least, difficult to offer suggestions.
The natural history of 
the articulate stems of Oratmla arbor* teens may furnish some clue 
by analogy.
At times portions of this succulent will spontaneously 
fall without showing signs of an antecedent determining death, and 
such portions will spontaneously take root and propagate the 
plant — an event which is prone to happen when the nutritive 
demand and supply of the plant are unequal ; the parent stem 
detaches portions of its growth, which afterwards find an inde- 
pendent mode of existence.
And in the well known BryophylUim 
310 ON THE FLORA OF SOUTH BEDFORDSHIRE.
it is also true that leaves which spontaneously fall will produce 
buds and a crop of new plants, in the same way as will those which 
are prematurely removed by art for the same end.
The process in 
fact is an adventitious means of propagation.
And in the Aspen, 
as a mere conjecture, it may under circumstances be the same, but 
I have seen as yet no evidence of this.
Or is the reason to be dis- 
covered from a study of arboreal evolution ?
Perhaps such a study 
might show the peculiarity to be the remains of a method of 
propagation, remains which now fulfil no end, yet persist as well- 
nigh useless relics of a bygone process.
That the provision for 
such a separation is merely in anticipation of a death of the 
branchlets can scarcely be maintained, for such a death is of mere 
accident if it is only such as occurs in other trees, and in these no 
similar provision exists.
In the animal organism the death of a 
part is followed by active cell-changes which lead to its complete 
separation ; but I believe there is no instance of an original and 
abiding peculiarity of structure in any part, in anticipation of a 
death which is to be determined solely by accident.

IN ME MOBY OF THOMAS HUGHES CORRY.
It is happily but seldom that the pursuit of botany is attended 
with results so disastrous as those which we have had lately to 
deplore in the death of two Irish botanists — one of them already 
eminent in more than one branch of the science, the other, a 
comparatively recent student, but bidding fair to become a leading 
local authority.
But the investigation upon which Mr. T.
H. Corry 
and Mr. Charles Dickson were engaged terminated fatally and 
abruptly on Thursday, the 4th of August.
On the morning of that 
day the two gentlemen went out in a boat upon Lough Gill, for the 
purpose of examining the botany of the islands in the lake.
The 
weather was very boisterous, and the wind rough ; the boat was 
upset, and the two botanists were drowned.
Mr. Charles Dickson had comparatively lately take up the study 
of botany, but gave much promise of distinguishing himself in 
local investigation, having good powers of observation.
Of Mr.
Corry it is not too much to say that he stood in the first rank of 
our younger botanists ; and that the loss which our science has 
sustained by his death can hardly be over-estimated.
The masterly 
paper upon the floral development and fertilisation of Asclepias 
Cornnti, which he read at the Linnean Society last December, 
within a fortnight of his admission to that body, and which has 
since been published in their * Transactions,' at once established 
his position as a minute and careful observer.
His shorter notes, 
principally upon Irish plants, most of which have appeared in this 
Journal, presented him in another light as a painstaking and 
energetic field botanist.
Mr. Corry' s first published botanical note 
seems to have been one recording his rediscovery of Carex 
Buxbaumii at Lough Neagh, published in   Science-Gossip ' for 
1878, p.
187.
At the time of his death (at the early age of twenty-two), Mr.
Corry — who held at Cambridge the post of Lecturer in Botany in 
the University Medical and Science Schools and to Girton College, 
as well as that of Assistant Curator of the University Herbarium — 
was a candidate for the post of Examiner in Botany to the Irish 
Board of Intermediate Education.
A copy of his testimonials now 
before us gives a lengthy list of the honours which he had obtained.
The following notice from the pen of his friend Professor Babington 
will, we are sure, be read with interest : — 
" I cannot say too much in praise of my truly lamented 
friend Cony.
It is quite unnecessary for me to say that he was 
an excellent physiological botanist, for his papers published by 
the Linnean and other Societies prove this.
And from my 
personal knowledge I know him to have been exceedingly well 
acquainted with descriptive Botany.
Indeed in this latter de- 
partment he has been of the highest value to me.
I lose in him 
not only an excellent scientific helper, but also a very greatly 
valued friend.
"He was an admirable and indefatigable worker; indeed he 
314 SHORT NOTES.
often worked too hard for his health, which was never very strong 
during the time that I knew him.
There are several points in 
which I do not know how we can supply his place at Cambridge.
Irish Botany also loses quite as much as we do.
" I cannot close without bearing my testimony to the exceeding 
beauty of his character — modest and unassuming, so much so that 
his great attainments only became known on a very intimate 
acquaintance with him.
The memory of such a pure and unselfish 
life is a bright legacy ; very especially in the present day, when it 
is only too commonly found that young men seem to think and act 
as if their elders cannot know anything, from not having been 
educated in the so-called 'modern way.' Well will it be if the 
example so unfailingly set by our deeply lamented friend be followed 
wherever his name is known.
u He was also, as I have good reason to believe, fully prepared 
for the sudden change which removed him from faithful service 
here to the brighter service above.

SHORT NOTES.
A New British Moss.
— A short trip into Perthshire with my 
friend the Eev. J.
M. Crombie, has added another species to our 
steadily increasing list of Mosses.
It happened on this wise : on 
August 4th, sauntering over the moor near Tummel Bridge, I called 
my companion's attention to a fine rosy patch of Bryum pattens in the 
path, and stooping down I observed in the centre a little tuft of cap- 
sules of a different plant, which the lens at once showed me belonged 
to Trematodon ambiginis (Hed.) Hornsch., a species not hitherto 
recorded as British, though one quite to be expected, as it occurs 
sporadically all over Europe.
There were only nine capsules in 
the tuft, three of them equally in the calyptrate, operculate, and 
perist ornate condition ; and although search was made all round, 
no more plants were seen, and wet weather prevented a more 
extended scrutiny further up the valley towards Kinloch Bannoch, 
the most likely direction for it.
The Trematodontea constitute a 
subfamily of Dicranacea, remarkable for the long neck to the cap- 
sule, and represented in Europe by Trematodon ambigiius, brericollis 
and lonyicollis , and the cleistocarpous Bruchia Vogexiaca, Trobasiana 
and palustris.
As this family has just been completed in the 
i British Moss Flora/* a supplementary plate will be given at the 
end of the first volume, to include this and other novelties.

Hybernacula of Utricularia.
— Eeferring to Mr. H.
C. Hart's 
note on U.
intermedia, quoted at p.
246, I have noticed U.
minor 
behave in the same way when growing in shallow water ; when 
grown in deep water it behaves like U.
vulgaris, as described by 
Darwin ; and I suspect that the two modes of depositing the 
winter-bud are common to all our species, and result from the 
depth of water in which the plant occurs.
I presume that the 
stems of U.
intermedia do not survive the winter, and that the buds 
only "remain attached* ' until the stems decay in late autumn, as 
in the other species.
Perhaps Mr. Hart would experiment on 
U. intermedia grown in deep water ?

Myosurus minimus in "waste places." — In reply to Mr. Fryer's 
query (p.

the towing-path by the canal near Send, Surrey, associated with 
such plants as Papaver Argemone, Spergida arvensis, &c.

Cerastium holosteoides Fr.
— This Cerastium occurred on each 
side of the River Cree, between two and three miles south of 
Newton Stewart, in Wigton and Kirkcudbright, typical examples 
being obtained from both places; but, as in specimens obtained 
from the Perth locality, the pubescence on the stem varied from the 
two characteristic lines to a more general diffused pubescence.
The glabrous foliage and larger flowers, with the biennial growth, 
however, well mark the plant.

— On Sept.
11th, w r hile examining the plants of 
Greena Moor, in E.
Cornwall, Mr. T.
R. Archer Briggs and I found 
Vicia Orobus growing in considerable quantity in some rough furzy 
ground just above the right bank of a small stream flowing into 
the Tamar.
It seemed confined to the drier spots, appearing 
chiefly in and around the tufts of Ulex Galiii, with Viola lactea and 
Lathyrus macrorrhizus.
We saw perhaps a hundred plants in about 
an acre of ground, all past flowering and many with ripe fruit.

This first recorded Cornish station must be some fifteen miles or so 
from Mr. Husband's Devon station (the only one yet known for 
that county), the Bradworthy and Kilkhampton Boad.
On the 
following day (Sept.
12th) Mr. Briggs brought me Cicendia Jiliformis 
from two spots between Py worthy and North Tamerton, on the 
Devon side of the Tamar.
In one (a damp roadside) it extended 
for between twenty and thirty yards ; but at the other (on a 
neighbouring common) it appeared only, very sparingly.
This was 
not accepted as a Devon plant by Watson, although he knew it to 
have been vaguely reported as such in ' Flora Devoniensis,' and 
elsewhere.

at present.

Phanerogamic Beport for the Years 
1881 and 1882, by the Referees and Editor.
Manchester : 
Printed by James Collins.
1883.
Pp. 179-251.
This Beport contains, as usual, a large amount of matter of 
great interest to those who study the geographical distribution of our 
British plants.
It contains also critical notes of varying interest 
and importance, for which the Editor, Mr, F.
A. Lees, is mainly 
responsible.
We have no space for a detailed criticism, but may 
note two or three points in passing.
A variety of Veronica Anagallis 
is named glandulom by Mr. Lees, but seems from his description to 
have slender claims to a distinctive name.
A long editorial note 
on Orchis incur nata seems to us likely to add to the misunderstanding 
already existing as to that plant — a misunderstanding which we do 
not think Mr. Clarke fully cleared up, and on which Mr. Corry was 
preparing a paper for this Journal at the time of his lamented 
decease.
We doubt w T hether the plant so named in this Beport is 
in all cases the true incarnata ; and the date " July 5th" assigned 
to its flowering at Birkdale (Southport) is exceptionally late, it

being usually in full bloom in that locality by the middle of June.
Mr. Lees returns to the charge as to the naming of Carex piluUfera 
var.
Leesii, regarding which he seems to labour under a curious 
misconception.
We doubt if anyone has said — certainly we have 
never done so — that a name may not be employed as a varietal one, 
if originally used a specific appellation, but it is a mistake to sup- 
pose that such a use is obligatory ; and surely Mr. Lees cannot 
imagine that his "consent" could be necessary to the naming of 
the plant, or that the absence of such "consent" can justify him 
in saying that "the varietal title Leesii was improperly bestowed.
1 ' 
We are surprised to find that Dr. Boswell and Mr. Lees regard 
the Gloucestershire Lycopodium complanatum as merely L.
alpinum, 
although they differ in their estimate of its position, Dr. Boswell 
thinking it "pure and simple L.
alpinum," while Mr. Lees considers 
it as a "peculiar form" of that species, and (p.
200) further dis- 
tinguishes it as "a plane-leaved, lax non-fastigiate Var" Mr.
Carruthers, who drew up the description of the plant published in 
this Journal for 1882 (p.
322) has at our request kindly re-examined 
the specimen, and carefully compared it with the large series of 
foreign specimens in the British Museum Herbarium ; he has no 
hesitation in referring it to complanatum, in which opinion, it will 
be remembered, Prof.
Babington and Mr. Baker coincide.
The heading " New County Records" is likely to mislead those 
who do not understand it in the sense of the Club as including 
records "additional to 'Topographical Botany' and the Record 
Club Reports, 1873-1880." Thus many of Mr. Ridley's Radnor- 
shire plants (Journ.
Bot., 1881, 170-174) appear here as "new 
county records" on the authority of the Rev. A.
Ley ; so with the 
Rev. W.
M. Rogers's N.
Devon Plants (J.
Bot., 1882, pp.
9-16), and 
Mr. Druce's E.
Perth plants (Id., pp.
80-83); as well as with such 
plants as Erythr&a capitata, Cineraria spathulafolia, and many more 
e. g., Salic Smithiana, here recorded for N.
Somerset as new, but 
included by Mr. Baker in his list of Somerton plants (J.
Bot., 1875, 
p. 3G0).
Readers of this Journal, to many of whom the Record 
Club Reports are inaccessible, would do well to note that Carex 
rigida, recorded from East Perth by Mr. Druce (in J.
Bot., 1882, 
p. 82), is "doubtful," while Mr. Roper's Agrostis setacea (J.
Bot., 
1881, p.
373) is correctly referred by Mr. Lees to Festuca ovina.
We may add that Mr. Roper informs us his Lepidium ruderale in 
the same paper should be L.
sativum.
We venture to think it would lend additional value to the 
Report were the plants of certain groups handed over for naming 
to those who are known to have paid special attention to them.
Mr. Arthur Bennett, for instance, is as identified with the Pota- 
mogetons as are the Messrs.
Groves with the Charas, and their 
opinion upon plants of these groups would be of special value.
Among the " aliens, casuals, and escapes" may be noted records 
of Potentilla norvegica from Middlesex, Hertfordshire, and South- 
West Yorkshire ; and Anthoxanthum Puelii from Herefordshire.
These two plants seem likely to become permanent additions to 
our Flora.
318 NOTICES OF BOOKS.
Under the title ' The Student's Guide to Structural, Morpho- 
logical, and Physiological Botany' (J.
A. Churchill & Co.) Prof.
Bentley has issued a compact little volume intended to "serve as 
an introduction to the author's   Manual of Botany,' and other 
larger and more comprehensive works.' ' Much care has been 
exercised in bringing the book up to date ; the illustrations are 
numerous and well executed ; and the volume cannot, we think, 
fail to be of great service as an introduction, not only to "larger 
works," but to the study of the science of which it treats.
The recently issued part (fasc.
xc.) of the ' Flora Brasiliensis ' 
concludes the Graminea, the Andropogonm and Tristeginea, of 
which it consists, being undertaken by M.
E. Hackel.
Dr. Cooke has issued the concluding part of the second 
volume of his ' Illustrations of British Fungi,' with index to 
vols.
i. and ii.
It is intended to proceed forthwith with the 
publication of the ' Illustrations ' of the remaining sections of 
Agaricus, which it is estimated will occupy two volumes similar 
in extent to those already issued.
We regret to learn that the 
work does not receive the support which it certainly deserves, 
which probably accounts for the somewhat high price charged for 
the Index number.
The second number of vol.
xii.
of ' English Botany ' (No. 85 of 
the whole work) succeeds the first with commendable promptitude.
It contains five new plates — Lastrea Thelypteris, L.
remota, L.
uliginosa, L.
glandulosa, and L.
amula — showing so marked an 
improvement upon the remainder, especially those of the old 
'English Botany,' that we regret that there are not more of 
them.
Messrs.
Cassell & Co. have begun a reissue of Mr. Britten's 
1 European Ferns.' 
Those botanists who are interested in the relations between 
insects and flowers should take note that the two papers on the 
subject read by Mr. A.
W. Bennett and Mr. R.
M. Christy before 
the Linnean Society (summarised at pp.
219, 220) have been 
published by that body in the Zoological portion of the ' Journal ' 
(No. 100).
We must suppose that the Council had some reason 
for so doing, but it seems to us that they would have been more in 
place in the Botanical section of the   Journal.' 
Mr. T.
R. Archer Briggs sends us a second instalment of his 
1 Queries in Local Topographical Botany,' reprinted from the 
' Transactions of the Plymouth Institution' for 1882-83.
We 
have before expressed our opinion ( Journ.
Bot. 1882, p.
376) of 
the great usefulness of papers of this kind ; and having noticed 
the first part somewhat at length, it is only necessary to say that 
the second is equal to it in value and interest.
It is mainly 
occupied with the UmbellifertB of Devon and Cornwall, the history 
of Physospermum comubiense as a British plant being especially 
interesting.
ARTICLES IN JOURNALS, 319 
From Prof.
Sereno Watson we have received part xi.
of his 
useful 'Contributions to American Botany,' which contains the 
conclusion of the list of Dr. Palmer's South- Western Texas and 
North Mexico plants, and a ' Description of some new Western 
species.' In the former paper two new genera of Liliacece 
Glyphosperma and Hemiphylacus — are established.
Under the title « Finland : its Forests and Forest Management/ 
Dr. J.
Croumbie Brown has published (Oliver & Boyd, Edinburgh) 
the third of a series of volumes, the publication of which has been 
undertaken as a contribution to the literature of Forest Science.
Like its predecessors, it is an interesting and readable compilation, 
containing much information about the subject of which it treats.

Roxburgh expressly states 
that his tree has no male, but only hermaphrodite and female

but could never find female flowers or fruit.
" In all other respects 
the specimens, as also those of Mr. Carles, agree so entirely with 
Roxburgh's description, and with the late Mr. Hanbury's figure 
(Notes on Chinese Mat. Med.

identity.

NOTES ON VEGETABLE PEODUCTS OF THE SAHA- 
EANPUE & DEHEA DUN DISTEICTS, N.W. INDIA.
By J.
F. Duthie, M.A., F.L.S.
(Continued from p.
181.) 
Pulses.
Chana or Gram {Cicer arietinum L.) — The seed of this plant 
affords an important ingredient of horse's food in this part of 
India ; the stalks and leaves mixed with chaff (blmsa) also con- 
stitute an excellent fodder both for cattle and horses.
The seeds 
are eaten by the natives, either made into bread, or sweetmeats, or 
as dal, or parched (chabena).
There are three or four varieties of 
gram, differing chiefly in the colour and size of the seeds, being 
white, brown, yellow or blackish.
One kind, with large white seeds, 
called " Cabuli Chana," is occasionally met with, but is not much 
grown in this district.
Gram is cultivated during the cold season ; 
it is not often sown by itself, but usually mixed with wheat or 
barley, or with other kinds of pulse, such as peas and Lathyrus 
sativus (Kasari).
The peculiar shape of the seed, resembling the 
head of a ram, explains the specific name arietinum.
The plant is 
said to produce oxalic acid to such an extent as to cause pain to 
the feet when walking barefooted through a field of grain.
Mung (Phaseolus Mungo L.) is a rainy season crop, and is 
usually sown mixed with some land of millet, or with cotton.
This and the two following are coarse, hairy, trailing plants, and 
not much esteemed for human food.
The seed differs in colour, 
being green, yellow (sona miing), or black.
The stalks and leaves 
are much valued as cattle -fodder.
The natives use it chiefly in 
the form of d&l, and the food is sometimes given to horses when 
gram fails.
Urd or Mash (P.
Mungo L., var.
radiatiis).
— This is cultivated 
and made use of hi the same manner as the preceding.
There are 
two sub varieties, the one with black and the other with smaller 
green seeds.
The seed of this plant is supposed to have given rise 
to the weight called " masha," the twelfth part of a tola.
Moth (P.
aconitif alius Jacq.).
— This possesses little value as a 
source of human food.
The stalks and leaves are given to cattle, 
as well as the seeds, which are very fattening.
This crop is 
cultivated during the rainy season on the very poorest soils, either 
by itself or with bajra (Pennisetum typhoidetm).
Lobiya {Vigna Catiang Endl.) is another rainy season crop.
It 
is grown in the plains, and on the hills up to about 4000 feet, 
hardly ever by itself, but mixed with millet or cotton.
It is 
very variable, sometimes being met with as a short erect plant ; 
another variety has long climbing stems ; there is a good deal of 
difference too in the colour of the seeds, being white, brown, yellow 
or black.
The pods are eaten as vegetables, and the seeds form an 
ingredient in curries.
The stems and leaves are given to cattle.
Sem (Dolichos Lablab L.).
— This is grown in the cold season, 
chiefly as a garden crop.
It is an extensive cliinber, and is often 
826 NEW RECORDS FOR RUBI IN SOMERSET.
trained so as to form arbours, or to cover the doorways and roofs 
of houses.
Roxburgh describes several varieties.
The flowers are 
white or purple, and there is one variety with reddish purple pods 
(D.
pwpureus L.).
The pods are eaten as a vegetable.
Mas ur or Lentils (Ervum Lens L.).
— This is not much grown 
in the district, being chiefly confined to low-lying damp situations.
It is a cold season crop.
The seeds are eaten as a dal, but are not 
considered wholesome ; the flour, however, is said to be the chief 
constituent of the preparation known as Revalenta Arabica.
Mattar or Field Pea (Pisiwi sativum L.).
— Also grown during 
the cold season, but to a very small extent in this district.
There 
are two distinct kinds, the one with round white seeds, and the 
other with compressed marbled seeds, this latter constituting the 
subspecies P.
arvense L.
Kasari or Climbing Vetch (Lathy rus sativus L.).
— This plant,' 
which is cultivated during the cold season, is chiefly remarkable 
for its tendency to bring about paralysis of the limbs if eaten in 
excess.
It thrives under conditions which cannot be endured by 
other kinds of pulse, and this accounts for its extensive cultivation 
on some of the village lands where the soil is suited to it.
It 
prefers a heavy clay soil, and is not affected by inundations of 
water and subsequent parching of the ground.
Pigeon Pea, Tor or Arhar [Cajcmus indicns Spreng.).
— The 
latter name (Arhar) is that of a variety known as C.
indicus, var.
tricolor, and is the kind most commonly cultivated about here.
It 
is distinguished from the typical form by having the standard 
streaked with red veins instead of being simply yellow.
Although 
sown with the rainy season crops it remains in the ground through- 
out the cold weather, and is reaped with the crops of the latter 
season.
There is, however, a small variety which ripens its seeds 
much earlier.
It is sometimes sown by itself, but more generally 
accompanies juar bajra or cotton.
It is largely grown in Dehra 
Dim, but in the Saharanpur district it is used chiefly as a hedge 
round the borders of sugar-cane fields in order to protect the young 
canes from the wind.
The seed is considered to be wholesome, 
and is largely consumed in the form of dal.
Guar or Khurti (Cyamopsis psoral hides DC).
— This is a rainy 
season crop, and is much cultivated in some parts of the district 
for its seed, which is given to cattle ; a smaller variety is also 
grown for the sake of its pods, which are eaten as a vegetable.
The same use is also made of this plant as a wind-protector as was 
mentioned in the case of the pigeon pea.

SUSSEX PLANT S.
By James W.
White.
The following notes were made during a recent short visit to 
Broadbridge Farm, situate midway between Horsham and the village 
of Slinfold.
The soil is chiefly clay ; cold and unproductive.
Malva moschata L.
— Frequent in hedgerows.
Lotus tenuis Kit.
— Abundant at and about the 'StonefiekT 
near Slinfold.
The plants are large, each root producing several 
decumbent filiform stems about two feet in length, and very much 
branched and entangled.
The extreme forms have quite linear 
leaflets, and solitary pods.
L. corniculatus L.
and L.
major Scop, 
are also there in plenty, and I observed some plants intermediate 
in character between the former and L.
tenuis.
Potentilla aryentea L.
— Some very luxuriant plants grow at 
328 
BEDFORDSHIRE 
the 'Stonefield' already mentioned; two had at least a dozen 
stems of fifteen to twenty inches from each root.
This species had 
been also noticed at a former visit in 1878.
Pyrus torminalis Ehrli.
— There are several large trees thirty to 
forty feet high in hedgerows and on the outskirts of woodland on 
the high ground called 'Kaplans.' These trees, though not 
flowering at all this year, in some seasons produce abundance of 
fruits, which much resemble a small medlar, and are locally 
termed "serbs." When ripe they are gathered by the farm- 
labourers, and fastened on sticks after the fashion of onion- strings, 
but with a handle at one end; each stick having three or four 
pounds of fruit attached to it, and finding a market at the price of 
a shilling or fifteenpence.
Torilis infesta L.
— Frequent in cornfields.
Galium tricorne With.
— Also frequent.
Valerianella dentata Poll.
— Some oat- fields were thickly sprinkled 
with this plant ; many specimens were seen in which some of the 
flowers had developed a large rotate and regular calyx, the 
divisions often tipped with red, and giving the plant a very 
singular appearance.
Achillea Ptarmica L.
— Sparingly in the meadows.
Euphorbia platyphylla L.
— Among oats in small quantity.
Gastridium lendigerum Gaud.
— I saw this among wheat in 
several places ; one field was almost full of it, scarcely any other 
weed being present.
I have never met with this grass as a weed 
of cultivation elsewhere.
Polystichum aculeatum Both.
— Typical and plentiful.
The only 
fern noticed on the farm besides bracken.

B. Archer Briggs, F.L.S.
Last year I contributed some notes on the botany of the portion 
of Cornwall lying between the town of Bodmin and its north coast 
by Portquin and Port Isaac Bays, forming part of the basin of the 
Camel or Allan Eiver (Journ.
Bot. 1882, pp.
231-238).
In the June 
of this year I was enabled to carry on a further investigation of the 
same tract whilst on a visit at Lavethan, in the parish of Blisland, 
from the 18th to the 23rd of that month.
The following notes are 
the result of observations made during those six days : — 
Ranunculus hirsutiis Curt.
— St. Minver, and between this village 
and St. Kew.
Stations are named in my former paper, and the 
plant is one of the characteristic species of the tract, though yet 
more frequent in some parts of Cornwall further west.

J. Pike Jones and Mr. Anderson noticed long ago in a more western 
part of the county, and of which we find the former writing as 
follows in his ' Botanical Tour in Devon and Cornwall ' (p.
85) : — 
"In the corn-fields about Zennar and St. Ives we discovered a 
species of Brassica which answers in almost every respect to 
Brassica campestris.
I have observed the same plant about More- 
ton and North Bovey, in Devonshire.
This plant being, however, 
extremely rare in England, I expressed some doubts to Mr. Ander- 
son on the subject.
In answer to my letter he says, ' My specimens 
are not quite competent to ascertain decidedly this rare species.
I 
intend to cultivate it.' His sudden death prevented my hearing 
again from him on the subject.
I hope some future botanist will 
determine the point.' ' The cultivated rape has larger and fewer 
flowers than this Brassica, and its open one3 are more racemosely 
arranged.

— Left bank of the Camel between Tre- 
sarret and Dunmeer Bridges.
Acer campestre Li.
— A few bushes in one place in a hedgerow 
between St. Teath Mill and St. Tudy Village.

stow.
Vicia tetrasperma Moench.
— Towards Bodmin from Dunmeer.
Primus insititia L, — Between Amble and St. Minver.
The 
shrub presumed to be identical with P.
fruticcms Weihe, and an 
undoubtedly indigenous one in Devon and Cornwall, seemingly 
generally diffused throughout the counties.
P. Cerasus L.
— Between Wineford and Camelford ; between St.
Kew and the Wadebridge and Camelford Road ; between St. Teath 
and St. Tudy.
This is so frequent in hedgerows in Devon and 
Cornwall, and occurs under such conditions, as to quite entitle it 
to a place in the denizen list.
Agrimonia odorata Mill.
— A plant noticed by the tramway in the 
Camel Valley near Poleys Bridge.
Alchemilla vulgaris L.
— In a waste spot by the Bodmin and 
Launceston Road, just before you enter on Bodmin Down.
This 
station is possibly just beyond the Camel River basin and within 
that of the Fowey ; but, as the plant appears to be extremely 
scarce in E.
Cornwall, it is desirable to put its occurrence at the 
place on record.
Potentilla procumhms Sibth.
— Quite common.
Bodmin ; St.
Tudy ; St. Kew ; St. Teath.
Between Blisland and Camelford.
Ridnts rhamnifolius W.
& N.
— Near Blisland, by the road to 
Camelford.
The Bramble of the Rhamnifolii group mentioned in 
the 'Flora of Plymouth' under R.
Lindleianus as ''allied to 
ZAndleianuB " is one of the commonest Rubi in the Camel basin, as 
it seems to be throughout Devon and Cornwall.
I may here 
mention that I have recently detected it at several spots in the 
county of Somerset.

— Between Blisland and Camelford.
Between 
St. Kew and the Wadebridge and Camelford Road ; in one place 
with white flowers ; also in this locality another slight variety with 
leaves somew r hat glaucous above, which is very unusual in R.
micrantha.
Between Amble and St. Minver.
Quite a common 
species in Cornwall.
Judging from its plentiful occurrence, and 
the rarity of R.
rubiginosa, with which it was formerly confused, 
there is little doubt that this is the species the historian of the 
county, Dr. Borlase, had in view in the following extract : — " It 
is suggested that the sweet-brier, or eglantine, does not grow 
naturally in Cornwall ; but this is a great mistake, as, from expe- 
rience, I can aver having plucked this perfumed plant out of the 
hedges in the neighbourhood of Mount's Bay, and transplanted 
them into my own garden, where they flower in as great perfection 
as anywhere, and may be easily multiplied by seeds, slips, or 
cuttings/ ' — Nat. Hist.
Corn., 224, 1758.
At the present day 
-R.
micrantha is to be met with in cottage gardens in the county, as 
well as R.
rtibiginosa.
R. canina L.
— a.
lutetiana, between Wineford and Camelford.
e. dumalis, between Denhanis Bridge and St. Endellion ; St. Kew ;

Bridge and St. Endellion.
j. dumetorum, in a hedge as you descend 
to Poleys Bridge from St. Tudy.
n. andevagerms, a fine robust

Amble towards St. Minver ; also this variety in one or two other 
spots near St. Minver.
R. leticochroa Desv.
— Between Amble and St. Minver.
Mespilns germanica L.
— For about eight yards in a hedge be- 
tween St. Mabyn Village and Denhams Bridge, a spot intermediate 
between two of the stations that I previously recorded ( Journ.
Bot.
1882, 234) ; for about ten yards in a hedgerow between St. Tudy 
Village and St. Teath Mill, two or three miles from the other 
stations.
Cratagus Oxyacantha L., b.
monogyna.
— Two or three bushes of a 
slight variety with remarkably large leaves by the Camelford Boad, 
near Michaelstow.
Pyrus torminalu Ehrh.
— Further observations confirm the 
opinion as to this being a rather common species in the tract.
The following are additional stations : — Hedge between St. Mabyn 
and Denhams Bridge ; in two spots between St. Kew and the 
Wadebridge and Camelford Boad, and in one between St. Kew and 
St. Minver ; also between St. Tudy and St. Teath Mill.
P. communis L.
— Two very small bushes on a hedge-bank 
between St. Kew and St. Minver.
In a hedge by Bodmin Down a 
large bush grows a little below the Bodmin and Launceston Boad,

but the spot is just beyond the basin of Camel Eiver and within 
that of the Fowey.
P. Aucuparia Gaertn.
— Between St. Teath and St. Tudy ; near 
Michaelstow Beacon.
Whilst P.
torminalis increases in frequency 
in the warmer portions of country, P.
Aucuparia becomes com- 
moner in the colder and elevated ones.
P. Mains L., a.
acerba.
— Between St. Tudy and St. Teath 
Mill.
This is an unquestionably indigenous shrub in Cornwall and 
Devon.

— St. Minver.
Smyrnmm Olusatrum L.
— Tregenna Hamlet, Blisland ; St. Tudy ; 
St. Minver, and between this village and St. Kew.
Galium verum L.
— St. Minver.
The somewhat local distri- 
bution of this species in Cornwall and Devon makes it desirable to 
note stations for it.
As this peculiarity applies in a measure to 
Galium Mollttgo L.
also, it is worth while to add that it abounds in 
the Camel Basin, as about Plymouth.

LOCAL CATALOGUES USED IN PREPARING WATSON'S 
* TOPOGRAPHICAL BOTANY/ 
By B.
Daydon Jackson, Sec. L.S.
Since the recent puhlication of the second edition of Watson's 
1 Topographical Botany ' it has been suggested that an account of 
the lists and similar material upon which that work was based 
would be acceptable to British botanists.
I have therefore made 
an enumeration of the various local lists and MS.
floras, which are 
preserved in the Library of the Kew Herbarium, using the titles 
as written upon them by Watson himself, and closing with a local 
index to the names mentioned.
The running numbers correspond 
to the number in pencil on each article.
There are extant two interleaved copies of the first edition 
of   Topographical Botany,' with considerable additions by the 
author, but they are not precisely alike as to the contained 
entries ; one of these is in the Library at Kew, the other is the 
private property of Mr, J.
G. Baker.
Besides these, there are eight 
quarto volumes, consisting of sheets with the numbers of each 
county and vice-county, three folio volumes lettered ' Cybele, Census 
of Species, 7 and three others styled ' Cybele, Topographical Botany.' 
These were the scaffolding by means of which "Watson elaborated 
the works by which he will be enduringly remembered.
The dates 
of the copies of ' London Catalogue ' he used will be of interest, 
as showing his systematic method of working by means of trust- 
worthy correspondents.
The whole of his papers and catalogues 
were loose (for intercalation) during his lifetime, but have been 
bound since their transfer to Kew. I may also mention that a very 
large number of labels, arranged and numbered in proper order, 
may be seen on the shelves of the Library ; they seem to have been 
the foundation for his ' New Botanist's Guide.' 
Whilst I am writing it may not be out of place to state that the 
date of Hewett Cottrell Watson's birth was May 9th, 1804, accord- 
ing to the tombstone in Thames Ditton Churchyard.

SHORT NOTES.
Gnaphalium ihoicum in Hants.
— I have lately received from the 
Rev. William L.
W. Eyre, of Swarraton Rectory, Alresford, speci- 
mens of Gnaphalium dioicum, of which he informs me he has found 
a considerable patch in the parish of Swarraton, and in a situation 
which would warrant its being held as indigenous.
This adds 
another species to the Flora of Hampshire, bringing those of Mr.
Watson's Scottish type to the number of 15 instead of 14.
— Fredk.
Townsend.
Senecio viscosus in Cambridgeshire ?
— In the second edition of 
' Topographical Botany ' Senecio vucostcs is not admitted as a Cam- 
bridgeshire plant.
At page 225 Mr. Watson writes : — " The mistake 
of giving the name of this species to examples of Senecio si/lvaticus 
has been so frequent that I hesitate to enumerate any of the 
following counties as certain," 29 then being given amongst many 
doubtful records.
On turning to Professor Babington's ' Flora of 
Cambridgeshire 1 the plant in question is found to be inserted 
wholly on the authority of the older botanists— in this instance 
Kay and Relhan only; and at page 315, Appendix No. ix., it is 
included in the list which M contains the names of those plants

which, although recorded upon good authority as natives of Cam- 
bridgeshire, have not been found there for very many years." 
Ray, in his Cat. PL Cant., 1660, p.
154, gives as localities for his 
Senecio hirsutus viscidus major odoratus, u on all the Fen banks 
almost in the Isle of Ely " ; and again in his Cat. PL Angliae, 1670, 
M on the Fen-banks in the Isle of Ely, plentifully." In Relhan's 
Flora Cant., ed.
] (1775), p.
315, the localities given for Senecio 
viscosus are " Gramlingay, Mepole, Qhatteress" ; and in the 3rd ed.
(1820) he repeats the three localities with no further additions, but 
under the subsequent number gives Senecio sylvaticus (not mentioned 
in the 1st edition) as occurring at " Hildersham, on the Furze Hills." 
In Babington's * Flora of Cambridgeshire ' we find the localities for 
this latter species are — " 1, Furze Hills, Hildersham; 3, Gam- 
lingay," both given on his personal authority.
During eight years' 
careful search with a view to rediscover Senecio viscosus, I have 
failed to find it on or about the fen banks or other ancient localities 
given by Ray and Relhan for the Isle of Ely ; but Senecio sylvaticus 
has occurred plentifully in the parishes of Mepal, Chatteris, Sutton, 
Benwick, "Wimblington, Manca, and March, in District 7 of the 
Flora of Cambs., and more rarely in Witcham Fen, in District 6.
The question naturally arises — Has the one plant died out and been 
replaced by the other in the same localities only, or was there an 
error in the older records ?
— Alfred Fryer.
Rubus saxatilis in N.
Devon.
— My friend, the Rev. Ernest 
Ellman, has shown me a dried piece of Rubus saxatilis which he 
gathered in the valley of the East Lyn, near Brendon, North Devon, 
early in June last.
He informs me that the plant occurs there in 
fair quantity.
— T.
R. Archer Briggs.
East Cornwall Plants.
— On Sept.
14th Mr. Briggs and I were 
at Bude, and on Summerleaze Down found over a dozen small 
plants of Krigeron acris, a species which in * Topographical Botany* 
(ed.
2) is not' reported for East Cornwall.
Earlier in the same day 
he had found on the other side of the bay about half a dozen patches 
of Carduus aeaulis, recorded in this Journal for 1873, p.
39, by the 
Kev. Dr.
Hind from "Bude," but not treated as a Cornish plant by 
Watson.
In the same locality were a large number of plants of 
Gentiana Amarella, which appears not to have been before met with 
anywhere further east in the county than the neighbourhood of 
Truro (see Keys 1 'Flora of Devon and Cornwall').

A Suggestion.
— Will you allow me to suggest that it would be 
well for those who record new, " critical," or rare species of British 
plants in the   Journal of Botany,' to send confirmatory specimens 
to be placed in the National Herbarium at the British Museum ?
The pursuance of this plan would not only afford additional security 
against false records, but it would enable those botanists who are 
unable or unwishful to avail themselves of Mr. F.
A. Lees' able 
censorship to establish, on occasion, their right to priority of record.
I have set aside and will forward to you for the National Herbarium 
specimens of such plants as I have recorded in your pages, and on 
348 SHORT NOTES.
the tickets I propose to write, in addition to the usual information, 
the names of those botanists who have helped me to determine the 
critical species.
— Alfred Fryer.
[Mr. Fryer's suggestion is an excellent one, and we shall be glad 
if our readers will act upon it.
The British Herbarium of the Natural 
History (British) Museum is now very extensive, a circumstance 
largely owing, so far as more recent accessions are concerned, 
to the thoughtful liberality of many of our contributors.

Vicia Orobus DC.
in S.
Devon.
— On p.
316 I spoke of Mr.
Husband's N.
Devon station as "the only one yet known for that 
county." This is an error.
In the 'Botanical Record Club Report 
for 1879' it is recorded for S.
Devon (from Anstey's Cove, Torbay) 
by Mr. Rossall.
Probably it will yet be found elsewhere in both 
counties.

New Surrey Plants.
— The following additions to the county 
lists have recently come under my notice : — Viola lactea Sm. Turfy 
ground, Copthorne.
I first observed the withered leaves of this 
species in November, 1882, and have this year found it in several 
places in the neighbourhood.
It also occurs on that part of Cop- 
thorne Common which is in Sussex, for which county it is the most 
northerly record.
— Stellaria umbrosa Opitz.
Shady banks between 
Wootton Hatch and Shalford.
Certainly a rare species in the 
county ; I know of no station for it but the above, in which it is 
abundant.
— Arctium nemorosum Lej. Not unfrequent in thickets 
on the chalk range, occurring also about Leigh, and at Ockley.
The distribution of this genus is but imperfectly worked out as yet.
Onaphalium uliginosum, var.
t>ilulare.
Roadside between Leigh 
and Newdigate.
Numerous specimens have been examined by Mr.
A. Bennett and myself without detecting the variety, until this 
year, when I found it in the above station, where it occurs 
sparingly with the type.
— Hypochceris glabra, var.
Balbisii.
Fallow 
field near Send.
Found by Mr. Thomas Howse, growing with 
Silme conica.
The latter undoubtedly, both perhaps, introduced.
— 
Potamoyeton Zizii M.
& K.
Hedge Court Mill-pond, near Felbridge.
This species has escaped notice until this year, when, the water 
being very low, I found it in abundance.
Floating leaves are freely 
produced in this station, — Alisma lariceolatum With.
Probably widely 
distributed, but not so common as A.
Plantago.
I have seen it 
at Brockhatn Bridge, Weybridge, and near Pirbright.
— Iikj/nchospora 
fusca Rom.
& Sch. Bog on Thursley Common, near Farnham.
Found last summer by Mr. E.
S. Marshall.
I visited the locality 
in August, and found the j>lant to occur in the greatest profusion, 
but apparently confined to the bog in which Mr. Marshall first 
observed it.
Interesting as an eastward extension of the range of 
a purely western plant, and the best addition to the county list that 
has been made for some years.
The occurrence of this plant is 
suggestive, and a careful examination of the heaths and commons 
which cover so large a portion of the south-western corner of the 
county would very probably be rewarded by the discovery of other 
Hants plants.
— W.
H. Beeby.
SHORT NOTES.
349 
On the generic names Dantia and Prouvenzalia.
— In Bentham 
and Hooker's ' Genera Plantarum,' i.
788, there is given, as a 
synonym of Ltidwigia, "Dantia Thou.
Gen. Nov.
Madag.
n. 49, 
ex DeC, in opere tamen citato nomine deest," and, indeed, not 
being a Mascarene plant, it could not occur therein.
The genus 
was originally published in the "Lettres d'un Medecin des Hopitaux 
du Eoy a un autre Medecin de ses Amis," of which a copy has been 
recently obtained for the Library of the Botanical Department of the 
British Museum.
It is apparently a very scarce work, and was 
published at Namur in 1710.
There is no author's name upon 
the title-page, but the work was written by Francois Pourfour 
du Petit.
The first two letters are respectively upon the human 
brain and chemistry, the third "contient une critique sur les trois 
especes de Chrysosplenium des Instituts de Mr. de Tournefort, trois 
nouveaux genres de Plantes, et quelques nouvelles Especes.
" The 
three genera are Dantia, Prouvenzalia, and Calamus.
Dantia 
palustris Petit (Liidwigia palustris Ell.) is quoted by Linmeus, 
Sp. Plant, ed.
L, 1753, vol.
i. p.
120, as "Dantia palustria Petit 
gen.
49, t.
49"; DeCandolle, Prod.
hi.
61, alters it to "Du Petit 
Thouars gen.
49." Hooker, in the ' Genera Plantarum,' omits the 
" Du Petit," so that all trace of the connection of the name with 
the original paper is lost.
The name was given in honour of " Mr.
Danti D'Isnard," whom Linnaeus subsequently commemorated by 
naming the same plant Imardia.
Prouvenzalia palustris was the 
name given by Petit to the plant now known as Calla palustris L., 
to commemorate M.
de Prouvenza, Physician to the Duchess of 
Montpensier and one of his botanical friends.
Linnaeus quotes it 
(Gen. Plant, ed.
i., p.
276; ed.
vi., p.
471) as li Provenzalia Petit 
gen.
p. 45, " as a synonym of Calla.
Adanson (Fain.
Nat. ii.
469) 
copies this, and in the   Genera Plantarum ' it is quoted by Hooker 
from Adanson without any reference either to Linnaeus or Petit, as 
if Adanson was the inventor of the name.
Calamus, the third 
genus, is a synonym of Acorns, and is quoted by Linnaeus (Gen.
ed.
i., p.
104) as " Calamus Aromaticus Petit gen." It is not 
mentioned in the ' Genera Plantarum.' — -H.
N. Eidley.
New British Plants.
— Two very interesting additions to our 
British Flora were announced at the Southport Meeting of the 
British Association by the Ashton-under-Lyne Biological Society, 
viz., Cham Braunii Gmel., first found by myself and Mr. Armitage 
on August 28th, near Ashton-under-Lyne, whilst engaged in working 
up the flora of the district ; and also a Caulinia, probably alaynensis 
Delile, found by Messrs.
Lee and Bertenshaw September 1st, in 
the same locality.

ON XAJAS MARINA L.
AS A BKITISH PLANT.
P 
By Arthur Bennett, F.L.S.
(Plate 241.) 
Those who have followed the progress of British Botany during 
the last two or three years cannot fail to have been struck with the 
special attention which has been given to water-plants, and to the 
interesting results which have rewarded the investigations of the 
Messrs.
Groves into the British Characea, as well as those to which 
I have been able to bring into notice hi the Naiadacece.
That this 
source of interest is not yet exhausted is evident from the note at 
p. 349 of this Journal, recording the discovery of another Chara 
and Naias new to.
Britain.
Only a short time before, I had the 
pleasure of recording (p.
246) the discovery in England of the 
subject of the present paper.
It occurred in one place at Hickling 
Broad, East Norfolk; in good quantity, and elsewhere rarely, for 
about the length of a mile.
With it were growing Potamogeton 
pectinatiis, Chara stelligera, C.
polyacantha, 0.
hisjnda, &c.
By far 
the greater portion of the bottom of Hickling Broad is covered by a 
dense growth of Chara aspera, and I think it must be this plant — 
which grows literally by the acre !
— to which Mr. T.
Southwell refers 
in Lubbock's ' Fauna of Norfolk,' ed.
2, p.
137.
Mr. Lubbock 
speaks of the water at Hickling Broad being " shallow, and 
abounding with a particular weed, Pochard Grass as it is called/ 1 
on which the Pochard Duck is accustomed to feed ; and Mr. South- 
well adds, "I cannot discover to what plant this name was applied; 
probably it was given to some species of Potamogeton" The Najas 
since has been collected by Mr. H.
Groves, and Messrs.
B. King 
and Druce.

Plant entirely submerged.
Roots simple, long, from the base 
and lower nodes.
Stem 3 in.
to 9 in.
in British specimens 
(simple in small examples), branching from the base, with 
scattered broad-based teeth.
Leaves opposite, linear, -| in.
to 
2 in.
long, repand-dentate; teeth mucronate ; the apex, when fresh, 
purplish.
Sheaths entire.
Flowers dioecious, axillary, solitary, 
half enclosed in the sheathing base of the leaves.
Female flowers 
with 2-3 stigmas.
Male flowers oblong, with the anthers enclosed 
in a thin sac, 2-3-toothed, and bursting irregularly at the top.
Fruit £ in.
long, ovate- oblong, purplish when fresh, changing to a 
reddish brown.
The species is somewhat variable, the marine forms having less 
dentate leaves and longer internodes.
In Sir J.
E. Smith's Her- 
barium at the Linnean Society is a specimen ticketed " Isle de 
Bourbon, H.
L. fil."; this I have little doubt is the same as one in 
the Kew Herbarium named " N.
palustrina Commerson ; in Bor- 
bonia, Commerson," and is probably marina.
N. intermedia Wolfgang comes in habit about half-way between 
X. marina and X.
minor All.
{Caulinia fragilis W.), but is referable 
to X.
marina.
Thuillier's specimens in Herb.
Mus. Brit., named 
by himself, seem only local states of the plant.
N. minor, from its 
European distribution, may be found in Britain, as it occurs in 
Germany, Holland, Belgium, and France, but is wanting in the 
Scandinavian countries, except Finland.
The plate gives the impression of a plant somewhat more robust 
than usual ; but our British plant is much stouter than any others 
I have seen ; and herbarium specimens lose much of their bulk in 
drying.
The one drawn was quite as stout as the figure when fresh 
and floating in a white shallow dish — too great depth of water 
magnifies plants.

LOBELIA URENS L.
IN CORNWALL, WITH NOTES 
ON ITS SINGLE DEVON STATION, 
By T.
B. Archer Briggs, F.L.S.
Lobelia terms L., hitherto considered to grow in the United 
Kingdom in the county of Devon only, will henceforth have to be 
accounted a snecies of the sister countv of Cornwall also.
To a 
Woods 
author of 
1 Tourists' Flora/ belongs the honour of the discovery of the plant 
in the additional county, though the interesting fact of its occur- 
rence here would not have been made known to botanists generally 
had it not been for the zeal and energy of the Bev. B, P.
Murray, 
who recently wrote me of his having been shown a coloured sketch of 
the plant by Miss J.
M. Woods (a cousin of the discoverer), the 
original of which was gathered on September 18th, 1878, on a moor 
between Lostwithiel and St. Veep : Miss J.
M. Woods had herself 
twice seen the Lobelia there, and thought there was a fair quantity.
Curiously enough, a little while after receiving this information 
from Mr. Murray, I came across the following statement in an 
article by that able botanist the late Mr. F.
M. Webb, entitled 
" Notes upon some Plants in the British Herbarium at the Boyal 
Botanic Garden, Edinburgh, " published in Trans.
B. B.
S. Edin., 
vol.
xiii.
:— "Lobelia urem.— Very fine specimens from Dalwood, 
near Axminster, 1849 (C.
Murchison) and good ones from Hore 
and Ward, ten years earlier.
Two others are marked Cornwall— a 
county error " (p.
102, 1879).
Doubting Mr. Webb's conclusion, 
his particulars only increased my anxiety to visit the locality indi- 
cated by Miss J.
M. Woods to Mr. Murray as the home of the 
Lobelia; and on October 10th I carried my desire into effect 
by walking from Lostwithiel to St. Veep, and exploring some of 
360 LOBELIA TJBENS L.
IN CORNWALL.
the intervening country.
To my great delight I found the Lohelia 
in two places, about a couple of miles apart, but both situated 
between Lostwithiel and St. Veep.
One of these stations is an 
enclosed, though unbroken, rough pasture of about five acres, with 
a stiff clayey soil, producing short grass and sedge, with Scabiosa 
Succisa, and patches of furze and some heath.
Here were dozens 
of specimens still in flower, and some of the spikes, protected by 
the furze, were considerably over a foot high, though the greater 
number were shorter, the least attaining only a few inches.
The 
field probably contains altogether hundreds of roots, for, although 
cattle had cropped off some of the flower-spikes, they were to be 
seen rising up from a very considerable extent of surface.
I notice 
that the flowers become of a much brighter blue when dried ; when 
living they have a somewhat purplish hue.
The other station is a small enclosure of about an acre, 
consisting partly of undrained bog, with Mmyanthes, Juncus acuti- 
jlorus, Molinia, &c.
Here it occurs for ten or fifteen yards by 
a small bushy ridge near the bog, and also on the damp lower 
portion of a hedge-bank ; but altogether appears only sparingly.
It is associated with AquUcyia, Hypericum undulatum, Viola lactea, 
Hydrocotyle, Serratula, Bartsia viscosa, S«(ix repens, a few bushes of 
Myrica, with brambles, furze, &c.
The tract belongs to Watson's vice-county 2 (E.
Cornwall), 
being within the basin of the Fowey, both the stations lying on the 
left of the river.
The rocks are slates of the Devonian or Old Eed 
Sandstone age.
Speaking broadly, the portion of Cornwall now 
found -to produce Lobelia urens may be said to lie between the 
respective tracts of Physospermum coruubiense and Erica ciliaris.
We may ex2>ect to find it occurring elsewhere in the portion of the 
county between the *towns of Truro and Liskeard, a part hitherto 
but little explored by botanists.
These Cornish stations must be, 
as the crow flies, about sixty miles from its Devon one near 
Axminster.
It will be well to append a few particulars respecting 
this, as two or three Devon stations have erroneously been named 
for the plant.
A very precise and interesting account of it, as an 
Axminster species, is to be found in a little book entitled ' The 
Ferns of the Axe and its Tributaries, with an Account of the 
flower Lobelia nrens,' by the Rev. Z.
I. Edwards, published in 18(>2.
Presuming the work is known to but few botanists, I extract the 
following particulars concerning the Lobelia at Axminster from its 
pages : — M As Hudson first described it in 1778 and quotes as his 
authority Mr. Newberry, it is probable that Mr. Newberry dis- 
covered it between 1762 " (date of ed.
1 of   Flora Anglica ') " and 
1778.
At this time Mr. Newberry lived at Heathstock, in the 
parish of Stockland, and as he was a noted herbalist, and had the 
reputation of knowing every plant of the neighbourhood, was likely 
to notice the flower when journeying to Axminster." After speak- 
ing of the station as recorded respectively by Hudson, Polwhele, 
Lord Webb Seymour (in Curtis's ' Fl. Londinensis '), and Withering 
(eds.
2 and 3), Mr. Edwards adds: — u Smith (Fl. Brit.) gives 
Kilininston Hill (on the authoritv of Curtis's Fl. Londin.), two 
A SECOND NEW CHINESE PODOPHYLLUM.
361 
miles from Axminster, close to the road.
Smith adds, in his later 
books, 'Near Ottery St. Mary, Miss Burgess.' Dr. Beeke, in 
1 Botanist's Guide,' tells us that Kilmington Hill and Shute Common 
are the same place." .
. .
. " Mr. Ravenshaw has fallen into the 
mistake of separating Shute Common from Kilmington Hill, and 
has added two other localities, Seaton and "Woodbury Common.
With respect to Seaton, it is too near home to have escaped obser- 
vation, if it had been growing there.
As to Woodbury Common, it 
seems that Mr. Ravenshaw drew his information from the Supple- 
ment to the ' New Botanist's Guide,' in which the mistake was first 
made.
In that work Mr. Abraham, of Heavitree, near Exeter, is 
quoted as the authority for that station, who, upon inquiry, has 
kindly communicated that this is * an erroneous statement.' It 
may be remarked, with reference to the flower being found growing 
at Ottery St. Mary, that this was not correct.
Miss Burgess, of 
Ottery, was on a visit at Cory ton House, Axminster, when she 
observed it and made others acquainted with the circumstance.
Hence originated this mistake." " In Kilmington Com- 
mon it has at present (1802) a range of about a mile in length, 
and in no place more than a hundred yards in breadth.
In some 
fields that have been recently cultivated, within the range of its 
usual haunt, the flower has appeared in great abundance on the 
newly turned-up ground." Mr. Edwards adds : — " A more precise 
description of its exact locality will not be given, as some naturalists 
are of a very grasping character, and instead of a few specimens, 
a case has occurred where a basketful has been borne away by a 
single individual." The Rev. Z.
I. Edwards, as Rector of Comb- 
pyne, only 4^ miles from Axminster, was located in a spot well 
situated for observations on the Lobelia urens at its single Devon 
station.
A SECOND NEW CHINESE PODOPHYLLUM.
By Henry F.
Hance, Ph.D., F.L.S., &c.
It is not a little singular that, so shortly after the detection of 
the Formosan Podophyllum, another species of the genus should be 
met with in the south-east of the empire, agreeing with its insular 
ally in the colour, number, and atrocious odour of its flowers, but 
differing by their extra-axillary position, just as the Himalayan 
l\ Emodi Wall, disagrees with P.
peltatum Linn.
This plant has 
been found of late in various localities of the Canton province, and 
I have several specimens of it alive, but it had not been met with 
in flower until my friend the Rev. B.
C. Henry gathered it in May 
last in the Lo-fau-shan Mountains.
His specimens arrived in a 
very unsatisfactory condition, owing to the torrential rains to which 
he was exposed, but I have been able to draw up, from the exami- 
nation of a few dried flowers, a trustworthy diagnosis, closely 
modelled on that of the Formosan plant, which I give below.
The difference in the arrangements of the flowers in the four 
362 A SECOND NEW CHINESE PODOPHYLLUM.
species is very striking, and would be worth study.
Prof.
Baillon 
speaks of them as borne " au sommet d'une espece de hampe," 
which is, I fear, unsatisfactory and misleading.
He is an 
enthusiastic pupil of Payer's, the best portion of whose excellent 
1 Elements de botanique ' is, I think, that devoted to inflorescence.
I hope, if Dr. Baillon should chance to see these remarks, that he 
may be induced to study morphologically the inflorescence of the 
genus.
I feel assured he would be repaid for the trouble.
No one 
will refuse the name of petiole to the stalks of both leaves in 
P. peltatum or P.
pleianthum, but the prolongation above the lower 
leaf in P.
Emodi and P.
versipelle must, I think, be regarded as a 
continuation of the stem, — or, morphologically speaking, rather 
branch, since the rhizome is the true stem — and the petiole of the 
upper leaf as arising only just above the insertion of the flower or 
flowers.
In the new plant the leaves vary marvellously in outline 
from a square, parallellogram, triangle or pentagon, to a circle, and 
are either with or without lobes.
The flowers are only half as 
large as in P.
pleianthum, and the anthers are twice as long as the 
filaments.

EXAMINATION OF MR.
A. STEPHEN WILSON'S " SCLE- 
ROTIA " OF PHYTOPUTHOIIA 1XFESTANS.
By George Murray, F.L.S., & Walter Flight, D.Sc, F.R.S.
In the   Gardeners' Chronicle ' for 1882, p.
460, Mr. A.
Stephen 
Wilson published an account of certain bodies found in potato 
leaves, &c, which he offered evidence to prove were of the nature 
of sclerotia, and further, that they formed a phase in the life- 
history of the potato fungus.
It is unnecessary to deal in detail 
with the nature of Mr. Wilson's evidence : to put the case shortly, 
he contended that these so-called sclerotia were masses of proto- 
plasm in a more or less hardened and dormant condition, which 
under favourable circumstances resumed activity after the fashion 
of plasmodia.
It need not be said that this was a startling departure 
from the accepted notions of the life-history of an organism of the 
EXAMINATION OF MR.
A. STEPHEN WILSON'S " SCLEROTIA." 371 
affinities of Phytophthora infestans.
Though we have zoospores in 
fungi of this kind, there is no nearer approach to the exhibition of 
the characteristics of an amoeboid cell such as are shown by Plas- 
modia.
In spite of this Mr. Plowright accepted (op.
ciu, p.
630) 
their connection with the potato disease, and Mr. Worthington 
Smith suggested (Gard.
Chron.
i. 413, 1883) that " the Protomyces 
of Martius and Berkeley, the Tuburcinia of Berkeley, and the 
Sclerotia of Wilson, may possibly be all identical and undoubtedly 
of fungus origin.
" Mr. Murray contended (' Journal of Horti- 
culture,' March 15th, 1883) that the description of these bodies as 
sclerotia was mistaken, since they did not conform to the definition 
of such structures as compact mycelium.
Mr. Wilson replied to his 
criticism, but his reply threw no new light on the matter, and 
merely stated that he differed from the commonly accepted defi- 
nition of a sclerotium — a matter not to be wondered at, considering 
the number of new and utterly useless descriptive terms he thinks 
it right to employ in his account of these bodies.
Finally, to 
satisfy or confirm Mr. Murray's doubts, which were expressed at 
meetings of the Scientific Committee of the Eoyal Horticultural 
Society (Gard.
Chron.
1883, i.
479), Mr. Wilson, with much kind- 
ness, sent to that Board a series of specimens for his inspection, 
and the result has been communicated shortly to the committee.
There was no sign whatever of the breaking down of cells and 
cell-contents in the neighbourhood of the so-called sclerotia such 
as commonly accompanies the presence of a fungus, and the micro- 
scopical examination forced upon one the conclusion that they 
were merely a form or product of cell-contents.
However, the 
potatoes sent by Mr. Wilson were grown and watched, and 
numerous cultivation experiments were instituted with the bodies 
in question, the result being in all cases negative as regards any 
manifestation of life whatever in them.
The u plasmodiation," 
" myceliation," &c, described by Mr. Wilson, wholly failed to 
appear.
Eetuming then to the original opinion that they were 
merely a form of cell-contents, inquiry was made as to their 
nature.
Finding them insoluble in acetic acid (though Mr. Wilson 
stated, in a letter to Mr. Murray, that they are soluble under such 
circumstances), but soluble in dilute nitric acid, the guess was 
ventured (first privately by Mr. Geddes) that they might be oxalate 
of lime.
It was then determined to test them for this substance, and, 
after a minute search through four portions of leaves for any other 
appearance of this substance, and none being found, the portions 
were submitted to Dr. Flight that he might carry out the test.
These four portions were placed in dilute nitric acid, and, after 
the lapse of half an hour, the so-called sclerotia had entirely 
vanished.
The fragments of leaves were removed from the liquid, 
which was then evaporated, but not to dryness, to remove the 
excess of acid.
It was then rendered alkaline with ammonia and 
allowed to stand over night.
In the morning crystals, having the 
form of a square-based octahedron, were seen plentifully in the liquid 
under the microscope, the greater part having separated in an 
amorphous state.
We have therefore no hesitation in saying that 
372 CINCHONA LEDGERIANA.
these so-called sclerotia of Phytophthora infest ans are merely masses 
of oxalate of lime.
It might be contended by Mr. Wilson that, since oxalate of 
lime is to be found in certain plasmodia, a mistake has been made, 
but the application of dilute nitric acid for half an hour to the 
leaves would not have been sufficient to remove all trace whatever 
of a protoplasmic structure such as a plasmodium.
CINCRONA LEDGERIANA.
By Henry Trimen, M.B., F.L.S.
I fail to see that Dr. Kuntze has in any way strengthened his 
position by his attempt (p.
293) to discover discrepancies in ruy two 
articles on 0.
Lerfgeriana.
In the latter one I was only concerned 
to show that this species, if protected from chances of cross- 
fertilization, produced its own seed abundantly, and that such 
seed came as true as that of other species under similar circum- 
stances.
All the species of Cinchona vary a good deal in leaf-form, 
and I do not agree with Dr. Kuntze in considering that it is 
"necessary for a species" to produce perfectly true seed.
It is of course a matter of but little importance whether the 
easily recognizable characters which distinguish C\ Ledgeriana be 
held of sufficient weight to distinguish it as a species, or merely a 
variety: nobody expects unanimity among botanists on such a 
point.
But that it is hybrid there is not one jot of evidence to show.
Dr. Kuntze says it is " proved" by the botanical characters, but a 
good deal more than such resemblances will be required to satisfy 
inquirers of the truth of his assumptions.
There is some evidence with quite the opposite tendency.
In 
1881 Mr. Moens commenced, in the Java plantations, a series of 
artificial crossings of Cinchona; amongst others he succeeded in 
crossing C.
Calisaya with C.
micrantha.
The resulting seed germi- 
nated, and the young plants were put out in the open in March, 
1882.
Here, then, according to Dr. Kuntze, was a direct syn- 
thesis of C.
Ledgeriana ; but this is what Mr. Moens wrote to me as 
to the result.
After alluding to other artificial hybrids he had 
growing, he proceeds : — "The recipe of Kuntze for making Ledyeri- 
aua y cross-fertilization of Calisaya with micrantha , has given no 
Ledgeriana, but an intermediate form.
Curiously enough, almost 
;ill these hybrids (mother < alts ay a, father micrantha) have the 
young leaves purple like micrantha, but paler.
Sum' rubra and 
Calisaya give an intermediate form, exactly like a great many we 
have in our plantations." 
This is surely pretty direct disproof of Dr. Kuntze's theory, 
and from a source above suspicion, A good many more of his 
baseless assertions as to the origin of other Cinchonas are equally 
well disposed of in Mr. Moens* 'Kina cultuur in Azie,' the most 
valuable contribution to Quinology yet published, and one which it 
is to be hoped will be put into an English dress.

SHORT NOTES.
Bournemouth Alg^e.
— Bournemouth is a very good place for 
collecting specimens of the rarer Algae, for, although there are no 
rocks in or near the place, there is a long stretch of sand on 
which one frequently can find many of the rarer sorts.
I collected 
on the beach there, in August last, in addition to the commoner 
species, the following, viz., Taenia atomaria (plentiful), Poh/siphnnia 
byssoides (in great abundance), Bormemai$onia asparagoides , Haliseru 
polypodiouUs, Arthrocladia villosa y Sporochnus pedunculated (plenti- 
ful), Corynospora pedicellate, De&marestia ligulata, &rifliih*ia coral} vim 
and setacea, Stilophora rhizodes, three specimens of Naccaria Uiggii % 
and one of Dudresnaia cocci not.
Of this last species I found several 
specimens on the beach at Studland, which last is one of the 
best places I was ever at for Algae.
The specimens of Naccavia 
were all small, and looked very much like (at first sight) pieces of 
Ceramium rubrum.
Dudresnaia coccinea is most easily recognised by 
its peculiarly slimy or glutinous feeling, for it does not show much

At Exmouth Bnjopsis plwnosa was not infrequent, 
growing in the sandy mud at low water nearly opposite the 
Imperial Hotel.
At Slapton Sands I found numerous specimens of 
Sphacdaria Jilicina.

Fertilization of Methonica gloriosa.
— Having lately had this 
plant in bloom in my stove-house, I have had an opportunity of 
observing the process by which the fertilization takes place — a 
process which accounts for the singular shape of the blossom.
With regard to the shape, I would first remark, for the benefit of 
those unacquainted with it, that it has three peculiarities — first, 
that of the three locules of the ovary one is much more developed 
than the other two ; next that, even before as well a$ after the 
opening of the flower, the pistil is bent at a right angl6 to the 
centre line of the ovary, and then when the flower is quite open 
the petals are recurved till their extremities meet.
Now, when the 
blossom first opens, the extremity of the pistil occupies an inter- 
mediate position between the stamens that project downward and 
the petals that are elevated above it, but as time proceeds the 
further rising of the petals drags the stamen with them, and 
causes them to come in contact with the pistil, thus rendering the 
chance of fertilization very great.
This chance is greatly increased 
by a rotary movement of the pistil, caused, I think, by the unequal 
distention of one of the locules of the ovary before mentioned.

Leicestershire Plants.
— I found Eriophorum va<jinatum L.
last 
May growing in small quantity in a strip of turfy ground on 
Charnwood Heath.
The rocky and barren tract called by this 
name is a remnant of the original forest, of which it forms one of 
the highest points.
E. vaginatum is inserted (with a query) for 
Leicestershire in 'Topographical Botany' on the strength of a 
record (also queried) from Groby Pool in Coleman's MS.
list.
This 
station, in itself somewhat improbable, does not produce it now, 
but does produce E.
angitstifoUnm , a form of which may have 
caused the error, if error it be.
At the same time I may mention 
that on rocks near the same spot I have recently detected Stereo- 
caul on coralloides Fi\, not recorded by Mr. Bloxam in his carefully 
worked out list of local lichens inserted in Potter's ' Charnwood 
Forest.' The genus is, in fact, quite unrepresented there, though 
it can hardly be confounded with any other.
In Leighton°s 
' Lichen Flora ' Mr. Bloxam's Leicestershire localities are quoted 
very freely, but under Stereocaulon no record is given from that 
county.

Failure of Ranunculus bulbosus to hold its < \ round at Kew 
(p.

—It is likely that this " apparent weakness " is caused by 
the garden-beds at Kew being so unlike the natural habitat of the 
plant.
It belongs to the group of Pascuals — plants of " pastures 
and grassy commons where the herbage is less luxuriant than in 
the meadow lands/' These plants soon disappear from cultivated 
land, as they require a firm but finely divided soil for their roots, 
and, as a rule, are easily smothered by rank vegetation.

Ceratophyllum submersum in Cambridgeshire and Hunts.
This grows plentifully in the Wash between the Bedford Bivers 
from Earith to Oxlode, and in ditches connected with the Ouse at 
St. Ives, Hunts.
It flowers freely, but I have not been able to get 
fully matured fruit, although I have met with some sufficiently 
advanced to show the covering of "cylindrical tubercles" mentioned 
as characteristic by Syme in 'English Botany/ Sometimes a form 
occurs with a strong tubercle on each side of the base of the fruit, 
like "the rudiments of the spines of C.
demerswn"; but of this I 
have only been able to get very immature examples, owing to the 
fruit being so frequently eaten off by aquatic larvaa.
The fruits are 
produced as freely in deep as in shallow water ; when the plant grows 
luxuriantly in the former, the upper shoots are crowded together so as 
to be brought within the influence of warmth and sunlight.
C. de- 
mersum seems to be absent from these localities.
— Alfred Fryer.
RUMEX 
In the ' Flora of 
Middlesex,' p.
238, this plant is placed in brackets, as no longer 
occurring in that county, its claims to inclusion resting on a MS.
record of Doody's, who found it, about 1700, near Burlington House, 
and near Montague House, the site of the British Museum.
Later 
than this it was found by Samuel Dale, in 1732, " In fossa prope 
Annis Stae Clarse vulgo Annisyclear dicta'' (of which Bath Street, 
Shoreditch, marks the site), a specimen from him so labelled being 
now in the British Herbarium of the British Museum ; and from 
the herbarium of B.
Nicholls (about 1745) there is a specimen 
"gathered in Conduit Street by Hanover Square." Some doubt 
attaches to the statement that it was found at Hampstead by Dr.
Syme (see Top. Bot.
ed.
1, 665), but Mr. Newbould informs me 
that he observed it in that locality some few years since.
Mr.
John Benbow, of Uxbridge, has lately presented specimens of this 
and of R.
palustris, collected by him near West Drayton, to the 
British Museum Herbarium, and writes as follows as to their place 
of growth: — "Yesterday [Oct. 31] I revisited the habitat of llamex 
palustris and R.
maritimw : it is undoubtedly in Middlesex, just 
without the boundary of Bucks.
In 1864, when I last searched the 
spot, I found a solitary specimen of R.
palustris only.
Yesterday I 
counted more than twenty plants of R.
waritimus, whilst It. palustris 
was growing in far greater abundance all round the fringe of the 
swamp.
Since 1864 this swamp has been converted into an osier- 
bed, but the water which filtrates through the "refuse" from some 
chemical works (with which the hollow is being gradually filled up) 
has killed the osiers, and nothing but the decaying stumps remains.
Previously the basin itself had evidently been thickly carpeted with 
these docks, for one or two mounds which rise slightly above the 
levels are also covered with young plants.
Should the ensuing

season prove a wet one, and the water rise to a higher level than 
heretofore, the habitat will be entirely lost — indeed the encroach- 
ment of the refuse makes it only a question of time." The county 
of Oxford may be added to the list in Top. Bot., ed.
2, p.

being a specimen in the British Museum collected by Mr. H.

Arum italicum Mill, in Kent.
— Early in the month of June, 
1879, I noticed growing in shady places beneath the Undercliff, 
Folkestone, an Arum which I strongly suspected to be Arum 
italicum (Mill.), which suspicion was confirmed upon my visiting 
Jersey shortly afterwards, where the plant grows abundantly.
Upon returning to Folkestone later on in the month I made 
especial search, and noted the plant in three distinct localities in 
the immediate neighbourhood — (1) that of the Undercliff, just 
mentioned; (2) on the roadside leading between Sandgate and 
Shorncliffe station; (8) in Paddlesworth Lane, about three miles 
from Folkestone; here A.
maculatum grows abundantly, and the 
two species are found intermingled.
I am pretty certain that 
careful inspection would result in the discovery of A.
italicum along 
the whole of this part of the Kentish coast ; and I would especially 
signalize the neighbourhood of Hythe, Westenhanger, and Beech- 
borough Park as worthy the attention of botanists visiting the 
neighbourhood in April, May, or June.
It may also occur on the 
Warren.
I am informed by Mr. Britten that Dr. Maxwell T.
Masters has gathered it this year "in a small copse by the roadside 
about 1| or 2 miles out of Folkestone, on the Canterbury Road.
One plant on Feb. 6th with leaves fully expanded, amid scores or 
hundreds of the common species still rolled up.
Soil chalk." This 
may be the wood well known locally as Lady Wood.
Again on 
May 3rd, 1883, Dr. Masters again writes that he had seen " plenty 
of Arum italicum a second time, near Folkestone, always in com- 
pany with the ordinary maculatum, but not yet observed it in 
flower." So far as my own experience goes, it is not a free- 
flowerer in this neighbourhood.
It is to be expected that further 
research will show A.
italicum to be pretty generally dispersed along 
our southern coasts.

LlMOSELLA AQUATICA IN CAMBRIDGESHIRE AND HUNTS.
This plant, 
not recorded from Carnbs.
since 1827, when it was found by Prof.
Henslow at Garnlingay, grows in some abundance on the muddy 
shore of the Ouse at Earith Causeway, in Hunts, and on both sides 
of the New Bedford River from Earith to Oxlode, in Cambs.
Its 
creeping growth, closely adpressed to the ground and rooting at 
the end of every branch, enables it to establish itself securely on 
the silty, shifting mud deposited on the very edge of the stream, 
and swept bare of other vegetation by the action of tides and floods.
Thus freed from the rivalry of robuster growths, its pretty pink 
blossoms are freely produced, and their ripened seeds are carried 
to similar stations down the river or to such as are only submerged 
at high water.
At Oxlode it grows wholly in the water, producing 
luxuriant floating shoots rarely uncovered at the low T est ebbs.
These facts will explain why the plant is so frequently recorded as 
" growing in cart-ruts'' — it evidently requiring stations mechani- 
cally cleared of other plants, and well-churned mud to grow in.

Crepis biennis at Eastbourne.
— I gathered this plant on the 
26th May last on a grassy spot in a new suburb of Eastbourne, 
where it occurred in tolerable plenty.
Cochlea ria Armoracia occurs 
in several places, but of course only as an introduction, on which 
ground, I suppose, Mr. Roper has not included it in his * Flora of 
Eastbourne.' — F.

OBITUARY.
The Rev. Robert Wood, Vicar of Westward, near Wigton, 
Cumberland, died at that place on the 15th of March last, at the 
advanced age of 86 years.
Although never attaining any great 
prominence in the scientific world, Mr. Wood was a genuine lover 
of Nature, and did much to encourage a similar enthusiasm in 
those with whom he came in contact, especially among the young.
Born at Tallentire, near Cockermouth, on December 18th, 1796, 
he entered St. Bees' College in 1818.
In 1822 he was appointed 
to the incumbency of Westward, and remained there until his 
death, the fiftieth anniversary of his incumbency being marked by 
his parishioners by a handsome testimonial.
Mr. Wood was 
especially interested in British flowering plants, of which he had 
an accurate knowledge, although the more recent M critical " school 
did not attract his sympathy ; his herbarium was nearly complete 
for the British flora.
Mr. Wood published very little; a note upon 
Alchemilla conjuncta, published in this Journal for 1872 (p.
308), was 
his sole contribution to our pages.
In a magazine called i Young 
England,' in which some prominence was at one time given to 
science, the botanical portion being under the management of the 
Editor of this Journal, Mr. Wood published two lists of Cumberland 
plants, — one in August, 1864, the other in April, 1865,— under the 
signature " Wood Robert," which he frequently employed.
As a 
clergyman Mr. Wood was very active, doing much to improve his 
parish in many ways.
He was a kind and genial correspondent, 
and will be missed and regretted by many who did not know him 
personally.
Mr. Wood's death was preceded by that of his eldest 
son, the Rev. Henry Hayton Wood, Rector of Holwell, Dorset.
The last-named was born at Westward, Sept.
28, 1825, and died at 
the same place on November 3rd, 1882.
He was one of the founders 
of the Dorset Field Club, and devoted a good deal of attention to 
Botany, especially to Mosses, of which he had an extensive col- 
lection, which has been acquired for the British Museum.
We regret to announce the death of the Rev. Henry Harpur 
Crewe, Rector of Drayton Beauchamp, near Tring, which occurred 
on September 7th, after a long and painful illness, at the age of 
OBITUARY OF BOTANISTS.
381 
fifty-three.
Mr. Crewe was best known as a horticulturist; he 
devoted his attention chiefly to herbaceous and bulbous plants, and 
those who had the pleasure of walking with him round his garden 
will not easily forget the great variety of beautiful species which he 
had in cultivation.
His collection of Crocuses was characterised in 
1875 by Sir J.
D. Hooker — who named in compliment to him 
Crocus Crewei (Bot. Mag.
t. 6168)— as " the richest in Europe"; 
the genus was a great favourite with him, and he made excursions 
to the Mediterranean Begion and the East with a view of collecting 
the species, besides commissioning travellers to obtain all they 
could.
He was well known as an entomologist, and had a good 
knowledge of British plants ; he did not, however, publish any strictly 
botanical papers, although his horticultural contributions were nu- 
merous and useful.
The specimens of Gentiana (jermanica from which 
our plate (t.
15) was taken were collected and forwarded to this 
Journal by Mr. Crewe in 1863.
Obituary of Botanists, 1882.
The following list of botanists who died during 1882, with a 
reference to the various publications in which some notice of their 
career will be found, will, it is hoped, be useful.
Except where 
otherwise stated, the publications referred to were published during 
1882, so that the repetition of that date is unnecessary.
