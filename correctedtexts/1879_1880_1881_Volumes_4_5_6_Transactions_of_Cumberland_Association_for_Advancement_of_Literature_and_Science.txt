EDITOR'S PREFACE.
Each year our Volume of "Transactions" has increased in 
bulk and varied interest, and it might be well for the Members 
of the several affiliated Societies to bear in mind, while writing 
their Papers for the evening meetings, that possibly such Papers 
may be recommended for publication by their own Committee, 
and approved by the Association Council.
Remembering this, 
authors will be anxious to write so that the MSS.
may pass 
on into the printer's hands without delay, always writing on one 
side of the paper only.
Each author may have Fifty copies of his own Paper done 
up in a separate cover, with the title printed outside, on pay- 
ment at the rate of One Penny per copy for every ten pages.
The List of Birds found in Cumberland, given at the end of 
the volume, is compiled partly from a list furnished by Mr. George 
Dawson, of Carlisle, and partly from the MS.
catalogue of the 
Keswick Museum.
Mr. Dawson's list should have been published 
a year ago, had it not been thought better to defer its publication 
a little until the catalogues might be rolled into one.

At the close of the Session 1878-79, the Committee have to 
express their satisfaction at the success which has attended the 
meetings, and to tender their thanks for the manner in which they 
have been supported by the members in carrying on the work, 
which it is the humble aim of the Association to accomplish.
Since the last Annual Meeting, considerable alteration has 
been made in the constitution of this Association.
At that 
meeting, a draft of proposed new Rules, as approved of by the 
Committee, was submitted to the members for consideration.
At 
a Special General Meeting, held on the 25th day of June, 1878, 
these Rules, after considerable discussion, were passed without any 
u 
material amendments.
The principal reason for altering the then 
existing Rules, was to obtain the advantage of the Act 6 and 7 
Vict, cap.
36.
The new Rules have been submitted to the 
Registrar, and approved of by him ; so that the property of the 
Association now receives the full benefit of the relief which the 
legislature intended to confer on science by the passing of this Act.
The insertion of Rules 5 and 7 is important.
These Rules introduce 
two classes of members into the Association; and while members 
retain all the original rights which membership conferred, the 
associate members have had some additional advantages granted 
to them in consideration of the increased subscription which they 
pay.
Although these Rules were in force since the date of the 
General Meeting at which they were passed, in reality they did not 
come into operation until the ist of January, 1879.
A circular, 
with blank form attached, was issued to all the members on the 
28th of December, 1878, requesting intending associate members 
to fill up the form and return it to the Secretaries.
The response 
to this circular was very satisfactory ; and the Committee have 
every reason to be highly gratified with the result.
The Associate 
Members at present are 82 in number.
The Conversazione, with which the Session commenced, was 
well attended, and showed most conclusively that the interest 
which the members and their friends have in the welfare of the 
Association has not diminished in the slightest degree.
The 
meeting was held in the Town Hall, and the programme was 
successfully carried through.
The President delivered an address, 
treating partly of the necessity of science being taught in our 
schools and educational colleges ; and partly of some of the 
recent discoveries in science.
The Vice-President gave a very 
successful illustration of the telephone and the microphone.
Mr.
J. M.
K. Main also gave a short description of his patent safety 
cage, a working model of which was exhibited in the room.
To the ladies who presided over the refreshment table, to the 
other members and friends of the Association who kindly sent 
articles for exhibition, and to those who assisted in carrying out 
the programme, the success of the Conversazione is in a great 
measure due.
i2 
The Committee would suggest to members, that they might 
make these opening meetings still more interesting and instructive, 
by lending articles for exhibition.
The Papers which have been read before the Association 
during the Session have been of a varied description.
There were thirteen Meetings, exclusive of the Conversazione, 
and the Annual Business Meeting.
Twelve Papers have been read, and two Lectures, by 
professional gentlemen, given at these meetings.
Six of the papers, 
and both lectures, were on subjects connected with science ; four 
were of a literary character ; and two more or less of an archaeo- 
logical nature.
The average attendance has been generally good, 
in fact, more numerous than in any previous year.
It must, 
therefore, have been pleasing to those gentlemen, who have devoted 
time and labour in the preparation of papers, to see that their 
work was appreciated.
Two of the Papers dealt with local subjects — "Notes on the 
Whitehaven Rural Sanitary District," by Mr. J.
Syme, Medical 
Officer of Health, and " Whitehaven CoUeries," by G.
H. Liddell.
The Lecture in connection with the Cumberland Association, 
was given by Mr. J.
E, Taylor, F.G.S. The attendance was not 
quite so numerous as on the first occasion when he lectured in 
Whitehaven.
The paper by the Rt. Hon.
G. C.
Bentinck, M.P., which he 
was prevented from reading during the Session of 1877-78, was 
read on the 4th of February.
In the course of replying to the vote 
of thanks accorded to him, Mr. Bentinck made some further re- 
marks of a most interesting character, in elucidation of his views 
on the Restoration of Ancient Buildings.
The Lecture by Prof.
Williamson, F.R.S., was an extra lecture.
The funds of the Association would scarcely have warranted 
the cost in connection with this lecture during the present year.
Thanks, however, to the assistance received from various members, 
a considerable proportion of the expense was guaranteed by private 
subscription : an example which might be followed with advantage 
13 
in future Sessions.
This lecture was given in the Association's 
Rooms, Howgill Street, and the attendance was very large.
The Session was brought to a successful conclusion by the 
paper on " EngUsh Music." The illustrations were given with • 
much effect by several ladies and gentlemen who assisted Mr. J.
McQueen.
The room was filled with a large and appreciative 
audience.
The success attending the effort made to place before 
the Association some very valuable knowledge relating to English 
Music, was most satisfactory.
Donations to the Museum have been received from Messrs.
Russell, Scoular, Dalton, and Dobson.
The Curators have to 
thank those gentlemen by whom articles have been presented; 
and they trust that presentations to the Museum by members of 
the Association, may become still more frequent.
A Botanical Section has lately been formed.
This section 
numbers 15 members.
Mr. J.
Adair is President, and Mr. J.
D. 
Kendall, Secretary of the section.
The work which the section 
has undertaken to perform during the summer, is to study the 
flowering plants of the neighbourhood, and to collect and form a 
herbarium of all the plants of the district.
The country around 
Whitehaven has been laid out in districts, and the work has com- 
menced in earnest.
The Library has been largely added to during the year ; and 
the Librarian reports that it is in a very satisfactory and flourishing 
condition.
The Members and Associate Members of the Association 
at present number 289.
Thirty-four new members have been 
elected during the year ; and there has been a nett increase of 21 
in the number of members since 1877-78.
The Committee have to thank many members for special 
assistance rendered during the Session, — assistance which they 
valued most highly.
To those gentlemen who communicated 
papers they are specially indebted — in short, they have to express 
their gratitude for the general support which has been ungrudingly 
given by every one.
They have also to acknowledge their obligation to the gentle- 
u 
men connected with the local press, for the reports of the 
proceedings which have from time to time been inserted in the 
various weekly publications.

The Committee, in presenting their report, congratulate the 
members upon the numerical and financial state of the Society in 
the Session now being brought to a close.
There are 152 members 
at 3s.
6d., as against 145 last year ; and there are also 10 members 
under age, who pay 2s.
6d.
each.
Several members have been lost 
through removals, etc.; but there is an increase of seven over last 
year.
Total members now on the books, 162.
The list has been 
carefully revised by crossing off the names of those who have left 
the neighbourhood, or withdrawn from the Society, so that the 
Committee can safely reckon upon the list as it now stands.
These 162 members include 22 new ones who have joined since 
the last armual meeting.
There have been nine Lectures during the Session, and twelve 
Ordinary Meetings.
The Lectures consisted of a course of three on Animal Physi- 
ology, particularly the human subject; two Antiquarian, two 
Literary, one on Flowers, and one on Pompeii.
The Papers at the Ordinary Meetings were — two Biographical, 
three Notices of Travel, two Historical, two Scientific, and three 
Archaeological and Antiquarian.
The attendance at the Lectures and Meetings has not been so 
good as the Committee would be glad to see, or the interest and 
importance of the subjects should command.
Although the price of 
16 
admission to lectures charged to non-members is so low as id., it is 
to be regretted that so very few of the inhabitants have attended ; 
still, there has been more money taken for admissions than there 
was last Session.
The cost for Lectures has been a few shillings 
in excess for this Session.
There were only two Excursions or Field Days last summer, 
the first to Thirlmere and Castle Rock, St. John's, attended by 
twenty-two persons; the second to Grasmere and Langdale, 
including the Elterwater Slate Quarries, which was attended by 
thirty-seven members and friends.
The Committee are glad to 
report that these Excursions bore their own costs, not a single 
penny being taken from the funds of the Society.
The other two 
Excursions intended to have been made, viz.
to Maryport and 
Threlkeld, did not come off, because at about the dates they were 
fixed for, the Bazaar and many other attractions were offered in 
Keswick.
As you will doubtless be aware, the Committee became the 
purchasers of Flintoft's Model of the Lake District, and subse- 
quently effected an arrangement with Messrs.
Mayson by which 
the Museum and Model were let to them on a satisfactory lease, 
thus securing a very fair annual income for Museum purposes.
The Model was bought for ;^i6o — the purchase money being 
realized from the Bazaar, as mentioned hereafter.
The Bazaar which was held for the joint benefit of the 
Museum and the School of Art reaUzed ^^460, which was equally 
divided between the two institutions, being ^230 for each.
This 
enabled the Committee to pay off the cost of the Model, and also 
some outstanding accounts, for fitting up the Museum.
Within the 
last month, the Model, which had got into rather bad condition, 
has been repaired, restored, and re-coloured by Mr. Barnes.
The 
Museum was opened free to the public for several days about 
Christmas and the beginning of the year, and is now permanently 
opened and under the care of Mr. Jenkinson.
With reference to the Lecture on "Robert Southey" by 
Dean Stanley, your Comniittee decided to give the whole nett 
proceeds towards liquidating the debt upon the Library, caused 
17 
by certain alterations made upon the premises for sanitary 
improvements.
Those necessary alterations cost something over 
^47, towards which the Library Committee had raised J[,i() los., 
leaving a debt of more than ^27 ; this had hung like a dead 
weight upon the Library for nearly three years, when it occurred 
to your Committee to devote the income from the Dean's Lecture 
to the purpose already stated.
They were the more readily 
induced to do this by the consideration that no injustice was done 
to the Literary Society, because that Lecture formed no part of the 
published Programme of the Session, but was entirely extra.
It 
will be satisfactory to members of this Society to know that the 
sum of ;^i6 IS.
6d.
has been realized from the Lecture, and 
handed over to the Library ; and it is confidently hoped that this, 
with the addition of the proceeds of the Concert of last Thursday

purpose, will set the Library on a sure footing.
It will be remembered that at the last Annual Meeting it was 
resolved to reduce the subscription from 5 s.
to 3s.

The attendance of members was by no means so good and 
regular as it should have been, and the Committee would be glad 
to see a more lively interest taken in the work of the Society.
On the 28th of June, 1878, the members of the Society visited 
Sale and Wythop Fells, under the leadership of J.
C. Ward, Esq., 
F.G.S.
The Society mourns the loss of its late President, I.
Fletcher, 
Esq., M.P., F.R.S., feeling that it loses in him a man most qualified 
for such a post, and one whose place it will not be easy to supply.

In presenting this, the fifth annual Report, the Committee 
are glad to be able to state that there has, during the year, been 
an increase in the membership — the capitation grant having been 
paid for 83 as against 70 for last year.
They, however, regret that 
20 
the ordinary attendance at lectures is not yet what it ought to be ; 
nor is there that active co-operation which the Committee would 
like to see actuate each individual member.
They are not, 
however, without hope, that in the future, as the claims of the 
Association become more widely known, and its advantages felt, 
that a greater interest will be developed.
The Committee would, 
however, be glad of any suggestions which would help them, so 
to speak, to popularise the Society, and enable them to draw into 
its membership the artisans and young tradesmen of the town, a 
class which, at present, do not seem inclined to take advantage of 
such an Institution.
The Session was opened on i6th October, by the President's 
Address and Conversazione, held in the Assembly Rooms, which 
was very well attended, and at which several articles of interest 
were exhibited.
The Committee feel indebted to those gentlemen 
who so kindly gave the benefit of their valuable assistance, as well 
as to those who lent articles for exhibition.
The financial position will be seen from the Treasurer's 
Balance Sheet, to be very satisfactory ; and in retiring from office, 
the Committee earnestly hope that the future career of the Society 
may be one of ever increasing prosperity.

In presenting their third annual Report, the Committee has 
great pleasure in again recording a substantial increase in the 
number of members.
Last year there were 8i ordinary members, 
including five ladies ; but this year there are 102 ordinary members, 
including nineteen ladies.
Five gentlemen were unanimously 
elected Honorary Members, viz : — 
Rev. J.
Clifton Ward, F.G.S.
J. E.
Taylor.
Esq., Ph.D., F.L.S., F.G.S.
J. C.
BuCKMASTER, Esq., B.A.
J. Hetherington, Esq., F.R.G.S.
A. KiTCHiN, Esq., F.G.S.
In the two previous Sessions the evening for the Meetings 
was Friday ; but this has been altered to Tuesday during the past 
Session, and the change was a very beneficial one.
The attendance at all the Meetings was greatly above the 
average ; and the plan of having two classes of Lectures — Public 
and Ordinary — works well.
To the former the admission was free 
to all, whilst to the latter, friends of members were admitted on 
payment of sixpence.
This plan has given such great satisfaction, 
that it is to be continued during the coming Session.
The Programme — a much longer one than last Session — was 
faithfully carried out ; and the great interest taken in the majority 
of the Papers was shown by the intelligent discussions which 
followed them — such discussions being much above the average.
The exhibition of the Phonograph by Mr. Graham of London 
was very successful.
The Transactions have again been given free to the members.

The past Session has been very successful.
The Public 
Lectures have been most instructive ; and the Committee desires 
to express its sincere thanks to the gentlemen who have so freely 
come forward to lecture.
The Ordinary Meetings have been fairly well attended, and an 
increasing interest has been manifested in all the operations of the 
Society.
The discussion of each public lecture at the Ordinary 
Meeting following its delivery, has been especially interesting, and 
has enabled the members to examine in detail many particulars of 
the subjects of the lectures that were necessarily but briefly touched 
24 
by the lecturers.
The intermixture of select readings with original 
papers and discussions, gave a varied interest to the meetings, 
which increased rather than diminished towards the end of the 
Session.
The Society joined the Carlisle Society in a Field Day at 
Penton, and spent a very pleasant Summer afternoon in that 
beautiful locality, which was rendered more interesting by the 
papers upon local subjects, that were read by J.
Clifton Ward, 
Esq.; R.
S. Ferguson, Esq.; and Mr. Geo.
Dawson.
The number of members 'this year has been 37 against 42 
last year.
The income from members' subscriptions and admission 
to lectures has covered all expenses, and leaves a small balance in 
the hands of the Treasurer.

The Committee of the above Society have pleasure in 
presenting their second annual Report, and have again to 
congratulate themselves upon the success which has attended 
their past Session.
During the past season the Committee have distributed 
gratuitously one hundred and sixty copies of the Transactions of 
the Cumberland Association, — and will continue the distribution, 
as the subscriptions are received from the members.
New members continue to be enrolled.
Several important 
additions have been made to the Museum, including some fine 
Roman carved slabs, and a fine geological collection, rich in 
Cumberland and Westmorland fossils, formed by the late Professor 
Harkness, F.R.S., and presented to the Museum by his sister, Mrs.
Pearson, of Penrith — to be always kept separate as the " Harkness 
Collection." This collection has not yet been arranged for 
exhibition, but will probably be thrown open to the public in the 
course of the summer.

The Committee, in presenting this its second annual Report, 
is glad to notice that, both numerically and financially, the con- 
dition of the Society is very satisfactory.
There are 203 members, 
18 of whom are under age.
Thirty-eight members have been 
elected during the last Session.
On June 20th, the Society, in connection with the Keswick 
Society, made a geological excursion into Great Langdale.
The 
Rev. J.
Clifton Ward conducted the company, numbering 102.
An 
underground slate quarry, and the Dungeon Ghyll, were visited.
The attendance at the Ordinary Meetings and Lectures has 
been very fair.
Both Dr. Taylor and Waynman Dixon, Esq., had 
a large audiance.
The Conversazione was a decided success.
During the evening Lt.-Col. Rhodes read a paper on "the Coffee 
Tree, and its mode of Culture;" and G.
Healey, Esq., presided 
at the microscopes.
The company was much interested in the large collection of 
objects kindly lent for exhibition.
28 
^nimal $^port of §,ss0ctalioit Stmtarg.
In presenting my Annual Report, as Secretary, and Balance 
Sheet, as Treasurer, for the past Association year, I cannot but 
feel that there is rather less progress to announce this year than 
last.
Instead of three new Societies affiliated, there is but one, 
the Silloth Society, now only springing into life, but promising 
well for next winter session, and contemplating a field-day very 
shortly.
The total increase of membership is not very great, being 
about one hundred, or rather more.
As in previous years, co-operation among all existing Societies 
has been fully maintained, and the lecture courses have benefited 
accordingly.
Dr. Taylor, as Public Lecturer, seems to have given great 
satisfaction to the affiliated Societies.
The total cost to each of 
the eight Societies was only £^2 i6s.
6d., a sum of ;^9 9s.
having 
been voted towards the general expense, out of the Association 
funds.
We are again indebted to Messrs.
Coward for the careful 
attention and great interest shown by them in the publication of 
the Transactions.
Part III., though containing twenty pages 
more than the last issued, has been supplied to the Societies and 
Association members at the low price of \s.
The Balance Sheet shows a balance of ^19 is.
2d.; but 
this would have been somewhat reduced if the Workington Annual 
Meeting had been carried out in its entirety.
The expenses con- 
29 
nected with Sir G.
Airy's lecture at Cockermouth last year were 
great, the chief item being the transport of a large globe from the 
south of England, and an accident which happened to it on its 
return.
The greater part of this expense, however, was most 
generously borne by our late and much-lamented President, the 
sum of ^5 15s.
being alone left for the Association to defray.
I cannot close my Report without one word of tribute to our 
late President.
There are few, if any, in Cumberland who so 
entered into the work and aim of the Association as he ; and his 
advice and encouragement were ever given me with much willing- 
ness and cheerfulness.
We have, in losing him from amongst us, 
lost both a friend and an able support.

NOTE.
The Annual Meeting which was to have been held at 
Workington on April 29th, did not take place, owing to the 
lamented death of the President, I.
Fletcher, Esq., M.P., F.R.S.
It was felt on all sides that, out of respect for the late President, 
no General Meeting should be convened other than for business 
purposes.
Such a business meeting was held, and a letter of 
condolence voted to Mrs. Fletcher in her deep trouble.
The next Annual Meeting will be held at Maryport, in 
the Spring of 1880, under the presidency of the Hon. P.
S. 
Wyndham, M.P.

THE FORMATION OF CUMBERLAND.
(Read at Cockermoiith and Carlisle.) 
By R.
S. FERGUSON, M.A., LL.M., F.S.A.
[This lecture is the abbreviation of several papers intended as the intro- 
ductory chapters of the writer's forthcoming Histoiy of Cumberland.
In those 
papers the writer has given the name (with references) of every author cited or 
consulted by him.
In compressing them into an hour's lecture (the publication 
of which the writer did not anticipate or desire), the writer, for clearness and 
brevity, omitted such names and references.
The lecture is now published, as 
delivered, at request of the Carlisle Scientific Society and Naturalists' Field 
Club.] 
I propose to-night to try and give you some idea of who 
dwelt in this county of Cumberland before it had that name; 
what those people have to do- with us, who dwell in it now; and 
how our county came to be separated from others and have a 
name of its own.
To begin at the beginning, I dare say some of you have heard, 
in this very room, Mr. Clifton Ward describe tersely and clearly, 
as he well can, the geological changes that this district has gone 
through ; you may have, as I, heard him describe how, as in a 
vision, his mind's eye saw those successive changes, and how 
this country was once united by dry land to the Continent of 
Europe, across which, as across a bridge, came various animals of 
forms strange to us- -the mammoth, the woolly elephant, the hairy 
rhinoceros, the cave hyena, the cave bear, and with them possibly 
Man.
Thus would begin in these Islands what is called "The Stone 
Age," or period when man was ignorant of the use of metal, and 
his only implements for war, for the chase, or for domestic use, 
were of Stone, bone, or shell.
The men of the Stone age have left no 
histories behind them : for what we know of them we are indebted 
34 
to the Spade, and not to the Pen. The Stone Age has been 
subdivided into two ages, the earlier or Palseolithic Age, when 
man did not know how to grind or polish a stone, but only how to 
rudely chip it to a sharp edge.
The remains of the Palaeolithic 
man are found in caves, and in river drift : none have been found in 
this district.
Mr. Clifton Ward has mentioned one, a stone celt, as 
found near Keswick ; and the Carlisle Museum has two ; but I 
fancy they are most probably unfinished implements of the later 
Stone Age. As to how long it is since the Palaeolithic Man lived, 
I decline to go into the question : dates varying from 60,000 years 
ago to 600,000 years ago have been assigned to him : it is main- 
tained by some that a period of glaciers has intervened since he 
roamed about this district.
We will to-night have nothing more 
to do with him.
He seems to have been clean wiped out, and 
some of the very features of the country completely changed since 
he lived.
But the Neolithic Man, the man of the later Stone Age, who 
could polish and grind a stone, saw this country much as we see 
it — the position of his graves tells us that.
He, too, has left no 
histories behind him ; but the Spade in the hands of Sir R.
Colt- 
Hoare, of Dr. Thurnam, and of Canon Greenwell, has been the 
key which has unlocked the secrets buried in his graves.
The 
researches of Canon Greenwell have been mainly in the Yorkshire 
Wolds, in Durham, Westmorland, Cumberland, and Northumber- 
land.
Time forbids me from doing more than giving you the 
results of these researches : for the evidence you must yourselves 
consult the proper works, the chief of which are Evan's Ancient 
Stone Implements, Tkurnani's Crania Britannica, and Greenwell 
and Rolleston's British Barrows.
The Neolithic Man in these districts was of short stature, 
with a long head (technically called dolicho-cephalic.
His facial 
angle, as measured from his skull, and other evidence, afforded by 
it, show him to have probably had a mild and pleasant countenance.
The remains of the animals on which he lived show that he led a 
pastoral, semi-agricultural existence, eking out his subsistence by 
the chase, rather of birds than bigger animals.
He had for domestic 
35 
animals only the Bos longifrotis, a species of ox : it is doubtful if he 
had the goat ; he had not the dog.
He ground his grain with stones, 
and the sand and grit got into the meal, and wore his teeth down 
to the gum.
He had toothache badly, as the condition of his 
jaws shows.
Dr. Thurnam thinks he was a cannibal : Canon 
Greenwell and Professor Rolleston repudiate the slander.
When 
he died, the man of the long head was buried in a long mound or 
barrow.
(Recollect that long heads and long barrows go together: 
round heads and round barrows.) That long barrow was also the 
place of sepulchre for his wife, or wives, and children.
With him 
were deposited certain earthen vessels, and implements of stone 
and bone, apparently made new for the occasion.
This may prove 
that he had some belief in a future state, in which he would require 
these things.
Several of these long barrows are to be found in Cumberland : 
there is a fine one at Gilsland ; another, called Sampson's Bratful, 
on Stockdale Moor.
Stone implements have been found at many 
places in Cumberland — e.g. Keswick, Carlisle, Castle Carrock, 
Great Salkeld, Hallguards, Birdoswald, Irthington, Kirkoswald, 
Lazonby Fell, Melraerby, Ousby Moor, Penrith Beacon, Plumpton, 
Red Dial, Wigton, Solway Moss, &c.
Thus we possess proof that Cumberland was once inhabited 
by a dolicho cephalic race, which knew not the use of metal.
How long these dolicho-cephalic men dwelt in this district is 
hard to tell.
Canon Greenwell won't hazard a conjecture as to 
when they began ; but they were intruded upon by another race, and 
possibly somewhere about the year looo before Christ.
The new 
comer was a round-headed, or brachy-cephalic man, who buried his 
dead in round barrows.
Compared with the long-headed man, the 
round-headed man was a very ugly customer.
His bones prove 
him to have been bigger (his average stature over 5 ft.
8in.), thicker, 
and more muscular : he had broad jaws, turned up nose, high 
cheek bones, wide mouth, and eyes deep sunk under beetling 
brows that overhung them like a pent house — the superciliary 
ridges on his skull tell us that.
He had arms and implements of 
bronze.
He had learnt to domesticate the goat and the dog, as 
36 
well as the Bos longifrons, the only animal which the long-headed 
man had succeeded in taming.
He soon asserted his supremacy 
over the long-heads — he did not annihilate them.
In the round 
barrows of the round-heads both long and round skulls appear ; 
and in the later round barrows the skulls begin to appear occasion- 
ally of an intermediate shape : this shows that the round-headed 
man with the bronze weapons probably enslaved the long-headed 
man with the stone weapons, and took the long-headed women for 
his wives.
The language of the round-headed man swallowed up 
the language of the long-headed.
This was the Bronze Age, when man had advanced to the 
knowledge of weapons and implements made of bronze : these did 
not wholly supersede stone weapons and implements, for the poor 
man would continue to use the cheaper articles.
Many relics of this round-headed man of the Bronze Age 
have been found in Cumberland ; and his round barrows exist in 
many places in Cumberland and Westmorland : Canon Greenwell 
has opened ones at Castle Carrock, in this county, and at Kirkby 
Stephen, Warcop, Asby, Crosby Garrett, Crosby Ravensworth, and 
Orton, in Westmorland.
Many still remain untouched, so far 
as known, in Cumberland, on Burnsmoor, on Ulpha Fell, 
Seatallan, Bewcastle, and many other places.
Both these races of men have left other traces behind them 
than their graves; but I have only mentioned their graves, 
because the graves yield us the most information.
The stone 
circles, common in these two counties, are now found to be the 
remnants of destroyed burial places, probably first raised in the 
Bronze period, but afterwards used by later comers.
Other remains 
they have left — traces of their dwelling places : these it is difficult 
to assign to their proper period, for race after race would succes- 
sively seize on the same spots for their dwellings.
No doubt the 
round-headed man with the bronze weapons, after enslaving the 
long-headed man, and appropriating his women, would not hesitate 
to steal his home.
By the kindness of Mr. Clifton Ward, I have here a very 
interesting map of the Lake District, on which he has marked in 
37 
red the various pre-historic remains he has found in the Lake 
District — both long and round barrows, huts, and stone circles.* 
Many others exist on the east fells of this County.
The Rev. Mr.
Howchin, of Haltwhistle, has found flint implements in great 
numbers on the fells near Brampton and Haltwhistle.
More than one wave of these round-heads came in from the 
Continent, landing in Yorkshire, and spreading thence across the 
Wolds.
It is probable that some of the later comers brought with 
them the knowledge of iron ; but the Iron Age had hardly begun 
in Britain when the Romans arrived upon the scene.
With the arrival of the Romans ends the Pre-historic Era, as 
far as we are concerned ; and the Historic Era is one as to which, 
at first, we are but imperfectly informed.
We should bear in mind 
that the southern part of England was in a more advanced and 
civilized state than our Hyberborean regions : the south had some 
sort of commerce, and a coinage, which was an imitation of the 
gold Stater of Philip of Macedonia.
But no pre-Roman coinage 
has ever been found in the north of England.
With the advent of the Romans, commences, as I have said, 
the Historic period ; but the histories give us very little 
information as to the people the Romans found in possession.
A few lines in Tacitus, a few lines in Caesar, and still fewer 
in Strabo, are all we have to help us, and these passages 
have been tortured and turned about in every possible way 
by the ethnologists.
Unfortunately neither Tacitus, nor Strabo, 
nor Caesar ever thought of describing the shapes of the skulls 
of the people the Romans found in Britain, and they have 
thus left ethnologists a very nice nut to crack.
I must give you 
rather the results that have been arrived at, than the manner in 
which those results have been arrived at.
When the Romans arrived in Britain some 1800 years ago, 
they found that it was inhabited by people of two types of 
complexion, — the one fair and the other dark.

Taritus says — The Caledonians were red-haired and large 
limbed, like the Germans.
The Silures were curly-haired and 
dark complexioned, like the people of Spain.
The Britons were 
like the Gauls.
The Gauls and the Germans were much alike, always 
described as tall, with massive limbs, fair skins, fierce blue eyes, 
and hair the colour of which ranges from yellow to red.
Thus, although we have three names assigned to the people 
of Britain — Britons, Caledonians, and Silures — there were only two 
stocks, a dark stock and a light stock, and the dark stock was 
predominant in the west of Britain, and the fair in the north and 
east.
You will notice the distribution : it seems as if the dark stock 
had been driven westward by the invasion of the fair stock from 
the Continent.
Both these stocks, dark and fair, spoke one language, but 
there were two dialects of it — Cymric spoken in Britain, Gaelic in 
Ireland.
By this time I think you will probably have jumped to the 
conclusion from what I have told you before — that the dark stock 
are identical with the long-headed small men of the Stone Age ; 
the fair stock with the round-headed bigger men of the Bronze Age.
That I believe is so, and that the larger, stronger, fair stock, with 
the bronze weapons, had absorbed or driven into corners, their 
long-headed, dark predecessors, and that the language of the fair 
men had supplanted the language of the dark men.
These two dark and fair stocks, whom the Romans found in 
Britain, together make the Celts (though the name Celt is often 
confined to the conquering fair stock), and the one language which 
they spoke is the Celtic, with its two great dialectical divisions, 
the Cymric (or Welsh), and the Gaelic (or Irish).
These linguistic 
divisions have nothing to do with the divisions into fair and dark.
The abolished language of the dark stock had been Euskarian.
Professor Huxley has a theory that the whole of Western 
Europe was once inhabited by a dark stock — Melanochroi, or 
dark whites, he calls them — and that they were gradually superseded 
by a fair stock — Xanthochroi, or fair whites — who came from the 
39 
east.
These the Professor considers to be separate races of men, 
in the biological sense of the word race.
The remnants of the dark race — the Melanochroi — are to be 
found in the Basques of Spain, who still speak their original 
language, the Euskarian.
The Melanochroi, or dark stock, are 
the long-headed men with the stone weapons, who first inhabited 
this country.
The Xanthochroi, or fair stock, are the men with the 
round heads and bronze weapons, who superseded them.
They 
together form the Celts, whom the Romans found here.
To return to the Celts.
Of these Celts there were several 
tribes, one of which — the Brigantes — inhabited, probably sparsely, 
the mountainous and woody districts now known as Yorkshire, 
Lancashire, Westmorland, Cumberland, and Northumberland.
From Caesar we learn that the Britons, of whom the Brigantes 
were a tribe, were little given to cultivating the soil, but lived on 
milk and flesh, and clothed themselves in skins.
They stained 
themselves with a blue dye made from woad, to give themselves a 
more terrible appearance in battle; they wore their hair long, and 
shaved all but the upper lip.
They are described as being tall 
and stout, but clumsy.
They were polygamists ;* were ignorant 
of the use of money ; and wandered to and fro, driving their herds 
and ' flocks from pasture to pasture, but throwing up temporary 
dwelling places for security for themselves and their cattle.
To look in modern Cumberland for the cities of the Brigantes 
is waste of time : they probably had no cities, but a few collections 
of miserable wigwams, and no roads but mere forest tracks.
In 
fact, they were the fiercest and least civilized of the Celts, 
They are said to have been divided into tribes — the Voluntii, 
the Sestunlii, the Jugantes, and the Cangi — the latter on the Irish 
sea; the Sestuntii in Cumberland and Westmorland; the Voluntii 
in Lancashire ; — but this is a very obscure point.
I have endeavoured to tell you who the Romans found in 
possession of Briton, particularly in possession of what is now 
Cumberland and Westmorland.
I shall not go into the history of the Roman Conquest of

Briton, except so far as pertains to the history of this district.
The main facts of the Roman Conquest are probably known to 
you all : Julius Caesar paid this island a visit or two, and the 
British chieftains in Kent began in some fashion to imitate 
Roman civilization.
Aulus Plautius in A.D. 43 took up a 
permanent footing in Britain; and Ostorius Scapula (A.D. 50), 
conquered the S.E. of Britain up to a line from the Avon to the 
Severn, i.e. from Norfolk to the Land's End. Then came Petilius 
Cerealis ; and then the real conqueror of Britain, Julius Agricola, 
who landed in Britain to take the chief command in A.D. 78, and 
held it until 84, during which time he reduced all Britain, up to the 
Friths of Forth and Clyde, to the condition of a Roman Province.
I have in a paper which is printed in the Transactions of a 
local Antiquarian Society, gone fully into the circumstances of 
Agricola's Conquest of this part -of Britain.* It is foreign to my 
object to go fully into that question to-night.
I shall give you my 
results.
The real Conqueror of Briton was Agricola, who came from 
Rome to take the chief command in Britain in A.D. 78, and held 
it until A.D. 84, during which time he reduced all Britain up to 
the Friths of Forth and Clyde to the condition of a Roman 
province.
His first proceeding was to put to the sword the Ordo- 
vices, or inhabitants of North Wales, who had been troublesome : 
he then reduced to entire submission the Isle of Anglesey.
The 
winter of 78-9 he spent in quarters among the Ordovices in North 
Wales.
When the warm weather of 79 came, he drew together his 
forces again, and started off on a second campaign, and this time 
to the Northwards.
Where he went the 20th chapter of his life 
by Tacitus tells us in the words ' ' ^stuaria ac silvas ipse preientare,'t 
words that can only apply to the estuaries of Lancashire and of 
Cumberland, to the estuaries of the Dee, of the Mersey, of the 
Ribble, to the sands of Cartmel and of Ulverstone, and of the 
Solway Frith.
We know that the country bordering on these

estuaries was well and thickly wooded even so late as the time of 
Charles II.

shows that Agricola 
crossed the rivers just mentioned as near the sea as possible, and 
I think that he proceeded north by the coast of Cumberland, and 
by a road and chain of forts which will be discussed in detail 
presently.
This I fancy that he did that he might be supported 
by his fleet, and might also avoid the trackless woods and 
wild mountains of the interior : indeed, the passes into Cumber- 
land and Westmorland from the south are few and hard to force, 
defended as they would be, by swarms of Britons, who would have 
every advantage of shelter and knowledge of the country.
At the 
end of this year's campaign, he encircled the territory by a chain 
of forts.
Tacitus, in his account of the third campaign, defines for 
us the limits of the second year's conquest.
" Tertius expeditionum 
annus novas gentes aperuit" showing that in the second year 
Agricola did not get beyond the Brigantes, whose communities 
inhabited Yorkshire, Lancashire, Cumberland, Westmorland, and 
Durham, and who were well known to the Romans, having been 
in Yorkshire defeated and subdued by Petilius Cerealis.
Thus 
Agricola, in his second campaign, marched round the Cumberland 
coast, subduing the country up to the Solway and the Tyne, and 
establishing the chain of forts which stretched round the Cumbrian 
coast, and from the Solway to the Tyne, and whose ruins still 
excite curiosity and admiration.
In his third year, Agricola marched as far as the Frith of Tay, 
and in his fourth year (A.D. 8i) he drew a line of forts from the 
Frith of Forth to the Frith of Clyde ; while in the two following 
years he made further use of his fleet, and campaigned north of his 
upper line of forts, north of which line, however, the Romans never 
made any permanent conquests.
Thus much for what Tacitus tells us.
I will now endeavour to show you on the map the line of 
march which I believe Agricola to have taken, and to be the first, 
and oldest Roman road in Cumberland.
This Roman road starts from Lancaster, crosses the Lancaster 
branch of the Morecambe estuary to Pigeon Cote Lane, near 
4 
42 
Wyke, in Cartmell ; passes Flookburgh, where part of this Roman 
road still remains ; thence crosses the Ulverston estuary, and goes 
by Mount Barrow and Lindal to Dalton, near to the second of 
which places its pavement was discovered.
Thence the road 
crosses the Duddon Sands, and enters Cumberland somewhere 
near Millom.
AVe pick it up again between Whitbeck and Bootle : 
it is known as the High Street, says Hutchinson in his Cumber- 
land, "as lying on an old Roman road." Denton further says of 
Bootle, " next to Whitbeck in the Common High Street, and 
towards the West, is Butle." The very names "High Street" 
and " Common Street," generally denote an old Roman road.
In Selker's Bay, near Bootle, a legend says that some Roman 
galleys lie sunk, and not far off is an encampment, called Eskmeals, 
where Roman coins and altars have been found.
Muncaster, in 
its name, denotes a Roman camp.
Roman inscriptions have been 
found at Ravenglass.
At Moresby, and again at Ellenborough, and from Ellen- 
borough coastwise to Bowness, all antiquaries are agreed there has 
been a road.
Further traces of this great Roman road are to be 
found in the raised road in the Parish of Holme Cultram, known 
as Causeway Head, which points directly to Bowness, though the 
estuaries of Waver and Wampool intervene.
These estuaries 
appear to have been solid ground until the sea broke in, in the 
14th century.
From Bowness to Carlisle a Roman road ran along 
the Wall, and was there, no doubt, long before the Wall, dating 
from the march of Agricola.
Thus we get a Roman road running round the district now 
known as the County of Cumberland, from Duddon Sands on the 
S.W. to the boundaries of Northumberland on the N.E. Now this 
road, before entering Cumberland, was a road by no means suitable 
for the march of troops, and passage of baggage, being only open 
over the great estuaries at certain hours, and those variable ones, 
puzzling, no doubt, to the Romans, who were accustomed to a 
tideless sea.
When possession of the country was obtained, they 
sought a safer road, and found it by Kendal, Ambleside, and 
Keswick, to the large station, whose ruins exist near the Red Dial, 
43 
Wigton, and which is known as Old Carlisle : thus the coast road 
by the sands, by Whitbeck and Bootle would become of secondary 
importance.
My idea is that Agricola conquered the district by marching 
round its coast, and forming a great coast road, which was more 
or less, afterwards, abandoned for a short cut, which avoided the 
estuaries, and conducted to Old Carlisle, near the Red Dial.
I suppose that in the earlier Roman days in Britain, when a 
legion lay in garrison in Chester, Old Carlisle, near the Red Dial, 
and not Carlisle ( Luguvallum ), was the Roman head quarters in 
this district, which would be only transferred to Luguvallum or 
Carlisle, when York became the capital of Roman Britain, 
when the great road from York to Carlisle was made, and 
when the military subordination to Chester was done away with.
And in the names of Carlisle and Old Carlisle, there appears 
to be some traditional confirmation of this theory.
That Old 
Carlisle was an important place is shown by the vastness of its 
ruins: in the last century they covered many acres.
Stukeley 
writes of it—" The fairest show of buildings I ever saw." 
I have told you that Agricola started from Chester : you will 
see that by this great military road Old Carlisle was in direct 
communication with Chester, where, in the earlier days of the 
Roman rule in Britain, a Roman legion was quartered.
During 
the later portion of the Roman rule, no legion lay at Chester.
Britain was under the command of two great officers, the Comes 
httoris Saxonici per Brilaniiiam, who ruled in the south, and the 
Dux Brittvmiarum, who lay with a Roman legion at York, from 
whence he bore command over the great Wall, drawn from Tyne 
to Solway, and its many garrisons.
To bring him into military 
communication with the western portion of the Wall, a military 
road was made following the natural passage from the great plain 
of York, by the pass of Stainmoor, down the valley of the Eden 
into the Cumberland plain, and thence to Carlisle.
This great 
road ran from York over Stainmoor by Bowes, Brough, Brougham, 
Old Penrith, Carlisle, and Netherby.
On the completion of this 
44 
road, Carlisle would supersede Old Carlisle as the principal local 
place of military importance.
This great military road M'as crossed at Kirkby Thore, by 
another, which left the Roman Road between Manchester and 
Kendal, at a point in Lancashire, and ran north by Alston, and Bew- 
castle.
It is known as the Maiden Way, i.e. Mai-dun — the great 
ridge, having been raised two or three feet above the adjacent 
ground.
In addition to these four roads, viz.
the coast road, the road 
from Chester to Old Carlisle, the road from York to Carlisle, and 
the Maiden Way, a perfect mesh of roads covered the district, and 
for these roads I must refer you to my paper in the Transactions 
of the Cumberland and Westmorland Archseological and Anti- 
quarian Society.* 
To give to the Roman stations in Cumberland their ancient 
names, is a puzzle which has foiled the most eminent of antiquaries.
All we can say, with certainty, is that Old Penrith is Voreda, 
Carlisle is Luguvallum, Eilenborough is Axelodunum, Papcastle is 
Aballaba, and Moresby may be Congavata, or Gabrosentis.
Of the history of these stations we know very little : inscribed 
stones have preserved to us a few names, have proved that the 
garrisons had their wives and families with them ; that they had 
their amphitheatres, their baths, and some degree of luxury and 
culture.
The spade tells us that most of these stations have been 
burnt and rebuilt more than once ; that in the waning of the 
Roman power the garrisons were reduced, the camps contracted, 
and their gates built up to enable the thinned defenders still to 
make head against their foes.
But the Roman went at last, after ruling here for some three 
hundred and fifty years; just about three times as long as we have 
ruled in India.
Firm as was the Roman hold on Britain, it has left behind it 
little but the names of its towns, and of its camps ; the traces of its 
magnificent and well planned roads, and the debris of its luxuries 
and of its wants.

To the Romans, however, we owe the introduction of the 
sheep, and of the edible snail ; of the vine and the cherry-tree ; in 
fact, of nearly all our fruit trees, except the gooseberry, the currant, 
and the raspberry, which were introduced later.
To the Romans 
we, in the north, probably owe the establishment of the three great 
cattle fairs of Stagshaw-bank, of Brough Hill, and of Rosley ; but 
no vestige of the Roman tongue can be found in the English 
language, but what is known to come through other channels.
The Roman Wall itself is a monument of ages which have 
utterly passed away : a monument which might almost be said to 
have been already an antiquity when the first Englishman gazed 
on it in wonder.
Whatever part the great Wall played in history 
in days when strife within this island was still a strife between Celt 
and Roman, it has played no part since English history began : 
it has not even, like many meaner works, served as a political 
boundary.
The wall is the monument of a past which has utterly 
vanished; a monument of the fortunes of those who came before 
us in the possession of the land which is now ours.
But if the Roman Wall was so early played out, and made a 
mere piece of antiquity for Englishmen to wonder at, it has been 
quite otherwise with that great network of roads which the Romans 
made in this island ; for I believe that until the four-in-hand mail 
and the yellow post chaise were superseded by the iron horse, the 
main arteries of traffic followed by those mails and post chaises 
were identical with those routes along which the Roman armies 
marched, as for instance — the posting road from York to Carlisle.
I believe that a great number of our local cross country roads 
are laid on Roman bottoms, and follow Roman lines.
Until 1750, 
the packhorse traffic between Carlisle and Newcastle followed the 
old Roman road known as the Carelgate, or Stonegate.
The 
packhorse traffic from Kendal to the north went over High Street, 
an undoubted Roman road.
Naturally, from their proximity to a district bitterly hostile to 
Roman rule, the Roman gamsons on the Wall were maintained to 
the latest period of the Roman dominion : it is doubtful if they 
were then withdrawn.
The legions themselves were withdrawn, 
46 
but it seems likely that the auxiliary troops, long stationary in the 
same localities, often in the same forts, ultimately remained among 
a people with whom they must have to a great extent become 
amalgamated.
Long as these foreign mercenaries remained here, 
I cannot say that ethnologists can trace any influence made by 
them on the modem Cumberland peasant, — a fact due rather to 
long lapse of time, than to any excessive morality inculcated on 
Roman troops.
Whatever became of these troops, they were but of little 
effect against the invasions of the Picts and the Scots, the latter of 
whom harried the ex-Roman province, as well from their old seats 
in Ireland, as from their new seats in Galloway, and the west of 
Scotland.
A still more formidable race of pirates infested the 
eastern and southern shores of Britain, known to the Roman as 
Saxons, and whose depredations had long ere now compelled the 
Romans to appoint a Warden (or Comes) of the March or shore 
exposed to the Saxon attack.
These pirates were the English, a 
name which included three Teutonic tribes dwelling in what we 
know as Sleswick, namely the Jutes, to the north of the present 
Jutland ; the Angles, or English proper, just below them ; and the 
Saxons, on the Elbe, — the latter the best kno^vn to the Romans^ 
who included all three under that name ; while the three leagued 
tribes bore among themselves the name of Englishmen, — a name 
unknown to the Romans, but destined to be as famous and as 
glorious as ever was the name of Roman !
These English invaders bestowed the name of Wtelas, or 
Welsh, that is, strangers, upon the people whom they found in 
Britain.
You will understand that I shall use the names 
"Britons" and "Welsh" for the rest of this evening as meaning 
the same people.
The English Conquest of Britain commenced about forty 
years after the departure of the Romans.
The Romanised Britons, 
left to themselves, and unable to protect themselves against the 
Picts and Scots, hired a parcel of English adventurers from 
Jutland, under Hengist and Horsa, who, in A.D. 449, established 
themselves in the Isle of Thanet.
47 
Into the details of the English Conquest of Southern Britain 
I cannot now go.
Of the Conquest of Mid-Britain and North Britain, very little 
is known.
The Estuary of the Humber was the chief gate by 
which they found admission : some turned southwards, and 
founded the kingdom of Mercia, becoming known as marchmen 
between the English and Britons ; those who turned north founded 
the kingdom of Deira, and met further to the north another English 
kingdom, that of Bernicia, founded by Ida, who, in 547, had 
planted his kingdom on the rock of Bamborough.
The great 
forest between Tyne and Tees, was the March or Debateable 
Land between Deira and Bernicia, but these two kingdoms were 
united by yEthelfrith, and formed into the great English kingdom 
of Northumbria, which stretched from the Humber as far north as 
the Forth — you recollect that the east of the present kingdom of 
Scotland up to the Forth was, and is, English ground, though now 
incorporated into Scotland, ^thelfrith was a great conqueror.
In 
603 he defeated the Scots at a place called Dsegsastan, which some 
think to be Dalston, near Carlisle; others Dawston in Liddlesdale.
In 607 he completed the English Conquest of Britain by the 
capture of Chester, and, by so doing, he separated the Britons, of 
what is now Wales, from the Britons to the north of them.
The English Conquest was marked by great atrocity : the 
wealthier Britons fled across the seas ; the poorer took refuge in 
the mountains and the forests, until hunger drove them out to be 
cut down.
So far as the English Conquest extended over 
Britain, it was a complete dispossession; the language of the 
Britons disappeared, as did their Christianity : the one was 
superseded by the English tongue, the latter by the religion of 
Woden and of Thor.
The English Conquest covered the eastern part of Britain.
At the end of the Sixth Century we can make out, among a number 
of obscure and small principalities, seven English kingdoms, of 
which some continuous history can be got.
I. Kent, a Jutish kingdom.
2. Essex; 3.
Sussex; 4.
Wessex; 
all Saxon, as their names denote.
5. East Anglia; 6.
North- 
48 
iimbria; 7.
Mercia; all Angles, or English.
Northumbria included 
the Lothians, and the ground on which the English city of Edin- 
burgh stands.
In the western and more mountainous parts, the Britons held 
their ground : there was a British or Welsh kingdom of West 
Wales, which took in Cornwall, Devon, and part of Somerset, up 
to the river Axe. All the land west of the Severn formed 
a second British or Welsh kingdom, — that of North Wales, 
which included what we now call North and South Wales.
To the north was a third British or Welsh kingdom, — that of 
Strathclyde, which took in Galloway, and the rest of the S.W. of 
Scotland, with modern Cumberland and Westmorland down to the 
river Dee — thus extending from the Clyde to the Dee, until Chester 
was taken by ^Ethelfrith, in 607.
The British or Welsh kingdom of Strathclyde, which thus 
extended from the Clyde to the Dee, was separated from the 
English Northumbria, which extended from the Forth to the 
Humber, by the range of mountains running down the country 
and forming its backbone — the great Pennine range.
Above the Clyde and the Forth were the Picts and the Scots, 
which latter had exuded into Galloway from their seats in Ireland.
If you ask me what was going on in Strathclyde during the 
English Conquest, I can only say I do not know : one of our 
greatest living historians told me he could see nothing through the 
darkness that hung over Strathclyde.
Probably Strathclyde was 
just a collection of petty British or Welsh states, under different 
rulers, having a kingdom of Strathclyde proper, with its capital at 
Alcluid, or Dumbarton, whose ruler probably had a shadowy 
superiority over the others.
Sir Francis Palgrave names the chief 
of these states as follows : — Reged, in the south of Scotland ; 
Strathclyde, or Clydesdale ; and Cumbria, in the south.
Mr. Freeman calls the whole Strathclyde, and that name for 
long overshadowed and absorbed the others ; but you must bear 
in mind the double meaning of the term, the extended and the 
restricted one.
The people who dwelt in this great British or Welsh kingdonj 
49 
were called Cumbri, a designation we first meet with in the 
Chronicle of Ethehverd — at a much later date though than this.
The Saxon Chronicle says, that in 875 the Danes made frequent 
attacks on the "Pehtas " and on " Strsecled Wgelas." Ethehverd 
translates this passage into Latin, as "Pihtis Cumbrisque." Here 
we have theyf/'x/ jiiention in history of our tiame.
Whether it is a corruption of Cambri, i.
e. Welsh, or whether 
it comes from the ciomSy or valleys, with which our country is 
intersected, it is hard to say.
The cwms are common enough — 
as the poet says in the song of "Sally Gray" : — 
There's Cumwhitton,.
Cumwhinton, Cumranton, 
Cumrangen, Cumrew, and Cumcatch, 
And mony mair cums i' the county, 
But nin with Cumdivock can match.
The English Conquest of Britain therefore left this great 
British or Welsh kingdom, extending first from the Dee to the 
Clyde, consisting of small petty states — Reged, Strathclyde, and 
Cumbria, of which sometimes one got the superiority, sometimes 
another; and the name of the one having the upper hand for the 
time got applied to the whole, — ^just as England is used as an 
equivalent for Great Britain and Ireland, because the seat of 
government is in England.
The Britons of Strathclyde, or Cumbria, occupy a tolerably 
large space on the map, but a very small one in history — their 
annals have entirely perislied, and nothing authentic remains con- 
cerning them, except a very few passages, wholly consisting ot 
incidental notices relating to their subjection and their misfortunes.
Romance would furnish much more : for it was in Cumbria 
that Rhydere, or Roderic, the Magnificent, is represented to have 
reigned, and MerUn to have prophesied.
Arthur held his court in 
Merry Carlisle ; and Peredur, the Prince of Sunshine, whose name 
we find amongst the princes of Strathclyde, is one of the great 
heroes of the Mabinogion, or tales of youth, long preserved among 
the Cymric.
These fantastic personages, however, are of importance 
in one point of view, because they show what we might otherwise 
ignore, that from the Ribble, in Lancashire, or thereabouts, up to 
50 
the Clyde, there existed a dense population, composed of Britons, 
who preserved their national language and customs, agreeing in all 
respects with the Welsh of the present day.
So that even in the 
nth century the ancient Britons, or Welsh, inhabited the greater 
part of the western coast of the island, however much they had 
been compelled to submit to the political supremacy of the 
English invaders.
I have said that the English Conquest of Britain ended with 
the capture, in 607, of Chester, by ^thelfrith.
King of Northumbria.
After that event, the character of the warfare between English and 
Briton changed : it died down into a warfare against the separate 
British provinces, West Wales, North Wales, and Cumbria, which 
went on until the victories of that Edward the First who died -on 
Burgh Marsh, 
To return to ^thelfrith.
^thelfrith, before his death in 
617, reduced the petty states of Cumbria to some sort of tributary 
position, and in the reign of Edwine, King of Northumbria, and 
Overlord of Britain, they were so much so, as to be sometimes 
included in the name of Northumbria.
The district was v;ery extensively colonised by Enghsh settlers 
from Northumberland : their settlements may be known by the 
termination "ton." They entered by the great roads the Romans 
had left, and settled right and left of these roads.
One division 
came along the Roman Wall and its road, and settled at Walton 
and Brampton, and turned southwards to Plumpton, and Hutton, 
and Newton, and filled the great central fertile plain of Cumber- 
land to that extent, that it acquired the name of Inglewood, the 
wood of the Angles or EngHsh. Another lot streamed in by the 
Maiden Way : we find them at Alston, in Cumberland ; and at 
Dufton, Marton, Bolton, Orton, CHfton, Helton, and Brampton, 
in Westmorland.
In the west of Cumberland they got to Wigton, 
Aikton, and Oulton ; in fact they absorbed the most fertile and 
most accessible part of Cumberland — that great plain which 
extends from Penrith, widening northwards as the mountains open 
out, and sweeping round westwards by the Solway.
The 
mountains were left to the old inhabitants.
51 
It is not then surprising that Ecgfrid, King of Northumbria, 
who reigned from 670 to 685, absorbed Carlisle and a large 
district round it into Northumbria ; in fact he made Carlisle and 
the district round it English ground^ though not part of the kingdom 
of England, and he handed it to S.
Cuthbert, — for the English 
invaders had been converted from the religion of Woden and of 
Thor to Christianity.
How that was done : how the heathenism 
of Northumbria was attacked— ^rj/, from the south by Paulinus, 
the missionary of the Roman Church ; secondly, by Aidan and by 
Boisil, the missionaries of the Celtic Church ; how Wilfrid of York 
and Benedict Biscop on the one hand, and Colman on the other, 
struggled for the supremacy of their churches, and how the Roman 
Church at the Synod of Whitby won a victory, which enabled her 
to appoint Theodore of Tarsus Metropolitan of England, are 
matters of the deepest interest to us, but belong rather to North- 
umbrian history than to our subject to-night, and I must reluctantly 
forbear to meddle with a topic so alluring.
S. Cuthbert at once visited Carlisle, and found that Ecgfrith 
had gone thence on an expedition against the Picts.
A day or 
two after Cuthbert's arrival, as some of the citizens were taking 
him round for the purpose of showing him the walls of the city, 
and a fountain or well, of marvellous workmanship, constructed by 
the Romans, he suddenly became disturbed in spirit, and leaning 
on his staff he bent down his face sadly to the ground, and again 
raising himself up, he lifted his eyes to heaven, and groaning 
deeply, he muttered " Perhaps at this very moment the hazard of 
the battle is over." When questioned by the bystanders, he 
would say no more than, "Do you not see how marvellously 
disturbed the air is !
and who among mortals is sufficient to search 
out the judgment of God !" Next day, a Sunday, he preached, 
and the burden of his discourse was, "Watch and Pray, Watch 
and Pray," which his hearers misapplied to the expected recurrence 
of a plague, which had recently ravaged the district.
In a few 
days came a sohtary fugitive, who announced that "the Picts had 
turned desperately to bay as the English army entered Fife, and 
52 
that Ecgfrith and the flower of his nobles lay a ghastly ring of 
corpses on the far off moorland of Nechtansmere." 
Enquiry revealed the fact that the king fell on the very day, 
and at the very hour at which S.
Cuthbert bent over the old 
Roman fountain in Carlisle.
On the moorland of Nechtansmere, there fell for ever with 
King Ecgfrith, in 685, the Northumbrian supremacy over England.
Mercia at once struck for independence : Galloway rose, and 
chased the Northumbrian Bishop Trumwine out of Whitherne, 
which stands, Bede says, "by the arm of the sea," i.e. the Sol way 
"which parts the lands of the English and Scots," — proof that in 
685, if not long before, the district now known as Cumberland, had 
become English Ground, but not part of the kingdom of 
England.
But it still remained subject to the fallen Northumbria, 
which had vitality enough to capture, in 756, Alcluid, and thus all 
Strathclyde, except Galloway, became tributary to Northumbria, 
which was too weak to retain its rule.
The inhabitants of 
Strathclyde thus got left to themselves for a century or so, during 
which their country was the scene of much confused fighting, in 
which English, Scots, Norsemen, and Danes all took part.
The weakness of Northumbria allowed that kingdom to fall 
an easy prey to a new race of invaders — the Danes.
Between 
867 and 869 they conquered Northumbria, and dismembered it: 
Deira, now Yorkshire, they seized and occupied ; Bernicia they 
made a tributary.
Halfdene was the Danish leader, who, in 876, 
occupied Deira, and he extended his ravages into modern Cumber, 
land.
He laid Carlisle in ruins, so that for two hundred years it 
laid waste, and large oaks grew on its site.
He and Guthrun, his 
successor, dismembered Northumberland.
Great part of England 
became subject to Danish rule, and known as the Danislagh.
On the dismemberment of Northumbria by the Danes, 
Carlisle and the district around it, or Carliol, fell to neither 
English nor Danish rule.
It turns up incorporated with Strathclyde 
proper, and with Galloway under the name of Cumbria.
One 
Grig, king or regent of Scotland, i.
e. of the Scots and the 
5:^ 
Picts is said to have brought this about by force of arms, and 
patriotic Scottish writers blow him out into Gregorius Magnus, 
King of Scotland, conqueror of England, Ireland, and the 
Danislagh.
Marriage with a British Princess, rather than conquest, 
or perhaps the two combined, must have been the causes of 
Grig's success.
After Grig's death, we find there was some 
relationship between the Kings of Scotland and Strathclyde (or 
Cumbria).
Meanwhile the English and the Danes had been fighting with 
great vigor.
Alfred the Great had commenced the attempt to 
reduce to English rule the territory known as the Danislagh, where 
Danish laws and customs prevailed.
Edward the Elder, King of 
the English, continued the warfare, and, in 924, he wrested 
Manchester from the Danes, whereon the whole of the North laid 
itself at his feet ;— not only Northumbria, including the Lothians, 
but the Scots and Picts of Scotland ; and the Britons of Cumbria 
choose him to be " Father and Overlord." The Britons of 
North Wales had done so before, and thus Edward, King of the 
English, became Overlord, or Emperor of the Britons and the 
Scots.
This transaction is called the Commendation to England of 
Scotland and Strathclyde.
Its date is 924 A.D. Fierce has been 
the war of pens that has raged over this transaction.
Scottish 
historians can ill brook to own that, in 924, Scotland declared 
itself vassal to England, and their energies have been directed to 
the whittling away of its importance.
But it was the foundation of 
all the claims made by Edward I.
to Scotland.
At the time it was of but little practical importance : the 
Overlord, Edward the Elder, died almost immediately.
War at 
once broke out all over the North, and lasted, spite of a peace 
made at Dacre in Cumberland, until Ethelstan, king of the 
English, in 939, defeated Constantine, king of Scotland, and 
Eugenius, or Owen, king of Cumbria, at the battle of Bruanburgh.
Eugenius, or Owen, whichever may be his name, fell in this battle, 
whose site is unknown.
In 945 Dunmail, " the last king of rocky Cumbria," fell out 
with his Overlord, Eadmund the Magnificent, king of the EngUsb, 
who at once fell upon Cumbria, laid the whole of it waste, and 
and handed it over to Malcolm, king of Scotland, on condition 
that he should be his ally by land and sea.
Tradition says that 
the decisive battle between the English and the Britons of Cumbria 
took place at Dunmail Raise, and that King Dunmail fell there.
The poet says : — 
They buried on the mountain side 
King Dunmail, where he fought and died ; 
But mount, and mere, and moor again 
Shall see King Dunmail come again.
Mantled and mailed, repose his bones, 
Twelve cubits deep beneath the stones ; 
But many a fathom deeper down 
In Grisedale's tarn, lies Dunmail's crown.
But Dunmail, mantled, crowned, and mailed.
Again shall Cumbria's King be hailed : 
And o'er his hills and valleys reign.
When Eildon's heights are field and plain.
* 
Alas for the poet and for the legend !
King Dunmail escaped, and 
died peaceably at Rome thirty years afterwards.
To briefly review these events, which are of great political 
importance in our history.
King Dunmail was, by virtue of the 
Commendation of 925, vassal to King Eadmund.
He revolted 
against his Overlord, who took his kingdom from him, and granted 
it in 945 to Malcolm I., king of Scotland, as a feudal benefice in 
the strictest sense.
Cumbria thus became 2i fief of the Crown of 
England, but not a fief held within the kingdom of Efigland: it was 
•without that kingdom, and had always been so.
From this time Cumbria continued in the possession of the 
royal line of Scotland, held as a fief under the English king, either 
by the king of Scotland himself, or by a near relation — usually by 
his proximate heir.
Nothing is recorded of it for many years, except that in the 
* Lays and Legends of the English Lake Country.
By J.
Pagen White, p.
255.
55 
year A.D. looo, it was laid waste by the English.
At this time it 
was the chief rendezvous of the Danes in Britain : it is doubtful 
whether the English attack was on the native Cumbrians, or on the 
Danish settlers.
This reiidezvoitsAng of the Danes in Cumbria 
would be the time when they made extensive settlements in the 
district now Cumberland and Westmorland, which may yet be 
known by the termination "by." There are some sixty-three of 
these.
Like the " tons," the English "tons," they occupy the best 
of the country, running in a circle frcrm Appleby on the S.E. along 
the Cumbrian plain to Allonby on the Solway, and cropping up 
again at Ponsonby.
In addition to this Danish colonization, was an extensive one 
from Norway, utterly unrecorded in history, but proved beyond 
possibility of cavil by the researches of my cousin, the well known 
Scandinavian scholar, Mr. Ferguson, M.P.
The place names of the district prove it — above one hundred 
end in the Norse termination of " thwaite"; nearly as many (I am 
not certain of the number) end in the Norse termination "garth," 
or "guards," or "gard." These names lie, not in the plain, but in 
the high ground avoided by the Danish bys and the English tons.
The thwaites occupy higher ground, as a rule, than the guards.
They lie thickest towards the west of the district, thus showing the 
Norsemen to have entered from the west.
They came from their 
depot in the Isle of Man, which they had seized.
There exists a 
striking similarity between the place-names in that Island, and in 
West Cumberland.
Amid all these settlers and invaders— EngUsh, Danes, and 
Norse — the Britons, or Welsh of Strathclyde, Reged, and Cumbria 
gradually melted into the surrounding population, and their lan- 
guage ceased to be discernible as that of a separate race.
But 
that was a slow process : their language is thought to have lingered 
in secluded places until the Reformation, when it was possibly 
destroyed by the ministrations of the Protestant clergy.
A few 
British local traditions still remain among us.
Pendragon Castle 
reminds the traveller of the fabled Ather, or Uther.
Some of the 
mountains which adorn the landscape, retain the appellations gives 
:)6 
to them by the original population, and Skiddaw and Helvellyn 
now rise as the sepulcliral monuments of a race Avhich has passed 
away.
My next task — I will be brief — is to shew how from the 
kingdom of Cumbria, the southern portion, the lordship of Carlisle 
was cut off; but first I must mention a very important and 
authentic document, which sets forth the exact limits of the 
kingdom of Cumbria previous to the dismemberment.
When Edward I.
put forth his claims to a paramount 
superiority over the realm of Scotland, based on the Commend- 
ation of 925, he directed the various religious houses throughout 
the kingdom to furnish him with all the information in their 
possession, historical or documentary, bearing on the ancient 
relations between England and Scotland.
Amongst the returns 
from the monastery of Carlisle is the following important statement 
as to the boundaries of Cumbria, at the period in question : — 
"That district was called Cumbria which is now included in the 
bishoprics of Carlisle, Glasgow, and Whitherne, together with the 
country between the bishopric of Carlisle and the river Duddon." 
I need not remind you the bishopric of Carlisle, as it stood 
prior to the death of Bishop Percy, in 1856, is meant — and also 
that it includes part of what is now Westmorland.
About the middle of the loth century, the English had put 
an end to the kingdom of Northumberland, and entrusted its 
government to a series of Earls, of whom Siward is the best 
known.
Siward was appointed by Edward the Confessor, and he 
defeated and slew Macbeth, king of Scodand, the murderer of 
Duncan, king of Scotland.
Malcolm, son of the murdered 
monarch, was king of Cumbria.
Either this Malcolm, or 
his son of the same name, was placed by Siward on the 
throne of Scotland, and as Malcolm Caenmore long retained 
both Cumbria and Strathclyde in his hands.
During his 
reign, however, the district of Carlisle, that is all the Cumbrian 
territory south of the Solway (which you will not forget includes a 
great piece of Westmorland) was severed from the rest of Mal- 
colm's dominions.
The date of this is uncertain, but it would 
appear to be 1070, in whicli year, as we learn from Simon of 
Durham, Gospatric, Earl of Northumberland, over-ran that district, 
in revenge for the devastation of Teesdale by the Scots.
His son 
Dolphin, was put in possession of the territory thus wrenched 
from Malcolm's dominions, from Cumbria.
The next authentic information we have from the Saxon 
Chronicle, under date A.D. 1092:- — "The King, [i.e. William 
Rufus) went northwards with a large army to Carlisle, where he 
repaired the City, built the Castle, and drove out Dolphin, who 
had previously governed the Country, and having placed a garrison 
in the Castle, he returned south, and sent a great number of 
English husbandmen thither with horses and cattle, that they might 
settle there and cultivate the lands." 
Thus the present boundaries between England and Scotland 
were established, and the district whose history we are dealing 
with to-night became for the first time part of t/ie English kingdom, 
and England assumed her present geographical limits.
William Rufus retained the district round Carlisle in his 
own hands, but in the time of his successor, Henry I., we find 
Ranulph de Meschines in possession of it as the Earl of Carlisle, 
or Carleolum.
Ranulph de Meschines married Lucia, the daughter 
of Ivo Tailboise, and widow of Roger de Romara.
Through her 
father Lucia was seized of the great possessions known as Arnoun- 
derness, which included the Barony of Kendal, the S.W. corner of 
what is now Cumberland, all Lancashire north of the Ribble, and 
the wapentake of Ewcross, in Yorkshire.
This magnificent property Ranulph de Meschines, by his 
marriage with Lucia de Romara, added to his Earldom of Carlisle, 
as well as estates in Lincolnshire, which don't concern us.
This 
was much to the detriment of William de Romara, son of Lucia 
by her first husband.
In the year 11 18, Richard, Earl of Chester, perished in the 
White Ship with the unlucky Prince William, the only son of 
Henry L, and his possessions and Earldom fell to the Crown.
Ranulph de Meschines became Earl of Chester, and exchanged 
his northern possessions, as well those of the Earldom of Carlisle, 
58   
as those he got by Lucia de Romara, for the Earldom of Chester.
The Crown pacified Lucia's son William by handing over to 
hira all his mother's possessions, except the Barony of Kendal, and 
the land between it and the Earldom of Carlisle.
Now the Crown had discovered that the policy of entrusting 
the defence of its borders and marches to great Earls, who enjoyed 
jura regalia was a very bad policy for the Crown, who found these 
great Eails hard to control.
Thus it came to pass that no new 
Earl of Carlisle, or Carleolum, was appointed ; and so no county 
palatinate of Carleolum, an iniperium in imperio, with its own barons 
and courts, like those of Durham and Cheshire, has come down to 
us.
The Earldom of Carleolum, the Barony of Kendal, and the 
strip that intervened between them, were handed over to sheriffs, 
to rule over, and divided into the two counties of Carliol 
and Westmorland ; and these counties are accounted for by their 
sheriffs in the Pipe Roll of the 31 Henry L (A.D. 1130) under 
these names.
To form these two counties the Earldom of Carleolum 
was split into two.
The Barony of Appleby, now the East and 
West Wards of AVestmorland, was taken from the Earldom of 
Carliol, and added to the Barony of Kendal, and formed into the 
County of Westmorland.
What remained of the Earldom of Carliol was, with small 
additions, which brought its southern boundary to the Duddon, 
formed into the County of Carleolum, which in the Pipe Rolls of 
23 Henry II.
(1177) first appears as the "County of Cumberland," 
and that designation it has ever since retained.
To sum up.
The English invasion of Britain left a kingdom 
of Strathclyde or Cumbria, which once stretched from the Dee to 
the Clyde, but which got somewhat contracted in its southern 
borders.
Gospatric, Earl of Northumberland, tore away the 
southern portion of this kingdom, and Dolphin, his son, got the 
portion so torn away.
William Rufus turned out Dolphin, and 
Henry I.
gave it as the Earldom of Carleolum to Ranulph de 
Meschines.
Ranulph de Meschines surrendered the Earldom, and 
59 
it was, with some English additions, spHt into the two counties of 
Cumberland and Westmorland.
As for the inhabitants of Cumberland, Who are they '?
The prae-Aryan long-headed men, with stone weapons, who 
spoke Euskarian, were superseded by round-headed Aryans, with 
bronze weapons, who spoke Celtic.
To them came as conquerors 
the Romans, who for three hundred and fifty years held the land 
in thrall by means of a motley garrison drawn from almost every 
nation known to the ancients, but which has left no trace that 
the ethnologist or the philologist can seize.
The works of the 
Romans alone defy the obliterating influence of man.
Then followed another Aryan invasion — a Teutonic one this 
— the English invasion ; then the Danes and the Norsemen.
To 
these elements of population there was added in the days of the 
sons of William the Conqueror a Low-Dutch element, English and 
Flemish settlers, and a few great Norman barons.
All these later 
settlers and invaders, from the round-headed man with the bronze 
weapons, were of the fair stock, or Xanthochroi.
Out of all this 
mixture have come the Cumbrians of to-day.
Very careful tables have been drawn up by very careful 
observers, as to the proportions in which the dark and fair stocks 
are mixed.

THE HISTORY AND BALLADS OF THE BORDER.
By R.
a. ALLISON.
(Read at Longtown.) 
When you look northward from your little town, or the high 
ground in its vicinity, your eye catches, as the most prominent 
object in the landscape, the westernmost summits of the gently 
rounded heights of that range of hill country, which sweeps across 
from the eastern coast, right away to, and along the shores of the 
Solway Frith.
These hills constitute in the main what we call the 
district of the Border — a district which recalls to our minds by its 
very name, some of the most stirring scenes in our national and 
local history.
The Border land — the land of Tweed and Teviot — 
of Liddell and Annan, and Esk and Kirtle — what memories are 
not connected with every one of its hills and dales and streams?
There every field has its battle, and every rivulet its song, and how 
we still love to visit its old towers and keeps, and dream of the 
romance and chivalry of the past !
They speak to us of a grandly 
exciting time, when the chieftain's foot was often in the stirrup, and 
the midnight foray was man's ordinary pastime.
Their very names 
are instinct with a charm and a poetry, which can never be dis- 
sociated from them ; and of no man in the world, I suppose, than 
the Borderer, are Goldsmith's lines more true, however far he may 
have travelled in search of that wealth which Scotchmen proverbi- 
ally do not despise.
Still he says — 
Where'er I roam, whatever lands I see, 
My heart untravelled, fondly turns to thee.
The names of his native hills and dales are often on his tongue, 
62 
for they are musical for ever in the Ballads of the Borders — as 
musical as the melody of the streams that flow beside them, and 
form so striking a feature in the landscape.
The waters and the 
dales of Annan and Esk and Liddell — of Kirtle and of Yarrow — 
the Kershope Foot — the Langholm holm — the Cannobie Lee — 
these are full of memories of joy and sorrow— -they tell us of the 
sunshine of the past, and of tales, too, of sorrow and suffering such 
as we hope they may never see again.
Well, I think we are near 
enough to this famous district to make it not altogether uninteresting 
to us.
We have reason here to know something of the Border; and 
when we look at the rounded outlines of its blue hills, with their ever 
varying eftects of light and shade, of sun and cloud and mist — we 
may remember that thence came the men, who for centuries kept 
this district in terror and alarm, and we can picture the hills lit up 
with the fires, that were- the signals of their coming.
Those days, 
happily, are past and gone — let us now remember rather that from 
that district, and out of the wild and stirring life of its indwellers, 
has come some of the sweetest Minstrelsy we know, that has linked 
the name of the Border with a magic charm, which the most 
unimaginative of us cannot refuse to feel.
Other hills and moun- 
tains are loftier far, and fuller of grander and more striking scenes, 
but none speak to us with a more tender, more real, more human 
voice, than those of the district of which I am to speak to-night.
I need hardly say how different — how much more modern are the 
associations connected with the mountains of our own lake district, 
to those which crowd upon our memories at the sight of their 
humbler neighbours, the Border fells.
And you will observe in the first place, the historical 
associations connected with it are precisely such as the name it 
bears would lead us to expect.
For centuries it was the scene of 
the struggles of hostile races engaged in that popular modem 
pastime — the search for a scientific frontier.
The rules of the 
game seem to have been very much the same then as they are 
now — 
That they should take who have the power, 
And they should keep who can.
63 
Here they seemed to find a frontier.
Nature herself seemed to 
have stamped on its dreary moors and wastes a character of wi\d- 
ness and desolation, which fitted it to be the barrier between their 
contending hates.
I need not remind you here, where it seems to 
me we are always so much better able than elsewhere, to realize 
and bring back to our minds the great power and vast resources of 
the Roman rule in Britain, and the firm hold it had upon the 
country, where we still have in our midst their camps, and mounds, 
and ditches, preserved by their wild and inaccessible position from 
the destroying influence of the peaceful plough, so strangely perfect 
and complete — their roads still to be traced in their onward 
unswerving course, that turns aside neither from steep hill nor 
treacherous morass — with all the wealth of altars and other relics 
that they have yielded, and are still yielding, to^our antiquaries' 
research — I need not remind you, how these early conquerors 
erected their first and chief barrier just on the edge of this Border 
district, from Tynemouth to Bowness.
It was a great military 
outpost, from behind which their soldiers might sally forth to fresh 
conquests against the wild tribes that lay in the hills beyond, whom 
they never wholly subjugated and subdued, and to which they 
might retire again in times, when danger threatened.
And when at 
the beginning of the fifth century they left this country — as it 
turned out, never to return — they left behind them the native 
British tribes, the Cymri, whose name still lives, I suppose, in the 
title given to our county — Cumberland, the land of the Cymri — to 
carry on the struggle for their native soil against the Picts of the 
north, and other invaders, such as the Angles and their kindred 
Saxons, from the east and south.
It was, I doubt not, a wild unsettled 
time, such as the Border has often seen, but a time of which we 
know but little.
But one name is then connected with the district 
which, though not the topic of any of our more familiar Ballads, 
has inspired, and still inspires, the song of many a famous poet.
It is here, as is generally believed — and many arguments may be 
adduced for the belief—it is here that the exploits of the famous 
King Arthur were performed — the king, whose achievements fill 
the poetry o the middle ages, and whose memory lives again in 
64 
modern days in the series of poems, in which our Poet Laureate 
has illustrated his career.
It was to this period of our early 
history that Milton turned, when he was meditating the intended 
work, which he hoped posterity would not let die.
The circum- 
stances of Milton's days, however — the rude revolution which 
burst over the country in the middle of the seventeenth century, 
in the end gave another issue to his thoughts, and — 
The British theme, the old 
Romantic tale, by Milton left unsung, 
was left to others to adorn.
And so much, at one time or 
another, by myth, and poem, and tradition, has it been adorned, 
that Arthur's very existence has at times been doubted.
We need 
not do this.
He was, there seems every reason to believe, a great 
leader of the native Britons in this district of Strathclyde in the 
sixth century ; he became to them the champion of their race, the 
assertor of their liberties, and has lived on in the grateful memories 
of his countrymen, as a type of the highest ideal of excellence to 
which personal prowess and worth — in spite of some great faults 
and some great errors — can attain.
"The old world," says one of 
the chroniclers, " knows not his peer, nor will the future show us 
his equal : he alone towers above all other kings — better than the 
past ones, and greater than those that are to be.
^' Rex quondam rexque 
futtij-us — the king that was and yet shall be again — according to the 
legendary inscription on his tomb — he was treasured up in the 
recollections of a long posterity, with all the love and fondness 
which people feel for the leaders, who in critical moments have 
placed themselves at their head.
Well, though history — for he 
lived before the days of historical records — does not fix for us in 
definite terms the date and the scenes of his great adventures, yet 
nowhere, as has recently been shown by Mr. Stuart Glennie, in his 
ArtJiurian LocalHies, so much as in this Border district, has he left 
his mark indelibly in the names of the localities, Avith which he 
must have been connected.
In this respect it is truly Arthur-land 
— the land through which he swept with his famous battles^ 
bringing peace and deliverance to the people whom he led — peace 
65 
and deliverance to the poor Britons of the Border, who loved their 
wild hills and wooded dales, and fought for them with a 
tenacity as great, as has ever been displayed by their successors, on 
other occasions in later days.
I need not remind you that at 
Penrith we have King Arthur's table — of his connection with Tarn 
Wadling, which has now disappeared — or how, according to an 
early song — 
A long while 
He sojourned in menie Carlisle.
But beyond this it has been recently contended by one* who has 
explored the whole district from this to Edinburgh, with its Arthur's 
Seat,- for traces of his hero — that his last great battle was fought on 
the rising ground of Arthuret, to the south of Longtown ; that the 
Solway itself, as you may remember when next you listen to the 
lapping of its waters on the shore — the Solway itself was "the 
level lake," into the waters of which, beneath the glories of the 
winter moon, the famous brand of the dying king, Excalibur, was 
thrown, and from which rose the mystic arm, that brandished it 
thrice, ere it disappeared, in token of the ultimate triumph of the 
genius of the Celtic race.
Conjectural as this may be, the real connection of King 
Arthur with the district, I think, we need not doubt.
And other 
struggles succeeded when he had past away.
And now we have 
the contests of religion added to those of race : we find a Christian 
party contending against a pagan one, and as the result of a 
great and famous battle on the Liddell, " which for generations," 
we are told, "saddened the song of the Cymri," we have a 
Christian bishop, S.
Kentigern, known too, as S.
Mungo the 
beloved — the young and zealous Christian missionary — appointed 
to bear rule over the district from Glasgow to beyond Carlisle 
He, too, has left his traces amongst us.
The three great miracles 
he performed, you will find borne on the arms of the great com- 
mercial city of Glasgow, and amongst ourselves we have churches, 
and those the oldest in the district, as at Irthington and Cros- 
* Mr. Stuart Glennie in his " Arthurian Localities, " and also 
Professor Veitch in his History of the Scottish Border.
66 
thwaite, dedicated in his name.
An interesting story is told by 
the chroniclers, how the new bishop in his wanderings by Tweed- 
side, met Merlin, the famous seer of the age — who had been 
among the defeated pagan party at the battle— how he met him, 
and pressed upon him, but in vain, the claims of the new faith he 
had come to preach.
Merlin, like many others, clung to his old 
gods, to the old superstitions in which he had been reared.
He 
turned again to his native hills and dales for solace, and at length 
found his grave by Tweed, beneath an aged thorn tree, still, says 
Sir W.
Scott, in his Scottish Minstrelsy, to be seen.
There 
Is Merlin prisoner till the judgment day.
St. Kentigern himself was a follower of the great Scotch Saint 
Columba ; and the influence of that great teacher never reached 
much further south than it did in the 6th and 7th centuries.
It was 
rolled back in the end by that other tide of teaching which came 
from Rome with St. Augustine ; but the Border was the barrier 
once again, and so you have in these early events the germ of the 
distinction, that to-day exists between Presbyterian Scotland and 
Episcopal England.
It would be quite impossible for any but a profound antiquary 
—and I have no pretension to be such— to steer you through the 
various conflicting struggles between the different races and nation- 
alities, which strove together on the Border from the 7 th to the 
loth century.
I don't know that even they always make it very 
clear, even to each other, for antiquaries, I have observed, like 
doctors, sometimes differ.
But it is not difficult to give you an 
idea of what was happening, to shew you how, out of this seething 
mass in constant contention and ever varying strife, sprang the 
Borderers as we find them in later days, having in them, and their 
habits, and their language, many traces of the old Cymric race, 
who had been the original possessors of the soil, but among whom 
had been introduced a large mixture of those other elements, which 
have united to form our English people.
We are, as some one 
said the other day, a piebald mixture of peoples, and the Borderers 
are no exemption to the rule.
We have the Anglo Sa^^on— what 
k 
67 
is called the Teutonic element in our race, largely intermingling 
with our native stock ; and then, and especially at the period of 
which we are speaking now, we find another body of strangers 
invading the district and settling in it, it would seem, in consider- 
able numbers — I mean the Danes and Norse, belonging to the Scan- 
dinavian races, from the north of Europe — the great free-booters 
of the time, whose name was known and feared on every coast.
In 875 the Danes took and destroyed Carlisle; and though the 
history of their battles is dim and dark and vague, as all history 
is in such early days, yet they have left behind them their mark in 
characters which none can dispute, in the names of many localities 
on the Borders, and the language of those who dwell there.
And 
if we may believe Mr. Worsaae, in his Danes in England, it is not 
only in these respects that the connection may be noted, but in our 
personal appearance too.
" In the northern parts of England," he 
says, " I saw, and especially in the rural districts, faces exactly 
resembling those at home.
Had I met the same persons in 
Denmark or in Norway, it would never have entered my mind 
that they were foreigners." However this may be, nothing 
certainly is more sure, than that in the names of the localities we 
know so well to-day, we have the traces of the different peoples 
who, at one time or another, have been here, and amongst 
them of the Danes.
As we might almost expect, the names of 
some of the most marked objects in our scenery, of our principal 
rivers, of our chiefest town, of our highest hills, take us back to the 
old British period, and the original dwellers on the soil.
To them 
belong Annan, and Esk, and Lyne, and Eden, and Caldew, among 
our streams; the Cheviots among our hills ; and Carlisle of our larger 
towns.
Car in Carlisle, is said to be Caer, a fort ; and is found also 
in the family name of Kerr, or Carr — one of the few that can be 
referred to British origin.
But then we have also many names and 
words in use which remind of the Anglo Saxon element in our 
composition.
The very common suffix, ton — a town, as you have 
it in so many of our villages — this is one of its contributions to the 
nomenclature of the district.
And to the same source we owe such 
words as lee., for a plain — croft — 7mler—fofd—cleug/i, a rugged 
68 
ascent, as you have it in Cleiighside — and many others too numerous 
to name.
But not less clearly have the Danes, too, left their mark 
behind them here.
Whenever you find — instead of the ton, or 
town, I just now mentioned — whenever you find by, or bye, you 
know that there the Dane has been.
And so to them, too, are 
due some of the most distinctive words in our common dialect — 
such words as fell and rig, for a hill ; wath for a ford ; and hope for 
a valley, scaur or scar, dale.
When you use bairn for child ; when 
they say they will^^r a person in the sense of make him do it; when 
they speak o{ frefnd folk, of a dyke, of a gowk, of a kirn, of a fnidden, 
of a sark, of a neb, of reek* — in all these they are using words we owe 
to our Danish forefathers, who landed and settled in this district a 
thousand years ago, and seemed likely at one moment to destroy 
even the little of Christianity and civilization to which we had then 
attained.
Sometimes in the name of a place you have two 
languages — the traces of two different possessors combined.
The 
second comer finding a place already named, added to it from 
his own dialect some further name appropriate to the locality.
Springkell, for instance, is such a case — for kell is merely Danish for 
a spring.
Scarbank is possibly another.
In Dormanstead, both 
man and stead mean place — the one Old British, the other Anglo 
Saxon.
Some think that among the different peoples, which have 
thus in succession settled here, it is to the Danes more than the 
others that we owe that poetic taste and skill, which have found 
their outlet in the Border Ballads.
But I don't know why we 
should assign their origin to one race rather than another.
In 
every early race there is a tendency found more or less among 
them all, to throw into a rhythmic form that clings more easily to 
the memory, the stirring events of a restless and adventurous life, 
and that vividness — that intense reality — that graphic force we 
admire and love in them, is due to the conditions under which 
their authors lived — the conditions of an age when every man felt 
from day to day that his life was in his hand — when he waged a 
continual struggle with the powers of Nature or the craft of man 
* These are taken from a long list given by Professor Veitch, in the work 
already referred to.
69 
— when he had neither time, nor incHnation, nor inducement, to 
utter anything but that which he strongly and intensely felt.
" Early 
poets," says Sir Walter Scott, " almost uniformly display a bold, 
rude original cast of genius and expression.
They have walked at 
free will, and with unconstrained steps along the wilds of Parnassus, 
while their followers move with constrained gestures and forced 
attitudes to avoid placing their feet, where their predecessors have 
stepped before them." Such ballads are the very outcome of the 
people's life, they breathe their spirit, record the incidents that 
most thrilled their hearts, and the sentiments and emotions that 
inspired them.
And there is no reason to beheve that the old 
Cymri, who stand out upon the threshold of our history, 
who loved their native hills, and dales, and streams, and 
fought for them so stoutly against the various invaders that sought 
to dispossess them, had less of those sentiments and emotions than 
other early races, or were less able to throw them into the sort of 
rude rhythms, that were then their only literature.
At the close of the nth century, the Normans, as you know 
established themselves in this countr)'.
They brought with them, 
both in Church and State, more developed ideas of law and 
government, and organization, than had been known before.
Many 
Norman families settled here amongst us in the north ; but I fear 
they did little to tranquilize the Border, and possibly only 
introduced another element of disturbance.
It was still to remain 
for centuries to come, what it is described by an old chronicle of 
the day — "a certain district lying between England and Scotland" 
— claimed by both, the claim acknowledged by neither — fit nursing 
ground for the men 
Who stole the beeves to make their broth, 
From England and from Scotland both.
At CarUsle we know the old Castle was erected to frown upon 
Northern invaders ; and by its side rose the Cathedral, to be the 
seat of the new Bishopric, which was soon to be established.
But 
past them both, a long tide of invasion, from the one side and the 
other, must have flowed.
Cumberland was Scottish almost as much 
^0 
as English soil.
It is not included in the famous Domesday Book, 
the inventory of the possessions of the English Crown.
To under- 
stand the whole jDeriod, you must set yourselves free, as has been 
said by Mr. Freeman,* from the bondage of the modern map and 
modern nomenclature.
If you use the words England and Scotland 
at all in reference to the district, you must remember that they do 
not represent what they represent in modern days — that they 
represent rather two forces which were struggling together for the 
mastery, of which the converging point was the Border line.
The 
northern counties were the cause of standing feud between English 
and Scottish kings.
Sometimes the south, of what is now Scotland, 
was annexed to England ; sometimes the north of England was 
seized by the rival claimant.
Cumberland for a considerable time 
was held by them as a fief, for which they did homage to the 
English Crown.
David, the king of Scotland — one of the few 
monarchs who has been called, and deserves to be called a saint 
— to whom she owes so many of her famous churches and abbeys — 
to whom, perhaps, we owe some of our own religious foundations 
on this side of the Border — whose liberality to the Church made 
him, his successor said, "a sore saint to the crown" — he held 
English Cumberland (for there was then a Scotch Cumberland as 
well) in the 1 2th century.
His son Henry did the same.
A Uttle 
later it was ceded altogether by the Treaty of Carlisle to the 
Scottish Crown : only, however, to be surrendered back again some 
ten years after.
It came pretty much to this : it was always claimed 
by the stronger party for the time.
Like any other property in 
dispute, it was not a pleasant place to dwell in.
All the wild 
and predatory habits of those who dwelt in it, were encouraged 
and fed by the uncertain shifting condition of things, in which they 
found themselves.
At the death of the first holder of the see, in 
II 5 6, it was impossible to find a successor : no one cared to be 
bishop of Carlisle ; and nearly seventy years elapsed before any 
bishop could be got who would reside within the diocese.
'\\Tiat 
temporalities there were, were held and enjoyed by foreigners.

There was ample reason, I dare say, for the "nolo Episcopari" in 
this case.
There was room enough, no doubt, for the teachings of 
the ministers of peace; but extremely little to be extracted in 
return in way of salaries.
We read to-day of the woes and 
sufferings of the subject races in the Turkish Empire : you may 
find a not inapt parallel to them in the history of your own district 
six or seven hundred years ago.
In the warfare carried on, 
churches were violated, and neither sex nor age, I fear, was 
spared.
Again and again, from the page of the old chroniclers, 
ascends the cry of sorrow and distress.
One can imagine the lines 
to have been penned with trembling fingers.
Thus, in 12 15, in 
the chronicle of Lanercost, we read of Alexander, king of Scotland, 
entering England with his army, and wasting all the county as far 
as CarUsle with fire and SAvord.
They then turned aside to the 
monastery of Holm Ciiltram, stripped it bare of all that it possessed, 
and took from a poor monk, who was at the time sick in the 
hospital, the few scanty rags that covered him.
And there were 
no special correspondents in those days, to spread the news 
of these barbarities.
Force and violence reigned supreme.
Bishops, when they were found, were as often in the saddle as the 
sanctuary.
John Halton, who was bishop a little later, in the 
days of Edward L, seems rather to have discharged the duties 
of commander-in-chief of the Northern forces, or colonel of a Depot- 
centre.
He was constable of Carlisle Castle, and charged with its 
repair.
His letters, many of which remain, are filled with the 
details of constantly recurring wars.
He has often to beg that his 
diocese may be exempted from payment of the tithes demanded by 
the Church of Rome.
Some parishes are to pay two-thirds — Scaleby 
figures among these — others, as Arthuret, are exempted altogether, 
by reason of the hostile inroad of the Scots.
What could be derived 
from parishes where frequently there was nothing left to tithe ?
It 
was the aim of Edward I.
to improve this terrible condition of 
affairs ; to consolidate the two kingdoms under one crown ; and to 
do with Scotland as he had done with Wales.
An opportunity in 
the earlier years of his reign presented itself for doing so, in the 
circumstance that, on the death of Alexander, the crown descended 
72 
to his granddaughter Margaret, the daughter of the king of Norway- 
Edward proiDOsed to marry his eldest son to the young Queen, and 
so unite the kingdoms.
But unfortunately his plans were frustrated 
by the death of Margaret, and three wild and stormy centuries 
were to intervene ere the Rose and the Thistle could be intertwined.
Foiled thus in his attempts at a peaceable solution of the question, 
you know how Edward afterwards endeavoured to effect his object 
by war ; how the independence of the country was asserted among 
others by William Wallace (himself a Borderer), with all the 
courage, and, I am afraid also, with all the wildness and vindictive- 
ness of the Borderer's character; and how, at last, the English king 
died on Burgh Marsh on the eve of another expedition ; how, on 
his tomb in the Abbey Church of Westminster you find the 
inscription, "Malleus Scottorum" — the hammer of the Scotch.
Perhaps, looking back to-day, it would have been well for both 
countries if his object had been achieved.
Scotland would have 
escaped the disasters which followed in after days at Pinkie, and 
Solway Moss, and Flodden ; and many an Englishman would not 
have bled on the field of Bannockburn.
The continued struggles between the successors of Edward 
and the Scots, embittered yet more, as we might expect, the 
relations between the countries ; and this embitterment was 
naturally most strongly felt upon the Borders.
Hate and resistance 
to the Southron — this was their rallying cry ; and it was this, and 
often this only, that formed their bond of union with their Scottish 
monarch, of whom, in other respects, they claimed and exercised 
a considerable measure of independence.
They were most 
useful, no doubt, when there was war between North and South ; 
but at other times they were neither agreeable nor profitable as 
subjects.
They claimed to be, and to a considerable extent they 
were, their own masters, and almost as troublesome to their own 
kings as they were to anybody else.
They had won their 
possessions by the sword, and by the sword they kept them — 
Like as I won them, sae will I keep them, 
Contrair a' kings in Christentie, 
says the outlaw Murray in the ballad, and he only echoed the 
general feeling upon the subject.
Every now and again, when they 
had grown more unruly than their wont — when there was among 
them some reiver more notorious than the rest, the Scottish 
monarch of the day swept down upon his stronghold, and made 
him an example to his fellows.
One of the most signal instances 
is that of the execution of Armstrong, the laird of Gilnockie, by 
James V., in 1530: you have it related in the Ballads.
The 
Armstrongs were the most lawless of all the Border depredators ; 
and all along the Liddell stream may still be seen the ruins of 
their strongholds.
James V., who long lived in Scottish memory as 
the king, who made the rush bush keep the cow, in his endeavours 
to maintain order, undertook an expedition through the Border 
district.
John Armstrong, of Gilnockie, was induced — the ballad 
says, at the invitation of the king himself, 
"The king he writes a luving letter," 
to appear before him.
He came with his followers in all the rude 
pomp of border chivalry.
The Elliotts and Armstrongs did convene — 
They were a gallant company, 
We'll ride and meet our lawful king, 
And bring him safe to Gilnockie.
Make rabbits, and capon, ready then.
And venison in great plentie ; 
We'll welcome here our royal king, 
And bring him safe to Gilnockie.
When Johnnie came before the king, 
Wi' a' his men sae braw to see, 
The king he movit his bonnet to him, 
He weened he was a king as well as he.
This shows the sort of subjects they were in their own and ordinary 
estimation.
But no sooner had Johnnie and his companions 
alighted, than the king ordered the whole party to instant execution.
The ballad recounts the pleas that were put in for mercy, and they 
give us a good idea of the wealth of a Border laird.
First of all 
he offers the king " four and twenty milk white steeds," all foaled 
in the same year ; then — 
u 
" Four and twenty ganging mills, 
That gang thro' a the year to me." 
with good red wheat to fill them ; then, he promises that 
" Four and twenty sisters' sons 
Shall all for thee fight, tho' a' should flee; 
All between here and Newcastle town.
Shall pay their yearly rent to thee.
" 
Nothing apparently touches him more keenly than that the king 
should consider him a traitor or dishonest — 
"Ye lie, ye lie, now king," he says, 
"Altho' a king and a prince ye be ; 
For I've loved nothing in my life, 
I well dare say it — but honestie.
" 
Save, and there are, I regret to say, one or two exceptions to our 
friend's honesty — I suppose to prove the rule — 
Save a fast horse and a fair woman, 
Twa bonny dogs to kill a deir : 
But England should have found me meal and malt, 
If I had lived tliis hundred year.
She should have found me meal and malt, 
And beef, and mutton, in a' plentie ; 
But niver a Scotch wife could have said 
That e'er I skaithed her a puir flee.
Armstrong's notions of honesty were those common among his 
fellow reivers : as we understand it, they blotted it from their 
list of virtues ; and when one remembers that these men lived only 
three hundred years ago, and looks round and finds oneself in an 
era of magistrates' courts, and rural policemen, and sanitary 
authorities, and school boards, one begins to understand what 
progress is, and how slowly, how gradually it is won.
All Arm- 
strong's pleas, however, were made in vain : having exhausted all 
his eloquence, he bitterly exclaims — 
To seek het water beneath cauld ice, 
Surely it is a great folie ; 
I have asked, grace at a graceless face, 
But there is nane to my men and me !
75 
And then he sadly turns to bid a last adieu to his 
Bonny Gilnock hall, 
Where, on Esk side thou standest stout.
Miss Wordsworth, in her " Tour in Scotland " in the early years 
of the present century, tells us that her brother and herself were 
directed by Sir W.
Scott, to look for the stumps of the trees where 
the reivers were hanged, still standing between Hawick and 
Langholm : at all events, you may still see the ruins of his old 
tower J and when you visit it, remember the fate of Armstrong of 
Gilnockie.
Such was a good specimen of the old mosstrooper, and his 
not unusual end; of the men who, during the 14th, 15 th, and i6th 
centuries were the terror and dismay of every peaceable man and 
woman to the north and south of the district in which they lived 
— the men whom Sir Walter has painted in his "Lay of the last 
Minstrel " in William, of Deloraine — 
A stark mosstrooping Scot was he 
As e'er couched Border lance by knee ; 
Through Solway sands, through Tarras moss, 
Bhndfold he knew the paths to cross ; 
By wily turns, by desperate bounds.
Had baffled Percy's best bloodhounds.
In Esk and Liddell fords were none.
But he would ride them one by one ; — 
Alike to him were time or tide, 
December's snow or July's pride ; — 
Alike to him were tide or time.
Moonless midnight, or matin prime : 
Steady of heart and stout of hand 
As e'er drove prey from Cumberland.
Of these men there is little but the memory left, and we cannot 
regret that they belonged to a period that is past and gone — that 
they have left only to their descendants something of their 
steadiness of heart, and something of their stoutness of hand, to be 
used, as we believe, for more useful and more honourable ends.
We have, indeed (and they form one of the most characteristic 
features of our Border scenery) we have many a ruined tower or 
peel, and associated with it 
76 
Some old rude tale that suiteth well 
The ruins wild and hoary — 
the Strongholds into which they retreated with their herds and 
flocks when threatened by attack, and from which they sallied, 
when the larder was empty, to prey upon the flocks and herds of 
their more industrious neighbours.
Perched on some hill, or rising 
ground — on the edge of a precipice or the banks of a torrent, they 
rise with their grey walls usually three stories high.
Into the lowest of 
these, in the hour of danger, the cattle were driven for security ; the 
second and third accommodated the family and its dependants, in a 
fashion that, I fear, would have made the hair of a modern sanitary 
officer stand on end, if any sanitary officer would ever have dared to 
present himself upon his errand.
On the top of the towers hung 
the iron grating, which held the beacon fire, that was used to warn 
against invasion, and to gather the Border clans together, which 
passed on from tower to tower with incredible rapidity the warning 
note.
From these towers they issued, " knowing," Camden says, 
"no measure of law but the length of their sword," whenever 
the dish of spurs was served upon the table, as a signal that the 
larder was empty ; or when, as the mother of one of the Grahams 
said on a like occasion — "Ride, Rowley, the hough's in the pot" — to 
prey upon their southern neighbours with that characteristic regard 
for honesty, which we have already seen animating Armstrong of 
Gilnockie.
It was the way they lived.
In a marriage contract of 
the period between a Scott and Elliott, it is arranged that the father- 
in-law should keep the bride, to receive in return the products of the 
first Michaelmas moon.
You remember, I dare say, the story of Wat 
of Harden, the ancestor of Scott.
On one occasion, when the village 
herd was driving out the cattle to pasture, the old laird heard him call 
loudly to drive out Harden's cow.
" Harden's cow !
" echoed the 
affronted chief, "is it come to that pass?
— by my faith they shall 
soon say Harden's kye!" and, sounding his bugle, summoned his 
followers, and next day returned with a noble herd.
His des- 
cendant made a spirited ballad of the incident, of which I quote 
three stanzas : — 
77 
" Ca' out the kye," quo' the village herd, 
As he stood on the knowe ; 
" Ca' this ane's nine, and that ane's ten.
And bauld Lord William's cow." 
" Ah !
by my sooth !" quoth William then, 
" And stands it that way now !
When knave and churl have nine and ten, 
That the Lord has but his cow ?
" I swear by the light of the Michaelmas moon, 
And the might of Mary high, 
And by the edge of my broad sword brown.
They shall soon say Harden's kye!" 
A good many of their depredations were doubtless committed in 
this district, and as our friends here naturally looked upon the 
matter from a different point of view, we are not surprised to learn 
that many a one must have taken his last look at the blue Border 
hills from this neighbourhood : and whoever may have given to 
the neighbouring city its title of "merrie Carlisle," it could scarcely, 
I think, have been the mosstrooping Scots, whose heads so often 
adorned its gates and walls.
In the Ballads, as in a mirror, the picture of those times 
is painted for us with, as Lockhart says, "their stern deep passions 
— their daring adventures and cruel tragedies — their rude wild 
humour, interrupted by hardly a blot of what deserves to be called 
vulgarity." They are of different characters : some describe 
the great struggles that took place between the rival races, national 
encounters like the famous Hunting of the Cheviot, which ever 
moved Sir Philip Sidney like the sound of a trumpet ; others the 
foray, such as that which Wat of Harden made ; and others again, 
the more homely tender incidents of domestic life.
For wild and 
dangerous as their occupations were — rough and rude as their 
mode of living was — stern and cruel as the incidents of their career 
too often were — yet there was, too, another side to it, a tender, 
pathetic, gentle, softer side, which has also found its appropriate 
echo in Border song.
There on the one hand on the Borders, 
Amid the Cheviot mountain's blue.
Struggling with the mists and blasts and storms of their native hills, 
78 
— an uncongenial climate and a sterile soil — struggling, too, against 
the invasions of the Southron, again and again renewed, some of 
the most prized and valuable characteristics of the sterner side of 
the Scottish character took their rise.
There, at least, in part, was 
nourished and grew strong, the indomitable spirit, the unflinching 
courage, the stern individuality and stubborn independence that, 
at a critical moment in our history, saved England from the 
Stuarts, and, in the face of thumbscrew and of rack, made Scotland 
the most Protestant country in the world.
There was born that 
instinct for self-rule — that sense of political^independence which 
characterize none more than the people of the Border.
And 
these sentiments amongst us these Ballads are calculated to 
maintain.
There was truth in the saying — ' Give me the 
making of a nation's ballads, and you may make its laws," and 
certainly, if ever there should again arise amongst us a condition 
of affairs, that threatened the liberties of this country, in no 
way would the instinct for freedom and independence be more 
likely to be awakened than by the memories that our Ballads 
would recall.
They breathe the very air of freedom, and are 
instinct with the spirit of independence.
But in them too, as I 
said, on the other hand, is also found that vein of tender and 
pathetic sentiment, that note of sweetness and sadness, which 
lingers round the Border hills and streams, making sacred the very 
names of Yarrow, and Annan, and Kirtle, and Liddell, and has 
stirred, and purified, and inspired the heart of many a dweller in 
the district.
Wan water, says one of them — 
Wan water, from the Border hills, 
Dear voice from the old years, 
Thy distant music lulls and stills, 
And moves to quiet tears.
We cannot unlock the charm : we cannot, we do not wish to 
analyze it, but we know that it is there — we know that 
Here was poetic impulse given, 
J3y the green hills and clear blue heaven.
79 
You remember, I dare say, how Wordsworth, in his poem of 
Yarrow Unvisited, asks contemptuously — 
What's Yarrow, but a river bare, 
That ghdes the dark hills under ?
There are a thousand such elsewhere, 
As worthy of our wonder.
and yet how, in after years, when visiting the scene, he was compelled 
to confess there was something he had not found elsewhere — 
something the memor)' of which he would fain keep with him— 
To dwell with me, to heighten joy, 
And cheer my mind in sorrow.
And so with the whole district.
There is a nameless charm about 
it.
It is this which has made it 
Meet nurse for a poetic child ; 
and to have given birth to Scott and Burns, and fed their youthful 
fancies, is alone a distinction such as no other district in the world 
can claim.
How entirely this was the case with Scott we know ; 
and how of their yearly rambles in Liddesdale Mr. Shortreed, his 
companion, said : " He was making himself all the time, and didn't 
know till years had passed, perhaps." And while from these 
Border scenes he thus drew in his inspiration, he poured over 
them in return, with all the power of genius, a flood of interest 
which will never die — which has made these old memories the 
possession, not of a district, but of the world.
But I must illustrate this pathetic side of the old Ballads, 
springing, as it does, from the sadness of the past history of the 
district, linking every object in Nature with some tale of sorrow, 
by one or two examples.
Where could you find painted a more 
touching picture of sorrow and lonely mourning than in the lament 
of the widow of one of the old rievers, William Cokeburne, who 
had been executed before the gate of his own tower, near S.
Mary's 
Loch, by James IV.
or V.
I dare say you know it — 
I sewed his sheet, making my mane, 
I watched the corpse myself alane ; 
I watched his body night and day, 
No living creature came that way.
80 
I took his body on my back, 
And whiles I gaed, and whiles I sate : 
I digg'd a grave and laid him in, 
And happ'd him in the sod sae green.
But think ye nae my heart was sair, 
When I laid the moul on his yellow hair !
O think ye nae my heart was wae.
When I turned about away to gae !
Nae living man I'll love again.
Since that my lovely knight is slain !
Wi' a lock of his yellow hair 
I'll bind my heart for ever mair !
Or if you wanted another instance of the passionate devotion with 
which love can cling to its departed object, you have one surely 
in the well-known ballad of the "Dowie Dens o' Yarrow" — in 
which a lady finds the body of her lover, Walter Scott, who has 
been surprised in the glen and foully murdered by his enemies — 
She kissed his cheek — she kaimed his hair.
She washed his wounds all thorough ; 
She kissed him till her cheeks were red, 
On the dowie houms of Yarrow.
Her father comes to her — 
"Now haud your tongue, my daughter dear, 
For a' this bauds but sorrow ; 
I'll wed ye to a better lord 
Than him ye lost on Yarrow." 
" O haud your tongue, my father dear, 
Ye mind me but of sorrow : 
A fairer rose did never bloom, 
Than now lies cropped on Yarrow." 
Whether the lady always remained in the same mind the story 
does not relate.
In another beautiful ballad again, we have a tale 
of the high courage with which true love can fill a woman's soul.
The ballad is called "The Gay Goss Hawk." You will find it in 
Scott's collection.
A knight in the north loves a lady in the south 
countrie — perhaps here in Cumberland — but, unfortunately, the 
course of their love does not run smooth, and he is not allowed to 
see her.
He accordingly sends his hawk with a letter "under its 
81 
pinions gray," and bids it carry it to his sweetheart in the south, 
to whom the bird is thus directed — 
O well shall ye my true love ken, 
As soon as her ye see, 
For of a' the flowers of fair England, 
The fairest flower is she.
The red that's on my true love's cheek 
Is like blood-drops on the snaw.
The white that is on her breast bare, 
Like the down of the white sea-maw.
And ever at my love's bower door, 
There gjrows a flowering birk.
And ye maun sit and sing thereon.
As she gangs to the kirk.
The bird goes on its errand — 
And first he sings a low, low note, 
And syne he sang a clear.
And aye the o'erword of the song 
Was — your love can no win here.
The lady listens and understands, I need hardly say — I fear her 
thoughts wandered a little during the service — but, unfortunately, 
she has a step-mother, who by no means gives her the encourage- 
ment she would have liked.
She adopts a stratagem to deceive 
her.
She drinks a sleeping potion, and lies apparently dead, 
having first obtained a promise from her father that if she dies she 
shall be buried in the north countrie, and allowed to be laid out 
the night before the burial in S.
Mary's Kirk.
Her step-mother, 
however, suspects her, and subjects her to a rigid test — 
Then spake her cruel step-mother, 
"Take ye the burning lead, 
And drap a drap on her bosom, 
To see if she be dead." 
They took a drap of boiling lead.
And drapp'd it on her breast ; 
" Alas !
alas !" her father cried, 
" She's dead without a priest !" 
7 
82 
She neither chattered with her teeth, 
Nor shiveied with her chin, 
"Alas !
alas !" her father cried, 
" There is nae breath within !" 
And so they carry her away to her distant tomb, and she is laid 
for the night in the church of S.
Mary, according to her father's 
promise, and all is ready for the burial of the fair but unhappy 
young stranger from the distant southern land, when suddenly her 
lover appears upon the scene, and at his touch — 
She brightened like the lily flower, 
Till her pale colours gone, 
With rosy cheek and ruby lip, 
She smiles her love upon.
I hope there are ladies in the nineteenth century — though I don't 
think their courage will be put to as severe a test — as true, as 
constant, and of as high a spirit ; as we hope, or else these ladies 
would be thrown away, that there are lovers as constant as he who 
mourned for Helen of Kirkconnell upon the braes of Kirtle — 
Oh, Helen, fair beyond compare, 
I'll make a garland of thy hair.
Shall bind my heart for ever mair, 
Until the day I die.
The period and the people that gave birth to songs and ballads 
like these, were full, we are sure, of sad and pathetic incidents 
enough.
There were partings, often for ever, from mothers, and 
wives, and sisters, and children — and sad waitings and watchings 
for the loved ones that would never return again — sorrowings like 
those after the fatal field of Flodden, so strikingly described in the 
verses of the famous, though modern, ballad written by a lady of 
an old Border family — "The Flowers of the Forest." 
Dool and wae for the order sent our lads to the Border, — 
The English for once by guile wan the day ; 
The Flowers of the Forest that fought aye the foremost.
The prime of the land are cold in the clay.
We'll hear na mair lilting at the ewes milking — 
Women and bairns are heartless and wae !
Sighing and moaning in ilka green loaning, 
The Flowers of the Forest are a' wide away.
83 
One of the latest and most stirring deeds in the tale of this 
Border History, and one, too, so immediately connected with this 
district, that I ought not to omit it, is that related in the ballad 
of Kinmont Willie, an incident that took place in the close of the 
1 6th century, in the days of Queen Elizabeth.
William Armstrong, 
of Kinmont — said to be a descendant of our friend of Gilnockie — 
was a noted Border chieftain, and not with the best of reputations.
A pamphleteer of the day arguing against subscribing the oath of 
supremacy, in 1584, asks ironically, "Who shall take order with 
vice and wickedness?
The court and bishops?
As well ask 
MaJtin Elliot and Will of Kinmont to take order with stealing 
upon the Borders!" This Will of Kinmont had been seized by 
Mr. Sakeld — " the fause Sakelde," as the ballad styles him — the 
deputy of Lord Scrope, who was then the Warden of the Marshes — 
at a meeting which had been held, as usual, for the purpose of 
settling mutual disputes, on the banks of the river Liddell, near 
the Kershope Foot.
He was carried off in spite of all remonstrance 
as to the illegality of the seizure, and lodged in the castle of 
Carlisle, where no doubt he would soon have been "justified," to 
use the term that was in vogue on the other side of the Border — 
i.e. hanged first and tried after — a sort of justification which has 
perhaps escaped the notice of our theologians.
The news was 
carried to Buccleugh, who was vested with the office of Warden on 
the Scottish side.
He was vastly indignant.
And have they ta'en him, Kinmount Willie, 
Against the truce of Border tide, 
And forgotten that the bold Buccleugh 
Is keeper here on the Scottish side ?
He accordingly assembles his followers an hour before the sunset, 
at the rendezvous of the Woodhouselee, "carrying ladders long 
and hie," and leads them straight to Carlisle town — 
Then on we held to Carlisle town, 
At Staneshaw bank the Eden we crossed ; 
The water was great and mickle of spait, 
But never a man or a horse we lost.
The dark and stormy night — the ascent of the Castle wall 
84 
under cover of the darkness, from the side of "the Sacray, a plaine 
place under the towne and castell" — the breaking of the prison 
bars, and the confusion of the garrison numbering looo men — the 
release of the astonished prisoner on the very eve of his execution, 
carried in his irons shoulder-high on the back of one of the band 
— the alarm that followed — the tolling of the city bells and the 
beating of the drums — and the recrossing of the flooded Eden in 
the grey dawn of an autumn morning — all these are graphically 
touched, and make a striking picture.
Buccleugh has turned to Eden waters, 
E'en where it flowed from bank to brim ; 
And he has plunged in wi' a' his band 
And safely swam them through the stream.
Lord Scrope, in amazement, standing on the bank exclaims — 
He is either himsel' a devil from hell, 
Or else his mother a witch maun be : 
I wouldna hae ridden that wan water 
For a' the gowd in Christantie.
We may imagine the glee of the little party when they reached 
their own neighbourhood again, passing through Longtown at the 
break of day, and the stir the incident would cause.
Queen 
Elizabeth was deeply incensed at the conduct of Buccleugh, and 
not very easily pacified.
Some time after, when he was presented 
to her, she demanded of him how he dared undertake an enterprise 
so desperate and presumptuous.
"What is it," he replied, "that 
a man dares not do?" "With ten thousand such men," said the 
Queen, " our brother of Scotland could shake the firmest throne 
in Europe !" She little thought that ere half a century had passed, 
the crown the Scotchmen would shake, would be her own, in the 
hands of her successors.
Some years later the Queen died, and James VI.
of Scotland, 
succeeding to the throne, made the two countries one.
Renewed 
efforts were made to pacify the Border.
You remember the remark 
of Tames when a favourite cow he had taken with him to London 
found its way back to Fife : nothing, he said, surprised him so 
much as its being able to pass without interruption through the 
85 
Debateable Land.
He exerted himself, accordingly, to introduce 
greater security of life and property.
We are told how the Border 
churches, many, no doubt, in ruins and decay, were restored.
Stringent laws were enacted, and officers appointed for the settling 
of disputes.
The use of horses and arms, save to those unsuspected 
of felony and theft, was interdicted.
Trained bloodhounds 
were to be kept in the various Border parishes, for the pursuit 
of depredators; and when arrested, "Jeddart Justice," — a 
phrase which comes to us from the period — was the order of 
the day.
No one was more active in putting in force the law 
against the mosstroopers than Lord William Howard, or 
Belted Will.
He seems to have been a student, as [well as, 
or perhaps more than a soldier.
On one occasion when he was 
occupied with an interesting book, a prisoner was brought in : he 
was asked what was to be done with him.
"Hang him !" was the 
reply.
Shortly after, he asked that he should be brought in for 
examination, and found his hasty order had been carried out.
The story is told in Hutchinson, but accords rather with the 
character that popular tradition has assigned to "Bauld Willie," than 
that, which more recent inquiries have shown to be the true one.
Some famiUes proved so troublesome, that nothing short of exter- 
mination promised success.
They were to be stamped out.
Among these we find the Grahams, who seem to have made 
themselves unusually notorious, and to have been regarded as 
pests for whom there was no cure but one — exportation.
A con- 
siderable number of them were accordingly transported to Ireland, 
along with some other famiUes, "because," the king's order runs, 
" they do all, but especially the Grames, confess themselves to be 
no meet persons to live in these countries, and also to the intent 
their lands may be inhabited by others of good and honest conver- 
sation." Let us be glad that a few "very respectable" families of 
the name were found worthy to remain to reckon among their 
posterity your own neighbour, one of the crowning glories of 
Cumberland — the great statesman who was at his death the 
member for Carlisle.
The Bill for the exportation of the Grahams 
was paid by a tax levied on the different parishes — a.
tax to which.
86 
I see my own parish contributed i gs.
^d.
But in spite of efforts 
again and again renewed, a century elapsed before there was 
anything of real peace and quiet on the Borders.
On every 
opportunity the old spirit broke forth.
Thus at the Restoration of 
Charles II., in 1662, we are told the Scots and mosstroopers have 
again revived their old custom of robbing and murdering the 
English, and often had the inhabitants need to say, with the old 
ballad, 
Lord, send us peace into this realm, 
That every man may live on his ovirn.
It was only by slow degrees that the old roving habits were 
replaced by a more civiHzed and peaceable condition of affairs, 
and far down into the i8th century we find the traces of the 
predatory mode of life that had so long prevailed.
Nicolson, 
writing towards the close of it, finds the last trace in the custom of 
a man and woman stealing away each other — a pleasant form of 
larceny — amid the hot pursuit of friends, and getting married by 
the forger of iron links, whose temple was at Gretna Green : and 
even this species of larceny has now been put down by the hand 
of the law.
I have thus endeavoured, most imperfectly, I know, to trace 
some of the scenes that are connected with the Borders, and to say 
something of the Ballads in which their later history is enshrined.
I have brought you through a period when here 
From age to age 
Contending nations strove with mutual rage, 
to a day when we loiter through the district for a summer holiday, 
and all around see signs that now 
Here guardian peace — here smiling culture reigns, 
And endless Plenty clothes the fertile plains.
Such has been the result of Progress on the Borders.
Mr. Ruskin 
remarks somewhere that the scenery most fruitful of literary 
intellect is not the absolutely mountainous nor the perfectly flat : 
it is the mixture of hill and vale, where there is demand at once 
for man's energy and man's endurance, and yet room also for ideas 
87 
of rest and repose.
This, no doubt, in conjunction with the 
stirring events of ,\vhich, by its position, it has been the scene — 
and Mr. Ruskin adds, the peculiar beauty of the sound of the 
Scottish streamlets, unmatched, he says, for the mystery and 
sweetness of their murmurs, and whispers, and low fall — is the 
reason why, in this limited Border district, there has been produced 
such a rich crop of poetic fancies, as are to be found in these 
famous ballads.
They are beautiful in themselves; but how much 
more may we prize them, when we remember that to them and to 
the district which produced them, we owe the inspiration that 
kindled the genius of Scott; that there is hardly a scene, an 
incident, or a character in all his poems and romances of which the 
first suggestion may not be traced to some old verse in the Border 
Minstrelsy, or some locality in the district.
We know how, to his 
latest days, he remembered the spot, where first, as a child, he read 
Percy's Reliqiics of Ancient Poetry'' — the first collection of Ballads 
given to the world — how he scraped together, he says, a few 
shillings and bought a copy of the beloved volumes — "nor do I 
believe," he adds, " I ever read a book half so frequently or with 
half the enthusiasm." And we know, too, how in later days, in 
every incident of Hfe, the old lines sprang unbidden to his memory 
to describe his feelings and emotions, and the joy with which, in 
the closing scene of all, he returned to his loved district, wishing 
that he might, like his own Minstrel in his latest hours, 
Still feel the breeze down Etterick break.
And here too, no less, amid these hills and dales, was fed and 
grew strong the spirit of Burns ; here was reared the hardy 
peasantry from whom he sprang, and to the homeliest incidents 
of whose lives — their Saturday nights — their merrymakings and 
their sorrows — he has given an immortality such as genius alone 
can give, which will be green as long as the world endures.
To 
Scott and Burns we might easily add many another name.
Here 
Hogg, the Ettrick Shepherd, and Allan Ramsay, and Leyden, and 
Cunningham, gathered the inspiration for the songs that have 
* Dr. Percy was at one time Dean of Carlisle.
88 
made their names a household word.
All these we owe to the 
Border and its Ballads — to those old songs which have been given 
to us direct from a people's heart— and to the long and weary 
strifes and struggles in the district, to which that heart belonged.
Is 
there any other locality that can boast of a more valuable, a more 
characteristic gift to literature?
And amid the conventionalism and 
sickly sentimentality of much that is written in this 19th century; amid 
artificial poetry and sensational novels, we may still turn with 
refreshment to the quaint simplicity and native vigour of our old 
Minstrelsy, and find there something to stir, without corrupting, our 
imagination, something to ennoble the character, and to help to 
raise a race of Borderers as stout of hand and as strong of heart as 
those who have gone before us — ^just as amid the breezy hills and 
dales and streams from which it sprang, we may gather fresh 
strength and new vigour for the work of life.

THE BARONY OF KENDAL AND MANOR OF

THE FEUDAL SYSTEM.
In years long ago, before that conquering (or, as some will 
have it, plundering) hero came over from Normandy and landed 
at Pevensey Bay, in that year of our Lord which is so well known 
now, in these our days of School Boards and Government 
Inspectors, Englishmen knew little or nothing of the feudal 
laws ; but with, or rather by the Conqueror, they were introduced 
into this kingdom in all their completeness and power.
On 
taking a view of the feudal system, the first thing that attracts 
our attention is the king, held to be the sole proprietor of all 
the lands within his dominions : from whom all subjects derived 
their possessions, and, in return, consecrated even their lives to his 
service.
There he sat enthroned, the source and fountain, as it 
were, of honour : from whom all marks of distinction and titles of 
dignity flowed — at his footstool the most powerful peers, on bended 
knees and with folded hands, did homage and swore fealty to him 
as their sovereign and liege lord.
A feudal kingdom was, in its 
origin, altogether military, and may be likened to the encampment 
of a great army, the possession of the land being the pay the 
90 
soldiers received for personal service.
To the king, or general, 
part of the conquered lands were allotted ; while the remainder, 
under the names of beneficia or fiefs, was divided among his 
principal officers.
As the common safety required that these 
officers should, upon all occasions, be ready to appear in arms for 
the common defence, and should continue obedient to the general 
or king, they bound themselves to take the field when called upon 
to do so, and to serve him with a number of men or vassals, in 
proportion to the extent of their territory.
This was the origin of 
baronies.
These great officers again parcelled out their lands 
among their followers, and annexed the same or somewhat similar 
conditions, to the grants they made.
This was the origin of 
manors.
Large baronies often consisted of various manors, and 
this is especially apparent in the Barony of Kendal and Lordship 
or Liberty of Furness, which respectively comprised many manors.
The lords of the manors subgranted or let the same in parcels of 
various extent to their tenants or vassals, either for military or more 
menial services, or at certain rents.
When the Crown, at first 
elective, became hereditary, the fiefs or baronies, at first granted 
during pleasure, also descended from father and son, and so became 
perpetual ; and, by a natural consequence, more and more powerful 
became the barons, and so in proportion the authority of the 
king became more limited.
In the same manner the tenants of 
the various manors gradually acquired a right to hold their lands 
in perpetuity instead of only so long as it pleased their lord.
The king's demesne, or the portion of land which he retained 
in his own hands, was that from which he drew subsistence for his 
court, and revenue for the ordinary expenses of his government : 
whereas the taxes payable by a vassal were originally only three — 
one when his eldest son was made a knight, another when his 
eldest daughter was married, and the third to ransom him when 
made a prisoner.
There were also some other waifs and strays 
which came to his exchequer in the shape of wardships, marriages, 
&c., of his own vassals.
When very hard up, his subjects perhaps 
granted him what was called a '-'benevolence," something like a 
parent paying the gambling debts or tailor's bills of his son, and so 
91 
giving him a fresh start in the world of credit.
A feudal king was 
not, therefore, by any means, a rich or independent man ; and, as 
for mercenary troops, he had none, but was dependent upon the 
vassals and sub-vassals of the barons for his army.
Forty days 
was the extent of service which could be demanded at any one 
time ; and the more warlike a people were the more independent 
they became ; for, being both soldiers and subjects, civil privileges 
and immunities were the consequences of their victories and the 
rewards of their exploits.
The barons thus, as I said before, 
gradually became more and more powerful ; and though at first 
kings appear to have been the supreme judges of the people, and 
heard in person all causes and controversies, the nobles gradually 
were entrusted with the administration of justice within their 
baronies, probably, it is thought, at first only temporary grants on 
account of the number of suits increasing, but ultimately converted 
into rights which became hereditary.
Here we have, I think, the 
origin not only of Courts Baron, but also of Courts Leet, where 
justice was dispensed in all cases, civil and criminal, by the baron 
or judges appointed by him.
Almost every question in which a 
person residing on the lands of a noble was interested was decided 
by the noble himself, or by judges appointed by him.
I shall 
have subsequently to elaborate somewhat upon what I have said 
concerning the feudal king and his vassals, when I come to treat of 
the different tenures and customs, and therefore will now proceed 
to give a short history of the manors I have ventured to make the 
subject of this paper.
THE BARONS OF KENDAL.
The Barony of Kendal was originally a very extensive one.
It comprised the whole of the Kendal and Lonsdale Wards in the 
County of Westmorland, and some parts of the neighbouring 
County of Lancaster.
It was given by William the Conqueror to 
Ivo de Tailbois, brother to the Earl of Anjou, who married Elgiva, 
daughter of the Saxon King Ethelred.
From him the barony 
descended by regular and direct succession to William de Tailbois, 
the fifth baron, who was Governor of Lancaster Castle, from which 
92 
circumstance he took the surname of "Lancaster" instead of 
Tailbois, in the reign of Henry I.
This William de Tailbois had 
issue William de Lancaster IL, who appears to have been a some- 
what pugnacious individual, for he gave thirty marks to King 
Henry II.
for permission to fight a duel with Gospatric, the son of 
Orme, some relation of his.
I don't know what the result of the 
duel was, but am pretty certain that they would come to closer 
quarters than thirty-five paces, the distance Frenchmen appear to 
think near enough now-a-days to exchange shots and satisfy 
honour, even on a foggy morning in November.
This William de 
Lancaster II.
left one daughter, Helwise, who married Gilbert, son 
of Roger Fitz-Reinfred, to whom Richard I., in 1189, granted the 
Forest of Westmorland, Kendal, and Furness, together with a 
weekly market on Saturdays at Kendal.
This William de 
Lancaster was also, to his credit be it said, one of those bold barons 
who opposed King John.
Gilbert Fitz-Reinfred died in 12 19, 
leaving one son and three daughters.
His son William, who also 
took the name of Lancaster, married Agnes de Brus, but, dying 
without issue, the barony descended to his two surviving sisters, 
Helwise and Alice, the former of whom got as her share that 
portion of it which is now comprised in the Marquis and Lumley 
Fees, and the latter what is now called the Richmond Fee. Helwise 
married Peter de Brus, and had one son, Peter, and four daughters.
This son Peter de Brus at his mother's death succeeded to one 
half of the barony, now comprised in the Marquis and Lumley 
Fees; and on his death, in 1278, his estates passed to his four 
sisters, Margaret, Agnes, Lucy, and Laderina.
Margaret married 
Robert de Ross or Roos, and had as her share Kendal Castle, and 
all that belonged to her deceased brother, in demesnes, villages, 
rents, and services of freemen or others, except the vill of Kent- 
mere, which was assigned to Laderina.
Agnes took no share of 
the Westmorland estates, but Lucy, the third sister, got what is 
now called the Lumley Fee, and which comprised the Manors of 
Helsington, Crosthwaite, and Lyth, and a fourth-part of the town 
of Kendal, with the turbary of Sampool.
Robert and Margaret de Ross or Roos left heirs, and this 
93 
portion of the barony descended in direct succession through two 
or three generations of De Rooses to (in 1390) an infant daughter 
of John de Roos, who afterwards became the wife of Sir William 
de Parr, from whom it descended to Sir Thomas Parr, Master of 
the Wards and Comptroller to King Henry VIII.
I need hardly tell you that Catherine, the eldest daughter of 
this Sir William de Parr, after being first married to Edward 
Borough, or Burgh, secondly to John Neville, Lord Latimer, 
became, on her third matrimonial venture, the sixth wife of Bluff 
King Hal, and having seen him quietly disposed of, married for 
her fourth husband Thomas Lord Seymour, of Dudley.
Besides 
Catherine and her sister Anne, Sir Thomas Parr had a son, William 
Parr, who was created Lord Parr and Ross of Kendal, in 1538, 
and in 1547 Marquis of Northampton, upon his receiving which 
latter title the portion of the Barony of Kendal belonging to him 
acquired the name or title of the " Marquis Fee," and retains it to 
the present day.
This William Parr, Marquis of Northampton, 
died in 1570 without issue, in consequence of which the Fee 
reverted to the Crown, then held by Queen Elizabeth.
Turning to the other portion of the barony, which fell to 
the lot of Helwise's sister Alice, on the death of her brother 
William de Lancaster, son of Gilbert de Reinfred, AHce married 
William de Lindesay, and they had a son, Walter, from whom the 
Fee descended in direct succession to his great granddaughter 
Christian de Lindesay, who married Ingelram de Guienes, Lord de 
Courcy, in France.
Their eldest son, William, was born in 
France, and, according to the law of those times, could not inherit 
land in England ; and as their second son, Ingelram, born in 
England, died without issue, the estate escheated to the Crown.
William, who, as I said before, was born in France, had two sons, 
Ingelram the eldest, and William the youngest ; and the then 
King of England (Edward III.) gave the fee to William, the 
youngest son ; but he, William, also died without issue, and the 
Fee again escheated to the Crown.
King Edward III.
then 
granted it for life to John de Coupland, of Coupland, in North- 
umberland, and Joan his wife, during their lives.
This John de 
94 
Coupland was the valiant De Coupland who in the battle with the 
Scots at Neville's Cross, near Durham, when assailed by David IL, 
King of Scotland, with blows repeated until he even dashed his 
teeth out, in the hope of either provoking him to slay or be 
slain by him, forbore to retaliate, and obliged the king to live and 
become his prisoner.
For this deed King Edward rewarded 
Coupland with a pension of ;!^5oo a year (a large sum in those 
days) until he could give him an equivalent in land ; and seeing 
that the battle was fought in the year 1346, and the grant of the 
barony was made in 1347, it may, I think, fairly be assumed that 
such grant was made in return for the above services.
The last 
William had, as before stated, an elder brother Ingelram, and this 
Ingelram had a son of the same name, Lord of Courcy in France, 
who married Isabel, daughter of Edward III., and to him the king 
granted the reversion of the English estates, after the death of John 
de Coupland and Joan his wife and the heirs of his body, except 
the reversion of a moiety of the Manor of Ulverston, which he gave 
to Furness Abbey.
This Ingelram de Courcy had one daughter, 
Philippa, who married Robert de Vere, Earl of Oxford, from whom, 
in the reign of Richard II., she was divorced for what in those 
days I presume was considered a sufficient reason, namely, the 
want of children.
She died in 141 1, and the Fee again reverted 
to the Crown for want of heirs.
Henry IV.
next granted it to 
John, Duke of Bedford; and Henry VI., in 1443, granted it to 
John de Beauford, Duke of Somerset, and his heirs male.
This 
John, Duke of Somerset, was grandson of John of Gaunt, Duke of 
Lancaster, and son of Edward III.
He died the same year the 
grant was made to him, without leaving issue male, and the estate 
consequently again reverted to the Crown ; whereupon the king 
granted it by letters patent to Margaret, a daughter and heiress of 
the said Duke, and widow of the Earl of Richmond, under the 
title of Countess of Richmond, though at the time she was the 
wife of Henry Stafford, son of Humphrey, the then the Duke of 
Buckingham.
In consequence of this grant to the Countess of 
Richmond, this portion of the barony received the name of the 
Richmond Fee, which it retains to the present day.
95 
I have now traced the two Fees from their origin to the 
respective persons from whom they received their distinctive 
names, namely, the Marquis Fee from the Marquis of Northampton 
in the reigns of Henry VIII.
and Queen Mary ; and the Richmond 
Fee from the Countess of Richmond in the reign of Henry VI.
Margaret, Countess of Richmond, was mother of Henry VII., and 
on her death the Richmond Fee came to him as her heir-at-law, 
and consequently again became the property of the Crown.
Henry VIII.
granted it to his natural son, the Duke of Richmond 
and Somerset, on whose death without issue it again reverted to 
the Crown.
The Marquis Fee, as I have told you before, came 
into the hands of the Crown not long afterwards, and both Fees 
subsequently appear to have usually passed together by temporary 
grants to different persons, until after the death of Catherine, 
Queen of Charles IL, when they were leased to a member of the 
Lowther family, in which family they have remained ever since, 
and now through purchase by one of the late lords, belong to the 
present Lord Lonsdale in fee.
RENTS OF THE MARQUIS FEE.
In 1596 a rental of the Marquis and Richmond Fees was 
made for Queen Elizabeth, when it was ascertained that the yearly 
rents of the Marquis Fee consisted of —

From this it will be seen that in Grasmere and Langdale there are 
lands held of both the Marquis and Richmond Fees, and this 
accounts for a discovery which a brother chip of mine mentioned 
to me the other day as having somewhat surprised him, namely, 
that in examining some deeds, he found there is land in Easdale, 
Grasmere, held of the Marquis Fee. I must now direct your 
attention to 
THE MANOR OF HAWKSHEAD.
The first settled population of High and Low Furness appear 
to have been Anglo-Saxons.
In the Doomsday Book, High 
Furness is called Hougun ; and, when this survey was made, the 
lordship or liberty of Furness was in the hands of the Crown, 
Roger de Poictou, to whom it was given not long after the 
Conquest, having forfeited it by reason of some treasonable or 
disloyal act.
It was subsequently granted to Stephen, Earl of 
Boulogne, and afterwards King of England, by whom it (with the 
exception of the lands of Michael le Fleming) was given and 
granted for the purpose of founding the Monastery of Furness.
The charter by which this grant was made is dated in the year 
97 
1 127, and the following is a translation: — "In the name of the 
Blessed Trinity, in honour of St. Mary of Furness, I, Stephen, Earl 
of Boulogne and Moreton, consulting God and providing for the 
safety of my own soul, and the soul of my wife, the Countess 
Matilda, the soul of my lord and uncle Henry, King of England 
and Duke of Normandy, and for the souls of all the faithful, Uving 
as well as dead, in the year of our Lord 1127 of the Roman 
Indiction, and the 5th and i8th of the Epact, considering every 
day the uncertainty of life, that the roses and flowers of Kings, 
Emperors, and Dukes, and the crowns and palms of all the great 
wither and decay, and that all things with an uninterrupted course 
tend to dissolution and death : I therefore return, give, and grant 
to God and St. Mary of Furness, all Furness and Walney, with the 
privilege of hunting, with Dalton, and all my lordships of Furness, 
with the men and everything thereto belonging that is in woods 
and open grounds, in land and in water, and Ulverston, and Roger 
Braithwaite, with all that belongs to him, my fisheries at Lancaster 
and Little Gaoring and all land thereof; with sac and soc, toll and 
theam, infangtheof and everything within Furness, except the lands 
of Michael le Fleming, with this view and upon this condition : — 
That in Furness an order of regular monks be by divine permission 
established." Sac and soc was the privilege enjoyed by the lord of 
a manor of holding courts, trying causes.
Theam was the power 
of having servants and slaves.
Lifangtheof was the right to judge 
any thief taken within the lordship.
It was not long after this 
grant was made that a question arose between the monks and 
William de Lancaster, the fifth Baron of Kendal and first of 
Lancaster, as to the boundary between Furness Fells and the 
Barony of Kendal, which is stated to have been referred to thirty 
sworn men.
The agreement come to by them was confirmed by 
the king, and, with the charter of ratification, is still extant.
By 
it the boundary is declared to be " by the Waterfall from Wringe- 
hills (or Wrynose Hill) in Little Langdale, and from thence into 
Eller or Helterwater, and from thence to Braza or Brathey, and 
where the said waters run into Windermere or Winendermere, and 
so down the said mere to Leven sands to the sea." For something 
9 
98 
like four hundred years the monastery of Furness flourished.
The 
Abbots, as may be concluded from the original charter, were 
temporal as well as spiritual princes, ruling, with an almost absolute 
sway, over their vassals and large domains.
But with the reign of 
Henry VIII, a great change came, as you all know, and on April 
9th, 1537, Furness Abbey, with all its estates, was surrendered to 
the King.
They remained in the hands of the Crown until 1662, 
when the manor of Hawkshead, with other manors belonging to 
the lordship of Furness, was granted by Charles II.
to the Duke 
of Albemarle and his heirs.
By marriage it came to the family 
of the Montagues, from whom it has descended to the Duke of 
Buccleuch, the present lord.
I must now beg your attention to 
the question of 
TENURES.
From what I have before said, you will have gathered that 
there arose out of feudalism the maxim that all lands in the 
kingdom were originally granted by the kings, and held immediately 
or mediately of them, as lords paramount, in consideration of 
certain services to be rendered by the holder.
Those who held 
immediately of the king were called tenants in capite, (or in chief,) 
which was the most honourable tenure.
These tenants granted 
portions to inferior persons, who were called lords with regard to 
inferior holders, who were styled "tenants paravail," because they 
were supposed to make avail, or profit, of the land.
In fact they 
were the tenant farmers.
The lands were called either "feuds 
proper," which were purely military, or "improper," such as those 
which were sold for an equivalent, or granted free, or in consider- 
ation of any certain service.
The two great divisions or distinctions 
of property were those of frank tenements, or freehold, and 
villenage.
FREEHOLD.
Frank tenements were those which were held by knight's 
service or free soccage.
Knight's service was, as may be supposed, 
considered the most honourable, and was rendered in return for a 
99 
grant of a quantity of land called a knight's fee, which in extent 
was twelve plough lands, or as much as could be reasonably 
ploughed in one year by twelve ploughs.
By some it was said to 
be eight hundred acres, and by others six hundred and eighty.
Its 
value in those days was about ;!{^2o per annum ; and the fee was 
granted by solemn and public delivery of the land itself by the 
lord to the vassal, and perfected by homage and fealty.
Now, I 
dare say some of you would like to know in what homage and 
fealty consisted.
Lord Lyttleton tells us that homage is the most 
honourable service of reverence that a frank tenant may do to his 
lord, and this is how he described homage to have been done by 
a man : " He should be ungirt and his head uncovered, and his 
lord shall sit and the tenant shall kneel before him on both his 
knees, and hold his hands jointly together between the hands of 
his lord and say thus: — 'I become your man from this day forth, of 
life and limb and earthly worship, and unto you shall be true and 
faithful, and bear to you faith for the tenements that I claim to hold 
of you, saving the faith that I owe to our sovereign lord the king,' 
and then the lord so sitting shall kiss him." But in the case of a 
lady doing homage, she only said : — " I do you homage, and to 
you shall be faithful and true, and faith to you shall bear for 
the tenements I hold of you, saving the faith I owe to our 
sovereign lord the king." But here no kiss was administered.
When a freeholder did fealty, he held his hand upon the book 
and said, " Know ye this, my lord, that I shall be faithful and 
true to you, and that I shall lawfully do to you the customs 
and services which I ought to do at the times assigned, so 
help me God and his saints," and he then kissed the book ; but 
he did not kneel.
There was also this great difference between 
homage and fealty, homage could not be done to any but to the 
lord himself, but the steward or bailiff could take fealty for the 
lord.
Other services were afterwards added by the lord very 
similar to those which they in their turn had to render to the king.
The first were aids, three in number : — To ransom the lord's 
person if taken prisoner; to make his eldest son a knight, 
100 
attended with great pomp and expenses, when fifteen years of 
age ; and to marry the eldest daughter by giving her a portion.
The second service was relief, a fine payable by the heir to 
the lord.
Third.
Primer seisin, or the lord's right to a year's profits from 
the heir, if of age.
Fourth.
Wardship, or the right of the lord to the custody of 
the heir during minority, without having to account for the profits, 
and subject only to the infant's bare maintenance.
Fifth.
Fines or sums payable to the lord on the sale of 
property.
Sixth, Escheat, which was a species of reversion : for, if the 
tenant died without heirs of his blood, or if he had committed 
treason or felony, the mutual bond between the lord and such 
tenant was dissolved ; and, the tenure being determined, the land 
resulted back to the lord who gave it.
Grand-serjeanty was another species of frank-tenure, by which 
the tenant was bound, instead of serving the king generally in the 
wars, to do him some special, certain, and honorary service.
Cornage was a species of grand-serjeanty, the service of which was 
to sound a horn when the Scots or other enemies came over the 
Border.
All these military tenures were abolished by Statute of 12 
Charles II., and turned into free or common socage, derived from 
the Latin soca^ meaning plough service, and now commonly called 
freehold.
But by this Act the tenures in frankalmoign, copyhold, 
customary freehold, and the honorary services (without the slavish 
part) of grand-serjeanty are preserved.
And this brings us to the 
second of the two great classes into which lay tenements were 
divided, viz : — 
VILLENAGE.
And I must beg you to understand, however distasteful it may 
be, that copyholds and customary freeholds were of this tenure.
Yes, landed proprietors here were formerly all villeins of greater or 
less magnitude.
Now villenage was divided into pure villenage 
and privileged villenage.
Pure villenage was the origin of our 
101 
copyhold tenures, or tenure by copy of court roll ; whereas 
privileged villenage, sometimes called "villein socage," was a 
higher species of copyhold, held according to custom, and not 
according to the mere will of the lord.
To this latter tenure 
(villein socage) the lands of the manors we are interested in belong.
In a manor the lord kept so much of the land in his own occu- 
pation as was necessary for the use of his family, distributing the 
remainder among sundry tenants, who held it by one of two 
different tenures, one called bookland (the origin probably of 
customary freeholds), which was held by deeds and certain rents 
and free services, and the other folkland (from which copyhold 
sprang), not held by deed, but distributed among the common 
people at the lord's pleasure, who might resume occupation of such 
lands whenever he chose to do so.
The tenants were serfs and 
villeins, and the females neifes.
They are said at one time to have 
been as much slaves as the Spartan helots, the boors of Denmark, 
or the traals of Sweden.
MANORIAL RIGHTS AND COURTS.
The two material incidents of a manor were demesne and 
services.
Some parts of the manor remained uncultivated, and 
were called the lord's waste, and were common both to the lord 
and tenants, as we still find in the extensive commons which 
surround the enclosed lands in this neighbourhood.
The lord of 
a manor was also empowered to hold a court called a Court Baron.
This court is said by some authorities to be an inseparable 
ingredient of a manor, and in each of the manors that are the 
subjects of this paper, we find one held.
The Courts Baron for the 
Manor of Hawkshead are held regularly once a year, in the month 
of November ; but I am sorry to say those of the Marquis and 
Richmond Fees are held very irregularly.
At the Court Baron the 
tenants pay their rents and fines, present their deeds, and obtain 
their admittances, and have the evidence of their title to their lands 
entered upon the rolls of the Court.
A Court Leet was the King's 
Court granted by charter to the lords of certain hundreds and 
manors, but not, like the Court Baron, an inseparable incident of 
102 
a manor.
Its original intention was to view the frank pledges of 
the freemen, the preservation of the peace, and the chastisement 
of small offenders.
All freeholders within the limits were obliged 
to attend these courts.
It was also the custom at these courts to 
present by the jury all crimes which had happened within their 
jurisdiction.
There is no Court Leet either here or at Hawkshead, 
but there is one at Kendal and another at Dalton.
The Court of 
Pie Poudre, or Pie Powder, as it is commonly called, was so named 
either from the dusty feet of the suitors, or because justice was 
done so quickly that the dust had not time to fall from their feet, 
and was a court incident to every fair and market.
If I remember 
right, you had power to hold one at Ambleside on the occasion of 
your annual fairs.
The owner of the market tolls was the judge, 
and his jurisdiction extended to all commercial injuries done in 
that very fair or market, so that the injury must be done, com- 
plained of, heard and determined within the compass of one and 
the same day, unless the fair continued longer.
CUSTOMARY FREEHOLDS.
And now as to customs which are the very essence, as it were 
of customary freeholds.
A custom is an unwritten law established 
by long usage.
The difference between a custom and prescription 
is that the former is local, as prevailing in a certain county, 
hundred, manor, &c., and the latter personal, being applicable to 
a certain person and his ancestors, or to a body politic and their 
predecessors.
A prescription presupposes a grant as the origin of 
it, but a custom does not.
A custom to be legal must have been 
used time out of mind, and four properties are essential to its 
existence, viz., a reasonable commencement, to be certain, to have 
continuance, and not to be against the king's prerogative.
Now, 
the first custom to which I shall draw your attention is the mode 
of conveying property in these manors.
Freehold land is conveyed 
to a man and his heirs by a single deed, which deed in itself is 
evidence of his title, and shews that he has, what lawyers call, the 
legal estate in him.
Copyholds are first surrendered to the lord of 
the manor, and then re-granted by him to the purchaser, who then 
103 
holds by the copy of the court roll, it alone being evidence of his 
title.
But customary freehold is first conveyed by a deed of grant, 
very similar to a deed conveying freeholds, only it must be stated 
therein that the purchaser will hold the lands intended to be con- 
veyed according to the custom of the manor, and pay and perform 
all rents, dues, suits, services, &c., therefore due and of right 
accustomed.
But this deed does not complete a purchaser's title 
so as to vest the legal estate in him.
Something more is necessary.
He must take his deed and present it at the Court Baron, or to the 
steward out of court, who enters it upon the rolls, and gives the 
purchaser what is called an admittance, that is, a document by 
which he admits him to be a tenant of the manor.
For this a fine 
(two years' ancient rent in the manor of Hawkshead, and three in 
the Marquis and Richmond Fees) is payable to the lord, together 
with certain fees to the steward.
These fines are payable either 
upon the death of the lord or on a change of tenant.
Besides 
these customary rents and fines, the lord is entitled to all mines 
and minerals, save that the tenant can get stone and materials for 
buildings, &:c., upon his own land, but not for sale.
The lords of 
these manors are also entitled to all rights and privileges of chase 
and free warren, hunting, hawking, fowling, and of chasing and 
killing game and beasts of chase and free warren.
If any of you 
have enfranchised your customary property, and refer to your 
enfranchisement deed, you will perhaps be astonished to find that 
the lord even at the present day reserves these rights ; and you 
would doubtless be still more astonished if some fine morning 
you found Lord Lonsdale exercising them in a good old-fashioned 
lordly way.
GREENHUE RENT.
On referring to an old manuscript, I find that at one time a 
good deal was thought about the woods in the Marquis and Rich- 
mond Fees, as well as about the repairing and building of houses 
therewith.
The author says that within the Barony of Kendal 
woods are thus distinguished, viz., into woods of warrant and 
underwood, the latter commonly consisting of hazels, willows.
104 
alders, thorns, and the like.
Woods of warrant are oak, ash, 
hoUing, crabtree, and, in some places, birch and white thorn, and 
they are so called, because, albeit those woods grow upon the 
tenants' ground, and they (the tenants) commonly took thereof 
necessary house bote, hedge bote, plow bote, and cart bote, yet at 
one time they could not even do this without warrant or license 
from the lord, or delivery of the lord's bailiff, servant, or other 
officer.
They, in fact, had no interest or property in any woods 
whatsoever, but only under a certain duty or acknowledgement, 
which is called greenhue rent.
This greenhue rent is payable in 
all the manors which are the subject of this paper, and is generally 
about \d.
or 2d.
a tenement.
By the payment of this rent the 
tenants are entitled to cut such underwoods as grow within their 
own tenements, and also to lop woods of warrant.
But if the 
tenant lopped such woods unreasonably, he was a trespasser to 
the lord, and liable to be fined at the lord's court.
Unreasonable 
lopping was, either when the branches were cut off too near the 
bole, or when the master branch or top of the tree was cut off, and 
so made the tree liable to decay.
It was also considered 
unreasonable lopping if such lopping was done either when the 
sap was ascending or descending, because, in either case, it was 
likely to cause decay.
It was the custom to administer the 
following oath to the tenants at each Court Baron : — " You shall 
swear that neither you, nor any of you, nor any to your use or 
knowledge, hath grubbed, felled, or cut down any wood of 
warrant, as oak, ash, holly, or crabtree, within this lordship with- 
out license of the lord or delivery of his officer." What one of the 
old bailiffs (could he appear in the flesh again) would think of our 
plantations now-a-days, with their ever increasing variety of firs, 
pines, &c., I cannot tell, but I imagine he would be pretty con- 
siderably non-plussed, especially if he happened to come across an 
Arancaria imbricaia, or " monkey puzzle." 
Then, as regards houses, the lord was not bound to find his 
tenant all kinds of wood for building, nor yet for all sorts of 
buildings, but only for a "convenient" dwelling-house, barn, byre 
or cowhouse, and principally for the ease or rigging tree, spars, 
105 
ribs, and laths for the roofs.
The lord Avas not bound to provide 
wood, if the tenant would build larger houses than were necessary ; 
for, as the author says, " it were an unreasonable custom that the 
lord should find his tenant timber for building for his pleasure or 
vainglory." In the Manor of Hawkshead, until a few years ago, 
there was a singular rent payable, called "bloomsmithy rent." It 
originated as follows : — There were three iron forges or "bloomaries' 
in the Manor of Hawkshead, the ore being brought from Low 
Furness to be smelted with charcoal made from the woods of High 
Furness.
The tenants of the manor complained that their woods 
were being destroyed by the increasing use of charcoal, and, in the 
seventh year of the reign of Elizabeth, the forges were suppressed, 
on the tenants of the manor agreeing amongst themselves to pay 
the rent of 20/.
The amount was assessed rateably over the 
various properties, and this was the origin of the " bloomsmithy 
rents " which we find mentioned in most old deeds.
The Duke 
of Buccleuch, a few years ago, gave the tenants the option of 
buying them out, which I think all took advantage of, so that they 
are now extinguished.
MILITARY SERVICE.
In these manors, besides the certain rents, the tenants were 
liable to a military service, which makes me think that, though of 
villein tenure, it was the most exalted species of that tenure which 
existed in these manors.
In fact they were big villeins.
By this 
service every tenant in the Barony, from the age of sixteen to sixty, 
was obliged " at all times, in their most defensible array for the 
wars, to be ready to serve their prince upon horseback and upon 
foot at the West Borders of England against Scotland, on their 
own proper costs and charges, and so be ready night and day at 
the command of the Lord Warden of the said West Marches, 
always for the time being being warned thereunto by beacon fires, 
post, or proclamation, and there to continue during the said Lord 
Warden's pleasure." In Furness a like service was required; but 
Piel was also a vulnerable place, and there the tenants were bound 
to muster in the common defence against pirates, as well as on the 
106 
Western Marches against the Scots, and that this service was no 
sinecure we may rest assured, for in the old ballad of " Flodden 
Field" we read : — 
Most lively lads in Lonsdale bred.
With weapons of unwieldy weight.
All such as Tatham Fells had bred, 
Went under Stanley's streamers bright.
From Silverdale to Kent sand side, 
Whose soil is sown with cockle shells ; 
From Cartmel eke and Connyside, 
With fellows fierce from Furness Fells.
SUCCESSION FINES.
There were otiier customs which have gradually dieil out, and, 
as a reference to them would extend my paper beyond its proper 
limit, I proceed to those which are more important, by reason of 
their being in force and governing the holdings of the tenants at 
the present time.
And first as regards descent.
In the Marquis 
and Richmond fees, the property descends, on the death of a 
tenant, to the eldest son ; and, if only daughters survive, then to 
the eldest of them.
This is not precisely the same in the Manor 
of Hawkshead, for, though the tenement descends to the eldest 
son, if there is one, should there be only daughters, it does not go 
necessarily to the eldest amongst the daughters, but the eldest 
unmarried daughter takes the whole, paying to her younger sister, 
if only one, twenty years' ancient rent : if more than one, forty 
years' ancient rent to be equally divided amongst them.
In the 
Manors of the Marquis and Richmond fees, you are not allowed 
by the custom to entail property.
Therefore, if one leaves his 
property to his son and the heirs male or female of his body, the 
property will go to the son absolutely, the entail being disregarded.
But this is not the case in Hawkshead.
In many manors, the lord 
upon the death of a tenant is entitled to what is called a " heriot," 
which consists of the best chattel the tenant is possessed of at the 
time of his death, be it horse, ox, calf, or pig.
Of the manors we 
are now considering, in that of Hawkshead there is no heriot 
payable.
But in the Marquis and Richmond fees, the lord is 
107 
entitled to one when a tenant dies and leaves a widow.
The 
widow, on payment of the heriot (now a fixed money payment of 
p{^io), is entitled to hold all the land which her husband died 
possessed of, so long as she remains his chaste widow and un- 
married ; and the husband cannot, by his will, deprive the widow 
of this her widow right, or " free bench," as it is technically called, 
if she elects to take it.
How this custom arose I cannot say, for 
it is not a usual one in tenures of this nature, though we find it in 
Borough English, a burgage tenure.
As you will observe, this is 
very different from the dower which a widow is entitled to out of 
her deceased husband's freehold, and which you all know, I dare 
say, is only one-third, which is also the proportion a widow gets in 
the Manor of Hawkshead for her "free bench." Here again, 
then, the ladies will say they are gainers by the feudal laws and 
customs, but they forget the men were villeins, and if they gave 
an inch they took an ell ; for what do you think a husband can 
do with his wife's customary property if he chooses ?
Well, he has 
nothing else to do but present the certificate of his marriage to the 
steward, pay his fees, and be admitted tenant of his wife's estate, 
not for life only, but absolutely and completely, so that he can sell, 
mortgage, will, or do what he likes with it.
This is a peculiar 
custom, and is not found in the Manor of Hawkshead, and diff'ers 
from that of freehold very much, for, by the latter, a husband 
during the marriage has no right to dispose of his wife's freeholds 
without her consent, and after her death can only hold them by 
what is called the "courtesy of England," for his own life, and 
that again only in the event of a child being born alive.
THE RIGHT OF COMMON.
In all the manors we find commons or waste lands generally 
unstinted, or, as people are in the habit of saying, unlimited.
You 
will often hear a person say that he has, in right of his estate, an 
unlimited right of common on such and such a fell.
This is all 
nonsense.
His common right is limited by the custom to such a 
number of sheep as his enclosed land will keep during the winter 
months.
108 
THE COUNCIL OF STAVELEY.
As the barons of old had to stand up for their rights, so had 
the tenants occasionally.
We find that in the reign of James I., 
one of his schemes for raising money was that of taking all the 
Crown lands of Cumberland and Westmorland into his own hands, 
on the plea "that as Border service had then ceased by the union 
of the two kingdoms in his own royal person, the estates were 
determined likewise which the tenants held by that service." And 
a long struggle ensued between lords and tenants, the latter 
declaring to defend each other, " even by force, if no other course 
should be effectual," in accordance with articles which they had 
sworn to at their meeting held at Staveley, under colour of viewing 
a bridge.
For this and other unlawful assemblies, some of the 
leaders were arraigned before the Star Chamber, but acquitted, 
and had their estates confirmed to them, as being held, not by 
Border service alone, but by the general military tenure by which 
all other tenants in capiie were obliged.
Soon afterwards many of 
the tenants made compositions with their lords for reducing this 
to a fine certain, and others purchased them in freehold.
With 
regard to 
THE CUSTOMARY TENANTS OF H.\WKSHEAD, 
they, on the dissolution of the Monastery, do not appear to have 
had a very good time of it until the reign of Elizabeth, for, though 
several commissions had been issued immediately after the sup- 
pression of the Monastery to settle the affairs of Furness, and in 
particular with the customary tenants, yet the rights, privileges, 
and customs were not ascertained before the time of Elizabeth, in 
the twenty-seventh year of whose reign a code of customs and 
bye-laws was drawn up by a special jury of tenants, and approved 
by the Queen.
THE DECAY OF THE FEUDAL SYSTEM.
When the feudal baron first raised his standard, he lived 
amongst his vassals : he was their patron, and defended them ; 
but at length, by the various changes of property, and the central- 
109 
ization of Parliament, the baron became separated from his 
dependants, and his protection became more fictitious than real.
Voluntary associations of the people were formed, and thus the 
force of the feudal connection became weakened.
Commerce 
arose, and by it the efforts of man expanded immensely.
Inform- 
ation gained from foreign intercourse gave rise to new thoughts, 
new wants, and new pleasures.
Trade became the great function 
of the day, and, as it were, a new power, by which the chains of 
feudalism were broken ; and, though some of its elements remain 
still, they remain only in a very modified form.

NOTES ON THE WHITEHAVEN RURAL'SANITARY 
DISTRICT.
By JAMES SYME, Med. Off.
of Health.
(Read at Whitehaven.
) ^ 
In selecting my subject, I was impelled to do so upon the 
suggestion of your President, and also by the knowledge of the 
many requirements which every day become to my eyes more 
apparent, in the district over which I have the honour to have the 
medical supervision.
It is my purpose, in the first place, to give 
a short digest of the laws which ought to govern the sanitary 
condition of every district, in order to obviate those malarious 
diseases which are sure to make their appearance if the observance 
of what is laid down by the best authorities be not strictly adhered 
to.
Effective sewerage, a good water supply, proper ventilation, 
and the absence of over-crowding, may be selected as the four 
corner-stones upon which to build the edifice.
It is an old 
proverb, and a very true one, that "cleanliness is next to godli- 
ness." It has been amongst the oldest and most universal of 
medical experiences, that people living among filth, and within 
direct reach of its polluting influence, succumb to various diseases, 
which, under opposite conditions, are comparatively, or even 
absolutely, unknown.
The experience of modern times has shown 
that by various indirect channels, filth can operate far more subtly, 
and also far more widely and more fatally, than ancient science 
anticipated.
An important suggestion with regard to the nature of 
the operations by which filth, attacking the human body, is able to 
disorder or destroy it, is that the chief morbific agencies in filth are 
112 
other than those chemically identified — stinking gaseous products 
of organic decomposition, which force themselves upon popular 
attention; A popular authority, writing upon this point, says : 
"Exposure to the sufficiently concentrated fumes of organic 
decomposition (as for instance in an unventilated old cesspool, or 
long-blocked sewer), may, no doubt, prove immediately fatal, by 
reason of some large quantity of sulphide of ammonium, or other like 
poisonous or fcetid gas, which the sufferer suddenly inhales ; and 
far smaller doses of these foetid gases, as breathed with extreme 
dilution in ordinary stinking atmospheres, both give immediate 
headache and general discomfort to sensitive persons temporarily 
exposed to them, and also appear to keep in a somewhat vaguely 
depressed state of health, many who habitually breathe them." 
Upon these points I am able to speak from painful experience.
After having been temporarily exposed to an insanitary locality in 
the course of my inspection, however much the impure gases may 
be impregnated with ozone, I almost invariably suffer daily for 
some time from diarrhoea, and a depressed state of health.
People 
of a sensitive temperament are most susceptible to the influence of 
these impurities, and much more likely to be attacked by them 
than those of an opposite nature.
The same thing will apply 
equally to infective water as to infective air.
In the former, just 
as in the latter, the zymotic malignity is but indirectly and most 
imperfectly suggested to us by qualities which strike the common 
sense, or by matters which chemical analysis can specify.
As the 
sense of smell possessed by man, will cause him to turn away with 
disgust from certain emanations, so will it, and common taste and 
sight, cause him to be repelled by certain waters.
As the chemist can 
show certain foulness in the one, so also can he show certain foulness 
in the other.
People under the influence of filth, suffer not only 
from that influence, but also from other removable causes of disease; 
and, in endeavouring to estimate exactly the injury which is derived 
from filth, those additional influences should, as far as practicable, 
be matter of separate account.
On one hand a filthy neighbour- 
hood may be so poor, that mere privation is an appreciable cause 
of disease in it.
On the other, the population may be so badly 
113 
housed, or so overcrowded in their dwellings, that this has to be 
counted as causing disease.
In another case, some particular 
collective occupation, injurious to the adults and adolescents who 
follow it, may be creating disease additional to that which the 
filth produces.
Another case may be cited, where swarms of 
young children, whose mothers are engaged away from home, or 
who are given to drunken, idle habits, may be suffering from 
disease induced by neglect and mismanagement.
In filthy urban 
districts, where the foul air incarcerated in courts, and alleys, and 
narrow streets, can act with most force in regard to masses of 
population, the population always shows increased mortality, under 
several titles of disease.
This miscellaneous increase of mortality 
affects probably all ages, more or less ; but a distinctively large 
proportion of it attaches to the children.
Apparently the mere 
influence of the filth (apart from other influences), will be causing 
the infants and young children to die at twice, or thrice, or even 
four times their standard rate of mortality ; and this disproportion, 
which becomes more striking, when the chief epidemics of ordinary 
childhood, such as measles, whooping-cough, and scarlatina, are 
left out of the comparison, seems to mark the young and tender 
lives as finer tests of foul air, than are the elder, and what I might 
call acclimatised population.
Besides nuisances being produced by the presence of putres- 
cent refuse-matter, there are also diseases which are abundantly 
caused by air which is fouled in other ways.
Overcrowding, for 
instance, is a fruitful source of evil.
In dwellings which are 
inhabited beyond their means of ventilation, the foulness of the air 
due to the non-removal of the volatile refuse thrown off by the 
human body, becomes strictly a nuisance, and comes within the 
scope of sanitary law, quite as much as the non-removal of solid 
or liquid refuse.
In filthy districts, one special class of diseases 
seems to stand in relief, viz.
diarrhoeal.
These diseases, in relation 
to filth, deserve very special attention, first, on their own account, 
as they are extremely large causes of death ; and, secondly, because 
an exact knowledge of their method of production is likely to throw 
comparative light upon the pathology of obscure filth diseases.
114 
Cholera and Enteric fever are also to be attributed to excremental 
or other obnoxious infection.
I might refer to a few of the chief forms whereby we are apt 
to get filth about us.
There are many houses and groups of 
houses — and I have a considerable share of them in my own 
district — where general slovenliness in everything which relates to 
the removal of refuse-matter, is the local habit; where within a 
short distance of the door of each house, or in spaces common to 
many houses, refuse, which house life, and some sorts of trade life, 
produce, lies for an indefinite period, undergoing foetid decompo- 
sition.
Excrement of man and beast, garbage of all sorts, and 
ponded slop water, lying bare upon the common surface.
With 
this state of things, be it on a large or a small scale, the chief 
sorts of danger to life arise.
One is, that volatile effluvia from the 
refuse, pollute the surrounding air, and everything which it 
contains; the other is — the liquid parts of the refuse pass, by 
soaking or filtering, into the surrounding soil, and there to mingle 
with whatever water the soil may produce, and in certain cases 
thus to occasion the deadliest pollution of any wells or springs 
which may be situate in their neighbourhood.
It is a recognized fact 
that accumulations of this sort do not only affect the places where 
they are collected, but can transmit their infective power through 
certain channels to a great distance.
Houses, for instance, which 
have unguarded drainage-communication with sewers or cesspools, 
may receive the same deleterious air through such channels, just 
the same as if the excrement stood rotting within their walls.
Private or public water reservoirs, or water conduits, giving 
accidental admission to filth, will carry the infection of the filth 
wheresoever their outflow reaches.
It has repeatedly come 
within my own knowledge that an individual house, with every 
apparent cleanliness, has received the contagion of fever from 
some drain inlet, or from deposits of filth at a distance.
One 
of the most salubrious villages in West Cumberland produced 
ample proof of this only a few weeks ago, where scarlatina broke 
out in a somewhat viralent form.
In looking for the cause, it 
was discovered that, some distance from the houses where the 
115 
fever existed, there were several privies in a very objectionable 
condition.
These, combined with an abominable filthy slaughter- 
house adjoining, produced such a smell in that immediate 
neighbourhood, as to repel the greatest case-hardened sanitarian 
that ever lived.
There is no doubt that the effluvia from such 
places, in a diluted state, found its way into the houses where the 
fever broke out.
At least, upon careful examination, I formed that 
opinion.
And thus, also, it has not unfrequently happened that 
households, whilst themselves without sanitary reproach, have 
received the contagion of fever through some filth affecting the 
water-supply which they have in use.
Another source of filth is 
often derived from the absence of sewers, where people assume 
that sewers may properly be dispensed with where water-closets 
are not in use ; and that for the mere slopwaters, the open wayside 
gutters, which are meant for rain-water only, will suffice.
This is a very 
great mistake : because, at its worst, it is a very condensed form of 
sewage, and even at its best is such as cannot, without nuisance, 
be allowed to accumulate by the roadside.
Defects in existing 
sewers are not an unproductive source of nuisance.
The indispens- 
able conditions of success in a sewer are — first, that the flow of 
sewage to its outfall shall be as perfect as possible, continuous, 
and scouring ; not ponded and leaking, and depositing ; and also 
that the sewer shall have perfect ventilation.
Sewers with radically 
ill-construction, are virtually but cesspools, and should without 
delay be abolished.
There is also a very great danger to the 
public health, particularly to the middle classes of society, by the 
recklessness with which house-drains, receiving pipes from water- 
closets, sinks, cisterns, baths, etc., in the interior of houses, and 
often actually in bed-rooms, or the adjoining dressing-rooms, are 
brought in communication with the sewers.
Amongst architects 
and builders, there seems to have been very imperfect recognition 
of the danger which this arrangement involves.
The intention, 
and where realised, the distinctive merit of a system of water-closets 
is, that in removing excremental matters from a house, it does so 
with promptitude, and in a perfect and complete manmer, not 
having any intervals of delay, nor leaving any residue of filth, nor 
116 
diffusing any during its operation ; and where the water system is 
not in use, these objects ought still, as far as possible, to be secured.
In the absence of water-closets, any reasonable alternative system 
ought to include the following : — First, proper catchment apparatus ; 
and second, proper arrangement for scavenge.
Under the head 
of one or more of the causes named, will be found the true explan- 
ation of outbreaks and prevalence of entero-zymotic disease in 
different districts of this county.
There is another well established fact, that filth infection may 
be transmitted even on a large scale from district to district in 
particular articles of food, and especially in the article of milk.
In proof of this, I shall quote an extract from the report of Dr.
Simon, Medical Offiqer of the Privy Council and Local Govern- 
ment Board, which says: "In 1870, Dr. Ballard, now of this 
department, but who at that time was working with high character 
as Officer of Health for the parish of Islington, was able to show 
that an outbreak of Enteric fever, which had attacked in ten weeks 
seventy families, and one hundred and seventy-five persons in part 
of his district, coincided with the use of milk supplied from a 
particular dairy, where, shortly before the outbreak, there had been 
cases of Enteric fever, and where, apparently, the infected house 
drainage must have had easy access to an underground water-tank 
upon the premises.
There could be little doubt as to what in this 
epidemic had been the infectant.
Since Dr. Ballard's connection 
with this department, it has twice happened to him to be able very 
clearly to trace the same method of infection at work in consider- 
able outbreaks of Enteric fever, which he has been investigating — 
one in 1872 at Armley, in the Borough of Leeds, and the other in 
1873 at Moseley and Balsall Heath, near Birmingham." 
It is, therefore, quite clear that, while we are subject at 
almost any moment to breathe contaminated atmosphere, or 
partake of water impregnated with deleterious matter, we are at the 
same time liable to be brought in contact with similar impurities in 
our daily food.
In my own district, there are many farmsteads 
where a pump or well is situate in the yard adjoining the manure 
117 
heap, and which must unquestionably be the receptacle for a 
certain portion of the liquid coming therefrom.
I have in all cases of this sort where I apprehend any danger, 
advised the abandonment of such wells for domestic purposes.
During a dry season like the past, where many places were 
destitute of water altogether of a usable character, it is a matter of 
impossibility to prevent people using what available water they have 
at their command, nothwithstanding that they may be fully 
convinced of its impurity.
A striking instance of this came under 
my notice only a few months ago.
My attention was called to a 
block of buildings situate at Newtown, Frizington, and amongst 
other insanitary arrangements, I found that a sewer from Newtown, 
situate upon a higher level, passed within a very short distance of 
the well which was used by the inhabitants of those houses.
The 
people living in them, informed me that they were compelled to 
use this water, as they had no other ; and at times they said it was 
quite obnoxious to both taste and smell.
This is not an isolated 
case in the Whitehaven Rural Sanitary District, and a better state 
of things can only be looked forward to when the Authority will 
make up their minds to have a plentiful supply of good water 
furnished to every place within their jurisdiction.
There have been cases of Typhoid fever within my district, 
which have been clearly traceable to wellpoisoning—Harrington, 
Parton, and Frizington, may be noted as places where this has 
been experienced, not only by myself, but by other medical men.
Some people advocate the use of disinfectants, for the purpose of 
purifying such places, but I have little faith in that creed.
Districts which have been allowed to become filthy, cannot 
off-hand be made wholesome by disinfectants.
To chemically 
disinfect any neglected neighbourhood; to follow the body and 
branches of filth with really effective chemical treatment; to 
thoroughly destroy or counteract it in muck heaps, cesspools, ash- 
pits, sewers, and drains, and where percolating into wells, and 
exhaling into houses, cannot, I apprehend, be proposed as 
physically possible.
This opinion as to the very limited degree in 
which chemistry can prevail against arrears of uncleanliness, does 
118 
not at all discredit the appeals which are constantly, and very 
properly, made to chemistry, for help in quite a different sphere of 
operation, namely, with regard to the management of individual 
cases of infectious disease, and to the immediate disinfection of 
everything which comes from and surrounds the patients — the 
cleansing of dark, narrow passages by the means of whitewashing 
with hot lime and carbolic acid, chloride of lime, or other such 
disinfectants.
The thorough flushing of the sewers may also do much 
to alleviate the condition of the poor people living in the neighbour- 
hood.
It has been found that, under a visitation of Enteric fever 
from filth infection, any attempts at going through the ceremony 
of applying vague chemical libations or powderings, has proved 
futile.
If our Local Authorities wish to reduce the vast amount of 
preventible disease, which has its type in Enteric fever, or other 
diseases setiologically akin to it, and in relation to which, each 
individual case which occurs ought to have an important local 
significance, the one essential condition is cleanliness.
That Local 
Sanitary Authorities, acting upon this principle, and with a full 
determination to enforce it in their respective districts, can, within 
a few years, reduce by tens of thousands the annual mortality 
of England, is at least as certain as that the causes pointed out 
are the means of producing the diseases alluded to.
It will be seen from the foregoing disjointed remarks, that my 
aim has been to point out what I consider to be the proper mode 
of carrying out the work of a properly governed sanitary district.
As I stated at the outset, there must be effective sewerage, a good 
water supply, proper ventilation, and the absence of overcrotuding.
In the Whitehaven Rural Sanitary District, I am sorry to say that 
almost throughout its whole breadth and length, there is a marked 
absence of all these.
There is another matter of a general character to which I 
would also advert.
At present, the means of learning the existence 
of infectious diseases in my extensive district, are so defective, 
that I am quite unable to take adequate steps to prevent the spread 
of such diseases, and by opposing the beginnings, to cut short an 
epidemic.
It is my duty, according to my instructions, "on 
119 
receiving information of the outbreak of any contagious, infectious, 
or epidemic disease of a dangerous character, to visit the spot 
without delay, and inquire into the causes and circumstances of 
such outbreak, and advise the persons competent to act, as to the 
measures which may appear to me to be required to prevent the 
extension of the disease, and, so far as I may be authorized, assist 
in the execution of the same." Unfortunately, however, at present 
there being no compulsory registration of disease, and no one to 
inform me of such outbreak, it very often happens that the first 
information I receive is from the district registrar, when there has 
been a death.
Any interference then is, of course, of very little 
use.
It is my opinion that some steps should be taken by 
Parliament, in order that the Medical Officer of Health shall be 
immediately informed of the occurrence of any infectious disease; 
and this is the more necessary, for it is the first cases which are of 
the most importance.
Then is the time for isolating the patient, 
and using the various means within our power for disinfection.
As Dr. Simon states in one of his annual reports that " the first 
isolated cases of epidemic diseases almost invariably, if not checked 
by sanitary precautions, are the forerunners of a general outbreak ; 
and in matters of sanitation, as in all others, any measure to be 
really effective, must be precautionary." 
I now purpose to give you some particulars as to the real 
state of affairs, in a sanitary point of view, within my district.
Commencing at Egremont, which may be considered head quarters, 
I have not a very bright picture to place before you, although its 
condition has been wonderfully improved of late.
The supply of 
water up to a few months ago was almost infinitesimal in comparison 
to the population.
In fact, during the dry weather last summer, 
many people were absolutely without water, within a distance of 
from half a mile to a mile.
Could it expected that poor people 
— perhaps a wife with a swarm of little children to care for at 
home — would, or even could, carry' water such a distance, for 
sanitary purposes.
I have no doubt, in fact I am aware of it, that 
many of the people living at the high end of the town, could 
scarcely find time to convey the water for domestic purposes from 
120 
Bookwell to their residences.
It was a very general remark 
amongst many of them, that " dinner was no sooner over, than 
they had to go and get the water for the tea." With many poor 
people, the difficulty is in getting the tea for the water, but in this 
instance the water was the most essential element.
To some 
extent this difficulty has been overcome.
The Authority has 
provided a temporary supply from Howbank, through the kindness 
of Mr. Hartley.
Some stand-pipes have been erected in the main 
street, and so far there has been a plentiful supply.
It must, 
however, consist solely of surface drainage.
And although the 
water is apparently of considerable purity, I am afraid that its 
subjection to the analyst would produce a considerable amount of 
vegetable matter.
The source is from the hill-side immediately 
below Howbank, and the reservoir, or collecting ponds, are at the 
bottom of it.
From thence the water is conveyed direct in iron 
pipes to the town.
There are no filter beds provided, so that the 
water comes to the outlets in the same condition as it is found at 
its source.
This supply has proved a great boon to the public for 
domestic purposes ; but I am afraid it has not been advantageous 
in a sanitary point of view, and I will show why.
The main street of Egremont may be taken for granted to be 
about three-quarters of a mile in length : five stand-pipes have been 
erected in that distance, so that in round numbers the space 
between each may be put down at seven hundred and twenty 
yards.
This is to all intents and purposes a prohibition of the use 
of water for sanitary purposes.
It is not within the scope of 
human nature to carry water such a distance to wash down the 
back-yards and scour the gutters.
In order to secure a supply for 
such a purpose, by means of whichthe inhabitants can fully cleanse 
not only themselves, but also their surroundings, they must have 
the water brought on to the premises, so that by the simple turning 
of a tap, a proper flushing and scouring can at intervals remove 
the accumulated filth into its proper channel.
For the present, 
the temporary supply is looked upon as a blessing.
There is also a very defective mode of sewerage in existence 
here, many of the houses getting rid of their slop water by open 
121 
gutters, which are in several cases in a very offensive state.
I 
observe that at a meeting of the ratepayers held a short time ago, 
it was determined to oppose the general water scheme suggested 
by Dr. Fox and myself.
At another meeting, it was resolved to 
take the necessary steps for forming a Local Board.
That a better 
supply of water than the present is most urgent, cannot be denied ; 
and as the opposition offered to it was conspicuously exhibited by 
those who never experienced the want of water, I cannot give 
much credit to the result as representing the general feeUng of the 
parish.
The formation of a Local Board would certainly prove 
advantageous in many respects, because under the supervision of 
the Board in London, they would be compelled to carry out a 
proper system of sanitary improvements ; but at the same time the 
ratepayers would be compelled to pay for them.
I consider that 
all the benefits which would be derived from a Local Board, could 
be obtained without having recourse to the expensive machinery 
attached to the adoption of sanitary measures under the Local 
Government Board.
Although Egremont may at present be con- 
sidered to have some pretensions to urban dimensions, it would 
be well for the ratepayers to consider whether the adoption of 
self-government, and being placed in the proud position of 
managing their own affairs, would not be rather an expensive mode 
of gratifying their ambition.
With a better supply of water, some 
improvements in the sewerage, and the covering up of a portion of 
the beck which runs through the town, all that is at present 
desirable would be obtained, and the cost comparatively small.
In advocating a general supply of good water, it must be self- 
evident to those who have enjoyed it, that not only does modern 
science and civilization demand, but common humanity cries aloud 
for it.
Take for instance the town of Whitehaven (and perhaps 
Dr. Lumb will pardon me for this digression in trespassing upon 
his preserves) ; it is a well known fact, that prior to the introduction 
of water from Ennerdale lake, and the adoption of a proper system 
of sewerage, it was looked upon as the blackest spot on the map of 
England, so far as its mortality was concerned.
At the present 
time, according to a recent report of the medical officer, the death- 
122 
rate was amongst the lowest in England.
How has this state of 
things been brought about?
Simply by the introduction of a 
couple of the most prominent laws which govern the sanitation of 
our towns and cities, viz., efficient sewerage, and abundance of 
good water.
Where both are used as they ought to be, preventible 
diseases will seldom or never be heard of.
Overcrowding, or bad 
ventilation, may prove a source of disease; but in a town like 
Whitehaven, both these evils will be difficult wholly to eradicate, 
although I see from Dr. Lumb's reports, that the governing body 
are sparing neither trouble nor expense to protect the inhabitants 
of crowded localities against themselves.
Perhaps the next most important place in my district is Cleator.
Here most of the property is owned by Messrs.
Lindow and 
Mr. Ainsworth, and to their credit be it said, the place is tolerably 
well sewered, and there is a plentiful supply of good water.
Messrs.
Lindow get their supply from Dent, and Mr. Ainsworth gets 
his from the Cleator Moor water works.
The sewage finds its way 
into the rivers Ehen and Keekle.
The consequence is, that at 
Cleator there is very little to complain of, and the rate of mortality 
is one of the lowest in the district.
I must again step out of my 
bounds into the district of Cleator Moor.
Here a medical officer 
is appointed to look after it, so that in that capacity I have not the 
power to make any inspection.
But as medical officer for the 
parish, my attention was called to a case of typhoid fever there.
In company with some of the Guardians, I visited the place, and 
in looking for the cause, I found a very dirty yard covered with all 
sorts of garbage and refuse immediately adjoining the house where 
the case occurred.
The drain was also stopped, and the place 
emitted such a combination of fever-producing effluvia, that no 
doubt was left on my mind as to the cause of the disease.
It will 
thus be seen that, even where efficient sewerage and plenty of 
water are placed at the disposal of the people, occasionally both 
are painfully, and in some cases fatally, neglected.
The filthy 
habits which are too often to be found existing amongst our pauper 
population, are, doubtless, prominent elements in the procreation 
of the class of diseases alluded to.
123 
Passing from Cleator Moor to Keekle Terrace, we find that 
the inhabitants there, like sensible people, have availed themselves 
of the Whitehaven mains for their water supply, consequently they 
are in possession of one great essential element in the maintenance 
of a clean bill of health.
The sewerage, however, is defective, and 
requires attention.
The same remarks will apply to Hensingham 
as to Keekle Terrace.
Three small places in the neighbourhood 
of Hensingham have given me great concern for some time past, 
viz : — High and Low Harris, and Scilly Banks.
The inhabitants 
of each place are certainly numerically small, and the situation places 
them in the happy position of being able to breathe an atmosphere 
of unquestionable purity, but unfortunately, their water supply is not 
only of the most meagre description, but is also of the most 
offensive character.
In fact, the well by the road side at Low 
Harris, which is the only supply there, is simply poison in a diluted 
form.
I am glad to be able to state that steps are being taken by 
the Whitehaven Trust to supply these places, so that one great 
source of danger will be swept away.
On going down to Parton, we find that the people there are 
supplied through water-pipes in the street, which are furnished from 
a reservoir above the village.
The source some time ago was 
objectionable, as it was liable to all sorts of contaminations.
During wet weather, the water was totally unfit for domestic 
purposes — its colour clearly indicating its contact with impurities.
That source, however, has been abandoned, and a couple of springs 
which were pointed out, have been adopted, and the supply may 
now be said to be fairly good.
At Lowca, a small village has sprung into existence within a 
short period, and is almost wholly unprovided with water and 
sewerage.
At the adjoining village of Distington, there are a few 
public wells by the road-side, which are used by both men and 
beasts ; a pump or two, situate in objectionable proximity to 
manure heaps and other filth ; while the beck, which is a receptacle 
for all kinds of filth, also provides the people with water.
Harrington also stands in much want of a supply of pure 
water; and I was glad to see that it had been suggested at a 
124 
meeting of the ratepayers, that they should procure a supply from 
Cockermouth.
Any objection which a parish may entertain to a 
general supply throughout the Union, and any suggestion for a 
better and more economical one from another source, are deserving 
of every consideration by the Local Authority.
A more efficient 
method of sewerage is also wanted here, but until plenty of water is 
procured, sewerage improvements would be perfectly futile.
Albert Terrace and Park View, near Whitehaven, with the 
houses adjoining, have had my attention called to them repeatedly.
They are entirely destitute of water within a less distance than a 
quarter of a mile, and what they can procure, even at that distance, 
is simply surface drainage from cultivated land, which is certain to 
be impregnated with decayed vegetable matter.
Now that the 
Whitehaven mains are to be extended to Low Harris, I hope to 
hear that the owners of property at Albert Terrace, etc., will take 
the necessary steps for extending them down the hill.
At Bransty there is a plentiful supply of water; but the slovenly 
manner in which the inhabitants remove the contents of their 
ashpits and privies is very objectionable.
Suitable ash depots, 
such as are in use at Albert Terrace, ought to be provided.
On the south side of the town, a small hamlet called Arrow- 
thwaite, stands on the top of the hill overhanging the valley.
This 
place has all the advantages which pure air can afford; but, 
unfortunately, up to within a short time ago, v.-as entirely without 
water, stwerage, or closet accommodation.
Water has, however, been 
introduced from Whitehaven, and a marked improvement has been 
the result.
Proceeding to Sandwith, we find that all the evils arising from 
an insanitary state of affairs are in existence.
The water supply 
is defective; the sewerage is in the same condition; and a sweeping 
reform is much needed.
The classical village of St. Bees is about on a par with many 
of the places I have named.
There are several wells, which are 
accredited with being of profound purity ; but I am afraid that, 
considering the source from whence they come, the people who 
use them are doing so under a delusion.
Most of the houses are 
125 
sewered, but owing to the scarcity of water, the sewers are of very 
little service, and their existence is thus a greater nuisance, perhaps, 
than their absence would be.
Coulderton and Middletown are much in want of water during 
dry weather, and the inhabitants have often to go all the way to 
Kellhead, a distance of nearly a mile, before they can either infuse 
a cup of tea or dilute a glass of grog.
These are inconveniences which all classes of the community 
feel, and feel acutely.
The small amount which would be added 
to the rates in obtaining a good supply of water to these places, 
which are in such a condition, would, apart entirely from sanitary 
motives, well repay them for the outlay.
Braystones is considered a salubrious climate, but here again 
the well water, with one or two exceptions, is impure.
The sewer- 
age is also defective.
Seascale, which has been talked of as becoming one of the 
most popular bathing places in the North of England, is perhaps 
one of the worst watered places in the district.
The Furness 
Railway Company have bought some building land near the 
Railway Station, and rumour points to it becoming a favourite 
resort for visitors.
With its present supply of water, however, it is 
quite impossible to attract the attention of those who can afford to 
go further a-field, where they can derive the advantages not only 
of good sea-bathing, but also of proper sanitary arrangements.
Gosforth requires both water and sewerage.
At Netherwasdale there are several shallow wells, which, if 
deepened, and protected from being fouled by surface drainage and 
washings, would furnish a good supply.
Their contiguity in some 
instances to midden-steads and cesspools is a very great source of 
danger.
In a district like this, where there is abundance of good 
water close at hand, the people ought to have a pure supply.
Calderbridge, with the river from which it derives its name 
running through it, has a plentiful supply of water ; but at this 
point the river water cannot be said to be fit for domestic purposes.
Its other sanitary arrangements are very bad.
To their defective 
126 
condition, I was able to trace an outbreak of scarlet fever only a 
few months ago.
Beckermont people still persist in drinking, and otherwise 
using the water which I believe is, to some extent, drained out of 
the churchyard, and the longer they use it the better they seem to 
like it.
Whether the water does come from the churchyard or not, 
it is quite clear that it is in most objectionable proximity to the 
sepulchres of the departed dead, and a shade of suspicion that 
the water comes from the source I have pointed out ought to make 
the use of it revolting.
Haile, Wilton, and Carleton are much in the same condition 
as the other small villages I have named.
The last-named 
place is specially unprovided with water, and there is no sewerage.
Frizington has had a temporary supply of water furnished 
through stand-pipes in the street ; but here again there is no 
proper system of sewerage.
At Asby, Arlecdon, Rowrah, Kirkland, and Eskett, a perfect 
water famine prevails, and the same may be said of Bigrigg, 
Moor Row, and Scalegill.
The three latter places are, I under- 
stand, in treaty with the Cleator Moor Local Board for a supply.
These notes have been made from a personal inspection, and 
a searching examination into the wants of the different places I 
have alluded to.
In advocating a general water scheme for the 
whole Union, it must be apparent to every one that there is a 
glaring deficiency in most of the places I have called attention to.
It will also be admitted that the sewerage arrangements are in a 
deplorable state, and that a system of drainage into our local 
streams should take place.
Some people may object to the rivers 
being converted into sewers.
I hold that they are the natural 
outlets for them.
As for the objection which is often adduced, 
that sewage is injurious to fish, I can only say that I don't believe 
it, as I have often had opportunities of watching fish feeding in 
rivers close to the outlet of sewers.
A very convincing fact came 
before my notice a few months ago, when an enquiry took place 
at Liverpool before Mr Frank Buckland and another Fishery 
127 
Commissioner, touching the decrease of the fish in the Mersey, 
and along the adjoining shores, when it was given in evidence by 
fishermen of over twenty years' experience, that the sewage of the 
town was not deleterious to the fish, but that the chemical works 
adjoining, discharging their refuse into the river, proved a very 
destructive element.
Of course, these remarks apply to fresh 
sewage only, which I consider is beneficial ; but at the same time, 
I have every reason to believe that fermented sewage is fatal to 
piscine life.
My remarks will, I fear, have proved somewhat dry material 
for some of you ; and to others they may have been wanting in 
that sweet flavour which ought to pervade a paper put before an 
assemblage of ladies and gentlemen in pursuit of scientific know- 
ledge.
I can only say that the fault is not mine, as the subject 
was suggested when I was requested to read the paper.
Something 
more congenial to the mind of a medical man I could have 
preferred, as the task of holding up the shortcomings of your 
neighbours to pubHc criticism is by no means a pleasant one.
What I have stated is given in unequivocal language, and in the 
words of a great sanitary authority, I may say, " I feel that if the 
new sanitary organization of the country is to fulfil its purpose, 
the administrators, local and central, must begin by fully recog- 
nizing the real state of the case, and with consciousness that, 
in many instances, they will have to introduce for the first time, as 
into savage life, the rudiments of sanitary civilization." 
129 
THE PRINCIPLES ON WHICH THE 
RESTORATION OF ANCIENT BUILDINGS SHOULD 
BE CONDUCTED.
By the Rt. Hon.
G. C.
BENTINCK, M.P., Judge Advoc.
Gen.
(Read at Whitehaven.) 
The restoration of architectural buildings is a matter entirely 
different from the architecture itself.
I can only regret that 
circumstances over which I had no control prevented me from 
delivering the paper last year, as I had intended ; because then I 
could have spoken freely upon the subject, and could have given 
you ideas which you would believe, no doubt, as I believe them, 
to be my own.
But since that time the subject of the restoiation 
of architectural buildings has so occupied the mind of the artistic 
world and the public, that floods of literature have been poured 
forth — literature which is due not only to some of the highest and 
most distinguished names upon the roll of the artistic profession, 
but also to gentlemen who are not professionally artists, but interest 
themselves in such subjects.
Therefore, I am very much afraid 
what will come from me will almost appear second-hand.
At all 
events, it will have this disadvantage, that I shall be obliged to 
recapitulate to you (not, I hope, at any great length) the position 
in which the question now finds itself, beginning with the campaign 
opened last year with a duel between the late Sir Gilbert Scott and 
Mr. Stevenson, and which wound up before they went into winter 
quarters with what was called the battle of St. Alban's — the 
controversy which has taken place as to how and in what manner 
10 
130 
the new cathedral of St. Alban's is to be restored.
It is from that 
point I proceed to start.
In opening this paper I feel that I need hardly detain 
you at any length upon the origin and development of " Restor- 
ation," for those amongst you who are conversant with the 
mere elements of the question will be aware that its primary 
cause was due to the so-called Gothic revival— which took place 
some thirty-five years ago, and which spread like wildfire through 
Europe amongst the clergy and laity of all denominations.
Nor 
was such a result in any way surprising ; for after the dormant 
state in which ecclesiastical affairs had remained for at least three- 
quarters of a century, it was only natural that a period of bustle 
and commotion should follow, and the reasonable hope of Art was 
that when the time for change came, it might be brought about by 
a true spirit of regeneration ; but, unfortunately, the actual reaction 
was caused, not by calm and logical conviction, but by prejudice 
and passion ; not by thought and knowledge, but by contracted 
views and ascetic enthusiasm ; and thus the new movement, bereft 
of any wise controlling power, burst all limits of restraint, and 
carried devastation and destruction throughout the length and 
breadth of its course.
It is the fashion amongst the later writers 
on this subject to ascribe to the clergy the chief blame for the 
origin of that mischief, which is now admitted by all parties in the 
controversy to have been done either in a greater or less degree.
It is not my province to absolve the clergy from any offences which 
they may have committed, but in common fairness I must honestly 
say that if they have erred in an architectural sense, they may 
claim most illustrious and powerful laymen as accomplices, for in 
the very earliest days, when the frenzy for restoration began to 
make head, two most capital crimes against ancient buildings were 
committed by legislators and lawyers.
I will state to you briefly the facts upon which I rely to prove 
the truth of this allegation.
When the Palace of Westminster had 
to be rebuilt, after the fire of 1833, the taste of the Lords and 
Commons determined to adopt a style of architecture in imitation 
of the Gothic of the Tudor age.
An architect of great abilities 
131 
was appointed to execute the ungrateful task ; and whatever may 
have been his shortcomings, his bitterest foes must allow that he 
fooled his employers to the top of their bent.
It would now be 
irrelevant to attempt any detailed criticism of this vast structure ; 
but while I admit the ingenuity and resource of the architect, and 
agree with Mr, Ferguson that it is the most successful attempt 
which has been made in our time to apply mediaeval architecture 
to civil purposes, I must protest that the whole building is simply 
an adaptation of other men's ideas without one detail which has 
any pretension to originality.
The fittings, furniture, and other 
accessories are standing examples to posterity what they ought to 
avoid.
Everything is ground down to the lowest level of manufac- 
ture, and yet everything is to match.
The effigies of the Royal 
personages of the present age are disguised in the costume of the 
Henrys.
The roofs, walls, and floors are covered with inscriptions 
which no human intelligence can decipher, and which seem to be 
intended by the architect as a satire upon the ignorance and 
credulity of those who insisted upon such an undertaking.
Similar follies are common enough in these days, and are 
perhaps excusable, but the inexcusable was the wanton destruction 
of the ancient chapel of St. Stephen's, and its conversion into a 
feeble, commonplace, "perpendicular Gothic" waiting hall, further 
degraded by the introduction of white marble statues of departed 
statesmen in the costume of their respective ages ; and these by 
contorted limbs and rueful countenances plainly express their 
disgust at being exhibited in situations so entirely inappropriate.
Let me here add, though I break my chronology, the particulars 
of another atrocity which, during the last ten years, has been 
committed within these time-honoured precincts.
Underneath 
St. Stephen's Chapel there exists a crypt, which, although for a 
time in use as the Speaker's state dining-room, still retained 
important remains of its former self It was a dark sequestered 
spot, and might easily have escaped the chisel and paint brush of 
the destroyers.
But, unfortunately, the First Commissioner of 
Works under Lord Palmerston's Government was "a man of taste," 
and he induced the House of Commons to vote a large sum for 
132 
the so-called restoration of the crypt.
It is true that a few Members 
of Parliament condemned these proceedings, and protested against 
them — but their efforts were in vain.
The omnipotent power of 
"taste" overwhelmed their opposition, and by an enormous majority 
of voices this inestimable relic was handed over to the pupils of 
South Kensington and decorating tradesmen, and by them painted, 
polished, burnished, furnished, gilded, glazed, and tiled, so that 
every ancient feature was successfully obliterated, and the new 
chapel placed upon an artistic level with Madame Tussaud's 
Museum or the transformation scene of a Christmas pantomime.
And yet even now the members of the House of Commons do not 
repent these enormities; on the contrary, they seem to approve 
them,.
for scarcely a day during their Session passes but that con- 
stituents and friends are conducted to this dimly illuminated vault, 
where they are told that it is one of the prettiest sights in London, 
and well worth its extravagant cost.
The blaze of modern manu- 
facture absorbs the wonder of these open-mouthed visitors, but it 
never occurs to them to consider whether the new lamp is of more 
value than the old.
While Parliament was thus employed, the heads of the legal 
profession were following their bad example.
The old Temple 
Church was one of the most interesting monuments our country 
possessed.
Its restoration was decreed, and carried into effect in 
the most barbarous fashion possible.
The exterior is now entirely 
new, and the interior scraped, polished, painted, and glazed, so 
that it is utterly impossible to discover any detail that a Knight 
Templar ever beheld ; the interesting monuments, the records of 
various ages, have been removed to inaccessible and even ridiculous 
positions, and, in short, what has been done amply justifies a 
remark made some years ago by an able critic, "that if the 
Benchers must needs have a showy and luxurious chapel, they 
should have built one for themselves, and have left the old Templars 
and their historic church quietly alone." 
While the Legislature and the lawyers were thus playing ducks 
and drakes with the monuments under their charge, it is not 
surprising that the prevailing epidemic should rage with unlimited 
133 
fury amongst the clergy.
Next to building a new church in the 
approved style of the day, their passion was to restore the edifices 
under their control, and the Anglican ecclesiastics having, for the 
most part, no artistic education, and neither the patience nor the 
humility to learn, and inspired, moreover, only by sentiment and 
narrow ideas, thus fell an easy prey to speculating architects, 
decorators, and furniture dealers ; and under the influence of these 
interested guides, a crusade was preached against all art subsequent 
to the time of the Edwards ; and much that was good and true 
within and without the churches was rooted out, in order to sub- 
stitute the wares of the ecclesiastical toy-shops.
It is essential that I should briefly place before you the actual 
outcome of this superstition, because literally it was nothing else, 
and for this purpose will quote an extract from an article written 
in October, 1877, by Mr. Colvin, Slade Professor of Art in the 
University of Cambridge, who puts the salient points in language 
infinitely better than any I can command.
Professor Colvin 
writes, with reference to Church restoration, that the average 
practice is something like this : First, the seating of the church is 
taken up ; the church is partly lined with oak panelling, enriched 
in the chancel with fluted pilasters and Corinthian capitals and 
elaborate pediments ; and if there is a carved oak pulpit of the 
same date and style, and a communion table of old carved oak, 
all these fittings must go — they are pagan, they are barbarous, fit 
only to be broken up or sold.
Then, the whole floor comes up ; 
the funeral stones are thrown aside and broken, the brasses are 
removed and put against the wall in some out-of-the-way part of 
the aisle.
There are monuments in memory of village celebrities 
and the ancestors of local magnets, chiefly in the form of tablets 
let into the walls, some of the chancel, some of the aisle.
From 
the chancel they are cleared out altogether ; in the aisle, perhaps 
one or two are left ; and if there is a mutilated recumbent effigy of 
the period allowed as "ancient," it is preserved for repiecing and 
repainting.
The windows are filled with white glass, interspersed 
with a few scraps of old coloured, saved at the Reformation, and 
with a few coats of arms and other simple transparencies added 
lU 
later : this glazing is all cleared away.
Then, as to the fabric of 
the building itself, a second aisle will be thrown out ; or the nave 
lengthened by one or two bays, so as to swallow up the old 
chancel, and a wholly new chancel will be added.
This new work 
will be added in Early English, Middle Pointed, or Decorated, 
with 'characteristic' features designed by the architect in accord- 
ance, more or less, with some portion of the old building which he 
takes for his clue; but very seldom in Perpendicular, which is 
understood to have been but a debased development, of the Gothic 
style.
[Perhaps I might mention to those not intimately acquainted 
with these things, that Perpendicular Gothic was the architecture 
of the Gothic order which prevailed in this country during the 15th 
and the latter part of the 14th century.] As, however, the Perpen- 
dicular period was one of the most active in English architecture, 
many portions of the building are sure to date from it ; the flat- 
pitched roof, succeeding an earlier steep-gabled one— the east 
window, most likely — the clerestory openings, it may be — one or 
both aisles, or at any rate most of their window tracery ; and to all 
these portions small tenderness will be shown.
The flat roof is 
altogether removed, and a new steep roof, groined and ribbed or 
barrel- vaulted, is substituted, a new "open timbered roof" of 
stained deal, usually as paltry in design as in material ; the Perpen- 
dicular tracery in the openings, on the least excuse of decay or 
even without it, is replaced by new geometrical tracery.
Externally, 
the walls, if they have been plastered, are stripped of their plaster, 
the stonework or brickwork is scraped and repointed, the coigns 
renewed, a porch, very likely, of quaint local design is removed, a 
pretty wooden belfry with a quaint weathercock, is replaced by 
one of the Gothic design ; the whole outside is made to look trim, 
complete, uniform, 'correct.' Internally, a similar stripping and 
scraping goes on ; coats of whitewash, layers of lath and plaster, 
are removed, in order that the stone or brickwork may be exposed 
and repointed.
In the process, fragments of overlaid features, of 
primitive and succeeding dates, come to light ; if any one of these 
features work into the new plan, an imitation of the whole feature 
is set up, with the fragment incorporated in the imitation, in the 
135 
place to which the original belonged.
Finally, the fabric, with all 
the evidences of its later history removed, though with a few of 
those of its earlier history, in fortunate cases, recovered — 
transformed here into a fabric — avowedly new, there into one 
professedly the model of its former self — is made ready for its new 
fittings, and receives them in the shape of open seating, machine- 
carved, in staine'd deal, with Gothic finials ; a new pulpit, carved 
in a proper Gothic taste, of Bath or Caen stone ; subscription 
windows in stained glass of the most approved modern mediaeval 
design ; a smooth laid floor, with richly patterned tiles for the 
chancel ; new Gothic altar-rails in brass ; a fine reredos, if sub 
scribers have again been Uberal, of marble or alabaster and mosaic 
in place of the old Ten Commandments ; a new altar and rich 
embroidered altar-cloth ; new iron gas-fittings, save the mark of 
Gothic colouring and design, and all the rest of the proper 
and approved appointments." 
These observations may be taken to sum up the leading 
allegations of an indictment against that destructive restoration 
which became so general when the success of the Gothic revival 
was established, that Sir Gilbert Scott, the acknowledged chief of 
the Anglo-Goths, the creator, in fact, of the modern Frankenstein 
which has since appalled and bewildered its constructors, published 
from time to time a series of manifestoes — the first dated as far 
back as 1841 — against the course of Vandalism, which had, as he 
said, justly made the very word " restoration " a byeword and a 
reproach, and had robbed England of a large portion of her 
"antiquities." I could refer to many extracts from Sir Gilbert 
Scott's writings, all expressing, at great length, the same censures 
and same sentiments at various periods, but I will give you a few 
extracts, sufficient only to estabhsh my point.
I have already cited 
the passage of 184 1, and here is another : — "I have long and most 
painfully felt that the modern system of radical restoration is doing 
more towards the destruction of ancient art than the ravings of 
fanaticism, or the follies of churchwardens have succeeded in 
effecting.
The existence and authenticity of these invaluable relics 
is invaded on both sides," Then, in 1873, he says : — "Our old 
136 
buildings too often — nay, in a majority, I fear, of cases — fall into 
the hands of men who have neither knowledge nor respect for 
them, while, even amongst those who possess the requisite know- 
ledge, there has too often existed a lack of veneration, a disposition 
to sit in judgment on the works of their teachers, a rage for alter- 
ation." In 1874, in his opening address to the Royal Institute of 
British Architects, and referring to Mr. Ruskin^ Sir G.
Scott 
writes : — " If he (Mr. Ruskin) travels in France, he finds restor- 
ation so rampant that nothing which shows much of the hand of 
time is considered worthy of continued existence, but must be 
re-worked or renewed, cleverly, artistically, and learnedly perhaps, 
but nevertheless it is netv work taking the place of the old work, 
or the old work re-tooled till scarce a vestige of the surface on 
which the old men wrought so lovingly is allowed to remain.
If 
he goes into Italy, much the same meets his eye.
In his own 
Venice the "Fondaco dei Turchi," the most venerable secular 
Byzantine work, is rebuilt.
At Assisi he would find the works of 
Cimabue and Giotto in the hands of the restorer.
In Belgium he 
would find ancient buildings chipped over and made to look like 
new ; or, as is the case with the wonderful church of the Domini- 
cans, at Ghent, deliberately destroyed." And so forth.
Then, in 
1874 — four years ago only — Sir Gilbert Scott expressed himself 
thus : — "Taking a review of the results of this sad history, one 
may say that a certain proportion of our churches have been 
carefully dealt with ; another proportion treated with fair intention 
but less success ; but that, as I fear, the majority are almost utterly 
despoiled, and nine-tenths, if not all, of their interest swept away." 
And again : — " We receive, from time to time, appeals to our 
committee for the conservation of ancient monuments against 
vandalisms which one would think incredible ; and only within the 
last few days I have heard of one clergyman selUng to a grocer 
one of the old chained-up books which he thought would disfigure 
his 'restored' church ; and of another expelUng a famous series of 
brasses to secure the uniformity of encaustic tile floor ; while one 
hears of noblemen of the highest names who make over the 
nomination of architects for the restoration of the churches on 
137 
their estates as a piece of patronage which is the perquisite of 
their agents." These are some of the many passages in Sir Gilbert 
Scott's writings, which I could read to you, but time compels me 
to quit this branch of the subject.
These were brave words, no doubt ; but whether Sir Gilbert 
Scott was not strong enough to resist the pressure and temptations 
which his lucrative professional engagements brought upon him, or 
whether he was of an irresolute and vacillating disposition, it is 
absolutely certain that he failed to practice the doctrines which he 
preached with such energy and fervour, for his deplorable restor- 
ations of many of our cathedrals (Salisbury to wit), and of the 
innumerable parochial and other valuable churches, date subse- 
quently to these fruitless protests.
Again, the brutal war which has been waged by Mr. Butterfield 
and others against Sir Christopher Wren's original and beautiful 
churches in the City of London was initiated by Sir Gilbert Scott, 
who long after he had so unreservedly denounced the evils of 
radical restoration, led the attack by his transformation of the 
elegant Church of St. Michael, Cornhill, daubing the interior with 
glaring and vulgar paint, filling the windows with clumsy and 
inappropriate tracery, and disfiguring the bold and noble tower — 
one of the most happy inventions of modern genius — with an 
ill-shaped and ill-executed Gothic porch which has no meaning 
whatever, except, perhaps, to prove how idle it is for the pigmy to 
measure himself with the giant.
Reverting to Sir Gilbert Scott's injudicious meddling with 
mediaeval monuments, I would observe that such of us who have 
been connected from our youth with Westminster and its famous 
Abbey, or who are intimately acquainted with the details of that 
unsurpassed structure, can never cease to regret the day when Sir 
Gilbert Scott became its surveyor, and was permitted to run riot 
at the expense of the governing collegiate body, whose blind 
confidence in their architect far exceeded their knowledge of his 
art.
Happily, not much has been done ; but with the exception, 
perhaps, of the rebuilding of the Chapterhouse, all that has been 
done is bad.
Externally, the south transept has been renovated 
138 
in a style so cumbrous that the enormous stone pinnacles or 
pyramids, raised to an undue and useless height, entirely destroy 
the proportions of the south side of the church, whether the point 
of view be taken near or far.
In fact, what we see now positively 
makes us regret the loss of the former simple and unpretending 
design which was erected some years before Sir Christopher Wren 
was the Abbey surveyor, and which was only quaint and not 
positively ugly.
The interior alterations are of about the same 
average artistic value.
The new altar screen, with its four lanky, lean, 
staring statues, and ill-proportioned cedar altar table in Roman- 
esque detail, are decidedly inferior in design to its predecessor ; 
but the maximum of absurdity has been attained in Henry VII.
Chapel, where, on the site of the old high altar, a new altar table 
has been set up, resting upon legs formed of gilt wood pilasters, 
which are copies of the metal pilasters in Torrigiano's tomb of 
Henry VII., but which, when applied to a purpose other than their 
legitimate use, are, as a matter of course, ridiculous.
Last, but not least, in this Catalogue of Westminster mishaps, 
comes the restoration of the historical Jerusalem Chamber, the 
ancient parlour of the" abbots of Westminster, where the upper 
walls and ceilings are covered with childish painting and tawdry 
decoration, and the apartment heated by a flaunting and glaring 
pseudo-Gothic apparatus, which would disgrace any Pimlico 
lodging-house.
Moreover, at the time of his death Sir Gilbert 
Scott was combining and confederating with the Dean of Canter- 
bury to get rid of the well-known choir stalls of Canterbury 
Cathedral, attributed, and I believe truly, to Grinling Gibbons.
The Dean, who is but little skilled in architecture, considered 
these stalls not Gothic enough for his taste, so he threw over the 
Cathedral surveyor and some of his capitular colleagues who 
wanted to leave well alone, and^summoned Sir Gilbert Scott ; but 
Sir Gilbert, instead of protesting against the ^Decanal act of 
Vandalism, became, notwithstanding all his sentimental writings, 
an accomplice before the fact, and induced the Dean and Chapter 
to adopt an extravagant scheme of his own, whereby he proposed 
to let loose a barbarian horde of painters, glaziers, and scrubbers, 
139 
to replace excellent original pure English stalls by a poor imitation 
of what his lively imagination persuaded him had existed in the 
same place at the beginning of the 14th century.
From my own personal knowledge I am able to add that in 
1874, when a scheme, which was prepared by Mr. Burgess, for the 
complete destruction of the interior of St. Paul's Cathedral, and 
the substitution of a vulgar and feeble design of his own.
Sir 
Gilbert Scott was not only a consenting party to the project, but 
also its active supporter, and gave his voice in that sense whenever 
a vote was taken in the committee.
Indeed, at the last moment, 
when the force of public opinion was being brought to bear to 
rescind a decision, in accordance with the views of the clerical 
element of the committee, to commence the work at once.
Sir 
Gilbert Scott was whipped up to swell the ranks of the destructive 
faction, and responded to the call.
When, therefore, the recognized 
leader of the modern Gothic, " our greatest church restorer," as Sir 
Edmund Beckett styles him in his " Book on Building," was doing 
these things, and encouraging by his example men of less experience 
and ability than himself to the like, it is not surprising that the 
lovers of genuine art should at last be aroused to arrest the progress 
of mischief, and concentrate their forces upon some coign of 
vantage whence an effectual resistance might be offered.
Tewkesbury Abbey was the straw that broke the camel's back, 
and gave the first signal for action.
Mr. William Morris having 
seen in the newspapers that this noble building was about to be 
handed over for sacrifice to Sir Gilbert Scott, addressed a strong 
remonstrance to the Athenceum newspaper, and suggested that an 
association should at once be set on foot to keep a watch on old 
monuments, and for their general protection.
The publication of 
this letter led to a meeting which was held on the 22 nd March, 
1877, and which was attended by a number of highly influential 
gentlemen, and then and there the Society for the Protection of 
Ancient Buildings first saw the light, with the object specified in 
the prospectus of the Society, which is too long for me to read, 
but which I have taken care shall be accessible to all.
The new 
Society grew rapidly both in strength and numbers.
Its proceed- 
140 
ings became so important that it raised a controversy within the 
solemn precincts of the R.
I. B.
A. itself, where the campaign was 
opened by a paper read by Mr. Stevenson, a distinguished architect, 
on 28th May last.
The subject was continued on the nth June, 
by Sir Gilbert Scott, who read at great length a reply to Mr.
Stevenson.
After the reading of this last paper, a discussion 
followed, conducted by those who were called upon by the 
President.
I do not propose to give you any extracts from Mr.
Stevenson's and Mr. Gilbert Scott's interesting discourses, because 
they are in print, and you can read them for yourselves.
But I 
will briefly observe that Mr Stevenson holds the extreme view 
that we should leave our churches alone, keep them in repair, keep 
out the wet, underpin a sinking wall, or build a buttress and keep 
the wall from sinking.
" Why," Mr. Stevenson asks, " should not 
our children have the chance of seeing what an old English church 
used to be like, with its high oak pews and galleries, and old 
monuments left on the walls, as all churches used to be forty years 
ago, such a church as David Copperfield used to go to ?
Would 
such, even allowing the old three-decker pulpit to remain, be quite 
incompatible with Christian worship ?
Why this haste to destroy 
it ?
It is because they feel that unless the work is done speedily 
the feeling may be changed, and people may discover that in 
purging England of her characteristic old churches, they have 
made a mistake." Sir Gilbert Scott, on the other hand, in his 
reply, adopted a tone of great moderation, and based his observ- 
ations entirely upon the principle of what he called conservative 
restoration, and had not the works then actually in progress under 
his hand been so entirely contradictory to the opinions he expressed, 
I, for one, could not have disagreed with him.
But the pith of 
the whole controversy is to be found in the discussion which 
followed the reading of the papers, and it is upon what was then 
said by the Fellows and visitors present, and notably by Mr.
Street, Mr. Stevenson, Mr. Poynter, and Sir Edmund Beckett, 
that I shall found the practical portion of the task I have under- 
taken, which is to explain to you my views with regard to the 
Ul 
principles to be observed in the restoration of churches and other 
buildings.
Now, the impression which the early stage of the debate at 
the Institue left upon my mind, was that of a heavy cannonade 
between professional gentlemen who were very angry with one 
another, and who were only restrained from personalities, and 
perhaps something worse, by the grave and respectable character 
of the assembly in which they found themselves at the time ; 
but when the intensity of the firing had somewhat slackened, one 
of the most experienced and well-abused restorers, Mr. Street, 
R.A., made a long speech, with which I, though I seldom find 
myself in agreement with him on architectural topics, could find 
but little fault.
Mr. Street stated his views upon the proper mode 
of restoration to be as follows : — ist.
That the walls, columns, and 
arches of a building should be thoroughly repaired.
2nd.
That 
the walls should be kept plastered wherever an old surface of 
plaster was found.
3rd.
That screens, stalls, and other old artistic 
work, removed by ignorant persons, should, if practicable, be put 
back in their original places.
4th.
That though he saw no objec- 
tion to the restoration of stone work originally executed by 
common masons, he would never sanction the restoration of 
anything which was the work or had the mark of an individual 
artist.
"All such work as the restoration of walls, painting on 
walls, carvings, sculpture, and the like, he thought ought never to 
be touched or altered at all.
It was precious because it embodied 
the handiwork and thought of a single artist, and lost all its interest 
and value in restoration." 
Now, these propositions coinciding substantially with my own 
ideas, when I was called upon by the President, without any 
previous notice, to address the Institute, very briefly I ventured to 
give an opinion, " that while it was perfectly justifiable to sweep 
away what was utterly bad and devoid of any artistic merit, what 
was original and good ought always to be preserved ;" and in 
illustration of my position, I referred to the much-vexed question 
of the Canterbury Cathedral stalls, to which I have already called 
your attention.
I was shortly afterwards followed by Mr. Poynter, 
142 
R.A., who carries — as from his high reputation he deservedly 
should — great weight amongst the modern school, and he was 
good enough to say : " Perhaps the best thing that has been said 
on the subject this evening fell from Mr. Bentinck [here is the 
report, that you may satisfy yourselves that I am reading what was 
actually said], who said that whether an anachronism should be 
preserved or swept away depended entirely on whether it was in 
itself a good or a bad work of art.
But, unfortunately, to decide 
between what is good and what is bad is the question, and it is 
here that the difficulty lies.
On this matter of the Canterbury 
stalls, for instance, there are evidently two opinions.
I myself 
decidedly hold Mr. Bentinck's view, that they should be preserved.
The reason why the new Society sets its face against a restoration, 
is because they fear that the enthusiasm of the restorer might 
remove that which is in itself valuable, although it may be an 
anachronism in regard to style." 
Now, if discussion had stopped here, the principles asserted 
by Mr. Street and Mr. Poynter, as experts, and by myself, as a 
humble inexpert, might have been taken to command the assent 
of the majority of those present; but immediately after Mr.
Poynter had concluded, Sir Edmund Beckett — well known as a 
voluminous writer on architecture — entered the arena.
His observ- 
ations will not, I think, add to his reputation as a critic, but for 
my present purpose it is fortunate he made them, because I am 
now enabled to place before you with tolerable clearness the main 
issue which arises out of this pro and anti restoration controversy, 
and which, in my view, should control the action of those who 
have the power of the purse.
Sir Edmund Beckett said : " I am 
not so fomiliar with Canterbury Cathedral as Mr. Bentinck, but I 
should not advocate the keeping of Italian work in a Gothic build- 
ing unless it was something very exceptionally good.
Mr. Bentinck 
said he would lay down the principle of keeping everything 
' that was good ; ' but when you turn this principle into practice 
we have to answer the question — What is good?
That is just 
where people differ; and this shows the folly of attempting to 
settle these things by principles." And further on Sir Edmund 
143 
Beckett said: "The work of restoration" (he was alkiding to 
St. Alban's Cathedral) " cannot be done without a great deal of 
actual rebuilding and imitating old work as well as we can, which 
I boldly avow is the proper mode of restoring work which is 
partially decayed, so that the old and new may look continuous 
and complete.
I utterly deride all the nonsense that is talked 
about the baseness of imitation and copying, In such cases it is 
the only proper mode of restoration." 
Now, to begin with, you will perceive Sir Edmund Beckett 
denies you can settle by any principle "what is good." Any 
attempt to do so he says is "foolish." But I differ from him, and 
I think I can state a principle which will stand any test that 
common sense can reasonably suggest.
It may be difficult, no 
doubt, in any high condition of refinement, either of art or manu- 
facture, to lay down dogmatically "what is good" or otherwise; 
but when an art is either lost, or has fallen to the depths of 
degradation to which architecture and decoration have descended 
in our time — not only in England, but all over Europe ; when our 
churches are daily dealt with after the manner of Salisbury 
Cathedral, and our domestic buildings decorated in the fashion 
lately adopted at the Carlton Club ; when we consider the "fiasco' 
of the late Exhibition of Paris as regards original productions, 
then " what is good " becomes a relative rather than a positive 
term, and may be fairly held to apply not to the labour of common 
workmen, but to "every original work of every individual artist" 
from the earliest time down to the present day.
This is the prin- 
ciple which I endeavoured to assert at the meeting of the R.I.B.A., 
and to illustrate by a reference to the case of the Canterbury stalls, 
already explained to you.
And now I submit with some confidence 
that this principle, approved as it was in the main by both Mr.
Street and Mr. Poynter, is not foolish, but sensible.
The most 
important proposition laid down by Sir Edmund Beckett, and 
most germane to the subject before us, is, however, really contained 
in the last paragraph which I have quoted from his speech, where 
he says, " The proper mode of restoring work partially decayed is 
by imitating the old work as well as we can, so that the old and 
144 
new may look continuous and complete, and that the alleged 
baseness of imitation and copying was all nonsense." 
This proposition embodies in substance the ideas of the 
ultra-restorationists, amongst whom I must include, after what 
has been alleged and proved, Sir Gilbert Scott and his followers, 
and it admits that the real may be levelled down to the unreal, the 
true to the sham, and justifies any amount of tampering with 
precious but decayed monuments of art, provided always that they 
are manipulated into continuous and complete harmony with the 
coarse and inanimate manufactures of the modern Gothic workman.
If these doctrines are to prevail, the activity and energy of modern 
painters and decorators will be subject to no restraining force.
Once teach them that it is lawful to make old and new work 
continuous and complete, and that the baseness of imitation and 
copying is all nonsense, they will continue to cut, pare, daub, and 
destroy so unmercifully that the few churches which have hitherto 
escaped their hands will speedily share the fate of their fellows.
Besides, if the principle is admissible with regard to architectural 
details and sculpture, it must also apply to painting; and then we 
may well enquire, where is the mischief to stop 1 
Mr. Poynter was, to my mind, very satisfactory and quite 
unanswerable when he said, "where a church exists from 
medifeval times without any paintings, I hold strongly that any 
attempt to supply them as they would have done in the 13th or 
14th centuries would be quite out of place, simply because 
it is impossible to reproduce the spirit in which these paintings 
were done.
The architect may produce a very good imitation, but 
he cannot produce the same thing.
It would be an attempt to 
put into a church something which has no reality;" and thus Mr.
Poynter not only disposed of Sir E.
Beckett, but hit an obvious 
blot in Sir G.
Scott's system, which in ail principal cases, as, for 
instance, Salisbury Cathedral, involved a large amount of painting, 
executed not by artists, but by workmen employed under contracts 
entered into with decorating firms.
A circumstance, which occurred to me in my youth, and 
which I will venture to relate to you, led me long ago towards the 
145 
impression I now strongly entertain, that this fashion of imitating 
and copying imperfect things is altogether based upon a false idea.
Thirty years since I was a good deal in Rome, and there I made 
the acquaintance of the Jesuit fathers who then had the care of the 
"Collegio Romano." One of the Society, Padre Macchi, was a 
distinguished and learned antiquarian, and he invited me to 
accompany him to the catacombs of St Agnese, which had then 
lately been discovered, and which contained the most interesting 
relics of early Christian art then extant.
On the road we passed 
the villa of the well-known banker.
Prince Alexander Torlonia, who 
was, I believe, really of Jewish extraction, but who had lately been 
ennobled by the Pope, and had married a lady of the historical 
family of Colonna.
This villa had been fitted up and adorned 
with all modem means and appliances which wealth could supply, 
and amongst other ornamental work the Prince had erected in the 
grounds miniature copies of some of the best known ruins in 
Rome, such as the Colosseum, Temple of Peace, &c.
As we 
drove by, one of my Jesuit friends called my attention to these 
things, saying with a satirical smile, " Guardi, Signore, I'Antichita 
Modema" — that is, "Observe, sir, the modern antiquity," and his 
companion, referring to the Prince, quietly muttered "Stupido," 
a word I need not translate.
With this criticism I then cordially 
agreed, and I agree with it now.
Rely upon this, that whether the 
scene be in Italy or England, and whether the subject be Roman 
ruins or Gothic remains, imitation is base in both cases, and the 
wholesale fabrication of mediaeval shams, so common with the 
"greatest church restorer," merits the identical censure which was 
pronounced by my Jesuit friends upon Prince Torlonia for doing 
what he thought very clever, but which was exactly the reverse.
Now, it is to oppose these pernicious notions that the efforts 
of the anti-restoration party are mainly directed.
There are, as 
must be the case in so wide a field of ideas, " anti-restoration ists" 
and "anti-restorationists." There are those who think with Mr.
Stevenson that nothing ought to be done "beyond mere upholding"; 
others there are who concur with Mr. Street, that, while removals 
and changes, either whole or partial, are in many cases justifiable, 
U 
U6 
and even desirable, yet that no work of an individual artist ought 
ever to be touched at all.
And, again, a third opinion exists, which I will explain more 
fully before I conclude.
But first let me lead you to the results 
which must ensue if either the plan of Mr. Stevenson or that of 
Mr. Street be adopted without considerable modification.
If Mr.
Stevenson wins the day, notwithstanding that I entirely go with 
him in his effort to exorcise the demon of restoration, and agree 
that the picture he has so ably drawn of the ravages committed by 
his opponents is not over-coloured in any material particular ; yet 
to hold that ourselves and our posterity must for all time submit to 
contemplate the barbarism which ignorant hands have perpetrated 
in our old churches in times past without emotion, and either to 
sit in high pews while our church services are performed in three- 
deckers, or retire for all time, is a proposition to which I, for one, 
cannot assent ; and on the last point, for this additional reason, 
because the architect who, to the best of my belief, both Mr.
Stevenson, and I myself, recognise to be the greatest England 
ever produced (I allude to Sir Christopher Wren), was as strongly 
opposed to the erection of pews as any church architect of the 
present day.
His opinion is contained in a short but interesting 
paragraph from his suggestions to the Commissioners for Building 
New Churches, under the Act of Parliament of 1708, and written 
when he was seventy-six years of age.
" A church should not be 
so filled with pews but that the poor may have room enough to 
stand and sit in the alleys, for to them equally is the gospel 
preached.
It were to be wished there were to be no pews, but 
benches; but there is no stemming the tide of profit and the 
advantage of pew-keepers, especially since by pews in the chapel 
of ease the minister is chiefly supported." Thus it is clear that if 
Sir Christopher had been a free agent, he would have rejected 
pews, and it is morally certain that he abhorred three-deckers, 
because I do not think there is any one church of his (at least that 
I have seen) where this inconvenient deformity was part of the 
original design.
Far preferable to this well-intentioned but narrow view is the 
I 
147 
view of Mr. Street, though I do not stop to enquire whether, like 
Sir Gilbert Scott, he has transgressed the rules concerning restor- 
ation which he has himself laid down, though Sir Edmund Beckett 
accuses him of plaster-skinning and other enormities and crimes.
But taking his dictum as it stands to mean that no artistic work 
should be touched at all, it is certainly a safe standpoint, and, 
besides, I suppose no reasonable being, except Mr. Stevenson, 
would quarrel with Mr. Street for his desire to replace in their 
original situations objects of interest and beauty improperly re- 
moved.
But two questions arise, first, whether this limited theory of 
restoration is sufficient to meet and satisfy the aims and the argu- 
ments of the the restorationists, and, secondly, whether it is 
absolutely unlawful, as Mr. Street appears to contend, to touch 
original carving, sculpture, and painting at all.
Now, I boldly 
answer both these questions in the negative, and state my own 
idea to be that, while all botia-fide work, by all artists, whether 
known or unknown, and of whatever age, whether Saxon, Edwardian, 
or Georgian, should be left in its original condition as much as 
possible : still, occasions do arise when restoration is absolutely 
necessary either for preservation or general effect.
For instance, 
in the damp climate of England, and the trying atmosphere of 
London, pictures, gilding, and sculpture must from time to time be 
cleaned.
There really is no alternative.
And when the operation 
has to be performed, the duty of the local authority is to see that 
nothing more is done than the requirements of the case demand.
Works of art also often require restoration, not by way of renova- 
tion, but by replacement of some feature which may be missing, 
and thus the general effect is entirely marred.
Thus, for example, 
it is not \vrong, in my opinion, to give back a nose or a hand to a 
statue which may have been deprived, either wilfully or accidentally, 
of these useful and ornamental members.
This practice was pursued 
wholesale by the great men of the i6th century, including Michael 
Angelo ; and provided the addition be made by artists, and not by 
contractors, I can see no objection.
But in a matter like this it is 
impossible to draw any hard and fast line as to where to begin and 
148 
where to 'end.
Every case must stand on its own merits.
My 
principle is that, where a work is not too far perished by injury or 
decay, important features that are wanting may frequently be 
replaced.
Thus, for instance, it would be preposterous to meddle 
with the Elgin Marbles or the Venus de Milo ; but if the Apollo 
Belvedere, in the Vatican, or the Clytie, in the British Museum, 
lost his or her nose, it would be right to supply a new one.
To 
define, perhaps, the exact theory, is difficult, but the practice is as 
easy as A B C.
I could multiply instances, but I will not weary 
you further.
I can only hope I have sufficiently performed my undertaking 
so as to render what I have said intelligible.
Embracing the 
cause, and accepting, as I do, the main principles of the Anti- 
restoration Society, I cannot side with the extreme party, but I 
desire that, in preserving the treasures of art which our forefathers 
have left us, the voices of reason, common-sense, moderation, and 
expediency should have a full hearing — these treasures of bygone 
days are unfortunately not immortal — like all human creations, 
they must and will decay ; but when the time for restoration comes, 
let that restoration be conservative in the tnie sense of the word.
Let it preserve, but at the same time progress — not seek its 
inspiration from the imperfect efforts of darker ages, but from the 
purer sources flowing from the 15th and i6th centuries, when, for 
the space of a century or more, a race of giants trod all the paths 
of art, and left to future generations the records of their genius, 
and unless a man learns both to appreciate and understand 
them, it is certain he can never do satisfactory work either as an 
artist or as a critic.
A vote of thanks to Mr. Bentinck was proposed by the 
President, who discussed the principles laid down by the author at 
some length.
He was followed by Mr. H.
A. Fletcher and Dr.
I'Anson.* 
Mr. Bentinck, in replying to the points raised in the discussion, 
said : Mr. Russell, ladies and gentlemen, — I have to return you 
* A part of the discussion that followed the Lecture is here given, for the 
sake of the Lecturer's repljr.
149 
my most grateful thanks for the very kind manner in which you 
have been good enough to receive the vote which has been put to 
you.
Before I address the few sentences which will have reference 
to that point, I should like to say just a word in reply to the 
observations that have fallen from Mr. Russell.
Now, Mr. Russell 
has divided the parties to this controversy into three sections.
He 
said there are — first, those who would not have any restoration at 
all ; then, those who wish to restore the buildings as far as possible 
to their original condition ; and then those who would only keep 
the good and reject the bad.
He places me in the last category.
And then he said, as has been said before by some of the highly 
instructed persons to whom I have referred, that it was a matter of 
great difficulty to decide what was good and what bad.
Now, I 
am afraid I did not make myself sufficiently clear on that particular 
point ; therefore I will repeat myself, — ^because I quite understand 
the difficulty Mr. Russell has found and others find in this 
particular matter.
But I said before, and I repeat it now, that the 
question of What is good ?
is a relative term ; and I comprise 
within the term of " What is good " everything that has ever been 
executed by individual artists from the earliest times until now.
Anything, for example, there is of Saxon ornament, or Saxon 
architecture, should not be destroyed : I would keep it ; because 
it has an individual character.
If you go to St. Bees, you will find there, amongst the few 
things that remain at St. Bees Church (most of the older have 
disappeared), but among the few things that remain, there is a very 
curious, ancient doorway, quite of the early part of the twelfth 
century.
That you cannot call a work of art ; but it is a curiosity; 
and that being the work of an individual artist and the expression 
of a particular time — that is a thing I would not, under any 
circumstances, sweep away, any more than I would sweep away 
what I consider to be an excellent work of art of its class — the 
pulpit of St. James' Church, Whitehaven, That is a thing that 
ought not to be swept away; for it is the expression of an 
individual artist and a particular time.
The very stalls of Gibbons, 
which Sir Gilbert Scott was proposing to take away out of Canter- 
150 
bury Cathedral, are an example.
Canterbury Cathedral suffered 
very much during the Great Rebellion.
It was used as a stable 
for cavalry horses, and the whole of the choir fittings were 
practically destroyed.
Then afterwards it was fitted up in very 
beautiful style, partly I think at the expense of Queen Mary the 
Second, and partly at the expense of Archbishop Tenison, who in 
particular presented the Archbishop's throne, which certainly was 
the work of Gibbons, because the Chapter hold his receipt for the 
modest sum of ;^io, which was his remuneration for the work.
But the barbarous task of a Bishop of this Diocese (Bishop Percy), 
who was Dean of Canterbury, first destroyed the sides of the choir 
and the superb organ case (of which a print may be seen in Dart).
Then in my recollection the Archbishop's throne was pulled down, 
to make way for a piece of modern stone rubbish supplied by a 
carver from Belguim, who was supposed to do the thing cheap; and 
then lately Sir Gilbert Scott proposed to take away the choir stalls, 
the last remains of the good work, and to substitute his "modern 
antiquity." And besides all this, in the choir of Canterbury 
Cathedral, which was built by the Norman William of Sens, the 
Corinthian features were not, after all, such an anachronism.
However, I don't wish to trouble you with going over the ground 
I have already travelled.
I only want to make my meaning clear, 
and take leave to repeat that I would comprise in the term "What 
is good !
" everything that is the expression and the work of an 
individual artist.
My friend Dr. I' Anson has been speaking in 
parables.
(Laughter.) I could not quite follow his meaning.
But there is one building in Whitehaven which is certainly 
not a beautiful building — in fact, it is very bad, and without any 
feature of merit.
That is the Old Church of St. Nicholas.
It is 
a hopeless building : really, you can do nothing with it at all.
(Laughter.) But I can illustrate my position by something in that 
church.
Notwithstanding it is, as I say, a hopeless building, I 
think it does contain something which, in my opinion, is good, and 
that is, the carving on the old Lowther pew.
That is not a great 
work, nor a fine work ; but it is a very interesting work, because it 
is the expression of the north country carvers who lived at that 
151 
time, and whose works had merit.
Well, supposing you were 
going to pull down the church or to re-arrange it — supposing you 
could take away the galleries and do anything that was satisfactory 
to the modern idea, nothing in the world ought to make you take 
away that carving.
I wouldn't say keep it upon that pew ; because 
the pew is inconvenient — not at all satisfactory to those who 
occupy it, nor to those who sit around it.
The pew might be 
taken away, but the carving should not be taken from the church.
I would put that in the category of what is good.
In the same 
way, if there was such a thing as a Danish door in a church I 
would keep that — as a curiosity.
I don't attempt, for my present purpose in the present state of 
things — in the present confusion and chaos which architecture is 
in, all over the world — England, of course, included — I wouldn't 
attempt to distinguish between degrees of artistic merit, and say, 
"This is good," and "That is bad." No; if this belongs to a 
period, and is the work of an individual artist, as Mr. Street says, 
there I would keep it.
Now, I think that is a very liberal view of 
the point, and I hope you are in accord with that.
As to anyone 
being able to restore or make things like what they were, that is 
impossible.
If Westminster Abbey were pulled down to-morrow 
you could not build it up again.
It is an agglomeration, as every 
other Cathedral is an agglomeration, of different periods and 
different men's ideas; so that it would be quite impossible to 
recreate them.
You cannot reproduce, as Mr. Poynter said, a 
thing that has ceased to exist in art ; and all these imitations, as I 
humbly conceive, are entirely based on wrong principles and false 
ideas, and I dispose of them by the story I have alluded to of the 
modem antiquity.
Having read you a very long paper, and made 
an exceedingly dull speech, the hour being late, I have to return 
you my best thanks once more for the manner in which you have 
received the vote which has been proposed to you from the chair.

OUR SUMMER VISITORS.
By T.
DUCKWORTH.
(Read at Carlisle.) 
The paper which I intend to read to you to-night, is a short 
account of a few of the birds that visit us in Spring and Summer, 
and leave again in the Autumn ; noting their habits, nidification, 
etc., as taken from personal observation.
I may as well state here, 
that my brother and I have kept a diary for a number of years, 
noting the arrival and departure of our Summer Visitors, and also 
the jflowering of plants ; so that in this paper the dates given are 
taken from the average.
Chiff Chaff (Sylvia hippolais).
The first visitor which I shall introduce to you this evening is 
the Chiff Chaff, or Lesser Pettichaps.
This little bird, the least 
willow wren of Bewick, or the Sylvia hippolais of English naturalists, 
is one of the first to arrive of our visitors, and I like well to hear 
its cheerful note.
I have heard it as early as the 26th of March, 
but as a general rule, from the 6th to the loth of April, and 
it leaves us about the 28th of September.
Its monotonous song of 
chiff chaff, chaff chiff, may be heard in our woodlands, groves, and 
plantations : 
"Chiff chaff, chivey chavey, 
On the ear it comes again ; 
Faint and low, yet soft and pleasant.
Is the gentle strain." 
154 
This it repeats all through the summer and well into the autumn.
We know, too, by this welcome sound, that the spring is fast 
ripening into summer, and that the season of sunshine and flowers, 
and all things bright and beautiful, will soon be here again.
You may- 
hear it in Wetheral and Corby woods, and at Kingmoor, Newbiggin, 
and Gelt, although it is not so widely distributed as its cousin, the 
willow wren.
For one nest of the Chiff Chaff in this district, you 
may find a dozen of the willow wren.
It commences nesting in 
May, building an oval domed nest, which is composed of coarse 
dry grass externally, lined inside with fine fibre and feathers, and 
is generally placed on or near the ground, in a low bush, or in a 
thick tuft of grass, and often amidst the long and intertwining 
weeds and mingled herbage of a bank.
The eggs, six or seven in 
number, are white, speckled at the larger end with purplish red, 
and sometimes speckled nearly all over.
It feeds upon insects — 
caterpillars, aphides, and flies ; and I have also seen it capture 
insects on the wing.
The length of the male is about four inches 
and a half.
Bill, dark drown ; the edges and base of the lower 
mandible pale yellowish red.
There is a pale yellowish brown 
mark over the eye, more or less obscure ; and between the eyes 
and the bill the space is grey ; a narrow circle of grey surrounds 
the eyes.
Head, crown, back of neck, and nape, greenish ash 
colour, or brownish olive, the green almost disappearing in the 
breeding season ; chin, throat, and breast, pale dull yellowish white, 
the yellow colour chiefly in indistinct streaks.
Back greenish ash 
colour, or brownish olive, the edges of the feathers paler than the 
remainder.
The under surface of the wings is grey; greater and 
lesser wing coverts also greenish ash.
The tail, which is rather - 
long, is blackish grey, the feathers bordered with olive green ; the 
side feathers have whitish edges; upper tail coverts brownish 
white, tinged with yellow.
Willow Wren (Sylvia trochilus).
The next bird on my list is the Willow Wren (Sylvia 
trochilus), locally called in this district when I was a boy, " The 
Miller's Thumb." 
i 
15.5 
" Thou fairy bird, how I love to trace 
The rapid flight of thy tiny race ; 
For the wild bee does not wave its wing 
More lightly than thine, thou fairy thing.
" 
Who has not had his attention arrested on some fine spring 
morning, by the gleesome trill of this warbler (whose song, speaking 
as a musician, I should call a slurred descending chromatic scale, 
ending with a final flourish diminuendo), and has not stopped to 
listen to it ?
It is an inhabitant of more northern countries, and 
Mr. Hewitson, in his "British Oology," mentions the delight he 
experienced on hearing its soft sweet note whilst seated within the 
Arctic circle, upon one of the bleak isles of Norway.
This warbler 
makes its appearance in this district about the 13th of April, and 
leaves us about the 25th of September.
The male bird when 
commencing his song, ruffles up the feathers of his throat, which 
gives him rather a peculiar appearance ; and I have often noticed, 
that he sings sweetest and loudest during the time the female is 
sitting ; it also sings whilst on the wing.
Just above the Hyssop Holm well, there was a nest last year 
near the bank top, and close to the public footpath ; and I am also 
happy to state, that it brought up its young in safety, in spite of its 
being in such a public situation.
I have watched it feeding its 
young many a time, standing a few yards off ; and one morning I 
timed its visits to the nest, and I found it fed them on an average 
once every two minutes.
It was curious to watch the cunning 
manner in which the old bird approached the nest to feed them, 
especially when any person was coming nigh : it would drop from 
the tree that overhung the nest, and alight on a little bu.sh a dozen 
yards off, or so, and then run along the grass to the nest, feed its 
young, run back again, and always in a different direction, the 
whole proceeding not lasting many seconds.
Its actions are very 
lively, and I have seen it catch insects on the wing with the same 
address as that of the flycatcher.
Its food appears to be purely 
insectivorous, as I have watched it through the field-glass, and I 
never observed it seize anything but insects, caterpillars, etc.
I 
should consider it one of the gardener's best friends, as far as my 
156 
observation has gone.
When the young are hatched, if you 
approach too near its nest, it becomes very fussy and uneasy, 
calHng in a plaintive querulous manner; although I remember 
when a boy taking a female off the nest even when she was hatch- 
ing, and putting her on again, without her appearing the least 
disturbed.
The Willow Wren builds in May a domed nest, composed of 
dry grass, and lined with feathers.
It lays seven white eggs, 
spotted with red, — although I have seen some very curious 
varieties.
The situation of the nest varies : sometimes on the 
ground, sometimes on hedge banks ; once I found one in a bush, 
and another in an old tin pan at the bottom of a hedge.
The 
length of the male bird is about five inches.
Bill, dusky brown, 
the under mandible pale yellowish brown at the base, its edges 
dusky orange ; those of the upper one paler ; over it is a light- 
coloured yellow streak, fading off backwards into white ; under the 
eye is also an obscure yellow streak, — the yellow colour fades with 
the advance of summer.
Head, on the sides, pale olive colour, or 
greenish grey, with a tinge of yellow ; on the crown, back of the 
neck, and nape, dull olive green ; the neck on the sides is pale 
olivaceous; chin and throat greyish white, streaked with yellow; 
breast silvery white, with a strong tinge of yellow, which fades 
towards the autumn ; back dull pale olive green, fading into greyish 
later in the summer; and the greater and lesser wing coverts 
greyish brown.
The tail is of a greyish brown colour, the feathers 
edged extensively with a yellowish green, though underneath it is 
greyish brown; upper tail coverts dull olive green, under tail 
coverts whitish, strongly tinged with yellow.
The female is a little 
larger than the male, and her colours not so bright ; length, a little 
over five inches.
Sedge Warbler ( Salicaria phragmitis ).
The next visitor claiming our attention is the Sedge Warbler 
( Salicaria phragmitis ).
It visits us about the 26th of April, and 
leaves about the first week in October, staying rather later than the 
I 
157 
greater number of our warblers.
Like most of the true warblers, it 
is insectivorous, and the tall aquatic plants are its game preserves.
There it finds in abundance sprawling water beetles, and spiders, 
and dancing gnats, and dragon flies gleaming in the sun like 
winged emeralds, — and feeds away right merrily.
It is a sweet 
songster, to my fancy, singing all day long nearly, and easily made 
to sing by simply throwing a stone into the bushes.
Many a time 
when fishing by night, have I disturbed the Sedge AVarbler, and set 
him off singing: first a few sharp discordant notes of alarm, and 
then breaking forth into full song, imitating various birds to per- 
fection.
Its singing is very singular as it sounds from the bushes 
at the water side at night, and the angler at that lone hour listens 
with wonder and delight to the pleasant music.
I once heard it 
imitate the chirrup of the house sparrow to such perfection, that I 
thought it was one, till I got a full view of the bird.
I should call 
it a polyglot amongst the warblers; and, according to an article in 
" Science Gossip," it is called in Ireland the Irish nightingale.
It does not, as its name implies, always breed among the 
sedges, as in the dry sandy lanes round Swine Hill, behind the 
County Asylum, I have often found its nests, and also on King- 
moor.
I once found one in Botcherby lane, leading down to the 
water side, at the top of a tall hawthorn hedge.
I may also remark 
a curious piece of nest building, in some hawthorn bushes at Eden 
side.
I discovered a nest with six eggs in it, and through the 
centre of the nest a sharp thorn projected, about three-quarters of 
an inch in length, and the eggs were beautifully placed around it.
How the bird contrived to deposit her eggs without injuring 
herself, has been a puzzle to me ; and as I was never able to 
inspect the nest again that season, I cannot say whether the young 
were hatched successfully or not.
The Sedge Warbler is a very common bird in this district, and 
you may hear three or four any fine summer evening in walking 
over Etterby scaur.
I knew of several nests last season on the 
scaur, within a short distance of each other.
The nest is generally 
built in low bushes, sedges, etc.; it is composed of dry stalks of 
grass, sometimes mixed with a little moss, and lined with fine 
158 
grass, and sometimes a little hair.
The number of eggs is from 
five to seven, of a pale olive colour, sometimes streaked at the 
large end with one or two black lines ; at times it is gregarious 
in its nesting.
My friend Mr. Lancaster and I, while on a 
botanical excursion last summer, discovered eight nests of the 
Sedge Warbler within a few yards of each other.
The length of 
the male is about four inches and three-quarters.
The upper bill, 
broad at the base, is brownish black ; the lower, pale reddish 
brown ; a pale brown streak runs from it to the eye, and a short 
way down the side of the neck.
Iris, brown ; over it is a broad 
yellowish white band, proceeding from the base of the bill.
Head, 
on the crown brownish black, the edges of the feathers streaked 
with light brown ; neck, on the sides, yellowish brown, on the back 
and nape reddish brown, tinged with grey, the middle of each 
feather being dark brown ; chin and throat, nearly white.
Breast, 
brownish white, strongly tinged with yellowish brown on the sides.
Back, above, reddish brown.
Greater and lesser wing coverts, pale 
dusky reddish brown.
The tail, which extends three-quarters of 
an inch beyond the closed wings, and is rather long, straight, and 
slighdy rounded, is dusky brown; upper tail coverts, reddish brown; 
under tail coverts, yellowish brown.
The female resembles the 
male, but is slightly larger, and the stripe on the eye is less 
distinct.
The Blackcap ( Curruca atricapilla).
" The Blackcap, she builds in a bramble bush, 
And a snug little nest she makes ; 
And sweetly her mate singeth near her — hush !
To those musical trills and shakes !
He has caught from the blackbird his rich mellow tone, 
From the skylark his melody shrill ; 
And the notes of the woodlark, the thrush, and his own.
He varies and blends at his will." 
This splendid songster, the sweetest of the warbler family (with 
the exception of the nightingale), arrives in this district about the 
23rd of April, and departs the latter end of September.
It is of 
shy habits, frequenting groves, the borders of woods, parks, plant- 
159 
ations, and orchards, where it conceals itself amongst the foliage.
The song of this bird is very rich, sprightly, warbling and delicate; 
it sings not only by day, but sometimes during the hours of dark- 
ness.
Besides singing its own song, the Blackcap imitates that of 
other birds, and, as I can personally testify, so admirably as to 
deceive the ear of the listener.
Its song is generally given from 
some commanding perch, or if the tree be not very high, from the 
top twig ; or from the top of some large bush.
While the bird is 
trilling, in which it excels every songster of the grove in rapidity 
and clearness, and in the swells and cadences which it gives to the 
same trill, the throat has a strong convulsive motion, and the whole 
bird appears to be worked into a state of great excitement.
It has 
the wildest and most witching notes of all our warblers ; it has not 
the ineffably sweet chaunt of the garden warbler, but its notes take 
us by surprise, and the changes, especially the trills, are finer than 
those of any other bird.
One of its notes is a particularly long 
soft shake, which sinks gradually into the lowest strain, though 
every note is perfectly distinct, till, just as it is dying away, the 
cadence again rises, and swells into a full burst of loud and joyful 
melody.
On our first field day down the Gelt last summer, while 
Mr. Clifton Ward was delivering a short lecture on the sandstone, 
there was a Blackcap carolling most beautifully on a tree hard by.
I don't know whether anybody else noticed it or not, but its song 
rang splendidly in my ears.
A little above Rose bridge, up the Caldew, there is a dense 
overgrown thicket of black-thorn bushes, where a few Blackcaps 
sing and breed.
I recommend any person wishing to hear the 
song of the Blackcap to go there, and I am sure they will not 
regret it.
I remember a few years ago coming from Sebergham 
down by the river side one fine summer evening, stopping for a 
couple of hours entranced, listening to their enchanting melody.
The nest is studiously concealed, and I have known the bird 
desert it after I had inspected it.
It builds amongst the thick 
intertwining bushes of the black thorn, or amidst dense brambles.
It is a well built structure, composed externally of coarse dry stems 
of grasses, and the deserted cocoons of insects ; internally it is 
160 
lined with fine fibre and hair.
The eggs, fi-om four to five in 
number, are of a yellowish brown, with marks of ash grey, and 
spotted with brown ; but I have seen some varieties of a pale 
pinkish colour.
It has the habit of sHpping off the nest in the 
most quiet manner, and scuttHng amongst the herbage like a mouse : 
it reminds me very much of the grasshopper warbler in this respect, 
I have seen the male feed the female when sitting on the nest.
The length of the male is about six inches ; bill, dark horn colour; 
palerbeneath, the edges yellowish grey; iris, dark brown.
Head, on the 
crown, black ; its sides, the neck, on the back, and nape, ash colour ; 
chin, throat, and breast, ash coloured, — but the breast is white on 
the lower part tinged with yellowish grey.
Back, of a brownish 
ash colour.
The female resembles the male, but her plumage is 
more tinged with brown.
Head, on the sides, gray with a greenish 
tinge ; on the crown, reddish brown, reaching further back than in 
the male ; nape, grey, with a greenish tinge.
Back, yellowish 
brown, approaching to white on the centre, and darker on the sides 
and across the breast.
G.\RDEN Warbler ( Curruca hortensis).
The Garden Warbler, or Greater Pettichaps, arrives in our 
district about the 28th of April, a little later than the blackcap, and 
departs about the 26th or 29th of September.
It is not so 
generally distributed as the blackcap, but more localised.
Its 
retiring manners prevent it from being so well known.
When its 
song is heard, it is not given from a commanding perch like the 
blackcap, but from the close cover ; and as the cover is in full 
bloom all the time it is with us, it is not so often seen even by 
those who search for it.
It prefers woody districts, large gardens, 
groves and orchards, and the outskirts of woods.
Insects 
constitute its principal food ; and I have seen the bird capture 
them on the wing, although in the season they are not particular, 
but add currants, ripe cherries, and elder-berries to their bill of fare.
The bird is very sprightly in all its movements, and flits about with 
peculiar gracefulness.
I have watched these birds many a time 
161 
flying from bush to bush, gambolling with each other, and giving 
chase to insects.
The song of the Garden AVarbler is a very sweet 
one; and its notes are perhaps the softest of any that have equal 
compass- -but they are delightful flute-like notes ; and the whisthng 
part of the song, which is about as full and mellow as that of the 
blackbird, has an unbroken swell, which is at once very character- 
istic and peculiar.
Any of my hearers who care to hear the song 
of this bird, may easily do so by taking an early train to Wetheral, 
any fine summer morning, and in the bits of plantation near to the 
Station, by the water-side, may hear them to perfection.
It builds 
early in May. Its nest is very similar to the blackcap, but built 
nearer to the ground in low bushes ; it is composed of dry grasses, 
lined with fine fibrous roots, and sometimes hair, and the edges 
are fastened with dry cocoons of insects' and spiders' webs.
The 
eggs, from four to five in number, are of a yellowish white, spotted 
with light ash grey and olive brown.
The length of the male bird 
is about six inches.
Bill, dusky brown, the base and edges of the 
lower mandible yellow; the inside of the mouth orange.
Iris, 
dark brown, a small space round it being whitish.
Head, on the 
sides, pale brownish ; on the crown, the neck, on the back, and 
the nape, light greyish brown with a faint tinge of olive ; the neck 
on the sides is brownish grey ; chin and throat yellowish white, the 
lower part of the latter and upper part of the breast tinged with 
reddish brown, as are the sides, the remainder yellowish white, 
almost white below.
Tail straight, the feathers narrow, and dusky 
brown in colour; under tail coverts pale greyish brown, the 
margins white.
The female closely resembles the male both in 
size and appearance, but is lighter in colour on the upper part, 
and^more uniformly greyish brown beneath.
Whitethroat (Ctirruca cinerea).
Dear old Peggy, or Nanny Whitethroat, as we used to call it 
in our happy school-boy days.
It is indelibly impressed on my 
memory as being one of the first bird's nests I ever discovered.
I see it now in my mind's eye as I saw it upwards of twenty years 
12 
162 
ago.
The Whitethroat is one of the best known, most numerous, 
and most generally distributed of all our warblers.
It arrives with 
us at the same time as the sedge warbler, and departs about the 
26th of September.
Who has not observed the Whitethroat, in 
walking down some of our old-fashioned lonnings, sitting on the 
top branch of some hawthorn or bramble bush, and swaying him- 
self too and fro ?
Who has not heard his chattering call-note of 
alarm, and seen him flying from spray to spray, singing all the 
time, with the feathers on the top of his head all raised up ?
It is 
a lively, animated bird, always in action ; and though its song is 
hurried and garrulous, its notes are very agreeable.
It rises from 
the twig on which it was perched, and performs a sort of undulating 
dance, on quivering wings, in the air, returning at the close of its 
song to its former resting place.
According to Mr. Sweet, the song 
of this warbler differs much in quality in different individuals ; and 
with respect to this bird, he says : — " It is one of the most 
delightful and pleasing birds that can be imagined.
If kept in a 
large cage with other birds, it is full of antics, flying and frisking 
about, and erecting its crest, singing all the time, so that nothing 
can be more amusing.
It is quite as hardy as the blackcap, and 
if a good one be procured, it is little inferior in song, but in this 
they vary considerably, the wild ones, as well as those in a cage.
I have one now in my possession, one that I have had about 
eleven years, in good health, and singing as well as ever; and 
certainly no song need be louder, sweeter, or more varied.
It is 
of the same temper as the nightingale, never suffering itself to be 
outdone.
It will, indeed, sing for hours together against the 
nightingale : when the nightingale raises its voice, it does the same, 
and tries its utmost to get above it.
Sometimes in the midst of its 
song it will run up to the nightingale, and stretch out its neck as if 
in defiance, staring it in the face ; if the nightingale attempts to 
peck it away, it is in an instant flying round the aviary, singing all 
the time." The food of this bird consists of insects, aphides, 
caterpillars, &c.; also currants, cherries, and elder-berries.
The 
nest is generally placed in some low bush, or among brambles or 
brushwood, and sometimes among nettles, and from this circum- 
163 
stance it is called in some districts the nettle creeper.
It is 
composed externally of dried stems of grasses and leaves, and 
lined inside with fine roots and hair.
The eggs are generally five 
in number, of a greyish or greenish white, speckled with ash grey 
and brown.
The length of the male bird is about five inches 
and a half.
Bill, bluish brown, the base of the under mandible 
yellowish brown, and the corners of the mouth yellowish green ; 
between it and the eye is a tinge of grey; iris, bronze yellow; eye- 
lids, olive brown; over the eye is a streak of yellowish white.
Head, 
on the crown, slate grey ; neck, on the sides, pale brownish grey ; 
on the back and nape lighter greyish brown than the head ; chin 
and throat, silvery white.
Back, reddish brown, but tinged with 
olive in its lower part ; breast, above, pale dull white, tinged with 
rose colour, and on the sides shaded off to yellowish white, and into 
greyish white below.
The female is of duller hue altogether, and 
is nearly without the rose tint on the breast.
Cuckoo (Cuadus canorus).
" How sweet the first sound of the Cuckoo's note, 
Where is the magic pleasure of the sound ?
How do we recall the very tree, 
Or bush near which we stood, when in the air 
The unexpected note — Cuckoo !
again, 
And yet again, came down the budding vale !
It is the voice of Spring among the trees ; 
It tells of lengthening days, of coming blooms ; 
It is the symphony of many a song." 
The Cuckoo is first heard in this district about April 24th, 
and last heard about 28th of June.
The old saying is : — 
In April, come he will ; 
In May, he sings all day ; 
In June, he alters his tune ; 
In July, he prepares to fly ; 
In August, go he must.
There is another old rhyme, which runs thus : — 
164 
When (be Cuckoo cooies to the bare thorn.
Sell your cow, and bay yoor com ; 
Bat when she comes to the fall bit.
Sell your com, and buy your sheep.
The great charm of the Cuckoo's monotonous cr>- lies in its 
associations.
In itself it is not melodious, although Lisle Bowers 
avers it may be strictly harmonious.
He tells us that it is in exact 
accordance with the diatonic scale, of which the two notes com- 
posing the cry are the fifth and third.
In the 7 th volume of the 
Transactions of the Linnean Society, is the following memorandum: 
" The Cuckoo begins early in the season with the interval of a 
minor third, the bird then proceeds to a major third, next to a 
fourth, then a fifth, after which his voice breaks, without attaining 
a minor sixth." It is added that the circumstance bad been 
observed long before — certainly as far back as the publication of 
Heywood's Epigrams, in 1587.
It therefore presents no discord 
to the ear ; nor would it, I believe, if it were not so accordant with 
musical notation, because it generally comes to us mellowed by 
distance, and brings to the mind a flood of recollected and 
anticipated pleasures, like those described in the above p)oetry by 
Graham, as well as in the writings of other poets.
But be that as 
it may, the cry of the Cuckoo is extremely pleasant to most ears 
when first heard ; and all through the season to the time of his 
departure, we love to listen to the far away dreamy kind of call, 
for it seems like an invitation to follow some invisible leader, 
through green woods and flowery vales, and into scenes of 
qtiietude and peace.
The Cuckoo is about fourteen inches in length, — the tail 
measuring seven inches, and the bill about one inch.
The general 
colour of the plimnage is dark ashey grey above, and white beneath, 
with grey undulating lines across; the pinion feathers are dark 
brown, with white spots on the upper web, and the tail feathers are 
black, with oval white spots.
A beautiful iridescent reflection 
pla}-s over the darker parts, such as the head, throat, back, etc 
The efiect of these combinations of sober tints is extremely 
pleasing ; and the long slender form and gliding motion of the 
165 
bird, so perfectly easy and graceful, contribute to the agreeable 
impression which it makes upon the beholder.
More frequently, 
however, is this mysterious visitor — as the bird has been called — 
heard than seen.
Gliding about along the hedgerows, and by the 
skirts of leafy woods and copses, more often in shadow than in 
sunshine, it escapes the notice of any but a watchful and keen- 
sighted observer.
Well might Wordsworth exclaim — 
" O Cuckoo !
shall I call thee bird, 
Or but a wandering voice ?
" 
for the dreamy utterance of its crj', brokenly floating up from the 
wooded hollow near at hand, or coming from afar upon the summer 
air, sounds more like the voice of a spirit than of a bird.
If we 
attempt to follow the sound to the spot from whence it emanates 
we shall fjrobably hear it as though in mocker)' coming from some 
quite opposite direction.
There seems to be hardly any part of 
the country which they do not visit ; for while some remain in the 
southern counties, others settle in the remotest islands of the north; 
and although they are met with in the most cultivated districts 
they also frequent the valleys of the wildest of our hilly and moun- 
tainous districts.
I have heard them frequently in the wild hills 
and mountains of North Wales.
We generally first hear them on 
Kingmoor, Todhills, and Wragmire mosses.
The Cuckoo seems 
to be purely insectivorous, although some wTiters afifirm that it 
sucks birds' eggs.
I have never seen it do so, therefore I can't 
say ; but I once watched one on Wragmire moss feeding for a 
length of time, and when I went to examine what it had been 
feeding on, I found the shattered cocoons of some insects.
The 
stomach of the Cuckoo has often been observed to be densely 
coated internally with hairs, which the microscope proved to belong 
to the larva of the tiger moth (Arctia caja).
We know it builds 
no nest of its own, but drops its eggs in that of other birds.
The Cuckoo seems, according to some observers, to lay more 
than one egg — some say five; and if so, must place them in 
different nests ; and to do this, it appears to use its bill when the 
nest is so placed that it cannot get at it otherwise.
On one 
166 
occasion, a Cuckoo was seen anxiously watching a pair of wagtails 
building their nest ; this did not seem to go on so fast as was 
necessary, for the Cuckoo laid its egg before the nest was finished.
The same observer saw one enter a wagtail's nest, take an egg out, 
and leave its own in.
Mr. Harper, of Norwich, shot a Cuckoo 
with an egg in its beak, searching on the ground for a nest to 
deposit it in.
This bird had another egg in the ovarium, of the 
same size, but without the calcareous covering.
Recently the apparent carelessness of the female Cuckoo for 
her young has found an apologist in a correspondent to " Science 
Gossip," who declares he has repeatedly watched the mother 
occasionally visit the nest in which she laid an egg, and even 
the young Cuckoo, when hatched.
All the eggs of the Cuckoo which I have found have been in 
nests of the meadow pipit ( Anthus pratensis), although I have 
known eggs taken from the hedge accentor, robin, and wagtail's 
nests ; and my brother once took one from the nest of the black- 
headed bunting.
The egg is small in proportion to the size of 
the bird, being generally not much larger than that of its foster 
parent, its average length being from lo to ii-i2ths of an inch, 
its greatest diameter from 8 to 9-i2ths, its colour greyish white, or 
reddish white, speckled with ash grey or greyish brown.
It is very certain that, in spite of the attention that has been 
paid to the Cuckoo by ornithologists, there are few of our native 
birds with which we are less acquainted.
Mudie says : " Still, we 
may safely conclude that the absolvement of the Cuckoo from nest 
building and rearing young, which are the severest labours of other 
birds, is meant to answer, and does answer, some very important 
purpose in the economy of nature, and that purpose can be accom- 
plished only by employing in some other way that portion of time 
in the Cuckoo, which in other birds is devoted to nidification and 
nursing." That is the grand point to be ascertained.
It can be 
ascertained only by observation of the most careful nature ; and 
till it is ascertained, the history of the Cuckoo — unquestionably 
the most curious bird that visits this island — must remain imperfect 
and mysterious.
167 
I here append a Danish reason why the Cuckoo builds no 
nest.
When in early spring-time the voice of the Cuckoo is heard 
in the woods, every village girl kisses her hand, and asks the 
question, "Cuckoo, Cuckoo, when shall I be married?" and the 
old people, borne down with old age and its concomitant troubles, 
enquire, "Cuckoo, when shall I be released from this world's 
cares ?" The bird in answer, continues singing "Cuckoo" as many 
tihies as years will elapse before the object of their desires will 
come to pass.
But as some old people live to an advanced age, 
and many girls die old maids, the poor bird has so much to do in 
answering questions put to her, that the building season goes by — 
she has no time to make her nest, but lays her eggs in that of 
others.
Pied Flycatcher (Musicapa atricapilla ), 
This bird, the last visitor which I shall bring forward this 
evening, is one which very few of you will have had the pleasure 
of seeing.
The Rev. F.
O. Morris, in his work on "British Birds," 
says, "This rare and local bird I, like many ornithologists, have 
never seen alive, being scattered sparingly through Cumberland 
and Westmoreland." The precise locality of this bird I Avill not 
give, for fear of collectors exterminating it.
My brother and I, while sitting in a wood one day on the 
banks of one of our rivers, the first week in May, had our attention 
agreeably attracted by the arrival of a flock of Pied Flycatchers.
There were twenty or thirty in all, and all males.
They alighted 
on a grove of alder trees, and they seemed very much spent, as if 
they had come a long journey; indeed, we could have caught 
some of them, if we had been so inclined.
A few days later the 
females arrived, and pairing commenced immediately.
The date 
of arrival of this bird is very uncertain.
I have seen them here 
on April 20th, and as far into May.
The male has a decided, sweet little song; and the lively 
effect of the well-defined black and white plumage of the male, 
and the confiding manner of both sexes, endear them to the 
168 
naturalist.
I know of no bird which is so utterly fearless of man 
as the Pied Flycatcher ; they actually built before us when only a 
few yards distant.
You have only to keep quiet, and they go on 
with their nesting operations quite unconcernedly.
There were a 
number of nests in a very short space of ground, and all of them 
were built in the holes of trees, from three to fifteen feet up.
I was 
much amused with the pertinacity of a blue tit, who disputed the 
occupancy of a nesting hole with the flycatcher.
There were two 
entrances to the hole, and it was very amusing to see the flycatcher 
pop in at one hole, and the blue tit chase him out at the other, 
reminding one very much of the clown and pantaloon business in 
the Christmas pantomimes.
We used to go and examine their 
nesting holes, and the females in some instances sat on the nests 
without laying any eggs for above a week.
Some of the females 
allowed us to lift them off their nests and put them back again 
without appearing the least alarmed.
The nest is composed of dry 
grass, leaves, fine roots, and a few hairs ; the number of eggs being 
from five to six, of a uniform light pale blue colour, — indeed, some 
of them were nearly white ; they much resemble the eggs of the 
redstart, only they are a shade less, and of more elegant form.
Macgillvray says : " The manners and habits of the pied flycatcher 
have considerable affinity to those of the redstart ; they come about 
the same time, associate together, and often build in the same 
holes, for which they contend.
On one occasion we found a 
female redstart on the nest of a pied flycatcher containing two 
eggs ; and at another time when both these species had nests 
within a few inches of each other, upon the redstart's being 
removed, the female redstart took forcible possession of the fly- 
catcher's nest, incubated the eggs, and brought up the young." 
I may here state, that I have the pleasure of knowing that 
in several nests of this bird, the young have been brought up 
during the last two years without molestation.
Thus we may hope 
that this rare and local bird will be encouraged to frequent the 
district.
It is an exceedingly handsome bird.
The upper part of the 
body is glossy black ; a part of the forehead, a patch on each wing, 
169 
the outer web of the two tail feathers on each side, and all the 
lower parts of the body, are white.
The female is more sober in 
her attire, being greyish brown above, and brownish white 
beneath.
Here I close my humble account of a few of our Spring and 
Summer Visitors, whose natural music fills our meadows, hedge- 
rows, groves, and woods with their bright merry songs, charming 
the ear, and thus rendering doubly delightful, scenes on which the 
eye gazes with rapture, and which lead the well ordered mind to 
the heartfelt worship of the Almighty Creator whose wisdom is 
so wondrously displayed in the works of His hand.
We seldom 
consider how much the face of nature is enlivened and made 
cheerful by the songs and varied movements of the birds about 
which I have just spoken ; and to the lover of natural scenery, the 
number and variety of its birds ought to render still more dear his 
native and beloved county.
If any remarks that I have made 
to-night may be the means of inducing any to study in the wide 
field of nature, my end will have been fully accomplished.

AVITH THE DIPPER.
( Cinclus aqtiaticiis.
) 
By WILLIAM DUCKWORTH.
(Read at Carlisle.) 
It may seem rather a bold undertaking to make the Dipper 
the subject of a paper; to me, however, it speaks of many happy 
days spent in wandering by the banks of our beautiful rivers, or 
even picking my steps along the bottom of our mountain brooks.
For if you want to see the Dipper at home, you must be prepared 
for some rough and tiresome walking, — walking in which occasion- 
ally you have to use hands and arms, as well as legs and feet.
This bird, since my first acquaintance with it, many years ago, 
has always been a great favourite with me; and the notes made 
about it year after year, are now, owing to the formation of this 
Society, for the first time put into order ; and though I may add 
nothing new to its already written history, yet at the same time, I 
may dispel some illusions about it which exist in some of our 
histories of British Birds.
The Dipper is considered generally to belong to the Thrush 
family, but is rather an aberrant form.
Mudie gives it a genus to 
itself; Morris places it between the starlings and the thrushes.
It 
is found in Europe from Siberia southwards to Spain, and has been 
seen in Asia.
In our own country it may be found from the 
Hebrides to Devonshire, — of course only frequenting those parts 
of the country that are suitable to its habits.
172 
Surrounded as we are, locally, by clear and quick running 
streams through rocky and wooded banks, we are at once in the 
very haunts of the Dipper, and so have every opportunity of 
studying its habits.
There is not a river running by our Ancient City — Eden, 
Petteril, Caldew, and, with a few exceptions, their tributaries — but 
what on their banks and in their waters the Dipper finds a home 
and food.
The Dipper cannot boast of a very elegant figure, being some- 
thing like the starling, but more perhaps like the wren in shape — 
short and stumpy.
The length of the bird, from the tip of the bill 
to the end of the tail, is about seven inches and a half, and it 
weighs something like two ounces and a half The plumage, which 
is always neat and trim, is very sober in color, consisting principally 
of brown, white, and grey.
Head and neck dark brown, dark grey 
back and sides, shading into black ; throat and upper part of the 
breast pure white, lower part of the breast chesnut brown.
The 
pure white of the throat and breast is a very conspicuous object 
as the bird is seen sitting quietly on some water-surrounded stone 
along the river side ; and you can often tell the Dipper by this 
characteristic when a great way off before you can see the outline 
of the bird.
From the fact of the Dipper having so many popular 
names — and I have gathered a number of these — we may draw 
conclusions at once that the bird has something more than usually 
interesting about it.
For, as a rule, I find that popular names are 
not applied to birds, insects, or plants, unless they have some 
specific habits, powers, or virtues above their kindred.
The 
meaning of the scientific name of the bird, Cinclus aqtiaticus, is 
from Ciftchis, a bird that has -a habit of moving its tail; and 
aquaticus pertaining to water.
Cinclus is known generally as the 
Dipper; but in some districts it goes by the name of Bessie 
Ducker, or Peggy Ducker, or to give the name its right value, I 
should pronounce it Dooker ; in others it is known by the names 
of Water Crow, Water Piet, and Water Ouzel ; or by Ducks and 
Ducker.
In some parts of Scotland it is the Water Pipit, in others 
the Kingfisher, which is also an Irish name for it.
So if you are 
173 
enquiring about Chiclus of any of your country friends, and can't 
make them understand by one name, try another.
Those who have only an acquaintance with the Dipper 
through the medium of a stuffed specimen and a glass case, can 
have no idea of the energetic and interesting little fellow he is in 
his native streams ; and many happy hours have I spent in 
listening to his sweet and merry warble, or watching him busily 
seeking his dinner at the bottom of some shallow stream.
For a 
rare fisher is Citidus, and we are afraid that our fresh-water snails, 
the larvae of the Ephemera or water-flies, and water-beetles, have a 
hard time of it when he is about.
The question of his poaching on salmon ova has, we think, 
been entirely settled in his favour ; and my own observations have 
always tended to prove that his food consisted of molluscs, the 
larvae of water-flies, etc.
Mr. Frank Buckland, among others, says 
this is so, and that " it is as foolish to shoot a swallow skimming 
over a turnip field, as a Water Crow on a salmon bed." This is 
strong evidence from one who, we are afraid, would have little 
mercy on salmon poachers in any form.
The late J.
K. Lord, a 
well known naturalist, also gives the following evidence in his 
favor.
"Believe me, it is not with any felonious intent that the Dipper 
visits the spawning beds.
He would not give a chirp to breakfast 
on the daintiest fish eggs that speckled trout or silver salmon ever 
laid.
Fat larvae, plump and savoury water beetles, and delicate 
young fresh water molluscs, are his delight ; and he knows well 
the weakness such robbers have for new laid eggs, and like a 
sensible bird, goes where the eggs are, to find the robbers — an 
obedience to instinct that often costs him his life.
I have opened 
the stomachs of dozens of Dippers when collecting for the purposes 
of Natural history, and never in a single instance did I discover 
other than the remains of insects and fresh-water shells." Again, 
at a meeting of the Zoological Society in February, in 1863, the 
Water Ouzel was fairly put upon his trial as a destroyer of fish- 
spawn.
The first verdict was "Not proven." This being in the 
form of a Scotch verdict, an English Water Ouzel was entitled to 
enter a demurrer, I am, therefore, not surprised to learn that a 
174 
distinguished ornithologist objected to it, and that the jury 
ultimately returned their verdict thus : — " Water Ouzel fully 
acquitted o{ t\\e.
charge of eating fish spawn." 
I have gone rather deeply into this, as the poor Dipper still 
suffers for a crime of which he is innocent, and I should like to see 
justice done to him.
With us the Dipper is one of our earliest breeders, and about 
the time when the Pilewort ( Raminculus Ficaria) first breaks into 
bloom, gemming the still withered hedge-side with its bright green 
heart-shaped leaves and yellow starlike flowers, you may make your 
first journey in quest of the Dipper's home.
The nest seems large 
for the size of the bird, is domed in construction, with an entrance 
from the side, and is generally composed of moss, with a lining of 
dried oak leaves.
I have known two instances in which this plan was 
deviated from ; — one where a tuft of dried grass had been seized 
upon to form the outer covering, and another in which some 
withered fronds of a fern had been applied to the same purpose.
Some writers give the nest as being lined with feathers ; in some 
scores of nests I have examined, I have never found this the case.
The Dipper displays great acuteness in the selection of its 
nesting site, seldom nesting on a clay or gravel bank, but generally 
choosing a rock, whose base is washed by the stream, or the roots 
of an overhanging tree.
Generally the nest is not easy of access, 
unless the water is low, and here the Dipper is sometimes at fault, 
for building, early as it does, when the rivers are mostly bank full, 
what are then safe places, become less so in the drier summer 
months.
Often before the young are fledged, the water falls so 
much that there is a dry pathway between rock and river.
The height of the nest above the water varies considerably : I 
have seen it so near the stream as to be only two feet above low water 
mark ; and again, as high as fifteen or sixteen feet above the water, 
with a clear plunge into a pool perhaps as deep.
It would have 
been an amusing sight to see the young Dippers emerge out of one 
of these high placed nests on their first essay into the outer world.
About the time when they are ready for flight, and you chance to 
175 
disturb them, they have a ridiculous habit of plopping out of the 
nest head over heels, and dropping plump into the water.
The building of the nest, in which both birds assist, is com- 
pleted in about a fortnight.
When this is going on, you may now 
and then chance to see them at work ; though most of it, I fancy, 
is done early in the morning.
But if you are favoured with a view, 
it is an instructive sight to see them struggling under clumps of 
moss, almost as big as themselves, one of them often waiting with 
a piece of moss in its beak until the other is finished ; or perhaps 
you see one flying past you with a dried oak leaf in its mouth, 
which somehow reminds you of the old nursery tale of the "Babes 
in the Wood." 
The nest is often placed in curious situations : I have seen it 
underneath bridges, by the side of a waterfall, and once under a 
ledge of wall by the side of a mill wheel, which did not seem to 
disturb the birds in the least.
I once met with a curious incident 
in the nesting of the Dipper.
I was wending my way by the side 
of a fell beck, beneath the shadow of Lade Pot, in Westmorland, 
one wet June day four years ago, in quest of a nest of the wild 
duck.
Coming to a part of the valley where it suddenly narrowed, 
leaving only a rocky channel for the water to find its way through, 
I noticed a pair of Dippers, evidently by their cries and motions in 
distress.
On arriving at the spot, I soon found the cause of their 
lamentations.
The nest had been placed in a slight cavity on a 
ledge of rock, the rock from above the ledge where the nest was 
placed sloped considerably backwards, and was covered with loose 
shingle from the bank above.
Owing, I suppose, to the wet 
weather, one of these pieces of shingle had slid down over the nest, 
and, resting on the ledge, had completely stopped the entrance.
Carefully removing the obstruction, I straightened the nest up a bit, 
and found it contained two eggs unbroken.
On removing to some 
distance, the pair of Dippers came back, and one of them, after a 
short scrutiny, entered the nest, and finding, I suppose, all right, 
they went off with their usual Chit !
Chit !
down stream.
To the inexperienced eye, the nest of the Dipper is not good 
to find, readily passing itself off for a clump of moss attached tq 
176 
the rock, unless on getting well below it, the entrance attracts the 
attention.
On a level with the nest, or above it, the entrance is 
not seen, the moss at the upper edge of the hole hanging over it 
more or less, and forming a kind of penthouse ; in fact, I have 
seen the hole completely hidden by a piece of loose moss like a 
curtain, which had to be lifted every time the birds went in or out.
The same thing is occasionally seen in the nest of the long-tailed 
tit (Parus caudatus), another dome builder.
It is wonderful in many cases how the Dipper's nest sticks to 
the slight ledge of rock on which it is built, and how the birds 
manage to rear a family under the circumstances, as I have seen it 
impossible to insert the hand into some of these nests and withdraw 
it again without bringing the nest away with it ; and when once 
you have pulled it down, you cannot replace it.
Yet in such a 
precarious dwelling four or five young Dippers will be brought up 
and get fledged, and leave the nest standing, often on a ledge of 
rock not more than two inches in depth.
The sites of other nests 
of the Dipper seem to be inaptly chosen, being continually saturated 
with water, either dripping from the rocks above, or being within 
reach of the spray from a water-fall ; and some eggs taken from one 
of these nests were deeply stained by lying on the wet oak leaves.
However, the most surprising part of the business is, that in these 
damp houses, the laying of eggs, incubation, and rearing of young, 
goes on as if they were the most comfortable little cabins imagin- 
able.
Evidently Mrs. Cinclus is entirely unacquainted with many 
ills that human flesh is heir to.
Most of our Natural History authors make it out that the 
nest of the Dipper is very difficult to find, and can only be found 
by watching the birds in and out.
This is not the case, I think ; 
and when once you have seen one, and its situation, you will not 
waste time by looking for it in unlikely positions.
There is a saying among fisherman that " once a skelly 
(chub) hole, always a skelly hole ; " and something of the same 
might be applied to the nesting of the Dipper, " once a Dipper's 
nest, always a Dipper's nest." So when you have found one, you 
may rely upon its being there year after year, under ordinary 
177 
circumstances, as regularly as spring comes round.
We have an 
account in the Ufe of Dr. Heysham, a distinguished local naturalist, 
of his walking ten miles to see a Dipper's nest ; and if I am right 
in fixing the locale, a Dipper breeds annually in the same place yet.
And it will be at least fifty years ago since Dr. Heysham first saw 
it.
Indeed, I can almost imagine the birds building in the same 
situation when Mercatius, the Roman centurion, sixteen hundred 
years ago left his name 
' ' Crag written 
Above the streaming Gelt," 
as near to the inscription Cinclus has yearly built his house for a 
long period.
The earliest date in my notes of the finding of the Dipper's 
nest, is February 27th; nest completed all but the lining of oak 
leaves.
This nest must have been started about the middle of 
February, as from first to last the building occupies about a fort- 
night.
This nest was unfortunately washed away by a flood on 
the 9th of March, so I could not follow it through.
At different 
places, in different years, I have known the nest as follows : — 
March 17th, four eggs; March 25th, building; March 29th, four 
eggs ; April 6th, young ones, about a week old.
This last nest 
must have been started about the third week in February — that is 
allowing a week for the age of the young ones, two weeks for 
incubation, one for egg laying, and two for building.
April, however, appears to be their favourite month, as the 
entries in my note books show most nests to have been found 
during that month.
Sometimes as many as ten in a single day's 
ramble, and all in stages of nesting from half-built nests to fully 
fledged young ones.
Morris gives the nidification of the Dipper as 
commencing in the middle of April; and Mudie says the first 
brood is not fledged till the middle of May. However, the dates 
I have given you above, I can guarantee as quite correct.
The latest date I have noticed for finding these nests is July 
7th.
The eggs are pure white ; and I may mention that the full 
complement is five ; some writers say six, seven, and even eight ; 
13 
178 
but these numbers I have never seen.
From these five eggs four 
young birds are generally hatched ; and, as a rule, the birds breed 
twice in the season, not more.
The young birds are fed by the parents for some time after 
leaving the nest, and a prettier sight is hardly to be seen anywhere.
The baby Dippers are ranged in a row on some stone or rock, rising 
from the bed of th e river in mid stream, while the parent birds 
are busily hunting the stream below, returning after each successful 
raid to the resting place, where a flutter of little wings, and a 
gaping of big mouths, welcome their arrival, the said mouths 
being carefully supplied each in their turn.
In breeding time, they seem to have the water parcelled out, 
so much to each pair ; and in following the course of some of our 
smaller rivers, you may keep the Dipper flying on before you in 
short flights, from one resting place to another, till you get it a 
certain distance up or down stream, where it turns either by flying 
high over your head, or, if there is a bend in the river, by crossing 
the angle, — while at the same time it utters its single call-note, 
resembling the word Chit !
Chit !
If you repeat the experiment 
time after time, you will always find it turn much about the same 
place.
Generally before alighting it drops into the water and 
scrambles up the stone.
Always after a flight, and before taking 
another, it makes a sort of rustic bow by a jerk of the head and 
tail.
During the late frost, while the Dipper's relations on land, — 
the thrushes and blackbirds, — were in many cases starved to death 
for want of food, the Dipper's larder was kept well and constantly 
supplied, as the streams where he seeks his food were the only 
places not frozen over.
And it was great fun, when the thermometer 
was showing thirteen degrees of frost, to see Cinclus disporting 
himself in and out of the water, often beneath the ice, with as much 
spirit and abandon as he would show on a hot day in July.
Yet at 
the same time, he had to remove from the higher reaches of the 
river, his natural habitat, to the lower, and even got down Eden as 
far as Cargo, where one or two were shot for rare birds, being 
quite unknown in that locality.
179 
Of late years the bird has become a great deal commoner than 
it used to be, owing, I believe, to the introduction of the Gun Tax, 
a measure which has done more for the preservation of our small 
birds than any other Act ever passed.
There is no occasion to 
walk ten miles now to see a Dipper's nest ; and last year it bred 
nearer to the city than I had ever known, and what is better still, 
to the best of my belief, bred in safety, since the last time I saw 
the nest it was full of fine young ones.
I may here remark that it 
is the same with many of our native birds — by native birds I mean 
those that stay with us all the year round — as it is with the Dipper.
Birds that some years ago were comparatively rare, are now 
common ; and I think if the Gun Tax was doubled, we should 
have them commoner still.
The song of the Dipper is to be heard almost all the year ; 
indeed, I think I have heard it in every month except November.
The song is low, mellow, and pipe like in tone ; but at the same 
time you hear it distinctly above the rush of the stream and the 
roar of the waterfall.
The position of the bird in singing is very 
graceful, as it bends forward and jerks its tail, every now and then 
stopping to arrange its feathers.
It often sings during the warm 
soft nights of summer.
We come now to the most interesting part of the subject, that 
is, the Dipper's power of walking underneath the water ; a faculty 
possessed by no other known bird, and one which has given rise to 
much controversy amongst naturalists.
Many of them aver that it 
is possessed of no such power.
Before giving you my own ex- 
perience in regard to this part of the subject, I shall give you the 
opinions of some of our most celebrated naturalists, and also an 
epitome of a controversy which took place in " Science Gossip " 
some years ago.
The Dipper is nearly the same in form and structure as the 
Thrushes, which are purely land birds, the main difference between 
them being the habit of the latter of seeking its food at the bottom 
of the water.
The discovery of this bird's power to walk at the 
bottom of a stream belongs, I believe, to a Frenchman named 
Herbert, who communicated it to Count Buffon, afterwards a 
180 
thorough believer in it.
G. H.
Adams says "it is simply absurd to 
believe what Buffon and others said about it — that it could walk 
without effort at the bottom of a stream, as though on dry land." 
Montague describes the appearance of the bird when under water 
as "tumbling about in a very extraordinary manner, with its head 
downward, as if picking up something, and at the same time using 
great exertions with both legs and wings." Yarrell says, " when 
searching for food it does not proceed very far under water, but 
soon reappears in the immediate neighbourhood of where it sank, 
when it either dives again, or rises on the wing, to drop somewhere 
else in the stream." He had no faith in the bird's walking at the 
bottom of the water ; but as he never saw the Dipper alive, and 
only judged from the anatomy of it, I am afraid his evidence is too 
much theory for us to accept.
Sir William Jardine, who writes a 
very beautiful article on the Water Ouzel, provokingly says nothing 
of its walking powers.
Macgillvray also disbelieved in this faculty 
of the Dippers, as did Charles Waterton, who is worth quoting 
more fully on the subject : " This is the bird which has given rise 
to so much controversy, and whose supposed subaquatic pranks 
have set the laws of gravity at defiance, by breaking through the 
general mandate, which has ordained that things lighter than water 
shall rise towards its surface, and things which are heavier shall 
sink beneath it.
If the Water Ouzel can walk on the ground at 
the bottom of the water, then indeed, we may exclaim with the 
poet : — 
'All Nature's laws will tumble and decay, 
And e'en the world itself will lose its way.' 
And further on he affirms that the observer's eyes are deceived, 
and give him false information, when in tracing the bird's down- 
ward course underneath the water he fancies he sees it walking.
Morris, on the other hand, writes : " That this bird has the 
power of walking at the bottom of the water, is an established fact.
The argiament against its being able to do so is, that to the 
reasoning powers of some persons it does not seem possible.
Its 
feet are admirably adapted for holding on to the stones over which 
181 
it makes its way, and for stemming at the same time the force of 
the current ; for that no effort is required to keep its place below 
the surface, is what no one has said." Mudie, who, as usual, 
theorises a good deal, says on the subject : " The difference of 
specific gravity between the bird and the water is indeed so trifling, 
that very Httle effort suffices to move it in any direction, upwards, 
downwards, or laterally." At the same time I much doubt whether 
Mudie ever saw the Dipper in its native haunts, as his descrip- 
tion of it is a great deal more fanciful than truthful.
The late Mr. J.
K. Lord in an article in "Science Gossip" on 
the Belted Kingfisher, remarked that it did not swim or walk at 
the bottom of the water, as the Dipper did.
This brought a letter 
from a correspondent, who was much surprised that Mr. Lord still 
beHeved in what he thought was an exploded doctrine ; and who 
backed up his letter by quoting Charles Waterton's arguments, and 
advised Mr. Lord to read Waterton's essays on Natural History, and 
then he (Mr. Lord) would not tell amateur naturalists the absurd 
story that the Dipper could walk underneath the water.
This brought answers from several correspondents who had 
seen the Dipper perform this seemingly impossible feat.
One of 
them quoted the opinion of the late Charles St. John a most 
accurate observer, who said, "though the fact has often been 
doubted, it certainly runs and scratches up the stones while at the 
bottom in search of food." These letters brought another from 
correspondent No. i, who said his argument had not been answered, 
and proceeded to give three reasons against the so-called walking: — 
I St. It is well known that the bodies of all birds float in the water.
2nd.
He was convinced that birds are obliged to make great 
exertions with their wings and feet, in order to reach the bottom, 
3rd.
When they reach the bottom, the force which carried them 
there ceases to act, consequently they must rise again.
These 
arguments clearly proved to correspondent No. i that the so-called 
walking was impossible.
Another correspondent, in reply to this, 
wrote : — " Can birds walk under water ?
The question has as yet 
been evaded, rather than answered.
It is easy to heap up argu- 
ments showing that it cannot be done.
Many such theories have 
182 
been constructed, which a strong indisputable fact has knocked to 
pieces." And as a small contribution towards the controversy he 
quoted the following sentence from Rennie : "The amphibious 
nature of those winged beetles which can walk at the bottom of 
water, is matched, if not outrivalled by the Water Ouzel, which we 
have repeatedly seen walk deliberately under water, and continue 
its pace for many yards, as if it had been on land.
As this little 
bird lives on water insects, its amphibious powers are indispens- 
able." 
In hopes of ending the controversy, the editor of " Science 
Gossip " quoted a paper which had been read before the Dublin 
Natural History Society, on this very subject, and the author, 
among others, read the following notes made on the spot : — "Nov.
29th, 1850.
Bohernabreena.
Wounded a Water Ouzel, which, as 
I had observed them all to do, immediately made for shore.
On 
my going to seize him, he darted into the water, running slap in ; 
waded in after him.
Under water he looks quite glossy, but does 
not seem increased in bulk, the glossiness probably arising from 
the oiled plumage, or else from its peculiar texture.
When I first 
got up with the bird, he was perfectly stationary at the bottom, not 
using any exertion to remain there.
(This remark applies to two 
other birds wounded later on in the day, which also took to the 
water.) The bird next got under a big stone, and when I poked 
him out on one side, he ran to the other ; after the lapse of a 
minute or so he put his head out of the water to breathe, always 
keeping the stone between him and me.
Finding that I was still 
chasing him, he took to the stream, and went under water faster than 
I could follow him; he seemed to move now altogether by means of 
his feet, his wings hanging down behind his tail.
At times he 
swam in midwater, using his wings ; crossing the current several 
times, and seeming but little incommoded by it.
When at last 
caught, he was found to be merely winged." 
I have abbreviated the above paragraph slightly, but have not 
altered its meaning.
Coming now to my own experience of the 
matter, it has several times fallen to my lot to witness the Dipper 
walking at the bottom of the stream.
The first time I saw the 
183 
feat actually done, was one fine morning in early spring seven 
years ago.
I was leaning on the parapet of a small bridge crossing 
a burn in Northumberland, when who should march from under- 
neath the bridge but Master Cinclus, very busy indeed in catering 
for the wants of the inner bird, too busy to see me taking notes of 
his doings, some fifteen or sixteen feet above him.
He searched 
that burn very carefully downwards — shallows, pools, and streams, 
taking all in, till a bend in its course hid him from my view.
Sometimes he was immersed clean over-head, other times with but 
part of his back out, and again having his feet but barely 
covered, yet at the same time never offering to seek his food on 
the dry gravel bed.
Another time, on a bright June day, two years ago, I was 
lying on the top of a steep precipitous rock overhanging a favourite 
fishing stream of the Dipper's in Croglin Water, a tributary of the 
Eden, surrounded by the rosy waxen flowers of the bilberry, inter- 
mingled with the light green fronds of the oak fern, and with a 
cushion of moss beneath, making such a couch as Sylvia might 
have envied.
As if to gratify my wishes (I was lying in wait for 
him), Cinclus dropped right into the water beneath, there some 
six to nine inches deep, and commenced working his way up 
stream, knocking the pebbles right and left for about two yards 
before rising again to the surface.
Another time, and again the scene changes, and I am making 
my way homewards through the Rose Holmes, by the river Caldew, 
on one of those dull raw November days which seem to hang so 
heavily on one's spirits, when my attention was attracted by a 
Dipper dipping, as is his wont, on a large stone in the middle of 
the shallow stream.
On watching him a short time, I found he 
was busy making short excursions into the water on all sides of 
him, returning after each trip to his favourite resting place on the 
stone, and doing a little at the arrangement of his plumage before 
starting afresh.
Taking advantage of the few seconds he was 
under water, I dodged from tree to tree till I was within a few 
yards of him, and then I had the pleasure of seeing him walk out 
of the shallowing water, across stream, on to the dry gravel bed at 
my feet.
184 
Thus in the three instances I have given you of this power of 
walking underneath the water, at three different times of the year, 
one is down stream, another up, and a third across ; and only in 
the upward motion have I seen any use made of the wings.
So in 
spite of Charles Waterton, I am inclined to believe my own eyes, 
and register it as a fact, that the Dipper actually walks at the 
bottom of the water.
What power the bird has to enable it to do this, whether 
an inherent one of which we know nothing, or an adherent one of 
which we know something — that is, his powerful feet and claws — 
is still to be found out.
I had intended when first starting with this paper to have 
introduced a few other birds which are to be found with the 
Dipper, but a bird one loves is hard to leave ; and I have found 
so much to say about the Dipper, that I am afraid it would have 
been taxing your patience too much to have made the article 
longer ; or with the birds I might have told you of the strange 
wild flowers, the beautiful and rare ferns, the curious mosses and 
lichens, which have fallen under my notice in wandering along the 
bottom of our fell becks, — treasures of which he whose feet ever 
keep to the dusty highway, knows nothing.
I will close with one Httle tribute to the Dipper from a 
Devonshire poet, who in describing such scenery as I have not 
dared to attempt to pourtray, says : — 
"The bird 
Is here, the solitary bird that makes 
The rock his sole companion.
Leafy vale, 
Green bowers, and hedgerows fair, and gardens rich, 
With bud and bloom, dehght him not ; he bends 
No spray, nor roams the wilderness of boughs 
Where love and song detain a million wings 
Through all the summer morn, the summer eve ; 
He has no fellowship with waving woods, 
He joins not in their merry minstrelsy, 
But flits from ledge to ledge, and through the day 
Sings to the higli-toned waterfall, that speaks 
To him in strains he loves and lists 
For ever."

THE BUTTERFLIES OF THE DISTRICT.
By GEORGE DAWSON, 
(Read at Carlisle.
) 
We have in this locality as great a variety of Butterflies as 
exists in any part of England.
I have taken thirty different 
species — some of the rarest that the British list contains — and I 
will speak of them in their order as arranged in the list of the late 
Mr. H.
Doubleday, giving the locality where found, and the time 
of their appearance.
Leiuophasia Sinapis (Wood White).
— Taken in a wood (since 
cut down) at Orton, about the middle of May.
Pieris Brassicae (Large White), Pieris Rapae (Small White), 
Pieris Napi (Green Veined White).
— All these three species are 
very common.
The White butterfly is to be found from the end 
of April to the end of September, and each species has two broods.
These butterflies are great pests in the garden, eating freely 
cabbages, lettuces, and other vegetables.
Anthocaris Cardamines (Orange Tip).
— Another early butter- 
fly; common everywhere from April to the end of June.
The 
male alone has the bright orange tip to the upper wing.
The 
under wings of both male and female are beautiful, being marked 
with green below.
The larva feeds on the Hedge Garlic.
Phodocera Rhamtd {'Qnvastowt).
— This species is plentiful in 
the south of England, but almost unknown here.
I took one 
specimen in the lane leading from the low Wigton road to Little 
Orton ; it was much worn, but I sent it (alive) to Mr. E.
Newman, 
who stated that it was the first he had heard of from Cumberland.
Colias Ediisa (Clouded Yellow).
— This beautiful species is very 
plentiful in some seasons, and in others scarce to be found.
In 
186 
the summer of 1877 there were many all over England.
The two 
I now exhibit were taken at Bellevue and near Sandsfield, in the 
month of August.
They were about from the end of June till the 
end of September.
I have only seen one specimen this season — 
at Little Orton, in July — and have taken one of the variety of 
edusa called helice; it was much shattered and not worth setting.
Argynnis Aglaia (Dark Green Fritillary).
— I have found large 
numbers of this butterfly on the sandhills at Sillothj also at Orton, 
Newby Cross, and Newbiggin.
They are not readily taken on the 
wing, but may be captured when settled on beds of the common 
thistle.
July and August.
Argynnis Selene (Small Pearl Bordered Fritillary).
— This is a 
very common species at Orton, Newby Cross, and the Newbiggin 
woods from the middle of June till the end of August.
I have 
one very fine variety, taken at Orton, which, instead of being a 
rich brown, is of a dingy white colour.
Melitcea Artemis (Greasy Fritillary).
— Less common in other 
parts of England than here.
I have bred large numbers from the 
larvae collected at Orton and Newby Cross, and sent thousands of 
the larvae to different parts of England and Ireland.
The collectors 
in Ireland are trying to establish them there, and so far have been 
successful.
The eggs are laid in the month of July in the Devil's 
Bit Scabious ; in about fourteen days they are hatched, feed for a 
short time, and then spin a light silky sort of cocoon, in which 
they pass the winter, crawling out in the early part of April, and 
being full-grown by the middle of May ; they are in the pupa state 
about fourteen days.
Vanessa Urticae (Small Tortoiseshell Vanessa), Vanessa lo 
(Peacock), Vanessa Atalanta (Red Admiral).
— All these are very 
common around Carlisle j the larvae feeding on the stinging-nettle.
For a few years the Peacock was not seen here, but I brought a 
large brood of the larvae from Durham, and turned them out on a 
bed of nettles near Prior Wood, and since then the butterfly has 
been plentiful in this neighbourhood.
Vanessa Antiopa (Camberwell Beauty).
— I once took a female 
of this species at Orton, a very poor specimen, but Mr. E.
187 
Newman said it was the first he had heard of being found in 
Cumberland ; since then, however, I have seen another in the 
collection of Mr. J.
W. Harris, of Derwent Bank, Broughton, who 
captured it near his house on the slopes of the railway.
Pyramus Cardui (Painted Lady).
— This species I find all 
over Cumberland.
The larvae feed on the common field thistle ; 
they are easily found, for they draw the leaves together to form a 
shelter.
The butterfly is on the wing from the middle of June till 
the end of September ; it lives over the winter, and in the spring is 
to be found about the thistles depositing its eggs.
Erebia Cassiope (Mountain Ringlet).
— I hunted through the 
Lake District for many years before I was successful in capturing 
this rare species, but at last, on the top of one of the highest 
mountains, near the Vale of Newlands, I found the long looked for 
prize.
I never heard of anyone being able to rear the butterfly 
from the egg or larva condition.
I have had some hundreds of 
the eggs, and sent them to different entomologists, but none of 
them have been able to rear a single specimen.
The eggs are laid 
in July, and hatched in about fourteen days ; the young feed for a 
short time, and then go down to the grass roots.
Satyrus Megara (Wall Brown), Satyriis Semele (Grayling), 
Satyrtts Jatiira (Meadow Brown), Satyrus Hyperanthus (Ringlet).
— 
All these are to be found on Kingmoor, Todhills, at Orton, Newby 
Cross, and in Newbiggin woods.
They are on the wing from 
June to the end of August.
The Grayling is most plentiful at 
Silloth, but very hard to distinguish from the sand on which they 
settle.
I have taken great numbers all along the coast between 
Silloth and Allonby.
There are many varieties of the Ringlet 
species, the variation occurring on their under side.
Chortobius Davus (March Ringlet), Chortobius Pamphilus 
(Small Heath).
— The former of these I have only found in two 
localities, Orton (over wet peaty ground) and Newby Cross (on a 
piece of common at the Dalston end of the woods).
The second 
species I have taken in low lying mosses, and on Great Gable ; 
they are on the wing from the end of May to the end of August.
Thecla Rubi (Green Hair Streak), Thecla Querciis (Purple Hair 
188 
Streak).
— The Green Hair Streak I have only found at Orton, and 
on that part of the moss near to Little Orton ; they are on the 
wing in May, and can be taken until the end of June.
I have 
taken the Purple Hair Streak at Thurstonfield, Orton, Newby 
Cross, Dalston Hall and Newbiggin woods.
The best mode of 
taking them is by beating the branches of the oak trees.
The pupse 
can be obtained by digging at the roots of the oak trees in the first 
and second week in July ; they are short and stout, of a bright 
.shining brown colour.
They are on the wing from the end of July 
till the end of August.
Polyommatus Phlaeas (Small Copper).
— This is one of the 
commonest species we have here abouts, and I have found it in 
every locality in which I have collected ; it is very fond of settling 
down on a heap of stones, or on the bare ground.
These butter- 
flies are on the wing from April to September.
Lycaena Alexis (Common Blue), Lycaena Alsiis (Small Blue).
— 
The former is very plentiful on Kingmoor and all common grounds.
The Smaller Blue I have found on the railway slopes near 
Wreay, at Coweran Cut near Howmill, and on the banks of the 
Eden near Warwick Hall.
Both species are on the wing from the 
end of May to the end of July, and I think we have two broods of 
the common Blues.
Thanaos Tages (Dingy Skipper).
— This is a very common 
species, and it occurs in large numbers on Kingmoor and Tod- 
hills, at Orton, Newby Cross, and Newbiggin.
On the wing from 
May till the end of August.
Htsperia Sylvanus (Large Skipper), Hesperia Comma (Spotted 
Skipper.) — Both of these I have taken at Thurstonfield, Orton, 
and Newby Cross.
They are the most active of butterflies on the 
wing, and more resemble some of our moths flying from flower to 
flower; and when a wind is blowing, one's eye can scarcely follow 
them.
The Large Skipper is on the wing from the end of May 
till the end of July.
The Spotted Skipper is the most rare here, 
and is soonest found amongst a few Oak trees that grow on the 
west side of the wood at Newby Cross ; it is on the wing from the 
middle of July to the end of August.

THE STABILITY OF ROWING AND SAILING 
BOATS.
By the Rev. E.
M. REYNOLDS.
(Read at Ambleside.) 
There is a great deal of pleasure in sailing and rowing on our 
lakes, and there is also a little danger.
The consciousness of this 
danger makes many people nervous, and robs them of their enjoy- 
ment ; others altogether disregard it, and run with a light heart 
risks which it is scarcely justifiable to encounter for the sake of 
pleasure alone.
The object of this paper is to give a little inform- 
ation as to the safety of boats (for safety and stability are almost 
convertible terms), which may re-assure the timid, and, on the other 
hand, induce caution when caution is needed.
The Stability of Boats is by no means a difficult subject.
The 
calculations by which the stability of any particular vessel is 
ascertained are, it is true, long and laborious, but the principles 
on which they depend are simple, and may be mastered without 
much trouble by any one of ordinary inteUigence.
Our rough 
notions of the stability of bodies on shore are immediately applic- 
able to the stability of bodies afloat.
A broad base and considerable 
weight are the essential qualities which give stability to bodies on 
shore, and breadth and weight are the main elements of the 
stability of a boat.
The laws which govern the stability of bodies 
are in fact the same under all circumstances ; and in order to a 
sufficient understanding of our subject, nothing further is required 
than that we should master the ideas conveyed by the terms Centre 
of Gravity, Couple, Arm of a Couple,— terms belonging to the 
190 
rudiments of Mechanics, — and should know what is meant by the 
Centre of Buoyancy of a vessel.
A few other terms are commonly 
employed in treating of sailing vessels, such as Centre of Lateral 
Resistance, Centre of Pressure, Metacentre ; these will present no 
difficulty when the first are clearly understood.
As to the term Centre of Gravity, it is one used in common 
conversation, and usually correctly enough, if not with exact 
accuracy.
It is currently defined thus : " The Centre of Gravity 
of a body is the point on which the body will balance in all 
positions"; or we may say that it is the point at which the whole 
mass of the body may be supposed to be collected, or the whole 
weight of the body supposed to act.
In speaking of the Centre of 
Gravity of a boat, I must beunderstood to mean the Centre of Gravity 
of the boat including all that she carries, the masts, sails, crew, 
and everything on board.
It is obvious that in a light boat the 
position of the Centre of Gravity will be considerably affected by 
the movements of those on board, that, for instance, if they all 
stand up, it will be materially raised ; whereas in a heavily 
ballasted boat it will be but slighdy deranged.
The term Couple is less generally used, and may require a 
little explanation.
A Couple consists of two equal forces acting 
in opposite directions, but not through one point.
(See Fig. i.) 
In working a press, the forces applied at the two ends of the lever 
or handle constitute a couple.
The effect of a couple is simply to 
turn the body on which it acts round, not to move it forwards in 
space.
And conversely in Mechanics every motion of rotation, 
every motion by which a body revolves without advancing or 
receding, is conceived of as the effect of a couple.
The power of a couple depends on two things : the intensity 
of the forces, and the distance between their lines of action.
This 
will be evident at once to any one who has ever tried to turn a 
press.
The distance between the lines of action must be measured 
from one line to the other along a straight line perpendicular to 
both, as AB in Figure i.
It is called in Mechanics the Arm of 
the Couple; and in all questions of the stability of boats, the arm of 
the righting couple is an element of the first importance.
191 
The stability of floating bodies depends entirely on the action 
of couples.
Take a block of wood and hold it in water in the 
position represented in Figure 2 : it will not stay in this position 
unless held, and, if released, will turn about without moving from 
its place till the upper and lower sides become horizontal.
The 
forces which act upon it constitute in fact a couple.
W hat are 
these forces?
There are but two of them : its own weight acting 
vertically downwards through its centre of gravity ; and the pressure 
of the water upon it, which is equal to the weight of the water 
displaced, and acts upwards through the centre of gravity of the 
water displaced.
It is necessary to be very clear about these forces.
The first is familiar to us from hourly experience.
The second 
may be less generally understood ; it is, however, a main 
principle of hydrostatics, and may either be deduced as a 
conclusion of pure reason, or established directly from experiment, 
that the resultant pressure on the immersed surface of any body 
is equal to the weight of the fluid displaced, and acts vertically 
upwards through the centre of gravity of the fluid displaced.
This 
centre of gravity of the fluid displaced is, in the case of vessels, 
called the Centre of Buoyancy, a term of constant use.
Returning 
to our block of wood, we may now say that it is acted on by 
two equal and opposite forces, its own weight acting downwards 
through its centre of gravity, and the resultant pressure of the water 
upon it acting upwards through its centre of buoyancy.
It is to be 
observed that the position of the centre of gravity of the block is 
always the same, but that of the centre of buoyancy will be changed 
with every motion of the block.
One position of the centre of 
buoyancy should especially be noted : when the block is at rest, 
the centre of buoyancy will be found to be directly under the 
centre of gravity, so that the two forces now act in the same line, 
though in contrary directions, and completely neutrahze each other.
To apply these notions exactly to the case of boats is some- 
what difficult, as it requires long and careful calculation to find 
the centre of gravity of a boat, and for every position of the 
centre of buoyancy a fresh calculation must be made.
Approximate results sufficient for practical purposes may, 
192 
however, be easily obtained.
As it is not my purpose in this paper 
to ascertain absolutely the stability of any one boat, but merely to 
compare the stability of different forms of boats, I shall allow 
myself a great simplification.
I shall treat the centre of gravity 
and centre of buoyancy of the midship section of a boat as if these 
were the centres of the whole boat.
The other sections in each 
boat will present generally the same characteristics as the midship 
section, so that for purposes of comparison this method will be 
sufficiently accurate.
The centre of gravity I shall take by 
estimation, after a consideration of the position of the different 
weights, the centre of buoyancy I shall deduce from the form of 
the immersed part of the section.
Rowing Boats.
Figure 3 represents a section of a well designed family 
rowing boat.
G is the centre of gravity, the boat being supposed 
fairly loaded ; C the centre of buoyancy, the boat having from any 
cause received such a heel as is represented in the figure.
AB is 
the arm of the righting couple.
The power of the couple tending 
to right the boat will depend on the weight of the boat and the 
length of AB ; and, the weight of the boat remaining constant, 
the length of AB may engage our whole attention.
Let us consider 
what is the effect on AB of heeling the boat gradually over.
When 
the boat is upright, the position of C is, as I have said, directly 
under that of G, and AB vanishes.
When the boat receives a 
slight heel, say to starboard, C moves out a little also to starboard.
G dots not alter its position in the boat, but the vertical line 
through it falls a little to starboard of its original position, yet not 
so much as to pass through C.
A righting couple is thus produced, 
and it is evident that the length of the arm AB depends on the 
difference of the rate of shifting out to starboard of C, and of the 
vertical line tlirough G.
In all reasonably stable boats, C moves 
out much faster than the vertical line through G; hence as the 
boat hee'-j over, the arm of the righting couple is lengthened, and 
its power increased.
This process, however, will not continue for 
ever.
When a boat is very much inclined, the outward motion of C 
1

F/ G.
S. 
FIG .-f-.
193 
will be reduced, and the vertical line through G will begin to move 
out faster than C ; the righting arm will then be diminished by any- 
further heeUng. The angle at which this takes place depends on 
the form of the boat, and the position of her centre of gravity, 
and varies in common types of boats as much as from io° to 50°.
Such a section as that represented in our figure, gives a boat 
of great stability.
At a moderate heel, C will move rapidly out, and 
the stability will, if G be kept low, continue to increase till the gun- 
wale touches the water.
The excellence of the design depends on two 
things, a broad flat floor, and a moderately high side, nearly vertical 
from the water upwards.
The advantage of a high side is obvious, 
since it allows the boat to heel over without swamping.
The 
flat floor gives the best results as to stability.
Compare Figs.
4 
and 5.
They represent sections, the one of a boat with a perfectly 
flat floor, the other of a deeper boat with a nearly triangular section.
The displacement, and therefore the weight, is the same for both.
The centres of gravity are put about where they would be if each 
boat had its usual complement of people on board, all sitting 
down.
The centres of buoyancy have been ascertained with 
sufficient accuracy, each boat being heeled over to an angle of ten 
degrees.
The figures therefore aflbrd data for a comparison of the 
stability of the boats under ordinary circumstances, and the com- 
parison will be complete if we simply measure the arms of the 
righting couples.
Now it will be found that the arm of the couple 
lending to right the flat floored boat is rather more than three 
times as long as the arm of the righting couple for the sharp 
floored boat Hence the flat floored model is more than three 
times as stable as the other, the centre of gravity having such a 
position as it would commonly occupy.
But this is not all its 
advantage.
If a mast were set up in the boat, or if any of the 
crew were to stand up, the centre of gravity would be raised.
If it were raised as far as the point M, so as to be vertically 
above the centre of buoyancy, the stability of the boat would 
vanish ; and if it were raised any further, the boat would 
capsize of her own accord.
Now, referring to Figs.
4 and 5, it 
will be seen that M is very high for the flat floored boat, and 
14 
194 
comparatively low for the other.
It is in fact quite conceivable 
that if all the crew stood up, the centre of gravity might be raised 
as far as M in the case of the sharp-bottomed boat, when an 
accident would be inevitable ; on the contrary, nothing but hoisting 
a weight up the mast could raise the centre of gravity of the flat 
floored boat as far as M.
If the centre of gravity of the flat 
floored boat were raised as much as would be sufficient to capsize 
the other, the stabiUty of the boat would only be diminished by 
one third, it would still be twice as great as that of the other boat 
with all her crew sitting down.
The point M is of great importance in these investigations, so 
much so that it has received a special name, and is called the 
Metacentre.
It is defined as the point where the vertical line 
through the centre of buoyancy cuts the original vertical line 
through the centre of gravity.
Its position will change with every 
change in the inclination of the boat, but in many common types 
of boat this change is very small, so that within certain limits M 
may be taken as a fixed point.
We may say then that stability is 
secured by a high metacentre, or by a broad flat floor which will 
give a high metacentre.
We shall see that it may also be secured 
by a heavy weight carried low ; but in many vessels and boats 
such a weight would be inconvenient, in which case the broad flat 
floor is the only safe form.
Trading steamers are always built 
with a flat floor, and so are life boats ; the figure in fact represents 
very fairly the ordinary midship section of a life boat.
On these 
lakes the sharp floor is a very common fault.
It .should be noted 
and avoided.
With a large party, including ladies and children, 
especial care should be taken to choose a flat floored boat, not 
much under five feet broad.
Such a boat, if not overloaded, may 
be considered absolutely safe.
I may remark, though it has 
nothing to do with stability, that very nervous people, and persons 
with a turn for practical joking, should not be invited to join the 
party, and also that a captain should be chosen before leaving 
shore — a precaution which should never on any account be 
neglected.

Lighter Rowing Boats.
Light boats constructed for speed alonehave usuallya nearly cir- 
cular section (see Fig. 6).
This^makes the calculation of their stability 
very simple, since it is evident at once to any one with a very slight 
knowledge of mathematics, that the metacentre in the case of a 
circular section will not change its position, but remain fixed at the 
centre of the circle, to whatever angle the boat be heeled.
In 
racing skiffs intended for a single person the metacentre will be 
but a few inches, say three or four, above the water line, In such 
boats the centre of gravity will commonly be above the metacentre, 
and the boats will^have no stability at all.
It is in fact a very 
difficult feat of balancing to sit still in a boat of this kind holding 
the oars out of water ; and any one unused to race rowing who 
should venture to get into such a boat, would be immediately 
upset.
In the larger racing boats the metacentre is naturally 
higher, and, as the centre of gravity is not raised in the same 
degree, they have a little stability.
It is, however, but little ; and 
in such boats the greatest precaution is necessary, and very strict 
discipline is commonly observed.
No one moves without orders ; 
on getting in, the men"are handed to their places one by one, and 
each sits down before the next steps in, the same^care being used 
in getting out of the boat.
The lighter boats in use on these lakes 
have a good deal more stability than regular racing boats, but still 
they are crank, and not,'in my judgment,^safe in the hands of 
careless or inexperienced people.
Some of them are the more 
dangerous because the defect of the sharp floor renders them less 
stable than from their size and weight they appear.
Safety in 
light boats can only be secured by care and skill, and in very light 
boats only by the strict observance of the racing precautions.
The 
sad accidents which occur from time to time on our lakes afford a 
strong and melancholy proof of the necessity of care.
Ladies and 
children should never be taken in light boats, nor infirm or very 
clumsy people, nor large dogs ; in~many light boats it is unwise to 
attempt to change seats, a thing never in any boat to be done 
without care.
196 
Sailing Boats.
Sailing boats have to encounter a different class of risk from 
rowing boats, and must be constructed on altogether different 
principles.
A rowing boat should always be kept on an even keel ; 
a sailing boat is not usually doing her best till she lies over about 
thirty degrees.
She is intended to sail at about this angle, and to 
withstand the capsizing power of the wind.
In a fresh breeze the wind moves at the rate of about fifteen 
miles an hour, and exerts a pressure of about one pound on every 
square foot of surface directly exposed to it.
This pressure 
becomes very much greater in a gale, increasing with the square 
of the velocity of the wind.
It is said to have reached on some 
occasions to one hundred pounds per square foot; but the 
observations are a little doubtful.
One pound, as I said, to the 
foot is about the pressure in a good breeze.
The Windermere 
yachts spread about looo square feet of canvas, more or less; so 
that if these sails were held firmly in a plane perpendicular to the 
wind, there would be a pressure upon them of nearly half a ton.
Practically, the motion of the boat and the inclination of the sails 
diminish the pressure very considerably.
Of what remains, a part 
goes to drive the boat, and a part, — the greater part when the boat 
is on the wind, — to heel her over.
The heeling of the boat, like 
every motion of rotation, is caused by the action of a couple, the 
one force being, as I have said, the pressure of the wind, the other 
the lateral resistance of the water.
Just as in every body there is 
a point at which the whole weight of the body may be supposed 
to act, so in every surface there is a point at which the whole of 
any uniform pressure on that surface may be supposed to be 
applied.
In the case of the sails of a boat this point is called the 
Centre of Pressure ; in the case of the surface of the hull exposed 
to the lateral pressure of the water, it is called the Centre of 
Lateral Resistance.
The couple which tends to heel the boat over 
consists then of the force of the wind acting at the Centre of Pressure 
of the sails, and the resistance of the water acting at the Centre of 
Lateral Resistance (see Fig. 7).
The calculation of these centres 
197 
involves very serious difficulties of principle which, however, affect 
the determination of their position forward and aft, rather than 
their height, with which we are now concerned.
We may assume 
that in most of the Windermere yachts the centre of pressure is 
from fifteen to twenty feet above the centre of lateral resistance.
Hence the heeling power of the wind may reach to nearly half a 
ton, acting at the end of an arm fifteen or twenty feet long.
We 
evidently require a strong righting couple to counteract a power 
like this.
It will not be sufficient for safety that the righting power of 
the boat should be ultimately greater than any heeling power that 
can ordinarily be brought to bear upon her; there must be a 
considerable margin.
That the righting power should be at last 
overcome by the heeling power is not the only, or indeed the chief, 
danger, — which arises from what we may call angular momentum.
When a boat is nearly on an even keel, the arm of the righting 
couple is short, and if she then be struck by a squall of moderate 
strength, she will heel over.
In doing so she will acquire an 
angular motion, and this motion will not be at once checked when 
the arm of the righting couple is so lengthened by her heeling over 
as to make the righting force equal to the heeling force.
Just as a 
pendulum when let go will swing past the position of equilibrium, 
so will a boat pass the position in which the righting and heeling 
forces would be equal.
It is this which makes sudden squalls 
striking a boat when nearly upright so dangerous, it is this which 
constitutes a part of the danger of that moment when a boat has 
just gone about, when of necessity she comes into an upright 
position.
On lakes like ours, where with the utmost care a steers- 
man must in the long run be occasionally taken a little by surprise, 
there is no safety but in thoroughly sound principles of construc- 
tion.
Now the chief safeguard against capsizing is this, that the 
action of the boat in heeling over tends of itself very materially to 
diminish the pressure on the sails.
The law of this diminution is 
not quite settled, but according to what seems the most probable 
theory, and fairly borne out in practice, we should have the 
198 
following very noticeable results.
When a boat heels over 30 
degrees, the pressure is diminished by about ^, when she heels 
over 45 degrees, by about ^S, when she heels over 60 degrees, 
by about ^, of its original amount.
Hence a boat should have a 
fairly high side, and be well decked in, so that she may heel over 
to a high angle without swamping.
Besides, her stability should 
go on increasing up to 50 degrees or 60 degrees, so that the 
resistance may be strengthened as the attack is weakened.
A good 
power of recovery when heeled over to a high angle is the essential 
element of safety.
A well designed boat has this power, and an 
ill designed boat, or a row boat with sails up has not.
The one is 
almost absolutely safe with reasonable care ; the greatest skill and 
watchfulness cannot quite ensure this safety to the others.
The stability suited to a sailing boat, that which goes on 
increasing up to a high angle of heel, can only be given by a heavy 
weight carried low.
Racing yachts are so ballasted that the 
centre of gravity is but very little above the centre of buoyancy ; 
in some yachts, and as I should judge, in most of the Windermere 
racers, it is actually below it.
Referring to our first rough con- 
ception of stability in connection with Fig. 3, we shall see that if 
G be originally as low as C, the vertical line through G will not 
move towards C as the vessel heels over ; and if G be lower than 
C, the vertical line through G will recede from C rather than 
approach it.
Hence the chief cause which puts a stop to the 
increase of stability at high angles will be removed if G be by 
efficient ballasting got well down.
In this way a stability increasing 
up to 50 degrees or 60 degrees may be obtained without prejudice 
to speed, and this is more than enough for all practical require- 
ments.
It is seldom advantageous to sail a boat at a greater 
angle than 30 degrees, and between 30 degrees and 60 degrees 
there is a wide margin to cover all accidental risks.
In a flat floored boat the ballast can never be got down very 
far below the water line, so that the centre of gravity cannot be 
low, especially if, as is the case in regular sailing boats, a consider- 
able weight in mast, spars, sails, and rigging be carried at some 
height above the water.
Hence the flat floor, the best form for 
199 
rowing boats, is not fitted for boats intended to carry a press of sail, 
or to navigate squally waters.
There are many types of boats with 
somewhat flat floors, but it will require close attention to the 
disposition of the weights to obtain in any of them an increase of 
stability after 25 degrees, while in some 12 degrees or 14 degrees 
is the limit of the maximum of stability.
In other words, a force 
sufiicient to heel these boats over 12 degrees, 14 degrees, or 25 
degrees, would, if it continued to act, infallibly capsize them.
Such boats could never lie over in a squall till the wind emptied 
from their sails, and then recover : they have usually great initial 
stability, but power of recovery they have none.
It would be too 
much to say that these boats are unsafe under sail, since our 
smaller fishing boats and shore boats generally are of this type ; 
but it is to be observed that these are very lightly masted, that 
they never carry a press of sail, that they are seldom exposed to 
such squalls as are common on our lakes, and that they are in the 
hands of men bred and born to the work.
Under these conditions 
they enjoy a tolerable immunity from accident, but they are not 
suited to our watep.
Some years ago centre-board boats of the 
original American pattern were introduced on Windermere, very 
broad, with a midship section shewing a very flat floor, and having 
little or no ballast.
They were cheap, fast, and exceedingly handy, 
but their lack of power of recovery caused them to be viewed with 
disfavour.
The Yacht Club excluded them from the races, and they 
have now disappeared, though a few centre-boarders of a better type 
are still seen.
Even these are scarcely, in my judgment, fit to go 
through much heavy weather in the hands of amateurs.
For this 
there is nothing but a heavy weight of lead carried at least four or 
five feet below the water.
With a well designed boat, good gear, and competent manage- 
ment, there is nothing to excite apprehension in sailing on 
Windermere.
It is no more dangerous than driving in a carriage.
A boat not fit to go through squalls, bad gear, and carelessness, 
involve serious risk.
Yet considering how often and how recklessly 
the conditions of safety are disregarded, the accidents are wonder- 
fully few.

THE GREAT LAKE, LAGOON, OR BAY OF TRITON.
By B.
A. IRVING, M.A.
(Read at Ambleside.
) 
At the very dawn of history we find the continental shores of 
that sea which surrounds Cyprus, viz.
Phoenicia and Cilicia, filled 
with a race of mariners, who for full one thousand years managed 
the carrying trade of the then known world.
With a sea-board by no means remarkable for good harbours, 
or sheltered roadsteads, the dwellers in Tyre and Sidon had the 
largest merchant navy in the Mediterranean.
They under- 
took the most distant voyages.
They indisputably frequented 
the stormy seas of our own Cornwall to the west, whilst in the 
east they were known in Indian seas as far as Ceylon.
It is 
probable that they penetrated into the Baltic in the north, whilst it 
is certain that in the persons of some of their colonists they circum- 
navigated Africa.
Their colonies were found scattered over the whole Mediter- 
ranean, in positions chosen with a most far-sighted judgment.
Almost invariably they selected peninsulas, or small islands 
adjacent to the mainland — inaccessible to an enemy by land, 
easily defended by sea.
Of these by far the greatest and most remarkable was Carthage.
Situated near the modern Tunis, exactly opposite Sicily, she so 
rapidly grew in power and prosperity, as totally to eclipse, in the 
west at any rate, the glory of the mother country.
She in her turn sent out colonies still further west, and 
founded cities, whose sites are even now occupied by important 
m 
towns.
Such was Carthagena, at present the naval arsenal and 
station for the Spanish Mediterranean fleet.
Such were Cadiz, the 
largest Spanish port on the Atlantic, and Port Mahon in Minorca.
All these were Carthaginian settlements, and their present import- 
ance still attests the clever foresight of their ancient founders.
But it is to Carthage itself that I would specially direct 
attention.
Like all Phoenician colonies, she was situated on 
something of the nature of a peninsula — on a promontory, standing 
far out into the centre of the Mediterranean.
And when we have 
named this, we have named all her apparent advantages for 
commerce.
Her country was the present regency of Tunis, and 
perhaps a part of Algeria — a land by no means extraordinarily 
gifted with productions to interchange with those of other regions.
At the present moment its exports are less than any other country 
on the north coast of Africa.
Something may be due to bad 
government, but a deficiency of water prevents any extensive 
agriculture, and the Sahara, a bare and almost pathless desert of 
four thousand miles, to the south cuts her off from the centre of 
the continent.
For a large commercial town to exist, there must be some 
important inland region which supplies its productions and super- 
fluities to be interchanged against those of other lands.
In the 
case of Carthage this law would appear to fail.
Yet in very 
ancient times, Carthage was indisputably rich and prosperous.
She 
waged long wars with Greeks for the possession of Sicily — wars, in 
which were fought battles of first-rate importance — wars, in which 
were engaged fleets so large, as could only be furnished by a state, 
not only of great maritime power, but also of great internal 
resources.
She afterwards waged three long wars extending over one 
hundred and fifteen years with Rome, then mistress of all south of 
the Alps, i.e. of what is now the modern Italy, for the supremacy 
of the western world.
She was mistress of the European Peninsula, 
the present Spain and Portugal, and much of the south of France.
She held Sardinia, Corsica, Malta, and the Balearic Islands, and 
only submitted to Rome after a struggle, illustrated by numberless 
203 
important and terrible battles, in which it was more than once on 
the cards, that Rome herself might perish, and Carthage become 
the leading state of the west, and the Mediterranean a Carthaginian 
lake.
Then the civilization of the west would have been Phoenician 
in place of Roman, and we ourselves deriving the ground-work of 
our thought, language, and habits from a Carthaginian, instead 
of a Latin source.
The fiat of Cato, however — delenda est Carthago — Carthage 
must be destroyed — won its way.
She succumbed before the 
arms of the younger Scipio, and both the Roman and the Greek 
historian, who have given us the particulars of her fall, and have 
narrated the cold-blooded treachery and cruelty displayed by her 
conqueror, incidentally give us also an extraordinarily grand idea 
of her size, prosperity, and magnificence.
She perished utterly.
Yet such were the unrivalled advantages 
of her situation, such the resources of her inland country, that in 
less than thirty years Carthage was refounded by the Romans 
themselves.
Again she rose to be one of the most important 
towns in the Roman empire ; and lastly, when that empire was 
tottering to its fall beneath the assaults of the Barbarians of the 
north, by a strange destiny Carthage became the capital of the 
Vandals, and their ruler, Genseric, captured and sacked imperial 
Rome itself From this time Carthage gradually decreased in 
importance, until in our own day, a few ruins, an aqueduct, and a 
series of magnificent vaulted reservoirs, are all that remain of this 
ancient splendour — all that remain of a city whose walls were 
twenty miles in circumference, and whose population numbered 
700,000.
Tunis, its modern representative, though the largest 
and most important of the towns on the Barbary coast, is never- 
theless a city of but very third-rate importance.
To myself at any rate, it had ever been a matter of difficulty, 
on considering its modern condition, to account for the ancient 
prosperity of this region.
Carthage, as a colony of Tyre, it is true, 
had some crumbs of that Indian commerce which has encouraged 
the enterprise and increased the riches of every nation which has 
conducted it, from the Tyrians to the English.
But what could 
204 
this effect against the resources of a large, prosperous, and united 
country like Italy?
Venice, some one will suggest, possessed a 
similar power.
But Venice was powerful in the resources of war, 
not only from her possession of money, but also and mainly by her 
possessions on the mainland — the rich plains of Lombardy, and 
the countries to the north of the Adriatic, which were as much 
Italian and Venetian as Venice herself Nor again, let me remark, 
did Venice alone ever engage in long wars with a powerful and 
warlike empire.
Whereas Carthage was seemingly a single city, 
with a territory of no great size, on the edge of a huge desert, yet 
wielding an influence in the history of the world, such as only 
belongs to great states, backed by the resources of an extensive 
and rich country.
Surely this is a problem in history requiring 
solution.
Again, in the history of the Punic wars, and especially of the 
second or Hannibalian war, we are astonished at the extensive use 
made by the Carthaginians of elephants.
Yet north of the Sahara 
no elephants are now found, and though they have been recently 
recommended for the prosecution of African discovery, no elephants 
of that continent are anywhere, or as far as we know have anywhere 
at any time been domesticated.
Whence then did the Carthaginians 
obtain these monsters ?
It is true that the Syrian kings, the successors of Alexander, 
whose empire extended to India, made use of these animals, and 
these were undoubtedly brought overland from regions beyond the 
Indus.
It is within the bounds of possibility that those of Carthage 
may have come from the same region to Tyre, and may have been 
transported thence by sea to Africa.
As, however, before the 
Greek conquest of Asia, we never hear of their employment either 
in Persia, or Babylonia, or Syria, countries through which they 
must have passed to reach Tyre, nor again in the great Persian 
wars against Greece, it is highly improbable that any reached 
Carthage by this route.
Whilst lastly, from the constitution of the 
elephant, and the large amount of food and water which it requires, 
it is unable to cross a desert of very limited extent, much less the 
immense Sahara.
205 
We are reduced then to the assumption that there was once a 
time when the elephant was found in North Africa, How this 
talHes with what must have been the ancient condition of the 
country, we shall presently see.
I will now direct attention to a totally different subject — a 
puzzle in Mythology.
There was a Greek goddess, Athene or 
Pallas Athene, probably meaning the Virgin Athene, Pallas being 
a title of respect.
She was, like Minerva among the Romans, the 
goddess of wisdom.
All arts and science, especially those con- 
nected with law, order, and government — all that conduced to the 
welfare of man — all skill in what was held to be noble, were 
attributed to her.
As skill in war was, and unfortunately is still, 
of vital importance to man, though not loving war for its own sake, 
she was still looked upon as the author of all that in war was 
prudent, and likely to be followed with favourable results, and so 
she was represented as a Virgin Armed.
To pourtray her exact 
character, and reconcile all its peculiarities, would occupy too 
much of our time.
We may, however, sum up all in one word.
She was regarded by the Greeks as the author of what we call 
civilization, and if we can discover her origin, we shall know to 
what source the Greeks attributed their earliest civilization.
According to a well-known story given us by Hesiod, the 
oldest author who has treated of these matters, Metis, or Thought, 
was the first wife of Zeus, or the Bright one, the Greek god.
When 
Metis was pregnant with Athene, Zeus swallowed her up, and he 
himself gave birth to Athene, who sprang from his head.
A myth, 
which has the obvious meaning, that civilization sprang from God, 
or as St. James puts it, "Every good gift, and every perfect gift is 
from above, and cometh down from the Father of Light." 
But where did Zeus, or the Father of Light, according to 
Greek notions, produce civilisation 1 The oldest epithets of 
Athene were Trito, Tritonis, Tritogenia, or Tritoginis.
Such 
is she called by Hesiod at her birth, that is the one born at, 
or from, or of Triton.
Various are the explanations of this term, 
which was quite as unintelligible to ancient authors as to ourselves.
That she was born at a place called Triton, was the usual 
206 
conjecture.
But the position of this place was a matter of doubt.
Some pointed to a paltry stream in Baeotia, in Greece ; some to 
other localities.
The most common explanation referred the 
epithet to a river or lake, with which the ancients were very 
imperfectly acquainted, in the centre of Libya, — their name for 
the continent of Africa.
That is, the civilization of Greece, and 
thereby of the West and ourselves, had its origin in Africa.
A 
very strange idea, yet perhaps not altogether devoid of foundation.
Now turn to another difficulty, semi-mythological.
Long 
before the age of Homer, and the siege of Troy, fifty of the great 
Greek chieftains had undertaken the first bold maritime adventure 
on record — called from Argo, the name of their ship, the Argo- 
nautic Expedition.
The different accounts of their route are 
perfectly irreconcileable with our present geographical knowledge, 
or in fact with one another.
They give us, however, what were 
the earliest notions of the Greeks as to the geography of the world, 
and the earliest of the many accounts of this voyage represent the 
sailors of the good ship Argo, as returning into the Mediterranean 
from the West of Africa by carrying their ship on their shoulders 
across Libya, until they came to Lake Triton, when they sailed 
into the Mediterranean, and so homewards to Greece.
Strange, 
yet after all, perchance true !
The next notice which we have of the geographical knowledge 
of the ancients is found in the narrative of the adventures of 
Ulysses, as given by Homer in the Odyssey.
In relating his 
wanderings, Homer has no doubt intended to display all the 
knowledge of his day in reference to distant lands.
The farthest 
region to which he sends his hero, a voyage of full ten days from 
Cape Matapan, the southern extremity of Greece, is to a coast 
whose inhabitants lived on lotos, or the fruit of the jujube tree.
Here his companions land for water.
Three of his sailors open 
negotiations with the natives.
These they find a mild, hospitable 
people, in character not unlike the South Sea Islanders — themselves 
also a race of vegetarians.
The three sailors, wearied with the ten 
days' storm, attempt to desert, and join the natives, and are with 
difficulty driven on board again by our hero.
For fear the rest should 
207 
follow their example, and prefer the sweet lotos — doubly grateful, as 
was natural, to sailors long afloat — and residence among a mild and 
happy people, like a prudent captain, Ulysses leaves the seductive 
coast.
Such is the simple narrative of Homer, neither improbable nor 
inconsistent with our notions of what under the circumstances 
would be likely to occur.
From this, however, future poets, 
Thomson and our own poet-laureate among the rest, have elabor- 
ated descriptions of a fairy-like land.
"In which it seemed always afternoon," 
and where 
" Branches they bore of that enchanted stem.
Laden with fruit and flower, whereof they gave 
To each, but whoso did receive of them, 
And taste, to him the gushing of the wave 
Far, far, away did seem to mourn and rave 
On alien shores ; and if his fellow spake.
His voice was thin, as voices from the grave ; 
And deep asleep he seemed, yet all awake, 
And music in his ears his beating heart did make." 
And SO forth.
Most beautiful poetry, but not one word of which, 
as far as I see, is to be found in Homer, but like the German's 
camel, has been elaborated by poets from the depths of their inner 
consciousness.
And pray let this be said with all due deference 
and respect to the poet's testy and amusing, but a propos warning: — 
" Vex not thou the poet's mind 
With thy shallow wit : 
Vex not thou the poet's mind, 
For thou canst not fathom it." 
After an interval of nearly a thousand years, we find another 
poet, Virgil, in close imitation of Homer, conducting his hero, 
i^neas, in a voyage almost the exact counterpart of that of Ulysses 
.(Eneas visits the Syrtes, the region of the Lotophagi, but finds 
there nothing but storm and tempest and quicksand.
Instead of 
Tennyson's "melancholy, mild-eyed Lotos-eaters," he is met by a 
race rich and prosperous, but inhospitable to strangers, and his 
208 
description of this region, though not altogether in accordance 
with, yet more approximates to, the character of the district at the 
present day.
He represents it, however, as very rich, and in this he is 
upheld by other contemporary writers.
About the time of the 
Christian era to be a Libyan land-owner, was to be rich to a 
proverb.
Italy, like England at the present day, did not grow 
sufficient corn for its own subsistence.
The Roman province of 
Africa, the modern Tunis, was its granary, and more especially the 
granary of Rome.
That this was the case is incontrovertible.
The land was covered with wealthy cities, and was an important 
factor in every civil war.
In short, we may say that it was the 
batde of Thapsus and the conquest of this region, which gave 
Rome its first emperor.
For ages Europeans have been prevented through the fanati- 
cism of the Moslems from going far from the shore, but recent 
explorations lead us to suppose that the country is covered in an 
extraordinary degree with the ruins of great cities, of which, 
probably, not more than a fourth have been visited or are known.
Davis, the explorer of Carthage, in the course of a not very 
protracted journey, found everywhere the remains of what must 
have been magnificent cities.
He speaks of passing as many as 
twenty ruined villages, mostly Roman, but nameless, in the course 
of a single day.
At Mokthar, a few days' journey from Tunis, are 
the remains of a large city, six miles in circumference, with suburbs 
of larger extent, and the ruins of triumphal arches, mausoleums, 
walls, gates, etc., and the whole plain studded with the evidence of 
a vast city.
In estimating from their ruins the population of ancient towns, 
we must bear in mind that the remains usually only represent the 
public buildings, and the houses of a few of the richest inhabitants.
The great mass of the people lived in mud hovels, and even mere 
booths, and many no doubt, as at present in Naples, in the open 
air.
Consequently when we find a plain of several miles in extent, 
covered with ruins, we have before us evidence of the existence of 
a population much greater than at first sight might be imagined.
209 
At Hydra again, and Thala, and Sbaitla, Davis found the 
same indications of byegone population and prosperity.
At 
Sbaitla, when taken in the 7th century by the Mahometans, each 
cavalry-soldier received 3000 gold dinars, or above ;^iooo, as his 
share of the plunder.
At Eljem, there is a Roman amphitheatre, almost equal in 
size to that at Verona, but grander in appearance, and only sur- 
passed, if surpassed at all, by the Coliseum at Rome.
It would occupy too much time to cite examples, but the 
whole of Davis's work produces on the mind the impression, that 
Africa Proper, or the Regency of Tunis, was at one time a region 
perfectly teeming with wealth and population, and Tristram in his 
work on the Sahara does not hesitate to call it " the sepulchre of 
buried nations." 
Lastly, as we come to modern times, the idea of wealth and 
prosperity attached to these regions gradually fades away.
An 
opposite idea takes its place.
They are regarded as sterile and 
poor, suffering from drought and proximity to the Sahara, and 
though so near to Europe, are far removed from its civilization.
Now to summarize the facts at which we have arrived.
Firstly.
Along the coast of Africa, opposite to Sicily, there 
existed in very ancient times an opulent city, the mother of many 
important colonies.
That now, though one half of what formed 
her dominions, viz., the country sloping to the Mediterranean, 
is in the main a poor and wretched country, and the other half, viz.
that sloping towards the south, is little better than a barren desert, 
yet there is- reason to suppose that the whole in olden times teemed 
with riches and plenty.
That in consequence, she was enabled to contend for many 
years for the mastery of the world with Italy, then no mere geo- 
graphical expression, but united under a government remarkably 
warlike, firm, and centralized.
That though she ultimately 
succumbed, and was utterly destroyed, yet apparently in conse- 
quence of the unrivalled character of her country, she soon rose 
from her ashes.
That this country became afterwards the granary 
of Italy, and more especially of Rome, at the height of her power, 
15 
210 
That she became remarkable for the number and wealth of her 
cities, that afterwards in Christian times she contained six hundred 
bishoprics.
That, notwithstanding the scantiness and poverty of 
her present population, there are everywhere, at this very moment, 
ruins, which bear witness to the truth of the accounts of, and 
references to, her former greatness and fertility.
Secondly.
That the Carthaginians were famed for the use of 
elephants, and that there is reason for supposing they found them 
in their own country, though at present its physical character 
precludes their existence as wild animals north of the Sahara.
Thirdly.
That the Greeks attributed the origin of knowledge 
and civilization to some region in the interior of Africa.
Fourthly.
That in the earliest account of maritime discovery, 
the history of the Argonautic expedition, we find the fifty heroes 
taking a strange course also through the interior of Africa, and 
apparently quite inconsistent with our present geographical 
knowledge.
Fifthly.
We find that Homer in order to display his acquaint- 
ance with regions, mysterious, though not absolutely unknown to his 
fellow-countrymen — which were probably as mysterious to them, as 
was the Spanish Main to the contemporaries of Drake, or the 
interior of New Guinea to ourselves — carries his hero into a region, 
where he finds a people living on vegetable diet, and presenting 
all the characteristics of such a race.
Lastly.
Without quoting examples, I may say, that there are 
in classical authors a large number of references to the district on 
the Lesser Syrtis, seemingly at discord with our present knowledge, 
and which to myself, at any rate, were once totally inexplicable.
To all these, however, I am inclined to think that I found the 
key this summer in the Paris Exhibition.
As I was leaving it for the last time, I happened to ramble 
into a little court, which the Ministry of Public Instruction had 
devoted to some curiosities of travel.
Here was a very roughly 
executed model by Capt.
Roudaire to show the feasibility of 
covering the whole of the country south of Tunis, and part of 
Algeria, for three hundred miles in length and forty in breadtti, 
211 
with water, i.e. for forming a new gulf in the Mediterranean, 
containing an area somewhat greater than the Irish Sea. In 
considering his views of what was once, and what again might be 
the condition of this district, there flashed upon my mind the 
explanation of the difficulties which have been enumerated.
Along the whole northern coast of Africa, from Cape Bon to 
the Straits of Gibraltar, runs a range of mountains of varying height.
In the regency of Tunis, bearing the name of the Auress Mountains, 
they rise with snowy peaks, for some part of the year, to the height 
of 6000 feet.
Crossing Algeria with diminished elevation, they 
finally reach their grandest proportions in Morocco, and under the 
name of the Atlas Mountains, attain 1 2,000 feet, and are covered 
with perpetual snow.
It is with their eastern extremity that our 
business lies.
Until m an hour, happy for itself and humanity, 
Algeria was occupied by the French, this region was unknown.
Beyond the Auress Mountains was the desert, and there were 
marked upon ancient maps vague traces of lakes with the name 
Lams Tritonidis attached, and probably a note of interrogation 
followed, to indicate that the site was entirely uncertain.
Now, however, all can be traversed in safety, and the French 
authority is in the main willingly acknowledged as far south as 
Touggourt and Wady Souf, and military posts, and farms, dependent 
in some cases for their existence on Artesian Wells, are found at 
Chegga and El Feid, and other places south of the Auress Moun- 
tains, and Biskra is rapidly becoming a sort of Arab Paris.
Nowhere are the contrasts of nature more striking than in 
this southern part of the French province of Constantina.
There 
meet at the Auress Mountains, the Mons Aurasius of the Romans, 
the Djebel Auress of the Arabs, — two worlds which are total 
opposites.
On the one side are snowy peaks, broad mountain 
pastures, forests, streams of water, picturesque villages, vying with 
each other in the riches and fertility of their gardens.
On the 
other side, to the south, is a plain parched by a burning sun, an 
horizon without limit; hot, rugged mountain sides with broken 
precipices and deep ravines, without vegetation, strangely harmo- 
nizing with the aridity beyond.
Here and there, within the near 
212 
view, are a few oases inhabited by the descendants of the ancient 
Berbers, the Kabyles, among whom are found in abundance men 
with fair complexions and blue eyes, a laborious, sedentary people, 
fond of agriculture, and with a love for the soil and their homes.
Further south the eye is struck by a deep depression of the ground.
Beyond, the extreme view is bounded by the Sahara, with its 
nomad Arab tribes.
In the depression the eye is arrested by a vast dazzling gleam 
of light from the Chott Mel-rir.
The name Chott is applied by the natives to shallow lakes, 
full of saline matter, where the water only remains for a certain 
portion of the year.
At other times the plain is covered with a 
thick coating of salt, and presents for all the world the appearance 
of a vast field of white jelly, or of camphor, as a Frenchman 
describes it.
It then conceals in places deep holes and quicksands, 
where an unwary step might lead to certain death.
These chotts are extremely numerous, and are all more or 
less connected with one another, and extend in an unbroken line 
from Chegga, where the river Djedi falls into the Chott Mel-rir, 
to within a few miles of the Gulf of Gabes in the Mediterranean.
The three largest are the Chott Mel-rir, the Chott Rharsa, and 
Chott Djerid.
The first of these is the least dangerous, and 
portions of it are easily crossed.
The third, or most Easterly, the 
Chott Djerid, has peculiar perils.
It presents many of the 
characteristics of a lake covered with ice.
The covering, however, 
being a shell of salt of uncertain thickness.
In some places this 
would appear to rest upon the ground, in others upon water, in 
others upon quicksand ; whilst there are at times places where the 
water is withdrawn, and the shell of salt suspended in the air.
At 
other times a violent wind will disturb it with the oscillations of 
slow waves.
In short, its behaviour is in this respect exactly like 
that of our own lakes when covered with ice.
One or two caravan 
routes across this Chott have been known for many years, but 
whoever wanders to the right or left of the recognised track, 
exposes himself to very great risk, and even the frequented routes 
are not devoid of danger.

( CAPTAIN ROUDAIRE.
213 
In one of the vols, of the Scientific Exploration of Algeria (a 
work published by the French Government), a tale is told of a 
caravan of one thousand camels crossing the Chott, when one of 
the animals wandered a little from the way, and, as is their wont, 
was followed by all behind, and all successively disappeared in a 
sort of quicksand.
And Moula-Ahmed, the authority for this 
story, states that when he crossed it, a surface of one hundred and 
fifty feet in breadth suddenly gave way, engulfing the men and 
camels who happened to be upon it, and none of whom escaped.
Such are the Chotts, obviously the relics of an ancient sea, 
from the shallow parts of which the water has already vanished, 
and whose less shallow pai'ts are now in process of being dried up.
The deep hollow in which these chotts lie, soon attracted the 
attention of the French after they became masters of Algiers, and 
the question arose, was it beneath the level of the Mediterranean ?
Many facts pointed to the probability of this being the case ; and 
at last the French Government, in 1876, entrusted to Captain 
Roudaire, who had drawn public attention to this subject, and its 
importance, in an able and interesting article in the Revue des 
Deux Mondes, in 1874., the determination of this problem : and it 
was the model of this district, based upon the levels he had just 
taken, which drew my attention to the matter this last summer.
In his report to the Ministry of Public Instruction, he gives a 
most instructive account of the methods by which he conducted 
and verified his levels, and the difficulties with which his 
observations were beset, owing to the extraordinary and ever 
varying atmospheric movements taking place in the heated air of 
the desert, and which are familiar to us as the cause of mirage.
Suffice it to say, that he found the Chott Djerid separated from the 
Gulf of Gabes by an isthmus about twenty-five miles across, the 
highest part of which was about one hundred and thirty feet above 
the sea.
That the surface of the Chott Djerid was about sixty 
feet above the Mediterranean.
That the isthmus of Kriz in its 
highest part was about one hundred and thirty feet above the 
Mediterranean.
That the surface of the Chott Rharsa was about 
sixty feet below the Mediterranean, as were the numerous Chotts 
2U 
between it and the Mel-rir.
And, lastly, that the Chott Mel-rir 
was about one hundred and fifty feet below the level of the 
Mediterranean.
That if the various isthmuses were pierced — 
beginning with the Isthmus of Kriz — though the Chott Djerid 
would be diminished in area, the great Chotts Rharsa and 
Mel-rir, and the numerous smaller Chotts would be vastly increased; 
and an inland sea, of the dimensions represented, would result 
therefrom.
The success of the Suez Canal has of late drawn the attention 
of Frenchmen to this subject.
Though to my mind sufficient 
observations to settle the practicability of the scheme, and specially 
soundings in the Chott Djerid have not yet been made, and its 
feasibility as yet by no means demonstrated, I shall hope to make 
it appear probable that the Chotts are the remains of such an inland 
sea which did once exist.
In a byegone age, either by some sudden convulsion of nature 
(and it has been remarked that the Isthmus of Melah lies along the 
volcanic axis, passing through the mountains, of Corsica and Sar- 
dinia), or, as is more probable, by a gradual upheaval, the isthmus 
of Melah was raised, and the communication with the Mediterranean, 
and so with the main ocean, closed.
Then followed the usual process.
Rapid evaporation under a sun but 34° from the Equator, annually 
removed more water than was supplied by the inflowing rivers.
The salts of the sea were left behind, and the remaining water, 
being supersaturated, the excess of mineral matter has been 
confusedly deposited, and a condition of things produced, such as 
we now see.
If, however, we study attentively the notices which ancient 
authors have left us of the history and geography of this part of 
Africa, we shall acquire the conviction that this basin not only did 
once, but did within historic times, communicate with the Mediter- 
ranean, and form an inner gulf, which, in conjunction with that 
which is now called Gulf of Gabes, or the Lesser Syrtis, was known 
under the name of the Great Lake, Lagoon, or Bay of Triton, and 
that the separation between the two finally took place about the 
commencement of the Christian Era.
2\o 
Herodotus, who wrote about 456 years B.C., is the first 
author who has given any geographical details about the Great 
Bay or Lake of Triton.
In describing it, he uses a word which 
may mean either an interior lake, or a lake belonging to the sea, 
otherwise called a lagoon — a word most appropriate to the object 
to which it is applied.
He describes this gulf as extending E.
and 
W. Where it leaves the main sea, on its South coast, he fixes 
apparently the country of the Lotos-eaters.
Then come the 
Machlyes, also eating the Lotos, but not to so gi-eat an extent.
These, 
he says, inhabit the shore as far as the great river Triton, which 
empties itself into the Lake in which is the Island of Phla.
He further relates how Jason and the Argonauts were driven 
by a tempest from Cape Matapan into the shallows of the Gulf of 
Triton, and that the God Triton shewed them the means of escape.
From this passage^it is obvious that the Gulf of Triton 
communicated with the sea, in fact, was so much a portion of it, 
that Herodotus makes no mention of the Lesser Syrtis (a name 
which arose afterwards) but considers the whole of the Lesser 
Syrtis and the sea to the river Triton as one gulf, to which he gives 
the name of the Great Lake, or Lagoon of Triton.
The next geographical account of this region is given by 
Scylax, or whoever was the author of the work called the Circum- 
navigation of the Mediterranean, and who probably wrote about 
200 B.C. He mentions in the Lesser Syrtis two islands — that of 
Brachion, on which grows the lotos, and the island Circinna.
These are obviously the present Djerba and Karkennah.
He then 
proceeds : — Towards the interior is found the Great Bay of Triton, 
which forms the extremity of the Little Syrtis and Lake Triton, 
with the Isle of Triton, and also the mouth of a river of the same 
name.
The entrance to the lake is narrow, and an island is seen 
at low tide, and then vessels are often not able to enter.
The lake 
is of considerable extent, and its shore inhabited by an African 
race, whose chief city lies on the Western coast.
Like Herodotus, Scylax speaks of the Little Syrtis and the 
Lake of Triton under the general name of the Great Bay of Triton.
But in the interval between Herodotus and Scylax, say two or 
216 
three centuries, the communication had become narrower, and not 
always deep enough for ships, and the two portions of the sea had 
already received separate names — The Lesser Syrtis and the Bay 
of Triton.
The next geographer who has described this region, is 
Pomponius Mela, 43 A.D.
"The Gulf of Syrtis," says he, "is 
dangerous not only on account of its shallows, but also on account 
of the ebb and flow of the sea.
Beyond this Gulf is Lake Pallas, 
or the Great Lake of Triton, which receives the waters of the river 
Triton." 
In another passage he tells us, that at a considerable distance 
from the shore, towards the interior of the country, there are barren 
plains, where are found skeletons of fishes, shells, oyster-shells, 
rounded pebbles, such as are found in the sea, anchors still 
attached to rocks, and other similar markSj which prove that the 
sea in former times extended thither.
From these passages we must infer that in the interval of two 
hundred years since Scylax, the Lake and the Gulf had ceased to 
have any longer a communication ; and, as no mention is made of 
the Isle of Triton, we may conclude that the waters were lowered 
by evaporation, and the Isle of Triton, as an island, no longer 
existed.
After the interval of a century, we come to the great .
Geographer and Mathematician, Ptolemy.
His account of this 
district is too long and too dry for quotation, but there results from 
it this — that Ptolemy knew, not of one, but of several lakes, but 
makes no mention of any communication with the sea.
He places, 
however, the mouth of the river Triton on the Little Syrtis, about 
the place, where in former times, had been the entrance into the 
Bay of Triton.
From these passages there arise the following inferences.
That at the time of Herodotus, there is a deep gulf with a large 
opening into the sea, and it, and the Little Syrtis, are known by 
the name of the Great Bay of Triton.
At the head of this Bay is 
the river Triton, and in it the island Phla.
Two hundred years later, at the time of Scylax, the Little 
217 
Syrtis and Lake Triton are still united by a channel, which is 
already becoming more narrow, and the island of Phla, under the 
name of Triton, still exists.
In the time of Pomponius Mela, two hundred years later still, 
or about the Christian era, the communication between the Lake 
and the Lesser Syrtis has already disappeared.
The Lake Triton 
is beyond the Syrtis and inland ; and travellers find, far removed 
from the sea, shells and pebbles and other evidence of its recent 
existence.
Then we come to the time of Ptolemy.
The waters have 
continued to settle.
They have definitely fixed themselves in the 
deeper depressions of the ancient bed.
The primitive basin is 
sub-divided into several lakes, and Ptolemy places the embouchure 
of the river Triton at the point, where was the former means of 
communication.
When to these ancient testimonies we add well-attested and 
wide-spread traditions among the Arabs and other races dwelling 
on the banks of the present Chotts, that these have had at one 
time communication with the sea, we can scarcely fail to identify 
in them (the Chotts) the ancient Bay of Triton.
The French government have had a series of levels run from 
Algiers and Bona to Biskra, and thence along the Chotts to the 
Gulf of Gabes.
Captain Roudaire, the engineer employed, has 
reported most carefully upon the possibility and means of again 
opening communication with the Mediterranean, and so re- 
producing a sea of some three hundred miles long and forty 
miles broad, and upon the consequences which the submersion of 
the Chotts would produce on the climate and welfare of Algeria, 
and in a greater degree upon that of Tunis.
These, without discussing the practicability of the reproduction 
of this ancient inland sea, we will consider, inasmuch as they will 
help us to realize the condition of things in this region in those 
ancient times, of which we have accounts so very inexplicable.
We have before us a phenomenon, which we know from geological 
sources to have happened repeatedly in byegone ages — which has 
everywhere, and especially in some parts of our own country, left 
218 
us vast beds of salt.
I mean the gradual drying up and disappear- 
ance of a sea, which in this case had a superficial extent soniewhat 
greater than that of the Irish Sea. And if the French finally 
decide, as is not improbable, to re-open the old communication 
with the Mediterranean, we shall be enabled to study the reverse, 
but an equally interesting problem, viz.
the effects, climatic or 
otherwise, arising from the formation of a new sea.
It may be stated that the engineers of the Suez Canal Co.
calculate that the requisite canals and earthworks may be con- 
structed for a million and a half of our money — a sum perfectly 
insignificant when compared with the enormous advantages which 
would accrue to Algeria alone by its southern slope being placed 
in convenient communication with the rest of the world by sea, 
not to speak of other and perhaps more important benefits.
I may 
add that M.
Lesseps is in favour of the scheme.
The formation of the Suez Canal, and the filling of the lakes 
in connection with it, have already had a marked effect on the 
climate of the Isthmus.
Formerly it hardly rained in twenty years, 
"now," says M.
Lesseps, "we are obliged to import tiles from 
France to cover our houses, and this year (1874) we have had a 
considerable amount of rain." 
There is a large evaporation from the lakes in communication 
with the Canal, due to the warm winds from the south.
These 
laden with moisture, as they rise, meet with a cold current from 
the north, and rain naturally results.
Exactly the same process will occur at the restored Bay of 
Triton.
The sirocco, and the hot winds from the Sahara, will 
blow over a sea between fifty and sixty times the size of the Suez 
Canal and all its lakes put together.
An enormous evaporation 
will take place.
Laden with moisture, these winds will at once 
meet with the lofty barrier of the Auress Mountains, the upper 
peaks of which are covered with snow for a certain part of the year, 
and running E.
and W., are placed like a vast condenser athwart 
their ptith.
Rapid condensation and copious rains will take place.
The rivers on the southern slope of the Auress Mountains which 
are now paltry streamlets, finally lost in the sand, will become 
219 
respectable streams, and with increasing volume will fall into the 
restored gulf.
The southern slope of these mountains, i.e. one half the 
Regency of Tunis, and a large portion of Algeria, now a desert, 
with here and there an oasis due to a natural spring or Artesian 
Well, will enjoy a certain, perhaps a plentiful rainfall, and be 
covered with vegetation.
This southern slope, with an inclination so gentle in many 
places as to form an immense jjlain, consists of an alluvium of 
remarkable fertility, which only requires water to produce many 
crops in the year.
Nor would the south wind alone bear off the evaporation from 
this vast sheet of water.
The other winds would also remove their 
share; and while that from the south fertilized the north, the 
eastern winds would carry moisture up the Valley of the Djedi, far 
away to the west.
Here it would be condensed by the high ground 
of Algeria and Morocco.
The River Djeddi, the ancient river 
Triton, would again acquire respectable dimensions, and drain an 
important and fertile valley, which is filled with a rich hard alluvial 
soil, in many parts of which barley is even now cultivated without 
artificial watering.* Whilst far away to the south, the oasis of 
Souf, and the country south of Chott Djerid and Tabaga Moun- 
tains, would be refreshed by an occasional shower.
In this again, 
we take no account of the water which will disappear by subter- 
ranean channels.
This will no doubt be very considerable, and 
will go to render fruitful spots impossible to specify, and thus con- 
tribute, often in some unseen way, to the general fertility.
At the present moment in parts of Algeria and Tunis, it is no 
unusual thing for the labours of months to be destroyed in a few 
hours by the sirocco, or southern wind.
With such fierce furnace- 
like heat does it leave the Sahara, that all tender vegetation 
succumbs before it— all moisture is absorbed, and it leaves the 
district it has traversed blasted, as though by absolute fire.
And 
yet this same wind, when in spring it reaches France and Spain, 
laden with moisture from the Mediterranean, causes all vegetation

to be developed in a marvellous fashion.
It is obvious that in 
crossing the restored Bay of Triton, some forty miles in breadth, 
its evil influence, though perhaps not always absolutely destroyed, 
will be considerably modified.
The new sea, again, will form a means of communication 
between regions south of the Atlas and the rest of the world.
This, and security for life and property, will be the only things 
needful for the agriculture and industry of these regions to attain 
a very high degree of prosperity.
The Valley of Djeddi, and all 
the south of Algeria and Tunis, will find itself in easy communi- 
cation with the Mediterranean.
What a new impulse will be given 
to the industry of this so long neglected country !
Its inhabitants 
are born merchants, and in the pursuits of commerce traverse the 
Sahara, as far as Timbuctoo and the Niger ; and even now, with 
everything against them, the exportation and importation between 
the Soudan and the coast of the Mediterranean is reckoned at 
more than ;^2, 000,000, of which English goods form no unim- 
portant part.
The whole of this trade takes place by means of 
camels, and is exposed on its route to all sorts of dangers, and 
many arbitrary exactions, and the greater part of it would converge 
towards the new sea, along the shores of which busy and important 
cities would of necessity again arise.
Thus may we speculate upon the changes likely to result from 
a revival of the Bay of Triton, and thereby realize the condition of 
this great depression, when connected with the Mediterranean.
The restoration of this communication is a French idea.
Mr.
Mackenzie, and a body of Englishmen, have drawn attention, 
however, to another supposed depression to the S.W., which they 
presume extends into the Sahara to an unknown distance.
By an 
opening on the west coast, opposite to the Canary Islands, through 
which at present flows the River Juby, Mr. Mackenzie imagines it 
possible to submerge by a canal of a few miles in length, a vast 
area, and so produce in the very centre of the vast continent, the 
same amelioration of climate, fertility, commerce, and civilization, 
as in Algeria and Tunis would result from the formation of the 
Bay of Triton.
An expedition has been sent to study this problem, 
221 
and has returned, I believe, without effecting anything-without 
taking any levels, or really having made any scientific investigation 
as to whether the assumed depression really exists or no.
The presence, however, of beds of salt in the Sahara, indicate 
that portions of it at any rate have been submerged, and there may 
perhaps have been a time at the very dawn of history, when a 
large portion of the Northern Sahara was Sea, and when one of 
Its gulfs was separated by no great interval from the Bay of Triton 
If such were the case, the mildness and equability of the re-ions 
around this Bay would be still further increased.
The violent hot 
wmds from the Sahara would not then have existed, but there 
must have resulted a climate hke that of the Azores or Canary 
Islands.
' 
That which now forms the Regency of Tunis and Algeria was 
then a peninsula, a little narrower than Italy towards the south 
and fanned on every side by mild sea-breezes.
The sea to the 
south, the Bay of Triton, was probably full of islands covered with 
verdure, with the rugged summits of the Auress Mountains 
bounding the northern horizon, the whole enjoying an unrivalled 
climate, and presenting, perchance, a scene of beauty without an 
equal in the northern hemisphere.
Here lived an intelligent race, who are described by Scylax as 
being, notwithstanding their yellowish colour, fine, handsome men 
and who may probably be identified with the Kabyles, still one of 
the nobler African races.
Here they obtained without any hard 
struggle, by agriculture, the necessaries of life, and had leisure and 
mchnation to cultivate its refinement.
It is in regions like these, where a race naturally intelligent 
andmventivehas had the fortune to be settled in places where 
the soil, not spontaneously, but with some expenditure of labour 
produces all that is necessary for bfe, that civilization has usuali; 
had ts first origin.
Such was the case in India, whose earliest 
cmlization was to be found in the basin of the Ganges, where 
there existed conditions such as we have described.
Su^h too 
was the case with Western Asia, where civilization radiated 'from 
the basin of the Euphrates and the Tigris.
Such was notably th" 
222 
case in Egypt, where a clever race, availing themselves of the Nile 
inundation, with slight labour supplied themselves not only with 
the necessaries, but with the superfluities of Ufe.
We may reasonably suppose then that the same was the case 
in the Bay of Triton.
Its various races very early finding the 
mere requirements of existence easy of attainment, provided 
themselves with superfluities.
These they exchanged for the 
productions of the islands and regions in connection with their 
bay.
As a consequence of this foreign intercourse, there arose a 
refinement and taste, regarded as wonderful in that age, and among 
their barbarous neighbours.
This with some diffidence I venture 
to suggest, as a not altogether unreasonable explanation of the 
oldest epithet applied to Pallas Athene, the goddess of wisdom, of 
Tritogeneia, or the goddess born on the Great Bay of Triton; 
and that in this one epithet lingers still the evidence of — the sole 
witness to — that prehistoric civilization.
Again, we may imagine that whilst the geographical conditions 
of this region were such as we have described, i.e. whilst the Great 
Bay of Triton penetrated behind the Auress Mountains, and 
perchance the Sahara was occupied in part by a great gulf from 
the Atlantic, that the Argonauts penetrated into that ocean.
Thence entering the Sahara Sea they discovered a point where 
it was only separated from the Bay of Triton by a narrow isthmus.
That across this isthmus they carried their ship.
Such a jDroceeding 
was, in ancient times, quite as common as a.
portage \n Canada, when 
an expedition to avoid rapids, or pass from one river-basin to 
another, carries its canoe and stores often for very long distances.
The Argonauts after crossing the isthmus, would then sail down 
the Bay of Triton into the open Mediterranean, and so finally 
regain their native land.
Though this explanation will no doubt be regarded as fanciful, 
it is not altogether destitute of interest.
There still stands forth 
the broad fact, that here is part of a tale — the oldest tale — of 
maritime adventure, — looked upon for twenty centuries as geo- 
graphically absurd, now shewn by modern discoveries to be quite 
within the range of what is possible, 
323 
A hundred years later and we come to Homer, whose geo- 
graphical knowledge in this direction only extended to the mouth 
of the Bay of Triton.
There, as we have seen, he places a 
vegetarian people, so far civilised that they presented the 
phenomenon, strange to our poet, of not considering all foreigners 
as enemies, and were, on the contrary, absolutely kind to travellers.
Hither then he brings his hero, Ulysses, and though his trans- 
lators — and those who have commented upon his poems — have long 
held this part of the Odyssey to be mere fictions of a poet's fancy, 
yet, view it in the light of sober reality, and observe how his 
description exactly tallies with that of such a region as we know 
must have here existed.
"For nine days," says Ulysses, "I was borne by the wild winds 
across the deep.
On the tenth we reached the land of the Lotos- 
eaters, who Hve on a vegetable diet.
There we drew up our ships 
upon the shore, and provided ourselves with water, and my 
comrades partook of their mid-day meal beside their ships.
Then 
I sent two of my men, and a third acting as herald, to gain 
acquaintance with the natives.
These receive them hospitably, 
and give them lotos-berries to eat; and," says Homer, "after they 
had eaten the sweet fruit of the lotos, they were unwilling to report 
themselves or come back, but wished to live there with the lotos- 
eaters, and give up all thoughts of return home." 
How many an English sailor, after weeks of hard sea-biscuit 
and putrid water, landing on an island in the Pacific among 
friendly natives, and tasting the bread-fruit, has longed to do the 
same.
But Ulysses would have no beach combers : he took the three, 
and by main force drove them on board, and put them in bonds.
But the rest, he says, I ordered at once hurriedly to embark, lest 
any of them should eat the lotos, and neglect to return.
Little, I trow, could our Poet Laureate, some twenty-five or 
thirty years ago, when he wrote the Lotos-eaters, know of the Bay 
of Triton and its- pre-historic condition, yet, by a strange chance, 
his dream-like picture conveys to the mind probably no untrue 
idea of what must indisputably have been the climate in this sea- 
enfolded region.
224 
" All round the coast the languid air did swoon, 
Breathing like one that had a troubled dream.
They saw the gleaming river seaward flow 
From the inner land : far off, three mountain tops,— 
Three silent pinnacles of aged snow,— 
Stood, sun-set flushed ; and, dewed with showery drops, 
Up clomb the shadowy pine above the woven copse.
The charmed sun-set lingered low adown 
In the red west : through mountain clefts, the vale 
Was seen far inland, and the yellow down 
Bordered with palm, and many a winding vale, 
And meadow, set with slender galingale." 
Again such a climate, not unlike that of Ceylon, would be 
admirably adapted for herds of elephants.
And there can be 
litde doubt that it was from the forests of his native land that 
Hannibal obtained those monsters with which he crossed the Alps, 
and which spread dismay among the Roman legionaries.
Now, too, we are in a position to understand the secret of the 
power of Carthage.
She ruled over a peninsula, not unlike that of 
Italy but more productive, and far more varied in its productions.
Not only was she situated in the very centre of the Mediterranean, 
in a position unrivalled for commanding the commerce of that sea, 
i e.
of the then known world, but she had the superfluities of her 
own rich and extensive country to change against those of distant 
regions.
Besides all this, she was mistress of this inland sea, the 
Great Lagoon of Triton, and shall we say, too, of the great 
Saharian Sea?
Any way, the whole trade between central Africa 
and the Mediterranean was in her hands-this trade, still 
important, which the French at this very moment-this very year- 
are using every effort to divert to Algeria, was in ancient times 
probably more extensive still.
When we reflect upon these things, the mystery regarding the 
secret source of the power of Carthage vanishes, and we see nothing 
improbable in her long struggle with Rome.
On the contrary, we 
begin to feel astonished, that a country of such great resources, so 
long the mistress of more than one sea, should have finally suc- 
cumbed to the arms of Rome.
We note, however, the invariable 
principle that the sons of the North have ever lorded it over the 
South.
225 
Again, in the present Bay of Gabes, the Lesser Syrtis of the 
ancients, the tides are probably higher than in any other portion 
of the Mediterranean.
Beyond this, there is no reason for con- 
sidering it more stormy than other parts of that sea.
The Romans, however, had a different idea.
They 
unanimously held that its navigation was the most dangerous 
within their knowledge, — dangerous for its terrible storms, and 
more especially dangerous for its quicKsands.
The ^neid of Virgil is in part an imitation of the Iliad, and 
in part of the Odyssey ; and the route taken by ^neas in his 
wanderings is, in the main, that taken by Ulysses.
Like Homer, 
Virgil brings his hero to the mouth of the Bay of Triton, the 
country of the Lotos-eaters ; but, strange to say, unlike Homer, he 
represents his hero as there -wrecked on a stormy coast, whose 
inhabitants were no longer the kindly Lotos-eaters, who received 
Ulysses and his crew, but savage and inhospitable to strangers.
In this, doubtless, Virgil reflects the ideas and knowledge of his 
own age ; and this divergence between the two poems can be only 
explained by considering what we know must have been the con- 
dition of the Bay of Triton in his time.
It still formed a part, and 
probably the most frequented part, of the Lesser Syrtis.
The desic- 
cation of the gulf we have seen had been for some time in process, 
and, presuming that the Saharian Sea was already in the main dried 
up, the Bay of Triton, in many places shallow and with broad sandy 
shores, must frequently have been lashed with typhoons, taking 
their rise, as they do now, in the heated regions of the Sahara, and 
like the hurricanes of the Gulf of Mexico, destroying all before 
them.
In a shallow, sandy sea, they would rouse huge waves, 
which would lash up the deep-lying sand, producing a wild turmoil 
of sea, and sand, and foam, and wind, such as we have on our own 
Goodwins, such as is graphically described by Virgil, and such as 
even modern ships could hardly withstand.
From the passages quoted, we may reasonably suppose that 
it was about the time of the Christian era that the Bay of Triton 
began to be finally separated from the Mediterranean.
There 
would then commence the process of desiccation.
The neigh- 
16 
226 
bouring regions, hitherto too mild and too moist for the production 
of most cereals, now became adapted for this purpose.
With this 
event, the rapid increase of population in Italy happened to 
synchronize.
The wants of Rome led to the growth of vast 
quantities of corn.
Rich Italians, and more especially the nobility 
of Rome, bought up huge tracts of public land, and vast numbers 
of slaves — a commodity which the wide-spread wars of the Romans 
had rendered cheap.
With these they stocked enormous farms, 
working them under hard task-masters, and sending as the fruits of 
their labour cargoes of corn to Rome.
There existed a condition of things very similar to that in the 
cotton plantations of the Southern States of America, before the war 
between the North and South, and one as profitable to these great 
Roman landowners as it was to the so-called " chivalry " of the 
Carolinas.
Under this system, however, as in the Southern States, a large 
amount of money was poured into the country, which itself rapidly 
increased in population.
Its cities which had hitherto consisted of 
collections of mud cottages and mere booths, or, as the Latins 
called them, 7Jiagalia, began to be adorned with buildings con- 
structed in stone, in accordance with the rules of Roman and 
Greek Architecture.
And it is to this period that the towns belong, 
whose ruins excite the astonishment of recent travellers.
At some date, not long after the Mahometan Conquest, the 
Bay of Triton finally lost all communication with the Mediterranean.
The surface for evaporation became less and less ; the southern 
slopes of the Auress Mountains were, in consequence, gradually 
dried up, and ultimately became a desert, with but here and there 
an oasis.
Meanwhile frequent droughts extended too to the 
Northern or Mediterranean slopes, and flights of locusts, the 
offspring of the new desert, damaged the crops.
The population 
decreased, and when to this we add the bad government of the 
Mahometan Conquerors, we can satisfactorily account for the 
present condition of these regions, and for their change from 
ancient greatness to modern insignificance.
227 
THE OLD MARYPORT FURNACE, AND ITS PLACE 
IN THE HISTORY OF IRON MANUFACTURE.
By JOHN ADDISON.
(Read at Maryport.) 
In preparing the following paper, I soon observed that a mere 
history of the old Maryport Furnace would be so short, and 
possibly of so little interest, except to those connected directly or 
indirectly with the smelting of iron, that it would be well, in order 
to interest the members generally, to give some particulars of the 
development and progress of the Iron Manufacture from ancient 
times up to the year 1752, when the old furnace was commenced.
Also to call attention to the marvellous progress made in the art 
since 1783, when that furnace stopped working for want of the 
constant and uniform power which the steam engine has subse- 
quently supplied, and which is necessary for maintaining a steady 
and unfailing blast ; for the lack also of that extended scientific 
knowledge then so greatly needed, but which has since been 
brought to bear with such successful results on the construction 
of furnaces of suitable size and form for the work required of them : 
progress made by the application of Chemistry to the analysis 
of the ore, limestone, and fuel, fixing and regulating from time to 
time the relative proportions, so as to secure the most economical 
results.
228 
Referring to the existence of Iron in Nature, I may observe 
that it has been discovered in the distant heavens ; the sun and 
certain stars contain it ; the sun being surrounded by a solar 
atmosphere estimated at from 500 to 1000 miles in depth, which 
spectroscopic analysis has proved to contain iron in addition to 
twenty-one other metals.
It is known also to exist in the blood 
which circulates in the body of man, giving health and vigour to 
his energies.
The fall of meteoric iron is much more frequent than is 
generally believed.
Hardly a year passes without some instances 
occurring.
On the morning of 12th November, 1799, thousands 
of shooting stars, mingled with large meteors, illuminated the 
heavens for many hours over the whole continent of America.
From Brazil to Labrador, the display extended to Greenland and 
even Germany.
During many hours on the morning of the 13th 
November, 1832, prodigious multitudes of shooting stars and 
meteors fell at Mocha, on the Red Sea, in the Atlantic, in Switzer- 
land, and at many places in England.
But by far the most splendid meteoric shower on record 
occurred in November, 1833, lasting for ten hours.
It extended 
from Majara and the northern lakes of America to the south of 
Jamaica, and from 61° of longitude in the Atlantic to 100^ of 
longitude in Central Mexico.
Shooting stars and meteors of the 
apparent size of Jupiter, Venus, and even of the Moon, darted in 
myriads towards the horizon as if every star in the heavens had 
started from its sphere.
The Emperor Jehangire had a sword forged from a mass of 
meteoric iron which fell in 1620 at Jahlinder, in the Punjab.
Sixteen instances of the fall of meteoric stones in the British 
Isles are well authenticated.
Four instances have been recorded 
of persons being killed by falling meteors.
Iron in its native form is chiefly found in meteoric stones ; 
doubtless from these the earliest implements of iron were forged.
I must not omit to refer to the remarkable discovery of altars 
by Mr. H.
P. Senhouse, near to the Roman Camp at Maryport, 
2,2d 
in the summer of 1870, and which had been buried there since 
the year 120, or about 1750 years, one of which claims special 
attention in this paper.
It was dedicated to Vulcan by Helstrius 
Novellus, who commanded the first cohort of Spaniards — 
Helstrius Novellus Prsefectus Numini Volcani Solvit.
Helstrius 
Novellus the prefect (erects this altar in discharge of a vow) to the 
deity Vulcan.
"For the first time in Britain," says Dr. Bruce, "we meet 
with a dedication to the blacksmith's god, Vulcan." Can we 
admit this altar as evidence that the Romans worked iron at or 
near our Roman Camp?
Following out this idea, I may add 
that Vulcan had a son called Olenus.
The name given by the 
Romans to their Camp at Maryport was Olenacum.
Was the 
Camp called after the river Alne, or the Alne after the son of 
Vulcan?
Though wishful to maintain the honour of the god 
of iron-workers, I will not press the solution of this query, but call 
attention to it as a curious coincidence.
Vulcan, I must tell the uninitiated, was the patron god of 
all artists who worked in iron and metals.
The most ancient 
festival in honour of Vulcan seems to have been the Furnaria, 
Vulcan being the god of furnaces.
His forges were supposed to 
be under Mount Etna, in the Island of Sicily, as well as in every 
part of the earth where there were volcanoes.
How puny is 
the conception of our largest furnaces compared with those of 
the brawny forgers of Jupiter's thunder-bolts !
With our present knowledge of meteors, we can understand 
the ancients conceiving fiery missiles descending on to the earth 
to be the same that their god Vulcan had discharged from 
volcanoes into the heavens.
These celestial visitors, however, 
numerous as they were, would have been totally inadequate to 
meet the present requirements of man.
Fortunately for us, iron 
ores, widely distributed, and unlimited in quantity, are embedded 
in the earth.
In many coal-fields the occurrence of rich beds of iron ore in 
230 
the strata of shale that alternate with the beds of coal, has 
rendered the adjacent districts in our day remarkable as the site 
of most important ironworks, while the limestone necessary for 
a flux frequently occurs at no great distance.
But what interests us more particularly in this county, is that 
remarkable deposit called Red Hematite, found in such abundance 
in the Cleator and Ulverstone districts.
This rich deposit con- 
tains from sixty to seventy per cent, of iron by weight.
Of several 
varieties, two may be referred to.
The first of these is Specular 
Iron, of bright metallic lustre ; it occurs in large and beautiful 
crystalline masses in the Island of Elba, where it has been worked 
for 2000 years.
It is likewise found in many other parts of the 
world.
The other variety is Kidney Ore, the origin of which is still 
a curious problem, as its deposits occur sometimes in apparently 
regular beds.
Its characteristic form is in large kidney-shaped 
nodules, with a fine radiated structure, a shape, however, only 
assumed in the cavities of massive deposits.
This Peroxide of Iron occurs in the Cleator district along the 
lines of great faults and in caverns in the limestone, fifteen, thirty, 
and even one hundred and sixty feet in thickness, while at Ulver- 
stone it is deposited as if in pools or lakes formed in the underlying 
rock.
I will now refer to the early history of iron as one of the useful 
arts.
Sir C.
Lyell, in his "Antiquity of Man," says, "It is difficult 
to obtain any positive dates, even for the more recent transition 
between the Iron and Bronze ages.
We find, however, that 
Hesiod, writing about 850 years B.C., speaks of a time when 
Bronze had not been superseded by Iron ; and Homer mentions 
Iron but rarely, while he makes frequent reference to weapons and 
implements of Bronze." 
Most opportunely has Dr. Schliemann, the celebrated ex- 
plorer of the Ruins of Troy, furnished very interesting information 
on this point.
The following is an extract from The Titnes of 
November, 1878, containing an extract from his speech on the 
subject : — " By far the most interesting object he ever found in his 
231 
excavations at Troy is, he considers, a dagger of steel four inches 
long.
The blade, which is double-edged and in the form of an 
arrow, is in a perfect state of preservation, which Dr. Schliemann 
attributes to the antiseptic power of the red wood ashes mixed with 
charcoal in which he found it embedded, in the large mansion 
close to the gate, twenty-eight feet below Il)e surface.
He says: — 
* This is the first object of iron found by me here, nay, until now I 
had found no trace of iron in any one of the four prehistoric cities 
the ruins and debris of which succeed each other here, neither had 
I found a trace of that metal at Mycen?e.
Homer freely mentions 
iron, to which he applies three times (II.
vi., 48; x., 379; xi., 133) 
the epithet poiu/nelos, that is to say a metal obtained with much 
labour, and, as Mr. Gladstone observed in his preface to my 
MycencB ' : — ' The poet always mentions it as a rare and valuable 
substance used where great hardness was required, and for objects 
comparatively small and portable ; except, indeed, in the case of 
the gates of Tartaros (II.
viii., 15), where he could dispose of as 
much material as he pleased.
The aggregate quantity then was 
small ; and the instruments were likely to be carried away on the 
abandonment or destruction of a city.
Its absence may, therefore, 
be accounted for, in part by its value, but also, and more especially, 
because it so readily corrodes.' ' For all the rest I perfectly agree 
with Mr. Gladstone, but I certainly do not accept his opinion that 
iron embedded in ancient debris can possibly corrode and disappear 
without leaving a trace of its existence.
But if iron was so rare 
and precious at the time of Homer, how much rarer and more 
precious must it then not have been at the time of Ilium's catas- 
trophe, which appears, by the objects of human industry I find 
here, to have preceded the poet by a long number of centuries?
The Greek word for iron (sideros) can leave no doubt that the 
first iron which was used was meteoric iron, and, as Mr. Birch, of 
the British Museum, assures me, this is confirmed by the ancient 
Egyptian name for that metal.' " 
Mushet tells us that, "The discovery of iron in terrestrial ore 
was probably first made during the conversion of wood into char- 
coal, used by the ancients for domestic purposes, through portions 
232 
of ore getting mixed with it ; in the course of ages by laborious 
perseverance it would be discovered that, not only high temperature 
was necessary, but that ore thus heated should not be directly 
exposed to the action of that air which was the source of temper- 
ature." 
This would lead to the practice of keeping the ore surrounded 
as much as possible with fuel, while the process of conversion was 
going forward ; hence would arise the first attempt at a furnace.
In time, after the construction of furnaces had developed to a 
condition of comparative efficiency, bellows, which might have 
been previously used for forging iron only, might be applied to its 
manufacture, these gradually developing to the powerful blowing 
machines of the present day.
I fear there does not now exist a clue by which the rise and 
progress of this art can, with certainty, be traced ; an art which has 
given man the mastery over all other metals and minerals, and 
has conferred on him the unrivalled dominion of the universe.
Greatly delighted must the early worker in iron have been, 
when, through patience and perseverance, he acquired reliable 
rules of process by which he could obtain uniform results, and 
discovered the powerful effects of air directed on the burning fuel in 
raising the temperature, resulting in the earliest form of furnace.
Though we cannot precisely say what was the peculiar 
form of the iron furnaces, or air bloomeries, of the Greeks 
and Romans, yet we may form some idea from what is now 
practised by other nations in the infancy of the art.
In the 
interior of Africa, a low conical furnace is used, which seems 
an easy and natural structure for a rude age.
Small 
openings at the lower end of the cone to admit the air, and 
a larger orifice at the top, would, with charcoal, be sufficient 
to give a considerable degree of heat.
The furnace would, in the 
first instance, be filled with layers of charcoal and iron ore 
alternately, and the fire applied to the openings in the lower 
extremity of the furnace; the heat might be regulated by narrowing 
or increasing those apertures, and a renewal of the fuel, when 
necessary, be easily effected by the funnel at the top.
233 
In other countries, furnaces of varying size and structure 
have been devised, but acknowledge the same principle as those 
now used on the burning sands of Africa.
The invention of bellows, and their eventual application to 
the air bloomery, gave rise to the blast bloomery, and occasioned 
a great revolution and improvement in the fabrication of iron, 
tending materially to increase the produce and to improve the 
quality.
In time, foot-blasts and hand-blasts, or bellows would be 
abandoned ; oxen would cease to be used, and a more effectual 
moving power, found on the banks of adjacent streams.
Water- 
wheels, giving motion to large bellows and hammers, would 
succeed the crude and infantile efforts of a ruder age j so long as 
there was water in the brook, the operation of blowing continued ; 
when this supply ceased, smelting was at an end for the season, 
and the labourers dispersed, some to the mines, others to the 
woods, to prepare materials for another blast.
A decided advantage was obtained by increasing the size of the 
furnace — it is probable that this enlargement would be pushed to 
the extreme long before any adequate improvement took place in 
the blowing machine.
The soft and limited quantity of the blast 
would be found insufficient to penetrate the column of iron-making 
materials after the furnace had been made three or four times the 
height of the old blast bloomery.
The combustion becoming languid, the furnace was narrowed 
towards the bottom, in order that the materials might be held in 
partial suspension, — this suspending medium being then and since 
called the "bosh." 
The charcoal blast furnace of the present age attained a 
height of thirty feet, the diameter enlarged to eight or nine feet at 
the boshes, and the whole capacity equal in some instances to 
nine hundred or one thousand cubical feet.
The first successful 
experiments for making pig iron from coke, were, of course, per- 
formed in the pre-existing charcoal furnace of this size.
The employment of coke rendered it necessary, in order to 
effect economy in the production of iron, to increase the furnaces 
234 
in capacity to two, three, four, five, and six thousand cubic feet.
In later years these were followed by furnaces equal to ten 
thousand cubic feet without the maximum effect even then 
being obtained.
The oldest casting met with by Mr. Mushet in Dean Forest 
is dated 1620.
The first iron guns cast in England were in 
1547) t>y a person in London of the name of Owen, who, in 
1535, had succeeded for the first time in making guns from brass 
or bronze.
The opinion that the blast furnace for the production of cast 
or pig iron was an English invention has received corroboration 
from various circumstances.
The fact of Owen casting iron guns in 1547, would indicate a 
knowledge of the re-melting of iron, and is a considerable confir- 
mation of the previous existence of the blast furnace, and of its 
productions in the shape of castings of various sorts, a great variety 
of which would most likely be first fabricated before commencing 
upon pieces of ordnance.
It is fair also to presume that pig iron 
would be well known, and applied for the purpose of making bar 
iron, long before it became a staple article in the manipulations of 
the foundry.
Mr. Hill, of the Plymouth Iron Works, gave to Mr. Mushet 
a perfect casting, on which are inscribed the Arms of England, 
with the initials E.R., bearing date 1553, — being the last year of 
the reign of Edward the Sixth.
We have now come down to that, to us, interesting period of 
iron manufacture, extending from the year 1752 to 1783, when the 
old furnace at Maryport was built and worked as a commercial 
speculation.
All honor to the names of those who entered on the 
enterprise, sanguine, no doubt, of great results, but doomed 
eventually to disappointment ; all honour also to the man who had 
intelligence to read the future, and also the liberality to afford them 
on very reasonable terms the necessary land, buildings, and other 
facilities for starting their venture.
Viewing, as we now do, the 
great iron industries established at Maryport of late years, one 
cannot fail to be impressed with the apparent prescience of the 
235 
Mr. Humphrey Senhouse of that day,* revived in and emulated by 
his family a century afterwards, as evinced by the establishment of 
extensive iron-works of late years.
I have been kindly allowed to examine the documents at 
Nether Hall, bearing on the history of the old furnace, namely : — 
A lease granted in 1752 by Humphrey Senhouse, Esq., of 
Netherhall, to — James Postlethwaite, of Cartmel ; William Lewth- 
waite, of Kirkby Hall; William Postlethwaite, of Kirk by; Thomas 
Hartley, of Whitehaven ; John Gale, of Whitehaven ; Edward 
Tubman, of Whitehaven ; Edmund Gibson, of Whitehaven ; of 
buildings, quarries, and land, on which to erect furnaces and 
forges, with power to deepen the river Ellen between the works 
and the harbour, for a term of fifty years, at the yearly rent of 
£^2 I OS.
od.
In a letter from Mr. John Smith to Mr. Senhouse, dated May, 
1787, reference is made to the deficiency of water for working the 
blast in certain seasons.
In^a letter dated November, 1783, from Mr. John Barnes to 
Mr. Senhouse, reference is made to the desire of the Furnace Co.
to sell him the lease, on accoimt of the embarrassed state of the 
concern.
In the following January, Mr. Senhouse agreed to 
* Epitaph in Marypcrt Chicrch.
Humphrey Senhouse, 
Of Nether Hall, Esquire, 
Died July 12th, 1770, 
Aged 65.
It is needless to record 
on a perishable Tablet 
The many eminent virtues 
which adorned his character.
The Town of Maryport, 
Founded and Flourishing 
Through his auspicious patronage, 
May haply prove 
Till time shall be no more 
A striking monument 
in honor of his memory.
236 
purchase the lease, together with all the machinery and other 
materials, for ^600.
In the inventory of the property and materials, the following 
particulars are given : — " The buildings belonging to the 
furnace are very extensive, large, and convenient, being 
three large coal houses, which will contain charcoal or coke 
sufficient for a year's blast; three commodious houses for the 
storing of iron ores ; three dwelling houses for workmen ; a 
large and convenient casting house, with a very good furnace, 
both adjoining to the blast furnace, by which the foundry 
branch may be carried on to the greatest extent ; seven- 
teen ovens for charring coals, built on an improved plan, and 
which make a cinder superior to any other method ; and a neat 
well-built dwelling house, most agreeably situated, and very 
convenient for the works." 
The old Maryport furnace, when erected, would be considered 
a large and costly structure, — the pride of its owners ; now its 
venerable features and dilapidated pyramidal form look down on 
us as from a past generation, usefully encouraging us by the 
evidence of its past efforts, and warning us to avoid its defects.
The base of the furnace measures, outside, thirty feet square ; 
the height, thirty six-feet; to the top of the chimney portion, seven 
feet more.
The present inside diameter of the bottom is eight 
feet; at seven feet above the bottom, the diameter at the bosh is 
twelve feet six inches.
It is built of solid masonry of red sand- 
stone, lined with brick.
The defective principle on which it was built (square instead 
of round) is shewn by the large cracks at the side, caused by the 
destructive action of heating and cooling, which could not be 
uniform in such a structure.
The papers I have just referred to, afford evidence that 
the working of the furnace was occasionally stopped for want 
of water to turn the wheel which worked the blast cylinders.
This uncertain supply of water in summer would be a constant 
source of anxiety to the o^vners, from which future iron masters 
were relieved by the invention of the steam engine.
Indeed, I am 
237 
inclined to believe that the ultimate failure of the enterprise was 
occasioned by the uncertainty of the water supply, as may be 
inferred from the Netherhall documents.
Nevertheless, at one time the furnace appears to have been 
worked with some degree of success ; for it is stated in the History 
and Antiquities of Cumberland, by Joseph Nicolson and Richard 
Burn, published 1777, page 162, "They have a furnace for casting 
iron-ware, which carries on a considerable trade." 
The coke was no doubt made in the adjacent ovens from coal 
raised at the neighbouring colleries, at "The Gill" and "Senhouse 
Moor," in the vicinity of Mr. Boyd's new house.
I have discovered no evidence of the smelting being effected 
with charcoal.
In the agreement of January, 1784, it is stated that there 
was at the works iron ore from Whitrigg, Crossgates, Inmangill, 
and Whitehaven.
I have heard it stated that ore was carried to the 
works on ponies' backs ; this, however, is doubtful.
I believe that 
the principal part was brought in small craft by sea, and taken at 
flood-tide up the river and discharged close to the works, and that, 
by similar means, iron was shipped to coast towns, and probably to 
Ireland.
My venerable neighbour.
Captain Benn, informed me lately 
that the grandfather of his son-in-law, Robert Brown, brought iron 
stone from Palnackie (Water of Urr), Kirkcudbrightshire, in a very 
little vessel, which went up the Ellen close to the works to 
discharge.
About fifteen years ago, I called the attention of the late Mr.
Senhouse to an old pig of iron which I observed to be fixed as the 
sill of an opening into the old furnace yard.
Shortly afterwards 
it was removed to Netherhall.
On the pig were cast the letters 
H.S., 1769.
The iron which had set in the furnace bottom when 
the works were stopped, lies like a huge meteor at the angle of 
the wall near to the Furnace Mill.
The ground near the furnace 
contains a quantity of slag.
Mr. Barwise (Clerk of the Trustee Board), informs me that 
his father, who rented from Mr. Senhouse the adjoining field, knew 
238 
an old sailor who, for some time, converted one of the old coke 
ovens into a dwelling.
The boys of a later date occupied them 
on hoHdays as play-houses in stormy weather.
I am told that seventy years ago, coke was made at the ovens 
for the purpose of drying damaged corn, previous to its being 
ground at the adjacent mill.
Since 1783 immense progress has been made in all that 
appertains to the smelting and manufacture of iron.
Now furnaces 
are built circular of comparatively thin brick work, and surrounded 
entirely by strong iron plates; the inner lining being of refractory 
fire brick, separated from the outer portion of the wall by a narrow 
space filled with sand.
Recent ones have been built as high as 
from eighty to one hundred feet.
A bell or cone is used for closing the mouth of the furnace, so 
as to save the "waste gases;" these are conveyed by pipes from 
openings just under the cone, and are used to raise steam and heat 
the blast, which afterwards passes to the blast pipe surrounding 
the hearth with its tuyere branches.
In the period embracing 1750, blast furnaces produced on an 
average three hundred tons of pig iron annually, while the largest 
constructed of late years yields 24,000 tons in the same time ; in 
fact, the produce of a single modern furnace is equal to nearly one 
and a half times the crude iron made in this country one hundred 
and twenty years ago.
The cubic contents of the furnace of 1854 were 5,079 cubic 
feet; that of 1863, 16,000 cubic feet; and 1870, 30,000 cubic 
feet.
The cost of two furnaces of the last description was 
In the year 1827, a height of furnace of fifty feet, and a 
capacity of from 4,000 to 6,000 cubic feet, fulfilled all the require- 
ments deemed necessary by the iron smelters.
About the year in question, a manager of Gas Works, Mr. J.
B. Neilson, of Glasgow, conceived the idea that, by heating the 
air before it entered the blast furnace, an increased intensity of 
temperature would ensue.
The conception formed the subject 
of a patent, since so extensively known as the "Hot Blast," 
239 
and which, at the period of its introduction, constituted one of 
the most remarkable events in the history of the iron trade.
It is now, however, asserted by some manufacturers, that 
experience has proved that Neilson's invention mainly served to 
remedy a defect in furnaces of his time, viz : — want of capacity, 
which defect, when removed, was as efficacious in saving fuel as 
the hot blast itself, i.e. a ton of iron, with cold blast, could be made 
in a furnace seventy one feet high, with as small a consumption 
of fuel as was required when hot blast was applied to a furnace 
fifty-three feet in height, — in each case identically the same materials 
being used.
The "fifty-three feet" hot blast furnace has been proved 
to turn out a larger make of iron than that blown with cold air 
(probably two hundred tons per week, against one hundred and 
twenty tons) ; but on the other hand, the larger furnace, without 
any apparatus to maintain, or fuel to expend for heating the air, 
is able to do its work as efficiently in point of fuel consumed in 
the furnace as the other, assisted by the more complicated 
appendage suggested by Neilson.
This problem of the most economical and effective mode of 
constructing and working blast furnaces, is one on which opinions 
still vary, but the importance of it may be shewn by the following 
figures given by Mr. Lowthian Bell : — 
Furnace of Cubic feet - 6,000 12,000 16,000 26,000 41,000.
Weekly make, tons - 220 260 350 400 550.
Weekly make per 1,000 c.
ft.
37 23 22 16 13.
The effect of a large furnace of 41,000 cubic feet producing 
less in proportion than one of 16,000 cubic feet, is that the charge 
for interest on outlay is about one hundred to sixty-six in favor of 
the latter, but if including more expensive engines, heating stoves, 
etc., the proportion would be one hundred to ninety-two.
In addition to what has just been stated, it must also be borne 
in mind that the phenomena connected with the operations of the 
blast furnace are liable to be affected by so many disturbing 
causes, namely, quality of fuel, of limestone, and of iron ore, 
efficiency of the heating apparatus, the size of the tuyeres, and the 
240 
heat and intensity of the blast, that much caution is required in 
arriving at any fixed opinion on the nature of a process so com- 
plicated as that of iron smelting.
I may here observe that the cubic capacity of the old Maryport 
furnace is about 2700 feet, and of the furnaces erected of late 
years at Maryport by the Solvvay Iron Co., 13,000 cubic feet.
Estimating the produce of the old furnace at 500 tons per 
annum, and of each of the Solway Co.'s furnaces at only 500 tons 
per week, or 26,000 tons per annum, and applying that figure to 
the ten furnaces at Maryport, we may estimate the whole of the 
present furnaces as capable of producing 260,000 tons of pig iron 
per annum, or 520 times more than the old furnace — a quantity 
which if converted into a continuous length of ordinary railway 
bars would reach from Maryport to the centre of the earth.
I will now give some information relative to the quantity of 
pig iron produced in the country during the period that the old 
furnace was in operation, compared with the produce of subsequent 
years, kindly sent to me by Mr. R.
Hunt, F.R.S., Keeper of the 
Mining Records at the Museum of Practical Geology.
The quantity of pig iron made in England and Wales and 
Scotland in the following years, will serve to show the progress 
which has been made between 1740 and 1854, the first year in 
which statistics were collected by the Mining Record Ofifice, and 
the year 1876 : —

In 1854 the produce of Pig Iron in Cumberland and Lancashire 
was 20,000 tons; in 1876 it had risen to 989,871 tons.
The reason we have been able to spin, weave, and manufacture 
all staple articles of commerce cheaper and better than any other 
country, is mainly owing to our abundant supply of coal, and the 
cheapness and low cost at which we produce pig iron.
In no other article of manufacture is quality of such vital and 
universal importance as that of iron ; furnishing as it does the 
artillery and small arms of our Army and Navy, steam boilers, 
girder bridges, columns, beams, roofs, chains, etc., and entering 
more or less extensively into the construction of everything upon 
which life is dependent for safety.
The best pig iron is chiefly 
made from the best iron ore and iron stone ; and the best and 
purest iron ore in Great Britain is found in the Cleator and Furness 
districts.
It is now well understood that the use of these Hematite 
ores, mixed with other ores, impart greater strength, greater power 
of resistance to sudden shocks or strains, and will produce more 
dense, solid, and sound metal than any other ore of iron.
Their 
purity and easy fusibility render them especially advantageous in 
furnaces where more refractory and less pure mineral is used.
Hematite pig iron has a special value as being suited to the manu- 
facture of Bessemer steel, which material has effected a revolution, 
or has caused a bound in the progress of engineering science as great 
almost as that caused by the supersession of timber by malleable 
iron in the construction of many works.
Steam boilers are being 
made of steel.
Ships are being built of steel, as they cause less 
displacement than ships built of iron, steel being especially 
valuable in the case of river craft in tropical countries.
Bessemer 
steel rails are being adopted almost invariably by Railway Com- 
panies, adding to the safety and comfort of travellers, and to the 
economy of maintaining the permanent way.
A very grand work is about to be constmcted across the Forth 
by Mr. Thomas Bouch, the eminent engineer (a Thursby man).
This 
work, an enormous viaduct, is of such dimensions that the weight and 
relative strength of the material employed, are important elements 
17 
242 
for consideration.
The spans of the girders being so large, and 
steel being so much stronger in proportion to its weight than iron, 
the former material has been selected; the confidence of the 
engineer in the success of his undertaking being thereby confirmed.
One of the most interesting associations connected with the 
history of the old Maryport furnace is the fact that the period during 
which it was in operation was made resplendent by the genius of the 
great men who were then directing' their energies to the advance- 
ment of Science and Practical Mechanics bearing on the develop- 
ment of manufactures.
In the front rank stood James Watt, aided 
and encouraged by Drs. Black, Priestly, Dalton, and Darwin.
Truly may we say in the words of Watt's epitaph — "They enlarged 
the resources of their country, and increased the power of man."

THE DRAMA AND DRAMATISTS.
By E.
FLETCHER.
(Read at Whitehaven.
) 
The subject of the Drama and Dramatists is a vast and 
comprehensive one, embracing as it does the whole of the British 
drama from its earUest stage to the present time.
Midst the gloom 
and darkness that prevailed in the earlier centuries of our history, 
little is known concerning those poets who first took pen in hand to 
frame the English drama.
In England the Miracle Play, or Mystery, acted in churches 
and convents, either by the clergy themselves, or by their direction, 
was the earliest form of the English drama.
The only knowledge 
of Bible history possessed by the rude and ignorant masses of the 
people during the latter centuries of the Middle Ages was got from 
these plays.
The subjects chosen were such as the Creation, the 
Fall, the Deluge, the Crucifixion, — and were dramatized with little 
regard to the sacred and awful nature of the themes.
Profane 
and terrible were these mistaken teachings.
Three platforms, one 
above another, formed a triple stage ; the topmost represented the 
Heaven of Heavens, and was occupied by a group of actors who 
personated the Almighty and His angels ; below stood those who 
played the parts of the redeemed \ upon the lowest platform which 
imitated the world, the deeds of men were represented, and not far 
244 
from the side of the lowest station, there smoked a fiery furnace, 
which stood for Hell.
The comic element was not forgotten, and 
of all beings, who should the priests of the church choose to be 
the first comedian but the Prince of Darkness ; he it was who, 
according to the vulgar notion, equipped with horns and tail, 
created the fun which kept the yokels m laughter and good temper.
It is not known when these plays commenced, but from the year 
1268 to 1577, Miracle Plays were acted in Chester and other large 
towns and cities throughout the country.
Gradually the Miracle Plays changed into the Moralities, 
which form the second stage in the development of the English 
drama.
Here, instead of Scripture characters, we find sentiment 
and abstract ideas, such as Mercy, Justice, and Truth, first 
introduced, which led to the composition of an improved drama.
It was about the year 1540, during the reign of Henry VIII., that 
acting became a distinct profession ; both Miracle and Moral plays 
having previously been represented by clergymen, school-boys, or 
by some members of a corporate body, and only brought forward 
at the time of some great festivity.
As the introduction of allegorical characters had been an 
improvement upon the Scriptural plays, so was the introduction of 
historical characters an improvement upon the former.
While 
speaking of the Mystery plays, few people would imagine that we 
owe the origin of the street entertainment of Punch and Judy 
(before which almost every man, woman, or child has stopped to 
laugh away an idle half hour), to the remains of an old Mystery 
play, upon the trial of our Saviour.
Punch is so called from the 
name of the Roman Governor, Pontius Pilate, and Judy is a 
corruption from Judas Iscariot, the traitor apostle who sacrificed 
the life of our great Redeemer.
It was soon found that a real human being with a human 
name, was better calculated to waken the sympathies of an 
audience.
The substitution of these instead of symbolical char- 
2i5 
acters, took place during the earlier part of the i6th century; and 
with this, aided by the Greek dramatic literature, which now began 
to be studied, the genuine English drama took its rise.
"Ralph Doyster Doyster, a dramatic picture of London Life," 
written by Nicholas Udall, master of Westminster school about the 
year 1550 is, as far as is known, the first English comedy.
Next 
comes " Gammer Goirton's Needle," a comedy written by John Still, 
bishop of Bath and Wells, a humourous but somewhat coarse writer 
of that period.
It is to be observed that both these plays were 
written by clergymen.
As specimens of something between the 
Moral plays and the then modern drama, the interludes of John 
Heywood may be mentioned.
He was a wit and musician at the 
court of King Henry VHI.
Heywood's dramatic compositions 
embraced all the fun of the broadest farce, coupled with no small 
amount of skill and talent.
One of these productions called "The 
four P.'s," turns upon a dispute between a Palmer, a Pedlar, a 
Pardoner, and a Poticary, as to who shall tell the grossest false- 
hood, when the Palmer incidentally states he never saw a woman 
out of patience in his life, which takes the rest off their guard, and 
they immediately yield him the palm.
The regular drama from the first was divided into two parts.
Comedy and Tragedy.
Tragedy is of later origin than Comedy, 
being taken from the elevated portions of the Moral plays, and 
from the pure models of Greece and Rome.
The earliest 
known tragedy is that of "Ferrex and Porrex," composed by 
Thomas Sackville, Earl of Dorset, and it was played before Queen 
Elizabeth by the students of the Inner Temple in January, 1561.
By a sudden and enormous stride the English drama reached 
the magnificent creations of Shakespere in a few years after the 
productions of its earliest perfect specimens.
Not half a century 
after John Heywood amused the court of King Henry VIIL, 
Queen Elizabeth and her Maids of Honour assembled to witness the 
misfortunes of old John Falstaff, or to admire the greatest tragedies 
246 
the world has ever seen.
It might be mentioned, that as all the 
dramas were written to be acted before Queen Elizabeth, it is not 
to be wondered at that many compliments were put into the mouths 
of the actors to please the dictatorial and somewhat vain queen.
There were several dramatists before the advent of Shakespere, 
of more or less note; and in almost every instance these men 
possessed a classical education.
George Peek, John Lyly, Robert 
Greewe, had studied at the Universities, and evidently had imbibed 
their love for dramatic composition from the Greek and Latin 
poets.
Christopher Marlowe, a fiery and imaginative spirit, who 
appeared a little before the time of Shakespeare, wrote " The Jew 
of Malta," "Edward the Second," and other plays, but was doomed 
to pale in brightness before the greatest master of the age, William 
Shakespere.
The writings of Marlowe had evidently prepared the way for 
Shakespere.
They had adorned the stage with more variety of 
character and action, with deeper passion and with truer poetry 
than had been known before.
Above all, they had familiarized 
the public ear to the use of blank verse.
The last improvement 
was the greatest, for even Shakespere would have been fettered if 
he had been compelled to write in rhyme.
The Elizabethan age was a glorious one for the drama.
Shakespere, Ben Jonson, Christopher Marlowe, Beaumont and 
Fletcher, burst upon the world with their mighty Hnes.
It was the 
age of chivalry, of honour, and romance, and as such was reflected 
in the writings of the dramatist.
The stage has ever been the 
reflex of the hour : so we have left to us in the comedies of Shake- 
spere and Jonson, the quaint conceits and peculiar humours which 
inhabited the brains and formed the manners of the courtiers of 
those days.
We see that till the advent of Shakespeare there was 
scarcely any drama in England.
It was he who took the ancient 
stories of the time, and with wit, fire, grace, and imagery, gave life 
247 
and being to the English drama.
It is my intention to illustrate 
by some short passages from the different dramatists, each separate 
era in the history of the stage.
[The author read Shakespere's 
comparison of the world to a stage.
As you like it, — Act 2 
scene vii.] 
Ben Jonson generally has assigned to him the second place 
in dramatic literature, although many writers advocate the more 
Shakesperian style of Beaumont and Fletcher.
Like Shakespeare, 
Jonson was an actor, and therefore naturally understood better the 
requirements most needed in building up a play.
Ben Jonson is 
more famed for comedy than tragedy.
[As a specimen of his 
quaint humour and conceit, the author read a short extract from 
"Every Man in his Humour," where one Bobadil, a braggadocia 
fellow, tells you his plan how to save the expense of an army.] 
The chief fault of the comedies of the Elizabethan age is their 
coarseness, but that was the habit of the time ; and when we reflect 
that the beautiful creations of Portia, Imogene, Juliet, and Rosalind, 
were not acted by females, but by young men and boys, it may go 
some little way to palliate their grossness.
Up to this time the authors of each drama had to beg, cap in 
hand, permission from some noble lord or patron of the drama, to 
dedicate their plays to him ; and the recompense each generally 
received was a gratuity doled out according to the fulsome adulation 
addressed in the dedication.
Poets and dramatists at all times 
have been unfortunate, and even the mighty Shakespere, 
although his dramas were always accepted and found favour in his 
day, became rich and opulent, not by his works, or by his acting 
(for he was but a third rate performer), but by his share in the 
proprietorship of the Globe theatre, which was a profitable concern, 
and placed him and his fellows above the reach of want.
In 
Shakespere's time many of his brother actors wielded the dramatic 
pen, but all their works were eclipsed by his more magic hand.
Following Queen Elizabeth, the reign of James I.
produced 
248 
only one famous dramatist, Philip Massinger, an unfortunate 
author, whose days were spent in obscurity and poverty.
He 
wrote the play of "A New Way to Pay Old Debts." The 
principal character.
Sir Giles Overreach, being a satire upon a 
famous Judge of the Star Chamber, one Sir George Mompesson, 
an old and griping usurer.
This dramatist was singularly gifted, 
and wrote with ^ delicacy, force, and expression.
He died in 
London, and was buried at Covent Garden, where a stone, for 
more than a century, recorded that here lies Philip Massinger, " a 
stranger." John Ford was another writer of this age, as was 
Thomas Heyvvood, who wrote upwards of two hundred plays, very 
few of which have remained to the present day.
Speaking of the 
men and boys who represented the female characters, it is some- 
what amusing to us who have so many talented ladies to represent 
the beautiful creations of the dramatist, to find that, in the time of 
Charles I., the curtain could not be allowed to rise because Juliet 
had not shaved, or Portia had to remove a heavy beard.
The old 
dramatists, too, had other things to fight against than men playing 
women's parts, — the theatres were generally platforms run up in 
Inn yards, where the galleries around formed the boxes and dress 
circle.
In Gloucester and Worcester, several old-fashioned Inns 
are still remaining, where tradition states that Shakespere had 
played his part.
In London the first licensed theatre, the Black- 
friars, was not erected till 1576, and then the stage portion alone 
was covered, leaving the audience part exposed to the rain and 
cold.
It must have been a hard thing for the dramatist in those days 
to have seen his plays acted for the first time — it being customary 
for the gay gallants to sit upon the stage (which was then strewn 
with rushes), during the performance, and join in freely with the 
actor commenting upon the ability or weakness of the conception 
of the author.
The want, of scenery and other adjuncts must have militated 
249 
severely against the success of a play.
Shakespere, in his comedy, 
of "A Midsummer Night's Dream," explains the scanty shifts the 
performers had to make in those days — by the peculiar devices of 
Bottom the Weaver and his Athenian associates in their perform- 
ance before Duke Theseus at Athens.
The sum paid for a play 
at this time was from ;^io to ^^20 — a slight difference from the 
present time, when Bouccicault, for a cleverly constructed Irish 
drama, devoid of all literary merit, makes his thousands of pounds !
and Byron, the author of " Our Boys," will not, it is asserted, put 
pen to paper for a new comedy under ;^3oo, which must be paid 
for whether bad or good, successful or otherwise.
The courts of James I.
and Charles I.
were enlivened by a 
peculiar theatrical entertainment, called a Masque, which has 
derived particular interest from the genius of Ben Jonson and John 
Milton.
The origin of the Masque is looked for in the revels and 
shows which, during the 14th and 15 th centuries, were presented 
at court and at the Universities.
Masques were generally prepared 
for some remarkable event, such as a coronation or a marriage, and 
frequently acted by the highest nobles in the land.
After the 
death of James I., the Civil War between Charles and his Parlia- 
ment broke up the theatres, so that the pen of the dramatist lay 
idle.
It was but natural to suppose that the actors, who were 
sunned by the bounty and graced by the smiles of royalty, should 
lean to the side of the Cavaliers.
They mostly became Royalist 
soldiers, and played out their parts upon the battle fields of 
England.
During the Commonwealth, all theatres were closed ; 
the grim and sober Puritan erring as much on the one side as the 
gay and spendthrift Cavaliers upon the other.
That the drama 
should be an eyesore to the Puritans was a matter of course, as it 
was then reflecting back the vices of the Court.
But with the 
rejection of the drama, in the mind of the Puritan every simple 
game, sport, or pastime was a sin, even to the bringing in of a 
250 
boar's head at a feast, or to a dance on the village green.
Still 
the love of the drama lay deeply imbedded in the hearts of the 
English people.
John Milton, poet and Puritan as he was, writes 
most heartily of his admiration for the stage.
England then passed through a fiery furnace only to find in 
the accession of Charles II.
more licentiousness and more 
immorality than has ever disgraced the pages of our history.
The 
Court at Whitehall gave the tone to English society ; and dramas 
generally are but the reflections of what society thinks and does.
The vices of the Court were mirrored by the poets and dramatists 
of that day, who manufactured grossness and immorality for the 
wicked men and women who thronged around an idle and 
dissolute king.
The plays of the poet Dryden are nearly all tainted with the 
poisonous atmosphere of the time, while those of Wycherly are the 
most diseased specimens which remain to the present day.
It is 
to be regretted that many dramatists courted fame, — not by the 
midnight lamp in the student's cell, but in the festivities of the 
great Metropolis, sharpening their wits against superior brains, and, 
if unsuccessful, falling one by one into a wasted life.
It must be 
remembered that every poet more or less tries to write a play.
It 
has ever been a favourite style of composition.
The creation of 
character, the freedom of thought, the satires on the times, and to 
hear from the actor's lips the conceptions of the dramatist, have 
generally been the ambition of poets.
Few young writers think, 
when they sit down to write a play, of its positive necessities, of the 
unities of time and place ; and I think it may be asserted, of all 
the rubbish written in novels and in books, there cannot be more 
presented than is offered to the public in the shape of plays.
On 
one occasion a play was sent to me for perusal, and when I opened 
the manuscript, I found the story commenced in the infernal 
regions, with a dialogue between three evil spirits, when to them 
251 
entered Sesostris, King of Egypt, who, after some slight conver- 
sation, rang a bell and called " John the Waiter," who entered at 
that moment.
How the would-be dramatist could reconcile the 
presence of Sesostris, an ancient King of Egypt, and our modern 
"John the Waiter" at the same time, was too much for me.
I 
laid the drama down and did not enquire further.
It must be remembered that up to the year 1622, 
there were but few books, and those must have been most 
expensive.
The ignorant masses must have gained their little 
learning from the drama.
It was not till the Civil War that 
newspapers regularly made their appearance, which, of course, soon 
helped to enlighten the minds of many groping in the dark.
From 
the dissolute writers of Charles II., we have little to record till 
Addison came, who wrote the tragedy of "Cato," a fine declamatory 
poem, but without the life and fire of true dramatic poetry ; like 
a fine piece of sculpture compared to a living human being.
Nicholas Rowe, the author of the drama of "Jane Shore," 
lived at this time.
He is to be remembered as having first written 
the " Life of Shakespere," and to him we are indebted for the 
little knowledge we possess of our poet's history.
Allan Ramsey, 
who wrote the pastoral drama of " The Gende Shepherd," and 
Gay, the dramatist of " The Beggar's Opera," closely followed at 
this period.
No great genius came upon the scene from this date 
till poor Oliver Goldsmith took the town by storm with "She 
Stoops to Conquer." This gave a new turn to the drama, and was 
followed by other witty comedies in the same style by Brindley 
Sheridan, George Colman, Holcroft, and others, whose works — 
"The School for Scandal," "The Rivals," "The Heir at Law," 
— are ever likely to keep the stage.
They are pictures of life as it 
then was, and bring back to us the fashions and manners of our 
forefathers.
Going a little further back, Samuel Johnson wrote a prologue 
252 
for David Garrick at the opening of Drury Lane theatre, which 
gives in epitome the falling off of the great writers for the stage 
since the time of Shakespere : — 
" When learning's triumph o'er her barbarous foes 
First reared the stage, immortal Shakespere rose ; 
Each change of many coloured life he knew, 
Exhausted worlds, and then imagined new.
Existence saw him spurn her bounded reign.
And panting Time toiled after him in vain ; 
His powerful strokes presiding truth imprest, 
And unresisted passion stormed the breast.
Then Jonson came, instructed from the scliool.
To please in method, and invent by rule ; 
His studious patience and laborious art.
By regular approach, essayed the heart.
Cold approbation gave the lingering bays — 
For those who dui-st not venture, scarce could praise.
A mortal born, he met the general doom.
But left, like Egypt's kings, a lasting tomb.
The wits of Charles found easier ways to fame, 
Nor wished for Jonson's art, or Shakespeare's fame ; 
Themselves they studied, as they felt they writ, — 
Intrigue was plot, obscenity was wit ; 
Vice always found a sympathetic friend, 
They pleased their age and did not aim to mend.
Yet bards like these aspired to lasting praise, 
And proudly hoped to pimp in future days.
Their cause was general, their supports were strong, 
Their slaves were willing, and their reign was long.
Till shame regained the post that sense betrayed.
And virtue called oblivion to her aid.
Hard is his lot that here by fortune placed, 
To watch the wild vicissitude of taste ; 
With every meteor of caprice must play.
And chase the new blown bubbles of the day.
Oh !
let not censure term our fate our choice, — 
The stage but echoes back the public voice ; 
The drama's laws, the drama's patrons give.
For we that live to please, must please to live." 
263 
George Colman, the author of " The Jealous Wife," and his 
son of the same name, added to our national drama the comedies 
of "The Heir at Law," "John Bull," and "The Poor Gentleman," 
all of which plays are still represented.
It is a singular fact that a great many clergymen have written 
for the stage, and amongst them may be cited — John Home, the 
author of the tragedy of "Douglas," who was persecuted with 
such fierceness by the Presbytery at Edinbro', that he had to flee 
the country; Dr. Young, who wrote "The Revenge;" Dean 
Milman, of St. Paul's, who wrote "Fazio;" the Rev. Mr.
Maturin, 
who wrote the tragedy of " Bertram," and hundreds of others.
It should be mentioned that at all times as the habits and 
customs of society improved, so did the drama at all periods 
reflect the progress of the age.
John Tobin, the author of " The Honeymoon," deserves a 
passing word for his admirable word-painting in his description to 
his wife of the dress he would have her appear in.
The story, it 
may be remembered, is taken from Shakespere's " Taming of the 
Shrew." The Duke says : — 
' ' I should like well to see you 
In the dress I last presented you.
" 
She says, "The blue one?" to which he replies, 
"No love, the white.
Thus modestly attired, 
A half blown rose stuck in thy braided hair, 
With no more diamonds than those eyes are made of, 
No deeper rubies than compose thy lips, 
Nor pearls more precious than inhabit them ; 
With the pure red and white which that same Hand 
Which blends the rainbow, mingles, in thy cheeks, 
Thy well proportioned form (think not I flatter) 
In graceful motion to harmonious sounds, 
And thy free tresses dancing in the wind, 
Thou'lt fix as much observance as chaste dames 
Can meet without a blush." 
254 
The expression Aranza gives, when telling his wife he would wish 
her to be as Heaven made her, "With the pure red and white 
which that same Hand that blends the rainbow mingles in thy 
cheeks," is, I think, singularly felicitous.
Sheridan Knowles is the next famous dramatist of modern 
times, or rather of the present century ; but his style is not original, 
being moulded upon that of Philip Massinger, one of the best of 
our Elizabethan poets.
His language is graceful and forcible, but 
at times the meaning of the sentences and the plots of his plays 
are somewhat obscure.
" William Tell," " Virginius," and " The 
Hunchback," are the most popular of his plays.
Selections from 
them may be found in every " Guide to Elocution." 
Bulwer Lytton, though somewhat high flown in sentiment, has 
done good service to the drama by his noble play of " Richlieu," 
the comedy of " Money," and the ever popular " Lady of Lyons." 
Society has altered much during the last decade.
The taste 
generally is not to see the Elizabethan or the legitimate drama, but 
to see reflected the manners, habits, and customs of this matter-of- 
fact age ; and for that reason few men are to be found writing 
plays with any poetic skill, but rather attempting to string so many 
incidents together, either to excite interest or to cause a laugh.
With rare exceptions, the poetical drama of the present day 
may be said to have died out, although Westland Marston, and 
Mr. Wills, the author of "Charles I." and "Jane Shore," still live to 
prove that polished and graceful poetical writing may be appreci- 
ated by us even in these degenerate days.
It is only natural that taste should change, and that T.
W. 
Robertson, Albery, and Henry Byron in their comedies, such as 
" Society," " Caste," " The Two Roses," and " Our Boys," should 
be preferred to the creations of our elder dramatists.
As the 
glorious writers of the Elizabethan era reflected the age in which 
they lived, so do our modern writers mirror the faults and foibles 
255 
of the present time ; and if the fine imagery and glowing thoughts 
are not presented in our modern dramas, it is because they are not 
wanted ; and what we may lack in graceful metaphor and polished 
phrase, we doubtless gain in delicacy and good taste.
I will conclude this paper with the remark that the English 
Drama, the offspring of Civilization and of Art, containing the 
culled flowers from the choicest gardens of our poets, will ever 
remain deeply engraved in the hearts of the English people, and 
be appreciated as long as our language is spoken.

FLAX AND FLAX- WORKERS.
By W.
WILSON.
(Read at Whitehaven.) 
I do not think it necessary to make an apology for reading a 
paper on trade at a Scientific Institution, inasmuch as it would, I 
presume, be readily admitted that scientific pursuits and scientific 
discoveries were valuable in proportion to their ministering to the 
necessities and enjoyments of life.
He who would form a correct 
estimate of the benefits resulting to mankind from the industries of 
the United kingdom, must not omit the Linen Trade.
The linen 
trade is of national importance.
There is also considerable artistic 
skill displayed in the production of a material which, for personal 
wear and many domestic purposes, is at once the most cleanly, 
healthful, and agreeable of all the home-made fabrics in use 
amongst us.
When looked at under the microscope, the flax fibre is seen 
to be cylindrical, bright, smooth, and transparent.
The cotton 
fibre is, on the other hand, surrounded by a multitude of exceed- 
ingly minute edges.
This may explain the reason why linen and 
cotton cloths act so differently upon the health of those who wear 
them.
In point of national importance, the linen trade holds a 
prominent place amongst the industries of the world : some 
millions of persons in the United Kingdom are employed in the 
manufacture of linen.
It is stated that about one-third of the 
population of Ireland are, in one way or other, connected with the 
18 
258 
cultivation of flax, and its manufacture into linen.
A trade which 
finds employment for so large a portion of the population of the 
country, is of great importance ; and, therefore, any cause which 
seriously interferes with its freedom, is felt to be a great national 
calamity.* 
As to the artistic skill displayed in the linen industries, I do 
not exaggerate when I state that art manufacture has not in any 
department attained to greater perfection than it has in the pictorial 
designs of our high-class figured damasks.
On a plain ground of 
highly bleached linen cloth, white as snow, figures of fruits, 
flowers, animals, and birds are formed, — not in mere outline, but 
they stand out as perfect in form, feature, and detail, as a piece of 
finely executed statuary in bas-relief, by a first-class artist.
The 
Jacquard Loom, on which those fine damasks are woven, is 
perhaps the most complicated and perfect piece of machinery ever 
invented.
By a simple arrangement of the thread, the most minute 
details in the form and plumage of a bird can be produced.
Great improvement has of late been made in the manufacture 
of Jute Hemp, which is the lowest in value and durability of all the 
hemp and flax fibres.
In the low, swampy grounds of Southern 
India, jute is indigenous, and grows to the height of from ten to 
fourteen feet.
Jute is now imported into this country in great 
quantities.
The coarsest descriptions are chiefly used for common 
bags.
It is even currently reported that sail-cloth is also made from 
it ; — I hope that this is only idle gossip.
The safety of many a 
ship depends upon the sails consisting of a much better and 
stronger material than jute cloth.
The finer portions of jute have 
such a bright glossy appearance, that they can be made to 
resemble silk.
I have seen a good imitation of a silk hat said to 
have been made from jute ; the cost was only four shillings.
I 
could see very little difference between the silk hat I was wearing 
and the hat made from jute fibre.
It is also well known that silks 
in the web are sometimes wefted with jute yarn.
A lady in Liver- 
* In addition to the flax grown in the country, about 80,000 tons of flax 
are imported annually.
The export trade amounts to ;^io,ooo,ooo annually.
The value of the whole trade is estimated at upwards of ;^40,ooo,ooo annually.
259 
pool, in looking at some silks, enquired whether the piece she was 
looking at was all silk ?
" No," said the shopman, " it is mixed 
with something as good as silk, called jute." " I know what jute 
is," said the lady; "silks made of jute will not suit me." 
A new description of cloth made from jute is produced at the 
Barrow Mills, for which a prize medal was awarded at the late 
exhibition in Paris.
I wrote to the manager asking for some 
information respecting the jute cloth, and for samples.
They have 
been kind enough to send as many webs as would enable me to 
start a small retail shop.* 
I must now address myself to the antiquity of flax and flax- 
workers, in as few words as a subject embracing such a wide field 
will admit of.
The linen manufacture appears to have had its origin among 
the Egyptians.
The flax plant was indigenous in Egypt.
From 
the statement made in the Book of Exodus, we may infer that flax 
was extensively cultivated in Egypt in the time of Moses.
Flax is 
first named in the account given of the plagues in Egypt.
It is 
stated, that " the flax and barley were smitten," for " the barley was 
in the ear, and the flax was boiled." Then, that "the wheat and 
the rye were not smitten, for they were not grown up." From this we 
learn that, 3,000 years ago, there were two crops annually in Egypt, 
as there are at the present day — a winter crop and a summer 
crop.
The heat of summer, which was favourable for the growth of 
wheat, was too hot for flax and barley.
The last named were the 
winter crops, and were smitten by the storm of hail which occurred 
at this season of the year.
Such was the fertility of the land, that Egypt became not only 
the greatest wheat producing, but also the largest flax growing 
country in the world, and the great emporium of the linen trade.
Specimens of linen have been discovered in Egypt which are said 
to be fully 4,000 years old.
We learn from late researches, 
especially by Sir J.
G. Wilkinson, that flax was grown, spun, 
bleached, and woven long prior to the existence of any historical 
record.
The processes of manufacture have been admirably 
* The samples were exhibited in the lecture room.
260 
depicted by the skilful hand of the artist on those imperishable 
tablets found on the walls of the ancient palaces and temples.
There are representations of the various implements employed, and 
the people in the act of sowing the seed, pulling the plant, 
carrying water to fill the wooden vats for the purpose of steeping 
the flax, dressing and spinning it into yarn, and weaving the yarn 
into cloth, distinctly pourtrayed with a minuteness of detail, and 
beauty of colouring, said to be truly astonishing.
The walls of the 
curious grottoes and sepulchres dug out of the limestone rock are 
covered with paintings as fresh and brilliant as when first executed.
Ranges of hills for miles in upper Egypt are filled with chambers 
for the dead.
It is worthy of note, that very little improvement had been 
made in the process of preparing the flax, and spinning it by hand, 
up to the middle of last century.
Several spindles have been 
found, one of them with linen thread on it, very similar to those 
which were in use just before spinning by machinery was invented.
The linen trade in Egypt must have been considerable at a 
very early period.
Both the living and the dead were clothed with 
linen.
As an article of clothing in hot Eastern countries especially, 
linen cloth is of all others the cleanest, coolest, and most agree- 
able.
It was the ordinary dress of the ancient Egyptians.
The 
priests were forbidden to wear vestments of any other material.
Independently of what was required to be made into articles of 
dress, the numerous wrappers required for enveloping mummies 
both of men and animals, show how large a quantity must have 
been kept ready for the constant home demand.
The linen taken 
from one mummy weighed twenty-nine pounds, and measured 
upwards of three hundred yards, being wound up in forty thick- 
nesses of cloth, varying from the finest muslin to the coarsest 
sail-cloth.
Almost every museum in Europe of any pretensions contains 
one or more of these highly dried human specimens.
For many 
centuries the caverns of Egypt have been mines of wealth to the 
Arabs living in the neighbourhood, the bodies being used by them 
as fuel for cooking their victuals, and the wrappers made into 
261 
clothes for themselves, or sold for the purpose of being made into 
paper.
Some idea may be formed of the vast accumulation of 
linen in the mummy pits and sepulchres of Egypt, when it was at 
one time a speculation even in Europe, whether it should not be 
collected for the purpose of paper making.
The manufacture and 
sale of linen were amongst the most respectable and lucrative 
branches of Egyptian commerce.
The export trade must have been very considerable, all the 
neighbouring countries being supplied from Egypt.
We learn 
from that most ancient and authentic history, the Bible, that 
Solomon made a navy of ships.
These ships traded once in three 
years to Egypt, along the coasts of the Red Sea. Amongst the 
imports brought by these ships was the fine linen of Egypt, and 
linen yarn.
The king's merchant received the linen yarn at a 
price, so that there must also have been manufacturing establish- 
ments, where the linen yarn was woven into cloth and finished 
ready for use.
There is a remarkable passage in I Chron.
iv.
21, 
"the families of the house of them that wrought fine linen," the 
literal translation of which is said to be, "The partnerships of the 
manufactory of fine linen." The prophet Hosea twice mentions 
linen as one of the chief materials used for clothing in his time.
The perfection to which the Egyptians had attained in weaving 
and in all the processes connected with the manufacture of fine 
linen, was such that they have not been surpassed even in modern 
times.
Some specimens have been found so fine, that the very finest 
productions of the looms at the present day can scarcely compare 
with them.
The very finest cambric or lawn looks coarse beside 
the specimens of the Egyptian looms.
The perfection of the 
threads of the Egyptian linen is equally surprising.
The knots 
and breaks seen in our finest cambric cannot be observed in the 
Egyptian linen, which was so fine and transparent that it obtained 
the name of woven air.
Every detail of the figure which it 
enveloped could be seen with perfect clearness.
When laid on 
the grass and wetted with the dew, it became invisible.
In dyeing the Egyptians had attained to gi-eat perfection.
In 
Thebes alone two thousand workmen were employed in dyeing in 
262 
scarlet and purple.
Many of the cloths present various patterns 
worked in colour by the loom.
The colour is rich enough to vie 
with the Babylonian cloth embroidered with the needle.
The 
manner in which these tapestries were wrought is now unknown.
The coloured dresses worn by ladies of rank, and with which also 
the deities were clothed, are said to resemble modern chintzes in 
the style of their patterns.
What the rich silks of China and 
France, or the beautiful lace of Belgium are to us, so the fine linen 
and embroidered work of Egypt were among contemporary nations.
The more luxurious the habits of the people, the more these 
articles were valued and used.
All the perfection in the making and finishing of the fine 
linens of Egypt, and in the production of embroidered work, has 
passed away many ages ago.
The glory of Egyptian artistic skill, 
the handiwork of skilled artisans who lived from three to four 
thousand years ago, lies buried in the mummy pits, or amidst the 
ruins of the splendid palaces, temples, and tombs.
War and 
oppression — the grinding oppression of irresponsible rulers — have 
crushed the spirit out of the people, and deprived them of all 
motives for industry.
Under the dominion of the Turk there was 
scant security for life and property, and Eg}'pt as a nation has sunk 
down into the lowest depths of weakness and degradation.
After what has been said in reference to Egypt, a few words 
may be added on the linen made and used in Palestine.
The 
Israelites on quitting Egypt carried with them a vast quantity of 
valuable articles, as is clearly shown by the varied and extensive 
offerings of the people for the furnishings of the tabernacle, 
amongst which was blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine linen, 
and goat's hair.
They had also learnt the art of weaving, and of 
constructing looms and all other implements and machinery for 
the production of the articles required for the tabernacle, and 
other purposes.
It is related that " all the women who were wise 
hearted (among the Israelites) did spin with their hands, and 
brought that which they had spun (an offering unto the Lord), of 
blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine linen of the weaver." 
Linen would thus appear to have entered largely into the 
203 
magnificent furniture and fittings of the tabernacle, and almost 
wholly to have composed the clothing and gorgeous robes of 
the priests, both on ordinary and state occasions.
Aaron, when 
he entered the holy place, was required to wash his flesh in water, 
to put on the holy Unen coat, to have the linen breeches upon his 
flesh, to be girded with a linen girdle, and to be attired with the 
linen mitre.
These were holy garments.
Garments woven in one piece throughout, so as to need no 
making, were held in high repute ; hence the Jews have a tradition 
that no needle was employed in the clothing of the high priest, 
each piece of which was of one continued texture ; this idea throws 
light on the description of the coat of Jesus.
The coat was without 
seam, woven from the top throughout.
In this the ancients surpass 
the modern manufacturers.
After the furnishings of the tabernacle in the wilderness, the 
furnishings of Solomon's splendid temple, and the robes for the 
priests when ministering by course there, appear to have been 
marvels of art in spinning, weaving, dyeing, and embroidering, and 
shew the great progress which the Israelites had attained in linen 
manufacture.
The descendants of Abraham were a distinct people, 
separated by national peculiarities from the rest of mankind ; and 
their trade, manufacture, and commerce partook of the same 
localized character.
After the Jews came the Phoenicians, a people who occupied 
the sea coast at the head of the Mediterranean sea.
Their chief 
cities were Sidon and Tyre.
Sidon, which is said to have been 
founded 2000 years B.C., was a great naval port.
The oaks of 
Bashan, the fir trees of Senir, and the cedars of Lebanon, afforded 
an almost inexhaustible supply of wood for ship building, and for 
other purposes.
Tyre, which was founded about 1200 years B.C., 
soon rose to greatness and wealth.
Her traders were called the 
merchant princes of the world.
Tyre was long celebrated for its 
dyed fabrics, especially purple.
Linen dyed of this colour was 
greatly esteemed among all the neighbouring nations, and formed 
an important item in the commerce of Tyre.
Ships from Tyre 
264 
traded in the Red Sea, and far south along the east coast of Africa, 
as well as on the coast of the Mediterranean, and passing through 
the straits of Gibraltar, came as far north as the coasts of Great 
Britain and Ireland.
Rawlinson, writing on Phoenicia, says : "The 
commercial spirit of the Phoenicians was largely exemplified by the 
fact of their establishing colonies along the coasts of the Mediter- 
ranean, which were rapidly covered with settlements and cities 
where factories were established." At this time Phoenicia had no 
serious commercial rival.
The trade of the world was in her hands.
Industry and enterprise reaped their usual harvest of success.
The 
Phoenicians grew in wealth, and their towns became great and 
magnificent cities.
Amongst them, and the most celebrated of 
them, were the cities of Carthage and Cadiz.
Amongst the imports 
into Carthage were fine flax, sails and cables for ships, yarns and 
fine linens from Egypt, purple and scarlet ; tapestry and rich stuff 
from Tyre.
These goods were used at home, or again exported 
to the western parts of the then known world, where they were 
exchanged for iron, tin, lead, copper, and other products of these 
lands.
From the large importation of linen yarn, it may be inferred 
that the manufacture of linen was carried on to a large extent in 
this city.
Carthage rose to be the chief centre of the trade of the 
world ; but the Carthaginians in the course of time, enervated by 
their luxurious habits, fell an easy prey to the Romans.
The linen trade of ancient Greece and Rome is worthy of a 
passing notice.
Neither country, however, was very favourable for 
an extensive trade in manufacturing industries.
War was more 
congenial to the tastes of their petty tribes, than the industrial 
pursuits of trade and commerce.
Greece being hilly, was more 
suited for the production of wool than flax.
Colonies from 
Egypt and Phoenicia settling in Greece, however, gave an impetus 
to the linen manufacture.
Spinning and weaving soon became 
distinct trades, carried on by separate classes of persons.
Pliny 
states that, "amongst the finest and most elegant fabrics of Greece, 
were those manufactured in the city of Patrae," where the women 
being twice as numerous as the men, would alone appear to have 
worked in the factories, and from which the greater number of the 
265 
inhabitants derived their hvehhood.
In addition to these i^ubUc 
works, there were very considerable domestic establishments, 
especially in the country, where the spinning wheel and the loom 
formed a part of the household goods.
When a gentleman first 
commenced housekeeijing, or got a new set of donaestic servants, 
he delivered into the keeping of the proper persons his kneading 
troughs, kitchen utensils, cards, looms, spinning wheels, etc.
Thus 
Homer speaks of the implements of war, looms, spinning wheels, 
embroidering frames, being mixed up together in Greek houses.
When the house or palace was sufficiently large to admit of it, 
a separate portion was devoted to spinning.
The work was 
principally carried on by female slaves, under the superintendence 
of the mistress of the house ; but the noblest in the land did not 
think it beneath their dignity to join in the labour.
When Alex- 
ander the Great presented to the captive Persian queen, flax and 
wool, she said in an agony of grief and tears, that they reminded 
her of happier days.
The conqueror misunderstanding her 
feelings, and desiring to remove the notion that he was imposing 
any servile task, observed, "This garment which you see me wear, 
is not only the gift, but the work of my mother and sisters." 
As much dignity is supposed to belong to ample drapery, the 
ladies in some Grecian cities took care not to be sparing of their 
stuff.
Their dresses had long trains displaying numerous folds 
purposely produced at the extremity by a band passed round the 
edge.
These garments were generally of linen.
Snow white 
slippers made of fine linen, and wroug^it with needle work, were 
also worn.
Such seems to have been the fashion 2500 years ago.
The Greeks were famous for the beautiful patterns woven in 
their cloths.
The patterns were variegated with stripes, lozenges, 
and the figures of birds and other animals.
Flowers and stars of 
the most beautiful and brilliant colours were interwoven into their 
textures, and others were richly embroidered.
In some parts of 
Greece, especially in some of the numerous Greek islands, a very 
fine quality of flax was grown, the fabric from which, whether snow- 
white or purple, would have rivalled the finest cambric.
The 
texture was of the most delicate description, and semi-transparent, 
266 
This fine linen was so valuable that it sold for its weight in gold.
It is related that an ambassador from a king of Persia to India, on 
his return home presented his master with a cocoa nut set in 
jewels, containing a muslin turban thirty yards in length, and so 
exceedingly fine as scarcely to be felt by the touch.
After the rise of the Roman power, Greece gradually lost its 
influence, until its states became provinces of Rome.
Gibbon 
says, "that after the age of Justinian, the Eastern Empire began 
to decay, and but for its trade and manufactures, it would have 
sunk faster than it did." 
The ancient Romans were more celebrated for military than 
for manufacturing and commercial pursuits.
At an early period of 
their history, they had colonies in various parts of Europe and 
Asia, from whence they drew their suppUes of many of the 
necessaries and luxuries of life.
The colonies provided them with 
the bulk of the fabrics they required — Spain, Gaul, Germany, as 
well as Egypt.
Phcenicia and Greece sent the productions of their 
looms to Rome, and found a ready market for them there.
Rome, 
however, had also its weaving establishments, conducted by a 
distinct class of people.
Hired women used to weave in the open 
air.
It had also its domestic manufacture, in which the mistress 
and her maidens both performed their part.
Spinning and weaving 
were considered honourable employments, and formed the chief 
occupation of females in every rank.
The family loom long stood 
in the public apartment of the mansion, and there the lady of the 
house sat and toiled, surroftnded by her maidens.
The Roman Emperors encouraged the trade, and were at great 
pains to procure the best artificers of all kinds, particularly the best 
manufacturers of woollen and linen cloth.
These they formed 
into corporations, with various privileges, and settled them in the 
most convenient places of the several provinces of the empire.
Pliny supplies many particulars of the Roman trade ; and he 
wrote his account of it in the reign of Vespasian, when Rome was 
in its most flourishing state.
Augustus, even when all simplicity of manner had expired with 
the Republic, affected still to bring up the females of his family 
267 
upon the antique model, and wore no garments but such as were 
manufactured in his own house.
Centuries after the age of 
Augustus, Rome, enervated by luxury, torn and rent by internal 
factions, fell an easy prey to the barbarous hordes of Northern 
Europe, who had no taste for dress, art, or refinement; and a 
period of barbarism overspread the Roman Empire, which is most 
appropriately called the Dark Ages, during which there is little or 
no record of art or industry, trade or commerce.
The linen manu- 
facture shared in the universal wreck and ruin.
We now come to review the linen trade in modern times, 
under new, and, in some respects, more favourable conditions.
Religious intolerance, which in modern times persecuted to the 
death, or drove into exile the best and most industrious citizens, 
for no other reason than that they would not bow their necks to 
the yoke imposed on the faithful by their rulers ; mistaken 
legislation, some times by restrictive measures, at others by 
attempting to regulate by Act of Parliament a trade which would 
have thriven better if left to itself; and last, though not least, the 
ignorant and suicidal conduct of workmen in attempting to destroy 
machinery, and combining to impose unreasonable conditions on 
their employers, and by neglecting work, when work was abundant 
and orders unfulfilled — all tended to interfere with the freedom and 
progress of the trade.
The Conquest of England by William of Normandy (1066), 
gave an impulse to the manufactures of this country.
Great 
numbers of weavers came over in his army, and others followed on 
invitation of the Conqueror.
This influx of workmen was soon 
afterwards greatly increased by the sea overflowing and permanently 
inundating a large portion of Flanders, which forced many of the 
Flemings to take refuge in England.
The skill of the Flemings 
in weaving was so great, that an ancient historian remarks, " that 
it seemed to be a peculiar gift bestowed on them by nature." 
During this reign, the weavers in all the great towns in England 
were incorporated into Guilds, and had certain privileges conferred 
on them by Royal Charter, in return for which they paid certain 
fines into the exchequer.
The linen made in England at this 
•2C>S 
time, was, however, very coarse.
All the finer kinds were then, 
and for long afterwards, imported from the Continent.
The ladies 
of this period, we are told, wore loose flowing garments, chiefly 
made of linen.
Amongst persons of distinction, a kind of stocking, 
consisting of strips of woollen or linen cloth, wrapped round the 
leg like bandages, began to be worn.
Linen also began to come 
into use for underclothing.
It was deemed not only pleasant, but 
necessary, as a remedy against cutaneous diseases, which were 
then very prevalent.
Until the middle of the sixteenth century, the Netherlands 
was, however, the chief manufacturing and commercial country in 
Europe.
Antwerp was the most opulent city in Europe, and the 
great trading mart from whence large quantities of hnen were 
exported to all the neighbouring countries.
It was in one of the 
towns, Cambray (whence the name, cambric), that the finest linen 
was made.
Sixty thousand webs, valued at ^240,000, were made 
annually.
The prosperity of the Netherlands was not of long 
continuance.
The religious persecution instituted against the 
inhabitants by the bigoted Philip II.
of Spain, and the sacking of 
Antwerp by the Duke of Alva, the Regent, had the effect of 
driving great numbers of skilled weavers into England, who con- 
tributed largely to the progress and improvement of the manu- 
factures in this country.
Under Louis XVIIL, religious persecution drove 600,000 of 
the best citizens out of France.
Large numbers of weavers and 
other skilled workmen settled in England, bringing with them 
their industrious and peaceful habits, and their skilled labour.
At 
this time, many silk weavers settled in Spittalfields, from whom 
sprung the flourishing silk trade of that district.
Thus England 
again benefited by the injury inflicted upon the inhabitants of a 
foreign country by the ignorant bigotry of their ruler.
The 17th century was prolific in Acts of Parliament having 
for their object the encouraging of the growth of flax, and the 
manufacture of linen both in England and Ireland.
The 
importation of these articles was strictly prohibited ; and at one 
time the wearing of French cambric was punishable with heavy 
269 
penalties.
The trade with France was considered by the Parlia- 
ment then assembled as detrimental to this kingdom.
It was not, however, until towards the close of the last century, 
when the inventions in spinning machinery by Hargreaves, Ark- 
wright, Kendrew, and Porthouse, were coupled with the improve- 
ments in the steam engine by Watt and Bolton, that the three 
great industries in this country — woollen, cotton, and linen — 
suddenly began to develop, and although the linen industry is 
by far the smallest of the three, yet it is now so extensive as to 
be estimated at about forty millions of annual value.
In 1787, John Kendrew, spectacle maker, and Thomas Port- 
house, clockmaker, of Darlington, invented machinery for flax 
spinning, and for some time after it was carried on at Darlington, 
in a small building called the Low Mill.
The difficulties the 
inventors had to encounter, and the smallness of their means, were 
such that they never succeeded to any great extent in flax spinning.
Great improvements were soon effected on the original machines 
in Leeds, and that town speedily became the head quarters of flax 
spinning in England.
The Marshalls, of Leeds, now entered upon 
their prosperous career in the new trade, and by ability and 
perseverance, soon became the largest flax spinners in the world.
Fifty thousand acres of land would be required to grow the flax 
they import annually.
To this family Leeds is indebted for much 
of its present prosperity.
The great flax mill erected by the 
Marshalls is one of the most striking buildings in Leeds.
It covers 
more than two acres of ground ; and it is supposed that 80,000 
persons might stand in the spinning room.
The whole process, 
after the heckling of the flax, is performed in it.
The flax goes in 
in bundles and the linen out in bales.
If I am rightly informed, there occurred in the early days of 
the Marshalls' spinning, one of those interruptions to their trade 
by the bad conduct of the workmen, especially the flax dressers, 
which produced important results.
The masters were so annoyed 
and hindered by the strikes, and by the men neglecting their work 
when work was much wanted, that they turned their attention to 
the invention of machines for dressing flax.
When the flax dressers 
270 
neglected their work, or struck for higher wages, the whole process 
was brought to a standstill.
Spinning and weaving machines were 
stopped for want of material ; hands thrown out of employment ; 
and masters could not fulfil the orders for goods.
Flax-dressing 
machines were then invented, by means of which six girls can do 
as much work as ten or twelve men could perform by hand.
Since their invention, these machines have been much imj^roved.
The flax dresser's labour was therefore no longer required, while 
the employers could execute more work, and even a better quality 
of work, by the machine than was done by hand labour.
Flax- 
dressing was a hard and unhealthy employment ; and in this case 
good may be said to have come out of evil.
Man is better fitted 
to be employed making and superintending the working of 
machines than to be working as a machine himself.
Ireland is the largest linen producing country in the world.
There are now nearly one million spindles in Ireland.
Each 
spindle will produce as much yarn as ten or twelve persons could 
spin by hand.
It would therefore require double the population 
of Ireland at the present time to produce as much work, suppose 
all were employed in hand spinning.
There are besides, upwards 
of 20,000 power-looms, each loom capable of doing as much work 
as four or five men, and in some kinds of work one woman can 
attend two looms.
The linen trade has thus far overstepped the 
capabilities of the country, so far as hand labour is concerned ; 
and yet there are foolish people who exclaim against the increase 
of machinery, and sigh for the good old times of Queen Bess.
Very little of an authentic character is known respecting the 
cultivation of flax, and of the linen manufacture in Ireland in 
ancient times.
Tradition credits a colony of Phoenicians, who are 
said to have settled in Ireland before the Christian era, with 
having taught the native Irish the art of flax culture, and the after 
process of manufacture.
There can, however, have been very 
little linen made or exported before the latter end of the 17th 
century.
. In 1673, England imported from France linen of the 
value of upwards of half a million, which she would not have done 
if Ireland could have supplied it.
About the year 1680, the linen 
271 
trade began to flourish amongst the Scotch in the North of Ireland, 
where it still flourishes as the great staple trade of the country.
In the reign of Charles II., the woollen manufacture had 
made great progress in Ireland, especially in the south and west.
This roused the jealousy of the English manufacturers, and they 
got an Act passed in the British Parliament prohibiting any export 
of wool from Ireland, excepting to England and Wales.
Not 
content with this, in 1698 both houses of Parliament addressed 
King William III., representing, "that in consequence of labour 
being cheaper in Ireland than in England, the progress of the 
woollen manufacture in the former was such as to prejudice that 
of the latter country, and that it would be for the public advantage 
were the woollen trade discouraged and the linen manufacture 
established in its stead." His Majesty replied : "I shall do all 
that in me lies to discourage the woollen manufacture in Ireland, 
and to encourage the linen manufacture, and to promote the trade 
of England." 
The Parhament of 1698 recommended to the King a kind of 
compromise with Ireland, whereby England should exclusively 
enjoy the woollen and Ireland the linen manufacture.
Ireland 
accepted the terms, abandoned the woollen manufacture, and even 
imposed heavy duties on the exportation of woollen cloth.
The 
effect of this was ruinous to the woollen trade.
Several thousand 
manufacturers left the kingdom.
Some of the southern and 
western districts were almost depopulated, and the whole kingdom 
reduced to the utmost poverty and distress.
It is to be feared 
religious bigots and intolerance had much to do with the suppres- 
sion of the woollen manufacture, and establishing that of linen in 
its stead.
The woollen trade had been carried on in a great 
measure in the south and west of Ireland, while the chief seat of 
the linen manufacture was in the north.
I fear this will bear no 
other construction but that Protestant linens were encouraged, 
whereas Popish woollens were suppressed.
In an Act of the British Parliament in the year 1704, the 
preamble commences thus : " Forasmuch as the Protestant interest 
in Ireland ought to be supported by giving the utmost encourage- 
272 
ment to the linen manufactures of that kingdom," — and thus a 
real Irish grievance was perpetrated.
Fortunately for Ireland 
about this period the linen manufacture began to enter upon a 
prosperous career.
In 1699, Louis Crommelin, a wealthy French refugee, and a 
number of other refugees, settled in the north of Ireland.
The 
Huguenots had in their native land been chiefly employed in the 
manufacture of silk, and the finer fabrics of linen.
They com- 
menced similar manufactures in the land of their adoption, and 
imparted to those around them the skill and energy which they 
had been wont to exercise in France.
About this date, an Act 
had been passed by the Cromwellian Parliament prohibiting the 
importation of French linen.
Consequently the demand for such 
goods had largely increased in Ireland and Great Britain.
Louis Crommelin, on arriving in Ireland, was at once chosen 
as the leader of his brother exiles.
In that position he exercised 
a powerful influence over the future fortunes of the linen trade.
The looms on which the weavers of Ulster then wove their linen 
webs were of a very primitive construction, and very ineffective in 
their operations.
Crommelin brought over with him a number 
of Dutch looms.
These he greatly improved ; and also made 
great improvements in the spinning wheels.
He also invested 
^10,000 from his own private resources.
This King William III.
repaid by a grant of ;^8oo per annum as interest on the 
capital for twelve years.
In addition to this grant, Crommelin was 
also allowed an annuity of ^100, and ^^120 to three assistants, 
each of whom had a particular district to attend to.
At one 
period of the season he watched over the culture of flax, at another 
he inspected the spinning and weaving departments, and through 
the summer his visits were frequently made to the bleach fields.
The death of William III.
deprived Ireland of one of its most 
liberal patrons.
Soon after the accession of Queen Anne to the 
throne, the imperial treasury refused the annual grant to Louis 
Crommelin.
This was a most disgraceful proceeding and breach 
of faith, as the annuity could not be called a Royal pension, but a 
sum paid as interest on the capital which Crommelin had invested 
273 
for a public purpose.
The money had been scattered throughout 
Ulster in the shape of looms, spinning wheels, machines for 
scutching, flax and bleaching apparatus, all of which had been lent 
to weavers, spinners, farmers, and owners of small bleachfields, 
not more than one half the value of which was ever repaid.
It 
must have been highly gratifying, however, to the founder of the 
improved system of linen manufacture, to watch the growing 
success of his projects, and to see the rapid changes which greater 
profits and higher wages had produced in the circumstances of 
manufacturers and weavers ; also to receive from the Board of 
Trustees appointed by the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland at this 
time, the following notice : "Louis CrommeHn and the Huguenot 
Colony have been greatly instrumental in improving and pro- 
pagating the flaxen manufacture in the north of this kingdom, and 
the perfection to which the same is brought in that part of the 
country has been greatly owing to the skill and industry of the said 
Crommelin." 
Lord Strafford, who was Lord Lieutenant of Ireland at this 
time (1736), did all in his power to discourage the woollen trade, 
but used every means he thought fit to promote and improve the 
linen trade, and to assist in developing it.
He spent out of his 
own means ^^50,000.
His first movement was directed to the 
improvement of flax in the field.
For this purpose he imported 
seed from Holland, and brought over Dutchmen to instruct the 
Irish farmers in the best mode of growing the crop.
He sold the 
seed which he imported to the farmers at cost price ; and by his 
persevering exertions, he succeeded in bringing the flax from an 
average of twelve inches in length to three feet.
The yarn now 
spun was also much more regular, and the cloth in every respect 
better.
The prejudices of an ignorant class, not only against the 
Englishman's rule, but also against the ideas he entertained, which 
were so contrary to long established usage, and, moreover, the 
high handed imperious way in which he attempted to carry out his 
improvements, stirred up opposition and bitter strife amongst the 
native population which, to a great extent, frustrated his otherwise 
well intentioned measures.
Had he adopted conciliatory measures, 
19 
274 
and his agents been careful to use moderation in their efforts to 
overcome the deeply-rooted prejudices of the people, he would 
doubtless have succeeded to a much greater extent in bettering 
their condition, and improving still more the linen industry.
One 
ot his proclamations to the people engaged in the linen manufac- 
ture, was to the eff"ect that, "any farmer, weaver, or linen draper, 
who manufactured flax fibre by any other mode than that which 
he prescribed, should be punished by the severest penalties the law 
could inflict." In the carrying out of that most despotic order, the 
grossest outrages were committed by the Government agents.
The 
poor people complained that they were commanded to work the 
flax into yarn and cloth by ways in which they were unskilled, and 
yet every case that could be discovered, where the arbitrary law 
had not been kept to the letter, was punished by forfeiture, fines, 
and imprisonment.
After the accession of Charles II., a more prudent system of 
patronage was bestowed on the linen manufacturer.
Premiums 
were offered for the finest webs.
Every six months exhibitions 
were got up, and the sum of ;^io awarded to the producer of the 
best cloth, £,6 for the second, and £^ for the third.
At that 
period the total value of all linens exported from Ireland only 
amounted to ^^ 10,000, while the exports of woollen goods amounted 
to ;^ 1 10,000 annually.
The creation of the Board of Trustees in 1 7 1 1 formed an 
important landmark in the history of the linen trade in Ireland.
Whatever opinions may be entertained at the present day regarding 
the wisdom of granting subsidies, or State aid, towards developing 
industrial operations, it will scarcely be denied that at this particular 
period in the history of the linen manufacture, the fostering care 
of the State was a wise and judicious measure.
In about sixty years, 
the Board had distributed over a million and a quarter sterUng ; 
and about 1777 they were disbursing some ;^33,ooo per annum.
Thus by monetary assistance to men of ability who required capital 
to carry on their business, Irish linen soon equalled that produced 
on the continent.
And before the Board passed out of existence, 
the linen trade of Ireland had been brought to such an important 
275 
position, that the linen fabrics of that country were fast displacing 
all others in the markets of the world.
Another very important power vested in this Board related to 
the appointment of persons to examine all cloth before being 
offered for sale; to measure each web, and to stamp it with a 
seal.
A penalty of ^5 was inflicted for selling unsealed linen.
At first the Act met with violent opposition on the part of the 
weavers.
Mobs assembled, and various outrages were committed, 
in order to force drapers and others not to recognize the sealing of 
the goods.
This was a foolish opposition on the part of the 
weavers, against regulations which were intended for their own 
protection.
Before the appointment of Seal Masters by the Board 
of Trustees, the weavers were entirely at the mercy of the buyers, 
many of whom used no just standard of measurement.
Very often 
when a proper yard-stick was not at hand, they would cut a stick 
out of the nearest hedge, which was often an inch or two longer 
than the statute measure.
In measuring, also, it was stated that 
by sleight of hand they could often take from half to a whole yard 
above the just measure.
The export and home trades were at this time injured very 
much by the weavers making up inferior linen with a good outside 
look ; often too short in measure, and damaged throughout.
They 
were thus ruining the trade.
The Board now appointed Juries to 
examine the cloth, which was reported to be unmerchantable, 
although passed by some of the Seal Masters, who took bribes, and 
became parties to a general system of fraud.
On the i6th March, 
1784, the Juries condemned three hundred and forty-three pieces 
as tender and unmerchantable.
Each piece was ordered to be cut, 
to prevent its being exported.
The Seal Masters who passed these 
damaged goods were heavily fined.
The precautions thus taken 
to prevent the exportation of bad cloth were wise and judicious, 
and did much towards maintaining the first class reputation which 
Irish linens had enjoyed in the markets of the world.
It was high 
time that strong measures were adopted to save the trade.
The 
exports had fallen off one-fourth in two years.
The consequence 
was, that three-fourths, and in some places more than this propor- 
tion, of the looms throughout the north were silent.
276 
Political agitation, too, had a very prejudicial effect.
The 
country had no doubt been sadly misgoverned, and the people had 
much to complain of.
But the means they took to redress their 
grievances brought great misery upon themselves, and was ruinous 
to the trade of the country.
When the Irish volunteers marched 
to their famous meeting at the Rotunda, it is stated that 
becoming somewhat profane, they decorated the muzzles of the 
guns accompanying the procession with the motto, " O Lord, open 
thou our lips, and our mouths shall show forth thy praise." This 
agitation culminated in the battle of Ballynahinch, where the poor 
Irish were scattered like sheep before the regular troops sent to 
oppose them.
Monroe, the commanding officer of the rebels, was 
betrayed in his hiding place, and shortly after tried, condemned, 
and hung.
This was followed by the rising of 1798.
After this 
was suppressed, the country became more peaceful.
Needful 
reforms were introduced, and trade revived.
With the introduction of machinery in the first quarter of this 
century, Ireland has progressed with rapid strides, and she now 
stands at the head of the linen trade of the world.
The Messrs.
Mulholland, of Belfast, commenced mill spinning in 1830.
Their 
large mill contained 20,000 spindles.
Since then some of the 
factories contain as many as 60,000 spindles, capable of turning 
off upwards of twenty-five million yards of yarn per day.
Wages 
in the meantime have gone up from one hundred to two hundred 
per cent, and the population of Belfast has increased from 50,000 
to 175,000 in 1871.
A very few words only must be added on the linen trade of 
Scotland.
The Messrs.
Baxter, of Dundee, have done for that 
town and district, what the Mulhollands did for Belfast, and the 
Marshalls for Leeds, in making those towns the great linen 
producing districts of the world.
The consumption of flax and 
hemp in Dundee at the present time is about 70,000 tons per 
annum, and the value about two and a half millions sterling.
The 
value of the yarn spun amounts to about three and three-quarter 
millions.
And the total value of linen and hemp fabrics produced 
in Dundee is about five millions sterling.
The population exceeds 
100,000, and half of the inhabitants are employed in the staple 
trade of the town.
I will only add one interesting item in connection with the 
Scotch linen trade, and then conclude this paper with a few 
practical remarks.
In 1760, David Sands of Kerriemure, a famous 
weaver, invented a mode of weaving double cloth.
He wove and 
finished shirts without seam, in the loom.
Not only did he weave 
the cloth, but he hemmed and stitched them, wrought button-holes, 
put on buttons, and also put ruffles on the breast, in the loom.
These wonderful productions were exhibited among his acquaint- 
ances.
One was sent to the King, one to the Duke of Athol, and 
one to the Board of Trustees.
Their ingenious maker died shortly 
after having accomplished this extraordinary work, poor in purse, 
but rich in local fame.
This wonderful art was lost with the death 
of the inventor, and has not since been re-discovered, so that the 
ancient weaver still bears the palm in this respect.
These shirts 
would resemble the Messianic garment, which was wove without 
seam from top to bottom.
The very few practical remarks with which I conclude this 
paper, will relate to the impolicy of high protective duties on 
home-made fabrics.
Of this we have a striking example in France.
Before the year 1842, one-third of the imports into France consisted 
of linens and linen yarns, the latter chiefly from Ireland.
In that 
year, and in 1845, the French Government, to encourage their 
own manufacture, imposed heavy duties on imported yarn and 
cloth.
The consequence was, that the trade with France in this 
article was suddenly stopped, or nearly so.
Another consequence 
followed injurious to France, but highly beneficial to England and 
Ireland, for France lost a great part of her foreign trade in linen 
cloth.
This trade now passed into the hands of the English and 
Irish spinners, who instead of exporting their yarns, bleached, 
wove, and made them ready for the markets which France used to 
supply.
The French Government has seen the impolicy of their 
restrictive measures on the trade, and in their Commercial Treaty 
with England in i860, they adopted a more liberal tariff, — since 
which the doctrine of Protection has gradually lost ground, not 
278 
only in France, but also in Italy, Spain, and Austria.
In Germany 
Protection is now in the ascendant.
Since the last and still more 
liberal French tariff in 1874, the imports and exports into France 
have increased two-fold, in each of the three great manufacturing 
industries — woollen, cotton, and linen.
Indeed, the increased 
trade in France after the liberal tariff in i860, is said to have been 
the chief cause why France bore so well the strain of the terrible 
Franco-Prussian war.
France committed the same error on other articles of produce, 
such as sugar, for example.
They are now paying about two 
millions of money in the shape of bounties on exporting sugar, the 
consequence of which is, that their heavily taxed people are still 
more heavily taxed for the benefit of a few sugar refiners, who can 
now afford to send their sugar to this country at cost price, their 
profit being the bounty money they receive on their exports.
We 
get the benefit in having refined sugars cheaper than we otherwise 
could have ; the French nation, and a few of our sugar refiners, 
being the sufferers.
This, however, is an error to which the 
French Government is about to apply a remedy.
The prosperity of the linen trade in the future seems to depend 
to some extent on the supply of raw material.
Ireland is the great 
flax-producing country for the United Kingdom.
Last year there 
were 132,000 acres of land under the flax crop in Ireland, whilst 
twelve years ago there were nearly three times as many ; so that 
large spinners have become apprehensive of a short supply of 
material for linen manufacture, and the committee of the Flax 
Association in Belfast for promoting the growth of flax, has been 
turning its attention to India and the colonies as future flax- 
producing countries.
Another word in conclusion.
With plenty of raw materialj 
and hands to work it, there would appear to be no limit to the 
future extension of the linen trade.
When the millions of bare 
backs in Africa, and half-clad ones in Central Asia, are clothed in 
linen — being the most suitable clothing for the climates in which 
they live — the linen industries will be found to have gone oti 
growing and increasing.

ENGLISH MUSIC.
By J.
MAC QUEEN.
(Read at Whitehaven.) 
I shall endeavour to-night to give you a brief sketch of the 
progress of English Music from the earliest times, and to show that 
at no period could England be truly called an unmusical nation.
We are not now what we should be.
Our choirs and choral 
societies depend upon the few instead of the many ; and it was 
the hope that I might call your attention to our vast and beautiful 
stores of native music, and lead you to encourage the practice of 
it, which induced me to undertake a task for which I felt I was but 
feebly prepared.
The field of English Music is too wide to be travelled over in 
one evening, and I shall therefore confine my attention mainly to 
one corner of it, but a very interesting and productive one — that 
of the Secular Vocal Music.
Our Cathedral Music is, I believe, 
unequalled by that of any other nation, whether we regard skill of 
construction, or devotional spirit and feeling.
In all other depart- 
ments of musical composition, England may hold up her head 
without a blush ; and the more we become intimate with the works 
of our national composers, the greater will be our wonder and 
regret that they are not better known.
Do not be alarmed if I take you back nearly two thousand 
years, when our land was a wild waste wood and swamp alternating, 
the inhabitants, for the most part, wild barbarians, eking out as 
they best could a precarious existence.
We shall not tarry long 
among them ; our school-days have told us enough about those 
280 
dreadful old British Bards, with their wicker cages and human 
victims.
All that I wish to point out, is the supreme influence 
which they possessed over the people.
Barbarians, as the Britons 
were, the influence of music upon them was great.
The love of 
music is a natural instinct ; and no tribe, however rude, is destitute 
of music.
They hear it in the winds and waters, in the woods 
and plains, and kindred chords vibrate within them, which must 
perforce find expression in voice or instrument.
These Bards, like the Scalds, " or polishers of language " of 
the Danish tribes, were not only the poets and musicians of the 
period, but the moralisers and theologians : their duty was not 
only to amuse, but to instruct.
What their music was we cannot 
tell ; rude, no doubt, but scarcely ruder than their audience.
Whatever it was, it helped to nerve the courage of their warriors, 
and aided them in a long and stubborn conflict with the rulers of 
the world.
Leaving them, we will travel onward nearly eight hundred 
years, to the period of the Heptarchy, when Britain became 
England, and when our history as a nation really begins.
All the Teutonic nations — whether Angles, Saxons, Danes, or 
Norse — were eminently musical.
The music of the battle-field, 
and that of the feast, were equally dear to them ; and their 
monarchs patronized it after a very royal fashion.
With these 
Teuton tribes came the Minstrels, or Gleemen, who composed and 
sang to the music of the harp effusions recounting the valiant 
deeds of their heroes.
Differing from the British Bard and the 
Danish Scald, their only aim was to divert and entertain ; and their 
ministrelsy was often accompanied with mimicry and feats of 
strength, or sleight of hand.
No feast was complete without their 
presence ; they were ever welcomed in cottage or palace, and 
rarely left without a handsome reward.
As long as the old 
spirit of chivalry remained, their popularity continued ; but at the 
close of Queen Elizabeth's reign, they had fallen so low in public 
estimation, that a Statute included them among "the rogues, 
vagabonds, and sturdy beggars," and dealt with them accordingly.
This woeful falling off in popularity, was owing, no doubt, partly 
281 
to the improved taste of the people, and partly to the natural 
tendency of the minstrel to get coarser in his poetry, and more 
personal in his mimicry.
At the time of their invasion of Britain, these tribes were 
heathens; but about one hundred and fifty years after, their 
conversion was begun by Gregory, then Bishop of Rome, a 
skilful musician, who arranged and improved the ancient music, 
still called from him "Gregorian." This music was introduced 
into Europe from Antioch in Syria, about A.D. 380, and many 
regard it as the remains of the music used in the Temple at 
Jerusalem.
Gregory knew well the effect of music on these sturdy 
Northmen, and sent over a well-trained choir with his missionary, 
Augustine.
We have an account of his first meeting with 
Ethelbert, King of Kent : — " First appeared a verger bearing a 
silver cross; then came Augustine, followed by a monk with a 
l^ainting representing the figure of our Lord, the brethren 
following in procession ; then under an oak was discovered Ethel- 
bert, his army and wise men all around him.
Then the choir 
began chanting in unison one of those deeply solemn litanies, 
heard for the first time in our country." No doubt the im- 
pression of the music on these heathen warriors would be deep and 
lasting ; for with a full choir of male voices, the " Gregorians " 
are very effective.
Many years' practice of them failed, however, to 
make me a convert to pure Gregorianism.
This music, and indeed all the music down to the end of the 
15th century, was written without bars; and hundreds of volumes 
contained neither fiat nor sharp.
Let us hope that the performers 
instinctively supplied them where required !
The Gregorian, or tuneless, and the Minstrel music, were both 
encouraged and cultivated by the monks, who, with all their short- 
comings, were the great benefactors of their day.
Many went to 
Rome to qualify themselves as musical instructors ; and Italian 
musicians often came to live in England, acting as teachers of 
music, and organisers of choirs.
From all we can learn, the 
practice of music was nearly universal in England.
Bede, the 
venerable monk and historian of his times, relates an incident in 
282 
the life of our earliest English poet, Ccedman, and nothing could 
better show the state of the musical education of the time.
The 
poet, deeply engaged in other studies, had neglected his musical 
practice, and being in company, where, as usual, the harp was 
passed round for each guest to play and sing in turn, he left the 
party, ashamed to appear deficient in what was deemed necessary 
to complete the education of a gentleman.
Adhelm, Abbot of Malmesbury, contemporary with Bede, 
found that the people who attended service, left directly the 
musical portion was finished, without waiting for the "Exhortation" 
— a practice not unknown in our Cathedrals.
So in the guise of a 
minstrel, he took up his post on the bridge, and by playing and 
singing popular poetry, was able to attract their attention, and 
gradually bring them to a better state of mind.
Adhelm might 
have been profitably employed in our own day.
Then we have Dunstan, a very able man, far in advance of 
his times, — a skilful mechanic, an enthusiastic student, and lover 
of music.
He was a builder of organs, and gave instruments to 
various monasteries.
Like many more in the olden time, who rose 
superior to their fellows, he was accused of magic : he had con- 
structed, by the aid of the devil it was affirmed, a harp that not 
only moved automatically, but played without human assistance, 
outdoing the modern contrivances of Maskelyne and Cook !
We all know how Alfred the Great gained admission into the 
Danish Camp under the guise of a harper.
Fifty years later, a 
Danish warrior returned the compliment, and visited the camp of 
Athelstan.
He was heartily welcomed ; and after entertaining 
them with his minstrel arts, left the camp with a liberal reward for 
his music.
No sooner had he quitted the lines, than with a 
warrior's disdain of pelf, or with a consciousness of having obtained 
the meed under false pretences, he threw away the money.
One of 
Athelstan's warriors witnessed the act, and perhaps the recollection 
of Alfred's expedition aroused their suspicion ; at any rate, they 
took precautions which prevented the Danes from taking advantage 
of the fraud.
It would be easy to multiply examples of this kind, but 
283 
these few will he enough to show how universally music was 
esteemed and practised by our early ancestors.
We will pass on 
to the Norman period.
The Normans, or Northmen, left their dreary home in the 
Vigten Islands, on the Norwegian coast, under Rollo, or Roland, 
in the year 912, and took possession of a part of Northern France, 
Neustria, which they named Normandy.
At the time of their 
invasion of England, one hundred and fifty years after, they had 
adopted the French language, and were the most renowned 
warriors in Europe.
They brought with them the music of the 
Troubadours, or Trouveres (inventors, as we have poets or 
makers).
The home of the Troubadour was in the warmer climes 
of Southern France, but the chill air of the north did not hush their 
harps or voices.
The man who struck the first blow in the battle 
of Hastings, was the minstrel Taillefer, — a warrior of great stature 
and prowess, as well as a skilful harper.
He led the van, recounting 
the deeds of Roland and Charlemagne.
As he neared the foe, he 
threw away his harp, brandished his axe, and rushing into the 
fight — bravely fell.
Every baron in those days had his minstrel, who kept the 
world well informed of the good deeds and qualities of his patron.
We may be sure that a fair share of flattery was well-bestowed and 
amply remunerated.
The characters of these old Norman knights, 
as painted by their minstrels, are far too highly coloured : the 
lights are all there, but the shadows are wanting.
There was now in England another division in the music : — 
I. The music of the court and nobility; 2.
The popular music.
In all high places everything was Norman — the language, the 
laws, and the music.
The English people, however, clung 
tenaciously to their own customs, and not in vain ; for when the 
fusion of the two races became complete (about the time of 
Edward III.) the English language and music came again to the 
front, though both were slightly tinged with Norman.
The Normans introduced the " Cantus mensurabiles" or 
measured music, invented at Cologne shortly before their invasion 
of England.
In this, each note denoted, as now, its duration, 
284 
the semi-breve being the shortest.
At first the breve was the 
shortest note, hence its name ; then came the semi-breve ; then 
followed the minim, or minimum.
In the development of musical 
notes, we moderns have, for the present, arrived at a minimum at 
the quarter demi-semi-quaver ; though Beethoven has actually 
written half-quarter demi-semi-quavers.
In the practice of old 
music it is well to remember this, or by taking it too slowly we 
rob it of all spirit and animation.
From the nth to the 15th century the materials at our 
disposal are but scanty, but we get occasional glimpses of the state 
of musical culture in England.
The Norman monarchs encouraged 
it; William I.
assigned broad lands in Gloucestershire to his 
minstrel ; and Matilda, the English queen of Henry I., screwed 
more than her due share of rents from her tenants in order to pay 
for her music.
The same patronage was bestowed by the 
Plantagenet monarchs.
Richard Cojur de Lion, a distinguished 
patron of minstrelsy, was both poet and musician — a type of 
the true minstrel.
A few of his poems are still extant, among 
them, the one by which the minstrel Blondel is recorded to have 
discovered his captive master.
In Edward I.'s time, a raid was 
made against the Welsh Bards, who, like the Druids, stirred up 
the people to repel the invasion of their country.
Henry IV.
imitated Edward's example, but the Welsh Bards still remained, for 
as late as Queen Elizabeth's reign, we find that they were wont to 
assemble the people on the mountain sides, and there relate the 
heroic deeds of their ancestors.
The Welsh still hold their 
own, and are making praiseworthy efforts to encourage the 
practice of their national music.
We need mention no more 
examples of royal patronage ; we find that our line of kings, from 
Alfred downwards, have Hberally patronized music.
Even the 
dull and heavy Hanoverian, who cordially hated "bainting and 
boetry," had a liking for music; and our present Royal Family 
is distinguished for musical ability.
Turning from the monarchs to the monks, the same love for 
music is apparent.
The monasteries were, as formerly, the homes 
of musical culture, as they were the schools, the studios, the inns, 
285 
and hospitals of their time.
The monks were in duty bound to 
practise the Gregorian music, but, as we might expect, their 
affection was not Hmited to that tuneless variety.
About the year 1200, two itinerant priests knocked for 
admission at the gate of a monastery, and the monks thinking that 
the wanderers would be able to entertain them in the evening with 
minstrel arts, gave them a hearty welcome.
When, however, they 
found that the needy ecclesiastics could at the best only administer 
spiritual consolation, they beat them and turned them out.
Knowing as we do the character of the monks for hospitality, there 
is little doubt that these two misguided wayfarers paid the penalty 
of neglecting an important part of their education.
We can have, perhaps, no better proof of the estimation in 
which music was held in the middle ages, than the price paid for 
its performance.
When Henry V.
went to France, fifteen minstrels 
accompanied him : the pay of each being i2d.
per day.
Now 
this 1 2d.
would represent twelve to fifteen shillings of our money.
Even at the end of the Plantagenet period, a fat goose could be 
bought for fourpence ; a fat sheep for one shilling and fourpence ; 
an ox for twelve shillings; and one hundred eggs cost only sixpence.
On his return from France, after the glorious victory of Agincourt, 
Henry made a triumphal entry into London, but would allow no 
music to be used, — perhaps he had seen a copy of the words, 
highly spiced as it would be with flattery, or, let us hope that the 
omission was prompted by the humility of a true hero.
In the next reign (Henry VI.), at the Feast of the Holy Cross 
at Abingdon, twelve priests received fourpence each, while the 
twelve minstrels had each (with diet and horse-meat) two shillings 
and fourpence, — a very marked difference.
About ten years later, 
eight priests and half-a-dozen minstrels were hired from Coventry, 
and here we find that people then, as now, were willing to pay a 
good price for their amusement, for the priest got a net two 
shillings, while the minstrel was paid four shillings, and was 
bountifully entertained in the " Camera picta." Not a bad night's 
work for a minstrel !
286 
It is interesting to observe, that in nearly all the instances 
recorded of eminent minstrels, they were of the "north countree." 
The Border land was then one constant scene of warfare, and the 
minstrel played well his part in fanning the martial flame.
Far 
removed from the culture and refinement of the court, the minstrel, 
like many a time-honoured custom, found in the north a fitting 
home, when elsewhere he was neglected and despised.
These few 
examples will be enough to shew that music was largely cultivated 
and highly esteemed in England.
The other nations of Europe 
were not behind our own in this respect, and especially the 
Flemings, from whom Italy received its first great musical impulse.
A French proverb of the time briefly describes the vocal 
peculiarities of the leading nations : — 
The French pipe, or sing (cantaut.) 
The English carol (jubilant.) 
The Spaniards wail (plangunt.) 
The Germans howl (idulant.) 
The Italians quaver, as a goat (caprizant.) 
As might be expected, very little of the actual notation of our 
early English music has come down to us, except the Gregorian.
Printing was not invented till 1449, and its influence was not felt 
to any great extent till after the Wars of the Roses.
The earUest 
part-song extant owes its preservation to the fact of its having been 
adapted to the words of a Latin hymn.
It is a Canon for four 
equal voices, composed about the year 1250, and is entitled : — 
" Summer is a comynge on, 
Loud sing cuckoo." 
The theme is a very appropriate one after our long winter ; and it 
will, I am sure, be a relief and pleasure to us all, if our minstrels 
will now give us a musical rendering of it.
We have now arrived at the Tudor Period, when our modern 
history begins.
The cruel wars were over; the influence of 
printing was beginning to be felt; and a new world was opened 
out for English commerce and enterprize.
Under these favourable 
287 
auspices, and with a line of monarchs eminently devoted to music, 
there was a rapid development of music, as of literature, reaching 
its meridian under Queen Elizabeth.
The first Tudor king, Henry VII., though musical, was a 
miser ; and not even music is proof against the blighting influence 
of an undue love of money.
Little was to be expected from him, 
for every available penny went to increase his hoard ; but he left 
his heir with a thorough musical education, and ample means of 
displaying his musical tastes, and right royally he dispensed both 
money and music.
The musical establishment of the Chapel 
Royal, founded by Edward IV., now comprised one hundred and 
fourteen persons, and cost ^^2,000 a year.
Henry was himself 
both poet and musical composer; and a fine old Anthem of his — 
" O Lord, the Maker of all things "—is still occasionally heard in 
our Cathedrals, being included in Dr. Boyce's collection.
Heniy placed his son Edward under the care of Tye, a noted 
organist and composer ; and the young prince was fond of dis- 
playing the musical skill he had acquired.
In a play by Rowley, 
there is a dialogue between prince Edward and Dr. Tye, in which 
Edward says : — 
" I oft have heard my father merrily speak 
In your high praise, and thus his highness saith : 
' England one God, one truth, one doctor hath 
For musicke's art, and that is Dr. Tye.
' " 
One or two other composers deserve mention.
Marbeck, 
organist of Windsor, was a favourer of the Reformed opinions, 
and an incident in his life shows Henry VIII.'s respect 
for music.
Marbeck, with three companions, was condemned to 
the stake, but for once the love of music overcame the promptings 
of the despot in those dark days of tyranny, for with the remark, 
" Poor Marbeck !
it would be well for thine accusers if they 
employed their time no worse !
" — he reprieved him.
I regret to 
add that his companions did not share in his good fortune, but were 
ruthlessly burnt.
Marbeck lived to see the Reformation established, 
and published "The Book of Common Prayer, noted," besides 
other works on religious history and controversy.
Another famous composer, who devoted his talents entirely to 
Cathedral music, of which he has been called the patriarch, was 
Thomas Tallis, organist to Henry VIII., Edward VI., Mary, and 
Elizabeth.
Some of his music is to be found in Boyce's collection, 
and his " Responses," for which he was much indebted to 
Marbeck, are still commonly used.
In those days every one who moved in polite society, even 
though a prince, was expected to be able to take a part in a 
motett, or madrigal ; if he could not, he probably felt as greatly 
ashamed as our old poet Coedmon, nearly i,ooo years before.
Indeed, we have instances recorded, and I hope that ere long 
history will again repeat itself.
In a humorous court-play performed at the court of Henry 
VIII., the country hero thus quaintly implores instruction in the 
coveted art : — 
' ' Wolde to Heav'n it would please you some day, 
A Ballad Boke before me for to lay.
And lerne me for to synge re, mi, fa, sol, 
And, when I fail, bobbe me on the noil.
" 
We need not dwell on Mary's reign : she kept up the royal 
musical establishments ; but the constant demands made upon her 
purse by her husband, Phihp, prevented her from patronizing 
music as her father had done.
She was fond of music, and played 
well ; let us hope that her many melancholy days were relieved by 
the voice of harmony.
Before entering on the Elizabethan period, our musical 
illustrators will give us " The Spanish Lady," written at this time, 
and founcJed on an incident in the Spanish wars.
We now come to the Elizabethan period, where the difficulty 
lies in selection.
Music, like literature, was at its zenith.
What 
Shakespeare, Spenser, and Ben Jonson were to literature, Tye, 
TalHs, Farrant, Byrd, Morley, Gibbons, and others were to music.
To them we are indebted for a collection of musical compositions 
of every variety that has never been excelled, if equalled, by any 
nation upon earth.
Italy, through Palestrina, Festa, and others 
was pouring forth a flood of compositions, but our native pro- 
289 
diictions will be a favourable comparison with the best of them.
In the brief glance we shall take of the growth of our modern 
music, it will be convenient to make three divisions : — 
1. The Madrigal period.
2. The Ballad period.
3. The Opera and Glee period.
As to the Madrigal, it is not easy to give a good definition of 
it; and the derivation of the word has been hotly contested.
The 
most probable is " Alia Madre" the first line of hymns addressed 
to the Virgin Mary, but afterwards to the ^' Madre galante" or 
Queen of Love.
The name at first applied to the words would be 
easily transferred to the music.
This form of composition was in- 
vented by the Flemings in the middle of the 14th century, and was 
adopted and perfected by the Italians and English.
It was composed 
for three or more voices, often five, and usually consists of a simple 
melody, broadly harmonized; but there are many varieties, varying 
from the style of the motett to that of the more modern glee.
I can give you a definition or description, by Thomas Morley, 
an eminent composer of them.
" No point is to be long stayed 
upon, but once or twice driven through all the parts, and sometimes 
inverted, and so to the close, and then taking another.
And that 
kind of handhng of points is most esteemed when two parts go one 
way and two another, and mostly in loths and 3rds.
Likewise 
the more variety of points be showed, the more the Madrigal is 
esteemed; and, withal, you must bring in fine bindings (i.
e. 
syncopations), and strange closes, as yonr ditty shall move you." 
Taking it for granted that you now have a clear notion of what 
a Madrigal is, we will take as a specimen a very simple but 
beautiful one by Edvvardes, " In going to my lonely bed." The 
Madrigals which I have selected belong to the later period, when 
they were gradually merging into the glee : the earlier ones are far 
more elaborate, constructed on the strictest principles of harmony, 
with skilful embellishments of counter-point.
Many differ little 
from the Motett.
The best Madrigals were composed during the reign of 
Elizabeth.
Between 1594 and 1599 — only five years — books of 
20 
290 
Madrigals were composed and published by Morley, Weelkes, 
Wilbye, Benet, Ward, and Orlando Gibbons ; other writers were 
Byrd, Dowland, Ford, and Edwardes.
One collection, styled the 
" Triumphs of Oriana," is interesting from the fact that John Milton, 
the father of the poet, was a contributor.
One or two of these composers deserve more than a passing 
notice.
Wm. Byrd, after being a chorister at St. Paul's Cathedral, 
and pupil of Tallis, was appointed organist of Lincoln Cathedral 
in 1554.
A few years after he became one of the Gentlemen of 
the Chapel Royal, the duty being to play the organ in turn, and on 
other days to help the choir.
Byrd and Tallis received from 
Queen Elizabeth a patent, conferring a monopoly of printing 
music and selling ruled paper.
Many volumes issued from their 
press.
This practice of granting monopolies was very common, 
and afforded the parsimonious Queen a ready way of rewarding 
a favourite courtier or meritorious person ; but the effect was to 
more than double the price of every article in common use.
Byrd 
held his monopoly till his death.
As a composer he had great 
merits; and his anthems breathe the spirit of devotion.
I know 
of none finer than one commencing " Bow thine ear, O Lord." 
He wrote many Motetts and Madrigals,and contributed largely to 
Queen Elizabeth's Virginal Book, now in the British Museum, 
while his famous Canon, ' ' Non Nobis Domine" will, for ages, 
keep his memory fresh.
The next who claims our attention is Thomas Morley, the 
pupil of Byrd.
Morley was the first author of a regular treatise on 
music, entitled, '^'' Flame and easy introduction to practical music,' 
which continued in use for one hundred and fifty years, and is still 
perused with interest and advantage by the musical student.
He 
wrote five tunes for the Virginal Book, and composed a great 
number of Madrigals, among which are — " April is my mistress' 
face ;" " Fire, fire my heart ; " " Now is the month of Maying." 
The latest of the pure Madrigal writers, and perhaps our 
greatest composer before Purcell, was Orlando Gibbons.
For 
richness and purity of harmony, as well as for scientific skill and 
effect, he is beyond all praise.
At the age of twenty-three he 
became organist of the Chapel Royal, where h?
composed those 
291 
beautiful anthems and services still heard with pleasure in our 
Cathedrals.
On the recommendation of his friend, the learned 
Camden, the Oxford university conferred upon him a Doctor's 
degree.
He composed the music for the marriage of Charles I.
and Henrietta Maria of France, but during his official attendance 
at that ceremony, took small-pox, to which he fell a victim.
Of his many Madrigals, we may name : — "Dainty Sweet Bird;" 
"The Silver Swan;" "O that the learned poets." We must not 
dwell longer on the Madrigal period.
No music is better calculated 
to improve the performer, or give pleasure to the audience ; and it 
has always seemed to me a great pity that these fine old Madrigals 
lie so neglected.
We have had a long ' '  Italian craze" and while 
we have been looking abroad for our musical delights, we have 
overlooked the treasures which lie at our feet.
Fashion has a good 
deal to do with this, and as an illustration, I will give you an 
anecdote recorded of Malibran, the great prima donna.
Malibran was once at a party where a discussion arose as to 
the merits of English music.
The greater part of those present 
declared that none but foreign music was good, whilst Malibran 
maintained that no foreign music could exceed in beauty many of 
the Scotch, Irish, Welsh, and English airs — but without convincing 
her hearers.
Later in the evening she volunteered a new Spanish 
ballad, and after a light prelude, commenced, adagio : — 
" Maria traj^ga un caldero, 
De aqua Llama levante, 
Maria pon tu caldero 
Ayamos nues*ro te." 
She finished — of course the plauditsresounded — forwith her glorious 
voice even the multiplication table would have been delightful, and 
the air was triumphantly quoted as a fresh instance of the beauty 
and superiority of foreign productions.
Malibran then offered to 
repeat it, with an English version of the words, and in quickened 
time produced, to their utter consternation, " Polly put the kettle 
on." As Mark Twain would add — there's a moral in that.
One word before we quit the Madrigal.
Instrumental accom- 
paniments are ina,dmissible except as a help to weak and unsteady 
292 
performers, and then the instrument should be lightly touched.
There was once a dog who grew weaker and weaker every day, till 
at length he was forced to lean against a wall before he could 
bark.
Well, the accompaniment is the wall : we all need our wall 
at times.
Our farewell specimen of the Madrigal will be one by 
Ford, " Since first I saw your face." 
During the earlier Stuart reigns music continued to flourish.
The first Stuart king, " the wisest fool in Christendom," inherited 
a share ot the musical talent of his unfortunate but accomplished 
mother, Mary, Queen of Scots.
Charles I.
was a great patron of 
music, and played well on the bass viol.
One of his intimate 
friends was William Lawes, a composer of merit, who fell in the 
civil war, when the only arts in fashion were those of cant and of 
killing.
Music in public was forbidden ; organs v/ere demolished ; 
organists and choirs turned adrift.
In Divine Service only unison 
singing was permitted — " the minister or other fit person was to 
read the psalm line by line, before the singing thereof;" and in New 
England, for more than one hundred years, they only allowed five 
lines.
But even in these perilous times tlie voice of music, though 
subdued, was not entirely hushed.
Music was diligently practised 
in private, and the compositions of Henry Lawes, a brother of 
William, were highly esteemed.
Milton has immortalized him in 
a fine sonnet.
Cromwell himself gave concerts in his own house, 
and paid ^loo a year for the musical education of his daughter.
Milton was an enthusiast in music, and none but a well-attuned 
ear could have poured forth the flood of harmony m prose and 
verse which he did.
His father, as we have seen, was a composer 
of madrigals, and young Milton, almost from infancy, was able to 
read music.
As he grew older, he became an accomplished 
player on the organ, and that instrument was one of his greatest 
delights when "Nature at one entrance" was "quite shut out." 
We now take the Ballad period, one of the most interesting — 
for the Ballad appeals to every ear and heart.
We will begin with 
a specimen in which the "trimmer" so common in those days, is 
well pourtrayed — " The Vicar of Bray." It is familiar to us all, but 
293 
will bear repetition.
[The song was then sung as an example of 
Ballad music] 
The music of a nation, and especially its ballads, is a reflex 
of the character of its people, and is modified not only by 
peculiarities of race, but by the climate and physical features of the 
country.
Through the melodies of the northern nations, the home 
of storm and cold, there breathes an air of plaintiveness.
Take up 
a collection of English, Scotch, Welsh, or Irish airs,-how many 
iiave a pathetic, almost wailing tone, like the echo of the moaning 
wind, though now and then, of course, we come upon a stirring 
martial song, or one brimful of humour.
In the warmer vine-clad 
regions of southern Europe, a spirit of gaiety pervades the music, 
and song and dance go hand-in-hand.
With the Restoration the old ballads came in again in all 
their freshness, for the "merry monarch" could not bear music 
that he could not beat time to.
The pure-voiced madrigal 
was heard but rarely, for it could not live in the murky atmosphere 
of vice and revelry which surrounded the Court.
Many of the old ballads had doubtless perished, for it was not 
till the reign of Elizabeth that the practice of collecting them into 
a book began.
Prior to that time they were written or printed on 
loose sheets, which were often found pasted on the walls of 
the cottage.
What with the turbulence of the times, and the 
domestic condition of the lower classes, there is little wonder that 
so few have been spared.
There is no doubt that among other 
uses, they helped to mitigate the harsh manners of the middle 
ages, while, in more modern times, their influence has often been 
remarkable.
With "LiUibullero," a few trivial verses adapted to 
an old Irish air, Wharton boasted that he had sung King James 
out of the kingdom.
As intellectual culture advanced, the rude ballads lost their 
attraction, and became mere objects of curiosity— relics of tlie 
past— showing the manners and modes of thought which prevailed 
in bygone ages.
As such they were collected by poetical and 
musical antiquaries, and many were published by the ballad- 
mongers in penny books called " Garlands." As examples of the 
294 
traditional ballad may be mentioned — " The Bailiff's Daughter of 
Islington," " Barbara Allen," " Early one Morning," " Sally in our 
Alley," " There was a Jolly Miller," and " The Three Ravens." 
No date can be assigned to these ; they have been borne to our 
own day on the breath of many a generation, and their merit is 
proved by their vitality.
When once we know a ballad, it becomes as it were a part of 
our existence, an inheritance of which we cannot be deprived.
Oliver Goldsmith, a man of musical taste, who worked his way in 
France by means of his flute, says : — " The music of the finest 
masters was but as dissonance to what I felt when our old dairy- 
maid sang me into tears with ' Johnny Armstrong's Good-night,' 
or the cruelty of Barbara Allen." 
We onlyjneed to name Shakspeare to recall a host of fragments 
of ballads, and trivial as many of the words are, they have engaged 
the attention of our best composers.
To take one example in the 
" Winter's Tale." Autolycus, a rogue, who among other wares 
traded in ballads, meets a clown and two shepherdesses, Mopsa 
and Dorcas.
Mopsa begs the clown to buy some ballads.
"I love a ballad in print o' life," 
she says ; and then adds with Arcadian simplicity, 
"For then we are sure they are true." 
After one or two have been selected, Autolycus produces another, 
adding, 
"This is a passing merry one, and goes to the tune of 'Two Maids 
Wooing a Man ' : there's scarce a maid westward but she sings it." 
Mopsa : "We can both sing it : if thou'lt bear a part thou shalt hear : 
'tis in three parts." 
Dorcas : " We had the tune on't a month ago." 
Autolycus : "I can bear my part you must know, it is my occupation; 
have at it with you.
" 
And then they "have at it," no doubt to their great gratification.
Leaving the time of Shakspeare, when we were indeed a musical 
nation, and reverting to the period of the Restoration, we meet 
with Tom D'Urfey, a great favourite of Charles II.
The king 
would often lean on his shoulder, and the pair would hum together 
the favourite ballads of the hour.
His book, now scarce, is 
entitled, " Wit and Mirth, or Pills to purge Melancholy : being a 
coUeflion' of the bed merry ballads and fongs new and old, fitted 
to all humours, having each their proper time for either the voice 
or the inflrument." D'Urfey was a man of no mean ability, a poet 
and musician, and a very convivial companion : he lived on till 
1719, and died poor and forgotten.
Like the dramas and ballads 
of the time, his work is disfigured by the then prevailing immorality.
D'Urfey wrote new words to many old tunes, very often in 
the Scottish dialect.
And here we may notice that the Scotch 
poets have for the most part composed their verses for old tunes, 
Scotch or English, and wisely, too, for they leave them in the best 
of company, and with every prospect of a very prolonged life.
But 
by doing this they have levied black-mail on our English melodies, 
and carried them bodily over the border.
Take for instance, "Ye 
banks and braes," written by Burns to an old English tune, "Lost 
is my quiet"; "Jock o' Hazeldean," by Sir W.
Scott, to another 
English tune, "In January last." The tune to "Auld Robin Grey" 
was written by an English clergyman, the Rev. William Leeves.
Many have had their words Scotticized, as, " Oh, Nancy, will you 
go with me," which is improved in the new version.
The tune 
was written by Thomas Carter, an organist, and so skilful a player 
on the harpsichord, that he could readily and correctly play any 
piece of music placed upside down before him.
In later times, the practice of imitating Scotch verses was 
renewed ; tunes were composed for these dialect verses, and many 
of these have come to be regarded as Scotch.
"The Blue-bells of 
Scotland" is by Mrs. Jordan, a noted actress ; " Within a mile of 
Edinboro' town," by James Hook, an able musician, and father of 
the witty Theodore Hook.
He composed also the tune to the 
"Lass of Richmond Hill." I feel that I am treading on delicate 
ground, but if it can be proved in open court, that the tunes afore- 
said, and others, are of English birth, the Scotch, who have an 
abundance of unrivalled melodies of their own, will willingly give 
up their claim to the few that have straggled over the border.
But 
296 
we will now sing one which our northern neighbours have not 
appropriated, " The Bailiff's Daughter of Islington.
" 
In conclusion, it may be well to notice the instruments for 
which music was composed at this time : they were th'e lute, the 
virginals, the spinet, and the harpsichord.
The last three were 
constructed on the principle of the piano, but all were inferior to 
it.
It was impossible on either of them to obtain gradations of 
tone, piano or forte, or a sustained note.
The harpsichord had 
two strings to each note, the spinet, a weaker brother, had but one.
Dr. Burney describes the note as a scratch, with a sound at the 
end of it ; the scratch being produced by a quill which struck the 
wire.
We have in the British Museum the Virginal Book of Queen 
Elizabeth : the music written by the best composers of her time, 
is not at all easy of execution : many pieces would tax the skill of 
good modem players.
Indeed, it must have required marvellous 
dexterity in those days, for in their method of fingering, the use of 
the thumb and the little finger of each hand was strictly forbidden, 
and this restriction remained till 1718, when Purcell, Bach, and 
others introduced the modern fingering.
Time will not permit us "to enter upon the next period, when 
Purcell, Dr. Arne, Dibdin, Shield, and a host of other composers, 
ably sustained the reputation of English music ; but in order to 
leave a vocal impression, after our mention of the musical instru- 
ments, we will trespass over the boundary, and take two examples 
of the Glee.
[ " O happy fair," by Shield, and " Hark !
the lark," 
by Dr. Cooke, were sung by a choir consisting of Mrs. Russell, the 
Misses Knowles, Parker, and Barnish ; and Messrs.
W. Mc.Gowan, 
and Feldtmann, who as a choir, or individually, also sang the 
previous illustrations.]

THE HON.
CHARLES RADCLIFFE, 
AND HIS CONNECTION WITH THE REBELLIONS 
OF 17 15 AND 1745.
By J.
F. CROSTHWAITE.
(Read at Keswick.) 
In selecting a subject for a paper on the present occasion, I 
have been led to take up the story of the unfortunate Charles 
Radcliffe, chiefly because of his connection with the Vale of 
Derwentwater.
I think it should be an object with a society like 
this, to rescue from oblivion the memory of any who have been 
conspicuous, and who have played a part in the great drama of life, 
whether they have been fortunate or unfortunate.
Few men are 
born to be truly great, and those few have many admirers, and 
command a host of brilliant biographers.
But there are in all 
times men of ordinary ability and sterling integrity, who pass 
through life doing their lesser part, who nevertheless deserve to be 
remembered, and from whose lives the bulk of mankind may 
derive much valuable instruction.
And this may be the case, even 
if the'jndividual has been mistaken, or unfortunate, or, in the eye 
of the law, even criminal.
His life may stand out as a beacon to 
warn the unwary of the rocks upon which he has wrecked his 
fortunes, and wasted what might have been otherwise a noble and 
an honourable career.
It is in this view that I have chosen for my 
motto the words of Pope : 
"the proper study of mankind is man." 
i!9S 
Charles Radcliffe, the youngest son of the Second Earl 
of Derwentwater, and brother of the amiable young nobleman on 
whose melancholy fate I read a paper five years ago, was born in 
England on the 3rd September, 1693.
Of his early life, little more 
is known than what was then incidentally noticed whilst tracing 
the brief career of his noble brother, and the progress of the bold 
enterprise which ended so fatally for the house of Derwentwater.
The chief part of his youth seems to have been spent in 
France.
Of his education, we have very few particulars, but he 
does not seem to have shown any fondness for study.
He was 
brought up in the tenets of the Church of Rome, and became 
attached from his boyhood to the cause of the House of Stuart, 
among whose adherents his warmest friendships were formed.
He 
appears to have continued to reside abroad until a short time 
before the rising in 17 15, when he returned to his parental home 
for the purpose (as he pleaded on his trial,) of visiting his brother 
the Earl ; but, unfortunately for himself, in time to aid in that 
attempt to restore the exiled prince to his throne.
He had then 
completed the twenty -second year of his age.
He was possessed 
of considerable abilities, and many generous and heroic virtues, 
and had given earnest of that daring spirit which so greatly distin- 
guished him in after life.
His character was marked by gallant 
bravery, and he was foremost in every feat of daring.
A writer 
well acquainted with him, records that he was "full of spirit and 
courage, bold and daring, even to rashness, and was generally the 
first to offer himself to go upon the most hazardous enterprises.
He seemed to set no value upon his life where honour was to be 
won, or service to be performed.
This intrepid behaviour, which 
he was forward to manifest upon all occasions, endeared him very 
much to the chiefs of the rebels, and therefore the Earl gave him 
the command of his troop, and Captain Shaftoe commanded under 
him.
Mr. Radcliffe had never been in the army before, and 
consequently knew nothing of military discipline; but what he 
wanted in experience and knowledge he made good in bravery, 
and in animating his men to great exploits." 
The writer of these remarks then describes the gallant young 
29!
I 
leader riding in his scarlet cloak at the head of his troop on their 
rapid journey on the Scottish border, and continues : — " Mr. Rad- 
cliffe, who had never seen much of the world before, fancied 
himself now upon his travels ; and accordingly it was a great part 
of his amusement to make observations on whatever he met with 
that deserved his notice.
At every town he came to he enquired 
what were the most remarkable customs and curiosities of the 
place ; what monuments of famous men, or actions, or other noted 
pieces of antiquity, were remaining among them ; and whatever 
information he could get of this kind he took down in his book.
Nor was he less curious in observing the various tempers and 
passions of men." 
Before we enter upon the part which Charles RadclifFe took 
in the first rebellion, it ought to be mentioned that he and his 
brother being suspected by the Government, a warrant for the 
apprehension of the two brothers was issued by the Ministry of 
George I., expecting thereby to have the first move in the game, 
and so prevent the Earl's influence, which was so much dreaded.
But the Earl had a friendly warning from Whitehall ; and on hearing 
that the Government messengers had arrived at Durham, on their 
way to arrest him and his brother, they withdrew from Dilston and 
went to the house of Sir Marmaduke Constable, where they stayed 
a few days.
The Earl afterwards took refuge in a cottage, and 
continued in concealment through the latter part of August and 
September.
These proceedings were also taken against Mr.
•Forster, who on hearing that a warrant was issued from the Secre- 
tary's ofliice to take him, and finding that he could not hide himself 
long in any place of safety, sent out messengers to his friends, to 
meet him in Northumberland ; where, having met, they came to a 
resolution to muster up all the forces they could, and to appear in 
arms.
Accordingly, notice was given to all their friends to meet 
on the 6th of October at a place called Greenrig ; and about 
twenty gentlemen repaired thither ; they rode to the top of a hill 
called Waterfalls, from whence they soon discovered the Earl oi 
Derwentwater and his brother Charles, with their company, who 
came that morning from the Earl's seat at Dilston.
In coming 
:30U 
from thence, their way lying through the town of Corbridge, they 
all drew their swords, and in that order marched through it.
From 
thence they proceeded to the seat of Mr. Errington, where they 
halted, and the Earl was joined by several other gentlemen, with 
their attendants, and so proceeded in a body to the place appointed, 
where Forster and his party met them.
Their company now con- 
sisted of about sixty horse, most of them gentlemen with their 
attendants.
They marched to Rothbury, and from thence to 
Warkworth, a small town upon the sea coast, their number still 
increasing as they marched.
Here they proclaimed James III., 
which was done by Mr. Forster ; and this was the first place in 
England where the Pretender was proclaimed.
On the loth October they came to Morpeth, where they were 
joined by sixty Scots horse; so that now they were three hundred 
strong.
Here they prepared to march to Newcastle.
The Earl of 
Derwentwater ordered his brother, Mr. Radcliffe, to take a party 
of horse, and to go and seize the post at Felton Bridge, which he 
did, without any loss, for indeed, as yet, nobody opposed them.
However, the rebels were disappointed of their design upon 
Newcastle ; for the townsmen taking alarm, armed, and prepared 
for their defence ; which the rebels being informed of, they turned 
and marched to Hexham, and were joined by some more Scots 
horse.
While at Hexham they had information that General Car- 
penter, at the head of a considerable body, was come out in pursuit 
of them, and was preparing to attack them.
Upon which a council 
of war was held, and Charles Radcliffe proposed to march out and 
fight them, before they had recovered themselves from their long 
marches which they had been obliged to make.
But the other 
leaders did not think this advisable, because most of their men 
were raw and inexperienced, and had never yet faced an enemy, 
whereas the king's forces were disciplined troops, and had a brave 
general at their head ; and therefore, for the present, it was better 
to avoid fighting till they could get such reinforcements as they 
expected daily to join them.
This counsel was taken, and they 
marched forward to meet the forces that were coming to join them 
301 
from Scotland, headed by their leaders, the Lords Kenmuir, Niths- 
dale, Camwarth, and Wintoun, — and were advanced as far as 
Rothbury.
Here the English and the Scotch rebels joined their 
forces and marched directly from thence to Wooller, in Northum- 
berland.
They now adopted the fatal policy of marching for 
Scotland, where they were assured their friends were numerous.
Accordingly they passed the Tweed, and went to Kelso.
Here 
they mustered their forces, and found them to amount to about 
fourteen hundred.
They stayed there about five days; but hearing 
that General Carpenter was come with his forces as far as Wooller, 
and intended immediately to go to Kelso, a council of war was 
called, in order seriously to consider what course they should take.
Lord Wintoun was for marching away into the west of Scotland, 
and gave several substantial reasons for it ; but the English, 
imagining that half the people in the country would rise as soon as 
ever they should see a standard erected for James III., rejected 
this advice, and the majority of votes being on their side, it was 
resolved to march back into England.
Mr. Charles Radcliffe then proposed to re-pass the Tweed, 
and attack King George's forces, since at that juncture they had a 
manifest advantage, from the weakness and weariness of General 
Carpenter's men, who were extremely fatigued, and their whole 
complement did not consist of above five hundred men, of which 
two regiments of dragoons were newly raised, and had never seen 
service.
This advice was bold, and agreeable to Mr. Radclifife's 
fiery and spirited temper ; and it is probable that if it had been 
followed the king's troops would have been worsted, con- 
sidering how much they were fatigued, and that they were 
not half the number of the insurgents.
But this advice was 
not followed, although it seemed the best that could be given at 
that time.
There seems to have been a fatality that attended all 
their counsels, for they could never agree to any one thing that 
tended to their advantage.
However, it was thought desirable to 
decamp from Kelso, which they did, and marched to Jedburgh.
While they lay at Jedburgh, they perceived that an oppor- 
tunity offered of getting the start of General Carpenter, by three 
302 
days' march ; upon which a consultation was held, and the English 
gentlemen earnestly pressed marching southwards, and it was 
accordingly resolved to cross the mountains, and march for 
England.
This resolution, however, might have been attended 
with fatal consequences, for the Highlanders could not be 
persuaded to cross the borders, which obliged them to alter 
their resolution.
From Jedburgh they marched to Hawick, 
then a small town which belonged to the Duke of Buccleuch, 
at whose house Lord Derwentwater and his brother took up their 
quarters.
Mr. Radcliffe finding that all the English officers were resolved 
to march into England, and that their reasons were too weak to 
balance those given by the Highlanders for their march into Scot- 
land, at this juncture sided with the Scots, and declared it as 
his opinion, that they should better serve the cause by joining the 
Highlanders in their proposed march to the west of Scodand, than 
by continuing their route to England, where it was uncertain what 
assistance they should have from their friends, many of whom, 
though he knew they were hearty in the cause, were yet fearful of 
appearing in it, till they saw some possibility of its succeeding ; 
and others, who were gentlemen of fortune, though they were 
hearty well-wishers of the cause, yet having too much to risk, did 
not care publicly to embark in it till they had some rational grounds 
to hope for success.
Therefore he thought their best way 
would be to strike a bold stroke in Scotland, and endeavour to 
make a complete conquest of that kingdom ; they should then be 
able to raise and send powerful armies into England, and be ready 
to succour them with supplies ; moreover it would always be a 
place of retreat if any disaster should befall their army, whereas, in 
England, if they should happen to meet with a rebuff, they would 
be entirely ruined, having no resource, nor any means of retrieving 
a misfortune of this kind.
This seemed to be wholesome advice ; 
but the leaders were so infatuated, that they would not listen to 
anything that contradicted the resolution of going back to 
England.
When Mr. Radcliffe perceived that whatever he could say 
would be to no purpose, he begged of them to give him only one 
303 
hundred horse, and he would take his fortune along with the 
Highlanders.
But this was not granted, because it would weaken 
their force too much, discourage their friends from joining them, 
and give their enemies an opportunity of crushing them before they 
should be able to make head against them.
Several councils and 
consultations were held about this affair of the Highlanders, and 
many messages passed between them ; at last the Highlanders 
agreed to stay with them so long as they continued on the north 
side of the Tweed, but were determined not to go further than the 
Borders.
After they had marched about from place to place for some 
time, the English gentlemen at last grew determined for an attempt 
upon England, having, they said, received letters from Lancashire 
inviting them thither, and assuring them that there would be a 
general insurrection on their approach, and that 20,000 men 
would immediately join them.
Whether they had such expresses 
or not was never certainly known; but they affirmed it to the 
army, and urged the advantages of a speedy march into England 
with such vehemence, that the scale was turned.
But Mr. Charles 
Radcliffe always protested against it, as a measure which would 
certainly be their ruin, as indeed it proved.
Five hundred High- 
landers thereupon left them, and the Earl of Wintcun went off 
likewise, Avitli a good part of his troops, although he afterwards 
rejoined them.
But notwithstanding all these discouragements, 
they were not disheartened, and still continued in their resolution 
of marching for England with such forces as were willing to bear 
them company.
On the loth of November they came to Preston, where they 
proclaimed the Pretender, and were joined by a great many gentle- 
men, with their tenants, servants, and attendants, but nearly all 
papists.
When the alarm was given that the King's forces were 
coming to attack them, and were but a few miles off, Mr. Farquar- 
son, at the head of a body of rebels, went out of the town as far as 
Ribble-bridge, where they posted themselves, to hinder the king's 
forces from proceeding any farther; but they were soon cut off, and the 
passage was lefc free for General Wills and his troops to pass into 
the town.
304 
Foster had been appointed General of the insurgents, not for 
any capacity on his part for military affairs, but because he was the 
popular Member of ParHament for the county of Northumberland, 
in the prime of life, and particularly because being a Protestant, he 
was expected to conciliate those Jacobites who were not Roman 
Catholics.
This appointment was most unfortunate.
He was 
accused of cowardice, but there is no reason to believe he lacked 
personal courage ; he was simply powerless through his incapacity.
The insurgents in the town prepared for a vigorous defence.
The gentlemen volunteers were drawn up in the churchyard, under 
the command of Lord Derwentvvater and his brother, Mr. Charles 
Radcliffe.
Both of them behaved with the utmost intrepidity, 
urging them by words and example to behave with courage suitable 
to the emergency of the occasion ; and they maintained their 
ground for a long time, and behaved so well, that they obliged the 
King's forces to retire.
During the whole action Charles Radcliffe 
was in the midst of the fire, and exposed to as much danger as the 
common soldiers.
But the rebels being now invested on all sides, 
Mr. Foster proposed a capitulation, which the Highlanders 
opposed, and Mr. Radcliffe protested against, and said that "he 
would rather die with his sword in his hand, like a man of honour, 
than be dragged like a felon to the gallows, to be there hanged 
like a dog." 
In this "scene of unavoidable destruction," says Sir Walter 
Scott, "the English gentlemen began to think on the means of 
saving their lives and returning to their homes and estates, while 
most of their Scottish allies were in favour of sallying out sword in 
hand, and preferred death to a base submission." General Foster 
was disheartened, however, and it was said that, acting on the 
advice of Colonel Oxburgh, he sent him to propose a capitulation 
without the knowledge of his principal colleagues.
The majority 
being against Charles Radcliffe, once more he was obliged to yield 
with the rest.
Whole hecatombs of prisoners were cruelly sacrificed to the 
Moloch which the Parliament had set up.
Thirty-four met with 
their death at Liverpool by the hands of the executioners.
Among 
305 
these were George CoUingwood of Easlington, a Northumbrian 
gentleman, who was much beloved in his county ; and also John 
Hunter, of the same county.
At Preston Captain Shaftoe and 
several prisoners of note suffered death before Lord Derwentvvater.
Others at Lancaster, Wigan, Garstang, and Manchester ; and more 
at Tyburn ; the privilege of decapitation being alone conferred on 
Lords Derwentwater and Kenmure.
Hanoverian vengeance was not satiated for some time after 
these executions ; but the last who suffered in England were John 
Bruce of Preston, and four others, who were executed at Lancaster.
Many died in Newgate, and great numbers were transported to the 
American plantations.
Charles Radcliffe was brought to London with many more 
of the rebel chiefs.
The Lords were committed to the Tower, and 
he with others, to Newgate.
On the 8th May, 17 16, he was 
arraigned at the Exchequer Bar at Westminster, for high treason, 
to which he pleaded not guilty.
On the i8th of the same month, 
he was brought there again, and tried upon the indictment, and 
having but little to say in his defence, he was found guilty.
A few 
days after, he and eleven more of the chiefs, were carried to 
Westminster in six coaches, in order to have sentence of death 
passed upon them.
It happened that when the coach which 
contained Mr. Radcliffe came into Fleet-street, his majesty King 
George I.
was then passing along in his coach on his way to 
Hanover, for the first time since his ascension to the throne.
This 
obliged Mr. Radcliffe's coach to stop, which happening opposite a 
distiller's shop, the third door on the right towards Temple Bar, 
he called for half a pint of aniseed, which he himself, his fellow- 
prisoners, and a servant of Newgate, drank,* and then proceeded 
to Westminster, where sentence of death was pronounced upon 
him.
He was several times respited, and perhaps might have been 
pardoned'; but not caring to tmst to an event so doubtful, he 
began to entertain thoughts of making his escape, which he 
* One might almost fancy that he pledged King George, and wished him 
well to Hanover.
21 
306 
actually did in the following manner :— The day appointed for 
the purpose, the rebel chiefs in Newgate had a very grand enter- 
tainment, which was held in a room called the castle, in the 
upper part of the prison.
Charles Radcliffe was then dressed 
in a suit of black ; and when the company were in the height of 
their merriment, observing a little door open in the corner of the 
room, he went through it, and was followed by thirteen more of 
the rebels who were then in company.
The passage from this door 
led them to the debtors' side, where the turnkey, not knowing 
them, but supposing them to be strangers who came to see their 
friends, let them out.* 
The fugitives had no sooner passed the gloomy portals of 
Newgate, than they hastened to various places of concealment ; 
and Mr. Radcliffe, after remaining for some time in the house of 
a lady of his family in London, who nobly protected her gallant 
relation from the emissaries of the government, was ultimately 
provided with an opportunity for escaping to France.
"The sails were fill'd, and fair the light winds blew, 
As glad to waft him from his native home ;" 
when the fugitive took leave of his country to seek an asylum in 
France.
He remained for some years in Paris and elsewhere, 
following the fortunes of the wandering and exiled prince, and en 
deavouring to promote his restoration.
During this time, his only 
means of subsistance was a miserable pension allowed to him by 
his more unfortunate royal master, and such remittances as his 
young nephew could manage to send him.
But the penalties of forfeiture, attainder, and exile could not 
break his gallant spirit; and, before many years had passed, we 
find him the hero of a somewhat ambitious courtship, which was 
marked with a most amusing and romantic, though prudent degree, 
of perseverance.
The lady of his choice was Charlotte Mary, 
only daughter and heir of Charles Livingstone, Earl of Newburgh, 
* 'VVhen Napoleon III.
was a prisoner at the Castle of Ham, he made his 
escape in the dress of a workman carrying out of his prison yard a plank upon 
his shoulder.
His letters were returned to the French General Post Office, 
marked, ''Gone, 7vithout leaving his address." The same might have been 
said of Charles Radcliffe when he escaped from Newgate.
307 
in the Scottish peerage, widow of Thomas Clifford, second son of 
Hugh, third Lord Clifford, Baron of Chudleigh, and in her own 
right Baroness Livingstone, Vicountess Kinnaird, and Countess of 
Newburgh.
She married in 17 13, with a portion amounting to 
;^io,ooo, and became a widow with two daughters in 1719.
Between that time and 1724, Charles Radcliffe became her suitor, 
and is said to have urged his suit no less than sixteen times.
His 
sixteenth proposal was, as it deserved to be, successful ; for, having 
obtained access to the lady's apartments in other ways in vain, he 
at last adopted the very novel expedient of coming down the 
chimney, when the countess, half alarmed and partly pleased at 
his perseverance, received her daring suitor graciously.
This 
scene is represented in a picture in the possession of Lord Petre, 
at Thorndon, in which the lady, whose attire is somewhat of Dutch 
fashion, is represented in the act of curtseying to her handsome 
and persevering suitor, who, notwithstanding that he is supposed 
to have just completed his journey through the soot, is attired in 
a rich white satin dress, slashed with pink.
His dress seems to be 
Spanish : he wears large pink bows at the knee and on the shoes, 
which are of a singular shape; and on the floor is a Spanish hat, 
adorned by a white plume tipped with pink.
It is not improbable 
that the proposal took place at Louvain, where the widowed 
Countess of Derwentwater and her son then resided.
It was in 
the gay city of Brussels that Lady Newburgh took Charles Radcliffe 
for her second husband.
He thus acquired a considerable income, 
and it enabled him to maintain the title of Count de Derwent, 
which he assumed on the death of his nephew.
By his marriage 
he had three sons, namely, James Bartholomew Radcliffe, born in 
France 23rd August, 1725, who became Earl of Newburgh, and 
died on the 2nd day of January, 1786; Clement Radcliffe and 
Charles Radcliffe ; and four daughters, namely, Charlotte, Barbara, 
Thomasina, and Mary.
His eldest son was thought to bear a 
great resemblance to the exiled house of Stuart, for whose service 
Charles Radcliffe ventured in 1733 to visit his native country.
It 
would seem that a life of inactivity, not chequered by peril and 
adventure, was insupportable to him ; and, accordingly, after the 
308 
accession of George II., he came to England, and resided for some 
time in Pall Mall, under the name of Mr. Johns, without being 
at all molested.
He returned to France, and again came to 
England in 1735, when he ventured into public, and visited several 
families in Essex and elsewhere ; but his hopes of obtaining a 
pardon, for which object he had the mediation of friends, were 
disappointed.
Charles Radcliffe took this opportunity of 
revisiting Dilston.
His parental hall was desolate ; the gardens 
were over-grown with weeds; the walls and gates were broken 
down ; and the old bridge (which still remains), was in disrepair.
There was nothing like itself but the old chapel, where a clergyman 
of the Church of England was officiating periodically, and beneath 
which the body of his lamented brother was entombed, besides their 
father's remains ; but even these sad reUcs he could not be 
allowed to see.
It is said that with a faithful follower named Armstrong, he 
resided for some time in the neighbourhood of Dilston, taking no 
pains to conceal himself In the shades of evening he was 
occasionally met by the inhabitants, who took him for the ghost of 
the departed Earl.
The woods and river-dell soon gained the 
reputation of being haunted by the spirit of their former owner, — 
a belief to which the dress and family likeness of the forgotten 
Charles Radcliffe contributed.
On one occasion he met face to 
face, in the narrow forest walk, the bailiff who had been sent down 
from London by the Commissioners.
The man, terrified at 
encountering the supposed ghost, turned his horse and galloped 
back, pursued by Charles, who highly relished the panic he had 
created.
The chase, however, was short, for the bailiff striking his 
head against the branch of a tree, was felled to the ground by the 
blow, where Charles left him to recover at his leisure.
He was 
picked up by a woodman and conveyed home, and ever afterwards 
persisted in asserting that the ghost had thrown its head at him, 
and thus occasioned the plight in which he was found.
He soon 
afterwards petitioned for his recall, and another was sent down in 
his stead, who declared that he had no fear of ghosts, and was 
determined to fire at it the first opportunity ; this opportunity was 
309 
not long wanting, for on a fine moonlight night, as he was riding 
through the river at Styford, he encountered Charles in the very 
middle of the stream, who seized the bridle of the bailiff's horse, 
causing it to rear over its unfortunate rider, and then left them to 
flounder out of the river as best they could.
These adventures 
occasioned so much sensation, that the Commissioners determined 
to send down a military force to maintain the confidence of the 
peasants, who were beginning to refuse to till their lands ; and as 
Charles at this time met with an opportunity of passing over into 
Holland, from whence he went into France, the small party of 
soldiers gained all the credit of having laid the ghost of the Earl.
Whether Charles Radcliffe ever revisited Derwentwater is not 
recorded ; but it is not improbable that a man of his active habits 
might do so.
Fancy the wanderer taking a bird's eye view of 
the most ancient of the family estates from the top of Castlet !
His mind would naturally revert to the times when the de 
Derwentwaters were sole owners of the beautiful lake and valley at 
his feet, with other lands extending towards the sea as far as 
Tallentire, which afterwards passed to a lady of the family, Dorothy 
Radcliffe, who married Francis Dacre, or D'Acre, and their 
daughter, Magdalen, married a Richmond.
He might almost have 
wished that his ancestor, Sir Edward Radcliffe, had not married 
the heiress of the Northumberland and Durham estates, and taken 
a wife in his mountain home.
After a residence of two years in England, again "the childe 
departed from his father's hall," and entered into the service of the 
French King.
From this time until 1 746, little is known of his 
career, but it is not likely that a spirit so energetic remained during 
all this time inactive.
The Prince, in whose cause he had suffered 
so much, had gone to his " long home," and was succeeded by his 
son, Charles Edward, whose mother was grand-daughter of John 
Sobieski, the heroic King of Poland.
Charles Radcliffe received 
a commission in a regiment which was allotted with other forces 
for the Chevalier's service in Scotland ; and with his eldest son, 
James Bartholomew Radcliffe, then in his twentieth year, he again 
sailed for England, and entered on new and romantic scenes of 
310 
his chequered career.
It is probable that the Countess of New- 
burgh was at this time in Scotland ; and although he did not appear 
in arms in the ill-fated Scottish campaign, he was doubtless giving 
his services in another quarter ; at all events, no part of his time 
was spent in inglorious ease, and we may suppose him to have 
taken leave of his lady in the sentiments of the ballad : — 
" Farewell to Lochaber, and farewell to my Jean, 
Where heartsome with thee I have many days been ; 
For, borne on rough seas to a far hostile shore, 
May be I'll return to Lochaber no more." 
The traditions of Lancashire preserve a romantic tale that 
Charles Radcliffe lived for some time in the family of an honest 
yeoman — half farmer and half fisherman — who tenanted a lonely 
farm on the Lancashire coast, where the much frequented South- 
port has since arisen.
Here he was introduced by a Roman 
Catholic gentleman in the neighbourhood, and, although quick of 
apprehension, seemed to want the gift of speech.
He com- 
municated his thoughts by writing, or drawing sketches with chalk 
— a method which did not tend to unravel the mystery that 
attached to him.
When, however, he was about to be apprehended, 
and was insolently addressed by a minion of the law, he was no 
longer dumb, he answered, with dignity, " Sir knave !
I own no 
nicknames, and I answer to none.
My name is Derwentwater." 
Although made prisoner, through the wits of the fisherman's 
daughter he made his escape.
For the full account of this story, 
see "Roby's Traditions of Lancashire," second series, vol.
2, p.
213.
At what time this occurrence took place, or whither the ship he 
embarked in conveyed him, there is no record ; but turning to 
authentic history, we next find Cliarles Radcliffe (who styled him- 
self Earl of Derwentwater), his son, and twenty officers, Scotch, 
Irish, and French — besides about sixty men — at sea, opposite the 
coast of England.
On the 22nd November, 1745, they were 
captured by King George's frigate.
The Sheerness, being bound for 
Montrose in Scotland.
Mr. Radcliffe and his son were brought 
to London with their fellow passengers, who were accused of 
treasonable intentions in favour of Prince Charles.
The captors 
\ 
3ii 
seeing the resemblance of young Mr. Radcliffe to the prince, took 
him for the Chevalier's younger son, and/a;ided Afr. Radcliffe to be 
the Pretender himself.
His arrival in London, and his safe 
lodgement in the Tower, created no little sensation ; but the public 
before long found out that the report was without foundation.
On 
the 27th March following, young Mr. Radcliffe and four officers 
who were French subjects, were liberated from the Tower upon 
their parole, for they could not be indicted for treason to the King 
of Great Britain.
The spring, summer, and autumn of that 
eventful year passed over the head of Charles Radcliffe, but still 
left him an untried prisoner in the Tower.
The Government 
" Willing to wound, and yet afraid to strike," 
seems to have been at a loss to know what proceedings to take 
against him, and was probably occupied all that time in en- 
deavouring to find witnesses who would prove him to be the same 
Charles Radcliffe who had been condemned for high treason thirty 
years before.
On Friday, the 21st November, 1746, he was taken in a coach, 
strongly guarded, from the Tower to the Court of Queen's Bench 
in Westminster Hall, to be arraigned on the conviction for high 
treason which had been recorded against him in 17 16.
He is 
described as appearing five feet ten inches in height, dressed in a 
scarlet regimental suit, faced with black velvet, and gilt buttons, 
a gold laced waistcoat, bagwig, and hat of Spanish fashion, with J 
white plume.
Being called on to plead as Charles Radcliffe, he 
said that was not his name ; that he was the Count de Derw'ent- 
water, and a commissioned officer and subject of the King of 
France, whose commission he produced, and in whose realm he 
had resided thirty years.
It was ordered that a jury should be 
empannelled to try his identity, and this trial was appointed for the 
following Monday.
On that day he was again arraigned, but he 
treated the Court with contumacy, and refused to acknowledge its 
jurisdiction to try him, repeating his claim to be treated as a 
subject of the King of France, and appealed to the minister of the 
the King of Sicily, who was then in court.
This claim was of 
312 
course disallowed; and the indictment, founded on the conviction 
which had been recorded in 1716, was then read over to him in 
English.
He merely repeated that he was the Count de Derwent- 
water, and persisted in refusing to hold up his hand, and to plead 
in the usual form.
His counsel, however, took issue on this 
allegation, and moved the postponement of the trial, on the ground 
that two material witnesses were absent.
But the court held that 
no sufficient ground was shown for a postponement, and proceeded 
to hear the evidence of the witnesses whom the Crown had at length 
found, to prove the identity of the prisoner with the Charles 
Radcliffe who had been convicted in 17 16.
Two Hexham men — 
Abraham Bunting and Thomas Mosley — swore to his identity from 
a scar on his face, (said to have been received in a blacksmith's 
shop when a boy,) and declared that they had seen him march out 
of Hexham at the head of the Earl of Derwentwater's tenantry in 
October, 17 15.
One of them swore that he had seen the prisoner 
at Dilston ten years before, and had shown him a trap door leading 
to a vaulted chamber below the floor of Dilston Hall.
A writer of the day says that " none of them could come up 
to the point until a great officer was sworn, who deposed that Mr.
Radcliffe, since his confinement in the Tower, had acknowledged 
to him when they had been drinking a glass of wine together, that 
he was the same person.
But Mr. Radcliffe objected to the 
credibility of this witness, because he had confessed to him that he 
believed neither in God nor devil ; and it would be an absurdity to 
swear a man upon the bible who had no faith in anything it 
contained." 
This objection was over-ruled, and no other defence being 
made, after a trial of seven hours duration, the jury having 
consulted ten minutes, found their verdict, that the prisoner was 
the same Charles Radcliffe who had been convicted of high treason 
in 1 7 16.
It was then ordered that he should be beheaded on the 
8th of December.
On hearing this sentence, he merely remarked 
that he wished a later day had been appointed, to afford time for 
his acquainting some friends in France, so that his brother, the 
Earl of Morton, and he, might have set out on their journey at the 
same time.
\ 
313 
His demeanour in the Tower is said to have been marked by 
a sullen haughtiness, which contrasted unfavourably with the meek 
resignation of his noble brother in similar circumstances.
Thirty 
years of exile had hardened rather than softened his temper.
But, 
like the earl, he behaved with courage, constancy, and a lofty 
firmness ; and his manly bearing, as free from bravado as it was 
from weakness, well became the scion of a noble line.
But of the 
last days of his eventful life, no particulars have come down to us, 
save that it is said in a contemporary periodical, that he seemed to 
disregard a devotional preparation for eternity, until, on the 4th of 
December, when he received a letter from his niece.
Lady Petre, 
which seems to have recalled his attention to the necessity of 
preparing for the change that awaited him, because from that time 
he evinced a more religious deportment.
On the night preceding 
his execution, he wrote the following letter to the Countess of 
Newburgh, his wife : — 
"From the Tower, 7tli Deer., 1746.
"The best of friends takes leave of you.
He has made his will.
He is 
resigned — to-morrow is the day.
Love his memory.
Let his friends join with 
you in prayer : 'tis no misfortune to die prepared.
Let us love our enemies 
and pray for them.
Let my daughters be virtuous women like you ; my 
blessing to them all ; my kind love to Fanny,* that other tender mother of my 
dear children.
"Adieu!
dear friend, 
" DER WENT WATER." 
It seems that at first Government hesitated in their sangumary 
purpose, for orders were not given until so near the time, that the 
carpenters worked the whole day and night of Sunday, in order to 
be ready for the fatal Monday, the 8th of December.
About eight 
o'clock in the morning, two troops of life guards, a troop of horse 
grenadier guards, and a battalion of foot guards, marched to Little 
Tower Hill ; the horse guards lining the way from the scaffold to 
the iron gate, while the rest of the forces surrounded the scaffold.
Four months had not elapsed since, upon the same spot, a 
vast concourse of people had witnessed the decapitation of Lords 
* The Hon. Frances Clifford, daughter of his wife, Lady Newburgh, by 
her first marriage.
3l4 
Kilmarnock and the accomplished Balmerino, two of the noble 
captives of CuUoden — that fatal and sanguinary contest which, in 
the previous April, while Charles Radcliffe was a prisoner in the 
Tower, had ended for ever the hopes of the House of Stuart.
The 
scaffold on which the brave and devoted adherent, Charles Rad- 
cliffe, was now to suffer, was covered with black serge, as was the 
fatal block ;* and upon the scaffold was placed the coflfin to receive 
his remains.
It was covered with black velvet, and had costly gilt 
handles and nails, but bore no inscription.
In the meantime the 
Sheriffs proceeded in their chariots from the Mitre Tavern, 
Finchurch-street, to the lower end of the Minories, from whence, 
preceded by their officers, they went to the victualling office, 
where the Sheriffs remained ; the under sheriffs proceeding with 
a party of the foot guards to the east gate of the Tower, next the 
iron gate, to demand from General Williamson, deputy-governor, 
the surrender of the prisoner.
He was brought, riding in a landau, 
through the east gate of the Tower, whence a procession moved 
slowly in the following order : — First, the officers, then a mourning 
coach, conveying the under sheriffs with their wands, then the 
prisoner, whose carriage was surrounded by a detachment of foot 
guards, and followed by the officers of the Tower.
Proceeding 
thus up Little Tower Hill, Mr. Radcliffe alighted opposite the 
victualling office, and happening to see among the crowd some 
gentlemen whom he knew, he saluted them with cheerful courtesy, 
and, coming to the side of the mourning coach, he asked whether 
he was to go in that vehicle, and on being answered in the 
affirmative, said, " It is well," and stepped in directly.
A little 
booth, Uned with black cloth, was erected at the foot of the stairs 
leading to the scaffold, wherein he spent a short time at his 
devotions, speaking but few words to any person.
He then, with 
great composure, ascended the scaffold, attended by a priest and 
a few friends, and by the sheriffs.
The gallant Radcliffe was attired in a scarlet regimental suit ; 
the coat made with short tight sleeves and long wide cuffs, with 
* Probably the one now exhibited in the Tower.
I was told by the 
Warder in 1846, that Kilmarnock and Balmerino were beheaded on it.
315 
gold buttons and lace ; a long flapped waistcoat, brocaded with 
flowers, quilted, as was the coat, with black velvet worked with 
gold ; white silk stockings, which rolled over the knee, and diamond 
buckles at his shoes and garters.
His hat was decked with a white 
plume, and a peruke, made of his own bright hair, fell in full curls 
upon his shoulders.
The collar of his shirt was fastened by a black 
ribbon, and he wore a silver crucifix and rosary of beads.
When 
he came upon the scaff-old, he first took leave of his friends "with 
great serenity and calmness of mind." He then spoke as follows : 
" I die a true, obedient, and humble son of the Catholic Apostolic 
Church, in perfect charity with all mankind, and a true well-wisher 
to my dear country, that never can be happy without doing justice 
to the best and most injured king.
I die with all the sentiments 
of gratitude, respect, and love for the King of France, Louis, the 
well-beloved— a glorious name !
I recommend to his majesty my 
dear family.
I heartily repent of all my sins, and have a firm con- 
fidence to obtain pardon from Almighty God through the merits 
of his blessed Son, Christ Jesus, our Lord, to whom I recommend 
my soul." Having assured the executioner of his forgiveness, he 
put some gold pieces into his hands, saying, " I am but a poor 
man ; there's ten guineas for you ; if I had more, I would give it 
you ; I desire you to do your office so as to put me to the least 
possible misery you can." He then kneeled down by the block, 
and was occupied in prayer for about six minutes, all the persons 
on the scaffold kneeling with him.
His devotions finished, he 
divested himself of his wig, his coat, and waistcoat ; and then 
turning to the Sheriffs, took leave of them, after which reciting a 
short prayer, and crossing himself several times, "he laid his head 
upon the block," and told the executioner he was to do his office 
when he should see him stretch forth his hands.
In less than half 
a minute he gave the signal, which was instantly followed by the 
stroke of the axe.
It almost severed the head from the body at 
one blow, which was given with such force that the axe became 
fixed in the block.
Charles Radcliffe "behaved to the last," says a contemporary 
account, "with the greatest coolness, fortitude, and manly courage.
316 
and was in no way shocked at the approach of death." So the 
noble victim died, in the fifty-third year of his age ; constant to the 
last in his faith, and in his attachment to the exiled House of 
Stuart.
Such was the sanguinary vengeance of George II.
for a 
treasonable act committed in the reign of his father at a distance 
of no less than thirty years !
The remains were taken in the 
coffin to the Nag's Head, in Gray's Inn lane, and from thence 
removed, "in the dead of night," to a Mr. Walmsley's, near 
Red Lion Square.
His heart is said to have been embalmed and 
placed in a leaden casket, which was afterwards deposited, by his 
own desire, near the remains of his noble brother and ancestors at 
Dilston; and from Mr. Walmsley's, the body was taken two 
nights afterwards, to be interred, as was supposed, in the church- 
yard of St. Giles-in-the-Fields, but, according to tradition, in 
reaUty to Abbot's Stanstead, in Hertfordshire ; the funeral being 
conducted with all possible secrecy.
The following inscription in his memory was erected in the 
churchyard of St. Giles : — 
" Carolus Radcliffe, Comes de Derwentwater, 
DecoUatus die 8 December 1746, Etatis 53.
Requiescat in pace !" 
The vengeance of the first two Georges on the adherents of 
the House of Stuart, urged on by Walpole and his party, was 
resented by a few independent men.
The Earl of Anglesea, in 
reference to the impeachment of the Earl of Oxford, in 17 16, said 
that " such violent measures were disagreeable to the people, and 
it was to be feared would make the sceptre shake in the King's 
hands." But the king thought more of the security of his throne 
than of the Protestant faith which he was brought from Hanover 
to defend.* There were statesmen who were sincere and dis- 
interested in their efforts to stamp out the House of Stuart, and, as 
they also hoped, any future ascendancy of Romanism in England.
* Not so, however, George III.
He said he could lay down his crown, 
and live in a cottage, rather than violate his Coronation Oath to defend the 
Protestant Constitution, by virtue of which he reigned.
317 
Of these, the Earl of Shaftesbury, as Lord High Steward, was 
perhaps the most conscientious and distinguished.
It was the dread of the return of Roman Catholicism which 
caused the nation to suffer the Government of the day to visit with 
such severity the offences of men, who, however mistaken, were 
loyal to their creed, political and religious, and who staked their 
property and their lives in the defence of their principles.
Many good men and true, who were not Roman Catholics, 
espoused the cause of the exiled Stuarts.
The Lord Kenmure, in 
his speech on the scaffold, said : "I die a Protestant of the Church 
of England.
I take God to witness, before whom I have soon to 
appear, that I never had any design tofavouror introduce Popery." 
The Earl of Derwentwater, and his brother Charles, not only 
suffered in their own persons, but, by the vindictive action of 
Parliament, the treason of the fathers was visited upon their 
innocent offspring.
History does not present a parallel case.
The Derwentwater Estates included thirteen manors, or large 
separate estates, in Northumberland and Durham, independent of 
their more ancient possessions in Cumberland.
The whole yielded 
a larger yearly income than the Electorate of Hanover.
The 
estates were all settled by the Earl in 1712 upon himself for life, 
and entailed upon his first and other sons, with remainder to 
Charles Radcliffe for life, on whose first and other sons the estates 
were in like manner entailed.
The Earl having only a life estate 
in his property, could forfeit no greater interest.
His only son, 
although he lost his title of nobility by the attainder of his father, 
was, by solemn adjudication of law at Westminster, admitted tenant in 
tail in possession of all the settled estates ; and the fortune of the 
Earl's daughter was raised and paid out of them.
The Earl's son 
(John Radcliffe), was in possession of the estates during sixteen 
years ; and if he had lived to attain the age of twenty-one years, he 
might have dealt effectually with them, so that they could not, at 
any future time, have been affected by the attainder of his father, 
or his uncle, Charles Radcliffe.
Upon his death, without issue, in 
1 73 1, thehfe estate of Charles Radcliffe commenced, but it vested 
in the Crown by reason of the attainder.
Not so, however, the 
318 
estate in tail of his eldest son, James Bartholomew, to whom the 
settled property stood limited by a limitation similar to that in 
virtue of which his cousin, Mr. John Radcliffe, had been admitted 
tenant.
James Bartholomew was born on the 23rd of August, 
1725, at Vincennes; but,.the statute passed in the seventh year of 
Anne (1708), gave him all the rights of a British subject born 
within the realm.
He therefore became legally entitled on his 
birth, to an estate in tail male expectant on his father's decease, of 
all the lands comprised in the settlement of 171 2.
He was, never- 
theless, excluded while an infant, and remained excluded through 
his life, from his inheritance, by a cruel, severe, and unprecedented 
expedient, which must ever reflect indelible disgrace upon the 
Government and Legislature of the time ; for, in 173 1, immediately 
after the death of Mr. John Radcliffe, and when James Bartholo- 
mew, his cousin, was an infant of five years of age, the Government 
devised a statute, whereby it in effect declared that nothing 
contained in the declaratory law of Queen Anne, did or should 
extend to give the privileges of a natural-born subject to any child 
or children born, or to be born abroad, whose father at the time of 
his or their birth, either stood attainted of high treason, or was in 
the actual service of a foreign state in enmity to the Crown of 
Great Britain — an outrage of legislative tyranny which was full of 
injustice generally, and designed with peculiar cruelty to the heir 
of Radcliffe, being passed for no other purpose than to secure to 
Government the confiscation of the great estates of the Derwent- 
water family.
When the eldest son of Charles Radcliffe was about eleven 
years of age, his mother, the Countess of Newburgh, gave notice to 
all the tenants on the Derwentwater Estates, of the title of the 
Radcliffe family, in the following letter.
"London, September 20th, 1736.
"Sir, — Knowing you to be a friend of a family whose interest I espouse 
very much, I beg you will let the tenants know, who I hear are now taking 
leases upon lives, that there is three sons belonging to that family ; and though 
their father cannot now possess the estate, his sons' hgkt is widonbted after his 
death, so that it will be at their peril.
I am come over on purpose to serve 
the family what I can, and I have a great many relations who have interest, 
319 
and are so kind as to have a will to serve me.
I beg you'll excuse this 
trouble, and believe me, Sir, 
"Your most humble Servant, 
"C.
NEWBURGH.
"To Mr. Charles Bushby, at Corbridge, near Hexham." 
However undoubted the right of the eldest son of Charles 
Radcliffe after his father's death, he was as effectually deprived of 
his inheritance as if he had himself been guilty of high treason.
In 1749, the King went down to Parliament, and gave his 
assent to an act to "endow the Royal Hospital for Seamen, at 
Greenwich, with the forfeited estates of the Earl of Derwentwater 
and Charles Radcliffe, deceased, and for raising certain sums of 
money for the relief of the children of the said Charles Radcliffe." 
Charles Radcliffe's eldest son, being deprived of his patrimony, 
and having no other means of subsistence, accepted ;^24,ooo — a 
sum scarcely exceeding one year's income of the family estates — as 
a relief for his support, and consented that the title under the 
settlement should be extinguished.
But, if he was under the 
disabilities of an alien, and could not hold the estate, the Act 
of 1 749 could confer no valid title on the trustees of Greenwich 
Hospital, still less could it operate in law to deprive his only son, 
Anthony James, born in England in 1757, of his rights of inherit- 
ance.
Anthony James, grandson of Charles Radcliffe, became Fifth 
Earl of Newburgh in 1786.
He married Anne, daughter of Joseph 
Webb, Esq., of Slinden.
She was a grand-niece of the last 
Countess of Derwentwater.
He presented a petition to Parliament 
9th June, 1788, when a bill was passed granting ;^2,5oo per annum 
to his lordship.
He was undoubtedly the last who had any claim on 
the Derwentwater Estates under the settlement <?/" 1 7 1 2.
He was the 
last male heir, and was succeeded in the Earldom of Newburgh by 
his cousin, Francis Eyre, Esq. In the year 1800, he visited 
Keswick, and was in Crosthwaite's Museum.
The proprietor 
expressed his regret that he had accepted so paltry a pension for 
his large inheritance, but he only replied — "Half a loaf is better 
than no bread," 
320 
I do not intend to moralize on 'the unhappy fate of Charles 
Radcliffe, the great-grandson of Sir Edward Radcliffe, who suffered 
so much in the cause of Charles I.
that he was distinguished in his 
time as Sir Edward the Loyal — the grandson of Charles II., his 
mother being the Lady Mary Tudor — the first cousin of the 
Pretender — brought up in France, and in constant intercourse with 
the exiled Stuarts : it is not surprising that he should have espoused 
the Stuart cause with all the vehemence of his ardent and 
uncompromising spirit.
His loyalty and his creed were dearer to 
him than life itself Although invincible prejudice does not 
exonerate any man from the duty of exercising his reason, and 
investigating the grounds of his faith, yet k is not for us to presume 
to judge another: "To his own master he standeth or falleth." 
Of him it may be truly said that he was an honest man, the very 
soul of honour, and a gentleman.
Prudence led some families to take opposite sides in civil 
conflicts, and then, whatever the issue, the family in one or others 
of its members retained their titles and property.
They probably 
bore in mind Sir John Harrington's lines : — 
"Treason doth never prosper, what's the reason ?
Why, when it prospers, none dare call it treason." 
Not so the two devoted Radcliffes of Derwentwater.
They staked 
their all, and they lost all, but honour and integrity.
It may be that many a thoughtful tourist will visit the ruins 
on Lord's Island, and ponder with melancholy thoughts not 
devoid of thrilling interest, on the misfortunes of this ancient and 
honourable family.
Had the lot of Charles Radcliffe fallen on 
happier times, his sterling character and good qualities might have 
left an enduring impression for good on his country.
As it fell 
out, we may say of him and his noble and amiable brother, that — 
They "left a name at which the world grew pale, 
To point a moral, or adorn a tale."

ROBERT SOUTHEY.
By the Very Rev. A.
P. STANLEY, D.D., F.R.S., 
Dean of Westminster.
(Lecture delivered at Keswick, March ^isf, 1879.^ 
In choosing the subject of Robert Sou they as the one on 
which I am to address you this evening, you were, I beheve, 
influenced by having heard from some one the admiration which I 
had expressed for his poetry.
It is true that in this respect he was, I may say, my earliest 
love.
I can remember, even at this moment, the feeling of delight 
with which I read, one after the other, the poems of " Thalaba," 
" Kehama," "Madoc," and "Roderick." Not even the novels of 
Sir Walter Scott had, for me, a keener attraction.
The prospect 
of visiting the scenes of any of these poems filled me with enthusi- 
asm ; and although in later years that enthusiasm may have cooled 
down, yet it was only three years ago it led me indirectly into 
making a visit to the otherwise somewhat uninviting kingdom of 
Portugal, that I might see some of the spots hallowed in my 
memory by the closing scenes of " Roderick." And, even now, I 
sometimes feel as if I should not die happy until I had explored 
the locality of the crisis of that poem " Covadonga," in the 
Asturias.
But this predilection would not have been sufficient 
to warrant my yielding to your request, if it were not that it 
seemed to me a useful framework for various wholesome 
reflections.
Southey is one of those poets who has now fallen almost into 
oblivion in the great outside world.
Here and there you meet 
?2 
322 
individuals, like myself, who still cherish the flame which he once 
enkindled.
Here and there you meet families in which the 
tradition of admiration is handed down.
I may mention that the 
present Lord Chief Justice Coleridge, while his venerable father 
was still living, presiding over a whole host of children and grand- 
children, pointed out to me with satisfaction that I was looking on 
three generations of the worshippers of Southey.
But these are 
exceptions, and it is therefore instructive from time to time to 
recall the thoughts of the younger generation to the household 
gods of their fathers, and to poems which have retained a more 
living popularity, where may be seen traces of Southey's influence 
by those to whom his melodies are familiar.
For example, I doubt 
whether any single poet has so deeply coloured the phraseology of 
Keble's " Christian Year " as Southey.
Again, he is an author of whom, speaking impartially, we must 
say that his writings exhibit extraordinary inequalities.
Few poets 
or prose authors of our time have written books at once so good 
and so poor.
Dryden is perhaps another example.
Of his history 
of the Peninsular War, the Duke of Wellington is reported to 
have said : " Mr. Southey, Sir, may be a very clever man ; but 
he has not understood the plan of one of my campaigns, nor the 
object of one of my battles." And of his Poems, "Joan of Arc," 
"The Vision of Judgment," and many of his Laureate Odes, have 
sunk into a gulf of oblivion from which it would be impossible 
ever to rescue them.
We must acknowledge this.
His opinions, too, were of the most unequal importance.
Having begun life as a revolutionary Radical, he ended it as a 
most uncompromising Conservative.
There was a vehemence in 
both extremes which belonged to the same defect of character.
Lord Macaulay says, that in passing " from one extreme of 
political opinion to another, he has constantly contrived, like 
Milton's Satan going round the globe, to 'ride with darkness.' 
Wherever the thickest shadow of the night may at any moment 
chance to fall, there is Mr. Southey.
It is not everybody who 
could have so dexterously avoided blundering on the daylight 
in the course of a journey to the antipodes." This, no doubt, 
323 
is a highly coloured statement, as is the whole of the fierce assault 
contained in the Essay from which fhese words are extracted.
But it is useful for all of us, old or young, to bear in mind, 
that even in those whom we most admire, there may be failings ; 
and it is one of the duties of all public instructors to insist on 
the duty of discrimination in human characters, and to remember 
the infirmities and the errors which belong to the mixed conditions 
of human existence.
But, thirdly, the topic appeared to me extremely suitable to 
this place.
Some of you have had the pleasure of knowing him ; 
almost all of you must have heard of him.
He is the genius of 
Keswick, almost as exclusively as Wordsworth is of Grasmere and 
Rydal — or as Shakspeare is of Stratford-on-Avon.
His grave, his 
monument, his house, — (as I can speak from experience, owing 
to the kindness of its present occupants) — still speak of him.
Such memories, attaching to any locality, are amongst the best 
treasures which we can possess, if we only rightly use them ; and 
it therefore seemed to me a good work to revive these recollections, 
and to ask you to consider with me what were the permanent 
elements of good which Southey's life and teaching may convey.
A fesv words, and a few words only, on his general life.
Personally, I never saw him.
The first time that I visited the 
Lakes was when I was staying in Grasmere with Dr. Arnold, and 
rode or walked over from thence to Keswick.
It was a great 
disappointment to me, although highly characteristic of the man, 
that Dr. Arnold was too shy to give me a letter of introduction to 
the poet, whom of all others in England I should most have 
wished to see.
I walked, if I remember, round the outside of Greta 
Hall ; but that was the nearest approach that I ever made to 
him in bodily presence.
But it is not difficult for me, or for 
any one, to recall what he was.
From the abundant stores 
that his letters provide, he remains a shining example of a man 
whose pleasure was found in the simplest, kindliest, social inter- 
course, and in the most indefatigable intellectual activity.
Such a 
workman is an exception to us all — a workman who feels his 
pleasure in his work, and his enjoyment in ministering to the 
324 
wants of others.
He said somewhere, and herein I quite agree 
with him, that one of the greatest of earthly pleasures is the 
correction of proof-sheets.
An excellent Quaker, with whom I 
crossed the Atlantic last autumn, told me that Southey had said to 
him, (he was then sixty-five,) " My motto through life has been in 
labore requies" — he pointed as he spoke to the sixth volume of the 
" Acta Sanctorum," through which he was steadily plodding, and 
added, " My only sorrow will be when I have reached the end." 
Let me read to you a few passages from his letters describing 
the best experiences of his life.
[The lecturer then read passages 
as referred to below, from the " Life and Correspondence of the late 
Robert Southey," in 6 vols., edited by his son, the Rev. Charles 
Cuthbert Southey.] 
Vol. III., page 84.— Boy's heart and child's spirit.
Vol. IV., page 31.
— The effect of time on his feelings.

— The future destiny of mankind.
Vol. v., page 12.
— The value of Religion in the widest 
sense.
Vol. IV.
page 75.
— "The duties of a Parish Clergyman." 
I now turn to his writings.
Of the style of his prose writings, 
it has been truly said they have "every merit except the first." 
But of their substance, we must acknowledge that the inequality, of 
which I spoke before, here makes itself apparent.
But leaving in 
the shade those which are not worth recalling, let us hasten to say 
that there are two which will probably stand as long as the 
English language itself One is the "Life of Nelson." Even 
Macaulay relaxes in the presence of that charming biography.
Southey was gratified at being told by Queen Victoria, then a little 
girl of eleven years of age, that she lately read, with pleasure, his 
"Life of Nelson." Only the other day I received a letter from an 
aged clergyman, who describes the delight with which, when 
confined to a sick room at school with small-pox, he read the "Life 
of Nelson" in the spring of 1830, a few weeks before the death of 
George IV., and vainly sought last winter to refresh his memory 
by another perusal.
The " Life of Wesley," from its subject, is 
not so popular ; but that also remains, after all that has been said 
for and against that extraordinary man, the best record of Wesley's 
position in English literature and English religion.
Allow me to 
read to you Southey's own account of his design in writing it.
[See 
Vol. IV., p.
294, of " Life and Correspondence."] 
These two books furnish, the first for Sailors, the other 
for Clergymen, unfailing springs of living instruction and 
edification.
I pass now to his Poems.
They may be divided into three 
classes.
I speak now of those poems which deserve to live.
Tlie 
first are the Ballads.
It is difficult exactly to analyze the pleasure 
given to us by effusions so fantastic, and belonging to a vein of 
thought so eccentric.
The pleasure they give is derived, I 
think, chiefly from two sources : one is the extraordinary mastery 
which they display over the English language in one of its most 
difficult forms.
I remember that Arnold used to say, " that he did 
not know any poem which, in the same compass, shewed such an 
exuberance and such a concentration of the powers of English 
speech, as did the poem on the Waterfall of Lodore.
" Secondly, 
there is the pleasure arising from the profound acquaintance and 
familiarity with the grotesque sentiment of the Middle Ages, such 
as in architecture is shewn in the gargoyles of our Cathedrals, and 
in literature, by the profuse display of ecclesiastical miracles, in 
which, as in the gargoyles, reverence and irreverence are combined 
in the most intricate mixture, and yet, owing to the absence of any 
sinister motive, irreverence never runs into absolute profaneness.
Let me give a specimen of this : the poem on Queen Mary's 
Christening.
Secondly, there are the long historical or mythological poems, 
whose names I have already enumerated.
Of these, as I have 
said, "Joan of Arc " must rank in the lowest place ; even I have 
not been able to read it.
" Madoc" and "Roderick," although they 
were my childhood's delight, have lost much of their charm : yet, 
326 
in the case of "Roderick," any one can feel the austere grace of 
passages like these.
The first, The answer of Pelayo, the founder 
of the Spanish monarchy, to one who announced to him the over- 
throw of his house and family.
(Quotation here made.) 
I ventured to quote these words in public upon the occasion 
of the tragical overthrow of brilliant hopes, when the present 
successor of Pelayo last year lost his beloved and charming 
bride ; Again, the description of " Virtue overclouded by 
misfortune" of which he himself describes the origination.
("Life and Correspondence.") But "Thalaba"and "Kehama" 
have never lost their hold on those who were once swayed 
by them, and this arises from a deeper cause than the 
mere melody of the verses, or loftiness of the sentiments.
He has himself given the account of their origin.
(Vol. III., 
p. 351, "Life and Correspondence.") You will perceive that, 
unconsciously perhaps, he was here treading on the threshold 
of that immense world of religious philosophy, which the later part 
of the 19th century has, for the first time in the world's history, 
appropriated to itself, — the region of comparative theology, or com- 
parative religion — that which in our day has been so powerfully 
set forth by Professor Max Miiller.
It is a region of the greatest 
interest to scholars ; but it is also a region full of the most serious 
and useful instruction to pastors and their flocks in the humblest 
walks of life, because it opens to us the consoling belief, taught indeed 
by the Apostles, but in the later ages of Christendom almost 
entirely eclipsed — that the knowledge and grace of God are not 
confined to any single church, or any single race, but may be found 
wherever the heart sincerely turns towards whatever there is of the 
best and highest in its own experience.
I remember an aged peasant in Cheshire, since called to her 
rest, describing to me, as though it came with the force of a new 
revelation, that she had once gone to a neighbouring barn to.
hear 
two old persons, a Quaker and a Quakeress, as she called them, 
who travelled in many parts of the world, and had announced it 
as their fixed belief, that in every religion God would accept those, 
327 
who, according to the best light of their conscience, sought to 
worship and to serve Him. She said that this removed from her 
mind a load of doubt and perplexity, and that she was now able 
to look on the various disputes and controversies of which from 
time to time the faint echoes reached her, with calmness and con- 
solation.
That aged peasant's beUef, and the announcement of 
those two old missionaries, form the basis of the philosophy of 
comparative religion.
It is this sentiment which Southey en- 
deavoured to exemplify in the case of Mahomedanism, and of 
Hindoo Mythology, in these two poems.
In "Thalaba" he took 
the one great Mahomedan virtue of resignation, and worked it out 
to the full.
In doing so, he^ntered so completely into the genius of 
the Arabian world, that as we read the pages of "Thalaba," we seem 
to be transported altogether beyond the range of European thought 
or European scenery.
The first night that I ever spent in the desert, there came 
back to me, with a vividness occasioned by the exact and literal 
reproduction of the atmosphere around me, the lines which I have 
again and again repeated in my early boyhood, from the opening 
of " Thalaba " : - 
" How beautiful is night !
A dewy freshness fills the silent air, 
No mist obscures, nor cloud, nor speck, nor stain.
Breaks the serene of heaven : 
In full-orb'd glory yonder Moon divine 
Rolls through the dark blue depths.
Beneath her steady ray 
The desert-circle spreads.
Like the round ocean, girdled with the sky.
How beautiful is night !
" 
Or again the passage further on, where his life in the tent is 
described (3rd Book of "Thalaba," stanza 16) :— 
"It was the wisdom and the will of Heaven 
That, in a lonely tent, had cast 
The lot of Thalaba.
There might his soul develope best 
Its strengthening energies ; 
328 
There might he from the world 
Keep his heart pure and uncontaminate, 
Till at the written hour he should be found 
Fit servant of the Lord, without a spot.
" 
Stanza 2 1 : — 
" 'Tis the cool evening hour • 
The Tamarind from the dew 
Sheathes its young fruit, yet green.
Before their Tent the mat is spread.
The Old Man's awful voice 
Intones the holy Book.
What if beneath no lamp-illumin'd dome, 
Its marble walls bedeck'd with flourish'd truth.
Azure and gold adornment ?
sinks, the word 
With deeper influence from the Imam's voice.
Where in the day of congregation, crowds 
Perform the duty-task ?
Their Father is their Priest, 
The Stars of Heaven their point of prayer.
And the blue Firmament 
The glorious Temple, where they feel 
The present Deity !
" Yet through the purple glow of eve 
Shines dimly the white moon.
The slacken'd bow, the quiver, the long lance, 
Rest on the pillar of the Tent.
Knitting light palm-leaves for her brother's brow.
The dark-eyed damsel sits ; 
The Old Man tranquilly 
Up his curl'd pipe inhales 
The tranquillizing herb, 
So listen they the reed of Thalaba, 
While his skill'd fingers modulate 
The low, sweet, soothing, melancholy tones." 
Still more remarkable is this in regard to " Kehama." No 
doubt the details of the Indian Mythology will not bear so exact a 
scrutiny as the Mussulman creed of "Thalaba f but it had the 
inestimable merit of investing the names ot the Hindoo divinities 
with a familiarity, and also with a sublimity, such as they had 
never had before.
.\ well known pupil of my own, Thomas French, 
329 
now the venerated Bishop of Lahore, went out as a missionary 
to Agra.
I gave him as a parting present, Southey's "Kehama." 
He kept it, he afterwards told me, all through the trying scenes of 
the Indian Mutiny; and when the College at Agra was in those 
troublous days scattered to the winds, he still retained with 
grateful affection this earliest introduction to the old religions 
of India.
Let me read two or three passages where, into the depths of 
Indian Mythology, is infused, without violating the general con- 
tinuity of the story, the most beautiful touches of Christian senti- 
ment, such as he imagines might have illuminated even those dark 
corners of the earth.
[See " Kehama," Part XIX., " Mount 
Calasay."] 
There is one other class of poems : those whicli are purely 
personal ; and here we return to the point from which we started.
Of these I will only select two, " The Holly Tree," and " The 
Library." The latter relates specially to the poet's home in 
Keswick.
This day for the first time in my life I have penetrated 
into Greta Hall ; and by the kindness of its present occupants, I 
was allowed to go into every apartment, and amongst others into 
Southey's library.
It was a great satisfaction to think that in a 
chamber so long consecrated, and the scene of such indefatigable 
work there should still go on the work of useful and faithful 
instruction.
Not now are the walls clad with the books that 
used to clothe them as with an everlasting drapery, but I call to 
mind one of the most beautiful poems, — one of the most touching 
and affecting, because I feel how every word came from the 
poet's heart.
He speaks about his hours in that library, about his 
hours amongst the books of the great and good, from whom he 
learned so much, and from whom also he endeavoured to teach 
others : — 
" My days among the Dead are passed ; 
Around nie I behold, 
Where'er these casual eyes are cast, 
The mighty minds of old : 
My never-failing friends are they, 
With whom I converse day by day.
330 
With them I take dehght in weal 
Aud seek relief in woe ; 
And while I understand and feel 
How much to them I owe, 
My cheeks have often been bedew'd 
With tears of thoughtful gratitude.
My thoughts are with the Dead ; with them 
I live in long past years.
Their virtues love, their faults condemn, 
Partake their hopes and fears, 
And from their lessons seek and find 
Instruction with an humble mind.
My hopes are with the Dead ; anon 
My place with them will be, 
And I with them shall travel on 
Through all Futurity ; 
Yet, leaving here a name, I trust, 
That will not perish in the dust."

[Those marked C are preserved in the Carlisle collection, and 
those marked K in the Keswick Museum.
It is not supposed that 
this is a complete list of all the birds ever found in Cumberland, 
but it is hoped that the publication of such a list may be interesting 
to local naturalists, and may prompt members of the Association 
and others to present, as occasion offers, the specimens still 
wanting in either museum.
It should be added that local 
(i.

Our Association has now reached the end of the thirteenth 
year since its inauguration, and the Committee, in presenting the 
annual Report for 1879-80, has to express the satisfaction with 
which it reviews the work achieved within the past winter.
The Session was opened by a public Conversazione held in 
the Town Hall, which was elaborately decorated for the occasion, 
with works of art, mottoes, and evergreens.
The decorations 
contributed in an evident degree to the enjoyment of the evening.
The President's address was devoted to a special phase of scientific 
thought, in the form of an able resume of Dalton's Atomic Theory, 
illustrated during the evening by a series of beautiful experiments 
on radiant matter, conducted by the lecturer, who used for that 
purpose, the celebrated vacuum tubes recently invented by Dr.
Crookes.
Exclusive of the opening address, there have been delivered 
at the Ordinary Meetings, four lectures on scientific subjects, four 
on literary subjects, two on the application of scientific data to the 
actual wants of social life, one on political economy, and one on 
the theory of government.
From this brief analysis, it will be seen that Science and 
Literature are not studied altogether apart from the real and 
inseparable bearing which, rightly regarded, they must be acknow- 
ledged to have over the practical interests of the community.
In 
fact, the raison d'etre of public institutions such as ours, is not 
properly comprehended, if their promoters do not constantly strive 
to attain the practical.
The attendance upon the lectures has been very encouraging, 
and several of them were delivered to large audiences.
To those gentlemen who have so generously placed at the 
service of the Association their time and energy, in the preparation 
and delivery of these lectures, the Committee begs to tender its 
sincere thanks.
It may not be generally known that Dr. Nicholson, 
F.R.S.E., D.Sc, M.D., who holds the distinguished position of 
Professor of Natural History at the University of St. x'\ndrew's, 
and who lectured before the County Associations with so much 
approbation, is by birth a Cumbrian.
His lecture on "The 
Nature of Life," was a skilful endeavour to make as clear as the 
structure of the subject would permit, the vital issues involved in 
an investigation of what is, perhaps, the most problematic question 
in the whole range of modern scientific research.
It it is to be regretted that while, on the one hand, the 
productive resources of the Association, as an educational means, 
have been satisfactorily developed, the material sources of its 
prosperity have, on the other hand, become weakened.
In point 
of numbers, there are twenty members less on the register this year 
than last ; and, against a loss of thirty, there can only be placed a 
gain of sixteen new members.
This exceptionally large decrease, 
however, includes the loss by removal from town of twenty-two 
members, so that the falling off cannot be justly traced to any lack 
of interest in the work of the Association.
The actual number 
now on the register is 269, comprising 80 Associates and 189 
Non-Associates.
For the information of those who may not already be aware 
of the advantages accruing from Associateship, it may be mentioned 
that an Associate Member alone has the right to make use of the 
library, and to receive each year, free of charge, a copy of the 
Transactions of the Cumberland Association.
The Library, which is now a special feature of our Association, 
contains about one hundred and sixty-five volumes, and it is the 
intention of the Sub-Committee of Management to supply through 
it a defect which has hitherto been keenly felt to exist in connexion 
with other public libraries in town, the want, namely, of permanent 
access to the best and newest literature on Science, Philosophy, 
Biography, and Belles Lettres.
Although only in the third year of 
its existence, it is already fairly rich in helps to the student of 
Literature and Science.
Under the able chairmanship of Mr. Joseph Adair, the 
Botanical section has assumed such self-importance as to necessitate 
a special report being prepared ; and a similar remark applies to 
the Museum, under the admirable supervision of Mr. Welby 
I'Anson, M.B., than whom a more competent curator could not be 
desired.
These three sections of Associational work have become 
quiet but effective means for the spread of scientific culture.
Members may do much to increase their utility by gifts of books, 
plants, or scientific and antiquarian objects.
In this way, things 
which have merely yielded pleasure and instruction to an individual 
possessor, may be made to yield like boons to the many.
The Committee desires to draw attention to an alteration in 
the Constitution of the Cumberland Association, which has been 
brought about by the action of your representatives at the Council 
of the Union, and which will enable your Hon. Treasurer to effect 
a saving in the expenditure of monies.
The basis on which this 
financial question has been arranged, may be thus stated.
There 
are at the present time nine Scientific and Literary Associations 
affiliated under the shelter of the Cumberland Association for the 
Advancement of Literature and Science, the Constitution of which 
provides that, for the protection of the interests of the individual 
Associations, and for the proper government of the whole, each 
Association shall furnish two delegates to a general Council, and 
contribute to its support a capitation grant levied on the whole of 
the members of the County Associations collectively.
It was, 
however, found by your Committee, that while reaping no greater 
benefit from the Union than other Associations, your Association 
was paying into its exchequer about twice as much as the next 
largest Association, and as compared with the younger Associations, 
three and four times as much.
In its early days, when the 
Cumberland Association was a nursling, so to speak, and needing 
all the support it could obtain, your Committee did not feel called 
upon to suggest a more equitable readjustment of the capitation 
grant paid by this Association ; but as the Union grew in strength, 
year by year, it was considered that the time for action had arrived, 
and your delegates are pleased to report that the Council, after 
careful consideration, agreed to reduce the grant by fifty per cent, 
on the 151st and every succeeding member, not only of the White- 
haven Association, but of all the affiliated Associations.
Your Committee feels that this Report would be incomplete 
without paying a tribute of respect to the memory of the late Rev.
J. CUfton Ward, F.G.S., Rydal Vicarage, Ambleside, who, since 
its formation, has acted so efficiently as Secretary to the Cumber- 
land Association for the Advancement of Literature and Science, 
and the intelligence of whose sudden decease, at the comparatively 
early age of thirty-seven years, has been received by each member 
of your Committee with feelings of deep sorrow.
The Committee 
feels assured that, in putting on permanent record the expression 
of such sorrow, it is giving but an inadequate interpretation to the 
genuine feeling of all the members of this Association.
We have, 
indeed, much reason to deplore the sad event.
Our late County 
Secretary embodied in himself, in no small measure, most of those 
purely personal and mental qualities which are so essential to the 
ultimate success of a man who, earnestly, and with single intent, 
works for the social and intellectual development of his fellow-men.
Possessed of powers of social attraction, which gained him a circle 
of disinterested friendships wherever he went, and gifted with more 
than an average share of intellectual ability, no less than with fine 
practical faculties of organization, he reduced to method and 
distinctness every scheme on which he brought to bear the force 
of his clear intellect.
The day has almost gone past, when it needs 
to be pointed out that, to him, was due the idea of uniting the 
isolated County Associations into one representative whole ; and 
that to him, likewise, were chiefly due the business energy and 
tact which moulded that idea to a practical and successful issue.
It may be truly said, that his praises are in the mouth of all the 
Associations ; and that, perhaps, the most fitting monument which 
could be erected to his memory, he has himself built up with his 
own hands, to be a centre of broad human culture and beneficent 
influences.
His love for science was scarcely excelled by the 
earnest enthusiasm with which he strove, both by means of speech 
and the press, to make its truths known.
No lectures in White- 
haven were more looked forward to with interest, or more largely 
attended, than his ; and the causes of his popularity are not far 
to seek.
The true secret of his powers as a lecturer, lay in the 
thorough knowledge of his subject which he invariably possessed, 
combined with a gift which is equally indispensable to success — 
that gift, namely, of clear, logical, incisive exposition, which 
thorough mastery alone commands, and which evolves from the 
mass of material under manipulation, a perfectly simple, intelligible, 
and coherent whole, without at the same time sacrificing depth of 
insight, or the necessary fulness of fact.
He is gone from us in 
10 
the prime of his manhood, a martyr, in the truest sense of the 
term, to over-incessant activities for the good of his kind, which 
have tended to exhaust the nervous energy of a physical frame 
originally not too strong.
He is gone just when, amidst the calm 
and beauty of nature, and the sweeter calm of a happy home circle, 
life was opening out to him a settled and peaceful prospect of 
many years service in ministering to the highest spiritual wants of 
those who surrounded him.
He is gone !
But in the brighter days 
which are yet to dawn, his name will ever be linked with the 
history of the rise and progress of the first organized system of 
Scientific and Literary culture in our native county.
In view of 
the future well-being of the Affiliated Associations, it is to be 
earnestly hoped that another gentleman may soon be found to 
carry on our late Secretary's work ; but it will, without doubt, be 
difficult to replace him by one in whose individuality shall be 
blended so much love, enthusiasm, and energy for the cause of 
science and humanity, as were manifest in the life and character of 
our much-lamented co-worker, the Rev. Mr.
Ward.
Museum Report.
A first report generally marks the springing into life of a new 
institution.
Such, however, is not the case with our Museum, 
which dates almost from the first commencement of the Society.
At our earlier meetings, objects of interest were frequently 
exhibited and explained.
Many of these were afterwards presented 
to the Society, and thus laid the foundation of the collection we 
now possess.
Amongst the earlier donors were Dr. Jones of Aspatria, who 
presented a series of specimens from the coal measures of Aspatria; 
the late Mrs. Pratten of Haile, to whom we are indebted for a very 
valuable collection of British plants, and for a cabinet of British 
insects — probably the most perfect that is in the possession of any 
similar society.
Mr. G.
Harrison presented a number of minerals 
collected and named by himself; and the late Mr. Rooke, who 
was known to most of us as an energetic and capable field 
naturalist, gave us a large collection of shells, especially illustrating 
the Molluscan Fauna of the neighbourhood, and first endeavoured 
to arrange and classify the collection.
11 
The Museum now contains specimens illustrating Geology, 
Mineralogy, Pateontology, Botany, Zoology, Archaeology, a few of 
the Arts and Sciences, and a number of specimens which may be 
arranged under the title of Miscellaneous.
For purposes of description, these may be divided into British 
and Foreign, the former more particularly representing the neigh- 
bourhood.
The Foreign specimens comprise many of the minerals, 
about half of the coins, a few of the Botanical and Zoological 
series, and most of the Miscellaneous.
With the British collection we are more immediately interested, 
illustrating, as it does, the life history of the country in which we 
live.
Eminently a mining district, West Cumberland should be 
well represented by minerals.
Those we possess comprise chiefly 
the various ores of iron, lead, and copper.
Cornwall provides us 
with tin ; and ores of silver and manganese we have also.
The Mountain Limestone of the district provides us with a 
large series of fossils.
Unfortunately, no record has been kept of 
the localities from which these are derived, consequently their 
value as a collection is very greatly diminished.
Future donors of 
fossils will, therefore, render a great service, by indicating the 
formation and locality in which their specimens are found.
Owing 
to the difficulty of correctly naming them, the arrangement of the 
fossils has not yet been commenced, and will probably be a work 
of time.
The Archaeological collection includes a number of coins, 
specimens of Roman pottery (the origin of which I do not know), 
and a number of drawings of fragments from St. Bees, admirably 
described by Canon Knowles, to whom I am indebted for aid in 
deciphering several of the coins.
I would suggest that the 
drawings should be placed in a portfolio, where they would be 
most effectually preserved.
The Botanical collection embraces that of Mrs. Pratten ; and, 
within the last fortnight, has been further increased by two hundred 
and fifty specimens of plants collected in this district during last 
summer by the Botanical section of the Association, of which Mr.
Adair is President.
When complete, this collection will be most 
valuable.
The specimens will be placed in the drawers of a 
cabinet in the library, along with a number of the London Cata- 
12 
logue, for the information of members who are interested in the 
Flora of the district.
Until lately, the Zoological department comprised chiefly the 
collections of Mr. Rooke and Mrs. Pratten ; but, during the last 
year it has been greatly enriched by a number of marine animals 
presented by Mr. E.
Dobson, to whose zeal in working out the 
Marine Fauna of this coast, the Society is very greatly indebted.
During the past year I have cleaned and mounted the shells 
and minerals, and the specimens presented by Mr. Dobson.
Many 
of the shells required re-naming, and they have been arranged 
according to the British Mollusca of Professor Forbes.
The Star- 
fishes have also been named according to the same author ; the 
Zoophytes after Professor Johnston ; and the Crustacea after 
Professor Bell.
The minerals will be arranged in their natural 
orders of the Oxidized Stones, the Saline Stones, and the Inflam- 
mables ; while the Ores will be arranged in groups, according as 
they represent iron, copper, etc., since we do not possess sufficient 
specimens to follow any other arrangement.
On the underside of 
the cards on which the minerals are mounted will be found a brief 
description of their chemical composition and system of crystal- 
lization.
During the last twelve months, specimens have been presented 
by Messrs.
Dobson, B.
Taylor, Nelson, Murray, Dr. I'Anson, and 
Mrs. Bell.
I have to thank these members for their donations, 
and hope that next year we may be able to chronicle a larger list.
I would draw attention to the fact that the Museum is, at 
present, totally unprovided with means for preserving specimens of 
animals in a fresh condition.
It would be a pity that valuable 
specimens should be spoiled for want of proper means of displaying 
them.
A small annual sum, set aside as a Museum Fund, would 
therefore be well bestowed, and it might be made to cover needful 
repairs for cases, etc.
I cannot conclude this report without expressing a hope that 
a greater amount of use will be made of the Museum than has 
hitherto been the case.
One evening, at least, in the Session 
might be set aside for the explanation and discussion of new 
specimens ; and I believe that this would not only be profitable to 
the members, but would lead to larger additions being made to the 
collection.
A tank of sea water might also be kept in the room 
adjoining the Museum, in which such animals as may be brought 
in alive might be studied by those interested in Zoology.
I may 
add, that a Catalogue of the Collection is being prepared, which I 
hope to finish before the end of next Session.
Report of the Botanical Section.
The members of this section have just terminated the past 
year's work to-day, by handing over to the curator the specimens 
of flowering plants and Equiseta gathered and preserved during the 
season.
It will be remembered that last summer the weather was 
cold and rainy, and generally of a broken and uncertain character, 
and, consequently, a most unfavourable one for the field botanist.
There were many excursions planned, most of which were frustrated 
by the inclemency of the weather ; so that individual members 
were left in a great measure to their own resources.
The total number of plants observed in the district by the 
members is about five hundred and fifty, of which number two 
hundred and fifty species have been collected and preserved, and 
are now handed to the curator to be added to the Museum, as 
their contribution for the past year.
Although a great number of the specimens which have been 
preserved and mounted are widely distributed, and consequently 
of common occurrence, there are in the collection many species of 
a local or rare character, amongst which may be mentioned — 
Meconopsis cambrica, Brassica monensis, Claytonia perfoliata, 
Hypericum elodes, gathered by Mr. Kendal ; Serratula tinctoria.
Inula Helenium, and Primula farinosa, by Mr. Wm.
Nixon; and 
Utricularia intermedia, Parietaria diffusa, and other interesting 
species contributed by Mr. J.
Nixon ; Saxifraga aizoides, Saxifraga 
stellaris, and Melica uniflora by Mr. Jos.
Adair ; Festuca vivipera 
by Mr. Wm.
Adair.
A number of Carices, many of which are of rare occurrence, 
have been sent by Mr. William Hodgson of Watermillock, to whom 
the best thanks of the members of the section is due.
Messrs.
W. I'Anson and W.
H. Kitchen each furnished a list 
of plants observed, both of which contained the names of species of 
rare occurrence.
Specimens of these will be preserved for the 
next collection.
14 
The members of the section feel, there is a very wide field of 
observation before them, embracing, as it does, an extended sea 
beach, a pastoral and well-wooded country, backed by the gentle 
hills and high mountains of West Cumberland, and affording an 
infinite variety of soil and situation for the growth of plants.
At the close of the next season, they hope to be able to add 
another contribution of dried specimens of plants, at least equal to 
that made on the present occasion.

The Committee, in presenting this report, are sorry to record 
a falling off in the number of members, to the extent of thirteen.
In last session, there were one hundred and sixty-two ; there are 
now only one hundred and forty-nine on the books.
Of these 
one hundred and forty pay three shillings and sixpence ; the 
remaining nine are under age, and pay two shillings and sixpence 
each.
This decline in the numbers has been mainly caused by 
removals and deaths, or by fewer members joining the Society in 
the session just concluded than had previously done.
There were 
twenty-two new names added in 1878-9, but only nineteen in the 
session for 1879 and 80.
While we have reason to regret this, 
still we may congratulate the Society on the state of its funds, as 
will be seen from the Treasurer's report, which shows a balance of 
fifteen pounds in our favour, and which is now carried forward to 
next year's credit.
The particulars will be presented to you in the 
Treasurer's balance sheet.
There have been eight lectures during 
the session, on a variety of subjects, including history, physiology, 
poetry, fine arts, and personal travel, and they have been fairly 
well attended by the members, but non-members have not come to 
the lectures so numerously as before, perhaps because the price of 
admission has been raised to threepence, as against one penny of 
previous sessions.
The amount taken from non-members for 
attendance at lectures has been ^^5 os.
7d., compared with 
;£,2 14s.
2d.
last year.
There have been seven papers read at the 
ordinary meetings, consisting of biography, natural history, science, 
etc., besides one open night, at which there was a lively debate on 
the land question ; and at the ordinary meetings, discussions some- 
times followed the papers.
With regard to the ordinary meetings 
16 
falling due for March 29th and April 5 th, your Committee thought 
it best to postpone them, in consequence of the General Election 
and the Easter Holidays, and as the season is now so far advanced, 
they have resolved to make the present meeting the last for this 
session.
In the month of February and the beginning of March, the 
Rev. J.
Clifton Ward delivered a course of lectures on " Our 
Mountains, and how we came by them;" also a supplemental 
lecture upon "Glacial action in the Lake District." These lectures 
were delivered in the Keswick Museum, and were well illustrated 
by the model, plans, and specimens which are in that collection.
The attendance was very good, and consisted principally of 
working people, who showed a great deal of interest in the subject 
and the popular way in which Mr. Ward placed it before them.
During last summer, the Society had three excursions, or field 
days.
The first was to Comb Gill and Barf, attended by thirty- 
nine members and friends.
The second, round Skiddaw, by way 
of Threlkeld, Mosedale, Carrock Fell, Caldbeck, etc., attended by 
forty-eight persons.
The third, by Newlands to Dale Head, and 
so round by Rosthwaite.
This was attended by eighty-nine 
persons, many of them being members of the Cockermouth Society.
The Committee have the pleasure to report that these excursions, 
attended by a total of one hundred and seventy-six members and 
friends, have been conducted without any cost whatever to the 
funds of the Society.
They have just paid their own expenses.
The Committee have also to report that they have settled all 
claims upon the Society up to the present date, leaving a clear 
page for next session.
It was resolved to grant five pounds from the balance in hand 
to the funds of the Keswick Library for the purchase of books.
It was also resolved to grant the cost of the notice board, 
erected at the entrance of the field in which the " Druids' Circle " 
is situated.
The election of officers for the ensuing session was concluded 
as follows: — President, Rev. A.
Howson ; Vice-President, Rev.
Canon Harford Battersby ; Hon.-Secretary, Mr. Wm.
Wood ; 
Hon.
-Treasurer, Mr. Edwin Jackson.

There has been a falling off in our numbers, and the 
attendance at the meetings has not been so good as we could have 
wished.
This may be partly accounted for by the very bad 
weather we had last Session.
The hope is entertained, however, 
that the new and more numerous Committee appointed at our 
last meeting, may be the means of securing a larger attendance, 
and also of promoting the success of our Association.
The Committee, at the beginning of the Session, determined 
to follow the example of some of the other Societies, and to hold 
alternately public and ordinary'meetings ; this appears to have been 
fairly appreciated, and should, we think, be continued.

not as much as might have been expected, considering the popu- 
lation.
The number of members on the books is 103, as against 83 
last year.
The Committee beg to express their thanks to those friends 
from other Societies, who favoured them with Papers, and trust 
to receive a continuance of such help.
It is with the utmost sorrow the Committee have heard of the 
death of the Society's earliest and best friend, the Rev. J.
Clifton 
Ward, F.G.S. We shall miss his cheerful assistance and instructive 
lectures more than we can express.

In presenting their Fourth Annual Report, the Committee 
has, with pleasure, again to record a very gratifying increase, 
though not so much in the number of members as in the general 
attendance at the various meetings.
In this latter respect, a 
marked improvement has taken place as compared with that of 
21 
the first and second Session.
This success is, they hope, a proof 
of the growing estimation in which the Society is held, and is, 
doubtless, owing to the excellent way in which the various lectures, 
etc., were delivered, as also to the varied and popular nature of 
the same.
There were nine ordinary meetings, and seven public 
lectures.
Hearty thanks are due to all those gentlemen who have 
so kindly given their services.
The following new Honorary 
Members have been elected during the Session : — 
Rev. T.
J. Cooper, M.A.
Rev. Canon Carr.
Prof.
H. A.
Nicholson, M.D., D.Sc, F.R.S.E.
Rev. W.
Sherwen.
Last year there were one hundred and three members, and 
seventeen new ones have been enrolled, whilst ten have been left 
off the roll owing to death, removals from the district, etc.
Financially, the Society is in a prosperous condition.
Last year 
there was a small deficit, owing to a heavy outlay on the Phono- 
graphic exhibition ; but this year there is a satisfactory working 
balance.
The Subscription is ^s., and the Transactions have been given 
free.
Notices are sent round to each member previous to any 
meeting, and they are also sent to the general public on the 
occasion of the public lectures, which are free to all.
Non- 
members have been admitted to the ordinary meetings on pay- 
ment of sixpence each, with satisfactory results.
The names of the 
members have been printed along with the programmes.
The Committee deeply feels the great loss the Society has 
sustained through the death of the Rev. J.
CHfton Ward, and 
trusts that the Council may be fortunate in selecting a worthy 
successor.

The Session was opened on Nov. 4th last year, by the 
late esteemed and lamented Secretary of the Association, the 
Rev. J.
Clifton Ward, F.G.S., &c., delivering a most interesting 
and instructive lecture on " Ocean Life." Since that time, six 
Public Lectures, and nineteen Ordinary Meetings have been held, 
exclusive of the Conversazione.
The average attendance at both 
the public lectures and the ordinary meetings, has been very fair.
The Committee are much indebted, and desire to express 
their sincere thanks, to those Gentlemen who so kindly came 
forward and delivered valuable lectures ; also to the members of 
the Society who read papers at the ordinary meetings.
The past has been a most successful Session, and the Com- 
mittee look forward to the next being even more successful.
It is 
intended to hold Field Meetings in connection with the Society, 
at places of interest in the locality of Longtown, on the first 
Saturday in each month, during the summer.
The Session was brought to a close on Thursday Evening, 
April 29th, when a Social Tea and Conversazione was held, at 
which a considerable number of members and friends attended.
After Tea — which was generously provided by J.
R. Armstrong, 
Esq.
— a programme consisting of songs, readings, recitations, etc., 
was creditably performed, and a most enjoyable evening was 
spent by all present.

The Committee have much pleasure in presenting their Third 
Annual Report, and have again to congratulate themselves upon 
the success which has attended their efforts.
During the summer and autumn of 1879, the Society had 
five field meetings, which were everywhere successful.
The Com- 
mittee hope that the diffusion of knowledge on these occasions, 
will lead many of the members to take a greater interest in the 
subjects brought before them, than what has hitherto been the 
case.
At the first, on ^Vhit-Monday, to Bowness-on-Solway, three 
Papers were read, viz : — " How to Enjoy a Field Excursion," by 
the Rev. T.
Cooper ; " The Archaeology of the District," by J.
Jackson ; " The Natterjack Toad," by T.
Duckworth.
The next 
excursion was a visit to the Old Volcanoes of Cumberland, under 
the guidance of the late Rev. J.
Clifton Ward.
And here the 
Committee may well pay a passing tribute to the memory of him 
who has so suddenly been called away ; who was a guide and 
helper in all their difficulties, and who was ever ready to assist 
them by his genial counsel and advice and his rare talents ; to whom 
this Society, along with others, owes much of its present prosperity.
The third excursion was to Rose Castle.
On this occasion, the 
Society received a good deal of information on the Botany of the 
District, from the Rev. Canon Carr.
Mr. Jackson read a paper on 
" Inglewood Forest ; " Mr. George Dawson contributed one on the 
Natural History of the Neighbourhood ; and Mr. C.
J. Ferguson 
gave a concise and effective description of Rose Castle.
The fourth excursion was to Shawk Beck and Quarries, where 
the Rev. R.
Wood, Rosley, entertained the members present with 
an account of the Botany of the District ; and Mr. W.
B. Dodd, 
with its Geology ; and Mr. T.
Duckworth read a short paper on 
"The Glowworm." 
The fifth field meeting was held, through the kindness of 
E. Behrens, Esq., in Corby Woods, and was principally devoted to 
" Fungi." Dr. Carlyle kindly acted as cicerone on the occasion.
At a meeting held in the Museum on the following evening, Dr.
Carlyle pointed out the differences between the Edible and the 
26 
Poisonous Fungi, and mentioned the different localities where they 
were to be procured.
The Winter Lectures were postponed for some time, owing to 
the support this Society gave to the Cambridge University Exten- 
sion Lectures.
A course of eleven Lectures was given by R.
D- 
Roberts, M.A., on " Physical Geography," and, at the conclusion, 
twenty-six candidates presented themselves for examination, of 
whom five passed in the first class — one with distinction, and sixteen 
in the second class.
The Committee are pleased to learn, that these 
lectures have been successful in a pecuniary respect.
After this course of lectures was finished, a very able Address 
was given by the President, R.
Ferguson, Esq., M.P.
On the whole, the lectures and the evening meetings were 
well attended.
Two rooms have been added to the Museum, which has been 
cleaned and re-arranged.
The Harkness Collection has been provisionally arranged, by 
Mr. J.
G. Goodchild and Mr. Colvin, to whom the Museum Com- 
mittee are much indebted ; also to the former, for his advice and 
assistance in many other ways.
The Committee contributed ;^i5 
out of the Society's funds towards the expense of the cases for the 
Harkness Collection.
During the past Session, the Committee have distributed 
about 170 copies of the Transactions., and will continue to distribute 
as subscriptions are received and new members enrolled.
About 
forty new members have been enrolled since last year.
The Committee would urge upon the members of this Society, 
the advisability of procuring for the Museum all objects of local 
interest, which should be accompanied, as much as possible, by 
notes relating to any points of interest, and should be placed in 
the charge of the different sub-curators appointed by the Museum 
Committee, a list of whom may be seen in the Museum.

Twenty-nine Members have been elected during the year, and 
the number now on the books is one hundred and ninety.
On May 29th, 1879, the Society had a very interesting Field 
Day; Tilberthwaite Ghyll and Coniston being visited under the 
leadership of the Rev. J.
C. Ward.
The Conversazione, by which the Winter Session was opened, 
was largely attended, and the Committee have to acknowledge the 
assistance and support which they received from Members of the 
Society and others, who kindly lent many objects of interest on 
the occasion.
There have been five Public Lectures and six Ordinary 
Meetings.
The Lectures have been generally well attended ; but 
the attendance at the Ordinary Meetings has been unequal.

In presenting the First Annual Report of the above Society, 
the Committee are to be congratulated upon the successful results 
of its operations.
The Society was formed in October, 1879, with the object of 
cultivating a taste for Literature and Science, by means of Public 
Lectures, and the reading of papers on such subjects, by Members 
of the Society and others.
The total number of Members now on the books reaches 126.
The Session was commenced by a Conversazione, which was 
well attended, and was, in fact, from every point of view, a most 
gratifying success.
The President, the Rev. W.
Home, M.A., 
30 
gave an address upon the advantages of Literary and Scientific 
knowledge.
The thanks of the Society are particularly due to those friends 
who kindly gave the use of various articles for exhibition, on that 
interesting occasion.
During the Session there have been eleven meetings, exclusive 
of the Conversazione and the Annual Business Meeting.
The 
meetings were held fortnightly, and, on the whole, proved most 
interesting and instructive.
Seven of these meetings were devoted 
to Scientific subjects, and the other five were generally of a Literary 
and miscellaneous character.
The attendance at each meeting has 
been highly satisfactory, and, in a few cases, a very crowded room 
testified unmistakably to the ability and popularity of the lecturer 
The financial position of the Society (judging from the Balance 
Sheet submitted by the Treasurer) appears to be in a very satis- 
factory state ; and the balance being on the right side, it is evident 
that there is yet a greater scope for the Society to widen its 
operations and extend its usefulness.
The formation of this Society was originally suggested by the 
late Rev. J.
Clifton Ward, who died so unexpectedly a short time 
ago ; and the Committee deeply regret the loss of his valuable 
services.
The Committee would be glad to see the Members take a 
more active part in the discussion at the close of each lecture at 
the ordinary meetings.
By doing so, it is possible to gain a better 
insight into many details of the subject, which necessarily, can be 
but briefly touched upon by the Lecturer.
In conclusion, it is to be hoped that our important Institution 
may continue to flourish, and that its objects may be carried out 
with untiring zeal, to the benefit of our fellow-men.

Report of l^ssocmtion ^tcxtim^, (pro.
tern.) 
Although we cannot this year record any addition to the 
number of affiliated Societies, still there is an increase in the 
aggregate number of members, there being now 12 13 against 113 1 
at the date of last report.
The numbers in the different affiliated Societies are as 
follows: — Whitehaven, 260; Keswick, 150; Cockermouth, 64; 
Workington, 103; Maryport, 106; Longtown, 43 ; Carlisle, 190; 
Ambleside, 171 ; Silloth, 126.
The Public Lecturer, Professor H.
A. Nicholson, M.D., D.Sc, 
F.R.S.E., seems to have given general satisfaction.
The total cost 
to each of the Societies was ^2 i-js.
6d, a sum of ;^i2 12s.
having been devoted towards the expenses out of the Association 
Funds.
Financially, the Association is not in quite such a flourishing 
condition, on account of the largely increased expenditure for the 
Transactions.

WARD MEMORIAL FUND.
After the death of the late Rev. J.
C. Ward, a meeting of the 
representatives of the Cumberland Association was held, for the 
purpose of deciding what steps should be taken in order to give 
fitting expression to the regard felt for him by the members of the 
Association and his friends generally.
It was considered that this object would be best attained by 
giving each of the Affiliated Societies an opportunity of contributing 
towards a General Fund — part to be devoted to the erection of a 
Memorial Tablet in Rydal Church, and the balance to be set apart 
as a contribution towards the sum.

his daughters.

INAUGURAL ADDRESS 
TO THE 
CARLISLE SCIENTIFIC SOCIETY AND FIELD 
NATURALISTS' CLUB.
(Delivered at Carlisle, December Tpih, iSjg.J 
By ROBERT FERGUSON, M.P.
(President.) 
When I was first invited by your Secretary to address you, it 
was naturally a matter of consideration with me in what manner I 
should speak to you upon a subject of which I have made no 
special study, and in regard to most of the details of which many 
of your members are doubtless better instructed than I can be.
But then it occurred to me that any one who has been in the 
world so long as I have, must, in the course of his life, have 
observed some things, and read of some things, and thought of 
some things which, though without any special scientific training, 
it might be of interest for him to communicate, even if it were 
mainly only in the way of suggestion.
On this principle, then, I propose to address you, giving you, 
as far as occasion offers, my own ideas and impressions.
I may be 
a little discursive, and I may be occasionally subject to scientific 
correction, but I have thought that it would be, on the whole, the 
most agreeable, and possibly the most useful course of proceeding.
But, in the first place, I think it will be in accordance with an 
address of this sort that I should endeavour to give you — though, 
necessarily, for the most part at second-hand — some account of 
the results which have been obtained in that particular field of 
investigation towards which the attention of scientific observers has 
36 
in a rather special manner been of late years directed, and with 
which the address of the President of the British Association, 
Professor Allman, was mainly occupied.
The problem is one of the deepest interest, and one of the 
greatest importance.
What is the basis of physical life in man and 
animals?
where does it reside?
to what primal condition can we 
trace it ?
and to what extent is the basis of life the same in the 
animal as in the vegetable world?
Well, they have succeeded in 
tracing it to a substance to which they have given the name of 
protoplasm, and which they assert to be the basis of all life both 
in the animal and in the vegetable world.
Protoplasm is a word 
which often comes before us now, and will doubtless still more 
frequently in the future ; but it is not very easy to understand 
exactly what is its meaning.
When we are told that protoplasm is 
physically a clear, viscid, jelly-like substance ; that chemically it is 
very little different from the white of an egg ; and that it may be 
resolved into the elements carbon, oxygen, hydrogen, and nitrogen, 
with a slight trace of sulphur and of phosphorus, I do not think 
that we feel very much wiser, and perhaps we may succeed in 
getting a better idea of its nature by means of illustration.
When we see any one of the more highly organised animals, 
with all its organs beautifully adapted for their respective uses — 
limbs with which to move, nerves with which to feel, mouth, 
stomach, and other organs with which to feed — we naturally say, 
these are but parts of a machine, and there must be some force, 
some principle behind, which puts all this beautiful and complex 
machinery in motion.
But if you were to see a thing which could 
move, though it had no organs of any kind for progression ; which 
could feel, though it was destitute of anything whatever in the 
shape of nerves; which could feed, though it had no mouth, and 
no stomach, and no alimentary organs of any kind — a thing which 
seemed to be in effect nothing more than an animated bit of jelly 
— you would naturally say, " Here we have something beyond 
which we cannot get — something which seems to contain that 
principle, whatever it is, which is at the very bottom of life." 
Well, there is such a thing, and that is precisely the descrip- 
;i7 
tion which scientific observers give of it, or in other words, they 
say that it is a bit of protoplasm.
This is a microscopic animal- 
cule found in stagnant waters, to which they have given the name 
of the Frotamoeba primitiva.
The origin of the name is this — 
there was an animalcule before known to us under the name of 
the proteus animalcule, so called from its incessant changes of 
shape, similar to the one in question, but not so utterly destitute 
of organism.
This they now call the Auiceba, a name which in 
Greek has the same meaning, " the changing." And then when 
this still more primitive creature was discovered, in order to dis- 
tinguish it from tbe other, they gave it the name of Frotamveba 
primitiva, " first or earliest primitive Amoeba" a name in which 
science seems to struggle to express the exceedingly primitive 
nature of the creature.
It moves, though it has no organs of any kind 
for progression ; its characteristic is constant and incessant move- 
ment, constant and incessant changes of shape.
At one time it 
appears like a thread long drawn out ; at another it takes a shape, 
it may be, more resembling some kind of flower ; so that in point 
of fact you cannot tell what shape it is, or whether it has any shape 
at all.
Now this characteristic of incessant motion is an important 
one to attend to, for it is a special characteristic of protoplasm, 
i.e., motion without an object or an aim, but rather as an innate 
and essential condition of its existence.
Then it feeds, though it 
has no mouth and no stomach and no alimentary organs whatever.
It seems to feed, so to speak, with its whole body.
When it meets 
with that which is good for it to eat — presumably a smaller speck 
of protoplasm than itself — it envelopes it with its own substance, 
wraps itself, so to speak, around it, and the one seems to melt 
away into the other.
Then it feels — as it must do, to know when 
it meets with anything — although it is utterly destitute of anything 
in the shape of nerves.
This then is the simplest form of life with which we are at 
present acquainted, and it is upon the existence of such forms of 
life as this that the theory of the protoplasmic basis of life mainly 
depends.
I will ask leave to digress a little from the main subject 
38 
in order to refer to a point in which the Amoeba is of interest to us 
as affording a type of the manner in which the human frame has 
been put together.
The Amoeba, as the simplest form of life 
consists of a single cell — the human frame consists of a multiplicity 
of cells.
But man, in his inception, in his embryo state, also 
consists of but a single cell.
Now, the Amoeba has the property 
of spontaneously dividing itself into two parts, each part forming a 
perfect cell, a complete animal, and each going henceforth its own 
way, and leading its own life.
The primal cell in man also divides 
in two, but instead of separating, they remain united, and each 
fresh cell in its turn dividing to form another — thus bit by bit the 
hamssi foetus is put together.
I have spoken of the Protamaeba primitiva as the simplest 
form of life with which we are acquainted.
But only until 
scientific men have made up their minds about something else 
more recently discovered, and which seems to be, if possible, a 
still lower form of life.
There is a kind of slime, seeming to 
be endowed with motion, and therefore with life, which has 
been dredged up from the bottom of the sea, where many 
naturalists are of opinion it forms masses of living protoplasm.
To this they have given the name of Bathybius (Greek Bathus, 
depth, bios, life).
But, as I have said, scientific men are not as yet 
agreed about this substance ; for while Huxley, AUman, and the 
German physiologist Haeckel, have expressed their belief in the 
organic nature of Bathybius, the naturalists of the " Challenger " 
expedition say that in all their dredgings they never brought up 
anything like this.
Their theory is that this mobile, gelatinous 
substance, is nothing more than gelatinous sulphate of lime, 
precipitated from sea water by the strong spirits of wine the speci- 
mens were preserved in.
We must leave these distinguished men 
to fight it out among themselves ; and now, having endeavoured 
to get some idea of the nature of protoplasm, we come to the 
question — 
WHERE IS THE PROTOPLASM TO BE FOUND WHICH IS THE 
BASIS OF LIFE IN MAN ?
Man is pervaded with protoplasm — it lodges in the micro- 
scopic cavities of his bones, and especially it streams in the current 
39 
of his blood.
The white corpuscles of the human blood are things 
like the Amoeba— sQQn under the microscope they go through all 
those evolutions, those incessant movements, and those constant 
changes of shape which characterise protoplasmic creatures like the 
Atnobba.
And what seems remarkable, with due care they may even 
be kept alive after they have been taken from the human body.
It 
seems, then, that scientific observers, finding in the first place a thing 
which, like the Amoeba, seems to contain in itself the abstract 
principle of life, and then observing the presence of numberless 
such creatures, which must have their use in the blood of man, 
have come to the conclusion that these form an essential contri- 
bution to his vitality.
We can now perhaps get an idea as to the rationale of that 
most revolting remedy which has come into vogue of late in 
America, and I believe also in England, in cases of advanced 
consumption, which requires the patient to attend at the slaughter- 
house, and to drink a loathsome draught of the warm and yet 
living blood, as it flows from the slaughtered animal.
But, now, 
does there not seem to be, in the discoveries of modern science, a 
ground for the word which was spoken to the old Hebrews when 
it is said, "The blood thereof, which is the life thereof?'' 
I have referred to this subject of protoplasm partly because I 
thought it was appropriate to an address of this sort, and might be 
interesting to those who may not have heard it ortherwise, and 
partly because it leads up to something else upon which I have 
something to say.
What I now propose to bring before you is 
certain points of coincidence which recent discoveries have shown 
to exist between the animal and the vegetable world, the tendency 
of which is further to illustrate the unity of the system of creation.
And of all these points, the first, and perhaps the most important, 
is this — that the same principle of protoplasm is the basis of life in 
both.
The protoplasmic principle in plants is to be found occupying 
the interior of each cell of the interior tissue at one stage of its 
development, the harder substance forming the outer wall of each 
cell being secreted by the living principle within to form for itself 
a protection.
And if this plant-protoplasm is examined through 
40 
the microscope, it will be seen to possess all those properties of 
active and incessant motion by which protoplasm is invariably 
distinguished.
To this point, then, the researches of Science have been able 
to attain.
But mark this, that between the speck of protoplasm, 
which is the germ of the man that is to be, or of the mouse, or of 
the mushroom.
Science has not hitherto been able to discover any 
difference.
Whether a touch more of brimstone gives the ferocious 
creature, or a touch more of phosphorus the intellectual animal, is 
a secret which is not revealed to us.
We see, then, how far the 
vision of Science has been able to pierce ; how infinite is the gulf 
beyond, into which Science has not been able — perhaps, never may 
be able— even vaguely to peer !
The next point of coincidence between the animal and the 
vegetable world to which I wish to refer, is not, so far as we know, 
one of general application, but one which is confined to a few 
species of plants.
We have been accustomed to look upon the 
world of plants as affording no instance of what, in the animal 
world, we are accustomed to regard as a form of cruelty — the life 
of one animal being sacrificed in order to supply the wants of 
another.
Yet this is not so, for there are some plants, of which 
the Common Sun-dew may be given as an instance, which, though 
possessing the outward characteristics of the vegetable, yet, in some 
of their habits and modes of life, bear considerable resemblance to 
the carnivorous animals.
These plants subsist largely upon insects, 
which they catch, and kill, and eat, and digest ; and they would 
eagerly eat a piece of meat, if presented to them in a sufficiently 
small particle.
These plants, inasmuch as they do not, like the 
generality of other plants, draw most of their sustenance from the 
soil, do not require to have, and so have not, roots as well 
developed as most other plants.
What they do require is water, 
in order to form their digestive secretions.
As in man the digestive 
operation is performed by means of a juice, which is called the 
gastric juice, so in these plants digestion is performed by means of 
a secretion which, in its constitutents, is hardly to be distinguished 
from the gastric juice in man.
But in order to have juice you 
11 
must have water, and, therefore it is that these plants require 
water in order to form their digestive secretions.
Some of these insectivorous plants float upon the surface of 
the water, and so being in contact with the water, do not require, 
and so have not any roots at all.
A good example of this kind is 
to be found in the common Bladderwort ( Vtricularia ) of our 
ponds and ditches.
Others, not in immediate contact with water, 
but growing in marshy places, have very short roots, just sufficient 
to enable them to suck up water from the soil.
The insectivorous 
plant best known to us is, perhaps, the Common Sun-dew of our 
bogs and moorlands ( Drosera totundifolia).
This may be described 
as consisting of a saucer-shaped group of orbicular leaves, which 
are covered on the top by glandular hairs, each tipped with a clear 
transparent substance like a drop of dew, whence it derives its 
name.
But this substance is in reality of an exceedingly viscid 
and tenacious nature, so much so that any fly alighting on the 
plant, and once touching this, is at once held fast, and unable to 
make its escape.
At the same time the edges of the leaf which 
has been touched, begin slowly and gradually to curl upwards, 
until they meet at the top like the lid of a box.
The leaf of the 
plant now becomes, to all intents and purposes, an improvised 
stomach, within which the operation of digestion is carried on.
There is another plant of the same order which is still simpler 
it its arrangements, the Venus's Fly-trap (Dioncea muscipula ), 
found in North Carolina.
This plant has not, like the Sun-dew, 
any viscid secretion for catching and detaining the fly ; and, there- 
fore, it would not do for it to close slowly, as in that case the fly 
would have time to escape ; it closes, therefore, sharply and 
instantaneously.
Each leaf of the Dioncea consists of two lobes 
hinged together at the end of a long foot-stalk, and armed at the 
edge with a series of strong sensitive bristles.
Under ordinary 
conditions, the edges of the lobes remain wide apart, but the 
moment an insect, or any other solid body in motion, touches the 
bristles, the marginal bristles instantly interlock like the teeth of a 
rat-trap, and shut the object in until the digestive secretions of the 
plant have had time to take effect.
Each leaf of the Dioncea is 
i-2 
thus, in effect, a pair of jaws and a stomach combined — a pair of 
jaws to snatch, a stomach to digest its food.
Having now, so to speak, swallowed their fly, the respective 
plants remain closed until the operation of digestion is completed 
— a period of five days in the case of the Sun-dew ; of ten days, or 
double the time, in the case of the Venus Fly-trap.
The plant 
then opens again, ready to recommence its operations, and the 
dry shell of the fly, from which the digestible matter has been ex- 
tracted, may be seen adhering to the leaf, like the dry carcase of a 
fly in a spider's web, after the spider has sucked the juice.
But it is to be observed that these plants close upon every 
solid object that comes, whether it be good to eat, or whether it 
be not — it may be a fly, or it may be a speck of dust, the plant 
closes upon it just the same.
But in the case of its having 
swallowed something not good to eat, the plant opens again ; the 
Sun-dew in about seventeen hours, the Fly-trap in about thirty-nine 
hours — again about double the time.
It seems evident from this, 
that it is only by attempting to digest what it has swallowed that 
the plant finds whether or not it is good to eat ; for you will see 
that the plant of slower digestion, which requires double the time 
to digest its food, requires also double the time to find out whether 
what it has swallowed is fit to eat ; so that it seems clear that it is 
only when the process of digestion is ripe for commencing, tha 
the plant finds out that what it has taken is not capable of being 
digested.
When I say that these plants close on everything that 
comes, the statement must be subjected to a certain quahfication.
It must be something that comes, as a fly comes, with a light and 
titillating touch.
A speck of dust would do it, but anything 
coming with a stronger impact, would produce no effect.
And 
you will at once see how essential this is to the life of the plant_ 
If the impact of a drop of rain, for instance, were to cause the 
plant to close, it might be kept closed till it was starved to death.
The nerves of the plant, then, which set its closing machinery 
in motion, have the property of being stimulated only by a slight 
touch, and not by a heavy one.
And this is a property by no 
means confined to this particular plant.
Take the common nettle.
43 
for instance.
If you touch the nettle lightly, it stings you ; if you 
grasp it firmly, it has no effect upon you.
This seems to me to 
show that the nerves of the nettle, or those particular nerves of the 
nettle which set the stinging machinery in operation, are in like 
manner excited by a slight touch, and not by a heavy one.
But 
we need not go so far as the nettle for an illustration — we seem to 
have nerves of the same sort in our own frames.
If you want to 
tickle a person on the face or on the soles of the feet, you take the 
tips of your fingers, or something delicate hke a feather, and 
touch him as lightly as you possibly can.
So doing, you tickle 
him ; if you lay on heavily, you cannot do it.
Now the sensation 
of tickling, like every other sensation, comes from the nerves, and 
it, therefore, seems to me to show that we have in our own frames 
nerves which, like those of the plants in question, are excited by a 
slight touch, and not by a stronger one.
The next point to which I desire to call your attention is 
this : — The insectivorous plants I have referred to swallow every- 
thing that comes, whether it be good to eat or whether it be not, 
and, constituted as these plants are, you will see that it is a 
necessity of their existence that they should do so.
In a state of 
nature these plants take their chance — sometimes they get some- 
thing which is good to eat, sometimes something which is not, but 
upon the whole they get enough to eat.
But if you were to take 
one of these plants and feed it, when it opened giving it a fly, and 
as soon as it had digested that and opened again, popping in 
another, and so on for a number of times in succession, the result 
would be that the plant would die from over-eating, because its 
digestive organs would be deprived of the interval of rest which 
nature provides by occasionally giving it something which is not 
good to eat.
Now, sometimes even in a state of nature, these plants seem to 
die from over-eating, and it is not difficult to see how this may be 
so simply on the doctrine of chances.
It may happen that the 
plant may get something good to eat every time for a number of 
times in succession, and so may, even in a state of nature, die 
from over-eating.
•14 
Now, we may compare these plants with one of the simpler 
forms of animal life, say for instance, the Octopus.
The Octopus 
may be described as a combination of a central stomach with an 
apparatus for putting things into it — in its case a number oitentacula 
ranged around for the purpose of grasping whatever comes, and, of 
course, the necessary machinery for assimilating what it swallows.
So the Drosera consists of a stomach, or that which does duty 
for a stomach, an arrangement for putting things into it, and the 
machinery necessary for assimilating that which it receives.
But 
the Octopus possesses one sense which these plants have not ; it 
does not require to put a thing into its stomach in order to find 
out whether or not it is good to eat.
Some of you may have seen 
an account, which went the round of the papers, of an attendant 
who had occasion to go into the tank at the Brighton Aquarium, 
in which the Octopods are kept, having put on for the purpose a 
pair of those large heavy boots which are used by fishermen.
The 
larger Octopus seized him by the leg, to which it held on with four 
of its tenfacula, while with the other four it kept a firm hold of the 
rocks at the side.
The man struggled with all his might, but the 
Octopus held him as in a vice.
At last the idea occurred to him 
of slipping his leg out of the boot and leaving the Octopus in 
possession.
The Octopus held on to the boot for twenty minutes, 
at the end of which time it gave it up.
Now, are we to suppose 
that the senses of the Octopus are so dull and slow that it requires 
twenty minutes in order to decide whether or not a thing is good 
to eat ?
Or is it not rather that there were exceptional circum- 
stances in the case, the boot being essentially an animal substance, 
and yet one of such a nature as to render it exceedingly uncom- 
fortable in the stomach of any animal ?
This I take to have been 
the case, and that under these peculiar circumstances the puzzled 
Octopus required a little time for consideration.
Who can tell 
what chain of impressions was passing through that dull intelli- 
gence in the twenty minutes during which the Octopus was | 
making up its mind whether or not the boot was good to eat ?
But the Octopus showed more discrimination on this occasion 
than an animal usually supposed to be higher in the scale did 
45 
upon another.
Some of you may have heard the story of the Boa 
Constrictor at the Zoological Gardens which swallowed its blanket.
But the Boa was at any rate'right so far as this, that the blanket 
was an animal substance ; and probably the creature finding, on 
waking from its lethargy, this substance conveniently at hand 
proceeded, without due consideration, to bolt it, the circumstances 
being such as could hardly occur in a state of nature.
To return to the vegetable world.
There is another plant 
well known to you all, the Sensitive Plant, which has the property 
of closing when it is touched.
And there can be, I think, as little 
doubt that the plant does so for some reason essential to its own 
preservation, as that the Hedge-hog rolls itself into a ball for its 
own protection.
It may be that the Sensitive Plant secretes some 
juice or sap of which certain insects would like to partake, that 
the loss of this sap would be injurious to the plant, and that, 
therefore, it closes when touched to protect itself from depre- 
dation.
The Sensitive plant is, at any rate, more humane in its 
mode of protecting itself than another plant, the Mentzelia, which 
is also subject to the incursions of flies.
This plant, as described 
by a French botanist, M.
de Poison, is provided with a number 
of spikes, having their barbs set downwards.
These are so thickly 
placed that a fly has only room to insert his proboscis in tlie 
interstice between in order to get at the sap.
But, on attempting 
to withdraw it, the proboscis is caught by the downward barb, and 
the result is that the unfortunate fly, thus hooked, generally ends, 
according to M.
de Poison, by twisting off its own head in its 
frantic efforts to escape.
There was a curious experiment performed lately by a French 
naturalist upon the Sensitive Plant.
It was one of a series of ex- 
periments upon the nerves of plants, and I refer to it as illustrating 
a third point of identity between the animal and the vegetable 
world.
You are aware that there is a class of substances called 
ansesthetics — ether and chloroform for instance— which have the 
effect of paralysing the action of the nerves, and so destroying 
sensation in animals.
You know that by means of this great and 
beneficent discovery, a man may have the most terrible operation 
46 
performed upon him, and yet feel no pain.
The object of the ex- 
periment was to ascertain whether the nerves of plants are 
similarly affected by the same conditions.
The operator dipped 
a sponge in ether, and laid it by the side of the Sensitive Plant, 
and then covered it with a bell-glass to confine the fumes of the 
ether.
The experiment was completely successful — the nerves of 
the plant were paralysed — no longer did it shrink and close when 
it was touched, and it was not till the ether was removed that the 
plant regained its original properties.
Thus treated, the nettle 
would cease to sting, and insects might pry with impunity into the 
Venus' Fly-trap.
Among other experiments, it was found that the 
germination of seeds, and the fermentation of liquids (which is due 
to the production of myriads of organisms) was arrested by the 
operation of an anaesthetic.
This, then, is the third point of coincidence between the 
animal and the vegetable world, that the nerve systems of both are 
— though to an extent perhaps yet not fully ascertained — subject to 
the same conditions.
The last-named experiment, which proves that the production 
of animal life is suspended by an anaesthetic, leads me to some- 
thing to which I refer rather in the way of suggestion or inquiry.
We hear a good deal just now about chloral, which at first supposed 
to be perfectly harmless, is now known to be, in consequence of 
its cumulative action when taken continuously or frequently, 
highly injurious, and even fatal.
I believe that it acts to a con- 
siderable extent as an anaesthetic; and it is said that the way in 
which it acts injuriously is by impoverishing the blood, and 
depriving it of its nutritive property.
I want to suggest a possible 
manner, suggested by the above experiment, in which this 
cumulative and injurious effect may be produced.
If, as we have 
seen, the blood is full of living creatures like the Amouba, they 
must, as is the case with all living creatures, reproduce themselves, 
and the old ones must die out.
If, then, chloral acts as an 
anaesthetic, and if the property of an anaesthetic be, as we have 
seen, to suspend the propagation of animal life, the result of a con- 
tinued course of chloral would be, the old creatures gradually, in the 
47 
course of nature, dying out, and the production of new ones being 
suspended, that the protoplasm which is the source of Hfe would 
be drained away, and so the man must die.
I warned you that I might be a little discursive, and there is 
but a slender thread of connection between the subjects on which 
I have treated, and that upon which I am about to speak.
I have 
referred to the system of cruelty, in the sense of suffering, which 
pervades the animal world, and from which even the vegetable 
world is not altogether exempt.
But it is to be observed that all 
through the domain of nature, until we come up to man himself, 
there is no unnecessary cruelty.
Cruelty is the result of weakness, 
and not of strength ; and the more powerful an animal is relatively 
to that on which it preys, the more merciful is its mode of des- 
patching it.
The large carnivora, as for instance, the lion, 
frequently despatch their prey with a stroke.
I remember hearing 
of a man* who had been struck down by a lion, and who subse- 
quently recovered, and he said that when struck he felt no pain, 
only a sensation of numbness all over his body.
But when we 
come to a smaller animal of the same kind, the leopard, which is 
said sometimes to leap from a tree upon such an animal as the 
giraffe, and, sticking its fangs into its neck, to ride it until the 
terrified animal drops from exhaustion and loss of blood, we see 
how much is the increase of suffering from the relative weakness of 
the attack.
Or take the weasel, one of the smallest of the 
carnivora.
I remember being much struck with a picture by 
Landseer, representing a hare attacked by a weasel, the hare, an 
animal more than twenty times the size of its assailant, standing 
petrified with fear, while the little creature, standing on its hind 
legs, reached up and struck its fangs into its neck.
I apprehend 
that that great animal painter must have witnessed the scene which 
he depicted, for I never in my life saw the expression of horror so 
powerfully, so painfully depicted as it was in the eye of that hare.
There is perhaps no animal whose manner of taking its prey 
is so repulsive as that animal between which and man there is the 
strongest feeling of abhorrence, and which we have taken as the 
* David Livingstone.
48 
type of tlie Evil One. The manner in which the boa, for instance, 
swallows live rabbits is sufficiently repulsive — in the case of larger 
animals, its more natural prey, it would be so much so as to cause 
English feeling to revolt.
Even the manner in which the common 
English snake devours its prey, a frog for instance, seizing it by its 
hind-quarter, and gradually, by the force of the muscles of its throat, 
drawing it in, the frog shrieking and vainly struggling, is a sight so 
unpleasant that few persons can resist interfering with the opera- 
tions of nature by giving the snake a switch across the neck.
Yet 
even here it can hardly be said that we have an exception to the 
law of nature which forbids unnecessary cruelty.
The domestic cat might seem to be an exception from the 
manner in which it torments a mouse by anticipation before it 
devours it.
But I think we may be warranted in assuming that 
this is a habit which the cat has learned from its contact with 
civilization ; one would think that in a state of nature the sense of 
insecurity, and the chance of its prey escaping, would restrain such 
a development.
But nature adopts something more than a negative course in 
regard to the prevention of useless suffering.
I refer to the instinct 
implanted in animals which causes them to put to a speedy death 
one of their own kind to prevent it from being exposed to lingering 
suffering.
I do not know how far down in the scale this principle 
extends, but from what I am about to tell you, it would seem to 
extend even to tliose creatures which do not seem to us to be of 
much account.
I remember when a boy, having my attention 
attracted to a number of sparrows on a tree in the garden, which 
were hopping about from bough to bough and twittering, in a state 
of intense excitement.
While I was watching them, and wondering 
what they were about, they all descended to the ground, where, as 
I then saw, there lay another sparrow disabled from some cause> 
and unable to move.
All the other sparrows then set upon this 
one, and despatched it by repeated blows on the head with their 
beaks.
Now we seem to have here an instance of the beneficent 
interference of nature to prevent lingering suffering.
But there 
49 
seems to me to be something more behind.
The last act of the 
drama we fully understand, but what was the object of the previous 
proceedings?
It could not be anything in the nature of a con- 
sultation, where every one was screaming at the top of his voice, 
and yet I take it that nothing in nature is done without a cause.
I have thought of it since, and I have come to this conclusion — 
that these sparrows were working themselves into a state of excite- 
ment to do a deed which had to be done, but which they could 
not do in cold blood, — to take away the life of a fellow sparrow.
I remember reading in the life of Ali Pacha of Janina, an 
incident which seems to me to afford a parallel, though in this case 
the actors were women, and not sparrows.
A village in Albania 
had been taken by an enemy, the men had been slaughtered, and 
the women had betaken themselves to the top of a neighbouring 
hill, which overlooked the sea.
The enemy having made an end 
of the men, surrounded the mountain, and began to ascend its sides 
in order to capture the women.
The women, joining hands, began 
a dance, slow and measured at first, but as the foe came nearer 
and nearer up the hill, increasing in intensity and excitement, till 
when the foe were nearing the summit, and their eyes, gleaming 
with passion, became visible — and when the dance had reached a 
pitch of frantic excitement — the leader broke the circle, and flung 
herself head-foremost into the sea, all the others one by one 
following her example.
Now it seems to me that just as these women were working 
themselves up into a state of excitement in order to do a deed 
against which human nature revolts — to take away their own lives 
— so also were these sparrows working themselves into a state of 
excitement in order to do a deed against which their nature revolted 
— to take away the life of a fellow sparrow.
I began by referring to this as instinct, but does it not look 
more like an operation of conscience?
And is not this little story 
an apt comment upon the text which says that " not a sparrow falls 
to the ground without our Father ?" 
While on the subject of the sparrow, I would like to say a little 
more about him.
We, in this country, do not set much value on 
50 
the sparrow, apparently on the principle that that which is very 
common is not held in much account.
But when any one has 
been to America, he comes back with an increased respect for the 
sparrow.
There is in America a little insect, the canker-worm, 
which destroys the noblest trees.
You may imagine what a grief 
it must be to a man to see the stately elms which surround his 
dwelling perish, one by one, from the attacks of this insidious little 
pest.
And, in order to protect their trees, they cover their trunks 
with sheet tin, which they then paint with coal tar ; and the effect 
of this is, that the worm, striving to make its way up the trunk, is 
unable to make its way over the tar.
But you may well imagine 
that it does not much improve the appearance of the trees to be 
painted black, and I well remember the astonishment of a young 
Englishman who had never been in America before, when on 
taking a drive out of Boston we came to a country house, and he 
saw that the trees around it were painted black — " Has there been 
a death in the family?" he said, "and have they been putting the 
trees in mourning ?" Now, it so happens that there is not a bird 
in America that will touch this worm, whereas the English sparrow 
goes in for it with the greatest avidity, and so for many years the 
Americans have been casting longing eyes upon our sparrow ; and 
while in many places in this country the farmers have been forming 
clubs to destroy him, the Americans have been making earnest 
endeavours to naturalise him.
After many abortive attempts, they 
seem now to have hit upon a plan which seems likely to be suc- 
cessful.
They have let loose the sparrows among the trees of the 
parks attached to the great tOAvns, where they will be under the 
protection of the police, and also of the public sentiment.
They 
have erected little houses for them among the branches, and in 
order to domicile them there, supplied them in the first instance 
with food, and it was amusing to see the sparrows going in and 
out of their little houses, while the Americans looked on with 
benignant interest.
So now the Americans seem to be in a fair 
way of gaining their object, and succeeding in naturalising the 
sparrow.
And perhaps it may afford something of a lesson to us, 
not to undervalue a thing because it is common, and not to ignore 
51 
the useful purpose which it might require a change of circumstances 
to make us more thoroughly appreciate.
It remains before I conclude, that I should say a word re- 
specting the Society before which I have the honour of appearing.
And it seems to me that this Society is one which perhaps, more 
than any other, claims our sympathy in this respect — that it is in 
the best sense of the word the most democratic.
Its pursuits are 
those upon which all men engage on equal terras, for to all men 
alike is the Book of Nature open, and the results are to those whose 
observation is the most intelligent, and whose patience is the most 
enduring.
I will not take up time with any observations which 
might be rather trite on the humanizing and the elevating effect of 
all study of the work of the Creator, but I cannot but feel that the 
man who follows the denizens of the field and of the wood into 
their haunts, and makes a study of the economy of their daily lives, 
diversified as these are with many a curious and interesting trait, 
will have, more than other men, something of a kindly sympathy 
with all God's creatures, and will realize more than other men the 
words of the Poet — 
" He prayeth best who loveth best 
All things, both great and small."

PSYCHOLOGICAL NOTES.
ADDRESS OF THE PRESIDENT, 
The Hon. PERCY WYNDHAM, M.P.
( Delivered at Maryport, May, l88o.^ 
Has Psychology any existence as a Science?
Are not all the ideas that are held on the subject capable of clas- 
sification under two heads ?
One heading would include those tenets 
on the subject of Psychology which were taught us from our earliest 
childhood, and which, with many of us, has been allowed to lie in 
our minds fallow and unquestioned, or at least labelled unques- 
tionable; the other would include those ideas in Psychology which 
are evolved from the inner consciousness, touching ground seldom 
and at rare intervals, and bearing little relation to ascertained facts.
Were this all they had to go upon, they might say that no such 
science existed.
"Psychology," to use the words of the late Serjeant 
Cox, "in the metaphysical form in which it has been hitherto, with 
rare exceptions, presented to the student, has appeared to him 
difficult, dry, and almost repulsive ; a science of abstractions and 
unrealities based upon argument alone, with the very slightest 
reference to facts." The Psychology to which I would draw your 
attention is, to quote the same authority, " a science to be pursued 
like other physical sciences, by observing phenomena, trying 
experiments, applying tests, and collecting the facts which are to 
54 
be found in this as abundantly as in any other science." The 
theories of thinkers like Reid and Stewart, Hamilton and Browne, 
were evolved from their inner consciousness, and were moulded 
entirely from introspection instead of from observation.
They 
may be compared to the pre-Baconian philosophers : to the new 
school belong Gall and Spurzheim, George and Andrew Combe, 
Abercrombie and Moore, Carpenter, Spencer, Cox. Still, however, 
the question remains, Can a science be made of that which is 
imperceptible to the senses ?
The positivists would reply in the 
negative.
Magnetism, electricity, and the law of gravitation are 
all in themselves imperceptible to the senses.
Why do we believe 
in them?
Because the existence of a thing can be proved by 
manifestation of effects of which it was the cause as well as the 
cognition of palpable substance.
Of magnetism, of electricity, of 
gravitation we know no more than we can know of the soul and 
mind, but we believe in them because, although imperceptible 
themselves, we learn their nature and qualities by observing their 
manifestation upon matter that is perceptible.
The nature and 
qualities of a mind, or soul, or pneuma must be studied in the same 
manner ; and should we ever find instances in which a mind, or 
soul, or pneuma acts independently of the usual material agents- 
instances in which the effect of hearing is produced without the 
agency of the ears, the effect of seeing without the agency of the 
eyes — we are at least led towards the conclusion that a mind or 
soul may exist independent of the material structure of the body.
Physiologists can find nothing in the human structure that is not 
material : all that the microscope and the scalpel reveal dies and 
is dissipated.
Is there nothing more ?
Stones are structures, so 
are sponges; but man has intelligence, which a stone has not.
What, then, is there in the structure of a man which there is not 
in the structure of a stone that gives intelligence to the man and 
not to the stone ?
To this important question various replies are 
made.
I shall endeavour to give expression to the most prominent 
ones.
First comes the ancient belief that the material structure of 
man is the shrine of an immortal soul destined to survive the 
55 
dissolution of the body.
This faith, though no doubt rudely 
shaken in the minds of some by generalisations drawn from the 
investigations of modern science, has, in the minds of others, 
recently received confirmation from the study of the science to 
which I draw your attention on the present occasion.
Next I 
would mention a beUef for which I must invent a name, and call 
it Pneumatism, by which I mean to express a beUef in a soul which 
is dependent entirely on the material body — a soul in short which 
is not necessarily immortal.
The holders of this belief occupy 
a middle position between the materialists and the spiritualists.
I use this term here in its wider sense, and not as limited to what 
is called modern spiritualism.
Third and last come the materialists, 
and I will give their belief in their own words.
" Mind is not an 
entity like the body, nor a part of the structure like the brain or 
the liver, but it is the product of structure.
Mind is a function of 
the brain, as digestion is a function of the stomach.
Thought is a 
secretion from the brain.
When the brain dies, thought ceases." 
On this definition I would make one or two remarks.
When you 
have called thought a function of the brain, you have not really 
explained it ; nor can you explain it as you can explain the process 
of digestion as a function of the stomach : your explanation is, at 
best, but an adroit evasion of a difficulty.
The conclusion at 
which you have arrived is one in favour of which a great amount 
of affirmative evidence might be adduced ; but it is not more than 
this ; and we can conceive of thought, mind, and consciousness as 
being something other than a function of the brain, in the sense 
that its origin is in the brain.
Thought, mind, consciousness of 
personality, are not secretions of the material brain in the sense 
that their existence is inconceivable without the existence of a 
material brain, but a material brain is absolutely necessary to 
consciousness, thought, or mind during contact with a material 
world.
The question presents itself, if we can think without the 
machinery of a brain, why are we endowed with one ?
The answer 
is, that without a brain, we cannot communicate with the material 
world.
On the hypothesis I have advanced, the brain would still 
be necessary to put the nerves in motion, and through them the 
56 
muscles, and cause them to speak the word, strike the blow, put 
one foot before another.
If ,we wish to ascertain whether there 
is any probability that the hypothesis is true, in what direction 
should we look for proof?
The answer is clear.
We must en- 
deavour to find out whether the results that follow the functional 
exercise of the material organs of man, are ever to be met with 
dissociated from the exercise of those functions.
To the late 
Serjeant Cox belongs the merit of the suggestion that if the mech- 
anism of man is composed of soul as well as body, the fact must be 
capable of proof, and some facts might surely be discovered that 
would throw some light upon the subject.
Somnambulism.
The state of artificial somnambulism, or the mesmeric state, 
offers a wide field for observations to the student of Psychology.
Somnambulism, or sleep-walking, has no connection with sleep; 
although natural somnambulism occurs more often when the patient 
is asleep, or has lain down to rest in the dark, than at any other 
time.
The mesmeric state, or trance, is the state of somnambuhsm 
artificially induced.
Somnambulism is the mesmeric state natur- 
ally induced.
The word "sleep-walking" should be discarded, 
on account of its being inseparably connected in our minds with the 
condition of sleep ; an objection which does not apply to the word 
"somnambulism," though of course the meaning of the two words 
is the same.
The appearance of the patient in somnambulism is 
that of one plunged in profound slumber : in the great majority of 
instances the eyes are firmly closed ; the countenance is extremely 
placid, and the face very pale, the extremities abnormally cold and 
clammy; the breathing regular and full, with frequent sighing, or, 
to be more accurate, with deep inspirations that make the sound 
of a sigh, but are not, like sighing, expressions of any mental 
emotion.
But here the resemblance to sleep ends.
The conditions 
differ from those of sleep in these particulars : the muscles are not 
flaccid, but retain all, and often more than than all, the ordinary 
tension of working life.
The limbs are not relaxed, but in energetic 
action.
The head does not droop.
The muscles are extremely 
57 
rigid, especially when the patient is still : this is the reverse of their 
condition in sleep, when they are usually flaccid even in motion 
but are entirely so at rest.
The somnambule with his eyes closed and all his senses sealed, 
will perform his daily work, however intricate, write, read, thread a 
needle, sew, and do other works requiring keen insight, manual dex- 
terity, and delicate touch.
During the entire acting of this, the senses 
continue paralyzed.
He neither sees nor hears nor feels with the 
bodily organs.
The mind only is awake ; and manifestly the mind 
then receives impressions of external objects, and guides the actions 
of the body without the assistance of its usual informants, the 
Senses.
If undisturbed, the patient usually retires to his bed ; 
somnambulism gives place to sleep ; the Hmbs relax ; dreams 
come, go, and are remembered.
Finally, he wakes from slumber 
without the slightest recollection of anything that had happened 
during the period of somnambulism.
This description of the condition of somnambulism is abridged 
from the second volume of the late Serjeant Cox's work,* " What 
am IV' 
I will now give you one or two examples of the state of 
natural somnambulism which appear in more than one of the 
books relating to the subject.
Dr. Arnold Weinholt reports the 
following on the authority of Dr. Schulz, the famous physician of 
Hamburgh : — 
"A girl between twelve and thirteen years of age belonging to a family of 
some distinction, was afflicted with a violent nervous complaint in which strong 
convulsive motion alternated with catalepsy and syncope.
Besides, she 
frequently had paroxysms, during which she conversed with much liveliness 
and ingenuity.
In this state she distinguished without difficulty all colours that 
were presented to her, recognised the numbers of cards, and the stripes upon 
those which were variegated.
She described the colour of the binding of books 
when shown to her.
She wrote in the same method as usual, and cut figures 
in paper as she was accustomed to do for pastime in her waking state.
Her 
eyes at this time were firmly closed ; but in order to be assured that she made 
no use of them, a bandage was placed over them on the approach of the 
paroxysm."

The "French Encyclopcedia" has preserved a very remarkable 
case, accurately noted by the Archbishop of Bordeaux.
It is that 
of a young ecclesiastic in the same seminary with the Archbishoi^.
He was in the habit of getting up during the night in a state of 
somnambulism, of going to his room, taking pen, ink, and paper, 
and composing and writing sermons.
When he had finished one 
page of the paper on which he was writing, he would read over 
what he had written, and correct it.
Upon one occasion he had 
made use of the expression Ce divin Enfant.
In reading over the 
passage, he changed the adjective divin to adorable.
Perceiving, 
however, that the pronoun ce could not stand before the word 
adorable., he added to the former the letter /.
In order to ascertain whether the somnambulist made any use 
of his eyes, the Archbishop held a piece of pasteboard under his 
chin, to prevent him seeing the paper on which he was writing ; 
but he continued to write on without appearing to be incommoded 
in the slightest degree.
The paper on which he was writing was 
taken away and other paper laid before him, but the somnambulist 
immediately perceived the change.
He wrote pieces of music 
while in this state, and in the same manner — with his eyes closed.
The words were placed under the musical notes.
It happened 
on one occasion that the words were written in too large a character 
and did not stand precisely under the corresponding notes.
He 
soon perceived the error, blotted out the first, and wrote it again 
with great exactness.
Clairvoyance.
The effects produced by artificial somnambuUsm are precisely 
similar, and if they appear to cover more ground, that is probably 
due to the fact that facilities for observation are much greater in 
artificial somnambulism than they are in natural somnambulism.
You will find many recorded in Dr. Gregory's book*, '•' Animal 
Magnetism" of which a new edition has recently been pubUshed.
I do not intend to quote any, but will take one within my own 
* Aitimal Magnetism, or Mesmerism, and its Phenomena.

experience which will serve the purposes of my argument as well 
as any other.
The state can be induced in various ways : by 
passes of the hand over the eyes of the patient ; by his fixing his 
eyes upon a leaden disk, with a piece of copper in the middle ; or 
even in some cases by the patient taking the hand of another 
person, and inducing the state by an act of volition on his own 
part.
This is the case with Mr. J.
C. Fletcher, the somnambule 
to whom I paid a visit last summer.
I went there without notice 
or previous appointment, and on his passing into a state of trance, 
questioned him on various matters relating to myself.
I give one 
instance only.
I asked him to go to where my boys were at 
school.
I was of course particular not to mention the name of the 
school — Eton.
The general description he gave of them, the house 
and the room they were in, was accurate ; but of course it always 
occurs to one that one general description is like another, and for 
this reason, as a test, it is better to choose some locality that 
possesses some definite feature of a peculiar character.
The Upper 
School at Eton fulfils this condition.
It is entirely without furni- 
ture, beyond some fixed desks and benches, and has only one 
feature to distinguish it from any other large well-proportioned 
room.
Accordingly, when he was describing the external appearance 
of the buildings there, and among others, one that resembled -the 
Upper School, I — carefully abstaining from using the word Upper 
School, which might suggest the locality to one who had heard of 
the name — asked him to go into the building, and tell me what he 
saw there.
He described it as a very long room, wainscoted with 
oak.
I then said.
Do you see anything else in it?
He replied, I 
see a row of busts round the room, and the tops of heads are 
covered with dust.
This was the feature which I wished to see 
whether he would notice or not ; the peculiarity of the Upper 
School at Eton being the row of busts of distinguished men who 
have been educated there, placed round the room.
What is the Explanation ?
Of course I am well aware that many people deny the existence 
of the phenomena of what is sometimes called clairvoyance ; but it 
60 
is not my purpose to deal with any doubts of the kind — if I had time 
I have not the incUnation, as only personal experience can convince 
persons whether the wonders of artificial somnambulism are true or 
not.
I must askthose who disbelieve in the whole matter, to bear 
with me while I attempt what must appear to them the unprofitable 
enquiry — how the mind of Mr. Fletcher received the impression of 
the appearance of the interior of the Upper School at Eton.
I had 
hold of Mr. Fletcher's hand : could that be the medium of contact 
between my brain and his ?
This solution must be dismissed at 
once; it might explain this individual case, but in the great 
majority of cases there is no contact between the clairvoyant and 
his questioner.
So far as I know, only three theories are put forward in 
explanation of similar cases by those who would believe the 
external circumstances to be as I state them.
The first is the 
belief that man possesses a soul, and that this soul in certain 
abnormal conditions of the body is freed from the limitations 
which that body ordinarily imposes on it.
With people holding 
this belief, the solution is easy.
According to them, the soul of 
the clairvoyant — which is himself, while his body is in a state 
of insensibility — is able to have cognizance of the place in 
obedience to the will of the operator.
I shall not dwell upon this, 
whatever my own opinion may be, as it begs the question, and, if 
admitted, proves more than I require for my argument.
The 
second is difficult of explanation, if indeed capable of it.
It 
is as follows — that there is no question of soul or other conscious- 
ness than that which is a secretion of the body.
That in certain 
abnormal conditions the powers of the body become marvellously 
extended — how they are extended is not known — and the man 
sees without the use of his eyes.
What is worth remarking here is, 
that there is an admitted independence of the organs of sight.
Another solution would be that Mr. Fletcher was able to describe 
the appearance of the Upper School by what is called thought- 
reading ; — that he read the thoughts that were passing through my 
brain at the time.
That the phenomenon of thought-reading exists 
I have little doubt, but it is quite distinct from clairvoyance.
If 
61 
the phenomenon of thought-reading, or sympathy, has any exist- 
ence, what does it mean ?
It means, that under certain conditions 
the motive power of the brain may be something distinct from, and 
outside, itself: that it obeys a will other than its own.
If so, it is 
easier to conceive that it is not its own governor, that the power 
it ordinarily obeys is not itself, but something other than itself, 
whose behest it obeys.
To return, then.
In the second of the three possible explan- 
ations I have given of the power possessed by Mr. Fletcher, we 
have the effect of sight without the use of the organs of sight ; in 
the third, the effect of sound without the use of the organs of 
hearing.
The independence of two such important material organs 
makes the conception of a total independence of the material body 
less difficult.
It is to be regretted, on the score of Psychology, that mes- 
merism fell into disuse some thirty or forty years ago : its use prior 
to that was steadily increasing.
The physician who used it most 
was Dr. Esdaile, in the hospital at Calcutta.
Medical science 
applied successively ether, chloroform, and laughing-gas as anaes- 
thetics ; all preferable for that purpose to mesmerism — quicker and 
more effectual.
The practical English mind allowed mesmerism to 
fall into disuse.
An interest is reviving in it among a few who see 
its relation to Psychology, and Dr. Gregory's book has been 
re-published without the first three chapters.
These were devoted 
to proving that mesmerism was not trickery and imposture.
No 
one now would urge that conclusion, and this should be remembered 
when we find so many scientific men denying the possibility of 
clairvoyance.
The phenomena of mesmerism have been subject 
to fierce controversy while passing through the phases that appear 
to be the invariable fate of new truths.
" When first asserted," to 
use the words of Serjeant Cox, "they are vehemently disputed, not 
by investigation, by experiment, and test, but \)y a priori arguments 
to prove that they cannot be." But a fact remains still a fact 
in defiance of any quantity of argument to prove that it cannot be 
and will assert itself to common sense, however reluctant scientists 
may be to admit that there can possibly be any natural law or force 
62 
not known to them.
So the phenomena of somnambulism, at first 
fiercely disputed, and their assertors denounced as knaves and 
dupes, hai've come to be accepted as substantially true.
But then 
they were declared not to be new truths, but to have been familiar 
to every physiologist and psychologist, under other names, such as 
hysteria, or hallucination ; and now they have taken their place 
among the recognised incidents of a rare condition of the nervous 
system.
At this point they were, until lately, almost dismissed 
from notice.
Their relationship to Psychology seems not to have 
occurred to the physiologists and physicians — with very rare 
exceptions.
They had not the curiosity to enquire what was the 
meaning of these strange, and, according to the laws of physical 
science, utterly inexplicable phenomena.
What light, if any, they 
throw upon the mysteries of the mind and soul, the scientists have 
not paused to enquire.
Is it that they fear to ask, lest the answer 
should be fatal to their favourite materialism ?
or is it that their 
faith in materialism is so firmly fixed that they deem it a waste of 
time even to listen to evidence on the other side ?
Whatever be 
the cause, while the facts and phenomena of somnambulism have 
been reluctantly accepted, their value in revealing the mechanism 
of man, and the manner of its action, has been grudgingly admitted, 
and to this moment has been but partially employed for the 
purpose of that knowledge of himself which is the highest and 
most important object of human research.
Animal Intelligence.
By the exercise of what power do animals find their way back 
to distant places from which they have been removed ?
It has 
been surmised that man may have once possessed this power, but 
that he has lost it in the process of evolution.
The suggestion, 
whether true or not, throws no light whatever on the matter.
No 
explanation worthy of the name has ever been attempted ; and we 
must confess that in our present state of knowledge, we are unable 
to conceive or realize the power they possess.
One thing only is 
tolerably certain — the knowledge of topography necessary to them 
63 
to find their way, is not conveyed to them through the ordinary 
channels of the senses.
Of this power in animals, I know of two remarkable instances 
in my own knowledge.
During the mastership of Mr. Millom 
Hartley, the late Lord Leconfield sent two foxhounds from 
Petworth to the Cumberland kennels.
They went by rail from 
Petworth to London, were led across London, and again by rail 
from Euston Square to Dalston station.
They remained for a 
month at the kennels there, going out with the hounds, when one 
day they simultaneously disappeared.
Some days after — I do not 
remember how long — when the huntsman at Petworth opened the 
kennel door in the early morning, the first thing that greeted him 
was one of the hounds, who laid his paws on his shoulders.
His 
companion was never heard of again.
It is worthy of remark that 
the hound that reached home had more character than the other ; 
he was an excellent hound, but was draughted for skirting and 
running cunning.
In another case a badger was kept for four years in a loose 
box attached to a stable.
He made his escape, and two days 
after he was dug out of a hole from which he had originally been 
taken.
This badger must have recrossed a river to regain his home, 
which river he had crossed four years before in the bottom of a 
sack.
He had been placed in a sack on capture, and not enlarged 
until he reached the place of his confinement.
Here is another instance, not within my own knowledge, still 
lower down in the scale of creation.
At Falmouth, the crabs 
caught at the Lizard, some twelve miles distant, were taken to 
the harbour, branded with the mark of the fisherman, and placed in 
a box alive to await sale.
The box was staved in, and the crabs 
escaped.
Three days afterwards many of them were again captured 
at the Lizard.
To reach this they must have found their way to 
the mouth of the harbour, and having arrived there, learned by 
some strange perceptive power, in which direction their home lay ; 
for it was far out of any possible range of vision, and they had been 
carried to their prison in a boat.
It is suggested that this is made 
possible by the possession of another sense of which we know 
64 
nothing.
It is, however, opposed to general experience that living 
organisms of a higher type should possess a particular sense with- 
out the association of a material organ.
But perhaps it is meant 
that this sense is without any material organ ; if so, it only shows 
us how little our knowledge of the use of material organs 
helps us in accounting for incidents like those I have quoted.
In 
the case of two of them I vouch for the truth, but they are only 
among hundreds equally well authenticated.
Localisation of the Organs of the Brain.
Among recent discoveries, one of the most interest to 
psychologists is the confirmation by Ferrier and Althaus of Gall's 
theory of the localisation of the cerebral faculties.
That he failed 
to prove that external bumps on the skull correspond to equivalent 
portions of the brain's surface, is a matter of minor moment.
It is 
now admitted that when we think on a particular subject, we do 
not use the whole of our brain, nor even the half, but a portion of 
the half.
Further research will probably carry the departmental 
theory of the brain further ; ai^d, indeed, we can infer that such is 
the opinion of Dr. Althaus, though we may doubt whether so far as 
psychology is concerned, the careful examination of dead matter is, 
as he suggests, the only true road to knowledge.* 
Spiritualism.
I cannot bring these desultory remarks to a close without a 
passing allusion to modern spiritualism, and I had better at once 
put myself right with my audience by announcing my belief in the 
reality of the phenomena ; an avowal I am not ashamed to make 
in company with such men as Mr. William Crookes, Mr. Varley, 
Professor Zollner, Mr. Wallace, Lords Lindsay and Rayleigh.
If 
asked to define and explain the ultimate cause of the phenomena 
which I believe to be genuine, I should be obliged to confess my 
inability to do this, a confession which might be much more widely 
made in regard to other beliefs, with the same degree of truth.
I

65 
have my own theories and inclinations towards convictions, but I 
should like all who may take an interest in these matters to admit 
that we have not yet reached the stage for enunciations of theories 
and systems.
What people who are interested in the inquiry have 
to do is to register, sift, and catalogue facts.
With regard to the 
phenomena themselves, I accept the thesis which most spiritualists 
would accept, namely, " that they have discovered a force unknown 
to science, governed by an intelligence outside a human body." 
Let us assume, then, what is a fact, that the truth of the phenomena 
is attested, after careful examination, by numbers of intelligent 
men.
What is there that should prevent us accepting their 
testimony 1 Instances of trickery and fraud, common in this as in 
other matters, do not affect those instances where a belief in their 
presence would necessitate an amount of credulity far greater than 
that which is inveighed against.
The triviality of the manifestations 
does not shake it.
Professor Huxley once said that even supposing 
spiritualism was true, he did not care to Hsten to spirits whose 
conversation never rose above the level of the gossip of a provincial 
town.
A very fair remark, and one in which all frequenters of 
spirit circles must often have felt inclined to concur ; but after all, 
the question still is, are the phenomena genuine ?
and if this is 
attested by the evidence of credible witnesses, what is said or done 
at spirit circles is for the present at least of secondary importance.
We are not, I suppose, to assume that we are, in virtue of our inner 
consciousness, perfectly acquainted with every possible condition 
of spirit life, assuming its existence, and that everything that does not 
immediately square with these preconceived ideas is to be dis- 
missed at once.
We might remember that when a fresh vista of 
discovery is opened to our eyes, we at first see but a portion of 
the realm of fact it may reveal to us.
Its Significance.
What, then, is the value of the discoveries of spiritualism, 
assuming them to be true ?
Trivial and perplexing as they are for 
the most part in themselves, their value lies in this, that once the 
existence of anything in the nature of spirit is admitted, the whole 
5 
66 
fabric of materialism as the only possible basis of our existence 
falls to the ground.
With it goes much that is deduced from it, 
and beliefs that had been supposed to be laid at rest for ever 
begin to reassert the possibility of their truth.
We are, however, 
told by men of science that we are not to believe the evidence of 
credible witnesses in certain cases, and, according to Dr. Carpenter, 
the standard by which they are to be tried, is the standard of 
common sense.
Thus, in paragraph 530 of his book on Mental 
Physiology^ we are told that 
"Every one who accepts as facts, merely on the evidence of his own senses, 
or on the testimony of others who partake of his beliefs, what common sense 
tells him to be much more probably the fiction of his own imagination, even 
though confirmed by the testimony of hundreds with the same epidemic 
delusion, must be regarded as the subject of a diluted insanity." 
This is all very well, but the testimony of intelligent credible men 
has the same value in all time.
Common sense is a constantly 
shifting standard.
The common sense as to what is possible of 
the reign of Elizabeth, or of ten years ago, is the common nonsense 
of the reign of Victoria, and the present year.
But Dr. Carpenter 
is reasonable compared with Dr. Beard of New York.
"Other factors," writes Dr. Beard, "being the same, a common-place 
man without logic, or imagination, or education, or aspiration, would be less 
likely to be conquered by a delusion than a successful lawyer, or judge, or 
Scientific discoverer ; for logical, well-trained, truth-loving minds, the only 
security against spiritism is in hiding or running away.
If they venture a fair 
and open attack, and are true to their convictions and necessities of logic, they 
must unconditionally surrender.
If Sir Isaac Newtown were alive to-day, he 
would not unlikely be a convert to spiritism : the amount of human testimony 
in favour of spiritualistic claims is a millionfold greater than that in favour of 
the theory of gravity.
The late Judge Edmonds used to say that he sifted the 
evidence of spirit manifestions just as he sifted the evidence in cases of law, and 
in accordance with the same principles, and from the standard of the law books 
and the Universities, his position was impregnable.
" \ 
I confess this takes my breath away; the only conclusion it seems 
to point to is that ignorance and lack of knowledge are safer guides 
than their opposites.
From Dr. Carpenter and Dr. Beard let us

Let us all beware of the impediments acquired know-

It has been said with 
truth that all women and most men generalise a great deal too 
much.
Any flattering unction the sterner sex may lay to their 
souls on the score of this saying is more than dissipated by the 
fact that as they for the most part think on more important matters 
so their generalisations are the more mischievous in their conse- 
quences.
An article by Lord Brougham in the Edinburgh Review 
based on deductions drawn from acquired facts, postponed the 
recognition of the true Undulatory Theory of light for sixty years 
To reason without generalising from acquired facts would be like 
refusing to use logarithms in a proposition of algebra.
But the 
confidence we can repose in one process is not the same confidence 
we can place in the other.
The deductions we may draw from 
facts acquired, or supposed to be acquired, should lead us only 
never guide us.
The word "impossible" should be sparingly used' 
"Highly improbable," "totally inconsistent with the recognised 
views of existing facts," are more philosophic.
Nay, more, we may 
be called upon to allow two theories, each supported with evidence 
of the same value, and each absolutely irreconcileable with each 
other, to he side by side in our minds till more extended knowledge 
establishes one and destroys the other, or shows that after all they 
are not irreconcileable.
How easy for the amateur, how difficult 
for the discoverer and the man of science.
His invention, his 
discovery, his recognised theory is not only true in itself, but look 
at It properly, and it is much more a key and compendium of the 
universe.
With a slight tendency to look at only the affirmative 
Side, the conviction grows that it, and the deductions that can be 
68 
logically drawn from it, explain everything.
The next step is as 
certain, but not so innocent, in its effects.
Everything it cannot 
explain is nonsense, and has no existence.
Tiresome men make 
fresh discoveries ; they are hushed for a time, or for their life, but 
others rise in their places.
More strange still, facts discover them- 
selves, they are said to be the result of trickery or credulity, but, 
as Carlyle has said, they still stand there like questions waiting for 
an answer, and, what is more, refuse altogether to go away until 
they get one.
Let us ever keep our minds open to evidence, 
remembering that knowledge has a tendency to turn the key of her 
treasure-house, lest a portion should be found on closer examination 
to be dross; and as the knowledge of yesterday is often the 
ignorance of to-day, so the human mind may still be only on the 
threshold of discovery.

SOUL-CELLS AND CELL-SOULS, 
(Translated from the German of Hjeckel.
) 
By the Rev. C.
H. PAREZ.
(Read at Carlisle.) 
Introductory.
A LITTLE more than a year ago, my attention was directed 
accidentally to the Essay of Hceckel's, from which I am to read 
some extracts to-night, as containing a theory which he regarded 
as offering a ground of mediation between old and new philosophies.
Knowing that Haeckel was one who carried Darwinism to its 
extreme conclusions, and being well aware of his eminence as a 
scientific man, I felt my curiosity excited, and procured the Essay.
It contains probably nothing very novel as regards its facts, and 
perhaps the theory insisted on is not altogether new,* but the 
essay is I think a very interesting one itself, and the theory of the 
cell-soul has so far attracted notice as to have become the subject 
of some remarks in the Address of the last Meeting of the British 
Association, to which I propose briefly to refer presently.
I do 
not pretend to decide, where doctors disagree, but I propose to lay 
before you the points in dispute.
It may be as well at the outset to explain the use of the term 
"soul" in the title of the essay.
The theory of the cell-soul is that 
each cell of the most highly organised bodies is a separate psyche 
or individual ; that it not only grows by receiving nourishment, 
* It is indicated in a little work by Jean Mace, which has been translated 
into English by Mrs. Galty under the title of ^ Bit of Bread.
70 
propagates itself, and responds to stimulus, but has individual 
consciousness.
It is in fact much the same theory, advocated 
from a scientific platform, as that which was expressed long ago by 
our native poet when he attributed conscious pleasure to flowers 
and plants : — 
Through primrose tufts in that sweet bower 
The periwinkle trailed its wreaths ; 
And 'tis my faith that every flower 
Enjoys the air it breathes.
The budding twigs spread out their fan, 
To catch the breezy air : 
And I must think, do all I can, 
That there was pleasure there.
I. 
The first, most universal, and weightiest fact, which at the 
beginning of this psychological enquiry meets the scientific explorer, 
is the dependence of all soul-activity on certain material parts of 
the animal body, viz.
— the organs of soul.
In man and in the 
higher animals, the soul-instruments of which I speak are the 
organs of sense, the nerve system, and the muscular system: 
in the lower animals, they are groups of cells, or even single cells, 
which have not yet been differentiated into nerves and muscles.
Every manifestation of soul-life, every psychical work, is inseparably 
connected with such an organ, and cannot be conceived apart 
from one.
It must therefore be our first duty to make ourselves 
somewhat more nearly acquainted with these organs.
The above- 
named instruments of our soul-life, viz.— (i) the organs of sense, 
(2) the nerve system, and (3) the muscles, form together a single 
great apparatus which we designate briefly in one word as the 
soul-apparatus.
In man, as in all the higher animals, this 
armoury of soul activity shews us a wonderfully remarkable 
combination of highly constituted organs and textures, the consti- 
tution of which is the more delicate, according as the tvork of 
the apparatus — the soul activity, is the higher and more elaborate.
71 
A journey Of discovery in this wonderful labyrinth would be 
certainly in the highest degree attractive and instructive ; but we 
should find it too difficult.
Instead of this, it answers our purpose 
far better, to cast a glance at the very simply built soul-apparatus 
of a lower animal.
We choose for this purpose a simple worm ; 
not because man, according to Faust, " is like a worm that grubs 
through the dust," or because according to modern phylo-genetic 
theories, there is in the genealogical tree of men even a row of 
worms among our ancestors, but rather because in the lower worms 
there is exhibited a very simple and clear building-up of their soul- 
organ, which excellently facilitates the difficult comprehension of 
the highly constituted soul-apparatus of the higher animals.
Let me observe such a single worm, e.g., a leaf-shaped plan- 
arian or turbellaria, under the microscope.
We observe in front, 
over the mouth, a tiny white ball, from which fine threads radiate 
in all directions to the various parts of the body.
That white ball 
above the mouth consists of a soft nerve mass, and is the centre of 
the whole soul-apparatus, in fact, a brain of the simplest kind; and 
the fine threads which radiate from the brain to all parts, are 
nerves.
We distinguish two sorts of such nerve threads.
One sort 
are instruments of the will, motor or efferent nerves ; they go from 
the brain to the flesh, the filaments of which, instead of the muscle- 
filaments, are excited by them to movement.
The other sort are 
instruments of sensation, or sensory nerves : they carry the different 
impressions of sensation from the outer skin, and from the organs 
of sense to the brain, and thus place the latter eti rapport with the 
surrounding outside world.
The instruments of sense of such a 
lower worm are certainly as yet very simple, but it is just on this 
very account that they are so interesting.
In many worms it is 
simply and alone the outer skin which supplies the place of a 
general sense instrument, and communicates sensations of various 
kinds, especially variations of pressure and of temperature.
In 
others there are added, eyes of a very simple kind, dark spots 
in the skin, which surround a refracting lens; also organs of 
hearing of a very simple form, viz., a pair of little dimples or 
bladders in the skin, which are thickly set with fine little hairs ; 
hairlets of hearing, which are subject to excitations of a very definite 
character from waves of sound.
That even these instruments of the higher sensory perceptions 
in the lower worms — eyes and ears — are nothing else but specially 
developed parts of the outer skin-covering, is a fact of the greatest 
significance.
For it is a fact also that the much more highly 
developed and elaborate eyes and ears of the higher animals, 
have arisen originally in the outermost skin-layer of the body, 
and do not contradict the highly important, and only recently 
firmly established law of the origin of all sensation from the skin.
In respect of their origin, all the different instnimenis of sense in 
animals are only specialised parts of their sensory oiiter-skin.
Furthermore, the instruments of motion, the servants of the 
will — the muscles, stand, in respect of their origin, in the closest 
connexion with the outer skin.
In our lower worms, the whole muscle-system is represented 
by nothing more than a mere thin layer of flesh, which spreads out 
everywhere under the covering of skin.
Usually this so-called 
"skin-muscle-membrane" of worms separates into two different 
layers — an outer layer of round filaments, and an inner one of long 
filaments, but not yet separated into groups or bundles of muscles, 
as in the higher animals.
But especial prominence must be given to the important fact 
that the whole body oi nerves, alike the centripetal sensory filaments 
that go from the brain to the skin and sense organs, and the 
centrifugal motor filaments that go from the brain to the muscles, 
stand in immediate connexion with these outer-lying parts.
Thus 
when, agreeably to nature, we conceive the whole soul-apparatus 
as one whole, the perceptive sensory organs are nothing else but 
special expansions of the ends of the sensory nerves ; and the 
muscle filaments subservient to the will, are nothing else but special 
terminal organs of the motor nerves.
Between those first and 
these last is intercalated the brain, as a common centre and direct 
bridge of connexion.
If a clear perception is wanted of the working of such a soul- 
apparatus — of the nature of the soul-life, the best help for such a 
73 
purpose is found in the oft-repeated comparison with the system 
of the electric telegraph.
This well-known comparison is justified 
not only by the whole arrangement of the soul-apparatus, but 
especially by the fact, that in the action of this apparatus, actual 
electric currents do play the greatest part.
The comparison 
however does not attain its full significance until by the aid of a 
strong magnifying power we have recognised the finest components 
which constitute that apparatus.
The microscopic elementary 
forms or building stones of the soul-apparatus, are none other 
than those of which the remaining organs of the animal body 
consist, the so-called "cells." Here, therefore, as everywhere in 
natural history, we have the cell theory estfiblished forty years 
ago by Schleiden and Schwann, which serves as a master key to 
open to us the first gate of deeper knowledge.
Various then as 
appear the countless forms of small cells in the various textures of 
the bodies of plants and animals, nevertheless all agree in this 
important particular — that each single cell possesses a definite 
degree of individual independent existence of its own, has its own 
form, and leads its own life.
As Briicke says, well hitting the 
point — each microscopic cell is an elementary organism, or an 
individual of the first rank.
Yes, as we shall presently see, we 
may even attribute to each cell an independent psyche, a cell-soul.
Countless as the stars in the heavens are the endless myriads 
of cells which constitute the giant body of a whale or an elephant, 
an oak or a palm.
And yet the gigantic body of these largest 
organisms, as much as that of the invisible dwarf body of the 
smallest, consists in the beginning of its existence only of a single 
little egg-cell, to the naked eye invisible.
Once, however, this cell 
begins to develop, and there arises from it through manifold 
division, in the shortest space of time, an enormous mass of similar 
cells.
These are distributed in leaf-like layers, the so-called germ- 
leaves.
At first all cells are alike ; each single cell is of the very 
simplest form and constitution : a round, soft little ball, like white 
of egg, or lump of protoplasm inclosing a more substantial kernel.
Soon, however, arise dissimilarities or differentiations : the cells 
begin in the work of life to split up, and to assume various forms and 
74 
qualities.
The stomach cells undertake digestion, the blood cells 
exchange of matter, the lung cells respiration, the liver cells the 
formation of bile.
On the other hand, the muscle cells devote 
themselves exclusivel)' to motion, the sensory cells to various 
perceptions ; the touch cells of the skin learn to comprehend vari- 
ations of pressure and of warmth ; the hearing cells to distinguish 
waves of sound, the seeing cells those of light ; but the most 
difficult and brilliant course is run by the nerve cells ; and among 
these again are the ingenious brain cells which in the bold race 
carry off the highest prize, and as soul-cells elevate themselves far 
above all the other kinds.
This most significant division of labour of the cells — or, as the 
anatomist says, building up of tissues — is completed in the indi- 
vidual development of every animal and of every plant under our 
eyes within a few days.
The development, however, which we see 
here going on so astonishingly fast under the microscope, is only a 
short repetition, brought about through hereditary transmission, of 
a long and slow historical process — a historical precedent which 
required many millions of years, and in which the division of 
labour of the cells (in the strictest sense of the word) was caused 
by accommodation to the various life-activities of the cells in the 
battle for existence.
The cells behave therein even just as the 
well educated citizens of a well regulated civilised state.
In reality, 
our own bodies, as those of all the higher animals, are such civilised 
cell-states.
The so-called tissues of the body, those of the muscles, 
of the nerves, of the glands, of the bones, of the ligaments, answer 
to the various ranks or guilds of a state, or yet more accurately to 
the hereditary castes, as we meet with them in ancient Egypt, and 
still at the present day in India.
The tissues are hereditary cell- 
castes in the civilised state — the many-celled organism.
The 
organs also, which again are constituted of various tissues, are to be 
compared to the various offices and institutions in the state.
At 
the top of all stands the mighty central government — the nerve- 
centre — the brain.
The more elaborately developed the higher 
animal, the more strongly centralised the cell-monarchy, so much 
the more powerful is the ruling brain, and so much the more nobly 
75 
constituted is the telegraphic apparatus of the nerve system which 
places the brain in connexion with its most important subordinates 
in government, the muscles and sense organs.
In comparison with this, the arrangement of the soul-apparatus 
in our previously-observed worm is very simple, but it is not 
different in kind.
If we irritate the worm in any way, if we stimu- 
late its tender skin with the point of a needle or with a bit of 
ice, it is at once made aware of the corresponding change of pressure 
or of temperature by the sensory skin-cells, which, as sentinels, keep 
watch everywhere over the outer surface of the skin ; they at once 
telegraph their perception through the skin-nerves to the brain.
In the same way, the waves of sound which meet the auditory 
bladder, are perceived by the auditory-cells of the latter as noises 
or sounds, and are telegi-aphically announced by the auditory- 
nerves to the brain.
Not less do the seeing-cells of the eye, when 
struck by a beam of light, send at once a light or a colour telegram 
to the brain.
Here sits the high government of the cell-constituted 
state, consisting of a few large star-shaped cells, whose ramifications 
are in immediate connexion on one side with the sensation-bearing 
afferent nerves, and on the other with movement-exciting muscle 
nerves.
As soon as telegraphic information of any variation in 
the surrounding outer world reaches the central government 
from the sensory nerves, this information is passed on from 
one to another by the excited brain-cells (or ganglion-cells) as 
sensation, and the high council now determines what is to be done.
The result of this determination is telegraphed as will by means 
of the muscle nerves to the muscles which forthwith carry out 
the command by contraction of their filament-cells, by movement.
Without doubt therefore, the most important role in soul-life 
is played by the intricate, and reticularly connected nerve cells of 
the brain, the ganglion-cells, or soul-cells ; for in reality they form 
the central government of the whole many-celled animal body.
They take up all the views of the outer world which are sent by the 
sense-cells by means of the centripetal telegraph wires of the 
sensory-nerves to the brain.
They impart at the same time also all 
the commands of the will, which go out by the centrifugal conduct 
76 
of the motor nerves to the muscles.
Moreover, these most 
remarkable soul-cells of the brain perform further that most of 
all remarkable and mysterious work which we in one word designate 
as unagination (vorstellung).
These it is that in the higher animals, 
as in man, bring about the most elaborate of all soul-activities, 
those of thought and comprehension, of reason and consciousness.
Whilst we here touch upon the highest limits and the noblest 
function of the soul-life — reason and consciousness, we desire how- 
ever to add the remark, that we are certainly as yet entirely in 
ignorance of the real nature of this mysterious work of the cells, 
but nevertheless we are in a position, by the aid of comparative 
psychology and the history of developmetit, to throw considerable 
light upon it.
For, first of all, we see by the comparative study of 
souls in animals, a long gradation of development, on which all 
conceivable degrees of reason and consciousness are represented, 
from the quite irrational to the most rational animal — from sponges 
and polypes, to dogs and elephants.
Secondly, we see in every 
child, as in every higher animal, that reason and consciousness are 
not yet present at birth, but are slowly and gradually developed.
Thirdly, and lastly, we even accept it as true that no sharp line of 
demarcation exists between conscious and unconscious soul-activity 
any more than between intelligent and unintelligent thought (?), 
that rather these contrasts often touch one another without any 
fixed limits and pass one into the other.
This dark question oi consciousness, as is well known, plays quite 
a chief part in the psychological battles of the day.
The famous 
physiologist, Du Bois-Reymond, in his "ignorabimus" discourse at 
the Leipsic Scientific Meeting has declared consciousness to be an 
entirely insoluble problem — a limit of scientific knowledge which 
the human mind will never overstep, even by the most extensive 
development, Many others regard consciousness as an exclusive 
prerogative of man, which is entirely wanting to all the animals.
This last view will certainly be shared by no one who has attentively 
and carefully observed the conscious and reflective actions of dogs 
and horses, of bees and ants, and other intelligent animals.
But 
even the former view is untenable; for careful self-observation 
77 
teaches us how, in a thousand ways, conscious and unconscious 
actions pass over continually one into the other.
Countless 
performances of daily life, as e.g., the use of drinking vessels, of 
knife and fork, reading and writing, the playing of musical instru- 
ments, &c., depend on a complicated working of nerves and muscles, 
which originally must have been slowly learnt with careful reflection 
and evident consciousness, but gradually by exercise and habit 
has become quite unconscious.
Every morning when we wash 
and dress, get up and go out, we perform hundreds of complicated 
movements quite unconsciously, which originally must have been 
painfully and gradually learnt, with consciousness.
Conversely, the 
most various unconscious actions return at once to clear conscious- 
ness, whenever from any cause our attention is directed thereto 
and self-observation is aroused.
No sooner do we make a false 
step in going up or down stairs or strike a false note on the piano, 
than we are at once made conscious of the unconscious act.
Besides this, we can also without doubt follow up, step by step, 
the gradual progress of the development of consciousness in every 
child.
On the score of such matters of fact, we can no longer 
doubt that consciousness depends on a complicated working 
of the soul-cells, first arising gradually through adaptation to 
surrounding circumstances, and thus by inherited adaptations 
being slowly developed more extensively.
We learn the same 
from the comparative development-history of soul-life in the 
animal kingdom.
The complicated molecular movements in 
the protoplasm of soul-cells, whose highest result is reason and 
thought, understanding and consciousness, have first been acquired 
in the course of many millions of years by a process of natural 
education.
For even the brain, the organ of those functions, in 
the course of this long space of time, has been quite slowly and 
gradually developed from the simplest to the most elaborated form.
Here, as everywhere, the development of the organ goes hand in 
hand with that of its function : the instrument perfects its elabor- 
ation with its work.* 
* It will be observed that in these and the preceding remarks of Hasckel's, 
nothing whatever is really shewn as to the origittation of consciousness, and 
78 
For the establishment of this view, so weighty in its conse- 
quences, the comparative observation of the nerve systems of 
different classes of animals is of the greatest importance.
The 
simply constructed brain of the worm, with the few nerve-threads 
streaming out from it, has become the starting point of a number 
of variously constructed and very complicated arrangements in the 
nerve-system of the higher animals.
This last bears the same 
relation to the former that the great tele.sr^iphic system of the present 
German kingdom, with its hundreds of stations and thousands of 
offices, bears to the first simple model of an electric telegraph, by 
means of which, forty years ago, the inventor of the same introduced 
into the world one of the most important means of exchange of 
thoughts.
The more highly developed the faculties of perception, 
will, and thought are in an animal, so much the more developed 
and centralised is the constitution of the soul-apparatus which 
performs the physical work, so much the more does controlling 
power rest in the nerve-centre, on which the guidance of the whole, 
as a unit, depends.
It is therefore customary to call the centre of the nerve-system 
(the brain, as we may say speaking broadly), the "seat of the soul." 
In reality however this customary expression is inexact, and we 
can only accord to it a metaphorical meaning in the same sense 
as we call a clever house-wife the "soul of the house," or an all- 
powerful minister the "soul of the state." As little, in fact, as we arc 
willing to deny their individual souls to the other persons connected 
with the central power in a state, just so little dare we disown the 
last in the millions of cells in the soul apparatus of those higher 
animals whose brain we style the "seat of the soul.
When in the 
Franco-German war of 187 1, Paris, which is in fact the soul of the 
centralized kingdom of France, and according to Victor Hugo 
the soul also of the world, was entirely surrounded by our victorious 
armies, when telegraphic communications with the rest of France 
was entirely cut off, then nevertheless incessantly in its severed 
limbs the many complicated telegraph-network kept on working, 
though the course of the development is indicated, it may be disputed whether 
the cause is adequately accounted for.
79 
and Gambetta's imperturbable soul incessantly organised new 
armies for the deliverence of the besieged capital.
So also are we 
taught by philosophical experiment on beheaded frogs and insects, 
that, in spite of the severance of the brain, the soul-life in the 
remaining parts of the body can still subsist for some long time.
Only the unity of the central guidance of the whole is overthrown; 
only the highest soul-actions — understanding and consciousness — 
are thereby wholly or in part abolished; other actions still continue.
If we place a drop of corrosive acid on the skin of the beheaded 
frog, at once it wipes it quickly off, as if it still possessed a head ; 
or if we hold a beheaded beetle fast by one leg, at once it endeav- 
ours with the other five to make its escape, as hastily and readily 
as if it had not lost its brain.
Sense-activity and perception, will 
and muscle-movement, thus continue for some long time after the 
brain has been removed.
All that has been lost with the latter is 
the unity of consciousness— the central government.
We must 
therefore distinguish carefully between this conscious central-soul 
of the many-celled animal, and the individual soul of its countless 
cells ; the latter are in truth subordinates to the former, but remain 
ever to a certain extent independent.
The organ of the central-soul is the whole of the soul-cells 
collectively, the ganglion-cells of the brain; the organ of each 
individual cell-soul, on the other hand, is the body of the cell 
itself— protoplasm and cell-kernel, or some part thereof 
IL 
For comparing the lower and higher steps of development of 
the soul-life there is perhaps, after the mammals, no class of animals 
of such importance as that of insects.
For albeit all the countless 
different sorts of insects exhibit only an endless variation of a single 
original theme; albeit the modern theory of development accord- 
ingly derives all butterflies and beetles, all flies and bees, all hymen- 
optera, neuroptera, &c., from a single common root-form ; never- 
theless, the diversities in the development of their soul-activities 
is quite extraordinarily great.
The well-known contrasts between 
the stupid goose and the sagacious falcon (hawk?), between the 
80 
stolid rhinoceros and the clever elephant, appear of no importance in 
comparison with the tremendous differences which the soul-activities 
of the various insects present to us.
On one side many of the 
inferior insects, e.g. plant-lice, cochineal-insects, bugs, and especially 
parasitical insects of various kinds, stand on a very low step of the 
ladder of cultivation, not rising above that of most of the worms : 
eating and drinking being their only need.
On the other side, the 
higher sorts, and above all the social insects — the bees and wasps, 
the ants and termites, that form themselves into regular states or 
societies — rise to a height in the mind-activity which admits only of 
comparison with the state -forming peoples of civilisation.
The 
wonderful division of labour, especially among ants, leads to the 
separation of their states into various parts, the subjects of which 
are distinguished by special tokens and peculiarities.
There have 
we to distinguish not only males and females, but also soldiers and 
workers, farmers and labourers, rulers and slaves.
Their agricul- 
tural and gardening activity is not contented with carefully collecting 
provisions and the preservation of nutriment, but rises even to actual 
culture of vegetables, and to the careful breeding of their milch- kine, 
the aphides or plant-lice, whose sweet honey-sap they suck.
Not 
less worthy of wonder is the architectural talent of ants and termites 
which appears in the planning of their magnificent palaces, with 
thousands of halls and chambers, corridors and staircases, doors 
and windows.
Nor in these arts of peace do they forget the duty of 
the rough art of war, and the military talent with which contending 
armies of ants at this very day seek to circumvent or to surround 
one another, shows very significantly that they too are children of 
the nineteenth century.
In one sort of ants in S.
America indeed, 
there has even been developed from the excessive use of weapons, 
an exclusive military esprit, which hasjed^to the ^entire giving up 
of the early peaceful occupations, and to the robber-life of hordes 
of Circassians.
Lastly, let us not forget that even the institution 
of slavery, which belongs to human civilisation, has been practised 
already longer by the ants than by our own highly constituted and 
feudally organised race.
There are ant-states which carry on a 
regular rearing of slaves, which rob other sorts of their young and 
81 
thence draw for themselves genuine slaves ; nay afterwards, even 
these slaves, denying all the ties of nature, prefer even the advantage 
of their cruel lords to that of their own race, and are the very first 
in their robber-raids to help to carry off new flocks of slaves.
Although these highly interesting facts of the intellectual life of the 
ants were discovered more than a hundred years ago by Huber 
and other entomologists, they were nevertheless held for a long 
time to be mere fabulous products of fancy, and the numerous 
investigations of modern time, whilst adding further new dis- 
coveries, have first fully established them.
In truth, the intellectual contrasts between the clever ants and 
their stupid milch-kine, the aphides, are greater than the tremendous 
difference between the god-like genius of a Goethe or a Shakspeare 
and the poor animal-soul of a Hottentot or a Bushman.
And yet 
in the one case, as in the other, there exists between the extreme 
ends a long row of intermediate degrees.
All have still a common 
original source.
As most men consider our race to be derived 
from a common father of all men, so almost all zoologists are 
agreed that all those various groups of insects are derived from a 
common insect-stem.
Consequently, the most widely diflering 
soul-activities of these must have been gradually developed by 
means of adaptation to the differing life-circumstances, and then, 
by continued inheritances, have become turned into the so-called 
instincts.
No idea has called forth so many errors and misunderstandings 
in comparative physiology, as what is called instinct.
Thus while 
the older natural history made all individual kinds of animals 
with their special peculiarities to come into existence by a super- 
natural act of creation, it was obliged at the same time to assume 
that the specific soul-activity also of such a class had been 
created, and thus by this necessity every step in life of the 
animal was definitely determined from beforehand.
The whole 
of the impulses which accordingly were necessarily bound to deter- 
mine without possibility of variation the modes of action of the 
kinds of animals, and among which the most note-worthy are the 
so called art-impulses of the nest-building birds, bees, &c., were 
6 
82 
regarded as having been originally a created instinct.
This gener- 
ally received view is become altogether untenable, since we know 
through Darwin that neither are the individual kinds of animals, as 
such, created, nor are their special instincts unalterable.
We now 
know that all kinds of one class of animals spring originally from 
one common kind of stock, and that, like their other peculi- 
arities, their instincts also are subject to alteration and trans- 
formation through the powerful influence of the training of nature.
As animals are placed under new and unaccustomed life-circum- 
stances, they adapt themselves to these, find new thoughts, make 
new inventions, acquire new instincts.
Necessity is the mother of 
invention, and practice makes perfect.
The hard battle for 
existence makes in fact everywhere and at all times such stringent 
demands on the impulse of self-preservation of animals, that they 
are just as much compelled to learn and work, as men are.
It is 
not true, even though now-a-days it is often asserted to be the case, 
that beavers build their water-palaces, swallows their nests, bees 
their honeycombs always and everywhere after the same manner 
to-day as they did two thousand or eight thousand years ago.
On the contrary, we know from the most reliable observation that 
even these most highly developed art-impulses are subject to vari- 
ations of really great importance, and adapt themselves to the 
advantageous circumstances of any individual locality.
The last 
of the Mohicans of the beavers which survive even to-day here and 
there in Germany have adapted themselves to the police-regulations 
of civilised Hfe and no longer build those grand water-palaces as 
their forefathers did two thousand years ago.
Whilst here in 
Europe the cuckoo lays her eggs in strange nests, in America she 
has not adopted that bad habit.
Every experienced bee-master 
knows how the special customs of bees vary in manifold ways in 
different hives.
It is universally known that nightingales, finches 
and other singing birds learn new melodies, appropriate by 
imitation new tunes, consequently change their musical instinct.
And do we not observe quite palpably in our house-dogs, terriers, 
colleys, &c., how new and diverse instincts have been acquired by 
training, practice and habit ?
83 
Observation carried on impartially and without prejudgment, 
by comparison and inquiry, thus makes it indubitable that the 
so-called "instinct" of animals is nothing else than the sum total 
of the soul-activities which were originally acquired through adapt- 
ation, and have become fixed by habit and passed on by inheritance 
from generation to generation.
Executed originally with conscious- 
ness and consideration, many of the instinctive actions of animals 
have become ««conscious in the course of time, just as in the same 
way happens also in the habitual intellectual actions of man.
Consequently, neither is instinct an exclusive brain-property of the 
animal, nor intelligence a special prerogative of man.
On the 
contrary, there is perceived by the impartial study of comparative 
psychology, a long, long ladder of steps of gradual progress and 
development of forms of soul-life, leading down step by step from 
the higher to the lower men, from the highly complicated to the 
simple animals, even down to yonder simple worm, whose simple 
nerve-knots furnish the starting point for all the countless brain 
forms of this ladder.
As in reality no break exists anywhere in this ladder, and as 
the simple soul-apparatus of our worm already contains all the 
elementary forms — nerves, sense organs, and muscles — of which in 
the most highly complicated manner the wonderful soul-apparatus 
of man is constructed ; so it is now universally agreed by all in- 
quirers in natural science, that in all these animals which are 
furnished with a nerve-system, there exists a soul-life, in fact, a 
psyche.
III.
But now how stands the case with those lower animals which 
are without a nerve-system, even of the simplest kind, e.g., corals, 
polyps, sponges, &c.
? Have we in the want of a nerve-system 
what constitutes the lower limit of soul-life ?
Or is there here a 
soul without nerves 1 Scientific men of note, e.g., Virchow and 
Du Bois-Reymond reply in the negative to our last question, and 
maintain that there can be no idea of the existence of real soul-life 
84 
in these nerveless animals.* We are of the contrary opinion, and 
rest our conclusion on the consent of all zoologists who have 
devoted themselves long and perseveringly to the exact observ- 
ation of such nerveless animals.
Nay, we are even convinced 
that these very nerveless, but nevertheless soul-possessing animals, 
are of the highest interest to comparative psychology, and first 
make known to us the true key for the comprehension of soul- 
development.
The most instructive, best known and most accurately 
observed in this noteworthy group of lower animals, is the common 
fresh-water polyp, the Hydra.
Truly this little tender, tiny creature 
is spread everywhere in our ponds and ditches, and is always 
to be found in abundance ; yet only a few anticipate what a world 
of important disclosures, on the most important secrets of Nature, 
this despised little creature affords us.
Its simple body has the 
form of an oval cup, which is sometimes coloured grey or green, 
sometimes brown or red.
The hollow of the cup is the stomach 
of the hydra; the opening is its mouth.
Round about the mouth 
stands a circle of from four to eight fine threads, which serve alike 
as feelers for touching, and as holders for seizing their food.
Eyes and ears, muscles and nerves, we seek in vain in our hydra, 
and yet we are convinced that it has plenty of perception and 
motion.
If we touch the slender, long outstretched body but 
gently with the point of a needle, in a moment it draws itself up 
too-ether into a little round ball.
If we place a tumbler with 
hydras in it at the window, in a few hours we shall have all the 
polyps collected together on the light side of the glass.
They 
therefore have perception of light, though they have no eyes, and 
move crawUng into the light, though they are without muscles.
Sensation and voluntary motion, the most important tokens of 
of animal soul-life, are therefore undoubtedly present, and never- 
theless these animals are devoid of the proper organs of soul — 
* Hoeckel's case seems here to be materially strengthened by the recent 
discovery (which Professor F.
M. Balfour holds to be demonstrated, viWir Address 
at British Association, Section D, given in Nature for Sept.
2, 1880), that the 
nerves have been developed from processes of epithelial cells.— Z.W.V.
85 
muscles and nerves.
How is this riddle to be explained ?
Have 
we here a function without an organ, a soul without soul-apparatus?
The decisive answer to this question is given us by the micro- 
scope.
The cup-shaped body of the hydra consists really of two 
cups of equal size fastened into one another, whose walls closely 
touch each other on all sides.
If we now observe the thin fine 
section of double-wall of the hollow hydra body with a strong 
magnifying power, we see that the two cups consist each of a 
peculiar layer of cells.
These two cell-layers have quite different 
properties and functions.
The cells of the inner layer are exclu- 
sively concerned with the vegetative work of nourishment — 
digestion and assimilation.
Those of the outer layer, on the 
contrary, negotiate the animal functions of sensation and motion.
Now, if we pull to pieces this outer layer of skin with a needle, 
we shall observe in many of the separated skin-cells a long stringy 
process.
More exact investigation shows that this thin stringy 
part of the cell runs circularly between the two layers round the.
cup-shaped body, and causes the contraction of the latter, just like 
a muscle ; while the outer, roundish, nucleated part of the same 
cell has the power of sensation.
We stand thus in face of the remark- 
able and highly important fact that a single cell, alone by itself, 
fulfils the most important duties of the soul : the outer, roundish 
part of the cell having sensation ; the inner, thread-shaped part 
having will, voluntary motion.
The outside half of the cell is 
nerve, the inner muscle ; rightly therefore did Kleinenberg, the 
discoverer of these soul-cells of the hydra, call them " nerve- 
muscle-cells." The whole soul-apparatus of our polyp consists in 
fact of nothing more than a simple layer of nerve-muscle cells, 
and each individual of these cells performs in simplest gviise just 
what in vastly more elevated form the complicated soul-apparatus 
of the higher animals can do with its different nerve-muscles and 
mind-cells.
Naturally, however, here there is wanting entirely a 
central apparatus — a brain ; and instead thereof " the seat of the 
soul " is in our little polyp the Tnkole outer skin.
We need there- 
fore no longer wonder at the astonishing divisibility of the hydra, 
first made known in the year 1744 by Trembley's experiments.
If we at the present time cut up a fresh-water polyp into fifty little 
bits, there will be developed therefrom in a few weeks just so many 
complete polyps.
Every little bit of the cup-shaped body at once 
grows up again into an entire polyp.
The cell-souls of all the 
individual nerve-muscle-cells are completely alike.
The nerve-muscle-cells of the hydra are therefore, as the 
Berlin housewife says, "maids of all work." Each individual 
performs in the economy of this little polyp all the various duties 
which in the higher animals are distributed among muscle, nerve 
and sense-cells of different kinds.
All these last widely differing 
sorts of cells consequently, have arisen by means of division of 
labour from simple nerve-muscle-cells.
The next result of this division of labour is shewn us by the 
umbrella-shaped sea-bells, or Medusa, which are in fact nearly 
related to the hydra polyps, but are considerably more highly 
developed.
Wlioever has spent a few weeks at the sea-side has 
doubtless at times seen shoals of these beautiful bell-shaped jelly- 
soft creatures swimming about; and if anyone in bathing has 
come into disagreeable contact with them, he will remember the 
unpleasant burning sensation which was thereby excited, like 
touching a stinging-neltle.
The larger class to which the medusae 
belong, are therefore called "Sea-nettles." If now with the aid 
of a large glass vessel we cautiously capture such a medusa, 
and if we accurately examine its bodily structure, we discover at 
once specialised soul-organs.
On the edge of its umbrella-shaped 
body real eyes of simplest kind and hearing bladders are keeping 
watch ; and attentive nerves communicate intercourse between the 
sensory-cells and the muscle-cells which work the powerful swimming 
motions of the medusa.
Only here muscles and nerves stand in 
most intimate connexion with their original seat, the outer skin ; 
and a veritable brain, as a unifying central organ of the whole soul- 
apparatus, is still wanting to the medusae.
Compared with the 
simple, diminutive, stationary hydra polyp, the great beautiful 
lively medusa seems to us undoubtedly a far higher and more 
consummate animal.
And yet these two forms of animals, which 
were formerly placed in quite different classes, stand in the closest 
87 
constitutional relation ; for in historic times has the medusa-form 
developed out of the hydra-form.
Yes, even at the present day, 
the majority of medusae arise directly from polyps.
From the 
stomach-wall of the little hydra-like sea-polyp proceeds a bud 
which gradually shapes itself into a medusa, and later on falls off 
like the ripe fruit of a tree, and swims about free.
From the eggs 
however of this medusa there do not again arise other medusae, 
but polyps — germs which becoming stationary grow into hydra-like 
cups.
Yet further in another relation is the remarkable class of 
hydra-medusae of the highest interest lor our comparative soul- 
study.
For out of it have developed the wonderful Siphonophora; 
those swimming animal-steps which for the study of the divisioti of 
labour are so extraordinarily important.
The siphonophora are 
found swimming on the smooth mirror of the warmer seas, though 
only at certain times and not abundantly.
They belong to the 
most splendid forms of the inexhaustible riches of Nature, and 
whoever has once had the good fortune attentively to observe living 
siphonophora, will never forget the noble sight of their wonderful 
forms and movements.
They may be best compared to swim- 
ming flower-stems, whose variegated leaves flowers and fruits 
are delicately formed, tenderly coloured, and shaped like polished 
crystal.
Each single flower-like, or fruit-shaped appendage of the 
swimming stem is really a medusa-individual.
The various medusae 
of the society have assumed however, through division of labour, 
totally different forms.
One part of these medusae has to do only 
with the movement of swimming, another with the reception of 
nourishment and digestion, a third with sensory perception, a 
fourth with defence and attack, a fifth with egg-making, &c.
The 
various life tasks which a single ordinary medusa fulfils for itself 
are therefore here divided among the different persons of the 
society, and these have all transformed their bodies correspondently 
to their special life -task.
In like manner as in the ant-republic, so here also in that ol 
siphonophora, many variously-formed animals of one sort are 
united into a higher social community.
But whilst in the higher- 
88 
standing ant-republic, the ideal bond of union of social interests, 
and of feeling of public duty, holds together the body of citizens 
remaining free ; in this state, on the other hand, the individual 
members of the community are forcibly held together in immediate 
corporate connexion, as slaves under the yoke of the state.
It is 
true that here also each individual possesses his individual psyche ; 
if separated from the stem, can move about of his own pleasure, 
and have separate sensation.
But, nevertheless, the whole trunk 
possesses an individual central-will, on which the separate indi- 
viduals depend, and a sensation of the community, which is shared 
by each individual with all the others.
Each of these medusa- 
individuals of the siphonophor-stock can therefore say of himself, 
with Faust: "Ah!
two souls live in my breast !" The egoistic 
soul of the separate individual lives in compromise with the social 
soul of the whole stock, i.e., the state.
Woe to those medusae of the siphonophor-state which in a 
blind egoism loosen themselves from their community, and wish 
to lead a free Hfe on their own account.
Unable to perform all 
the separate duties which are necessary to their self-support, and 
which have been done for them by their fellow-citizens, if separated 
from the latter, they go quickly to the bottom.
For one of the 
medusee can only swim, another can only feel, a third only eat, a 
fourth only catch prey and keep off enemies, &c.
Only the 
harmonious joint working and the mutual offices of all the fellow- 
members of this swimming company, only the common mind, the 
central soul, which binds all in true love with one another, can 
confer on the existence of the individuals, as well as on the great 
whole, a continuing duration.
So also in human civilised com- 
munities, a continuing existence is only rendered possible by the 
true fulfilment of civil and social duties on the part of the several 
citizens.* 
* In our ignorance of the real nature of the psyche, we must "beware of 
hasty generahsations" in drawing analogies between animal bodies and human 
or ant communities.

IV.
The cell-soul is therefore a perfectly general manifestation of 
organised life ; the soul-cell, on the contrary, a special one.
No 
doubt our conception of the cell-soul is by no means yet universally 
recognised, and is energetically contested even at present by 
eminent authorities, e.g., Von Virchow.
But on the firm ground 
of the development theory of modern times, due to the reformation 
introduced by Darwin, we must maintain that our "theory of the 
cell-soul" is as much a necessary as it is an important consequence 
of the unitary or monistic conception of Nature.
We must there 
fore accordingly be allowed to cast a hasty glance at those lowest 
groups of beings, which most especially seem to us to bear witness 
to the truth of this pregnant theory.
Deep down on the lowest step of organised life, midway in 
between the limits of the animal and plant kindoms, and most 
closely uniting both great kingdoms, lives and works that wonderful 
world of microscopic organisms, invisible to the naked eye, which 
are generally designated as primeval infusoria, or protozoa.
The 
great majority of these protozoa remain their whole life in the 
form of a simple single cell, and nevertheless this cell confessedly 
possesses alike sensation and voluntary motion.
In the lively 
" eye-lash" or ciliated animalcules — the infusoria — these soul- 
activities are exhibited in so surprising a degree, that the famous 
investigator of infusoria, Ehrenberg, unhesitatingly and with the 
greatest certainty maintains that even here there must be present 
nerves and muscle, brain and mind organs.
And yet as a matter 
of fact, not a trace of any such things appears.
The sole and only 
material supporter of the soul-life here is the protoplasm of the 
cell-body, the substance containing within it the cell-nucleus, 
forming a soul-apparatus of the simplest kind.
And if we but 
once become convinced that already among these single-celled 
infusoria there are very different characters and temperaments — 
clever and stupid, strong and weak, lively and dull, light-loving 
and light-avoiding individuals — we find that we can account for 
90 
the countless ramifications of soul-life in these little creatures only 
through the acceptance of delicate differences of composition in 
their protoplasmic substance.
Soul-activity in the broader sense is thus a universal property 
of all organised cells.
But if that be the case, then we cannot 
entirely deny a soul-life even to plants.
For even the lowest plants 
are simple cells ; and in all the higher plants, as in the higher 
animals, the body consists of countless single cells.
Only in the 
latter, the division of labour among the cells and the centraHsation 
of the state have advanced much farther than in the former.
The 
form of government in the animal body is the ctW-mouarchy ; in 
the plant body, the c^\\.-re public.
As all the single cells in the 
plant body remain much more independent than in the animal 
body, the oneness of the soul meets us far less prominently in the 
former than in the latter.
Only a few specially important plants, 
as the delicate sensitive plants, the fly-catching dionsea, form 
exceptions to this rule.
In consequence of this, the soul-life of 
plants has been much less investigated than that of animals, and 
only a few naturalists have turned their attention to it.
Among 
these should be named the acute founder of Psycho-physik, 
Professor Fechner of Leipsic, who has discussed the question of 
plant-soul in a series of ingenious writings.
In other ways, the 
necessity of the acceptance of a plant-soul has also already been 
sufficiently established, so that we are not in a position to draw a 
sharp lirre between the animal and plant kingdoms.
The one- 
celled infusoria or protozoa form the bridge which unites both 
great kingdoms of organic life into one great whole.
Only the 
ramifications of soul-activities are extraordinarily various, and in 
both kingdoms very different.
No reproach has been more abundantly thrown out against 
the natural science of the day, and in particular against its most 
hopeful off-shoot — the development theory — than that it degrades 
living nature to a soulless mechanism, banishes everthing ideal 
from the world of reality, and destroys all poetry.
We believe 
that our unprejudiced comparative and genealogical observation of 
soul-life invalidates this erroneous reproach.
For according to our 
91 
unitary or monistic conception of Nature, exactly the contrary is 
the case — all living matter has soul* Far from believing in a raw 
and soulless matter, as our adversaries represent, we on the 
contrary are obliged to accept in all living matter, in all proto- 
plasm, the first elements of all soul-life : the simple form of 
sensations of the agreeable and disagreeable, the simple form of 
movements of attraction and repulsion.
The steps, however, of 
the formation and constitution of this soul are different in the 
different living creatures, and carry us on gradually from the quiet 
cell-soul through a long series of ascending and intermediate steps, 
right up to the conscious and intelligent soul of man.
Still less can we concede that the poetic and ideal 
conception of the world is endangered through our monistic 
development doctrine.
No doubt we nowadays miss the 
nymphs and naiads, the dryads and oreads, with which the 
old Greek fountains and streams were alive, the woods and hills 
peopled.
They have long ago vanished with the gods of Olympus, 
but in place of these man-like demigods, stand the countless 
elementary spirits of the cells.
And if ever there were a conception 
in the highest degree poetical and at the same time true, it is cer- 
tainly the brilliant discovery — that in the smallest of little worms, 
and in the most invisible flowers, there live thousands of indepen- 
dent delicate souls ; that in each of the single-celled microscopic 
infusoria an individual soul is active, just as much as in the blood 
cells which restlessly circle in our blood, in the brain cells which 
are elevated to the highest of all soul-offices — that of clear consci- 
ousness.
From this point of view we see in the doctrine of the 
cell-soul the most important advance to the reconciliation of the 
idealist and the realist conceptions of Nature — the old and the new 
modes of regarding the universe.
Thus ends the Essay; and now with your permission I 
should like to make a few brief remarks on it.
* There may however be different kinds of psyche.

Like most Germans, Hseckel thinks that his interpretation of 
facts is so palpably and unmistakably the right one, that it cannot 
be disputed.
Nevertheless it is disputed, and amongst others, by 
no less eminent a person than the President of the last meeting of 
the British Association, Professor Alhnan ; and a brief summary of 
the points of divergence in the conclusions which these two 
physicists draw from the facts which scientific investigation has 
disclosed, may be of use.
As to the facts themselves, there appears to be no difference 
of opinion of any great importance; in proof of which I will simply 
quote one or two passages from Professor Allman's address : — 
"In the most complex animals, even in man himself, the component cells, 
notwithstanding their frequent modificaiion and the usual intimacy of their 
union, are far from losing their individuality." 
Again : — 
"The whole complex organism is a society of cells in which every indi- 
vidual cell possesses an independence, an autonomy, not at once so obvious as in 
the blood cells, but not the less real.
Willi this autonomy of each element, 
there is at the same time a subordination of each to the whole, thus establishing 
a unity in the entire organism, and a concert and harmony between all the 
phenomena of its life.
"In this society of cells each has its own work to perform, and the life of 
the organism is made up of the lives of its component cells.
Here it is that we 
find most distinctly expressed the great law of the physiological division of 
labour." 
In spite of this agreement as to the facts of cell-phenomena, 
however, Professor AUman does not give in to the theory of the 
cell-soul.
He does not allow consciousness to the cell.
Living 
matter is with him indeed distinctly separated from non-living 
matter.
I think, however, we should not misrepresent him in saying 
that he regards what he calls life as belonging to a sort of department 
of mechanics ; different from non-living matter, but still simply 
mechanical in its operations.
The three distinguishing marks of 
living matter are — assimilation, reproduction, and irritability or 
responsiveness to excitations.
The last of these he calls "the one 
grand character of all living beings." And it is this which seems 
(to my mind at least) so difficult to regard as acting without 
consciousness.
" There is no greater difficulty," he says, speaking 
93 
of the contraction of the heart of a recently killed frog under 
stimulus, "in conceiving of contractility as a property of protoplasm 
than there is of conceiving of attraction as a property of the 
magnet." And in this instance, the divergence from apparently 
purely mechanical motion is certainly not obvious.
But there are 
other matters of observation in which there is, as he himself says, 
the " semblance of volition" of a very striking kind, as e.g., the case 
cited by him, of the swarm-spore (i.e. practically, the young) of 
certain plants, which when an obstacle is placed in its course (I am 
quoting from his address) "will, as if to avoid it, change the 
direction of its motion, and retreat by a reversion of the stroke of 
its cilia." The explanation of this phenomenon supplied by him 
is, "that the irritability of the protoplasm of the ciliated spore, 
responding to an external stimulus, sets in motion a mechanism 
derived by inherita?icefrom its ancestors, and whose parts are correlated 
to a common end — the preservatioti of the individual." But this seems 
difficult to regard as an explanation, except in connexion with the 
idea of consciousness.
And in the instance of the beheaded frog, referred to in 
Hasckel's essay, consciousness does not exist in the frog itself; 
so far as the frog as a whole is concerned, the movement caused 
by stimulation must be automatic ; but the ganglion in the 
spinal cord may be conscious ; and it is dififtcult to disconnect 
the idea of consciousness from that of an apparent sensibility 
to pain, or discomfort.
The accidents of the dead inorganic 
world seem to constitute a continual call on mind (however 
Ave may attempt to explain or define the word) to assert 
itself The animate by modifying, preventing or continuing the 
influences of the inanimate, does on the whole by slow degrees 
gain the mastery over the inanimate; and apparent accidents, by 
becoming the occasions of the action and development of mind, 
may thus claim to be seen no longer as accidents, but as links 
in a chain (however interrupted from time to time by retrogressions 
and degenerations)— a chain, nevertheless, of assured progress.
There is however another question connected with this matter, 
which is one of very great importance, in which it may be quite 
94 
possible for us to agree with Professor AUman, even while inclining 
to the "cell-soul" theory.
"Admitting," he says, i.e., for the sake of 
argument, "that every living cell were a conscious and thinking 
being, are we therefore justified in asserting that its consciousness, 
like its irritability, is a property of the matter of which it is 
composed?" and he goes on to argue to the contrary, on the 
ground of the want of analogy between the phenomena of living 
matter and those of consciousness.
He would regard protoplasm 
as being only a requisite condition for the manifestation of the 
phenomena of consciousness, and supports his supposition by an 
illustration : " The rays which lie invisible beyond the violet in 
the spectrum of the sun have their refrangibility altered, and are 
made visible by being passed through certain infusions.
Even the 
generation of these rays cannot," he says, "be regarded as a 
property of the medium which by changing their refrangibility can 
alone render them apparent." To which I may perhaps add 
another illustration : One's first idea on observing the phenomenon 
of the formation of yeast on a sugary liquid, would be, that the 
yeast-fungus was iti the sugary liquid ; this, however, is not the 
case ; the fungus germs are floating in the air (as has been ascer- 
tained by experiments in which the air is excluded) ; and the 
sugary liquid merely supplies one of the requisite conditions for 
the manifestation of the fungus growth.
So it may be that the 
protoplasm may be merely (when living) one of the conditions 
amidst which something subtler than air or even than the 
luminiferous ether and which cannot possibly be excluded, may be 
enabled to play its part.
This part of the question has been very fairly put by Professor 
Huxley in the "Nineteenth Century" for April, 1879.
He men- 
tions three possible hypotheses on the relation between material 
and immaterial phenomena : — 
1. That an immaterial substance of mind exists ; and that it is affected by 
the mode of motion of the sensorium in such a way as to give rise to sensation.
2. That sensation is a direct effect of the mode of motion of the sensorium, 
brought about without the intervention of any substance of mind.
3. That the sensation is neither directly, nor indirectly, an effect of the 
mode of motion of the sensorium, but has an independent cause, and, properly 
96 
speaking, is therefore not an effect of the motion of the sensorium, but a con- 
comitant of it.
While holding that none of these speculations can be seriously 
regarded as anything but a more or less convenient working hypo- 
thesis, he himself inclines to the second, which he calls the 
"simplest;" the " simplicity'^ of which, however, to some minds 
may appear as consisting only in that of a statement which conceals 
an hiatus that cannot be filled up by human intelligence.
I may perhaps most fitly bring my remarks to a conclusion by 
quoting a sentence from the Introduction to a book which has 
attracted a great deal of notice— "The Unseen Universe ;"— the 
opinion expressed in which appears to me worthy of the most 
attentive consideration : " We are entire believers," say the writers 
of this book, " in the infinite depth of Nature, and hold that just as 
we must imagine space and duration to be infinite, so must we 
imagine the structural complexity of the universe to be infinite 
also."

THE INFLUENCE OF GEOLOGICAL STRUCTURE 
ON SCENERY.
By J.
D. KENDALL, C.E., F.G.S.
(Read at Whitehaven, Carlisle, Maryport, and Workington.) 
The love of Scenery appears to us nowadays to be so natural— so 
much a part of our eesthetic constitution — that we are apt without 
further thought to look upon it as 
" An ingredient in the compound man, 
Infused at the creation of the kind." 
Upon inquiry, however, we find that this is not the case, but, 
on the contrary, it turns out that — like many other of man's 
characteristics which, for some reason or other, he would like to 
persuade himself have not been recently acquired — his love of 
scenery is but of comparatively modern growth.
It will scarcely 
be disputed, I should think, that wherever or at whatever time 
there has existed a love of scenery, some record of it will be found 
in the works of either the poets or painters — or perhaps of both — 
who lived at that particular time and place.
But the history of 
painting is almost silent on the subject of landscapes until within 
the last hundred or hundred and fifty years : and after having seen 
some of the older productions of the easel, we are not surprised 
that it should be so.
The Louvre in Paris probably contains some 
of the finest specimens of the Old Masters that are to be found 
anywhere, yet in that splendid collection, there is almost an entire 
absence of landscapes; you go wandering on from corridor to 
7 
98 
corridor, and through one room after another, all filled with " Old 
Masters," and yet you scarcely ever meet a landscape.
This want 
is also observable in our National Gallery, if we leave out the 
works that are really modern.
So too in Poetry the same neglect 
of Nature, outside humanity, is equally apparent, until we draw 
near our own times, when we are presented with a galaxy of names 
whose landscapes of the pen are as numerous and beautiful as are 
those of the modern pencil.
This absence of landscapes in the works of the older poets 
and painters, I take it, is an indication that the love of scenery has 
been but recently developed.
Of course it may be that there is some 
charm in Nature now that has not ever been — some beauty in the 
woods, the fields, and mountains that was not long ago ; but I 
think a careful study of all the evidence will show, that there is 
rather a fresh faculty in man — a newly acquired chord of exquisite 
fineness, which vibrates in unison with a note in Nature's varied 
strain that aforetime passed unheeded.
In no one perhaps has this faculty been more highly developed 
than in Wordsworth, for it seems, indeed, in studying his works you 
cannot avoid the conclusion, that his whole life was influenced by 
it.
In his beautiful poem written " On Revisiting the Banks of 
the Wye," we learn something of the power of this new develop- 
ment in the words : — 
"How oft — 
In darkness and amid the many shapes 
Of joyless daylight ; when the fretful stir 
Unprofitable, and the fever of the world, 
Have hung upon the beatings of my heart — 
How oft, in spirit, have I turned to thee, 
O sylvan Wye !
thou wanderer through the woods.
How often has my spirit turned to thee !
And now, with gleams of half-extinguished thought, 
With many recognitions dim and faint, 
And somewhat of a sad perplexity, 
The picture of the mind revives again : 
While here I stand not only with the sense 
Of present pleasure, but with pleasing thoughts 
That in this moment there is life and food 
For future years, " 
99 
I cannot tell how it may appear to others, but to me it seems 
that the inducement to record the thoughts and feelings of a mind 
and heart thus influenced, is so strong as to be almost irresistible, 
so that I think we do not err in concluding that where such a 
record is absent, the feeling that would prompt its production 
must have been absent too.
The temptation to pursue this theme is great, but we must 
refrain.
Dallying by the way in search of objects that we set not 
out to find, will perhaps only rob us in this case, as it often does 
in others, of time that might be more beneficially employed.
Let 
us therefore keep to the path direct.
Scenery may be viewed from two very different standpoints — 
the aesthetic, and the scientific.
From the former we see and are 
pleased, but know not why, and care not wherefore.
From the 
latter we must know why, or we cannot be pleased at all.
From 
the aesthetic point of view we may experience the fullest enjoyment 
without knowing anything of the order of effects by which the 
scene resulted, for there is in it then something that — 
" Hath no need of a remoter charm by thought supplied, 
Nor any interest unborrowed from the eye.
" 
From the scientific standpoint we can only be satisfied by a know- 
ledge of the cause, be it remote or mediate, which has led to such 
an elaborate effect.
It is from the latter point of view that I invite you for a short 
time to look at scenery now.
Premising that there are some 
among you who have not taken up that position before, it may be 
necessary, in order that you may fully appreciate the prospect, to 
make a few preliminary observations.
This, with your permission, 
I will now proceed to do.
The exterior portion of the earth's crust, with which alone we 
are acquainted, is known by common observation to be composed 
of different kinds of rocks.
These we find on examination may 
be separated into two classes — aqueous and igneous — the former 
having originated in water, the latter by fire.
Among the water- 
formed rocks are our limestones, sandstones, and slates, which 
100 
together occupy by far the larger portion of the earth's crust ; the 
igneous rocks, such as we see about Borrowdale, are less extensive, 
being confined to those areas which either are or have been the 
scene of volcanic activity.
When rocks are cut into — especially 
those that have had an aqueous origin — we find that they occur in 
layers, or strata.
These layers are sometimes piled one above 
another to a very great height, or underlie one another to a great 
depth.
We also find that the layers vary very considerably in 
their thickness, as well as in the mode of their aggregation.
For 
instance, there is a very great difference in the thickness of the 
layers composing St. Bees Head, some being only a few inches 
thick, whilst others are several feet.
In the slaty rocks of Skiddaw 
the layers also vary, but not so much as the sandy rocks of 
St, Bees Head, and they are much thinner as a rule at Skiddaw.
Again at Distington or Overend, we find similar variations in the 
thickness of the different beds of limestone.
Sometimes we find 
layers of different sorts of rock alternating, as in the cliffs between 
Whitehaven and Harrington, which consist of layers of sandstone 
interstratified with shale, and an occasional seam of coal.
At other 
places like St. Bees Head, we see a great number of superimposed 
layers of the same sort of rock : there it is red sandstone.
Then 
again at Distington quarry there are a great many layers of another 
sort of rock — Umestone ; whilst Skiddaw and Dent are made up 
almost entirely of slate.
These rocky layers, sometimes, are nearly 
level ; at others they are slightly, or perhaps highly, inclined ; and 
not unfrequently, especially in hilly countries, they may be seen 
standing on end.
Sometimes they are bent, at others contorted, 
as if they had been subjected to a pressure endwise ; or again we 
find them broken completely across — or faulted, as it is called — 
and the layers on one side of the fault lifted away above the other.
Most rocks, too, are greatly intersected by joints.
Besides the set 
of horizontal or inclined joints separating the different beds or 
strata, there are two other sets, nearly at right angles to those and 
to each other, by which the rock is split into rhombohedrons 
varying in size and proportion with the proximity of the joints.
In some formations, such as the Skiddaw Slate, these joints are 
101 
so numerous that the rock is divided into fragments frequently less 
than one's hand.
In Hmestone rock Hke that at Distington, and 
also in the red sandstone of St. Bees, the joints are not so 
numerous, consequently the pieces into which the rock is divided 
are larger.
Quarrymen speak of those joints which are nearly at 
right angles to the bed-joints — at least when they occur in the 
limestone and sandstone as "backs," and they greatly prize them, 
for it is not too much to say that their work of rock-getting is 
reduced to one-half or one-fourth, or even in certain cases to 
one-eighth of what it would be were these natural joints absent.
Another feature of rocks which must, at some time or other, have 
been noticed by everyone who has any power of observation, is 
their different degrees of hardness : some being soft and incoherent, 
whilst others are extremely hard and compact.
But, it may be 
asked, what has all this to do with scenery ?
To the aesthetic, I 
readily admit that it is nothing, but to the scientist it means 
much.
Before geologists had begun to study the curious characters 
that are written on the rocks, it was supposed — and indeed by 
many it is still thought — that the hills and valleys, continents and 
seas, by which the surface of our earth is beautified, were coeval 
with the globe itself; that they were so fashioned, formed, and 
fixed in that eventful week when out of chaos and of death it is 
said there sprang order, Ufe, and beauty.
Now, however, to the 
geologist at least, they have a different history.
Their present 
form he looks upon but as the latest of a long series of forms 
which they have successively assumed in the grand process of 
evolution which the earth during untold ages has undergone, and 
is still undergoing.
The present form of the earth's surface, so far 
from being what it has always been, or what it will be in the future, 
may, says the geologist, rather be compared to one of those 
transitory forms presented by a statue as, stroke by stroke, the 
sculptor gradually evolves from a rude and formless mass of stone 
the "embodiment of his poetic thought." 
The tools by which Nature works are, however, different from 
those employed by Art. The hammers and chisels of earth 
102 
sculpture are waves and streams, frost and rain, and chemical 
decomposition.
Every shower that falls exerts a wasting and 
weathering influence on rocks, soils, and all exposed surfaces, 
" There is no rock so hard but a little wave may beat admission in 
a thousand years ;" and so it is that every wave that beats along 
the troubled ocean's shore, every ripple on the margin of the quiet 
mountain lake, every brook and stream and river as it leaps and 
rolls and sweeps along, slowly but surely alters or destroys the 
seemingly imperishable framework of our globe.
Its contour is 
also considerably modified by the action of frost.
Water passing 
through the numerous joints and fissures that exist in rocks of 
almost every kind at certain seasons of the year, becoming frozen, 
expands.
It has then a tendency to rend and force apart the 
integral masses of the much-divided rocks, the consequence of 
which is, that when the thaw comes, these masses, having lost their 
cohesion, fall asunder, in many places producing those immense 
heaps of angular fragments at the foot of escarpments which, in 
our Lake District, go by the name of "screes." Then again, water 
as it passes through the rocks, either by the joints or by the 
interstices of the component parts of the rock, dissolves and carries 
away portions of the lime, soda, potash, and magnesia that enter 
into their composition, thus promoting their disintegration.
They 
crumble away, and are then in a condition to be borne to lower 
levels by either rain or rivers, or both — ultimately to be dropped 
by them into the sea.
The mud and other sediments which are 
borne down by, and which discolour our rivers and streams both 
during and for some time after a storm, may be mentioned as 
evidence of this particular kind of degrading action.
At first sight 
we are not much impressed with its importance, but upon closer 
examination, we find that the mud which is annually borne down 
to the sea by rivers is something enormous.
It has been shewn, 
for instance, that the united Ganges and Brahmapootra carry down 
to the bay of Bengal 40,000,000,000 cubic feet of solid matter 
every year.
A better idea may be formed of that enormous 
quantity, when it is stated that at such a rate of deposition Enner- 
dale lake would be filled with sediment in a month.
103 
Another agent of destruction is the atmosphere.
Composed 
of oxygen, nitrogen, and carbonic acid, its action is principally 
chemical, and is observable more or less on all exposed surfaces.
Its gases, partly by themselves, and partly in conjunction with the 
moisture in which they are diffused, exert a wasting and weathering 
influence on rocks of every description — softening, loosening, and 
crumbling them down to be more readily borne away by currents 
of wind and water.
Carbonic acid acts specially on all rocks 
containing lime.
Oxygens rust or oxydises those impregnated with 
iron.
Moisture insinuates itself everywhere, and thus in after 
years the hardest rock exhibits a wasted and weathered surface.
Particle after particle is loosened, film after film falls away, a new 
surface is exposed to new waste, and in the course of ages the 
boldest mountain mass yields to this silent imperceptible agency.
The operations of these various denuding agents are divided 
by geologists into two classes — chemical and mechanical ; the 
former including the chemical action of the atmosphere and water, 
the latter, those agents which act either by abrasion or some other 
mechanical means — this class includes rain and rivers, waves of 
water and frost.
Knowing now that these apparently powerless agents are 
capable of modifying the form of the earth's surface, we have only 
to keep clearly before us the manner in which they act, to be 
convinced, once for all, that, other things being equal, their effect 
will be greatest on those parts of the earth's crust which are 
softest, in the same way that a sculptor or a quarryman can work 
more rapidly in a soft stone than in one that is hard.
And further, as 
the work of a quarryman is greatly facilitated by the presence of joints, 
so is the action of these denuding agents.
The more a rock is 
split up by joints, the greater is the destructive effect on it of both 
water and the atmosphere — chemically as well as mechanically — 
because the more readily do they gain access to its interior.
Keeping these facts constantly before us, we shall, I think, 
be able now to appreciate fully the subject we have to consider, 
that is, the Influence of Geological Structure on Scenery.
Let us 
commence with our sea-coasts.
104 
From what has just been said, it must, I think, be clear to all 
that if the sea everywhere met with the same resistance, that is to 
say, if the rocks along our coast were everywhere of the same 
structure and hardness, and always presented themselves to the 
denuding action of the waves in the same manner, we should have 
none of those beautiful bays and coves and headlands which give 
such pleasing variety to our coast scenery now, but everywhere we 
should meet with the same monotonous prospect.
Fortunately, 
however, it is not so, for the rocks vary both in hardness and in 
the manner of their occurrence, so that the denuding action of the 
sea has greater effect upon them at one point than at another, and, 
as a consequence, carves them out into bays and headlands of 
infinite form and variety in the way that we now see them.
On many parts of our coasts, especially about Cornwall and 
Devon, the connection between geological structure and scenery 
is displayed most strikingly, and could hardly fail to arrest the 
attention of the most superficial observer.
But we may, I think, 
learn something of that connection by an examination of the coast 
nearer home.
Those who have been along that part of it which 
lies between Parton and St. Bees, will remember that it is very 
irregular.
First of all there is, at Parton, a small bay-like indent- 
ation at the mouth of the valley in which the village lies.
Then 
the coast stands somewhat out towards the sea until we reach 
Redness Point, whence it recedes to Whitehaven, and forms at the 
end of St. Bees valley another small bay.
Jutting out seaward 
again somewhat abruptly on the south side of this bay, it thence 
pursues a nearly straight line to Port Hamilton.
At that point it 
turns seaward once more, and we are on the fine headland known 
as St. Bees Head, broken only near its centre by a slight indent- 
ation called Fleswick Bay. Opposite St. Bees the coast retires 
again, and forms another small bay, there too at the mouth of a 
valley.
Now, what is the cause of this irregularity of the coast 
line?
That it adds much to its beauty no one will deny; but why 
should it not have been a straight line?
Why all the projections 
and indentations that exist 1 To answer these questions we must 
first make ourselves acquainted with the nature of the rocks 
105 
forming the coast.
Now, an examination with that object in view, 
shews us that between Parton and Port Hamilton, the cliffs consist 
chiefly of alternations of sandstones and soft shales belonging to 
the Coal Measures.
From Port Hamilton to St. Bees — that is, 
around St. Bees Head — they are made up of red sandstone, whilst 
opposite St. Bees they are composed of drift — an incoherent mass 
of sand and gravel — which at that point overlies the red sandstone.
Now this drift and the soft shale, which make up a considerable 
part of the cliffs between Parton and Port Hamilton, are very 
much more easily denuded by the sea than the compact sandstone 
of St. Bees Head, and consequently they have been worn farther 
back than it.
But it may be said, if that is the correct explanation 
of the prominence of St. Bees Head, how is it, seeing that the 
whole of that head is formed of red sandstone, that there occurs 
a little bay — called Fleswick — about midway across it?
Is the red 
sandstone at Fleswick softer than the red sandstone on each side 
of that place, forming the remainder of the head 1 Or why is it 
that the sea has been able to push back the cliffs further at Fleswick 
than on each side of it?
An examination of the ground shews us 
that there the cliffs are lower than on each side, in consequence 
of a small valley which at that point comes down to the sea.
That 
is why the bay has been formed ; for although the sandstone 
around the bay and that on each side of it may be of equal hard- 
ness, and consequently present the same resistance to the waves, 
yet it must be quite clear to everyone, at a moment's reflection, 
that before the waves can eat away the cliffs to any given distance 
inland, they must remove more material where the cliffs are high 
than where they are low.
Consequently if the sea removes the 
same amount of matter from every point upon which it impinges, 
as presumably it must do, if the rock is everywhere of equal 
hardness, then it will make the greatest progress inland at those 
points where the cliffs are lowest.
That is exactly, what it has 
done at Fleswick.
The cliffs there being lower than they are on 
each side, the sea, in doing the same amount of work at every 
point it broke against, has of necessity, for the reasons just stated, 
formed a bay.
The same explanation may be extended to the 
106 
bays at Parton and Whitehaven, the existence of which at those 
particular points is mainly due to a locally diminished height of 
the cliffs arising from the intersection of the coast line there by 
two valleys.
In a similar way we might explain every indentation 
or promontory that is to be found along our coasts ; so that we 
see what an intimate relation there is between the denuding action 
of the sea and the irregularities of its coast outline.
We further 
see how this denuding action is influenced by geological structure, 
and consequently, how on that geological structure depends our 
sea coast scenery for its variety.
Let us next see if we can trace the same sort of connection 
between geological structure and our inland scenery.
For this 
purpose we might almost take the country indiscriminately, but 
perhaps our subject will be as well illustrated about Keswick as 
anywhere.
Few people who have visited that locality will have 
left it, I should think, without first ascending Casde Head — that 
little rounded woody eminence, rising abruptly, just outside the 
town on the left of the road leading to Borrowdale.
The view 
obtainable from the top of that hill is perhaps as fine and varied 
as any that can be found in the district.
Looking southward — 
that is, towards Borrowdale — we see, a little way below us, a 
straggling plot of intermingled wood and field, beyond which lies 
the bright and smiling lake, set as it were at the foot of a grand 
amphitheatre of hills, which as, in seeming eagerness to see the 
lake, they rise higher and higher in the distance, at length com- 
pletely shut out the prospect beyond.
At the nearer end of the 
lake there is a broad, fiat or but gently undulating, stretch of 
meadow land, which, as Ave turn to the north west, is seen 
extending away betwixt lines of hills to Bassenthwaite.
On the 
north of us lies the little quaint old town ; and beyond, limiting 
the view in that direction, rise the majestic forms of Skiddaw and 
Blencathra, their furrowed sides, like lines of age, forcibly reminding 
us of their lifelong struggle with the elements.
Hours might be 
spent in describing the glorious panorama around this point, and 
even then but a faint impression would be conveyed of its sur- 
passing loveliness ; for 
107 
" Such beauty varying in the light 
Of hving Nature cannot be portrayed 
By words, nor by the pencil's silent skill, 
But is the property of hifti alone 
Who hath beheld it, noted it with care, 
And in his mind recorded it with love." 
Located on our standpoint of Castle Head, a careful observer 
will speedily discover how different in outline some of the hills 
seen by him are from others.
He will see one group of which the 
surface is comparatively even and unbroken, and another that is 
rough and rugged in the extreme.
Looking towards Borrowdale, 
for instance, he will quickly perceive that the hills on the left of 
the lake, and those at the farther end are infinitely more wild and 
irregular than those on the right, which, in fact, have a somewhat 
tame and even outline.
On the north too, he will see that the 
same comparatively smooth and unbroken appearance is presented 
by the forms of Skiddaw and Blencathra, notwithstanding their 
deeply furrowed sides.
Now what is the cause of this difference 
of appearance ?
Why should one set of hills have a rough and 
hummocky exterior, and the other be regular and comparatively 
smooth ?
Like the form of the sea-coast line, it is explained by a 
knowledge of their geological structure.
On examination we find 
that the more even-looking hills are formed out of a rock which is 
known as Skiddaw Slate — so called from the fact of its largely forming 
the mountain of Skiddaw.
It is a formation which consists mainly of 
beds of mudstone of nearly uniform hardness; so that it offers to 
the agents of denudation the same — or nearly the same — resistance 
at every part of it.
Hence the regular outline of the hills in which 
it occurs.
But the hills of rugged outline are built up of volcanic 
lavas and ashes, rocks of very different degrees of hardness, and 
therefore yielding variously to the denuding action of the elements.
Whence their jagged and hummocky appearance.
In this way we might go on explaining nearly every feature 
of the rocks we see.
Should we ask ourselves, for instance, why 
Castle Head, the hill on which we stand, rises so abruptly from the 
ground around it, the answer is at once apparent when we discover 
that the hill consists of a hard volcanic rock called Diabase, whilst 
108 
the low ground surrounding it is formed of soft Skiddaw Slate.
Or again, if in walking from Rosthwaite towards Keswick, we 
enquire why the valley along which we walk widens out so suddenly 
at the village ol Grange, and we are told that we are then just 
leaving the volcanic lavas and ashes, and coming upon the softer 
Skiddaw Slates; the reason for the sudden change in the width ot 
the valley at once flashes upon us, and we are satisfied.
Or generally, suppose we ask ourselves why some valleys are 
deep and narrow, whilst others are broad and shallow, what 
answer can we give ?
The reply involves a knowledge of the 
process of valley formation.
Suppose we have a stream that has 
just commenced to cut its way through a newly formed tract of 
country, as for instance a piece of flattish country that has just 
been raised out of the sea ; — as soon as ever that stream has 
formed tor itself a channel, the sides of that channel will be 
attacked by the various chemical and meteoric denuding agents.
Frost, if it be in winter, will loosen and crumble large quantities 
of rock on each side of it.
Water charged with carbonic acid will 
dissolve and carry much away, especially if the rock be either 
chalk or limestone ; and the pieces loosened and crumbled by 
frost will be washed by rain into the stream, and thereby carried 
away to be deposited elsewhere.
The effect of these united actions 
will be that the channel will soon become wider at the top than at 
the bottom ; for the top having been longer exposed to the 
denuding agents, must necessarily have suffered more from them.
In course of time, as the stream deepens its bed, either by erosion 
or by dissolving the material of which it is composed, fresh ex- 
posures of rock will take place along the bottom of each bank, 
which will at once be attacked and wasted by the impatient 
destructives.
So also will every additional exposure that is made 
by deepening the stream bed, no matter how long that may be 
continued.
The result of these actions ultimately will be a valley.
As the stream worked itself deeper into the rock, the sides or 
banks would be worn gradually further and further back by frost 
and rain and chemical decomposition.
The upper part of each 
bank having been longer acted upon by these influences than the 
109 
lower part, must have suffered more from them ; so that the sides 
at any given height are farther apart than they are lower down 
nearer the stream, where they have not been acted upon so long.
The exact section of the valley will however depend upon the 
geological structure of the country through which it is formed, and 
the inclination of the river traversing it.
If the rocks are hard, 
the width and depth of the valley will not be so great as if the 
rocks were soft ; and other things being equal, its depth will be 
greater if the bed of the stream be steep than if it were nearly 
level.
Generally we find that narrow valleys are steep, their steep- 
ness — and consequently the velocity of the streams flowing through 
them — being inversely proportional to their breadth ; that is to 
say — the steeper they are, the narrower they are comparatively, 
other things of course being equal.
The explanation of this is 
very simple.
The erosive power of a stream is proportional to its 
velocity ; if this increases above a certain point, the action of the 
stream on its bed will be greater than that of the atmosphere and 
other kindred forces on its banks, the consequence of which will 
be that the valley will be enlarged at a greater rate downwards 
than sidewise, so that it will eventually become deep and com- 
paratively narrow.
On the other hand, if the inclination of the 
stream be very slight, its denuding action downwards will be less 
than that of the forces acting on the sides, so that the width of 
the valley will increase more rapidly than its depth.
As a conse- 
quence of this, the valley will become, in the long run, broad but 
comparatively shallow.
To some, probably, there may seem to be a great want 
of efficiency in these subaerial forces to effect a work so enor- 
mous as that with which they are credited, but is it so?
No 
doubt so long as we were content to accept unquestioned Arch- 
bishop Usher's figure of 6000 years as the age of the world, there 
might be a difficulty in reconciling such an enormous effect with a 
cause apparently so inadequate.
But now that geologists — by 
thinking for themselves, and by earnest study of the Book of Fact 
— have learned that it is millions of years since our earth began 
its circling flight through "the lucid interspace of world on world" 
no 
— the difficulty has disappeared, and the efficiency of those 
subaerial agents of which we have been speaking is now confidently 
asserted.
Let us go into figures for a moment.
Suppose we 
assume that material of the depth of one-tenth of an inch is 
removed from each side of a valley every year, at the end of ten 
thousand years that valley would be one hundred and sixty-six feet 
wider than it is now, and in a hundred thousand years it would be 
1660 feet wider.
Now one tenth of an inch is not a great quantity 
to be removed in a year, and one hundred thousand years is not a 
great length of time when you have millions to take at ; yet even 
with those figures we see that a valley would be produced greater 
by far than the majority of our present valleys, so that I think 
there can be little doubt about the competency of the agents of 
which we have been speaking to do the work ascribed to them.
In the country about Ennerdale there exists a similar connec- 
tion between geological structure and scenery to that which has 
been seen to prevail at Keswick and along our sea-coast.
The 
tame and even outline of the range of Dent and Kinniside Cop 
contrasts strongly with the torn and rugged features of the Pillar 
and its neighbours ; and so upon examination we find that there is 
great difference in their geological structure.
Dent and Kinniside 
being formed of Skiddaw Slate, while the pillar is composed of 
volcanic lavas and ashes.
The Pillar Stone standing conspicuously 
out from the flanks of the Pillar mountain is another apt illustra- 
tion of our subject.
Close inspection shews that that very remark- 
able feature of the Ennerdale valley consists of a rock which is 
much harder than that immediately surrounding it.
Whence its 
curious and remarkable prominence.
In travelling by rail from Whitehaven to Furness, we obtain 
a splendid view of the western hills of the Lake Country.
We see 
their varied outline, and how in every case it alters where there is 
alteration in their rocky structure ; the distant changing profile 
being in fact a sure index of the petrological changes that are met 
with on a nearer acquaintance.
And so, wherever we go, there is 
the same association of external form and internal substance, the 
one changing as the other changes, being together knit by the 
Ill 
inseparable bond of cause and effect.
Not more certainly does 
the oscillating mercury speak to us of meteoric changes, than the 
petrological variations of a district or a country are indicated by 
the varying character of its profile.
I remember on one occasion 
when standing on the north coast of Ireland, near the Giant's 
Causeway, and looking out seaward, being greatly struck with the out- 
line of the Island of Rathlin, one part of which is quite low and very 
even in form, the other being much higher and somewhat irregular in 
in outhne.
It occurred to me that there must be some difference in 
the rocks of the two parts of the island to cause this difference in 
the outline ; and upon enquiry, I found that the low and even- 
looking portion was composed of chalk, which is comparatively 
soft and easily denuded, whilst the higher and more irregular 
portion proved to be formed of basalt, a rock which is much 
harder than chalk, and not by any means so easily acted on by 
the atmosphere and other denuding agents; whence its more 
prominent appearance.
In this way we might go on from one part of the country to 
another almost ad ififiniium, adducing examples in illustration of 
the great influence of geological structure on scenery.
So far we 
have principally concerned ourselves with changes in lithological 
composition, which is but a part — although a very important part 
— of what is embraced in the phrase, geological structure.
I would 
like now, before concluding, briefly to notice how scenery may 
be, and in fact, is influenced in other ways, as, for instance, by 
the dip of the strata, by joints, and by faults.
In walking across country from Ennerdale to Whitehaven, it 
may have been noticed by some of you that those valleys, or those 
parts of valleys, which have a north and south direction, are as a 
rule, steeper on the west side than on the east.
The explanation 
of this is as follows.
The general dip of the rocks in that part of 
the district is to the west, so that the valleys or parts of valleys 
having a north and south direction are at right angles, or nearly 
so, to the dip.
Now every quarrymen knows, and it is apparent 
to almost everybody, that it is much easier to work towards the 
rise of the strata than to the dip, because in working up-hill, so to 
112 
speak, the pieces of rock, as soon as they are loosened by blasting, 
fall towards you ; but in working down-hill, that is with the beds 
of rock dipping from you, a great amount of levering is frequently 
required to throw the stones down, after they have actually been 
separated from the parent rock by gunpowder.
So in the oper- 
ations of denudation — which is a species of quarrying by inanimate 
agents — the rock on the east side of a north and south valley being 
to the rise, is more easily denuded than that on the west side, 
which is to the dip.
Hence the east side of such a valley is, in 
any given time, worn further back, and consequently is flatter than 
the west side.
The influence of dip on the outline of a district 
may be very clearly seen in looking at the mountain of Grassmoor 
from about the centre of Crummock Lake.
The rocks there dip 
eastward, and the slope of the east side of the mountain corresponds 
with the dip, and is comparatively regular; but the west side, 
where the ends of the strata crop out, has quite a jagged appear- 
ance.
The same connection between dip and profile may be seen 
at Pardshaw Crag.
Some of you in your visits to Eskdale, I have no doubt, will 
have noticed the hummocky nature of the granite which abounds 
there.
From what has gone before, it might have been expected 
that the hills formed of this rock would have approached somewhat 
in outline those consisting of Skiddaw Slate, or any other homo- 
geneous rock ; but it is not so, and the reason for the difference is 
found on examination.
Through the gaps between the hummocks 
we are almost sure, on inspection, to find traces of a mineral vein, 
or of a strong joint, it may be a fault ; but from the homogeneous 
nature of the rock, this cannot be determined.
Now it is well 
known that the rock adjacent to a mineral vein is often much 
softer than that further away.
This is also frequently the case 
with the rock near a large joint.
Especially is it so in the Esk- 
dale Granite, the rock near both mineral veins and joints being 
much softer than that farther off; and that is why the hills at those 
points where either mineral veins or strong joints exist, have been 
farther denuded than at more distant points ; and it is the reason 
too for the hills formed of Eskdale Granite having such a hum- 
i 
113 
mocky and irregular outline.
The mineral veins traversing the 
Skiddaw Slate do not affect the adjacent rock so much, so that 
their existence has less effect on the contour of the country through 
which they pass.
Whenever the hills formed of these rocks have 
an irregular outline, it is due to the presence of harder beds.
I must now bring my remarks to a close ; and in doing so, let 
me briefly recapitulate the results at which we have arrived.
In 
the first place we have seen that the exterior portion of the 
earth's crust is made up of rocks of several different kinds, 
varying in hardness in the manner of their occurrence, and in 
numerous other particulars.
We have further seen that these rocks 
are acted upon and denuded, both chemically and mechanically, 
by such agents as water, either at rest or in motion, by frost, and 
by the atmosphere.
Lastly, we have seen that to these agents, 
acting on the rocks with variable intensity, is due all that beautiful 
carving into hill and dale which we so much admire.
By many, 
no doubt, it will be regarded as unquestionable that all our much 
prized scenery — the rough and rugged hills in the north, and the 
low-lying gentle undulations of the south — was specially intended 
to delight the eye and mind of man; but to the geologist it will, 
I think, appear rather as an incidental existence, which has arisen 
in the grand process of destruction and reproduction, which is and 
has been for millions of years going on in the rocky structure of 
our globe.
Here, as often elsewhere in the universe, beauty for 
its own sake does not exist ; still none the less need we prize it.
Do we think less of the lovely flowers because we know that their 
bright and charming colors are primarily displayed as allurements 
to the insect tribe, for the selfish purpose of securing their own 
existence?
Or does the floor of heaven, "thick inlaid with 
patines of bright gold," impress us less now that we know some- 
thing of its real nature than it did before astronomy had so rudely 
upset our old ideas ?
No !
And no less succesfully will beautiful 
scenery appeal to the aesthetic part of our nature, because we know 
that such scenery is only an incidental of rock denudation.

SOME ACCOUNT OF THE LIFE 
OF THE LATE CAPTAIN HUDDART, F.R.S., 
By E, T.
TYSON.
(Read at Maryport, October, 1879 J 
The subject of this memoir — though of great eminence in his day 
— appears to be little known to the present generation.
A native 
of Cumberland, born at yonder little fishing village — AUonby — 
and connected very intimately with our own more pretentious 
sea-side town — especially during the earlier period of his notable 
and distinguished career — it occurred to me that some account of 
him might prove not altogether uninteresting or uninstructive.
The prominent features of his character, as disclosed by the 
narrative of his life, are, to my mind, great steadfastness of purpose, 
and industry.
These excellent qualities, combined with the great 
mental endowments he possessed, and had the wisdom to cultivate 
and to apply to practical purposes, enabled him to rise from 
comparatively humble, though respectable surroundings, to a 
position of considerable social influence, and to acquire in the 
world of Science an undoubtedly high reputation as a hydrographer, 
navigator, and engineer.
It is somewhat singular that in our own 
county so little should be known about him, and that — save a 
short notice of his life which appeared in the Gentleman!
s Magazine 
and other periodicals of former days, and a memoir compiled in 
the year 182 1 by his then only surviving son, and which appears 
to have been chiefly, if not exclusively, designed for private 
116 
circulation — his biography, in a complete form, should still be 
unwritten.
A Cumberland worthy, however, he unquestionably was, 
and, as such, Cumberland ought to feel proud of him.
The 
connection with our county of a Wordsworth, a Fearon Fallows, 
and a Huddart, ought, in its degree, to be quite as much 
matter of local concern and pride as a Shakespeare, a Burns, 
or a Moore is of national pride and concern.
My object, 
therefore, to-night, is to endeavour in some measure to put 
before you, as concisely as I can, some of the chief inci- 
dents in the life of this remarkable Cumbrian.
I do this, not 
simply by any means because he happened to be a Cumbrian, 
but because the example of his meritorious, useful, and unosten.
tatious life appears to me well worthy of our consideration, and 
especially calculated to encourage my younger auditors who may 
yet have to embark upon life's eventful voyage.
Joseph Huddart was born at Allonby, on the nth January, 
1 741.
He was an only child.
His father appears to have been 
engaged, along with a few friends, in the fishery of herrings, which, 
in former years, and more particularly about the period referred 
to, were very abundant in the Solway.
From a boy, young 
Huddart showed unmistakeable signs of genius.
When a water 
flour-mill, was being built at Allonby, it is said that Huddart 
was observed by the workmen to be frequently prying about 
and closely observing what was going on.
They probably little 
imagined that he was constructing at home, in miniature, 
similar machinery to that which they were setting up.
On 
the completion of the mill itself he produced his own little 
toy-mill, which is reported to have been a tolerably accurate 
imitation of the original, and to have been set going with it.
It was not, however, towards practical mechanics that 
Huddart's mind and tastes exclusively leant.
Under the teaching 
* The writer's attention was not called to Dr. Lonsdale's short biography 
of Captain Huddart until after the delivery of the paper.
When the paper was 
in course of preparation, he was led to understand by a literary friend that Dr.
Lonsdale had w(7^ included Captain Huddart in his IVortkies.
117 
of the Rev. Mr.
Wilson, the incumbent of Allonby, who had 
acquired at Glasgow College a knowledge of both medicine and 
astronomy, he made some progress in the latter science, for which 
he had naturally a decided predilection.
As a boy, however, he 
was more especially remarkable for his constructive skill.
It is 
said of him, that having read Mungo Murray's " Treatise on Ship- 
building and Navigation," published in 1754, he commenced, and 
with great perseverance successfully completed, according to the 
rules laid down in the work, an exact model of a 74-gun ship.
As young Huddart grew up he assisted his father in the 
fishery.
This he did until the latter's death, in 1762, when he 
succeeded to his father's share in the business.
The same year 
he married a Miss Johnston, whose father was a yeoman, living at 
Coupar, in the Abbey Holme.
She died at Allonby, 12th 
February, 1786.
There was issue of the marriage, five sons; two 
of these died in infancy.
Of the remaining three the eldest and 
the youngest, called respectively William and Johnston, predeceased 
their father.
William, who was a captain in the sea service of the 
Honourable East India Company, died 30th March, 1787, and 
was buried at Macao, in China.
Johnston, 3rd officer of the 
Princess Amelia, in the same Service, died on the 29th January, 
1795, ^"d was buried at Leghorn.
Of the only surviving son more 
particular mention will be made hereafter.
In 1768 Mr. Huddart built a brig, at Maryport, having some 
time previously given up the fishery.
This vessel appeal's to have 
been built by Mr. John Wood, who, along with his son William, 
was at that time a shipbuilder of repute.
To this day the same 
shipyard is in existence, the business being conducted by Mr.
Wilton W.
Wood, the great-grandson of Mr. John Wood.
With 
this vessel Mr. Huddart traded to and from North America on his 
own account, and also to and from Maryport and the Irish Coast.
It was in 1773 that through the urgent solicitations and advice 
of Sir Richard Hotham, Mr. Huddart was induced to enter the sea 
service of the Honourable East India Company.
More than two 
years before he had been introduced to Sir Richard by an uncle, 
then living in London, and whose eldest daughter had married Sir 
118 
Richard.
Sir Richard, it appears, was an influential shipowner.
He husbanded, at the time we speak of, two ships in the Company's 
service.
Struck with Mr. Huddart's practical acquaintance with 
shipbuilding — (how true it is that the boy makes the man) — and 
with his sound knowledge of maritime matters generally, he felt 
that Mr. Huddart's proper sphere was in a much more enlarged 
field of duty.
Sir Richard accordingly pressed him to enter the 
Company's service.
After much deliberation, Mr. Huddart con- 
sented to try one voyage.
He accordingly sailed as 4th officer in 
the York from the Downs, on Christmas Eve, 1773, bound to 
St. Helena and Bencoolen.
In the course of this voyage he made 
many useful surveys, particularly on the west coast of Sumatra, and 
returned to England in October, 1775.
With a heavy heart and a 
light purse, he went back to his native village.
The voyage, though 
a profitable one to the owners, had, unhappily, proved a disastrous 
one to the officers who traded on their own account.
He therefore 
resumed command of his little brig which he had been so slow to 
part from, and ran her in the coal trade from Maryport to Ireland 
and back, until the following October, when he proceeded to 
London from Cork with a cargo of ship's provisions to the order 
of Sir Richard Hotham.
In 1777 we find Mr. Huddart engaged upon his famous survey 
of the St. George's Channel.
It was a work of great magnitude 
and importance, and beset with corresponding difficulties.
He had 
no solid foundation, so to speak, on which to build, there being at 
that time no accurate chart of the Channel.
The survey, however, 
after much patient industry and unflagging perseverance, was I 
successfully completed.
The work, which was originally dated on 
board the Royal Admiral, hereinafter mentioned, 31st March, 1778, 
fully established, when published, Mr. Huddart's reputation as aj 
hydrographer, and "Huddart's Chart" was the talk of every seaman.
For years it was the only trustworthy chart of that Channel, and II 
am much mistaken if the Government charts of more recent days] 
have not been based upon it.
After this notable achievement, which resulted in so much I 
good to the country, Mr. Huddart shortly afterwards joined the 
119 
Royal Admiral, which Sir Richard Hotham, by leave of the Court 
of Directors, had just built.
He sailed out with that vessel on the 
27th April, 1778, for Bombay, as chief officer.
She put into 
Portsmouth on the outward voyage, where the captain died, and 
Mr. Huddart was appointed to the command.
Altogether, Captain Huddart was fifteen years in the Com- 
pany's service, ten of which he served as commander in the 
Royal Admiral.
During this period he devoted much of his leisure 
to hydrographical and astronomical pursuits.
Here again we see 
the early tastes of the boy matured in the man.
" By the eclipse of Jupiter's Satellites he is said to have ascertained (amongst 
other astronomical observations which he made) the longitude of Bombay with 
greater precision than had been done by any former geographer.
Together 
with other surveys, he completed one of the whole peninsula from Bombay to 
Coringo ; also one of the river Tigris, and one from Canton to the Island of 
Sankeet, for which last in particular, and for his exertions in improving the 
navigation to and from the East Indies and China, he received the thanks of the 
Court of Directors." — ( Huddarfs Memoir.
) 
His connection, however, with the East India Company had 
not by any means been so profitable as might be supposed.
During a portion of his career his ship, the Royal Admiral, was 
put under orders, and he was engaged, whilst acting with the 
British fleet, in the reduction of Jaggniaultporam and Negapatam, 
and otherwise employed for a time in the King's Service By 
reason of war and bad voyages his pecuniary resources were, 
certainly up to 1783, but little augmented.
Sir Henry Fletcher, 
however, who was then Chairman of the East India Company, 
exercised his privilege of nomination by spontaneously appointing 
Captain Huddart to a Bombay and China voyage (then regarded 
as one of the best).
This voyage proved a highly successful one 
to Captain Huddart, who sailed upon it from the Downs on the 
27th March, 1784, and returned to England in April, 1786.
The 
succeeding voyage was his last one, and it, too, was a prosperous 
one to him.
It was to Madras and China.
He set sail on the 
20th January, 1787, and got back to England in July, 1788.
It will be interesting to know that Sir Henry Fletcher was 
likewise a Cumbrian.
His father was John Fletcher, Esq., of Clea 
120 
Hall, and his mother, Isabella, daughter and co-heiress of John 
Senhouse, Esq., of Netherhall.
He was created a baronet 20th 
May, 1782, and represented his native county in Parliament from 
1768 to 1802 — a period of thirty-four years.
The present Sir 
Henry Fletcher, of Ashley Park, Surrey, fourth Bart., is his great- 
grandson.
Having quitted the sea.
Captain Huddart took up his residence 
at Highbury-terrace, London, in which he continued to live up to his 
decease.
His was not, however, a life of indolence and inactivity.
He added to his house an observatory and workshop, in which he 
was wont, when not engaged upon his surveys and other affairs, to 
indulge his tastes for Astronomy and Mechanics.
Between the years 1789 and 1794 he surveyed the western 
coasts and islands of Scotland.
This chart comprised all the coasts 
and channels between the Mull of Cantire and Cape Wrath, and 
was dedicated to the British Society of Fisheries.
For this chart 
he received the thanks of the Society.
In 1790 he made a 
survey of Hasboro' Gatt.
The year following he was elected an 
Elder Brother of the Trinity House, a position he was eminently 
qualified to adorn.
By electing him one of the Elder Brethren the 
Trinity Corporation paid him a well-deserved compliment.
The 
same year his conspicuous abilities received their due recognition 
from the Fellows of the Royal Society.
To be a Fellow of the 
Royal Society is a distinction which many an eminent scientific 
man has coveted in vain, and that the honour of Fellowship should 
have been bestowed upon Captain Huddart, proves clearly the high 
position which he had then gained in the world of Science.
As an Elder Brother Captain Huddart superintended, amongst 
other maritime works of national imjDortance, the erection of the 
Longships Lighthouse.
For his able services in this direction the 
Trinity Corporation, at a General Court, held on the 8th October 
1795, unanimously voted him their thanks.
As a Fellow of the Royal Society he read an able paper, 
entitled " Observations on Horizontal Refractions which affect the 
Appearance of terrestrial Objects, and the Dip, or Depression, of 
the Horizon of the Sea." This paper, which was read on the 
121 
24th November, 1796, was ordered to be printed by the Society, 
who passed a vote of thanks to Captain Huddart for it.
A letter 
written by him to the Rev. Joseph Priestly, LL.D., F.R.S., entitled 
"An Account of Persons who could not distinguish Colours," had 
also been, as far back as the 13th of February, 1777, communicated 
to the Society.
In promoting the construction of the London Docks, Captain 
Huddart took an active part, as well as in the construction of the 
docks for the accommodation of the East India trade.
Of both 
these undertakings he was a Director, and he had the distinguished 
honour of laying the foundation stone of the latter work.
Captain Huddart also had the merit of devising a plan for the 
improvement of cordage.
Rope-making at that time, especially the 
manufacture of ships' cables and tackle, was of more importance 
than it is in the present iron age.
He offered his invention — the 
principle of which was that every component part of the rope should 
bear its proportion of strain — to the East India Company, but they 
declined it.
Subsequently Captain Huddart formed a private 
company at Limehouse, and he there personally superintended the 
construction of the requisite machinery, the whole of the designs 
of which are said to have been drawn by himself.
The machinery 
is stated to have been of a very elaborate kind, and the works 
themselves to have been in their day unrivalled.
It seems Captain 
Huddart had at one time described his principle to a Mr. Barnes, 
a rope-maker at Maryport, but Mr. Barnes, it appears, could not 
see his way to the adoption of it, otherwise we might have had an 
important rope manufactory in our midst.
In 1797 Captain Huddart appears to have built another vessel 
in Mr. William Wood's yard at Maryport.
She was taken to 
London when built, and used by Captain Huddart for scientific 
experiments in connection with ship-building, in which he took a 
great interest.
As an engineer and surveyor.
Captain Huddart appears to 
have had a most distinguished reputation.
A good deal of his 
advice seems to have been given gratuitously, and with the express 
object of furthering the public good.
In December, 1789, he 
122 
received a vote of thanks from the Trustees of the Harbour of 
Whitehaven for a plan which he had submitted to that body for 
the improvement of their harbour.
In the Cumberland Pacquet of 
2oth January, 1790, reference is made to this plan as follows : — 
"Captain Huddait, whose abilities as a surveyor are well known, has 
offered a plan for the improvement of this harbour which is said to be more 
generally approved than any other ; but we do not hear that anything has been 
agreed on." 
The paragraph is a trifle bald — old Ware (the editor at that time) 
was evidently somewhat out of his depth.
We shall however see, bye 
and bye, that there were rival projects before the Board, on which 
opinions were — as we have known them to be in other places in 
more recent times— a good deal divided.
At all events, in the 
following week's impression of the Cumberland Pacquet, there 
appeared another paragraph, which, as a bit of judicious trimming, 
it would be difficult to surpass.
This paragraph runs : — 
" Our notice of Mr. Huddart's plan for the improvement of this harbour 
went, as we are now informed, further than the circumstances would warrant.
Amid such a contrariety of opinion, it is perhaps impossible to say which 
projection may have the most suffrage.
There is, no doubt, a general dispo- 
sition to adopt the best." 
The suggested improvements appear to have consisted of adding 
the two return piers at that port.
The east return is stated by Mr.
James Walker, of London, and Mr. Jesse Hartley, of Liverpool, 
civil engineers, in their report on Whitehaven harbour, dated the 
17th May, 1836 (a copy of which has been kindly lent to me by 
Mr. John Musgrave, the chairman of the Whitehaven Trustee 
Board), to have been built first.
The effect of it was to throw 
back the westerly seas into the west part of the harbour.
To 
prevent this the west return was built.
Their joint effect was to 
deepen the harbour, but the funnel mouth threw in heavy seas, 
and made the whole so unquiet that the old bulwark was shifted 
eastward, by which the eastern harbour was naturally quieted.
The North Tongue, now called the Bulwark, seems to be here 
referred to.
It was erected about the year 1804, and shortly after 
Captain Huddart had submitted his report thereon to the Trustees.
123 
A copy of this report, and of the plan therein referred to, Mr.
Musgrave has also furnished me with.
The report bears date 
AUonby, the 27th day of October, 1804, and is as follows :— 
"To Robert Blackeney, Esquire.
"Dear Sir,— I have received your favour of the 28th ult., inclosing a plan 
and suggested improvement for the northern part of the harbour of White- 
haven, requesting my further consideration of this subject at the request of the 
Trustees.
I was desirous to view the harbour in its present state (in order to 
ascertain whether the effects of the late works were what I had reason to 
e.xpect,) before I gave an opinion upon the tongue or breakwater for stilling the 
north harbour, which I have done ; and taking the whole into consideration, I 
give it as my opinion that the North Tongue should begin at the lioht line 
jommg the extremities of the New Quay, and the North Pier or quay continued, 
leaving 38 yards clear, &c., between the North Quay and the Tongue, at its 
south-west angle.
From which poim the Tongue to be extended in a right line 
to jom the old Bulwark at 50 yards distance from the north-west angle of ihe 
sugar house yard, as by the inclosed plan, in which the North Tongue (wi;h an 
additional breadth to the Bulwark), is coloured red, and which additional 
breadth may be further extended down the Tongue as occasion may require for 
business.
I have mentioned 38 yards of clear opening for better accommo- 
dation, presuming that the north harbour will then be so still as not to occasion 
any damage to the shipping therein ; but if a further reduction of waves is 
thought necessary, it may be obtained by adding to the length of the Tongue 
as represented by dotted lines, at any future period.
It is also my opinion that 
this Tongue will not sensibly affect the old harbour, and will render the whole 
area of the North Harbour perfectly secure for shipping.
-I am, sir, your most 
obedient, 
"Allonby, 27th October, 1804." "^' ""°°^'^'^- 
Mr. Musgrave informs me that when the whole of Captain Hud- 
dart's improvements had been carried out, experience has found 
them to be most efficient, and in every way satisfactory.
In September, 1793, Captain Huddart received the thanks of, 
and a silver cup from, the Mayor and Corporation of Boston, for 
his survey of the harbour and river at that place.
The Commis- 
sioners of Customs formally thanked him in November, 1794, for 
his survey of the port of Hull.
In June, 1 795, the trustees of the 
harbour of Swansea passed a resolution acknowledging his valuable 
suggestions for the improvement of that harbour, which were 
earned into effect.
In the year 1796, he surveyed the harbour of 
Portsmouth.
He also surveyed the same year the harbour of 
SL Agnes, Cornwall, and drew a plan for a new jetty there.
In 
1800 he surveyed and reported upon the harbour of Leith, at the 
124 
request of the magistrates and council of the city of Edinburgh.
He had the honour to see his suggestions adopted, and to be the 
recipient from tliat body of a resokition conveyed to him by the 
Lord Provost, thanking him for his valuable advice and assist- 
ance.
In January, 1803, the thanks of the Director-General 
of Inland Navigation were voted to him for the "consider- 
ation and application" he gave to the improvement of the 
harbour of Dublin.
In May, 1808, he visited Holyhead, and 
reported upon the proper site for the erection of a lighthouse, 
which resulted in the building of a lighthouse on the South 
Stack.
The same year he went to Ireland with the celebrated 
engineer, the late Mr. Rennie, to advise the Government as 
to the expediency of making a harbour at Howth to accommodate 
packets.
He also, in conjunction with the late Mr. Mylne and 
Mr. Rennie, at the request of the Navy Board, reported upon the 
improvement of the dockyard at Woolwich ; and at the request of 
the Government went with Mr. Mylne to Portsmouth, on account of 
the then contemplated improvements of the harbour there.
Captain 
HluI lart also assisted in the survey of the dockyard at Sheerness, 
and for his co-operation received the thanks of the Lords' Com- 
mittee of the Admirality.
He was also employed to settle the 
boun.laries of the Whitstable Oyster Fisheries.
In 1809, Captain Huddart purchased the residential estate of 
BrynKer, in Carnarvonshire, and later on other important properties 
n the same county.
He, however, never resided upon, and it is 
said that he never even saw, his estates, the management of which 
he deputed to his sole surviving son.
These estates are still in the 
po: session of the Huddart tamily, the present representative being 
George Augustus Huddart, Esq., Deputy-Lieutenant and J.
P., 
Carnarvonshire, and J.
P., Merionethshire.
As Captain Huddart advanced in life his health gradually 
became less robust.
So long, however, as his health permitted, 
he was assiduous in the performance of the various duties which 
devolved upon him ; but his health at last broke down completely, 
and his illness, which was a protracted one, turned to dropsy, and 
terminated fatally on the 19th August, 1816.
In person Captain Huddart is said to have been tall and 
muscular, of a benign, open, and placid countenance.
In his 
habits he was temperate and abstemious, and of a most kind and 
I 
125 
benevolent disposition.
His manners were simple and unosten- 
tatious.
He mixed but little in general society, but preferred the 
home delights of his own fireside, and the engagements of his study.
When his death was announced in Cumberland, it created a wide- 
spread feeling of genuine sorrow.
His loss, toO; was keenly felt 
by all who had been objects of his unstinted bounty, of whom 
there were many both m this county and elsewhere.
Captain Huddart was interred on the 28th August, in St.
Martin's Church, Westminster.
A white marble monument, by 
Fontano, of Carrara, is erected to his memory in the Chapel of 
Ease of his native village — Allonby, the inscription on which reads 
as follows : — 
Sacred to the Memory of 
CAPTAIN JOSEPH HUDDART, F.R.S., 
formerly of the 
Honourable East India Company's Service, and one of the 
Elder Brethren of the Corporation of the Trinity 
House, London.
He was born at this place, 
nth January, 1741, 
And died at Highbuiy Terrace, near London, 
August 19th, 1816.
He has left a Memorial of his Fame far more lasting than 
this Monument, in those numerous Works of 
Science, by which he has done Honour to 
his Country, benefitted Commerce, 
and improved Navigation.
" Unto whom much is given, of them shall much be required," 
And of him it may be truly said that the pre-eminent 
Powers of his Mind, and his superior Acquirements in 
Mathematics, Mechanics, and Astronomy, were 
unceasingly devoted to the Services of Humanity, 
by pointing out a 
more secure Path in the trackless Deep, 
And by increasing the Facilities and lessening the Dangers 
of those who go down to the Sea in Ships and 
occupy their Business in great Waters.
These men see the Wonders in the Deep.
They were strongly impressed on his capacious Mind ; he 
saw and acknowledged in them the wondrous Works 
of God, and meekly trusting in the Merits of his 
Saviour, closed a life of unblemished 
Integrity, 
in the 75th Year of his Age.
His only surviving Son erected this Monument in commemoration 
of those Virtues which endeared him in all the 
Relations of private life.
126 
The only surviving son here and elsewhere referred to was Sir 
Joseph Huddart (now deceased), of Brynkir.
He was appointed 
deputy-lieutenant for Carnarvonshire in 1820, and served the 
office of High Sheriff in 182 1, when King George the IV., paying 
a visit to the Principality, conferred the honour of knighthood 
upon him.
He married, May 15th, 1808, EUzabeth, second 
daughter of Andrew Durham, Esq., of Belvedere, County Down, 
and had issue nine children.
Such is, briefly, the narrative of Captain Huddart's eventful 
life ; and I hope its relation may have proved both interesting and 
instructive to you.
Within the limited compass of a paper of this 
kind it is obviously difficult, if not impossible, to enter as fully as 
one might wish into details — a task which at this distance of time 
would, in the present instance, be beset with more than ordinary 
difficulty.
It will be seen that Captain Huddart made his reputa- 
tion at a period when the educational machinery of this country, 
compared with that of the present day, was most inefficient and 
insufficient.
The parish school of that ilay, whether as regards its 
structural character or its educational machinery and general 
efficiency, was as nothing compared with the voluntary elementary 
and Board schools of our time.
And yet the century in which 
Captain Huddart lived produced men eminent in every depart- 
ment of genius, who emerged into pubHc life in many instances 
from very humble positions.
It seems as though the want of 
educational facilities in those days impelled men to largely cultivate 
self-culture and self-reliance, and to draw all the more greedily 
from, when found, those springs of knowledge which here and 
there fortunately welled up in the rural plains of intellectual 
barrenness.
At .\llonby, as was not infrequently the case in many rural 
portions of Cumberland, it would almost seem as if the parish 
school had been taught by the incumbent of the parish.
Thus 
children got an education which was, in the majority of cases, 
vastly superior to that which they would have otherwise received 
from the typical country pedagogue.
In Captain Huddart's time no doubt mathematics, and the 
127 
study of the classics especially, flourished in a luxuriant growth in 
our English universities, our public schools, and those numerous 
excellent provincial grammar schools, whose foundations date, for 
the most part, from the Reformation.
But in the more remote 
districts education, even of the elementary kind, was too often at 
a discount, and, as I have already stated, the instruction of the 
young generally depended for its efficiency upon the clergyman of 
the parish, who thus was wont to augment his scanty stipend, 
which in the majority of cases it seemed an abuse of terms to call 
his "living." Two of Captain Huddart's contemporaries, both of 
whom he knew intimately, were Watt, the inventor — I think we 
may call him — of the steam engine, and Rennie, whom I have 
already mentioned.
Time will scarcely permit me to enumerate the names of the 
various other eminent men who were Captain Huddart's contempo- 
raries.
There is, however, one whose name occurs to me whose 
fame will never die.
He was a sailor like himself — I mean the 
immortal Nelson.
You are all more or less acquainted with the 
history of this noble life.
It is the lot of comparatively few men 
to make their mark and to figure as Nelson does in the pages of 
their Nation's history ; but it is the proud boast of all of us that it 
is alike our privilege and duty to help onward, to the best of our 
skill and judgment, the building up and consolidation of our 
mighty empire, the promotion of the spiritual and material improve- 
ment and well-being of its several peoples, the spread of education, 
the cultivation of the Arts and Sciences.
If this somewhat meagre 
account of Captain Huddart's life should in ever so slight a degree 
stimulate the minds of any of my hearers in this direction, I shall 
feel that my labours have indeed been productive of good and 
substantial results.

THE LOCAL MUSEUM, AND ITS RELATION 
TO THE NATURAL HISTORY OF THE DISTRICT.
By JAMES ARLOSH, M.A.
(Read at Carlisle.) 
The great end and aim ever to be kept in view, as it seems to me, 
by the managers of a Local Museum, is the collection of all 
objects of interest peculiar to the district or county in which it is 
situated.
But by " objects of interest " I do not mean monstros- 
ities, or abnormal forms, such as white blackbirds or two-headed 
calves.
I mean a carefully arranged, classified, and named 
collection of specimens of every Bird, Beast, Insect, or Reptile to 
be found in the district; supplemented, of course, by every relic 
of Antiquity, and by specimens of all the Minerals which can be 
obtained.
A miscellaneous gathering together of a number of stuflfed 
birds and beasts from every quarter of the globe— Warblers, Pies, 
and Seabirds, Finches and Hawks, jostling each other in sweet 
confusion— is only puzzling to the visitor, who wants information 
accurately and clearly given, of the objects of natural interest to 
be found in any given area.
I will confine myself to speaking this day upon that branch 
of my general subject with which I am best acquainted : the Birds 
and Beasts of Cumberland.
No detail is too minute to be care- 
fully recorded ; and if there were a County Museum in every 
County Town in England, arranged as I would have it, I am 
certain that many most curious additions would be made to the 
130 
stock of knowledge upon its general Natural History.
The birds 
of hardly any two counties are exactly the same.
Here, in Cum- 
berland for instance, we have commonly amongst us birds excessively 
rare, or altogether unknown, in Northumberland, and vice versa.
This at once throws some degree of hght upon the interesting 
question of migration.
We get birds with us which come from the 
west — they get those from the east, as I believe ; not exclusively 
of course, but in part.
Again, apart from the migration question now, we are 
especially rich in many varieties of the beautiful Wren family, 
that lovely little warbler, most graceful of its graceful kind,* the 
Wood Wren,^ and the "King with the Crown of Fire;"^ and 
these are birds — except in a few favoured spots — scarcely known 
amongst our neighbours.
A carefully prepared case of every 
specimen of the Wren family or Warblers to be found in Cum- 
berland, would naturally attract the attention of one coming from 
the adjoining county ; and so, what to us would appear common, 
to them would seem rare and of interest.
Again, supposing any one writing or talking of the English 
birds in general were to confine himself — and mind, it is not 
unnatural that he should — to the birds of his immediate neighbour- 
hood, what false ideas would be afloat !
and such a one would 
seem to one of another county of equally narrow views, to be but 
talking idly.
What I want is, that from these local museums 
should spring, in these days of easy travelling from county town to 
county town, a wider spread of, and more intimate acquaintance 
with, the general Natural History of England as a whole : each 
man's knowledge of his own district thoroughly enlarged by a 
careful study of the specimens in other counties.
An English bird is an Enghsh bird, you may say ; but as I 
have shewn in the case of this county and Northumberland the 
variation, so believe me, in other counties it is the same.

No nightingale north of the Trent,i it is said; and the 
difference between birds of the various districts of England is 
almost as great as the difference between the dingy sparrow of 
Carlisle streets and a Bird of Paradise.
How amazed, for instance, 
I should be if on coming home through the Woodside plantations 
some evening, I heard the wild, mocking cry of the Great "YafRr," 
or Laughing Woodpecker,^ a sound I have heard daily in Hamp- 
shire; or in early morning I saw the uncanny Wryneck swarming 
up the bole of one of my apple-trees, as I have seen him many a 
score of times in Somersetshire.
I will instance the desirability of a careful knowledge of district 
peculiarities, by showing how I once ran a certain amount of risk 
by the want of such knowledge in a strange place.
It is generally 
known that there are but two kinds of snakes in England^ — the 
green harmless snake,* a pretty shining creature of gentle manners, 
and the Viper or Adder,^ dingy in his olive-coloured skin, with 
flattened vicious head and poisonous bite.
Well, one fine summer 
day, upon the threshold of my home in Somersetshire — ^just on the 
borders of Dorsetshire — at the open door, basking upon the warm 
flag-stone, I spied a gorgeous creature — a snake indeed such as I 
had never seen, of a fiery golden red, glittering and beautiful.
No 
adder, thought I, could ever shine so ; you, my friend, 7nust be 
harmless.
I could not kill him upon my very door-stone, and I 
stooped down to pick him up and caress him.
I did not do so, 
however, but guided him with my stick into a bed of evergreens 
hard by, and made a note of his appearance.
He was a Dorset- 
shire Red Adder, I found out at last, — by pertinacious enquiry, for 
there was no local museum — a hurtful beast, even more venomous 
than his dingy-coloured brother, and a variety unknown except in 
Dorsetshire and its immediate borders.
Ctii bono ?
of what good is all this trifling ?
some may ask — a 
singing bird is a singing bird.
None who have not tried it know 
^ I have since been told that nightingales are heard every spring at 
Prestwich Cleugh, near Manchester.

the delight there is — the constant pleasure — in every country walk, 
in distinguishing the notes ol all the various warblers, in noting the 
appearance of our summer visitors, and in listening for them — 
noting indeed the passage of time by the melody of birds.
In the 
dull heart of summer, when Nature's work seems done, how deep a 
silence falls upon the resting earth; but we are soon warned that this 
is but a short breathing space — another autumn is upon us, and 
the familiar bright-eyed Robin tells us this the first unerringly by 
his sad sweet song — how different to that he piped to us in opening 
spring!
Some of our summer visitors indeed we seldom or never see, 
and yet would miss their voices.
All my Hfe I have been trying to 
see the Grasshopper Lark,i whose sweet tantalizing chirrup here 
enlivens many a hedge bank on many a summer evening.
To me 
he has ever proved a delusive phantom ; but this summer I will 
yet again make pleasant search for him.
He is an elegant little 
bird, runs like a mouse, and chirrups like the shrill Cicala.
We are very rich in Birds here; it would indeed give me 
pleasure to see a well-stuffed collection — well named and well 
classified — in this bright and cheerful room.
I believe we have a 
bird all to ourselves here in Cumberland, unknown in any other 
part of England, indeed in Cumberland confined to only one spot 
— Devoke Water, in Eskdale — the Devoke Water Mew, a fresh 
water guU.^ Many a time I have watched them with delight in a 
wild, stormy evening in summer, their wild cries mixing with the 
plash of the rain and the growling of the thunder in that desolate 
place — sporting here and there, their long wings doing brave battle 
against the freshening wind.
West Cumberland some years ago was a grand field for the 
out-door naturalist : Ravens at St. Bees, Buzzards on Blengtongue 
— and now and again I have seen the Kite, with his wonderful 
sweep of pinion, soaring away over the wild roads on Cold Fell.
Thereabouts also I have seen what I never saw elsewhere — Water-I 
ousels building in a company — in fact an ouselry.
Now in the] 
case where the ousels were in the museum, there might be a little] 
^ Salicaria locustella.
* The Black-headed Gull, Z.
ridihmdus.
— (Ed.) 
bit of local information given — " Under a bridge in Wormgill, 
West Cumberland, over the CaUler, there existed for some years 
a small colony of ousels, who built their nests close together" 
— or something of the kind.
Every minute detail of every bird 
should be given, mind that — especially dates as to time of 
shooting.
In whiter here we have great flocks of hen Chaffinches — in 
otlier counties great flocks of cock birds ; and now we come to 
see the use of dates — arguing from this broad example, useless 
perhaps except as an example — for by dates alone can we ever 
hope to get some clue to the partial migration of birds in England 
— a great mystery !
I often wondered what became of our familiar 
friends the Starlings, after with so much fuss and noise they had 
reared their young about our chimney tops ; — and what a bold 
beautiful fellow the cock Starling is, shining resplendent in the sun 
with his coat of rainbow colouring — glossy, iridescent.
I ceased 
to wonder after one wild November day I spent in a long walk 
upon the downs between Somerset and Wiltshire.
I had the luck to 
see that day absolutely thousands of Starlings packed flying south- 
wards; and during the years I spent in Somersetshire, as each 
winter came round, with it came the flights of Starlings ; but I 
never but that once saw the whole body, as it were, of all the 
Northern Birds upon the wing.
Now mark the difference — here, 
when the Starlings come, we know that spring is come ; there, their 
arrival told us of the Cyder-time — and greedily they took their 
share of the stores of fruit laid up in every orchard ; and were shot 
down — I regret to say — pitilessly; and I have heard that a starling 
pie was no mean dish.
It is easily intelligible how tender birds may like warmer 
quarters than we can offer them in winter months — small blame to 
them these winters — but the subtle influences which induce certain 
birds at certain times to leave their usual haunts, and repair to 
others apparently very little dissimilar, are too subtle for us to 
explain readily.
Flocks of Bullfinches, for instance, coming down at certain 
times, but not staying to breed, and Goldfinches (and in North- 
134 
umberland Siskins).
I have never found a Goldfinch's nest here, 
but have in West Cumberland ; here I have frequently seen small 
flights of Goldfinches in winter, which I never saw in the West.
Again — for reference in uncertainty — how useful to students of the 
Natural History of their district, to have a good Collection for 
their guidance and information.
I do not mean that there is only 
one — but there is one family of Birds especially in this County, of 
which I want more certain knowledge — the Doves ; and my 
difficulty in this matter shews the need of very great accuracy in all 
our doings.
We all know the Wood-pigeon or Cushat,^ coming 
down in great flocks upon our turnip fields and oak trees in early 
winter — shy, and wary, and strong.
Now he, I believe, is the 
Ringdove, the largest of the pigeon tribe indigenous to England ; 
but is he the bird which builds in our tall fir trees, and makes the 
soit spring mornings pleasant with his murmurous cooings ?
or is 
that the Stock-dove,^ smaller and darker in feather?
or do they 
pack together as winter comes on, and then are indiscriminately 
shot as " Cushats" or Wood-pigeons ?
We find in the Natural History books — the Ring-dove, 
Cushat or Queest, the largest of all the pigeon tribe.
A great 
friend of mine in Herefordshire — dead now, poor fellow — a good 
sportsman and keen observer, used to tell me that the Turtle 
Dove* was a regular summer visitor in his county, and bred in the 
great hedgerows ; that they generally left about the second week 
n September ; and that it was an old custom of the old-fashioned 
gentry, at the end of -their first day's partridge shooting, to kill a 
brace or two of these beautiful little birds on their way home — and 
it was called in the vulgar tongue "Queest" — so in loose parlance, 
to the largest and the smallest specimens of one family, the same 
name appears to be given in different parts of England.
Now all this may seem the veriest trifling to one who cares 
for none of these things.
It is wonderful, perhaps, how full of 
interest it is to me, and men of like mind ; but only think how 
pleasant, in any perplexity, to be able to have all cleared up by 
looking at the cases in the complete collection in the County 
"^ Columba pahimbus.

Museum.
The perfection of such an Institution would be its 
completeness ; and we will assume that the best specimens should 
be drafted into it periodically from all the different districts — here, 
for instance, from Wigton, Brampton, and Keswick — and that 
representatives from district committees should meet yearly in 
general committee.
A pleasant intercourse would thus spring up 
amongst men of congenial tastes, and the specimens of Natural 
History of the whole county would be carefully and systematically 
arranged.
No locality is so small but that it has some bird, I 
believe, almost peculiar to itself; I may be wrong, and if so, I will 
most gladly be set right.
But, for instance, as long as I remember, 
year after year, we have had at Woodside a pair of Redstarts — 
and beautiful birds they are : haughty and intolerant of all company 
but that of man, and with him familiar and confidential.
Now 
certainly in that part of the West of Cumberland where I lived 
for some years, the Redstart was unknown.
In arranging the cases of specimens I should suggest, in 
addition to the careful naming and dating, that each case was made 
large enough at first to accommodate at least two specimens, cock 
and hen, of every variety in the whole family.
For instance, take 
the Tits — we have the lovely little blue bird,^ a bold and venture- 
some fellow, ready to fight upon the slightest provocation — or 
without any at all for that matter — utterly regardless of disparity 
of weight or size, and particularly distinguished by his sleepless 
dislike to the Owl. The Ox-eye- with his bright black hood 
shining like satin.
The Long-tailed Tit,^ with its beautiful pendu- 
lous nest in summer ; a great favourite too, as we see him and his 
faithful partner together, even in winter, flitting about amongst the 
birch trees, brisk and cheerful even in the keenest weather.
And 
the Marsh Titmouse,* with whom I am not so intimately acquainted; 
he is apt, without special knowledge, to be confused, I fancy, with 
his black-capped brother, or Ox-eye, though quite distinct when 
the two can be seen together.
Of the Bearded Titmouse,^ or — as 
he is sometimes miscalled — the Least Butcher Bird,"^ I think we

" Partis caudatus.
* Parns palustris.

136 
should get no specimen.
He is chiefly found in the more southern 
counties.
This family would make a charming case ; and if the 
cases were made with their backs upon hinges, to open like a 
door, and projecting perches fixed therein, they could be opened 
at any time to add fresh specimens as they came in, taking care 
just to paste a strip of American cloth round the outside edges 
after each opening, to prevent dust getting in to the discolouring 
of the plumage.
Of Beasts, or Quadrupeds, we have not here a very great 
variety ; but the Sweet Mart^ is almost or altogether unknown in 
many parts of England ; and I believe we might with a little 
trouble yet secure a specimen of the Mouse Weasel,^ a fiendish 
little chap, not bigger than a very large mouse, but with the thirst 
of blood for which his family is celebrated highly developed 
indeed in inverse ratio to his size.
The Mole we have too ; and 
I remember when a boy a beautiful cream-coloured one being 
caught at Woodside.
This concentrated essence of energy — 
superior even to the Shrew in the frenzy of his passion for either 
love or war — is a wonderful beast ; his underground dwelling a 
marvel of engineering skill ; himself one of the boldest and craftiest 
of all God's wonderful creatures.
He is the only quadruped I 
know which feigns death.
After a long watch, I once caught one 
alive by Bleng-side.
I wanted sadly to keep and tame a mole, 
and slung him carefully in my handkerchief triumphant, plotting 
and devising as I went what I could do for his comfort : how I 
would get an old tub cut in half, filled with earth and plenty of 
earth-worms.
Meditating thus, I thought I would just see how 
my little friend in black velvet was getting on ; so I sat down on 
a nice smooth bit of turf and opened my handkerchief.
Really, 
to my remorse, the little creature lately so full of life and energy 
was dead !
almost stiff.
I laid him gently on the grass and 
smoothed his coat, admired his nervous hands and trenchant 
snout.
And then it seemed so strange a thing !
He couldn't 
have been suffocated, the hardy httle miner?
I had waded the 
river, and only come about a mile since I had taken him.
Sus-

137 
picion grew on me.
I retired and hid behind some bracken.
Scarcely five minutes passed after I was safely out of sight, before 
up sprang the deceiver, and made off faster than you could have 
believed it possible, to some softish ground near, and there 
disappeared.
He had a sufficiently long run in the open to have 
given me time to have outpaced and again secured him; but I 
allowed the little beastie to escape — it was not in my heart to 
condemn him to a tub after a display of such wonderful craft, 
such cool and heroic deception.
And then that harmless vegetarian, the Water Vole,i perse- 
cuted by anglers for others' sins — still, I am glad to say, haunts 
many a river bank amongst us — the dwarf beaver, rather than the 
water rat.
The Shrew Mouse,^ of course, with its unpalatable carcass, 
rejected by every cat, hawk, dog, and owl; but have we certainly 
the Water Shrew^ or the Elephant Shrew* 1 and have we the 
Harvest Mouse^ 1 the smallest of British quadrupeds.
The Long- 
tailed Field-Mouse'' I have assuredly seen, but never its Short-tailed 
brother^ ; and we decidedly have not the Hamster.^ And I never 
met the Badger, poor old fellow — very harmless, but with an ill 
reputation ; shy and retiring in his manners, if only unmolested — 
so shy that in his own haunts even, I have tried in vain many a 
time to see him.
Moving with an unwieldy gait, between the 
amble of a hurried pig and the shuffle of a brown bear.
I have 
watched, I say, for hours in a coppice in Hampshire, where his 
earth was, but never caught him on the move, though I used to see 
his footprints all about on the fresh earth the very morning after.
I am afraid we should not want a large case for the show of 
Quadrupeds.
Now of Reptiles.
I am very fond of the Toad ; and I believe 
that in this county we have a peculiar variety.
I have studied the 
habits and ways of many in my father's conservatory.
We had 
one for a long time who came out regularly every evening at the

same time for a shower bath, which was given him tenderly from 
the fine rose of a watering-can.
The Common Toad crawls with 
an ungainly motion with the foot flat to the ground ; the toad 
which I believe to be a distinct variety, steps delicately upon the 
tips of his toes.
I have been intimately acquainted with several 
members of the toad family who always moved in this fashion ; 
and in addition to this distinctive peculiarity, such always, as I 
fancied, were brighter and glossier in their skins — the mincing 
dandies of their race.
One of the most curious sights of the kind 
I know is to see a toad sitting holding an earth-worm in his 
grotesque fingers, and drawing it deliberately into his mouth, as I 
have seen a Frenchman eat a slender roll, or a child a finger biscuit.
I only know of one species of Frog in England, though I have 
heard tales from the fens of one like the American bullfrog for size 
and voracity ; but I speak with caution, for of the Bat alone I was 
told with authority the other day, in England there are upwards of 
twenty varieties.
We have at any rate here to my knowledge 
neither the mute or edible Frog of France,^ nor the brilliant little 
Tree Frog of southern Italy.
^ I cannot resist here telling you a 
story of a frog I once knew.
Some years ago I was walking along 
a dusty high road early in March, a cold north-easter blowing, 
when I espied the most deplorable-looking frog it was ever my 
ill fortune to meet.
His skin was dry and hard and shrunken, 
and his poor worn body seemed actually shrivelled.
JNotv, 
with his fellows, under favourable circumstances he should 
have been enjoying himself with all a summer's pleasure before 
him, swelling the jocund song of his race — Brachy Koax — which 
would soon be going merrily up from many a reedy pool and deep 
lake side.
I pitied my friend upon the highway, wrapped him up 
in my handkerchief and took him home — placed him in a large 
foot bath with a box lid for a floating island, gave him some shreds 
of raw meat, and left him for the night.
To make a long story 
short, he soon grew fat and well liking, and as soon as he saw me 
would hop up on to his island, and gaze at me from his far away 
sphynx-like eyes.
This was curious ; but he grew so familiar that 
' Rana escuknta.
* Hyla arborea, — (Ed.) 
139 
he used to sit upon my knee in front of the fire enjoying the 
warmth — his skin distended with moisture like a sponge, for such 
is frog nature — stretching now one leg out, now another, and 
answering a gentle rubbing under the throat with a subdued croak 
of evident pleasure.
I called him " Pharaoh," and when quite 
restored to health and vigour, turned him into a little wayside 
marsh at the back of my garden, where he founded a colony, and 
for all the time I lived I never wanted for the cheerful sound of 
" Krrk Kurruk," all through the pleasant springtide.
Of Fishes and Insects I am sorry to say I know very little— 
but the Eden Whiting is surely peculiar to that river ; and do 
Flounders usually come so far upwards from the sea as they must 
do to be caught, as I am told they are, at Wetheral ?
There is 
also a fresh water Mussel pecuhar to the Petteril.i 
Two years ago I found a colony of the grub of the Goat - 
Moth in a mouldering old oak ; and the same year we caught a 
very fine specimen of the Death's-Head Moth.
Is it commonly 
known — I daresay it is — that this unfortunate creature when seized 
screams Uke a rabbit or a child ?
I must now apologise for the constant egotism so apparent in 
what I have just read.
That hateful letter "I" — capital I — recurs 
in almost every sentence ; but I did not want to give a cool resi/me 
of many books which you can all read for yourselves, but merely 
to lay before you, for as much as they are worth, a few observations 
of my own ; having given nothing on hearsay or from mere printed 
history, with the few exceptions I have noted as I went on.
There are just one or two practical points I would touch on 
before I stop.
When I said what I did about the value of local 
objects of interest, do not imagine for one moment that I would 
exclude foreign beasts and birds altogether from a County Museum 
— only keep them separate.
If possible get a collection together, 
by all means — every bird and beast under the broad canopy of 
heaven ; but surely let that come by and by.
Let us begin at 
home, and when we have exhausted all our home subjects — in the 
collection of which we may all take an intelligent part — then if we 
^ Unto sp.
or Anodon sp.

140 
are in funds, we may enlarge our borders, and buy specimens of 
foreign creatures, which, bright and beautiful as they may be, will 
never, I venture to say, interest us half as much as those humbler 
denizens of our own county, endeared to us by a thousand pleasant 
recollections — in each one of which we have grown to feel a sort 
of kindly proprietorship.
There are already here a good number 
of specimens of British birds ; more than that — County birds — 
which only require a little careful handling and re-setting, to form 
a fair beginning.
If practicable, I should like to see the English 
and Latin names of each family painted in plain letters — black, in 
the inside of each family case, and the individual name of each 
member of such family so painted upon each perch respectively 
occupied.
The system of naming I would suggest is that followed 
by Bewick : so very simple — giving the family name in English as 
we will say of "The Wagtail," the "Pied Wagtail" member of that 
family.
We should avoid all decoration of the cases in the inside with 
grasses, flowers, or the like, but attempt to give each bird its most 
distinctive attitude.
The Kingfisher, for instance, with open wings, 
head downwards, ready for his rapid plunge.
I wonder if there are 
any of these beautiful birds still to be found on the Petteril side?
I have seen them there when I was a boy.
And in those happy 
days I have met both with the Whin Chat and the Stone Chat 
on Wragmire Moss edges and on Blaze Fell road.
Yet once more.
A County Museum would be incomplete 
without a collection of all the Plants indigenous to the county ; 
and the more active minds we can enlist to help us in our general 
scope the better.
No doubt many who care not for birds and 
beasts, make Botany their study; and the Ferns alone in this 
county would make a beautiful collection.
Secure their aid.
With the County birds fairly ranged and classified by themselves; 
with the British birds in general so classified also, so that at a 
glance may be seen in what members of each family the County 
is deficient ; with a few bright cases of Foreign birds perhaps, as 
an ornament ; with the valuable collection of Antiquities already 
acquired ; with a complete Hortus Siccus of the County — with its 
141 
Moths and Butterflies and its Quadrupeds — how complete the 
Institution would be !
and in working to attain this end, what a 
number of charming rides might not a number have, each careering 
on his especial hobby.
The old prints, too, of the good old houses and the good old 
City in the good olden times— how fair they shew already upon 
the walls.
And why should not some who care for neither birds 
nor weeds, nor beasts nor moths, turn their attention to collect 
likenesses of our Cumberland worthies ?
If a County Museum were what it should be, scarcely one 
intelligent man would be without an opportunity of gratifying his 
private taste for the pubHc good.
I have said my say, and thank you heartily for having borne 
with me so patiently.

NOTES ON INGLEWOOD FOREST.
By JOHN JACKSON.
(Read at Dalston.) 
[The following Notes on Inglewood Forest have been chiefly gleaned from 
the county Histories and other books ; some few are original.
— ^J.
J.] 
The Ancient Forest of Englewood, or Inglewood, long formed 
part of the domain of the Crown of England.
At a very- 
early time it was described as "a goodly great forest, full of 
wood, red deer and fallow, wild swine, and all manner of wild 
beasts."* In the reign of William Rufus it was uncultivated, 
and the soil neglected for some years after this period, except in 
the immediate neighbourhood of Carlisle.
William therefore sent 
a body of men from the South of England to instruct the natives 
in the art of cultivating the soil, and making it contribute to their 
subsistence.
Inglewood Forest comprises part of Leath Ward, Allerdale 
Ward below Derwent, and Cumberland Ward, and includes the 
whole or most part of eighteen parishes.!
In a perambulation of 
the boundaries of the Forest by the Commissioners of Edward I., 
in the twenty-ninth year of his reign, they were declared to be as 
follows : — "Beginning at the bridge of Caldew, without the city of 
Carlisle, and so by the highway unto Thursby towards the south ; 
* Jefferson's Leath Ward, p.
"J.
+ Given in Nicolson and Burn's Westmorland and Cttmberland, 
144 
and from Thursby by the same way through the middle of the 
town of Thursby to Waspatrick wath, ascending by the Water of 
Wampole to the place where Shawk falls into Wampole, and from 
thence going up straight to the Head of Rowland Beck ; and from 
that place descending to the Water of Caldbeck ; and so down by 
that Water to the place where Caldbeck falls into the Caldew.
And so up to Gyrgwath ; and so by the highway of Sourby unto 
Stanewath, under the Castle of Sourby ; and so by the highway up 
to Mabil Cross ; and so to the Hill of Kenwathen, going down by 
the said highway through the middle of the town of Alleynby (now 
EUonby), and so by the same way through the middle of the town 
of Blencowe ; and so by the same way unto Palat ; and so going 
down by the same way unto the bridge of Amote (now Eamont 
Bridge) ; and so from that bridge going down by the bank of 
Amote unto Eden ; and so descending by the water of Eden unto 
the place where Caldew falls into Eden ; and from that place to 
the bridge of Caldew aforesaid, without the gate of the city of 
Carlisle." 
Thus it will be observed that the Forest comprehended all 
that large and now fertile tract of country extending westward from 
Carlisle by Thursby to Westward, and thence to Caldbeck, Castle 
Sowerby, Mabil Cross, Blencowe, and Penrith, whence its boundary 
extends along the Eamont to the Eden, which constitutes its 
eastern limit, all the way northward to Carlisle, where it terminates 
in a point as at Westward ; and the confluence of the Eamont and 
Eden, forming a sort of triangle, two sides of which are more than 
twenty miles in length, and one side twelve miles.
It was divided 
into two Wards : the High Ward, from Penrith to Hesket ; and 
the Low Ward, thence to Carlisle.
The Scots, who were dispossessed of this great Forest by 
William II., were very loath to relinquish their claim, and they 
several times regained it; but in 1237, Alexander II., King of 
Scotland, at a conference held in York, gave it up, together with 
all the forfeited estates possessed by the Scots in Cumberland and 
other northern counties.
In the eighth year of Edward II., Edward de Brus, brother of 
145 
Robert, entered Cumberland, and tarrying at Rose Castle three 
whole days, sent out parties to burn, destroy, and plunder on all 
sides.
In the tenth year of Edward II., the Scots again entered 
Cumberland, and proceeding as far as Richmond, in Yorkshire, 
with all possible devastation, turned thence towards Fumess in 
Lancashire, burning and destroying all the way they went.
Here 
they were much pleased with finding large quantities of iron, which 
did not abound in Scotland.
The chronicle addSj that in this 
year great plague and famine raged in both England and Scotland 
to a degree till then unheard of; and that the quarter of bread soon 
sold in the north for forty shillings.
In 1322, Robert Bruce burned Rose Castle; and in 1345, 
during an incursion of a large Scottish army into Cumberland, 
Penrith was burnt, and many of the inhabitants carried into 
captivity.
During a truce between the English and Scottish nations in 
1380, the Scots passing by Carlisle laid waste the Forest of Ingle- 
wood, where, says Dr. Todd, "they seized 4000 cattle." In the 
reign of Henry VI., inroads, or forays — as they were termed — were 
numerous, and attended with increased destruction ; and so con- 
tinued to the reign of Henry VIII., by whom it was disforested.
In 1229, Henry III.
granted by charter the manor to Walter 
Malclerck, Lord Treasurer of England and Bishop of Carlisle, and 
to his successors there, with authority to make parks, and to possess 
the manor as a forest of their own, with all the privileges of a 
Royal Forest, forbidding all others to sport within its limits, under 
penalty of the payment of ten pounds.
In 1374, Bishop Appleby's Register says : — " Several unknown 
persons have broken into the Bishop's park at Rose, and (with 
dogs and nets) have killed and carried off great numbers of his 
deer, and an injunction has been sent out to the neighbouring 
clergy, requiring them to denounce all such offenders." 
In the year 1300, King Edward I.
took up his abode at Rose.
It is related in the chronicle of Lanercost, that "he hunted in the 
Forest of Inglewood, where he took two hundred bucks and does." 
Edward also granted all the extra-parochial tithes of the Forest of 
10 
146 
Inglewood to the Priory of St. Mary's, Carlisle, for the good of his 
soul, and the soul of his wife, Eleanor, of famous memory, some 
time Queen Consort, and the souls of all his ancestors and 
successors.
In 1345, it appears from the Patent Rolls that W.
de Langley, 
High Bailiff of the Forest of Inglewood, was sworn before King 
Edward the Third, that as often as it shall tend to the King's 
honour, he will grant a day's coursing of deer and other game to 
knights and gentlemen, to ladies and other noble persons.
In the 
eighth year of Henry the Fifth, Thomas, Lord Dacre, had a grant 
of the office of Chief Forester ; and in the ninth of Edward the 
Fourth, Humphrey, Baron Dacre of the north, was appointed to 
that office for life.
About 1547, among the fees and emoluments received by the 
Lord Warden of the West Marches, was — "the receipt of the 
Queen's lands, called the Queen's Hames, and Forest of Inglewood, 
with the Stewardship of the forest there.
In 1696, the Forest, with appurtenances, was granted by 
William the Third to William Bentinck, First Earl of Portland, 
whose family retained it till 1787, when it was purchased by the 
Duke of Devonshire, whose descendants, as Lords of the Honour 
of Penrith, have paramount authority over the Manor of Inglewood 
Forest.
Of the many places of interest within the boundary of the 
Forest, perhaps the most classical — but now no longer to be found 
— is Tarn Wadling; and Castle Hewen, traditionally said to have 
been a fortress belonging to Ewain, King of Cumberland, but more 
celebrated as the reputed residence of Sir Gawaine, who conquered] 
King Arthur by enchantment, so that his sinews lost their strength, 
and his arms sank powerless at his side.
The giant seems to have 
been of stature almost as gigantic as the famous Sir Hugh Cesar, 
who is said to be buried at Penrith.
At Tame Wadling his castle stands, 
Near to that lake so fair, 
And proudlye rise the battlements, 
And streamers deck the air.
147 
No gentle knighte, nor lady gay.
May pass that castle-walle : 
But from that foule discourteous knighte 
Mishappe will them befall, 
Hee's twyce the size of common men, 
Wi' thewes and sinewes stronge, 
And on his back he bears a clubbe, 
That is both thicke and longe.
Tarn Wadling was drained in 1858 at the instance of Lord 
Lonsdale ; and what was once a place of attraction to shooters of 
wild fowl, anglers for carp, and gatherers of cranberries, is now a 
broad expanse of cultivated ground.
Of the ancient trees near Hesket, there stands the "Thorn of 
Ransom," or Court Thorn, on the stone beneath whose branches 
annually, on the feast of St. Barnabas (June nth), have assembled 
for unnumbered years the tenants of upwards of twenty manors, 
from whom a jury was impannelled and sworn, of which Dr. Hugh 
Todd says, the Chamberlain of Carlisle anciently was foreman.
Here were paid the annual dues to the Bow Bearer of Inglewood 
Forest.
Mr. T.
Denton, writing in 1688, says that the townships of the 
north and the west parts of the Forest meet in the morning, the 
Chamberlain of Carlisle being foreman of their jury; the townships 
of the south and the east parts in the afternoon, the Bailiff of 
Penrith being foreman.
He describes the courts as being hke the 
Swain-Mote courts used in other forests.
In Castle Sowerby there is a lofty hill called Castle Hill, 
which is part of one of the ten principal estates in the parish 
formerly called Red Spears.
The owners of these lands did their 
singular service of riding through the town of Penrith on Whit- 
Tuesday, brandishing their spears.
The spears were about riine 
feet in length, and until within this century some of them remained 
in the proprietors' houses, where they were usually deposited.
These Red Spears were sureties to the Sheriff for the peaceable 
behaviour of the rest of the inhabitants.
The ancient owners of 
the estate now particularly noted, annually served as jurors at the 
Forest Court, by which they were exempted from all parish offices.
148 
Dr. Lonsdale* says that " Thackwood was one of the spear houses 
of the Honor of Penrith." On every Whit-Tuesday, the holders 
of these houses made their appearance at the Forest Courts, and 
they headed the procession which opened Penrith Fair, brandishing 
their spears to defy and to deter marauders.
They were in fact 
conservators of the peace, as well as military tenants, and they 
were charged with the maintenance of good order in their respective 
districts.
Over the front entrance of Thackwood, and standing out 
from the roof, is a small figure of a man holding a spear, and 
tradition yet repeats the cry — 
" Ride on !
ride on !
and turn Dob's Hill," 
which we may fancy to have risen in days of yore, whilst the Red 
Spears, with their followers, started from Thackwood to scour the 
country of marauders, or to muster the population to the peaceful 
gatherings of court or market." Dobs Cross, on Broadfield, is 
supposed to have its name from Dobs Hill, upon which it stands.
In the Parish of Dalston, near Hawksdale lodge, is the 
remains of a fine old oak called "Barras Tree." We are told that 
a bar extended from Dalston Hall to Cumdivock — a distance of 
three miles — raised for the purpose of protection against the 
incursions of the Scotch.
Near this encampment were erected 
several bar houses, occupied by people whose duty it was to give 
the alarm on the approach of the enemy, by the ringing of bells 
and blowing of trumpets, on the sound of which the inhabitants 
drove their cattle behind the bar for safety.
In Dalston parish we 
have such names as Bishop's Dyke, some remains of which are in 
a field opposite Dalston Hall.
Then there is Barras Lonning, 
Barras Gate, Barras Brow, Trumpet Croft, Bell Gate, and Glavet 
Hill, which signifies sword hill, glavc being the name for the long 
sword, hence Glave Hill may be supposed to have been a hill 
where military exercises, or executions, took place.
In the 
* Lonsdale's Memoir of W.
Blamire, Esq., p.

+ Glaive — A cutting instrument used by infantry, and believed to have 
originated from the Celtic custom of fixing a sword to the end of a pole as a 
defensive weapon against cavalry.
149 
adjoining parish of Orton, an iron chain went across the road, 
which was locked every night, and was called Barras Gate.
Next there is the venerable oak now the property of John 
Richardson, Esq.; a tree that induced the Blamires to change 
the name of their homestead in 1790 from Hollin Bush to The 
Oaks, on the same day that the venerable Paley christened their 
son William — of future fame as one of the foremost statesmen of 
Cumberland.
The tree at The Oaks is about three feet from the 
ground, and nineteen feet in girth.
By the road side, between 
Hawksdale and Rose Castle, is a fine old gnarled oak, twenty-one 
feet in circumference.
At Armalhwaite Castle, John Thomlinson, Esq. informs me 
there are some very fine old trees ; one in particular, whose history 
is apparently lost ; but it is a magnificent oak, carefully, and very 
cleverly, bound with iron hoops or bands, and is well worthy the 
attention of this Society when they visit Armathwaite.
On the margin of Wragmire Moss there stood, till 1823, a 
a well known oak, said to be the last tree of Inglewood Forest, 
which had survived the blasts of seven or eight hundred years.
This time-honoured tree was remarkable, not only for the beauty 
of its wood, but for being the boundary mark between the respective 
Manors of the Duke of Devonshire and the Dean and Chapter of 
CarUsle; as also between the parishes of Hesket and St. Cuthbert's, 
Carlisle ; and as such was noticed for upwards of six hundred 
years.* Mr. Jefferson says it fell, not by the tempest or by the axe, 
but from sheer old age.
This happened on the 13th June, 1823.
He goes on to say that — " under its spreading branches may have 
reposed the victorious Edward the First ; and perhaps, at a later 
period, John de Corbrig, the poor hermit of Wragmire, may have 
counted his beads beneath its shade.
From the almost universal opinion that the Wragmire Oak 
was the last tree that remained of the once famous Forest of Ingle- 
wood, I beg strongly to dissent.
There are here in the Rose 
holms three trees, magnificent ruins of what, centuries ago, must 
have been fine members of the sylvan family.
And if we believe 
that

The monarch oak, the patriarch of trees.
Shoots rising up, and spreads by slow degrees ; 
Three centuries he grows, and three he stays 
Supreme in state, and in three more decays, — 
we shall have no difficulty in placing these three amongst the last 
trees of Inglewood Forest.
The one nearest Rose bridge, between 
five and six feet from the ground, is eighteen feet in girth ; the 
middle one, from five to six feet up, is twenty-one feet in circum- 
ference ; and the one nearest Holm Hill, thirteen feet six inches 
in girth.
Knotted and gnarled the trunks of them truly are, for 
for the upper branches have long since disappeared.
Long may 
their remains stand to be ornaments to " Cauda's sweet valley." 
When we remember that many a band of outlaws found refuge in 
the Forest; and many a holy man, disgusted with the world around 
him, also sought refuge there.
Dalston had its hermitage, which 
in 1343 was occupied by a recluse called Hugh de Lilford.
Strangely 
has the country altered since then : the old forests are gone, and 
the sound of industry is now heard instead of the hunter's horn.

DISTRIBUTION OF BOULDERS IN WEST 
CUMBERLAND.
By J.
D. KENDALL, C.E., F.G.S.
HON.
SEC.
OF THE ASSOCIATION, 
(Read at Maryport General Meeting.) 
The remarks which I am about to submit for your consideration 
have reference to a subject which, as many of you will be aware, is 
engaging a large share of the attention of geologists.
Most of 
you, I suppose, have noticed the superficial accumulations of sand 
gravel, and clay, stuck full of boulders, which, in discontinuous 
patches of various thicknesses, extend over the greater part of the 
low ground of this district.
Similar accumulations are found over 
the principal part of Great Britain and Ireland, as well as in the 
north of Europe, Asia, and America.
A few years ago these 
upper deposits, like the old slaty rocks of pre-Devonian age, were 
almost entirely avoided on account of the difficulty attending their 
study.
Now they are the two most active fields of geological 
investigation.
It is, however, only with the former that we are 
concerned at present; and it is somewhat curious to observe how, 
as in most other branches of geological study, the development of 
thought in connection with these superficial accumulations has 
gradually tended towards simplification, by substituting for the 
cataclysms of the eariier geologists such operations as we now see 
going on around us.
Many curious speculations have been in- 
dulged in at different times as to the origin of the deposits under 
consideration, but with those I do not propose to deal; suffice it 
152 
to say that the outcome of all the investigations hitherto made is, 
that these Boulder clays, sands, and gravels are due to ice-action ; 
that they were formed at a time when the countries where they 
occur were swathed in one mass of ice as Greenland is to-day.
This is the general conclusion of geologists, but there are 
very great differences of opinion between them as to the precise 
manner in which the ice acted.
Those differences arise mainly on 
the^relative importance attached to the parts played by glaciers 
on the one hand, and by icebergs and floebergs on the other.
My object at present is not to discuss the merits or demerits of the 
different views set forth by the numerous writers on the subject, 
but rather to place before you a number of relative facts which 
have come under my own observation in the course of numerous 
perambulations through West Cumberland.
In looking at a section of sand and gravel, or of boulder clay, 
as laid open in a railway cutting, a stream side, or along the sea 
shore, almost the first thing that would strike a curious observer is 
the many different kinds of rock which it contains in the form 
of boulders.
If he be well acquainted with the rocks in the im- 
mediate neighbourhood of the section, most likely he will be able 
to identify many of the boulders ; but there will almost certainly 
be a great many others which he cannot identify, unless he has 
travelled and observed far afield.
Should he, however, happen to 
recognise some of the farther-travelled ones, doubtless a very 
curious train of thought will be aroused, and he will be greatly 
puzzled as to how those boulders have come to be where he sees 
them.
Geologists who have made the matter a study, are agreed 
that they have been brought there through the agency of ice ; but 
there is much difference of opinion as to the form of that ice, 
some contending that it acted as glaciers, whilst others are favour- 
able to icebergs and floebergs.
Such being the case, it is somewhat 
remarkable that there should be so little known as there is 
regarding the distribution of boulders ; for many boulders have 
such a distinct character, that it becomes possible to trace out 
almost exactly the course they must have taken in travelling from 
their parent rock to the position they now occupy ; so that by 
153 
accumulating a sufficient quantity of evidence of this sort, we 
should be in a position to say whether the ice by which the 
boulders were transported acted as glaciers or as bergs ; because, 
so far as the dispersal of boulders is concerned, there is a very 
marked difference in the action of ice under these two conditions.
This is the sort of evidence that I propose to lay before you 
now, but only so far as the Glacial deposits of West Cumberland 
are concerned, which of course are but a very small part of the 
whole ; but still, I think we may derive from them many valuable 
hints.
In several parts of the Lake District, occupying very limited 
areas, there are rocks which present such peculiar features, that 
once you become thoroughly acquainted with them, they may be 
recognised anywhere.
One of these rocks occurs as a vein on 
the side of Helvellyn and Armboth Fell.
It is a quartz-felsite, 
containing beautiful pink crystals of felspar.
Boulders of this 
rock occur all the way down St. John's Vale to Threlkeld, where 
the stream seems to have been split, one part going westward, as 
far as Keswick, the other turning towards Troutbeck.
There a 
further division of the boulder stream takes place, and we find 
some of them on the way towards Penrith, whilst others have turned 
round the eastern side of Blencathra, through the valley which 
extends from Troutbeck by Mungrisdale to Caldbeck.
Then I 
have found them at Carlisle, Aspatria, Maryport, Flimby, St. Bees, 
and Ravenglass.
Nowhere, so far as I know, do they occur at a 
greater altitude than 1200 feet above the sea level.
Another rock equally distinct in character, and also a quartz- 
felsite, occurs on each side of the northern end of St. John's Vale.
Boulders of this rock are found westward down the valley as far as 
Keswick ; and eastward, beyond Troutbeck, on the way to Penrith, 
They also occur in abundance in the Mosedale Valley, on the east 
of Blencathra ; and I have found them at Carlisle, Bullgill, Flimby, 
and St. Bees ; whilst Mr. Goodchild, of the Geological Survey, has 
found them in the Vale of Eden, near Brough.
A rounded boulder 
of this rock found in the gravel-pit at Bullgill Station is about two 
feet six inches in diameter.
154 
On the east side of Carrock Fell there is a mass of granitic- 
looking rock called Hypersthenite.
Fragments of this rock can 
readily be detected wherever they are seen.
They are plentiful in 
the Vale of Caldew north of Linewath, but I have not found any 
to the south of that place.
I have also found them at CarUsle, 
Flimby, St. Bees, Salter Hall, Braystones, and Sellafield.
Around the granite bosses of Skiddaw Forest and the upper 
Caldew there occurs a curious looking rock called Spotted Schist, 
boulders of which occur on every side of the cluster of hills formed 
by Skiddaw, Blencathra, Carrock, and the Caldbeck Fells.
I 
have also found them at Maryport, Flimby, St. Bees, Moresby 
Parks, Ennerdale Bridge, Braystones, and Sellafield.
Another stone of peculiar appearance is the Syenite of 
Buttermere and Ennerdale, than which no rock in the district, 
that can be identified, has given off a larger number of boulders.
They are scattered over the ground everywhere, in fact, from the 
Vale of Lorton to the Bleng, and from the level of the sea shore 
to an altitude of 2000 feet.
On the lower ground they may be 
found all the way from Carlisle on the north, to Millom on the 
south ; and Mr. Goodchild has, I believe, found them on the top 
of Stainmoor, in Yorkshire.
If so, they must have gone round the 
north side of Caldbeck Fells.* Probably also they made their way 
beyond Carlisle through the Tyne Valley to the East Coast.t 
They are also plentiful in Furness.
Another easily recognised rock is the Eskdale Granite, which, 
as its name indicates, occurs about Eskdale.
Boulders of this 
rock are numerous in the Valleys of the Mite and Esk, and south 
wards along the lower ground to Millom, and even into Furness.
On the side of Black Comb, they occur as high as 1000 feet above 
the sea.
Northwards from the mouth of the Mite, I have not 
been able to find any.
From Millom northwards to Carlisle, along the low ground 
between the western and northern hills of the Lake Country and 
* Ennerdale Syenite is common in the drifts all through the Eden Valley 
from Stainmoor to Carlisle.
(Ed.) 
+ Since this was written, I have found St. John's Quartz Felsite and 
Ennerdale Syenite at Haydon Bridge, which is some miles to the east of the 
water-shed of the Tyne valley.
155 
the sea, there occur numerous boulders of a grey granite, which, 
so far as I can make out, is found in situ only about Criffel, in the 
south of Scotland.
Many of these boulders are of considerable 
size, especially north of Maryport ; and some of them are very 
much decomposed, in which state they frequently contain Ver- 
miculite.
We have now obtained an approximate idea of the courses 
taken by some of the boulders of this district whilst being trans 
ported from their native rock, but there is one very important 
point yet to notice.
In examining the boulders in Whicham 
Valley, I found Eskdale and Criifel Granite, Ennerdale Syenite 
and St. Bees Sandstone, as far up the valley as Whicham Hall, 
which is about a mile up from the mouth of the valley.
The icy 
stream by which these boulders were borne must therefore have 
made a right-angled turn round the south end of Black Comb, for 
none of them can have come down the valley, as there is no rock 
of any of the kinds mentioned in that direction.
The boulder 
current has also been deflected in a similar manner up the Vale of 
Duddon, and also towards the head of Ennerdale, for at the south 
end of that Lake there are numerous boulders of St. Bees- and 
Whitehaven Sandstones, Carboniferous Limestone, various Coal 
Measure rocks, and Criffel Granite.
These rocks must have been 
carried round the south end of Kelton Fell, as none of them 
occur in situ farther up the valley, and the nearest of them any- 
where, is from two to three miles away to the westward.
Again, in Cogra Valley there has been a similar movement 
up-hill, for we find boulders of Carboniferous Limestone resting on 
Skiddaw Slate, nearly at the top end of the valley.
Some of the 
boulders are very large, and many of them are severely glaciated.
They occur both in tough boulder clay and directly on the bare 
slate.
Up the sides of the valley I have found them at an altitude 
of I ICO feet.
One, in the mouth of the Wisenholm Valley, at an 
altitude of about eight hundred feet, measures 8^ x 5^ x 4^ and 
would weigh about eleven tons.
There is no rock of this kind in 
situ at an altitude anything approaching this nearer than Caldbeck.
But the most remarkable feature of these boulders is, that they 
156 
must have gone up the valley, that is, in a direction from the low 
ground fringing the sea shore, towards the hill tops, whilst at the 
same time they occur in true till or Boulder Clay.
These facts 
place us on the threshold of a most interesting discussion, but 
time will not allow us to enter.
Mr. James Geike, in his " Great 
Ice Age," has put forward an explanation of the till or lower 
boulder clay, which I think he would find difficult to reconcile 
with these facts; indeed, I am strongly of opinion that they 
disprove his explanation altogether.
A fact of considerable importance in connection with the 
boulders of every kind hitherto mentioned is, that they occur 
indiscriminately in the Upper and Lower Boulder Clays, in the 
middle sands and gravels, and on the surface.
Another somewhat curious fact in connection with the subject 
may be mentioned, and then I have done.
On the Watershed 
between the head of Uldale and Ennerdale, just opposite Enner- 
dale Bridge, and not far from Cockhow, about seven hundred 
feet above the level of the sea, there is an immense accumulation 
of gravel, consisting of Whitehaven- and St. Bees Sandstones, 
Carboniferous Limestone, Syenite, Lavas and Ashes, Skiddaw 
Slates, and several Coal Measure rocks.
The underlying strata 
are Skiddaw Slate, and there is no Carboniferous Limestone, 
St. Bees or Whitehaven Sandstone, or in fact any other Coal 
Measure rock within two or three miles, and there is none at the 
same or a higher level within five miles, that is, on Dean Moor, 
between which place and the gravel deposit under consideration, 
ground several hundred feet lower intervenes.
But the most 
remarkable thing is, that although this gravel has been carried up 
to such a height, and deposited on the hill top, none of it seems 
to have gone over the watershed into Uldale.
I examined the 
upper part of that valley most carefully, but only found a single 
piece of St. Bees Sandstone, and that was so small, and lying in 
such a position, that I prefer to leave it out of consideration, as it 
might very possibly have been conveyed there by human agency.
What makes the absence from Uldale of rocks such as St. Bees- 
and Whitehaven Sandstones still more noticeable is, that there are 
157 
boulders 'of those rocks on the side of Dent, two hundred feet 
above the level of the watershed of the valley that runs through 
between Dent and Kinniside to join Uldale.
The reason of this 
curious disposition of the boulders we cannot now undertake to 
consider, nor can we enter upon the many trains of thought 
suggested by the facts that have been brought forward.
The 
subject of which the distribution of boulders forms a part, has now 
become so much elaborated by the combined efforts of its numerous 
investigators, that I should have to trespass too much on your 
time were I to attempt an explanation of the many facts that have 
just been reviewed.
I prefer therefore to leave them at present 
for each to interpret and correlate for himself On some future 
occasion I hope to return to the subject.

WATER AND AIR: THEIR RELATIONS TO 
HEALTH OR DISEASE.
By WILLIAM H.
WATSON, F.C.S., F.M.S., &c.
(Read at Whitehaven.
) 
In tracing the progress of scientific knowledge, we find that it has 
been very gradual ; that many theories have been advanced which 
the light of future discovery has shown to be incorrect, and that 
in no branch of science is this more noticeable than in regard to 
matters concerning health.
It would be wrong, however, to rashly 
dispute fresh theories, or cast hasty rebukes in the paths of Science; 
but we should first carefully investigate them by experiment and 
reasoning.
There is in scientific matters — as in any other, where from 
apparent uncertainties a difference of opinion may exist — much 
harm done by the expression of ideas without sufficient enquiry, 
and we shall also understand the erroneous impressions which 
those opinions may raise, especially when they emanate from those 
who hold official positions in the particular direction of the 
enquiry.
I have chosen for my remarks to-night the subject of Water 
and Air, and their Relation to Health or Disease, for three reasons : 
first, because the question of water-supply is a favourite one in 
this district at the present time ; second, because I have been 
paying special attention to the question of water and air analysis ; 
and third, it is a matter connected with everyday life; and 
although I may not say it is always an interesting one, yet it is 
certainly one of great importance.
160 
Dr. Lyon Playfair a few years ago, when addressing a meeting 
on Social Science, made a remark which may well be repeated in 
introducing to you this subject.
He said, "Hypocrates was the 
first to write a book on public health, and he took for his text, 
•Pure air, pure water, and a pure soil'; — so that the moderns, 
after an age or more of ignorant neglect of his teachings, have 
arrived at the same essential conditions of health." 
We can scarcely take up a newspaper at present without 
finding much space devoted to the question of water supply ; and 
in the scientific journals we frequently find interesting matters in 
connection with the same subject; so that we may conclude from 
this alone that it is one of general importance, increasing with the 
increase of population, and one which is receiving attention from 
those who are able to comprehend the importance of it.
Again, considering the gigantic schemes for the supply of 
water to Manchester, from Thirlmere ; to Liverpool, from one of 
the Welsh rivers; and, indeed, the question of National Water 
Supply, under the consideration of the Society of Arts, we may at 
least apprehend the fact that expense is of secondary consideration 
to the matter of having a constant supply of wholesome water at 
the command of every inhabitant of our large towns.
AVhile, then, the supply of wholesome water is of public 
importance, it is evidently desirable that the conditions and im- 
purities which render it unwholesome should be more generally 
understood.
We cannot safely act without reason.
It is certain that at the present time we have in almost every 
direction a great deal of theory, but too little practice ; and in 
regard to sanitary matters.
Punch some weeks ago gave a striking 
illustration where a sea-side visitor, who had evidently studied the 
science of health, fully appreciated the delicious aroma of what 
was supposed to be the healthful iodine from the sea, but which 
on enquiry of a well-seasoned resident, was found to be due to the 
"town drains as flowed out just there" !
Certainly the bases of continued health are — pure air and 
pure water; but it is impossible to secure these absolutely — and 
especially the former — by any method of legislation, unless the 
people understand and endeavour, fi-om their own desire, to avoid 
161 
the sources of air and water pollution, which by simple negligence 
may, and no doubt do, frequently exist.
Impure water and air are not only the cause of epidemic 
diseases, but they frequently lay the foundation for those which 
become hereditary.
And with regard to the former (as I wish to 
discuss the question chiefly from a chemical point, being that which 
I have especially studied), it will be easiest for me first, to show 
the substances which, when present in water, are liable to produce 
or to propagate such disease ; and then, by statistics, to trace the 
relation of polluted water to the production of it, so far as has 
been actually proved.
In the first place, then, it may be stated that for several years, 
and especially during very recent years, physiologists and chemists 
have been investigating, not so much the treatment of disease, as 
the more important matters connected with its cause and preven- 
tion.
They have examined the air and water where disease 
existed, with the view of determining what additional substances 
they contained and which were not present in ordinary fresh air and 
water.
Their experiments have been successful in many instances, 
and they have obtained conclusive results which show that many 
diseases are produced or spread in the form of epidemics by living 
particles of an exceedingly minute size; these being often conveyed 
long distances by the media of air and water, and entering the 
living organism, they are rapidly reproduced, and in this way 
seriously influence the ordinary vital functions.
We find the 
action of these germs in the body to be one of fermentation; 
such an action as takes place in the brewing of beer (though, 
unfortunately, the result cannot be so much appreciated) — and it 
is from this fact that certain diseases have been called zymotic.
These diseases may again be classed into at least two diff"erent 
forms, according to the manner in which they are spread.
The 
ordinary fevers may be taken as a class spreading by the germs 
passing directly into the blood through the lungs, or, by contagion, 
through the skin ; while cholera and typhoid fever may be taken 
as examples of another, in which the germs do not act by immediate 
contact with the blood, but by passing through the stomach into 
11 
162 
the intestinal canal.
Hydrophobia may be taken as an example 
of what I wish to express, although, of course, a perfectly distinct 
disease.
A person bitten by a dog suffering from hydrophobia is 
innoculated with the poison by its being directly conveyed to the 
circulation by the bite, and the result would be, in all probability, 
fatal ; but if the same virus had even been swallowed, it would 
have had no effect.
And what do we find ?
When a person is 
bitten in this way, instinct tells him to suck the wound, and it is 
unquestionable that if this could be done immediately, it would 
be a successful antidote, inasmuch as it would remove the poison 
from the circulation, while it would have no effect even if swal- 
lowed.
You will observe, therefore, why it is concluded that certain 
zymotic diseases are chiefly spread by air, while others are spread 
by water, because the germs of the one — the former — act when 
they enter the blood direct, while those of the other act after 
passing through the stomach.
The question of the production of cholera, from its evident 
connection with impure water, has lately engaged the attention of 
chemists and microscopists very much.
I shall endeavour to state 
briefly the conclusions which have been arrived at.
The most 
serious outbreaks occurred in the years 1832, 1849, 1^54, and 
1866, and London in each case suffered; so that the fact may be 
stated by the way, that rivers and wells were the sources of the 
water-supply, and that both were of an inferior character.
The 
conclusions arrived at on the first occasion may be passed over, 
but on the second — in the year 1849 — we find that Dr. Snow 
made an important observation.
He found that the water derived 
from a certain well had in many instances been the immediate 
channel through which the contagion had been conveyed.
This 
was no doubt one of the first matters which brought the relation 
of water to disease prominently forward, and suggested the 
importance of water-analysis ; though the latter cannot be said to 
have been much attended to till later years.
More recently Mr.
Simon, the Medical Officer of the Privy Council, remarking on 
this subject, says, "It is, I believe, a matter of absolute demon- 
163 
stration, that in the old epidemics, when the south-side of London 
suffered so dreadfully from cholera, the great cause of the mortality 
there was the badness of the water distributed in those districts 
of London.
In the interval between the 1849 2.nd the 1854 
epidemics, one of the companies which supply the south side of 
London with water had amended its source of supply ; it had gone 
higher up the river, and we at once lost a great part of the mortality 
on that side of the river.
But it was found that this great difference 
did not prevail uniformly through the south side of London, but 
was confined to those houses which were supplied from the 
amended source.
There was still a great mortality on the south 
side of the river, but this belonged exclusively to the houses which 
were still supplied with impure water." Again, he says, "The 
area of intense cholera in 1866 was almost exactly the area of the 
East London Water-supply." 
During the period between the 1832 and the 1866 epidemics, 
the water-supply of the metropolis underwent important changes; 
and summarising the facts shown by the whole of the epidemics, 
we have figures as in 
Table I.

A very valuable report was made last August by Surgeon- 
Major Townsend, on an epidemic which visited the Central 
Provinces of India in the years 1875 and 1876.
I shall give you 
his conclusions, because they are important in connection with the 
chemistry of the subject.
He discards the theories usually held 
in that country as to atmospheric, fungoid, and miasmatic 
164 
influences, and describes the disease as produced by " a poison 
which is generated in the bodies of those who suffer from the 
disease, but which is capable of living, and probably of multiplying, 
in water containing decomposing organic matter.
Briefly, I may say that this disease (cholera) is now under- 
stood to be generally conveyed by water containing its germs ; 
and although no means are yet known by which these germs — or 
any other disease germs — may be detected, except by their actual 
influence upon persons exposed to them, yet chemistry enables us 
to say when water contains substances which usually accompany 
them, and which assist in their re-production.
This branch of 
chemistry — the analytical examination of potable water — is one 
which has very properly received, and is still receiving, a great 
amount of consideration.
The questions to be asked are — 
(i) What is wholesome Water?
and 
(2) How MAY we know WHEN WATER IS WHOLESOME ?
Pure water, such as we prepare by distilling that which we 
have in abundance around us, is composed of two gases — oxygen 
and hydrogen, chemically combined ; but when we examine such 
water as we have about us in wells or streams, we find it to contain 
other substances in greater or less proportions ; and it is to the 
quantity and character — more especially the character — of these 
additional substances that the purity or otherwise, the suitability 
or otherwise, of the water for domestic use is due.
Thus, by 
analysing a sample of water, and determining the amount and 
character of the additional substances, we obtain a knowledge 
which may enable us to say whether it is suitable for drinking 
purposes or not.
The purest form of natural water is that which falls in the 
country either as snow, hail, or rain ; but as soon as it reaches 
the earth, it begins to dissolve various substances from it, which 
too often, when drunk, are injurious.
The artificial constructions 
of man, so various and so numerous, first render the soil impure, 
and then the soil contaminates the water he has to drink.
The 
water of deep wells is often purified from the surface pollutions by 
the deep strata through which it has passed ; and in this district 
this is often the case.
I have received samples of exceptional 
165 
purity obtained from wells in the high lying country in the 
neighbourhood of Gosforth ; and although shallow wells are at all 
times dangerous as sources of water-supply, yet there are many 
situations in this district where individual houses might be well 
supplied with excellent water by sinking deep wells.
Examining the rain as the source of water-supply, we find it 
differs considerably in regard to its purity in different localities.
Of course, the rain falling in the thick and much-polluted atmo- 
spheres of manufacturing towns is very different from that which 
falls in this district, where almost the only impurity is the spray 
which comes over from the sea, varying in amount according to 
the direction and force of the winds.
Table II.
shows the average impurities in rain-water from 
various districts per 1,000,000 parts as found by Dr. Angus 
Smith.

I shall draw more especial attention to these figures in 
reference to the air, for they show the comparative impurity of the 
air in different localities ; but in examining the rain further, it may 
be interesting to show the considerable difference in the compo- 
sition of the rain in this district at different periods and in different 
situations.
The difference is due chiefly to the varying extent of 
contamination by sea-spray.
Some time ago I constructed gauges 
at different places in order to determine the amount of saline 
matter carried in the air from the sea, and thus conveyed to the 
land.
I found marked differences with only slight alterations of 
situation.

Again, according to the stormy character of the weather, we have

The rain is in every case our primary source of water-supply, 
for whether we collect the water which falls on the roofs of houses, 
or from streams and rivers, or from deep or shallow wells, it is 
only rain more or less contaminated since it has fallen.
Mr. G.
J. 
Symons, F.R.S., who has obtained for several years rainfall statistics 
167 
throughout the British Isles, excepting from the Isle of Man, where 
he says the returns are imperfect,— informed me last year that he 
considered the average annual rainfall of the British Isles to be 
thirty-seven inches.
Now, in the mountainous districts of this 
county, frequently one hundred and sixty inches fall, and we 
consequently possess special advantages for supplying towns with 
water, and our attention has simply to be paid to the best methods 
of collecting it.
One inch of rainfall amounts to 22,622 gallons per acre, 
and, therefore, multiplying 22,622 by 37^^ (the average annual 
ramfall), we have 848,325 gallons of rain per acre annually.
This is a considerable quantity, and if properly collected in country 
villages, would afford a good supply of wholesome water.
The 
question is.
How can this be collected in a pure state ?
Mr. H.
S. Wallis, Mr. Shirley Hibberd, and others, have 
recently suggested the desirability of collecting the rain on the 
roofs of houses as a supply for general domestic and drinking 
purposes; but it is evident that before this suggestion can be 
adopted, additional methods must be used for preventing the 
pollution which at present exists in rain-water collected in this 
manner.
No doubt, however, attention may with advantage be 
given to this question, for the cost of a general supply of water 
from a distant source is heavy on small isolated householders in 
rural districts, and a supply in this way is therefore not agreeably 
accepted.
I believe Mr. Symons discussed this subject in his 
address on "Water Economy" before the Sanitary Institute.
I 
have not yet seen it, but it is published in the pamphlet form by 
Stanford, of Charing- cross.
Although rain-water collected in country districts and pre- 
vented from contamination by decaying vegetable matter, &c.
must beyond doubt be of the highest degree of purity, yet the' taste 
of it is familiar to us as being disagreeably "flat." This is due to 
its being "soft," and not aerated ; but on that account it is not 
injurious, and this fault might be remedied.
Moderately hard water 
is pleasanter to tjae taste, and often quite as wholesome, as soft water, 
so that within certain limits the hardness or softness of a water does 
168 
not determine its value for drinking purposes.
Water, however, 
for the supply of a town should be as soft as possible, care being 
taken that the supply pipes are not made of lead — soft water 
having a solvent action on that metal.
The arguments of certain 
medical authorities as to the necessity of hard water — since by 
using soft water we should loose the salts of lime which go so 
largely to the production of bone — require only to be considered 
to be neglected ; for it is certain that we have in our ordinary 
articles of food a sufficiency of the lime salts in a form well 
adapted for assimilation.
The substances which are especially injurious in water are 
those of an organic nature ; but organic matter varies very much 
in character, and it is therefore necessary to make distinctions.
Some kinds of organic matter are perfectly innocuous, while others 
are poisonous.
The questions of the classification of organic 
matters found in water, the relation of different forms to disease, 
and the accurate determination of the quantity, are therefore very 
important, for they provide the chief data by which we may 
conclude as to the suitability of water for drinking purposes.
If the organic matter is of animal origin, by the use of that 
water we should incur great risk ; but if it is due to peat or other 
vegetable substance of the same nature, we have not much to fear, 
because a little peat in water is perfectly innocuous.
Let us clearly 
understand that the nature of the organic matter must be considered 
before we can say that it is injurious.
In this district much 
discussion has arisen as to the various supplies of water which 
may be obtained for different townships, and the question of 
quality has been several times raised, owing to the presence of a 
little peat in some of the samples sent me for analysis.
It may there- 
fore be interesting here to state that the results of investigations have 
repeatedly shown that peat is not injurious, while, on the other hand, it 
is an antiseptic, and prevents the production of animalculas.
Some 
time ago I read of an instance of the body of a man being found 
in a perfect state of preservation in a wild moor in Scotland, buried 
in peat, and from his dress and other circumstances afterwards 
discovered, it was believed that he had been buried there thirty or 
forty years.
169 
Do not expect to find peaty water when drunk to prolong 
life in a similar wa}' I but I mention this circumstance to show 
that it is an antiseptic, and of a very different nature to putrid 
organic matter, which has especially to be guarded against in 
potable water.
If we wish for soft water from hilly co"untry districts, we must 
be content to have a little organic matter in the form of peat along 
with it, which gives to the water a colour more or less brown, 
according to the quantity present.
The colour is objectionable, 
but this is the worst feature.
Organic matters are capable of being oxidised by certain 
substances which contain oxygen, and based upon this fact we 
have a test which may be applied along with others in the examin- 
ation of potable water.
It cannot be used as a decisive test alone, 
but having obtained results by other methods, this is often useful 
as an additional one.
(Experiments.) 
Water, however pure, when exposed to the air in summer, 
may become more or less contaminated with minute organisms ; 
and if organic matter be also present, it will be, by the influence 
of warmth, subject to putrefaction or fermentation.
Peat is an 
exception.
By the influence of these organisms, the putrefactive changes 
rapidly spread, and the multiplication of the organisms themselves 
is almost inconceivably rapid.
Animal organic matter is characterised by the presence of 
nitrogen, so that we oftentimes find in addition to the free nitrogen 
in absorption in water in the gaseous form from the air, nitrates 
and nitrites, free ammonia, and nitrogen, in combination with the 
elements carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen ; this last class of nitro- 
genous body being well represented by albumen, or the white of 
egg.
In analysing a water, it is necessary to look for these forms 
of nitrogen, and we expect to answer whether the water contains 
nitrogenous organic matter, and whether it is putrid.
It would 
take much time to explain the details of the analytical processes 
which may be adopted, and, indeed, to attempt to do so here 
would be very unnecessary.
Briefly, I may point out, as a general 
ito 
principle, that when nitrogenous organic matters (animal substances 
for instance) decompose, or become putrid, ammonia is formed 
along with other compounds, so that it is simply necessary to 
determine the amount of free ammonia in a sample of water as an 
index of the decayed organic matter, while the nitrogenous, or 
animal, matter, fiot decayed, may be arrived at by decomposing it 
artificially, and then by determining the amount of ammonia which 
it has produced.
Based upon this principle of analysis, the results, as in 
Table III., have been obtained from various samples of water.

Although we see by referring to these analyses, that several 
of the well-waters of this district are superior to the water supplies 
of Scarborough, or even of Glasgow, yet in a few cases the wells 
are situated in places which are not eligible, and which render it 
probable that they may occasionally receive obj ectionable drainage, 
although free from it at the time of the analysis, and it therefore 
follows that it is important to note the positions of the source of a 
sample of water, in addition to the results we obtain at a particular 
time by analysis ; or to analyse the water upon more than one 
occasion, and especially in the summer months.
You will observe that the numbers given for ammonia are 
small, and refer only to " parts in one hundred million parts of 
water," and it will, no doubt, occur to you that the method adopted 
for the determination of ammonia must be very delicate, or that 
the results may in many instances be faulty.
The test for ammonia 
is certainly extremely delicate — one of the most sensitive tests 
which chemists possess.
It is known as Nessler's Test, and we 
are capable of detecting by it exceedingly minute traces of ammonia.
(Experiment made showing the presence of o'ooi part of grain of 
ammonia in 10,000 of water.) 
I shall not now refer to the other processes involved in water- 
analysis, but, in concluding this part of my subject, I may quote a 
remark of Professor Chaumont, of the Army Medical School, 
Netley, as given by him in a paper before the Congress of the 
Sanitary Institute at Croydon last October.
He said, "I consider 
that chemical and microscopical research in the direction of water- 
analysis is of considerable value, but the value has, in my opinion, 
been both over-rated and under-rated.
Thus, it has been over- 
rated when chemists have proposed to lay down certain hard and 
fast lines as to the quantity of constituents considered admissible." 
These words are well worth remembering, especially by those who 
execute rough analyses in their capacities as Medical Officers of 
Health.
It is not sufficient to obtain even accurate results in 
chemistry, without fully considering the circumstances which may 
be the foundation for them, and this is especially the case in 
water-analysis, where the same constituents may be derived from 
various sources.
172 
Although, however, it would be wrong to draw a fast line by 
which we may say how much ammonia (indicating organic matter) 
for instance, shall be present in a water to condemn it as absolutely 
injurious, or as certain to produce disease, yet it is well to act on 
the principle that a suspicious character is to be avoided ; and 
therefore, if the results of our analyses lead us to be suspicious, or 
to conclude that the sample is probably polluted vf'ith.
pernicious 
substances, we shall not be doing wrong if we advise the abandon- 
ment of the use of such water for drinking purposes.
Probably 
we are sometimes unnecessarily suspicious, and this may arise from 
many causes.
We now come to the second part of my subject ; that of 
Air in its Relations to Health or Disease.
I am disposed to think that impure air exists more abundantly 
than impure water ; and considering the nature of the two media, 
may it not be anticipated that more disease is likely to be produced 
by the former than by the latter ?
Into the air, noxious gases and 
minute organisms, resulting from putrefactions, &c., immediately 
pass ; and we know that when the air enters the lungs, the blood 
is directly exposed to it, and that a part of the air (the oxygen) is 
carried by the venous blood to various parts of the body, where it 
meets with impurities due to dissociations caused by the muscular 
action going on in various ways.
With these impurities the oxygen 
combines, and they are thus rendered easy of emission as products 
of respiration, &c.
But during the passage of the air through the 
different parts of the organism, any living organic impurities present 
in it are likely to remain there to exercise their ferment actions, as 
already suggested in the case of impurities in water ; but in this 
case (in the case of air) the impurities by being breathed are at 
once conveyed to the circulation, which is not the fact when we 
drink water.
This, however, is only to be to a certain extent 
considered.
The atmosphere has been well spoken of as a "catholic 
receptacle," and may we not then be led to wonder at its peculiarly 
uniform condition, and its comparative freedom from deleterious 
178 
substances ?
But the atmosphere as a body is self-purifying, and 
it is therefore the object of ventilation to cause the air of inhabited 
rooms to mingle with the outside air, and to return purified.
The atmosphere contains a condensed form of oxygen called 
ozone, and the part which this gas plays in the purification of the 
atmosphere is no doubt very important, owing to its great oxidizing 
properties : thus acting on putrid substances, and destroying their 
putridity.
The air consists chiefly of two gases, oxygen and 
nitrogen — about twenty-one per cent of the former to seventy-nine of 
the latter; and as many of you may be aware of the properties of 
these gases, I will at once proceed to mention the general constitu- 
ents present along with them in minute quantities.
They are — 
Water; Carbonic Acid, about 0*04 per cent.; Ammonia; Ozone; 
Nitrous and Nitric Acids ; Sulphurous and Sulphuric Acids.
We 
have also in the air, in addition to these gaseous substances, various 
solid bodies, which are indeed famiHar to us as seen floating in a 
sunbeam.
They consist of every conceivable form of rubbish, 
including (probably the more important) substances of a fungoid 
nature, or the actual germs of those fungi commonly called mould 
and mildew.
Again, there are sometimes present smaller particles, which, 
by the aid of a beam of light, or even with the assistance of 
powerful lenses, we are unable to see, or, at all events, to distinguish ; 
these may include disease spores or germs, which, passing into 
the blood, arrive at their destination where suitable materials exist 
for their development.
Ozone, already spoken of as a natural element of atmospheric 
purification, and a condensed form of oxygen (oxygen being repre- 
sented by the figure O, while ozone by the figure O2 ), is present 
in the atmosphere, however, in very small quantity.
The best 
country air seldom contains more than one volume in 700,000.
It 
may be prepared artificially by passing electricity through air 
gradually and silently, and it is therefore highly probable that the 
ozone of the atmosphere is produced by continuous silent passages 
of electricity between the clouds and the earth.
Owing to the 
value of the presence of ozone in the atmosphere for the purpose 
174 
of disposing of noxious matters — and from this its relation to 
health generally — the determination of the amount present at 
various times and localities is made an important subject of meteor- 
ological enquiry, and much valuable information has been obtained 
by comparing such determinations with statistics of disease at 
various seasons.
Air is vitiated from three great causes — 
1. Respiration.
2. Putrefaction.
3. Manufactures and Combustion.
The first of these sources of pollution is probably the most 
important.
It is one which must exist, and therefore cannot be 
prevented, but which it is our duty to especially consider, in order 
that its injurious effects may be guarded against.
In each one 
hundred parts of the air we breathe there are, as we have already 
seen, about twenty-one parts of oxygen ; but after it has been 
breathed, the quantity is diminished, and we find in the air expelled 
from the lungs only about fifteen parts, so that six parts of oxygen 
are removed by the process of respiration.
But expired air is not only in this way rendered deficient in 
oxygen, but it contains a correspondingly larger quantity of carbonic 
acid, or what is commonly called "choke-damp;" and in addition 
also to this increase of carbonic acid, there is an increase of the 
amount of organic matter, which is a most serious fact as regards 
health, for it has been shown that while air mixed with even one 
fiftieth of its volume of carbonic acid alone may be breathed, the 
same amount of air mixed with one quarter that amount of carbonic 
acid, but accompanied by the usual organic impuiities resulting 
from respiration, provel much more poisonous.
Dr. Ransome, in a paper read before the Manchester Literary 
and Philosophical Society, on the amount of organic matter in the 
human breath in health and disease, says — " In diseased states of 
the system there is much greater variation in the amount and kind 
of organic matter given off than in health ; " and remarks — " We 
cannot doubt that much of the disease which arises as a conse- 
175 
quence of over-crowding, finds some of its sustenance in the 
impure vapours arising from the lungs and the general surface of 
the body." 
I understand him to mean by this that diseases are not only 
produced by these organic emanations, but that they are sustained, 
encouraged or spread.
In Table IV.
I am able to show the amount of carbonic acid 
in various close places in London, according to Dr. Angus Smith,*

Observing that the amount of carbonic acid in fresh country air 
is not more than 0-04, but generally rather less, and comparing 
the above, we see the differences as regards carbonic acid between 
good country air and that of the London Law Courts and Theatres.
Thus, the air of the Chancery Court contained about five times as 
much as good country air; that of the Strand Theatre, eight ; City 
of London Theatre, over six ; and the Pavillion nearly four.
The organic inatter in expired air bears considerable relation 
to the carbonic acid also present, so that the increase of carbonic 
acid may be taken as showing a corresponding increase in the 
organic matter.
Medical authorities of the highest standing give 
it as their firm opinion that these products of respiration, when

only at the time the observations were made.
(Ed.) 
176 
re-breathed, are the main cause of the high rate of Phthisis ; 
and, in order to be brief, and at the same time expressive, the 
following conclusions from the late Dr. Parkes may be given.
He 
shows that in the badly-ventilated prison of the Leopoldstadt, in 
Vienna, the deaths per looo prisoners were eighty-six, and out of 
these deaths, 5 1 "4 were due to Phthisis ; while, on the other 
hand, in the House of Correction, in the same city, which was 
well-ventilated, the deaths per 1000 were only fourteen, of which 
7 "9 were due to Phthisis.
From this it is evident that 43)^ 
per 1000 were distinctly attributable to bad air.
With regard to what I have grouped as the second source of 
air pollution, namely putrefaction, it may be stated that the results 
of the processes embraced under the comprehensive word of putre- 
faction are gases holding organic substances in suspension, and 
these organic substances are so decidedly distinct from what the 
constituents of the air should be, that when they are well mixed, 
the oxygen or the ozone acts upon them, and converts them 
into inorganic gases.
The more ozone present in the air, the 
more rapidly this beneficial change is effected.
But the organic 
emanations thus arising from putrefaction are not always simply 
dead forms, but frequently they contain living germs, or organised 
bodies, which directly induce disease, which the atmosphere does 
not readily act upon, and actual investigation has shown that 
they are in many cases the actual nuclei of fresh cases of 
disease.
The ordinary putrefaction impurities in the atmosphere are 
supposed to be the frequent promoters of disease of the respiratory 
organs, in addition to typhoid and other fevers ; and on looking 
at the statistics of this class of disease throughout the United 
Kingdom, we find that country or agricultural districts are by no 
means exempt from them, and it is a matter of general observation 
that in this particular district the cases of Phthisis, or Consumption, 
are comparatively high.
Probably the breathing of air contamin- 
ated with the results of putrefactive changes may be to some extent 
a cause for this.
Of course the atmosphere, ever fresh and changing in these 
177 
districts, where the results of the conglomeration of people do not 
exist, must be of typical purity ; but we find this is not a correct 
representation of the air surrounding many farmsteads.
On the 
other hand, it is almost invariably contaminated with gaseous and 
solid bodies in small quantity resulting from the decay of organic 
substances.
I have recently been engaged on some experiments in connec- 
tion with this subject.
The object has been to determine the 
relative tendency of the air in different situations to induce 
fermentation.
I have exposed certain chemical solutions capable of under- 
going fermentation near to several farmsteads, and have found 
them to ferment more rapidly there than in the open country ; 
thus proving that the air of those places contains bodies which act 
as ferments.
I am hoping, therefore, to continue these experiments 
further, and to obtain comparable results, so that the process may 
be a new and more effectual method of examining the air as a 
guide in sanitary matters.
In the evidence given before a Committee of the House of 
Commons on the Scheme for the Supply of Water to Manchester 
from Thirlmere, it was shown that in the Vale of St. John's, near 
Keswick, a very high rate of mortality — in proportion to the number 
of inhabitants — exists there from Consumption ; and, although I 
believe no special reason was suggested for this, yet it is probable 
that the emanations from undrained and boggy lands in the 
immediate neighbourhood may be the cause, for minute organisms 
no doubt originate from these conditions, and pollute the sur- 
rounding air.
And now, as to the third, and what we will consider the last, 
source of air pollution, — that due to Manufactures and to Combus- 
tion.
We have here at least two distinct contaminations : one in 
the form of black smoke, which we see and often remark upon ; 
the other which we do not see, and which is therefore frequently 
never contemplated.
Black smoke acts injuriously in two ways ; one is by charging 
the air with small solid particles of carbon, which are then breathed 
12 
178 
into the lungs, and which, no doubt, cause irritation there ; the 
other is by lessening the amount of daylight.
It not only diminishes 
the allotted proportion of sunshine, but it interferes with the quality 
to no less degree than with the quantity of the light we receive.
Objects seen through an atmosphere thus polluted, appear of an 
unnatural yellowish colour, because the light by passing through 
the yellow smoke, is deprived to some extent of the blue and 
violet rays which constitute the most refrangible portion of the 
spectrum ; while the yellow, orange, and red rays, being less re- 
frangible, are able to pass through ; and it happens also that those 
rays which are cast off are those which are of most value in the 
promotion of healthy living action.
Light certainly is not life, 
but it is very essential to it ; and I remember seeing somewhere 
an account of some very interesting observations, showing the 
relative amount of cures in the two sides of a hospital — one 
receiving the sunshine, the other shaded.
There was a very 
marked difference, and the light side was by far the most successful.
Passing from the black smoke to the contamination of the air 
by invisible gases resulting from the burning of coal, we come to 
perhaps the most serious matter in connection with air pollution 
in towns from artificial causes, since chemical works are now 
under inspection, and do not therefore allow so much refuse to 
escape into the air as previously, and also because this pollution is 
very general, each chimney contributing its share.
Most coals contain sulphur, and they consequently produce 
sulphur acids when burnt.
If we take the average amount of 
sulphur in coal at one per cent.
— although this is in reality not so 
high as the true average — we should produce, by burning a ton of 
such coal, about forty-four pounds of sulphurous acid ; and this 
forty-four pounds of sulphurous acid, by passing into the air and 
coming in contact with the aqueous vapour contained in the 
atmosphere, would be gradually changed to about fifty-five pounds 
of dry sulphuric acid, or seventy pounds of strong oil of vitriol.
This we observe is from one ton of coal ; and if we consider that 
many establishments consume even as much as twenty tons daily — 
and there are dozens of these establishments in many towns — we 
179 
shall at once notice that the sulphuric acid given off from the 
combustion of coal is exceedingly large.
Dr. Angus Smith, in his Eighth Report under the Alkali Act, 
gives some very important results of his investigations of emanations 
from chemical works.
He shows the total escape of sulphur acids 
(calculated as sulphuric acid) from twenty-five chemical works.
In some instances there was no escape of these acids ; but the 
average loss of sulphur from the twenty-three works was rather 
over seven-and-a-half per cent on the total quantity burnt ; and in 
four of the works, the loss was actually more than twenty per cent.; 
in one case it amounted to one hundred and fifty-nine pounds of 
sulphuric acid per hour.
Probably since then there may have 
been some improvement ; but, unfortunately, it pays the manu- 
facturers better to allow a large escape, and to work rapidly, than 
to have the necessary large chambers, and to condense the whole 
of the gases.
Again, the burning of coal gas in dwelling rooms vitiates the 
air very much, both by the sulphur acids and the ordinary products 
of combustion ; because, although many towns — but by far from 
all — purify their gas very well, yet, unfortunately, the sulphur 
cannot by any practicable means be removed, and the consumers 
have to suffer from its effects.
In addition to the injurious action which these sulphur acids 
have on animal life, they kill the trees and other vegetation for 
miles round, which, apart from their value in purifying the atmos- 
phere, convey that natural beauty to the scenery which we especially 
enjoy, and which must therefore be conducive to health.
Conversely, 
the growing of trees in towns would be an easy matter if the escape 
of the sulphur compounds were prevented.
It is evident that the 
inhabitants of towns — and especially of crowded towns, where no 
space is allowed for vegetation — however well their dwellings may 
be ventilated, are subject to much air-pollution, and it is therefore 
desirable that greater attention should be paid, not only to the 
consuming of the black smoke, but more especially to preventing 
the escape of the invisible products of combustion and waste 
chemical manufactures.
180 
At present we find the centres of our large towns at night 
practically unpopulated, only those remaining in them who cannot 
afford to migrate into the suburban districts ; and thus we have an 
especial instance where wealth necessarily contributes to health.
I have endeavoured to place before you some of the chief 
points in connection with this great and important subject of water 
and air, and have confined my remarks chiefly to those matters 
which have either been proved by chemical research, or which 
appear conclusive from reliable statistics.
Science is at present receiving especial attention, and 
important results will be obtained.
All its branches, if we 
were able to see their terminations, would be found in human 
happiness and success.
Some appear more immediately con- 
nected than others ; and if the remarks which I have submitted 
have been uninteresting, I have the satisfaction, or dissatisfaction, 
of knowing that the subject is one of importance, and has only 
failed to appear so by my inability to place it before you in a 
more striking manner.
Health, Temperance, and Morality may be classed together, 
and their accomplishment aided by the application of a knowledge 
of Chemistry and Physiology to domestic matters.

THE MARYPORT CAMP : 
ITS HISTORY, ITS EXPLORATIONS, AND ITS 
PRESENT ASPECT.
By J.
B. BAILEY.
(Read at Maryport, May ifth, 1880.^ 
That there has been a Camp, no one will be disposed to deny.
Strong naturally, on the summit of a hill, with steep cliffs bordering 
the sea coast on the west, together with a rapid descent to the river 
on the east and south sides — it was made doubly so by the hand 
of the engineer.
It would appear to have comprised an inner 
vallum surmounted by a strong wall, and defended by a ditch ; 
the two lower courses of the wall being still visible near the 
northern gateway.
Beyond this there was probably a second 
vallum, with its attendant ditch.
The length of the camp is one hundred and forty yards, and 
its breadth one hundred and thirty yards, enclosing an area of 
nearly four acres.
There were four gateways, all of which are easily traceable, 
that on the north being the most prominent.
This gateway was 
uncovered in 1787, and the entire arch was discovered shortly 
after.
In the absence of Colonel Senhouse, it was unfortunately 
destroyed for wall building.
Evidently it had been a very elegant 
structure, and, seeing that that side of the camp is the one least 
protected by nature, there may have been a tower at the angle 
serving the purpose of a guard-room, etc.
The stones of the 
archway were "shaped and dressed, being made to fit close without 
182 
cement, there being iron stanchions at the end of the comer 
stones."* The ruts made by the chariot wheels are plainly visible.
In the N.E. corner of the camp, an elegant bath was discovered 
in 1788.
It was sixteen feet long, and was surrounded, in all 
probability, by a paved walk two feet wide.
Near the centre of 
the camp is a well, having a diameter of three feet, and encased 
with masonry.
Some years ago the rubbish it contained was 
cleared out, and it was found to be of great depth.
Unfortunately, 
it has again become filled with rubbish, and the upper courses of 
stones displaced.
In the field to the south of the camp is an eminence now 
called "Pudding Pie-Hill" (Pudding Pye-Hill in 1742), but more 
anciently, "The King's Burying Place," from its being the reputed 
burial place of some Celtic king or leader.
So far as this latter 
idea is concerned, the result of excavations made in 1742 has not 
confirmed the tradition.
It is undoubtedly artificial, but neither 
coins, urns, nor remains of any kind were found, save the bones of 
a heifer and of a colt, together with a few wood ashes.
These 
were covered with a layer of turf set edgeways, and about two feet 
thick.
This, in turn, was covered by several layers of red and blue 
clay, together with a kind of hard red cement, the whole being 
covered with a layer of earth.
It may be worth the mention that 
the soil was cleared away to some considerable depth below where 
the remains were found.
But around the camp, on all sides, sprang up a town ; and, if 
we may judge from the number of altars and other antiquities dis- 
covered here, it must have been a town of no mean dimensions.
Camden, speaking in 1599 of the excavations that had then been 
made, says, "Old vaults are opened, and several altars, inscriptions, 
and statues are dug up, all of which that worthy gentleman, Mr. J_ 
Senhouse (in whose fields they are dug up) keeps very religiously, 
and has placed them regularly in the walls of his house" — whilst 
Hutchinson, in 1794, gives a list of one hundred and sixteen 
articles found here ; and this list is still incomplete, the excavations 
now being carried on (1880) almost daily adding to it.
Of the

183 
earlier excavations, in 1743 "foundations of houses, showing the 
cement still strong, also plaster, and paint of a pinkish colour, were 
discovered."* 
In 1766, "the streets were found to be paved with broad 
flagstones, much worn by use;" whilst the steps into a vaulted 
room, previously opened about 1686, were particularly well worn.
This was probably the temple of the Deae Matres, who are repre- 
sented by a small sculptured slab still in the portico at Netherhall.
Roofing slates were found in abundance, and still may be picked 
up in great quantities — several of them having the original iron 
pegs still in them.
Besides these, "pottery, glass vessels, and 
even mirrors were discovered ;" also "evident marks of the houses 
having been more than once burnt down and then rebuilt, "t In 
addition, at different times have been discovered broken altars, 
altars wanting inscriptions, fibulae, glass, iron, and bronze articles ; 
tiles (one with Coh. i, Hispa Inducius fecit on it), Samian and 
Durobrian ware; whilst of coarser ware we have specimens of 
amphorae and mortaria.
To these may be added querns and 
mill-stones; in short, as Horsley remarks in 1732, "a perfect 
magazine of antiquities " is to be seen here.
We cannot, however, pass on to another subject without 
alluding to the discoveries of 1880, for which we are mainly 
indebted to a member of our local Association — Mr. Joseph 
Robinson.
These include a Legionary stone (20th Legion), an 
altar by G.
Caballius Priscus — Tribune (ist Cohort Spaniards), a 
second altar with the inscription apparently ploughed off; pottery, 
funeral urns, tiles, roofing slates, coins ; foundations — believed to 
have been those of a temple — forty-six feet by twenty-five feet ; 
also of a round building some twenty feet from the temple, and 
having a diameter of thirty-four feet, the walls being two feet thick.
To these must be added two heads, together with a female figure 
supposed to have been one of the Deae Matres.
Besides which, 
a section of the road, twenty-one feet wide, was laid bare, as also 
a drain ; and lastly — though not the least important — a pillar with 
* Hutchinson's Cumberland, Vol. II., p.
282.

184 
a human face on one side, and a serpent on the other, was dis- 
covered.* 
The importance of the station, as shown by the "magazine of 
antiquities," and its commanding position, would ahnost lead us 
to the idea that it was one of the Notitia stations, and accordingly 
both the German and EngUsh scholars are now agreed that the 
altars found prove it to be Axelodunum.t 
Several roads have run from the Maryport Camp, placing it 
in easy communication with the various stations both on the coast 
and in the interior.
The first of these passed out of the Northern Gateway, crossed 
the four fields to the N.E. of the camp, and then diverged to the 
right, crossing the " Bank End Lane" near the plantation, and 
shortly after the turnpike road, thence running some distance to 
the E.
of the cemetery ; thence midway between Crosby and 
Crosscanonby, past AUerby, and so on to Old Carlisle and 
CarUsle (Luguvallium).
The width of this road, from sections laid 
bare, was about twenty-one feet.
The second road left the eastern gateway, ran across the 
Netherhall park, crossed the Ellen (the slab with the name Rianorix 
on it being discovered near the ford), thence through the southern 
end of the plantation near the railway, and so on by the obelisks 
near Hayborough, past Dovenby and Papcastle to Keswick, 
Ambleside to Chester (Deva), and so to Mediolanum.
Coins of 
Claudius, Trajan, Faustina, Hadrian, and Geta have been found 
at Papcastle.
The portion of the road from Maryport to Papcastle was 
surveyed by F.
L. B.
Dykes, Esq., of Dovenby Hall, and the 
results communicated in a paper read by Dr. Bruce at Maryport 
on July 7th, 1870.I 
The third road ran along the coast by way of AUonby,

Beckfoot, and Skinburness, to Bowness.
The whereabouts of this 
road had almost passsed into obUvion, although hinted at by 
Hutchinson in 1794.
However, its existence has now been put 
beyond doubt, and the site of a camp has been discovered at 
Beckfoot by Mr. Robinson, before mentioned, who has also rescued 
the stone named by Hutchinson as having been found here, and 
inscribed LIA PRAEF.

H PANNON FECIT.
The fourth road ran by the Mote Hill, evidently to Moresby, 
and appears to have been in part protected by a wall of which 
Camden says, " Ruins still remain at the mouth of the Elne or 
Elen." Its date is quite uncertain, although it has been ascribed 
to Stilicho, in the reign of Honorius.
It has, however, evidently 
been of a much earlier date than this.
As to the exact date of the foundation of the Camp, 
there is no positive evidence ; but in all probability it was 
constructed by Agricola or one of his officers.
Should this be 
thought too early, the fact of four altars dedicated by Marcus 
Msenius Agrippa — who was a personal friend of Hadrian — having 
been found, shows conclusively that there was a Camp about 120.
There is also little positive evidence as to how long it remained 
in the hands of the Romans.
Still, if it be Axelodunum, the 
Notitia bears witness to its being held to the very end of the 
occupation.
Besides, its position gave it such peculiar advantages 
as would render its possession a necessity.
But if it be, then, 
if the evidence of coins be conclusive, we can safely affirm that 
it was one of the last of the stations left by the Romans ; and 
further, that it had been almost continuously held during the 
whole of the Roman occupation, as coins have been found 
covering the whole period down to the reign of Honorius — 
unless, indeed, it be between the years 191 and 244.
Before concluding, a few remarks may be made on the Altars.
It is to be noted (i) that they are in some cases dedicated by 
the officers, in others by the cohorts ; thus, the Spaniards dedicated 
sixteen altars (although there are but six officers mentioned), the 
Baetasians five, and the Dalmatians three altars and two slabs.* 
* Since writing the above, another altar was discovered on April 28th, 1880.
186 
(2) That either directly or indirectly, several are dedicated by 
the same person ; thus, C.
C. Priscus has four, Acilianus two with 
two slabs, L.
C. Maximus has three, T.
A. Tutor three, Helstrius 
Novellus two, and Ulpius Titianus two, M.
M. Agrippa four.
(3) They also inform us the native homes of several of the 
officers, e.g., G.
C. Peregrinus came from Mauritania Csesariensis 
(Morocco), M.
Censorius from Nimes in Gaul, and L.
A. Verianus 
from Sicca in Africa.
(4) That the garrison has consisted of legionaries, the first 
cohorts of the Spaniards, Dalmatians, and Baetasians, with one of 
Mauritanians (?) ; also volunteers ; and included both foot and 
horse cohorts, the commanders of the latter being Lucius Cammius 
Maximus and Lucius Antistius Verianus.
(5) They give the names of the officers of the various cohorts; 
also (6) the religion of the soldiers.
Thus twenty altars are dedi- 
cated to Jupiter, in three cases the Emperor being deified along 
with Jupiter ; two are dedicated to Mars, and three to Victory.
In two, Rome itself is deified; whilst the local deities are 
represented by Belatucadrus, Setlocenia, and the Genius of the 
Place.
In point of rarity, these altars stand out pre-eminently.
Those 
by the Bsetasians are rare — that to Vulcan is probably the only one 
found in Britain ; the one by Lucius Cammius Maximus, of the 
1 8th Cohort of Volunteers, appears to be unique; whilst those to 
Mars add miliiari, as though Mars was not suggestive enough.
Taking the fact of the interment of the altars them- 
selves, it is clear that all those discovered in 1870 were buried 
at one time, as they were found arranged, not here one and 
there one, but in a series of pits round a common centre, 
the diameter of the space being some twenty yards.
Together 
with this, it is to be observed that the altars found in 1870 
include every name on either Spanish, Dalmatian, or Bsetasian 
altars found previous to that date, with one exception ; so that 
they too may have been buried at the same time and in the same 
place, since several pits opened in 1870 were found empty.
The 
date of such interment is difficult to fix, nay, probably impossible.
187 
Still, when it is known that a time of great unquiet prevailed 
among the tribes to the north of the wall towards the end of the 
Second Century, and that Maryport had evidently felt the effects of 
reverses, it having been more than once burnt to the ground and 
then rebuilt, it seems probable we shall not be far wrong in fixing 
A.D. 194, or thereabouts, as the approximate date, for, as I take 
it, the altars must have been buried before the burning of the place.
Two facts seem to point to the probable correctness of this date : 
I J/— The altars found in 1870 are in a remarkably good state of 
preservation, especially those by the Bsetasians; which latter, 
indeed, show so little signs of weathering as to lead us to suppose 
that they had been placed in situ at no great length of time after 
their dedication.
2nd—K reference to the coins will show a break 
of some fifty years, viz., between the reigns of Pertinax and Philip, 
i.e., about A.D. 191—244; whilst both before and after this 
apparent break, the list of coins appears in an almost unbroken 
order.

THE MOTHS OF THE DISTRICT.
By GEORGE DAWSON.
(Read at Carlisle.) 
In continuation of my paper on Local Entomology already laid 
before this Society, I now give the first of a series on the Moths I 
have taken in this neighbourhood.
The first division, or 
NOCTURNI, 
is represented in Britain by thirteen Families, of which the first on 
the list is 
The SPHINGID/E.
The Eyed Hawk-Moth {Smeri?ithus ocellatus.) 
The Poplar Hawk-Moth {Stnerinthus popiili.) 
Both of these insects are very common in this locality.
I 
have found their larvae on the willow bushes along the banks of all 
the rivers around Carlisle.
The larva of the Eyed Hawk-Moth may be found in the 
autumn.
It changes to a large, reddish-brown, bright-looking 
pupa, and the moth emerges about the end of May. The larva 
of the Poplar Hawk-Moth feeds on the Willow, the Poplar, and the 
Apple, and it changes to pupa sometime between July and Sep- 
tember.
The pupa is rather rough and dirty-looking; never 
having that bright, shining appearance characteristic of the 
192 
pupse of most other Lepidoptera.
The moth is on the wing 
generally in May.
The Death's-Head Hawk-Moth {Acherontia atropos).
This, the largest of all our moths, is not uncommon around 
Carlisle.
At different times I have obtained both larvae and pupse, 
but have never succeeded in rearmg them.
The Convolvulus Hawk-Moth (Sphinx convolvuli).
This very fine insect is found every season in this locaUty.
It has a very long trunk ; one I measured was five inches and a 
half in length.
The Bedstraw Hawk-Moth {Deilephila galli).
This is a very rare insect here.
I took one on a wall in the 
London and North Western Goods Station, and another at rest on 
the West Walls.
It occurs here in June and July.
The Silver-striped Hawk-Moth {Chcerocampa celerio).
The only specimen of this insect I have seen here I took at 
Dalston Hall, on some palings.
It may have come here amongst 
the logwood used at the works at Dalston.
The Small Elephant Hawk-Moth ( Choerocampa porcellus).
The Elephant Hawk-Moth {Ckosrocampa elpenor).
Both of these moths are common here in June and July.
I 
have taken them at Orton, at Newby Cross, and Hen Moss ; and 
they are commonly found on the sand hills at Silloth.
They can 
be taken with the net at night when they are flying about the 
flowers of the Ragged Robin.
These two moths are very much 
like each other in colour and in markings ; but the Elephant 
Hawk-Moth is larger than the other.
The larva feeds on the 
Willow Herb in August and September.
The HuMMiNG-BiRD Hawk-Moth {Macroglossa stellatarum).
This moth is commonly found every summer about Carlisle.
I have seen them in the gardens at Edentown, at Botcherby, at 
Morton, and at Bellevue.
1 
193 
The Bee Hawk-Moth {Macroglossa bombyliformis).
I have taken this moth at Durdar, Newbiggin, Newby Cross, 
Orton, Kingmoor, Thrustonfield, and various other places.
The 
moth is fond of settling on the flowers of the Bugle.
It is difificult 
to take them with the net, unless one is sitting near a patch of the 
food-plant at the time the insect settles ; the net must then be 
placed over the moth, and be held firmly down to the ground 
until the moth rises.
It is quite a Northern insect.
The SESIDM.
The Currant Clear-Wing (Sesia tipuliformis).
The Hornet Clear-Wing of the Osier {Sesia bembiciformis).
The Hornet Clear-Wing of the Poplar (Sesia apiformis).
These can be found only on bright sunny days.
The larvae 
feed on the pith and the solid wood of the plants they respectively 
take their name from.
The Goat Moth {Cosstis ligniperda).
This beautiful moth is found all over our county.
It takes 
its name from the strange smell that the larva has.
This moth is 
on the wing in July and August.
The larva feeds on the solid 
wood of the Oak, the Elm, the Willow, and the Apple.
It is 
common in the Newbiggin Woods, and there is a large tree at 
Carleton that has many in it.
The HEPIALIDM.
The next Family, the Swifts, contains but five British species, 
all found in this locality.
They are called Swifts from the rapidity 
of their flight.
They have very short antennae, and their under 
wings very much directed backwards.
The Gold Swift {Hepialus hedus).
The Common Swift {Hepiahts lupuUmis).
The Wood Swift {Hepialus sylvinus).
The Northern Swift {Hepialus veleda).
The Ghost Swift {Hepialus humuli).
13 
194 
I have taken these at Kingnioor, Orton, and at Newby Cross.
The larvae live through the Winter, feeding on the roots of various 
plants ; and they change to pupae in the Spring.
The moths are 
on the wing from May till the end of August.
The PROCRID^.
The Green Forester {Procris statices).
The Scarce Forester {Procris globularice).
Except that P.
statices has somewhat thicker antennae than the 
other species, these two moths are very much alike.
In both 
species the upper wings are of a beautiful shining green, and they 
are rather transparent.
Both moths are on the wing in June and 
July ; and they occur often in great numbers near Wreay Station 
and at Orton.
Both species may usually be found together.
The ZYG^NID^.
The Six-spotted Burnet {Zygcena filipendula).
This moth is found at Orton and at Wreay.
The larvae feed 
on the Crowfoot Trefoil.* When full grown, the larva crawls up 
the grass stalks, spins a sharp-pointed yellow cocoon, and changes 
to a stout black pupa.
The moth is on the wing in June.
The NOLIDM.
The four species of this family all occur in this locality.
I 
have found them sitting on the trunks of trees, and on stone walls.
Some I have taken with the net.
They are all very much alike in 
appearance.
The Short-cloaked Moth {Nola cucullatella).
The Least Black Arches {Nola cristulalis).
The Small Black Arches {Nola strigula.) 
The Scarce Black Arches {Nola centonalis).
I have taken these moths at Kingmoor, at Orton, at Newby 
Cross, and at Newbiggin Woods.
They are on the wing from the 
end of May till the end of July.

The LITHOSIIDM.
Of the seventeen British species of this family, I have found 
only four in this district.
The Round-winged Muslin {Nudaria senex).
I have found a few of these at Newbiggin ; always resting on 
the sides of the old quarries, or on the stone walls, about the end 
of July.
The Four-dotted Footman {Lithosia mesomella).
This very delicate and easily-damaged moth I have taken at 
Todhills, Kingmoor, Houghton, Newby Cross, and Orton.
They 
are fond of boggy ground, and are on the wing from the early part 
of June to the middle of August.
The Four-spotted Footman {Lithosia quadra).
Of the two specimens of this species I have seen that were 
taken here, one was taken by Mr. John Routledge, and the other 
— a female — by myself, both at Newby Cross, about the end of 
July.
The Red-necked Footman {Lithosia rttbricollis).
I have found, a few of this species at Orton and at Newby 
Cross ; I have also taken them at Durdar.
They are on the wing 
in June and July.
The EUCHELIID^.
The Cinnabar {Euchelia /acobace).
This moth is on the wing in June ; and the larva, which feeds 
on the Common Ragwort, may be found in July and August.
The CHELONIIDjE.
The Clouded Buff {Euthemonia russula).
This moth is common at Todhills, Harker, Kingmoor, Orton, 
Newby Cross, and Newbiggin, in June and July.
196 
The Wood Tiger ( Chelonia plantaginis).
The Common Tiger {Chelonia cajd).
The Ruby Tiger {Arctia fuliginosa).
The larvae of these moths live over the Winter, and may be 
found in early Spring, when they come out of their winter home 
and feed for a few weeks, and then change to pupae.
I have 
found them at Orton and at Newby Cross.
The Buff Ermine {Arctia hibricipeda).
The White Ermine {Anita menthastri).
Both these moths are very common.
They may be found in 
early morning sitting on the hedgerows drying their wings.
They 
are not uncommon at night on the gas-lamps around Stanwix, and 
in the Warwick Road.
The larvae feed on the Common Dock 
and the Nettle.
In August and September they spin very loose 
cocoons on the ground, and then change to pupae.
The moth is 
on the wing in May and June.
The LIPARIDM.
The Dark Tussock ( Orgyia fascelina ).
The upper wings are of a grayish colour, much waved with 
dark brown, and are sprinkled with small reddish-coloured spots, 
that soon fade after the moth is dead.
The larva is found in May, 
and is very prettily marked.
It is pale blue, with orange-coloured 
spots, and it has four large tufts of hair, of different colours, along 
the back, and they have a white line along each side.
It feeds on 
Birch, Willow, and Hazel, I have found them very commonly at 
Orton, and have taken them also at Newby Cross and at King- 
moor.
The Common Vapourer {Orgyia Antiqua).
This is a very common moth here.
The female is without 
wings, and is covered with silky down.
The larva is very variables 
in colour, and it feeds on Willow, Birch, Hawthorn, Bramble,j 
Apple, Plum, Cherry, and many other plants, 
197 
The BOMBYCIDuE.
The Fox Moth {Boinbyx rubi).
This is very common on heathy ground in every locality 
where I have collected.
The moth is on the wing in June and 
July.
The larva lives through the winter, and changes to pupa 
about the end of April.
The Oak Eggar {Bombyx quercus).
The larva feeds on Hawthorn, Birch, Willow, and on many 
other plants.
This moth is on the wing in the sunshine ; I have 
never seen the female flying, although I have taken many of them 
They are common at Orton and at Newby Cross from about the 
end of June until the middle of August.
The Drinker {Odonestis potatoria).
The larva is very like that of the Oak Eggar.
It feeds on 
grass, and it spins a yellow cocoon, pointed at both ends.
The 
moth is on the wing in July and August.
The Emperor Moth {Satuniia carpini).
The larva feeds on Heath, Willow, Birch, and Hawthorn.
It is full grown about the end of August, when it spins a light- 
coloured cocoon, shaped like a pear, where it passes the winter.
The moth is on the wing from the end of April until the middle of 
August.
The male is on the wing in the day-time.
The female I 
have never seen on the wing, although I have found many at rest.
They are common at Todhills, Houghton, Kingmoor, Newby 
Cross, and Orton.

THE CHARACTER AND DISTRIBUTION OF 
THE DIATOMACE^.
By B.
TAYLOR.
(Read at Whitehaven.) 
The Diatomaceae consist of a large tribe of one-celled organisms, 
found in greatest abundance during the first and last three months 
of the year.
They are met with abundantly in the shallower parts 
of fresh, salt, and brackish water.
They grow on mud, stones, 
sea-weed, shells, zoophytes, submerged timber in tidal harbours, 
and on the bottonis of vessels that have been long afloat.
They 
may also be obtained just now (September) in boggy ground, and 
on the various mosses that clothe rocky cliffs and brows down 
which water trickles.
As examples of some of these habitats, I 
may refer to the mud of our Harbour, which a few weeks ago was 
thickly covered with great numbers of Pleurosigma angulatum, 
Surerella gemtno, P.
cesurii, and Stauroiteis salina.
On the Rifle- 
range, in the corner of the angle formed by the rocks and the 
target bank, is a small piece of boggy ground where they may be 
obtained in enormous quantities.
Another locality rich in diatoms 
is the short piece of dripping rock that skirts the New Road a 
few yards beyond the Wheelbarrow Brow.
The Diatomaceae owe their name to the readiness with which 
those members of the class which grow m filaments, or aggregated 
masses, break up on the slightest touch.
Their common English 
name, Brittlewort, is also equally expressive and descriptive of the 
same property.
This quality of brittleness is owing to the presence 
200 
of Silex, of which their external structure is in great measure 
composed.
The occurrence of this mineral in plants is not confined 
to the Diatomacese, but is found in greater or less quantity in many- 
other plants, especially in the Equisetacese and the grasses.
But its 
presence in great quantities in this group constitutes one of its 
most distinctive peculiarities.
The cell, or frustule, as the individual diatom is called, is 
composed of two symmetrical, more or less convex, siliceous 
valves, or plates, connected with each other at the edges.
They 
have not inaptly been compared to bivalve shells — the mussel, for 
instance.
Interposed between these valves, and connecting their 
edges, there generally exists a third segment, forming a band or 
zone, and called the cingulum, or raphe.
A common pill-box 
affords an excellent illustration of the general arrangement of these 
parts in the diatom, which is really a microscopic box of surpassing 
beauty.
The lid and the bottom of the box correspond to the 
valves in the diatom ; and the cylinder that intervenes between 
the upper and the lower discs of the apothecary's casket is the 
exact counterpart of the connecting membrane of the diatom.
The hoop, or raphe, is of the same material as the shells it unites 
together, and it plays an important part while the diatom is under- 
going subdivision.
Attached to, and lining the interior surface of 
the siliceous shell, is a membrane of great delicacy, composed of a 
substance called cellulose, and known as the primodial utrical.
Within the cavity formed by this membrane and the siliceous 
exterior, is contained a soft mucilaginous substance.
At certain seasons, or under special conditions of the diatom, 
a number of granules or globules make their appearance in this 
contained material.
These, from their refractive nature, and 
behaviour under re-agents, appear to be of an oily character.
The 
endochrome, as the cell-contents are called, is sometimes of a 
bright green ; in a few species, more generally it is of a chocolate- 
brown colour.
This colour is due to the iron present in its 
substance.
When the diatoms occur in considerable quantities 
— which they frequently do in slowly-running streams — the colour 
they impart to the surface they cover, enables the unaided vision 
201 
to detect their presence at once.
In some three or four species, 
Mr. Thwaites and Professor Smith are reported to have seen the 
contained granules in active motion.
I have never been able to 
detect this action in the species named by these gentlemen ; but 
I have been fortunate enough to witness it in two other species I 
gathered in this neighbourhood.* 
In the size and shape of the diatom frustule there is an almost 
infinite diversity.
Not a few are very narrow, and much elong- 
ated (as Synedra, etc.), and, from presenting a wand-like figure, 
suggested to Ehrenberg the name of Bacillaria to designate the 
family.
Some, again, are triangular ( Triceriatutn), or square 
( Ampheteteras ), or oblong (Terpsence).
Others, again, grow in 
filaments, and, when separated, present the appearance of tiny 
pill-boxes and globes, owing to the convexity of their valves 
( Melosira).
Several genera are boat-shaped ( Navicida ), some are 
oval (Surerella).
Many — and these the most beautiful — are 
flattened discs ( Cocinodisais, Heleopelta, Arachnodiscus ); while not 
a few are wedge-shaped ( Licmophera).
Some are curved and 
twisted upon themselves, and others assume a sigmoid form 
(Fleurosigma), or an undulated form (as Sytnatapleura ).
A con- 
siderable number of species are arcuate (EunoliaJ, saddle-shaped 
( Campylodiscus ), and one genus has every species shaped like 
plugs ( Gomphonema ).
Nor are the conditions under which the Diatomacese are 
found to exist much less diversified than their form.
For con- 
venience of classification, however, they have been represented as 
existing under four general conditions, viz : — 
ist.
Free; the frustule having undergone perfect, or entire, 
subdivision, are found in a free or unconnected state (Navicula).
2nd, Stipitate ; the frustules being implanted on a common 
stem, which keeps them in mutual connection after they themselves 
* The first time I saw the action was in some specimens of Pinularia 
viridis (Smith) obtained on the Rifle-range, near Whitehaven, in December, 
1876.
The other instance was furnished by some specimens of Fleurosigma 
aiigulatuin (Smith) collected in the Harbour the following autumn.
— Science 
Gossip, Vol. IV.
202 
have undergone a complete subdivision ( Cocconema, Achnanthes, 
Flabelella).
3rd, United in a filament or ribbon ; which is continuous, if the 
cohesion extend to the entire surfaces of the frustules ( Rhabdonema, 
Fragilaria), but is sometimes a mere zig-zag chain (Diatoma, 
Grammatophora, Tabilaria), the cohesion being limited to the 
angles of the frustules.
4th, Aggregated into a frond; which consists of numerous 
frustules, more or less regularly enclosed in a gelatinous sheath 
( Schizonema, Encyonema).
These differences of condition, how- 
ever, are not made the ground of classification, because many of 
the families contain all or most of them.
Acknowledged authorities are agreed that the group naturally 
falls into two sections, viz.
— those with valves that possess a central 
longitudinal line and nodule (Navicula, Pleurosigma, Pinularia, 
and Gomphotiema ).
And secondly, including all those whose 
valves are destitute of these features ( Surerella, Campy lodiscus, 
Cosinodiscus ).
The unattached forms, when the process of division has been 
completed, live a perfectly free and independent existence.
They 
are most frequently met with on the surface of the mud in tidal 
harbours, roadside channels, dripping walls, and on the edges of 
grooves formed by small thread-like streams on sandy beaches.
In calm weather, examples of the latter may frequently be met 
with on the north shore, a little this side of William Pit, where 
I have found all but one of the species discovered by Dr. Donkin 
on the shore at Morpeth.
The remaining one {Epithemia tnarina) 
(Donkin) I obtained once only at St. Bees.
The stalked, stipitate, 
or filamentous forms, though occasionally found on stone in streams 
and pools (Meridion), are, however, usually found growing as 
parasites on sea-weed, conferva, and zoophytes.
The sides of the piers, and the rock-pools between high and low 
water marks, furnish abundant gatherings of these varieties.
The 
frondiose species are almost invariably obtained from submerged 
stones or from moss that grows under water.
The last-named class 
contains species of great diversities of structure.
In some, the

daitoms are quite free, and arranged uniformly in transparent tubes 
of considerable density and firmness (Schizotmnd), while in others 
they are clustered in masses, according to a greater or less definite 
plan, the investing substance being less consistent, and partaking 
more of the character of mucus than the tubes of the former 
{Mastagloid).
Specimens of the latter I have found about half-way up the 
cliff above the sewage-outlet, which is indeed the only place in 
which I have ever found them.
The former — viz.
those in gela- 
tinous tubes — may be had in many varieties and great quantities 
in the rock-pools around Tom Kurd's Rock, below Wellington 
Pit. Their presence may be known by the velvety appearance 
they give to submerged stones on which they grow.
To the microscopist and the optician, the lines on the valves of 
some genera of the Diatomacese are especially interesting ; which, 
because of their great number and extreme delicacy, are much 
esteemed as test-objects for ascertaining the defining quality of 
microscope object-glasses of high magnifying power.
Of these 
markings, or strise, a great difference of number, distribution, and 
development is found to exist among the several genera.
Not 
unfrequently, two or more sorts of markings are present in the 
same individual, and on the same valve (^Heliopelta, Adinoptychus).
The entire surface may be covered with certain bands or dots, or 
both, as is the case with all the members of the first great section 
{Naviculm), which has already been named as having a longitudinal 
line and central nodule.
The number of these lines, or striae, 
present on the frustules of some of the species of Pleurosigma 
and Navicula are, if possible, more incomprehensible and con- 
founding than the expressed magnitudes and distances of the 
heavenly bodies.
For instance, within a linear inch of space, 
clearly and sharply defined, P.
formosum has 34,000, P.
balticiim 
has 38,000, P.
hippocampus has 40,000, P.
quadratum has 43,000, 
P. angulatiim has 52,000, P.
fasciola has 52,000, and Navictda 
rhomboides has 100,000 such lines.
The mode of increase of the Diatomaceae is twofold.
The 
most common, and what was long thought to have been the only 
204 
one, is that in which the cell undergoes subdivision.
In this 
process, the endochrome, or cell-contents, become divided longi- 
tudinally, and the separated portions attach themselves on opposite 
sides of the lining membrane, simultaneously with which movement, 
the lining membrane begins to bend from all parts of the circum- 
ference inwards, and continues to grow towards the centre, until 
the whole interior has been cut through with a double membrane, 
thus making the diatom double.
At the same time, and as a consequence of these processes, 
the cell becomes enlarged, the connecting zone is greatly widened, 
and the newly-formed membranes secrete to themselves each a 
siliceous valve, in every respect the exact counterparts of those of 
the original diatom.
When this process, or series of processes, is 
complete, the hoop bursts, and generally disappears, while the two 
liberated diatoms go forth to repeat the same round of functions 
that gave them birth.
The other mode of increase is the result of 
conjugation.
It has been detected only in about forty species, 
and these have been seen by only five or six observers.
Our 
acquaintance, therefore, with the phenomena which attend this 
process, must necessarily be limited and imperfect.
This process bears a striking resemblance to the conju- 
gation that prevails in several other of the lower organisms 
( Desmidacece, ZignemacecB ).
Mr. Thwaites, the first observer of 
this process in the Diatomacese, thus describes it : " The process 
of conjugation consists in the union of the endochrome of approxi- 
mate diatoms, this mixed endochrome developing around itself a 
proper membrane, and this becoming converted into the spor- 
angium.
" 
In a very early stage of the process, the conjugating frustules 
have their concave surfaces in nearly close contact, and it may be 
observed that from one of these surfaces two protuberances arise, 
with two similar ones in the opposite frustule.
These protuber- 
ances indicate the future channels of communication by which 
the endochrome become united, as well as the spot where is 
subsequently developed the double sporangium.
The mixed 
endochrome occurs at first in two irregular masses between the   
205 
conjugated frustules ; but these masses shortly become covered 
with a smooth membrane.
The young sporangia, which gradually 
increase m length, retaining nearly a cylindrical form until they 
far exceed m dimensions the parent frustules, and at length, when 
mature, become like them striated upon the surface.
Around the whole structure a considerable mucus has during 
this time been developed, by which the empty frustules are held 
attached to the sporangia.
The phenomena, as they have been 
seen m other species, differ somewhat from this description, yet 
they resemble them in the main.
When seen through the microscope, diatoms are found to have 
the power of motion.
The character and amount of locomotion 
differ considerably in the various species.
In the Navicula it 
consists of repeated jerks in the direction of its length to be 
repeated in the opposite direction.
In the saddle-shaped forms 
{Campy lodiscus), it is simply a slow languid roll from side to side • 
while m the round forms it is a very slight rotary action.
For a 
long time this observed motion greatly puzzled naturalists, and 
many fanciful speculations were started to account for it It was 
thought by many that this power of locomotion determined their 
animal affinities.
It is now known that this movement is not a 
property confined to the diatoms, but that it is in greater or less 
degree common to all, or most of, the lowest orders of plants 
This was proved by Professor Williamson in his lecture here last 
Session.
It is no longer a doubtful question how this movement 
from place to place is accomplished in the diatoms, although no 
cilia or motile organs of any kind have ever been detected But 
Professor Shultze, of Bonn, has made it appear most probable that 
It is due to the action of the protoplasm, or cell-contents By 
employmg objectives of very high power, he discovered several 
very small holes in the connecting membrane.
He further noticed 
m numerous specimens, that the protoplasm, or endochrome 
protruded slightly through these holes, and he concluded that the 
movement of the frustule was produced by the contact of the 
protoplasm with its surroundings.
Jt has been said by someone that, although so exceedingly 
206 
minute and apparently insignificant in comparison with the majestic 
trees that in all time have composed, and the huge animals that 
have tenanted, the forests of our planet, yet by their excessive 
multiplication and accumulation, the Diatomacese assume even a 
greater importance in the physical history of the earth than any of 
these.
The truth of this statement is proved by the fact of living 
examples of these tiny atoms forming appreciable masses in an 
inconceivable short space of time, and also by innumerable 
instances where only their siliceous skeletons remain in a fossil, or 
a semi-fossil, condition.
Numerous instances are to be met with 
illustrative of the wide and rapid diffusion of the Diatomacese.
So 
great is their abundance in many rivers and estuaries, that their 
multiplication is affirmed by Professor Ehrenberg to have exercised 
an important influence in blocking up harbours and diminishing 
the depths of channels.
This statement is confirmed by Mr.
Roper, who says that the shells of diatoms have a perceptible 
influence in the formation of shoals and mud-banks in the bed of 
the Thames.
On the coast of Victoria Land, Dr. Hooker found a deposit 
of mud, chiefly consisting of their shells, not less than four hundred 
miles long and one hundred miles broad.
Of the thickness of 
this deposit no conjecture could be formed ; sometimes the lead 
sank in it to a depth of two feet.
The siliceous nature of this group of plants has served to 
preserve and to perpetuate their presence in numerous localities 
all over the world, where now, even the conditions essential to 
their existence as living organisms are no longer found.
In these places they occur as soft white creamy or faint reddy- 
blue coloured rock.
Lough Mourne, Dolgethelly, and Toomebridge 
in Ireland ; Holderness and Ulverstone in England ; Peterhead in 
Scotland ; Bilin in Bohemia ; and Oran in Algiers, are a few such 
instances.
But by tar the largest deposits are found in America.
The river Columbia, in one part of its course, runs between two 
precipices seven hundred or eight hundred feet high, which are 
composed of porcelain clay five hundred feet thick, covered by a 
207 
bed of compact basalt one hundred feet thick, which again is 
capped by some volcanic deposits.
The argillaceous strata are of 
very fine grain, and of various colours ; some portions being as 
white as chalk.
Dr. Bailey has shewn that this clay is entirely 
composed of fresh-water Diatomaceae.
Its perfect freedom from 
sand shews that it is not a drift, but that it must have been formed 
by plants that lived on the spot.
This is the largest deposit 
known.
Ordinarily these deposits do not exceed from one to four 
feet in thickness ; but those of Lune-berg and Bilin have a depth 
of forty feet.
Some beds are also known to attain a thickness of 
seventy feet : such are not usually pure, but are mixed with sand 
and other matters.
The Island of Barbadoes contains many such 
deposits, some of which are rich in forms found nowhere else.
A 
kind of stone imported from Jutland for the manufacture of cement 
is also Composed in large measure of diatom-remains unlike any 
other known species.
The city of New York stands on one of 
these accumulations of diatoms, having a great proportion of 
species identical, in every particular, with the same species found 
living now in our own pools and streams.
I will close this paper with a quotation from one of the best 
authorities on the Diatomaceae.
Prof Smith says : "Of the purposes 
served by the diffusion of these organisms, it is impossible to speak 
with certainty.
Their minute size forbids us to attribute much 
effect to their individual influences ; but when we regard them as 
aggregated in numbers that defy enumeration, we are compelled 
to believe that they occupy an important place, and subserve 
necessary ends in the economy of Nature.
Their nutritive process, 
which involves the absorption of Carbonic Acid and the exhalation 
of Ox)'gen, must tend to preserve the purity of the water in which 
they are found, and to fit it for the respiration of aquatic animals.
Their presence in the stomachs of Infusoria, Annelida, MoUusca, 
and Crustacea, shows that they constitute to some extent the food 
of these animals ; and the vast numbers of their remains which 
occur in guano, prove that they are swallowed in large quantities 
by sea-birds, and minister to their subsistence.
" Their direct uses to man are probably few and inappreciable, 
308 
except in the mechanical arts, where the powdered debris of their 
frustules, owing to its silicious character, is employed as a polishing 
material.
Indirectly, they doubtless contribute to the fertility of 
the soil, and promote the growth of many of the cereals which 
furnish the human family with some of the elements of food.
" Should we even fail in our attempt to explain the precise 
purposes of the Diatomacese in the economy of being, we may 
rest assured that organisms of such infinite variety have not been 
formed in vain, and that the time we may occupy in the study of 
their functions, or in the admiration of their marvellous symmetry, 
will not have been idly spent, if it enhance our conception of 
Creative Skill, and strengthen our persuasion of the Omnipotent 
Power and Diffusive Energy of the Divine Artificer of Nature."

The Committee of the Association, in presenting their fourteenth 
Annual Report, have much pleasure in stating that 31 New 
Members have been added during the past Session, but, owing to 
resignations and removal, the number of Members on the register 
has only increased from 269 to 280.
Eleven papers have been read by Members and their local 
friends, and one special lecture was given by J.
E. Taylor, 
Ph. D., F.L.S., F.G.S., &c., of Ipswich, on "Bees, their Relation 
to Agriculture and to Horticulture." 
An effort has been made to increase the usefulness of the Associ- 
ation, by inviting some of the Benefit and other Societies^of the 
Town, to inspect the Museum and Loan Collection and to hear 
scientific addresses.
Of the six entertainments given, two were 
very well attended.
The Library has been increased by a gift of 33 vols.
The 
Committee beg to call the attention of Associate Members to the 
fact of the Honorary Librarian being at the Rooms on Tuesday 
evenings.
A loan collection of Drawings has been obtained from the 
South Kensington Museum, and the Committee desire to thank 
Lord Lonsdale, Mrs. Robertson Walker, Messrs.
Ainsworth, 
Mr. J.
G. Dees, Mr. R.
Russell, Dr. Ablett, Dr. Parker, 
Mr. W.
Whittle, Mrs. D.
Robertson, Mr. J.
Robertson, Mr. J.
Vivian, Mr. Jacques, The Proprietors of the Graphic, The 
President, and many other friends, for the valuable collection of 
Pictures, Pottery, and other interesting objects lent to increase 
the exhibits of the Museum.
The Museum has been greatly enlarged and improved, and 
three new cases have been added.
The donations have been 
very numerous and valuable; they are mostly Zoological and 
Mineralogical, but in addition, a series of Ornaments and Weapons 
of Tribes in the Pacific have been presented by the Earl of 
Lonsdale.
A cork model of Workington Hall, purchased and 
presented by several of the Members, has been placed in the 
Library.
Many of the plants collected by the Botanical Section 
have been mounted under glass by Mr. Adair and look very 
effective.
The Curator begs to thank those Members who have so kindly 
contributed specimens, and hopes there will be no falling off 
during the ensuing year.
A catalogue of the contents of the Museum is being prepared.
As will be seen by the Financial Statement of the Treasurer, 
there is a debit balance against the Association, incurred by 
making additions to the cases in the Museum, and alteration to 
Rooms, &c.
; but as these charges, amounting to nearly ^64, are 
on account of capital, and the revenue account is very much in 
excess of current expenses, the finances of the Association are in 
a satisfactory condition.
Science Classes.
During the Session, Science Classes, in connection with the 
Science and Art Department, South Kensington, have been held.
Your Committee were fortunate in being able to secure the services 
of Mr. A.
Freeman as Head Master, who has conducted the 
classes free of cost to the Institution ; and they consider that the 
thanks of this meeting are due to that gentleman, and also to 
Messrs.
Bonny, Doughty, and Rose, for the great benefit they have 
rendered the Association as teachers.
The number of classes started was six, the subjects being (i) 
Mathematics, (2) Animal Physiology, (3) Acoustics, Light, and 
Heat, (4) Physiography, (5) Magnetism and Electricity, (6) Steam; 
two of this number were however, on account of the smallness of 
the number, and the irregularity of the attendance of Students, 
given up, namely, those on Magnetism and Electricity and 
Steam.
The other classes have been fairly well attended, and on the 
whole successful.
The total number of Students under instruction 
during the Session, was 48, and of this number 41 intend to present 
themselves for Examination by the Department during the present 
month.
Zoological Section.
The first Session of this Section was held during the summer of 
last year.
Twelve lectures were given on the outlines of Zoology; 
the lectures were illustrated by numerous diagrams, and by over 
two hundred specimens of the Animal Kingdom.
A number of specimens were also exhibitedgby the Microscope.
There were also two Aquaria, marine and fresh water, for ob- 
serving the habits of aquatic animals.
About thirty Members 
attended the course, which it is proposed to resume next Winter 
Session, for which some interesting papers are already promised.
Botanical Section.
The Members of the Botanical Section have been diligently 
searching the district during the past season.
They have collected 
a number of specimens, which they purpose handing to the 
Curator as soon as they are mounted and named.
Discoveries of Plants new to them have been made in various 
parts of the district.
They are now engaged in preparing a 
complete list of all Plants observed by them, which will be offered 
for publication in the next part of the Transactions of the 
Cumberland Association.
The list of Plants will include the Flowering Plants, the Grasses, 
the Ferns, the Lichens, the Mosses, and the Diatoms.

Both Public Lectures and Ordinary Meetings have been well 
attended throughout the session, and the Committee have reason 
to congratulate the Society on the general interest manifested in 
its work, and also on the state of its finances.
The income from 
all sources amounted to ;!^46 4s.
gd., and after giving a donation 
of ;^5 to the Keswick Library, and discharging all claims against 
the Society, a balance of ^18 17s.
rod.
remains in hand.
Twenty new members were elected during the session ; while, 
on the other hand, there was a loss of fifteen, from removals and 
other causes.
The total number of members now on the register 
is 154.
During the summer months two Excursions or Field Days were 
held.
The first, on the 26th of May, was to the Cumberland Road 
Metal Company's Quarry, on the Threlkeld Common, and the 
so-called British village near the same place ; thence to the site of 
Threkeld Hall, where a paper was read by Mr. J.
Fisher 
Crosthwaite, on the history of the hall and its owners, together 
with an allusion to its gardens, moats, and defences.
The weather 
was very unfavourable, and consequently the attendance was small.
The second excursion was to Haweswater and Mardale Green, on 
the 23rd June, and eighty-three members were present, although 
the weather was far from agreeable.
Some of the party ascended 
to Small Water and Blea Water Tarns, while others inspected the 
ancient church at Mardale ; and on the return journey the whole 
party alighted at Askham, for the purpose of visiting Lowther 
Castle.
Both these excursions were conducted without any 
assistance from the general funds of the Society.
The following are the Officers and Committee for the ensuing 
Session : — President, Rev. A.
Howson ; Vice-President, Rev.
Canon Harford Battersby ; Hon. Secretary, Mr. J.

This Society is now completing its 5th Session, having been 
inaugurated on September 25th, 1876; and it is very gratifying to 
record that each year there has been an increase in the number of 
Members.
This year there are 133 Members, viz.
31 ladies and 
102 gentlemen, the numbers for the four preceding Sessions being 
70, 80, 102, and no respectively.
There are now also 17 Honorary Members, the following having 
been elected during the past Session : W.
J. Dohertv, Esq., 
M.R.I.A.; T.
H. Ingham, Esq.; R.
J. Baillie, Esq., FR.A.S.
The best thanks of the Association are due to all those who 
took part in the programme, which comprised six Public and seven 
Ordinary Meetings.
It is a matter for congratulation that the 
attendance at the Lectures has been so well maintained, a fact 
doubtless owing to the general excellence of the papers read.
A 
new Rule was made at the beginning of the Session, viz.
: *' That 
all persons under the age of 21 be admitted as Members on the 
payment of 2s.
6d." This has not resulted in the success that 
might have been anticipated, only five such Members having been 
enrolled ; still we hope to chronicle a large increase in this respect 
next Session.
A Conversazione and Exhibition held in the Coffee Tavern 
proved a great success.
Financially the Association is in a very 
flourishing condition.

The Committee have pleasure in reporting an increase of 
members during the year, there being now 56 on the books, 
against 44 last year ; but owing to the reduction of the contribu- 
tions of junior members from 2s.
6d.
to is.
6d., and also to the 
small attendance of the public at the lectures, the income of the 
Society shows a falling off, and has not met the expenditure, the 
total income being ;^7 17s.

a balance due to Treasurer of jQz 5s.

During the summer, excursions were made to Netherby, 
Hermatage Castle, Gilnockie, and Solway Moss, at which papers 
were read by J.
R. Armstong, Esq., Rev. Wm.
Lytteil, M.A., W.
Easton Robertson, Esq., Mr. Johnson of Canonbie, and the 
Secretary.
In these excursions the Society was joined by the 
members of the Canonbie Young Men's Christian Association, 
and most instructive and enjoyable meetings were uniformly spent.
The winter Session was carried out (with some alteration of 
dates) in accordance with the printed programme.
The first 
meeting was very large ; R.
A. Allision, Esq., occupied the chair.
Addresses were given by W.
E. Robertson, Esq., and the Rev. Wm.
Lytteil, and a selection of readings, anthems, &c., was given by 
the members, Mr. J.
Button presiding at the pianoforte.
The 
Committee regret that the other meetings were but poorly attended, 
although the lectures, papers, &c., were fully up to the standard of 
former years.
At the last meeting the following Officers were elected for 
1881-82 : — President, the Rev. Joseph Wallace, M.A.; Vice- 
Presidents, R.

The meetings of our Society have been well attended this 
Session ; but the number of Members has fallen from 126 to 103.
This diminution, however, has been mostly caused by the removal 
of Members from the neighbourhood.
There were two Field-days held last summer.
The first 
Excursion was to Abbey Town, where the Abbey, Raby Court, Sec, 
were inspected.
The Rev. A.
F. Sheppard reading a paper on the 
" Old Abbey." The Members of the Carlisle Scientific Society 
and Field Naturalists' Club joined us on this occasion.
The second Excursion was to Lanercost, Naworth, and Gilsland, 
but owing to the wet morning very few attended.
The Committee take this opportunity of thanking those gentle- 
men who so kindly came from other Societies to help us.
They 
regret the removal of the Rev. W.
Home, M.A., the President, as 
he always did his utmost to further the interests of the Societ)'.
Although the subscription for the Session is only 2s.
6d., the 
Society has a good balance in hand.

The Committee in presenting the 4th Annual Report regret that 
they are unable to state that the success of previous Sessions has 
been maintained.
A very full programme of public lectures on subjects of great 
interest was arranged, and the attendance on these has been very 
fair, although scarcely so good as might have been expected ; but 
the Committee found very great difficulty in providing papers for 
the Ordinary Meetings, and regret they were unable to arrange for 
the full number of such meetings.
The Society is in a very satisfactory condition financially.
Ten Members have been elected during the year.
64 have 
withdrawn.
The total number of Members is now 136.
During the summer the Committee, through the kindness of 
Mr. E.
Hebert, were enabled to arrange a Field-day to Green Side 
Mines, Patterdale.
The Committee have thankfully to acknowledge the very 
efficient help of the gentlemen who have kindly given lectures or 
read papers ; and also the assistance they have received from 
several ladies and gentlemen, Members of the Society, in obtaining 
the services of lecturers.
Your Committee greatly regret that after holding the office of 
President since the commencement of the Society, Mr. Crewdson 
feels it necessary to resign.

The Committee have pleasure in presenting their First Annual

The Society having been originally formed as a Field Naturalist 
Club in July, 1880, was affiliated in the Spring of 1881, under its 
present name, to the Cumberland Association for the Advancement 
of Literature and Science.
During the Session 7 1 members have been enrolled.
The Lectures have been fairly attended, but there is room for 
improvement.

Since our last meeting, several changes have taken place affecting 
the Association.
The number of members is about 88 less than in the years 
1879-80, being now ii8r, as against 1269 in the present year.
This diminution is partly owing to the falling off in the members 
of two of the affiliated societies — Silloth and Ambleside ; but it 
mainly arises from the apparent dissolution of the Cocker^xiouth 
Society, which for some time has been declining in strength and 
spirit.
It cannot, however, I am told, be said to be dead, but 
only in a state of suspended animation.
The other affiliated 
societies have increased the number of their members, especially 
the Maryport Society.
As a set-off against the temporary loss of Cockermouth, I have 
to announce the recent affiliation of the Brampton Field Naturalists' 
Club, the members of which are, however, not included in 
the above number, as the affiliation has only been completed to- 
day.
So far as numbers go, we may therefore say that there has 
'been little or no change from last year.
Financially, the condition of the Association is improved, 
although not by so much as would appear fiom a comparison of the 
last balance sheet with that which is now submitted.
In the 
balance sheet for 1879-80, there was a sum of ^4 ids.
6d.
in- 
cluded in the payments — the expenses of the Maryport meeting — 
which correctly should have stood over, and been included in the 
payments of the present balance sheet, in the same way as the 
expenses of this meeting will appear in the next balance sheet.
With this adjustment, the adverse balance of ^i os.

appear- 
ing in the last balance sheet becomes a favourable balance of 
p^3 los.

The 
Transactions have produced about £,b less than they did in the 
previous year.
The cost of producing the Transactions has been 
reduced by about ;^3o.
It may be well to mention that there is on hand a considerable 
number of copies of each part of the Transactions, which either 
members or others can have on application.
There is also a 
number of authors' copies on hand to be disposed of.

WARD MEMORIAL FUND.
In Part V.
of the Transactions it was mentioned that the Council 
of the Cumberland Association for the Advancement of Literature 
and Science had decided to give the friends and admirers of the 
late Rev. J.
Clifton Ward an opportunity of subscribing towards 
a general fund, whereof part was to be devoted to the erection of 
a Memorial Tablet, and the remainder to be vested in trustees as 
a contribution towards the sum required for the education of his 
daughters.
The Ward Memorial Fund has now reached the amount of 
;;^3i2 i6s."6d.; and the Rev. Canon Battersby, Mr. Peile, and 
Dr. Knight have accepted office as Trustees.
The Memorial Tablet is now completed, and bears the

AKBER THE GREAT, AN HISTORICAL SKETCH.* 
By the Hon. PERCY WYNDHAM, M.P.
(Presidential Address at the Workington Anmeal Meeting.) 
Akber the Great stands in the front rank of those who have 
been wise and beneficent rulers of mankind, if, indeed, he does 
not occupy a position by himself in advance of all his compeers.
The searching light of modern criticism, which has dethroned so 
many idols, and on the other hand has called upon us to regard 
with honour and gratitude the memory of men heretofore classed 
with the worst, has never been thrown upon the person and history 
of Akber.
If subjected to such criticism, the probabilities are, however, 
that he would come out unscathed by the ordeal.
In the con- 
temporary records, his character comes out with greater clearness 
and grandeur in the accounts of hostile writers, than in the fulsome 
pages of his flatterers.
The life and character of Akber are so 
remarkable, and his reign so illustrious, that he became the subject 
of complete biographies and histories, by native authors of high 
reputation ; while the records of the English Embassies, and the 
residence at Agra of Europeans of different nations, in considerable 
numbers, give undoubted confirmation on many points, which are 
entirely wanting in regard to many former monarchs of India.
He was one of those Emperors of India, known to our fathers 
as the Great Mogul, whose latest descendant, then a monarch only

\ 
in name, perished at Delhi at the time of the Indian Mutiny.
The 
grandson of Baber, who passed many years of his life as a home- 
less adventurer, the son of Hoomagoon, who was for five years 
ousted from his kingdom by the Afghan Dynasty of Soor, when 
Akber was raised to the throne in succession to his father on the 
15th of February, 1556, at the early age of thirteen years and 
three months, only those portions of his vast kingdom immediately 
contiguous to the capital could be said to be under complete 
control.
Public affairs in Northern and Eastern India were by 
no means settled.
Sikander Shah Soor, though defeated, was still 
in the field, at the head of some of the best old Patan chivalry.
In the eastern provinces, the Patans still held royal power ; and 
Mahomed Soor Adily, with his followers and clansmen, was a 
formidable antagonist.
The Rajpoots and Hindoos of central 
India had as yet made no declaration, either of adherence to the 
old Mahomedan party, or recognition of the new; and while 
many new estates and dignities had been granted by Hoomagoon 
to those who had served him best, tlie estates and allowances of 
the nobles and officers of Putan Court were as yet unconfirmed.
It is almost impossible to conceive of the existence of elements 
more profoundly disturbing or difficult to deal with; and to increase 
the embarrassment, the Mogul force in the country was singularly 
small, and may not at this period, even with reinforcements from 
Afghanistan, have exceeded 30,000 cavalry ; whereas, on the other 
hand, the united Patan clans could bring 100,000 into the field 
with ease ; and Kabool and Kandahar, with Budukshan, ever 
restless and mutinous, were also to be controlled.
Over this 
seething and unstable mass, a boy barely fourteen years of age, and 
his counsellors, inexperienced in Indian affairs, were to preside, 
and out of it to create one of the greatest empires in the world.
It would be long and tedious upon the present occasion, to 
attempt to follow him through his conquests, second alone to 
subjugating his kingdom, was the diflficulty of emancipating himself 
and his government, from the control of one or two able men 
by whom he was surrounded.
Coming to the throne at so early 
an age, the chosen advisers and followers of his father, who had 
largely assisted in restoring the latter to power, naturally exercised 
great influence on the acts and will of Akber.
The tact, firmness, 
and courage, with which he speedily freed himself from this domin- 
ation, are remarkable.
Foremost among these men was Beiram Khan Toorkaman, his 
tutor and general ; and who, on his accession to the throne, he 
raised to the dignity of Khan Khanan, or lord of lords, as his 
prime minister, and committed to him the general regulation of 
civil and military affairs in detail ; but young as he was — and 
indeed from the very first — he never seems to have evaded the 
responsibility or the toil of the authority in chief, to have been 
drawn out of it into the pleasures of youth, or ever to have lost 
confidence in himself 
At the close of the campaign against Hemoo, the minister and 
general-in-chief of the Patan monarchy, when the former was taken 
prisoner, Beiram Khan pressed Akber to kill the infidel captive 
with his own hand, and so become entitled to the proud title of 
" Ghazy," or Champion of the Faith.
The boy burst into tears, 
but drawing his sword, touched the head of his captive with it, 
when Beiram Khan, observing his emotion and natural reluctance 
to strike, at one blow with his sabre severed the captive's head 
from his body.
As time went on, the relations between the young Emperor 
and his able minister became somewhat strained.
Akber of late 
had had many great questions to decide, and many new and serious 
responsibilities to assume, which had given strength and decision 
to his character ; and he had rewarded independently those who 
had done him good service.
Beiram Khan does not always appear 
to have been present on these occasions, and the boy was thus 
thrown upon his own resources.
When Beiram Khan heard that 
Akber had rewarded persons without referring them to him, he 
took offence, and withdrew himself for some days.
Other events 
tended to hasten the minister's fall.
The discipline among the Mongul commanders had been of a 
loose description ; for the most part semi-independent chieftains 
themselves, at the head of their clans, they had been used to act 
very much as they pleased ; and though, when assembled together, 
they fought bravely and faithfully, they were not to be relied upon 
when separated.
During the campaign against Hemoo, and whilst 
the Emperor was temporarily absent from camp, Beiram resolved 
upon making one serious example, and caused Tardy Khan Beg 
to be beheaded, on the ground of his having abandoned his post 
at Dehli.
On his return, Beiram Khan informed Akber what he 
had done, and of his grounds for so severe a measure, which 
involved the discipline of the army and the safety of all.
Akber 
gave a reluctant approval of the act, which was abundantly justified 
in the result.
Other acts of Beiram Khan were of a violent and perhaps 
revengeful character ; and though as a state necessity, Akber had 
openly acquiesced in the policy of the execution of Tardy Khan 
Beg, yet that officer had been one of his father's earliest and most 
devoted friends and companions : no taint had ever fallen upon 
his reputation for bravery ; and general sympathy for his fate 
prevailed, which was shared by Akber himself 
One day, during an elephant fight which the Emperor was 
witnessing, one of the beasts engaged ran through the ropes of the 
minister's tent, who took the accident as a personal affront, and 
remonstrated against it; but was apparently satisfied with his 
ward's protestation that no indignity was intended.
Several other 
occurrences served to excite mutual suspicion.
The summary 
execution by Beiram Khan of a person of some rank, who had 
given him offence, aroused the anger of the Chogtay Tartar nobles 
of the court to whose tribe he had belonged ; and Moolla Pier 
Mahomed, the Emperor's preceptor, who had also given offence to 
the minister, was summarily removed from office, banished from 
court, and replaced by a person in the minister's interest.
The 
breach between them was evidently widening, when at Agra one 
of the royal elephants attacked and killed another belonging to 
the minister, who ordered the driver of the emperor's elephant to 
be put to death ; and on another occasion, an elepliant ran against 
a boat in the river in which the minister was seated, and almost 
ypset it, Beiram Khan considering this as a plot against his life, 
demanded the punishment of the driver, and Akber sent him to 
the minister to be dealt with as necessary.
He also was put to 
death— an act of cruelty which caused the Emperor deep pain and 
offence.
Perceiving himself out of favour, Beirara Khan under- 
took a campaign against Byana, but was unable to continue it 
unsupported, and released Shah Abdool Maaly, a nobleman who 
had been imprisoned for revolt, and seems by his aid to have 
contemplated an expedition against the Afghans of Bengal, with a 
view of establishing his own independence in that direction.
All 
these acts combined to bring on a total estrangement between the 
Emperor and Beiram Khan : and Akber resolved upon asserting 
his right to carry on the government himself He therefore sent 
his preceptor to the minister with the following characteristic 
message : " Till now," he wrote, " our mind has been taken up 
with our education and the amusements of youth, and it was our 
royal will that you should regulate the affairs of our empire ; but it 
being our intention to govern our people by our own judgment, 
let our well-wisher withdraw from all worldly concerns, and retiring 
to Mecca, far removed from the toils of public life, spend the rest 
of his days in prayer." Beiram Khan did not resist; he sent the 
insignia of his rank and public establishments to the Emperor, and 
proceeded as far as Bhikanere, in Rajpootana, on his way to 
Mecca.
Here he seems to have changed his pacific submission 
for an attitude of defiance and rebeUion, and in 1559 began to 
raise troops.
He was overthrown, and fled to the mountains, and 
eventually sent a favourite servant to the Emperor imploring 
forgiveness.
An ofiicer was despatched to bring him safely to 
Court.
In December, 1560, he was met near the royal camp by 
a deputation of oflicers from the Emperor, and conducted honour- 
ably to his presence, where he threw himself weeping at the foot 
of the throne.
Akber, much affected, stretched forth his hand 
and raised him, invested him with an honorary dress, and placed 
him in his old position as head of the nobles.
A pension of 
50,000 rupees (5,000/.) a year was settled upon him, and Beiram 
Khan proceeded to Gudgerut, on his way to Mecca.
In no act of his life did the Emperor display more acute judg- 
ment and fine temper, than in the graceful dismissal of his great 
minister.
Henceforth Akber was to rule alone.
He was now 
eighteen years of age.
AKBER AS A GENERAL.
As a general, Akber was celebrated for the promptitude with 
which he formed his plans of attack, and the celerity with which 
he carried them out.
The war with the Usbecs under Khan Zeman and Asof Khan 
had lasted two years, and had been interrupted by alternate 
submission and renewed defection on the part of more than one 
of the chiefs.
It was concluded by an act of courage, very 
characteristic of the Emperor.
Akber had made great progress in 
reducing the rebellion, when he was drawn off by an invasion of 
the Punjab under his brother Hakim.
This occupied him for 
several months; and on his return, he found the rebels had 
recovered their ground, and were in possession of most parts of 
the Subahs of Oudh and Allahabad.
He marched against them, 
without delay, though it was the height of the rainy season; drove 
them across the Ganges ; and when they thought themselves 
secure behind that swollen river, swam the Ganges at nightfall on 
his elephant, with his advanced guard of not more than 2,000 
men, and after lying concealed during the night, attacked the 
enemy about sunrise.
The rebels, though aware of the approach 
of a small body of horse, were quite unprepared for an attack ; 
and Khan Zeman having been killed, and another principal chief 
unhorsed, and made prisoner in the first confusion, they lost all 
advantage of their numbers, fell into complete disorder, and soon 
after dispersed and fled in all directions.
In July, 1573, he received advice by express from Guzerat, that 
the officers of the Guzerat Kingdom had united in a formidable 
insurrection, taken several districts, and were then besieging 
Ahmedabad.
The rainy season had set in, and the transport of a 
large force was impossible.
Two thousand picked horsemen were 
therefore pushed on, and the Emperor and his retinue, about three 
hundred persons, followed by double marches on camels.
When 
he reached his advanced troops at Paitun, the whole, Ferishta 
states, did not exceed 3,000 men.
They had marched four 
hundred and fifty miles in nine days.
With this small force the 
Emperor marched direct on Ahmedabad, ordering the royal kettle- 
drums to beat as he approached the enemy's camp.
Mahomed 
Hoosein Mirza, the king's cousin, one of the rebels, rode out to 
reconnoitre, and perceiving one of the Emperor's officers examining 
the ford, asked whose army was approaching, and was told it was 
Akber in person.
"Impossible!" he exclaimed, "it is only 
fourteen days since one of my spies saw him at Agra." " It is 
only nine days since he marched," was the reply.
I need not 
linger on the details of the battle which ensued ; but it resulted in 
a complete victory for the Emperor.
HIS INTERNAL POLICY.
But it is to his internal policy that Akber owes his place in that 
highest order of princes, whose reigns have been a blessing to 
mankind; and that policy shows itself in different shapes, as it 
affects religion or civil government.
The most remarkable quality 
in Akber was his religious toleration.
When we remember the 
age in which he lived, and that at that date Europe was divided 
into hostile religious camps, whose only anxiety was to burn one 
another; and that not one man in power and authority, had will 
or power to protest against such a spirit — what Akber accom- 
plished was most remarkable.
Surrounded by fierce fanaticism, 
he succeeded in establishing perfect religious equality and freedom 
throughout his vast dominions.
Some of his ablest ministers were 
Hindoos, and the path to honour and promotion was open to all 
who possessed merit.
Though Akber escaped, his friend and 
minister, Abul Fazl, fell by an assassin's hand.
The Emperor was 
spared the bitter pang of knowing in his lifetime that the assassin- 
ation of his friend was instigated by his own son Selim.
The 
latter, afterwards the Emperor Jehanger, has placed the matter 
beyond doubt by confessing it at length in his own memoirs, and 
defending it on the ground that Abul Fazl had persuaded Akber 
to renounce the Koran, and to deny the divine mission of 
Mahomet.
8 
The blame of corrupting Akber's theology is thrown by Mussul- 
man writers on Abul Fazl and his learned, and scarcely less 
celebrated, brother Feizi.
These men were sons of a learned man 
named Mobarik, who had read the philosophical works of the 
ancients.
Feizi was the first Mussulman who applied himself to a 
diligent study of Hindoo literature and science.
Under the aid 
and direction of the Emperor, he conducted a systematic inquiry 
into every branch of the knowledge of the Brahmins, and translated, 
or superintended the translation, of all the standard Sanscrit works.
Akber's acquisitions of this nature were not confined to Sanscrit.
He prevailed on a Christian priest, whom Abul Fazl calls Padre 
Farabatun, and describes as learned in science and history, to 
come from Goa, and midertake the education of a few youths 
destined to be employed in translating the productions of Greek 
literature into Persian.
Feizi himself was destined to make a 
correct version of the Evangelists.
Akber's endeavour was, in 
his own words, "that every one was to be educated according to 
his circumstances and particular views in life." 
Along with Feizi and Abul Fazl, there were many other learned 
men of all religions about the Court ; and it was the delight of 
Akber to assemble them, and sit for whole nights assisting at their 
philosophical discussions.
His regular meetings were on Fridays; 
but he often sent for single Brahmins or Mahometan Sufis on 
other occasions, and entered into long enquiries regarding the 
tenets of their difierent schools.
An account of a real debate of 
this kind is given in the Akburnamek.
It was carried on before 
an assembly of the learried of all religions, between Padre Reclif, 
i.e. the Portuguese missionary Rodolpho Aquiviva, and a body 
of Mahometan Mullahs : a decided advantage both in temper and 
argument, is given to the Christian.
It was concluded by Akber's 
reproving the Mullahs for their violence, and expressing his own 
opinion, that God could only be adequately worshipped by following 
reason, and not yielding implicit faith to any alleged revelation.
It is probable that the Portuguese Jesuits entertained hope of 
converting Akber, as it is related that he adored the images ol 
Jesus Christ and the Virgin with awe and veneration.
Mr. Elphin- 
stone considers his religion to have been a pure deism ; while it is 
more than probable that some contemporary Mahometan writers, 
who characterised some of his intimates as free-thinkers, and even 
as atheists, may have put Akber in the same category, though they 
may have shrunk from openly expressing their views.
His main tenet seems to have been that man could of himself 
acquire knowledge of God, and that we ought to serve Him, and 
seek for our future happiness by subduing our bad passions, and 
practising such virtues as are beneficial to mankind ; but that we 
should not regard any Dogma, Creed, or Ritual promulgated by 
man as infallible, as every man was liable to vice and erior like 
ourselves.
He did not neglect ordinances however altogether, 
and practised prayer twice in the twenty-four hours — at midnight 
and at daybreak.
He held that his right to interfere at all with 
the religion of others, was grounded on his duty as civil magistrate.
In the propagation of his opinions, Akber confined himself to 
persuasion, and made little progress except among the people 
about his Court, and a few learned men ; but his measures were 
much stronger in abrogating the obligations of the Mussulman 
religion, which, till now, had been enforced by law.
Prayers, fasts, 
alms, pilgrimages, and public worship were left optional ; the 
prohibition of unclean animals, that of the moderate use of wine, 
and that of gaming with dice, were taken off; and circumcision 
was not permitted until the age of twelve, when the person to 
undergo it could judge of the propriety of the rite.
As the Hindoos had not been supported by the government, 
Akber had less occasion to interfere with them; and, indeed, 
from the tolerant and inoffensive character of their religion, he 
seems to have had little inclination.
He, however, forbade trials by ordeal, and marriages before the 
age of puberty, and the slaughter of animals for sacrifice.
He also 
permitted widows to marry a second time, contrary to the Hindu 
law.
Above all, he prohibited the burning of Hindoo widows 
against their will, and took effectual precautions to ascertain that 
their resolution was free and uninfluenced.
On one occasion, 
hearing that the Rajah of Judpur was abqut to force his son's 
10 
widow to the pile, he mounted his horse, iiiid rode post to the 
spot, to prevent the intended sacrifice.
Among other reforms, he abohshed the Capitation Tax on 
infidels, and also all taxes on pilgrims ; observing that " although 
the tax fell on a vain superstition, yet, as all modes of worship 
were designed for one great Being, it was wrong to throw an 
obstacle in the way of the devout, and to cut them off from their 
mode of intercourse with their Maker." He also prohibited the 
making slaves of prisoners taken in war.
Akber's religion was too spiritual and abstracted to be successful 
with the bulk of mankind.
It seems never to have gone beyond 
a few philosophers, and some interested priests and courtiers ; and, 
on Akber's death, it expired of itself, and the Mussulman forms 
were quickly and almost silently restored by Jehanger.
Akber's revenue system, so celebrated for the benefits it 
conferred on India, is the same now in force under Queen 
Victoria ; which we shall probably consider the highest praise it 
could obtain.
The objects of it were : — i.
To obtain a correct 
measurement of the land.
2. To ascertain the amount of the 
produce of each begah of land, and to fix the proportion of that 
amount that each ought to pay to the government.
3. To settle 
an equivalent for the proportion so fixed, in money.
For the first 
purpose, Akber estabHshed a uniform standard to supersede the 
various measures formerly employed even by public officers.
He 
also improved the instruments of mensuration, and he then deputed 
persons to make a complete measurement of all the lands capable 
of cultivation within the empire.
As lands of equal fertility might be differently circumstanced in 
other respects, the following classification was formed for modifying 
that first mentioned.
Land which never required a fallow, paid 
the full demand after every harvest.
Land which required fallows, 
only paid when under cultivation.
Land which had suffered from 
inundation, etc., or which had been three years out of cultivation, 
and required some expense to reclaim it, paid only two-fifths for 
the first year, but went on increasing till the fifth year, when it 
paid the full demand.
11 
Land which had been more than five years out of cultivation, 
enjoyed still more favourable terms for the first four years.
It is 
not explained in the Ayeen Akbery how the comparative fertility 
of fields were ascertained.
It is probable that three classes were 
formed for each village, in consultation with the inhabitants ; and 
the process would be greatly facilitated by another classification 
made by the villagers for their own use, which seems to have 
subsisted from time immemorial.
By that distribution, all the 
land of each village is divided into a great many classes, according 
to its qualities ; as black mould, red mould, gravelly, black mould 
mixed with stones, etc.; other circumstances are also considered, 
such as command of water, vicinity to the village, etc.; and great 
pains are taken so to apportion the diff"erent descriptions among 
the cultivators, and to give equal advantages to all.
The quantity of produce due to the government being settled, 
it was next to be commuted for a money payment.
For this 
purpose, statements of prices current for the nineteen years 
preceding the survey, were called for from every town and village; 
and the produce was turned into money according to the average 
of the rates shown in these statements.
The commutation was 
occasionally reconsidered, with reference to the actual market 
prices ; and every husbandman was allowed to pay in kind, if he 
thought the money rate was fixed too high.
The result of these 
measures was to reduce the amount of the public demand con- 
siderably, but to diminish the defalcation in realizing it ; so that 
the profit to the state remained nearly the same, while the pressure 
on individuals was much lessened.
The Ayeen Akbery, or the Institutes of Akber, was translated 
from the Persian by Francis Gladwin, and published at Calcutta, 
1783, in three volumes, and is now a scarce and dear book.
It 
contains a Survey of the Kingdom, notices of Natural History, a 
complete account of the Civil and Military administration, and 
descends to the minutest details of the royal household — to the 
allowance of flesh per diem to the tame leopards, and the prices 
to be given for rubbers and curry-combs in the royal stables.
From the Mint, and the Treasury, down to the fruit, perfumery, 
12 
and fiower offices, the Kitchen, and the Kennel.
The whole 
presents an astonishing picture of magnificence and good order 
where unwieldy numbers are managed without disturbance, and 
economy is attended to in the midst of profusion.
The following extracts may amuse : — 
OF BREAD.
" Bread is prepared in the pantry.
The largest kind, which is 
baked in an oven, is made of ten seers of flour, five seers of milk, 
one-and-a-half seers of ghee, and one quarter of a seer of salt.
Smaller ones are also made of this dough.
Others, which are 
baked on an iron plate, are sixteen, and sometimes more, to a 
seer.
There is likewise another kind called cheputy, which are 
made of Rhashkeh." 
THE SUSYANEH; or TIMES FOR ABSTAINING FROM FLESH.
" His Majesty has a great disinclination for flesh, and he 
frequently says, 'Providence has provided variety of food for man, 
but, through ignorance and gluttony, he destroys living creatures, 
and makes his body a tomb for beasts.' If I were not a king, I 
would leave off eating flesh at once ; and now it is my intention to 
quit it by degrees.' " 
After this quotation of the Emperor's saying, the days and times 
of abstinence are specified ; which, in Akber's case, made up one- 
fourth of the whole year.
THE KITCHEN.
" The copper utensils for His Majesty's use are tinned twice in 
a month ; and those ot the princes and haram only once in that 
time.
Whatever copper utensils are broken, are given to the 
braziers, who make new ones." 
REGULATIONS FOR THE ILLUMINATIONS.
"The palace is, however, illuminated \vithinside and without 
with flambeaus fixed upon poles with iron prongs.
The first, 
second, and third nights of the moon, when there is but little 
13 
moonlight, the prongs are lighted with eight flambeaus.
From the 
fourth to the tenth, they decrease one in number every night, so 
that on the tenth night, when the moon shines very bright, one 
flambeau is sufficient.
And they continue in this state till the 
fifteenth, and increase every day from the sixteenth to the nine- 
teenth.
On the twentieth they continue the same ; and on the 
twenty-first and twenty-second increase one daily.
The twenty- 
third is the same as the twenty-second ; and from the twenty -fourth 
to thirtieth night of the moon, eight prongs are lighted up.
For 
each link are allowed one seer and a half of oil, and half a seer of 
rags, more or less, according to size.
In some places they burn 
lamps with grease ; but in the palace nothing is used but oil.
" In order to render the royal camp conspicuous to those who 
came from far.
His Majesty has caused to be erected, in the front 
of the Dowlet Khanah, a pole upwards of forty yards high, which 
is supported by sixteen ropes, and from the top of the pole is 
suspended a large lantern, which they call the Akassdeeah." 
THE READER.
" Every day some capable person reads to His Majesty, who 
hears every book from beginning to end.
He always marks with 
the date of the month the place where he leaves off; and the 
reader is paid according to the number of pages.
There is hardly 
a work of Science, of Genius, or of History, but has been read to 
His Majesty ; and he is not tired of hearing them repeated, but 
always listens with great avidity." 
THE CEREMONY OF WEIGHING THE ROYAL PERSON.
"As a means of bestowing a largess upon the indigent, the 
royal person is weighed twice a year, various articles being put 
into the opposite scale.
The first time of performing this ceremony 
is on the first day of the Persian month Aban (October), which is 
the solar anniversary of His Majesty's birthday.
He is then 
weighed twelve times, against the following articles: — Gold, 
Quicksilver, raw Silk, artificial Perfumes, Musk, Roohtooteea, 
intoxicating Drugs, Ghee, Iron, Rice, Milk, eight kinds of Grain, 
14 
and Salt.
And at the same time, according to the years that His 
Majesty has lived, there are given away a like number of sheep, of 
goats, and of fowls, to people who keep these animals for the 
purpose of breeding.
A great number of wild birds of all kinds 
are also set at liberty on this occasion." 
HIS COURT.
Akber's court was perhaps the most magnificent in the world.
It was the most gorgeous that even India had ever seen ; and 
when the details of it, as given by Sir Thomas Roe, Hawkins, 
Bernier, and the Portuguese priests, which cannot be questioned 
as to accuracy or truth, are considered, it must be admitted that 
splendour, whether in jewels and ornaments, in costume and 
decoration, in cloth of gold and velvet, and the gorgeous manu- 
factures of the country ; in camp and hunting equipage, elephants, 
horses, and general equipment of the nobility and army, could go 
no further.
Akber had a revenue of ;^3o,ooo,ooo sterling a year, which, 
without any reckless extravagance, was royally expended ; as was 
proved by the State Treasury at his death, which contained only 
^10,000,000 sterling, with some bullion.
He was never in debt, 
and the stipends of his civil establishments of all kinds, as well as 
the pay of his army, were disbursed with the utmost regularity.
HIS PERSONAL APPEARANCE.
Akber is described as a strongly built and handsome man, with 
an agreeable expression of countenance, and very • captivating 
manners.
He was endowed with great personal strength and 
activity.
He was always satisfied with very little sleep, and 
frequently spent whole nights in those philosophical discussions of 
which he was so fond.
Although so constantly engaged in wars, 
and although he made greater improvements in civil government 
than any other king of India, yet, by his judicious distribution of 
his time, and by his talents for the dispatch of business, he always 
enjoyed abundant leisure for study and amusement.
He was fond 
of witnessing fights of animals, and all exercises of strength and skill.
15 
He took pleasure in breaking horses, and in hunting, especially in 
cases like tlie destruction of tigers, or the capture of herds of wild 
elephants, which gave a scope to his enjoyment of adventure and 
exertion.
He sometimes also underwent fatigue for the mere 
pleasure of the exercise, as when he rode from Ajmir to Agra, 
two hundred and twenty miles, in two successive days, and in 
many similar journeys on horseback, besides walks on foot of 
thirty or forty miles in a day.
His history is filled with instances of romantic courage, and he 
seems to have been stimulated by a sort of instinctive love of 
danger as often as by any rational motive.
Yet he showed no 
fondness for war.
He was always ready to take the field and 
remain there, while his presence was required ; but when the fate 
of the war was once decided, he returned to the general govern- 
ment of his empire, and left it to his lieutenants to carry on the 
remaining military operations.
These were, in some cases, very 
long protracted; but his conquests, when concluded, were complete; 
and no part of India, except that near the capital, can be said to 
have been thoroughly subdued until his time.
At his death, the population of his empire can hardly have been 
less than 150,000,000, and may have been more; and there is no 
instance in the world's history of such a kindgom having been 
won, not only with so small an amount of human suffering, but 
with so positive relief from oppression ; and the more his acts, his 
policy, and his disposition, in all their generosity and humanity, 
are studied and understood, the stronger will be the conviction that 
Akber stands alone.
HIS LAST MOMENTS.
The last moments of Akber are only recorded by his successor, 
his son Selim, afterwards the emperor Jehanger.
Owing to intrigues that were going on against him, Selim was 
justly alarmed for his personal safety, and forbore visiting the 
palace on pretence of illness.
Akber was distressed by his son's 
absence, of which he surmised the cause.
He repeatedly expressed 
his anxiety to see him, and again pronounced him the lawful 
16 
successor to the kingdom.
When Selim at length went to the 
palace, he was affectionately received by the dying monarch.
Akber desired him to bring all the chief men into the chamber 
where he was lying ; "for," said he, " I cannot bear that any 
misunderstanding should subsist between you and those who have, 
for so many years, shared in my toils and been the companions of 
my glory." 
When they were assembled, he delivered a suitable address to 
them; and, after wistfully regarding them all round, he desired 
them to forgive any offences of which he might have been guilty 
towards any of them.
Selim now threw himself at his feet, and 
burst into a passion of tears ; but Akber pointed to his favourite 
scimitar, and made signs to his son to bind it on in his presence.
He seems afterwards to have recovered from this exhaustion ; he 
addressed himself to Selim, and earnestly conjured him to look to 
the comfort of the ladies of his family, and not to forget or forsake 
his old friends and dependants.
After this he permitted one of 
the chief Mullahs, who was a personal friend of Selim's, to be 
brought to him, and in his presence he repeated the Mahometan 
Confession of Faith, and died in all the forms of a good Mussul- 
man.
Mr. Cowell, late Princpal of Sanscrit at the College at 
Calcutta, thinks the account of his return to Mahometanism very 
doubtful.
To those fond of speculations on various forms of government, 
and comparisons as to their respective merits, Akber's reign has 
great interest, as his was the most perfect despotism ever seen.
The natives of India at the present day, when they criticise our 
government, call it a government of seals and parchment.
To an up-country native, it seems surprising that when he comes 
to a judge, or man in authority, on an apparently simple matter, 
when he knows that the judge is implicitly honest and highly 
intelligent, that the matter should not be settled then and there 
out of hand.
The delay, the forms and parchments to be consulted 
and complied with, seem to him only so many fetters on a good 
man's power and will.
To such, a government like Akber's is the ideal of perfection.
17 
Just and strong, with no vested rights, which, as a modern writer 
has said, "are sometimes vested wrongs," to interfere with its 
justice and its strength.
Yet, if one would turn to Akber to prove 
the merits of despotism, its weakness is no less there apparent.
The splendid system that he had raised, and which depended 
upon his unique goodness and ability, fell away after his death ; 
and fifty years after that event, in the reign of the bigot Aurang- 
zebe, religious persecution was as rife and cruel as ever.
Thus we 
see that human liberty and progress are best secured by laws and 
forms, though at times these seem themselves to bar the way towards 
rapid improvement and advance.

THE PUBLIC WATER SUPPLIES OF WEST 
CUMBERLAND.
By ARCHIBALD KITCHIN, F.I.C, F.C.S., &c, 
(Read at the Workington Annual Meeting.
) 
In these days of sanitary reform, the eyes of all classes of society 
are being slowly opened to the fact, that health depends, in no 
small degree, on the purity of the water they drink.
I am happy to say, that we in West Cumberland are fully 
cognizant of this very important truth ; and our local authorities 
have not been behind-hand in utilising those vast natural resources 
of singularly pure water, which are situated so near to us.
The object of this paper is, to give a brief description of the 
various Public Water Supplies of West Cumberland, and to place 
before you the results of the analyses of the waters.
The number of towns, or districts, in the western division of our 
county, which possess public water supplies, are eight, namely : — 
Whitehaven, Workington, Cockermouth, Maryport, Keswick, 
Millom, Cleator Moor, and Arlecdon.
The works for the last 
named district are, however, not yet completed.
For the following 
description of the sources of the various supplies, I am largely 
indebted to Mr. Pickering of Whitehaven.
Whitehaven.
— The Whitehaven water is brought, by gravitation, 
from Ennerdale Lake^ which is nine-and-a-half miles distant from 
20 
the town, and three hundred and seventy feet above the sea level.
The water is but slightly filtered through a rough gravel medium.
The underlying and exposed rocks of the gathering ground are, 
syenitic granite, Skiddaw Slate (Lower Silurian), and the Borrow- 
dale Series of volcanic rocks.
About one-tenth of the gathering 
ground is partially cultivated ; the rest is mountain pasture, and 
bare rocks.
Workington and Cockermouth.
— The Crummock Water 
scheme has been carried out, to supply the towns of Workington 
and Cockermouth, and a large district, embracing four different 
local authorities, namely : — (i) The Cockermouth Urban District, 
(2) The Workington Urban District, (3) The Rural Sanitary 
Authority's District of the Cockermouth Union, and (4) A portion 
of the Rural Sanitary Authority's District of the Whitehaven 
Union, including the parishes of Distington and Harrington, the 
water being brought as far as Lowca, near Whitehaven — a distance 
of twenty-three miles from the lake, by way of Cockermouth and 
Stainburn.
Crummock Lake, from which the water is taken, is the lowest 
of a chain of lakes, comprising Buttermere, Loweswater, and 
Crummock.
It is three hundred and twenty feet above the sea 
level.
The gathering ground is mostly composed of the highest 
mountains, of which about nineteen-twentieths is mountain pasture 
and woodland, and one-twentieth arable and meadow land.
The 
underlying rocks are, like the Ennerdale valley, chiefly Skiddaw 
Slate, the Borrowdale Series of volcanic rocks, and syenitic granite.
The water is neither filtered nor screened.
The sample for analysis 
was collected at Workington.
Maryport.
— This supply is pumped up from the river Derwent, 
at the Goat Mill, near Cockermouth.
It is lifted two hundred 
and twenty feet into filtering beds, near Bridekirk, passed through 
ordinary sand filters, and then conveyed, by gravitation, eight 
miles to Maryport, the service reservoir being at Hayborough.
The outside parishes of Flimby, Ellenborough, and Dearham, 
^re also supplied with this water, The river Derwent drains the 
largest valleys in tlie Lake District, including the Borrowdale, 
Nevvlands, and Greta valleys.
It receives the overflow of Thirl- 
mere and Derwentwater Lakes, and in its course passes through 
Bassenthwaite Water.
The underlying rocks of the gathering ground are Skiddaw 
Slate, the Volcanic Series of Borrowdale, and small patches of Old 
Red Sandstone Conglomerate, and Carboniferous Limestone.
Perhaps three-fourths of the ground is mountain pasture, and 
one-fourth woodland, arable, and meadow land.
A portion of 
sewage gets into the Derwent from the town of Keswick, and from 
villages such as Portinscale, Braithwaite, etc.
Keswick.
— The Keswick supply is obtained from the southern 
slopes of Skiddaw.
The ground is nearly all mountain pasture, 
the substrata being Skiddaw Slate.
The water is conveyed one- 
and-a-half miles, by gravitation.
MiLLOM.
— This water supply is collected by placing a dam 
across Whicham Beck, which drains the south-eastern flank of 
Whitecombe mountain.
The water is not filtered, but screened 
only.
The underlying rocks are exclusively Silurian slates, and 
the gathering ground is about four-fifths mountain pasture, and 
one-fifth arable land.
The water is brought five-and-a-half miles, 
by gravitation.
Cleator Moor.
— The water is collected from the northern and 
eastern flanks of the mountain Dent, contiguous to the Cleator 
Moor district.
It is obtained partly from springs, and partly from 
surface water.
It is not filtered, but put through fine screens.
The gathering ground is chiefly mountain pasture, with the excep- 
tion of about one-twentieth part, which is under tillage.
The 
substrata are Skiddaw Slate.
The reservoir is situated on the 
slope of the mountain, about four hundred and fifty feet above 
sea level, from which the water is conveyed by gravitation.
Arlecdon.
— It is intended to bring the water for this district 
from Cogra valley, situated between Murton Fell, Blake Fell, and 
Middle Fell.
A reservoir is being constructed, at an elevation of 
22 
about seven hundred and fifty feet above sea level.
The gathering 
ground is chiefly mountain pasture and bare rocks, the substrata 
being Skiddaw Slate.
The sample of water for analysis was 
obtained from the principal spring, above the site of the reservoir.
We shall now turn to the consideration of the analyses of these 
waters, a copy of which I have placed before you.
The impurities in water which may be wholly dissolved, or 
partially dissolved and partially suspended, consist of two kinds, 
namely, "inorganic," or mineral matter; and "organic," vegetable, 
or animal matter.
The former, if free from poisonous metals, and 
present in not too large a quantity, can do no harm.
The 
"organic" matter, however, if derived from sewage, may contain 
germs of those fatal diseases — Cholera, Typhoid fever, etc.
It is 
therefore to the organic matter in the water, we must turn, in order 
to arrive at a conclusion as to its fitness for domestic use.
And 
those who are acquainted with the most recent sanitary knowledge, 
are aware that it is the quality, rather than the absolute quantity 
of organic matter present, that is the most important factor in 
determining the wholesomeness of drinking water.
Unfortunately, 
no process is known by which we can determine chemically the 
presence of these disease germs ; and the microscope fails to 
reveal them.
This much we do know, however — these germs are 
always associated with animal organic matter, never with pure 
vegetable organic matter.
A water may therefore contain large quantities of vegetable 
organic matter, such as peat, and yet be quite wholesome; whereas 
a very small quantity of animal organic matter must condemn it.
But how are we to know to which class the organic matter may 
belong?
We cannot even determine, with certainty, the total 
amount of organic matter a water may contain, much less can we 
be sure of its nature.
At the best, we can only apply certain 
tests, or determine the amount of certain constituents.
Drs. Frankland and Armstrong devised a method, some years 
ago, for the determination of the amount of Carbon and Nitrogen 
in the organic matter of water ; for, knowing the relative quantities 
of these two elements, gives some insight as to the origin of the 
23 
organic matter.
This method has, however, gained but little 
favour amongst analysts ; for, without taking into account the fact 
that it involves specially devised apjiaratus, and requires very 
complicated and tedious manipulation, it has this fatal objection — 
that it is possible for the very organic matter we are seeking, to be 
more or less destroyed, or lost, at an early stage of the operation.
The results obtained by this process cannot therefore be viewed 
with any degree of satisfaction.
Another method, and one which I have adopted in this inquiry, 
called the " Ammonia Process," was devised by Messrs.
Wanklyn 
and Smith, in 1867, and is intended to give us an insight as to the 
nature of the organic impurity, from the amount of ammonia 
yielded by the water, under certain conditions ; this "Albuminoid 
Ammonia," as it is called, along with the amount of "free 
Ammonia," and of Chlorine, being considered by the authors to 
afford sufficient data for the determination of the character of the 
water.
This process is just as remarkable for its simplicity, as the 
former is for its intricacy ; nevertheless, the utmost care is required 
in conducting the experiment, in order to prevent the introduction 
of serious error.
It has gained great favour in the eyes of analysts, 
and is a process usually adopted by them in water analysis.
I consider, however, that Wanklyn's process should never be 
taken by itself, as a criterion of the quality of a water.
Many 
mistakes may arise, and have arisen, by doing so.
Some waters, 
known to be bad, have yielded little "Albuminoid Ammonia,'" 
and good waters have sometimes yielded much.
But we have another test we can apply, that is, to see what 
amount of Oxygen is absorbed by the organic matter, in a certain 
time.
Organic matter very readily takes up Oxygen, when that 
element is presented to it in a certain manner.
All that is required 
then, is to determine the amount of Oxygen absorbed by the water, 
in order to arrive at some idea of the quantity of organic matter 
present.
The amount of Chlorine, due to common salt, which is always 
high when sewage is present ; also the amount of Nitric Acid, 
24 
which may have been produced by the oxydation of the Nitrogen 
in the organic matter, and of Phosphoric Acid, are valuable data.
The appearance of the water, when viewed through a thickness 
of two feet, is most important, as giving us an insight into the 
origin of the organic matter.
If the water has a peaty colour, we 
•judge that the organic matter is, in great measure, due to dissolved 
peat ; if the colour is yellow, the organic matter must be viewed 
with suspicion!
The smell of the water, when warmed and shaken up, is also 
often a valuable guide ; and the microscopical examination of the 
deposits of the utmost importance.
These data, along with the total solid matter, and hardness, 
before and after boiling, complete our analysis.
You will notice, on reference to the Table (pp.
28, 29), that tAvo 
samples of the Whitehaven water have been analysed.
These 
samples were collected by myself at an interval of a month.
The 
rest of the samples were collected, by various gentleman, on the 
dates named, and according to written instructions.
Now a glance at the Table, by any one acquainted with water 
analysis, would be sufificient to enable him to come to the con- 
clusion that the waters, on the whole, are remarkably pure.
The "total soHd matter" in five of the samples is only about 
two grains in the gallon ; and in none does it reach five grains.
This is due to the absence of lime in the substrata of the various 
gathering grounds.
And, for a like reason, the "hardness" is in 
many cases below one degree, and permanent in all.
Coming now to the other end of the Table, we find only one of 
the samples possessed any smell, namely, the Milloni water.
When viewed through a two-foot tube, all the waters appeared 
clear, and satisfactory, with the exception of those from Maryport 
and Millom, which were very turbid, and of a yellowish colour.
The colours of the Keswick and Arlecdon waters were almost 
identical with that of pure distilled water.
The Whitehaven water 
was a little more green ; and the Cleator Moor water, more gi'een 
still.
The Chlorine was, in all cases, small in amount, being the 
highest in the samples from Millom and Cleator Moor ; but in no 
case was it sufficiently high to indicate, of itself, drainage contami- 
nation.
Phosphoric Acid was present in all, except the Whiteliaven 
and Arlecdon waters; heavy traces were found in those of Maryport 
and Cleator Moor.
Nitric Acid was, like the Chlorine, also small 
in amount; the Millom and Cleator Moor waters being again 
those which contained the most.
The Ammonia was also small 
in quantity : the Whitehaven and Keswick samples containing 
none.
The quantity of Albuminoid Ammonia is in no instance 
large, although Millom and Cleator Moor are again favoured, and 
Maryport is not far behind.
We find that no Oxygen is absorbed 
by any of the waters in two minutes.
The amount absorbed in 
four hours is greatest in those of Maryport, Millom, and Cleator 
Moor.
Lastly, the microscope revealed vegetable debris and 
Diatoms in nearly all ; and moving organisms were found in the 
Millom water.
By placing a certain value upon each of the constituents thus 
determined, as suggested by the "Water Committee" of the Society 
of Public Analysts, we obtain a sum which enables us to classify 
the waters, with comparative ease ; of course, the lower numbers 
denote the purer waters.
They are arrived at in the following 
manner.
The smell may be valued from o to 8.
The appearance, from o to 4.
And 
The microscopical appearance of the deposit, from o to 10, 
according to the discretion of the analyst.
The Chlorine found is multiplied by 2.
The Phosphoric Acid traces are valued at 2 ; heavy traces, at 4 
very heavy traces, at 8.
The Nitrogen, as Nitrates, is multiplied by 10.
The Ammonia is multiplied by 200.
The Albuminoid Ammonia is multiplied by 1000.
The Oxygen absorbed in two minutes is multiplied by 500.
The Oxygen absorbed in four hours is multiplied by 100.
The Hardness, before and after boiling, are added together, 
and then divided by 5.
The Total solid matter is divided by 5.
26 
I have placed the sum of the numbers so obtained, under the 
head of "Vakiation." 
We find that the sample of Whitehaven water collected on 
April 4th, stands first, with a valuation of 5 ; Arlecdon is valued 
at 7 ; Keswick, at 9 ; Whitehaven, March sample, 10 ; Work- 
ington, 15; Cleator Moor, 24; Maryport, 30; and Millom, 35.
It would, however, be very unfair for us to come to a conclusion 
regarding the character of a water supply, from the results of a 
single analysis.
There are various causes which, as doubtless you 
all know, affect the purity of the water at different seasons, such 
as rain, snow, frost, freshly manured land, and the like.
I think it is a great mistake that none of the waters are properly 
filtered, as the character of the whole of them might in this way be 
much improved, and the disturbing effects, produced by the above 
causes, to a large extent neutralized.
I may mention, that a sample of Whitehaven water collected on 
February loth, was slightly turbid, and contained moving organisms.
Its valuation stood as high as 17.
Another sample, taken for 
analysis on the 5th of the present month (May), received a valuation 
of 7 ; and yesterday, a sample was drawn, and examined in the two- 
foot tube, when it was found to be slightly turbid; this was doubtless 
due to the heavy rain of the day before.
You will notice some 
little difference, also, in the analyses of the two samples of White- 
haven water placed before you.
Now, it is quite possible that the 
Millom, Maryport, and Cleator Moor waters were collected at a 
time when some one or more of these disturbing elements were in 
operation.
In fact, any of these waters may have been at its very 
worst on the day the sample was taken ; and the others may have 
been at their best.
It is therefore necessary that frequent analyses should be made, 
say once or twice a month, for at least a period of a year ; and 
that the mean of the results so obtained, should be taken to 
represent the average nature of the supply.
And further, I consider that it is the duty of our Local Authorities 
to arrange for such a system of periodical examination of the various 
Public Water supplies.
For in this way, much valuable information 
27 
might be obtained, and the general pubHc would perhaps be 
induced to take a greater interest in the matter.
In conclusion, I must thank those gentlemen who have so 
kindly assisted me in this inquiry, by collecting and forwarding me 
the various samples of water.

THE GRASSES OF MID-CUMBERLAND.
By Wm. HODGSON.
(Read at th( Workington Annttal Meeting.) 
When I was first invited to contribute a botanical paper for the 
present meeting, it was intimated to me that the flowering plants 
of the West Cumberland district would be amply cared for by my 
friend Mr. Adair of Whitehaven, but that it was desirable that 
some notice should also be taken of the Grasses, Sedges, Mosses, 
etc., indigenous to the County.
Here a wide field was certainly 
offered ; and after some deliberation, I decided to confine my 
remarks to the Gramineae of Mid-Cumberland, choosing this title 
for the obvious reason that, though my rambles in the pursuit of 
general Botany have been both frequent and extensive, there yet 
remain two large tracts of my native county which I have had no 
opportunity of exploring.
Northward of the River Eden, and 
southward of the River Ehen, remain to me a sort of terra incognita, 
or unknown land.
I ought also to mention that the Grasses have 
not been specially studied; but only came in for their share of 
notice with other botanical productions of the districts examined.
Next occurred the question, how can such a paper be drawn up 
in a manner calculated to be of permanent service to the Associ- 
ation, or to the agricultural portion of the community outside its 
limits ?
It cannot fail to have struck even a casual observer, that 
of late years a much larger proportion of the surface of Cumberland 
has been applied to grazing purposes, than was the case thirty or 
forty years ago — that horn is ascending, and corn descending in 
the scale.
Such being the case, it becomes a matter of serious 
32 
consideration, how the quahty of the herbage of our meadows and 
pastures can be improved, by disestabUshing inferior grasses, 
sedges, rushes, etc., and substituting in Heu thereof, a "swarth" 
composed of more serviceable and nutritious species.
He has 
been justly held as a public benefactor, who could produce two 
blades of grass where only one grew before ; and I apprehend that 
he who could be instrumental in bringing about the change I have 
indicated, would be treading closely upon that individual's heels.
Being neither a chemist nor a farmer, I have sought information 
as to the comparative produce and feeding properties of the 
different grasses in the pages of the Hortus Graniineiis Woburnensis 
which contains the full record of a series of exhaustive and care- 
fully-conducted experiments made at Woburn Abbey by Mr.
Sinclair, gardener to the Duke of Bedford, early in the present 
century.
The weight and qualities of only the superior grasses 
will be touched upon here ; the others will have merely a passing 
notice of their habitats or characteristic modes of growth, as the 
result of personal examination.
The order observed will be that 
of the authorised Lo7idon Catalogue of British Plants, 7 th edition, 
1877.
First in this list of the grasses undoubtedly indigenous here, is 
Anthoxanthwn odoratum, the Sweet-scented Vernal Grass.
It is of almost universal growth ; hardly a field in the county is 
without it.
Its chief recommendation is its early growth.
Culti- 
vated alone, it does not succeed ; but it is eminently serviceable in 
forming a good turf when used in combination with other grasses.
To this grass is chiefly attributed the agreeable odour of newly- 
mown hay.
The comparative weight per acre of this and other 
grasses, when in flower, will be found appended to this paper.
Phalaris, or Digraphis, arundinacea.
Reed Canary-grass.
A tall and coarse-looking grass, frequently five or six feet high ; 
found pretty generally in swampy places, by the edges of rivers 
and lakes.
Of little value.
The common "ladies' garters" of 
cottage gardens is a striped variety of this species.
Canary-seed 
33 
is the produce of a kindred species, which sometimes springs up 
where bird cages have been cleaned.
Alopecurus agrestis.
Slender Foxtail-grass.
A most pernicious weed, and great pest of southern farmers, 
who call it "black bent." Fortunately it is of rare occurrence 
here.
I never saw it in a growing state except on the ballast-hills 
at Silloth, and there only in trivial quantity.
Alopecurus geniciilatus.
Floating Foxtail-grass.
Commonly found in moist places, about the edges of pools, and 
places where water has stood during winter.
Even where it is the 
staple of the herbage, it seems to be little relished by either cattle 
or sheep.
Its nutritive quality is inferior.
Alopecurus pratensis.
Meadow Foxtail-grass.
This grass forms a constituent in most of our richest natural 
pastures, and is remarkably early in flowering.
I have seen its 
flower-spikes well developed on the 24Lh April, growing in tufts in 
the Railway Cutting, near Aspatria, when no other grass had even 
sprouted.
One of the most nutritious of our grasses ; and would 
probably have come extensively into cultivation, but for one draw- 
back — it does not attain to its fullest produce much under four 
years' growth.
Phleunt pratense.
Meadow Cat's-tail-grass.
Better known locally as Timothy-grass.
A very valuable grass, 
frequently the object of cultivation.
Like the foregoing, its feeding 
qualities are excellent ; and when the seed is ripe, are at their 
fullest development, which is seldom the case with other grasses.
Though forming superior hay, the aftermath is inconsiderable.
Phleum arenarium.
Sea Timothy-grass.
A slender, insignificant-looking member of the Cat's-tail family ; 
seldom more than six inches high ; which I have observed along 
the shore, at intervals, from Silloth to Whitehaven.
Sesleria car idea.
Blue Moor-grass.
Abundant about Fell-End and the Side woods in Ennerdale, 
34 
also at Moorside Hall, Arlecdon — in black-topped soil of mossy 
character.
"The best of the Alpine grasses," in Mr. Sinclair's 
estimation.
It is said to be particularly agreeable to sheep.
Its 
roots have a powerful hold on the soil.
Agrostis spica-venti.
Silky Bent-grass.
A very elegant grass, of rare occurrence in Cumberland.
I have 
only seen it on the Silloth ballast-bank, though it grows plentifully 
in sandy ground in the south of England.
Agrostis canina.
Brown Bent-grass.
The Agrostis family are in general backward in flowering ; and 
in moist pastures, especially towards the mountains, constitute the 
bulk of the gramineous herbage in Autumn.
The present species 
does not bear a very high character for its nutritious properties.
Its flower-spikes are very pretty objects, especially when the spikelets 
are covered with the purple anthers.
Agrostis alba.
Marsh Bent-grass.
Common enough in some parts of the county; though far less 
generally distributed than either A.
canina or A.
vulgaris.
It is of 
frequent occurrence about Aspatria ; and yet I have never observed 
it in my present neighbourhood.
A late and somewhat unpro- 
ductive grass, the roots of which are alleged greatly to exhaust the 
soil.
Agrostis vulgaris.
Common Bent-grass.
This is one of the most common grasses in natural sandy pastures.
It flowers earlier than any of its congeners, but is inferior to several 
of them in weight of produce, as also in nutritive quality.
A dwarf 
variety of this species, known as Agrostis piimila, has been noticed 
growing about the Roman Camp on Caer-mote ; also on Matter- 
dale Common, near Mosedale BecL 
Psatnma arenaria.
Sea-bent.
All sea-side folk know this plant, which is everywhere abundant 
along the shore.
It is of trifling value as cattle food.
Its great 
Utility is in binding the sands of the sea-shore, to protect the banks 
35 
against the encroachments of the tide.
It has been protected, so to 
speak, by several enactments which forbade its removal or destruc- 
tion under severe penalties, from which the people of Cumberland 
were specially exempted.
Phragtnitis communis.
Common Reed.
Growing about the banks of ponds and rivers ; sometimes 
exceeding seven feet in height ; with stout, tall, and leafy stems.
By the river Ellen, near BuUgill ; in Hayton meadows, near 
Aspatria, etc.
Its elegant flower-spikes, stuck into vases, are 
frequently used as mantel-piece ornaments by cottagers.
Milium effusum.
Spreading Millet-grass.
One of our rarer gramineae, affecting the shadow of deep um- 
brageous covers.
Growing in some abundance in FUmby wood.
Last summer I noticed it also in the Lowther Castle woods, near 
Askham Bridge.
Aira coespitosa.
Tufted Hair-grass.
A coarse-looking and altogether a worthless grass, too familiar 
to local farmers as "buU-toppins." Supreme necessity alone will 
induce cattle to touch it.
Even the wild rabbit avoids it ; and 
I am persuaded that gentlemen who unduly encourage that 
mischievous little rodent, have to be responsible for the great 
prevalence of this plant in their covers, to the exclusion of better 
grasses, which being closely cropped down, are promptly smothered 
by this aggressive grass.
Aira flexuosa.
Wavy Hair-grass.
A rather elegant grass, commonly met with on some of our best 
mountain pastures.
Growing about a foot to eighteen inches high ; 
slender, upright, and very smooth.
The term wavy well indicates 
the flexuous zig-zag character of the spikelets, which are very 
ornamental.
Sheep appear to relish this grass, cropping it quite 
closely.
I have seen fine specimens about Howth Ghyll, and 
similar places near Frizington.
36 
Aira caryophyllea.
Silver Hair-grass.
Insignificant in bulk, though decidedly pretty.
This grass is 
probably of slight value.
It grows not unfrequently on dry sandy 
or gravelly banks, even where not overburdened with soil.
^ It is 
about six or eight inches high, and may be distinguished by the 
sheen of its bright silvery spikes.
Aira prmcox.
Early Hair-grass.
More dwarfish in habit than the preceding.
In light sandy 
ground, frequent.
It is specially abundant in some of the sea-side 
fields below Coulderton.
Probably the least of our local grasses ; 
seldom exceeding four or five inches in height.
Avenaflavescens.
Yellow Oat-grass.
In all our best meadows and pasture lands a frequent constituent.
Like the Vernal Grass, it is not adapted for cultivation by itself.
The weight of its produce is but moderate ; and it owes its value 
chiefly to the bitter extractive which its leaves contain.
I once 
found a most elegant variety of this grass in a railway cutting near 
Baggrow.
Avena pratensis.
Narrow-leaved Oat-grass.
A local rather than a rare species, with which I was unfamiliar 
until within the last few years.
I have seen it growing in the 
railway cuttings southward of St. Bees, and in several parts of 
Leath Ward, towards Penrith.
Although of more robust habit 
than A.
Jlavescens, it is reputed to be inferior in feeding properties 
to that grass.
Avena elaiior.
Tall Oat-like Soft-grass.
This is one of our larger and more robust grasses, as it is also 
one of the most abundant and widely distributed.
Its produce 
per acre far exceeds the average in weight, but its nutritive matter 
is extremely sahne and bitter; hence it cannot be cultivated 
separately with advantage.
A bulbous-rooted type of this species 
is familiarly designated "button-twitch," in some parts of Cumber- 
land.
37 
Holms lanatus.
Woolly Soft -grass.
"Yorkshire Fog." A very common grass on every kind of soil; 
but so coarse that cattle shun it as a rule.
When made into hay, 
it is extremely light and spongy to the touch.
When dried in the 
press, too, it is limp and flimsy..
A decidedly inferior grass.
Hole us mollis.
Creeping Soft-grass.
Not unlike the preceding, but less abundant, and generally seen 
about the edges of woods and hedgerows.
Distinguished from the 
foregoing by its more open and less woolly flower spikes, and by 
its powerfully creeping root.
Only grown to perfection in light, 
barren, sandy soils.
Superior in most respects to "Yorkshire 
Fog," but objectionable on account of its "twitchy" roots, although 
these last are held to contain much nutritive matter.
Triodia decumbe7is.
Decumbent Heath-grass.
This grass is chiefly confined to upland undrained meadows and 
pastures, in some of which it is tolerably abundant, being intermixed 
with sedges and other moisture-loving vegetation.
The Woburn 
Abbey experiments upon this grass were unfavourable to it.
It is 
pronounced "but little susceptible of improvement by being trans- 
planted to a richer soil." It is a late grass, and deficient in 
fog-producing qualities.
Kceleria cristata.
Crested Hair-grass.
A slender type of grass, found only on the shore from Cardur- 
nock to St. Bees and Coulderton, sparingly.
Molinia coendea.
Purple Melic-grass.
Found in turfy and sandy bogs.
For pasture or hay compara- 
tively worthless.
In some parts of the kingdom the peasantry 
make neat besoms of the straw, which, as well as the roots, is 
strong and wiry.
Hangingshaw moss, near New Cooper.
Melica nutans.
Mountain Melic-grass.
A rare grass, found only in mountainous regions.
In Gowbarrow 
38 
Woods, Ullswater; also on the Westmorland side of the same 
Lake, near the waterfall on Scale How.
Melica uniflora.
Wood Melic.
More widely distributed than the preceding.
Abundant in dry 
woods, and hedgebanks.
Near Yeathouse Station, &c.
Catabrosa aquatica.
Water Whorl-grass.
Another rare grass, growing in watery places.
In a spring on 
the shore at Coulderton ; also in a brook in Lamplugh Hall Cow- 
pastures.
Glyceria fluitans.
Floating Sweet-grass.
A common aquatic grass ; its leaves frequently floating on the 
surface of pools.
Cattle apparently relish it greatly.
I have seen 
cows standing up to the udders in water, cropping the sweet and 
luxuriant herbage which it produces.
Sckrochloa maritima.
Sea Hard-grass.
Growing sparingly on the shores of the Wampool estuary, near 
Anthorn.
Schlerochloa proctwibens.
Procumbent Hard-grass.
A plant of little economic value, which I found growing upon 
the sea banks and ballast hills about Silloth and elsewhere.
I 
have also observed it on the line of the Solway Junction Railway, 
near Brayton Station, where it was doubtless introduced with the 
ballast used in the formation of the Railway.
Poa annua.
Annual Meadow-grass.
An almost ubiquitous grass; on stone pitchings, pavements, 
waste grounds, gravel walks, etc.
In some parts of the country 
called Suffolk-grass.
Worthless in a great measure to the agricul- 
turist.
Partridges eat the seeds with great avidity.
Poa pratensis.
Smooth-stalked Meadow-grass.
A common and highly esteemed grass ; though better adapted 
39 
for pasture than the scythe.
An objection may be urged against 
it.
Its roots are powerfully creeping, and take firm grasp of the 
soil, as any one may know who has attempted to draw a specimen 
from the top of a turf-covered dry wall, where it is frequently to be 
found, as well as in almost every meadow and pasture.
Poa trivialis.
Rough-stalked Meadow-grass.
This also has the reput^ion of being a valuable grass, for both 
meadow and pasture.
It is generally taller than the foregoing; 
the leaves are of a lighter hue, and rough at the back, as is easily 
proved by rubbing them with the fingers in an upward direction.
Mr. Sinclair says : " The superior produce of this poa over many 
other species ; its highly nutritive qualities ; the seasons in which it 
arrives at perfection ; and the marked partiality which oxen, horses, 
and sheep have for it, are merits which distinguish it as one of the 
most valuable grasses." It is abundant in many parts of the 
County.
Some of the finest specimens I ever saw grew at Routon- 
sike, in Arlecdon.
Briza media.
Common Quaking-grass.
A common grass, which I am persuaded is well known even to 
children in rural districts, who are fond of collecting bouquets of 
"doddering" grass.
One peculiarity of this grass is said to be that 
it succeeds better on poor soils, than those of a more fertile nature.
Its value as a feeding grass is also considerable.
Cynosurus cristaius.
Crested Dog's-tail-grass.
A very common grass, which as a pasture plant especially is held 
to have no superior.
True, the culms known as " windle straes," 
are wiry, and often unsightly ; yet it forms a dense, close turf, of 
grateful nutritive herbage, and is little affected by the extremes of 
weather.
The best hay for horses that comes into the metropolis 
is said to come from the vicinity of Hendon.
C. cristaius is a 
large constituent of this highly esteemed forage.
Dactylis glomerata.
Cock's-foot-grass.
Another very valuable, as it is likewise a very common, grass.
40 
Though the stems are strong, and apparently harsh and dry, they 
are said to possess highly nutritive qualities.
In any field which 
has been subjected to the action of the scythe, Cock's-foot is 
invariably the first to push forth new and vigorous growth ; and 
the aftermath quickly affords a full bite, on which cattle, horses, 
and sheep browse with equal readiness.
Its cultivation has not 
been attempted on any considerable scale within the limits of my 
personal experience.
Festuca myui us.
Wall-fescue : Capon's-tail-grass.
Found on walls and dry barren places.
An inferior, I might 
almost say worthless grass, of rare occurrence.
On the Conglom- 
erate rocks at the foot of Ullswater, by the road leading to Pooley 
Bridge.
On the top of a wall near the Castle Gardens at Work- 
ington.
Festuca brotnoides.
Barren Fescue-grass.
Likewise of rare occurrence.
It grows in coarse sandy soils; 
and though superior to the last mentioned, is of little agricultural 
value.
By the Solway Junction Railway, not far from Brayton 
Station.
Its roots sink deeply into the loose sand.
Festuca ovina.
Sheep's Fescue-grass.
A diminutive but beautiful grass, which forms a chief constituent 
in all our best mountain pastures, where sheep appear to relish it 
greatly.
Though faint praise is all that Mr. Sinclair bestows upon 
it, I am inclined to rate it very highly indeed.
It grows in the 
lowland as well as in the upland parts of this county.
I have 
seen splendid turf of this grass near Dubmill, and in the Railway 
cutting E.
of Aspatria tunnel bridge.
Its fine setaceous leaves 
are of the loveliest green.
Festuca vivipara.
Viviparous Fescue.
Natural to alpine localities, and commonly occurring in rocky 
ravines, especially where perennial moisture serves to keep the 
roots damp.
A curious-looking grass, and a striking exception to 
41 
the general law of nature in the reproduction of plants by their 
seed.
The future plant is developed in the flower spike, which 
ultimately falls to the ground of its own weight, where it soon 
strikes root.
Abundant all over the Lake District.
Festuca duriuscula.
Hard Fescue.
A very common grass, assuming much diversity of appearance 
in size, etc., according to the soil and situation in which it may be 
found.
The flowers are also apt to vary in number.
Distinguished 
from the next by its fibrous^ rather than creeping roots.
On the 
top of walls, sometimes hardly exceeding F.
ovina in stature, 
whereas in light soils, of a fertile nature, it may be found from 
fifteen to eighteen inches high.
The finest I have noticed grew 
in a field by the R.
Ehen, on the Scale-lands Farm, below Friz- 
ington.
An excellent grass, and found in all our richest natural 
pastures.
Its produce is very considerable in bulk, and is remark- 
ably fine and succulent.
It further enjoys the reputation of 
withstanding drought better than the majority of grasses.
Festuca rubra.
Creeping Fescue-grass.
Decidedly inferior to the foregoing, which it greatly resembles 
in appearance ; though far from being plentiful.
Indeed, I have 
seldom noticed it far inland.
It grows on the rugged scaur about 
Redness Point, where its leaves are of a deep glaucous green.
Festuca elatior.
Tall Fescue.
By some writers considered as a coarsely-growing variety of 
Meadow Fescue.
It often grows vigorously on inferior soils, 
especially where clay is more or less present.
This fact, coupled 
with the very nutritive quality of the herbage, would indicate this 
as a desirable plant for cultivation in soils where finer grasses fail.
Unfortunately, its seeds often prove sadly deficient in germinating 
powers, and hence it is neglected.
Large patches of it occur by 
the Furness Railway, not far from Coulderton.
Festuca elatior, v.
arundinacea.
A tall reed-like variety of the preceding, growing to a height of 
42 
four or five feet.
About the old landing-stage at Floshgate, 
Ullswater ; also by the R.
Caldew at Holm-hill.
Festuca pratensis.
Meadow Fescue.
Taken on the whole, one of our most valuable pasture products.
Of larger growth than A duriuscula.
It is found in all our best 
meadows and pastures.
It makes excellent hay; but as its 
nutritive and succulent properties are in perfection at the time of 
flowering, it ought never to be suflfered to ripen its seeds.
As it is 
somewhat late in flowering, there is less risk perhaps of this being 
done.
It is more readily distinguished than many of its genus.
A grand type of the Meadow Fescue grows near Town-end Bridge, 
in the parish of Watermillock.
Bromus giganteus.
Giant Brome-grass.
A coarse species, natural only in woods and coppices.
Not 
very frequently met with.
Its seeds supply food for birds.
Less 
common than the next mentioned.
Near Yeathouse Station, on 
the W.
side of the Railway.
The variety known as triflora occurs 
about Soulby, and in the hedgerows at the foot of Dunmallet, 
Ullswater ; also by the R.
Ehen, below Salter Hall.
Bromus asper.
Hairy Wood-Brome-grass.
A still larger and coarser-looking grass than the preceding.
Abundant in woods all over the district.
Distinguished by the 
long pendulous spikelets and loose panicles of flowers.
Holm-hill 
woods ; Cockshot, near Torpenhow ; Hutton John, etc.
Bromus sterilis.
Barren Brome-grass.
Not unlike the preceding in appearance ; having similar loose 
drooping panicles, though not reaching more than one-third of the 
size of B.
asper.
A worthless species — hardly ever cropped by 
cattle.
Of frequent occuirence in loose sandy soils.
Aspatria, 
Bullgill, Flimby, etc.
Bromus mollis.
Soft Brome-grass.
The "Goose-corn" of the Cumberland farmer.
Of frequent 
43 
occurrence in loose soils, springing up about stack-yards and waste 
ground, and on poor exhausted land that has been subjected to 
over-cropping.
Of no feeding value, and ought to be treated as a 
noxious weed, to be exterminated from the farmer's crops.
But as 
it is an annual, ripening its seeds very early, this is not perhaps 
readily accomplished.
Brachypodium sylvaticum.
Slender False-Brome-grass.
In woods and hedgerows not uncommon.
Has flat and rather 
broad leaves, fringed about the sheaths; and drooping flower- 
spikes, not unlike those of barley.
An inferior grass, worthy only 
of passing notice.
Triticum caninum.
Bearded Wheat-grass.
Distinguished from the following by its awned flower-spikes, and 
its fibrous roots.
In hedgerows and by bushy river banks.
By the 
Caldew, Ellen, Eamont, Petteril, etc.
Triticum repens.
Creeping Wheat-grass.
Of unenviable notoriety as Couch-grass, or "Twitch." The 
culm and leaves of this grass are not in much esteem as nutrients.
Like some of the oat-grasses, they contain too much of the bitter 
ingredient.
Its roots, however, are more saccharine.
And although 
much care is bestowed on their extermination here, they are said 
to be largely used in Italy for feeding horses.
I may note in 
passing, that much of what the Cumbrian farmer designates 
"twitch," consists of the creeping roots of Holcus mollis, Poa 
pratensis, and some of the Bent grasses, as well as those of the 
plant now under notice.
Triticum junceum.
Rushy Sea-wheat-grass.
Found along the Sea-coast from Silloth to Seascale.
This plant 
is of a deep glaucous green hue, and, like the preceding, has 
powerfully creeping roots, with woolly fibres at the joints.
Its 
roots, like those of the Common Bent and of the Carex arenaria, are 
of great service in binding together the shifting sands on the 
sea-shore.
u 
Lolium perenne.
Rye Grass.
This well known grass has been longer in cultivation than any 
other species, and still maintains pre-eminence, although scientific 
experimenters assure us that it is greatly inferior to Cocksfoot, 
Meadow Fescue, or Meadow Foxtail grass, in weight of produce 
and durability ; for whatever may be its merits otherwise, Ryegrass 
is apt to die out at a comparatively early period.
Improved 
varieties have been raised of late years.
It appears indeed almost 
everywhere in the lowland districts.
Lolium temulentum.
Darnel.
Fortunately for Cumberland, the occurrence of this vile weed is 
rare and exceptional.
If not actually poisonous, its seeds are 
extremely hurtful.
Neither beast nor bird will voluntarily eat them.
In comparison with other grass seeds, they are large and heavy.
I never saw this grass in a living state but once, when it grew 
among a crop of Flax, near Aspatria, doubtless introduced with the 
seed.
It is very upright and rigid in habit, and the spikelets of 
seeds, though larger than in the ryegrass, are at greater distances 
apart.
Hordeum maritimum.
Sea Barley.
Another grass that is not strictly indigenous to the district — 
though I have seen it, with other aliens, growing on the ballast 
mounds at Silloth.
A worthless species.
Nardus stricta.
Common Mat-grass.
Moist moorlands and mountainous heathes are the homes of this 
grass.
Higher than Sheep's Fescue, and the Wavy Hair Grass, 
but at a lower elevation than /uncus squarrosus and Common 
Heather, this grass is abundant.
Its florets all point one way — its 
leaves, one to each culm, are bristle like.
In some places the turf 
consists almost entirely of Mat-grass.
Its roots are frequently much 
infested with grubs, and I have observed rooks and starlings pulling 
up large patches of it to arrive at their favorite food.
Its wiry 
nature renders it very difiBcult to cut with the scythe.

Having now exhausted the catalogue in as complete a manner 
as the limited time at my disposal for the work would admit, a few 
brief concluding remarks may not be out of place.
In Bailey, 
CuUey, and Pringle's Survey of the Agriculture of Northumberland, 
Cumberland, and Westmorland, published about 1794, under the 
auspices of the Board of Agriculture of that day, we are told of an 
old farmer at Uldale, who when asked why he and his neighbours 
did not sow artificial grasses more largely, replied : — " Lord, sur, 
we hev' nea 'casion ; oor lan's naterally girs-prood." The prejudice 
against artificial grasses has long since died out — excellent crops of 
'seeds' may be seen around us; but in my opinion our meadows and 
permanent pastures are susceptible of great improvement.
It has 
been too much the fashion to look upon mere bulk, ora 'good swathe' 
without reference to quahty, as the one thing needful.
I have 
endeavoured to distinguish the good from the bad constituents in 
our local turf.
It is satisfactory to know — after an examination of 
the living specimens of grass exhibited by England's most eminent 
seedsmen at the Royal Show in Carlisle last year — that all the finest 
and most valuable species are to be found indigenous around us; 
and it did not escape the notice of the shrewdly intelligent gentle- 
men, to whom was delegated the task of examining our crack farms 
entered for competition, that most of the pests of the farm were 
hardly known in Cumberland and Westmorland.
A facetious 
acquaintance of mine once observed to me, "Take a yard of cloth 
of any description— carpeting if you like — and lay it before a draper.
He will at a glance be able to indicate to you the component parts 
both of the warp and woof — their probable value — quality — and 
durabihty.
Place a square yard of the turf of his meadow or 
pasture before an ordinary farmer, and what answer would you get 
from him with respect to its vegetable covering ?
" Let this ignor- 
ance be removed — the process I may say has already commenced — 
let the agriculturist be enabled to discriminate the good from the 
bad, leaving it to his practical skill to solve the problem of 
encouraging the former element and suppressing the latter.
Before resuming my seat, I cannot forbear expressing my deep 
obligation to two venerable and worthy gentlemen, the Rev, R.
46 
Wood, vicar of Westward, Wigton ; and William Dickinson, Esq., 
of Thorncroft, Workington ; for encouragement and able assistance 
rendered by them in my earlier botanical studies.

THE CHALONERS, LORDS OF THE MANOR 
OF ST.
BEES.
By WILLIAM JACKSON, F.S.A.
(Read at Whitehaven, March 1st, i88i.^ 
It has been surmised by a great poet, in words familiar to you all, 
that in many a parish churchyard lie the bones of men, who, if the 
call had but come to them, were capable of being the Hampdens 
or Miltons of their time.
I will neither assert nor deny the truth 
of this statement ; but I will say that there are few parishes that 
have not, in some manner, and at some time, been directly 
connected with some important actor, or event, in the history of 
England.
I will illustrate this from our own neighbourhood.
The 
first husband of the last heiress of Moresby Hall, Sir Francis 
Weston, died on the scaffold for his share in the guilt of Anne 
Boleyn, if, indeed, she were guilty of the charges brought against 
her.
Henry Grey, Duke of Suffolk, father of Lady Jane Grey, 
was attainted for treason against Queen Mary, and his manor of 
Harrington was forfeited to the crown.
Egremont Castle belonged 
to many who were not only conspicuous but famous in their time, 
and it is therefore not exceptional that Saint Bees should have its 
connecting links with the great stream of our national history ; but 
it is exceptional that they should be of so very remarkable a 
character.
The first is, the establishment on a shore ravaged and heathen- 
ised by the Vikings of the North, of a Christian centre through 
48 
the devotion of one of the many missionaries from Ireland, 
whose names are still familiar to us by their having been adopted 
as the Patron Saints of our churches.
Another is, that our parish 
was the birth-place of the third Protestant Archbishop of Canter- 
bury, who was very unwilling that the Great Reformation should 
be arrested at the point that the Queen desired it should.
The 
third connecting link is through the family whose history it is my 
object to bring before you this evening.
I cannot say that locally 
they played a very important part ; but two of its members — father 
and son — held the Manor for more than fifty years ; and three 
generations, who covered a most important period in our history, 
occupied conspicuous positions on the national stage.
The first, born when the effete spirit of Ecclesiasticism was only 
waiting for the death-stroke that from some source was to come 
upon it ; the next, living when the vitiated blood of the Stuarts 
was striving to build up a despotism which tottered down upon 
the head of perhaps the worthiest member of their race ; and to 
which end the third generation contributed two actors; for the 
name of Thomas Chaloner appears on the Death Warrant of 
Charles, and though that of his brother James is absent he 
certainly sat on the Trial.
Thomas Chaloner was born in the year 15 21.
He was a 
descendant of the seventh noble tribe of North Wales ; but it is 
more to the purpose to say that his father, Roger Challoner, was 
a mercer of the City of London, and that he, perhaps, obtained 
the surname from being a maker of coverlets, or blankets, called 
"Chalons," the stuff from which they were made being procured 
from Chalons, a town which has given its name to our modem 
"shalloons," and perhaps even more modern "challies." It was 
the wealth obtained by honest trade that did more to lift him in 
the scale of society than the blood of his ancestors.
The trading 
classes were then rising to a position in the commonwealth which 
was no longer to be ignored.
Whittingtons, Poles, Hewitts, and 
Spencers, mingled their blood with the proudest in the realm, 
and built country seats which outshone the gloomy castles of the 
ancient aristocracy.
It is certain that Thomas Chaloner's father 
49 
must have given him some more substantial help, to take the 
position which he very speedily attained than even the best 
education that the time could afford; which latter, however, 
enabled him to rank with the most learned men, aye, and women 
too, of his time.
He was early launched on the great ocean of 
the world, for he went as Secretary to Sir Henry Knyvett, one of 
the two ambassadors sent by Henry VHI.
— Gardiner, Bishop of 
Winchester, being the other, — to the Diet at Ratisbon, in the year 
1540.
His good 'fortune, and, perhaps, his intelligence, enabled 
him to get hold of the threads of an intrigue that was being carried 
on by Gardiner with the Pope's Legate, Contarini.
The latter 
being suddenly called away handed certain letters, with which 
he was entrusted by the Pope, to an Italian merchant, called 
Ludovico, with instructions that a speedy reply was required.
Ludovico meeting with one Wolf, steward to Sir Henry Knyvett, 
prayed him that he would tell the English Ambassador what the 
Legate desired.
Wolf said there were two Ambassadors, and it 
speedily appeared that he who was styled " Reverendissimus" was 
the one wanted.
Wolf communicated with Chaloner and the two 
had a long interview with Ludovico; the result being that Henry was 
advised of the whole proceedings, which at that time he did not 
think fit to notice.
Poor Ludovico was cast into prison.
Change we now the scene to the following year, 1541, and we 
find that the young diplomatist and his master Knyvett had 
enlisted themselves, like Knight-errants, in an expedition against 
the Paynim.
The occasion and the preparations have been well 
described by Froude, and I abridge his narrative : — " The Turks 
had been making alarming progress in Europe ; they had defeated 
Ferdinand, and there was some suspicion of an alliance germinating 
between them and Francis.
With a view to both events, Charles 
resolved upon an expedition against Algiers, and mustering one 
hundred and fifty vessels, with as many transports, he embarked 
an army of twenty thousand infantry and two thousand cavalry.
A landing was effected at some distance from the town.
The 
troops were on shore, the provisions were still in the transports, 
when during the night a violent hurricane arose, and when morning 
4 
50 
dawned the wrecks of half the fleet were strewn along the beach, 
and the natives were murdering the crews.
That portion of the 
fleet which escaped shipwreck was driven three days' march from 
the starving army, which, surrounded by swarms of Moorish 
cavalry, had to make its way against repeated attacks, (every 
loiterer and every wounded man being speared,) to the transports.'- 
Chaloner's account of his narrow escape from death is published 
in Hakluyt's Collection of Voyages, in the following words, (the 
original, in Latm, may be found in the Introduction to his De 
Republica Anglorum Instauranda) : " The galley in which he was, 
being either dashed against the rocks, or shaken with the mighty 
storm and cast away, after he had saved himself a long time by 
swimming, when his strength failed him, his armes and handes 
being faint and weary, with great difficulty laying hold with his 
teeth on a cable which was cast out of the next galley, not without 
breaking and loss of certain of his teeth, recovered himself and 
returned home to his own country in safety." On the return home 
of Sir Henry Knyvett and himself, the former in the same year 
married Anne, the great heiress of Moresby and other vast estates, 
and widow of the Sir Francis Weston I have mentioned ; and by 
her had two sons, the youngest of whom, Sir Henry Knyvett, 
heired from his mother the great estate of Escrigg, in Yorkshire.
Chaloner upon his return was promoted to the office of Head 
Clerk of the Council by Henry VHI.
From this time till the 
battle of Musselburgh we hear nothing of him ; but his sympathies 
with the cause of the Reformed Faith were sure to lead him to 
the party of the Lord Protector, and accordingly we find him 
distinguishing himself in an extraordinary manner at that fight, or 
rather scene of slaughter ; for the Scotch were in the position of 
the French at Agincourt — encumbered with their own numbers.
In company with Edward Seymour, eldest son of the Protector, 
Hugh Askew (who subsequently got a grant of Seaton Priory, near 
Bootle), Ralph Vane, and Ralph Sadler, Thomas Chaloner was 
knighted for his gallantry on the battlefield, which, Holinshed tells 
us, was strewn with swords, pikes, and lances, as thick as rushes 
in a chamber.
He also obtained, as a reward of his valour on this 
51 
occasion, a gift which must have been most gratifjdng to him, 
being a jewel from the hands of the Lord Protector's wife.
Sir WiUiam Sandys, eldest brother of Edwin, subsequently 
Archbishop of York, had the ill fortune to be slain in this battle.
He was cousin to the Sandys of Rottington.
We next find Chaloner nominated to a task which, although he 
was no doubt a devoted follower of the Lord Protector, could not 
be otherwise than most disagreeable to him.
The ambition of the 
Lord Admiral, the Protector's younger brother, had grown to the 
dimensions of treason against the state, and he had on more than 
one occasion treated remonstrances, and even commands, with 
contempt.
His wife, Catharine Parr, had died shortly before, and 
Lord Seymour of Sudeley was dreaming of a marriage with the 
Princess Elizabeth.
He was suddenly seized and committed to 
the Tower on the 17th January, 1549, and on the following day 
Sir Thomas Chaloner, Sir Hugh Paulett, and John Yernley, were 
sent to search his house at Bromham, in Wiltshire.
He was one of the witnesses against Bonner in the same year.
Some years previous to this he had married Joan Cotton, widow 
of Sir Thomas Leigh, one of the greatest suppressors of monasteries, 
who had obtained a grant of a lease for twenty-one years of the site 
of the monastery of Guisborough, and lands in the hands of the 
canons at the time of the suppression, at the rent of ;^49 ^s.
\d.
It was let to him for thirty years, on July 20th, 1547, (and this 
date indicates that Chaloner had previously married the widow,) 
and finally he purchased the same absolutely, October 31st, 1550, 
for the sum of ^998 13^.
4^.
The suspicious correspondence with the Pope, which I have 
mentioned as having been detected at Ratisbon, was revealed by 
him to the Privy Council during the proceedings against Gardiner, 
in December, 1550, which resulted in that prelate (who had 
already spent some time in the Tower.) being sent to a meaner 
lodging and harsher treatment.
In thelastyearof Edward VI.
(1553), Sir Thomas received a grant 
of the manor, rectory, and cell of St. Bees, with all its rights, etc., in 
St. Bees and Ennerdale, not granted away by the Crown before, to 
52 
be held by him in fee farm, as of the manor of Sheriff Hutton in 
Yorkshire, in free and common socage, but not in capite, paying 
to the Crown the fee farm rent of ;^i43 i6s.
2^^.
I have 
examined the duphcate of the grant on the Patent Roll for that 
year in the Record Office, and find that not only was there a grant 
on June i6th, to Thomas Chaloner and Johanna his wife, of Saint 
Bees, on the terms mentioned, but that the same document conveys 
the manor of Suytall in Yorkshire, parcel of the possessions of 
Kirkstall Abbey, also lands and rfents belonging formerly to the 
Abbeys of Jervaux and Monkbretton, no consideration being 
named ; the probability being that the grant was in satisfaction 
of a debt, and that such parcels were eked out as met the claim.
The manor, rectory, and cell of Saint Bees had existed in the 
Crown from the suppression, and the receipts were regularly 
accounted for in the Exchequer Accounts.
I quote an extract as 
referring to an old family long existing amongst us : — 
1548.
Anthone Fox doth hold one messuage and two oxgangs 
of land, and doth pay yearly at the Feasts of the Blessed Virgin 
and St. Michael the Archangel 3s., and in customary dues and 
services 2 hens, xx.
eggs, and 7 boon harvest days valued at xx.
shillings.
The grant at this time indicates that Sir Thomas was not 
absolutely in a position of hostility to Dudley, who had been 
created Duke of Northumberland ; his former patron, and the man 
to whom he was devoted, Somerset, having traversed the then 
well beaten track that led to the block.
Now, several consider- 
ations arise in connection with this grant, and first I would like to 
make a few remarks upon the distribution of the abbey lands.
A 
great outcry has been made on the mode in which this distribution 
was effected.
Spelman on Sacrilege, and numerous other writers 
in the present day, lift up their hands in pious horror at the sup- 
pression and distribution.
Undoubtedly, the latter was in some 
respects a scramble ; and, undoubtedly, grants were made to very 
unworthy individuals ; but, on the other hand, it must be remem- 
bered that the heirs of the great original donors, in numerous 
instances, did but receive back the lands granted by their ancestors, 
53 
and in many not even that ; witness the case of the Curwen family, 
who founded Shap, and were benefactors to Hohii Cultram, 
CarHsle, Calder, and Furness, and who only benefited by receiving 
a portion of the spoils of Furness.
Many of the lands were bought 
as in the case of Chaloner, who really purchased Guisborough, and 
no doubt obtained Saint Bees with the fruits of his father's industry, 
and as an investment for his money, which the State (reduced to 
the utmost straits by the necessity of fortifying itself against foreign 
aggression, and torn by internal dissension) was very glad to receive; 
though I am quite willing to allow that the public affairs were ill 
and most wastefully managed.
But what induced Chaloner to procure a grant of the manor, 
rectory, and cell of Saint Bees ?
First, there was the fact that 
certain possessions of Calder Abbey had been sold to Sir Thomas 
Leigh, on July 20th, 1546, for ^^243 ^s.
od., and his wife was the 
widow of that rather well known individual.
Secondly, I make no 
doubt that he was on good terms with Grindal, to whom not long 
afterwards he sold the rectory, for the latter held the tithes long 
previous to 15693 and may it not be that in scholarly talk with 
Lady Jane Grey, who married Northumberland's son, Guildford, 
on May 25th, 1553, he had heard much said of the district which 
he had already heard spoken of by Henry Knyvett, whose wife 
was Lady of Moresby ?
I would not lay too great stress on these 
points, but the combination is curious ; and that he was a deeply 
attached friend of that "admirable Crichton" of her sex, we know 
from his Latin Poem entitled, "Deploratio Acerbse Necis Heroidis 
Prestantissimse D.
Janse Grayae Henrica Ducis Suffolchice filije quse 
securi percussa animo constantissimo mortem oppetiit." One 
beautiful line I quote — 
"Ore placens Veneris, Palladis arte placens." 
On the i2th April, 1555, an agreement was made between Lady 
Chaloner and Thomas Leigh, her first husband's nepliew and male 
heir, wherein for the consideration of ^1000, certain houses in 
Austin Friars, London, and the Priory of St. Oswald's, which had 
been bought by her husband, were re-purchased from the male 
heir.
The latter property subsequently fell to her daughter by her 
54 
first husband.
"On January nth, 1556," writes in his diary 
Henry Machyn, Citizen and Merchant Taylor of London, "was 
bered my lade Challenger, the wyff of ser Thomas Challenger, and 
was the wyff of ser Thomas Lee of Hogston, and bered at Shor- 
dyche chyrche with ii.
whyt branchys and ii.
dozen stayffes torchys 
and iiii.
grett taypurs and a harold of armes and iiii.
baners of 
emages and a viii.
dozen of skochyons of armes and the strett 
hangyd with blake boythe the strett and the chyrche and armes." 
During the reign of Philip and Mary, Chaloner is said to have 
been in some peril on account of his religious opinions, and that 
he was only saved from the persecution which fell on so many of 
his friends by the exertions of some high in the state whom he had 
befriended during the reign of Edward.
He certainly, however, 
received a grant of the manor of Steeple-Claydon, in Buckingham- 
shire, on the 13th of August, 1557, a grant made after the little 
preliminary form of a payment of ;^2ioo in money.
A confirm- 
ation of the grant, and probably an additional one of lands at 
Guisborough, was made to him July i6th, 1558, on the conditional 
payment of ^135 15J.
4}{d.
annually.
On the accession of Queen Elizabeth he at once took a high 
position at Court, and a conversation between himself and the 
Emperor's Ambassador, Von Holfenstein, Baron of Gundelfingen, 
respecting the propriety of the Queen's speedy marriage is recorded.
The Ambassador recommended his master the Emperor's son, the 
Archduke of Austria, and on his return home sent Chaloner a 
portrait of him, and a letter in which he enlarged upon his comeli- 
ness, but that his mind and abilities far exceeded the attractions of 
his person ; that if the most excellent virtues and gallant endow- 
ments of his soul were as well known generally as to him, they 
would be found by many degrees to excel the beauty of his body.
Unfortunately the picture was damaged on its way.
Holfenstein 
promised to send another of his "whole body," and that of his 
brother also.
Nothing came of it ; but Strype the historian says : 
" The Queen, though she would sometimes retain suitors, was not 
minded to wed herself but to her kingdom only." 
On the 17th of July, 1559, he was sent Ambassador to Brussels, 
55 
whence he  vvrote to Cecil a letter which Miss Strickland, with an 
inattention to detail, and therefore with an inaccuracy I am afraid 
rather characteristic of her, says was written from Spain.
The 
diflference is worthy of note, because the favourable opinion of the 
Low Countries was of more importance to Englishmen than that 
of Spain.
Chaloner's epistolary style is graphic and plain.
The 
atmosphere of Courts, his diplomatic experiences, and his scholastic 
acquirements, certainly did not deprive his letters of vigour of 
expression or picturesqueness of detail.
" I assure you.

The next fact in Chaloner's history is of remarkable interest, 
and specially so at the present time.
From an early period in our 
history succeeding the Conquest, the lot of the thralls or villeins 
had been gradually becoming more endurable, and this was largely 
owing to the gentle treatment of the Religious Houses.
Curiously 
enough, the villeins on this account not caring to be freed, nominal 
villeinage lasted longer on their lands than on those of the Lay 
Lords.
The lands which they held in customary copyhold, or 
other such tenures, had gradually come to be considered as fixed, 
although in the case of these very tenures the occupants are called 
"Tenants at Will" in the Percy Survey of 1578.
Now the Church 
had little or no voice, and the Lords were desirous of resuming 
possession of lands which at this time were worth more than the rents 
paid for them ; probably in most instances to turn into huge sheep 
walks to supply wool for the looms of Bruges and Ghent.
The 
tenants naturally resisted, and, in most cases in the north, where 
tenancy is a common form of tenure, and the sympathy of the 
population was altogether in their favour, triumphed.
This struggle 
went on till James by a final effort raised such a storm that there 
was some danger of a rebellion.
In Ireland I doubt whether the 
customary tenure ever hardened, as with us, into an universally 
recognized fact; and hence, in our own time a struggle there, 
which was fought and fought successfully in this kingdom, and 
especially in these northern counties, three centuries ago.
I find indications of this struggle at Saint Bees in the Record of 
an Agreement made October 25th, 1560, between Sir Thomas 
Chaloner, Knt., and ninety tenants of Saint Bees, whereby the 
former grants to the latter, in consideration of ;^88 and payment 
and performance of the accustomed dues, duties, and services, 
except gressomes and heriotts, with leave to supply themselves 
with coal, a lease of their lands for fifty years, at the termination 
of which period their position of tenant right was in no degree to 
be damaged by this temporary arrangement.
Chaloner's letters from Brussels are all of interest.
He relates 
57 
rather a good saying of De Feria, with whom he was dining, and 
who had been Ambassador in London.
The Queen was always 
trimming her sails to please now Philip, now the French King; 
says De Feria : " Commend me to your Queen, and bid her look 
to herself, and remember the Spanish proverb, ' The Cock may 
scrape in the Dunghill till he uncovers the knife to cut his own 
throat.'" Writing to Cecil on January 15th, 1560, in view of 
certain difficulties, he says in his own energetic vein, " Trust we 
none but God and ourselves.
For if I were God I would swear by 
myself that I believe our trusit is in God's defence only and by 
Him in our foresight, so our professed enemies and faint friends 
instead of cartells of defiance will send us solemn letters of con- 
gratulations otherwise Fas Viciis." How powerfully does this 
remind us of an utterance of another energetic spirit, Cromwell — 
"Trust in God and keep your powder dry." 
Probably it was soon after this time that Chaloner returned from 
his embassy, and it was shortly after this, I conjecture, that he 
married, as his second wife, Etheldreda daughter of Edward 
Frodsham of Elton, Cheshire, by whom he had a son who is also 
called Thomas.
I cannot ascertain when he was born, but if we 
admit the accuracy of the date given on his monument at Chiswick, 
it was in 1564; other authorities, perhaps more trustworthy, point 
to 1559.
That there was something peculiar about the marriage 
seems certain ; for in a note of a letter from Francis Chaloner, 
brother of Sir Thomas, given in the State Papers for 1565, the 
former writes that the latter has been ill of a fever, and has made 
a will leaving his lands to "the bastard;" but at no other time, 
nor by any other person, has the slander been repeated.
That he 
was married about this time is, I think, very probable for another 
reason.
On March 26th, 1562, the Earl of Westmerland, the 
unfortunate Charles, last of the noble stem of the Neville race, 
doomed to feed on the crumbs that fell from the Spanish monarch's 
table, and to linger out his miserable life in penury and ignominy 
after the unsuccessful Rising of the North, wrote to Chaloner 
desiring to become his tenant for his house in Clerkenwell, which 
he had erected for himself on the land formerly belonging to the 
58 
black nuns, and over the door of which he had placed an inscrip- 
tion in Latin, which has been thus translated : — 
Their house no more the veil-clad virgins grace, 
Yet faith unspotted still maintains her place, 
For sacred Hymen's rites like honours claim, 
And his bright star illumes the vestal flame.
The only interval of his career after the death of his first wife 
during which he could have built this house, which was clearly 
erected in connection with his marriage, was subsequent to his 
return from Brussels.
But this period of comparative leisure did 
not last long, and he was fixed upon by the Queen to go in the 
same capacity to Spain.
His salary is stated in the State Papers, 
September 30th, 1561, to be five marcs a day and incidental 
expenses ; but salaries were little more than nominal in those days.
The fees constituted the substantial remuneration, or the grant of 
a manor or barony at the termination of the service.
Many, how- 
ever, were the disappointments in the days of Queen Bess, and 
one rather notable fact impresses one at this time.
On the 24th 
August of this year, he grants to the Queen forty-eight messuages 
and tenements and also certain rents in Saint Bees and Hensingham; 
and on the i6th October, twenty -one tenements in Sandwith are 
made over to Her Majesty in consideration of the sum of ;^320.
These were never redeemed, and ultimately were bought by the 
Governors of Saint Bees School ; but of this more anon.
Chaloner, at the outset, met with the most discourteous treatment 
in Spain.
All his boxes and luggage were searched in the most 
offensive way, and he complained bitterly, but his Queen at that 
time chose to take no notice of the insult.
Throughout his 
residence at the Court of Madrid he was unwearied in his com- 
plaints of the climate, and he declared in winter he lived in a 
stove, and in summer in a barn.
" Spain," he says in another 
communication, "rather pain ; food and lodging about Madrid are 
scarcely bearable, and elsewhere past bearing," and the Duke of 
Alva was the only person in whom he found wisdom and courteous 
usage.
History has set down Alva amongst the wretches who have 
disgraced humanity, and it is right that he should have the benefit 
5!) 
of the only good word I ever read of him.
I need not quote from 
Sir Thomas's rather numerous despatches on State Affairs.
I extract 
a paragraph from a letter of Sir Nicholas Throckmorton, Ambassador 
at Paris, to Chaloner, dated Paris, 14th June, 1562 : "I pray you 
good My Lord Ambassador sende me two Paire of parfumed 
Gloves, parfumed with Orrange Flowers and Jacemin, thone for 
my wives hand, the other for myn owne ; and whereinsoever I can 
pleasure you with anything in this Country, you shall have it in 
Recompense thereof, or els so moche money as they shall coste 
you, provided alwaies that they be of the best choise, wherein your 
Judgment is inferior to none.
I would be glad you wold sende 
them me by Mr. Henry Cobham, who I here wilbe in these Parties 
or it be longe," «Src., <S:c.
It may add a little interest to this extract 
when I state that the Ambassador to France was father of the fair 
Elizabeth Throckmorton, who by captivating Raleigh's heart and 
becoming his wife, exercised an unfavourable influence on his 
worldly fortunes.
I pass over most of the rest of his communications from Spain 
to the Queen, only quoting two, both, I believe, to Cecil, and 
characteristic of Spanish medical treatment of the times.
The 
unfortunate Don Carlos (son of Philip II.
of Spain by his first 
wife, Mary of Portugal, the hero of Schiller's tragedy of that name, 
and celebrated not for either virtue or genius, but for his unhappy 
end, for he is said to have been put to death by his father for 
plotting against him,) "had the misfortune," says Chaloner, writing 
1562, "to tumble down stairs, for he was never over steady on his 
legs ; he brocke his head and was at the point of death," chiefly 
through the contrary opinions, and, consequently, neutralised prac- 
tice of his numerous physicians.
Chaloner, who was not without 
medical skill himself, proclaims them all as bunglers.
They 
let the moody young prince's wound heal so soon, that the 
injured bone beneath putrified; "he may yet' get well," says 
Chaloner, "but it will axe about six weeks space to heal him 
thoroughly," adding, "his hurt is upon the top of his noddle side- 
ways as he slipped down stairs." Chaloner in good old-fashioned 
Saxon words describes such Court scenes, while his life hung in 
60 
the balance, as even the exclusive readers of Court History are not 
very familiar with.
He may trip at a French word, and call a 
thing "oultrageous," but he is sounder on his legs than the 
Prince was on his noddle.
Erysipelas came on.
Christians, Jews, 
and Infidels came in with their charms.
Regular practitioners 
made the sad matter sadder.
The King, expecting his son's 
deatli, was ready to gallop off from a defunct body.
Every soul 
was busy with his mourning and the fashion of it.
All at once 
the infallible doctor was thought of and sent for.
The corpse of 
a dead friar, now for his miracles accounted a saint, Don Diego 
de Alcala, was brought to the Prince and laid all night in bed with 
him.
We "axe" if the idea of such an "oultrageous" style of 
practice would now enter anybody's noddle?
Three centuries 
ago the Spanish Prince was restored from undergoing it, but how 
far the propter is in relation to the post, we leave to doctor's to 
determine.
The other case shows the skill of Spanish physicians in an 
equally favourable light.
In August, 1564, Philip's third wife, 
Elizabeth of France, unfortunately for herself, had need of medical 
attendance.
Fever arose.
The doctors bled her in both arms ; 
they bled her in both feet; and when spasms and paroxysms came 
on, they cupped her and left her to die.
She was houselled, and 
the King, to comfort her, was houselled with her for company, and 
when Chaloner was writing to England she was lying abandoned 
of her physicians, at the mercy of God. The palace gates were 
shut, the lamentations in the Court both of men and women very 
tender and piteous ; the chapel was filled with noblemen all 
praying on their knees for her, and great and unfeigned moans in 
all parts.
Nature eventually proved too strong for Spanish doctors.
She rallied, and they flew at her once more ; they administered 
strong doses of agaricum, and, amazing to relate, she recovered.
Now it is a very old saying, that truth is stranger than fiction.
Every one of you that has read " Gil Bias" will have laughed at 
what you must have thought the ridiculously exaggerated instruc- 
tions which Dr. Sangrado gave for the treatment of his patient : 
" First, six porringers of blood were to be taken from him as a 
61 
beginning, to make up for the want of perspiration ; then the 
barber was to return in three hours and repeat the treatment, and 
next day he was to begin afresh.
It is an error," said Sangrado, 
" to believe that blood is necessary for the preservation of life.
It 
is impossible to overbleed a sick person.
As he is not obliged to 
move or to take any considerable exercise, and has nothing to do 
only not to die, he requires no more blood than a sleeping man — 
life in both only consisting in the pulse and the breathing." 
Le Sage was writing a century later than Chaloner's time.
There were many reasons why Chaloner's residence in Spain 
should be most trying apart from the climate of the country and 
the consequent differences in modes of living which harassed 
him so severely.
England was, in a hesitating way, aiming to be 
the head of the Protestant powers, though the vacillating Queen 
ever avoided committing herself to that position.
Spain, on the 
contrary, was the stronghold of Ecclesiastical Conservatism.
But 
what most of all led to the bitter feeling on the part of Spaniards 
against Englishmen was the conduct of our sailors, vvho, when 
they came upon a Spanish vessel in such a situation that she 
appeared to be at their mercy, rarely let slip the opportunity for 
plunder; and this again arose from the jealousy and monopolising 
action of Spain.
Wearied and worn in June, 1564, he wrcte to a 
friend in the midst of his trouble, "whether this alone is not to a 
free mind an importable burden, two years and three quarters to 
bear my cross in Spain, a place and nation of all others misliked 
save themselves, driven here not only to forbear, but patiently, like 
an ass, to lay down mine ears at things of too much indignity." 
His health failed at last between the climate, the garlic, and the 
public worries.
" Surely I have had great \\Tong," he says in a 
letter to Sir Ambrose Cave, " but it is the old wont of our Court 
never to think upon the training of a new servant till the old be 
worn to the stump.
It is each man's part to serve their prince, 
but there is a just distributing if subjects durst plead with kings.
I have not much more to hope, having twenty years served four 
kings, now further from wealth or that staff of age which youth 
doth travail for than I was eighteen years agone.
Methinks I 
62 
become a retrograde crab, and yet would gladly be at home with 
that that yet resteth to pay my debts, and live the rest of my life 
perhaps contentedly enough." About the end of this year he was 
allowed to return.
I learn from the State Papers that he was a suitor for a grant of 
mines in Ireland on July i8th, 1565.
Whether he was successful 
or not is not recorded.
He died at the house which I have 
mentioned on the 14th October, 1565, and was buried in St. Paul's 
Cathedral.
Dr. Walter Haddon, Master of Requests to Queen 
Elizabeth, wrote his epitaph in Latin, which has been thus trans- 
lated :— 
Nature and Art in Chaloner combin'd, 
And for his Country form'd the Patriot's mind.
With praise deserv'd his public posts he fill'd.
And equal fame his learned labours yield.
While yet he liv'd he liv'd his country's pride, 
And first his country injur'd when he died.
His friend, Sir William Cecil, was his executor, as he also was 
of Grindal.
He was chief mourner at his funeral, and wrote some 
highly eulogistic Latin verses to his memory, in which he observes 
that "the most lively imagination, the most solid judgment, the 
quickest parts, and the most unblemish'd probity, which are 
commonly the lot of different men, and when so dispersed 
frequently create great characters, were — which very rarely happens 
— all united in Sir Thomas Chaloner, justly therefore reputed one 
of the greatest men of his time." I am not aware that he had any 
enemies ; he was the friend of all his good and great contempo- 
raries, and, if the axiom, " Noscitur a sociis" be true, he needs no 
higher praise.
His works seem to deserve some little notice at our hands, and 
it is almost touching to find that the first publication of so learned 
a man was, "A little Dictionary for Children;" his second was, 
"The Office of Servants;" his next was a translation of "The 
Praise of Folly," by his friend Erasmus.
His more learned works 
were published in 1579, after his death, at the instigation of Cecil; 
and it may surprise some to learn that the translation of the title 
63 
of one poem is "In Praise of Henry VIII., the most worthy King 
of England, a Paneygyrick;" so that it appears that that monarch 
was not regarded by the eminent men of his time as the monster 
which later historians, with preconceived views, have been pleased 
to depict him.
Froude, who has ventured occasionally to say a 
good word for him, is not, it appears, the first who has not been 
utterly condemnatory.
Chaloner wrote nothing in favour of Queen 
Mary.
There are three portraits of him ; one, a painting by Sir Antonio 
More, was exhibited some years ago at the Exhibition of National 
Portraits ; another forms the frontispiece to his " De Republica 
Anglorum;" and a third, a small engraving by Hollar, is the 
choicest, rarest, and dearest morceau the collector of engraved 
portraits can gather into his portfolio.
The current price for this 
treasure of perhaps four inches square, is about ^40.
Pass we on to the worthy son of so worthy a father, of whom 
the first record discoverable is that he was a student at Magdalen 
College, Oxford, in the year 1580, where he did not take a degree, 
having left early to travel, which he did to good purpose for some 
years.
In the year 1584, we find him publishing a book on "The 
Virtue of Nitre, wherein is declared the sundry cures by the same 
effected," which indicated a strong bent to the study of Natural 
Philosophy.
On March 28th, 1586, he was a student of the law 
at Gray's Inn, and then gave, bargained, and sold to the Keepers 
and Governors of the Free Grammar School of Saint Bees, in 
order that they might erect a school and house for the schoolmaster 
there, "all that plot of ground known and called by the name of 
St. Anthony's Orchard, containing by estimation an acre and a 
half, adjoining unto a highway leading between the same parcel of 
ground and the churchyard of the said parish of Saint Bees.
And 
also he gave and sold frank and free liberty to have and to take 
forty loads of coals at and in the coal pits of the said Thomas 
Chaloner in the parish of Saint Bees, and free liberty of access to 
the said coal pits for digging and removing the coals from time to 
time," in consideration of which free grant, the governors covenanted 
64 
that Sir Thomas and his heirs should for ever have two scholars 
placed in the same Free Grammar School.
The two illustrious brothers, Anthony and Francis Bacon, were 
at this time fellow-students with young Chaloner at Gray's Inn, the 
two former being nephews to the second wife of Cecil, who was 
guardian of the latter, and we may imagine what sage communings 
and what plays of wit were indulged in over the sea coal fire, as 
the "Novum Organum" dawned on the mind of its author, and 
was discussed with one who was no dreamer, but severely practical, 
as was evidenced by his own discoveries and the favourable result 
they had on the commerce of the nation.
But Chaloner did not 
neglect the imaginative powers of his mind, for Spenser in his 
"Colin Clout's come home again," written about 1591, after 
mentioning Shakspere thus — 
And there, though last not least, is ^tion, 
A gentler shepherd may no where be found, 
Whose Muse, full of high thought's invention, 
Doth, like himself, heroically sound." 
passes on to allude to Chaloner :- 
There eke is Palin, worthy of great praise, 
Albe he envy at my rustic quill.
And Puttenham in his "Arte of English Poesie," actually classifies 
him with the author of "The Faery Queen," naming him first : 
" For Eclogue and pastorall Poesie Sir Phillip Sydney and Master 
Challoner and that other Gentleman who wrote the late Shepheards 
Callender." It is very remarkable, and deeply to be regretted, 
that of such worthy efforts of the Muse, deserving such lofty 
commendation from such eminent authorities, not a line exists ; 
they have gone the way of the lost books of "The Faery Queen," 
and of many other productions of that time, so fertile in efforts of 
genius and spirit of adventure.
He married Elizabeth, daughter of Sir William Fleetwood, 
Recorder of London, a great friend of his father, and by her had 
four sons and three daughters.
He was for some time under 
Henry IV.
in the warres of France, and was knighted by that 
65 
monarch in the year 1591, having most probably shared with him 
in the glories of Ivry and Arques, fought not long before ; but 
when the French King abjured Protestantism, Chaloner would 
feel that his service was no fitting place for him.
Most probably 
between this time and the year 1595 a great project was taking 
growth and substance in Sir Thomas's mind.
He had visited and 
closely observed the Pope's alum works, during his travels in Italy; 
and riding a-hunting near Guisborough, he noticed that the rocks, 
the soil, and the vegetation were very similar to that he had 
observed there.
Drayton in his Poly-olbion has given a faithful 
picture of this part of Yorkshire : — 
Marke Gisbrough's gay scite where Nature seems so nice, 
As in the same shee makes a second Paradice ; 
Whose Soyle imbroidered is with so rare sundry flowers.
Her large okes so long greene, as Summer there her bowers 
Had set up all the yeare, her ayre for health refin'd, 
Her earth with Allome Veine most richly intermin'd, 
In other places these might Rarities be thought, 
So common but in me, that I esteem as nought.
The value of alum in trade at that particular period may be well 
illustrated by an extract from a dispatch of Don Guerran to the 
Duke of Alva dated February 20th, 1569.
Spain was intriguing 
with a view to support the rebellion of that year, the famous 
"Rising of the North." "It is essential," he writes, "that the 
trade with France be kept closed.
Without oil and alum they 
cannot continue their cloth manufacture, and when work is slack 
and commerce suspended, they then fly to arms." The principal 
difficulty with which Chaloner had to contend in the establishment 
of his manufacture was the procuring of skilful workmen, and 
these were obtained from the Pope's works at Rocca, which 
produced a very large income.
Latimer speaks of the importance 
of these works in one of his sermons ; and being so very lucrative, 
and the art a monopoly, they were most vigilantly watched.
In 
spite, however, of these precautions, means were found to convey 
some workmen, who had familiarized themselves with the manu- 
facture, on board ship enclosed in casks, amongst them being one 
named Lambert Russell, a Walloon.
It has been said that the 
5 
66 
Pope, in his rage at the discovery, issued a Bull cursing Chaloner 
in the most violent and minute terms.
The Bull has been often 
quoted, and in one v/ell-known book, " The Life and Opinions of 
Tristram Shandy," where Dr. Slop reads much of it with a running 
comment, at the end of which, "I declare," quoth my uncle Toby, 
" my heart would not let me curse the devil himself with so 
much bitterness." " He is the father of curses," replied Dr. Slop.
" So am not I," replied my uncle.
" But he is cursed to all 
eternity," replied Dr. Slop.
" I am sorry for it," quoth my uncle 
Toby.
I am bound to say there are two different accounts whence 
the workmen were obtained ; another stating that they were 
brought from Rochelle, which, considering that it resembles Rocca 
in sound and spelling, I should certainly have concluded was 
erroneous, but for the dispatch of Don Guerran, which I have 
already quoted, wherein it is stated that supplies of alum were 
obtained from France.
Be that as it may, the manufacture was 
established, and great profit accrued to Sir Thomas Chaloner for 
some years ; but the envious eye and the grasping hand of James 
could not be charmed away, and under the pretence that it was a 
mine royal it was seized for the Crown, much as Elizabeth had 
seized the Goldscope mines at Keswick, and with similar results ; 
for as the one seizure partly led to the Earl of Northumberland 
taking part in "The Rising of the North," so this engendered a 
bitter feeling on the part of two of Chaloner's sons, which was not 
without influence in causing them to take the Puritan side ; but 
nothing of this occurred till years after the time of which I am 
speaking.
On the 30th of November and ist of December, 1599, Sir 
Thomas Chaloner, William Fleetwood, and Henry Fleetwood, his 
brothers-in-law, and probably representing the trustees under 
entail, joined in a conveyance of the Saint Bees estate to Thomas 
Wybergh, and thus terminated the connection of the Chaloners 
with this district, in which probably they were never personally 
much known ; yet the fame of them must have been felt in these 
parts.
In the year 1603, Sir Thomas, who had had previous oppor- 
67 
tunities of acquiring the favour of King James, accompanied that 
monarch on his journey from Scotland to London.
His friend 
Bacon wrote a letter to him which I venture to inflict upon you, 
because it shows on what intimate terms the two were, and that 
Bacon was under some pecuniary obligation to his friend : " Sir, 
for our money matters I am assured you received no unsatisfaction, 
for you know my mind and you know my means, which now the 
openness of the time caused by this blessed content and peace 
will increase, and so our agreement according to your time be 
observed.
For the present, according to the Roman adage, 'that 
one cluster of grapes ripeneth best beside another,' I know you 
hold me not unworthy whose mutual friendship you should cherish.
And I for my part conceive good hope that you are likely to 
become an acceptable servapt to the King our Master, not so 
much for any way made heretofore which in my judgement will 
make no great difference ; as for the stuff and sufficiency which I 
know to be in you, and whereof I know His Majesty may reap 
great service.
And therefore my general request is that according 
to that industrious vivacity which you use towards your friends, 
you will further His Majesty's good concert and inclination towards 
to whom words cannot make me known, neither mine 
own nor others ; but time will be no disadvantage of any who 
shall forerun His Majesty's experience by your testimony and 
commendation.
And though occasion give you the precedence of 
doing me this special good office, yet I hope no long time will 
intercede before I shall have some means to requite your favour 
and acquit your report.
More particularly having thought good to 
make oblation of my most humble service to His Majesty by a few 
lines, I desire your loving care and help by yourself or such means 
as I refer to your discretion, to deliver and present the same to 
His Majesty's hands, of which letter I send you a copy, that you 
may know what you carry, and may take of Mr. Matthew the letter 
itself, if you be pleased to undertake the delivery.
Lastly, I do 
commend to yourself and such your courtesies as occasion may 
require, this gentleman, Mr. Matthew, eldest son of my Lord 
Bishop of Duresme, and my very good friend, assuring you that 
68 
any courtesy you shall use towards him, you shall use towards a 
very worthy gentleman, and one I know whose acquaintance I 
much esteem.
And so I ever continue," &c., &c.
That a further knowledge of the excellencies of Chaloner's 
character and the extent of his attainments led to a perfect reliance 
on his judgment and capacity, is evident from the fact that in 
August, 1603, Henry, Prince of Wales, was put under his control; 
and how singularly absolute the authority conferred upon him was, 
can only be judged of by quoting some clauses of the Patent : — 
" For the good proof we have long had of your singular affection 
to our person, and for the trust and repose in you as well in regard 
of your zeal to religion, as also for your discretion, We have made 
choice of you to have the principal charge and custody, as well of 
the person of our said son as also the oversight of all his house- 
hold and family attending him, who, being to us so dear a jewel 
as he is, the charge is likewise of great weight and care to you.
Wherefore we have thought good to accompany so great a burthen 
with sufficient authority to you for the execution and discharge 
thereof, and do therefore direct these our letters patent to you 
under our Great Seal ot England, whereby we do give you power 
and authority for the better execution of this charge committed to 
you to command, rule, and direct as well all persons which shall 
be of ordinary attendance about our Son the Prince in his house 
in all things that may concern the safety of his person or the 
observation of good rule in his house," &c.
An independent establishment was set up for the Prince and his 
sister, the Lady Elizabeth.
The result of late historical investi- 
gations published in the Catalogues of State Papers shew that 
during the spring of 1604 Chaloner, principally through the 
medium of Henry Wright, was on the track of the conspiracy 
which subsequently developed into the famous Gunpowder Plot, 
and of which two of the prominent members were John and 
Christopher Wright.
I confess I should not be much surprised if 
the whole plot had been unravelled by the sagacity of Chaloner 
and perhaps one or two others, and then the King through the 
medium of the letter to Monteagle had been allowed to suppose 
69 
that his penetration had been the means of tracking it out.
It is 
quite certain that nothing could possibly be more gratifying to 
his vanity than placing the matter before him in that way.
We have no record of the death of Sir Thomas's first wife, but 
it was probably about this time that he married Judith, daughter 
of William Blount, Esq., of the City of London, by whom he also 
had four sons and three daughters.
On August 15th, 1604, I find record of a grant of land to Sir 
Thomas Chaloner, value ^100 per annum, from the Exchequer 
and Duchy of Lancaster, and on November 1 6th another grant to 
him and his heirs in fee farm of Exchequer lands, value ;^3o per 
annum, with woods and advowsons unvalued, and a further grant 
of the manor of Long Buckly, in the county of Northampton, of 
the Duchy of Lancaster, and further, December 17th, a grant of 
the manor of Clothall, Hertford, to Sir Thomas and Edward 
Cuson and their heirs.
There are other grants of moneys for the 
expenses of the Prince's household, and perhaps the above cited 
grants may be partly for that purpose.
Chaloner may have been, 
and probably was, large sums out of pocket, and these might be 
partially in the way of remuneration.
The King having resolved to honour the University of Oxford 
with a visit, and to enter the Prince a member of it, the Queen 
and His Highness started on the 27th August, 1605, from Wood- 
stock, where they had reposed themselves some days after a grand 
progress wherein they were attended by a numerous body of the 
nobility and gentry.
The Prince chose to be entered at Magdalen 
College, out of compliment to Sir Thomas, who had graduated 
there, and on which foundation he had placed two of his sons.
For some days there was great festivity and characteristic enjoy- 
ments in the University.
Disputations on subjects of divinity, 
civil law, &c., were amongst the chief amusements, in which I am 
glad to find that eminent Cumbrians of the day bore a conspicuous 
part.
Dr. John Aglionby, Principal of St. Edmund's Hall, took 
the affirmative side of the question, "Whether Saints and Angels 
know the Thoughts of the Heart ?
" and amongst other disputants, 
Dr. Airay, Provost of Queen's, asserted the negative.
Another 
70 
question in which many learned men were arrayed on either side 
was, " Whether a judge ought to give sentence according to the 
proofs alleged on the trial, against the truth known privately to 
himself?" Dr. Blencow, I suppose another Cumbrian, was the 
respondent in this argument.
Another question was, "Whether 
children imbibe the temper with the milk of the nurses?" And 
yet another was concerning the use of Tobacco.
I rather suspect 
His Most Sacred Majesty had been here supplied with some of 
the arguments which he used in his "Counterblaste to Tobacco," 
published in England later that very year ; and also that they had 
another result in causing the duty, which had been previously 
twopence a pound, to be raised to six shillings and tenpence.
In November, 1607, Sir Thomas Chaloner, in a letter to Sir 
Julius Caesar, Chancellor of the Exchequer, represented to what 
an extent the expenses of the Prince's establishment had risen, 
owing to his Court being so much frequented by the nobility.
On the 3rd March, 1608, Sir Thomas writes to Sir Thomas 
Luke expressing a most favourable opinion of an invention by Mr.
Sturtevant, of " Water pipes of earthenware of which 8000 yards 
may be made in a day, and which are more safe and strong than 
those of lead." 
On October 28th, 1609, licence was granted for Sir Thomas 
Chaloner's son to travel for three years ; and the attention that he 
met with abroad, and therefore his father's importance at home, 
may be judged of from a brief notice in a letter written by Lord 
Ross to Sir David Murray, dated at Florence, November 25th, 
161 2: "It is strange how they make their Court here to Sir 
Thomas Chaloner's son.
But yet indeed it is not strange ; for 
they build upon his father for a chief foundation of this match." 
I cannot determine which negotiation this was for the marriage of 
Henry.
Soon after the Prince of Wales came into the receipt of the 
Revenues of the Duchy of Cornwall, an application was made to 
him by a Monsieur Villeforest, who professed to have discovered 
a method of extracting silver out of lead.
This was referred to 
Sir Thomas, as one skilled in Natural Philosophy; and in his 
71 
report he mentions some experiments that were to be made to test 
the so-called discovery ; but there is no further record of the 
matter.
The Prince in December, 1610, after being created Prince of 
Wales, settled his household, and appointed Sir Thomas Chaloner 
to be his Chamberlain ; Sir William Fleetwood, his brother-in-law, 
to be his Surveyor-General, and later his Attorney-General ; and 
another brother-in-law, Sir David Foulis, his Cofferer.
In the 
following year the Prince bought from Sir Robert Dudley, son of 
the Earl of Leicester, the great estate of Kenilworth, which that 
unfortunate youth was compelled to sell.
He was a man of 
brilliant abilities, and had been a pupil of Chaloner, and had 
imbibed from his instructions a love of science, which, had he led 
a more regular life, would have made him one of the most eminent 
men of his time.
But the term of existence of the poor Prince, to whom he was 
no doubt deeply attached, was drawing to a close, and slowly and 
surely the inevitable end manifested its coming, as it did at a 
quarter before eight on Friday the 6th November, 161 2.
Sir 
Thomas Chaloner, as Head of the Household, figured conspicu- 
ously in the Funeral Procession of 7 th December of that year.
On June 13th, he had a grant of a lease of the manor of East 
Garston, in Berkshire, with a flock of two hundred sheep.
On 
August 28th, 1613, he is associated with two others in a grant of 
all that part of Guiana, on the Continent of America, lying between 
the rivers Amazon and Dollesquebe.
The last mention but one 
that I find of him, is his Petition to the Council, 1615, that the 
farmers of alum may be ordered to continue to him his pension of 
forty marks per annum granted for his labours in discovering 
the alum mines in Yorkshire.
Sir Thomas says in his will, dated November 26th, 1615, "I 
have conveyed unto my brother-in-law.
Sir William Fleetwood, the 
two parts in three parts to be divided, of the profits that shall 
or may accrue or come of my part of the allum mines, for the 
benefit of my children which I had by my first wife, which I hold 
to be a very sufficient advancement for them ; now my will is, 
72 
that the residue of the profit which shall or may accrue, or of 
right to accrue, or come to me out of the said allum mines and 
works, shall be divided amongst the children which I had by 
Dame Judith, my late wife, at the discretion of my executors.
Item : Whereas my daughter.
Dame Mary Fisher, hath not as yet 
had any portion from me, my mind is, that out of the said allum 
mines and works which are to be divided amongst my children 
by my said late wife, she shall have the dower of ;^ 1200 of lawful 
English money, by ;!{^3oo per annum.
His death took place this year, and he was buried in Chiswick 
Church, where a very handsome monument exists to his memory, 
simply recording the leading facts of his life, upon all of which I 
have sufficiently dwelt, excepting that his second wife predeceased 
him, she having died on June the 31st, whilst he only survived to 
the 1 8th of November, 1615.
Four of Sir Thomas Chaloner's sons, all by his first wife, 
Elizabeth Fleetwood, rose to eminence, and their political opinions 
were as diverse and conflicting as were those of their mother's 
house, and many another EngUsh home.
William, the eldest son, 
took the Guisborough estate, was created a baronet July 20th, 
1620, and died without issue at Scandaroon in Turkey.
The next 
son, Edward, became a very noted theologian, and was Chaplain- 
in-Ordinary both to King James I.
and King Charles I.
He was 
Principal of Saint Alban's Hall, Oxford, and died of the plague, 
July 2Sth, 1625.
The next son, Thomas, seems to have heired 
the Steeple Claydon estate.
He took a very prominent part on 
the Parliament side, in the great struggle of the first half of the 
sixteenth century.
He was one of King Charles's judges, and his 
signature is attached to the death warrant, in consequence of which 
he retired to Holland at the Restoration, and died at Middleburgh.
He was a most accomplished man, and had travelled much.
He 
sat as member for Richmond in the Long Parliament from October 
20th, 1645, till its expulsion by Cromwell, April 20th, 1653.
In 
the powerful address made by the Protector on that occasion, 
Thomas Chaloner, amongst others, had the doubtful honour of a 
special notice.
I know not whether it was earned.
" You call 
73 
yourselves Parliament !" thundered out the Dictator, "You are no 
Parliament !
I say you are no Parliament !
Some of you are 
drunkards !
" and his eye flashed upon Chaloner.
" Some of you 
are !
" and he roared out a more uncomplimentary epithet as he 
glared upon Harry Marten.
Some of his Parliamentary addresses 
have been published, but his best known work is " A True and 
Exact Relation of the strange Finding out of Moses his tomb in a 
valley near unto Mount Nebo in Palestina," published at London 
in 1657.
Antony Wood, who has the most virulent hatred for 
sectaries, says, " This book at its first appearance made a great 
noise, and pusled the Presbyterian rabbles for a time ; at length 
the author thereof being known, and his story fourjd to be a sheer 
sham, the book became ridiculous." 
James Chaloner, the next son of Sir Thomas, well maintained 
the reputation of his family as a man of genius and literary 
attainments.
Many letters of his are preserved in the Fairfax 
correspondence, for he married Ursula, daughter of Sir WiUiam 
Fairfax of Steeton ; and as love letters are a form of literature we 
all shall be, are, or have been interested in, I venture to read you 
one dated from London, November i8th, 1633, nearly two hundred 
and fifty years ago.
" Dear Mistress, 
Notwithstanding my many employments, which might plead an 
exemption from weekly travail in writing, I cease not to woo you as 
seriously and more affectionately than when I first became your 
petitioner ; and for your part, with as much tacitness, when I 
consider my fire for one, as when I was (as then I was,) no better 
than odious.
I would fain, if I knew how, salve the interruption 
of content which this silence of yours hath bred in my mind.
I 
frame many causes, but because there is no infallibility depends 
upon conjectural fancies, I remain restless, thoughtful, discontented, 
not that I fear any coldness in thee, having had evident proof of 
thy temper, thy love ; but that which troubles me is chiefly that 
thou thinkest, I suppose, that I should value the frequency of 
letters (as tradesmen do a plentiful commodity,) at a low rate.
No, 
74 
sweet mistress, if you conceive so you will mistake ; for if such 
things as conduce to a man's happiness can be entertained with 
satiety or loathing, then verily you may conclude with your 
practice.
But I know you have a rational brain, and a constant 
kindness of disposition toward me, which will neither permit you 
to err nor forsake.
In the assurance whereof, and with a longing 
and insatiate desire to hear weekly from thee, though but a word 
at a time, so that it be a loving one, I rest.
Your most faithful, most obedient, and 
most affectionate servant, 
James Chaloner." 
Anthony Wood says of this marriage (but I say it with the usual 
caution with regard to any of his statements respecting those 
opposed to his own party,) that it turned out very unhappily.
I 
know nothing directly, but it is certain that he owed his political 
advancement largely to the influence of the Fairfax family, his 
wife's relations, for he was appointed by Lord Fairfax one of the 
Commissioners for settling the affairs of the Isle of Man, in 1 65 2, 
and afterwards Governor of the Island from 1658 to 1660.
He was 
one of the fathers of English Topograph}', and wrote "A Short 
Treatise on the Isle of Man," which the Manx Society has deemed 
worthy of being reprinted.
He made large Antiquarian collections 
towards the Histories of Staffordshire, Shropshire, and Cheshire.
He was Member for Aldborough in the Long Parliament, from 
April loth, 1648, to its abrupt dismissal in 1653; and though his 
name is not, like his brother's, attached to King Charles's death 
warrant, he certainly sat during a part at least of the trial as one of 
the judges.
He died, also, soon after the Restoration, under 
disgraceful circumstances, if we believe Anthony Wood, which I 
decline to do.

OBSERVATIONS ON THE FLOWERING PLANTS 
OF WEST CUMBERLAND.
By J.
ADAIR.
(Read at the Workington Annual Meeting.) 
At the request of the Secretary of the Cumberland Association, 
the following notes and observations have been made, chiefly from 
data gathered by the Botanical Section of the Whitehaven Scientific 
Association.
The Section was formed early in 1879, and it was at first joined 
by a good many members, as it was intended that a vigorous effort 
should be made to collect and preserve the flowering plants of the 
district.
The Society already possessed a valuable collection of British 
plants (presented by the late Mrs. Pratten of Haile), and the 
efforts of the members of the section were intended to be directed 
towards supplementing this collection by local specimens, and by 
filling up vacancies in the the herbarium, as far as possible.
Unfortunately (for the Botanical section,) the summer of 1879 
was very unfavourable for out-door work ; and although many 
excursions were planned, the weather on every occasion happened 
to be very wet, so that conjoint action (in consequence of so many 
disappointments) came to an end for the season.
Owing to the unpropitious weather of the first season, and 
change of residence of some who were a little experienced in Field 
Botany, many of the members who had not previously studied the 
subject were discouraged, and have not given the assistance they 
would under other circumstances have rendered.
76 
The work therefore has been chiefly done by three or four 
members who had previously given some attention to the Flora of 
the district.
These members, however, live some miles apart from 
each other, so that each one has been left in a great measure to 
his own resources as joint excursions can seldom be held.
The district which the members of the section have pretty closely 
examined may be described as "Whitehaven and the neighbour- 
hood," which embraces the country about three miles to the north 
and six or seven miles to the south of the town, and inland to the 
water-shed of the hills.
The tract of country within this area is very diversified in soil 
and situation, and consequently a good field for botanical research.
It includes the sea cliffs from Harrington to Saint Bees and the 
beach southwards to Sellafield to the west ; the varied pastoral and 
arable land, the rivers and ponds, the moors and woods of the 
middle district; backed by the lakes and tarns, the hills and 
mountains to the east.
Whilst this district has been more immediately under the notice 
of the members of the section, they have recorded the occurrence 
of any botanical rarity which they have met with in other parts 
of West Cumberland.
Consequently the list of plants which they 
have compiled embraces some species which although so far have 
not been observed by them in the Whitehaven district, are entered 
in the catalogue as West Cumberland Plants.
In order to give a general idea of the work done by the section, 
it may be observed that the whole number of plants found growing 
as natives or naturalized in the British Isles is 1601.
This is the 
number arrived at by experienced botanists, as set forth in the 
London Catalogue of British Plants.
It includes, however, many 
that differ so slightly from each other, that they may be considered 
as varieties of an original species.
Dr. Hooker in his "Student's Flora of the British Isles," 
calculates the well defined species to be a little over 1200; and of 
this number about five hundred and fifty have been found in West 
Cumberland by members of the Botanical section.
This number is however far from being the total quantity of 
77 
species which the district affords.
Many of the Orders, especially 
the Carices and Grasses, have been only partially studied and 
examined, and much more time and care will have to be given to 
these and other Orders before the district can be said to have 
been well explored.
Taking the whole of the division of West 
Cumberland, it is probable there may be one hundred or possibly 
one hundred and fifty flowering plants in addition to those 
recorded, which have escaped recognition and registration.
When we consider that out of the number of 1200 native plants, 
the South of England claims a considerable number as its own ; 
Ireland, Scotland, and the Channel Islands have each a variety of 
species which they claim especially ; West Cumberland stands very 
well with its probable six hundred and fifty or seven hundred 
species for so small a district.
In briefly reviewing the work of the past two years, it will be 
necessary to go a little into detail as to the distribution of the 
different orders and species of plants, so far as it has come under 
the observation of the members of the section.
Time will not admit of anything more than a cursory view of 
the subject, the intention being to convey to those who take an 
interest in the subject a general idea of the Flora of the district by 
giving a short descriptive account of the plants often met with, 
including not only some rare or uncommon, but many very 
abundant species.
Commencing our examination at the extreme east of the district, 
on the mountain tops, 2000 to nearly 3000 feet above the sea level, 
we find they are generally speaking not barren.
For instance, the 
Pillar mountain is clothed with the Alpine Ladies' Mantle, a 
beautiful silky-leaved plant which is confined to elevated situations.
On the top and high slopes of Red Pike we find the same plant 
abundantly ; and on the very summit, close to tlie piles of stones, 
we find an interesting little shrub now in flower.
Tills proves to 
be the Least Willow, which sends forth its minute catkins of flowers 
on that bleak situation.
It is the least British shrub, scarcely 
rising more than half an inch above the ground, being kept lowly 
by the fierce and cutting winds of its exposed and barren habitat.
78 
On the lower slopes of the mountains the Birch and the Moun- 
tain Ash flourish, and also occasionally the dark green Juniper.
Thousands of acres are covered with heather, or rather heather 
and Ling.
There are two species of heather common, even 
abundant — the Fine-leaved Heath and the paler Cross-leaved 
Heath.
But by far the larger portion is not a true heath, but the 
open-flowered Common Ling, the great honey producer of the 
district.
The Ling covers an area of probably fifty or a hundred 
times greater than that occupied by the heaths, so that the fine purple 
of the hills as seen in August, is due to the ling rather than to the 
heather.
By the sides of the small streams high up on the fells we find 
two species of the Alpine Saxifrages, but neither kind is very 
abundant.
The pretty white-flowered Saxifraga stellaris, so called 
from its star-like appearance, grows either singly or two or three 
together on some mossy corner by the edge of the rivulet ; while 
the Saxifraga aizoides, with its showy orange flowers, blooms in 
large patches, and, though not plentiful, is rendered conspicuous 
by its mass of colour.
In watery places in the lower ground we may find in early 
summer the Common Butterwort, a pretty little purple flower 
growing from a rosette of pale green leaves.
It is an abundant 
species in the fell district.
And also a little later on (in Midsummer) 
the Round-leaved Sundew, with bright crimson leaves and pale 
cream-coloured flowers, which are seldom expanded ; and in pools 
by the side of Ennerdale Lake, one of the Bladderworts, Vtricu- 
laria interttteciia.
These three are all members of the well known 
Carnivorous family of plants, which have of late years attracted so 
much attention.
They represent the only three genera of this 
family which are natives of the British Isles.
They each capture 
their prey in a manner of their own.
The Butterworts by means 
of a tenacious fluid which exudes from and covers the upper portion 
of the leaf This glistening fluid appears to attract small flies and 
other insects, which, settling upon it, are made prisoners by the 
viscid matter.
The Sundew is supposed to attract insects by the 
brilliant colour of its crimson leaves, which are closely studded 
7& 
with stalked glands charged with a sticky fluid ; these glands 
immediately close over and hold fast any insect that touches them.
The Bladderwort, which is a water plant, has a very different 
method of securing its prey.
Some of the branches which are 
leafless bear small bladder-like bodies ; these open by a valve 
inwards, so that small water animals (through motives of curiosity, 
it is thought,) get into these traps ; and although the entrance is 
not easy, the exit is impossible, and they are thus imprisoned for 
life.
In passing from the higher to the lower portions of the fell 
district, we may find acres of ground almost covered with Blea- 
berries.
The Cowberry also grows on the fells, but more 
sparingly.
The Crowberry is plentiful on the heaths ; and also on the 
softer mossy parts the Cranberry is very abundant.
The Cranberry on the Ennerdale fells produces two kinds of 
berries, the grey and the red berries ; whilst on boggy ground the 
Lancashire Asphodel cannot be over-looked with its showy spike 
of orange-coloured flowers.
The beautiful Menyanthes is also common in the boggy pools, 
not only of the hilly district, but throughout the whole of West 
Cumberland.
The elegant autumn flower, the Grass of Parnassus, 
is frequent in many parts, particularly in Lamplugh, Black Moss, 
Egremont, and St. Bees Moor.
Lobelia Dortmanni is plentiful in Ennerdale Lake, and the pebbly 
beach is covered in some places with the shore weed Liioreila 
lacustris.
The Alpine Enchanter Nightshade, the small Teesdalia, the 
pretty white Corydalis, all grow on the borders of the lake, where 
also may be found the Sweet Briar, the Sweet-scented Willow 
( Salix peniandra), and abundance of the small shrub Myrica 
Gale, or Sweet Gale.
The large order Ranunculace^e can claim many representatives 
in the hilly portion of the district.
The Meadow Rue, Thalidrum 
minus, grows in the side wood, Ennerdale Lake ; Columbine by 
the shores of Crummock Lake ; the small Ranunculus Lenormandi, 
the Ivy-leaved Ranunculus, and the rare Raminculus reptans, are 
common in Ennerdale.
Caltha mi7ior and the Globe Flower both 
grow in the valley at no great distance from the Lake ; and lastly, 
the Traveller's Joy, Clematis vitalba (so peculiarly attractive when 
in seed), is not absent from West Cumberland, being found in the 
neighbourhood of Ravenglass.
The Yellow Narcissus is an abundant plant in the district, 
growing most luxuriantly in the Duddon valleys.
With regard to 
the Water Lilies, both the Yellow and the White grow in Lowes- 
water Lake, Mockerkin Tarn, and in ponds west of Egremont ; 
but they are absent from Ennerdale Lake.
On leaving the hills and going westward, we find the Mountain 
Limestone district stretching in a narrow belt from Egremont 
northwards to Lamplugh and Pardshaw.
Between the limestone 
and the sea north of Bigrigg Moor, we have the Coal Measures ; 
and south of Bigrigg Moor and Egremont the New Red Sand- 
stone.
These different rocks, as is well known, affect the agricultural 
value of the land to a great extent, and also in a similar degree the 
growth of native plants.
Consequently we find there is a consider- 
able difference in the general character of the Flora of each 
district.
There are however many differences even in the Flora of different 
parts of the Coal Measure district, as in the other geological 
districts, which may be noted but cannot be explained.
For 
instance, the Common White Dead Nettle, which is one of the 
most abundant of wayside flowers at Workington and Harrington, 
disappears in the neighbourhood of Whitehaven, and occurs again 
only in a very limited degree near Egremont and Ennerdale 
Bridge.
The same may be said of a variety of common plants which are 
localized in their distribution, being very frequent in some parts of 
the district, and entirely absent from other parts where the soil 
and situation appear to be equally suitable for their growth.
We find many plants that seem to have their natural habitat in 
the Mountain Limestone district, and many others that flourish 
ai 
best on that soil.
For instance, the Giant Bell flower (Campanula 
laiifolia), which towers to the height of five feet ; a noble specimen 
of our native Flora, almost equalling the Fox-glove, which, by the 
way, is most abundant in the whole district, and is occasionally 
found pure white both in Loweswater and near Egremont.
Another 
characteristic plant of the limestone district is the largest of our 
wild Geraniums, Geranium pratense, which is abundant in Lam- 
plugh, but is mostly absent from the non-limestone districts.
The 
rich crimson Geranium sanguineum grows also on the limestone, 
but is more abundant on the sea banks and cliffs ; and the bright- 
leaved Geraniutn lucidum seems partial to the limestone district ; 
it is absent from the immediate neighbourhood of Whitehaven.
The pretty Geranium columbinum is found in the neighbourhood 
of Cockermouth and Saint Bees.
The Soft-leaved Geranium, the 
Cut-leaved species, the Dove's-foot Crane's-bill, and Herb Robert, 
are very common, and may be found by the wayside, in hedges, or 
railway banks in the whole district.
The dark Geranium phaum 
grows in several places, generally near farm houses or gardens, 
and is a doubtful native; while Geranium sylvaticufn, the tall 
flowering species, occurs in Eskdale, and grows freely about 
Bassenthwaite and Keswick.
The genus Geranium may be said 
to be well represented in West Cumberland, both as regards 
number of individuals and of species.
There are many other plants that follow the limestone, or that 
seem to thrive best upon a soil underlaid by that rock.
One may 
be mentioned that is seldom if ever found in this district off the 
limestone, that is Plantago media, or Hoary Plantain, a plant 
distinguished from the Common Plantago major by its spike of 
light lilac-colored flowers.
The Cowslip is more common on limestone than elsewhere, and 
the Primrose also.
The Primrose covers acres of ground on the 
Clints at Egremont ; but the plants, though very numerous, are 
small.
On the slopes of the railway between Saint Bees and 
Nethertown they attain fine proportions; one root — though by 
no means the largest— had one hundred and fifty-six expanded 
flowers, and a number of buds ready to come forward as the 
6 
82 
flowers died.
The variety with reddish flowers is scarce, but have 
been met with in the meadows both at Whitehaven and at 
Egremont 
Some plants which are considered by the compilers of the 
London Catalogue to be naturalized plants only, seem to have a 
native character in West Cumberland.
Amongst these may be 
mentioned the pretty little cHmbing plant, Linaria cymbalaria, 
which is abundant on old walls, bridges, and old buildings near to 
water throughout the district, apparently growing in the most 
spontaneous manner.
Another plant belonging the large order UmbellifeR/E which is 
called a denizen or naturalized plant by Mr. Watson, has also the 
appearance of being in this district native to the soil.
The plant 
referred to is the well known Sweet Bracken, Myrrhis odorata, which 
is found so generally distributed as to merit the name of native.
Twenty-seven species of this order have been found in the district, 
amongst the most common of which are the poisonous CEnanihe 
crocata.
This plant is very frequent in watery places.
Hemlock and Fool's Parsley are also common.
The Gout weed 
yEgopodium is found in waste places near houses, having been used 
in old times as a culinary herb.
There is an absence of yellow- 
flowered umbels in the district, the only exception noted so far is 
a small patch oi Silaus pratensis, Pepper Saxifrage, which grows at 
Pardshaw.
The order Composite is largely represented in the district, the 
railway slopes contributing very largely to the fifty-eight species 
catalogued by the members of the section.
This number it is 
expected will be largely added to hereafter.
Crepis biennis and C.
paludosa have both been found by Mr.
William Nixon.
Burdock is a common plant on waste ground.
Senecio viscosus grows at Cleator Moor, and Senecio saracenicus at 
Howgate, Moresby, not far from the Roman Station, and is 
supposed to be a relic of Roman occupation.
Aster tripolium grows near Egremont; Centaurea scabiosa between 
Woodend and Egremont ; Centaurea Cyaniis by the banks of the 
83 
River Ehen ; and the rare Star Thistle, Cetitaurea calcitrapa, by 
the same river side.
To refer, however, to all the interesting species, would far 
outstrip the limits of this paper.
On the sea shore from Saint 
Bees southwards we find the large Yellow-horned Poppy, Glaticiiim 
luieum, growing freely, though not abundantly ; and within two or 
three miles from Nethertown shore we may meet with all the 
species (with one exception) of the order Papaverace/e, or wild 
poppies and their allies which are recorded as belonging to our 
native Flora.
Of these it may be said that the Celandine, or Wart 
Grass, generally grows near houses ; and that theVVelsh poppy is 
doubtfully wild in the district.
What a variety of wild flowers we find on the sea cliffs !
The 
free-flowering Vicia sylvatica, or Wood Vetch, spreads its profuse 
blossoms over the rocky and broken ground; while its near 
relative, the Narrow-leaved Everlasting Pea, Lathyrus sylvestris, 
with its beautiful clusters of rich colored blossoms, is sparingly 
found on similar ground near to Parton.
A very rare member of 
the same genus has been found by Mr. Kendall, near to Saint Bees, 
This is the Marsh Vetchling, Lathyrus palustris, which has hitherto 
not been known as a West Cumberland plant.
By the banks of the river Ehen we have the rare Sand Leek, 
Allium scorodoprasum, growing freely from Egremont down to 
Braystones; Peppermint near Egremont; and the Larger Skull 
Cap near to Low Mill.
The Lesser Skull Cap grows in Black Moss, at Wormgill, and 
on some of the mosses.
The ponds and mosses south of Saint Bees teem with interesting 
plants.
The large tarn near Sellafield is overgrown with the Club Rush, 
Typha latifolia.
Braystones Tarn furnishes the peculiar-looking 
plants, Alisma ranuticuloides, and the Marsh Speedwell, Veronica 
scutellata.
Lady Moss produces the Marsh St. John's Wort, 
Hypericum elodes ; and Water Purslane, Peplis portula ; and the 
curious little plant known as Pill Wort, with the bristle-like leaves 
and little globular capsules from which it derives its name.
84 
The ponds and mosses just named look pale and insignificant, 
however, when compared with the floral grandeur of Church Moss, 
Beckermet.
On one side we have the Nightshade, Solammi 
dulcamara, growing in profusion.
In another part the Petty Whin 
flourishes.
It is now a rare plant in West Cumberland, owing to 
the gradual improvement of land by the drainage of mosses.
Luxuriant plants of Loose-strife are abundant, with their rich 
clusters of red flowers ; and the tall Narrow-leaved Willow Herb, 
Epilobhim aiigiistifoUum, towers to a height of four or five feet, 
rivalling in beauty our most treasured garden flowers.
In thus glancing over the general characteristics of the West 
Cumberland Flora, many rare and interesting species are necessarily 
passed over unnoticed.
The subject is full of interest ; there is a large field open for 
observation and exploration, which will require the united strength 
of all the local societies to thoroughly investigate.
The members of the Whitehaven Botanical Section would be 
glad to see the members of the affiliated societies take up the 
subject of Field Botany in their own districts, and co-operate in 
the publication of a complete County Flora.

ON THE WING; OR, BIRD LIFE.
By CHAS.
a. PARKER, M.D.
(Read at IVIiitehaven, October i^th, iSSo. j 
The Eagle, save an exceedingly rare and passing visitor, has 
entirely disappeared from our district; and the noblest bird of 
prey that still remains with us is 
The Peregrine Falcon.
This really magnificent bird possesses great powers of flight, and, from its 
frequent exertion of these powers, has derived its name of Falco peregrinus, or 
The Wandering Hawk.
It is found in most parts of the world, and has often 
been seen at a great distance from land.
Whether it is partly migratoi7 is not 
fully ascertained, but there seems little doubt that the old birds expel their 
young when able to take care of themselves, and remain by themselves in their 
old district.
Their flight is extremely rapid, and has been likened to that of the Rock 
Dove, flying generally near the ground with quickly-repeated beatings of its 
long pointed wings, and seldom sailing or soaring like the Buzzard.
Its speed is tremendous ; Montague having calculated it to be as much as one 
hundred and fifty miles an hour ; and Col. Thornton, an expert falconer, 
calculated one to travel nine miles in eleven minutes when in pursuit of a snipe, 
without including the turnings, being at a rate of nearly sixty miles an hour.
I once saw one near the Screes at Wastwater.
As soon as it saw me it turned 
abruptly and sped like an arrow directly across the vaUey to Buckbarrow, and 
seemed to me to easily accomplish a full mile within the minute.
With such 
speed as this we might naturally expect the falcon to be sometimes killed or 
injured when striking prey near the ground ; but this very rarely occurs, though 
instances have been known of pursuer and pursued being dashed against a tree 
or stone in the ardour of pursuit.
No doubt at the very instant of striking its 
prey the wings of the Peregrine are sloped slightly upward and forward, which, 
106 
aided by the recoil of the blow, causes it to rise in the air with a beautiful 
upward sweep, gracefully curving round to pick up the dead bird.
Sometimes 
both hawk and quarry will tower upwards till both are out of sight.
A Pere- 
grine has been known to cut a snipe in two and to strike off the head of a grouse 
at one blow.
When a duck is struck, the unfortunate bird is frequently 
lacerated from end to end.
They feed entirely on what they kill for themselves ; 
the list including all smaller birds and many larger, even the Capercailie and 
the Kestrel ; also hares, rabbits, other small animals, and occasionally fish.
They cast up pellets of the indigestible parts of their prey like owls do.
Very 
seldom do they strike at a bird upon the water, though one has been known to 
carry off a Guillemot out of a swimming flock ; and the sea-birds being apparently 
quite aware of this, generally take refuge at once upon the water when pursued 
by it.
The Peregrine will often strike down several birds in succession without 
picking them up, and will take shot game right before the spoi'tsman.
On one 
occasion two gentlemen were grouse-shooting, and one of them wounded a bird 
which was almost immediately struck down by a Peregrine, who, without 
wailing, knocked down two brace more out of the pack and then made off, 
leaving the sportsmen to pick up their easily-earned game.
Their clutch is not 
so fatal as their stroke, birds having been carried a long distance without being 
much the worse for it.
A Peregrine has been known to carry a Blackcock several 
miles to its nest.
They build early in the Spring, and if one of them is shot, the other is sure 
to return soon with a fresh mate.
The nest is flat in shape, and placed on some 
inaccessible ledge or crevice of a cliff, or rarely in a lofty tree.
It is made of 
sticks lined with sea-weed, hair, etc.
Sometimes an old one is repaired, or a 
mere hollow in the rock suffices.
Their chief breeding places in Britain are : — Kilnsea Crag — the cliffs of the 
Isle of Wight, of Devon, and of Cornwall — Beachy Head — Bass Rock — Great 
Orme's Head — Llandudno — the Isle of Man — the Vale of Moffat — St. Abbs 
Head — Ailsa Crag — Portpatrick, etc., in Scotland.
In our own district it chooses the steepest and most precipitous 
crags.
The nest is well hidden, and is usually discovered by seeing 
the old birds go to it.
They nest occasionally on St. Bees Head, 
as well as on Skiddaw, near Thirlmere, and on Scawfell.
There 
are about four pairs in the district as a rule, and they do not seem 
to increase or decrease in number.
This particular bird (exhibited) 
was killed in the covers at Newton Manor, near Gosforth, in 
November, 1878.
Another was shot that year on Birker Fell, and 
I saw one near Wastwater in May, 1879.
0"^^ was seen in Gosforth 
107 
parish in March, 1879, and another was shot at Muncaster; and 
one near Hallbolton, October, 1880.
The Buzzard.
In spite of the size and fine appearance of the Buzzard, and its 
general likeness in colour and flight to the Eagle, its character is 
entirely different.
It is both cowardly and lazy, and has been 
known to fly before the little Sparrow-hawk.
This is the generally 
accepted opinion ; but I have seen a Buzzard attack and get the 
better of a pair of Carrion Crows.
It was of no use at all for 
hawking.
It is very generally distributed over England, though fast 
disappearing in the south.
Here amongst the mountains it holds 
its own very fairly, though not so numerous as it was some years 
since.
It is the commonest large hawk we have, and one or more 
may generally be seen in the course of a walk across the fells.
It 
is a very striking bird, its large broad blunt wings (so different to 
the pointed pinions of the Peregrine,) making it conspicuous 
against the sky, and its slow circling flight (unlike the dash of the 
last-named bird,) giving plenty of time for observation.
The Buzzard is said to fly low ; but nine times out of ten when I have seen 
them, they have been soaring high in the air at an elevation of several hundred 
feet.
This peculiar slow soaring in circles has gained it its name of Glead, 
which is derived from the Anglo-Saxon verb Glidan, to glide.
The bird goes slowly 
round and round in huge circles, without any perceptible motion of its wings ; 
it goes away from you, turns with a slight swing and comes back, till you 
involuntarily watch for the moment when the impetus will subside and the bird 
be compelled to flap its wings.
How these circles are completed against the 
wind, without perceptible muscular effort, is hard to say.
When flushed the Buzzard rises slowly like the Eagle, the light and dark 
markings showing conspicuously even when high up.
It often sits for a long 
time on a rock or stump watching for prey, or perhaps guarding the nest.
They 
keep very much to one haunt, and may be seen day after day at nearly the 
same hour beating the same piece of ground.
The note is extremely harsh, 
hence its local name of Shreak.
The Buzzard is of course persecuted by the gamekeeper, though it does little 
harm and a fair amount of good.
It feeds on and destroys numberless moles, 
rats, snakes (especially vipers), frogs, toads, worms, newts, and insects.
So 
108 
much for the good.
It will also take a leveret era very young moor game, 
but it has not the pluck to touch them unless very young and wfeak.
I have 
heard them accused of attacking lambs, but have never been able to get any 
proof of their doing so, and do not believe that such is the case.
Moles and 
snakes are its favourite food.
It is of special use in corn-growing countries.
Indeed, had I a grouse-moor, I should protect both Peregrine and Buzzard, 
believing as I do that they do far more good than harm.
It does not take its 
prey by pursuit, but prowls about quartering the ground and pouncing upon any 
unlucky creature it comes across.
These birds pair in the beginning of March, building, in this 
district, almost always on ledges on the precipices of our moun- 
tains, and only very seldom in a tree.
The nests are often very 
difficult of access, sometimes quite out of reach, unless a rope is 
used.
The nest is large, and built of sticks lined with wool and 
moss.
It is sometimes based on an old nest of its own or some 
other birds.
They do not drive away their young as most other 
hawks do.
They are very fond of incubating, even in captivity.
I have 
several eggs in my possession which have been laid by tame 
Buzzards, and I have known one bring up a chicken; and, 
reversing the order, I have known one brought up by a Bantam 
hen, the difference in size between the foster mother and the 
young bird being most ridiculous.
The eggs are three or four in 
number, and rather round.
The brown markings increase in size 
and depth of colour as the bird grows older.
Two Buzzards have, for the last three or four years, constantly 
haunted Blengdale, a small valley close to the village of Gosforth.
There are no crags on the sides of the valley, and only some half- 
dozen trees in it ; so the birds, rather than quit their accustomed 
haunt, built their nest in a Common Thorn bush about eight feet 
from the ground.
Hearing of this unusual nesting place, I went 
to examine it, but arrived too late.
The nest was there in the 
bush, apparently based on the remains of an old one, but the three 
eggs, which were remarkably well coloured specimens, had been 
taken that morning by a neighbouring gamekeeper.
Exactly a 
month afterwards I revisited the valley, and found that the 
obstinate birds still held possession.
About three hundred yard 
109 
higher up than the bush was a small scar, about twenty-five feet 
high, out of which grew a stunted tree holding a fresh nest con- 
taining three eggs, on which the hen bird was sitting.
Scrambling 
down to examine the eggs, I found the second lot almost as deeply 
coloured as the first three, which had meanwhile been placed under 
a tame hen buzzard.
She sat upon them for thirty-one days, and 
hatched all three ; but, in spite of the united care of both bird and 
keeper, they all died when about ten days old.
The old bird 
always sucked and chewed a piece of meat for three or four minutes 
before she gave it to the young ones.
Afterwards a half-grown 
Buzzard was procured from a third nest, and given to the tame one 
to rear, but this also she failed to do.
The smaller hawks, viz., the Kestrel, the Sparrow-hawk, and the 
Merlin, are all abundant in this district, the Merlin being the 
rarest of the three ; and I have seen five species of owls, four of 
which are common.
Among the Dentirostres, or Tooth billed birds, are the 
Thrushes, many of which are very familiar to us.
I have a few 
specimens here.
The Dipper, a very common and pretty little 
bird, which frequents our mountain streams.
Here is a rare 
species, the Golden Oriole, which was killed in Mun caster parish 
in 1857.
Here are three others belonging to the same group, two 
Blackbirds and a Song-thrush, which are chiefly remarkable for not 
being black or brown, as the case may be.
They were all killed near 
Gosforth; and I have seen four or five more Blackbirds in that district 
more or less marked with white.
This curious albinism is not 
uncommon, and it is probably caused by some defect in the consti- 
tution of the bird, which prevents the proper amount of pigment- 
cells being formed.
I have seen several Rooks at Calder Abbey 
with white feathers or patches, and Dr. I'Anson of Whitehaven 
saw in January, 1879, a perfectly white Sparrow.
Here is a Starling of a very light colour; and here a most 
remarkable Waterhen, which was shot on Hallsenna Moor in June, 
1877.
This Waterhen is of a light fawn colour all over, with the 
exception of the usual white markings.
The primary wing 
110 
feathers are especially light ; the bill, legs, and eyes are of the 
usual colour.
The sub-order Conirostres contains the Larks, Buntings, 
Finches, Starlings, and Crows.
With the exception of the Chough 
and that rare bird the Nutcracker, all the British Corvidse are well 
represented in this district, the Hooded Crow alone being rare.
Almost universally disliked as they are, the stronger kinds need all 
their well-known sagacity and cunning to enable them to hold their 
own even in this comparatively wild country.
Facile princeps stands 
The Raven.
This fine bird is still commonly to be seen and heard upon 
the fells, circling round and round high out of gunshot, croaking 
hoarse defiance at man — the only enemy he dreads, if we except 
the Peregrine.
The Raven soars exceedingly high, far above the 
tops of our highest mountains, from which altitude he is able to 
survey a wide tract of country, and use his keen sight to discover 
carrion or other food, which he does with wonderful quickness.
The Raven occasionally also feeds on young ducks, chickens, 
small quadrupeds, moles, eggs, grain, grubs, reptiles, and shell-fish, 
not unfrequently visiting the yards and "middens" of the fell farms 
in the early hours of the morning.
They are known to pair for 
life, and are generally seen in company.
I once saw three together 
on the top of Coniston Old Man. The nest is placed on the 
ledges of rocky cliffs and precipices, generally in some most 
inaccessible spot; though one nest which I visited in 1879, near 
Keswick, was not more than twenty feet from the ground, and 
within five hundred yards of a farm-house.
From another nest a 
young bird was brought to me, which I kept for some weeks till 
he escaped, and I watched him wing his way back to his native 
hills rejoicing.
I had hoped to have been able to show you a live 
Raven to-night which I had succeeded in taming so that I was 
able to keep him quite at liberty in the garden.
Often when I 
when I went out riding he would fly above my head for a consider- 
able distance, and perch on the roof of any house I visited.
His 
Ill 
tameness proved his ruin : some kindly person murdered him with 
a brickbat in my absence.
In 1878 I knew of two nests, one of 
which was savagely destroyed by a keeper, who, unable to get at 
the nest, went up the opposite side of the gorge and bombarded it 
from a distance till he could no longer hear the cries of the young 
birds.
The market value of the egg and young bird is too well 
known to the dalesman ; but the early breeding season of the 
Raven stands him in good stead, as at that time the mountains are 
generally covered with snow and ice, which add immensely to the 
difficulty of climbing the rocky fastnesses of his home.
They 
expel their young when able to fly, from the immediate neighbour- 
hood of the nest, and I fancy many of them wander down to the j 
Yorkshire moors, and there meet an untimely fate.
The eggs are 
from four to seven in number.
Locally they are often called 
Corbies.
The Carrion Crow 
Is like a smaller edition of the Raven.
These birds are exceed- 
ingly abundant here, in spite of the most untiring persecution.
The Crow has all the cunning of its larger congener.
The nesting 
habits, however, differ, for the Crow nests in trees in the valleys, 
avoiding the rocks, and, as a rule, the woods which grow higher 
up the fell sides.
In Blengdale, in 1879, I found four nests within 
a distance of about five hundred yards.
I do not think there were 
more than a dozen trees in the valley, some being very small, and 
two of the nests were in thorn bushes not more than eight feet 
from the ground.
There were three more nests not far off.
The 
gamekeepers shoot many of the hen birds when sitting ; but if 
once disturbed, the bird becomes exceedingly wary, leaving her 
nest on the first suspicion of danger.
They are almost impossible 
to trap.
Their note is a harsh "cargh," much hoarser than the 
" caw" of the Rook, and yet differing widely from the croak of the 
Raven.
The Crow is omnivorous, nothing comes amiss to him, 
but it is especially fond of eggs.
I have known them visit a farm- 
yard regularly every morning.
I remember four years ago finding 
112 
the nest of a Partridge in the middle of a wood within ten yards of 
a tree in which was a Crow's nest.
I wonder how many of the 
family survived.
Rooks.
Of Rooks we have any number.
Pied specimens are not 
uncommon.
By watching one of these latter I was able to 
ascertain that the same bird returned to the same field at the 
same hour for several days in succession.
During the late severe 
winters the Rooks killed and ate many Redwings and other small 
birds ; but the cold was too much even for them, as I found them 
under the trees in the mornings scarcely able to move, having 
evidently fallen off their perches through the night.
The Jackdaw 
Is abundant, but rather local.
They are very numerous near 
Keswick, where colonies of them congregate like Rooks, and nest 
together in the Skiddaw cliffs.
There are many, too, at Calder 
Abbey.
I have seen there a nest mass nearly six feet high, com- 
pletely filling up a narrow spiral staircase.
The noisy chattering 
habits of the Jacks, as they are called, are well known.
The Magpie 
Is very common, and is almost always called the "Piet." I have 
counted as many as eleven in one field in Wastdale.
There are 
seldom less than three seen together, and four or five is quite an 
ordinary number.
In November, 1879, a three-legged Magpie 
was shot near Silecroft The third leg was between the two normal 
ones, and was rather smaller, being white in colour, as were also 
the claws.
The Jay.
The noisy screeching Jay is often heard in our woods; less often 
seen, for it is a wary bird, and seems to know its danger.
It is 
curious to notice how these birds hurry across an open space, 
113 
taking refuge in every bushy tree by the way.
Their egg-sucking 
crimes cause them to be persecuted by gamekeepers, which is 
rather a pity, as both Jay and Magpie are very ornamental to the 
scenery they inhabit.
No doubt all the Crow kind do good by 
devouring what would become prejudicial if left alone.
The Jay 
is generally called "Jay Piet." 
A Nutcracker (Nucifraga caryocatades ) was seen in Nether- 
witton wood, Northumberland, in the autumn of 1819, by Captain 
Robert Mitford, R.N.
The Hooded Crow 
I have only heard of twice near here, though common enough in 
many parts of England.
One was shot in 1880 near Seascale.
It 
is a powerful and fierce bird, much resembling the Carrion Crow 
in its nature and habits.
Some good authorities have lately 
affirmed these two birds to be merely varieties of the same 
species.
Amongst the Fissirostres, or Cleft-billed birds, passing over 
the commoner species, such as the Swallow, we find one of the 
most curious and interesting of our British birds, viz.
— 
The Nightjar.
This is a bird with a multitude of names, and which has been disliked and 
regarded as a bird of evil omen from the earliest times.
Certainly its habits 
and appearance are peculiar and striking.
The inordinately large eye, the 
minute beak, being a mere entrance to the enormous mouth with its bristly 
appendages — its noiseless, ghost-like flight, and its pecuhar low jar-r-r-ing note, 
heard only in the twilight of evening, would naturally impress a superstitious 
people unfavourably.
Aristotle calls it Aigothelas, accusing it of sucking 
goats, and adding that the teat afterwards becomes dry and the animal blind.
.(Elian and Pliny say the same, and the superstition has not yet disappeared 
altogether.
Hence its name of Goatsucker ; though in this country it was 
supposed to attack cows, and also to have the power to inflict on calves a fatal 
distemper by striking at them.
The Puckeridge disease was really caused by 
maggots laid in the skin of the calf by a kind of fly (CEstncs bovis), and if the 
Night-jar was seen striking near them, no doubt it was making a snap at the 
insect which annoyed the animal.

It is found throughout all Europe, in Africa, and parts of Asia.
In this 
country it is migratory, arriving very late— about the middle or the end of May 
—and leaving at the end of September.
The most characteristic habit of the 
Nightjar is that it never perches like other birds across a branch Instead ot 
this, it generally lights upon a comparatively thick bough and rests upon it 
lengthways, crouching with its head so low as nearly to touch the bark.
It is 
generally in this attitude when it utters its low jar-r-r-ing note, something 
between a hiss and a buzz, though it jars or churs when circling round and round 
an oak tree, which is a constant habit of these birds.
Hence the names— Wheel- 
bird, Churn-owl, Jar-owl, Nightjar.
The cock bird sometimes utters a sort of squeak when chasing his mate 
through the oaks.
It is a nocturnal bird, lying quiet all day, either crouched on 
some branch the colours of which assimilate well with its own beautifully 
variegated plumage, or on a stone, or a heap of stones, among brackens.
The 
cock has a white spot near the top of each wing, which are very conspicuous 
when the bird is roused from amongst the fern.
From its fondness for this 
kind of covert, it has gained the name of Fern-owl.
When twilight comes, it 
sallies forth in quest of food, which consists of night moths.
Cockchafers, and 
various other beetles.
It hawks for these on the wing, taking them with its 
mouth, the enormous gape of which enables it to capture and swallow insects 
easily.
Each side of the upper lip (so to speak) is furnished with a number of 
strong bristles called vibrissse, which no doubt assist it in seizing and retaining 
its prey.
Its powers of flight are very great, being equal, if not superior, to the swallow 
in turning and twisting suddenly.
As many as six or seven have been seen 
hawking together for moths.
The Nightjar much resembles the Swift in some particulars : both arrive 
about the beginning of May, both breed but once a summer, both lay two eggs 
—but to these characteristics it adds the downy plumage and large nocturnal 
eye of the owl.
The Rev. Gilbert White in his delightful book says that 
"when a person approaches the haunt of the fern-owls in an evening, they 
continue flying round the head of the obtruder, and by striking their wings 
together above their backs in the manner that the pigeons called smiters are 
known to do, make a sharp snap.
Perhaps at that time they are jealous for 
their young, and their noise and gesture are intended by way of menace." The 
feet as well as the head of the Nightjar are peculiar ; of the three anterior 
toes the middle one is by far the longest, and armed with a long claw, which 
is furnished with a pectinated inner margin exactly resembling a small comb.
The use of this comb has been the subject of much discussion, and is not yet 
certain.
White supposed it was to aid it in capturing its prey, but this can 
hardly be the case ; and as he records having seen the bird bring its foot to its 
mouth, it has been supposed that it uses this comb to clean the vibrissce of its 
115 
mouth from the fragments of the hard wing-cases of the beetles on which it 
feeds.
The Nightjar makes no nest, but lays its two eggs in a mere hollow in the 
ground, with perhaps a few oak leaves in it, generally on a heath or a ride in 
a wood.
The two eggs are laid about the second week in July.
It is tolerably abundant about Gosforth.
I have seen them 
rise from amongst the brackens on Buckbarrow, and in Blengdale, 
as well as on Hallsenna Moor, and near Newton Manor.
For the 
last three seasons I have had eggs brought to me from the last two 
places.
It is not often shot, owing to its lying so close throughout 
the day, which makes it seem rarer than it really is.
They deserve 
to be encouraged, as they do much good by destroying cockchafers, 
etc.
They are exceedingly difficult birds to stuff, the skin being 
as soft as silk, and tearing at the least touch.
The fourth great order of birds are the Waders, which are 
characterized by their long legs and the want of feathers on the 
lower part of the thighs, which enables them to wade to some 
depth without wetting their plumage.
Such as have strong bills 
feed on fish and reptiles ; those in which it is feeble, on worms 
and insects.
I have here a typical specimen of the wading bird, and also a 
beautiful and rare one, viz.
— 
The Bittern.
The provincial names of the Bittern are most extraordinary — Mire Drum, 
Butterbump, Bog-bumper, Bog-jumper, Bog-blutter, Bittour Bumpy-coss, Bull 
of the Bog, are some of them.
It was formerly very plentiful in Britain, and 
was much valued as a game bird for Falconry ; but it has now become very 
rare.
They are generally found in marshy places, and are nocturnal in their 
habits.
During the day they conceal themselves amongst the rushes and flags 
of the marsh, lying close with the head bent back upon the shoulders ; and they 
will frequently allow themselves almost to be trodden upon before taking flight.
More than one pair are seldom to be seen in one swamp, unless it is a very 
large one.
When attacked they defend themselves with great courage, facing the 
danger with half-open wings and holding the beak ready for a stab, while the 
loose plumage of the neck is raised and the head feathers erected so as to form 
a perfectly circular crest.
It nearly always aims for the eyes of its opponent.
116 
When roused they fly shiggishly away uttering a resounding cry.
Their food 
consists of moles, mice, birds, fishes, leeches, snakes, frogs, beetles, etc., and 
is taken by night.
They will swallow whole birds and fishes of considerable 
size.
The best known characteristic of the Bittern is its peculiar cry or ' 'boom," 
from which it derives many of its curious names.
The sound is so strange that 
it has given rise to various superstitions, being doubtless more alarming from 
the solitariness of the places it was generally heard in.
The peasantry supposed 
that the bird thrust its bill into a reed to serve as a pipe for swelling the note 
above its natural pitch.
Others thought that it thrust its bill into the mud or 
water, and by violently blowing, produced its booming.
The real fact is that 
the Bittern usually booms when soaring with a spiral flight high in the air in 
the evening.
It booms six or eight times at once.
The nest is made of sticks and weeds placed in the thickest place it can find 
close to the water.
The eggs are pale brown, and four or five in number.
In the winter of 1830-31, Bitterns were unusually abundant 
throughout the country ; eight being obtained in the neighbourhood 
of Carlisle.
A Bittern was shot in the winter of 1873 on Sellafield 
Tarn, in Beckermet parish.
It had alighted amongst the bull- 
rushes, and had it not been wantonly destroyed, would probably 
have remained about the tarn, which is exactly the kind of place it 
would naturally haunt, in company with the Coots and Mallards.
Ariother was shot the following winter on the River Calder, about 
a quarter of a mile from the tarn.
In 1876 a third was killed 
close to Wreay Castle, Windermere, by Mr. D.
Ainsworth.
A 
fourth in 1879 was shot at Braystones Tarn, about a mile and a 
half from Sellafield Tarn.
Some years ago a fifth was shot by Mr.
Vickers of Birkby Crag as it flew over his yard in the dusk.
It is 
a great pity that this beautiful and interesting bird is never allowed 
a chance of remaining where it would probably breed were it not 
so uniformly persecuted.
A few miles to the south of this town is a long low slip of land 
hemmed in between the river and the sea, about two miles in length, 
and composed almost entirely of sand and shingle.
The wind and 
storm of many years have tossed and driven the sand into hollows 
and ridges of most abrupt and fantastic shapes.
You toil up a 
gently rising slope of sand, sinking to the ankle at every step, only 
to find when you reach the summit, that the ground descends 
117 
again almost perpendicularly to rise afresh a few yards further on.
On the sea side lies the usual bed of shingle, on the river side a 
level tract which is a beautiful estuary at high water, a dreary 
marsh and mud flat when the tide is out.
Dreary to one uninter- 
ested in natural history ; not so to the naturalist, for the whole 
place teems with bird life.
The Wheatear and the Titlark flit from 
every tussock, alighting again close by as if tempting you to follow.
The Peewit wheels and tumbles overhead uttering her perpetual 
plaint.
The shrill rattling whistle of the Oystercatcher is heard 
nearer and nearer as the uneasy bird circles round, loudly pro- 
claiming tlie near vicinity of her nest.
A Heron, till now erect 
and still at the waters edge, marks the warning note, sharply turns 
his head, and then flaps heavily away.
Another follows, and 
another, perhaps half a dozen.
High over head cross and recross 
the noisy Blackheaded Gulls.
We proceed further over the sand 
hills.
As we top one of the ridges, out impetuously dashes a 
startled Stock-dove almost under our feet from her nest in some 
deserted rabbit-hole.
The rabbits themselves scatter in all 
directions.
As we come in sight, the gulls get noisier and come 
nearer, and we are soon in the midst of the gullery.
Nests lie 
thick on the ground, containing eggs and young in all stages.
The 
old birds are nearly frantic, hundreds are now whirling round only a 
few yards off, incessantly cawing ; and if you stoop over a nest, the 
owner of it will swoop by almost within reach of your hand.
Mingled with them are birds of smaller size and still more elegant 
flight.
The Common Tern or Sea-Swallow, and the still smaller 
and more beautiful Lesser Tern, are both there careering and 
screaming like the gulls.
The eggs of both are to be found, but 
require more looking for than those of the gulls, especially the 
Lesser Tern, which lays it eggs on the bare shingle.
The Ringed Plover too, very difficult to see against the sand 
and stones, is heard piping ; and as we look down the river we see 
two or three pair of the loveliest of our wild ducks, the Shelldrake, 
flying up stream conspicuous by their brilliantly-coloured plumage.
High up and far out of range floats a solitary Great Black-backed 
Gull, croaking hoarsely, and the other smaller and commoner 
118 ' 
gulls sail occasionally by.
Far out on the sand at the edge of the 
water are two black objects, and, at the very extremity of the point 
another, so still that you might easily mistake them for stumps of 
wood, or the remains of some old fish garth.
These also are birds, 
Cormorants watching for prey.
Every morning early the Cor- 
morant leaves his rocky haunt at St. Bees Head, and betakes 
himself to the mouth of the rivers.
There he fishes all day, and 
at sundown hies him back again to his resting place for the night.
Heavy ungainly bird as he looks, when once fairly started for St, 
Bees he will beat any Furness locomotive hollow.
And yet I 
have known a person walk along this shore and say there was 
nothing to do or to look at.
Speaking of Gulls and Cormorants brings us into the fifth and 
last great order, the Swimmers.
This order is very well represented 
here in all its branches.
During the last four years I have had 
brought to me no less than nine species of ducks, and have seen a 
tenth which was killed some years ago.
Swans and Geese are included in the same order with the duck, 
the commonest of the geese being, I think, the Bernicle, which 
occurs each year in varying numbers.
The Bernicle Geese are abundant in the Arctic regions, Iceland, and the 
North of Europe.
They migrate to the south for the winter, keeping to the 
sea-coast and flying in considerable flocks.
They are here from the end of 
October till March.
The head and bill of this goose are exceedingly small.
Speaking of the Bernicle Geese leads us to the subject of the Migration of 
Birds, as it is the bird about whose annual joumeyings to and from this country 
we know most.
The popular ideas about Migration are very loose, the birds 
being supposed to go either north or south as the case may be, in a happy-go- 
lucky sort of manner, chance having a great deal to do with the country they 
alight in.
But this is by no means the case.
The bird leaves our shores with 
a fixed purpose.
It knows where it is going, and which way it will go by, and 
in all probability will not stray more than a mile to the right or left of its 
purposed track in the whole course of its long journey.
How does it know its 
way, and why does it choose that particular track ?
which is often by no means 
the easiest it might choose.
Take the Mediterranean Sea for instance ; the 
great mass of small migratory birds do not cross at Gibraltar, nor from Sicily to 
119 
Tunis, the two narrowest points.
Numbers do cross there certainly, but the 
mass of them cross at one of the broadest parts of the sea.
The bird finds its way chiefly by Memory.
In its first migration it probably 
followed its parents closely, and so learnt the way ; but whether that be the 
case or not, I believe it would take the same track by what has been called 
Hereditary-, or Instinctive Memory.
For countless ages its ancestors have 
followed exactly the same track.
Individuals which were weak in sight, or not 
strong on the wing, probably lost their way and perished, the doctrine of the 
"survival of the fittest" came into play, and a keen-sighted strong- winged 
progeny was the result.
In the same way as when you teach a dog to point 
game, its puppy will point of its own accord without teaching, that is, by 
instinct ; so the instinctive impulse to travel by a particular route has descended 
from bird to bird, gaining strength as it descended.
And this ti'avelling by 
memory gives us the clue to the reason why they follow an apparently needlessly 
dangerous route.
Let us examine the track of the Bemicle Geese, which is so well known and 
defined that it may be marked by a line on the map.
The Bemicles breed in 
the extreme north, amongst the dreary Arctic icebergs.
When they start on 
their journey towards the south, one division of them, coming from Greenland, 
fly over Iceland and the Fseroe Isles to the west coasts of Scotland, England, 
and Ireland.
A second division, starting from Spitzbergen, cross the Arctic 
Sea to North Cape in Norway, and, following the line of the Norwegian coast 
as far as it extends westward, divides, one lot flying over the Shetland Isles to 
the east coast of Scotland, the other following the Norway coast down to the 
Skaggererack, and then flying straight across the North Sea to the Coast of 
Northumberland and Durham.
A third division of this great army come vid, 
Nova Zembla down the White Sea, and across a whole chain of lakes to the 
Gulf of Finland.
They follow the Baltic down to Denmark, and cross over 
Schleswig Holstein to the mouth of the Elbe, where enormous gatherings of 
birds are to be seen in the migratory season.
They now divide, one lot 
following the coast of Holland, France, and Spain, the other going up the 
valley of the Rhine down the valley of the Rhone to the coasts of Italy ; some 
even crossing by Sardinia to Africa.
Thus we see that this bird which was 
shot at Drigg came from Greenland ; had he been killed at Newcastle, he would 
have been a native of Spitzbergen.
This travelling by memory explains the reason why a particular route is taken.
Ages ago, when Europe was utterly different in shape to what it is now, the 
wild geese chose this track, and their descendants ever since have followed 
obediently their airy way.
High in the air with nothing to guide them, sea and 
sky alone in sight, their marvellous instinctive memory leads them unerringly 
year by year.
And this has been abundantly proved by the ocean soundings 
that have been taken during the last few years.
From the east coast of England 
120 
to Norway a ridge of shoal-water extends across the North Sea. From Caith- 
ness to Iceland is a still more marked one, having but one comparatively 
narrow, deep, gap in its whole extent.
This was once above the surface of the 
water, the Fseroe Isles being now the only part of it that so remains.
As now, 
so then, the birds followed the coast line of this land, and though the land has 
disappeared ages ago beneath the waves of the Atlantic, the geese of this 
century come and go the same way in safety.
But it matters not — wherever we turn, or what individual we 
analyse throughout the whole kingdom of winged creatures; whether 
it is the wonderful power of the Frigate Bird — the deadly and 
magnificent swoop of the Falcon — the swift running of the Ostrich 
— the sagacity of the Raven — the dazzhng plumage of the Humming 
Bird — the marvellously beautiful nest of the Chaffinch — or the 
ingenuity of the Tailor Bird, which actually sews leaves together 
to form its nest with a thread of its own making — we always arrive 
at the same conclusion, and can but exclaim with the Psalmist of 
old : " Oh Lord, how wonderful are thy works ; in wisdom hast 
thou made them all."

NOTES ON A SUBMERGED FOREST 
OFF CARDURNOCK ON THE SOLWAY; AND ON 
THE DESTRUCTION OF SKINBURNESS BY THE SEA 
ABOUT THE YEAR [305.
By T.
V. HOLMES, F.G.S.
(Read at the Maryport Annual Meeting.) 
Some years ago, on beginning work on the Geological Survey in 
north-west Cumberland, I heard that traces of what seemed to be 
a submerged forest were, or had lately been, visible off Cardurnock, 
at the west end of the Bowness peninsula.
On visiting that place, 
however, a year or two afterwards, nothing could be seen on the 
broad expanse of Cardurnock Flatts but sand and boulders.
As 
the locality is not easily accessible either from Wigton or Carlisle, 
and my visit had been made under most favourable conditions as 
regards tide, I felt that my chief hopes of information lay in a 
possible change in the channels of the estuary, and in the memories 
of the older inhabitants of the neighbourhood.
But I thought 
little more of the matter till my interest in it was revived by a 
sight, last year, of the remains of the submerged forest at St. Bees.
Having neglected, however, to make enquiries about the Cardur- 
nock Forest before leaving Cumberland, I wrote last winter to Mr.
R. B.
Brockbank, the first discoverer of the Lias in Cumberland, 
(from whom I had already received assistance more than once,) 
asking if he knew anything about the Cardurnock forest, and would 
help me by making enquiries about it.
Mr. Brockbank very kindly 
took the matter in hand, and the following is the result of his 
enquiries.
122 
In a letter dated loth of February last he says : — 
" I found an intelligent old man, Eobert Johnston, who told me that 
fifteen or sixteen years ago the channel, which shifts about very much, in 
cutting its way into the sand formed a steep bank on one side, on the edge 
of the wide flat of sand which stretches away from Cardurnock towards 
Criflfel, and laid bare three or four feet of peat, below five or six feet of 
sand." Wood was found imbedded in the peat, "some of which was taken 
out by a person curious in such matters, but when exposed to the air it 
soon 'merled' away." The channel again shifted, and the place became 
covered with sand, and, Mr. Brock bank remarks, "when I saw it to-day 
there was an unbroken stretch of sand, extending, I was informed, two- 
and-a-half miles from the edge of the grass marsh near Cardurnock to where 
the channel is now running.
" 
Some little consolation in the present state of things may be 
found in the fact that the sandy covering effectually preserves the 
submerged forest below from denuding influences, for the edification 
of future generations ; or possibly, even for that of the present, as 
no one can say whether the channels are more likely to be favour- 
able in five years' time or in fifty.
The existence, however, of the forest at such a level, points, like 
that at St. Bees, to the occurrence, in times, geologically speaking, 
recent, of a slight sinking as the last vertical movement to which 
this area has been subjected.
As stated in the paper on the 
Raised Beach of the Cumberland coast by Mr, R.
Russell and 
myself — an abstract of which appears in Part II.
of the Trans.
Cumb: Assoc.
— this subsidence took place, in all probability, some 
time after the elevation of the Raised Beach.
Its effect as regards 
the raised beach was most likely to lower it from perhaps fifty to 
sixty feet above the sea to its present average height of twenty to 
thirty feet.
And the effect of the subsidence on the area now 
occupied at high tide by the waters of the Solway must have been 
to convert a fertile plain watered by many rivers to the state in 
which we now see it — a broad sheet of water at high tide, and a 
sandy plain intersected by ever-shifting water-channels at low.* 
"^In an interesting paper by Mr. J.
D. Kendall, published in the 
Q. J.
Geol.
Soc, Feb. 1881, the vegetable deposits on the shore at Mary- 
port, St. Bees, Drigg, and Walney are considered to be probably interglacial, 
and of the same age as those found inland resting on the Lower Boulder

From this subsidence, which may be considered the last important 
geological event of pre -historic times in this area, I now pass to an 
occurrence which took place between five and six centuries ago — 
the destruction of Skinburness by the sea about A.D. 1305.
The 
facts, as given in the documents which allude to it, may be found 
in Mr. Jenkinson's Guide to Carlisle^ Gils/and, and the Romaft 
Wall.
They are also brought forward by Mr. R.
S. Ferguson in 
his interesting paper on "Roman Cumberland and Westmorland," 
in the Trans.
Cumb.
and West.
Antiq.
and Archseol.
Soc. Mr.
Jenkinson (who states that he has derived many facts about Holme 
Cultram Abbey and District from a paper by Mr. C.
J. Ferguson,) 
thus writes : — 
"In 1301 we read that Bishop Halton granted to the abbot and convent 
of Holme Cultram power to erect a chapel at Skinburness.
In 1305 we 
tind the abbot petitioning that whereas he has paid a fine of one hundred 
marks to the king for a fair or market to be held at Skinburness, and 
whereas that town, together with the way leading to it, is carried away by 
the sea, the king would grant that he may have such fair and market at his 
town of Kirkby Johan {Newton Arlosh) instead of the other place aforesaid, 
and that the charter may be renewed.
Skinburness seems to have been a 
place of some importance, having been used as a dep6t for supplying the 
armies then employed against the Scots." 
Mr. R.
S. Ferguson, in the paper just mentioned, appears to 
think, not unnaturally, that by "the way leading to Skinburness" 
is meant the way between the Abbey and Skinburness ; and says : — 
"These estuaries (of Waver and Wampool) appear to have been 
solid ground occupied by the town of Skinburness till the sea broke 
Clay at Crossgates and Lindall.
But I do not think this explanation likely 
to apply to the Cardurnock forest, which seems to me to owe its existence 
to the general submergence which has produced similar results on various 
parts of the shores of the British Isles, Brittany, Normandy, and elsewhere, 
where inland deposits corresponding to those at Crossgates and Lindall do 
not exist.
Borings through the glacial drift into the underlying rocks near the 
Solway have never yet shown the existence of any interglacial vegetable 
deposit.
But, on the other hand, low-lying post-glacial peat-mosses are 
very abundant there, and evidently had at one time a greater extension 
seaward than they now have.
In the neighbourhood of Cardurnock, for 
example, the peat of the great moss that occupies most of the Bowness 
peninsula abuts against the slightly raised beach.
— t.v.h.
124 
in in the 14th century." And as Mr. Jenkinson in his preface 
acknowledges the assistance of both the Messrs.
Ferguson, all the 
available facts are evidently stated in the paragraph I have quoted 
from the Guide, and Mr. R.
S. Ferguson's view is but a natural 
conjecture based on the supposed position of " the way leading to 
Skinbumess." 
But the acceptance of this view as to the former position of 
Skinburness seems to me to be fraught with many serious difficulties 
from a geological point of view.
In the first place, the broad loamy flats bordering Moricambe 
Bay, (mainly on the north side of the railway between Kirkbride 
and Abbey Town, and on both sides of it between the neighbour- 
hood of the Abbey and Silloth,) gradually and almost imperceptibly 
decrease in height as we approach the present foreshore of the 
Bay. Consequently all existing villages and hamlets are either, 
like Kirkbride and Abbey Town, on the higher ground bordering 
the flats, or, if on the flats, are at a considerable distance from their 
Solway edge, while the cause of their position is usually some two 
or three feet of extra height, as at Newton Arlosh and Calvo.
Besides these there is a third class on the shingle ridges of the 
coast, to which group Beckfoot, Blitterlees, Silloth, and the present 
Skinburness belong.
Now with existing levels — and the pre- 
sumption is on many grounds strongly against either upheaval or 
submergence in this area for many more than five hundred years — 
the Solway edges of these flats must have been still less habitable 
in the days of Edward I.
than they now are, in consequence of 
their then comparatively undrained condition.
But let us suppose (for the sake of argument) that the whole 
district was elevated, many centuries ago, so that the flats of 
Moricambe Bay, now uncovered only at low water, were perma- 
nently high and dry.
Then if a port had existed abutting on the 
combined channel of Waver and Wampool, it would have been in 
no danger whatever of being destroyed by a violent irruption of the 
sea, inasmuch as it must have been as far from anything that could 
be called sea as Kirkbride is now.
On the other hand it is manifest 
that a gradual subsidence from a former more elevated level to the 
125 
present one could not have been the cause of destruction, both on 
account of the suddenness recorded, and because, in that case 
Skinburness would not have been the only sufferer.
The one 
probable agency, therefore, is that erosive force of waves and 
currents, unaided by any change of level, which acts so powerfully 
on the coast of East Anglia at the present day.
It follows then (as the record tends to show) that the destruction 
must have been the consequence of violent irruptions of the sea, 
which took place between the years 1301 and 1305.
But it is 
extremely difficult to understand in what way such irruptions could 
have occurred on the east side of Grune Point.
For the shingle 
ridges which there end — being prevented from extending to the 
north-east by the stream draining Skinburness marsh — are, as the 
discovery of the Roman Camp on them at Beckfoot proves, pre- 
Roman in date ; and their - existence must always have protected 
the land to the east of them from the fury of the waves.
While, 
on the other hand, any destruction in what is now the foreshore 
adjacent to Skinburness marsh, resulting from changes of channel 
in the streams flowing through Moricambe Bay, would not have 
been considered as arising from the sea, nor could it have been of 
the sudden and violent character indicated by the records.
My own view is that Skinburness at the beginning of the 14th 
century occupied a site a few yards westward of its present one, on 
a spot now covered by the waves, and that the " way to it," which 
was also destroyed, was a road along the coast which approached 
it from the south.
This road would keep, like the present one 
from Allonby and Maryport, on the shingle ridges close to the 
shore, and thereby avoid the (then) undrained marshes covering 
so large an area on the eastern side of the ridges.
And the 
destruction of a very few yards of it, when coupled with the expense 
and difficulty of maintaining it against the inroads of the sea, would 
be a sufficient reason for abandoning the remains of Skinburness, 
though so important as a depot in the Scottish wars.
The import- 
ance of Skinburness as a port, at this time, shows that the channels 
to it were comparatively deep, and their navigation fairly free from 
difficulty and danger : advantages which it does not enjoy at 
126 
present, though influences notoriously at work in the Solway might 
at any time reproduce them.
In short, all that could have been necessaiy both to give Skin- 
burness pre-eminence as a port and finally to annihilate it, is 
approximately shown in the Admirality Chait of the Solway as it 
was forty years ago.
The main channel is there seen to run right 
across the centre of Cardurnock Flatts, as they now exist, and to 
pass quite close to the present Skinburness, and over what I have 
supposed to have been the site of the ancient port of that name.
South of Skinburness the channel gets farther and farther away 
from the land, and everywhere but at that place there is a broad 
foreshore.
Granting the existence of a similar state of things 
about the year 1300, it is evident that Skinburness must then have 
been the place most suitable for a port on the Solway.
But, on 
the other hand, a slight easterly bend on the part of the estuary 
channel at Skinburness would have a destructive influence on the 
shore : and the waves at high water would break with special force 
on the only part of the coast not protected by a broad flat foreshore.
In addition, there would be, under the above circumstances, every 
possible facility for the removal of the eroded material from the 
bit of coast thus specially attacked.
With what rapidity the sea can destroy a coast of soft materials 
like that of North Cumberland, where circumstances are favourable 
to destruction, as they would be, on the above supposition, at 
Skinburness, the coasts of Norfolk and SuflR)lk bear especial witness.
And from the greater depth of the sea and much smaller breadth 
of foreshore off East Anglia the waste of land is enormously greater 
there than on the Solway, where indeed it is not likely to be 
noticeable except under special circumstances.
But in East 
Anglia the destruction proceeds with comparative regularity, and 
its extent may be roughly calculated, ^^'hile on the Solway, the 
results being largely influenced by the ever-shifting channels of the 
estuary, the changes in which are extremely rapid and sudden, a 
few years might suffice to convert an obscure village into a promising 
port, and again transform it to a desolate ruin.

Change in the Channel at Silloth.
The Carlisle Journal of April 1st, 1881, contaiDs a paragraph with the 
above heading, in which it is stated : — "The bed of the channel near Silloth 
jetty is gradually returning to the position it occupieil when the Silloth 
Dock was formed.
• • • Very soon after the dock was formed the channel 
commenced to recede from the jetty.
It continued to recede, the sand 
accumulating at the end of the pier to the height of twenty feet.
There 
had been a depth of sixteen feet of water at this point, and the alteration 
in the bed of the channel created inconvenience to steamboats in landing 
passengers.
A dredger was employed in keeping open the channel.
About 
two months ago it became evident that another change had set in, the 
accumulation of sand at the end of the jetty appearing to be getting less.
Since that the sand has been gradually cleared away, and now there is again 
sixteen feet of water at the jetty end, enabling steamboats to land passengers 
there at all times of the tide.
When the channel receded, the sand accu- 
mulated above the outlet of the sewer on the beach to the extent of about 
ten feet.
This is being gradually removed as the channel advances, and, as 
stated, it is expected that the cause of the nuisance complained of at SUloth 
since the outlet of the sewer was filled up will soon exist no longer."

THE LICHENS OF CUMBERLAND.
By the Rev. W.
JOHNSON.
(Read at the Workington Annual Meeting.) 
Lichens are classed amongst the Flowerless Plants, or, in the secondary 
division of the Vigetable Kingdom.
Their position in that division 
naturally falls between the Algre on the one hand and the Fungi on the 
other.
They are closely allied to both these adjoining Classes, still, separ- 
ated from them by the characteristics of a distinct group.
Some modern 
Botanists, on what appear very insufficient grounds, deny that the Lichen 
is an autonomous plant, having a distinctive and independent existence 
and tliey arrange it under the order of Ascomycetous Fungi.
The Lichens 
join the Algae in their gelatinous forms, but differ from them by not living 
under water, by possessing hyphal tissue, and by bearing spores in asci ; 
while the Algae propagate themselves in ways distinct from this.
They are 
marked off from the Fungi on the opposite hand, by the green cells in their 
tissue, which true fungi never have ; and by their different method of 
absorbing nutriment.
The Fungi live at the expense, and by the decay, of 
other organized matter : but the Lichens nourish themselves out of the 
atmosphere.
They are aerial plants, and just as the Algae imbibe their 
food from the surrounding medium of the water, so Lichens absorb theirs 
out of the surrounding medium of the air.
Lichens have no axis, either ascending or descending, and no roots, 
branches, or leaves in the ordinary sense of the word.
The simple plant 
consists of a vegetative and a reproductive system, whiah are as suitable 
and complete for the purpose they have to accomplish, as the organs of the 
highest phaenogam.
The vegetative portion of the Lichen is called the 
thallus.
This always bears the organs of reproduction either upon its 
surface or imbedded in its tissue,"and it may be said to constitute the plant.
It varies very much in its form, and in its hal)it of growth.
Sometimes it 
is filamentous, and is seen hanging in grey and tangled masses from the 
9 
130 
trunks and branches of our forest trees, giving them a bearded and venerable 
appearance.
Sometimes it is fruticulose or shrub-like, growing on trees, or 
upon the face of high rocks.
Another form is that of a horizontal laciniated 
frond, which grows sometimes to a large diameter on the bark of old trees, 
upon the ground, or upon mossy stones.
But the predominant form of 
Lichen-thalhis is what is called the crustaceous form.
This is a light, or 
yellow, or dark-coloured crust, usually circular or oblong in shape, smooth 
or rough upon the surface, found profusely scattered upon rocks, rails, and 
old walls in country distjicts.
As well as the form, the tissue of the lichen- 
thallus also varies in consistence and colour ; but whether frondose or 
crustaceous, its character is the same.
It is entirely cellular, and, in the 
lichen proper, it consists of three distinctly stratified layers.
The first or 
cortical layer, is an elastic or transparent mass of originally globular cells, 
three or four deep, deformed by lateral pressure.
They generally become 
filled with the colouring-matter of the plant.
Adjoining this, and lying 
close beneath it, is the gonidial layer.
This is a stratum of green globular 
cells, usually in a free condition.
The third, or medullary layer, consists 
of a spongy mass of cells which are long and cylindrical in shape.
These 
form the base of the plant, and they are the first development of the spore 
in the production of a new growth.
The torn frond of some of the foliaceous 
species, such as Peltigera, will show these separate layers of cells to the 
naked eye.
An important element which also enters into the constitution 
of the Lichen-thallus, is a gummy or gelatinous substance called licheniue, 
which undoubtedly plays an important part in nourishing the several organs 
of the plant.
Like the Algae, the Lichens are endowed with a double system of repro- 
duction.
The primary and direct method is by sporidia.
These are 
produced in asci, or flask-shaped vesicles, developed in the apothecium.
This apothecium is the female organ, and it consists of a flattened or wart- 
like disc, growing upon the surface or the margin of the thallus.
In most 
species it is easily recognised by the naked eye.
There are other primary 
organs of fructification called spermogones and pycnides, the exact function 
of which is not so clearly understood ; but it is supposed that, in some way 
or other, they are useful in either directly propagating the plant or in 
fecundating the sporidia of the apothecium.
The secondary system of 
reproduction is by the gonidia.
I have already referred to these green 
globular cells, lodged in the tissue of the Lichen-thallus, and called the 
gonidial layer.
These isolated cellules are the most active members of the 
plant, and, once they are produced from the hyphal-ti.ssue, they take the 
leading part in its development.
Gonidia are both vegetative- and repro- 
ductive, and are peculiar to the Lichen-thallus.
They frequently burst 
through the outer coating of the plant and appear as soredia iipon the 
131 
surface, giving it a scabrous or powdery appearance.
From this exposure 
to the air these cellules become distributed, and without any previous 
fertilization multiply the individual.
The growth and habitat of Lichens are various, and much influenced by 
outward conditions.
On account of their densely cellular and somewhat 
spongy nature, they are strongly hygrometric.
They drink up moisture 
with great rapidity.
They flourish in a humid atmosphere free from 
poisonous elements.
Lichens are rarely found in a healthy condition in the 
impure atmosphere of towns.
They have a marvellous power of adaptation.
While they are sensitive to favourable conditions of growth, they can also 
preserve their vitality through long periods of heat and drought.
They are 
likewise capable of enduring intense cold, for when every other sign of 
vegetation has ceased, the hardy lichen still peeps out upon the explorer 
amid the snows of the Arctic regions, as well as upon the summits of the 
highest mountains of the globe.
The period of lichen-growth varies some- 
what in diff'ereut species, but in a general sense, all are of slow growth.
They spread most freely at first ; after that, they will remain for years 
showing little or no change.
Mr. Berkeley watched one foliaceous species 
for twenty-five years, at the end of which period it remained as when he 
first observed it.
Some of the hard crust-forms have undoubtedly adorned 
our mountain rocks for hundreds, if not for thousands of years.
During recent years considerable progress has been made in this branch 
of Botanical Science, not only in the enlargement of our Lichen.
Flora by 
the discovery of new species, but also by the establishment of the system 
of study upon a sounder and more philosophical basis.
In 1851, a Monograph was published by the Rev. W.
A. Leighton of 
Shrewsbury, on the "British Species of Angiocarpus Lichens, Elucidated by 
their Sporidia." Angiocarpus Lichens are those whose fruit are covered or 
enclosed in a perithecium like some ascomycetous fungii That Monograph 
introduced the principle of using the internal structure of the fruit, and 
especially the sporidia, as a reliable characteristic in the distinction of 
species.
The distinguished author had observed the value and use of certain 
forms and markings of some seeds in the study and distinction of flowering 
plants ; and, by a process of analogy, he was led to the conclusion that the 
spores of Lichens possessed some permanent features which would be equally 
valuable in the elucidation of that polj^morphous class.
Systematic investi- 
gation confirmed that conclusion.
Before this application of the spores of 
Lichens was made by Leighton, these germs had long been known to 
Lichenologists ; but, on account of their minuteness, the experienced 
manipulation, and the high magnifying power required to properly observe 
them, the real value of their characteristics had never been realized.
No 
attempt had then been made, either in this country or elsewhere, to apply 
132 
these to the elucidation of genera and species, beyond one or two limited 
exceptions on the Continent.
In a group of plants so large and intricate as the Lichens, it is hardly to 
be expected that we can have a system of classification which will be satis- 
factory to all minds.
Nylander's has its faults to some, in tending too 
much to trivial division and multiplication of species ; but this, to a certain 
extent, is the natural result of observing the sporidia, and the physico- 
chemical character of the plant.
The principles in Nylander's classification 
are the only ones on which a natural arrangement could be built up.
He 
commences with those Lichens which, by their gelatinous nature, are most 
nearly allied to the Algns, and above which they rise in the scale of vege- 
tation ; and closes with those most allied to, and which run into the Fungi.
The whole system, in its leading divisions, rests upon the nature of the 
lichen-thallus, with the modifications and gradations it assumes in develop- 
ment ; combined with a due regard to the reproductive organs, the form of 
the apothecium or fruit, and the shape, divisions, and colour of the spores.
Dr. Nylander further adopts, in a subsidiary way, the use of certain 
chemical reagents which, as confirmatory tests, are of considerable value.
According to Dr. Nylander's system, the Lichens of Great Britain are 
divided into four families, the proportions of which are relatively wide.
The last of the four, that of Lichens proper, is many times larger than the 
other three put together.
The number of species and varieties now recognized 
in the United Kingdom is upwards of 1,720 ; so that this one branch alone 
of our Cryptogamia, far outnumbers all the flowering plants found in our 
Islands.
Within the last nine years, more than five hundred and sixty 
new species and varieties have been added to our Lichen-flora, bringing it 
up, as Mr. Leighton remarks, to an equality in numbers and rarity, with 
that of any other country in Europe.
Now, what is the position of Cumberland in relation to our 
Lichen-flora?
So far as we have been able to ascertain, no 
particular record has hitherto been made.
In the geographical 
list of Leighton's Lichen-Flora of Great Britain^ &>€., a few plants 
are named as having been found in this County : chiefly in the 
neighbourhood of Keswick, by Mrs. Stanger ; and by myself, in 
the locality of Alston Moor.
But those here mentioned give little 
idea of the Lichen-flora which immediately surrounds us.
What- 
ever its productions in the Flowering Plants, there is no doubt 
that Cumberland is favourable to the fostering of a flourishing 
Cryptogamia, and especially of the Lichen-group.
This might be 
inferred from a slight knowledge of its varied physical aspect — its 
13o 
mountain altitudes, its valleys and its woods, its lake margins and 
extensive sea-board, and the varied character of its geological 
out-crops.
Then there is the purity of the atmosphere, with its 
humidity, upon which a flourishing Lichen-flora so much depends.
The results of our Lichen-gatherings and observations, as far as 
they have gone, have been very encouraging.
Though only limited 
yet, in similar localities and altitudes to those we have visited, and 
to the extent of species gathered, they may be taken as fairly 
representative.
These researches have been made chiefly in the 
neighbourhood of Whitehaven, St. Bees, Ennerdale, Egremont, 
Calder Abbey, Gillgarron, Bassenthwaite and Keswick ; with some 
previous research on the east side of the County, and a day's 
excursion now and again to a few other localities.
It must not be 
understood that those places named have been thoroughly searched.
The minute form of many lichens, which may easily be overlooked 
by one person, on a first or second visit to the same place, our 
very brief residence in Cumberland, and the pressure of many 
professional duties, have rendered this impossible.
Good results, 
beyond those we are at present able to record, will reward continued 
research in the districts already named, especially in the locality of 
Keswick and Borrowdale ; and where the aspect of the country, or 
the altitude, differs from those of our record, other forms and 
species may be looked for.
Further, about the neighbourhood of 
the Lakes, and particularly upon those rocks which are rarely 
found above the surface of the earth, some entirely new Lichens 
may be expected.
The subjoined Hst will be found to include several forms that 
are rare, and some others that do not seem to have been hitherto 
recorded as occurring in Great Britain at all ; while two or three 
of the species are new to the European list.
Omitting further 
mention of the numerous gatherings not yet examined, we are able 
to record upwards of three hundred species and varieties.
Of the four Families into which British Lichens are at present 
divided, the first one has only had recorded in it hitherto three 
species ; beside finding one of these up Ennerdale, we have also 
found a fourth species in the same locality.
We have not had the 
134 
opportunity of examining the description of this plant, but we 
submitted it to Dr. Nylander, and he pronounced it to be Siroso- 
phott ocellatus (Dillw) Ktz. It is a small filamentous plant.
The 
filaments are like fine thread, slightly branched, of a brown or dark 
olive colour ; it gi-ows on the face of damp rocks.
The second 
Family, which embraces all the gelatinous Lichens not of a fila- 
mentous kind, is fairly represented in Cumberland.
The third 
Family as yet only consists of one rare species, which has not 
hitherto been found in Scotland or in the North of England.
The 
fourth Family, or Lichens proper, is very large, containing upwards 
of 1600 species and varieties.
The first two families of Lichens 
are a sort of adjustment of the border-land of the group where 
they adjoin and mingle with the Alg^ • while the last family 
contains all the plants which have the typical and distinctive 
features of the Class, and which may be said to occupy a less 
questionable position.
Cumberland, in its production of this large 
family of Lichens, we have reason to believe, will compare favour- 
ably with any other County in Great Britain.
While this record may be accepted as reliable as far as it goes, 
still it can only be regarded as an instalment.
In the Lichenology 
of this County, a fine field is open for enterprising and diligent 
research ; and whenever it is put forth, it will be amply rewarded.
In order that our list may be as useful as possible, in representing 
Lichen-research in Cumberland up to the present time, we shall 
include in it all Lichens known to have been found in the County, 
adding the name of the finder when it is other than ourself.
We 
give also the several localities of the same plant, as far as we know 
them.

NOTE ON THE OCCURRENCE OF THE ICELAND 
FALCON IN EDENSIDE.
By J.
G. GOODCHILD, H.M. Geological Survey.
(Read at the Workington Annual Meeting.) 
Amongst the wild animals still existing in the British Isles, there 
are hardly any that have a greater claim upon the attention of 
naturalists than the Beasts and Birds of Prey.
Gradually, but 
surely, one after another of these is being improved off the face of 
the earth, and the time may not be far distant when many of the 
wild animals that are familiar to the naturalists of the present day, 
may become as extinct as the Great Auk or the Dodo.
Within the memory of people yet living, the Wild Cat, the 
Sweet Mart, the Foumart, and the Badger were still denizens of 
Cumberland and Westmorland : now they have become so rare 
that the occurrence of any one of them is considered worthy of 
being chronicled in the newspapers.
Many old people here can 
yet remember the time when the Golden Eagle, the Arn or Sea 
Eagle, and the Osprey, were regular visitants to these parts, and 
nested year after year in suitable localities around us.
Now-a-days 
they occur here only as chance stragglers at distant intervals of 
time, and when they do occur, they only too often meet with such 
a reception as effectually prevents their return.
Even the once 
familar Kite has left us ; and the Buzzard and the Raven linger 
here and there in sohtary pairs only in the wildest parts of our 
fells.
The spread of cultivation has much to do with this ; but it is to 
160 
the traditional hostility of the gamekeeper, who is only too often 
paid expressly for the destruction of animals that he has been 
taught to regard as vermin, as well as to the greed of the collector, 
that the gradual extermination of our native animals is chiefly due.
Gun, net, snare, trap, and poison are all employed against them 
without mercy ; and the work of extirpation is furthered, in the 
case of birds, by persistent harrying of the nests under one pretext 
or another.* 
Fortunately, a few of our nobler birds yet contrive to escape, 
and there are perhaps four, or it may be, five, places in the two 
counties where we may still boast of the eyrie of that once highly- 
prized companion of all that was knightly and noble, the Peregrine 
Falcon ; and we may perhaps count as many nesting places of 
* In reference to this subject the following letter, which was read at the 
Workington Annual Meeting, may be inserted here with advantage.
Derwent House, Ashton Lane, Sale, 
near Manchester, May 1 6th, 1881.
Dear Sir, — As I am unable to be present at the meeting at Workington, and 
I see you are reading a paper on a kindred subject, I take the liberty of asking 
you (if you take the view I do) to bring before our fellow-members the question 
of the Birds of Prey in the Lake District.
The damage done by the falcons is certainly so small that there is no excuse 
for shooting them down ; and their nests are becoming rarer each year.
The raven also has fared badly lately, as prices that would tempt the shep- 
herds have been offered by middlemen, who send the young birds to London ; 
and in some cases, I am sorry to say, private individuals have paid high prices 
to get every egg and young bird possible.
The consequence is that about the Keswick district we have distinctly fewer 
birds than formerly ; and I fear, unless a stop is put to this useless destruction, 
the Raven and some of our rarer birds will soon be as extinct as the Dodo.
I 
have been making some efforts privately to put a stop to these depredations, 
and if the society used its influence with the owners of land in the district, I feel 
sure the matter might soon be settled in favour of the birds.
If you feel the interest I do in this, and would kindly say a word or two to 
our fellow-members, a great deal might be done in that way, as, after all, the 
influence of private individuals is perhaps the most powerful.
Hoping you may have a successful meeting, believe me, dear sir, yours truly, 
Albert Nicholson.

GOODCHILD, Esq.

the Buzzard* and of the Raven.
It is far from unlikely that 
these eyries may be tenanted by birds coming from a distance, 
who stop short of their native crags in the course of their 
vernal migration, or who may be driven by adverse winds or 
by other causes, out of their ordinary line of migration.
Doubtless we should oftener have the pleasure of entertaining 
many other such noble visitors, were they left to breed unmolested 
when they chance to come this way.
Amongst such chance 
visitors that might possibly stay and breed with us if they were 
left alone, the fine birds known as the Jerfalcons now and then 
find a place.
These birds are natives of the more northern parts 
of the Palsearctic and Nearctic regions ; but they have not hitherto 
been known for certain to breed within the British Isles.
Even as 
occasional visitants they are by no means common, and I have 
not been able to find more than twenty instances of their occurrence 
here recorded.
Of these one only has hitherto been recorded 
from any part of Cumberland and Westmorland.
This was shot 
in the hard winter of 1864, near Crosby Ravensworth, and it is 
now preserved in the Collection at Edenhall.
The object of the present communication is to place the occur- 
rence of another Jerfalcon on record.
The example I refer to was shot at Winton, near Kirkby Stephen, 
by Mr. John Dodd, of Harcla, about the year 1842.
When first 
seen the bird was perched upright on a wall, apparently so intent 
upon the doings of some Magpies and other birds that had the 
temerity to mob it, that it was approached without difficulty and 
shot, and all chance of its remaining with us to breed effectually 
removed.
Up to about fifty years ago ornithologists do not seem to have 
given much attention to the large Northern Falcons.
The Fal- 
coners had, and they prized the birds very highly too, if one may 
judge by the enormous sums of money that were paid for well- 
trained birds of this species.
Practical men, such as the falconers 
' * Since this was written, I have had great pleasure in learning from both 
Dr. Parker of Gosforth, and Dr. Knight of Keswick, that the Buzzard is 
commoner in the more mountainous parts of the Lake District than my own 
observations had led me to suppose.
162 
of old were, were not always very exact in their observations in 
regard to Natural History details— they wanted the birds only for 
hawking purposes, and they were not as much troubled in their 
minds about whether such and such a bird should be referred to 
such and such a species or not, as we are at the present day.
Still, men that had practical acquaintance with many hundreds of 
individual birds, could hardly fail to notice that, out of a large 
number, many would be found to agree in possessing certain 
characteristics that the others had not : they might vary in other 
particulars, but they would agree in these.
So the falcons came 
to be roughly classified, and when they were classified, each of 
these groups possessing these common characteristics received a 
distinct name.
Of course, many of these characteristics were not 
such as we are now-a-days in the habit of considering of import- 
ance.
The male bird, for instance, in some cases received a 
different name from the female, and the immature birds were named 
differently again.
So it came about that when ornithologists first 
took the subject in hand, they placed but little faith in the distinc- 
tions made by the falconers of old, and that when they read that 
the falconers had distinguished three distinct forms of Jerfalcon, 
the distinctions were passed by unheeded.
About fifty years ago, 
Mr. John Hancock, of Newcastle, took the matter up, and, after 
carefully comparing great numbers of specimens, he came to the 
conclusion that the old falconers were, after all, correct in this 
view, and that there were two, if not three, distinct forms, or what 
some would call species, of Jerfalcon.
These views have met with 
a good deal of opposition from that time down to the present day; 
for while there are cabinet zoologists of the first rank that go to 
the length of splitting the Jerfalcons up into five distinct species, 
there are others, equally well qualified to judge, who stoutly 
maintain that these so-called species are nothing more than mere 
varieties, or races, of one and the same species.
Much of the difficulty of coming to a common conclusion in 
this case arises from the difference of opinion in regard to what 
constitutes a characteristic of specific value.
If no such thing as 
a varietal form, or a geographical race, existed, there would be no

difficulty in the matter, as hardly any two birds of the same general 
form and size could differ from each other more than the pure 
white Jerfalcon at the one end of the series does from the dark 
slate-coloured Jerfalcon at the other.
The difference is so great 
that no one examining only the extremes of the series would 
hesitate for a moment to regard them as perfectly distinct species.
But the comparison of great numbers of specimens brings to Hght 
the existence of many varieties of an intermediate character, which 
shade off into each other by almost imperceptible gradations of 
colouring, and seem to complete the connection between the two 
extremes.
They that are unwilling to admit that there is really a passage 
from the one extreme to the other consider that the Jerfalcons 
may be divided into two groups, one that may be characterised as 
the light-coloured birds with dark markings, classified as Falco 
candicans, or the Greenland Falcon ; and the other as the darker- 
coloured set with light markings, which is classified as I<alco 
islandus, or the Iceland Falcon.
The Greenland Falcon, it is 
further said, may be readily distinguished at any age by the barring 
on the tail feathers being incomplete, and by the flank feathers 
being longitudinally striped instead of barred ; while, in the Iceland 
Falcon, the bars on the tail go right across each feather, and the 
flank feathers are invariably more or less barred.
Other minor 
differences have been pointed out ; but these, though readily 
enough detected by a trained eye, are not regarded as character- 
istics of sufficient constancy to have much importance as specific 
distinctions.
A third section of the Jerfalcons is often distinguished as the 
Norway Falcon (Falco gyrfako), or the Jerfalcon proper.* This is 
said to differ from the Iceland Falcon section in being somewhat 
smaller, darker in colour generally, and especially darker on the 
head, and in having the leg-plumes marked with transverse bars 
instead of the longitudinal stripes found in the other.
This race, 
or sub-species, has not yet been recorded from any British locality.

Ann. Mag.

p. io8.
164 
The other two Jeifalcons are the Labrador Jerfalcon and HolboU's 
Jerfalcon, and to these may be added the Saker Falcon.
Some 
day it is Ukely enough that all these forms, including even the 
Saker Falcon, may come to be regarded as mere races of one and 
the same species.
The Jerfalcon that was shot at Crosby Ravensworth is a beautiful 
creamy-white individual, which exhibits all the characteristics of 
the Greenland Falcon race.
It remains for us to decide what 
section the Winton specimen shall be referred to.
The description given below shews that this specimen belongs 
to the dark set with the barred flanks ; it is therefore not what is 
commonly understood by the Greenland Falcon ; while the un- 
usually dark colouring of its plumage, the size of its moustache, 
and the traces of transverse markings on its leg-plumes, would 
seem to warrant us in referring it to the Norwegian Falcon set, 
rather than to the Iceland Falcon proper.
They that believe, as 
I do, that the Norway Falcon is only a geographical race of the 
sub-species Falco islandus, will probably think it best to leave this 
bird under the name given at the head of this notice ; and Falco 
gyrfalco, Forma islandus, is here recorded for the first time from 
any part of Cumberland and Westmorland.
Since this communication was laid before the Cumberland 
Association the skin of the bird has been submitted to Mr. R.
J. 
Howard of Blackburn, and to Mr. John Hancock of Newcastle, 
who have identified it as the Iceland Falcon, while Mr. Hancock 
further states that the specimen is that of a female bird of the first 
year.
They that care to enquire further into this subject for themselves 
should examine the fine collection of Jerfalcons in the Museum at 
Newcastle, which is second in this respect only to the celebrated 
collection of Raptorial Birds in the Museum at Norwich; and 
should read the papers of Mr. Hancock in the Annals and Magazine 
of Nat. Hist.

Salvin and Broderick's Falconry hi the British Isles.
The following description of the Winton specimen may serve, 
with the somewhat rough figure — which is drawn from living 
examples to about one-fourth the natural size — to convey some 
kind of idea of the general aspect of the bird when alive.
The 
skin itself will be deposited in the Museum at Carlisle.
Total length about twenty inches ; wing fifteen-and a-half inches 
from carpal joint to the end of the longest primary ; eleven-and-a- 
half to the end of the longest secondary ; end of tail extending 
about two inches beyond the tips of the wings.
The general dorsal aspect is dark hair-brown, glossed witli 
plum-colour, quite subordinately spotted and edged with cream- 
colour.
The general ventral aspect is striped with cream-colour and dark 
hair-brown in about equal proportions.
The bill is now horn-colour, deeping outwards to very dark 
sage-green.
The cere, orbits, gape, and feet, shew traces of dirty 
greenish yellow, which may, however, be due simply to drying.
The chin is cream-colour without stripes; gorget striped with 
feathers cream-coloured on one half and hair-brown edged with 
cream-colour on the other.
The cream-colour encroaches on the 
darker tint most about the widest part of each feather, so that the 
cream-coloure(J spots cut the dark shade somewhat into the shape 
of a fiddle; and the transverse diameter of the spots becomes 
relatively larger as they extend downwards, so that on the flank 
feathers they appear as ellipsoidal markings extending inwards as 
far as the shaft of the feather.
The flank feathers thus appear to 
be marked with more or less distinctly transverse bars.
The tarsi are feathered rather more than half-way down ; and 
the leg-plumes, which are long enough to extend to the sole of the 
powerful foot, are marked in much the same way as the flanks ; 
that is to say, they exhibit traces of transverse bars as well as of 
longitudinal stripes.
The under tail-coverts are cream-colour with 
dark centre-lines, which widen out somewhat near the extremity of 
each feather.
166 
The dorsal aspect may be thus described : Crown oi the head 
dark hair-brown, with somewhat Hghter edges and darker shafts to 
each feather.
Moustache black.
Over the eyes there is an 
indication of a lighter stripe, and the ear-coverts and the nape are 
lighter coloured than the parts around.
A dark band can be traced 
from the hinder-angle of the orbits backward to below the lighter 
part of the nape.
Neck feathers narrowly edged with cream-colour.
Mantle and upper part of the scapularies dark hair brown with 
black shafts.
Lower part of scapularies dark hair-brown, each 
feather being diversified with transverse rows of cream-coloured 
spots, which increase in number and tend more and more to 
become confluent, especially at the outer half of each feather, as 
they extend backwards from the head.
These rows of spots range 
about half an inch apart, and they therefore increase in number 
with the length of each feather up to a maximum of six rows ; but 
the cream-colour is quite subordinate to the darker tint.
Wing 
coverts, tertiaries, secondaries, and bastard wing, dark hair-brown, 
diversified with cream-coloured spots and edges in much the same 
way, and exhibiting a decided tendency to assume a banded 
pattern.
Primaries dark hair-brown, paler towards the margin, 
and flecked with small cream-coloured spots.
On the inner webs 
the cream-colour occupies the whole of the inner margin and 
extends thence inward towards the shaft in gradually narrowing 
bands, which interdigitate with the spurs of the darker shade.
The hair-brown tint predominates also on the lower part of the 
back, and on the upper tail-coverts, and also on the tail, which is 
subordinately spotted, barred, and edged with cream-colour of the 
same shade as prevails on other parts of the body.

NOTES ON THE PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY OF 
NORTH-WEST CUMBERLAND.
By T.
V. HOLMES, F.G.S.
(Read at the Workington Annml Meeting.) 
Ai^i.
residents in that part of Cumberland which borders the Sohvay 
know how smalUs the area in which soHd rock is visible at or near 
the surface compared with that occupied by stony clay, gravel 
loam, or peat.
This is especially the case with the district lyin<^ 
on the north-west side of the Maryport and Carlisle Railway and 
south-east of the Eden, over the greater part of which no traces of 
the underlymg rocks appear.
Yet the visitor to Aspatria and West 
Newton, Shawk Beck, Wetheral, the rivers Lyne and Esk at Kirk 
Imton and Netherby, and other localities that might be mentioned 
will find that beneath these superficial beds are thick sandstones 
and other rocks, the arrangement of which bears no relation to that 
of the overlying formations.
It is not, however, of these lower or 
m geological language, Carboniferous, Permian, Triassic, and Liassic 
rocks, that I have anything to say here, as their influence on the 
shape of the ground near the Solway is mainly of a remote and 
general kind, the various ridges and other surface features being 
usually due entirely to the superficial beds.
As we recede from 
the Solway the underlying rocks occupy a larger and larger pro- 
portion of the surface, and their influence on the shape of the 
ground becomes more manifest.
The diagramatic section will 
explam better than many words could do the relations of the 
underlying and overlying beds to each other, and the general 
168 
nature of the change that occurs on traversing the country from 
Silloth, Bowness, or Burgh-by-Sands to the fells about Caldbeck 
or Ireby.
The superficial beds consist of glacial drift, river-gravel, alluvium, 
and peat.
There is, in addition, a strip of raised beach along the 
shore west of Bowness.* Of these beds the stony clays, gravels, 
and sands, which make up the higher or undulating ground, are the 
oldest, thickest, and most important.
They form collectively what 
is known as the glacial drift, and underlie the peat-mosses, alluvium, 
and raised beach.
The glacial drift is known near Abbey Town 
to reach a thickness of nearly 200 feet ; and though this thickness is 
probably exceptional, railway cuttings near Carlisle and elsewhere 
often show drift to the thickness of thirty feet or more without 
any sign of hard rock being visible.
Well-sinkers cannot give so 
much information on this head as could be wished, as in consequence 
of occasionally losing water altogether from penetrating through 
the drift to a porous sandstone below, they are careful not to go a 
foot deeper than is absolutely necessary.
The boundary of the district now under consideration may be 
roughly stated to be a line from Maryport to Rose Castle or there- 
abouts, and thence by Wetheral and Brampton to Hethersgill and 
the Scottish Border about Riddings Junction.
Within this line the 
only spot where there is any appreciable area of ground uncovered 
by drift or other superficial beds is between Aspatria and West 
Newton.
There about a square mile of country shows sandstone 
at or close to the surface.
Elsewhere the lower rocks are seldom 
visible except here and there in the banks of the various streams.
The ground varies in height from about 1 5 to 400 feet above the 
sea.
The great alluvial fiats close to the Solway vary from about 
1 5 to 30 feet, and heights of 300 to 400 feet are only seen on the 
outer margin of the district, most of which is below 200 feet.
Careful examination of the undulating ground shows it to be 
made up mainly of what may be called by the general name of 
" earthy gravel." Sometimes it may seem more clayey, sometimes 
more sandy than usual, but the stones it contains are usually more 
* Described in Trans.
Cumb.
Assoc., Part II.
169 
or less rounded, and the soil it makes light or lightish rather than 
heavy.
The stiff clay known as Till, in which angular or sub-angular 
stones of various kinds are confusedly heaped together, is seldom 
visible in this district, though not uncommon at higher levels.
The 
ridges formed by the earthy gravel are gentle and regular in out- 
line, and often run strictly parallel to each other for a considerable 
distance; the direction of these ridges, in the country about Wigton 
and Aspatria, being a little north of east and south of west.
In other 
places it may happen that the contours are flatter, or that no per- 
ceptible order is manifest.
The influence of the underlying rock 
on a drift-covered surface is best seen between Aikton and 
Great Orton.
Anyone who stands at Wiggonby and looks alter- 
nately north and south, cannot fail to notice the contrast between 
the rolling drift edges southward and the flat plateau-like appearance 
of the country in the opposite direction.
This plateau-like aspect 
is due to the influence of the underlying outlier of Lias, which 
makes itself felt through a thinner covering than usual of drift ; 
while the rolling ridges owe nothing of their shape to the older 
rocks below.
But, rising above the earthy gravel, certain mounds and ridges 
of clean, sandy, gravel occasionally appear, which, though they 
occupy comparatively little ground, are often very conspicuous 
where they do occur.
This arises from the contrast of their 
irregularity and the steepness of their sides with the low regular 
undulations of the earthly gravel.
They are known as Eskers, and 
abound on both sides of the Sohvay; in Dumfriesshire about 
Cummertrees and north of Dumfries ; in Cumberland around 
Brampton, and midway between Abbey Town and Allonby.
The 
finest are those about Brampton, though either district is worth 
visiting.
On leaving Carlisle by the Newcastle and Carlisle 
Railway the journey as far as Heads Nook is on the earthy gravel.
Between Heads Nook and How Mill the esker tract is entered, 
and the contrast between the two formations becomes very obvious.
Instead of low regular undulations, a series of steep irregular ridges, 
diversified by isolated mounds and peaty hollows, is seen on both 
170 
sides.
The well-known Cowran Cut, which reaches a depth at one 
point of no feet, is through a part of this esker tract.
Besides the two compact areas of esker country I have mentioned, 
isolated esker mounds and ridges may be seen at various places.
Many are scattered about between Brampton and Kirklinton ; in 
the neighbourhood of Crofton Hall, and elsewhere.
The beautifully 
wooded conical hill, called Torkin, on the north side of Crofton 
Park, is a good example of an esker mound, Esker mounds are 
often so extremely like artificial barrows as to be a very possible 
source of disappointment to an antiquary.
A long, low, winding 
esker ridge crosses the Carhsle and Dalston road a few yards south- 
west of Dalston Hall.
On this ridge, both east and west of the 
road, the word "Tumulus" appears on the (6in.} Ordnance Map.
I am informed by Mr. R.
S. Ferguson of Carlisle that these tumuli 
have not yet been opened.
It may well be that these natural 
tumuli have been used as burying places ; but, on the other hand, 
irregularities very much more striking often occur in the course of 
a perfectly natural ridge.
Such is the case of Torkin, which is a 
sudden expansion both in height and breadth in the course of a 
ridge little, if at all, more prominent elsewhere than that at Dalston 
Hall.
What has been said of the characteristics of the Brampton esker 
tract holds good of that between Abbey Town and Allonby.
There also are steep- sided ridges and mounds, with peaty hollows.
In this last named quarter, however, there is less boldness of 
outline, and the eskers, though forming the highest ground in the 
district, do not attain a height of more than one hundred and 
fifty -six feet, while east of Brampton they may be seen to a height 
of seven hundred feet or more.
Though eskers are by no means 
evenly distributed, but are very common in some localities and 
almost or entirely absent from others, it cannot be said that they 
show any preference for any particular level.
Indeed the raised 
beach and certain gravel mounds on the great flat between Abbey 
Town and Silloth, may be considered as the lowest, while south of 
Caldbeck they reach, and even cross, the eight hundred feet 
171 
contour line, I may add that I believe they mark the extent of 
the submergence of the country at the close of the glacial period, 
and were probably formed during the emergence.
The peat-mosses in some respects form a connecting link between 
the higher, or undulating, ground and the lower, or estuarine and 
river terraces and flats, both on account of 'their occurrence at 
various levels, and the low dome shape they assume.
This dome 
shape is best seen at Scaleby Moss, but is very obvious at Solway 
and other large mosses.
Among the peat-mosses on levels higher 
than those of the great flats may be mentioned Bolton Fell, near 
Hethersgill, Scaleby, Solway, and Oulton Mosses.
These all lie 
in hollows on the earthy gravel.
Those on a lower level, such as 
Wedholme Flow, Drumburgh Moss, those between Abbey Town 
and Allonby, and that which under various names lies between 
Glasson and Cardurnock, appear to rise directly from the loamy 
flats around them, and to be simply peat-covered portions of those 
flats.
With regard to these low-lying mosses, the evidence seems to me 
to point towards their greater extension formerly.
For some distance 
outside the area which can fairly be mapped as peat, the surface 
of the loamy flats is covered more or less by peaty soil, and it is, 
as will shortly be seen, probable that the present separation of 
Eowness and Drumburgh Mosses from Wedholme Flow is due to 
the denuding influence of the Wampool.
The mosses north and 
north-east of Allonby — Salta and Brunshaw Mosses, with those 
drained by Holme Dub and Black Dub— have also suffered much 
from denudation.
This is shown by the amount of peaty soil still 
remaining on the border of the great loamy flat towards Pelutho 
and Highlaws, and on that drained by Holme Dub about Brom- 
field and Kelsick.
Midway between Solway Moss and the Esk due south of it, is 
a small compact mass of peat, while to the north of this mass is a 
considerable area showing more or less peaty soil.
The Caledonian 
Railway runs across the western edge of the peat.
This is, I 
suppose, the only remnant of the great overflow of Solway Moss 
in 1 77 1, which covered five hundred acres of the broad alluvial 
172 
flat north of the Esk. Most of the peat was removed shortly after 
the irruption, partly by fire, but chiefly by water.
The Rev.
William Gilpin, Vicar of Boldre, a writer well known in his time 
for his works on the Picturesque, visited the spot shortly after the 
catastrophe, and has left a graphic account of it, and of the means 
taken to remove the peat from the alluvial plain.
Comparatively 
little could be removed by fire, but an ingenious plan, invented 
by a man named Wilson, for employing the carrying power of 
running water was very effective.
From the reservoirs formed by 
a little stream at the highest part of the over-flowed ground, he 
cut channels in various directions to the Esk, and when the water 
was let off, he placed numbers of men by the stream, who rolled 
into it large masses of peat which had been hardened by the sun.
The stream tumbled them into the river, and the river conveyed 
them to the sea.
Many small peaty or alluvial flats mark the spots once occupied 
by lakelets in slight hollows of the earthy gravel.
They are 
especially common in the neighbourhood of Rockcliff and Great 
Orton.
The turnpike road between Carlisle and Gretna crosses 
many of them.
The network of what must have been till lately 
simply morasses, which occupies so much of the ground directly 
north of Carlisle, must have been a great additional protection to 
the Border City in mosstrooping times.
In Thurstonfield and 
Monkhill Loughs are preserved two undrained examples of the 
lakelets.
We now come to the broad river and estuarine flats.
Terraces 
of river gravel elevated more or less above the present alluvium 
are well shown on the Esk about Netherby ; the Lyne above Cliff 
Bridge, Kirklinton ; and the Eden about Low Crosby.
Many of 
the streets of Carlisle, at the Botchergate end, are on a terrace of 
river gravel.
Union-street, with its continuation to the Water- 
works, is an example.
Of course these terraces record the fact 
that the rivers which deposited them once flowed at a higher level 
than they now do.
The precise changes that have taken place in 
the channels of the Carlisle rivers cannot be ascertained ; but it is 
probable that the Petteril, or the Petteril and Eden united, once 
173 
joined the Caldew south of Carlisle instead of north, as at present.
As regards the Caldew, there probably occurred a much more 
fundamental change of channel, at a time when Pow Beck must 
have represented it between the localities now known as Dalston 
and Carlisle.
The church and most of the village of Dalston 
stand on a terrace of river gravel, the bank bounding which rises 
five or six feet above the present alluvium of the Caldew.
The 
gravel forming this terrace may be seen in the pit on the north side 
of Dalston railway station.
If we walk along the gravel flat in a 
westerly direction, we find it undrained by any stream east of Gill 
Beck, which enters it about three-quarters of a mile west of the 
bank bounding the terrace at Dalston.
Gill Beck, however, flows 
westward, and is one of the streams which make up the Wampool, 
which flows past Kirkbride into Moricambe Bay. The gravel 
terrace is therefore at Dalston the only water-parting between the 
basins of the Caldew and Wampool, though the flat between Gill 
Beck and the bank at Dalston seems perfectly continuous with 
that through which Gill Beck flows.
It is therefore almost certain 
that at one time the Caldew flowed westward at (what is now) 
Dalston, in the course now taken by the Wampool.
Again, north 
of Wigton, the road to Oulton crosses a strearaless alluvial flat, 
which is continuous with that of the Wampool on the east, and of 
the Waver on the west.
A little eastward of the road the Wiza 
flows to the Wampool, while, a little westward, a stream from 
Oulton flows towards the Waven It is therefore probable that the 
Wampool may once have taken its course south of Wedholme 
Flow and joined the Waver there, its valley between Parton and 
Kirkbride being occupied by what now are but its tributaries.
While, further westward still, the Waver once ran along the peaty 
flat now drained by Holme Dub and Black Dub and entered the 
sea at Allonby.
But if the Wampool once ran south of Wedholme Flow, that 
moss may then have been parted from those of Bowness and 
Drumburgh by but the breadth of a stream such as Holme Dub.
The separation of the great Bowness moss from that of Drumburgh 
probably occurred when the Wampool, instead of turning westward 
174 
at Kirkbride, flowed in a north-easterly direction either to the 
north or south of Drumburgh.
Lastly, two small, low-lying peat- 
mosses, one about half a mile north of Kirkbampton, the other 
about midway between Kirkbampton and Fingland, may point to 
a former extension of Drumburgh Moss in that direction.
