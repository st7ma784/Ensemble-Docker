SIR JAMES EDWARD SMITH.
CHAPTER VII.
Correspondence of Edmund Davall, Esq., — Sir James Edward 
Smith, — and the Marchioness of Rockingham; — and two Letters 
from Professor Afzelius.
JL HE late Mr. Davall, of Orbe, was one whose 
fondness for natural science led him to cultivate 
an acquaintance with the subject of these pages, 
which soon settled into a warm personal affection 
on either side, and remained unimpaired through 
their lives.
An Englishman by birth, he was destined by cir- 
cumstances to reside in Switzerland : but although 
he lived in a beautiful country, surrounded by ob- 
jects most pleasing to him, yet he seems to suffer 
the pangs of an exile whenever he writes to his 
friend.
The yearnings of desire to be among those 
who assimilate in pursuits, in intellectual and moral 
taste, cannot be more forcibly expressed than in the 
/'\OL.
II.
B 
observation, — that even the grand scenes of nature, 
most precious in the estimation of pure and enthu- 
siastic minds, — even these grow flat, stale and unpro- 
fitable, without the presence of a congenial friend 
to share in the enjoyments which they impart.
A sensibility which became morbid, affected his 
tender spirits; and he experienced towards England 
the true maladie du pays which the inhabitants of 
his adopted country feel when long absent from 
their native soil.
Mr. Davall had projected, and indeed made some 
progress in, a work on the plants of Switzerland, 
which he never completed.
Ill-health, and a too 
anxious care for its being faultless, retarded, and 
finally stopped the publication of his accurate and 
ingenious labours.
A love of botany was the ruling passion of his 
mind, and was indeed but an effect of the adoration 
he paid to the beauty of creation in all its forms.
Actuated by a pure love of nature, he was free from 
the restless passions of ambition or fame: — but the 
passions of others too often troubled his repose ; 
and when he discovered the degrading traits of sus- 
picion and reserve, where he reposed confidence, his 
ingenuous spirit was vexed and grieved more than 
it ought to have been, and he was led to charge 
himself with misanthropy, when all he felt was 
wounded love.
A little sketch of his history, which he had writ- 
ten to his friend sometime about the year 1795, will 
at once exhibit the sensitive disposition of this ex- 
cellent man.
" Orbe, Canton de Berne, en Suisse.
" I never yet remained so long without writing to 
you, my dearest and best friend : you will not be 
surprised at this, when I shall have explained the 
cause of my silence.
My health has been very 
unsettled, as it too generally is.
— You know how 
ardent is my love of plants.
Among the various 
contrarieties I have been obliged to bear, the want 
of sufficient room for my books and herbarium, &c.
drove me from a very small study which I formerly 
occupied, and to which I was confined, because a 
contiguous room, which would have suited me, was 
appropriated to a much more important use, — the 
admittance of some card parties, when another room 
more usually frequented could not suffice.
I was 
therefore obliged, during the latter part of the reign 
of these accursed cards, to take refuge in a less 
limited room on the ground-floor.
— Not to be too 
prolix, and to come to the point, I discovered last 
summer, that in this position, from a certain degree 
of damp, though not very great, my herbarium has 
been in a great measure spoilt ; a great number of 
specimens are become mouldy, and among these 
some of the most precious.
" You will pardon me, surely, if I unload in some 
degree my heart, by opening myself somewhat 
further to you, who give me such kind proofs of 
your friendship.
"It was just at the epoch of the death of my father 
that I began to have some vague notion of botany; 
that I perceived it was possible to acquire some 
knowledge of that enchanting study, by means of 
b 2 
solitary application.
I had from my cradle a latent 
germen, which unfortunately, — not having had the 
happiness of reckoning; among my early acquaint- 
ance any one properly given to natural history, — had 
waited for direction till that moment.
Having al- 
ways been fond of gardening, I had bought Miller's 
Calendar, and it was there I first saw a sketch of the 
Linnaean system.
I was suddenly inspired ; and at 
this critical period resolved to pursue a study which 
I was certain would be productive of better happi- 
ness than any plan that might lead to pecuniary ad- 
vantage.
"With my father I lost my home in my native 
country ; for my mother, after this separation, was 
earnestly desirous of finishing her days in the land 
which gave her birth.
Thus I became from the na- 
ture of my circumstances exiled as it were to this 
country.
" On my return here from my last visit to England, 
— which is surely the most memorable and the hap- 
piest period of my whole life, as it procured me not 
only your acquaintance but also your inestimable 
friendship, which I prefer to every other blessing- 
that Providence could grant me, — my ardour became 
greater than ever; and for that very reason the per- 
petual card parties in the house I inhabit, the never- 
ending histories of Spadille and Manille of my good 
old aunts, became more irksome to me than before.
I discontinued totally their socidtds, which I found 
quite intolerable ; and the more so, as almost with- 
out a single exception the society of this little place 
is composed of that too numerous herd, who are 
constantly desirous of killing time they know not 
how to employ !
and who express their esteem for 
persons of a studious disposition by — a shrug.
"Thus recluse, and little thinking how soon every 
one of these good women would be obliged to lay 
aside her cards (the last died literally with cards in 
her hands), I too often felt the want of a present 
friend.
" Having mentioned these several matters, which I 
could not resist communicating to you, I shall for- 
get them for a while to turn to other subjects ; for 
I have two letters from you !
! — unanswered !
and 
moreover I must talk a little botany, to convince 
you that no circumstances whatever can divert me 
totally from that delightful source of happiness, to 
which I shall have recourse till my last breath.
"I have something to tell you which will give you 
pleasure, affording a new proof how much certain 
good discoveries in botany are casual, and the effect 
of some happy moment.
"I went one day in August to my mountain Suchet.
In going up the fir woods at the side, I learnt by the 
waving of the trees and the uncommon murmur, 
where I am accustomed to delightful "horror ac si- 
lentium\ that a strong wind had arisen.
When I got 
to the ridge with the intention of gaining the sum- 
mit, I found the gale so strong, full against me from 
the N.E., that after tying my handkerchief over my 
hat and under my chin, every effort to get on was 
useless ; when a leg was lifted, I was almost blown 
back ; — you know by experience what is the power 
of wind in such positions : I therefore declined it, 
The mountain to the N.W. is very abrupt; yet wish- 
ing to get to a somewhat less boisterous situation, 
I looked out for the first break in the rocks where 
it might be at all practicable to get down ; and this 
I "executed, not indeed without some difficulty ; 
though I had still more to make myself followed 
by a boy, who carried my large vasculum, " parce- 
quil riy avoit point de sentier, et quit iiavoit pas 
envie de casser le cou." Here I proceeded slowly, 
sometimes getting down a steep narrow pass, se- 
curing my progress by laying hold of branches of 
CratagusChamcemespilus!
sometimes finding a nar- 
row green place over the rocks, hence sliding myself 
down a crevice just sufficient to receive the body, 
to get at another shelf, &c.
In one of the crevices, 
for the first time in the Jura I had the happiness of 
seeing Cyathea montana, in small quantity and so 
much advanced that I brought home but one spe- 
cimen ; as the only one I had left was very poor, 
having given my best to Dickson on my arrival in 
England, and one, not very good, to you.
So now I 
have it in my reach, and, please God, you shall be 
properly supplied with characteristic specimens as 
soon as I can.
It seems so rare, that I keep it to 
myself, and shall not mention it till we are supplied.
In the name of Heaven reflect seriously, my dear- 
est friend, that this mountain is so well within my 
reach!
that I go quietly and easily to the summit, up 
one side and down the other, and get home by 7 or 
8 p.m. Think you have a home, a good stock of 
books, &c.
within its reach, and tell me whether this 
cannot once tempt you?
— You might work at least 
at English Botany, and make many notes useful 
even for you here as in Marlborough-street.
More- 
over, by sleeping out one night I would make you 
mow Saooifraga Hir cuius, gather Car ex leporina, 
Linn., &c.
When I think how possible, how easy 
the execution of all this might be, I am almost out 
of my senses for joy on thinking, hoping the time 
will come, — as much dejected with the fear of my 
passing to another world, before you can contrive 
to come here.
ii O?
, chis abortiva and coriophora are within a mo- 
derate walk of my house!
! But I have also the Alps 
daily before my eyes, and I know what might be 
done there.
I wait for you, and then !
! !
— I will re- 
turn.
Had I but the certainty of seeing this part of 
my plan realized, I should bear with patience the 
circumstances which render impossible a visit to my 
native land." 
It was to Mr. Davall that Sir James was indebted 
for an introduction to the Marchioness of Rock- 
ingham, who continued her friendly attentions and 
correspondence till her death in 1804.
At her re- 
sidence at Hillingdon he enjoyed many delightful 
visits, and heard many anecdotes of her illustrious 
husband.
The memory of this great statesman was che- 
rished by her with a fondness that delighted in 
speaking of him to those she esteemed, and in con- 
necting some reminiscence of him with every pur- 
suit of her life.
The following letter from her, though a little 
8 
anticipated, as its date will show, shall be inserted 
first.
It was written only two years before her 
death; but the share the noble Marquis has in it 
will excuse its being out of place.
The Marchioness of Rockingham to «/.
E. Smith.
Hillingdon House, May 21, 1802.
What shall I say to my good friend Dr. Smith, 
who is always showing me attentions which I am 
very unworthy of?
But it is only seeming; for I am 
in reality always much pleased and gratified by the 
remembrance of those I esteem, though my unto- 
ward health will not often allow me to express it ; 
and I am so little conscious of any neglect of the 
mind, that without hesitation I will beg that, when 
you come again to London, you will steal a day fronr 
your business to let me see you at this place ; for it is 
a long time since I had that satisfaction.
I had mis- 
laid your letter, and have been hunting in my draw- 
ers all day ; I have at last found it, and inexpressi- 
bly ashamed I am to see the date; and not only so, 
but to see that that very letter of November is com- 
plaining of my silence.
I can only repeat the same, 
— that my conscience stands clear of ever forgetting 
a friend, or intentionally neglecting one : but I am 
free to acknowledge that I may give w T ay too much 
to those incapacities that so frequently come upon 
me, even in the slender exertion of writing a letter.
Poor Mr. Spragg would have said, Oh !
a nervous 
affection; but my correspondents (I think) have 
greater reason to say, a nervous disaffection.
— But 
what is to be said now !
for thus far I had wrote, 
before this day brought me another very pleasing 
mild letter from Dr. Smith, who might justly reprove 
me sharply: — but I will still trust my cause to him- 
self, who knows how journaliere my health has long 
been.
You had congratulated me upon the blessing 
of peace ; and I thought when I received your first 
letter, how soon I would answer it in the same sen- 
timent, and say a great deal, the loss of which you 
have no cause to lament.
I believe nobody's mind 
composes more epistles than mine, for it is always 
full of thouohts that I wish to utter to my particu- 
lar friends ; but they generally have the good luck 
to escape them.
As you are coming to London, 
might I hope that you will let me see you before 
you leave it again?
I do not know in what manner you celebrate your 
Linnaean anniversary ; nor did I know the day of 
the month till your letter mentioned it.
How much 
it would gratify me, if a certain name could be with- 
out impropriety mentioned at that meeting !
He 
might truly be called a rising botanist of great pro- 
mise; for his mind had the happiness of taking a 
most comprehensive view of a subject at one glance, 
which seemed to require ages of investigation.
He 
was a most attached disciple of Linnaeus : his col- 
lection of plants and books was valuable and ele- 
gant, as far as it had gone; and the 24/A of May was 
his birthday.
I do think that my friend Dr. Smith 
and (perhaps) Sir Joseph Banks would find a mo- 
ment at their feast to drink a small bumper to the 
10 
memory of this true brother in their science ; as 
great a friend and encourager of science, and him- 
self as near perfection in every line of life and cha- 
racter as human nature ever admitted of.
You will excuse this sally of zeal upon my ob-^ 
serving that the 24lh of May happened to be your 
anniversary, and will not treat it with any attention 
that may be inconvenient.
It was an impulse of the 
heart that I could not restrain.
My dear Sir, I have many thanks to offer (too 
long postponed) for your kind present of excellent 
dried fruit and biscuits ; the latter are, I perceive, 
recovering their peculiar taste and good quality — 
which I will now venture to say were quite gone.
Those cruel times of real or pretended scarcity 
ruined every sort of eatables where flour was con- 
cerned ; neither do I think that bread or any other 
flour compositions have yet been in, nor perhaps 
ever will return to, the same perfection as before.
The sermon you were so good as to send me is 
excellent ; it must (as it were) have compelled a 
large collection; — in its address to the congrega- 
tion # , I think it puts me in mind of something in 
Saurin.
I venture to pay in your own coin, by 
sending you a sermon preached before many digni- 
taries of the Church at a visitation, by a great friend 
of mine, whom you have seen at Hillingdon, upon 
* A Sermon preached at the Octagon Chapel, Norwich, August 
30, 1801, for the Benefit of the Norfolk and Norwich Hospital, 
by the Rev. Pendlebury Houghton, — from the text : " I was sick, 
and ye visited me." Matth.

a subject I think I may call the parent of yours, as 
piety and sound doctrine must of course produce 
charity and benevolence.
I have insensibly wrote two sheets of paper in- 
stead of one, and neither of them is very legible; 
for my poor eyes are far from recovered of that 
uneasy complaint in the lids: — reading or writing 
always occasions an unpleasant sensation to the 
eyes and across the forehead.
Dear Sir, 
Your very sincere and obliged humble Servant, 
M. Rockingham.
This letter and the preceding passage from one 
of Mr. Davall's later epistles will serve as introduc- 
tions to the following correspondence, beginning 
sixteen years earlier than that of the Marchioness's 
here inserted.
The Marchioness of Rockingham to J.
E. Smith.
Hillingdon House, Dec. 10, 1788.
The Portiandia flowers that I had the pleasure of 
sending to Dr. Smith yesterday were, I hope, mode- 
rately worthy of a place in an herbarium ; but the 
first was so little so, that I was quite unwilling to 
send it.
The evening coach yesterday brought me 
your packet, and I am quite at a loss how to express 
my thankfulness for the extreme obliging attention 
you have paid to my botanical library, in comple- 
ting the works of Linnaeus by so scarce a volume, 
which I should have despaired of obtaining; but I 
12 
am ashamed that you should have taken the trouble 
of imitating the binding of my books.
One out of 
the actual Linnaean library, though ever so old and 
musty, would have been sufficiently valuable ; and 
it is greatly enhanced by your politeness in sparing 
it me.
If any thing should happen to the remaining 
duplicate, I must beg that you will without scruple 
recall it back to its place.
I am much obliged to 
you for the ingenious little tract you have favoured 
me with, and for the melon seeds.
I shall be very 
happy to receive the little plant, whenever it is pro- 
per to be sent ; and if you have any green-house or 
stove where any of mine would be acceptable, they 
will be extremely at your service.
My coming to town is always very precarious ; 
but if I should come within a week or ten days, I 
shall be very glad to see your valuable collections, 
though with the most ignorant eye they ever were 
viewed with.
I beg you will give my sincere compliments to 
Mr. Davall, and assure him I am much concerned 
to find he has lost a valuable beloved parent ; he 
does not mention how soon he shall be obliged to 
leave England.
I shall be very glad if I have the 
opportunity of offering him my good wishes before 
his departure.
I am, Sir, 
Your very obliged humble Servant, 
M. Rockingham.

* Mr. D avail to J.
E. Smith.
Orbe, May 5, 1789: 
My dear Sir, Canton de Berne en Suisse.
For a considerable time past I had formed the 
project of sitting- down to write to you.
A journey 
to Berne, another to Lausanne, the illness and death 
of one of my aunts with its consequent employ- 
ments, together with the care of my garden, had 
occasioned me to defer writing till I was most 
agreeably awakened by your kind letter.
If I may conclude from the inexpressible satisfac- 
tion and delight I experience at the sight of a letter 
from you, — from the portion of my thoughts which 
you occupy, from the anxiety concerning your 
health, — you are of all other beings the one who 
interests me most ; and were botany quite out of 
the question, I think I could say as much from the 
high esteem your conversation and character have 
created in me.
While I think of it, let me tell you, that of late 
we have had flights of Ampelis garrulus; and that 
the other day a friend sent me the Oriolus Galbula, 
shot among twelve or fifteen.
I examined an insect 
yesterday, which I make Hister quadrimaculatus .
Is this rare ?
— I have a specimen, at this moment 
in press for you, of Ribes alpinum, &c.
&c.
One of the most lovely plants of this country is 
coming into flower in my little garden, the Astra- 
galus monspessulanus .
N.B. I have seen an old book in German, the 
title "Feuillee, Description of the Medicinal Plants

Sowerby is an admirable man, as he unites great 
excellence in engraving to considerable botanical 
intelligence.
The Collector of the Convent of the Great St.
Bernard dined with us not long since, when I pro- 
mised to go and see him in July, chiefly (on my 
honour) for you, my good friend, in hopes of your

a small bit of which I think is 
in my Reynier's herbarium as une varUte developpde

May Heaven preserve you for those who love and 
respect you, and for the improvement of botany !
Your devoted Friend, 
E. Davall.

E. Smith to Mr. Davall.
My dear Sir, London, July 2, 1789.
I have so much to thank you for, and so many 
things to say to you, that I know not where to 
begin.
— First, above all accept my thanks for your 
very friendly expressions, and be assured, as our 
excellent friend Dr. Goodenough says, " that there 
is no love lost between us." Now indeed I feel the 
value of botany, when it procures me such friends !
Now for your letter of May 5th.
Hister quadrima- 
culatus is excessively rare indeed ; I have it, but 
pray take all you can.

I am not quite sure that it is the

What vile cards they 
are!

He sets out for Milan

I go to Matlock this summer.

J. E.
Smith.
The Marchioness of Rockingham to J.
E. Smith.
Hillingdon, Sept.
19, 1789.
I was in hopes that Dr. Smith would have reached 
Wentworth before the great bustle of preparation 
began, that he might have had a quiet view of that 
charming place, and the many things worthy of in- 
spection there ; instead of which, I perceived from 
your letter that your arrival was in the midst of 
16 
getting every thing in order for the Royal Guest, 
and that your politeness hurried you so (juiek away, 
that you seemed not to have even thought of the 
plants, — which was a pity, for your road to Wake- 
field being under the terrace wall, at the end of 
which are the conservatory and green-houses, you 
might have stepped in there without being in the 
way at all (though perhaps Henderson the gardener 
might be in a bustle like all the rest).
I regret it 
the more, because I should so much have liked your 
account of the plants, which were all duplicates of 
the collection at Wimbledon (which I have here) ; 
and the finest plants were always sent to Went- 
worth : how T ever, I hope whenever you pass that 
road again you will call and see all.
Without disfiguring the Aralia I could not send 
a specimen fine enough for a drawing ; therefore I 
have had Sow T erby here, and have also set him to 
make a drawing of a size he never did before, which 
is both extravagant and perhaps ridiculous ; but 
really the plant has flowered in such magnitude, 
and is so very beautiful an object, that I could not 
resist having it done the size of life.
I send you in 
the box one of the eight flowers, which are all at this 
moment in full perfection, two rising rather higher 
at the top, and the other six round them in the form 
of an umbrella.
It is w r hat hitherto has been called 
the Pancratium amboinensis, but I never had one 
flower before in this immense dimension (though 
very fine); the fragrance of it is prodigious, exactly 
like the Cactus grandiflor a.
The circumference of 
the umbrella which the Pancratium makes is a yard 
17 
and three quarters ; and the bulb twelve inches and 
a half.
The leaves are not yet full out*.
My Portlandia and Catesbcea have been flowering 
a second time.
Mr. Dryander plucked off the first 
flower upon the Martinea, which I perceive is likely 
to get a new name.
I am sorry there is not an- 
other to send to you now, but there will be plenty 
by your return.
I am, &c.
M. Rockingham.

E. Smith.
Orbe, Oct. 27, 1789.
I must begin as you have done, my best and 
dearest friend : — I have so much to thank you for, 
and so many things to say to you, that I know not 
where to begin.
Your friendly and most interest- 
ing letter of July the 2nd, which accompanied the 
parcel, by Mandrot's strange management did not 
arrive here till Friday evening, 23rd of October.
He 
had brought me the fruits you were so kind as to 
send for Wyttenbach, the diplomas, &c, but had 
sent the more interesting packet the roundabout 
road with his merchandise.
I delivered Van Ber- 
chem's diploma to him as I passed, at his house, 
on my way to the Great St. Bernard.
This person 
gave me a complete farce on the occasion, which 
would occupy too much space in this sheet : 
thanked me, as the occasion of his being received !
and, such is the ridiculous vanity of the people of 
* e Probably a variety of P.
cctribbceum.

this Pays de Vaud, the father having apparently mis- 
conceived the account I e^ave him of the Institution, 
boasted at dinner, in presence of fourteen persons, 
that there were only four honorary members, and 
that his son had been chosen as one!
They suffered 
no little avanie when I corrected the mistake, ob- 
serving at the same time, that distinguished know- 
ledge and rank united were essentially requisite.
I can hardly follow any method in the multipli- 
city of things I have to say to you.
I sincerely 
thank Dr. Goodenough as well as yourself for the 
assurance that there is no love lost between you 
and me : — nothing can make me so perfectly happy 
as that assurance, nor anything more afflict me 
than if the contrary were the case.
I am very well 
aware that to be on good terms with you is envia- 
ble, that I am highly interested in cultivating your 
good-will, that from your peculiar advantages and 
knowledge, the common run of men should court 
you ; but, in the name of God, I can assure you 
that, were botany quite out of the question, I know 
not a man on earth whose friendship I so much de- 
sire, nor whose sentiments harmonize so perfectly 
with mine, as yours.
I love you from my heart, 
and know you well enough to be certain of a return.
I have just received a cabinet on the plan of yours.
Bravo !
I like to hear of your superb works with 
coloured plates, — and to be dedicated to the Mar- 
chioness of Rockingham : it were almost neces- 
sary, entre nous, to persuade her Aralia to bear 
some new kind of flower.
But to be serious, — 
has she been in town ?
Pray when you see her 
19 
present my compliments.
Nothing can be more 
unpleasant than the difficulty of speedy and safe 
communication between this place and England.
I 
have a tolerable drawing, I may say a good one, of 
Micropus erectus, but cannot find a conveyance to 
England.
I should have more frequent opportu- 
nities were I at Jamaica.
You give me such longings in telling me the 
New Holland seeds rise at Lee's, that I am melan- 
choly when I feel the impossibility of beholding 
them.
The peasants here have a proverb, " Ou 
la chevre est attache'e il faut quelle broute:'' so I 
must broute my neighbouring Pyrolas, and not 
think of New Holland fruits, — Proteas, Rons- 
seas !
Thouinias !
Yet let me not depart this life 
without being able to show a Smithia in my little 
herbarium.
La Chenal writes to nobody.
I have been looking out for your Lichen cucul- 
latus ?
and I believe have got it ; yet I sought long, 
and began to despair before I found the fructifica- 
tion.
Francois ought to pass here on his return to 
England.
I shall be very glad to see him ; but it 
would affect me to see him without his master, and 
that must, and as Corporal Trim or some one says, 
by G — shall come.
I see my phrase is obscure, 
but it will not be so to you.
God bless you !
Write if you can, were it but a 
few lines, to give me new existence.
I must work 
at my garden while the weather permits.
Yours, 
E. Davall.

J. E.
Smith to Mr. D avail.
My dear Friend, London, Nov. 17, 1789.
I was really very near writing to you to know 
what was beeome of you, when your most welcome 
letter arrived.
Many thanks for your kind ex- 
pressions of regard, which I hope to be ever worthy 
of, inasmuch as similar feelings for you may de- 
serve them.
But how is it that you tell me not 
one word of your marriage ?
Could you think I 
should not be interested in an event so important 
to your happiness ?
Who is the lady ?
May she 
be worthy of you, and, if possible, no enemy to 
Flora !
Since you went away I am become very intimate 
with your friend Forster, whom indeed I had long 
known as a botanist, and now esteem highly as a 
most amiable and sensible man.
Your introducing: 
me to Lady Rockingham has been peculiarly for- 
tunate, and I rejoice to owe such an advantage to 
you.
She is a worthy woman ; and her sentiments 
accord with mine in many things.
She treats me 
with peculiar affability and attention, and some- 
times consults me medically as well as botanically.
She has given me her six volumes of Hortus Ma- 
labaricus, a very useful and magnificent present.
I go to Hillingdon on Wednesday, to present young 
Jacquin to her.
I now begin to answer your letter.
— Thank you 
for your care of the diplomas, and Van Berchemian 
anecdotes thereunto belonging !
— how expressive !
The Linnaean Society goes on admirably.
We have 
21 
fixed on some papers for printing- : Dryander has 
given us a most excellent one on Begonias.
When 
will you send us something out of the abundance 
of your discoveries ?
I could wish to see your name 
in the first volume.
We had a very comfortable day at Lady Rock- 
ingham's, and came back late on Thursday.
She 
is to give Jacquin a fine drawing of her Ai'alia, 
(which is really an Hedera,) by Sowerby.
The blunder of making your Gentiana a variety 
of campestris is Linnaeus's, in Mant.
2. All Mur- 
ray's are manual blunders ; there is no idea in the 
case.
I will write to Francois your kind invitation : 
his return is at present uncertain.
I always -flatter 
myself with the hopes of seeing you and Switzer- 
land again.
Dickson has brought many things from Scotland.
We have got seeds from the East Indies of Smithia, 
and when they grow you shall have some.
Bring out your work, that I may publish a Da- 
vallia.
Adieu, my dear friend : do not forget 
Your ever affectionate 
J. E.
Smith.
Mr. Davall to J.
E. Smith.
Orbe, Nov. 24, 1789.
I hope, my good friend, that you have long ere 
this received the first part of this letter, sent to the 
post on the 27th of October.
I have an Arenaria; 
— shall send you several of my best specimens, as it 
is within my reach on the nearest mountain, Suchet, 
22 
mentioned often by Haller, ex.
gr.
under Stachys 
alpina, Festuca decumbens, &c.
I have Sonchus canadensis on the same mountain, 
which I call my mountain : a Ribes which I think 
peti'CEum, Jacq.
; — but you shall become acquainted 
personally with my good friend Suchet, where I 
have also found Hypericum d?ibium, Leers, in pro- 
fusion.
I could send you a thousand specimens, and 
will send.
I fear that among Banksias, Fuchsias, Proteas, 
and such heavenly plants, the poor Potentillas will 
hardly find a place ; yet you will not neglect even 
an Adooca, if you could attend to the Chenopodium 
which I wrote to you about.
This is certainly an 
handsome Potenlilla.
I shall say nothing of the 
Arenarias, otherwise than that such a plant of Hal- 
ler is such a plant of Linn.
Herb.
All my discri- 
minating notes are for my private information : 
the rest is yours by every reason, and by our agree- 
ment: — moreover, my dear friend, no one is equal 
to the task but you.
Have you received the Are- 
narias of Piedmont ?
&c.
I long to know how you 
go on in that charming genus.
God bless you for your charming and precious 
specimen of Diapensia lapponica, gathered by Lin- 
naeus.
A piece of the Cross is less precious to a bigot 
Catholic: it shall soon be framed and glazed.
Aristo- 
lochia Pistolochia gave me great pleasure.
Lichens 
will be treasures ; and Grasses, — Oh !
how I long 
to understand them well; — the Agrostis tribe, &c.
My paper is full, and I have not done ; but I 
cannot say on paper all I would say ; I must not 
23 
take up too much of your time, nor write too often, 
although my heart will, I fear, oblige me to re- 
commence ere long.
What will you say, when I 
tell you I am married !
— but it is to a person of the 
best merit.
She has so often heard me speak to 
her of you, she has remarked the extreme pleasure 
your letters give me, the readiness with which I sit 
down to write to you rather than to any other per- 
son, that she longs to see you as my best friend.
She desires her compliments, and invites you here 
as cordially as myself.
I wish to send you some few trifles.
I wish to 
offer you some Chamouny honey.
Pray did you 
receive the chamois horns ?
I do not ask for 
thanks, for I shall always be indebted to you.
Believe me, with the most affectionate and grate- 
ful remembrance, 
Your devoted Friend, 
E. Davall.
From the same.
My dear Friend, Orbe, Jan. 25—29, 1790.
I hope you received the continuation of my letter 
of the 27th of October, dated 24th of November.
On the 7th of December I had the happiness of 
receiving your delightful letter of November 17 — 24.
It is quite impossible to express the effect of your 
letters on me ; — yet there is a passage in your last 
that thoroughly dejected me, where (as you well 
might say) after expressing your friendship, and 
thanking me for mine, you add " but how is it that 
24 
you tell me not one word of your marriage ?
" This 
but has been to me as an accusation to the most con- 
science-wounded criminal.
I shall all my life regret 
that you learnt this event from any other than my- 
self; yet I might have assured you that the person 
was no enemy to Flora.
I was so dissatisfied with 
my position, in a house with two good old aunts (for 
one died since my return here), who have no other 
ideas than those of that herd of silly beings called 
gens du monde> eternal players of quadrille, in a place 
where I find no reasonable creature to converse 
with, that I yielded to the idea of uniting myself 
to a young lady whose conversation I had always 
found more agreeable than any other here, and 
whose way of thinking agrees so well with mine.
She is a year older than myself; only daughter of 
one of the best families in this country.
Her name 
was De Cottens.
Her eldest brother, who is about 
twenty-three, and not of age here till twenty-five, is 
C. Lieut, in the Swiss Guards at the Hague : — the 
other, Ensign and Aide Major in a Swiss regiment 
in the King of Sardinia's service.
But as the world 
goes, I would rather have a wife of her disposition 
and way of thinking, with little fortune, than a 
worldly-minded girl with a great one.
My wife is so 
much attached to you from my speaking of you to 
her as my best friend, and the person of all others I 
most esteem and love, that she insists on learning to 
dry plants to send to you, and often says, 
" Presses le devenir ; faiteslui mes complimens en Vas- 
surant que nous ferons tout ce qui est possible pour 
rendre ce s&jour agreable ; nous en aurons si grand 
25 
soin queje suis sure quilse tronvera bien avec nous." 
I answer, that must and shall be some time or other; 
and if he will not come, I shall never die contented.
You make me very happy in what you say of 
Lady Rockingham.
I had wished she might have 
the good thought of placing so judiciously her du- 
plicate Hart.
Mai. Pray, present my compliments 
when you see her.
I have so many things to say 
that I hardly know where to begin, and shall be 
obliged to scrawl a second sheet.
If young Jacquin is still in England, pray give 
him my compliments, and tell him I expect he will 
not forget me in his journey through this part of 
the world.
What a wretched figure his father has 
given of Arenaria linifiora in his second volume of 
Collectanea !
I can send you a most charming specimen in 
fine preservation of one of the rarissima plants of 
Switzerland, gathered by me this last season on 
Great St. Bernard, Sisymbrium tanacetifolium ; but I 
ought not to have asked you whether you want it.
— Pray tell me frankly as you should, and I know 
you will, whether I may copy in the course of my 
work, your text concerning Sonchus alpinus and 
Stellaria dichotoma.
If you do not wish it, you will 
give me a new proof of friendship in saying No.
— Although I must now look to close ceconomy, I 
long most irresistibly to ornament my study with 
the plates of Limodorum Tankervillia, and Strelit- 
%ia, in colours ; and if Lee would permit Sowerby 
to copy Miss Lee's drawing of Protea tnellifera, and 
you direct the choice of some fourth rare and spe- 
26 
ciosa planta of which Sowerby might make me a 
good drawing, all four in exact colouring, I would 
live six months on bread and water to pay for them.
What with you, and the English gardens, I have 
some cruel moments of maladie du pays.
Your 
letters and these drawings will be a temporary cure.
I could not exist under the idea of not returning to 
England, but I certainly cannot during my aunt's 
life.
Jacq.
FL Austr.
gives as a true distinction of 
Senecio sarracenicus and nemorensis, 8 radii in sar- 
racen.
and 5 in nemorens.
Now all the plants I 
have seen in Switzerland answer to Jacquin's ne- 
morens.
which, according to Haller, is non satis 
certa civis ; but Haller's authority in the citation of 
Linnaeus is to me of little force.
Do you find Jac- 
quin's observation good in the specimens of Herb.
Linn.?
I have made no note on the radii.
I am more 
and more embarrassed with Hieracium alpinum, 
and have several to communicate to you : — some 
scapo nudo H.
alp.
Allion.
non Linn.
Herb.; — an- 
other with a narrow leaf on the upper part of the 
stalk, somewhat likeLightfoot's figure; and I almost 
suspect that the pili take the rufous colour in the 
dried specimens from age, as I have seen gradations 
in the Herbariums.
As to the colour, I hardly dare 
say anything of this plant, and would wish to leave it 
to you, and will communicate what I have of speci- 
mens.
I do not mean to say that the plant of Al- 
lioni and many others be the alpinum: I think it is 
not ; — but the other is much less frequent, which I 
have gathered on the heights of Great St. Bernard, 
27 
and which I have from the Grimsel.
I am the more 
disposed to think the pili may take the rufous colour 
from age, as the pubescence of the calyces in Trifo- 
lium incarnatum becomes quite rufous in dried spe- 
cimens, and as I observed no such colour in the re- 
cent plant which I saw in La Chenal's garden.

Forgive me : you know my intentions.
The Chenopodia are terrible.
I now find that what 
Haller refers to, rubrum Linn, (which I have not yet 
found here) is murale.
This is not uncommon, and 
I did not see rubrum even in Haller's habitation, 
the pays d'aigle, which is the seat of Chenopodia.
How I long to see your new coloured work !
You tell me I am good, because I have been in 
search of your Lichen cucullatus.
Remember, my 
good friend, that all the little I can do to render you 
service, is to me the most agreeable duty, and the 
greatest pleasure I can know.
I am dissatisfied in 
not having in my power the hundredth part of what 
I could wish to do.
It is curious that Wyttenbach 
should have given you Stellaria cerastoides for Ce- 
rastium alpinum.
He sent it to me by the name of 
Arenaria multicaulis.
He should stick to his mi- 
nerals.
I have not yet Cerastium alpinum, how- 
ever strange it may appear.
Your inestimable present of Diapensia lapponica 
is framed and glazed, with your label, as your hand- 
writing is to me a treasure.
I have had two cases 
made for my Herbarium, as yours are with a top 
in pyramid, and Wedgwood's medallion of Lin- 
28 
naeusin the middle.
But alas!
my divisions are 
not full, although they contain many excellent 
things.
I almost hecome ambitious, and would 
wish to have in my herbarium other than Swiss 
plants, although they must and shall be my princi- 
pal object.
I could wish to have plants that nei- 
ther Wyttenbach, Haller, or La Chenal can produce.
— What will you think of me ?
I have thrown off 
some of my moderate and humble ideas, and may 
say as you tell me, " You may thank yourself." If 
I no longer think myself a cipher, may it not be, 
that having left every path that might have led to 
an amelioration of fortune, I wish to have an ade- 
quate collection ?
adequate recompence ?
When I 
think of some men, among whom I may in con- 
science, without an atom of flattery, reckon J.
E. 
Smith, I hide my head ; — when I think of some 
others, I draw aside the veil.
Adieu, my dear friend.
Remember your most 
affectionate and devoted 
E. Davall.
J. E.
Smith to Mr. Davall.
My good Friend, London, March 9, 1790.
Your two delightful long letters were most ac- 
ceptable, and have not been answered yet for that 
very reason, for I have not been able to sit down to 
answer them as they deserve, so have deferred it.
Nevertheless, I must thank you for them now, and 
answer them fully when I can.
I am now in the 
29 
midst of my zoological and botanical lectures, which 
I am obliged to compose every day before I deliver 
them.
I have a private pupil besides, who comes 
to my house, (Lady Hume,) and I am printing my 
second fasciculus of Icones ineditce ; writing the 
letter- press for Icones pictce (of which, by the by, 
Lady Rockingham means to beg your acceptance 
of a copy from her).
Besides this, I have two or 
three other works in hand.
Judge then whether I 
am busy or not !
I indeed owe you a grudge for 
suspecting I should not rejoice with all my heart at 
your marriage, and quite forget botany itself in so 
interesting an occurrence.
I admire the principles 
upon which you have made your choice ; they are 
certainly the only ones upon which a wise man can 
be happy.
How I long to know the lady !
and 
how much I think myself obliged to her for her 
kind message !
Tell her, a plant of her drying 
shall meet with its due reverence ; I shall even be 
rejoiced to hear she adopts as an amusement your 
favourite pursuit ; for certainly a similarity of tastes, 
especially the more elegant ones, endears a com- 
panion vastly to us.
But I shall no less esteem 
your lady, if I hear that the cares of a family (on 
which I congratulate you on having a prospect) 
should take her off even from botany.
You inquire about my old faithful servant Fran- 
cois.
He is come back, but was robbed on his way.
The Archduke of Milan has, however, been very 
kind to him, and even sent him a present.
I hope 
one day to have him as a botanical servant, as he is 
above being a mere footman.
Perhaps the time 
30 
will come, he may travel with me, — but these are 
visions.
This summer will probably determine 
many things respecting me.
In short, I rely on 
the blessing of Providence which has hitherto been 
most indulgent to me ; and as long as I wish for 
what is only really best, I cannot be materially un- 
happy.
Excuse this grave unbotanical letter.
Re- 
member me most respectfully to your lady.
I will 
write you a longer letter when I can.
I am re- 
markably well this fine winter, — no snow at all !
Yours, 
J. E.
Smith.
Mr. Davall to J.
E. Smith.
My good Friend, Orbe, March 23, 1790.
I last night received your most friendly letter of 
the 9th, which gave me equal pleasure and equal 
pain.
Yet even the pain, from the degree in which 
I felt it, and now do feel it, was to me a delight, as 
a fresh and most convincing proof of my warm and 
sincere attachment to you, and of your proportion- 
ate return.
Oh now I do indeed conceive most 
forcibly, how much you might be dissatisfied with 
my temporary silence.
You might well, as you say, 
owe me a grudge ; but I can swear by all that is 
sacred and dear to me, that, as it is the first, it shall 
be the last.
I had adopted the idea that I was not 
doomed to enjoy that greatest object of my ambi- 
tion, a warm and bosom friend ; and I dare add, 
that at the same time I felt within me all that was 
31 
proper for maintaining such a desirable connexion, 
and you were above every other the person whose 
attachment I had most desired.
My wife, who of- 
fers you her most friendly compliments, desires you 
with me, never to forget that you have now a home 
at Orbe.
We join in entreating you not to refuse 
us a favour we have to ask of you ; which is, in 
case our child comes safe into the world, that you 
will be so good as to consent to be its godfather.
Nothing can make us more happy ; and you may 
safely consent in a moral point of view, as we shall 
ourselves take care of its principles.
Adieu, my best friend, and believe me for my life 
Your devoted and affectionate 
E. Davall.
P. S.
Smithia sensitiva is framed and glazed in 
my study, and I never enter without bowing to 
Diapensia Lapponica !
! These two are together 
in the sacred corner between the bookcase which 
contains Linnaeus's works, and my (little as yet) 
Herbarium.
Heaven preserve your health ; and, as the ghost 
of Hamlet says, " Farewell, — remember me." 
«/.
E. Smith to Mr. Davall.
My dear Friend, London, April 25, 1790, 
Bring out your book as soon as possible, and by 
all means call it Illustrationes Halleriance, or some 
such title.
I received your box by Lord Sinclair : 
32 
thanks for L.
cucullatus.
I have only one point to 
answer in your last of the 23rd of March.
I feel deeply the proof of your affection in wish- 
ing me to be godfather to your child ; but you shall 
judge whether I ought, or not.
I must be quite 
open with you in this as in all things.
I could not 
conscientiously promise it.
I have taken much 
pains to settle my faith ; and, thank God, it is set- 
tled so as to make me very happy.
I am no en- 
thusiast : I look up to one God, and delight in 
referring all my hopes and wishes to him.
I con- 
sider the doctrine and example of Christ as the 
greatest blessing God has given us, and that his 
character is the most perfect and lovely we ever 
knew, except that of God himself.
This is my 
religion, and I hope it is not unsound.
I have 
found great good from it; and if not all the good I 
ought, I feel it is my own fault.
But to the point 
in question.
I think godfathers and godmothers 
an unnecessary form, and even worse, as a religious 
form that means nothing cannot be innocent.
If 
by it is meant only that I am to be attached nearer 
to the child than any one except its parents, that I 
may presume more to advise and study its happi- 
ness, — very well ; but that I shall do without any 
form or ceremony.
I had rather the ceremony, as 
far as respects me, were dispensed with.
But if you 
and Mrs. Davall still persist in your desire, and 
think it will in any manner attach me closer to you, 
I submit.
Pray give my best respects and wishes to her.
May she soon be a happy mother !
and may you 
33 
ever be happy in each other !
My next favourite 
hope is to come and see you one day.
— I long to 
see Switzerland again, and you I must see ; I like 
to indulge cheerful hope.
Thank God I have en- 
joyed much, and hope to enjoy more ; — if not, His 
will be done, and I shall not be the worse for hav- 
ing hoped.
Adieu !
Yours ever, 
J. E.
Smith.
Mr. JDavall to J.
E. Smith.
My dear Friend, Orbe, May 81, 1790.
My time has been so taken up, what with the 
care of my garden and excursions to collect some 
of the plants I wished to send you, that I find my- 
self close to Mandrot's departure.
— Now for your 
last invaluable letter : but I must first say, that I 
told you in my letter of the 27th April, that I should 
have a good opportunity of sending specimens.
It 
w 7 as by a most worthy man, and a very good friend 
of mine, who was on his departure for England, 
Mr. Schutz, the Queen's equerry; he dined with me 
on a Thursday, was to set off in ten days, was taken 
suddenly ill four days after I saw him, and died.
I 
regret him most sincerely.
Nothing can be more perfectly open, sincere and 
friendly, than your answer to my request of being 
godfather to rny child, if it conies well into this 
world.
I assure you, my good friend, although 
I have been educated in the Church of England, I 
consider the office of godfathers and godmothers 
VOL.

D 
34 
as unnecessary ; as you will judge, that if I had not 
thought that parents ought to attend to the care of 
their children's principles, I should not have asked 
a person — for my misfortune far too distant from 
me, to fill this ceremony.
I wished that my child 
might have you for his friend, and I am certain that 
it will be so.
I may safely say that the reasoning 
you make use of is in such perfect concord with 
good sense, that if I were obliged to make a formal 
declaration of my ideas, they would agree very well 
with yours ; and I would readily^infuse them into my 
child.
My devotion is mostly private, though I fre- 
quent the church here, and I believe I may any one 
that is Protestant, without any great impropriety.
I at no time feel myself so deeply penetrated with 
veneration for the Divinity as in the contemplation 
of his works, and hope that the tears of delight and 
adoration which often escape me in my herboriza- 
tions, and in examining the wonderful structure and 
providence so striking in every object, are as ac- 
ceptable to Him, and as fit to secure me His bless- 
ing, as my prayers ; and indeed I experience now, 
with gratitude, more happiness than I could ever 
have hoped.
May Heaven preserve you, my best friend, for 
botany and me !
You are and ever will be the first 
object of my prayer.
My wife and aunts desire their 
compliments.
Your devoted and most affectionate, 
E. Davall.

Smith to Mr. Davall.
My dear Friend, London, July 11, 1790.
Nothing could be more unlucky than my being 
out of town when Mr. Mandrot called.
Accept 
my most hearty thanks for your letter; you and I 
can never differ much, I believe, even in opinion, I 
should not have obtruded religious matters on you 
had I not been obliged, but now am glad I did so.
We can never go far wrong with such principles as 
yours.
May the God whom we sincerely endeavour 
to adore as we ought, bring your child safe into the 
world, and preserve its mother !
July 14.
— I have now got your inestimable packet, 
my dear friend, and know not how to find words to 
thank you for it.
The views * delight me above all; 
I cannot cease from looking at them.
How kind 
and attentive you are to what may give me plea- 
sure !
Your harvest on Mount Suchet was very 
rich.
Now, my dear friend, let me exhort you not to 
lose any time, but bring out your work directly.
You must not wait to make it anything like com- 
plete.
There is no end of that.
I will now confess to you a fault I have been 
guilty of, as I ought not "to dissemble or cloke be- 
fore you".
I distributed the seeds you sent among 
Fairbairn, Dickson, Lee, Curtis, and Goodenough; 
from some carelessness I gave none to Aiton.
Will 
you pardon me for this, and send anything you 
please to make my peace with him ; — I shall mind

Pray be 
not angry, and write soon to your ever affectionate 
friend,

Honoured Madam, August 30, 1790.
Yesterday Dr. Younge and I set off for Went- 
worth House, where we were received with all kind- 
ness and attention.
Lord Fitzwilliam was to have 
been at York races, but was not well enough to go; 
so we dined alone, and afterwards went to the new 
mausoleum erected for the Marquis of Rockingham, 
which is very elegant and grand : saw the gardens, 
&c.
We were attended by the chaplain and steward, 
two old servants of Lord and Lady Rockingham's, 
who thought they could not do enough for me as 
her friend.
Indeed it was pleasing to see how many 
old servants and workmen gathered about me, ma- 
king inquiries concerning her, and sending their 
duty to their old mistress.
Lord Fitzwilliam being 
better in the afternoon, we drank tea with him ; and 
little Lord Milton, who is not five years old, brought 
me all the botanical books he could find, and told 
me the Linnaean names of some plants I had just 
brought out of the garden ; he was very loth to 
leave me to go to -bed.
We went to prayers in the 
evening in the chapel.
— Next day after breakfast 
saw the house at our leisure.
Lord and Lady Harewood are at Scarborough, 
37 
so I shall not have an opportunity of going to see 
them.
I am in great haste, as a messenger waits for my 
letter.
Adieu !

Madame, Londres, ce 28 Sept.
1790.
Quoique je ne seaurois que regretter l'accident 
qui m'a procure l'honneur de recevoir une lettre si 
flatteuse et si interessante de votre part, permettez 
moi, puisque le mal s'est passe, de me feliciter d' avoir 
merite de quelque maniere que ce soit les sentiments 
que vous avez pour moi.
C'est avec joie que je vous 
felicite aussi du retablissement (parfait j'ose esperer 
a present) de votre estimable et digne epoux, dont 
l'amitie m'est si chere.
Je l'ai conjure de ne pas ex- 
poser sa sante a.
de nouveaux dangers, mais c'est a 
vous de le faire obeir a nos souhaits.
J'espere qu'il 
s'occupera un peu de sa jeune fille par preference ; je 
craindrois presque si vous lui presentiez plusieurs 
de cette espece de jolies fleurs, que celles dont il s'est 
occupe avec tant d'empressement jusqu'ici ne soient 
negligees.
J'en serai un peu jaloux.
Adieu, Madame: continuez de faire le bonheur de 
mon ami et de tous ceux qui vous connoissent, et 
n'oubliez pas que vous avez des amis sinceres ici 
qui vous souhaitent toute la felicite que vous meri- 
tez si bien.
Je suis toujours, Madame, 
Votre tres humble et tres obeissant Serviteur, 
J. E.
Smith.

Mr. Davall to J.
E. Smith.
My very dear Friend, Orbe, Feb. 11, 1791.
How can I ever acknowledge your goodness, and 
I may say your preferable attention and favour, to 
me, in giving up so much of your precious time to 
me and to the settling of my doubts ; in truth, will 
it not be to you to whom students will be obliged, 
if my work contains any thing good?
I am, God 
knows, as grateful as any man possessed of a heart 
uncorrupted and capable of the warmest attachment 
can be ; — but this is nearly all I have to offer you.
May I never hope the blessing of Providence, if 
ever you discover a friend more cordial and sincere!
I hardly think but of you, and, together with my 
best female friend and my little girl, I exist but for 
and through vou.
The weather has been mild of late; the snow has 
melted; we have had rain, and what they properly 
call here "tin hiver pourri": at a time when 1 ought 
to work assiduously at the execution of my delayed 
plan, I have had longirigs and lo7igings like those 
of a pregnant woman, to ramble after Lichens.
I 
have been but once ; hereafter I must ramble.
Ha- 
ving observed t'other day a charming Lichen on a 
rock, which I could not well detach, as the weather 
was dry, I returned yesterday under favour of a lit- 
tle rain, which procured me a good scolding from 
my good old aunts, and some little reprimand from 
my wife ; but I was soon console, as I believe my 
Lichen may be worth your attention.
There is one 
39 
specimen remarkably fine; this naturally is destined 
for J.
E. S.
I am almost sure my plant is Psora testacea {Li- 
chen testaceus) Hoffman, Plantce JLichenosce.
Tell 
me whether you have it, and whether it be not good, 
that I may not have been brought to task for no- 
thing.
Obs. I do not find this plant in Haller ; — if 
so, it will be another addition to FL Helv.
It seems 
to have affinity to your gypsaceus, but mine has fine 
red tubercula.
N.B. One time or other, when 
you are at Sir J.
Banks's without much to do, read 
Saussure, Voyages dans ks Alpes, vol.

Glacier de laValsorey, which is very good.
You will then see for a moment the spot where I ga- 
thered Gentiana tenella.
I crossed the glacier, and looked into the Gouille 
a V^assu.
To return to what I was talking of: — You see, 
my dearest friend, that, from the non-execution of 
my plan, I appear irresolute, — slow, — and I know 
not what ; my disordered health is very much against 
me, not less so the indispensable care of my garden, 
and the absolute impossibility of resisting the de- 
lightful verdure that surrounds me during the good 
season, and which I have here under every form of 
wood, marsh, pasture, corn-fields, mountains ; — and 
how are they to be resisted ?
Let me hereafter do 
all the little I can, by excursions and the aid of my 
garden, to be of use to you.
Let me be as it were 
a part, an unworthy part, of yourself; and let every 
step, every remark be subservient to your use.
This 
is my ambition and my warmest desire as long as 
40 
I exist in this world.
If I am called on to bid adieu 
to my wife, to plants, and to you, let my books and 
my plants be admitted to your use.
Preserve them 
in memory of a true and cordial friend, who dying 
with this assurance will be happier even in Paradise.
English Botany pleases me much.
The motto is 
admirable, and the more so as original.
Adieu, my 
good friend !
May Heaven preserve you, and con- 
tinue your health !
Your very affectionate, 
E. Davall.

Orbe, April 30, 1791.
Having learnt, my very dear friend, that a voitu- 
rier of my neighbourhood sets off on Monday, and 
hoping him more honest than his brethren, I ea- 
gerly embrace the opportunity of writing a few lines 
in haste, which accompany a little barrel of Cha- 
mouny honey, that I wish you to taste.
The bees 
who have made it feed chiefly on Pinus Larix.
The Anemone sylvestris, which Curtis's Magazine 
says often becomes troublesome in gardens, is, alas !
one of the greatest desiderata in mine.
— Pray let it 
be Pota?nogeton ohtusum.
If you knew me suffi- 
ciently well, my good friend, you would have di- 
rected it so without even consulting me, who wish 
for nothing so much as to be guided in all matters 
by you, and whose highest ambition is (however un- 
worthy perhaps) to exist as your and the Linnaean 
Society's delegate in this country.
All my views 
41 
tend thither ; hence, after my own private and de- 
solate enjoyment, every excursion — each solitary 
climbing of the mountains — the source of new 
vigour, when sitting to recover my breath at the 
foot of some black fir in dismal woods, where the 
woodpecker is the only being who salutes me.
Had 
I never known you, I should have wanted the energy 
which has brought my garden to what it already is, 
and what more I hope it will be.
- To divert my 
thoughts I have taken a turn in that part of my 
garden which I arrogantly name the Alps.
Iberis 
rotundifol.F.; Viola biJloraY.; Laserpitium simplex 
coming to F.; Ranunculus Thora in bud; Ranun- 
culus rutafolius and parnassifol.
with leaves in true 
Alpine vigour, not garden luxuriance; Turritis cce- 
rulea — all coining to flower ; Hieracium alpinum, 
H.L.; Hierac.
montanmn, formerly Hypochceris pon- 
tana; Phaca alpina,frigida and australis, in tolera- 
ble condition ; Phellandrium Mutellina coming out 
of the ground.
What say you to this ?
Is it not 
worthy of you?
Yet nothing pleases me so much as 
Thlaspi alpestre, (which is marked J.
E. S.
Mat- 
lock,) and Astragalus leucophcEus, Smith, — both in 
flower, and both from you.
My little girl has two teeth.
— May Heaven pre- 
serve and give you every blessing!
E. Davall.

These, my dear friend, I look upon as two of 
the most original and interesting of my discoveries, 
being quite unknown and undescribed.
Add to 
these No. 29.

much better you and / search for plants, than any- 
body else : but let us not be too vain.
Compari- 
son with you may be in danger of making me so; 
43 
for, without a compliment, you are more accurate 
than almost anybody I ever knew.
But what shall 
I say to your most precious black and gold Lichen 
in the round box !
It never blest my eyes before.
How like geographicus, and yet how distinct !
It 
must come among the imbricati.
What think you 
of chrysomelanos for a name ?
But I would not 
dictate, as it is yours alone !
I have inquired about you from Madame Combe, 
who is so good as to indulge me with talking about 
you.
She draws me a charming picture, which 
must be true, of your happiness.
Your little girl is 
"jolie comme un cceur, mais petite ; et les tantes si 
bonnes !
et si heureuses !
et toute la famille si heu- 
reuse !
" Tant mieux, thought I ; cards then and bo- 
tany are come to a treaty of peace, of which I guess 
the chere e'pouse is the connecting link ; and if so, it 
is best of all.
Mademoiselle Combe says you have 
played at quadrille this last winter : even / play at 
whist.
I hope we shall be rewarded !
How I long to see the first sheet of your work !
Your gold and black Lichen Hudson and Dickson 
are positive is geographicus.
They say it is altered 
by growing on earth, not stones.
May be so ; it is 
very like it.
As I send so few playthings to papa, I must send 
one for the jolie petite ; so pray teach her my name 
when she can speak, that she may learn to sound 
the tli early.
The two tinkling bells may serve to 
promote exercise and trying to walk ; and I send 
two, that there may be one in store when the other 
is broken, which I presume may soon happen.

Nymph&a Nelumbo has been in flower at Bulstrode 
lately (the first time in Europe).
It is a new genus, 
and is to be called Portlandia, as I must make the 
old one a Catesbaca.

Believe me ever yours most truly, 
J. E.
Smith.
Mr. D avail to J.
E. Smith.
Orbe, July 22, 1791.
Flaction delivered to me your parcel containing 
your very charming Spicilegium Botanicum ; and 
just now your letter, and parcel of plants with true 
Arenaria saxatilis !
and Acrostichum Mar ant <b !
But, my best friend, all these precious and most ex- 
cellent gifts have found me and the incomparable 
(I may well say) partner of my cares in the most 
cruel and heartfelt affliction.
We had just then 
been separated from our beloved child, to whom 
we were dotingly attached.
She had enjoyed bet- 
ter health than the greater number of us experi- 
ence at so tender an age ; had successively (per- 
haps too precipitately) cut six teeth, without any 
convulsions.
She was to all appearance so well, so 
strong, that we began to hope she might pass safely 
over the critical period of teething.
It is true, we 
were frequently alarmed, perhaps from a sort of 
superstitious terror, at what was surely unnatural 
intelligence in a child who had not completed the 
45 
eleventh month.
She was to all appearance per- 
fectly well on the third of this month, — in good 
spirits, — slept well for nine hours on that night.
Early on the morning of the fourth she was seized 
with a heaviness, looked pale, and could not keep 
up her head.
We called in our physician, and sent 
an express eight miles off for another who is much 
esteemed here in the treatment of young children.
They administered some remedies, — applied blis- 
ters to her legs : she appeared somewhat better for 
an hour, looked up to her mother and me when 
we spoke to her.
In the night she grew worse, 
was seized with convulsions ; and about nine o'clock 
the next morning the dear little angel expired.
No 
mother, I believe, has ever shown more assiduous 
care from the moment of her child's birth.
So 
constant has her attention been, day and night, 
that her own health is much affected by the fatigue 
attending the tender care of her beloved offspring.
Her affliction is so great, so deep, — and not ex- 
pressed, as less serious grief, by tears, — that I am now 
anxious for her.
I have already taken her, endea- 
vouring to divert her thoughts, to spend a week at 
a friend's at some distance ; and in a few days we 
undertake a journey wholly for the same purpose.
I shall take her to Basle, where she has never been, 
and we shall stay a few days with La Chenal.
You will readily pardon me, my dearest and very 
best friend, if I have entered too minutely on a sub- 
ject which has dejected me beyond all expression.
My fondness for my child was excessive, — by many 
it would be called unmanly; but I have always been 
46 
too susceptible of attachments.
So I feared I had 
been towards you, my worthy friend, during my 
last visit to my native land.
After having seen you 
repeatedly, — after having perceived, which I pre- 
sently did, that you were the man who by charac- 
ter, conformity of mind, and every other reason, 
was formed as the resting-place of my best friend- 
ship, — had I not experienced on my return here 
such marks of reciprocal good-will, as are greater 
far than I had any reason or hope to expect, I 
should now be, as it were, annihilated : I should 
be the most surly misanthrope on earth.
I had known many disappointments, and was 
too much disposed to feel them.
Botany, which 
now and ever is the chief " balm of my hurt mind," 
would have been abandoned : I had been an use- 
less burthen on the earth.
Now, through you.
I 
may be not an useless member of society.
Is it fit, 
and dare I recall to your memory here, that " Full 
many a flower is born to blush unseen ; and waste 
its sweetness on the desert air" ?
In the circumstances which now oppress me, I 
have often thought it would be a satisfaction to me 
if you had seen my child.
If she had smiled on 
you, as she did daily on us ; — if she had stretched 
forth her little arm to you, you would then at least 
be better able to conceive our affliction, which, in 
my calmer moments, I readily allow to be perfect 
egotism, as she is surely more happy than she could 
have been with us.
My wife and myself were ex- 
tremely pleased (though with a mixture of cruel 
emotion) at all the kind attentions you have shown 
47 
to our beloved ehild.
We shall keep the play- 
things, when they come, with the greatest care, and 
shall frequently visit them with sentiments of the 
kindest nature for you, and resignation to the will 
of Providence.
My wife joins me in kindest regards.
Yours ever most affectionately, 
E. Davall.
J. E.
Smith to Mr. Davall.
London, Sept.
3, 1791.
I should not have deferred a moment, my very 
dear friend, answering your last letter, had I been 
in town when it came, and had I been sure of my 
answer meeting you at home, which this probably 
will.
I cannot express how much I feel for your 
great and sudden affliction.
As much as one who 
is not a father can enter into your affliction, I do ; 
for you will do me the justice to think I am not 
deficient in the feelings of a friend.
It was surely 
a very strange and sudden illness that deprived you 
of your dear little girl ; and from your account it 
was independent of teething, and rather some very 
violent fever, for which there could be no help from 
the beginning.
I am anxious to hear how Mrs.
Davall bears her distress.
It must go hard with 
her.
But you are happy in each other, and have 
nothing to reproach yourselves with.
" The Lord 
gave, and 'tis he that hath taken away;" and he will, 
48 
I trust, send you many blessings to supply the place 
of that you have lost.
I cannot help sending you a 
few lines from memory, part of an epitaph on four 
children, who died of the plague about 150 years 
ago.
They are engraved on a monument in a field 
somewhere in England.
The style is not perfect, 
but the sentiments very affecting: — 
" Good and Great God, to thee we do resign 
Our four sweet sons, for they were chiefly thine ; 
And, Lord, we were not worthy of the name 
To be the sons of faithful Abraham, 
If we had not been willing for thy sake 
To yield our all, — as he his son Isa-ac !
" 
I regret much that I may have innocently added to 
your affliction by the toys I sent, and yet I think 
they will (after a time) not have that effect.
Cannot you visit England once more ?
I have 
many reasons to wish you could.
My connections 
are now much increased, and I could procure you 
more amusement than when you were here before.
We would visit the good Marchioness of Rocking- 
ham, with whom I am now quite intimate ; and I 
assure you she is a most excellent character.
How 
often do I wish for you when I am there !
I have also made an acquaintance I like very 
much in Sir Abraham and Lady Hume, a charming 
family indeed.
I have just been ten days at their 
house in Hertfordshire.
I spent two days at Bul- 
strode lately, and was very kindly treated.
All these 
places, and others, we will one day visit together ; 
but we must not confine ourselves to grandees.
I 
have one family with whom I must make you ac- 
49 
quainted, though alas !
embarrassed, and in some re- 
spects unhappy, but of most amiable, accomplished, 
elegant and feeling minds.
— Come then, and let us 
be happy together in pleasures which Heaven itself 
must contemplate with complacence, and whose very 
disappointments are more delightful than what nine 
tenths of the world so fondly pursue.
— I have almost 
filled my sheet without a word of botany !
Adieu !
God bless and comfort you both, says 
your ever affectionate 
J. E.
Smith.

Hillingdon House, March 10, 1792.
I was extremely glad to receive Dr. Smith's let- 
ter, but I must lament the not seeing him and Mr.
Afzelius at Hillingdon, before the latter departs for 
Sierra Leone.
There is something in the countenance and 
manner of that little man that shows a goodness 
which interests very much one's good wishes ; and 
I sincerely hope he will find both advantage and 
satisfaction in his botanical researches in this new 
settlement.
I have heard Governor Wentworth 
mention it, and shall ask him on Sunday the parti- 
culars of the botanizing arrangements there.
May 
I beg the favour of you to pay my debts to Mr. Af- 
zelius for those works of Thunberg's.
Might I also 
ask you to present ten guineas to Mr. Afzelius to 
purchase some trifle of botanical use, as a remem- 
brance of Hillingdon.

How can I have been so long before I have con- 
gratulated upon all the honours and glories that are 
surrounding Dr. Smith !
My letter ought to have 
begun with a proper homage upon the occasion : 
perhaps even this note may have to follow him into 
my royal neighbourhood ; but if not, I hope in Marl- 
borough-street he may condescend to eat a couple 
of pines which accompany my note.
I hope the travellers have not yet left you.
I think 
you are very good to give up your Francois, but I 
think he should be a little sorry to leave you.
Your sincere, &c.
M. Rockingham.
Mr. Davctll to J.
E. Smith.
Orbe, Oct. 12, 1792.
For several days past, my very dear friend, I have 
been intending to write to you for my comfort and 
my mind's ease.
I have waited in hopes of telling 
you I have received the delightful books I owe to 
your friendship ; — they at last arrived the evening 
of the day before yesterday, having been obliged to 
take a great detour in Germany to avoid the armies, 
&c.
&c.
Receive my best thanks for your continuation of 
the lovely and most interesting Spicilegium, which 
during the whole of yesterday was " balm to my hurt 
mind", as also your inimitable, and ne plus ultra, 
Icones pictce.
I must at present, to my great regret, lay aside 
botany during the rest of this letter, and I shall cer- 
51 
tainly derive strength from discharging my mind 
with the person of all others I most love, and in 
whom I have the greatest confidence.
If I expe- 
rience great uneasiness and some degree of melan- 
choly from what I am going to relate, I no doubt 
must attribute it in a great measure to the sad state 
of my health ever since my last serious illness.
I have often returned my warmest thanks to Pro- 
vidence for the state in which I am placed, — able to 
pursue the study which, with your friendship and 
the attachment of my wife, are the three great and 
only objects which make me value my existence.
I 
hoped ever to enjoy these blessings in peace and 
security ; yet God only knows whether I shall be 
in that state when you receive this.
You probably 
know that our restless neighbours are in possession 
of the greater part of Savoy.
The Genevans, seeing 
them at .their gates and fearing the same lot, have 
called on their allies the Swiss for succour ; near 
2000 Swiss, or rather 2140, (1500 of Berne and 640 
of Zuric,)have entered Geneva.
The French resident 
remonstrated against this admission, and has left 
Geneva, leaving a letter, in which he says " the ad- 
mission of the Swiss cannot be considered by the 
French but as a coalition with the other powers 
against Liberty !" The end of this letter is a direct 
declaration of war.
There are a great number of 
French close to Geneva, with artillery for a siege, 
&c.
&c.
; and it is expected they will shortly begin 
firing on that place.
The Swiss march in every di- 
rection towards the frontiers of our French neigh- 
bours, and are admirably well disposed to receive 
e 2 
52 
them.
If really they do attaek this country, there 
will certainly be bloody work, unless the French 
show their heels, as they sometimes do, at a first 
onset.
I am close to the frontiers (at about seven 
miles).
Now to speak openly, all my uneasiness at 
this moment arises from my having a wife to whom 
I am much attached : were it not for this, and see- 
ing my books, my herbarium, my hearth, and every 
thing at stake, I should not hesitate one moment to 
make one among the number, shoulder a musket if 
necessary, and be cut to pieces (if Heaven would have 
it so), with the hope of cutting down a wretch or two 
in the fields, where I am accustomed to look for 
plants and think of you ; rather than see my books 
and plants burnt, and be quietly carved to pieces in 
my study.
As things are, come what come may, I 
shall not stir from hence.
These French in fact, as 
noxious insects, are only to be feared from their 
immense numbers.
Nothing can be more delight- 
ful than the disposition of the common people here.
We have had (not being on the high road) only two 
bataillons who have passed here, among them many 
men who have left their home without having done 
sowing, yet no appearance of discontent.
Those of 
the German part, i.
e. true Swiss, have a grave and 
manly appearance, are perfectly well armed, their 
artillery of the best sort, and all in the most excel- 
lent order.
From what I can conjecture we have, 
or shall have shortly, between 30,000 and 40,000 
men stirring.
I had yesterday a young man with me 
who has escaped from the massacre of the Swiss 
Guards at Paris, in a manner almost miraculous.
53 
He is quite eager to come to blows ; and it is chiefly 
that sad affair which animates every individual.
— 
God bless you.
Write as soon as you can.

My very dear Friend, London, Nov. 9, 1792.
I write upon gilt paper for joy !
If I had a har- 
lequin sheet, such as Sterne puts in his Tristram 
Shandy, I would send it you to express my great 
joy at your escape.
I hope you will have no further 
alarms : I trust that the cut-throat party in France 
will be got under, and that they will settle into that 
manly rational liberty at which they professed to 
aim.
I should not despair of them, if they had but 
some principle of religion and less debauchery; on 
the contrary, their characters in these respects make 
me fear that nothing good can come out of them : 
but let us leave politics and politicians for our more 
virtuous study.
I am come to town for two days 
from Windsor.
I return this day.
I am delighted 
with my pupils : we all sit together at a round table.
I lecture from my notes, which the Queen takes 
home from Frogmore to Windsor to make extracts 
from ; and my audience occasionally ask questions 
and make remarks very much to the purpose, and 
a conversation of half an hour or more follows the 
lecture.
Nothing can be more polite and pleasing.
I shall be thus engaged till next month.
I have good 
news of Afzelius and Francois.
Yours, in haste, 
J. E.
Smith.

Mr. Afzelius to J.
E. Smith.
Dear Sir, Freetown, Sierra Leone, July 2, 1792.
I am happy to acquaint you with our safe arrival 
to this place the 6th of May last, and with our per- 
fect state of health since that time, except that Bo- 
rone has heen a little ill with a fever, from which 
he is now entirely recovered.
But I am sorry to 
say that the inconveniences we here meet with, see- 
ing the colony in confusion and divided into parties, 
and not having a separate house or room where we 
can dry our plants, preserve our things from the 
inclemency of the rainy season, and write down 
our observations, have hitherto prevented us from 
collecting any plants.
This is certainly a cruel si- 
tuation, particularly when we are surrounded by so 
many curious and unknown productions ; but we 
must wait for a more prosperous time.
Meanwhile 
I am vexed that we cannot have the pleasure of 
sending you, with the Sierra Leone packet, Captain 
Phipps, who now returns to London, anything but 
some bulbs and seeds, which I have only numbered; 
and I beg you will keep these numbers till another 
time, when I can be able to give them their proper 
names.
I leave it entirely to yourself to distribute 
them as you please: I only wish that no description 
or figure of them may be published before I can 
come back myself.
Amongst the bulbs are even 
those of the beautiful Hmnanthus multiflnrus and 
the charming Amaryllis ornata.
Borone behaves 
exceedingly well, and I am very happy to have got 
55 
so amiable a young man as my companion in my 
travels.
I wish you could be good enough to send me 
Gaertner de Seminibus, Schreber's edition of Genera 
Plantarum, and Gmelin's edition of the System, only 
the Vegetable Kingdom.
Though I like the terri- 
tory of Sierra Leone very much, the climate being 
fine, the spot where the town is built healthy, the 
soil good, the woods abounding in game, the water 
with fine fish, and the whole country with the most 
wonderful plants, of which I have already seen about 
the half part of them figured in Sir Joseph Banks's 
book; nevertheless I should already have been tired 
with this place, from the inconveniences I have suf- 
fered, had not Mr. Clarkson shown both me and 
Borone so much favour and so many civilities, and 
promised us to have very soon a house for ourselves.
This worthy gentleman is now almost the only man 
who supports the colony, and endeavours to put all 
things in order again : but it will be a long time 
before he will gain his laudable intentions ; and I 
think it impossible without a speedy assistance from 
home.
I have begun a long letter on our wretched 
situation and its causes, but I have not now time to 
finish it.
You shall have it with the next vessel ; 
and then I hope I shall have the pleasure of writing 
to you with greater satisfaction.
Present my respects to Lady Rockingham.
I hope 
I need not apologize for my bad English, but am 
assured that you, as a friend, will always excuse my 
errors.
I am always, Sir, your sincere Friend, 
Ad. Afzelius.
50 
Mr. D avail to J.
E. Smith.
My very dear Friend, Orbe, Jan. 11, 1793.
I have had the very great pleasure of receiving 
your two last kind letters, which have done me more 
good than any article of the materia medica; I was, 
if possible, more impatient than I commonly am to 
have some news of you.
I have been prevented 
writing to you by an unexpected and very sudden 
event.
In rising from table one day after dinner, 
the eldest of my aunts, aged 84 years and 3 months, 
in all appearance in better health than myself (the 
son of a sister 20 years younger than her), fell after 
having half crossed the room, exactly as if struck 
by lightning, and from that moment never uttered 
one word.
Her last conversation was as gay as you 
can imagine ; and the evening hefore she had played 
at quadrille as usual.
By-the-by, such is their eter- 
nal habit of cards, that we have had an example 
this autumn of one man dying, his cards in his hands.
Great God !
what a death !
Let me rather break 
my neck down some precipice (if such be thy will) 
endeavouring to obtain some new proof of thy great- 
ness, or in the desire of rendering service to a be- 
loved friend !
The death of my good old aunt, (for a good wo- 
man she was,) and the sad moments that necessarily 
follow such events; the miserable state of my wife's 
health, now near her confinement, and who had been 
affected very seriously in seeing her fall ; some dis- 
order in my own health, &c.
— have carried me on 
till now.
57 
I am very happy, my dearest friend, to find by 
your letter you are so gay, as thence I judge well of 
your health.
I who, as you know, live merely as a 
hermit, have lately found myself at table with Lady 
Spenser, the Duchess of Devonshire, and Lady Dun- 
cannon, giving them the names of some plants they 
had collected : they winter at Pisa.
I mention this 
merely to give you notice, that you may not be sur- 
prised.
I told them I had a friend in England infi- 
nitely better able to assist them than myself.
By- 
the-by, they found me wonderfully clever, because 
they had seen nothing but some blundering obso- 
lete amateurs, and were surprised just as I am when 
I go to England, when I constantly say to myself on 
arriving, " How well these people speak English !" 
were a sailor or a fishwoman the first persons I 
meet.
I shall not touch on politics, as I understand no- 
thing at all of those matters.
I should be very happy 
in seeing the establishment of a virtuous liberty, and 
a state of things free from the abominable effects of 
intrigue and corruption.
But men will never be 
perfect; and I know not whether it were not better 
to remain in a state accompanied with some incon- 
veniences, if not quite intolerable, as they were in 
France, than run the risk of being still worse in 
endeavouring to be better.
As for the French, I 
know not whether they are, as a nation, capable of 
doing such great things : they always run into ex- 
tremes, and overshoot reason.
Perhaps I am nar- 
row-minded ; but I love them not, nor can I ever 
think them capable of solidity : I know there arc 
58 
exceptions.
They will all be heroes, and give rea- 
son, liberty and atheism to the world.
With respect 
to the execution of their wonderful perfections, I 
shall only assure you that many of the peasants in 
Savoy wish them, as I do, in another planet.
They 
dare not, under pain of death, bring us over any sort 
of provisions as formerly; and the liberty they have 
acquired, is that of being obliged to give their hogs, 
corn and chestnuts to these French brethren for 
paper instead of money of better value, which they 
receive here, paying as much for taxes as before, 
under new names, and sending men to be shot at 
who would have cultivated the country.
Miserable 
as they were, many are still more so now.
Totus tuus, 
E. Davall.
The Marchioness of Hockingliam to J.
E. Smith.
Hillingdon House, March 3, 1793.
I am ashamed that I have not much sooner 
thanked Dr. Smith for the seeds from Sumatra and 
Sierra Leone.
These seeds have been some time 
sown, and yet Dr. Smith is but now reaping my ac- 
knowledgements : so strange is human nature, that 
often, even against inclination, it neglects and delays 
the most pleasing occupation of expressing grati- 
tude for favours and attentions that the mind is all 
the while sensible of.
I little thought, five years 
ago, that I could have felt so much concern for the 
death of Mr. Aiton ; but I had not seen him then, 
and only looked upon him as the Kew gardener : 
59 
but the single quarter of an hour that he was with 
me here occasioned an instantaneous conversion.
I 
was quite charmed with the plainness of his man- 
ners, without a grain of that pomposity one might 
have expected ; but on the contrary, quite pleasant 
and communicative in his profession: in short, he 
took my fancy so much that I cannot help feeling 
infinite regret that so great and good a man in his 
line should now be no more.
My Strelitzia is advancing into flower, and an 
odd Amaryllis, that nobody knows any thing about, 
I hope is doing the same ; and much I shall wish 
for a visit from Dr. Smith when they are ready to 
receive company.
I am, with much sincerity, 
Your obedient Servant, 
M. Rockingham.
Mr. Davall to J.
E. Smith.
Orbe, Aug. 16, 1793.
My dearest and best Friend, 
All I can do for you, all I can send you, and ten 
times more, did my health, faculties and circum- 
stances permit, I can never, never consider other- 
wise than as my indispensable duty; — a duty I owe 
you, as in my mind holding the reins of botany, as 
a small return for the great friendship you showed 
me in England, even at a time when I was no other- 
wise known to you than as a man fond of plants, 
and who had undertaken a long and expensive jour- 
ney in search of the Linncsa.
60 
I have often been surprised that with all you do, 
and all you have to do, you can so regularly, so 
amply elucidate every object I send.
My work (if 
my health will at last permit me to get through it) 
will derive every merit it may have from your ge- 
nerous information.
I have moreover the ambition 
to possess in time a rich herbarium, and one more 
correct than any who have plants from the gardens 
of Gottingen, Tubingen, Kursberchtolfgaxen, &c.
&c.
By-the-by, what a terrible number of oides 
have fallen on the fine Austral plants !
I am quite delighted with English Botany.
What 
is above all precious to me, are the maritime plants; 
they are quite new to me.
Amonir all the excellent things in English Bota- 
o CO 
ny, nothing intrigues me more than Galium pusil- 
lum.
The Swiss Galia are by no means clear.
The Orchidea delight me, especially Ophrys Loe- 
seiii and Malaxis paludosa!
as strangers to me.
E. Davall.

bcrchtolfgaxcnsis * P 
Afzelius and Francois are safe returned, thank 
* "I laughed heartily," says Mr. Davall in reply, "at your 
astonishment concerning Kursberchtolfgaxen.
It is a mere ima- 
ginary specimen of German soft names.
If you know some little 
French poems of M.
de Florian, you will find this pretty word in 
his Poulc de Caux." 
61 
God !
and have brought many fine things, though 
not many specimens, because the Sierra Leone cli- 
mate is very damp and inseciiferous .
Their fruit and 
capsules are the most wonderful.
I recollect the 
Swiss Melampyrnm cristatum struck me at Geneva 
as uncommonly beautiful.
Can ours be different?
There I found it in a grove.
Ours is a corn plant?!
You say Galium pusillum intrigues you: if you 
talk thus, Mrs. Davall will become jealous.
Adieu !
God bless you.

Mr. Afzelius to J.
E. Smith.
Freetown, Sierra Leone, 
My dear Friend, Nov. 19, 1794.
I am sorry to be a messenger of bad news ; but 
an event that has taken place so openly cannot be 
concealed; it must be known sooner or later; and as 
I have myself unfortunately been a party concerned 
in the common calamity, I hasten to inform you 
of this melancholy affair.
The 28th of September last the French arrived 
here with a force far superior to what we had to 
oppose them, and they made themselves therefore 
soon masters of the place.
They landed and plun- 
dered all the houses and the store.
They carried 
on board their own vessels what they wanted them- 
selves, and the rest they either broke to pieces, or 
plunged into the sea, or consecrated to the flames.
They killed all the live stock in the colony.
They 
burnt the public buildings and all the houses be- 
62 
longing to white people, as well as the shipping, 
except two vessels, which they took with them; and 
one of these was the long-expected Harpy, our last 
resource, which unfortunately happened to arrive 
some days before the enemy departed.
After they had done us all the mischief they 
wished, after having burnt Bance Island and the 
vessels in that port, and after having taken about ten 
prizes in the Sierra Leone river, they sailed away 
the 13th of October last to the leeward, and left us 
in the most wretched situation, without provision 
to live on, without any rag to put on our backs, 
and without comfortable habitations.
But we were 
happy that they did not murder us every one, and 
that they left the huts of the settlers untouched.
(There were only two persons killed, and three or 
four wounded, which happened the first day during 
the attack.) We suffered very much the first week ; 
but after our friends in the neighbourhood had sent 
us some supply, and our settlers, — who have farms 
in the country, or rather in the woods, where the 
French did not dare to penetrate, — had brought us 
theirs, we have been pretty well off for provision, 
and there is at present not the least danger of starv- 
ing.
But we are in want of so many other neces- 
saries and conveniences of life, that we are in real 
distress, till any vessel arrives from Europe and 
brings us some relief.
I, for my part, am particularly 
unhappy, as being deprived of my activity, and not 
knowing what to do; for I have lost all my tools 
and implements for writing and making collections : 
I should otherwise soon make up some of my losses, 
63 
as descriptions, dry plants, insects, shells, animals 
both stuffed and in spirits, &c.
&c, the whole of 
which amounted to larger collections than I ever 
had at once in this country before; but the loss of 
some of my manuscripts, and particularly my jour- 
nal, which I had kept from my arrival here to the 
present time, is irreparable ; and if I should value 
all my losses, I could not make them less than 1 500/.
or 1600/.
; though manuscripts, particularly when 
they are intended for publication, are invaluable, 
and may be worth double the sum you first thought 
of.
I am in very little hopes that the Directors will 
repay me anything; and if they do, it will be a pal- 
try sum I know.
I must therefore rely upon my 
own exertions and the assistance of my friends, till 
I may be able to acknowledge their kindness.
The 
present time is the worst, and before any vessel can 
arrive, which I hope will supply me again with all 
necessary articles ; in the mean time I must be pa- 
tient, and do as well as I can.
When you see the Marchioness of Rockingham, 
I wish you would tell her something of my distress, 
if you think proper.
After having told you that I 
am now reduced quite to a beggar, I do not need to 
apologize for my scrawl and bad paper : I am glad 
to have any thing to write with and upon.
I am yours, affectionately, 
Ad. Afzelius.
P. S.
Just this moment, when I was going to seal 
up the letter, arrives a chartered ship, the Achilles 
of Liverpool, Captain Hogg, after seven weeks' pas- 
64 
sage, and brings the agreeable intelligence that both 
the Ocean and the Amy were safe arrived; and thus 
I hope you got long ago what was intended for you.
The Achilles brings only salt and crockery ware ; 
instead of which I wish her cargo had been provi- 
sion, cloth, linen, furniture, &c.
&c.

Smith to Mr. Davall.
Norwich, March 1G, 1795.
It is so long since I heard from you or wrote 
to you, my excellent friend, that I can refrain no 
longer.
I have nothing botanical to communicate, nor 
indeed anything pleasant, except (as I hope) expres- 
sions of my unceasing regard may be acceptable.
I 
have lately had the misfortune to lose my most in- 
dulgent and excellent father.
There never was a 
more honest, sensible, or judicious man, nor a more 
excellent parent*.
I have another melancholy piece of news, which 
has made a very deep impression on my mind, 
* The annexed lines are expressive of Sir James's feelings of 
respect and attachment upon the loss here recorded.
Dear tender Father !
if thy honour'd shade 
Still hovers o'er thy children, hless our tears !
May every pang, by which our hearts now own thee, 
Impress thy virtues and thy precepts there !
Be thou our guardian angel, while we strive, 
Though not with equal steps, to follow thee ; 
And may thy spirit welcome us to peace.

though now my thoughts are taken up otherwise.
Poor Francois is no more !
He had a good jour- 
ney with Dr. Sibthorp as far as Athens, and they 
were much satisfied with each other *.
I shall dedicate a genus to him, as a martyr to 
botany, and try to do justice to his merits in the 
New Holland Botany very soon.
I know you will 
lament his unfortunate fate ; it is consolatory to 
hear how much everybody esteemed him.
It is a 
severe loss to me, for he was truly good and amia- 
ble, as well as intelligent.
I think he had more 
acuteness in finding out specific differences of plants 
than anybody I ever knew.
Poor Afzelius has lost all his MSS.
and collec- 
tions by the descent of the French savages at Sierra 
Leone; but happily he is alive and well.
His friends 
of his family are deposited, appears the following inscription to 
their memory, from the same hand : — 
Tears for the dead unprofitably flow, 
Their virtues yet a richer tribute claim ; 
Let emulation sanctify our woe, 
And raise a living trophy to their name.
Hither may still each kindred mind retire, 
If boisterous passions urge, or vice allure, 
Muse o'er these sacred relics, and aspire 
To keep their bosoms pure, as these were pure.
That when to these their mouldering dust may come, 
O'er their cold urn may fall the filial tear, 
Still fond remembrance dwell upon their tomb, 
And virtue find a fair example here.

Pray write to me, and believe me ever 
Yours,

Mr. D avail to J.
E. Smith.
Orbe, April 13, 1795.
The sight of your hand-writing yesterday evening 
gave me such pleasure as I could never express, and 
at the same moment the black seal occasioned great 
anxiety.
Believe me, my dearest and most excellent friend, 
I grieve with you sincerely on the cruel separation 
you have experienced, and the more so by reason of 
the interesting qualities of the good father you have 
lost.
From the course of nature we cannot avoid 
these trials, and in my opinion one of our best com- 
forts is the happy reflection he was a good and up- 
right man.
I love you more than ever, as you have 
done justice to my cordial affection to you by the 
detail of your sad communication.
Mrs. Davall and I hardly pass a day without talk- 
ing of you.
She was scarcely less affected than my- 
self at your account of the loss of poor Francois.
It had been a favourite hope of mine to know 
him at last decidedly attached to and fixed with you, 
well conceiving how important his aid would be.
I 
should not thus renew your regret, but Francois, 
— his gentleness, his intelligent eye, his pleasing 
air, — you — all that is yours — every moment I have 
spent with you, — is as present to me, and will be 
07 
while I live, as if there were no intermediate occur- 
rence whatever.
I am delighted with your dedi- 
cating a genus to that excellent and unfortunate 
young man.
I am extremely impatient to have some fresh 
news of you : your health, all that regards you, is 
to me more interesting than anything else.
Not 
one day passes without thoughts of you, — remem- 
brance, regret !
— such as diminishes my share of 
happiness.
This very morning, taking a turn in 
my little garden, quite in ecstasy at the sight of four 
or five delightful stems of Saocifraga mutata in full 
lustre, I exclaimed quite loud, "Why is he not 
here ?
— at least the greater part of the seed shall go 
to him ; he will admire plants, offspring of these ; 
though not with me, he will not see them without 
thoughts of his most cordially devoted friend." 
I really languish to see the continuation of En- 
glish Botany.
May Heaven's best care attend you !
E. Davall.
In a letter dated 1795, noticed at the beginning 
of this correspondence, Mr. Davall says, "I too 
often found the want of a present friend.
It was 
decreed," he continues, " that in this very place 
there was a person of the best merit, whom I had 
long known, and whose sentiments in most respects 
agreed with my own.
We were married.
Provi- 
dence placed her by my side, and to her I owe all 
the domestic happiness I have enjoyed ; and al- 
though I did not escape censure, I had learnt long 
f 2 
68 
since that the criticism of certain persons is praise.
I arn sure you are my friend.
I know you have a 
heart open to sympathy.
It is to you alone I can 
mention these circumstances, and alleviate no incon- 
siderable degree of pain to my mind.
I have a fine 
little boy, who on the 25th of March will be two 
years old : he has a sister, now near the age of six 
months, who promises health and strength.
You 
cannot conceive what anxiety I feel when I reflect 
that these interesting objects of my attachment are 
strangers on the earth, strangers in the country of 
their birth, and in the native land of their father ; — 
how, with all the pleasure I experience from the 
gradual progress of my boy, 1 regret that his first 
ideas are not expressed in English.
Hitherto it is 
in vain that I speak to him almost every day of his 
father's best friend.
He will answer me with un- 
common feeling, Je Valine bien ton bon ami, papa, 
ou est il?
«/<?
voudrois bien le voir Mr. Smif.
It is 
always Smif; and perhaps I shall never hear him 
say Smith.
" When I look forward I am lost in sadness ; the 
desolation of the times in which we live is fit also 
to inspire melancholy.
It should seem (I wish I 
may be in error) that England is running headlong 
to her ruin.
Almost all I have is in the English 
funds, and I am not quite easy on that head.
This 
country, as every other, is so affected by these dis- 
astrous wars, that the price of every necessary of 
life is doubled, and moreover we have almost to 
fear a famine.
" Our bread is much inferior to what it is in less 
69 
miserable times, and it has become necessary to 
husband the corn, to forbid all bakers to admit to 
their ovens every kind of delicacy made of flour.
"The armies on the Rhine ?
and the cold procure 
us frequent visits from wolves, — charming com- 
pany !
we have more than usual.
Last night (Ja- 
nuary 24) one was seen in the garden of a country- 
man at Montcheraud, a village very near us ; and 
plenty of their tracks about the Grotto of Mont- 
cheraud, of which you have a view.
There are 
societies of five or six together." 
The next letter has the date of 1798, expressing 
too plainly the progress of disease in his enfeebled 
frame.
Mr. Davall to J.
E. Smith.
Feb. 13, 1798.
For a long time, — a very long time past, I have 
not written to you, because there was no proportion 
between the fullness of my heart, all that I wished 
to say, and the strength I have had for the execu- 
tion.
I have been obliged to comfort myself with 
thinking almost without intermission of you ; but, 
also, for some time past, my dearest and only hope 
has been that of meeting my friend in another and 
a better world.
This letter, which did not arrive in England till 
after Mr. Davall's death, was left unfinished.
He 
70 
died on the 26th of September, 1/98?
at the early 
age of thirty-five.
" To him the tenderest sympathies were given !
" 
He resembled the chosen friend of his heart in 
the warmth and devotion of his affections, but had 
less power to resist the ills of life.
Many passages 
in the foregoing letters have disclosed the truth of 
what is here remarked.
It is to show his worth, 
his tenderness, his rare attachment, his devotion to 
science, his love of nature allied so closely with the 
love of God, that so little reserve has been made of 
feelings which, in the writer's opinion, confer upon 
him the highest honour.
Should they by any be 
considered too acute or reprehensible, let it be re- 
membered, " those tender longings which absorbed 
his soul, preyed on his spirits, undermined his 
health," were the sorrows of a banished man.
Let 
those who can command both pleasure and society 
at will, contemplate with deep compassion the ge- 
nerous, disinterested Davall.

From Mr. Voght *.
My dear Sir, Flotbeck, May 23, 1797.
Often indeed I took up my pen to recall my- 
self to the mind of my most respected master in 
botany, and my philanthropic friend, whom I most 
sincerely love and revere.
Somehow or other I 
as often have been prevented by employments less 
pleasing, but of a more pressing nature.
But today 
I will not be prevented ; I locked the door of a little 
thatched hut on the bank of a rivulet that meanders 
through my meadows ; and amidst the full chorus of 
* Casper Voght, Esq., author of a pamphlet entitled, "Ac- 
count of the Management of the Poor in Hamburgh, since the 
year 1788 ; in a Letter to some Friends of the Poor in Great 
Britain :" printed at Edinburgh in 179.5.
72 
our nightingales, accompanied by the murmur of a 
little rill, I intend to consecrate a few moments to 
one of the best men I ever knew.
— Thanks then, my 
dear friend, for your most magnificent present: they 
are indeed fine and rare plants, unknown on the 
continent, and which will do great credit to my her- 
barium.
Botany is still a study I am very fond of, 
but, like a man who loves an absent mistress, my 
several, perhaps too numerous, avocations prevent 
me from paying so much attention to her as I wish 
to do, and shall do hereafter.
In saying so, I only 
speak of the scientific part of the systematical study 
of botany ; for I am very busy as to the ceconomi- 
cal part.
I try to find out plants for the use of 
men and of cattle, and so improve by culture those 
that are already in use.
You will do me a great 
favour, if among your pursuits you happen to think 
of some plants, the use of which ought to be tried 
ceconomically.
I promise to attend to it, and, if 
you can give me some seed, to send you an exact 
account of the result.
The physiology of plants 
continues likewise to attract our notice ; and I am 
pointing out with M.
Schmeisser apian of experi- 
ments about some causes of the fertility of peculiar 
ground for peculiar plants, along with the influence 
of light, and of water, whose decomposition by an 
unknown cause is certainly an immediate food of 
plants ; and of the different kinds of gases upon 
vegetation.
I arranged for my particular use a herbarium 
pictum in the way of Lord Bute's, which I find very 
convenient.
73 
I am, thank God, well enough, which I ascribe 
particularly to my country life, exercise, and rising 
early in the morning.
I renounced supper long ago.
Thrice in the week I go to town to attend to the di- 
rection of the Institute for the poor, whose number 
since my publication still continues to diminish.
We 
have not above 2500 poor now in Hamburgh, and 
of them, all those that choose to be industrious 
are comfortably situated.
Our method has made 
proselytes amongst our neighbours : at Bern and 
at Copenhagen they are busy in founding an insti- 
tution upon the same plan.
I am called upon in 
the latter place to take an active part, which, to a 
certain degree, my connections with the Danish 
Court does not permit me to decline.
I give some time to chemistry, but the most of 
my leisure is engrossed by farming.
I have now 
500 acres of excellent land, three miles from town 
on the river side, in my hands, which by-and-by 
will be in the state of the richest culture.
I teach 
my neighbours the use of marling, of oxen, and of 
better implements of agriculture.
If they learn 
from me to do as much work, and infinitely better 
done, with one half of the powers employed till 
now ; if they learn to keep half the teams they 
have now, and save one half of the seed they anna- 
ally throw into the ground, — then the same ground 
will nourish thrice the number now living upon it, 
and they enjoy comforts of which they have not yet 
an idea.
So, my dear friend, in drawing into the circle of 
my family all that surrounds me, I have not yet 
74 
perceived any regret of having none of my own; 
and it seems even to me that I would lose a great 
number of my old relations, were I to contract a 
more intimate one, that would more narrowly cir- 
cumscribe my attention and my cares.
Yet I know 
very happy marriages.
I am intimate in some such 
fortunate families : I partake of their happiness, 
and believe it truly the most comfortable situation 
in life.
I think you will find the life in Norwich 
more suitable to your taste than the continual hurry 
and bustle in a town like London, where for com- 
municating and increasing knowledge you ought 
to spend a part of the year, and live the remainder 
to yourself and your friends.
Dr. Giesck is gone over to another world, where 
I hope he will not be punished for his plagiarisms 
and hasty productions in this.
The Germans are all mad now about Cryptogamy.
It is vulgar now to pursue any other line in botany, 
and I really expect they will be great in these trifles.
M. Schmeisser and M.
Wattenbach wish to be 
kindly remembered.
As for me, I '11 never cease 
to love you as long as I live.
Vale et fave, 
Ever and sincerely, 
Voght.
From Mrs. Charlotte Smith.
Sir, March 15, 1798.
The friendly politeness with which you honoured 
me when I took the liberty of addressing you al- 
75 
most twelve months since, has made on my mind 
too flattering an impression to allow me to forget, 
that in the letter you then favoured me with, you 
mentioned that in the months of April and May 
you were usually in London.
As I am now settled 
there, permit me to hope that I may be so fortunate 
as to be favoured with your personal acquaintance 
when you this year make your annual visit.
Though 
after along and successless struggle I am compelled 
to leave the country, my passion for plants rather 
increases as the power of gratification diminishes; 
and though I must henceforth, or at least till peace, 
or something equally conclusive, dismisses me to 
the continent, (whither I will go if I have strength 
whenever it is practicable,) botanize on annuals in 
garden pots out at a window, it will be a consider- 
able consolation to have an opportunity of being 
known to the principal of that delightful and sooth- 
ing study ; and who is, as well in science as in be- 
nevolence and cultivation of mind, an acquaintance 
so greatly to be desired.
I have not forgotten (being still compelled to 
write, that my family may live) your hint of intro- 
ducing botany into a novel.
The present rage for 
gigantic and impossible horrors, which I cannot but 
consider as a symptom of morbid and vitiated taste, 
makes me almost doubt whether the simple plea- 
sures afforded by natural objects will not appear 
vapid to the admirers of spectre novels and cavern 
adventures.
However, I have ventured a little of it, 
and have at least a hope that it will not displease 
those whose approbation I most covet.
76 
A domestic occurrence, very much unexpected 
and very unpleasant, has made my heart ache and 
my hand tremble ; but they are used to it, and both 
should by this time know better.
It would be a 
prettiness, though very true, to say that while either 
are in existence it is a pleasure to say how much 
I am, dear Sir, 
Your obliged Servant, 
Charlotte Smith.
From Mr. Voght.
My dear Sir, Flotbcck, Aug. 11, 1798.
It is a charming description you make of Hafod 
and its owner.
I know of nothing that strikes me 
more, and awakens more pleasant feelings in my 
mind, than thinking of natural beauties enjoyed by 
active benevolence.
Such a good man as your friend 
ought not to want good wine ; and he shall not if I 
can help it.
As to the yellow turnip, I know what 
you mean ; it is the teller turnip, cultivated in the 
driest sands of the Mark Brandenburgh.
It will not 
succeed unless you have such sands.
As for the 
turnip itself, you may along with the hock get a 
barrel of them.
I have a great respect for a man who has planted 
697,000 trees in one year.
On the continent plant- 
ing on a large scale is perfectly unknown, nor are 
there any nurseries for that purpose.
Among many future improvements of agriculture 
in general to which I was so fortunate as to lay the 
77 
foundation there is a nursery of 1,500,000 plants 
begun this spring, which will I hope in a few years 
give the means to plant four fifths of Holstein, 
which after my example will perhaps some years 
hence have diffused the spirit of planting.
Yes, my dear Sir, I have received your valuable 
volume of Tracts relating to natural history, and also 
the pamphlet you sent me by Mr. Clark ; but I will 
be obliged to you for a syllabus of your Botanical 
Lectures.
However distant my present pursuits are 
from the track of this lovely science, I hope sooner 
or later to wander them over again, and would be 
sorry not to be guided by you.
The exercise of 
practical agriculture and the promotion of this use- 
ful knowledge, together with our Poor Institute, 
take up all my leisure.
I shall certainly revisit En- 
gland as soon as Europe shall be restored to peace.
You know, my dear Sir, that you stand foremost 
amongst the friends whom I shall feel myself happy 
to meet again.
Ever your9, 
Voght.
From Professor Williams.
Dear Sir, Oxford, Aug. 1, 1798.
I passed a short time this morning in the Botanic 
Garden with Mrs. Kett*.
At this season of the year 
a botanist is of rare occurrence in Oxford.
It is 
singular on any occasion to meet a lady who is 
really conversant with plants.
I am obliged to you 
* Of Seething Hall, Norfolk.
78 
for affording mc an instance, and introducing me 
to an acquaintance so valuable.
A very hasty visit, 
and under a vertical sun, could give little satisfaction 
to your friends; yet Mrs. Kett has kindly promised 
to supply me with any of my desiderata in her pos°> 
session.
I beg you would assure her I shall have 
much satisfaction in sending to her, as I shall indeed 
to any of your friends, whatever specimens we can 
afford from the collection here.
Your name could 
not but occur to us, and very frequently in our walk ; 
for many reasons, both of private satisfaction and 
of botanical importance, I wish you could have been 
of the party.
I am surrounded by many nameless 
friends, — by many at least of very doubtful charac- 
ters.
You are destroying, I am assured by the 
information of Mrs. Kett, a new and favourite Ver- 
bascum : I shall be glad when you can examine this 
genus, with which I have been lately not a little 
perplexed ; — yet in fixing the Gramina and Mints 
you are better and more laboriously employed.
I am yours faithfully, 
G. Williams.
From Mr. Johnes.
My dear Sir, Hafod, Sept.
2, 1798.
I was very sorry Mr. Gurney # made so short a 
stay, for I was never better pleased with any one 
on so short an acquaintance.
I liked one of his 
daughters very much, but it was all in such a hurry 
I could scarcely speak to all of them.
* The late John Gurney, Esq. of Earlham, Norfolk.
79 
They travelled in proper style, determined to be 
pleased with everything ; the only mode that could 
have made their number any way comfortable.
Have you read Lord Orford's Letters ?
If not, you 
will I am sure have a great treat.
I have but begun 
on them, and am more pleased than with any cor- 
respondence I ever read; it shows an excellent head 
and heart.
They are very witty, and have excellent 
good nonsense, which is one of the most difficult 
things to write.
Mrs. Johnes is not well, but says she shall soon 
recover when her daughter does.
It is a great comfort to me, that as those from 
whom I had a right to expect kindness fall off, I 
find others who make ample amends; and the more 
flattering to self-love, because one hopes it may be 
owing to personal qualities.
Among all, my good 
friend, I can never forget your great kindness and 
affection, "dum memor ipse met dum spiritus hos regit 
artus?
All our kind compliments attend you.
Truly yours, 
Thomas Johnes.
From Sir Joseph Banks.
My dear Doctor, Soho Square, Jan. 6, 1799.
I shall feel myself much flattered if you finally 
determine to dedicate your Flora Anglica {Britan- 
nica) to me.
It is a book much wanted, and one that 
cannot but receive advantage from the hand of the 
possessor of the Linnaean collections ; from your 
80 
hand it will also receive many other advantages of 
various kinds, — enough to make it far surpass all 
its antecessors.
Pray how low was the thermometer with you ?
and on what day was it the lowest ?
I hegan to 
think that the great severity of the frost has been 
in your parts and in Lincolnshire.
On the 2/th, 
my servant Roberts, whom you know, was valuing 
wood in a copse near Tattershall, where he heard 
noises several times repeated, like the loud smack 
of a whip, which proved to be the riving of the 
branches of trees by the intensity of the frost.
I 
do not remember that this phenomenon, though 
common in the North of Europe, has been observed 
since the hard frost, as it is called, of 1739-40, when 
Miller mentions it.
I believe that a combination of 
circumstances are necessary to this phenomenon, 
but intense cold below the 0° of Fahrenheit is cer- 
tainly one of them.
My time has been of late so taken up by the 
Committee of Coinage that I have done little in 
botany.
I regret it the less, as Dryander is em- 
ployed in printing the Catalogue.
Dickson tells me that last market at Covent 
Garden was well supplied, and at reasonable prices, 
— a sign that the frost has done little mischief to 
our market-men.
White brocoli is said to be the 
only plant that has suffered materially.
Pray offer to your wife and mother the best good 
wishes of the season, and for many happy returns ; 
and believe me very faithfully yours, 
Joseph Banks.
81 
From the Bishop of Winchester.
Sir, Farnham, Oct. 29, 1799.
Mr. Poulter has sent me your letter to him, and 
I inclose one to you from him.
I am so persuaded 
that the fructification of the Cycas (revolt, ta as we 
suppose) is new in England, and probably in Europe, 
that I desired Mr. Poulter to write to you upon the 
subject, and also requested Mr. Brander to do the 
same.
I dare not aim at a description in proper terms, 
being rather an amateur than professor in botany, 
but I will relate what I know and have observed.
When I came to Farnham about the beginning 
of September, my gardener told me the Cycas had 
borne a singular appearance during the summer.
As 
I did not see it earlier, I cannot speak of the flower ; 
but on examining it I found a fine large strobilus 
formed upon the head of the plant, within the circle 
of the external leaves.
The leaves of the strobilus 
itself were of a greenish gray colour, thick, pulpy, 
and beautifully laciniated : the strobilus hollow like 
a bird's nest, and filled with a quantity of drupa 
(then green), about the size of a half-grown apricot, 
or large green almond ; leaves growing mixed among 
the fruit.
The only changes which the plant has 
since undergone, are, that at each point of the laci- 
niated leaves there is a strong spine come forth, pro- 
bably to guard the fruit ; and the fruit itself, now 
probably ripe or nearly so, as the kernel is com- 
pletely formed, is become of a very fine reddish 
VOL.
II.
g 
82 
orange colour, and covered with a fine gray down, 
and is very picturesque and handsome.
I have cut 
open one of these drupes, the half of which Mr.
Poulter has sent to you, but it is now so much faded 
as to give a very imperfect idea of the fruit upon 
the plant.
I shall have great pleasure in sending you two or 
three specimens of the fruit ; but I should be much 
happier if I could have the pleasure of seeing you 
here, where I have beds for you and any one you 
may desire to bring to describe or paint the plant.
The painting alluded to by Mr. Poulter is now 
taking by one of my daughters ; hereafter I shall 
hope to show it you.
She is painting the fructifi- 
cation, that is, fruit and leaves of the strobilus, of 
the natural size, which is all that appears to be now 
necessary, for the external leaves are permanently 
the same ; and this indeed is all that I conceive to 
be possible, for the circumference of the whole 
plant is much too large for any paper.
If you should not be able to give me your com- 
pany, be so good as to let me know what you think 
can be best done for the information of the Linnaean 
Society or yourself; for it seems worthy their notice, 
as the whole which Linnaeus says on the genus 
Cycas is, " De hujus charactere nihil etiamnum ab 
auctoribus traditum reperi." If you wish to send 
down any painter who will paint it at a reasonable 
price, (I say from five to ten or twelve guineas, or 
thereabouts, as I know not what painters of that 
branch usually charge,) I shall willingly be at the 
expense of it, and give a copy to the Society : but I 
83 
am in hopes the painting of my (laughter promises 
to be very accurate.
I am, with great respect, Sir, 
Your faithful Servant, 
B. Winchester.
From Mr. Brodie.
Dear Sir, March 31, 1801.
Believe me, I shall always feel much pleasure in 
exerting myself to gratify your wishes, or those of 
any friend in whom you take an interest.
My poor 
girl had the same desire, — that of rearing all sorts 
of birds from the egg ; and succeeded with a great 
many, but was always baffled in the Ptarmigan, from 
the distance ; for notwithstanding every precaution 
in packing, and their being carried by a man hired 
on purpose, swung in his hand, they were always 
addled.
I would recommend their being sent by 
sea, for many reasons, — a principal one, that there 
is no mail-coach at present beyond Aberdeen.
As to the Black Game, they are become so scarce 
in Scotland that I am at a loss even how to advise 
you in procuring them.
I remember in the year 
1770, when I resided about ten miles immediately 
to the westward of Morpeth in Northumberland, 
they were in immense flocks on an estate in the 
neighbourhood, belonging to (I think) Greenwich 
Hospital, having been part of the Derwent Water 
estate.
Perhaps this hint may be of service.
The

cock is a most beautiful bird, and becomes easily 
familiar.
With the highest respect and esteem, 
I remain, dear Sir, most faithfully yours, 
James Brodie.
From the Rev. Charles Abbot.
Dear Sir, Bedford, Feb. 15, 1802.
The receipt of the last number of English Botany 
gave me a melancholy pleasure in retracing the hap- 
piness I enjoyed in a botanical acquaintance with 
the late Lady John Russell *; and whilst I thank 
you for your punctual observance of my request, in 
giving her ladyship's name to the Rosa tomentosa, 
permit me to say that no one, in my own personal 
knowledge, ever so well merited a posthumous at- 
tention of this sort.
Her virtues do not sleep with 
her in the grave, for they are registered in the hearts 
of all who knew her, and her unexampled worth : 
Her noblest mausoleum is erected in the hearts of 
a grateful poor, who have lost their best friend.
Lord John is not now in Bedfordshire, or this let- 
ter would not go unfranked ; but I have long wished 
for your opinion on the subject oiPyrusAria, which 
I expected to see figured in English Botany before 
now.
The last fructification I sent you was most un- 
doubtedly right, or the plant in my Flora is wrong : 
be it what it will, it certainly grows wild here.
I remain, dear Sir, yours very faithfully, 
Charles Abbot.
* First wife of the present Duke of Bedford, and mother of 
the Marquis of Tavistock and of Lord John Russell.

From Dr. Francis Buchanan.
My dear Smith, Bassaria, March 3, 1805.
I was favoured a few days ago with yours of the 
17th of May, 1801.
During a great part of the 
years 1800 and 1801, I was employed by the Go- 
vernor-general in investigating the state of agricul- 
ture, commerce, and arts, in the dominions of the 
late Tippoo sultaun.
I had just returned to Calcutta 
w T ith a considerable collection, and had commenced 
to arrange my papers, when I received an order to 
proceed to Patna, and join the resident going to 
the court of Nepal.
I am now busy in digesting 
the journal of my proceedings during the trip to 
Mysoor.
Nepal is a country extending south from the snowy 
mountains called Himaleh bv Major Rennell, 
but Emodu Ghiry in the Sanscrit, and no doubt 
the Emodus of the ancients.
Its southern boun- 
dary is the territory belonging to the English, so 
that its breadth from north to south is not great; 
but on the west it includes what Rennell calls Al- 
morah, and on the east what he calls Morung.
About sixty years ago this great extent of country 
was subject to a number of petty chiefs, who all 
soon after were subdued by Pritty Narain, rajah 
of Gorka.
Dissensions have lately broken out in 
this ill-united kingdom and turbulent unprincipled 
people ; and the principal persons of the reigning 
family have been obliged to take shelter in the Com- 
pany's dominions.
Although cruelly afraid of Eu- 
86 
ropean interference, all parties among them, dis- 
trustful of each other and terrified at the thoughts 
of the return of the exiles, have wished for an 
English resident to preserve the peace.
Captain 
Knox has been appointed for this office, and I go 
as his surgeon.
I have a painter with me, and all 
requisites for making a collection.
We have just 
entered the dominions of Nepal, but are still in the 
country below the mountains.
We however expect 
in a few days to ascend the lower range that ele- 
vates Catmandu the capital, high above Hindustan.
From its appearance, this ridge will be about four 
or five thousand feet high, and I expect to meet 
with little else but plants resembling those of Eu- 
rope.
Even here I find many common European 
plants, such as the Anagallis arvensis, Ervum hir- 
sutum, Sonchus palastris, Fumaria officinalis, Sa- 
ponaria ; and the common produce of the country 
is wheat, barley, mustard, and flax.
The Cannabis 
sativus grows here wild.
We have had a fine view of the snowy Emodus, 
and got several good altitudes of it, from which, if 
its latitude is not greatly erroneous, it must be con- 
siderably above five miles in perpendicular height 
above the level of Bahar.
Two very badly stuffed skins have been presented 
to Captain Knox from these mountains : from the 
horns and teeth there is no doubt of their being 
two species of wild sheep.
The one is about the 
size of the Argali, and may be that animal, but it 
has hair exactly like the musk deer : this hair, 
although soft, is analogous to the prickles of the 
87 
hedgehog, as it is hollow and inserted by an acute 
root.
I should be triad to know if this be the case 
with the Ovis or Capra Amnion.
The other may 
perhaps be the Capra caucasia.
The length of 
my stay in Nepal is very uncertain.
Whenever I 
am able, I intend returning to England, and shall 
have amusement enough for my old age in putting 
my papers into some order.
At present I write my 
descriptions at full length, but I intend afterwards 
to make out a F/ora Indica with short characters 
of the species, as much as possible resembling those 
Jussieu gives of genera as I am able.
In Mysoor I found another species of the Vatica, 
and plenty of the Materia, which is one of the most 
ornamental trees I have ever seen.
The Dim Bunga 
may be a Sonneratia, but this must be determined 
by the fruit.
The unripe fruit did not seem in- 
clined to become pulpy, but rather to be capsular : 
at any rate it is quite different from the Sonneratia 
acida, with which I am as well acquainted as with 
oats.
The plants I proposed calling Hopea are found 
in the woods of Chittagong and Tippera.
Two of 
them produce an oil of turpentine, or at least one 
analogous to it, and which is called wood-oil by the 
English of Bengal.
The two last species are valu- 
able timber trees.
Roxburgh has since called another genus after 
Hope : its fruit is the same almost exactly with 
that I have now mentioned, but the stamina are 
definite.
He found one species in a garden at 
Calcutta with ten filaments, alternately simple and 
88 
bifid ; the anthers are therefore fifteen.
I found 
another in Malabar, where it is called iron-wood : 
it has ten simple filaments and ten anthers.
The Eugenias are worse than the Willows or 
Roses of Europe, especially those that resemble the 
Myrtus Cwmni, which Roxburgh makes an Euge- 
nia.
I am sick at the sight of one of them.
I am 
still sicker of the Co??yzas, of which in this very 
camp I have been obliged to describe eight, all as 
difficult to define as any Eugenia in the world.
It is fortunate that Sibthorp's materials fell into 
your hands.
I promise myself great pleasure in look- 
ing over my old friends the Lichens and Mosses, 
with the assistance of your Flora Britannic a.
They 
are the only resource for a botanist in the bleak 
hills among which I intend to pass my old days.
Yours very truly, 
Francis Buchanan.
I have left a number of drawings and descriptions 
of fishes with my good friend Mr. Fleming, Presi- 
dent of our Medical Board, a very great encourager 
and promoter of natural history.
You will find him 
a frank, pleasant, and learned man, with a greater 
knowledge of man and manners than usual.
From the Rev. Thomas Talbot.
My dear Sir, Paris, 23 Pluviose, l'an 10 (1S02).
Soon after my arrival, I delivered your letters to 
Mr. Thouin and Mr. Millin ; the former is ex- 
89 
treniely well, and was very happy at hearing from 
you.
My time has been so much occupied, and the 
Jardin des Plantes at such a distance, that I have 
not yet had time to make him a second visit.
Mr. Millin has been so polite as to invite me to 
the evening meetings at his house every septidie of 
the decade, which I find extremely interesting and 
pleasant.
The evening I spent there we had per- 
haps thirty people, — several foreigners, but no En- 
glishman but myself.
We have the good fortune 
to be extremely well situated in the Place du Ca- 
rousel, or what was formerly St. Wicaise, one side 
of which has been pulled down, with all the old 
houses that encumbered the Carousel ; and the 
square is now completed, and a most magnificent 
thing it is.
We are directly opposite the Thuille- 
ries, and St. Mark's Horses are placed just before 
our windows.
We have seen, or rather looked at, 
most of the curiosities of Paris.
It would be im- 
possible to attempt giving you any thing like a 
description of what is to be seen among the sta- 
tues and pictures of the Louvre.
To you it is only 
necessary to mention, that among two hundred of 
the choicest models of statuary, are to be reckoned 
the Apollo Belvedere, the Torso, the Antinoiis of 
the Capitol, the Laocoon, the Venus, the Juno, the 
Bacchus of the Capitol, the Gladiator moriens, the 
delicious Venus sortant du Bain, the Cupid and 
Psyche, and many little if at all inferior.
Among the pictures which the Louvre Gallery 
(1500 feet long) will not contain, are the Transfi- 
guration, and other of the greatest works of Ra- 
90 
phael ; Communion of St. Jerome, Martyrdom of 
St. Agnes, &c.
by Domenichino; Vicrge duRosaire 
by the same ; St. Jerome by Correggio, — the first 
and last esteemed the masterpiece of those two 
painters : la Mere de Pitie, the chef d'eeuvre of 
Guido, that of Titian, of Tintoret, of Rubens, the 
Descent from the Cross (for which the inhabitants 
of Antwerp offered 40,000/.), Vandyk's Dead Christ, 
la Femme Hydropiquc of Gerard Douw, Poussin's 
Deluge ; &c.
The collection is particularly rich in 
Guidos.
There are perhaps forty Guidos, and cer- 
tainly not so few as a hundred pictures of Rubens ; 
every church in the Low Countries being pillaged.
Any attempt to express what one feels on entering 
this extraordinary place would be absurd ; I felt 
all the time quite bewildered with wonder and de- 
light.
We have received great civility from Mr.
Jackson, and have lately been introduced to some 
Russian ladies, — the Princess Galitzin and her sis- 
ters, who are most delightfully pleasant people.
You shall hear all our motions ; and with our 
united regards to yourself and Mrs. Smith, 
Believe me, ever yours, 
Thomas Talbot.

My dear Sir, Paris, 19 Ventose, 1802.
It is really almost setting about an impossible 
task to give you an account of what is now to be 
seen in Paris which did not exist when you were 
91 
acquainted with it ; though at the same time it must 
be confessed that in many points it has experienced 
a change much for the worse.
The churches, 
stript of their pictures, their fine altars, and rich 
marbles, — which have, since the last Revolution has 
restored tranquillity to France, been replaced in a 
manner calculated only to make the loss of the 
originals more conspicuous.
The church of the 
Invalideshas suffered nothing, and is now converted 
into a temple of Mars, and filled with the trophies 
of the present war.
The body and tomb of Tu- 
renne have been brought there.
St. Genevieve, 
now the Pantheon, intended as a burial-place for 
illustrious characters, is getting very forward under 
the original design, and will, when completed, be 
a magnificent national monument.
Voltaire and 
Rousseau are already removed there.
The Museum of Ancient Monuments is wonder- 
fully curious and interesting : they are placed in 
the late convent of the Petits Augustins, which is 
somewhat too small for their reception ; it is at 
present unfinished.
All the monuments from St.
Denis, and indeed throughout France, have been 
brought to enrich the collection : those of Riche- 
lieu, of Mazarine, of Abelard and Heloise from the 
Paraclete, Anne de Montmorency, Diane de Poi- 
tiers, &c, most of which are arranged in large halls 
appropriated to each century, beginning with the 
eleventh.
The catalogue is rather too large to send 
you.
The library, which the Government proposes to 
transport to the Louvre (at present inhabited by 
92 
artists, who areto be removed, — the professors to the 
Eglise de Quatre Nations, and the students to the 
Sorbonne), is beyond measure rieh in manuscripts, 
(the gleanings of Italy,) in the complete collection 
of engravings, and the printed books composed of 
an assemblage of all the best libraries belonging to 
the Sorbonne and other public institutions, inde- 
pendent of the original collection.
The medallions, 
as well as other objects of antiquity, and above all, 
the gems of the Cabinet de l'Antiquite, are match- 
less ; the latter, for their immense number and ex- 
traordinary beauty and perfection, are far superior 
to any conception I could have formed.
We have 
lately seen the Gobelins, which is exceedingly im- 
proved of late years : when you see the tapestry 
placed by the side of the pictures, it is almost im- 
possible to tell the one from the other.
We very happily had taken a pretty wide range 
in seeing the curiosities of Paris, before we found 
ourselves immersed in engagements as we are at 
present ; so that we have had an opportunity of 
enjoying these different modes of amusement both 
in perfection ; and great as has been the pleasure 
we have received from the one, yet I hardly know 
whether it is not equally as much enjoyment that 
we derive from the other.
After a time, however 
we may be surrounded by interesting objects, yet it 
must be from agreeable and rational society that we 
are to look for the pleasure of so long a visit as 
this of ours ; and we have been happy enough to 
find it.
The state of society here is of course ma- 
terially changed since the Revolution.
The people 
93 
who keep the best houses, and receive in the most 
showy style, are for the most part the bankers, and 
those whose fortunes have risen since that period.
Those of the old regime who remain here, are for 
the most part so reduced in fortune as to be un- 
able to receive anybody in their houses ; but we 
see the greater part of them among those with 
whom we visit, and have begun to get a footing 
among some of those who still see company.
But 
the persons whom we chiefly spend our time 
amongst, and who actually seem to be the only set 
in Paris that understand real hospitality and plea- 
sant living, are the Russians, with whom I believe I 
mentioned to you that we had formed an acquaint- 
ance, and are now perfectly naturalized.
Every 
one of their houses is open every night ; and at 
some or other of them we are certain, if they are 
going to no ball or regular party, to meet with 
those who have something besides stars, ribbons, 
and titles to recommend them ; namely, good edu- 
cation, good breeding, and good sense.
We con- 
trive to fill up every evening with engagements to 
parties, after going to some of the spectacles, 
which we do most evenings, with a most charming 
woman, the Princess Galitzin, whose beauty, whose 
manners, and whose character I feel myself un- 
equal to describe.
We have been at a great many 
very fine and elegant balls, particularly one at the 
Comtesse de Gerebtzoff's, who with the Princess 
were the first of our acquaintance, and have been 
infinitely kind in pushing us forward.
Three nights 
ago we were at an exceedingly elegant entertain- 
94 
ment at the Princess Hohenzollern's, and last night 
at her sister's the Princess of Courland, who is a 
most beautiful and pleasing woman.
Her parties, 
which are the finest and the most select, as well as 
the most easy and pleasant things going forward 
here, occur every octodie of the decade : we have 
a general invitation to them, and to her house at 
all times ; and every morning when the weather is 
good we assemble there to breakfast, and ride on 
horseback to the Bois de Boulogne.
Prince Hohenzollern and Mr. Dernidoff furnish 
horses ; and Fanny* is in such request as a horse- 
woman that she generally has the choice of the 
stables.
Tonight Fanny means to keep back for 
a ball ; and tomorrrow at Mrs. Lemaistre's, an En- 
glish lady to whom Lord Henry Petty has intro- 
duced us.
I intend going to the bal masque at the 
opera, which commences about one in the morning, 
and finishes about six or seven ; indeed the Pari- 
sian hours are very terrible.
We never break up 
at Madame de Courland 1 s before five, and at most 
other parties three or four.
The carnival has afforded us great amusement : 
it was the first regularly observed here since the 
Revolution, and, as you may suppose, not wanting 
in gaiety.
I was presented to the First Consul by our Mi- 
nister at the audience on Saturday.
His manners 
are extremely mild and interesting : he talked a 
great deal to us, and paid many compliments to the 
English nation.
* Mr. Talbot's sister, now Countess of Morley.
95 
I have been this morning with a Pole, who knows 
a great deal of pictures, to see an immense salon, 
opened yesterday at the Louvre, filled with the 
choicest morceaux of the whole collection, of which 
the small appendix to the catalogue gives you an 
account.
We see a good deal of an extremely pleasant 
Italian family, whose name is Gallo.
The Marquis 
de Gallo is ambassador here from Naples, and his 
wife a very accomplished woman.
We have been 
introduced to Lady Mount Cashel, who called on 
us yesterday and invited us to a ball, the 1st Ger- 
minal.
We dined yesterday with the Rohans at 
the Bagatelle, and passed the soiree with the Ho- 
henzollerns, and have abundance of balls in view for 
next week ; one of which is to be given by Derni- 
doflf, the richest man in the Russian empire, and 
who prides himself a little on his magnificence, 
such as wearing a diamond of 19 carats for a shirt- 
pin, &c, and is intended merely to astonish the 
people here.
His house and his wife's which ad- 
joins it, and both of which are very immense and 
fine, are to be laid open for the night.
Adieu!
You 
will think our heads run only on dissipation.
T. Talbot.
From Sir Thomas Frankland.
My dear Sir, Chichester, April 25, 1802.
As you probably know the sad event of my en- 
deavours last autumn, I shall only say that I am in 
96 
good health, supported by hope of re-union with 
those whom I most loved, in a happier state !
Our plans are to pass the summer at Brighton : 
no place is so agreeable to me as my own home, 
where I have been seventeen years collecting sources 
of pleasure, though it docs not seem to be the will 
of God that I should enjoy it.
Soon after my arri- 
val here I was informed that two of the Duke of 
Richmond's horses had been poisoned by some 
plant in their pasture.
I remembered the (Emu/the 
crocata* by the side of a rivulet in 1782, and pro- 
nounced it to be the evil in question, and was then 
told that the pasture is by the side of this very 
stream.
I have received the last seven numbers of English 
Botany.
I observe a good figure of Conferva rosea 
(a good name): I found it at Worthing in 1782, 
and showed it to Hudson, who thought it his pur- 
purascens.
Thomas Frankland.

Dear Sir, Chichester, June 20, I SOS.
As Parliament will be dissolved in a few days, I 
take the opportunity of writing a few lines by my 
brother's fiat, whom however I purpose to bring in 
again, together with his present colleague.
I received your kind letter, and here conclude my 
* Hemlock, — Water Dropwort.
See English Botany, fig.
2313 ; not the Common Hemlock, Conium maculatum.
97 
account of the CEjianthe crocata.
which I have now 
convicted of poisoning two mares in foal belonging 
to the Duke of Richmond last November.
I have 
viewed the field in company with the gardener and 
groom, who found one mare dead and the other 
dying.
The stream (Lavant), which bounds one side 
of the field for a considerable length, was quite dry, 
and I was shown one plant of which the mares had 
evidently dug up the roots with their hoofs.
Their 
stomachs were full of a white substance like saw- 
dust, agreeing exactly with what we observed on 
examining the roots this year, which were inter- 
mixed with those of last season in decay.
The bank 
of the stream was abundantly full of the plant, and 
more decisive evidence of murder could not be pro- 
nounced against it.
A few days ago I observed a 
horse in a ditch cropping the tops of the plant, 
which I suppose are comparatively innocent.
The 
brood mares possibly might have depraved appe- 
tites, which induced them to dig up the roots.
Yours, 
Thomas Frankland.

Mrs. Johji Taylor to J.
E. Smith.
My dear Friend, Norwich, May G, 1803.
I should not do justice to my own feelings if I 
omitted to send you a few words, — not to express my 
sense of your kindness, for that is impossible, nor 
yet to tell you I am better, for this you will learn 
without my wasting any paper upon the subject, — 
but to keep up in some way the communication 
which is suspended by your absence.
I have often 
told you that the consciousness of yourself and dear 
Mrs. Smith being within my reach, the recollection 
that I can at any time see you and converse with you, 
forms one of the charms of my existence; and time 
and habit (which are said to lessen our sense of the 
blessings we enjoy) are continually increasing this 
feeling in my mind.
Indeed, what can time and 
habit do, but add to the stores of recollection re- 
h 2 
100 
peated proofs of friendship, or make these proofs 
more necessary and dear to us ?
When you are 
away, I think it right, because those who deserve 
your society in other places should have a portion 
of it, and because you are certainly varying your 
enjoyments, and enlarging the sphere both of your 
usefulness and of your gratification ; besides, when 
you are able to do this, I am easy about your health.
In order to answer the calls made upon you for ex- 
ertion (in London particularly) your best health is 
necessary.
How gladly would I encounter much 
more bodily inconvenience than I have lately en- 
dured, to have my mind free from anxiety concern- 
ing my husband and you !
Indeed I have scarcely 
thought what I felt was an evil, so many interesting 
and pleasing sensations accompanied it, — even those 
speculations upon the uncertain tenure of our mor- 
tal existence, which a weak state of health naturally 
leads to, were wholly unattended on my own account 
with agitation or alarm ; but for those I love, I am 
full of terror and dismay.
Well!
let me indulge the 
pleasing idea that you will meet happily in London, 
congratulate each other upon looking well and feel- 
ing well ; and that, after the time of our separation is 
past, we shall all join and rejoice together, and renew 
our delightful intercourse.
I had another kind visit 
from Mr. Traftord lately, when we talked of you 
particularly, of our little circle in general, of our 
Conversations, and the hope of their renewal.
How many fine things could I say to Mrs. How- 
orth and to Mr. and Mrs. Lane, if I were to indulge 
my own feelings!
and all right, true, and sincere.
I 
shall always think of them with the respect and af- 
J 01 
fection their heads and hearts deserve, and as some 
of my most intimate friends, though we only became 
acquainted last summer.
Notwithstanding my having just filled two sheets 
to the Aikin family, and that I have reached the top 
of my third page to you, I know not how to cease 
talking to you; remember the restriction which has 
been laid upon my tongue, and consider that even 
the pen is a welcome substitute.
Lucy Aikin is 
suffering under the same prohibition, and we have 
some joking upon the subject, — yet I am very serious 
about her.
Her letters contain the sound sense and 
just criticism of a healthy mind, whatever may be 
the state of her body.
Our attention has been much 
drawn to Cowper lately, — hers by the perusal of the 
new edition of his Iliad, and mine by his Life and 
Letters.
Whether his interesting and unhappy ma- 
lady was purely physical, or whether gloomy reading 
and conversation contributed to it, — if I had been his 
biographer, I should have freely expressed my feel- 
ings respecting Calvinism : you and I cannot bear 
such representations of the Father of the whole hu- 
man race*.
That I may engross no more of your 
* This alludes to the doctrine of election and reprobation: yet 
the kindness and christian charity of Sir James's heart cannot be 
more clearly discerned than in his mode of reflecting on certain 
doctrines which he considered injurious to the impartial justice 
of God, and as tending directly to immorality.
— In speaking of 
these he often observed, that the goodness of human nature, which 
they who hold these opinions so much depreciate, overcomes a 
bad system of religion ; and that the alembic of an honest heart and 
sensitive conscience transmutes a poisonous doctrine into whole- 
some food.
102 
valuable time, I will beg His blessing upon you 
wherever you go.
Our children, who have so much 
reason to love you, desire their grateful remem- 
brances : — you will frequently be the subject of our 
conversation, still more frequently of the medita- 
tions of your faithful friend, 
Susannah Taylor.

Monsieur, Londres, Juin 20, 1803.
Je viens de recevoir votre lettre obligeante du 30 
Germinal, accompagnee des deux superbes livres de 
botanique, dont Madame Bonaparte m'a fait l'hon- 
neur d'enrichir ma bibliotheque.
Ayez la bonte, 
Monsieur, d'offrir a cette illustre dame mes plus 
humbles remerciments, et de l'assurer que ces livres 
et leurs suites feront l'ornement de ma collection, 
par leur propre merite, et comme un temoignage de 
son estime.
Je ne manquerai pas, aussitot que les 
circonstances le permetteront, de faire passer a Ma- 
dame Bonaparte quelques temoignages de ma re- 
connaissance, surtout des plantes seches, qui par 
leur rarete ou leur beaute pourront l'interresser, ou 
meme des graines pour son jardin.
J'attendrai avec 
impatience les Numeros suivants du magnifique 
Jardin de Malmaison et de Plantes Liliacees, aussi 
bien que votre ouvrage sur le jardin de mon bon 
ami Cels, que je n'ai pas pu encore me procurer, 
mais que j'ai longtemps desire d'avoir.
J'embrasse 
avec joie cette occasion de pro titer de votre corre- 
103 
spondence, et je serai tres flatte" de vous £tre utile a 
quelque chose.
Peut-etre vous avez vous-meme un 
herbier, et que j'y pourrois aj outer quelques plantes 
nouvelles.
Perniettez moi d'observer que votre 
Melaleuca gnidicB/'olia me paroit ma M.
thymifolia.
Pour ce qui regarde 1' opposition des feuilles de quel- 
ques Met?'osideros, je puis vous assurer que c'est 
notre ami Cavanilles qui a tort.
J'ai donne ordre de faire mention honorable de 
vos publications dans nos journaux, quoique je me 
fais scrupule de n'y rien ecrire moi-meme, afin d'evi- 
ter les disputes literaires.
Croyez moi, Monsieur, 
avec les sentiments de la plus parfaite consideration, 
Votre tres humble et tres obeissant Serviteur,

Monsieur, Paris, Octobre 10, 1803.
J'ai fait connoitre a Madame Bonaparte combien 
vous aviez kXk. sensible a la marque d'estime qu'elle 
vous a donnee, et qui vous etoit due a plusieurs 
titres que votre modestie ne me permet pas d'expo- 
ser.
Elle se fera un plaisir de vous envoyer la suite 
des deux collections ; et elle a recommande devant 
moi a son intendant, s'il ne trouvait pas moyen de 
vous les faire parvenir en le moment, d'en garder le 
depot jusqu'a la premiere occasion favorable.
Elle 
recevra, Monsieur, avec la plus grande reconnois- 
sance les graines que vous voudrez lui envoyer.
Pour ce qui concernc les plantes seches, je vous 
104 
avouerai franchement qu'elles m'etoient destinees ; 
et puisquc vous avez la bonte de m'cn oftrir, il est 
inutile que vous en fassiez deux pacquets : je rece- 
vrois deux fois les meines exemplaires, et je prive- 
rois des effets de votre generosite quelque botaniste 
qui en sentiroit le prix aussi bien que moi.
Je vous 
remercie, Monsieur, de ce cadeau que vous voulez 
bien me faire; vous enriebirez ma collection, et vous 
me mettrez a meme d'eviter des erreurs, ayant sous 
les yeux des objets de comparaison.
Si renvoi pre- 
cieux que vous aviez fait a M.
de Jussieu fut arrive 
avant la publication de ma premiere livraison, je 
n'aurois pas donne le nom de M.
gnidicefolia a la 
plante que vous aviez deja nominee thymifolia: c'est 
un de vos compatriotes, Mr. Kennedy, qui m'induisit 
en erreur, en m'assurant que cette espece etoit par- 
faitement nouvelle : voila une preuve de plus pour 
moi, que l'autorite des cultivateurs n'est pas toujours 
d'un grand poids en botanique.
Je serai tres flatte, Monsieur, de vous faire hom- 
mage dutfardin de Cels: il m'en reste encore quel- 
ques exemplaires de ehoix et sur papier velin.
Vous 
me ferez plaisir de me procurer une occasion favo- 
rable pour vous en faire parvenir un ; j'y joindrai 
les livraisons qui auront paru d'un nouvel ouvrage 
qui fait suite au Jardin de Cels, et qui est du meme 
format : quoique les deux ouvrages ne soient pas 
colori^s, je crois qu'ils pourront etre plus utiles a la 
science que celui de la Malmaison, ou je me trouve 
force de faire entrer des plantes deja publiees.
Ose- 
rois-je, Monsieur, vous exprimer le desir que j'au- 
rois de posseder quelques uns de vos ouvrages, que 
105 
je n'ai jamais pu me procurer chez nos libraires de 
Paris ; savoir, vos Icones pictte, votre Spicilegium, 
et Tracts relating to Natural History.
Soyez assure, Monsieur, que j'apprecie tous les 
avantages que je puis retirer de l'honneur de votre 
correspondence.
Si j'etois assez heureux pourpou- 
voir vous etre ici de quelque utilite, j'en saisirois les 
occasions avec bien de l'empressement.
Agreez,je vous prie, Monsieur, les sentiments de 
la plus haute estime et de la plus parfaite conside- 
ration.

qui ont paru du Choix de Plantes.
J'ai communique votre lettre a Madame Bona- 
parte : elle m'a prie de vous temoigner combien elle 
etoit flattee de l'interet que vous preniez a son jar- 
din.
J'aurois desire quelle m'eut fait remettre les 
fascicules de la Malmaison qui ont ete publies, et 
que vous n'avez pas encore regus, pour les reunir 
a mon envoi ; mais il paroit que le nouvel intendant

Les graines surtout me seront d'une grande utilite.
Les circonstances ont empecbe Madame Bonaparte 
de se pourvoir chez Messrs.
Lee et Kennedy ; et 
les envois de graines et de plantes qu'on lui faisoit, 
ont ete captures par vos compatriotes.
Je prends la liberte" de vous consulter sur un 
Echium que j'ai fait dessiner, et dont je vous ad- 
dresse une feuille avec un epillet.
Cet Echium est 
originaire des Canaries ; je crois bien que c'est la 
giganteum * d'Aiton, mais les strigce ne sont pas 
tres sensibles sur les bractees, et sur les calices ; de 
plus, les nervures des feuilles sont rougeatres.
Monsieur de Jussieu pretend que c'est une es- 
pece nouvelle.
Veuillez bien, Monsieur, me faire 
connoitre votre avis, qui sera pour inoi une deci- 
sion arretee.
Je desirerois aussi savoir si V Echium 
candicans de Jacquin est le meme que celui d' 
Aiton '|\ Messieurs Thouin, Jussieu, Cels, et Des-

teris tuis inseribas, "J.
E.Smith, M.D., President of 
the Linnsean Society, Norwich." 
Sir William East, Bart, to J.
E. Smith.
My dear Sir, Hall Place, July 25, 1804.
Accept my most sincere thanks for your very 
kind remembrance of me, not only by the favour of 
your very flattering letter, but for the present which 
accompanied it, and which I shall always set a high 
value on, as a gift from a person whom I so much 
esteem ; and permit me to say, that as there are few 
days, perhaps hours, of a man's life, that are passed 
with gratification to our feelings, so shall I look 
upon the short time, which you and Mrs. Smith 
favoured this place with your company, amongst 
the number of our pleasantest moments.
But, my 
good Sir, you must not, by the rules of plain deal- 
ing, allow us barely to taste of the agreeable, — you 
are bound in conscience, after having once indulged 
us, to repeat the favour.
May we not then be al- 
lowed to expect, when you find yourself inclined to 
revisit this part of the kingdom, to recollect those 
whom you will make so truly happy, by passing as 
109 
much time with them as you can afford from your 
pursuits in a science the most noble, and the most 
worthy of an enlightened mind.
I should have been 
truly fortunate, if in the younger part of my life I 
had fallen into your line of study; for I perceive 
those who have done so, by their unwearied attach- 
ment, meet with charms which I am absolutely for- 
bidden to enjoy; — and now, alas !
it is too late: the 
imagination is no longer vivid enough at sixty-seven 
to become enthusiastic; and without some degree of 
enthusiasm everything in nature becomes dull and 
torpid.
Is not this true, my dear Sir, whatever the 
philosopher may urge to the contrary ?
I now ex- 
pect, my good friend, you will exclaim — Enthusiasmf 
— what but this passion could reconcile you to a 
red coat at your time of life?
And this charge will 
at first sight appear but too well grounded, more 
especially so when I declare that the military cha- 
racter is the most foreign of all my inclinations; — 
but dread of falling an unarmed victim into the 
hands, probably subjected to the persecution of an in- 
veterate enemy, — with this further incentive, a desire 
natural to an Englishman, to offer, at such a period 
as the present, all that was in his power to offer, to 
his king and his native country, — this led me ij the 
adoption of my scheme for the immediate defence 
of our own neighbourhood.
Had I been a younger 
man, I would have offered at this crisis my services 
in a more extensive way.
Should our threatening 
enemy succeed in landing a powerful force, dreadful 
will be the consequence, let the conflict end which 
way it will : but those unemployed, unengaged in 
110 
the contest, will be treated with unexampled severity; 
and should the enemy prevail, I could not bear the 
thought of seeing those I loved treated with in- 
humanity.
My witnessing such shocking scenes 
could avail them nothing.
How much better then 
is it, if necessary, in trying to defend them and 
yourself to the last, to end your life in the most 
glorious way in defending all that is dear to you ?
— 
What will Mrs. Smith say to my long declamation ?
I think, however, and I beg you will tell her so, 
that an old captain, a soldier at sixty-seven, deserves 
at least, by way of encouragement, the approbation 
of the ladies ; and you may assure her there is but 
one amongst them whose good opinion I should set 
a higher value upon than hers.
Having now intruded upon your patience, it is 
time that I should release you, by assuring you how 
sincerely Lady East and her sister join in every kind 
wish with your faithful friend, 
W. East.

From the Duke of Bedford.
Sir, Woburn Abbey, Nov. 11, 1804.
I have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter 
of the 7th instant, inclosing one for Dr. Abbot on 
the subject of the Salix Riisselliana.
I have de- 
rived much gratification from the distinct and satis- 
factory manner in which you draw the line between 
his Willow and the S.
fragUis of Linnaeus ; not 
merely from the pleasure I feel from everything 
that tends to elucidate the science of botany, but 
because I have a peculiar interest in this Willow, 
from the circumstance of its having been cultivated 
here by one * whose most anxious and warmest 
pursuit was a knowledge and improvement in every 
branch of agriculture, and the consequent benefit 
to the community at large.
It remains for me only 
to return you my best thanks for this obliging com- 
munication of your opinion, and to assure you that 
I am, Sir, 
Your very faithful 
Bedford.
I have lately discovered accidentally, that my 
* His Grace's brotber, Francis Duke of Bedford.
112 
grandfather introduced the same Willow into his 
county forty or fifty years ago, and distributed 
plants of it among his tenants ; which perhaps may 
give it some additional claim to the specific name 
you have been pleased to bestow upon it.
From Mr. Johnes.
My dear Friend, Hafod, Dec. 6, 1804.
I have read Mrs. Barbauld's Introduction to 
Richardson's Letters.
It is most excellent; but 
there is a Mrs. Klopstock who goes to your mar- 
row, for she pierces through the heart.
It is a 
charming collection.
I am very proud you continue to like Froissart, 
and thank you very kindly for your expressions of 
him and me ; for I shall tag myself to the old gentle- 
man's skirts, in hopes he will make me mount to 
fame with him.
I shall go on with Monstrelet, who 
has never had an English coat on ; and probably 
Joinville, by way of intermezzo, and to give time to 
collations of Monstrelet.
Let me know how you 
like this plan, for I am not quite determined as to 
Joinville's Memoirs*.
You are among the few who 
* Mr. Gray, in a letter to the Rev. N.
Nicholls, speaks thus 
of these old historians : — "I rejoice you have met with Froissart : 
he is the Herodotus of a barbarous age.
Had he but had the luck 
of writing in as good a language, he might have been immortal !
His locomotive disposition, (for then there was no other way 
of learning things,) his simple curiosity, his religious credulity, 
were much like those of the old Grecian.
When you have taut 
chevauche as to get to the end of him, there is Monstrelet waits to 
113 
really know me.
I will tell you all about Froissart 
when we meet.
Talk to me of a cart-horse if you 
dare !
Grub-street is a farce to me.
I am hard at 
work ; and you will say .hard at work, when I keep 
two compositors and one pressman fully employed.
I forestalled the puns, or I should have been 
borne down by them.
I have done with you, when 
you condescend to explain them, for a commentary 
on a pun is the devil.
I have a bridge — beautiful, — through the kind- 
ness of Mr. Shepherd, whom you know.

an excellent fellow, with more abilities than one

I want to show you the new walk.
It is superbe, and as yet a nondescript.

Pertenhall, near Kimbolton, Jan. 11, 1806.
Dear Sir, 
I thank you for your letter, though I should have 
been much better pleased, had you scourged rather 
than complimented me.
I was grieved to hear that you had been in a state 
of suffering, and that so much of your precious 
time had been lost to the public.
I shall take the liberty of continuing the dedica- 
tion* to you; for though you have migrated east, 
take you up, and will set you down at Philip de Comines ; but 
previous to all these you should have read Villehardouin and 
Joinville."

and I north-west,' yet I still retain the favourable 
impression that your agreeable manners in general, 
and particular civility to me, made upon me long 
since, and beg still to be considered as your friend.
I am persuaded that we shall never quarrel, how- 
ever we may differ in opinion.
I consider you as 
the Establishment, and only desire toleration so long 
as I am a quiet subject.
Respecting plantar acifolice and ordo acifoliarum, 
I cannot help you.
Drifted might well express 
secundus, but I dare not hazard it, any more than 
you.
I thank you for your hint on propago, which 
I had not attended to.
I have long thought general 
umbel better than universal.
I arn happy you ap- 
prove my distinction between labiate and personate.
Your sanction was wanting to satisfy me entirely.
Downy best expresses tomenlosus : I only hesi- 
tated on account of pappus being down ; but I 
adopt seed-down for that, which I have taken from 
you.
I have no objection to anthera, if you will 
use antheras, and not anthera, in the plural.
I use 
corolla and corollas.
So nectarium sounds better to 
me than nectary; but then it should be nectarhims, 
and not nectaria, in the plural.
My only difficulty 
about the final a is, that ignoramuses will use sta- 
mina in the singular, and stipula in the plural.
But 
why do I torment you with these trifles ?
I hasten 
to the best part of my letter, — my sincere good 
wishes for your health and comfort ; for I am, dear 
Sir, with much regard, 
Yours most faithfully, 
Thomas Martyn.

From Dawson Turner, Esq.* 
Yarmouth, Feb. 5, 180G.
Knowing, my dear Sir, how frequently you heard 
of us by Dr. Rigby, I was willing to put off the 
painful task of writing to you, as long as I could.
A painful one indeed it is, and yet a most sweet one ; 
for without experiencing equal affliction, you can- 
not conceive the sensations of pleasure which the 
affectionate kindness of my friends has occasioned; 
and to you I may say, what I should be sorry to 
say to any other, lest I should be regarded as af- 
fected or foolish, that the reading of your letter 
drew from my eyes the most delightful tears they 
ever shed.
You knew our poor babe, and you always treated 
him with a kindness which his mother and I shall 
never forget so long as we live; for those who were 
kind to him have now the strongest claim upon 
our gratitude.
You know, therefore, what a loss 
we have sustained in being deprived of him, even 
without considering those dreadful circumstances 
attending his death, upon which I cannot at this 
time reflect, without shuddering with horror.
And 
yet in the midst of this calamity, the mercy of Di- 
vine Providence was so striking in the preservation 
of my wife and of my remaining children, that, if 
it do but please the Almighty that their lives should 
be spared, and her health and spirits restored, I feel

son, a most engaging child, who was, unhappily, burnt to death.

that I can in time regard even this visitation in the 
true light which I believe that duty to my Maker 
requires.
I endeavour again to turn my thoughts to bo- 
tany; and though my mind has not yet regained its 
spring, I find in it great amusement and comfort 
when I walk out alone.
I cannot attempt to say, 
my dear friend, how much your expressions of af- 
fection and friendship have moved me : it gives me 
the liveliest pleasure to feel that I have a heart ca- 
pable of valuing them, and I trust in God that you 
will always find me most anxious to strive to merit 
them.
If you see anything amiss in my conduct, 
my disposition, or my temper, I entreat you, by your 
friendship for me, never to let it pass without no- 
tice, and I assure you that you shall find me grate- 
ful.
Conscience indeed speaks, but we learn in 
time to disregard her like Amurath's ring.
The 
words of a friend are much more sure of being at- 
tended to ; and when that friend has such a heart, 
and leads such a life as you do, it is hardly possi- 
ble that they should fail of effect ; at least I would 
fain hope so, for the credit of my nature.
That I 
may, as long as we both live, enjoy and deserve your 
friendship, is, I assure you, one of the most earnest 
wishes of 
Your truly affectionate and obliged friend, 
Dawson Turner.

From Mr. James Lee.
Nursery, Hammersmith, March 11, 1806.
Dear Sir, 
We cannot procure any Fuchsia seed, and Dode- 
catheon does not ripen in England, and it is now 
impossible to send anything to Naples.
We should 
have wrote to you about this before, but at this 
season are so overpowered with business that you 
must excuse me.
You may depend on it that no 
one will be able to make an impression on our 
minds unfavourable to you : we have such high 
esteem for your abilities, such gratitude in store for 
what you have done for science, for the public, and 
for us, that we shall always be willing to defend 
you on all occasions, and at all points.
We are sorry to have to communicate to you the 
death of our dear friend Masson, who died at Mont- 
real in January last.
We lament his fate most sin- 
cerely.
He was hardly dealt by, in being exposed 
to the bitter cold of Canada in the decline of life, 
after twenty-five years services in a hot climate, — 
and all for a pittance.
He has done much for bo- 
tany and science, and deserves to have some lasting 
memorial given of his extreme modesty, good tem- 
per, generosity, and usefulness.
We hope, when 
opportunity serves, you will be his champion *.
I am, dear Sir, &c.

My dear Sir, Calcutta, Nov. 4, 1807.
I was a few days since highly gratified by the 
receipt of your friendly letter of the 12th of last 
April.
It is a pleasure I had hardly promised 
myself; and I will assure you if my writing now and 
then will induce you to spare me sometimes a lei- 
sure hour, to keep up the correspondence thus be- 
gun, I shall on my part often give you a letter, 
high among those who, by encountering personal difficulties and 
hardships with the most indefatigable and disinterested zeal, have 
promoted botanical knowledge, — was born at Aberdeen in Au- 
gust 1741.
"The writer of this," he continues, "well recollects the plea- 
sure which the novel sight of an African Geranium in Yorkshire 
and Norfolk gave him about forty years ago.
Now, evei - y gar- 
ret and cottage window is filled with numerous species of that 
beautiful tribe, and every green-house glows with the innumerable 
bulbous plants and splendid Heaths of the Cape.
For all these 
we are principally indebted to Mr. Masson ; besides a multi- 
tude of rarities, more difficult of preservation or propagation, 
confined to the more curious collections.
" During his stay at the Cape, he entered into correspondence 
with the great Linnaeus.
Having discovered a bulbous plant of 
a new genus, he was not only laudably ambitious of botanical 
commemoration in its name, but he was particularly anxious to 
receive this honour from no less a hand than that of his illus- 
trious and venerable correspondent.
This indeed was the ' uni- 
cum prcemium,' the only reward to which he aspired for all his 
labours.
He obtained the honour to which he aspired.

specimen of Massonia in the herbarium of Linnaeus, named by 
his own trembling hand, near the close of his life, proves that 
the name had his sanction." — Rees's Cyclopaedia.
119 
however little important matter I may have to com- 
municate.
I am quite out of the way just now of 
adding to my collection of drawings, unless I were 
to take my subjects from the botanical garden ; but 
as that would be a species of robbery or encroach- 
ment upon Dr. Roxburgh's province, I must wait 
with patience till my professional duties call me to 
the upper provinces of Hindostan,when I shall hope 
once more to range in the same field I have hi- 
therto found so interesting and productive.
Since my arrival at Calcutta, my attention has 
been more directed to the collecting of insects than 
anything else, and in which I have been very suc- 
cessful ; for I am just now in possession of a very 
splendid assortment, from which I hope some day 
or other to add useful varieties to your cabinet.
I am sorry, my dear Sir, to find you have been less 
successful in the circulation of that beautiful work 
Exotic Botany, than its merits deserve ; and I feel 
it an addition to the disappointment, that every 
number I received from your bounty was swal- 
lowed up by the merciless ocean.
It makes me 
melancholy almost, when I reflect on the valuable 
books and papers I lost on that unlucky event, the 
loss of the Lady Burgess ; and the drawings of in- 
sects which you and Mr.Marsham admired so much, 
unfortunately were with me.
I am very glad Dr. Buchanan preferred leaving 
his collection of dried plants and drawings with 
you.
He set out on his statistical mission about a 
month gone, and the early part of his route is 
through a country little explored, and rich in vege- 
120 
table productions.
His views have met the aid and 
encouragement of Government, and he travels with 
more useful advantages than an individual would 
be likely to obtain without such powerful assist- 
ance.
Mr. Fleming and myself have often indulged in 
conversation about you.
He has a great desire to 
be better known to you ; but how soon he may 
have that opportunity I cannot say.
He is here in 
the full enjoyment of health and all the ease and 
luxury a man can wish for ; consequently he is very 
indifferent about leaving the country.
Dr. Roxburgh arrived here a few weeks since, 
and is as busy as ever.
I have this moment a note 
from him, wherein he says, " I am surrounded and 
in confusion with the various parts of a new palm 
from the Moluccas, which is now in flower." In 
my next I may be able to tell you something about 
this said palm, as I mean to go down to the garden 
in a day or two.
I find the plant which produces that valuable drug 
in the Materia Medica, Columba Root, is at length 
ascertained.
It proves, I believe, to be a species of 
Menispermum, just what I some years ago pre- 
dicted, when I sent Dr. Roxburgh specimens of a 
root bearing close resemblance with Columba Root, 
and used by the natives of Hindostan in the same 
cases you use that plant.
This was also a Meni- 
spermum.
Pray, my dear Sir, make my best respects to 
Mrs. Smith.
How often do I reflect with feelings 
of pleasure on the few happy days I passed in the 
121 
society of your family and friends !
And may I add, 
without being suspected of studied compliment, I 
shall never lose the remembrance of those friendly 
attentions you favoured me with, and the engaging 
manners which made your fireside so desirable.
Be 
assured you will soon have another visit from me 
after I return to Old England.
Let me know what 
I can procure you in India, in the vegetable king- 
dom.
In September last I dispatched a parcel of 
seeds for the Marquis of Blandford ; and the half 
of this packet I intended for your friend Colonel 
Johnes.
Let me repeat, I shall always be highly gratified 
with your correspondence, and that I am, dear Sir, 
Your obliged and faithful 
T. Hardwicke.

My dear Sir, Spring Gardens, Dec. 19, 1807.
The specimen sheet of our new Pharmacopoeia 
is just gone to the press, and I hope to be able to 
send you a copy for your perusal very soon.
I 
have named the new Melaleuca, Cajeputi ; and had 
I all the requisite specimens of that tree before me, 
I believe I should have been tempted to draw up a 
description of it, under the above name, to be laid 
before the Linnaean Society ; but as it would be 
done so much better by yourself, I trust that you 
will some day give it, by way of supplement to your 
observations on the genus, in our third volume.
I 
122 
had not the pleasure of hearing your paper on the 
Vitellus of Seeds, which I regretted much.
It has 
been talked of a good deal among our botanical 
brethren ; but few of them are competent to judge 
of its merits, and those who are disposed to be cri- 
tics-in-chief on all occasions, have not ventured to 
arraign any part of your positions.
Your late publication is lying on my table, and I 
greedily devour its excellent contents, though, from 
the professional interruptions I experience, it is 
only by fits.
I do not misinterpret, I think, an 
allusion in the preface on the subject of Paradise*.
When may we hope to see the Lapland Tour in its 
English dress ?
I am quite impatient to peruse it, 
as indeed everything that is sent into the world by 
you.
Yours most truly,

* This alludes to a passage in the Introduction to Botany, in 
which the author observes, that " None but the most foolish or 
depraved could derive anything from the pursuit of this science 
but what is beautiful, or pollute its lovely scenery with unamiable 
or unhallowed images.
Those who do so, either from corrupt 
taste or malicious design, can be compared only to the fiend en-

CHAPTER IX.
Correspondence of Andrew Caldwell, Esq.
; — and a few other 
Letters relative to Ireland.
The correspondent whose letters here appear was 
an Irish gentleman who represented Downpatrick in 
parliament in 1788; and when the compiler of these 
memoirs had first the pleasure of being made ac- 
quainted with him, in the year 1799, was verging 
towards sixty.
Of the mildest aspect and highly 
polished manners, a tinge of melancholy cast a shade 
over his dignified deportment, which at once en- 
gaged the affections on his side, and broke every 
barrier of formality and reserve.
He lived much 
among persons of high birth, and his conversation 
was replenished with anecdote and entertainment, 
enlivened with the peculiarly pleasing manner and 
dialect of the superior ranks in the sister isle.
He had a noble generosity of spirit, and his com- 
passionate heart revolted at oppression in every 
form; but especially did he deplore and execrate the 
merciless traffic in negro slaves.
He read with re- 
markable grace, and recited poetry with more than 
common tenderness ; he was altogether a being of 
a higher order.
" How is it," asks Burns, " that in 
the short stormy winter day of our existence, when 
you now and then in the chapter of accidents meet 
124 
an individual whose acquaintance is a real acqui- 
sition, there are all the probabilities against you 
that you shall never meet that valued character 
more ?" 
This amiable man regrets his separation from the 
friends he so greatly honoured with his regard, in 
terms not unlike those in which Mr. Davall ex- 
presses himself.
" Often," says Mr. Caldwell, " do 
I lament being deprived of more frequent enjoy- 
ment of your presence and conversation ; but such 
is the condition of life, that variety of advantages 
cannot be had at once ; we must learn to be content 
with them separate and occasionally." 
The first letter in this correspondence, from 
A. B.
Lambert, Esq., is inserted among Mr. Cald- 
well's, in consequence of its relating, like a few 
others in this selection, to Ireland only.
Mr. Lambert to Sir J.
E. Smith.
Dear Sir, Castle Bourke, near Tuam, May 1790.
I hope you received the letter I wrote just before 
my leaving England.
Ever since my arrival here 
I have been taken up with business, so that I have 
not been able to pay that attention to the natural 
history of this country I could wish.
I have been 
this last month in the county of Mayo, at West- 
port, the seat of Lord Altamont, surrounded by the 
Hibernian Alps, — the most mountainous country I 
ever saw ; near it is the famous mountain of Croagh 
Patrick, reckoned one of the highest in Ireland, 
125 
which seems to promise a fine field for a natu- 
ralist.
It took me up two hours walking from the 
foot to the top of it.
I found the Andromeda Da- 
boecia * growing in great abundance on the sides of 
the mountains ; the Empetrum nigrum, and some 
other plants which were new to me, and not being 
in flower I could not determine them ; and within 
a few yards of the top, the Saxifraga umbrosa, the 
London Pride, not in Hudson.
If any one should 
wish for any plants of the Andromeda Dabcecia, I 
could send him plenty.
I hope this summer to

the name of Erica Dabeoci, Irish Heath.

moved to Menziesia by Jussieu and Swartz.

vol.
xxxv.
p. 2469.
The following letter to Sir J.
E. Smith, from R.
Duppa, Esq.
of Lincoln's Inn, dated July 1827, may here furnish a note re- 
specting this genus.
Dear Sir, — Somewhere or other I think I have met with an 
assertion that there was but one Heath indigenous to Ireland, and 
that is now removed to the genus Dabcecia '.
My question is, 
whether, of the four species of English Heath, any one is found 
wild in Ireland ?
and also, if our English Heaths are not found in 
Ireland, whether the bogs of Ireland are composed of the roots of 
the Dabcecia, the Salix herbacea, or what ?
The Erica vagans is peculiar to Cornwall.
— Query, are the 
Erica vulgaris, cernua and Tetralix found in Cornwall as well as 
the vagans ?
and is the Dabcecia, which is peculiar to Ireland, 
never found in any other country that we are acquainted with ?
R. Duppa.
1 Mr. Duppa probably meant Menziesia ; there is no genus 
Dabcecia.
The plant was called Andromeda Dabcecia in Linn.

be able to give you a good account of the plants of 
Mayo ; and nothing would give me greater pleasure 
than to see a brother member of the Linnaean So- 
ciety at Ca9tle Bourke where I reside, which is situ- 
ated on Lake Carra, joining Lake Mask and Lake 
Corrib ; being surrounded with immense high 
mountains and bogs, which seem to promise much 
gratification to a botanist, and have been, I believe, 
but little examined.
Dr. Brown, the author of the 
Natural History of Jamaica, I heard chiefly resided 
in lodgings at Ballinrobe.
I paid him a visit one 
morning, and found him in bed quite a cripple with 
old age and the gout.
He showed me a copy of a 
Flora Hiber?iica, which seemed not much more than 
a catalogue, and very imperfect.
Some old plants 
he has mentioned as new species, and showed me a 
specimen of the Juncus sylvaticus for one.
The 
copy that was in London is coming over here for 
correction, which I rather think he will have some 
difficulty in doing.
He talked to me a great deal 
about the Jamaica plants, and the number he had 
formerly sent to Linnaeus, who he told me corre- 
sponded with him above twenty years ago.
I saw at Lord Altamont's the true Irish wolf- 
dog ; he has seven of them, and the only ones now 
in Ireland.
His brother has given me a very good 
painting of one of the largest, done the natural 
size.
In a letter from Dr. Pulteney, he writes me word 
you mention some sheets of a botanic work which 
straggled to London last year, nobody knew to 
what they belonged.
I believe I can inform you ; 
127 
they came from hence, being part of an intended 
Flora Dabliniensis, published by Dr. Wade, a phy- 
sician here, and a very good botanist.
He has been 
the means of establishing a botanic garden here.
Having very lately applied to parliament for that 
purpose, they have granted three hundred pounds 
for the first year to begin it ; and I believe Dr.
Wade will have the direction of it.
He was with 
me yesterday, and wishes very much to become a 
correspondent with the Linnsean Society, and like- 
wise to establish one in this country on the same 
plan as ours, and he will be much obliged to you 
to send him the rules, &c.
I am very glad to hear 
from Dr. Pulteney that the Linnaean Society will 
soon publish a volume of Acta.
Any botanical 
news will be very acceptable to me, as I am now in 
a kingdom that is not very famous for science, and 
I do not find it very easy to get information.
I am, dear Sir, yours, &c.

P.S. The following account is in a book lately 
published in Ireland, which perhaps you may not 
have seen : " On the see lands of the Bishop of 
Dromore were found in 1783 a pair of elk horns, 
which measured from tip to tip fourteen feet four 
inches, as also almost the entire skeleton, in the 
most perfect preservation, of the enormous animal 
that wore them.
From the length of the bones of 
his fore-legs he is judged to have been almost 
twenty hands high.

I inclose you a drawing of an insect called the 
Borer, which has occasioned more destruction 
among the sugar-canes in the West Indies than the 
Hessian Fly has in America.
From Andrew Caldwell, Esq.
Sir, Dublin, Sept.
23, 1793.
Your polite attention, when I took the liberty of 
writing to you before, gives me courage to intrude 
on you again.
I hope you will have pleasure in 
being informed that a garden for indigenous botany, 
under the patronage of the Dublin Society, is a 
measure determined upon.
A committee, at the 
head of which is Mr. Forster, speaker of the House 
of Commons, and of which I have the honour to be 
a member, is vested with proper powers and a sum 
of money for purchasing ground.
We have actu- 
ally agreed for the house and garden formerly be- 
longing to Dr. Delany.
It is within a short mile 
of town, the soil excellent, the ground well varied 
with high and low, a small stream running through; 
it seems well adapted in every respect.
I mention- 
ed to the Speaker that I had hinted this already to 
you : — it gave him great pleasure ; and whenever we 
get possession, and are enabled to begin the gar- 
den, you shall be principally consulted, and your 
advice and assistance chiefly relied on.
The ground 
consists of eleven acres, which is more than seven- 
teen English acres.
It is at present too much co- 
vered with trees, but I shall be for cutting down 
sparingly and with caution.
Much of the old- 
129 
fashioned garden remains, and is pretty in its kind.
It is a sort of classic ground, having been admired 
and frequented by Swift, and all the people of lite- 
rature of that day.
The Speaker proposes that 
this should also be a garden for agricultural expe- 
riments: I cannot say that I agree with him per- 
fectly in this scheme.
There was a similar project 
undertaken by the Dublin Society several years 
ago, and it turned out very unfortunately.
They 
brought over a gentleman from England, a Mr 
Wynne Baker, rented a large farm for him, and 
allowed him a salary of 300/.
per annum.
But 
this did not satisfy him ; he was for ever bringing 
in bills for contingencies, and carrying them by his 
influence.
He was a man of talents, agreeable 
conversation, and convivial : an excellent farmer at 
his desk and over the table, but execrable in the 
field.
When I first became a member of the So- 
ciety, there was regularly a pitched battle twice 
a-year between him and the real public-spirited 
gentlemen ; but Baker always brought down a 
crowd of jovial squires and members of parliament, 
and outvoted us.
A fever at last carried him off, 
and relieved the Society ; and had he lived on, he 
would long before this have swallowed up the Dub- 
lin Society and their funds altogether.
I confess, 
after this experiment, I am dreadfully afraid of any- 
thing like a renewal.
I cannot help saying I am charmed with the ac- 
curacy of the figures, and the clearness and ele- 
gance of the descriptions in the English Botany : 
nothing can be more complete.
VOL.

I have not seen Dr. Martyn's Botanic Dictionary.
That, if well executed, would be a very convenient 
and desirable work ; but dictionaries are generally 
loaded compilations, in which you meet with a 
crowd of things, except the very thing you want to 
find.
It would be excellent if he would refer to 
the particular flower, leaf, plant, or root, that might 
illustrate his article : he should mention three or 
four of the sort, that if the reader could not pro- 
cure one, he might another.
A collection of dried 
specimens, ranged in the order of the dictionary, 
would explain the terms infinitely beyond any 
plates or verbal descriptions that could be given.
The reader should be impressed with a particular 
caution as to terms that resemble and might be 
easily confounded ; for instance, pinnatifid and 
pinnate, — the one seeming the substantive, and the 
other the adjective.
I could wish Linnaeus had 
dropped one of those terms, and invented a new 
word.
The difference between Ranunculus Flam- 
mula and R.
Lingua is not very satisfactory : the 
Flammula is not procumbent, and difference as to 
size is vague and uncertain : if it be decided that 
the bottom leaves of one are always ovate, though 
concealed in the grass, and the other never so, that 
would be something to depend on.
I wonder it 
is not mentioned that the leaves rise each from a 
sheath that envelopes the stalk.
There is often oc- 
casion to lament that, in describing a flower, the 
student is not sufficiently cautioned against con- 
founding it with another to which it may bear a 
striking resemblance ; for example, St achy s and 
131 
Galeopsis, and many flowers of that class.
The 
most of the umbelliferous weeds are subject to the 
same perplexity.
If there could be a precise posi- 
tive character pointed out to refer to at once, it 
would save much time and trouble.
I am, Sir, your most humble servant, 
A. Caldwell.
From the same.
My dear Sir, Dublin, Nov. 17, 1795.
I have a long time owed you some account of 
myself; I flatter myself at least that you expect it 
from me, and think it your due.
Nothing enter- 
taining occurred on the journey ; — the weather 
pleasant, and North Wales I had often traversed 
before.
We had a good passage from Holyhead, 
and the ladies under my charge landed safe in Dub- 
lin.
My stay there was but for a few days, being 
obliged to go to the country on particular business.
Though I travelled many miles, I cannot say the 
landscape anywhere was as beautiful as what you 
showed me in the neighbourhood of Norwich ; if 
truth must be uttered, it was more the reverse than 
you could conceive.
The posting too, I think, 
would not have put Dr. Smollet into good humour.
The first chaise, of a venerable antiquity, broke all 
to pieces and overset, just as it came to the end of 
the pavement ; et pour comble de disgrace, a fair 
stranger, a cousin of mine from Shrewsbury, was 
under my care : this was her first adventure in a 
k 2 
132 
foreign land ; but we escaped with whole bones ; — 
the journey altogether a tragi-comedy.
Having set 
down my English girl at a friend's house, I pro- 
ceeded further.
You shall be spared an exact re- 
cital of all the varieties : I shall only mention, I 
was obliged to get out of the chaise at half-past 
seven at night, on the top of a mountain, and walk 
five miles to the house to which I was bound ; the 
chaise, meanwhile, left amongst the wild natives to 
be dragged on till horses could be sent to meet them, 
the hacks positively refusing to stir a step, — I be- 
lieve, indeed, perfectly unable.
The natives little 
dreamed two thousand guineas were shut up in 
the seat of the chaise.
Had they known the se- 
cret, such is their simplicity, I am not sure but the 
shiners might have been as safe as near the police 
of your great metropolis.
I thought it, however, 
as well not to put the moral sense unnecessarily to 
the test.
The night was fair, and a little moon 
out, but such a storm of wind, and in my face, that 
it retarded my march excessively.
It was the night, 
I believe, that did so much damage in England.
I 
often involuntarily recollected my late travelling 
companion, — not that I wished him to share the 
distress, but if by chance he had been there, his 
presence would have cheered me.
I presume you did not forget the engaging bird 
at Exeter 'Change, whether or not it be the Turdus 
nitens.
Dr. Wade last summer had the ardour to make a 
stolen visit to the Giant's Causeway, to search for 
the Scilla verna, having met in a manuscript note 
133 
in an old book that it grew there.
He found it in 
abundance, and brought away some roots.
Yours most sincerely, 
A. Caldwell.
From the same.
My dear Sir, Dublin, April 5, 1796.
I am highly gratified by the interesting commu- 
nication in your last letter.
I hope one day or other, 
at no very distant period, the lady of your choice 
will honour me with a place amongst the number 
of her friends.
I claim that from partiality to you, 
and generous resignation to the formidable rival of 
botany and me.
It is true I can no longer flatter 
myself with the imagination of exploring together 
this Western Isle, or still less of visiting Italy with 
one whose taste and mine are so congenial ; yet, 
notwithstanding, I willingly raise my voice.
Tu festas, Hymenaee, faces ; tu, Gratia, Jlores 
Elige ; in geminas, Concordia, necte coronas.
My warmest wishes are for a long continuance of 
health to you and yours.
You have too just a sense 
of worldly prosperity to look for happiness on any 
other principle than your own moderate desires, 
goodness of heart, and ingenious occupations.
I have little to say about myself; it is unavoid- 
able not to share in some degree in the dissipation 
of a great town : that so ill suits my disposition now, 
that I am never so contented as when alone, sur- 
rounded with my books.
134 
A gentleman of your name is come over; he has 
brought several valuable things he purchased at the 
Duchess of Portland's sale ; he told me he laid out 
there upwards of two thousand pounds.
Perhaps 
you may know who he is ?
A friend at Liverpool is to lend me Lorenzo de' 
Medici : I wish much to read, since you recom- 
mend it.
Yours ever, 
A. Caldwell.
From the same.
My dear Friend, Dublin, Jan. 6, 1797.
You might accuse me of the spirit of retaliation, 
but I believe you think better of me than to suppose 
such a motive.
The influence of procrastination is 
too powerful, and I fear I am as little able to resist 
as those who are much my superiors.
There was a momentary feeling of regret at finding 
you intended to remove, — an involuntary impulse 
towards self; but I soon coincided with your ideas, 
and allowed that you judged right.
— How things 
come about !
My station is so distant from Nor- 
wich, it is one of the last places I could have thought 
of.
I now think myself connected there.
Let me now give you my own history.
The 
months of June and July being incessant rain, al- 
most confined me to the house; August clearing up 
and promising well, the knight sallied forth.
The 
first excursion was to a place called Ross Trevor, 
situated on Carlingford Bay, a high hill with oak- 
135 
wood down to the strand; lofty mountains all round, 
except the mouth of the bay, which is broad and 
due east.
It is the prettiest place I have seen in this 
country, and wants nothing but English taste and 
opulence.
I thought it was hardly ever visited, but 
found it a noted resort for bathing and dissipation, 
and the second evening met a multitude of acquaint- 
ances ; so next morning I packed off, and strayed 
on to Tullymore Park, Lord Clanbrassil's, a fine re- 
tired spot, — a mountain his lordship has planted 
almost to the summit, a very rocky glyn with a fine 
stream terminated by the sea.
His lordship has 
naturalized Antirrhinum Cymbalaria.
It seems to 
grow spontaneously on bridges and rocks.
I then moved forwards to Donoghadee, to visit 
my friend Mr. Arbuckle, who is collector there.
He 
was just gone over to Port Patrick, but expected to 
return immediately.
I waited three days, having ac- 
quaintances, and Mr. A.'s elegant botanic garden, 
where several plants of Veronica decussata formed 
great bushes in the open ground, covered with profu- 
sion of blossoms.
It is strange it will hardly flower 
here, nor at Lord Clanbrassil's at Dundalk.
Growing 
tired of waiting for my friend, I determined to join 
him at Port Patrick ; — we sailed the same morning, 
and crossed in the middle of the channel; so on land- 
ing in Scotland I found myself alone.
I resolved 
however to proceed, and went the first ten miles to 
Castle Kenedy, Lord Stair's.
There is a rising ground 
very nearly surrounded by two fine lakes, with some 
wooded islands ; the ancient castle, burnt in the 
year 1716, but the walls strong and good, stands 
elevated on the summit of the ground, a fine plat- 
136 
form round, and the sloping sides thick-planted,with 
many avenues cut in the stairway down to the lakes.
It looks like a magician's castle in romance, shut up 
by dark woods and lakes.
It strikes me as a fine 
place, and wants only a long range of hill on the 
opposite side of a lake, and to have a thick mass of 
planting.
I resolved to push on to Glasgow, to re- 
view early scenes of happiness in my college days ; 
— went in my way to look atCullean, LordCassilis's.
It is a magnificent castle, lately built.
It stands on 
the edge of a precipice 150 feet above the sea ; fine 
views of the Arran mountains at a great distance; 
the plantations extensive, and all thriving in the 
most exposed situation that can be imagined ; it is 
a prodigious fine place.
Glasgow has double the inhabitants since I first 
knew it.
I spent ten days there with an old friend.
The town is now elegantly built, but they assured 
me was nothing to Edinburgh.
I returned .to Port 
Patrick by another road, Paisley, Port Glasgow, and 
Greenock.
The view when you come to the Frith 
of Clyde is beyond anything seen in Wales : the 
vast expanse of water ; Dumbarton, with its double 
summits, on the opposite side ; Ben Lomond's vast 
pyramid rising behind ; the mountains of Bute and 
Arran; the numerous cultivated seats and planta- 
tions on the low ground near the water, — form the 
noblest assemblage that can be imagined.
The remainder of the journey was coastways to 
Port Patrick ; very charming, but the weather was 
bad.
Ayrshire and all about Glasgow is richly im- 
proved ; the trees only want age, and twenty years 
hence the country will look as well as England.
137 
I believe August is a bad month for botany ; the 
fructification of most plants is over, and the Crypts 
not come on.
I found a profusion of Parnassia, 
larger and more luxuriant than I had ever seen in 
England or Ireland.
Campanula rotundifolia covers 
the fields, but no Echium or Verbascum.
Rhodiola 
rosea is found on one side of Port Patrick, but I 
took the wrong side and missed it.
I spent a few days with Mr. Arbuckle.
Lord and 
Lady Clanbrassil landed and staid with us.
I then 
moved slowly on, having visits to a numerous cou- 
sinhood.
I gave three days to each, and seldom 
more than five miles to go at a time.
My last stop 
was at Dundalk, forty miles from Dublin ; a few 
days there with Lord Clanbrassil.
He goes first 
there when he comes from England.
The house is 
an old patched one close on the street, but the 
grounds behind quite in the country, and beautiful.
Here he has his garden and hot-houses.
He is very 
worthy and a great amateur ', but not scientific; every- 
body needs not be so.
I have not room, I see, for all 
my travels.
When I came back to Dublin I was 
obliged to set out for the south, chiefly on business.
I am home, and settled about a month.
A. Caldwell.
The two following letters relate to the state of 
insurrection and rebellion in which Ireland was in- 
volved at the period at which they were written.
In 
the first of these, dated May 16, 1797, Mr. Caldwell 
addresses his correspondent thus : 
" It is difficult now to think of any subject but 
138 
the alarming state of this country.
A secret com- 
mittee of the two Houses of Parliament have just 
published their Reports.
I wish I could send them 
to you ; they are worth your looking into, and are 
curious historical documents.
The Lords state that 
it was calculated by one of the leaders of the con- 
spiracy, that 30,000 persons must be massacred.
I 
understand, however, this was only from oral testi- 
mony, and therefore to be received cum grano.
The Report of the Commons is satisfactory, and 
seems well supported by evidence.
Great ability 
and contrivance is shown by the conspirators, and 
yet many of the managers perfectly illiterate, and 
not able to spell common words.
If the French 
could land a tolerable force here, the country is lost.
I perhaps, if I escaped with my life, should be a poor 
emigrant ; but I have not strength to work in a 
garden like Mr. M'Mahon ; — I don't know what I 
am fit for.
Alas !
I have this moment received very 
melancholy news, — the death of a brother-in-law, a 
most worthy man, and of great consequence to his 
family ; and a niece, an amiable young woman, very 
happily married in Yorkshire.
Between the public 
and private distresses, every thing around me wears 
gloom and melancholy." 
From the same.
My friend, Dublin, July 11, 1798.
What have I done, that you should forget me en- 
tirely, and in the hour of peril and distress ?
I am, 
it is true, alive and safe; and that probably I owe to 
139 
having command of myself enough to submit to 
confinement in Dublin.
All this fine summer, un- 
usually so, has been lost in the smoke and dust of 
a populous city.
We seem secure here, and that is 
the utmost can be said ; — but we live in a state of 
siege.
All the avenues into town are secured with 
guards and palisades ; we must keep strict hours, 
and be at home at nine o'clock : — that perhaps will 
not appear to you a hardship, yet it is to sober 
people like me an inconvenience, and sometimes 
debars one from little indulgences.
The pleasures 
of rural excursions and country life are totally pro- 
hibited.
There is no safety, except military are quar- 
tered at hand.
What a misfortune is civil war !
You can form no idea of it : and though it may be 
supposed that, with the great force now collected 
here, a rabble, undisciplined, without leaders of emi- 
nence, or concerted plan, must be supprest ; yet it 
will, their numbers being very great, require time ; 
and we fear that when the days grow short, and 
winter comes on, there will be numbers of irregular 
banditti in various directions ; so that it will be ex- 
tremely dangerous to stir from home.
I don't choose 
to mention particular facts ; it would be a long hi- 
story, and not agreeable enough to compensate for 
the trouble of reading it.
I can say no more than 
you will find in the newspapers ; and I am the less 
inclined, as reports are spread every hour, and the 
last always contradicting the preceding : — we are 
confounded, and live in a state of constant suspense.
The night before last, the 9th, a sudden engage- 
ment happened at a place within two miles of town.
140 
A small body of rebels came down from the moun- 
tains ; a few were killed on both sides ; four priso- 
ners were immediately shot, and five others brought 
into town, tried and condemned at a court martial, 
and they are executing at this very moment.
Such 
things are so frequent, nobody wonders or seems 
concerned.
I fear you have lost your lively friend Dr. Gwynn.
You may imagine we have had little temptation for 
botanical researches ; yet it was a solace to turn 
one's thoughts to the subject: it served at least to 
divert the attention from painful images.
I should have taken a jaunt to England, but it 
was neither decent nor safe to leave home and all 
my little concerns, when the country was in a state 
of confusion and trouble.
I beg my most affectionate remembrance to your 
mother and all your ladies, and am, 
Dear Sir, 
Yours sincerely, 
A. Caldwell.
From the same.
Christus natus est.
1798.
All the people of my neighbourhood are at their 
devotions in church ; the streets are as silent as 
midnight, and I seize the quiet hour to write to my 
friend.
It is a long interval since the date of your 
last favour; but procrastination is not altogether 
the fault ; — I sometimes restrain myself, fearing to 
appear a troublesome, importunate correspondent.
141 
Nothing better occurs than to give you a history 
of my life and labours ; — very unimportant, but the 
partiality of friendship will receive the account with 
indulgence.
The very day after the news that the French had 
surrendered at discretion, I went into the packet for 
Holyhead, the 5 th, I believe, of September.
The 
scheme was to ramble for three or four weeks, to 
visit several places that we have long been in the 
habit of passing by, and never seeing.
The first place was Conway.
It was too late for 
much botany, but the sea prospect and the country is 
beautiful.
I then turned back and stopped at Aber.
I went up there to the top of a mountain, but met 
with no plant worth notice ; the dry, barren summit 
of a mountain is not the place to expect botanic 
curiosities.
Hearing at the inn of Mr. Davies, I 
immediately wrote to him ; he came directly, and 
in two hours you would have thought we had been 
acquainted all our lives, — such is the liberality and 
advantage of science.
He is a most pleasing, well- 
informed companion : his kindness and attention 
were such that I staid six days.
We were everyday 
together *.
There is a romantic glyn two miles long adjoining 
the inn ; it is closed at the end by a deep rock, down 
* The amiable naturalist here mentioned is the Rev. Hugh 
Davies, a correspondent and friend of Sir James.
" Surely no chemical affinity is stronger than that of congenial 
minds !
" — and these two admirers of nature, Mr. Caldwell and 
Mr. Davies, were remarkably similar in character, if we may 
judge from the similitude of their feelings, as expressed in their 
letters.
142 
which a torrent rushes, and rolls through the glyn 
over a rugged channel to the sea, which bounds the 
other end, where the entrance of the glyn is.
We 
found Poly podium fragile, cristatum, Filix mas and 
fern., Asplenium adiantum nigrum; and I gathered 
the Papaver cambricum, some of which was still in 
flower.
There is plenty of Lichen geographicus and 
concentricus, Sedum Telephium and rejlexum.
All over that part of Anglesea is the greatest 
abundance of Lychnis flore rubro, which I remark 
because scarcely to be found here, though the coasts 
are opposite, and the soil similar in all appearance.
It seems difficult to account for the predilections of 
plants.
Bangor was the next : I prefer it to most places; 
you have prospects of sea, mountains, islands, woods, 
and can never want a varied entertaining walk.
I 
went to visit Lord Penrhyn's slate quarry, rather 
unwillingly : it is well worth seeing, and I had like 
to have missed it.
I was at Beaumaris and Caer- 
narvon, towns worth seeing for their pretty situa- 
tions and fine old castles, now picturesque ruins.
I went to the famous copper-mine at Paris Mount; 
they have now got to a prodigious depth, but, con- 
trary to most cases, the ore is not so good as near 
the surface.
There is so much sulphur produced, 
you might think yourself at Solfatara.
I came home 
after an excursion of five weeks : my return was 
unlucky; — incredible as it may seem, I was five days 
getting from Holyhead, when the passage ought to 
be in twelve hours.
Mr. Templeton has been in town for a few days.
143 
I never saw him before ; he is an alert, active bota- 
nist ; knows every thing at sight.
We went toge- 
ther to a friend's about ten miles off on the sea-side; 
it came on a storm, and so tremendous a surf it was 
impossible to walk on the beach.
He picked up a 
Chlora perfoliata withered, but with ripe seed ; it 
don't grow in this country ; it seemed as much joy 
as a good prize in the lottery.
You hear, I suppose, of the project for a Union.
It occasions much agitation here ; the majority are 
strongly against it, but the country appears totally 
indifferent as yet, and to take no part.' A great deal 
can be said for and against it ; future consequences 
must be conjectural and uncertain; that is one ar- 
gument against a change.
" Better, perhaps, to bear 
the ills we have, than fly to others that we know 
not of." 
I must own, England appears in a desperate situ- 
ation, notwithstanding the showy victories.
The 
worst of all, public spirit is gone ; the country has 
not energy to make resistance; the Constitution is 
no more than a fiction, but everybody has entered 
into a tacit consent to suppose it a real existence.
The power of the Crown is become irresistible.
The 
new scheme of inquisition into every man's private 
circumstances is beyond any attempt I ever heard 
of under Louis XIV.
The disturbances here are so far at an end, that 
the people don't assemble in large bodies ; but the 
roads are dangerous, and houses in the country are 
repeatedly attacked.
Discontent and disaffection 
prevail as much as ever.
144 
Your volume of Tracts I have seen, but would not 
read till I get my own copy : all that came over are 
already sold.
I have got an opportunity of sending 
your order to White ; — bid him give me a choice 
copy ; but I am sorry there cannot be "ex dono" in 
your own hand.
You ought by this time to be think- 
ing of the new edition of your Travels.
I am anxi- 
ous for one improvement, — that you should men- 
tion where good plates of the several articles of bo- 
tany and natural history are to be met with.
I mean 
to begin reading the Travels again immediately.
I have just had a letter from Mr. Davies.
He 
laments the decease of Mr. Pennant ; so must every 
friend to science and a respectable character.
Yours sincerely, 
A. Caldwell.
From the same.
My dear Sir, London, August 30, 1799.
The agreeable manner in which you contrived my 
time should pass, — your kindness, — Mrs. Smith's, 
and all your friends' — was more than sufficient to 
make me regret leaving Norwich : we must, how- 
ever, submit to destiny, and often practise self-de- 
nial.
Yarmouth was so full, the landlord of the inn 
where I stopped looked frightened at seeing me : — 
" Sir, if you were to give fifty guineas I could not 
let you have a bed." He calmed on my assuring 
him I wanted nothing more than the loan of a room 
for half an hour to dress myself.
All I could get 
was the common powdering room.
145 
The Greek botany I shall never live to see the 
end of; I had not even time to look through the 
thousand drawings.
With what pleasure I recollect 
the quiet studious hours in your library !
It put me 
in mind of college days ; young men then frequently 
study together.
It is not in every one's company 
now, that I can read with attention ; but you never 
were a discomposure, nor I flatter myself was I to 
you : I was sometimes impelled by curiosity to ask 
a question, but I believe not too often.
I could not find the Arabis stricta at St. Vincent's 
Rock : the plant is too small to be easily seen, and 
I had no one to direct me to the particular situation.
I observed the Gentiana, I believe the Amarella, on 
the other side of the water ; plenty of Geranium 
sangui?ieam, looking beautiful ; both the Lychnis 
dioicas ; and, in a woody glyn,a pretty lilac-coloured 
mushroom.
Yours sincerely, 
A. Caldwell.
P. S.
We are sensible of the kind concern you 
express for Lord Cloncurry.
I got leave to visit him 
twice : he is perfectly well in health, and his apart- 
ment as pleasant as a prison will admit ; but two 
great battle-axes, beef-eaters, in the room night and 
day, and they are as much prisoners as he is ; but 
they are changed every week.
The young lord will 
never be brought to trial ; they have nothing against 
him, except being warm in opposition, and impru- 
dent.
It is not unlikely they may detain him till 
the war is over.
He has a fine fortune, but greatly

His three sisters 
have 30,000/.
a-piece, which is uncommon here; 
and very good girls they are.
The father did not 
heap all on the one son.
We are very tranquil here 
and in all parts of the country; yet the newspapers 
give quite a different account.
From the same.
My dear Friend, Dublin, March 25, 1801.
Our epistolary intercourse is not very frequent, 
but it must not drop altogether; — that idea I cannot 
support.
I am anxious to know how my amiable 
friend and sometimes correspondent, Mrs. Smith, 
does ; mention everybody when you find a moment's 
leisure and disposition to think of the absent.
My botanic study has been much interrupted, and 
not by more agreeable occupation.
I have now 
begun however to resume.
Flora Britannica is 
my constant companion.
Verbal description can 
scarcely be conceived more clear or satisfactory; 
and I fancy, when the spring is more advanced, it 
will be a delightful guide through the fields.
I per- 
ceive, however, that nothing but long and constant 
practice can render the Grasses intelligible and fa- 
miliar, so that at the first glance the genus may be 
known.
I doubt what I wish for is not attainable, — 
that some one, or two at most, distinct characters 
should be pointed out, that for immediate use would 
decide the plant, without entering into description 
and minute examination.
147 
I am heartily glad your travels through Greece 
are performed at the desk near which I had some 
pleasing silent excursions before you undertook the 
task.
That climate does not seem to agree with 
English constitutions.
Another traveller of great 
expectation, Mr. Tweddell, (probably you knew 
him,) found the effects of that air and country fatal, 
and is much lamented.
I always before this had a 
favourable prepossession about the healthiness of 
Greece, and cannot recollect that the ancients took 
notice of it as being dangerous to the human con- 
stitution.
If ever you quit botany for relaxation, you may 
look into Helen Maria Williams.
In the vast profu- 
sion of chaff there may be found a few good grains 
of fact.
Farewell for the present, fellow citizen and coun- 
tryman !
I believe we should rather say subject : 
and to all friends communicate my affectionate tri- 
bute from West Britain.
Yours sincerely, 
A. Caldwell.
From Walter Wade, M.D.
Dear Sir, Dublin, Nov. 7, 1801.
Much is due from me on the subject of Irish bo- 
tany, since the Linnaean Society honoured me so 
highly by associating me with them.
I shall, how- 
ever, now make a beginning.
A favourable circumstance has lately occurred, 
which enables me to submit to the Society some 
l 2 
148 
account of a plant, which in your very valuable En- 
glish Botany, vol.
xi.
p. 733, is noticed as not being 
found in any part of the world but the Isle of Skye.
In the months of August and September last I 
undertook a botanical tour through the county of 
Galway in this kingdom, — my chief intention to ex- 
amine that part of the county called Cunnamara, a 
district, I may venture to assert, never examined by 
any botanist before, although that celebrated and 
industrious naturalist Llhwyd was in its vicinity 
about the year 1699.
Cunnamara has its beauties in many particulars, 
not only in the eyes of the botanist, but perhaps 
might engage the attention of the poet and painter; 
— numerous lofty, craggy, heathy mountains, and 
lakes ; meandering extended rivers ; hills, bogs, 
creeks, — and all surged by the Western Ocean ; 
which nothing less than the elegant descriptive pen 
of the President of the Linnaean Society could do 
justice to.
Among many other rare plants, I met with the 
one in question, Eriocaulon decangulare, Linn.

This rare 
aquatic decorates the edges of all the loughs, great 
and small, in Cunnamara, and is to be met with in 
many places in the county of Galway.
The generic 
140 
and specific characters given in English Botany, 
with the annexed admirable plate, are highly satis- 
factory.
By Lightfoot's excellent specific descrip- 
tion no one can be deceived as to its identity ; and 
the generic character by the classical Hudson pleases 
me much ; his trivial name articulata is a good one ; 
perhaps reticulata would be better.
His reasons for 
changing the old generic name to Nasmythia I can- 
not trace ; may be to honour the memory of Nas- 
myth, who was a botanist, and surgeon to James I.
Our Eriocaulon varies much as to the height of 
its scapus, from a very few inches to nearly two 
feet ; the leaves are pretty uniform, and I think 
c grass-leaved' a more descriptive term than ensiform 
or ' sword-shaped'.
In all the specimens I have ex- 
amined, the sheath at the base of the scapus is in- 
variable ; but the angles undoubtedly vary, — most 
frequently seven : if my eyes, with the assistance 
of a watch-maker's glass, do not deceive me, I have 
counted from six to ten angles on a scapus; I am 
therefore of the late Dr. Hope's opinion, who, al- 
though our Ericcaalon differs in many respects from 
the E.
of Linnaeus, yet thinks it the same.
Per- 
haps your valuable Herbarium may clear up the 
point ?
I was, on the ground of angles, at one time 
tempted to enumerate a few species, strengthened 
in some measure by a conversation I had some time 
since with a Dr. Browne, a very excellent, accurate 
botanist, who informed me that he had met with 
several species of Eriocaulon in Ireland.
I would 
most willingly yield to this gentleman's accuracy 
and better judgement, on many other points ; yet in 
150 
this instance, for the present at least, I must pre- 
sume to differ, if the angles alone on the scapus 
have tempted him to form a specific difference ; 
which, from our cursory conversation on the sub- 
ject, I am not authorized to say is the case.
I had almost forgot to inform you that our JErio- 
caulon was in full bloom the latter end of Septem- 
ber, when we last parted.
In the forming of my Flora Hibernica, which I 
have the satisfaction of telling you is in much for- 
wardness, I have made it an unalterable rule not to 
insert the locus natalis or modernized habitat on any 
hearsay authority, however respectable, except in 
addition to my own observation, if I can go or send 
where a rare plant is to be met with, or unless I re- 
ceive a living specimen along with the information.
The publication of my Flora must therefore neces- 
sarily meet with some delay.
Wishing to do as I would wish to be done by, I 
send you some specimens of our Eriocaulon, that 
you and the Society may judge for yourselves.
I am, dear Sir, 
With every possible respect, 
Your very obedient, humble Servant, 
Walter Wade.
From Mr. Caldwell.
My dear Friend, Dublin, Feb. 3, 1 802.
I am so delighted and surprised at the sudden, un- 
expected blessing of peace, it is always uppermost 
in my thoughts.
Your hint about going to Paris 
151 
electrifies me.
Who knows but that in such a scheme 
we might coincide ?
Our enjoyments are doubled 
by sympathy, and being shared with a friend; — 
mine, I am sure, would be so.
I never have been 
there ; you have tried the ground before.
As for 
me, such a crowd of things to see, to search for, 
rush into my mind, I am bewildered : I am fearful, 
if left to myself, it would end in neither seeing nor 
hearing any thing.
You could keep me in order and 
regulate my proceedings ; but I must fairly acknow- 
ledge, I feel insatiable and greedy to the last degree.
I believe Dr. Wade, at my suggestion, will trans- 
mit to you the catalogue of the plants he found 
in his excursion through Cunnamara.
He set out 
rather too late in the season, and his stay was too 
short.
I cannot say that my desires are incited to 
pursue his track ; there is not reward enough for 
the fatigue and the total want of comfortable ac- 
commodation.
One would endure a great deal for 
Greece or Italy, and go through with alacrity ; but 
the West of Ireland is not sufficiently tempting.
Being obliged to stay in town the whole summer, 
my botany was confined to my garden.
I was, 
however, part of May at Lord Besborough's in the 
county of Kilkenny.
I found the little specimen 
inclosed, on rocks, at a place called Owning ; it is, 
I think, the Myosotis j3 : the flowers were yellow, 
singularly curled like a crosier.
The leaves are hir- 
sute as well as in a, but the blossom really yellow.
The crosier form is perhaps accidental.
The Rubus 
Idcp.us was also there.
I shall be glad to know if you ever observed that 
152 
the Orchis latifolia has, occasionally, a very disagree- 
able hircine scent.
This Orchis is in great plenty 
about Besborough ; but this peculiar scent I do 
not find taken notice of by any of you botanic wri- 
ters.
The scent is more frequent when the plant is 
pulled and put into water.
It grows then so strong, 
it is very unpleasant in a room ; we were forced to 
throw them out.
I have also perceived it on the 
ground, but that seldom.
The puzzling circum- 
stance is, that many of the same Orchises, scattered 
close about, have no smell.
I have examined num- 
bers, to try whether there was any difference to make 
out a variety ; — never could perceive the least.
I 
have watched them for several days, to see whether it 
was occasioned by the different stage of the growth, 
— but to no purpose ; that seemed not to produce 
any change.
Linnaeus says, bracteis flore longiori- 
bus ; that is not the case in any plants I have ever 
seen, nor in the figure in Miller's Illustr., nor in 
Curtis.
The figure in Curtis is much better drawn 
and more faithful than in Miller.
The latter gives 
the root palmated ; Curtis's and all the real plants 
I have found have two bulbs.
These disagreements 
ought to be rectified.
I was at the Bishop of Dromore's, county of 
Down, in September ; — found in that neighbour- 
hood, and particularly on the marshy banks of the 
river Laggan, the Bidens in plenty, but whether )3.
or not, I cannot determine ; — at another friend's 
place, the Rubus Idasus in very wild rocky situations 
in great abundance.
I suppose there is no doubt of 
this being indigenous ?
153 
Quantities of the Nymphaa in the Laggan ; but 
being quite out of flower, I could not find whether 
lutea or alba : the leaves seem just the same.
The winter here has been severe, but from the 
accounts not so much so as in England.
Vast flights 
of crossbills, Loxia curvirostra I believe, made 
their appearance the latter end of August, and staid 
till the beginning of October.
They made great 
havoc in the orchards ; they never ate the apple, 
but cut it to pieces, and picked out the pippins.
They came first over to the county of Cork, then 
proceeded to Waterford, Tipperary, Kilkenny, Wex- 
ford, Wicklow, and Dublin ; but no further north : 
and yet they say it is a bird of Northern Europe.
They are good prognostics of a severe winter.
They 
were observed here, I am told, before the hard frost, 
and once since ; and now this time, when there cer- 
tainly has been severer frost than usual.
I observe 
in December's Monthly Review a work by R.
S. 
Barton on the natural history of Pennsylvania.
He 
considers the connexion between the seasons and 
the migration of birds.
My young friend, I expect, may be the better for 
the lottery prize ; therefore the less to be regretted 
it went to the rich.
It is truly strange, but I never 
knew a great prize go to any but the rich.
Could 
I have given a little shove to the wheel of the blind 
deity, it should have turned in another direction.
N'importe!
others have their riches, — the imagina- 
tion, the intellectual : I would not exchange.
How kind, how flattering your call on me again 
to Norwich!
Be assured I do not want pressing.
154 
There is a pretty little plant in our stoves, the 
Eranthemum pulchellum ; the flowers fine blue in a 
spike ; beautiful bractea: they say the London gar- 
deners stole it from Kew.
Your affectionate 
A. Caldwell.

I have been now at Harrowgate since the latter 
part of August.
The weather at first was rainy, but 
for three weeks past wonderfully fine.
These water- 
places do not suit my disposition ; I really feel a 
great dislike to them.
The idle, sauntering way of 
wasting time is tiresome to the last degree ; nor have 
I had the good fortune to meet with one companion 
from whom I could derive a new idea.
I believe, 
however, the drinking and bathing has been of be- 
nefit ; and if the purpose is answered for which I 
came here, I shall have no right to complain.
A little excursion I undertook some days since 
has been the most pleasing occurrence that has hap- 
pened to me here.
I was two days at Wentworth 
House ; it is a most magnificent place, both as to 
house and park and plantations.
I next saw Went- 
worth Castle, now inhabited by Mr. Conolly and 
Lady Louisa*: it is nearly as fine as the other, and 
* Sister of the Dowager Duchess of Leinster, and aunt of Lord 
Edward Fitzgerald.
For the character of these excellent women, 
and of Lady Sarah Napier, another sister, see Moore's Life and 
Death of that unfortunate young nobleman.
155 
in prospects and situation much resembles it.
I 
went from thence to York ; the minster there every- 
body has heard of, and all who see it must admire.
Castle Howard, Lord Carlisle's, was the next ; — all 
these places are so splendid, one is apt to think the 
last the finest.
This place terminated the excursion, 
and I returned here.
Yours, 
A. Caldwell.
From the same.
My dear Friend, Dublin, Oct. 21, 1803.
It was a great misfortune not to be able to meet 
you at Liverpool ; and when I heard you had left it, 
I at once abandoned all thoughts of going there this 
year.
So soon to be deprived of your amiable friend, 
and your future schemes of intercourse blasted, is 
melancholy.
The frequent losses of those we love 
is the great evil of life : every other misfortune in 
my estimation sinks before it.
I experienced a se- 
vere stroke of this kind but little more than a twelve- 
month since ; a friendship of more than thirty years 
was then terminated.
What a blank it has occa- 
sioned !
Such inflexible virtue, so much good sense 
and information are rarely met with.
There was 
that intimacy, that in his society we might each of 
us be said to be thinking aloud.
His name was 
Mangin, of one of the French Huguenot families.
He had been for many years first clerk in the se- 
cretary of state's office in the Castle ; but from ill 
health, much increased by unremitting application 
156 
to business, was obliged to retire seven or eight 
years ago.
His relaxation and favourite amusement 
was collecting prints and drawings.
He had the 
best taste, and more knowledge on those subjects 
than any man I ever was acquainted with.
He ap- 
pointed me one of his executors, and left me entirely 
his vast collection of prints and drawings.
This 
mark of regard, however gratifying, can never give 
me the same enjoyment as formerly ; I am over- 
whelmed with them ; and only trying to look into 
one portfolio plunged me in melancholy.
I am a 
great deal older than you, and have met with so 
many deprivations of this sort, that I feel a kind of 
insensibility creeping on.
I consider myself as a 
spectator only of a fleeting world, and have little 
interest in any thing that occurs.
Nothing you say 
in these cases avails but religion.
It is the best 
consolation, provided it be pure and benevolent, 
unmixed with worldly craft, — not such as we have 
to lament in this country/that sows hatred and ani- 
mosity, and is the true source of all our mischiefs.
You allude, I suppose, to a future state ; the pro- 
spect of which religion holds forth.
I must confess, 
however, that I do not feel that horror at the idea 
of non-existence that Dr. Johnson did : I can con- 
ceive a much worse circumstance ; — one alone, — 
with the privilege of immortality, when every thing 
else has ceased ; — that, in my opinion, would be 
more shocking than any thing that could be con- 
ceived.
My taste will not be questioned by my friend 
Mrs. Smith us to the Ayrshire poet.
The four vo- 
157 
lumes of Burns are lying in my parlour, and I open 
one or other of them every spare moment.
I certainly 
admire him as much as she can do.
The letters 
surprise me more than the poetry : the refined cri- 
ticism and good sense in them are astonishing, when 
his humble birth and education are considered.
I 
feel great concern that he did not preserve Mrs.
Dunlop's correspondence ; perhaps out of delicacy 
to her it may have been suppressed.
Dr. Currie I 
am acquainted with ; he is a most amiable man, as 
well as of more than common abilities.
Nothing 
more perfect or complete could be desired ; and as 
he is in very full practice, it is extraordinary he 
could have performed this task so admirably within 
one year.
There is another Scotch poet to whom I am ex- 
tremely partial, — I mean Allan Ramsay.
His works 
are lately published, — the most full and complete 
edition that has yet appeared.
Though not equal in 
genius to Burns, Ramsay has great merit.
His songs 
and Gentle Shepherd were the first poetry I knew 
and was delighted with in my earliest years.
They 
bring to me many recollections, many associations 
that are pleasing, but often melancholy.
The edi- 
tor is not so satisfactory as Dr. Currie ; there is a 
want of illustration and anecdote, that often disap- 
points our curiosity.
Ramsay's day is not so distant 
but that every thing might be explained.
I dare say you have founded a good sect of bo- 
tanists at Liverpool.
It is a captivating pursuit, and 
the more known the better liked.
Our huge garden 
here is a most pleasing one for a walk.
I saw, the 
158 
other day, half a dozen sorts of beautiful Xeran- 
themums a lady had got from the ever-marvellous, 
inexhaustible Cape.
One sort, the petals all curled 
and formed a sort of globe of a straw colour : others 
of a fine orange : others were flat and open, pur- 
ple, and at a distance I took them for China Asters.
England, I dare say, has had them all, and you pro- 
bably have seen them.
You mention some noble additions to your books.
Though your collection may not be so extensive 
as Sir Joseph's, I am apt to believe what you have 
is more choice and perfect than his.
I cannot 
wonder your reputation attracted Madame Bona- 
parte's attention, and the presents she has sent you 
are very gratifying.
I shall hope to see them with 
you one day or other.
They are not likely soon to 
reach this part of the world.
My best affectionate compliments to Mrs. Smith.
Yours sincerely, 
A. Caldwell.
From the same.
My dear friend, July 11, 1804.
All I can say is, that it was a disappointment to me 
— most grievous, the being prevented from going to 
Norwich.
I was introduced to so many agreeable 
people at Cambridge, their civilities were such, and 
their pressing desire to have me stay for the Com- 
mencement, so great, I found it scarcely possible 
159 
to decline.
Letters then came from London, that 
obliged me to come hither without further delay.
When I went to the university, my intention was 
to stay a week at the utmost, and I staid three 
weeks ; — much more kindness I experienced than I 
had any right to expect.
I suppose you have heard 
of Dr. Clarke : he and Mr. Cripps travelled to- 
gether for three years.
Dr. Clarke visited Pallas 
in the Crimea, and purchased his herbarium.
The 
Doctor said he was old, and when he died nobody 
there would think it of value, and it would be thrown 
out of the window.
Clarke has brought home 
great collections, manuscripts, medals, minerals, 
drawings consisting of views of interesting places, 
antique marbles, and the colossal bust of Ceres, 
discovered above a century ago by Spon and 
Wheeler, in her temple at Eleusis : it is almost 
quite destroyed, — not a vestige of the face ; some- 
thing remains of the shoulders and their drapery ; 
she has a great turret or basket on her head, which 
is called the calathos : it is covered with symbols, 
pretty distinct.
There will be a particular account 
published.
What an instance of instability in this 
world, — the object of such mystery, adoration, and 
magnificent ceremonies in ancient Greece, has now 
removed to a college amongst the barbarian Bri- 
tons !
I dare say you will some day or other visit 
Cambridge, and look over the herbarium of Pallas.
You will find in Dr. Clarke one of the most en- 
gaging men you ever met with, and he will delight 
in gratifying you to the utmost extent.
A friend in, Dublin mentioned to me, that the 
160 
drawing of Mars and Venus, omitted in the prints 
of the Elogiu?n Slultiti(E when you saw the copy, is 
now engraved in M.
Veaux's French translation of 
the Elogium, printed at Basle in 1780, and which 
perhaps you had not since heard of.
I have had a letter from Mrs. Charlotte Smith.
She has had some thoughts of going to Lowestofft 
for bathing.
She wishes it much for the hopes of 
seeing you there.
I am, dear Sir, 
Yours sincerely, 
A. Caldwell.
From Dr. JVade.
My dear Sir, Dublin, Nov. 1, 1805.
I send you nearly 200 species of Mosses, and, 
with very few exceptions, all in fructification.
The 
great majority of the more rare were gathered by 
myself, in 1796 and this year, in the county of Kerry, 
particularly on the mountains, in the woods, glyns, 
&c., within a few miles of enchanting Killarney, so 
rich in such uncommon scenes of natural wildness 
and rural magnificence.
I am aware of having sent 
a few duplicates in separate papers ; but at the time 
I arranged them for you, some trifling difference 
seemed to occur, which your very discriminating 
eye will best judge of.
Pardon me for sending you 
some common species which I gathered in this 
county and the county of Wicklow.
My respected friend may inform Mr. Turner, 
161 
that I have specimens of Musci in quantity at his 
service, as he seems to make the muscology of 
Ireland his favourite object.
You will receive by this opportunity a few speci- 
mens of plants which may be considered as rare 
with us in Ireland, — particularly the Sium verti- 
cillatum (truly a Siuni), which I got in marshy 
ground near Loun Bridge, about four miles from 
Killarney; Bartsiaviscosa, whose habitat you know 
{PL Ra7'io7\).
I will now answer for the habitat of 
Saxifraga Geum or hirsuta ?
specimens of which I 
send, having met with it in abundance in that asto- 
nishing and bewitching spot to the naturalist, the 
Gap of Dunloc, about eight miles from Killarney, 
and which divides the black and craggy sides of 
those stupendous mountains Mac-Gilly- Cuddy's 
Reeks from the Tornies Mountain, and is the di- 
rect road and best way to the Purple Mountain.
As 
you may suppose, I did not meet with it in flower, 
as it is a very early flowering plant, and I went there 
very late in the season.
However, I have sown 
some of the seeds, and planted the roots, by which 
means I shall be enabled to determine exactly what 
Saxifraga it is ; as well as some other species of the 
same beautiful tribe, particularly some extraor- 
dinary varieties of Saxifraga umbrosa; Pinguicula 
lusitanica, common ; Schoenus rufus?
on Purple 
Mountain in abundance.
I can assure you that 
Euphorbia hiberna is uniformly furnished with 
umbella quinquefida, for I have examined above a 
thousand growing specimens this season, and met 
with one only 6-fda.
Many measured between thirty

I met with it, 
but rather sparingly, in the fens at the N.W. side of 
Mucruss.
You cannot conceive, my esteemed and 
respected friend, how abundant Hymenophyllum 
tunbridgense is on all the dripping rocks on the 
mountains in the county of Kerry ; and the un- 
common state of luxuriance and magnitude which 
Osmunda regalis assumes on all the islands in the 
range to the upper lakes at Killarney is truly as- 
tonishing, looking more like large highly culti- 
vated shrubs, than a humble fern.

Society the inclosed remarks on Holcus odorahis

I long to see Mr. Turner's prediction in the 
preface to his Mus. Hib.
verified, as to a Flora of 
Ireland by Mr. Templeton : for my part, I fear it 
will be long before Mr. Turner will have an oppor- 
tunity of honouring my name with a similar pre- 
diction ; and I say it with regret, for the reason 
stated in my humble preface to Plant.
Harior.
Our mutual friend Mr. Caldwell desires to be 
kindly remembered to you, and intends writing 
shortly to you.
I feel I have intruded much on 
your very precious time, and shall only add that I 
am, with every possible respect, 
Your sincere and obliged humble Servant, 
Walter Wade.
From Mr. Caldwell.
My dearest Friend, Dublin, March 7, 1808.
The grateful feelings for the testimony of your 
remembrance and friendship that I received yes- 
terday by your letter, surpass all my powers of ex- 
pression.
I read it over and over : it contributes 
to my happiness, but I am conscious I do not me- 
rit such attention ; I do not meet with it from many 
on whom I might have some claim: but your kind- 
ness is all from generosity and sincerity, and with- 
out any pretension on my part.

I have passed but a melancholy, lonely winter, 
having been much indisposed since the beginning 
of November.
It is not being alone that is dis- 
tressing: where one can take a book, and likes 
reading, amusement and enjoyment run hand in 
hand ; but a heavy sickness renders me incapable 
of enjoyment : it has been a labour and an exertion 
at different times to write my name.
It gave me great comfort to find you were well ; 
but though I used to receive or answer a letter from 
you with delight, I this time find myself disabled.
I am, however, growing better, and look forward to 
the hopes of seeing you in London, where I scheme 
to be the latter end of next month.
It is to be re- 
gretted by me that fortune had not placed me with- 
in the reach of your society, and some others in 
England : I should have enjoyed much more con- 
stant friendship and attention than here ; this place 
is too dissipated, and there are few whose tastes 
agree with mine in preferring quiet social inter- 
course.
I have endured a long truce with botany, but 
must lose no time in refreshing my memory, or 
shall forget the very elements.
I went to our great 
garden two days ago, — the first visit since last June.
It made no great appearance, and has suffered much 
from the uncommon severity of the weather : though 
it is almost ten times as large as the garden at Liver- 
pool, and there is expense to the greatest prodigality, 
I doubt whether it be half as curious.
There is a 
fine specimen of the New Norfolk Pine, but which 
will soon be too high for the green-house ; a very 
165 
great Banana, which looks as if it would produce 
fruit.
They have had the Bohea Tea in flower : — 
and excepting these articles, our garden has nothing 
to show at present.
I believe where we exceed Li- 
verpool is in the large trees and shrubs.
I hear your new work is come over, and I am 
impatient to see and begin it.
If I can make it out 
so as to be in time for the Institution course, I shall 
be enchanted.
Mr. Roscoe, from his writings, and 
intimacy with my relations, I think myself well 
acquainted with : I was introduced to him, and 
enjoyed his conversation for half an hour when last 
in Liverpool.
I believe our politics, that is, yours and mine, 
being founded on strict moral principles, can never 
differ.
I look on the outrage at Copenhagen with 
as much indignation as if I were a native of the 
place : I am glad to hear there are some people in 
England that are sensible of its baseness ; but I fear 
very few, and that is a dreadful symptom of general 
depravity.
Botany, that in England unites people and 
classes them in friendship, produces here a contrary 
effect ; they are all at variance : the University has 
displaced Dr. Scott, an ingenious, lively man with 
great merit, and a good botanist.
I have read Mr. Johnes's Froissart, and think it 
a most curious picture of its times.
All the little 
skirmishes and battles that resemble one another so 
closely, we may skip over in a great measure.
How 
melancholy the consideration, that in all countries 
and in all ages to fight and to slaughter is the road 
166 
to glory !
I am rather displeased with Mr. Johnes, 
for not reprobating- that mischievous absurdity; and 
he never produces a sentiment or makes a remark 
on the occasion.
I am, my dear Friend, yours sincerely, 
Andrew Caldwell.
This letter, written under the pressure of illness 
and dejection of spirits, was the concluding one of 
a correspondence which for many years afforded 
considerable enjoyment to both parties, and pre- 
sents a lively image of the conversation and tem- 
per of the amiable writer.
He died very soon after 
the date of the above.

Dear Sir, York, March 10, 1810.
Though I have been confined by rheumatism 
nearly since Christmas, I feel a fancy to write you 
a gossiping letter.
Till last summer I had never 
crossed the Tweed ; but in July my son and I set 
out to accept the Duke of Gordon's invitation, and 
to see what we could in a month and a tour of 
above nine hundred miles.
We went by Newcastle to Dunbar and Edin- 
burgh, where we stayed forty-eight hours, and were 
enchanted.
From thence to Stirling, Crieff, Perth, 
Brechin, and turned off a few miles to Mr. Alex- 
ander Brodie's at the Burn (purchased of Lord 
Adam Gordon), where we stayed two days : then 
to Aberdeen, and by Inverurie and Huntley to Gor- 
don Castle.
After six days, to James Brodie's for 
two days.
He very kindly went with us to Inver- 
ness, where we hired four horses for the Highland 
168 
road; and in four days they got us to Crieff, 120 
miles.
Then to Stirling and Glasgow, where we 
were most highly gratified : but rainy weather be- 
gan then, and continued throughout the remainder 
of the journey to Carlisle, Keswick, Ambleside ; 
Lord Lonsdale's, at Lowther, for three nights ; and 
home, seventy-six miles, with ease in a day.
It is 
difficult to say what we saw or did.
We were 
asked how many brace of moor-game we had 
killed.
Answer — We went to gain new ideas of 
country and inhabitants, and refused all opportu- 
nity of sporting.
What plants did I find?
None, 
but two or three which the Duke's factotum showed 
me in the woods ; for my son being no botanist, I 
was determined not to delay him for a moment, 
and, except his laughing at my being annoyed with 
precipices in the Highland road, we never had a 
difference ; indeed that road is so bad, that, but 
for an excellent carriage and servant, we should 
have been lost in difficulties.
My son saw the 
Cumberland Lakes to disadvantage, from an un- 
ceasing rain ; but I have seen them twice before.
Lord Lonsdale's new house is a wonder.
It is a 
gothic palace ; and, although only begun two years 
since, is already inhabited by all the family.
Smirke 
is the architect.
Brodie has a botanic garden for 
British plants, and employs himself almost entirely 
with them, though I got him to salmon-fishing one 
day.
Where salmon is most plentiful, there is the 
worst angling ; for they are harassed with nets 
night and day, and have no time to feed.
The 
Duke's fishery lets for 6000 guineas per annum !
169 
and the renters are said to make a fortune.
I saw 
the ice-houses, which are entirely above-ground and 
have no waste drain, the melted ice sinking into 
the sand.
Two thousand salmon have been taken in 
one day in that fishery (river Spey).
The largest fish 
I heard of was caught at Aberdeen in May, 1762, 
and weighed sixty-three pounds, Dutch weight, of 
seventeen ounces and a half to the pound.
Gordon Castle is five-hundred and sixty-eight 
feet long, and eighty-four high in one part.
Mr.
Hoy was endeavouring lately to determine, upon 
Arrowsmith's map of Scotland, the number of 
square miles contained in the Duke's estate in the 
different counties, and found that in Moray, or 
shire of Elgin, along the side of Spey, there are 
13f ; in Banffshire, low country, 24§ ; in the same, 
high country, 204 ; in Aberdeenshire, 107 ; in 
Inverness-shire, Badenoch, 325 ; in Lochaber, 330 ; 
—total, 1004^ miles, and 642,720 acres; all pro- 
perty lands, without including those over which the 
Duke has only the superiority.
The plants which were shown me in the woods 
at Gordon Castle are Satyrium repens and Pyrola 
secunda.
Mr. Brodie gave me Eriocaulons.
Satis superque from your most faithful 
Thomas Frankland.
From John Walker, Esq.
My dear Sir, Bedford Square, March 16, 1810.
I beg to offer you my particular acknowledge- 
170 
incuts for your truly friendly attention in sending 
mc cuttings of Willows.
Some of the species, par- 
ticularly the liusaelliana, a very valuable one, I did 
not before possess.
When you come to town, you will have the satis- 
faction of seeing Sir Joseph Banks looking uncom- 
monly well, and perfectly free from gout, which he 
attributes to a French quack medicine he has been 
induced to try, at the pressing solicitation of Lord 
Spencer.
From a single dose of a tea-spoonful 
and half, he experienced almost immediate relief.
Mr. Home left him one afternoon in agony with 
the gout in eight different places, and with a hard 
and high-beating pulse at 94.
The following day 
he found him altogether without pain, tenderness 
alone remaining, and with a pulse perfectly tran- 
quil and reduced to 67.
I am aware that a solitary 
instance is by no means sufficient to convince you 
or any medical man of its general utility ; but to 
the above instance I may add those of Major 
Rennell, and near twenty more who have tried it 
with the same immediately beneficial consequences, 
however inexplicable they may appear.
It has been 
prepared in France upwards of thirty years, under 
the name of Eau medicinale cC Husson.
Che- 
mistry has proved it to be vegetable ; but from what 
plant the very extraordinary powers of this medi- 
cine are derived, remains at present unknown.
You will have heard that we have lost Mr. Ca- 
vendish, — a man of a wonderful mind, more nearly 
approaching that of Newton than perhaps any indi- 
vidual in this countrv since his time.
Educated 
171 
and trained by his father from very early youth to 
scientific pursuits, they became habitual, and were 
the sole occupation of a very long life, fruitful in 
important discoveries, forming the basis of modern 
chemistry.
That his mind remained unaltered and 
unimpaired to the very last, his paper in the second 
part of the Transactions for 1809 is a sufficient 
proof.
"Ingenitas didicisse fideliter artes" ought to 
improve the whole man, the heart as well as head.
It is to be regretted that science and charity were 
wholly forgotten in the distribution of his property.
He might well have divided 100,000/.
between them, 
which I believe would not have been an eighth part 
of his immense possessions.
Yours most sincerely, 
John Walker.
From William Smith, Esq.
My dear Sir, Parndon, Nov. 20, 1810.
I am really sorry I was not of your party in the 
so well described library*, with its so well appre- 
ciating visitants ; but with all due and humble sub- 
mission, I should have made, I will not say a better, 
but a more every-hour companion for Lord Spencer 
than yourself; for when tired, if ever, of the library, 
I could have gone with him to the field, — from 
taking down books, to knocking down pheasants, 
— which I fear you could not.
* Mr. Coke's, at Holkham.
172 
He is an admirable specimen of the pteriple- 
gistic, philosophic statesman, 
" Who rapid turns the keen observant eye 
From men to books, from books to man again ; 
Stores and compares ; his well-digested store 
Then opes and uses in the walks of life ; 
And when the faint o'er-laboured spirit flags, 
Renews its vigour in the sportful field." 
I cannot recollect where is your most happy and 
poetic quotation about the dusty books, if indeed I 
ever knew it.
Yours truly, 
W. Smith.
From Sir Thomas Frankland.
Dear Sir, Thirkleby, York, April 13, 1811.
My son has just returned from Lincolnshire, 
where he has been hunting these last five weeks.
It agrees with him, as far as my eye informs me.
In the third week of October last I went to Sir 
Joseph Banks's in Lincolnshire, where I stayed near 
a week, and had a most agreeable and interesting 
visit.
The singular fineness of the season and good 
breeding of game gave me uncommon diversion 
there ; but late in October I perceived a strain in 
my tendon which was broke in 1792, and, though 
I favoured it, by a slip (at Duncombe Park) in 
November I contrived to be crippled.
However, 
I was trout-fishing all this morning, and feel no 
concern on the subject.
Glaucium fulvum, of 
173 
which you gave me some seeds two or three years 
since, is the most desirable plant of the kind which 
I know.
We found it in full blow on returning 
from town, and for some months it was in gorgeous 
flower, renewed daily.
I saved much seed, and 
have distributed it as an acquisition to every gar- 
den.
I had great pleasure in thinking Sir Joseph 
particularly well in mind and body, notwithstanding 
the alarm which many persons have felt respect- 
ing the gout medicine which he has latterly taken 
as an alterative.
— Accum tells the Duke of Gordon 
that it is Gratiola ; and that a medical friend of 
his gives that plant with success.
In looking into 
Lewis's Materia Afedica, I was struck with the ef- 
fects of Gratiola agreeing so exactly with those of 
Eau medicinale.
I found lately a lime-tree branch like a teapot 
handle, about four feet from extremities ; but whe- 
ther the branch grew upwards or downwards does 
not appear, the union is so perfect.
It is in a row 
of very fine old trees.
T. F.
From Dr. Waterhonse.
Dear Sir, Cambridge (America), July 24, 1811.
I here send for the library of the Linnsean So- 
ciety a little work I have just published, in which 
I have endeavoured to do honour to our great mas- 
ter.
I have laboured to make him known to my 
174 
countrymen during cight-and-twenty years past, 
and at present Linnaeus is no stranger to the in- 
habitants of these " ends of the earth." 
As I was the first who gave lectures on natural 
history in America, I was obliged to give it the 
popular dres9 which " The Botanist " comes forth 
in.
I wa9 compelled to clear the ground to pre- 
pare it before I sowed the seed.
I found I must 
first excite a taste, and then try to gratify it.
Our 
elder brethren in Europe know not the difficulties 
that the first settlers in science have to encounter.
I found it particularly difficult when I first gave 
lectures on mineralogy to persons who had per- 
haps never seen a book upon that subject.
This 
will account for the popular dress in which bo- 
tany has been presented to the youth of both sexes 
in this country, and it will explain why I tried to 
celebrate certain female characters who had distin- 
guished themselves in natural history.
I hope to 
send you hereafter some paintings of plants and 
insects, executed by some of our ladies, that Marian 
herself would not be disgusted at.
Natural history 
will flourish among us, although we may not pro- 
duce a Linnaeus or a BufFon. I observe among us 
young Swammerdams, young naturalists on whom 
Fate has written " Laadatur ct algetT 
My bookseller already talks of a new edition of 
" The Botanist ;" but before I determine on that, 
I should like to profit by the criticisms of such a 
great master in the science as Dr. Smith.
My wish is to open such a path in the field of 
175 
botany, as would be most useful to such a country 
as ours, and at the same time be gratifying to the 
botanists of England.
With a high degree of respect, 
I am yours, &c.
Benjamin Wateriiouse.
From Mrs. Cohbold*.
My dear Sir, Ipswich, March 2 G, 1812.
The pleasure I received from those lines which 
you showed me of Mrs. Barbauld's on the King's 
illness induced me to order her pamphlet']" of 181 1, 
which I have read with much attention, and, I must 
add, much feeling.
It is in a high strain of poetry, 
and possesses a fire of genius and force of language 
which T should not have expected from her ad- 
vanced age and what I had seen of her earlier pro- 
ductions ; but if I were offered the powers of genius, 
together with the feelings manifested in that poem, 
I would reject the combination as a dangerous and 
deadly gift.
It yet remains for the world (I would 
say a world of false philosophers, were that race 
not sinking fast into oblivion,) to invent a word so 
monstrous as to express hatred of one's country, 
and exaltation of her rivals !
Could such a passion 
have a name, I should say this is the ruling one of

ful and appropriate verses on the death of Francesco Borone, 
which were published by Sir James in his volume of Tracts, in 
1798.

176 
Mrs. Barbauld's mind.
Was it by degradation of 
his country that Nelson infallibly led her sons to 
victory f Is it by filling the minds of her sons 
with gloom and despondence, that we would enable 
them to support her through the present arduous, 
unequal, and dreadful conflict ?
Shall that being 
dare to assume the name of patriot, who shall call 
it guilt in Britain to contend with the giant-power 
of France ?
Or shall a mortal pretend to read the 
decrees of the Almighty, and declare that he has 
doomed the fall of Britain ?
Columbia, too, is the land of freedom !
the tem- 
ple of science !
Pray tell me how has she im- 
proved in science since she lost her Franklin ?
and 
how has the pristine vigour of her constitution, and 
its freedom, been preserved, since she lost her great, 
her truly exalted Washington ?
What are her le- 
gislators now ?
One half of them servile knaves, 
sold, for the most ignoble of all rewards, to the 
despot of Europe ; the other and more virtuous 
half, distracted by jarring interests, and feeble and 
disunited in their councils.
America, from her extent of territory, her con- 
siderable and increasing population, and the abun- 
dance she possesses of all the necessaries of life, 
can never reasonably be the object of conquest : 
any attempt to subdue her must increase her moral 
and physical strength by cementing her civil union.
Discord is her great and only danger.
She may, 
and probably will in time, become a great nation ; 
but she is at present only in her youth ; strong and 
agile, I grant, but with a head not sufficiently ener- 
177 
getic to direct the limbs in the most efficient man- 
ner.
Should that head be weakened by fatuity, or 
perverted by the corruptions of the heart, adieu to 
all the visions of rising grandeur.
Far, far be from me to say that Britain is all 
god-like !
that she owns none of the human im- 
perfections to which other states are subject !
Her 
rulers have the same corruptions as those of other 
lands ; and perhaps the dreadful examples of anarchy 
around her, have led her to submit too easily to 
the encroachments of power.
Still there is a vi- 
gour and purity in her constitution, which will ma- 
nifest itself, — not I trust in the rude efforts of brutal 
strength, but in calm and steady energy.
Dearly 
do I love my country, and I cannot suppress my 
indignation, when I see any of her sons or daugh- 
ters, even in imagination, attempting to bow her 
neck beneath the feet of a nation which I consider 
so inferior to her in all moral dignity, as America.
It is a most unusual thing for me to enter on 
any subject connected with politics ; but as I know 
my opinions to be perfectly independent of any 
party, I thought I might be allowed to express 
those genuine feelings which arose in my mind on 
the perusal of a book, which, on the most mature 
consideration, I cannot find tending to produce any 
good effect in society ; and which is only the more 
dangerous on account of its poetical excellence.
At 
the present momentous crisis, we ought to be 
awakened to a sense of our danger ; but so much 
the more should the amor patriae be excited to avert 
it.
Had I been acquainted with Mrs. Barbauld, it

is probable that a sense of her private worth might 
have led my mind to overlook or palliate the gloomy 
tendency of her poem.
As it is, I read without 
prejudice.
I promised to tell you what I thought of this 
book, and I have done so without reserve ; you 
would have a right to despise me, if I could sacri- 
fice truth even on the altar of friendship.
I would 
rather lose some little portion of the love of my 
friends, than one iota of their esteem.
Love may be 
won by flattery ; esteem must be the result of good 
qualities, and the power of appreciating them.
Your ever affectionate Friend, 
E. Cobbold.
Sir J.
E. Smith to Mrs. Cobbold.
My dear Madam, Norwich, March 30, 181?.
I did not doubt your admiring Mrs. Barbauld's 
poetry ; indeed, I think this poem (without any al- 
lowance for her age) may take its stand amongst 
the most lofty productions of any poet, male or fe- 
male ; as I think her hymn, beginning 
"Jehovah reigns: let every nation hear!" 
the most sublime and poetical hymn that ever was 
written, — without any allowance for her youth or 
her sex in that case either.
Indeed she requires no 
allowance, though ever ready to claim it ; for her 
character tind her humility are equal to her talents.
Now let me tell you my opinion of the politics of 
her poem.
I conceive the three first pages and 
179 
four lines of the fourth are a virtuous, patriotic, and 
just view of the evils produced by the usurpation 
and policy of Buonaparte: what follows is too just, 
though I hope too gloomy, a picture of what Britain 
has to fear.
As to the ' guilt', that involves a ques- 
tion on which very good people differ.
Mrs. B.
seems to think the war, not being unavoidable, was 
guilty.
Some think it the cause of the tyrant's suc- 
cess, who might never have had an existence, if 
France had been left to herself.
This would lead 
me too far ; you know better than I do what has 
been said.
I only mean that Mrs. B.'s idea is con- 
formable to that of numberless undoubted good 
Englishmen and good subjects.
From p.
6 to 17 appears to me to express the 
most enthusiastic love and patriotic admiration for 
her country, and all that has ennobled or will immor- 
talize it.
It must be a e false philosopher' indeed, 
who could pervert this eloquent celebration of Bri- 
tish virtue, talent, and distinction into an effusion 
of ' ' hatred ' !
And where does she exalt the rivals of 
her country ?
Does not she express that even 
America, if it should, in the lapse of ages, (for that 
I know is her meaning,) become what Asia was, and 
Europe is, — even America, I say, will be indebted to 
England for all her taste and learning, and will 
fondly dwell on this as classic ground ?
I surely 
need not point out to you that the sublime and for- 
cible picture (p.
17 to the end) is a highly poetic 
personification of the power of civilization.
In this 
she looks forward to ages yet unthought of, taking 
her stand far above the present events or contem- 
n 2 
180 
pliitions ; comprehending the whole history of ci- 
vilized man, all antiquity, in the retrospect, and 
anticipating what thousands of years may produce.
Whatever alludes to Britain in this prospect ex- 
presses what has been the fate of all other countries; 
and it is lamentable for any, — but not less inevita- 
ble.
Has not the progress of Christianity been 
from east to west ?
So we are taught to trust it will 
embrace the globe.
She does not say Columbia is 
the temple of freedom or science, but that it pro- 
bably will be.
Far indeed is she from descending 
to the paltry speculations for which you give her 
credit about the petty parties of the day, there or 
elsewhere !
Now, my good friend, forget all party, 
and be (not a false, but) a true Christian philoso- 
pher ; take this excellent woman to your heart as 
a congenial spirit ; for if you knew her as I do, I 
will do you the justice to believe you would love 
and admire her as much.
My wife is copying two 
productions of hers*, that abundantly evince her 
* Mrs. Barbauld's Hymn before mentioned.
Long as it is 
since it first appeared in print, the writer makes no apology for 
inserting it at length in this place.
HYMN.
Jehovah reigns : let every nation hear, 
And at his footstool bow with holy fear ; 
Let heaven's high arches echo with his name, 
And the wide peopled earth his praise proclaim ; 
Then send it down to hell's deep glooms resounding, 
Through all her caves in dreadful murmurs sounding !
He rules with wide and absolute command 
O'er the broad ocean and the steadfast land : 
181 
patriotism and her piety.
How far her precise no- 
tions or opinions may agree with yours or mine, I 
really neither know nor care.
I know she is a zeal- 
ous Christian, but not a zealous Socinian, Arian, or 
Athanasian ; I should suppose most of the second.
Jehovah reigns, unbounded, and alone, 
And all creation hangs beneath his throne : 
He reigns alone ; let no inferior nature 
Usurp, or share the throne of the Creator !
He saw the struggling beams of infant light 
Shoot through the massy gloom of ancient night ; 
His spirit hush'd the elemental strife, 
And brooded o'er the kindling seeds of life ; 
Seasons and months began the long procession, 
And measured o'er the year in bright succession.
The joyful sun sprung up th' ethereal way, 
Strong as a giant, as a bridegroom gay ; 
And the pale moon diffused her shadowy light, 
Superior o'er the dusky brow of night ; 
Ten thousand glittering lamps the skies adorning, 
Numerous as dew-drops from the womb of morning.
Earth's blooming face with rising flowers he drest, 
And spread a verdant mantle o'er her breast ; 
Then from the hollow of his hand he pours 
The circling water round her winding shores, 
The new-born world in their cool arms embracing, 
And with soft murmurs still her banks caressing.
At length she rose complete in finish'd pride, 
All fair and spotless, like a virgin bride ; 
Fresh with untarnish'd lustre as she stood 
Her Maker bless'd his work, and call'd it good ; 
The morning-stars with joyful acclamation 
Exulting sung, and hail'd the new creation.
Yet 
182 
I can speak positively to her Christian charity, which 
you and I think the most important point.
Thus I have written as freely as yourself in the 
true spirit of friendship : and if you find me in the 
right, it is all I care about ; for you are worthy to 
know, and capable of appreciating, if you did know, 
my highly honoured friend.
&c.
&c.
J. E.
Smith.
Yet this fair world, the creature of a day, 
Though built by God's right hand, must pass away ; 
And long oblivion creep o'er mortal things, 
The fate of empires, and the pride of kings : 
Eternal night shall veil their proudest story, 
And drop the curtain o'er all human glory.
The sun himself, with weary clouds opprest, 
Shall in his silent dark pavillion rest ; 
His golden urn shall broke and useless lie, 
Amidst the common ruin of the sky ; 
The stars rush headlong in the wild commotion, 
And bathe their glittering foreheads in the ocean.
But fix'd, O God!
for ever stands thy throne; 
Jehovah reigns, a universe alone ; 
Th' eternal fire that feeds each vital flame, 
Collected, or diffused, is still the same.
He dwells within his own unfathom'd essence, 
And fills all space with his unbounded presence.
But Oh!
our highest notes the theme debase, 
And silence is our least injurious praise ; 
Cease, cease your songs, the daring flight controul, 
Revere him in the stillness of the soul ; 
With silent duty meekly bend before him, 
And deep within your inmost hearts adore him !

From Mr. James Lee.
Dear Sir, Hammersmith, July 9, 181 2.
I received your kind letter of the 12th of May 
with a packet of seeds from Russia, for which ac- 
cept our best thanks ; and also your other of the 
22nd June concerning the particulars of the life of 
Mr. Masson.
I mentioned to you that I thought 
he had been ill paid, considering what he had done 
for the science of botany.
He explored the Cape 
of Good Hope twice, Madeira, the Canaries, Azores, 
Spain, Gibraltar, Tangier, Minorca, Majorca, the 
West Indies, and Canada.
Masson was of a mild 
temper, persevering in his pursuits even to a great 
enthusiasm, of great industry, w r hich his specimens 
and drawings of fish, animals, insects, plants and 
views of the countries he passed through, evince; 
and though he passed a solitary life in distant coun- 
tries from society, his love of natural history never 
forsook him.
Characters like him seem for the pre- 
sent dwindling in the world, but I trust they will 
revive.
I am, dear Sir, with great respect, 
Your much obliged Servant, 
James Lee.
From J.
A. Pavon.
Madrid, the 22 of July, 1813.
To the must celebrated Botanist Sir J.
E. Smith.
I conserve in my power and to your order a little 
offering, which I make to the merit that Sir Smith 
184 
obtained of the charmer science of the botany.
This 
little present is a Monography of eight and twenty 
new sorts of Laurels that I discovered and drawed 
in the native places, and under the trees of the 
South America.
The present was prohibited me to 
publish it, and so I send only to you the engraved 
patterns ; and you will have the goodness to tell 
me any person to give them in Madrid, along with 
another exemplar, that I inscribe for your media- 
tion, and in my name to the wise Society of Lon- 
don, asking you and the wise Society will be so 
good to censure, with kindness, the imitation of the 
patterns in the botanist part, and tell me the defects 
which you know in the analitic or anatomic part of 
Linneo's system.
I send to you the note of collections which I will 
sail to live ; if any wise man lover of the botany 
will buy some of them, you will have the goodness 
to tell me by our ambassador the Count of Fernan- 
nuiiez.
I will send to you the other exemplars of the 
Laurography so soon as I can publish it.
I shall be 
very glad if you will be so good to answer me, only 
to have a memory or letter of the wise Sir Smith, 
honour of the botany for your works that I read 
every day to learn and to know your erudition.
I was eleven years in the South America, and I 
experienced great many tempest in the Cape of 
Hornos and in the South Sea, and by land the re- 
volution of the Indians under the command of Tu- 
pac Amaro.
In Spain I have been many times to 
be killed bv the bavonets of the famous scholars of 
185 
Neron Targuine, and above all them the new Ma- 
guiabel Bonaparte.
I wish to be useful to you in any thing, and in 
the mean time I am, 
Sir, 
Your most obliged and obedient Friend, 
The Spanish Naturalist 
Joseph Antonio Pavon.
The envelope of this letter was thus singularly 
inscribed : 
"To celebrious botanist, Sir Jacob Eduard Smith 
member of various academys scientificals.
— 
To London, 
" Para el celeberrimo botanico el Doctor Smith

bajos literarios botanicos, su afectisimo con- 
socio el Botanista Espaiiol, Autor de las 
Floras Peruana y de Chile, Jose Antonio 
Pavon .
" 
From Dr. JBigelow.
Sir, Boston, Massachusetts, Nov. 18, 1813.
I take the liberty to address you, inclosing the 
introduction which my excellent friend M.
Correa 
has obligingly given me.
In the present imperfect 
state of science in this country, I am every moment 
sensible of the necessity of an European correspon- 
dence, to supply the defect of books and advantages 
which it is impossible here to command.
I cannot 
but feel highly honoured in having at this time the 
privilege of epistolary access to the head sources of 
186 
the science.
In the New England states wc have a 
country as yet little explored by European botanists, 
and having in some degree a botany peculiar to it- 
self.
Many of our species resemble those of Eu- 
rope, but at the same time differ in small particulars, 
so as to leave it doubtful whether they are species 
or varieties.
For example, our Salicornia herbacea?
has its joints entire, not emarginate, and its calyx- 
scales acute.
Our Callitriche aquatica has very ob- 
tuse or cuneiform leaves.
Our JEthusaCynapium?
of which I inclose seeds, is destitute of a nauseous 
taste, &c.
On these plants it is difficult to decide, 
without a comparison of actual specimens.
The 
present unhappy war presents a serious obstacle to 
the conveyance of seeds, &c.
; but opportunities 
must sooner or later occur for making communica- 
tions or exchanges of this sort.
I send you with 
this the seeds of an Iris, which is new to me, but 
perhaps is already in your collection.
Its character 
is, /.
imberbis,foliis linearibus^ alternis ; caule tereti, 
multifloro (7 — 8-floro); germxne trigono, lateribus 
bisulcis.
It has the habit of /.
sibhica, but differs 
in its germ, which is smaller ; grows in wet lands 
with /.
virginica, but is less frequent.
I also send 
seeds of a tetradynamous plant of our salt marshes, 
which from its habit I think a Bunias.
I should 
describe it, B.
silicula articulis binis Icevibus mono- 
spermis ; foliis obovatis,sinuato-dentatis.
The silicle 
is drupaceous.
It answers nearly to Cakile cegyp- 
tiaca of Willdenow, without the "dente obtuso".
I 
wish very much to know whether the Datura Tatula 
of Linnaeus be a distinct species.
We have here a 
187 
Datura with a purple, spotted stem, answering in 
everyway to the description ofD.Tatula, but which 
is evidently a variety of D.
Stramonium.
I have 
sought in vain for any permanent difference.
I have caused to be put in the press in this town 
an edition of your excellent Introductory work, for 
the attendants on lectures which I have undertaken 
in this place.
Our botanists are not yet sufficiently 
numerous to induce the booksellers to publish large 
works ; but as the country grows I hope the taste 
for science will increase.
I have the honour to be,&c.
Your obedient Servant, 
Jacob Bigelow.
From Sir Joseph Banks.
My dear Doctor, Soho Square, Dec. 9, 1814.
We are all here at a loss on the subject of Her- 
modactyls.
We have little doubt that the gout me- 
dicine is composed of that root, and that the doctor 
of Yoxford in Suffolk, who sells a medicine similar 
in taste and smell to the French, uses our Colchi- 
cum, but have some doubts whether our Colchicum 
autumnale is the same plant as that used in the 
Greek Pharmacopoeia.
Ca?salpinus on the article Hermodactyle says, that 
the flower is white ; in other respects the plant re- 
sembles our Colchicum: but he speaks of two other 
plants of the same genus, that are poisonous.
Have 
you any thing among Sibthorp's papers that throws 
any light on the Hermodactyl of the Greeks?
If 
188 
you have, I shall be thankful for the communica- 
tion.
If you have not, I intend to write to Constan- 
tinople, where I have no doubt the drug will still be 
found in the apothecaries' shops.
Adieu, my dear Sir James !
Always faithfully yours, 
Joseph Banks.
From Dr. Michel Tenore.
Naples, Jan. 6, 1815.
My very respectable Sir and Fellow !
The favourable circumstance of the amiable rela- 
tions happily established between our countries, and 
the great desire of enjoying the honour and the 
advantage that every botanist may obtain by the 
correspondence with a personage as worthful as the 
celebrious author of the British Flora, encouraged 
me to address you this very respectful letter, with a 
copy of the Royal Botanical Gardens Catalogue.
This establishment, although was born but in 
these years, is at present notably enriched of every 
kind of plants, and specially of those collected by 
my voyages all through the different provinces of 
this kingdom.
It is several years since I am applied to illustrate 
the plants of the Neapolitan Flora, as you may see 
by the prospectus that I have the honour to envoy 
you; and I pray you to let them circulate amongst 
the learned men of your country.
If your goodness will not disdain my corre- 
spondence, I shall make myself a duty to put every 
189 
care for showing you the devotion and the high 
esteem which I am penetrated with for your re- 
spectable person.
I am the honour to be 
Your most obedient Servant, 
Michel Tenore.
From H.
Repton, Esq.
Harestreet, near Romford, July 9, 1S15.
My dear Sir Edward, 
How mortified have I been ever since I found 
your card on my study chimney !
After nine 
months' confinement, I at length ventured to spend 
a week in town, and carried my pains and penalties 
with me, or had them carried about from place to 
place in a carnage, — to which the entrance and 
exit were always felt to my heart.
I can now sup- 
pose that you intended to pass the day with me; and 
had I known it, I could have left London a day 
sooner to enjoy such a meeting.
After having rubbed on for sixty years in this 
same world, where we all have our rubs, so many 
old friends are rubbed off, that to me it is a pecu- 
liar satisfaction to see a long-known friend ; and if 
you had no other quality than what Dr. Johnson 
would call sexagenary contemporaneousness, it 
would be a cause of jubilee ; but we have both 
passed through life without shutting our eyes, like 
half those whom we remember to have seen, while 
they saw nothing but vanity and frivolity.
You, 
like your great precursor, have examined from the 
190 
cedar to the hyssop, and could surprise him by pro- 
ducing your hortus siccus to show how little he 
knew ; and yet after all, you still have a list of de- 
siderata, — something- to add to that mass of won- 
ders which daily inquiry has been collecting almost 
beyond the power of numbers and of names.
If 
you should ever be at a loss for the latter, and could 
affix it to some plant of the Ivy tribe, or of any 
climbing genus, which, like myself, wants to be 
supported, I should rejoice to have my name re- 
corded by your power of conferring immortality.
My great predecessor Adam would never have been 
able to find names for an hundredth part of your 
vocabulary ; but he lived in a garden with one friend, 
and one enemy, who, like Buonaparte in our days, 
was the enemy of peace.
What wonders have 
we lived to witness !
kingdoms raised and kicked 
down like a child's house of cards.
The mighty 
empire of the Franks, one week given to the Bour- 
bons, the next to the Buonapartes !
then taken 
away, and now hanging in jeopardy, to be decided 
by the Russian Cossacs ; while a Wellington and a 
Blucher are supposed to have, according to a fa- 
vourite French phrase, " covered themselves with 
glory." Who but must see something beyond the 
power of man, which has been operating by means 
unaccountable, to produce these wondrous changes ?
and while we boast our conquests of kingdoms, and 
our power and glory of victory, without the most 
distant taint of Methodism, I am insensibly led to 
consider whose are the kingdom and the power and 
the glory.
Such thoughts will naturally arise when 
191 
the body has been so long preparing for that change, 
which, instead of being an object of terror, is to me 
a source of joy and hope, — not only as the means of 
escaping from much torture and some anxiety, but 
as holding out new scenes of beauty, and a more 
intimate knowledge of the works of the Creator, 
which, however numerous, are now become fami- 
liar, and excite less of wonder although more of 
reverence for their Divine contriver.
Is it possible 
for you, who know so much more of the created 
evidences of the Deity, to feel satiety here, and a 
wish to enlarge your scene of observation ?
I have 
no doubt this will happen to all whose active minds 
lead them to wish for such enlargement ; and then 
you and I shall meet, and compare our ideas on 
that and many other subjects : — but I will not be- 
lieve we shall never meet again somewhere, — till 
when, God bless you!
H. Repton.
From the Rev. R.
Walpole.
My dear Sir, Aylsham, Feb. 12, 1816.
You may remember our speaking once together 
on the subject of (pXniuoQ (the modern name both of 
Euphorbia Characias and Verbascum sinuatum,) 
being used for stupifying fish ; and I mentioned to 
you that Sibthorp says, Mercurialis annua is used 
now for catching the Scams.
On looking at a vo- 
lume of the Memoirs of the French Institute, con- 
taining a paper on the fishing of the ancients, I find 
the following passage : — " Ainsi ils attiroient le 
192 
Scare avec lc Unocal is, qui paroit 6trc notre mercu- 
rialeT I suppose this is from Oppian, bat no re- 
ference is made : this, however, I will look to.
" Les 
anciens pecheurs avoient, ainsi que nous, des re- 
cettes pour endormir le poisson, et aussi pour l'cra- 
poisonner.
Aristote nous apprend qu'ils era- 
ployoient a cet usage l'ellebore.
Suivant Oppien, on 
faisait des gobbes pour enivrer le poisson avec du 
cyclamen et de l'argile.
Le cyclamen est une plante 
a racine tubereuse que le vulgaire appelle pain de 
por^eau, parceque cet animal en est tres friand.
Theophraste lui reconnoit entre autres proprietes, 
celle d'endormir." — Hist.
Plant, ix.
c. 10.
It is remarkable that the French writer should 
say nothing of that passage in Aristotle which de- 
scribes fish being caught tm ttXojlko ; for so it is 
written.
Will you be kind enough to give me your opinion 
about the first statement respecting linocotis ; and 
also if you have anything to remark concerning the 
use of ellebore, as intoxicating?
The three plants 
that Sibthorp mentions with this quality are Co- 
mma maculatum, Euphorbia Characias, and Verbas- 
cum sinuatum.
Will you also be good enough to 
add the modern name of cyclamen ?
I wrote some months ago to a gentleman who 
was travelling in Greece on this subject ; and he 
answers me, that one mode of catching fish is " by 
means of tpXopoc, great Tithymal : they dam up part 
of the water, and then throw into it some of the 
herb : this intoxicates the fish, so that they float 
on the water's surface, and are easily taken bv the 
193 
hand.
There are two species of (frXojuoQ, one larger 
than the other.
For want of this, Aconitum is 
sometimes used for the same purpose." You see 
part of this agrees with Sibthorp's statement, and 
confirms us in the use of <p\o/uoc.
I will here ob- 
serve, that Sprengel says Euphorb.
Char, is yapaKiaa 
of Dioscorides, and tiOv/hciXog of Hippocrates.
What can my correspondent mean by Aconitum ?
I am sorry to have intruded thus on your time ; but 
you must blame only yourself, because my trou- 
bling you arises from your readiness always to an- 
swer what questions I send you.
With our best regards to Lady Smith, 
Believe me to remain, dear Sir, 
Yours very truly, 
R. Walpole.

J'attends impatiemment le temps ou je pourrai 
vous voir au milieu de vos richesses a Norwich : je 
tourne mes regards vers la haute chaine des mon- 
tagnes de l'lnde.
J'ignore si je les verrai; je trouve 
tout naturel que le gouvernement accorde plus de 
protection a des sujets Britanniques qua des etran- 
gers ; mais j'ai eu trop a me louer des personnes 
qui composent le gouvernement, et j'ai trop de con- 
fiance dans la liberalite d'idees de votre nation, pour 
penser que Ton puisse blamer chez vous le desir 
d'un voyageur d'examiner des roches et des herbes, 
dont Dieu, je pense, n'a donne le monopole a per- 
sonne.
Vous direz que ceci ressemble a une plainte.
Vous jugerez si elle est juste lorsque vous lisez le

Dear Sir James, Endsleigh, Sept.
9, 1816.
Accept my very sincere thanks for your kind let- 
ter, inclosing one to my gardener Sinclair.
I am 
sure he will feel your goodness to him as it deserves ; 
for your opinion and advice cannot but be highly 
valuable to him in the pursuit in which he is en- 
gaged with so much zeal and earnestness, and which 
I trust'will do him credit, and be of some utility to 
those who take up agriculture as a science.
And 
197 
surely when every thing tends so much to the de- 
pression of agricultural pursuits, those who think 
them of some importance to the interests of the 
country cannot too closely investigate every part of 
this subject, which may in any degree operate to 
render the earth more productive, and give a stimu- 
lus to the industry and skill of the cultivator of the 
soil.
I was much gratified by your visit to Woburn, 
and flatter myself that you may be induced to repeat 
it ; and if at any time you should be brought into 
this western corner of the island, I shall be delighted 
to show you the humble but picturesque beauties of 
the scenery surrounding this little cottage, which, 
though on a more confined scale than the moun- 
tains of Wales or Highlands of Scotland, are not 
without considerable interest.
Believe me to be, with sincere regard, 
Your very faithful Servant, 
Bedford.

CHAPTER XL 
Correspondence of the Abbe Joseph Correct de Sena.
Among those friends of Sir James Smith, who were 
created such at first sight.by the magic sympathy of 
natural science, the Abbe Joseph Correa de Serra 
must be placed foremost.
He was a botanist of 
the first rank ; and the reader may recollect that his 
acquaintance with Sir James began at M.
de Jus- 
sieu's at Paris, and that they afterwards met at 
Rome.
The Abbe" Correa was a man of great genius and 
penetration, of good family and connexions ; but, 
although a priest, appears to have fallen under the 
suspicion of the Inquisition.
The particulars are 
involved in obscurity, yet some light may be thrown 
upon them by the letters which immediately follow.
The first is from M.
Broussonet, to whose acquaint- 
ance Sir James was first introduced at Edinburgh.
From M.
Broussonet.
Mon cher Smith, Saragosse, 29 Juillet 1794.
Persecute en France et pret a y perir, je me sauve 
a travers les plus grands dangers en Espagne, et je 
desire pouvoir me rendre en Angleterre pour passer 
199 
ensuite l'Amerique Septentrionale, ou j'ai envoye* 
quelques marchandises, dont le produit me fera vivre 
jusques a ce que je gagne quelque chose en fesant la 
medecine, ou en donnant les lecons d'histoire natu- 
relle.
Je me rends dans ce moment a Cadiz, ou je 
voudrois trouver une passage sur un vaisseau de 
guerre Anglais ou sur une frigate.
Peut-etre m^rae pourrais-je passer a Gibraltar ou 
a Lisbonne; mais je crains que les fonds ne viennent 
a me manquer, n'ayant pas pu en emporter beau- 
coup de France.
Je me suis adresse au Chev.
Banks, 
je le prie de me procurer de passage sur quelque 
vaisseau de la marine royale : je tremble que ma 
lettre ne le trouve dans le Lincolnshire.
Veuille 
bien, mon bon ami, l'engager a prendre interet a ma 
situation ; elle est reellement digne de pitie.
Envoyez-moi des lettres pour Gibraltar, pour Lis- 
bonne.
Aidez-moi a me tirer de la position bien 
malheureuse ou je suis.
J'ai ete nourri dans le mal- 
heur ; je puis me contenter de peu ; la table meme 
des matelots me conviendra.
Si vous pouvez me 
preter quelque chose, vous me rendrez un veritable 
service ; il me faut peu, et encore meme ce ne sera 
que pour le passage.
Les marchandises que j'ai a 
Baltimore, les effets que j'ai assures en France, enfin 
mon frere et mes sceurs vous repondront de la bonte 
de ma dette.
Je ne connois que vous et le Chev.
Banks a qui je puisse m'adresser dans cette occa- 
sion.
Adieu, mon cher Smith ; plaignez-moi, mais 
n'abandonnez pas 
Votre Ami, 
Aug. Broussonet.

premiere Aug. Broussonet, la seconde Don Antonio

Ecrivez-moi ; ce sera une grande consolation.
Adieu !
From J.
T. Koster, Esq.
. 
Sir, Lisbon, Oct. 23, 1794.
By desire of Dr. Withering, to whose good ad- 
vice on the score of health during the two winters 
he resided among us here I am much indebted, I 
send you a specimen of the Creeping Fig with its 
fruit.
Mr. Masson, with whom I had the pleasure 
of being acquainted here some years ago, I think 
called it Ficus pumila; but my worthy friend the 
Abbe Correa calls it Ficus repens : it grows abun- 
dantly and luxuriantly in the green-house at the 
Royal Botanic Garden near this city, covering the 
trellis on the inside the glass to the very top.
I had the pleasure of seeing the Abbe yesterday 
afternoon, who called upon me, and brought with 
him the unfortunate M.
Broussonet : this gentle- 
man came in a merchant-ship from Cadiz, under 
convoy of the America and two frigates on their 
way to England ; but having heard of many French 
cruizers being out, who have taken another of our 
packets, he is afraid of proceeding.
I have done 
everything in my power, at the Abbe's earnest re- 
quest, to get a passage for him in the King's ship ; 
but Captain Rodney's orders are so strict against 
carrying French passengers, that he could not con- 
201 
sent to it.
They both begged that I would make 
this circumstance known to you, and desired to be 
remembered.
M. Broussonet had been at the bo- 
tanic garden, and seen this plant, which he also spe- 
cifies by the name of repens.
The specimen is packed in a small paper box 
stuffed with cotton wool, and directed for you.
Sir 
Henry Vane, Bart., who is a passenger in the Ame- 
rica, has kindly taken charge of it, and will deliver 
it to you, if in his power.
I wrote to Dr. Withering some time ago, and told 
him that the plant would produce its fruit about 
this time ; and in his answer he expresses a wish 
that the specimen might be sent dried to you ; and 
it is fortunate that so good an opportunity should 
immediately offer.
After having mentioned to you these four names, 
I am confident it would be superfluous to make any 
apology for troubling you with a letter.
I am, with very great respect, Sir, 
Your most obedient and most humble Servant, 
John Theodore Koster.
From the same.
Sir, Lisbon, Jan. 25, 1795.
I received the honour of your letter of the 16th 
of December by the packet that arrived the 15th 
instant, and it was exceedingly unfortunate that she 
did not come in a few days sooner.
M. Broussonet 
202 
might then have gone in the Boston frigate, and his 
stay here has been the cause of great mortification 
and real detriment to our friend the Abbe Correa.
I explained to Sir Joseph Banks that his presence 
here gave umbrage to the two emigrant Dukes of 
Luxemburg and Coigny, and that they had applied 
to the court to have him sent away.
Since that time 
still more noise has been made about it, and it has 
been contrived to supersede the Abbe in a lucrative 
and honourable place, which had been promised 
him, — that of public librarian ; and he still appre- 
hends other disagreeable consequences : not that I 
imagine poor M.
Broussonet is the real cause, any 
further than that the Abbe's enemies have eagerly 
seized upon the opportunity, and alleged his at- 
tachment to Mons.
B. as a proof of their former 
slanderous accusations.
It is true that our friend 
the Abbe has been rather too unguarded in express- 
ing his political opinions in such a country as this.
Under a weak, irresolute, though arbitrary prince, 
surrounded by a corrupt, ignorant, bigoted, intri- 
guing court, what else can be expected?
It happens 
too, very unfortunately, that the Duke de Lafoens*is 
confined in a violent fit of the gout, or he might in 
some measure have stemmed the torrent.
In consequence of Sir J.
Banks's recommenda- 
tion, I am sure Mr.Walpole would readily undertake 
it, and could certainly protect Mons.
B., and obtain 
leave for him to stay here as long as convenient ; 
but you may judge of M.
Broussonet's feelings on 
* John de Braganza, uncle to the Queen of Portugal.
203 
knowing that the Abbe s civilities to him cost him 
so dear ; he has therefore resolved to set out di- 
rectly for Gibraltar.
He carries a passport to our 
Mr. Pinto, the secretary of state ; another from 
Mr. Walpole, with his letter to General Rainsford, 
and the admiralty order.
I hope he will get safe 
to that fortress ; indeed I shall be anxious to hear 
of his safe arrival in England ; for when once a 
man's affairs get into a wrong train, it is often so 
difficult to set them right again, that one cannot 
help being suspicious and apprehensive about fu- 
ture events.
I can assure you that poor M.
Brous- 
sonet can hardly resolve to set out, and goes with 
a heavy heart, foreboding a cool reception from 
General Rainsford, and all the ills that can possibly 
happen ; and I am persuaded that, when you ac- 
quaint Sir J.
Banks with these circumstances, he 
will have the goodness to write again to General 
Rainsford.
The first time you see Sir Joseph, I beg the fa- 
vour of you to let him know that I have advanced 
a small sum of money to M.
Broussonet, that I have 
procured a letter of credit for him to Gibraltar, and 
also to Faro upon his route, of all which I will give 
Sir Joseph an account in due time.
As soon as I saw your Tour advertised, I sent 
for it, which the Abbe laid hold of and had the first 
reading ; perhaps this was the work you wished to 
send him.
M. Broussonet has just finished a letter 
to Sir Joseph Banks at my house, and will set out 
as soon as ever a man and horse can be procured 
to conduct him to Faro ; from thence our deputy 
204 
consul will take charge of him, and send him for- 
wards in a proper manner, either through Spain or 
by sea, as most convenient.
I have the honour to be, most truly, 
Your most obedient, &c, 
John Theodore Koster.
Whether the Abbe* Correa escaped from a real 
danger or not, there is no doubt that he lied from 
his country soon after these letters were written to 
Sir James, and took refuge in his friend's house in 
Great Marlborough Street, who received him with 
open arms.
This was early in 1795.
The following extraordinary letter explains all 
that is known of this affair ; it is certain his mind 
was deeply impressed with terror, which has no ap- 
pearance of being imaginary.
From the Abbd Corrda.
Dear Sir, Penzance, Cornwall, April 13, 1795.
Perhaps you will be surprised to find me so much 
nearer you than you believed ; but I am sure you 
will be still more surprised when you will know the 
motive of it.
I have been obliged to leave Portugal 
by a persecution whose injustice and iniquity is only 
to be credited when seen, and whose particulars I 
will explain to you in London ; and our friend 
Broussonet will tell you what part of it he saw him- 
self.
The inquisitor-general bore the greatest part in 
205 
that hellish plot, whose final aim was not directed 
against me, but it was deemed necessary to strike 
me down before.
As there was no time to lose, and I was not in- 
formed of the peculiarity of your alien act, I did not 
provide myself with the passports which I now find 
necessary to enter England, and which I own are 
very just precautions in such a time as this of war 
and suspicions.
Now at Penzance I am detained by 
contrary winds, and by an embargo laid on all your 
ships coming from abroad.
I cannot without leave 
from your government take the way of London by 
land ; and even in case the ship will be permitted to 
proceed to London, according to the master's hopes, 
I cannot disembark there without such a permis- 
sion.
What I did for our common friend Brousso- 
net at Lisbon in the days of my prosperity, I beg 
from you now that I am in the same circumstances 
he was then ; and I beg less, because I will not re- 
main in England but just a few days.
I will then 
embark for anywhere else but Portugal and Spain, 
to be out of reach of my infernal persecutors, who 
(for some time at least) will, I am sure, be unrelent- 
ing, and will not spare any just or unjust means, 
false or true pretext, to hurt me as much as it will 
be in their power.
Happily I could bring with me 
money enough to reach whatever part I will choose, 
and live there for some months ; and I could leave 
in Lisbon, in sure hands, about three hundred pounds 
to begin my settlement where I will choose to re- 
main.
That makes me in some sort tranquil for 
the future; but that does by no means diminish the 
206 
embarrassment I now lie under, — the want of this 
permission of your government, which I entreat you 
by all the reasons of humanity to endeavour to ob- 
tain to me by the interposition of Sir Joseph Banks, 
who, in his character of general patron of sciences 
and letters, will, 1 am sure, not be scandalized, if I 
apply to his protection for such a narrow permis- 
sion of staying in London.
I have so full a confidence in your friendship and 
humane generosity, as well as in his liberal heart, 
that I entertain no doubt of obtaining it.
This fa- 
vour can make me happy ; and what is to me now 
a time the greatest benefit to receive, is not I con- 
fide very difficult to you to bestow.
I do not write 
to the Chevalier Almeyda, our ambassador, because 
he is the nephew of a great man w T ho is in the num- 
ber of my persecutors, and from what I have seen, 
none of the less violent ; and this same reason hin- 
ders me from thinking of England for the place of 
my asylum.
The ship I am in is the sloop Mary, 
Captain Anthony Reskruge.
The name I have 
taken is Joseph Porto, which is the family name of 
a relation of mine, not by any other reason but to 
get safe out of the Tagus ; but now I shall pass by 
it till I reach London, and the permission I so 
earnestly pray you to obtain me is to be obtained 
with that name.
Perhaps a letter for me from Lisbon has reached 
Sir Joseph Banks's hands, as also now I send a du- 
plicate of this, the more to be assured of your re- 
ceiving it.
I entreat you to beg pardon to him in 
my name for such importunities ; but the friend 
207 
who probably has written to me does not know your 
address ; but he knows that of Sir Joseph Banks, 
and also that by your means it would have come 
to my hands.
Did you ever believe that I would 
have found myself in such circumstances, when you 
wrote in the third volume of your Travels, "that 
you wished me long life to reap the fruit of my be- 
nevolent aims"?
But if you can obtain for me this 
permission, which is rather of going from England 
than of staying in it, I would reckon myself very 
happy ; and you will be a great benefactor to your 
most obedient and affectionate Friend and Servant, 
Joseph Correa de Serra.
P.S. Do not forget my address here is Mr. Joseph 
Porto.
From Sir Joseph Banks.
My dear Doctor, April 16, 1795.
A letter will by this evening's post be dispatched 
to the mayor of Falmouth, directing him to grant 
a passport to Mr. Joseph Porto to come to London.
I inclose you a frank and the Abbe Correa's letter, 
in order that you may apprise him of the circum- 
stance.
Very faithfully yours, 
Joseph Banks.
I find it has been reported in Lisbon that he was 
a little deranged in his faculties ; but his letter to 
you seems to put that matter out of question.
208 
It appears from the following correspondence, 
that the Abbe continued in England, and remained 
in tranquillity some years in the neighbourhood of 
London.
From the Abbe Corrfa.
Sir, London, June 15, 1795.
Till now I have not thought proper to obtrude 
myself in your w T ay.
I know what is to be in the 
bosom of one's own family, much more on such 
occasions as this which now brought you to Nor- 
wich, and have given you full time to enjoy it un- 
disturbed.
But I have my rights also, and will not 
be negligent about them.
I have a right to know 
how you do, and to be happy in the knowledge that 
you are so : I have a right to present my best re- 
spects to your truly respectable mother ; and have a 
right to tell you what I do here, and what news I 
receive from my country about my affairs.
Did you 
ever expect such a bill of rights from a man who 
owes you so many obligations ?
Don't be afraid; 
I will not be severe for the moment, because I be- 
lieve you are nearly about the time of returning to 
London, where I will know what respects to you, 
and tell you what concerns me.
At Norwich I wish 
you only to assure your mother of the sentiments 
of respect and deep esteem I have for her, and how 
heartfully I wish her every blessing.
As for you, 
I believe you are sure enough how sincerely and 
heartily 
I am, Sir, yours &c, 
Joseph Correa de Serra.
209 
P.S. The news from Portugal are far from being 
bad.
Vest le meilleur des mondes possible, in Pan-

Dear Sir and Friend, London, July 4, 1795.
Since you wish to have from me a long letter and 
botanical news, I will readily comply with it, because 
of all England you are the person with whom I like 
the better to converse, and botany is now the purest 
spring of pleasure to me.
Your Kua^uor, is a pretty 
name, and I find the ancient botanists very explicit 
in its signification.
They distinguish well enough 
the Cyamus agyptius, which is the Nelumbo, from 
the Cyamus hellenicus, which is the common bean.
It seems that kvo/.ioc was to them a general name 
of a class of resembling seeds, just as the word pois 
in French, which is given to the Pisum Ochrus, to 
the seed of the Cnestis, to the Cytisus Cajan, to the 
seeds of Guilandina, &c.
; and the English word 
bean, which is given not only to the Faba, but to 
some Phaseoli, &c, only distinguishing them by 
epithets, as the Cyams were.
I wish to ascertain if the beans of the Mareotis 
and of the Tritonia Palus, — to eat whose (which) was 
a sin to the ^Egyptians, they being under the in- 
fluence of Typhon, a cruel deity, — were the seeds of 
the Nelumbo.
But there is another reason why the word Kvapoc 
is a happy one for the Tamara emblem of prolific 
nature.
Its original root ow is applied in some 
VOL.
II.
p 
210 
senses to the act of fecundation and gravidation ; 
and if some of our Greek scholars put any difficulty 
to the derivation of the word Kvafxoc from kvw, — which 
he can very reasonably do, since there is no forcible 
analogy in that language to bring the one from the 
other, — we can stop his mouth, presenting him the 
verb Kva/jiilu), a verb by the common consent of 
grammarians derived from kvw.
If I had here at 
hand philological books, as I have of natural hi- 
story, something should be done to illustrate the 
archaeology of this new genus ; but still I will go 
to the library of the British Musaeum, and try to 
make a classical nosegay for the christening of so 
classical a genus.
So Cyamus let it be, and Cyamus 
for ever !
Since your departure three new botanical works 
have appeared, viz., Thunberg's Monngraphia of the 
Hermannice, and Major Velley's and Mr. Stack- 
house's works on the Fuci.
These last I believe to 
be very good books ; but the physiological part is 
so obscure and vague, that I have dared to do a little 
memoir myself on the fecundation of submersed 
plants, which I defer reading till after your return : 
because I confide in your friendship, you will not 
treat me in this and other such occasions as Ray 
treated Sir Hans Sloane.
The docility and deference 
which you always will find in me for your advices, 
will, I hope, entitle me to your kind patience ancj 
inspection in my botanical undertakings.
Days ago I was at Lee's with our fellow Lambert ; 
and, as many species of Verbascum unknown to me 
were in blossom, I tried in all of them the phaeno- 
211 
menon of their irritability, with the greatest success 
in all of them.
I remember having spoken to you 
about it ; and as probably the English Verbasca are 
now in flower about Norwich, I will be very glad if 
you observe it minutely.
Strike with a stick, and 
with some force, the stem of the plant, under the 
branches, two or three times, and wait patiently for 
some minutes ; you will see the limbus of the co- 
rolla move towards the centre, and afterwards the 
basis of the tubus slowly detach itself from the re- 
ceptacle, and fall, — and immediately the calyx close 
itself with impatience, and embrace the seeds ; and 
that will happen to all the open flowers one after 
another.
In Portugal I had observed it in the Ver- 
bascum Thapsi, sinuatum, Blattaria, now at Lee's in 
many others, and I wish I could observe all its spe- 
cies and the Celsia : I know nothing analogous in 
other plants.
Next year this will be followed, and 
make a memoir for our Society.
Mr. Bauer is about 
to publish the Digitalis.
Mr. Menzies has written 
to Sir Joseph from Valparaiso in Chili, and in a few 
months will be in England.
— These are all the bo- 
tanical news I can send you.
From what you say, I am convinced it is my fate 
to be obliged to all your family.
I will endeavour 
to justify the good opinion which your mother has 
given of me.
Pray remember me to her ; and also 
where I am not yet acquainted I vow myself, as in 
the Roman dedications, notis et ignotis Diis.
I wish Mr. Voght* was in London, to get ac- 
quainted with him ; the author of such a benevolent

pamphlet must be, I am sure, a man of an equally 
amiable character and sound understanding.
Your compliments have been presented to the 
botanic circle at Soho Square, and I am charged to 
send you theirs.
To see you again in London, happy 
and in good health, is the constant wish of your 
hearty friend, 
Joseph Correa de Serra.
The writer recollects with much pleasure the 
Abbe Correa's visits to herself and Sir James, when 
they resided for a short time at Hammersmith in 
the spring of 1796.
She was prepared to admire this 
engaging foreigner, and was not disappointed.
No- 
thing could exceed the hilarity of his spirits, and 
the lustre of his dark intelligent eye, while in a sort 
of poetic rapture he talked of the charms of nature, 
and of flowers in particular, and especially of the 
satisfaction it would afford his mind to have a plant 
named after him.
This he declared was the lasting 
honour he desired.
He had witnessed the events 
of the French Revolution, had seen rank and for- 
tune overthrown, escutcheons effaced, and names 
obliterated ; — while in this mode of perpetuating an 
honourable fame, nothing human could destroy it ; 
the remembrance of him would be renewed every 
season with the revolving year, as long as the world 
endured !
His friend had the pleasure of dedicating to him 
a beautiful genus, native of New Holland, of which 
three species only are known: that called Corrcea 
virens is figured in Exotic Botany.
How much 
213 
soever the Abbe" might pride himself in this posses- 
sion, he found he was in danger of innovation where 
he thought himself most secure.
" Do you know/' 
says he, "that La Billardiere has transformed the 
Corraa you granted me into MazeutoxeroJi?
What 
a barbarous name !
It seems to me as if a Vandal 
or a Longobard had been put in possession of my 
territory.
God help me ; is it not misfortune 
enough to be stripped of my property, but I must 
be robbed by such a monster as Mazeutoxeron !
" 
From the Abbd Correa.
London, Jan. SO, 1797.
Do not judge of my readiness in answering your 
letters by the long time I have waited to answer 
yours of the 3rd instant.
I hope I will seldom be 
interdicted the use of my right-hand to write, as I 
have been in the present occasion, by an abscess in 
the second finger of it, which is at present perfectly 
healed, after a tedious and they say dangerous sup- 
puration in this cold season.
By this time I am 
sure your work is advanced : I wish I could say as 
much of mine ; but I begin to feel the necessity of 
drawing by myself, otherwise it will be impossible 
to advance as fast as I wish.
Willemet's Herbarium 
Mauritianum I have seen in Usteri's Botanic An- 
nals, and is, as you say, a poor performance.
The 
Conway of which the preface speaks is the French 
general commanding in India, who perhaps did per- 
secute Willemet rather from difference of party in 
politics, than from any dislike to natural knowledge.

They are now in Fiance planning an expedition to 
the interior of Africa, according to the report of 
the secretary of the class of natural sciences in the 
public meeting of the Institute in the 4th of Janu- 
ary, where also an historical eulogium of Professor 
Sibthorp was read, composed by M.
de Guys.
The only work of natural history worth men- 
tioning comes from foreign countries.
Since you 
are at Norwich is the Musamrn Ichthyolithologicum 
Veronense, which is a splendid publication, and 
the written part of it deserving commendation.
As for English publications, I am sure you have 
seen Mr. Salisbury's Prodromus, and found me 
turned into a star, — a nebulous one indeed ; others 
will rather say meteor.
Afzelius has brought very extraordinary plants 
from Africa, and truly paradoxical.
His Flora Gui- 
neensis will be a great step advanced towards the 
improvement of botany.
Few remain to be exa- 
mined, and I believe in a week more they will be 
over.
I have lately received a very friendly letter from 
Don Rodrigo deSousa, and he sends compliments to 
you.
I believe you will do well if you write to him.
My respects to Mrs. Smith and your venerable 
mother.
Since Miss Fanny deigns to recollect and 
claim my old acquaintance, you will be so good as to 
give her my most grateful thanks.
As for you, believe me ever entirely yours, 
Joseph Correa de Serra.
215 
From the same.
My dear Friend, London, March 23, 1797.
What have you thought of my silence ?— Be sure 
it was not want of friendship or of gratitude.
When 
you are acquainted with what it was, you will laugh 
perhaps.
I have in my hand your diploma from the Lisbon 
Academy, which I do not send to Norwich, because 
you are to visit London in the next month.
The 
Academy sends to you a present of all its works, 
and they are at Lisbon (ready to be embarked) in 
Roster s hands, who has written to me to inquire 
if you would think them worth paying the duties on 
them, which he says are very high on books in 
England.
Sir Joseph Banks, to whom the Aca- 
demy also made a present of its works, tells me 
that he is very glad of having them all.
I wish to 
know what you intend to do.
In your last letter to Lambert, I saw with the 
greatest pleasure your division of genera of the 
Protect family.
It happened that I had just then 
examined the Cape Proteas in Masson's collection, 
which has occupied us in these last weeks, and will 
occupy for some more ; the variety of seeds and seed- 
vessels, and the different ways of aggregation in the 
flowers had struck me.
When your letter to Lam- 
bert came to my hands, I was enchanted at the read- 
ing of it, and must give the due praises to your 
discriminating powers, which I always have told 
you will constitute your proper character of a bo- 
tanic writer.
All your genera are, I suppose, taken 
216 
mostly from New Holland plants ; some of them 
are not familiar to me, but I can see the justness of 
the characters you establish.
I wish you would also 
examine the Cape Proteas, because the two Floras 
are much more alike than it is supposed they are, — 
not only parallel, but are both fragments of a whole.
Styphelias are found at the Cape.
Masson has 
brought two species, and God knows if in the dif- 
ferent genera of the Protect, family many are not 
common to both Floras, and to be reciprocally il- 
lustrated by each other.
Will you allow me the 
liberty of a friendly observation * The general ten- 
dency of the family is to be tetrapetalotis, notwith- 
standing the insertion of the stamina in the corolla; 
so I wish you would try those which appear mono- 
petalous, before a definitive determination, because 
many of them may be only slightly connated petals 
in a tubular appearance, as I will be able to show 
you in the Lambertia, which is perfectly tetrapetala, 
and the petals of which are only ala, which accom- 
pany the filaments to the insertion under the ger- 
men, extremely alike to the ala which accompanies 
the pedunculns of the flowers in the Tilia, and 
which is commonly reputed a bractea *.
I beg pardon, my dear friend ; but if the caution 
is not a good one, it comes at least from a friendly 
heart.
Be so good as to present my compliments to 
Mrs. Smith, and to your respectable mother.
I am most heartily yours, 
Joseph Correa de Serra.
* I don't say these petals are bractece, but only the form of 
them is like the bractea of the Til'ia flowers.

Lorsque j'ai ete a Londres pendant quelques mois 
du printems de cette annee, mon tres cher et esti- 
mable ami M.
l'Abbe Correa m'a mis entre les mains 
un riche paquet de livres, que votre Altesse Royalea 
daigne m'envoyer de la part de l'Academie des Sci- 
ences de Lisbonne, dont les recommendations du 
meme ami m'ont rendu, depuis quelque terns, 
membre.
Je suis tres sensible, Monseigneur, a.
l'hon- 
neur que votre Altesse Royale et l'Academie m'ont 
fait, et je vous supplie d'agreer mes remercimens 
les plus respectueux.
Je serai charme d'avoir 
quelque chose touchant l'histoire naturelle digne 
d'etre offerte a l'Academie, et de lui temoigner ma 
reconnoissance.
Mais je saisis avec encore plus d'empressement 
l'occasion qui se presente d'offrir mon hommage le 
plus sincere a.
son illustre President, dont le carac- 
tere et les lumieres relevent meme son rang eleve, et 
doivent le rendre cher a sa patrie et au genre humain.
Je suis charme que M.

en Angleterre.
II s'est devoue a la botanique, sur- 
tout ce qui regarde l'economie des plantes, et il me 
semble qu'il ne se ressent nullement de ses mal- 
heurs passes lorsqu'il se trouve dans un jardin de 
botanique.
Je suis, avec les sentiments les plus respec- 
tueux, de votre Altesse Royale le tres hum-

Je viens de recevoir par mon ami M.
l'Abbe" 
Correa, votre tres estimable lettrc en date du 16 
Aout, et ce n'est que trop vrai que je me suis era* 
presse de demander de vos nouvelles a peine arrive 
ici.
Le souvenir que vous daignez garder d'un ancien 
ami, que vous avez meme voulu honorer avec le 
titre de votre confrere dans la Societe Linneenne, a 
ktk.
pour moi tres flatteur, malgre que mes occupa- 
tions m'eussentdepuis long terns prive de l'honneur 
de vous £crire.
J'attens avec impatience les deux 
ouvrages de votre Tour sur le Continent, et des 
Lectures Botaniques, que vous avez la bonte de 
m'adresser, et que je n'ai point recu.
Je donne l'ordre 
a mon libraire a Londres pour votre magnifique 
ouvrage sur les Insectes de Georgia, que je n'avois 
point vu annonc£, ou que peutetre j'aurais oublie, 
car le regne animal a toujours eu moins d'interet 
pour moi, que les deux autres.
J'attens aussi le livre 
de Mr. Staunton, votre ami, dont j'ai lu quelques 
passages sur Madeira, Praya, et Rio de Janeiro, qui 
changeront maintenant en mieux par les soins eclai- 
res et par les ordres de mon auguste maitre, dont 
les vertus sont superieures a toute expression.
Votre amitie est la cause de l'illusion que vous vous 
faites pour mes foibles talens ; mais si je n'ai point 
des droits aux qualites que vous me supposez, au 
moins j'en ai a votre estime, car je prefererai a bien 
d'autres choses le doux plaisir d'aller vous voir a 
219 
Norwich avec M.
l'Abb£ Correa, et d'y parler sur les 
sciences, dont les progres devroient inteVesser bien 
plus le genre humain, que d'autres objets dont il ne 
retire aucun profit essentiel.
Les progres de la Societe Linneenne me font le 
plus grand plaisir, et je viens aussi de donner des 
ordres pour qu'on m'adresse tout ce qu'elle apublie.
Je n'ai point recti des nouvelles du Dr. Bellardi, 
qui pourroit bien venir ici s'il n'avoit point une si 
nombreuse famille, mais qui poursuit toujours ses 
travaux botaniques avec passion.
Daignez agreer les sentimens d'estime que je 
vous voue, et permettez que je fasse des vceux, 
pourque vous veniez un hiver herboriser en Portu- 
gal, et que je puisse de vive voix vous renouveller 
les assurances des sentimens d'estime et considera- 
tion avec lesquels j'ai l'honneur d'etre 
Votre tres humble et obeissant Serviteur, 
D. RODRIGO DE SoUSA CoUTINHO.
From the Abbe' Correct.
My dear Friend, London, Sept.
3, 1800.
Since you are determined to do our Academy the 
honour of writing a paper for her, I thank you for 
it, and will take proper care of forwarding it by a 
safe conveyance.
You are so good as to take notice of my horror 
of the Mazeutoxeron ; but I can tell you, that not 
only is your publication much anterior to that of 
La Billardiere, but that Jussieu is decided to sup- 
220 
port the old name.
Jussieu has written me a long 
friendly letter, and entreats me to make not only 
his compliments, but his excuses also to you for not 
writing to you as he wished.
Yours most sincerely, 
Joseph Correa de Serra.
Thus was his desire established; and still may each 
returning season perpetuate the memoryof the friend 
who conferred and the friend who accepted so beau- 
tiful a memorial !
In the world he had tribulation ; 
and whether real or ideal, the Abbe's sufferings excite 
our tenderest compassion, as he again appears under 
the influence of a power armed with most direful 
means of inflicting terror and despair.
From the same.
My dear Friend, London, Sept.
16, 1801.
When your letter of the 8th instant reached Lon- 
don I was in Birmingham, and this is my good ex- 
cuse for not sending a prompt answer.
The descrip- 
tion I had made of the Doryanthes I had long been 
at a loss to find again ; but to satisfy you, I have 
written it again in fewer words, and you will find it 
here inclosed, together with the two plates already 
engraved for it.
About my Excellency and my diplomacy I cannot 
tell you ; but there was no unluckier fatality than, 
after being six years out of Portugal in peace, to fall 
again in the clutches of the same family who had 
driven me from my country, after having brought 
221 
me to madness and lunacy.
All the ancient hatred, 
sanctified in their eyes by the motives you know, 
without any scruple about the means, for the same 
reason are and have been exerted by this monster 
of ambassador to effect my ruin, either by sending 
me back to Portugal, where the Duke of Lafoens is 
now in disgrace, or in England if he can.
I have 
been for many and many weeks almost driven to 
madness, living the greater part of the time with 
him, and have afterwards left him and given my 
resignation, which he did not choose to accept, but 
I have sent it directly to Portugal.
He is the son 
of the Marquis of Ponte de Lima, cousin to the 
Grand Inquisitor.
I am, my dear friend, in the 
situation of Laocoon when encircled and torn by 
the serpent, — and this is a poisonous one.
Believe me, I am most sincerely yours, 
Joseph Correa de Serra.
The Abbe's next letter, written twelve years after, 
is dated from America, whither he went in a high 
official capacity, as Portuguese minister plenipo- 
tentiary at Washington.
Dear Sir and Friend, Boston, Nov. 18, 18 is.
From what a distance do I address you at present !
but it is to send you not only the assurances of my 
unalterable friendship and respect for you, but also 
a compensation, and a thorough one, for my long 
silence, as time I am perfectly confident will show 
to you.
Botany is still in her infancy in America : some 
222 
amateurs are scattered through this continent ; and 
some European rather travelling gardeners than real 
hotanists are collecting plants and shrubs and trees 
for the gardens of European rich men, — or for the 
nurseries.
In the two years that I have lived and 
travelled in the United States, I have found only a 
man*, and a young one too, a physician of this town, 
who shows a true botanic genius and great zeal for 
science ; he has already acquired a great scientific 
knowledge, only aided by his industry and the limited 
number of botanic books which the country affords.
He will be I am confident an illustrious botanist, if 
he is put in correspondence with the chiefs of the 
science, and helped by their knowledge in the doubts 
that he may encounter.
I am persuaded I do a great service to botany as well 
as to him by introducing him to you, our venerable 
patriarch.
By fostering his efforts, and by resolving 
his doubts, you will I am sure in a few years bring 
forth more thorough knowledge of North American 
plants than we have hitherto had.
He will write to 
you and send this little memorandum.
His name 
is Dr. Bigelow, and his fixed residence Boston.
If I live some years, I am confident you will thank 
me, in the name of the botanic church, for having 
been instrumental to open this correspondence.
From Philadelphia I intend to write to you and 
send you some few things.
Farewell till then !
Most sincerely yours, 
Joseph Correa de Serra.
* Dr. Mulilenburg excepted.

The Abba's latest letters have the date of 1821, 
when he was again in England, and then preparing 
to take a voyage to the Brazils, whither he was ap- 
pointed by the King of Portugal to superintend 
the sciences and arts, and to a very honourable 
and lucrative situation.
Dear Sir and Friend, London, July 23, 1821.
I promised you a letter before my leaving En- 
gland, and I keep my word.
The day after to-mor- 
row I go to Falmouth to embark in the packet de- 
stined to sail the 29th or 30th of this month, and 
hope to be in Lisbon by the 10th of August, if not 
before.
It will be a new sight for me, after twenty- 
six years and five months absence.
All is changed : 
God grant it may be for the better !
My health is 
very precarious still, but on the whole is ameliorated, 
and my impatience raises my spirits.
I beg you to 
present my compliments to Lady Smith, and for you 
my best wishes for your happiness, peace, and long 
life.
You see by the erratas of this letter, the state 
of weariness which my mind is in this moment, by 
the little teasing numberless details concomitant to 
a dbntnagement, that may be called the horrors of 
removal.
At all times and in every country be sure 
of finding in me an obliged and grateful friend, 
and an obedient, faithful servant.
Joseph Correa de Serra.
Soon after this period the venerable Abbe" re- 
224 
turned in very ill health to his native country, and 
died at Lisbon in 1823.
In reference to a foregoing letter, dated July 4, 
17^5, the two following ones are added for a further 
illustration of the same subject.
They are from the 
hand of the learned and elegant scholar Dr. Frank 
Sayers, of Norwich.
Dear Sir, Sept.
12, 1808.
The discussion into which you were so obliging 
as to enter yesterday evening, induced me to look 
a little more for the earliest meaning of the word 
Kva/uoc.
I do not find that it is used more than once 
by Homer in the Iliad or Odyssey ; the passage 
which I noticed to you yesterday in the Iliad (v.
5 89) 
is thus translated, I find, by Damm (in his celebrated 
Lexic.
Homeric?) : "A ventilabro in area saliunt fabae 
fuscsB et pisa — nam color harum fabarum est fuscus 
et rufus." The same writer translates Kva/uoc, " faba 
maxime ea species quam Germani walsche bonen, 
vulgo saubonen vocant, et quas Graeci vooKvafiovc 
appellant." In the Batrachomyomachia (of which 
the a?ra however, as you well know, is somewhat 
uncertain,) the word Kva/^oc again occurs : — in the 
arming of the Mice it is said, 1.
123, 
Kitj^iicas fxev Trpwra 7repi Krrjfiriaiv edrjKav 
'Vfj^aires Kva/xovs xXtopovs, €vt arTKr)oovres.
The Kva/uoc, thus ingeniously used for greaves by the 
mice, must of course have been of the shape of some 
of our ordinary beans.
The common meaning of 
nvapoc, then, before the time of Pythagoras is thus 
225 
sufficiently plain.
It appears, too, from the use of the 
word Kvafioc in the writings of Plato, Aristotle, and 
others of about the same aera, that this ancient 
sense of Kvafioc was retained in the time of Theo- 
phrastus (as in fact it was always), and possibly he 
may have been the person who first extended the 
name of Kva/moc to the Nymph&a Nelumbo, and may 
thus have thrown the light which you so skilfully 
discovered upon the precept of Pythagoras.
In Suidas and Julius Pollux I find no hint of the 
Nelumbo under the head of Kvafioc.
Suidas has 
Kva/^oc, €i$oq oairpiov.
Pollux also enumerates the 
Kva/jLoc, among the oairpia or legumina, and says Kva/noi 
ol Km irvafxoi.
Hesychius makes it an oorrpiov, but in 
a note to him (from Eustathius) is added KaXovpevov 
KoXoKaaiov.
In Athenaeus, however, I find mention made not 
only of ordinary kvo/hoi eaten at feasts, but also of 
the Kva/uioQ Aiyv7TTioc, of which he gives a descrip- 
tion extracted from Theophrastus (viz.
that of the 
Nymphaa Nelumbo, not of the Lotus) ; he also 
quotes Nicander, who recommends the sowing of 
this Kvafxoc AtyuTTTioc, saying that garlands may be 
made of its flowers, and that its fruit and roots may 
be eaten.
This Nicander (who was certainly no Py- 
thagorean) lived about 137 B.C. In his time then, 
and probably before, (but how long before I know 
not,) the Nymphaa Nelumbo was known as a plant 
fit for food, and the name nvapoc was commonly af- 
fixed to it, perhaps taken from Theophrastus.
The only apology which I have to make for send- 
ing you these crudities, is the desire which I felt to 
vol.
ii.
a 
226 
make you sonic slight return for the amusement 
and instruction which I yesterday received from you.
I am, dear Sir, 
Yours most truly, 
F. Sayers.
I must leave our learned friend to settle the ety- 
mology of Manioc, as I am not fluent either in the 
Coptic or Cushite.
Herodotus, when he mentions 
that the Egyptians did not eat the Kvafxoc, and that 
the priests thought it unclean (ov KaOapoc), uses the 
word oairpiov in the same paragraph as including 
the KvapoQ.
Prom the same.
Dear Sir, Close, Oct. 3, 1808.
Since I had the pleasure of sending you a few 
passages which I had hastily collected respecting the 
Kva/iioQ of the ancients, a supposition has occurred to 
me, by which I think some of the difficulties arising 
on that subject might possibly be removed.
I have 
therefore thought proper to trouble you with it.
As we have found no Greek writer, prior to Theo- 
phrastus, who has used the word Kva/xoc with any 
any other meaning than that of the ordinary legu- 
men so called, — doe3 it not appear possible that 
the Hindu Kva/noc (or Nymphaa Nelumbo) may have 
heen first imported from the East, at the time of the 
conquests of Alexander P Might not even the king 
himself have ordered so celebrated a plant (and pro- 
bably other curious natural productions) to have 
227 
been sent to his preceptor Aristotle, from whom a 
knowledge of it would have been readily obtained 
by Theophrastus ?
But without supposing any in- 
terference of the conqueror himself, specimens of 
such a striking vegetable as the Nymphcea Nelumbo 
could hardly fail of finding their way to Greece from 
the East.
Its introduction into Egypt may, I think, 
be similarly accounted for, and may be reasonably 
fixed at about the same period.
The Kva^oc men- 
tioned by Herodotus as being held in abomination 
by the Egyptians, is certainly not the Nymphcea Ne- 
lumbo, I conceive ; he expressly calls it an ocnrpiov, and 
the circumstance of its being held in abomination, 
of its being deemed ov KaOapoc, sufficiently points 
out that it could never have been the holy, adorable 
Nymphaa of India.
Herodotus, then, knew nothing 
of any other kind of Kvapoc in Egypt than of the 
ordinary bean.
But the Nymphcea Nelumbo might 
very probably have been introduced into Egypt 
about the time of the first Ptolemy : to Nicander, 
who lived at Alexandria under the seventh Ptole- 
my, it would of course be known ; but it might still 
be so little cultivated as to induce him to insist upon 
its excellence in his Georgics.
What effect this 
exportation might have, I know not; but the culti- 
vation of the Nymphcea Nelumbo appears to have 
continued in Egypt in the time of Pliny, who men- 
tions two genera of Egyptiany#&E, one of which he 
calls " rotundius et nigrius ;" this I conceive to be 
the Nelumbo: the other kind I presume was the 
ordinary Kva/moc of Herodotus.
If the above hypo- 
thesis be true, it is certainly somewhat unfavourable 
gl2 
223 
to your supposition of Pythagoras having borrowed 
his precept from Egypt, — supposing it, I mean, to 
apply to the Nymphaa Nelumbo: in case of its so ap- 
plying, Pythagoras must I think have taken it direct 
from India.
But it appears to me more probable 
that he did borrow it from Egypt, and applied it (as 
the Egyptians themselves seem to have done,) to the 
ordinary Kva/uoc (of the time of Herodotus).
Upon 
this supposition the precept itself would have been 
very intelligible to the followers of Pythagoras (al- 
though the reasons for it were not understood) ; but 
if it contained any allusion to the Nymphaa Nelum- 
bo, such allusion must have been totally obscure and 
unavailing to the inhabitants of a country where 
that plant appears to have been unknown.
I am, dear Sir, 
Yours very truly, 
F. Sayers.
The beautiful plant which has led the botanist and 
scholar into this elaborate disquisition, was figured 
in Exotic Botany under the name of Cyamus Ne- 
lumbo, the Sacred Bean of Iridia, tab.
31, 32.
It 
is denominated Kva/xoa by Theophrastus ; Ny?n- 
phaa Nelumbo, by Linnaeus and Aiton ; Nyjnphaa 
indica major, by Rumphius ; Nelumbo nucifera, by 
Gaertner ; Nelumbium speciosum, by Willdenow ; 
and Tamara, by Rheede.
Those who do not possess 
the Exotic Botany may not be displeased to hear 
Sir James Smith's reasoning concerning the name 
and character of this celebrated plant.
"Germen superior, green, smooth, inversely coni- 
229 
cal, its upper broad flat surface perforated with se- 
veral holes, opening into as many cells.
Each cell 
contains the rudiment of a seed, protruding through 
the orifice, and crowned with an oblong, obtuse, 
perforated, yellow, permanent stigma.
The whole 
germen becomes a coriaceous entire capsule, which 
in process of time separates from the stalk, laden 
with ripe oval nuts, and floats down the water.
The 
nuts vegetating, it becomes a cornucopia of young 
sprouting plants, which at length break loose from 
their confinement, and take root in the mud.
This 
peculiar mode of propagation has evidently occa- 
sioned the plant, in conjunction with water, to be 
adopted as the symbol of fertility, in which point of 
view it has, from the remotest antiquity, been con- 
sidered with religious veneration in India, and 
makes a conspicuous figure in the mythology of 
that ancient country.
It is most generally known 
to the learned of Europe under the name of Lotus ; 
the natives of Hindustan call it TamarA; the people 
of Ceylon Nelumbo.
It has been confounded by 
very able writers, even lately, with the Lotus of 
Egypt, NymphtEa Lotus of Linnaeus ; see Andr.
Repos.
t. 391, and Curt.
Mag. t.
797.
We pre- 
sume the latter to have become important in the 
Egyptian mythology, only as a substitute for the 
former.
The Lotus of Egypt is a real Nymphcea, 
bearing its seeds much in the manner of a Poppy, 
and scattering them in the mud.
There is nothing 
peculiar in its appearance or mode of growth which 
could have caused it to be chosen for an emblem of 
fertility, were it not from the general resemblance of 
230 
its leaves and flowers to our plant, the original Lo- 
tus of India.
Hence I have for some time presumed 
to deduce an argument in support of the doctrine, 
now prevalent on other grounds, that the religion 
of the Egyptians was adopted from the East.
" Innumerable illustrations respecting the Ta- 
?»ara, Lotus, or Nelumbo, as connected with the 
poetry or religion of the Hindus, may be found in 
the learned works of Sir W.
Jones, Mr. Knight, and 
others.
In the fourth volume of the Amcenitates 
j4cade7?iic(£, p.
234, a carved horn of a rhinoceros, 
sent to Linnaeus from China, is described.
This is 
now before me, and is an exquisite specimen of 
Oriental sculpture, evidently alluding to the mytho- 
logy of India.
The whole inverted base of the horn is 
carved into an elegant leaf of Nelumbo, rising from 
the water amid a group of perforated Chinese rocks.
It is encompassed with various plants of a more 
diminutive proportion ; a peach tree and a medlar 
(or rather perhaps the mangostan), with Sagittaria, 
Potkos, and the Nelumbo itself in flower and seed, 
cover the outer surface.
Some fantastic lizards, 
with bunches of grapes and the Lit-che fruit in 
their mouths, are crawling over the whole.
" We have to add some remarks on the botanical 
characters and name of this plant.
" Adanson, Gaertner, Jussieu and Willdenow are 
most unquestionably justified in separating it from 
Nymphma, with which Linnaeus and other writers 
have confounded it.
The very peculiar fruit, unlike 
anything else in the vegetable kingdom, and the 
stigmas, so totally different from those of Nym- 
231 
phcea, sufficiently distinguish it.
The chief question 
in dispute is the name.
Nelumbium is formed from 
7ielumboy a Ceylon word of very confined use.
If it 
must have a barbarous appellation, Tamard would 
be preferable, as being in general use among the 
learned and the vulgar throughout Hindustan.
Hap- 
pily we have no occasion to adopt either, for the 
plant has already a classical Greek name of primary 
authority and antiquity, being the real KvapoQ of 
Theophrastus ; and therefore the word Cyamus is 
what by every right and title belongs to it.
Ne- 
lumbo may be retained as a specific name, rather out 
of deference to Linnaeus and Gaertner than for any 
good reason ; for Tamard, being more universal, 
would be more proper; and speciosus, given by Will- 
denow, more expressive.
We wish however to re- 
spect the right of priority, and to avoid all needless 
changes.
" We claim no merit in the restoration of this 
ancient generic name.
Bodaeus AStapel in his Com- 
mentary on Theophrastus, p.
446, and Hermann in 
his Paradisus Batavus have amply illustrated the 
subject ; and others, as Plukenet, have alluded to 
it.
But it is remarkable that no recent writer on 
the mythological history of the Nelumbo should 
have been aware of its being the celebrated Kvaftoc 
or Pythagorean bean, which is so evident from the 
description in Theophrastus.
The * cellular head 
like a round wasp's nest, with a bean in each cell 
projecting a little beyond its orifice ; the rose-co- 
loured flower twice as large as a poppy,' as well as 
all the rest of his account, are strikingly character- 
232* 
istic.
By this discovery many things, hitherto dif- 
ficult of explanation, are elucidated.
We can no 
longer wonder at the prohibition of these beans to 
the Egyptian priests or the disciples of Pythagoras.
A plant consecrated to religious veneration as an 
emblem of reproduction and fertility, would be very 
improper for the food, or even the consideration, 
of persons dedicated to peculiar purity.
The Egyp- 
tian priests were not allowed even to look upon it.
Authors scarcely explain sufficiently whether Py- 
thagoras avoided it from respect or abhorrence.
However that might be, we need not, in order to 
ascertain his motives, have recourse to any of the 
five reasons supposed by Aristotle, nor to the con- 
jectures of Cicero.
Neither can there be any doubt 
that the prohibition given by Pythagoras was literal; 
and not merely allegorical, as forbidding his follow- 
ers to eat this kind of pulse because the magistrates 
in some places were chosen by a ballot with black 
and white beans, thereby giving them to understand 
that they should not meddle with public affairs.
Such far-fetched explanations show the ingenuity 
of commentators rather than their knowledge.
As 
the Pythagorean prohibitions are now obsolete, per- 
haps these beans, imported from India, might not 
be unwelcome at our tables.
The root of the Cya- 
mus is also used as food, but we have many vege- 
tables preferable to it." 
In some unfinished notes upon the subject of 
monumental inscriptions, which Sir James Smith 
233 
left, he speaks of the elegant memorial of Pope Ur- 
ban in the Augustine church at Rome.

the Queen of Portugal, had no weight against monk- 
ish fanaticism, which would by no means connive 
at such a compliment to a heretic ; and the monu- 
ment was never executed."

scriptions prompted by affection for departed worth ; 
— one only shall appear in this place.

consists in its being perfectly just and appropriate.

From Sir Thomas Gage*.
Florence, Casa Dini Borgo Santa Croce, 
My dear Sir James, June Li, 1817.
I have for a very long time had in my possession 
the books from Mr. Targioni, which I have at last 
* Of Hengrave Hall in the county of Suffolk, Bart.
Sir Tho- 
mas Gage died at Rome on the 27th of December, 1820, in the 
40th year of his age, and was buried there in the chiesa del Gesu.
" Enthusiasm and delicacy distinguished his character, and were 
blended in a manner as happy as unusual.
Had these been sup- 
ported by strong health, there was no perfection in art or science 
to which he would not have been capable of attaining.
His tastes 
and pursuits were all elegant.
Whatever he said or did was emi- 
nently marked by gentlemanly feelings.
It was both from nature 
and from cultivation, and scarcely less from cultivation than from 
nature, that he possessed a tact, which, while it was essential to 
the pursuit of botany, his favourite science, rendered him trem- 
blingly alive to the beauties of art and the more sublime charms 
of creation.
In the more abstruse parts of the vegetable world 
he had laboured hard, by the lamp as well as the sun ; studying 
the works of his predecessors in his closet, and exploring the 
objects themselves in the fields." — History and Antiquities oj 
Hengrave.
236 
found the opportunity of sending by a friend ; — 
chances of this sort are rare, and I would not trust 
them to the merchants, having myself lost a packet 
by this means.
I ought also long since to have 
written to you ; but the account I could have given 
of myself, till within these few months, was such 
.that it would neither have given pleasure to my 
friends nor myself.
I am happy now to be able to 
say, that I have escaped from a very serious state of 
ill health ; and am far better than when I last had 
the pleasure of seeing you.
I have not neglected my botanical pursuits, and 
have made great additions, particularly to my Cryp- 
togamia.
I have collected everything of that kind 
I could meet with here, and have purchased a very 
fine collection, particularly of Lichens, from Schlei- 
cher of Bex, whose list I send you.
His price is so 
moderate and his specimens so good, that, should 
you or any botanical friend desire to have anything 
from him, I would readily undertake to procure it.
He sends me constantly specimens as well to pur- 
chase as to determine ; and I am much advanced in 
my drawing to illustrate Acharius.
The present 
state of botany at Florence is respectable, but not 
much encouraged.
The Grand Duke is fond of 
plants, and has lately purchased a copy of English 
Botany ; and I believe some other works, of which 
I furnished a list.
He has built a fine range of 
stoves and houses in the Boboli garden, where many 
good plants are cultivated, though it cannot be con- 
sidered a regular botanical garden, the best plants 
237 
having been removed a few years since to the new 
Orto Fisico under the care of Mr. Targioni, which 
is a liberal establishment and an extensive ground 
well laid out, a part being destined for agricultural 
experiments.
There is a want of glass, but improve- 
ments are making, and the collection of plants in- 
creases.
Mr. Targioni is a man of much acuteness, 
and has great love for science, and of a most amia- 
ble disposition, and highly liberal in communicating".
I have not only had the advantage of selecting spe- 
cimens from the garden, but also of examining all 
the Lie hens, to the number of several hundred, in the 
rich herbarium of Micheli, and of taking what spe- 
cimens I pleased ; I have therefore verified all the 
synonyms of that author, and made out a list for 
Mr. Targioni of the Acharian names.
Agricultural 
and botanical lectures in the Linnsean system are 
given at stated periods, both at the garden and the 
academy of the Georgofili.
Mr. Targioni's son is 
professor of chemistry, and is a good entomologist.
At the head of the Royal Museum, which is a 
magnificent establishment, especially in minerals, is 
Mr. Radi, a young man of the first talents, indefa- 
tigable as a botanist, and in every branch of natural 
history, of which he has more practical knowledge 
than any person I have ever known.
We are con- 
stant companions, and make excursions into the 
mountains occasionally.
I have been able to assist 
him in the Lichens, so that now he has become 
well acquainted with all the Cryptogamia of the 
country.
He had already discovered new Mosses, 
particularly the Fabronia pusilla, of which genus 
238 
Swartz has found another specimen.
He is now 
engaged in publishing an account of the Junger- 
mannia of this country on a new system, which will 
appear shortly, and of which I hope to send you a 
copy.
I wish to engage him in a pocket Flora Tos- 
cana, in hopes to encourage the same spirit which 
has so contributed to botanical knowledge at home.
Here there is little taste of that kind; for the nobles 
are not rich enough to purchase science, nor wise 
enough to esteem it.
There are some exceptions : 
the Princess Corsini has a good collection of plants, 
as also the Marquisses Feroni and Pucci.
Nothing 
is published here in the way of natural history.
At 
Pisa Mr. Sair has begun a Flora Ftrusca, which has 
great merit, but advances slowly.
It is a rich coun- 
try in every branch, and deserves to be well known.
Though I was very ill when I crossed Mount Ce- 
nis, I collected several rare plants, and I thought of 
you when I found Cetraria cucullata near the Hos- 
pice, as mentioned in your Tour.
My residence in this city has been pleasant 
enough, particularly since my health is improved, 
and it is not my intention to leave it before the 
month of October, when we talk of going to Rome.
The quantity of English who have been here du- 
ring the winter has been excessive, though I by no 
means think it a good place for a delicate constitu- 
tion at that season.
The air is very damp, and I 
should think bad ; most of the houses in the lower 
parts of the town having stagnant water under them, 
and the changes from heat to cold are rapid and se- 
vere.
Violent inflammations are very frequent, and 
239 
we have had a had typhus fever, which has caused 
great mortality among the lower classes, chiefly 
owing to the badness of the crops of last year, and 
the want of food in the mountains.
It is now sub- 
siding, and the mal aria fortunately does not extend 
to Florence.
Lady Mary Anne and our children 
have enjoyed constant good health ; the latter are 
grown stronger since they left England.
I ought not to forget to thank you for the con- 
sequences of the letters you were so kind as to give 
me.
At Geneva I got acquainted with several per- 
sons of science, as Mr. Pictet, MM.
Jurine and 
Morricand ; at Turin by chance with Professor Bi- 
roli of the garden ; and at Milan I delivered your 
letter to Oriani, and was made known to Mr. Her- 
man of the garden and Mr. Breislach, the minera- 
logist, who gave me a letter for Mr. Targioni.
I 
was obliged to send yours to the Marquis Ippolito 
Durazzo, whose sister is here, married to the Sar- 
dinian minister Brignoli, — a very amiable family.
After proving myself so bad a correspondent, 
it would be very unreasonable for me to hope to 
trespass on your time, which is so much better em- 
ployed ; but should you find a leisure moment, I 
should feel very great pleasure in knowing you and 
Lady Smith are well, as also in hearing anything 
concerning Mr. Turner, Borrer, or any of our F.L.S.
who may ever think of me.
I am, my dear Sir, 
Yours very sincerely, 
Thomas Gage.

From His Excellency De Witt Clinton, LL.D. Go- 
vernor of the State of New York, and President 
of the Literary and Philosophical Society there.
Sir, Utica, July 18, 1817.
A few days ago a farmer stopt with his waggon 
at a house in the village of Rome, about fifteen 
miles from this place.
A respectable gentleman, 
who was conversing with him on business, observed 
among some hay, lying in the waggon, a few stalks 
of a strange plant, inquired what they were ; and on 
being told that they were wild wheat, and were cut 
with common grass in a beaver meadow and on a wet 
soil in the town of Western in this county, he took 
out a few grains, and gave them to an honest and 
industrious farmer in his vicinity, who planted them 
in his garden.
The second crop produced about a 
peck of grain, which yielded upwards of twenty 
bushels the third year.
Wheat of the same species 
has also been found in a wild state in a swamp co- 
vered with trees near Rome.
It is said to differ from 
the common wheat in a variety of respects, — in the 
compactness of the stalk, in the largeness of its 
leaves, in the peculiar position of beards at the apex 
of the head, which is in all other respects bald, and 
in its superior height, being considerably taller.
Since the comparative scarcity of snow, which for- 
merly served as a protection against the attacks of 
frost, our wheat has suffered severely by what the 
farmers denominate winter-killing.
Our ground 
241 
freezes during the winter about a foot and half in 
depth.
When the sun resumes its vernal power, a 
partial thaw of two inehes takes place in the course 
of the day ; and owing to the porosity and hollow- 
ness of the common wheat, the water is absorbed 
in it.
On the return of night, the ground is again 
frozen, and then the expansive power of frost pro- 
duces the destruction of the plant, by eradicating it, 
or breaking the roots to pieces, and bursting the stalk 
where the water has penetrated.
Rye is not affected 
in this way, because it is not so permeable by water, 
and because its roots are stronger, more elastic, and 
strike deeper into the earth.
In like manner the 
wild wheat of Oneida County is said to resist the 
power of frost ; and this is imputed to the same 
causes which protect the rye.
As I am persuaded that the history which I have 
given of this wheat is substantially correct, it pre- 
sents a very interesting subject for investigation.
Is 
it indigenous, or was it originally imported wheat, 
and accidentally conveyed to the places where it 
was found?
If the former, it is the very grain which 
nature created for our soil and climate.
If the lat- 
ter, it has been evidently improved by its wild state 
and spontaneous growth; — a circumstance of an 
anomalous character, and contrary to the usual 
course of nature.
Although I am not prepared to give a decided 
opinion on this subject, yet I may be permitted to 
observe, that there are cogent arguments against 
the latter hypothesis.
The plant was found in a 
VOL.
II.
R 
2 t2 
swamp and in a meadow, and appears to delight in 
a wet soil, which is not congenial with the common 
wheat.
It presents not only a different aspect, hut 
seems to have peculiar and characteristic qualities.
Linnseus, if I remember rightly, made six species 
of Ti^iticum.
Sixteen species are now enumerated, 
besides varieties ; and these are found in the most 
diversified climates : the Murwaary Wheat of Bar- 
bary ; the Spring Wheat of Siberia ; the Spelter of 
Germany ; the Wheat of Egypt, of Switzerland, of 
Poland, and of Sicily, cannot be derived from the 
same country.
Ceres, who, according to the hea- 
then mythology, discovered corn, was said to have 
had her principal seat in Sicily ; but this granary 
of the ancient world has no exclusive claims to the 
most important of the Cerealia.
The Frome?it tre- 
mais, which arrives at maturity in these marshes, is 
as different from the other kinds of Triticum, as it is 
possible for different species to be ; and it unques- 
tionably could not have had an identity of local 
origin with them.
I have been a long time of opinion, that many of 
our native plants have been improperly considered 
as naturalized ; and as I am anxious to claim the 
most important culmiferous plant as an indigenous 
production, I have no hesitation in denominating 
this wheat, discovered near Rome, Triticum ameri- 
canum.
I also transmit by this opportunity specimens of 
a plant called the Wild Rye, which grows sponta- 
neously and in considerable quantities in the coun- 
243 
try bordering on the upper parts of the Mohawk 
River ; and I believe it might be cultivated to ad- 
vantage.
The opinion on this subject of such an eminent 
botanist as yourself will be very acceptable.
Yours most respectfully, 
De Witt Clinton.
P.S. To hear from you will always be acceptable.
Nothing would give me more gratification than to 
see the distinguished proprietor of Holkham, whose 
name, as well as that of Sir J.
E. Smith, is highly 
appreciated in this country.
But I am unfortunately 
denied this pleasure at present.
From the Rev. R.
IValpole.
My dear Sir, Aylsham, Dec. 8, 1817.
Can you give me any information from your own 
or Sibthorp's sources respecting Greek melons?
I 
find in a work I have been lately reading, that our 
melons were known to the Greeks and Romans : 
2i/o»oc, it appears, was the genus, the species being 
Melo, Melopepon, and our cucumber.
The Melo- 
pepon is what the French call Sucrin : what is our 
word corresponding to Sucrin} There is a passage 
in Galen which clearly distinguishes the Melopepon 
and the Pepon ; after citing it, my author says, "ex 
hoc loco patet pepones Galeni esse nostros ?nelones, 
8fc." Aristotle, he adds, knew them well ; for he 
asks (Prol.
1. 20), Start oi o'ikvoi ireirovea apiaroi yiy- 
vovrai ev to7q eXwSem 7re8totc ovaiv evvypoic, oiov irepi

'Opypneyov k<x\ cv Aiyinrrto, — Why the host melons are 
produced in marshy and moist places, as about Or- 
chomenus (in Bceotia) and in Egypt.
Will you be kind enough to favour me with a 
line at your leisure ; — and believe me to be, dear Sir, 
Yours very faithfully, 
Rob. Walpole.
Sir J.
E. Smith to Dr. JVallich.
Dear Sir, Liverpool, Sept.
16, 1813.
Your most polite and obliging letter of the 12th 
of January last (accompanied with those of Colonel 
Hardwicke and Mr. Loring,) did not reach me till 
a few days before I left home for this place.
I hnd 
letters are readily sent to India from hence, and 
therefore I will not delay thanking you for your li- 
beral offers of communication, in which I fear I 
shall be the chief gainer, unless you have any bo- 
tanical doubts or queries which you think I may 
have a chance of solving.
Nothing could be more 
desirable to me than to receive from you dried spe- 
cimens for my herbarium, especially of any of your 
new or rare plants.
I am particularly desirous of 
Scitaminece, Orchidece, Liliacece, which experienced 
botanists now learn to dry well, but which, being 
rather difficult, have formerly been given up in de- 
spair by collectors, and are rare in herbariums : — I 
find a weak solution of corrosive sublimate, with a 
little camphor dissolved in it, preserves dried plants 
from the attacks of all insects.
My whole Linnaean 
herbarium is thus poisoned, by means of a camel- 
245 
hair pencil ; but the specimens must first be dried 
thoroughly.
I long much for specimens of Dr. Rox- 
burgh's Aeginetia and any Orobanche, or plant of the 
parasitic kind, which cannot be cultivated here.
You see, my good Sir, how ready I am to grasp at 
your kind offers.
I trust you will not find me less 
willing to fulfill my part of the treaty, and I beg you 
will send me anything that is doubtful or difficult.
You may depend on my not telling more than I 
know; for if I find difficulties, I will freely confess 
my ignorance.
The Linnsean Society will be very 
happy to receive any communication from you, and 
also to have you enrolled on our list of Fellows, 
whenever you may be pleased to permit it : Colonel 
Hardwicke will inform you of the laws and obliga- 
tions.
I take the liberty of inclosing a letter for 
this worthy friend of mine, and one for Archdeacon 
Loring.
I am extremely happy to find you are in corre- 
spondence with my valued friend Mr. Roscoe, and 
also with Mr. Shepherd of the botanic garden here, 
no less excellent in his way.
The latter has a ne- 
phew who is very expert in raising ferns from seed, 
and you will render a great service to botany in 
sending him fragments of any of that tribe with 
fructification in a ripe state.
I received one of your rich packets of seeds, and 
after letting Mr. Shepherd take his choice, I have 
divided the rest among several friends, particularly 
the worthy Bishop of Winchester, who propagates 
the Cinnamon-tree by seeds ripened in his own 
hot-houses !
The other packet, containing the Bhn- 
246 
dodendrum arboreum, and the new white-flowered 
species, &c, has not yet reached me.
I remain, with much respect, &c.
J. E.
Smith.
From Dr. IVallich.
Botanic Garden, Calcutta, July 24, 1819.
Dear Sir, 
Although it is only a short time since I had the 
honour of answering your favour of the 16th of 
September, and transmitting a parcel of specimens, 
I feel confident that you will please to pardon my 
thus early intruding on your time, especially in so 
voluminous a shape as this sheet exhibits, which 
Mrs. Archdeacon Loring has kindly supplied from 
the stores which she has received from her father, 
for the express purpose of writing on their single- 
sheet letters, without any risk of surcharge from the 
post-office.
My long expected regular supplies of Napal spe- 
cimens have at last arrived from Katmandu, after I 
had almost despaired of their reaching me in safety, 
if at all ; and in so beautiful a condition, and such 
vast numbers, as to enable me to have the honour 
of presenting you, Sir J.
Banks, Mr. Lambert, and 
Mr. Rudge with abundance of plants from that 
highly interesting country.
This large collection, 
which has been made entirely by my faithful and 
deserving men, stationed under the protection of 
the resident at Katmandu, during the latter end 
of 1817 and the whole of 1818, arrived in boats 
247 
from a place near the frontiers Segowly ; and so 
anxious was I to avert the ruin which would inevi- 
tably result, were the specimens allowed to remain 
in Bengal during the rains, which have been pour- 
ing down latterly in excessive quantities, that I have 
been at work since the arrival of the boxes (on the 
4th inst.), in order that the dispatches might be in 
time prepared for embarkation on the Blenheim.
The circumstance of my having used the shortest 
possible time for arranging the specimens to avoid 
the dangers which such extensive collections would 
be exposed to from the extreme wetness of the pre- 
sent season, will, I flatter myself with the hope, at 
once account and apologize for the fewness of the 
labels which have been attached to the individual 
species ; at the same time it will evince to you how 
gratefully sensible I am of the high honour you have 
conferred on me, by granting me the privilege of 
corresponding with the first and most illustrious 
botanist of the age.
Accept, dear Sir, again and 
again, my warmest and most respectful thanks for 
so flattering a distinction, — a distinction which I 
have so long felt ambitious of enjoying ; and do me 
the justice to believe, that I shall incessantly endea- 
vour to show myself not wholly unworthy of your 
kindness.
The tribute of respect and gratitude 
which I have now the satisfaction of presenting to 
you, I trust may not prove unacceptable, and I am 
not without hopes even of its containing some speci- 
mens 7iot included in that splendid collection which 
my most esteemed friend and predecessor Dr. Ha- 
milton (Buchanan) presented to you from the same 
quarter.
248 
At the close of this year another invoice will be 
sent down to nic ; partly collected by my own peo- 
ple, and partly by those of my valuable corre- 
spondent and friend Mr. Robert Stuart, at present 
acting British resident at the court of the Rajah of 
Napal, of which, of course, a large proportion shall 
be forwarded to you in due time.
Besides the speci- 
mens which I am daily receiving from thence, the 
most astonishing treasures arc frequently sent to 
me from Mr. R.
Colquhoun*, from the province of 
Kamaon ; from Dr. G.
Govan, the intelligent su- 
perintendent of the botanic garden at Sahrunpore; 
from Dr. Gerard at Nahn, and other elevated tracts ; 
from Captain Webb at Srinaghur, with whom also is 
stationed a collecting party, which has within these 
few days transmitted to me some very fine packets, 
containing many of the beauties recorded in the sixth 
volume of the Asiatic Researches, by my inestimable 
benefactor and friend Colonel Hardwicke.
From all these stupendously high countries bor- 
dering on the snowy mountains, you may rest as- 
sured that supplies shall be sent to you ; so that I 
may indulge a hope that a number of new plants 
may in time be added to your splendid herbarium, 
" haud sine veneratione gumma adeundum," to use 
the words of DeCandolle, in the preface to his 
matchless work Hegni Veget.
Syst.
A 7 at., which I 
had the happiness to receive yesterday from Mr.
Lambert.
I ought not to omit mentioning two other sources ; 
namely, the expedition of my excellent friend Dr.
Moorcroftjwhohas set out on an arduous tour to the 
* Now Sir R.
Cnlquhoun, Bart, 
249 
north and west, and has taken two of my plant col- 
lectors with him, and Singapore in Sumatra, from 
whence I expect extensive collections from my highly 
valued friend Mr. W.
Jack, the personal surgeon to 
Sir Stamford Raffles, who has already favoured me 
with ample harvests of rare and interesting plants 
gathered by him at Penang.
A letter from Sir Stam- 
ford which I got yesterday has already prepared me 
for the arrival of some highly curious things, amongst 
them a new Nepenthes, of exquisite beauty and gigan- 
tic dimensions, parallel in its enormous size to the 
marvellous flower, measuring in circumference six 
feet !
* found last year in a tour through the island 
of Sumatra, and of which an account has, I learn, 
been sent to Sir Joseph Banks.
Lastly, I expect 
large additions from an expedition sent up to Gos- 
sain Than {alias Neel-Khaunt), by Mr. Robert 
Stuart, from Katmandu, for the express purpose of 
investigating the natural productions of that part of 
the Himalaya or snowy range of mountains, and of 
collecting specimens and seeds for me.
I beg you will pardon the length of this digres- 
sion, which has entirely originated from my anxious 
wish of becoming a not altogether unprofitable cor- 
respondent and contributor.
A good number of the plants in your chest 
(which I beg leave to observe are all natives of and 
collected in Napal, at and about Katmandu,) I have 
named in my dispatches to England; so that you 
will meet with abundant, and I fear but too numerous 
occasions for correcting my errors and mistaken 
* Rafflesia /Inioldi.
250 
notions ; a favour which your generous offer induces 
me to solicit, and which will lay me under infinite 
obligations.
I entreat and beseech you to grant 
this my earnest request, thereby enabling me to 
judge with precision of the nature of the specimens 
I may have the satisfaction of presenting to you.
Among the contents of the chest you will find a 
number of Scitaminea, of which you will be glad to 
hear.
I have this very day the following species in 
the fullest blossom in the garden : — Hedychium 
coccineum,ISuch.,id.
var.
carneum mihi, both of them 
inconceivably grand ; H.jlavum, Roxb.
; H.
ellipti- 
cu?n, Buch., a most superb species ; H.
spicatum, 
Buch., the flowers of which are most delightfully per- 
fumedjlike the carnation and Echites caryophyllata ; 
— all these are in profuse blossom with me, together 
with H.
coro?ia?
, ium?md a?igustifolium,H.
The name 
of the last is not so well adapted, because there is a 
more distinct character in the leaves, — their disti- 
chous position, which would have at once afforded a 
name and a specific difference.
This species (angusiifoliujii) and coccineum are 
very much alike in stature and inflorescence ; the 
former differs chiefly in its more rigid and perfectly 
distichous leaves.
JRoscoea, so beautifully repre- 
sented in your Exotic Botany, is also in flower, 
which, however, are of a very pale blueish colour, 
precisely like those of Kaempferia rotunda.
I have 
a vast number of plants of every individual species 
above mentioned, of which, immediately after the 
rains, I shall do myself the pleasure to send you a 
share.
There are likewise in your chest of speci- 
251 
mens a great variety of Orchidece, among which 
your splendid O.
gigantea, pectinata; Epidendrum 
pracox ; your Neottia acaidis, and a very large spe- 
cies which I call procera : of these two tribes you 
will receive from time to time large supplies, ac- 
cording to the wish you have expressed, as also of 
Orobanche and Aeginetia.
Of the former of these 
I have the pleasure to present you on this occasion 
with a species, which I cannot distinguish from in- 
dica of Buchanan ; of the latter, there are also spe- 
cimens in the chest.
I presented Mr. Roscoe with a good many Sci- 
taminecE, which were forwarded in the Cornwallis.
That illustrious man, as also the Botanic Institution 
at Liverpool (which in 1816 conferred the flatter- 
ing distinction, of electing me their first and only 
honorary member), have placed me under personal 
obligations for some excellent collections just re- 
ceived from the ship Bengal.
What a clever and ex- 
perienced man Mr. Shepherd must be !
— out of one 
hundred and one sorts of plants packed up in a light 
chest, according to his judicious mode, not less than 
forty-seven were in the highest vigour ; eight were 
in a state of dangerous weakness, but still holding 
out hopes of recovery !
If it is considered that the 
chest was embarked on the 22nd of January ; that 
more than half a year had elapsed since the roots and 
plants were packed up ; and that the chest remained 
on board the ship after its arrival here, for some time 
atleast,on account of its being placed so far down in 
the ship's hold as not to be come at without taking 
out part of the cargo; — if all this is considered, too 
252 
great encomium cannot, in my humble opinion, be 
bestowed on the judgement and success of the cu- 
rator of the Liverpool Botanic Institution.
I have re- 
solved to give this method ample and frequent trials, 
and I shall begin by returning the compliment to that 
excellent garden.
I shall not forget sending, also, 
ferns.
— Lastly,among your specimens you will find 
numerous Melostomea ; Labiata ; Scrophularincce, 
among them my Scr. urticifolia ; several Ternstroe- 
miacecB, Po/ygonece, Liliacecp, Melanthacea, viz.
An- 
guillaria indica of Brown ; Filices ; Grambiecc; Cy- 
peracea ; several species of Hydrangea, Viburnum; 
Ranunculacea, UmbellatcB, Corymbifera, many Quer- 
ci.
There is a Rhus, which I take to be the genuine 
Sitz of Kaempfer, and which I call R.
juglandifo- 
lium.
A seemingly dioecious species of Cynomoriinn, 
two species of Myrica, one of which is Colonel 
Hardwicke's jKWy?/z?//in Asiatic Researches, vol.
vi.
; 
the other is a doubtful species, which answers to 
Rumphii Lignum Emanum ; its fruit and female 
flowers I shall do myself the pleasure to present to 
you on a future occasion.
Several species of a ge- 
nus which has a close affinity to Incarvtlla.a, and 
with that forming, according to Mr. Brown's sug- 
gestion, a distinct section of Bignoniacea.
I call 
the genus in question Didymocarpus.
It has three 
stamina, one of which is abortive.
The capsule 
Imearis pseudo-4-locutaris, 2-valvis, dissepimento 
contrario 2-lobo : lobis valvulis parallelis marginc 
involuto seminiferis, seminibus nudis !
Htrbce humi- 
les, incano-pubescentes venoso-punctata, aromatica.
One of the species, my D.
aromatica, is in high 
253 
estimation at Napal, its young leaves being em- 
ployed in a dried state as a perfume and for sacer- 
dotal offerings, under the name of Koom-Koom 
(which is also that of Turmeric), and Ranee- Go- 
vindha.
A plant intermediate between that genus and 
Incarvillcea I retain under the latter, and call it 
/. dubia.
But it is time that I should conclude this long, 
digressing letter.
Happy, most happy shall I be, if 
you are pleased to pardon its faults, and if the col- 
lection of specimens to which it alludes chiefly, prove 
in any manner acceptable.
My venerated friend 
Colonel Hardwicke enjoys a better state of health 
than has been his portion for several years past; he 
wrote to you by the Isabella, and he requests me to 
offer you his kindest regards.
I have the honour to remain, with sentiments of 
the most profound respect and esteem, 
Dear Sir, 
Your highly obliged and devoted Servant, 
N. Wallich.
Sir J.
E. Smith to Dr. Wallich.
Norwich, March C, 1820.
[Observations on Dr. Wallich's plants, and his 
letter of May 27, 1819.] 
Rubia Munjistha of Roxburgh is precisely R.cor- 
difblia, Herb.
Linn, and we therefore avoid a most 
uncouth name.
Such names I think are seldom 
eligible.
254 
R. alata, Wallich, a new species, and an excel- 
lent name.
Galium elegans, Wall.; seems new, though I have 
one very near it, if not the same, from Madeira, 
which appears not to be described.
G. Sparine I have carefully compared with En- 
glish specimens, and find no difference.
G. asperifolium is new to me.
The name surely 
cannot be found fault with.
I cannot undertake your unsettled parcel of Sper- 
macoces at present.
It would be better for you to 
determine their distinctions in a fresh state.
At 
least I will now proceed to more certain and urgent 
matters; nor is it necessary to follow the order of 
your letter, or any other.
Your " Stellaria?
triandra" is a very interesting 
plant.
It is a Uolosteum, very like the cordatum in 
general appearance, but the calyx affords a clear di- 
stinction.
H. cordatum, native of the West Indies, 
(where it is used in bleaching linen and taking 
out iron-moulds, being called Moron by the 
French in Cayenne,) has folia calycina ujiinervia, 
glabra, planiuscula.
Yours, which I would call 
striatum, hasfol.
cat.
trinervia, sulcata, scabra, vel 
pubescentia.
Seed would be welcome.
Aegiceras majus — good.
— " Ajuga Hyoscyami" 
— why so called?
I see no resemblance, and I cannot 
commend such names in the genitive case.
See 
Introd.
to Botany, ed.
3. 290.
If I am wrong in 
my principles or opinions, I beg with all my heart 
to be corrected ; but if I help to improve science, I 
wish to be supported by classical botanists like you.
255 
I have not Brown's A.
si?iuata i but your plant seems 
to answer to his character.
If new, cana would be 
a good name.
Berberis pinnata, Roxb.
I have this fine plant 
from Dr. F.
Hamilton, by the names of Leontice 
fruticosa, and Berberis Miccia.
It may be Ilex ja- 
ponica of Thunberg, as you suspect ; but how could 
he overlook the pinnate leaves ?
What is most re- 
markable is, that I have the very same plant from 
California, gathered by Mr. Menzies, who likewise 
called it B.
pinnata, an excellent name.
Saxifraga ligulata, Wall.
— You have, I doubt 
not, a reason for your name, though it does not 
appear ; but I have an idea of there being some- 
where a S, ligulata.
On searching, I find there is a 
/mgulata of Bellardi, which however is my callosa, 
published in Dickson's Dried Plants.
Your plant is 
next akin to S.
crassifolia, and might have been 
called fimbriata, from its essential distinction.
Geranium from Kalmouda, called Tissoo soah, is 
next akin to G.
bohemicum, but the flowers are little 
more than half so large, and the bohemicum has the 
capsule corrugated transversely, which in yours is 
even (an excellent mark) and rather less hairy.
Your leaves too have rounder and more deep lobes.
The various pubescence of the stem is singular ; in 
some parts very dense ; then suddenly smooth.
It 
would be charity to help you to a specific name in 
such a great genus.
Perhaps heterotrichum might 
do, if the above character be constant.
Pavetta tomentosa, precisely mine.
Ixora lanceolaTA, Colebr.
— new to me.
I pre- 
sume the name alludes to the form of the leaf; Ian- 
25G 
ceo/aria, if it were latin, would mean that the tree 
or wood served for little spears.
Paris polyphylla.
— Thank you for this fine supply.
Colebrookea oppositifolia — good.
— Ixora cunei- 
folia,'Roxb., and its variety, — new to me.
Triwnfetta oblonga, Wall.
Very good.
I have it 
from (Buchanan) Hamilton, with a question whe- 
ther it may not be T.
annua of Linnaeus ; but this I 
have no means of determining, having no specimen.
He also refers to T.
glandulosa of WiHdenow, as 
probably like it.
This I have not.
" Callicarpa arborea, Roxb." This seems what I 
have from Dr. Roxburgh by the name of C.
villosa.
Are they the same ?
C.macrophylla, Vahl.
— seems right.
I have it not.
" Dairy mpela pomifera, Roxb.?" With this and 
its history I am quite unacquainted.
Whom is it 
named after ?
Is the name Dairying/ or pie ?
Hohnskioldia sanguinea — very fine and acceptable.
Lpranthus bicolor, Roxb.
I have one very near 
this, from Tranquebar, by the name of L.
lonice- 
roides, which it may be.
Anguillaria , Brown, precisely Melanthium 
indiciun, Herb.
Linn.
I think, as you say, it ought 
to be an Ornithoglossum.
Teucrium macrostachymn, Wall., is my Leuco- 
scept?'um canum, Exot.
Bot. t.
116.
Commersonia echinata.
Yours looks different 
from Forster's original Otaheite specimen, whose 
leaves are only 2 or 3 inches long, and 1 or 1| broad.
The pubescence of their under side is very fine and 
dense, scarcely visibly stellated.
Thank you for your fine specimens of Rhododen- 
257 
dron arboreum, and the white-flowered one, sup- 
posed a variety.
I think a specific difference may be 
founded on the back of the leaf; but of this you 
must judge.
Both are growing in England, from 
your seeds.
JDaph?ie Gardneri, Wall., I have from Dr. Hamil- 
ton, by the name of Dais Bamutis.
I know not 
why he made it a Dais, unless it be decandrous, 
which is of no consequence.
I retain your name 
of course.
May not this be (ob capitulum) Daphne 
indica of Loureiro ?
Daphne cannabina of Loureiro is probably right, 
for I pay little regard to the opposite leaves he at- 
tributes to it.
I take under this name your plant 
with glaucous leaves, yellowish beneath.
This I think 
is Hamilton's D.papyrifera in his MSS., though the 
leaves of his flowering specimens are less glaucous.
They are glaucous, like yours, in his fruit-bearing 
specimens.
But I presume to think you have here- 
with mixed two other species.
One is D.
Botlua of 
Hamilton, (I would call it D.saligna if there be none 
already), whose leaves are much narrower, not glau- 
cous ; flowers larger, without the involucral leaves of 
the camiabina.
The branches are long and vimineous.
The other is a smaller, more densely branched plant, 
with smaller leaves, not glaucous, of a broader 
figure ; flowers smaller, with fringed deciduous in- 
volucral leaves.
Ormosia dasycarpa, Jackson Tr. L.
Soc. v.
10, 
right — a native of the West Indies.
I hope it will 
afford you its beautiful seeds in due time.
I thank 
you much for the flowers, as my specimen is in fruit.

258 
Hedyotis gracilis — new to me.
It seems a pretty 
plant, and I hope this name, which you have now 
chosen, will suit it well.
Clematis smilacifolia — a very curious new species, 
so I must not complain of the badness of the spe- 
cimen.
Mespilus from the mountains near Katmandu — 
seems to me very distinct from japonica (which has 
now borne a very hard winter in my garden without 
any shelter).
Yours has elliptical, nearly entire leaves, 
not decurrent at the base as in M.
japonica, nor 
sharply serrated as in that*.
M. elliptica would be 
a good name.
— I find a few teeth here and there 
near the points of some leaves.
Buddlea paniculata, a fine species, new to me, 
though probably among Dr Hamilton's plants, 
which I have not yet all arranged.
Cornus aggregata.
I must rely on you for the 
genus, as the specimens are not in a state to deter- 
mine it.
— C.
oblongifolia is new to me.
Both these 
indeed may be among Hamilton's plants.
Cupressus from Almora.
May not this be C.pen- 
dula of Thunberg and Willdenow, though perhaps 
not Ft Moro of Kaempfer, which seems by his short 
account to be a Juniperus ?
Ligustrum napalense.
I think this only a downy 
variety of L.
japonicum.
Thunberg's original spe- 
cimen, though in fruit, retains some pubescence 
(exactly like yours) on the flower-stalks.
I find no 
difference at all in other respects.
Andromeda ovalifolia.
This seems what Dr. Ha- 
* I see you remark these particulars.

milton first named A.
latifolia, and then A.
capri- 
cida.
The latter, if true, would be preferable.
Acrostichum flagelliferum.
A very fine fern, new 
to me ; frondes apice radiculites, seu gemmipara, 
occur in several species.
Bauhinia corymbosa, Roxb.
Beautiful !
new to me .
Botrychium zeylanicum.
— Good and neat speci- 
mens of this would be one of the greatest treasures 
you could send European botanists.
Bauhinia racemosa, with a great downy legume, 
I had long ago from Roxburgh by the name of 
scandens.
Juglans pterococea.
Of this I know nothing, nor 
of Ulmus virgata of Roxburgh.
I know not whether this fine lnga in flower, 
" Mimosa Djiring of Roxb.
?" be supposed different 
from other specimens with young fruit.
They seem 
to me the same.
Is Bua firing the Malay name?
Your pretty Primula, with short radical flower- 
stalks, was called by Dr. Hamilton P.
Cushia.
He 
gathered it near the source of the Bagmutty.
I am 
not partial to such specific names, but they are not 
the worst of all.
Uvaria dioica, Roxb.
New to me.
— Gualtheria 
fragrantissima, Wall., I have from Dr. Hamilton 
as an Arbutus.
It comes near G.
erecta of Vente- 
nat, Jard.
de Cels, t.
5, but has smaller flowers, and 
more dense, downy (not hairy) clusters.
Leaves also 
more glandular beneath.
Gaulther'm is certainly 
right.
Heynea trijuga, Roxb.
Very acceptable, though 
I want the flowers.

Combretum costatum, Roxb.
A very noble plant.
— Epidendr.
moschatum, very preeious.
I wish you 
eould send me the leaves.
An Orehideous plant, without a ticket, is a Sa- 
tyrium^ called by Hamilton in his MSS.
Orchis bi- 
cornuta.
— A Viola also without a ticket, is called 
by our said friend longifolia, not very happily, but 
it is difficult to find a good name for it.
Hoya viridiflora, Br.
— right, of course.
I do not 
find that I have it.
Fraocinus Jloribunda, Wall., is, as you say, very 
near Ornus, but in yours the corolla and stamens 
are 3 or 4 times shorter than in F.
Ornus ; the 
leaflets more stalked, more pointed, and sharply ser- 
rated.
They are certainly distinct.
Callicarpa, with long leaves, sent from Sirinagur 
by SirR.Colquhoun ; — how does it differ fromVahl's 
macrophylla?
— Vitis par vifo/ia, Roxb ., well named; 
new to me.
— " Connarus from Penang," I know no- 
thing about.
It is a magnificent plant.
— A few that 
remain, I am obliged to pass over, either for want 
of time, or because I have nothing to say.
Thus my dear Sir, I have endeavoured to show, 
as well as I could, my gratitude for your bountiful 
communications.
A vast parcel of very fine things 
which came last year, before the present parcel, I 
have not yet been able to study ; but I have devoted 
many days to the present, and to your very kind 
letter of May 27, 1819.
Pardon me if I make re- 
marks freely, especially about names.
I wish those 
who, like you, are competent to take the lead, to 
consider and to study to keep the science as clas- 
261 
sical, elegant, and correct as possible.
Do you sup- 
port me in this, against illiterate botanists, &c.
&c.
You may see by my articles in Rees's Cyclo- 
paedia that I keep these things in view, and defend 
the Linnaean fortress as stoutly as I can ; but I am 
thankful for, and concur in, all sound correction and 
improvement.
Mr. Brown and I are sworn friends, 
though he uses the natural arrangement.
He is one 
of the most amiable, acute, and worthy of men.
Pray tell my dear cousin Mrs. Loring, with my 
kindest regards, that I have just buried my venera- 
ble mother, who died at 88, without any previous 
infirmity, the delight of all, old and young.
Great part of your parcel was half devoured by 
insects.
I shall distribute the duplicates as you 
order.
I wish however you would send me, in fu- 
ture, what you destine to me only, compact well 
pressed specimens.
This sheet, or rather half of it, 
shows the size of my herbarium, being the paper I 
use for it.
I have nothing at hand to send you at 
present, but the 3rd and last edition of my Compen- 
dium Flora Britannica, perhaps the best thing I 
have done, but I wish to correct its defects.
Great 
numbers of the seeds you sent me have succeeded 
very well, and some of the roots ; but most of the 
latter were eaten by rats in the ship.
Seeds are al- 
ways acceptable.
Pray send Ormosia if perfected.
Believe me, dear Sir, 
With every sentiment of regard and respect, 
Your obliged and faithful Servant, 
J. E.
Smith.
262 
From Dr. JVallich.
Dear Sir, Botanic Garden, Calcutta, May 10, 1820.
I have the satisfaction to inform you that a chest 
of specimens to your address, directed to the care 
of Mr. Kindersley, has been embarked on board the 
Henry Porcher.
Its chief contents consist in Na- 
pal plants, among which I hope there may be found 
some not formerly sent, and worthy of a place in 
your museum.
They have been collected by my 
people about Katmandu, and by some who were 
dispatched by my late friend Mr. R.
Stuart to Gos- 
sain Than, at the foot of the Himaleya, or rather 
within its first range.
The other specimens are 
from this garden, and I have to make an apology 
for several of these which belong to exotics in this 
country.
They were preserved by my people among 
other plants of this garden.
I have reason to fear 
they are not of any value to you.
There are likewise specimens of Sumatra and 
Penang plants which were left with me by my ever- 
valued friend Mr. Jack, surgeon to Sir Stamford 
Raffles, for the purpose of their being presented to 
you in his name.
Some more shall follow in my 
next dispatch.
Of the Scitamineous plants, I re- 
quest you will do me the favour to communicate 
some to Mr. Roscoe, with my best compliments.
I 
have lately had some most heart-cheering letters 
from that great and good man, to which I shall re- 
ply shortly.
From them I learn that a package I 
had the satisfaction of forwarding, of Scitamineous 
plants, had proved acceptable to yourself and to 
263 
him ; — among them were what I rejoice to find 
that you consider as several new species of Roscoea, 
He also kindly communicated a highly interesting 
synoptical view of all the Hedychia I had sent.
I 
anticipate the most glorious harvest in that tribe 
from my Napal journey, for which I set out in July 
next.
I hope that I need not assure you of my 
cordial desire to transmit to you such collections of 
every description from thence as I may anticipate 
will be favourably received.
Yourself, Sir Joseph 
Banks, Mr. Lambert, and Mr. Colebrooke, shall 
receive ample supplies, and I propose continuing to 
send them until I learn that you want no more of 
them !
It was my full intention to have presented you 
with a chest of specimens, with a request that you 
would kindly offer them to the Linnaean Society as 
a feeble tribute of my respect and esteem ; but the 
necessary leisure was wanting.
I may however still 
be able to effect this intention before my departure, 
because I am amply prepared with treasures for 
that purpose.
Mr. H.
Graves, proceeding in the Henry Porcher, 
will present you with a copy of the first volume of 
Roxburgh's Flora Indica, which I request you will 
do me the favour to accept, as a feeble testimony 
of the high esteem and respect which I entertain 
towards you.
He will likewise deliver into your 
hands another copy, which I request you will do me 
the honour to present to the Linnaean Society, for 
their library.
I ought to have mentioned that almost all the 
264 
Primulas and Androsaces are from the Himalaya, 
and all the Lysimachia are from the neighbourhood 
of Katmandu.
Mr. and Mrs. Loring are in excellent health : 
they are at present living at Barrackpore, and if 
they knew I was addressing you, would certainly 
have desired me to present you with their compli- 
ments.
Believe me, with the greatest possible respect and 
esteem, 
Dear Sir, 
Your faithful and humble Servant, 
N. Wallich.
From Sir Thomas Gage.
Castel a Mare, July 30, 1820.
My dear Sir James, 
The object of my troubling you with a letter from 
this distant place, is to state, that having spoken of 
our Linnsean Society to the Prince de Butera, a Si- 
cilian nobleman of the first consequence in that 
country, he expressed very strongly a wish to be- 
come an honorary member.
The Prince is extremely 
fond of botany, and cultivates with great success a 
number of very rare and curious plants.
The Prince informs me there is a good garden at 
Palermo, and well kept.
I cannot say as much for 
that of Naples, which is completely in a state of 
disorder.
Though introduced by letter to Tenore, 
I have never been able to make his acquaintance.
265 
He is publishing, on an expensive plan, a Crambe 
recocta of indigenous and foreign plants, cultivated 
in his garden.
Petagna, Stellati, and Briganti, are 
the only naturalists I have heard of here : the latter 
I am assured is a man of considerable talents.
No- 
thing is published on the subject in this country.
My health, which still continues very uncertain, 
prevents me from taking the advantage I should 
have among these fine mountains of Castel a Mare.
I have been obliged to give up my favourite pur- 
suits, as I walk with great difficulty.
The Ophrys Speculum and Distoma of Bivona 
are the best things I have got of late.
The country 
about Rome affords a much greater variety of rare 
productions, and there is now a good Flora pub- 
lished by Sebastiani and Mauri.
The former I am 
sorry to learn has fallen into an unfortunate state of 
health, which affects his mind ; and the latter, a 
young man of great promise, disgusted by want of 
encouragement, told me he had been obliged to give 
up his studies, to endeavour to live by teaching 
Italian.
A part of the Farnesina garden has been 
given for a botanic garden, but not the means of 
putting it into order.
I see by our papers, thai even 
at Bury St. Edmunds we are further advanced, and 
that a garden has been made even there.
I have 
applied myself a good deal to the study of insects, 
and have made a collection of about two thousand.
How very little have we advanced in this branch 
of natural history !
Kirby, Spence, Marsham, 
and MacLeay, must help us to something better 
than what we have got yet.
I saw with great re- 
266 
gret in our late papers, that we have lost our vene- 
rable and excellent Sir Joseph Banks, to whom I at 
least owe the greatest obligations for his assistance 
when a young man.
Having written so much on my favourite subject, 
you will see at all events that we enjoy perfect se- 
curity and feel no apprehension for our safety, 
though living in the midst of a revolution.
Indeed, 
unless a foreign power interferes, I think this place 
as likely to be quiet as any in Europe.
Nothing 
can exceed the attention paid to public security and 
respect to the persons and property of every indi- 
vidual.
In short, we see a whole nation fixed and 
united for the attainment of a grand object, and de- 
spising all the common and little means which in 
general are adopted, and sacrificing even the natural 
violence of its character in the general cause.
I shall remain here for the benefit of the waters, 
if possible, till October ; and I think I shall again 
pass a winter at Rome.
Lady Mary Anne and my children are well.
I 
trust Lady Smith is so, and beg you will accept our 
united compliments.
Believe me, dear Sir, 
Very sincerely yours, 
Thomas Gage.
From Sir Thomas G.
Cullum.
Bury, August 27, 1820.
My dear Friend Sir James, 
My sincerest thanks for your affectionate con- 
gratulations on Lady Cullum's recovery of her sight.
267 
The operation on one eye did not exceed two mi- 
nutes, nor more than three minutes in the other ; 
and I am happy to tell you that the operation has 
succeeded so well, that, with the help of spectacles, 
she thinks she sees as well as ever she did in her life ; 
she never suffered live minutes pain after the opera- 
tion : — but how fortunate has Lady Cullum been!
She 
was couched on Monday morning the 19th of June, 
and on Saturday the 24th the intense heat came on : 
had this intense heat come on the first or second 
day after the operation, the loss of her eyes would 
probably have been the consequence.
The operators 
do not regard the advanced age of their patients, 
nor the season of the year, except in extreme hot 
weather.
If I was forty or fifty years younger than 
I am, I should never forget the 19th of June, it 
being the day on which Lady Cullum underwent 
the operation, and the day of the death of Sir Jo- 
seph Banks ; and the last time I saw him he parti- 
cularly inquired how she did.
I saw Sir Joseph at 
his Sunday's levee about three weeks before ; and I 
said to several friends I should never see him more !
I have been over most of the places you mention 
in your Tour, particularly Haddon and Bakewell.
In my last I mentioned to you a Diant/ius, the 
seed of which was collected on the ruins of Catul- 
lus's villa at Sermione, on the Lago di Garda in 
Italy : it grows upwards of three feet high, with a 
profusion of blossoms.
I take it to be the Dian- 
thus virgineus.
There is a figure of it in Bot. Mag.
tab.
1740.
In one of the plants, most of the flowers 
have only four petals : in some flowers the stamina 
268 
are included in the faux corolla: in others, one, 
two, or three, or more, are elongated.
The evening before Lady Cullum was couched I 
was desired to put one drop of the infusion of the 
leaves of Atrojja Belladonna into each eye ; and the 
next morning, an hour before the operation, the 
same ; — the effect, to make the pupil of the eye di- 
late, is wonderful.
Some of the oculists use for 
the same purpose the Datura Stramonium (and, if 
I am not mistaken, the Hyoscyamus).
Ray seems to have confounded the Belladonna 
and Datura, as to their effects in dilating the pupil 
of the eye (see Syn. p.
226.).
It is not clear by his 
notes, which of the plants the lady used, — it may 
be one or the other ; but it is now ascertained that 
both have the same effect.
Ray has given the hint, 
and the modern oculists have profited by it.
I have many questions to ask you, — more than I 
can put on paper.
How much pleasure it would 
give me and Lady Cullum, if you and Lady Smith 
would come and see us in October !
Our gaieties 
begin about the 9th : come on that day, and stay 
as long as you can, and fix no time for your leaving 
us.
Thanking you again and again most heartily 
and sincerely for your kind and interesting letter, I 
remain, with the truest regard, 
Yours affectionately, 
T. G.
Cullum.
269 
Sir J.
E. Smith to Sir T.
G. Cullum.
My dear Sir Thomas, Norwich, Aug. 81, 1820.
I must thank you for your very kind letter, and 
the good news it contained, which is beyond our 
hopes.
Pray tell Lady Cullum her little postscript 
is worth more than its weight in gold, and we value 
it accordingly.
The confusion about Belladonna exists in Ray's 
own second edition of his Synopsis, where three 
lines relating to Solatium porno spinoso &c.
Datura 
stand (in p.
150) between other paragraphs, which 
all evidently belong to Atropa Belladonna.
There 
are no berries (bacca) for children to eat in the 
Datura.
Dillenius has not corrected this error in 
the third edition, p.
266 ; though he has there 
printed what regards Datura in larger characters, 
and marked it as a species with the §.
But this 
only increases the error, as he leaves the remarks 
as they were.
" Somniferum est et malignum" though it may 
be true of Datura, proves, by the word " daccas'" 
and all that follows, to belong to the Atropa.
I gathered Dianthus virgineus on Mount Cenis, 
— exactly like Bot. Mag.
t. 1740.
I was at Sir Joseph Banks's on Sunday evening, 
the 2 1 st of May, and left the room with the same 
melancholy forebodings that you did a fortnight 
after.
I was with him alone a few days before, and 
he told me he was quite easy about the event, which 
2/<) 
he knew could not be far distant, considering the 
state of his stomach.
I received a letter from Sir Thomas Gage the 
other day from Castel a Mare, near Naples, giving 
a pretty good account of himself and his family.
Once more, my dear Sir, our most affectionate 
regards attend you and Lady Cullum.
J. E.
Smith.
From Sir Thomas Frankland.
Dear Sir, Thirkleby, Nov. 5, 1820.
I would sooner have acknowledged your kind 
letter from Holkham, but that I had no matter 
worth writing in return.
A letter to a sportsman 
from Mr. Coke's in the high season was a curiosity; 
but I cannot wonder that your mind was more oc- 
cupied by the business which has so long engaged 
the house of lords.
My politics on the subject 
agree very much with Lord Harewood's speech in 
this day's paper.
My son and daughter have been amusing them- 
selves for some weeks in placing single trees and 
shrubs on the lawn ; and so zealously that the lady 
carries various articles, and even digs.
All this of 
course delights me more than the renounced fox- 
hunting did ; and the pretty intelligent children I 
cannot keep my eyes from.
My son takes a little 
shooting; but I seldom go with him, preferring the 
having his own way, and taking care that he is well 
attended.
For my own part, though my vitals are 
271 
good, debility and rheumatism make me so helpless 
at a hedge, that I am generally obliged to be pushed 
over by two stout men, and sometimes a third lift- 
ing my foot up !
Still I cling to my a ruling pas- 
sion," and shoot well till over- fatigued.
That my 
garden thrives, I will only say that we had aspara- 
gus on the 3rd, and have pease this day.
The for- 
mer is raised in one of the pigeon heated frames 
invented by M'Phail ; and it seems that as no va- 
pour of manure can affect the bed, what is raised in 
it must be materially sweeter than by the common 
process.
I had a letter lately from a Radnorshire 
man who has been visiting Mr. A.
Knight, and re- 
ports a fig-tree which has had nine crops in fifteen 
months, and has now a tenth on it !
This is ef- 
fected by drenching the plant with a mixture of 
pigeon's dung and water many times every day.
We have so few woodcocks that I have a bad 
opportunity for ascertaining whether my suggestion 
that the males only come over in the first flight, is 
correct.
We have had four, and I inclose the ex- 
terior quill-feathers of one bird as a perfect example 
of the male, — the female having a white line running 
most of the way from the quill to the extremity.
As for tearing out likenesses in paper, there is 
much chance in it ; for if you get wrong in the sim- 
ple outline, it is almost impossible to correct.
I 
have sometimes succeeded with strongly marked 
features, at a concert or an assembly, — usually 
tearing up the thin paper of the bill of fare.
The 
inclosed is the only one which I possess, but will 
give you a perfect notion of the thing.

society of York 30 or 40 years ago.
Her daughter

distinguished in the Irish parliament.
All the three 
parties died some time since at York.
I should wish 
to have the portrait again at your leisure ; for it is 
considered as strong a likeness as Lawrence's art 
could have produced.
I have just written into Scotland for a specimen 
of Menziesia cczrulea *, and shall attempt the poly- 
folia, through my sister Lady Roche, who resides in 
Dublin.
My daughter harrowed up these desiderata 
in my herbarium.
I am, dear Sir, 
Yours most faithfully,

From the Rev. James Yates.
Dear Sir James, Birmingham, Feb. 26, 1822.
I have been long wishing for an opportunity of 
expressing to you and Lady Smith the pleasure and 
obligation which I feel whenever I call to mind my 
visit to you last autumn ; and at the same time to 
inform you that all I expected to find at Holkham 
was even exceeded, both in the magnificence of the 
place itself, and its richness in the various objects 
of taste and curiosity, and also in the hospitality 
and goodness of its noble-minded possessor, — and 
of his daughter, of whom it is the highest praise to 
say that she is worthy of her father.
From Mr.
Odell, also, I received the most obliging attentions; 
and the kindness of Archdeacon Bathurst was quite 
overwhelming.
Indeed, I never took any journey 
which afforded me so much of the pleasures and 
advantages (and these I reckon among those which 
are of the highest order,) of intercourse with the 
truly great and good.
Among these I number not 
only your venerable Bishop, but others of the in- 
habitants of your classic and intellectual city, whom 
I met in your company, and who, though in humbler 
stations of life, are the real ornaments of society, — 
the patterns and promoters of whatever is most es- 
timable in human nature, — the enlightened and 
consistent friends of liberty, truth, and virtue.
I would beg you to give them my kind and re- 
spectful remembrances, if it were not that, from the 
number of the kind and good friends with whom 
t 2 
276 
you made me acquainted, the commission would be 
too extensive to trouble you with.
I am sorry that 
a fondness I have both for carrying and sending 
letters by the hand of a friend, rather than by the 
post, has occasioned so long a delay in the expres- 
sions of my thanks to Lady Smith and yourself.
But my impressions of gratitude and of admiration 
for what I saw and experienced in Norfolk, are still 
as lively as if it were a thing of yesterday.
Your Friend and Servant, 
James Yates.

E. S??iith to Sir 7 1 .
G. Cullum.
My dear Sir Thomas, Norwich, June 29, 1822.
I cannot neglect this opportunity of recalling 
myself to your remembrance.
Mr. Denson has sent me 30 specimens to deter- 
mine, and I have told him all I know about them.
I feel much improved in health and strength since 
I came home.
We had a pleasant walk to Mr.
Crowe's, and back again, after tea on Thursday last.
The willows are all growing very finely.
I have placed all Lady Mary Ann Gage's insects 
in my cabinet, and return her box, which I beg the 
favour of you to let her ladyship have at some 
convenient opportunity.
I know not whether I ever gave you a copy of 
Linngeus's Orbis eruditi Judicium, a little work in 
justification of himself, and the only thing of the 
kind he ever printed.
I fancy he distributed it but 
278 
little; for few of his foreign biographers have ever 
seen it, and it is generally reckoned his rarest work.
Such, also, is the case with his Observationes in 
Regnum Lapideum, printed for his pupils, and which 
I also send, as you may like to add it to the many 
curiosities of your library.
I must next week return to my English Flora.
Edward Forster, who has been here a few days, 
looked at it critically, and approved what he saw.
He is a good English botanist, and a sincere friend.
I understood you were to meet him at Mrs. Gould's.
With my kindest and most grateful remembrances 
to your excellent lady, whose benevolence is not 
wasted on an insensible heart, 
I remain, my dear Sir, 
Most faithfully yours, 
J. E.
Smith.
From Dawson Turner, Esq.
My dear Friend, Yarmouth, Nov. 1, 1823.
Mr. Roscoe is kind enough to promise to come 
to us the latter end of the approaching week, and 
if you and Lady Smith can be prevailed upon to 
favour us at the same time with your company, — 
not, however, bounding your stay by his, — you will 
make Mrs. Turner and me extremely happy.
Under 
other circumstances I should scarcely have ventured 
to propose to you a journey to Yarmouth at this 
cold and dreary season of the year ; but, happily, 
I can offer you a warm room in a warm house, and 
279 
you are by no means in the number of those who 
depend for their comfort or amusement upon things 
without ; and our opportunities of meeting are now 
so rare, that I am but too glad to catch you in any 
time or place.
In the course of my downward 
journey through life, there are but few things have 
vexed me more than the interruption to those an- 
nual visits which used to pass between us, and which 
were periods on whose recurrence, like a school- 
boy for his holidays, I used to reckon from year to 
year.
If possible, do let them be renewed : not 
many more summers, in the course of nature, can 
be allotted to either of us ; and our time of life is 
not such when we can with prudence expect, or 
wish, to form many new friends ; still less can we 
be willing to part with those we have : every year, 
as it goes, necessarily diminishes their number.
Since 1823 more than ten of the persons with whom 
I was then in correspondence are dead.
I disco- 
vered the fact accidentally in turning over my 
letters, and I do not know when I have felt so 
painful a chill.
But the effect will be good, if it 
leads me the more to value those who are left, and 
among these there is assuredly no one to whom I 
owe more, or for whom I feel a greater regard, than 
yourself.
Do, my excellent friend, let us endeavour, 
as far as in us lies, to recall the times that are past, 
when I used to mark the years by your visits, and 
counted upon their recurrence from August to Au- 
gust.
As one advances in life, and sees the friends 
of our youth gradually drop about us, the number 
decreases of those to whom it is possible fully and 
280 
freely to open our minds : it is painful, therefore, 
to lose any opportunity, when 
" tibi, dulcis amice, 
Excutienda darem praecordia, quantaque nostrae 
Pars tua sit, mi care, animae, tibi 
Ostendisse queam." 
Ever affectionately yours, 
D. Turner.
From Mr. G.
Smclair.
Sir, Woburn Abbey, Jan. 7, 1824.
I have the honour of your letter of the 23rd De- 
cember, and humbly beg leave to say, that I have no 
words by which I can convey to you the deep sense 
I have of your great condescension and kindness.
The approbation of your illustrious name is an ho- 
nour and reward to me which I feel I cannot too 
highly prize.
Encouraged by your approbation of 
my labours, I applied to the Duke of Bedford for 
the honour of his signature to my certificate, which 
His Grace, in the kindest manner, instantly granted, 
and accompanied his consent with a mark of his 
munificence, to render me a free member of the Lin- 
naean Society for life.
The condescending and most 
kind assurance of your support has alone induced 
me to take steps for such a purpose.
I humbly beg 
leave to say, that my object in intruding on your 
valuable time, at this moment, is solely to offer you 
my grateful acknowledgements ; for without the 
permission to do this, I should have felt unhappy.
281 
The Duke of Bedford has of late devoted more 
time than usual to botany and gardening.
Within 
the last twelve months he has formed a fine collec- 
tion of Heaths, — the most extensive, I believe, that 
is anywhere to be found : a compartment for the 
growth of the more hardy species of Erica adjoins 
the Heath-house.
As soon as I have completed my 
work on Grasses, I purpose to enter on an exami- 
nation of this beautiful and interesting family of 
plants, — in which attempt I shall hope for your as- 
sistance.
The Duke is very anxious to see your 
new Flora.
The important and novel improvements 
in the generic characters of the Umbellifera will be 
found productive of the greatest utility in practice ; 
and in this I feel certain that I speak the sentiments 
of every practical botanist.
The generic characters 
founded on the general and partial involucra I have 
ever found most difficult to profit by, or use in de- 
termining with certainty the groups of this natural 
and numerous order of plants ; and such a lessening 
of labour and clearing away of difficulties will, I 
feel certain, be received with gratitude by every stu- 
dent in English botany.
I have the honour to be, &c.
G. Sinclair.
From Sir Thomas Cullum.
Bury, Feb. 26, 1S24.
My dear Friend Sir James, 
I had a letter about a fortnight ago from Mr.
Lambert, of whom I had not received a line since I 
282 
left Fonthill.
His letter, I may say, cost me 1/.
as., 
as he expressed himself all in raptures that De Can- 
dolle had published Part I.
of a new work, entitled 
Prodromus Syst.
Nat. Regni Vegetabilis.
I sent 
for it immediately ; and though I cannot but admire 
the pains he has taken, yet I lament that he did not 
go on with his Systema Pegetabile, which probably 
now I shall never see, as, if I understand him right, 
he intends to publish another volume, first, of his 
Prodromus, 
The chemical names of medicines are so much 
altered, that I dare not send for a dose of Epsom 
salts, or some calomel, without looking into the 
Pharmacopoeia Lond.
to see by what name I am to 
send a note to the druggist.
The new London 
Pharmacopoeia has just been put into my hands.
I 
could not help observing that they took the hint 
that if that barbarous word Elettaria should be 
abolished, that you would recommend Matonia to 
be substituted for the Cardamom.
In the last Dispensatory, the Cantharides were 
called Lytt(E) but now the old name is restored; how 
far that is proper I must not pretend to question.
Three species of Cinchona, the cordifolia, lancifolia, 
and oblongifolia, are still continued.
Camphor is 
still said to be the produce of Law*us Camphora, and 
" concretum sui generis sublimatione paratum." Mr.
Miller always told me that all the best camphor was 
from very large timber trees at Sumatra, sometimes 
(according to the age of the trees) either in a fluid 
or concrete state.
The whole trade of making cam- 
phor is in the hands of the Dutch.
Do they make 
283 
it from the Laurus, or from the undescribed trees 
growing in Sumatra or Borneo ?
A few weeks ago Lord Stradbroke sent me a 
couple of insects, wishing to know their name, as he 
was apprehensive he should lose all his Scotch firs, 
as they were sickly and dying in great numbers 
every year.
I had no difficulty in acquainting him 
that the insect was the Sir ex Juvencus, which puts 
me in mind, that many years ago I observed in Mr.
Port's garden plantations at Ham, in Derbyshire, 
several fine young oaks were lying on the ground ; 
and inquiring of the gardener the reason of their 
being hewn down, he told me the hornets had bored 
into them and destroyed them.
I now conclude that 
they were not hornets, but the Sirex Gigas, which 
is more like a hornet than the Juvencus.
In Mr. Lambert's splendid book I do not recol- 
lect that the Sirexes are mentioned as the destroyers 
of the Pinus sylvestris, — but Lord Stradbroke ha- 
ving sent me some pieces of a pine-tree, I will send 
them to the Linnaean Society if you think it would 
be acceptable to them.
Yours affectionately, 
T. G.
Cullum.
From Professor Hooker.
Glasgow, November 30, 1824.
My dear Sir James, 
I received only the latter end of last week your 
valued letter from Edward Rigby ; and I take the 
284 
very earliest opportunity to return you my most 
sincere thanks for it.
You have given me a great 
deal of botanical information, and some useful 
hints, by which it will be my own fault if I do not 
profit : but what I prize far more than them, is the 
kind, friendly, and affectionate manner in which you 
have throughout expressed yourself.
I hope I shall 
continue to deserve your good-will and your friend- 
ship, with which I assure you I cannot but feel my- 
self honoured.
I shall now go on to answer your kind inquiries 
about my proposed Species Plantarum.
It will 
neither come under the denomination of a transla- 
tion of De Candolle's Prodromus, nor can the greater 
portion of it pretend to the title of originality : the 
very nature of the undertaking would forbid this.
I have De Candolle's full permission to translate 
and copy whatever I choose from him ; and his 
work (because it will be the most complete,) is what 
I shall follow in the general arrangement and cha- 
racter, especially of the orders and genera.
Here, 
however, I shall make alterations when I may see fit ; 
and with regard to species, I shall, whenever I can 
have access to a good specimen, draw up the cha- 
racter myself ; when I cannot, I shall copy (but never 
without acknowledgement,) from others.
Here, 
again, I shall often be obliged to copy De Candolle's 
characters, because his are drawn up with reference 
to all the other species of the genus.
The species 
(presumed ones, I mean,) I shall reduce whenever I 
have materials to enable me to do so ; and this is 
285 
really no light task, for I quite believe, in some ex- 
tensive genera he has given twice the number of 
species he ought to do : witness Thalictrum, Aco- 
nitum, Helia?ithe?num, &c.
I have this moment re- 
ceived a good many of his supposed species of the 
latter genus from Montpellier, and these will enable 
me to make some corrections.
When I may think 
him wrong without sufficient materials to prove him 
so, I shall copy his characters and state my opinion.
I can make nothing of his Drabce ; — indeed I am 
greatly puzzled with our Scotch species.
What 
varieties of hirta we have from the Arctic regions !
These I think will throw some light on De Can- 
dolle's doubtful ones.
As to terminology, you cannot differ in opinion 
from DeCandolle upon this subject more than I do.
Much harm has, I think, been done to science bv 
the numerous newly invented terms, many of which 
are worse than useless.
I shall adhere as closely as 
I can to your language, and I assure you, that one 
great cause of my rejoicing at the appearance of 
your English Flora, before my going to press 
with the System of Plants, is, that I shall thus be 
able to profit by your latest ideas upon the subject.
I think in general I have followed you pretty closely.
I would prefer, however, cordate to heartshaped, per- 
haps from custom ; as I would lanceolate to lance- 
shaped : neither is, perhaps, generally received En- 
glish.
The word even does not express to me what 
smooth does — which I have been in the habit of 
applying to a surface free from roughness ; whilst 
glabrous I have used to signify a surface free from 
286 
hairs.
There appears to me an advantage in using 
Latin words with an English termination, where 
they are not otherwise objectionable; that is, in be- 
ing able to unite with them, the little words ob and 
sub.
— You can say oscordate, but you must say in- 
versely heartshaped ; — .you can say suBglabrous, but 
you must say somewhat smooth.
As to synonyms, 
I must curtail them as much as possible.
There will 
be 50,000 species of phaenogamous plants to be de- 
scribed, and these the bookseller is most anxious 
should be comprised in ten volumes.
I shall give 
the Jlrst author who named the plant ; De Candolle's 
as the most complete Flora ; and refer to one or 
more good figures, preferring always the most po- 
pular of these : I shall also include those authors 
who have particularly studied any genus or species.
This may perhaps give you some idea of the nature 
of my book (about which I cannot help feeling very 
anxious) ; and the specimen I inclose will give you 
an idea of the type.
I need hardly say how thank- 
ful I shall be for anything you may suggest for the 
improvement of my work ; — as yet, I have consulted 
nobody.
For any specimens, too, that might come 
into the earlier or later volumes, that you can well 
spare, I should be very grateful.
I set a great store 
by those you have already given me, and find them 
very useful.
Your names of new species I should 
of course hold as sacred, and be most proud to pub- 
lish them, as well as any remarks you might think 
proper to make.
I never had Nepal plants from 
Wallich, except our collection five years ago.
I have 
now understood that the India Company recmiie 
287 
that they should have the distribution of all the 
specimens.
Mosses, however, I continue to receive 
from him, and some very good ones too.
I rejoice that the Company have sent you so fine 
a parcel of Ferns, and I thank you for offering to 
lay by some for me.
The little Darea I am quite 
delighted with ; I had previously picked a wretched 
bit of a barren frond from among some mosses, and 
admired its beauty.
Your specimen I should like 
to figure in my Exotic Flora, if you have no objec- 
tion.
I wish a fern-like plant I inclose for you may 
please you half as much as the Darea has done me; 
and pray give me your opinion of it : it is an aqua- 
tic from Guiana, and is found in no other state than 
what you see.
It cannot, I think, according to your 
character of the Order Filices, really belong to it : 
with the general aspect of the fructification of a 
Pteris, there is no ring to the capsules.
It cannot 
be one of the Hydropterides of Willd., because 
they have the fructification among the roots.
At 
any rate, I think I cannot be wrong in forming a 
new genus of it, which I am anxious to dedicate to 
its discoverer Mr. Parker.
Can the East Indian 
Pteris thalictroides (which I have never seen,) belong 
to the same genus ?
or Beauvois' Pteris cornuta ?
which you observe comes near the Pteris thalic- 
troides-, but which again, if Beauvois has represented 
the fruit correctly, must be widely different.
It would make me very happy if I could think 
that I had other plants that would be worth your 
acceptance.
I am increasing my foreign correspon- 
dence, and have one most excellent contributor in 
288 
Demarara, and another in the island of St.Vincent's.
I have more mosses too, which I think you might 
like to have.
I wish I could consult you about Or- 
chidece : some fine specimens every now and then 
flower in our garden ; but according to the present 
characters every new species forms a new gemis.
I 
am glad you think favourably of my Exotic Flora.
I have now by me some rare and interesting sub- 
jects ; such as the Marcgravia umbellata, Cassytha 
filiformis, Cytinus hypocistus, and some remark- 
able Orchidea, besides two neviTiUajidsice.
I have had 
two plates engraved of the Nutmeg, and am about 
to figure the Artocarpus incisa and bitegrifolia, from 
very fine drawings made in the West Indies, aided 
by specimens in spirits.
I have been lately much engaged with exotic 
plants.
I wish you would look at an original spe- 
cimen of Lepraria iolithos, and see if it be not the 
same as the red snow of the arctic people.
I have 
some from Captain Parry, and I have the same plant 
from Captain Carmichael, found in Argyleshire ; 
but it does not lose its deep red colour by keeping, 
nor give out an agreeable odour.
I have some rea- 
son to think that it is only that filamentous plant 
(young Conferva anrea?) which turns pale by keep- 
ing, and smells like violets, and which has perhaps 
by Linnaeus himself been confounded with the gra- 
nulated kind.
Agardh assures me the red snow is 
common in Sweden.
We may now expect great things from the hi- 
therto unexplored parts of North America.
I have 
been the means of sending out two very zealous 
289 
and able botanists to the N.W. coast, — Menzies's 
country.
One of them will join Captain Franklin, 
and return overland with him.
The other will ex- 
plore the vicinity of the Columbia.
I have got an 
appointment for a third to go out with Captain 
Franklin and Dr. Richardson on their expedition.
He will go as far as the Saskatchawan with them, 
and there remain two entire years, botanizing.
He 
will be within reach of the declivities of the Rocky 
Mountains, and explore the head of that immense 
basin or plain which opens towards Mexico, and 
where he will, it is expected, meet with many of the 
plants of Nuttall, James, and Bradbury.
Franklin 
and the officers who accompany him will have in- 
structions to collect plants from the mouth of the 
M'Kenzie river, during their journey to Behring's 
Straits.
Douglas will pass one season on the west 
coast,and then crossing the Rocky Mountains in lat.
55° (after passing through ten degrees of lat.), will 
fall in with Captain Franklin at Isle de la Crosse.
Richardson will confine himself principally to the 
country between the Coppermine river and the 
M'Kenzie river.
Their various collections, together 
with what is now doing in Canada, Labrador, and by 
Captain Parry's party, will form valuable materials 
for a Flora of the British possessions in North 
America.
Dr. Hamilton of Leny often speaks of 
you, and so did Dr. Boott, when he was in Scotland.
And now, my dear friend, I have reason to think 
that long before you come to this part of my epistle 
you will cry for mercy ; but be assured that I never 
vol.

From A.
B. Lambert, Esq.
My dear Friend, Boyton House, July 22, 1825.
Perhaps you will hardly believe it when I tell you, 
the whole of the drawings of natural history of the 
celebrated Bruce are now all safe at Boyton !
! !
— 
arrived about a fortnight ago direct from Kinnaird : 
Mr. Cummings Bruce, who is now in possession of 
the estates and museum, marrying the heiress of 
Bruce, and whom I never saw.
His brother, Sir W.
G. Cumming, married my cousin, Lady Charlotte 
Bury's eldest daughter.
The drawings, which are about three hundred, 
consist of birds, fish, quadrupeds, and plants, — the 
latter most interesting, — all drawn and described on 
the spot where he found them, in Abyssinia, with 
dissections of the parts of fructification, and which 
would do honour to many of the botanists of the 
present day, and most truly prove him to be a most 
accurate, diligent observer, and perfectly do away all 
those malicious aspersions which envy has brought 
against him.
Yours sincerely, 
A. B.
Lambert.

Dear Sir, Island of Corfu, March 31, 1826.
I imagine it will be agreeable to you to have some 
* OfLaycock Abbey, Wilts., nephew to the Marquis of Lans- 
downe.
This gentleman was introduced to Sir James in the 
autumn of 1825 by A.
B. Lambert, Esq. of Boyton House.

account of the botany of this island, which you may 
compare with that of Sibthorp and others who have 
visited it, probably at different seasons of the year.
The aspect of it is very mountainous, and clothed 
with olive woods : near the city a fertile plain.
I 
have not yet extended my ramble to any distance 
from the city.
The orange-trees are magnificent, 
and are now loaded with fruit.
The olives are co- 
vered with their black berries.
Gigantic Arundo 
Donate, and Cactus Opuntia of considerable size, di- 
versify the prospect.
The extensive cultivation of 
the Artichoke is curious ; it serves for hedges, and 
very pretty ones.
There are hedges, too, of scarlet 
Cape Geraniums, more I think for ornament than 
protection.
In fact, it is an open country, — a garden.
Here is a sort of calendar of Flora, which you 
may compare with Norfolk on the same day, if you 
have made similar notes : — 
Corfu, March 81.
Elder-tree in flower; Brambles, ditto ; Pome- 
granate in young leaf, having the appearance of a 
red bush; Fig-tree in young leaf; Scrophularia 
peregrina in flower ; along with the following plants 
in flower: — 
Chrysanthemum segetum ; Common Scarlet Poppy; 
Lathyrus a/a (us ; Fumaria capreolata ; Geranium, 
unknown to me, — like molle, but five or six times 
larger, — not pyrenaicum ; Thlaspi Bursa pastoris, 
of a size little inferior to Cardamine amara ; Aspho- 
delus ramosus and Phlomis fruticosa, very showy 
plants ; Anemone hortensis ; Hyacinthus racemo- 
sus ; Ornithogalum exscapum (of Tenore), nanum 
295 
(Sibth.
?) which seems a mere variety of umbellalum; 
Hellcborus viridis — this is not in Prodr.
Fl. Grcec; 
Lycopsis variegata.) a charming plant, forming here 
extensive fields of blue ; — Sibthorp says it is rare 
in Peloponnesus and the Archipelago, so that I 
suppose this island is its head-quarters ; Ajuga 
reptans, extremely large ; Symphytum tuberosum ; 
Linum usitatissimum ; Euphorbia dendroides ; 
Chrysanthemum coronarium ; Erodium malacoides 
and moschatum ; Lotus ornithopodioides ; Echium 
calycinum (not in Prodromus) ; Tordylium officinale, 
— this is the commonest umbelliferous plant on the 
island.
At Ancona, in Italy, I saw the other day a 
scarlet corn-field ; — arrived at the spot, I found it 
owing to a profusion of Tulipa Oculus Solis.
— The 
weeds of the South of Europe are very handsome.
April 2.
I can add to the list two Ophryses which are not 
in the Prodro7?ius, — lute a and aranifera, besides 
tenthredinifera.
I observed today, in flower, Anagal- 
lis arvensis and coerulea; Hippocrepis unisiliquosa ; 
Saponaria ocymoides (not in Prodromus) ; Eunaria 
rediviva ; Astragalus monspessulanus ; Galium 
cruciatum ; Sparlium villosum ; Cistus salvifolius ; 
Ant hy His vulneraria (florerubro), and Vicia luteaf 
Veronica Buocbaumii ; Bellis annua ; Scorpiurus 
subvillosa ; Phalaris uti'iculata, very abundant (not 
in Prodr.); Trifol.
resupinatum: Sherardia arve?isis; 
Geranium dissectum ; Lithosp.
purpureo-coeruleum ; 
and a noble Echium.
I am convinced the beautiful Geranium of this 
island is distinct from pyrenaicum : the flowers are 
•2iJG 
u fine rose colour, of the size of a sixpence, orna- 
menting all the road sides.
Hedysarum coronarium (not mProdr.).
I wonder 
this showy flower did not fall in Sibthorp's way.
— I 
have found a Senccio that may be new : it is like 
vulgaris, wanting the ray florets, but much larger, 
and pale sulphur yellow, with long slender florets 
that are protruded and make a sort of bush.
April 4.
There are now in flower some plants not in the 
Prodromus, viz.
Lotus maritimus ; Vicia grandiflora {sordida, 
Willd.).
Cerastium manticum (a curious species, 
hitherto little understood, to which I would give the 
following specific character : " Cerastium erectum 
glaberri?num pedunculis longissimis e?'ectis, calyce 
me?nbranaceo,petalisfere integrisT A curious little 
Euphorbia, {nova species ?) resembling E.
Peplus a 
little, but has a 5-rayed umbel, and echinate capsules : 
the petals also are entire, not lunate or horned.
A species of Muscari with blue flowers of a large 
size.
— Besides these, which seem additions to the 
Flora Graca, I see a beautiful Malvaceous plant, — a 
Afalope, with rosy flowers three inches in diameter ; 
blue Lupins ; Bartsia latifolia ; Serapias Lingua; 
Delphinium Staphisagria (not in flower) ; Coronilla 
cretica ; Medicago circinata ; Omithopus compres- 
sus ; Trifol.
subterra7ieum ; Picridium vulgare ; 
Thelygonum Cynocrambe.
I remain, dear Sir, with the greatest regard,

From the sa?ne.
Dear Sir, Corfu, April 10, 1826.
Trusting you have received a letter I sent you 
some days ago, I will now give you some further 
account of the vegetation of this island.
I have, 
however, only examined the environs of the town.
In the remoter parts, if I may credit the director 
of the botanic garden here, there are some very 
extraordinary productions ; as, Echium giganteum ; 
two species of Othonna, the pectin at a and the other ; 
two species of Osteospermum, pisiferum and moni- 
liferum ; Nolana prostrata ; Chrysocoma Coma 
aurea ; and a beautiful yellow climber, genus un- 
known to me, — whether Dolichos or Crotalaria I 
cannot tell ; but as I have not myself observed these 
plants growing wild, I hesitate about them.
Now to come to my own observations.
— I men- 
tioned in my last that I had found a new?
Euphorbia, 
resembling E.
Peplus : — on revisiting the spot, I 
found (which is singular) another Euphorbia, grow- 
ing with it, and very like it, but admirably distinct 
in its characters, especially in its sharply hexagonal 
capsule, which I have not seen in any species of 
this genus.
The two plants are thus»characterized : 
(they both resemble E.
Peplus or E.
eccigua.)

298 
I should be glad to learn whether these plants are 
described anywhere.
I have found a large white- 
flowered species of JLithosperinum, with trailing 
stems ; Stachys spinulosa ?
with white flowers, — a 
large plant ; Veronica syriaca, an elegant little 
plant with large flowers ; Phleum felinum P Con- 
volvulus tenuissimus; Crambe Corvini (not in Prodr.); 
Lotus tetragonolobus ; Lathyrus setifolius ; Iiuntas 
Erucago ; Ornithopus scorpioides ; Andropogon di- 
stachyon ; Aristolochia rotunda ; Allium subhir- 
sutum ; Urospermum picroides ; Hesperis verna ; 
Rhagadiolus stellatus ; Polypodium leptophyllum ?
Anthyllis tetraphylla ; Euj)horbia a?/iygdaloides, 
abundant (not in Prodr.); Geranium, with very large 
flesh-coloured flowers, — petals entire ; Vicia bi- 
thynica ; Coronilla securidaca ; &c.
&c.
&c.
I am about to visit Santa Maura (the ancient 
Leucadia), and hope to give you a good account 
from thence.
The season is backward : there are 
a vast number of plants springing up everywhere.
I remain, dear Sir, 
Yours faithfully, 
H. F.
Talbot.
P.S. The tJmbcllifercB of the Ionian Isles are 
numerous and extraordinary.
They seem little 
known, and I cannot refer them even to their ge- 
nera in some instances.
A copy of the Flora Graca, which I met with in 
the Grand Duke's library at Florence, was of great 
service to me.
299 
From Sir Thomas G.
Cullum.
My dear Sir James, Bury, Aug. 22, 1827.
We have lost from our Society the Bishop of 
Carlisle.
I preserve one of his letters to me, bearing 
date October 31, 1796, which I value much.
At 
one of the Linnaean dinners in May we were com- 
paring our ages, and it appeared that the Bishop 
was nearly two years below me ; he being born in 
1 743, and I in 1741.
When I looked at him at the 
Linnaean Club at the Thatched House Tavern, I 
was much concerned, thinking what an alteration 
illness makes in a man whom I remember as strong 
as Hercules.
When I look at the private list of the 
Linnaean Society in 1788, and the printed one in 
1789, I will not express how few are alive !
I feel the infirmities of age creep upon me ; yet I 
am thankful for the comforts I enjoy.
That we may 
soon meet in cheerful spirits and health, is the sin- 
cere wish of your affectionate 
T. G.
Cullum.* 
J. E.
Smith to Sir T.
G. Cullum.
My dear Sir Thomas, Norwich, Sept.
4, 1827.
Your letters are always peculiarly welcome, and 
I had long been wishing to hear from you.
I need 
not say how much I lament the good Bishop of 
Carlisle.
Dr. Latham and I are now the only sur-

the 8th of September 1831, aged 90 years.

viving original members of the Linnaean Society.
He writes to me that he is two years older than the 
Bishop.
I was prevented by the death of my wife's 
brother, and my own illness, from going to London 
this year.
I suffer severely from rheumatism, which 
has for three weeks past affected my eye, — the same 
which suffered from erysipelas twenty-five years ago, 
and frequently since, becomes cloudy, weak, and 
painful from cold : it is now very troublesome, so 
as to hinder my usual pursuits.
I have lately received from Kent the true Swiss 
Ophrys arachnitis figured in Haller, — a great ac- 
quisition to our Flora.
Believe me, dear Sir, &c.

CHAPTER XIII.
Correspondence of Mr. Roscoe and Sir J.
E. Smith.
A few letters of Mr. Coke of Norfolk are also in- 
serted in this chapter, — a name which it is impos- 
sible to mention without a wish to do some justice 
to the feelings it inspires ; but this might seem like 
adulation, yet fall short of the truth : it is not there- 
fore sufficient, but it may be expedient, only to 
remark, that Mr. Coke's friendship for Sir James 
began from the year in which the latter became an 
inhabitant of the same county, and was perpetuated 
in annual and perennial acts of kindness during the 
remainder of Sir James's life.
Of a character so well known as Mr. Roscoe, it 
is unnecessary to say more than that Sir James's 
first acquaintance with this distinguished person 
had its origin in a request imparted to the latter to 
give a course of botanical lectures at Liverpool in 
1803, upon which occasion a mutual esteem was 
formed : it cannot be said to have grown between 
them, for it arrived at its full strength and stature 
in so short a period, that time was unnecessary to 
the development of a friendship which proved as 
durable as it was decided at the first acquaintance.
The following letter to Dawson Turner, Esq., de- 
scribes the impression which this visit made upon 
Sir James : — 
302 
My dear Friend, Allerton Hall, July 1G, 1803.
At length I sit down to write you a letter, — lite- 
rally, but not, I fear, metaphorically ', with the pen 
of a Roscoe, — that very pen which has just been 
correcting his manuscript Life of Leo X.
I am here at his charming villa, six miles from 
Liverpool, looking over Cheshire and the Mersey 
to the Welsh hills.
Our friend Hugh Davies travelled with Drake 
and me in the mail to Chester ; our ride and voyage 
thence were delightful *.
My lectures are numerously and brilliantly at- 
tended, and seem to stir up a great taste and ardour 
for botany.
The botanic garden promises well, 
though in its infancy, except the stove, which is 
well filled, and in the first order.
The curator, Mr.
Shepherd, is the properest man I ever saw for the 
purpose.
I hope to procure him some useful cor- 
respondents, one of which shall be our friend Watts 
ofAshill.
You are acquainted with Mr. Roscoe' s taste and 
genius ; — his manners, temper, and character are 
equal to them.
I am surprised to find him so good 
* In a letter written about the same time (o his sister, Mrs 
Martin, Sir James informs her " that he had been to dine with 
Mr. Roscoe at his country house, quite retired, in a most beau- 
tiful situation, with fine views over 
' Cheshire and Lancashire both, 1 
(Do you remember the old ballad of Childe Waters ?) Wales, 
the Mersey, &c.
I felt as if I were with Lorenzo de' Medici 
at his villa; for of all the men I ever knew, Mr. Roscoe most 
surpasses my expectations." 
303 
a practical botanist.
His library is rich in botany, 
and especially in Italian history and poetry.
I 
fancy myself at Lorenzo's own villa.
I expect my 
friend Caldwell from Dublin every day, and have 
some hopes of Mr. Griffiths coming to see me.
Two Miss Gleggs, very fine girls, his neighbours, 
have lately been here : one of them is a botanist, 
and we have had some rambles together.
The most interesting place I have seen, in itself, 
is Mr. Blundell's, of Ince, — rich in a profusion of 
antique sculptures, pictures, and marbles.
We had 
much entertaining talk about Italy, as he has often 
been there.
I just saw my old friend Broussonet for a few 
days : he touched at London in his way from Tene- 
riffe to France.
He is going to be professor of 
botany at Montpellier.
Yours most truly, 
J. E.
Smith.
As a botanist, Mr. Roscoe is distinguished for 
having thrown the best light upon the Scitamhica, 
a splendid tribe of plants, previously but little un- 
derstood, — " a very natural and important order, the 
eighth among the Fr-aginenta of Linnaeus, and equi- 
valent to the Ca?i7icB of Jussicu.
Its name alludes 
to the aromatic qualities of most of the species, and 
particularly to the use made of some of them in 
cookery or in medicine, — scitamentum being ex- 
pressive of anything rendered grateful to the palate 
by seasoning or other preparation.
Accordingly the 
Ginger, Turmeric, Zcdoary, and various sorts of 
304 
Cardamoms, belong to this order.
It stands between 
the OrchidecB and Spathacea.
" The genera referred to this order by Linnaeus 
are Afusa, Heliconia, Thalia, Maranta, Gtobba, 
Costus, Alpi?iia, Amomum, Curcuma, Kampferia, 
Canna, lienealmia, and Myrosma.
" The order of Scitaminece, including the Cannca, 
coming at the very threshold of the Linnaean arti- 
ficial system, and being in themselves very attrac- 
tive, curious, and rare, have particularly engaged 
the attention of several distinguished botanists, but 
with very unequal success.
No plants have been 
less understood by Linnaeus and his immediate fol- 
lowers, with regard to their genera, and the prin- 
ciples upon which they ought to be founded.
" Professor Swartz, who has so well illustrated the 
Orchidece, and whose attention was called to the 
ScitamifiecD by their near affinity to that tribe, has 
not thrown any light on their generic distribution.
The French botanists have done absolutely nothing 
to clear up this family, but have adopted the ideas 
and all the mistakes of Linnaeus.
"The most unfortunate attempt relative to the ge- 
nera of Scitaminea was made by Giseke, in his edi- 
tion of the lectures of Linnaeus upon the natural 
orders of plants, printed at Hamburgh in 1J92.
This writer, working with other people's materials, 
and destitute of practical experience, boldly under- 
took to new-model the whole order.
But as Gul- 
liver's mathematical tailor of Laputa, having made 
a mistake in the beginning of his calculation, 
brought him home a whole waggon-load of clothes, 
30.5 
so Giseke, setting out on erroneous principles, has 
presented us with a rumbling waggon-load of new 
hard-named genera, dismembering the old ones, not 
only by insufficient characters, but by characters 
that do not exist, and establishing new ones with as 
little scruple or success.
"Mr. Roscoe first suggested a method of reducing 
the genera of the Scita?ninece to regular order, by 
essential characters derived from the structure of 
the stamen, particularly its filament.
"This principle is found to be the only one which, 
while it is clear and precise in defining technical 
essential characters, leads to the establishment of 
natural genera.
" It must be observed, that the learned author of 
the Prodr.
Nov. Holl.
(Mr. R.
Brown,) follows the 
hypothesis of Jussieu in not allowing a corolla to 
these plants, inasmuch as they are monocotyle- 
donous.
" Mr. Roscoe's ideas of a Scitaminean flower are 
exactly consonant with Mr. Brown's, except that 
he considers the inner perianth of the Thalia as a 
corolla with a double limb, which is the most obvi- 
ously natural mode of considering it, and in which 
I without hesitation concur.
" The Scitaminea as well as the Cannes are pro- 
perly placed in the Monandria Monogynia of the 
Linnaean sexual system." (See Sir J.
E. Smith's ar- 
ticle Scitami?iece in Rees's Cyclopaedia.) 
In one of the latest letters addressed to Mr. Roscoe 
by Sir James, in 1827, he congratulates him on the 
VOL.
II.

:W6 
approaching conclusion of this " highly valuable 
and honourable work on Scitaminece, one of the few 
really original valuable and learned works in botany 
that this age has seen." 
The following imitation of the style of Ossian, by 
Sir James, may not be considered misplaced here : 
it is recalled to recollection by its title of ''Allerton," 
though it was written many years before the author 
had any knowledge of Mr. Roscoe, or of the spot 
where their friendship was begun and so happily 
matured ; and the scenery it describes applies, al- 
most as aptly as the name, to the residence of him 
who, in every place and situation, was the individual 
round whom Sir James's pride and his affection 
equally rallied, and who, to express his esteem for 
the subject of this memoir, had called him by the 
flattering appellation " the friend of my early days 
but lately found." 
" Fair art thou, O Allerton !
Lovely are thy 
green places and thy pleasant groves.
The forests 
of Gleddow are spread out as a carpet before thee, 
and thou numberest the cattle upon a thousand hills.
The great and the wealthy daily offer up incense at 
thy feet.
" The north wind maketh unto himself bowers 
of thy myrtles, and slumbereth on the velvet of thy 
lawn.
Thy fair plants bow before him at his 
awakening, and thy saplings are nursed in the 
storm.
" Terrible art thou, O Allerton, when the tern- 
307 
pests of heaven surround thee, when the sweet- 
smelling herb is swept from the face of the field, 
and the torrent stayeth not ; when the Thunderer 
establisheth his throne on thy mountain's brow, and 
the forests shiver before him.
Or, when the north 
wind rusheth forth in his fury, and fixeth his seal on 
the streams of the valley, then thou dealest out the 
snowy whirlwind, and the fruitful field becomes a 
trackless waste.
" Yet even then thy tender mercies are over thine 
adopted children ; and while thy more hardy off- 
spring sport in the whirlwind, and brave the unre- 
lenting storm, thou shelterest in thy warm bosom 
full many a tender nursling, and sufferest not even 
thy summer zephyrs to visit their face too roughly: 
they are grateful for thy kindness, and ofFer their 
flowery tribute to thee in peace.
" Yea, truly glorious art thou, O Allerton, in 
thy summer attire, when thou, kind stepmother !
sendest forth the children of Flora to sport on the 
lawn, where they drink health and beauty from the 
nectar of the evening, and give their fragrance to 
the morning gale : then exultest thou in their well- 
being, as they open their pure bosoms to the sun.
He smileth on them, and they are g;lad.
" Yet even most lovely art thou, when the length- 
ened shadows of the mountains obscure the valley ; 
when the declining sun gildeth the tufted forests of 
Gleddow, and empurpleth the little hills on every 
side ; when thy clear eye seeth new mountains afar 
off that the noontide splendour had eclipsed.
Then 
x 2 
308 
a little while, and the moon cometh forth in the 
east : the shades of Gleddow acknowledge her silver 
footsteps.
Is the fair moon thine handmaid, O 
Allerton !
that she watcheth thy children as they 
sleep ?
Or doth she delight in the music of the 
nymphs of Gleddow, as their light hands touch the 
harp of many silver strings ?
Sweet are the wood- 
notes of the nymphs of Gleddow.
Methinks their 
imperfect sounds now vibrate in mine ear ; or do I 
hear the drowsy tinkling of the flocks, as they wind 
slowly along the distant mountain's brow ?
Now 
the rising zephyr swells the lengthened notes, — 
even now — Hark !
— they are still !" 
J. E.
Smith to Mr. Roscoe.
My dear Sir, Norwich, Aug. 25, 1803.
Finding myself at length settled at home, and a 
little composed, I sit down to converse a few mi- 
nutes with you, and to transport myself in thought 
at least into your society.
How many times shall I 
wish that I could do so in reality !
I could not at 
parting say anything that I wished to say.
My 
young companion, as well as myself, thought every- 
thing during our ride the rest of the day uninter- 
esting, and Manchester the most comfortless place 
we had ever seen.
We stopped there merely to 
take my favourite refreshment, tea, and then pro- 
ceeded to Disley.
Here we found ourselves in quiet, 
and could talk of Allerton and you.
The next

morning at seven we mounted the top of a coaeh, 
and had a delightful ride over the highest parts of 
Derbyshire, through Buxton and Ashbourne, — a 
beautiful spot.
We stepped into the church, while 
the organ played the Hundredth Psalm, to see the 
tomb of poor Sir B.
Boothby's Penelope.
The sta- 
tue was covered, but I had seen it in London.
You 
know the lines from Petrarch which are on the base: 
" Le crespe chiome, 1' angelico riso, &c 
Poco polvere son che nulla sente." * 
There is also a passage, — I think from Rousseau, but 
am not certain, — something to this effect : "Son cer- 
cueil ne la contlcnt pas toute entire.
II attend le 
reste de sa proye ; mais il ne Vattendra pas long 
terns.''' 
We arrived at Matlock by dinner-time on Sun- 
day, and spent the two following davs in that sweet 
spot.
We saw Burleigh House in our way.
I had 
seen it twice before, but did not remember that it 
contained so many very fine pictures.
My heart sinks as I now see before me plants 
and books, the relics of my beloved friend Davall, 
who languished to see me in Switzerland, — as I do to 
have you here, — and never had his wishes gratified: 
yet I will hope ; as Allerton is nearer than Orbe, 
* The lines from Petrarch quoted in this letter were great 
favourites of the writer of it ; and he attempted to give them an 
English dress, retaining their peculiar expression : 
" The crisped locks of pure refulgent gold, 
The lambent lightning of the angelic smile, 
That made on earth a paradise e'erwhile, 
Are now but senseless dust, beneath this marble cold." 
310 
and you have promised.
In the mean time, I am 
eager to welcome Lorenzo to my library.
Allow me to subscribe myself 
Your most obliged and affectionate Friend, 
J. E.
Smith.
From Mr. Hoscoe.
My dear Sir, Allerton, Aug. 28, 1803.
Amidst our frequent recollections of you at Al- 
lerton, we had begun to feel some anxiety on your 
account, which would by no means have been di- 
minished, had we known that you had been career- 
ing over the hills of Derbyshire on the top of a 
coach.
Your letter has arrived just in time to al- 
leviate our apprehensions, and to add to the cheer- 
fulness of our Sunday's dinner, where you have as 
many friends as we number individuals.
In rejoic- 
ing with you, as I most truly do, on your restoration 
to domestic happiness, I feel however a selfish hope 
that it may encourage you at no distant period to 
pay another visit to Liverpool, and that you will 
prevail on Mrs. Smith to accompany you.
I had 
almost begun to suspect that the cares of the world 
or the lapse of years had blunted in me those feel- 
ings and diminished that capacity of attachment 
which in youth is so ardently experienced : but the 
fortunate incident which introduced me to your ac- 
quaintance has restored me to a better opinion of 
myself; and however I may regret that we did not 
meet sooner, I gratify myself in regarding you as a 
friend of my early days but lately found ; if indeed 
311 
I can be said lately to have found one whom I have 
known so long in his writings, and to whom I have 
been indebted for much pleasure and some improve- 
ment.
Towards the beginning of October, our curator 
Mr. Shepherd will, I presume, make his excursion to 
look through the nurseries of London, and is highly 
pleased with the thoughts of seeing you at Norwich 
on his return.
I believe no person living will re- 
gard the sacred relics of Linnaeus with greater ve- 
neration than this uneducated son of the art.
We 
have lately devoted a day to the examination of the 
Pancratiums, Crinums, and Amaryllises, and have 
found it a subject not without difficulty.
I shall 
only observe, that the plant which we saw at Lord 
Derby's, which is now in flower with me, and which 
I called the Crinum americanam, is, I believe, the 
C. latifolium of Linnaeus, — the Amaryllis laiifolia 
of L'Heritier, — which I mention only for the pur- 
pose of correcting my own mistake.
Whilst debarred of your society, I shall enjoy the 
prospect and possibility of seeing you for a few 
days at Norwich, and extending still further those 
attachments of which I find myself yet susceptible, 
among those connexions and friends whom you 
have already taught me to esteem.
And now, my dear Sir, I have only at present to 
say, that if I thought our epistolary intercourse 
were to close with the interchange of a letter, I 
should be highly mortified.
I well know the mul- 
tiplicity of your avocations, and should be truly 
sorry to intrude on them : nor am I in general a very 
312 
vigilant correspondent; yet I shall occasionally take 
up my pen, if for no other purpose, to give you 
some account of our proceedings here, and to ar- 
range with you many things which we talked about 
but left unfinished.
Believe me at all times 
Your very affectionate and faithful Friend, 
\V.
Roscoe.
Sir «/.
E. Smith to Mr. Roscoe.
My dear Sir, Norwich, September 23.
1803.
I am afraid you will begin to think me unworthy 
of your wish that " our correspondence should not 
be limited to two letters." If, however, you imagine 
that this wish or any other kind expression in your 
truly acceptable letter is not deeply and gratefully felt 
by me, you do me injustice.
Let me explain what 
has prevented my writing sooner.
Early in this 
month we went to Yarmouth, and spent five days 
with my friend Dawson Turner ; he and I had 
enough to do with our Mosses and Lichens, and I 
had much to learn from him about German corre- 
spondence ; for he is so good as to relieve me from 
the burthen of dealing with those indefatigable 
writers and questioners, the German naturalists.
He 
is about printing a neat little book on the Mosses 
of Ireland.
We then visited my wife's relations 
at Lowestofft and Saxmundham, twenty-four miles 
further in a very pleasant country, tame compared 
with your noble scenes, but rich, woody, highly cul- 
tivated, and in most seasons verdant, — though the 
313 
present summer has almost burnt up this whole 
eastern country.
Here was scarcely any rain from 
April till the middle of September.
I could like, one day, to show you this very tour 
we took ; it would be new at least to you, and I 
think you would find objects of amusement and cu- 
riosity.
The printer's devil summoned me home, 
and I am not yet out of his clutches with regard to 
FloraBritannica,a.
sheet or two of which stands still 
till I have made up my mind about some knotty 
points respecting Mosses.
You can hardly be aware 
how much labour these little plants cost me, nor 
what obscurity there is among them ; yet, when 
carefully studied, they amply repay our care by their 
beauty, the precision of most of their characters, 
and the admirable exercise they afford to a syste- 
matic mind.
The difficulties are chiefly caused by 
the inaccuracy of preceding writers.
The Junger- 
mannice and Lichens, which I must next take in hand, 
are in some instances more variable and uncertain ; 
but I must get through them, — and then I think 
all other botanical labours will comparatively be 
repose.
The sulphur-coloured Lichen I found on 
your house is, as I thought, L.
orostheus of Acharius, 
never before noticed amongst us.
I am particularly 
pleased at having to quote Allerton for a new plant.
I shall soon begin eagerly to expect my friend 
Shepherd.
How welcome will a Liverpool face be to 
me !
Of Salices you know I promise him a harvest.
Is not your plant Crinum erubescens P C.
latifolium 
as figured in Rudbeck (copied, I belie ve, from Hort, 
Malabar.) seems broader in leaves and petals.
314 
Yours seems C.
crubescens of Redout's Plantes Li~ 
liac&s, fasc.
5. Are not your flowers tinged exter- 
nally with purple ?
and sessile ?
How gladly shall I cherish the hope of seeing you 
and Mrs. Roscoe here !
Drake is much flattered 
by your mention of him.
He is now reading your 
Lorenzo, having just read Tcnhove.
He enters fully 
into the subject, and reads with as much profit as 
most young people : I perceive your character has 
made a deep impression on his mind.
You did not 
perhaps observe that he was in tears almost all the 
way to Prescot.
I know not whether to regret that 
age when tears of the mind so easily find vent at the 
eyes ; but I love to contemplate it in others.
I am 
anxious to hear how Mr. W.
Roscoe's health is : we 
have just been admiring his " lily by moonlight." I 
think his youthful spirit aims at removing by exer- 
tion what would most easily yield to repose and 
care.
Inflammatory disorders are never to be rubbed 
off by neglect ; they are the reverse of nervous or 
low diseases, and much more rare.
Your ever affectionate Friend, 
J. E.
Smith.
Sir */.
E. Smith to Mr. Roscoe.
My dear Friend, Norwich, October 6, 1803.
I did not think of writing to you just now ; but 
a melancholy event has just reached my knowledge 
which you no doubt have heard already ; and on the 
subject of which my first feelings seem inclined to 
relieve themselves by having recourse to you.
315 
My good and kind host, my oldest friend out of 
my own family, is no more !* We were children to- 
gether ; and, in all our childish amusements, he, 
being a year older than I, was always my instructor 
and example.
When he went to boarding-school, it 
was the first real trial of my fortitude ; and he was 
my first correspondent.
I used to dream night after 
night that he was come home for the holidays; and 
then a more impressive dream would tell me that 
though the former were delusions, he was then cer- 
tainly come.
He then went to Liverpool ; — time, 
new connexions and pursuits, made us less interested 
in each other ; but we had no other cause of estrange- 
ment ; we met occasionally in London with mutual 
pleasure, though we had not so many ideas in com- 
mon as heretofore.
At length my fortunate visit to 
Liverpool, — in the planning of which I found all the 
original friendship and benevolence of his heart ex- 
erted themselves as warmly for me as ever, — promised 
the revival of our old attachment during our lives, 
and I little expected that period would be so very 
short.
He was literally to me the " recovered friend 
of youth," which you in so flattering and engaging 
a manner imagine me to be to you.
Is it not evi- 
dent how warmly I accede to the adoption, when in 
my present anxiety I recur to you for comfort, and 
trust to you to bear with my tedious complainings, 
as is the duty and pleasure of an old friend ?
We 
parted for the last time at your door ; you had wit- 
* Mr. Thomas Taylor of Liverpool, brother to Mr. John 
Taylor of Norwich (see above, page 100), and youngest grandson 
of Dr. John Taylor, author of the Paraphrase on the Epistle to 
the Romans, &c.
316 
nessed his eagerness and anxiety to serve me ; nor 
can I ever forget his benevolent, unobtrusive, and 
unostentatious hospitality, — his'hearty welcome, the 
freedom with which he told me all his concerns, and 
the pleasure he took in recalling the events of our 
youth.
Even on subjects of mere amusement or 
taste we had much to say, and he had a peculiarly 
obliging attention to pursuits that were more exclu- 
sively my own, because they were mine.
His heart 
was in no degree worse for living in the world, but 
in some points I have thought it improved ; this 
might be owing to a slight cloud of ill success which 
had but too often accompanied his path.
He was 
always more successful in serving others than him- 
self.
But I sincerely believe he had nothing to re- 
gret on his death-bed.
He never gave his friends a 
pang while he lived ; but many a tear of the purest, 
most disinterested affection will be shed over his 
grave.
Excuse me, my good friend, for writing you 
so unentertaining a letter ; it is really for'my own 
pleasure rather than yours, and yet I will not con- 
clude it without a piece of business, about which 
1 had it in contemplation to give you a line in a few 
days.
I forgot in my last to mention some direc- 
tions for Mr. Shepherd your curator, when he gets 
to London.
If he will call at Sir Abraham Hume's 
in Hill Street, Berkeley Square, I will previously 
give Lady Hume a letter, and I doubt not she will 
show him her plants at Wormleybury, fifteen miles 
north of London.
He will find her extremely ready 
to give or exchange plants.
He ought also to see 
Mr. George Hibbert's garden at Clapham, and may 
go and introduce himself there as my friend.
He 
31/ 
is very rich in Cape plants, and you could help him 
to West Indian ones.
Mr. Woodford's garden at 
Vauxhall he ought by all means to see, and he will 
need no introduction except telling who he is : — he 
may make any use of my name.
Adieu, my dear friend !
I shall think it long till I 
see your handwriting.
Remember me most kindly to 
Mrs. Roscoe and all your family.
Believe me ever most truly yours, 
J. E.
Smith.
Mr. Roscoe to Si?' J.
E. Smith.
Primo giorno dell' anno 1804.
Bno?i capo oT an?io, Signore mio stimatissimo, ed 
a voi e alia vostra carissima Signora Sposa !
How can I begin the present year better than by 
addressing myself to you, from whose society and 
friendship I have derived so much pleasure during 
the past !
The day is fine with us ; a great part of 
my young family are visiting their aunt in Liver- 
pool.
I have thrown aside my ponderous volumes 
about the ambition of princes and the intrigues of 
popes, to take a momentary retrospect of the past 
year, in the most pleasant part of which I find you 
occupy the principal station : you will therefore re- 
gard this letter as un pegno oV amici%ia, to be annu- 
ally renewed.
To promise for our whole lives at 
once would be improvident ; as it would deprive us 
of that repetition which the ordinary course of Pro- 
vidence may yet allow, and which I trust we shall 
many times have occasion to employ.
318 
A most violent effort to free myself from the 
heavy task in which I am engaged, and the continual 
pressure of business, with my journeys between Al- 
lerton and Liverpool, have so devoured every mo- 
ment of my time, that day by day has passed on till 
the conclusion of the year, without my being able 
to fulfill my wishes.
I am now, however, deter- 
mined to be somewhat more my own master.
Since 
you left Liverpool, I have copied and prepared for 
the press as much as will compose my two first vo- 
lumes.
The remainder is in great forwardness, and if 
I enjoy my health for a few months, will I hope be 
completed.
M'Creery begins to print with the new 
year, and promises to proceed with great rapidity.
My arrangements are all made to my satisfaction, 
and some time in the ensuing year I expect to make 
my appearance before the public in the pompous 
shape of four ample quartos.
The labour of cor- 
recting I consider as nothing in comparison with 
that which I have had in the composition of this 
work ; and hence, though much remains to be done, 
I find my mind lighter than it has been in the sur- 
vey of the long and tedious road that lay before me.
You, who have so often engaged in important literary 
undertakings, will know how to sympathize with a 
brother author in the enthusiasm of his pursuit, the 
apprehensions of disappointment, the lassitude of 
fatigue, and the cheering prospect of success, and 
will easily perceive that as the barometer rises or 
falls through these degrees, it constitutes the foul 
or fair weather of human life.
If you will take the trouble to desire any friend of 
319 
yours in London to call on Messrs.
Cadell and Da- 
vies in your name, they will have directions to deliver 
him a copy of a poem called " The Press," written 
by my printer here, and published as a specimen of 
typography, which for the excellence of its mecha- 
nical execution, and the beauty of the engravings on 
wood, will certainly gratify the eye, whatever may 
be its effect on the understanding, about which I 
really believe the author himself is less anxious than 
about the sharpness of his letter and the blackness 
of his ink.
It would be heretical to conclude without a single 
word about botanical pursuits.
Two of our new 
houses are completed and filled with plants, and the 
other five will now soon be finished.
Shepherd says 
we may challenge all the kingdom in point both of 
elegance and convenience.
He desired that when I 
wrote I would inform you that the Willows are 
safely arrived, for which, in the name of my brethren 
and myself, I beg to return you our best acknow- 
ledgements.
We join in every kind wish to Mrs. Smith and 
yourself.
Your very faithful Friend, 
W. Roscoe.
I am highly delighted with your song : the two lines, 
" Yon speck in night's retiring veil, 
None but a lover's eyes could spy," 
are not excelled in poetry, feeling, and picturesque 
truth, by any passage I know.
If this be your first 
attempt, you ought to exclaim, in the words of a 
320 
wicked Italian, in allusion to a very different sub- 
ject,— 
" Piango perche di cio tardi un'accorsi 
A cui dovea piu di buon ora attendere;" 
and I hope you will endeavour to make up for your 
lost time by producing other pieces of equal merit.* 
* The editor is here tempted to give the entire song which 
was thus mentioned by a partial friend.
SONG.
The morning o'er the ocean breaks, 
The orient waves are liquid fire, 
While William from the topmast seeks 
All that his fondest hopes desire.
Yon speck in night's retiring veil 
None but a lover's eyes could spy — 
" 'Tis land !
'tis England !
messmates, hail !
" 
" 'Tis land !" the joyful crew reply.
" Oh Mary !
is thy tender breast 
Still to thy William fond and true, 
As when we first our love confest ?
As when with tears we bade adieu?
" 
Propitious gales and swelling waves 
To William faint and tardy seem — 
But now the lab'ring ocean heaves, 
And thunders roll and lightnings gleam.
And now the shatter'd bark no more 
Resists the sweeping whirlwind's sway; 
It shivers on its native shore, 
And death and horror close the daj T .
But love survives the wasting storm ; 
O'er William harmless thunders roll ; 
His Mary clasps his clay-cold form, 
Her breath recalls his fleeting soul.
321 
The following translation after Martial, from the 
same hand, and in a different style, may possibly 
not displease the reader.
Go mingle Arabia's gums 
With the spices all India yields ; 
Go crop each young flower as it blooms ; 
Go ransack the gardens and fields.
Let Paestum, so fragrant and gay, 
Its roses profusely bestow; 
Go catch the light breezes that play 
Where the wild thyme and marjoram grow.
Let every pale night-scented flower, 
Sad emblem of passion forlorn, 
Resign its appropriate hour, 
To enhance the rich breath of the morn.
All that art or that nature can find 
Not half so delightful would prove, 
Nor their sweets all together combined, 
Half so sweet as the breath of my love.
Sir J.
E. Smith to Mr. Roscoe.
My dear Sir, Norwich, January 16, 1804.
I congratulate you sincerely on beginning to 
print your great work ; but I must not yet begin to 
think of reading it, — that will serve to make me an- 
ticipate next winter with pleasure.
I hope very soon 
to bring out the third volume of my Flora ; it is 
small compared to your work, but the labour of the 
Mosses was very great.
I can scarcely hope that you 
will find a moment to look at that part ; I must be 
content with the quiet approbation of half a score 
hard-working Germans, and they will I am sure see

much to correct, even if they approve my congenial 
plodding.
As to systematic niceties, I scarcely know 
any one that is competent, who will take the pains 
to follow me.
As to Columna, the Phytobasanos 
is a mere curiosity, it being the first botanical book 
ever printed with copper-plates ; but there is a mo- 
dern edition of it nearly as useful.
It is excessively 
rare.
The Ecphrasis is inestimable for use, and 
daily in my hands.
It has never been republished.
I am, my dear Sir, yours, &c.
J. E.
Smith.
From the same.
My dear Friend, Norwich, November 5, 1804.
What a long time it is since I wrote to you !
Your 
letter is dated July 25th.
Since that time we have 
spent a month at Lowestofft with my wife's relations, 
and returned to enjoy the company of our amiable 
friends and relations the Kindersleys.
My mother 
and all of us are looking forward to next summer.
May nothing happen to disappoint us !
I am pre- 
paring an entirely new course of lectures for London 
and you.
My Exotic Botany is to appear Dec. 1st.
I shall have the pleasure of dedicating it to you, if 
you will allow me by that means to commemorate our 
friendship : though short, its growth has been vigo- 
rous ; and if there be some vanity in the wish that my 
name may be associated with yours in some corner 
of fame's records, I hope it is a pardonable vanity.
Those more private ties which have bound us toge- 
323 
ther will at the last day atone for it.
How does your 
Leo go on ?
Mr. Johnes writes to me that his se- 
cond volume of Froissart is already in London, the 
third will be done by Christmas, and the fourth in 
June : it is very entertaining.
Pray do you take 
the Annals of Botany, by Sims and Koenig?
I think 
it a useful and amusing publication, and mean to 
send a paper to it, for the next number, (if it can be 
admitted,) on the decandrous papilionaceous plants 
of New Holland, which want clearing up, and I 
flatter myself I have found a clue to them.
Believe me, my dear Sir, 
Ever yours most affectionately, 
J. E.
Smith.
Mr. Roscoe to Sir J.
E. Smith.
My dear Sir, Liverpool, November 22, 1804.
A letter from a friend after a long silence affects 
me with a feeling somewhat like returning home 
after a long absence.
Yours came, too, at such a time 
that, if anything could have increased its value, cer- 
tainly did so ; as I received it from the hands of 
Mrs. Martin on Thursday last, just after enjoying a 
cheerful dinner with her and a family party of friends.
To have buried it coolly in my pocket for two or 
three hours would have been a proof of more sto- 
icism than I possess, and I therefore quitted the tea- 
party to converse with you for a few minutes tete-a~ 
tHe^ which I concluded by resolving that I would 
instantly thank you for the additional instances of 
your remembrance and friendship which it contains.
Y 2 
324 
Such, however, is the rapid flight of time with me 
at present, that some days have elapsed before I 
could find an opportunity of performing my rash 
vow.
I shall now, however, hold him by the fore- 
lock till my engagement is performed.
I am sure I need not tell you that all our Liver- 
pool friends who have seen Mrs. Martin are charmed 
with her.
How, indeed, should it be otherwise ?
My 
wife is delighted beyond measure, and I really be- 
lieve will contrive to get her good opinion in return.
Surely no chemical affinity is stronger than that of 
similar hearts ; distance itself forms no bar to it, 
as I feel at this moment.
The honour which you so kindly propose to con- 
fer on me on the publication of your Exotic Botany 
ought to give me unqualified pleasure ; — to see our 
names united must always do so.
Yet I cannot 
help feeling as if the world were turned upside- 
dow-n, and am sure that my name, instead of occu- 
pying the top of the page, should be placed at the 
bottom.
I cannot, however, find in my heart to say 
that if you can put a face upon it, I shall not be 
highly gratified, and shall endeavour to hold up my 
head as w r ell as I can during the remainder of my 
days.
Mr. Shepherd sent Lady Hume a few plants about 
tw r o months ago.
I have since heard from her, with 
a specimen of the Humea, w T hich I think w r ell de- 
serves the name of elegans, in reference both to the 
plant and its patroness.
You will, I am sure, rejoice 
with me, when I tell you that Leo is now in the 
latter part of the fourth volume, and will yet, I hope, 
325 
be nearly finished by the time I proposed, — the end 
of the year ; such an exertion has seldom been made 
by a printer, as you will say when you see these pon- 
derous tomes.
You will begin to think that when I once told you 
that I was a bad correspondent, I was acting the 
part of a coquette, who pretends to be shy of her 
favours only that they may be more highly valued ; 
but however bountiful you may think I have been 
of late, I must beg you to present my love to Mrs.
Smith, and tell her in return I transmit my wife's 
love to you.
And now, my dear friend, let me se- 
riously tell you that I love you both better than I 
once thought it would ever have been my lot to have 
loved again ; and that the friendship which I have 
been so happy as to form with you (for I will not 
call it acquaintance,) will always be numbered 
among the most fortunate events in the life of 
Your ever affectionate and faithful Servant, 
W. Roscoe, 
From the same.
My dear Sir, Allerton, May 26, 1805.
I have long intended to write to you, but have 
been prevented by a continual succession of un- 
avoidable occupation and bodily indisposition, and 
sometimes by the junction of both.
Leo's reckoning is now made, and he must be 
sent to his account with all his imperfections.
In 
the course of a few days after this comes to hand, 
you will receive a copy, which from its size would 
326 
terrify a man of much less occupation than your- 
self, and which you will naturally lay aside till you 
can muster courage and find time to make so for- 
midable an attack.
Of the reception of this work, 
I am in many respects doubtful ; but I do not suffer 
my apprehensions to render me miserable.
I have 
taken all the pains in my power to make it deserv- 
ing - of the public notice, and have endeavoured to 
express the peculiar opinions which it may contain 
with decency, though with freedom.
If all this will 
not do, I cannot help it ; nor would I alter or sup- 
press those opinions to obviate censure or obtain 
applause.
In one place or another I have found an 
opportunity of expressing my sentiments on the 
great subjects of politics, morals, religion, and taste, 
as well as on a variety of inferior topics, which I 
hope are not impertinently introduced ; and by these 
sentiments I am content to be judged of as long as 
my book may continue to be read.
Be assured, my dear friend, that I look forward 
to our meeting again at Allerton with a satisfaction 
that I should find it difficult to express.
Let me 
hear from you soon, and believe me ever affection- 
ately and truly yours, 
W. Roscoe.
Sir J.
E. Smith to Mr. Roscoe.
My dear Friend, Norwich, October 12, 1805.
I send you a budget about the Plantce Scitaminea, 
which will, I hope, be of some use and amusement 
to you.
May you feel as much pleasure in studying 
327 
it for my sake, as I have had in preparing it for 
yours!
We had a good journey ; and at Cambridge saw 
the famous Ceres.
Ely and its line cathedral de- 
tained us two or three hours.
The tower is noble, 
and the west front as sharp and perfect as if just 
now finished.
The chapels are beyond any thing 
for rich carving.
Inclosed are two pods of Vanilla, picked up in 
some shop when I was in Italy; — you will find their 
perfume still very powerful.
We saw Raphael's picture at Okeover ; 'tis an un- 
doubted original ; — the countenances fine, colour- 
ing dark (perhaps changed), some parts incorrect 
in drawing.
What I most wondered at is the exqui- 
site effect of the bed-clothes and pillow of the cra- 
dle, equal to any Dutch picture, yet not laboured in 
the same way.
It is one of those Holy Families of 
which Raphael at one time painted many, before he 
arrived at his last historical perfection.
My Exotic Botany has been much more fortu- 
nate in Baldwin's Literary Journal than your Leo ; 
you know the fable of the Oak and the Bramble.
Pray remember us most kindly to Mrs. Roscoe 
and all your beloved children.
I flatter myself I shall 
always have an interest in their hearts.
I know not how to finish my letter, for it seems 
like taking leave again.
Let us lessen the distance 
between us as much as possible by correspondence.

Dr. Bostock to Sir «/.
JE, Smith.
Dear Sir, Liverpool, January 26, 180G.
I thank you for your letter containing the speci- 
mens of native Camphor.
At present the nature of 
the substance appears to me quite incomprehensi- 
ble.
I have not yet performed all the experiments 
upon it that I propose to do.
You will be happy 
to hear that our worthy friend Shepherd is well, and 
continues his exertions, with his usual success, in 
the garden.
Even since you left us we have got 
some considerable additions to our collection.
It 
would, I am confident, give you great concern to 
observe the unprincipled attack which is made upon 
Leo X.
in the Critical Review, — not that it will af- 
fect the equanimity, or perhaps the reputation of 
the author ; but it is painful to observe that such a 
spirit of illiberality can be sanctioned, by being ad- 
mitted into the pages of one of our most popular 
periodical works.
Surely the writer must be a 
stranger to our friend ; it would be impossible for 
any one who knew him to treat him so ungene- 
rously.
Believe me your faithful Friend, 
J. Bostock.
Sir J .
E. Smith to Mr. Roscoe.
My dear Sir, Norwich, April 2, 1S0G.
I hope you have not been uneasy for the fate of 
your Essay on Monandrian Plants.
I now sit down 
to thank you for your letter of the 1st of March, 
329 
and to tell you what I have done to your paper.
I 
should not be worthy of your friendship if I did not 
exeeutc my trust faithfully.
First, then, you may be 
assured, as far as I have any judgement, (and I have 
been privy to.
many a consultation with Dryander 
about these plants,) that your paper, both in its aim 
and execution, will do you great honour as a botanist, 
and render a material piece of service to the science.
No one before you has given any plausible account of 
these genera, as you well know.
Your treatise is a 
plain, clear, unaffected discourse.
Perhaps I was, at 
first reading it, disappointed that you had not made 
something more of it in the way of composition, with 
respect to ornament or episode, because I know that 
you are one of the few, who, with real science, could 
have done so.
But this might have been " soaring 
above the path of true simplicity," and the more I 
read your paper, the less I feel any want of such 
adventitious merits ; — I only mention all that has 
occurred to my mind.
The leading qualities of 
these plants, their beauty, their fragrance, their 
affinity or resemblance to Palms or Orchidece, 
whether real or supposed, the hot and moist climates 
which they prefer, — these N things might have been 
alluded to.
I should not, however, regret that 
scarcely any other pen than yours had passed them 
over.
You and I may congratulate one another on our 
good-humoured critics.
I have composed a new 
introductory lecture for the Royal Institution.
It 
will refute Salisbury, and yet not honour him with 
apparent notice.
I think your critic an angel (or at 
330 
least only a tawny devil,) compared with mine ; yet 
I have been so forgiving as to make a motto for his 
Paradisus.
What malice lurks beneath this fair disguise !
The devil again in paradise tells lies !
But now, how plausible soe'er his tale is, 
We always take his words cum grano salts.
So, my dear friend, as we are both got to the devil, 
we can be no worse, and may as well enjoy all that 
this world still affords us ; which that we may long 
do is the prayer of your affectionate Friend, 
J. E.
Smith.
From the same.
My dear Friend, Blackheath, June 2, 180G.
Your paper was highly approved by everybody.
Dryander (no complimenter,) was excited by it to 
take up the subject afresh ; and he and I went care- 
fully over your whole paper, turning to references, 
specimens, &c.
I have already received the highest 
compliment possible from Aiton and Lambert, who, 
on hearing your paper, conceived that you could 
scarcely have had knowledge or materials to com- 
pose it, and that I must have written it !
— See what 
it is to have a name !
I certainly could not have 
written it.
I have satisfied them with the real truth, 
and Dryander also.
With this view I purposely let 
him read over your original MS., and see all my 
scratches and alterations, which being so few, and 
chiefly about technical matters, could do you no 
discredit.
I wish you, therefore, carefully to pre- 
331 
serve this original manuscript as it is; it had best be 
printed from this present copy, which must then be 
preserved in the archives of our Linnaean Society.
J. E.
Smith.
Mr. Roscoe to Sir J.
E. Smith.
My dear Friend, Allerton, October 5, 1806.
By an omission of the bookseller's it was not till 
yesterday that I got a sight of the Exotic Botany for 
September, and had the pleasure of seeing the fine 
plant figured, to which you have done me the great 
and unmerited honour of annexing my name.
I have accurately examined your delineation and 
description, and certainly think it a good genus.
It 
is most nearly allied to Hedychium ; and if, accord- 
ing to the system which I have attempted to lay 
down, I cannot admit that the irregularity of the 
exterior limb of the corolla affords a genuine distinc- 
tion, yet the very singularly curved anthera, with its 
two appendages, is amply sufficient to establish it as 
a genus ; which the irregularity of the corolla may 
be allowed to confirm.
To Kampferia its affinity is 
merely in its exterior appearance ; in its botanical 
characters it is wholly distinct.
I therefore flatter 
myself that this nymph of the Asiatic mountains 
will, like a faithful spouse, retain the name which 
you have imposed upon her ; and not, like too 
many of her sisterhood, elope to some more fa- 
voured admirer.
W. Roscoe.

Sir J.
E. Smith to Mr. Roscoe.
My dear Friend, Norwich, Oct. 1G, 1806.
I am glad you assent to the character of Roscoca ; 
but please to observe the irregularity of the corolla 
is no less essential than the form of the filament, 
&c.
We must never confine our essential characters 
to one part of the fructification, though one part 
may give the leading mark.
Corrca has an idea 
that in every natural order there are one or more 
genera with an irregular flower, and one or more 
with a regular one.
Since I heard this I have kept 
it in view, and have seen much to confirm it ; yet I 
cannot think of a regular flower among the Legu- 
minosa, nor of an irregular one in the Caryophyllece; 
but some may occur.
Saxifraga sarmentosa is the irregular flower in 
its natural order, and surely a distinct genus from 
Saccifraga.
So Celsia differs from Verbascum, I 
think essentially.
Iberis is the irregular flower in 
its order, where one would least expect to find any.
I have got a copy of Sir Joseph Banks's sketch, 
made in his voyage, of the HuraSiamensium, which, 
with the description in Retzius, are all we have to 
know that plant by.
It is a Globba, with two lobes 
of the corolla hoisted up half way of the filament !
So parliament is dissolved !
I hope we shall have 
no opposition for Norwich.
J. E.
Smith.

My dear Friend, Nov. 8, 1S0G.
As it will cost you nothing, I write you a line to 
say that I have this day been returned as one of the 
members for Liverpool, by a majority over both the 
other candidates.
A fortnight ago I should as soon 
have thought of being the Great Mogul.
Present my kind remembrances to Mrs. Smith, 
who will rejoice with me on this occasion ; and 
believe me, my dear Friend, at all times most truly 
yours, 
W. Roscoe.
Sir J.
E. Smith to Mr. Roscoe.
My dear Friend, Norwich, Nov. 11, 180C.
You are beforehand with me ; for it was my in- 
tention to have written by this post to congratulate 
you on the event of which the newspaper today 
gave us the first certain intelligence ; but the hopes 
and fears belonging to it have occupied our minds 
ever since the first mention of your nomination.
After a long and very pleasant country walk this 
fine day, I found your letter on my table.
How 
kind and flattering was it of you to write to me the 
very day, when you must have been so busy, so agi- 
tated, and fatigued !
Your letter, and especially 
y owe first frank, will be kept by me as relics.
My 
brother and sister Martin have been very good in 
writing frequently concerning the state of the poll, 
334 
and all the circumstances of this " almost painfully 
interesting event," as she justly termed it while it 
was in suspense ; and this day brought my wife a 
most delightful letter from her*.
Yet I assure you 
all this intelligence was by no means equal to our 
anxiety.
What with telling and inquiring, and 
seeking every day and almost every hour for the 
most probable, authentic newspapers, where we 
might find the poll or any mention of you, my house 
has been turned topsy-turvy.
Now we have enough 
to do to give and receive congratulations.
No 
other event than this could have consoled us in any 
degree for the loss of Mr. Win.
Smith.
He, good 
man !
bears it with the equanimity and dignity 
worthy of himself.
But, my dear Friend, your election seems like a 
dream.
I say frequently to myself, " Can this be r" 
and during the contest I have endeavoured to think 
* Inclosing the following lines, written by Mrs. Martin, 
On the Election of Mr. Roscoe for Liverpool.
Unstain'd is the glory of him, who, elected 
By the voice of the people, with honour is crown'd ; 
The oak shall wave o'er him, the rose shall bedeck him, 
And the loudest applauses be echoed around.
From Arno's sweet vale with the Muses retiring, 
Where Painting and Poetry hail'd him their son ; 
Now greater his glory, midst senates haranguing, 
To plead for humanity's cause as his own, 
Give the shout, O his townsmen !
o'er France let it echo ; 
Through the valleys of Tuscany loud let it roll ; 
But soft let it float o'er the far-spreading waters, 
And whisper sweet peace to the African s soul.
335 
I should be satisfied if you had but a respectable 
poll, and merely by the influence of what I scarcely 
thought this bad world could feel and value in any 
just degree : — this is beyond all hope !
Yet all my 
joy, and even my affectionate feelings towards you 
personally, are absorbed in one consideration, too 
awful and transcendently important to be mixed 
with any other, — I mean the effect of this blessed 
event upon the fate of thousands, nay millions of 
happy Africans !
Generations will succeed one 
another in peace and tranquillity, who will never 
know your name, indeed, but it will be treasured in 
" The bosom of their Father and their God." 
I feel that nothing could give so decisive a blow to 
the slave-trade, — such a public avowal that even 
Liverpool can do better without it, as the choice of 
you, the open and powerful enemy of that trade, to 
be the guardian of the interests of the town which 
is supposed to live by it !
If ten righteous persons 
could have saved a town from destruction, surely 
1157 will wipe away all reproach; and the rest of 
the nation will be ashamed to countenance this 
national sin any longer.
How deeply do we enter into the sensations of 
all your family on this occasion !
I trust the sacri- 
fices which must in some degree be made of domes- 
tic tranquillity, will be compensated by the unli- 
mited increase of genuine honour and respect with 
which you will be surrounded, and the extended 
value of even your existence.
I look far beyond 
the present moment, and I see one or more of your 
33G 
sons trained up to be your colleagues and succes- 
sors.
If Shenstonc could see in a village school, 
" A little bench of heedless bishops here, — 
And there a chancellor in embryo," 
so can I see in my friend Mr. Henry, chaired (as 
doubtless he now is,) round the gardens at Aller- 
ton, the embryo of what his father is now be- 
come.
I know not whether your chairing is like ours 
at Norwich, — but when the poles of the chair are 
tossed, as they often are, out of the bearers' hands, 
and the candidate, with his limbs sprawling and coat 
flying, gives somewhat of the idea of a frog or a 
kitten thrown from one unlucky boy to another, I 
have been reminded of what Sir Thomas Brown 
says on another occasion ; " There is nothing that 
will more deject a man's cooled imagination, when 
he shall consider what an odd and unworthy piece 
of folly he hath committed." But it seems your 
triumphant progress was majestic and graceful in 
the highest degree, — at least so I hear from an eye- 
witness.
Among all my selfish joys on this occasion, one, 
not the least, is the hope of meeting you, and per- 
haps Mrs. Roscoe, &c.
in London in the spring.
Forgive me for intruding so long on your time, but 
really I want to say much more.
This free postage 
will cost you many a minute ; but your friends 
must learn discretion by degrees.
All who know you here join in most heartfelt 
congratulations.
Present them for us to Mrs. Ros- 
337 
roe and all your family : and believe me ever, my 
dear Sir, 
Your affectionate and devoted Friend, 
J. E.
Smith.
Mr. Roscoe to Sir J.
E. Smith.
My dear Friend, Allerton, June 25, 1807.
I have for some time past rejoiced in the thought 
that I am likely to see you in Lancashire in the 
course of the present summer.
I already anticipate 
the happiness I shall have in your society at Aller- 
ton, where I must at least claim some portion of 
your time, and where I shall be delighted to stroll 
and saunter with you through the fields in an even- 
ing, instead of being locked up balloting for com- 
mittees in St. Stephen's.
In truth, my dear friend, 
it requires but little of the efforts of others to drive 
me from public life.
The only wonder is, that I 
was ever brought into it; and I sink back with such 
a rapidity of gravitation into my natural inclination 
for quiet and retirement, that I totally despair of 
ever being roused again to a similar exertion.
Add 
to this, that the one great object which was con- 
tinually before my eyes is now attained, and I shall 
have the perpetual gratification of thinking that I 
gave my vote in the assembly of the nation for 
abolishing the slave-trade to Africa.
Though not 
insensible to the state of the country, yet I see no 
question of equal magnitude ; and am fully aware 
how little my efforts could avail in the political 
VOL.
II.
z 
338 
struggles of the times.
Come then, my friend, and 
let us again open the book of Nature, and wander 
through the fields of Science.
Your presence will 
increase my reviving relish for botanical pursuits ; 
and when we are tired with those subjects, we will 
call in the aid of the poets and philosophers to vary 
our entertainment.
Pray have you seen Mr. Wordsworth's new poems ?
"Whatever things are whimsical, whatever things 
are childish, whatever things are odd, — these, and 
many other things, are to be found in these vo- 
lumes : but after all I like them, and listen to him 
with a pleasure something like that of an infant to 
the prattle of an old nurse.
They are to be read 
in listlessness and leisure, like that in which they 
seem to have been written ; and if you can bring 
your mind to the proper tone, depend upon it you 
will not find an hour or two misemployed in their 
perusal.
Let me have the pleasure of hearing from you as 
soon as possible, and believe me ever most truly 
and affectionately 
Yours, 
W. Roscoe.
Sir J.
E. Smith to Mr. Roscoe.
My dear Friend, Norwich, July 4, 1807.
After all the agitation and anxiety of mind which 
I have felt for some weeks past on your account, 
how delightful is it to find, by your most welcome 
339 
and interesting letter of the 25th of June, that you 
still possess yourself in undisturbed tranquillity ; 
not like a reed that has bent before the storm, but 
like a palm-tree, around whose polished and up- 
right stem the winds have whistled, without ruf- 
fling the lofty honours of its head !
Such a plant 
can no more be nursed in St. Stephen's chapel, 
than the Norfolk Island pine, 250 feet high, in 
any of our stoves.
You are now in your proper 
element, and very long may you continue so !
The 
world is not worthy of you, " nor the world's law." 
The line of conduct you have pursued secures you 
from regret, and I trust you will soon look back 
on all that is past with no less satisfaction, on every 
account, than self-approbation.
I wished it rather 
for your triumph than your happiness ; and really 
triumphs of any kind are worth but little : — " One 
self-approving hour," &c.
— you know the rest, 
and that a good man has, independent of tri- 
umphs founded on the accidental justice of the 
world.
Believe me ever, my dear Sir, 
Most affectionately, 
Your faithful Friend and Servant, 
J. E.
Smith.
Sir J.
E. Smith to Mr. Roscoe.
My dear Friend, Norwich, Nov. 2, 1807.
What a long while I have been without acknow- 
ledging your kind and very interesting letter of 
z 2 
340 
invitation !
I want to talk to you about many 
tilings.
Imprimis, I want to know your Canna, ; 
for I wish to write a paper on the species of Sci- 
ta?nine<p, following you as your humble squire, 
" haud passibus acquis ; " and it is highly desirable 
I should not be distanced out of sight of my leader 
at the very first steps of my course.
If you cannot 
help me to specimens, figures, or synonyms of your 
species of Cannes made out of C.
indica, I must 
leave that section, and write only on true Scitami- 
necB, which I should not much regret, as I have 
some difficult new plants of the Canna section.
I this day sent a botanico-physiologieal paper to 
the Linnsean Society, on the germination of seeds, 
disproving the vilellus of Gsertner, which seems to 
me only a subterraneous cotyledon, and correcting 
many things respecting monocotyledonous plants, 
so called, as the quakers say.
I like it better than 
many things I have done ; but whether the half- 
dozen people who can judge of it will like it as 
well, may be doubtful.
Do you agree with my rule 
about shall and ivill in the Atheneeum for Octo- 
ber* ?
I hope very soon to send you my Introduction to 
Botany, on which I shall most earnestly request 
* In reply to the inquiry in this letter concerning the use of 
shall and will, Mr. Roscoe tells Sir James that he has read with 
great pleasure his grammatical paper, and is much inclined to 
agree with him.
" Of this," he says, "I am sure that it has thrown 
more light on the subject than anything I have before met with ; 
and till a greater prophet arises, you may reckon on me as one 
of your disciples." 
34,1 
your friendly opinion, corrections, and advice.
Many 
parts of it are but sketches, and many perhaps 
wrong ; but I hope it will promote the study.
Some 
parts are new and original.
I am about the Pro- 
dromus Flora Grcecce.
You would hardly think that 
I can scarcely do more than ten or twelve species in 
that work in a whole morning from ten o'clock till 
three.
I heard a curious anecdote today from indubi- 
table authority.
At the conference at Tilsit, the 
King of Prussia, who, it seems, is a beau, had a pair 
of long pantaloons.
Buonaparte said, " If your 
majesty puts on those yourself, it must be very 
troublesome.
Pray do you begin buttoning them 
at the top or bottom?" He told the Queen, " he 
was too old to be influenced by her beaux yeux ; " 
which, it seems, the Emperor of Russia docs not 
find so innocent.
Adieu, my dear Sir.
Believe me ever your affectionate 
J. E.
Smith.

Smith to Mr. Roscoe.
Hall Place, near Maidenhead, June 12, 1810.
My dear Friend, 
Tired with the bustle of town, — suffocated and 
sleepless with the smoke and east wind, — I am come 
here for a few days to breathe and sleep, and to 
enjoy the society of some valuable old friends in 
their antique spacious mansion, amid vast avenues 
of limes, beech woods, abounding with rare Or- 
chidea, and a most beautiful surrounding country.
How can I bestow some of my leisure better than 
in chatting with you, in reply to your kind letter of 
the 21st of April?
I wish you could know Sir 
William* and Lady East, with whom I now am.
I 
think we have mentioned them to you before ; at 
least we have made them well acquainted with you 
by report.
I am going with Lady East in search 
of Monotropa Hypopitys, which I never yet saw 
growing, but which I hear grows in the woods at 
Bisham Abbey hard by, where the unfortunate Plan- 
tagenets lie buried.
Among them are the famous 
Earl of Warwick, the king-maker, and the last Earl, 
who died young in the Tower.
There are no mo- 
numents of them.
The Abbey is now a house, in- 
habited by Mr. Yansittart, whose charming daughter 
married Mr. Augustus East, a son of my friend's.
They are now here, and we all botanize together in 
the fields or gardens.
I rejoice to hear of your intended botanical paper, 
which I presume relates to natural systems, and to 
Jussieu's especially.
You threw out some excellent 
hints once, which I have often regretted I did not 
put down at the time.
I am very anxious you 
should pursue the subject : you will no doubt treat 
Jussieu with the candour and respect he so highly 
deserves.
I had a letter from him lately, and an- 
swered it.
He is a very worthy, amiable character, 
and I would not hurt him, though he in conversa- 
* A letter from this estimable friend is inserted page 108.
343 
tion calls the Linnaean system lese nature.
I hope 
you agree with me as to the name of Linnaeus, — see 
two or three last Monthly Magazines*.
Jussieu in 
his French letter writes Linnceus ; so do all the 
French now.
Believe me, with best respects to Mrs. Roscoe 
and all your family, very affectionately yours, 
J. E.
Smith.
Mr. Roscoe to Sir J.
E. Smith.
My dear Friend, Allerton, Jan. 2, 181 1.
I have been so long without hearing from you, 
that I have at length brought down my obstinate 
hand to the paper, from an irresistible desire of 
knowing how you are, what you are doing, and 
when I may hope for the pleasure of seeing you 
once more in this part of England.
For my own 
part, I have been kept in the house nearly three 
weeks by indisposition, from which I am now pretty 
well recovered.
This twilight of convalescence is 
an excellent season for turning one's mind to fa- 
vourite studies and amusements ; and when these 
happen to be intermixed with sentiments of affec- 
tion and friendship, they afford a better restorative 
than most that the pharmacopoeia can supply.
Since 
I last wrote to you (I believe) we have made a pur- 
chase of the late Col. Velley's most beautiful col- 
lection of plants, including not only his marine 
specimens, but many others, all of which are pre- 
* For the letter here mentioned see Appendix.
344 
served in the most exquisite and perfect manner.
I mention this, that it may be an additional induce- 
ment to you to hasten your visit, though I fear that 
if the living claims we have upon you be insufficient, 
we shall have little chance from any inanimate at- 
tractions.
Be so good as to tell me whether you have yet 
fired off my Congreve rocket against the French 
botanists.
I hope not, as I think I could put some 
more combustibles into it.
In particular, I think 
the distinction between a natural and an artificial 
system might be more fully explained.
In other 
respects I have no objection to give them a broad- 
side, and wish you could prevail upon both nations 
to confine their animosities within such harmless 
limits ; but the business of cutting throats must go 
on, and seems even to be considered not as an ac- 
cidental, but as a permanent state of society.
I presume you have seen the fine numbers of the 
Flore Portugaise of Count Hoffman segg, in which 
I find honourable mention of you, and your works 
generally quoted.
The Count's system affords an- 
other instance of the necessity of adhering to some 
established plan of arrangement, otherwise it will 
soon be impossible for those who cultivate the sci- 
ence to understand each other.
His system is 
founded on that of Jussieu, but with such altera- 
tions as render it even worse for common use, or 
rather wholly impracticable, the primary distinctions 
being founded on the tissu cellulaire of the plant.
Such of them as are formed upon the plan he ap- 
proves of, he calls perfect plants ; and such as have 
345 
their cellular membranes different or indistinct, he 
calls imperfect plants ; and his perfect plants are 
again subdivided by their cotyledons, but somewhat 
different from Jussieu, as he calls the dicotyledonous 
plants of Jussieu plantes cotyledond>es ; and the mo- 
nocotyledonous, plantes acotyledonees.
This is al- 
together so new, and so microscopic, and so difficult, 
that I doubt not but it will be very generally adopted, 
and that instead of quoting Linn, or Juss.
we shall 
shortly cite Hoffm., unless some great reformer 
should start up and put him out of fashion.
I have not been idle of late, having been employed 
in devising a mode of putting an effectual end to the 
African slave trade, as at present 
" We have scotch'd the snake, not kill'd it." 
I am also looking into the state of the arts during 
the middle ages, for a memoir of which I have good 
materials.

My dear Friend, Norwich, Sept.
7, 1812.
Be not alarmed at seeing a letter from me so 
soon after my last.
We have been spending ten 
days at Holkham, and I write now at the earnest 
desire of Mr. Coke, to try to persuade you to come 
and see him and us.
He says you have given him 
some hopes, but have as yet only disappointed him.
Now I can conceive nothing more delightful than 
346 
spending a fortnight with you under his roof, and 
have promised him to do so whenever you come.
To contemplate his pictures and statues, to rum- 
mage among his books, drawings, manuscripts, and 
prints, (where we every day find treasures unknown 
before,) is extremely agreeable, and he kindly en- 
trusts all his keys to me in full confidence.
I found 
a case of the earliest printed books, which no one 
had examined since the time of his great-uncle Lord 
Leicester.
Such MSS.
of Dante, drawings of the 
old Italian masters, treasures of European history, 
— you have no idea!
The house is one of the finest 
in Europe, and its riches are inexhaustible.
But 
of all things its owner is the best worth your seeing 
and knowing.
He is so amiable, with all the first 
gloss of human affection and feeling; upon his heart; 
so devoid of all selfishness that, with the early and 
constant prosperity he has experienced, his cha- 
racter is next to a miracle ; and he has such an 
agreeable liveliness and playfulness of manners, that 
nobody is more entertaining.
You would exactly 
suit in all your ideas of men and things.
Do give 
me some hopes that you will come over this autumn 
with Mrs. Roscoe or some of your family.
We 
will meet at Holkham; and if you can descend 
(without breaking your neck) to our " low estate," 
we will strive to rival even Holkham in the hearti- 
ness of our welcome.
I shall show you the Lin- 
naean reliques, and we shall consult you about a 
new botanic garden now projecting.
Do, my dear 
friend, think of all this ;— but do not let it be in 
347 
frost and snow.
I was laid up there last December 
by a cold caught in going.
Ever most affectionately yours, 
J. E.
Smith.
Mr. Roscoe to Sir J.
E. Smith.
My dear Friend, Allerton, Sept.
13, 18 12.
I ordered a Liverpool Mercury to be sent you 
yesterday, by which you will see we have been 
giving a splendid dinner to Mr. Brougham, at which 
several of your friends took an active part.
The 
lords present all spoke with great spirit, and the 
reading of the letters from the principal members 
of both houses went off extremely well.
On the 
whole this meeting will do some good, and tend to 
draw closer that connexion between the commercial 
and manufacturing interests and the nobility and 
great proprietors of land, which is become essential 
not only to the prosperity, but the safety of the 
country.
And now, my dear friend, for your last letter.
" So cunning was the apparatus, 
The powerful pothooks did so move him, 
That, will he, nill he, to the great house 
He went as if the devil drove him." 
It would not, however, be so much for the sake of 
the great house, nor for all it contains, though no- 
thing in its way could be more attractive, that I 
should wish to visit Holkham.
It would be with 
the view of paying my respects to its excellent and 
348 
distinguished owner, and of meeting you under his 
roof, — temptations which I feel I shall hardly be 
able to resist.
At present, however, I cannot speak 
very decisively.
Neither my wife nor myself are at 
present very well ; and when I shall be able to ven- 
ture abroad so far before winter I really dare not 
say.
Mrs. R.
and I ought to have gone to Hafod 
this year ; but the same causes rendered it impos- 
sible.
In the mean time be assured, my dear friend, 
that nothing upon earth could afford me a greater 
treat, and I shall consider it as a misfortune if I 
should not be able to meet you.
Your ever affectionate Friend, 
W. Roscoe.

Norwich, Oct. 26, 1812.
Ah !
my dear friend, the vision which I ventured 
to contemplate was too bright to be realized !
Yet 
vour letter almost tempts me to hope, 
" Though hope were lost," 
As to this disappointment, you may well bear it, 
because you know not what it is.
'Tis not the 
enjoyments of taste, literature, luxury, and novelty 
that I lament, — it is the losing the pleasure of see- 
ing you beloved by so excellent a creature, so con- 
genial to you.
You would each find a mine of hap- 
piness of which you know scarcely anything.
Mr.
Coke is out of the sight and conception of the 
world in general ; and I can £>ive vou no higher 
349 
proof of my esteem and affection for yourself than 
by speaking of him to you without reserve.
— How 
well did he express his own character the other day 
when he said he " dreaded nothing so much as 
self.
Self is the worst tyrant in the world." Mr.
Coke is, I think, one of the most gracefully kind 
and benevolent men, to all in their proper places, 
that I ever saw.
As to politics, mankind, farming, pictures, you 
and he would never fail of conversation ; but these 
are smaller matters.
My friend Mr. Fountaine of Narford, (another 
fine house,) has numerous Italian manuscripts, 
copied at Florence for his ancestor Sir Andrew 
Fountaine, by permission of Cosmo III.
These he 
offers to your entire " use and behoof." We are 
also to look over his Raphael ware, the finest except 
at Loretto.
See my Tour, — Loretto.
You see hope will revive in my breast ; — do not 
blast it again.
Oar Bishop you must come and 
admire : I fear he goes to town before the spring : 
he is here notv, alas !
You will smile at this letter, 
and some would think me stark mad; — if so, God 
grant I may never be cured !
Let me hear from 
you.
I have fifty things more to say ; but for the 
present, Adieu.
Yours ever and ever, 
J. E.
Smith.

E. Smith.
Allerton, February 27, 1813.
My ever dear Friend, 
tF tp * IF -fr •«• * 
I have lately done something towards a catalogue 
of my pictures, drawings, prints, &c., which are be- 
come much more numerous since you saw them, 
and which I promise myself great pleasure in sub- 
mitting at no distant period to your examination 
and criticism.
Amongst the pictures is the portrait 
of Leo X.
with the Cardinals de Rossi and Giulio di 
Medici, which I have been assured by many per- 
sons is the celebrated copy of Andrea del Sarto 
which was sent as the original of Raffaelle to the 
Duke of Mantua.
From Mantua it went to Parma, 
and was thence transferred with the rest of the col- 
lection to Capo di Monte near Naples *.
You may 
probably have seen it there in the year 1787?
al- 
though you do not mention it in your Travels ; and 
when you see it again, will perhaps be able to clear 
up my conjectures.
That the picture was carried off 
from Capo di Monte several years since is certain; 
and as I can hear no account of it from any quarter, 
and have been told by several persons that mine 
appears to be in every respect a perfect resemblance 
of the picture of Raffaelle now in the Louvre, I flatter 
myself with the probability of its being the copy of 
Andrea, at the sight of which Giulio Romano was 
* This picture was purchased by Mr. Coke, and is now at 
Holkham.
351 
deceived ; and on being assured it was a copy, de- 
clared that he did not value it less than the work of 
Raffaelle himself.
Throughout the whole of my troublesome com- 
plaint I have had many sleepless hours by night, in 
some of which I strung verses together, which I 
wrote down in the morning, — of these I send a spe- 
cimen, which I beg you to present to Mrs. Smith, 
with my kind remembrances : — should she approve 
of them, she will perhaps do me the favour of send- 
ing a copy to Miss Coke.
I long to hear from you 
again, and am at all times, my dear Friend, most af- 
fectionately yours, 
W. Roscoe.
SONG 
On the Ball given by the Friends of Mr. Brougham and Mr.
Creevey.
Liverpool, November 1812.
The fair face of morning when sudden clouds cover, 
And tempests and darkness envelope the day, 
Shall the gloom of the moment deter the true lover 
Who hastes to the home of his mistress away ?
When heaved from its base proudly swells the vext ocean, 
And danger rides high on the crest of the wave, 
Undaunted the mariner views the commotion, 
And bares his bold bosom the sea-storm to brave.
Then say, shall the Patriot e'er prove a recoiler ?
Shall the champion of freedom e'er stoop to despair ?
Shall he basely resign to the hands of the spoiler 
The prize that high Heaven has consign'd to his care ?
No !
still to his task with fresh vigour returning, 
He shall wage the bold war with corruption again, 
As the lion, that, roused by the beam of the morning, 
Shakes off the slight dew-drops that hang on his mane.
352 
If he falls — like the warrior he falls on his duty, 
Whilst his country shall hail him and angels approve; 
If he conquers — he wins from the bright hand of beauty 
The wreath wove by Liberty, Friendship, and Love.
Sir J.
E. Smith to Mr. Roscoe.
My dear Friend, Norwich, March 21, 1813.
I heartily wish I could see your pictures or any 
thing that belongs to you ; but this year you must 
be Mahomet, and / the mountain, — another year 
we will try to reverse the matter.
I have no recol- 
lection of the picture you mention at Capo di 
Monte : that collection was in such dirt and confu- 
sion (all on the floor) that we saw it to disadvantage.
Pray is the white speck (indicating light) on the 
pupil of the eyes ?
Andrea del Sarto I think never 
put it; — but he might, perhaps, hi copying.
Lady 
Rockingham had a fine Cornelius Jansen without 
that speck.
Is it usually omitted by him ?
My wife answers for Miss Coke, and sends you 
in return what, I think, is not unworthy even of your 
verses; because, like them, it is an effusion of a 
good heart.
I subjoin an epigram on Holkham, 
which was sure of pleasing my fair young friend, 
who is worthy of her father, — I need say no more 
for her.
Leicester, high priest of fortune and of taste, 
Raised fairy scenes amid the desert waste : — 
Holkham's chief grace owns not his magic rod ; 
" An honest man's the noblest work of God."

Sir J.
E. Smith to Mr. Roscoe.
My dear Friend, Norwich, October 3, 1814.
I had intended writing to you a few days since, 
but many things have prevented me.
I hope I am 
still time enough for the main purpose of my letter, 
which is to make another attempt, at the desire of 
Mr. Coke, to induce you to visit Holkham.
We 
have spent a delightful fortnight there lately, and 
two hours almost every day were devoted to an 
examination of the manuscripts.
I am going there 
on Monday with our good Bishop, for a few days, 
for the express purpose of looking further into 
these treasures, and if you could join us, you would 
complete the joy of the whole party.
I must tell you a part of our discoveries : — besides 
beautifully illuminated MSS.
on vellum, of many of 
the Latin classics ; a most exquisite Boccaccio ; a 
very old and fine Dante ; a Chronique d'Henault, in 
two immense folios, richly illuminated ; and other 
things of that kind ; — there is a very valuable col- 
lection of historical Italian MSS., fairly copied at 
Florence, Venice, &c, for Lord Leicester ; they are 
partial or local chronicles, memoirs, Scc.,ve?y curious.
Among others is a complete copy of Burchard's 
Diary.
This delectable treasure will surely tempt 
you of itself.
I think you knew nothing of it but 
what Gordon has printed : — am I right in this ?
There is one original monastic chronicle, itself of 
the date of 1300 or 1400.
There are also many 
things which we want you to tell us the value of.
VOL.

The printed books are inestimable in value and 
number.
How many things have I to talk over with you, 
and not a few to show you, before we go to Holk- 
ham!
You must contrive not to limit your time ; 
you have found it difficult to get to that charming 
place, but you have no idea how difficult it is to get 
away.
Yours, &c, 
J. E.
Smith.
Soon after this letter was written, Mr. Roscoe 
paid his first visit to Norfolk, as will appear by the 
succeeding letters from Mr. Coke and the Bishop 
of Norwich, to whom Sir James had the satisfac- 
tion of introducing his friend.
Mr. Coke to Sir J.
E. Smith.
My dear Sir, Holkham, December 15, 1814.
I cannot forward the inclosed, which reached 
me by yesterday's post, without acknowledging all 
your friendly assistance, and expressing the great 
pleasure afforded me by your own and Mr. Ros- 
coe's visit.
The more I saw of him, the more I was de- 
lighted with the benevolence of his mind, the rec- 
titude and liberality of his principles, as well as with 
his superior acquirements.
Believe me, with our united kind regards to Lady 
Smith, ever, my dear Sir, very faithfully 
Yours, 
Thos.
Wai. Coke.
355 
The Bishop of Norwich to Sir J.
E. Smith.
My dear Sir James, 
I feel, if possible, more proud of being indebted to 
your friendly partiality for the favourable opinion 
whieh Mr. Roscoe is so good as to entertain of me, 
than I do even of his approbation ; and yet the es- 
teem of such a man is a source of higher gratifica- 
tion than any which it is in the power of kings or 
ministers to bestow.
Many thanks for your kind 
invitation.
To wait upon you, and to meet Mr.
Roscoe, are certainly very great temptations ; for 
men like him are rare beings — 
" Numero vix sunt totidem quot 
Thebarum portoe vel divitis ostia Nili." 
Old as I am, I cannot therefore but feel anxious to 
say, before I die, " Virgilium vidi." Adieu !
Yours sincerely and affectionately, 
H. Norwich.
Mr. Coke to Sir J.
E. Smith.
My dear Sir James, Holkham, Feb. 9, 1815.
Leo X., most magnificently bound, made his ap- 
pearance yesterday, and will be more highly prized 
than any manuscript in my possession.
To you, I 
may fairly say, I am more particularly indebted for 
this most inestimable gift ; I should probably never 
have known Mr. Roscoe, if it had not been for your 
kindness in bringing us together ; it has established 
a mutual regard between us, which I am satisfied 
2a2 
356 
will be pleasing to us both during the remainder 
of our respective lives.
To say the truth, he i9 a 
most extraordinary personage ; — such a head, such 
a heart, such suavity of disposition, such courage in 
the pursuit of what is right, such pure philanthropy, 
are seldom combined in one individual ; — imagine 
then, my dear Sir, the store I shall set by the pre- 
sent of his book.
How preferable such a testimony 
of esteem from such a man, to the baubles which 
may be derived to a cringeing sycophant from a pro- 
fligate court !
If I live and have my health, I will 
do myself the pleasure of passing a few days with 
him at Allerton in September or October next.
Could you not accompany me ?
I will not keep you 
from home more than five or six weeks.
You will be pleased to hear that I have consigned 
to Roscoe's care four dozen of my MSS.
to be 
bound.
Eliza and the ladies unite with me in kind re- 
gards to yourself and Lady Smith ; and believe me, 
my dear Sir, with great esteem, 
Yours most sincerely, 
Thos.
Wm. Coke.
From the same.
My dear Sir, Holkham, August 8, 1815.
You must be here one whole day at least, before 
our departure, to look over the manuscripts our 
friend Roscoe has had bound, and his remarks, 
which are very interesting.
I need not say with 
357 
what delight I look forward, in having so cheerful 
a companion and inestimable a friend to accom- 
pany me in my travels, for they will be nothing 
short of a moderate tour upon the Continent.
Remember me in the kindest manner to Lady 
Smith ; and, with great regard and esteem, 
I remain yours most faithfully, 
Thos.
Wm. Coke.
From the same.
Dear Sir, Holkham, Jan. 17, 1816.
I have within these few days received a most de- 
lightful and gratifying letter from our worthy friend, 
who writes as under, after having mentioned his 
having sent a large parcel of MSS.
" In particular 
I must beg your attention to a most beautiful ma- 
nuscript of Caesar's Commentaries, and a small 
thick volume lettered Prcesesjid., — two of ihejinest 
I ever saw.
The Livy, in the chest just mentioned, 
is beyond all estimation, being, as I can clearly de- 
monstrate, the individual book sent by Cosmo de 
Medici to Alfonso king of Naples, as a peace of- 
fering on the termination of hostilities between 
them,'' and which is mentioned in his Life of Lo- 
renzo de' Medici.
" That I should have had " (he 
says,) " the good fortune of seeing and turning over 
at my leisure such a book, is almost incredible." 
He mentions Mr. Jones having got into a regular 
system, — three binders besides himself constantly 
employed ; so that you see, my good friend, your 
358 
hint was not thrown away ; and the satisfaction 
which Mr. Roscoc over and over again assures 
me he takes in looking over and arranging these 
various MSS., and in noting the collection, removes 
from my mind the great trouble I was once fearful 
I had imposed upon him.
— He has sat for his por- 
trait to Shee, and I am told it is very like *.
I have been blessed with all my grandchildren 
and three daughters for some time, who are all well, 
and unite in kind regards with, dear Sir, 
Yours, 
Thos.
Wm. Coke.
From the same.
My dear Sir, Holkham, Oct. 5, 1816.
I know you will feel interested to hear of my 
purchases at Mr. Roscoe's sale of pictures, which I 
rejoice to tell you went off at much higher prices 
than had been expected.
I have the Leo, the Head 
of Christ, the chiaroscuro by Michael Angelo ; 
the portrait of a Venetian Lady and her Son by 
Giorgione, and a Holy Family by Vinci ; which 
were all favourites of our inestimable friend's, and 
he expresses much satisfaction in the thoughts of 
seeing them here.
I shall have the pleasure of seeing you and Lady 
Smith at the sessions.
With our united kindest re- 
gards to both, I remain, my dear Sir, 
Ever most faithfully, 
Thos.
Wm. Coke.

Mr. Hoscoe to Sir J.
E. Smith.
My dear Friend, June 10, 1817.
I have now to speak to you on a subject which 
I flatter myself may eventually lead to my enjoying 
somewhat more of your society than I had promised 
myself.
We are establishing an institution here 
for education and lectures on a large scale, em- 
bracing the whole circle of literature, science, and 
the arts.
Our proposed capital is 30,000/., towards 
which upwards of 22,000/.
is already subscribed.
We have prepared a capital building, with lecture- 
rooms, school-rooms, exhibition-rooms, &c, upon 
a commodious and extensive scale ; the whole of 
which are now ready for use.
I have promised 
to give an introductory lecture, which I believe 
will be followed by a regular course by Dr. Traill, 
our very worthy and scientific townsman, and Dr.
Vose, an excellent physiologist.
But our committee 
are desirous, in publishing their first report, to be 
able to state to the proprietors the names of such 
celebrated scientific characters in other parts of the 
kingdom, as they think may be induced to favour 
them with their assistance ; and it is with great 
pleasure I have undertaken to solicit you on the 
occasion.
Our buildings have cost 10,000/.
I trust you will allow us to say in our report that 
we have hopes of your assistance.
You will receive another letter from this post, so 
360 
that you will have a double assurance that I am, 
my dear Friend, ever truly yours, 
W. Roscoe.
Sir «/.
E. Smith to Mr, Roscoe.
My dear Friend, Norwich, Sept.
28, 1818.
I have not much to say, except to express the 
pleasure I have had so lately in your society, and 
my happiness at seeing you so well.
On Sunday 
the treacherous weather just permitted me to climb 
from Matlock to the high rocks on Cromford Moor, 
often celebrated in English Botany : I had not 
been up to them since 1792.
I was quite enchanted 
with the wide extended view ; and the balmy air 
among heath, bilberries, ferns, mosses, &c.
seemed 
" Redolent of joy and youth, 
To breathe a second spring." 
I met with all my old friends among the Lichens, 
&c.
; but the long dry summer seems to have kept 
back their fructification.
I have written to Mr. Coke about your intended 
visit.
The worthy Bishop of Winchester writes that he 
is " exceedingly delighted " with my Cambridge 
pamphlet.
'Tis curious that four Oxford bishops 
should decidedly approve of my pretensions.
I have just got a work of Sprengel's on Umhelli- 
fera, — which I think he has reformed almost as 
successfully as you have the Scitaminea.
In it I am 
called — >" fieya Kvdoc, fipiTavvojv" — (j)ev aiSooc, !

Sir J.
E. Smith to Mr. Roscoe.
Norwich, March 27, 1820.
My dear and very kind Friend, 
I blame myself for not having sooner replied to 
your welcome and consolatory letter, received above 
a month since.
I am truly thankful on my dear mother's account 
that she " fell asleep " so happily, as really never 
to have known what death was, — nor did she ever 
know the fear of it : her religion was of the most 
cheerful kind, — no gloom, no uncharitableness 
had any share in it.
She was quite prepared, and 
had talked to me about every thing connected with 
her departure, long ago.
I had been in the habit 
of almost daily calls, to chat a minute or two with 
her, and I miss her with a degree of sadness I did 
not expect.
I vainly thought I had fortified my- 
self beforehand : my only resource is the reflexion 
that I have nothing to regret for her sake, and I 
am thankful she did not survive me, which her 
unimpaired health and the probability of her living 
as long as anybody ever does, made me often dread 
for her.
She also sometimes dreaded it, — not from 
any alarms about my health, but because of her 
own probable long life.
March 28.
— I have just learnt by a letter from 
my wife, who is at LowestofFt, that her excellent 
mother is no more ; — such are the ravages of such 
a severe winter !
I would add a word of literature.
I send today 
362 
a great budget of Linnaean correspondence to 
" Master John Nichols " to print, — very curious 
and interesting.
Have you seen the letters he has 
printed of Dr. Richardson, Sloane, Lord Petre, and 
the great Sherard ?
The originals are now in my 
hands, with many others ; — a mine of botanical 
anecdote.
Your ever affectionate 
J. E.
Smith.
Mr. Roscoe to Sir J.
E. Smith.
My ever dear Friend, April 15, 1820.
I need not say how truly I sympathize with Lady 
Smith and yourself in the grief and anxiety you 
have lately had to sustain, from the loss of your 
very near and dear relatives.
The crown of a happy life is a peaceful death ; 
and if we could take our departure with the com- 
posure of your late excellent mother, it would seem 
almost desirable for us to escape from this " sea of 
troubles." But though we may have sufficient 
causes to induce us to wish to lay down our bur- 
then, yet something still occurs to provide us either 
with a reason or a pretext for wishing to remain 
a little longer ; and I fear, if put to the test, we 
should be like our poor friend Fraser, who, after 
having been seventeen times across the Atlantic, 
and brought more plants into this kingdom than 
any other person, complained to my son, when he 
called on him in his last illness, that " Providence 
363 
had cut him oft* in the midst of his labours." Yet 
as such things will occur, I see with pleasure you 
still continue to add to the great mass of know- 
ledge and information on scientific, and particu- 
larly on botanical subjects, for which the world is 
already so highly indebted to you ; and that not 
merely by your own valuable labours, but by giving 
to the public the productions of your eminent pre- 
decessors, and rendering them immortal in the 
offspring of their own mind.
Almost the only relaxation which I have for 
some time past been enabled to take, has been in 
extending and examining my collection of Scita- 
minea, which are now so numerous as to form an 
important class, capable of as correct an arrange- 
ment as any in the system.
In the course of this, 
I have diligently studied and copied your excellent 
remarks in Rees's new Cyclopaedia.
By the liberality of Dr. Carey of Serampore, and 
Dr. Wallich of Calcutta, we have for some time 
past been furnished with all the living plants of this 
tribe that India can afford ; many of them from the 
remotest parts of Napal, and a splendid collection 
of seeds chiefly from Napal and Subhatoo.
My present arrangement of Curcuma is the 
finest and most numerous of the whole order.
Of 
Hedychium I have 15 or 16 species ; 5 of Roscoea, 
&c, which wait for your sanction and name.
I beg my most affectionate respects and condo- 
lence to Lady Smith, and am, dear Sir James, 
Yours, 
W. Roscoe.
364 
From the same.
My dear Friend, Liverpool, July 14, 1821.
You will probably have seen by the public pa- 
pers that I have undertaken to give my assistance 
to Mr. Valpy, in publishing a collection of the 
Italian poets in 48 volumes ; in which it is intended 
that the works of each author should be intro- 
duced by biographical and critical dissertations, 
extracted from the best literary historians and 
critics of Italy, — a mode which I proposed.
You 
will perhaps be more surprised to hear that I have 
also acceded to a proposal made to me to write a 
new life of Pope, and publish a new edition of his 
works, — an undertaking of much more labour than 
the other, and at the present time, in which a sharp 
contest is carrying on both as to his moral and 
poetical character, attended with some peculiar dif- 
ficulties.
From a pretty close examination of the 
later editions of his works, I am not, however, 
greatly discouraged; nor can I help thinking that, 
however deficient I may be found in some respects, 
I shall be able to give an edition more just to the 
character of the author, and more accommodated to 
the use of the general reader, than any of those 
hat have been published since the time of War- 
burton.
When to these I add my additional volume to 
the Life of Lorenzo, you will have great reason to 
accuse me of presumption, and perhaps of folly : 
but I know not how it is, — I never can accomplish 
365 
any thing unless I have a great many other things 
that call for my attention at the same time, when I 
am as diligent in what I am about as obstinacy 
and perseverance can make me.
Whether this 
arises from an attachment one acquires for a par- 
ticular subject, or to a perversity of disposition that 
delights to be employed in any thing but what it 
ought to be, I shall not venture to determine.
With respect to our botanical concerns, the 
Hedychium excelsum has flowered with us this year 
in grand style ; and several others are going into 
flower, some of which we expect to be new.
We 
have also been greatly surprised by the appearance, 
a few days since, of a flower of a new and beautiful 
species of Hoscoea, from a plant sent us as a species 
of Orchis from Sillet ?
This plant is entirely dif- 
ferent as well from the purpurea as from the four 
others of which I have dried specimens.
I shall 
send you a slight figure of it, in order that you may 
add it to your list of species, and give it a specific 
appellation.
What do you think of either speciosa, 
ovlucida ?
The first it deserves, as being, I conceive, 
the largest and finest flower known of the genus ; 
but the second would perhaps be more appropriate, 
as alluding to the extreme delicacy and transpa- 
rency of the petals, which no drawing can express.
The whole flower is of a pale purple, changing in 
some parts to a clear watery white.
The flowers 
arise in succession as in Kcejnpferia, to which and 
to Hedychium it appears to have the nearest af- 
finity.
Since my return home I have been enabled to 
366 
make some important additions to the genus Carina, 
and have drawn up a synoptical table of twenty 
species, of which I printed a few copies for the 
correction of my friends, but which I am unwilling 
to part with till I know your opinion upon it.
The 
tables of Hedychium and Curcuma, which I have 
also nearly finished, will each of them amount to 
about the same number, and most of the plants are 
now growing with us.
Accept, my dear friend, my best thanks for the 
additional memorial of your friendship in the pre- 
sent of your two valuable volumes of the " Cor- 
respondence of Linnaeus and other Naturalists," a 
work highly worthy of you, and which will always 
be grateful to every true lover of science, and to 
every pious and candid mind.
Your anecdote of 
the identity of the peach and nectarine, reminds 
me of a circumstance equally extraordinary which 
has occurred to us here respecting Hedychium.
— 
Happening to meet a friend in the botanic garden, 
he informed me he had a plant in flower in his 
hot-house, about five miles from Liverpool, which 
he did not know, but which from his description I 
concluded must be a scitaminean.
With his per- 
mission, Henry Shepherd and I immediately went 
and brought it to Liverpool ; when it appeared to 
us all to be quite a new species, wholly different 
from any of those growing with us, and from my 
dried specimens from India.
The plant was not 
more than three feet high, — the flower a dull yel- 
low.
As it increased freely by the roots, the plant 
was afterwards divided, and several specimens were 
367 
distributed under the name of Hedychium flavum, 
when to our great astonishment in the following 
year it grew to twice its former height, and turned 
out to be no other than our old acquaintance H.
coronarium with a white flower at least three times 
the size it had before produced, — a result which I 
assure you will render me very diffident in future 
in deciding on the species of this beautiful genus.
And now, my dear friend, I think it is high time 
I should inquire after your health and present 
avocations ; and particularly how Lady Smith and 
yourself intend to dispose of your time during the 
ensuing summer (for in Lancashire it is not yet 
begun).
Adieu, my dear friend, and believe me, with the 
most affectionate respect and kindest remembrances 
to Lady Smith and yourself, 
Your ever faithful 
W. Roscoe.
Mr. Coke to Sir J.
E. Smith.
Holkham, August 10, 1825.
Shame would justly, my dear Sir, attend me, if I 
delayed answering your kind letter the first moment 
I could snatch from the whirl in which I have been 
writing.
Lady Anne accompanied me to Norwich assizes 
on Monday.
We took up our residence at the Pa- 
lace, where we were most hospitably and kindly in- 
vited; and I am sure it will give you and Lady Smith 
368 
pleasure to hear that I never saw the Bishop in bet- 
ter health or spirits, though I had been told he was 
not.
In our way back we stopped two nights with 
the Mr. Ansons, at Lyng.
I have now all hands at work with my harvest : 
within a fortnight or thereabouts I hope to be for- 
ward enough to enable me to leave home with a 
contented mind for Cannon Hall, having promised 
my dear Eliza that I would spend a fortnight with 
her this autumn.
It was our intention to have 
gone into Scotland, had we not been prevented by 
Lord Hastings, who is coining to us with all his 
family the very beginning of September.
Happy should I be if you and Lady Smith would 
give him the meeting, as Lady Loudon is very fond 
of botany, and Lady Anne having now a gardener 
to her liking.
I think you would be pleased with 
the improvements that have taken place since we 
had the pleasure of seeing you.
I will frank your 
letter to Roscoe, and accompany it with a line which 
will give both him and you much gratification, to 
hear that within this fortnight Blaikie has found 
in his office some highly valuable MSS.
of Lord 
Chief Justice Coke's.
When Chantrey has fixed 
his time of coming to Holkham, I will not fail to 
let you know.
Yours most faithfully, 
Thos.
Wm. Coke.

Sir J.
E. Smith to Mr. Roscoe.
Henbury Hill, near Bristol, August 6, 182 J.
Yes, my good friend, Henbury Hill, near Bristol !
The latter place I know you have heard of, for I 
find your name inscribed on the roll of a Society, 
to which mine has also been added ; but of the little 
village of Henbury, however worthy of celebration 
by your classical pen, you perchance may not have 
heard.
Perhaps, nevertheless, you may reply, 
" The place itself is neither new nor rare ; 
I wonder how the devil you came there : " — 
so I will proceed with my narrative.
I left my own 
home April 30th, and passed a fortnight with my 
worthy friend T.
Forster, at Walthamstow, and as 
much with his brother Edward at Hale End. I then 
passed two weeks in Chapel Place, near Cavendish 
Square.
Meanwhile I gave a course of ten bota- 
nical lectures at the London Institution, attended 
to much business of the Linnaean Society, visited 
several friends, and enjoyed myself sufficiently, " be- 
ing in sound health of mind and body." I passed 
a morning at Paddington with Mr. Coke, Lady 
Anne, and their two fine boys, — Dr. Davy of Caius 
accompanying me.
There could not be a more de- 
lightful sight.
I dined one day with our friend 
Lady Anson, — Mr. Coke, Mr. W.
Coke, and Lord 
Suffolk being of the party.
I never was better in 
my life than during this visit to London : but on 
coming to Bristol by a day coach, June 12th, in 
great heat, and after giving my first lecture next 
vol.
n. 2 b 
370 
day, my old inflammatory complaint, with an affec- 
tion of the lungs, attacked me ; and after giving 
three lectures I was obliged to resign myself to 
bleeding, James's powders, and starvation ; all which 
being vigorously used, under the inspection of my 
most excellent and skilful friend Mr. Estlin, I was 
enabled to finish my course.
We remained nearly 
a month at the Hotwells, enjoying the fine air and 
water, and amused by the numerous passing vessels, 
steam-boats, &c.
; the noble views of wood and 
river, accompanied by music on board the boats, 
and often in the woods, — all close to our windows.
Here I rapidly regained my health, sleep, and 
strength, insomuch that I took walks of three or 
four miles in the day.
Last Wednesday we removed to a very smart cot- 
tage, completely furnished, even with a library, in 
which, among other first-rate books of the present 
age, is the quarto edition of your Lorenzo.
This cottage was recommended to me by Mr.
and Mrs. Brooke, who inhabit a very pleasant house 
near it and Blaize Castle, and from whose garden 
and grounds, open to us, we enjoy delightful views 
of the Welsh Hills, the Severn, &c, and on all sides 
a most beautiful country.
Our cottage, with a field 
and garden, looks over a rich and beautifully wooded 
valley, extending to the Avon, on whose opposite 
bank Mr. Bright has a noble house and grounds.
In October we mean to prosecute our journey lei- 
surely homeward, visiting some friends in our way.
I am sorry to hear of your having suffered much 
by the rheumatism ; but hope the warm weather has 
3/1 
removed it.
To the excessive heat I perhaps owe 
ray illness.
Your ever affectionate Friend, 
J. E.
Smith.
Mr. Roscoe to Sir J.
E. Smith.
My dear Friend, Toxteth Park, Sept.
3, 1825.
Your most kind and welcome letter from Hen- 
bury Hill should have been sooner acknowledged, 
had not continual interruptions, combined with a 
state of unaccountable indolence and debility, pre- 
vented me from turning my thoughts to any subject 
but such as had irresistible claims upon me, and 
from which I extricated myself the first moment it 
was in my power.
If, in return for the narrative 
you have so kindly given me of your peregrinations 
and transactions since you left home, I should fur- 
nish you w T ith mine for the same period, they would 
appear like the track of a snail compared to the 
flight of an eagle, or the journal of a pedlar to the 
history of some mighty traveller.
You pass from 
county to county, visit your friends, and take up 
your abode where you please ; whilst I remain on 
the same spot, without emigrating even from the 
blue bed to the brown, and whenever I am disturbed 
only exclaim, 
" Let me, let me rest." 
The only object that excited my exertion was the 
publication of my Monandrian Plants.
I need not say there are many things in these on 
2 b 2 
372 
which I long for your opinion ; but I will not in- 
trude on you till you have seen and examined them, 
further than to say, that I am in hopes of clearing 
up the difficulties that have existed in ascertaining 
the precise limits of the genera Maranta, P/try- 
nium, and Thalia, and of settling some other im- 
portant points that have occurred in the course of 
the work, especially as to Costns, of which four 
fine species have flowered with us this summer, all 
of which will shortly appear in my work.
When shall we meet again ?
For my own part 
I can only repeat my own words, that 
" ....
Hope strives in vain through futurity's gloom 
To descry one hright moment in seasons to come." 
Yet I will not despair.
In the uncertainty that at- 
tends this earthly state, in which we cannot foresee 
the consequence of our placing one leg before 
another, I would gladly flatter myself that some- 
thing may occur to draw us together again, and 
enable us to enjoy each other's society — if not with 
all the life and vivacity, with all the warmth and af- 
fection we ever experienced; which good wish I 
hope Lady Smith will not refuse to share : at all 
events present to her my kindest remembrances, 
and believe me always, my dear Friend, most faith- 
fully yours, 
W. Roscoe.
373 
Mr. Roscoe to Sir J.
E. Smith.
My dear Friend, Toxteth Park, Dec. 14, 1826.
It was with great pleasure I received your letter 
giving me so satisfactory an account of your health 
and of the progress you are making in your great 
work, which will fill up a desideratum in the botany 
of this country that no other hand could have sup- 
plied.
I rejoice also in the disposition you feel for 
the continuation of your labours, it being a strong 
impression on my mind that nothing is more con- 
ducive to life and health than some employment 
that calls for our continued attention, and prevents 
a moment from being irksome on our hands.
For 
my own part, I feel as if my existence were twined 
round my employments, and when those have fi- 
nished I shall have finished too.
I thank you also, my dear friend, for your kind 
information respecting Amomum ; but since I last 
wrote to you I have had the good fortune to suc- 
ceed beyond my utmost expectations, in having bad 
specimens of one of the largest and finest of the 
tribe sent me fromDemerara, — the flowers preserved 
in spirits, and the fruit in an air-tight bottle.
This I conceive to be the true Malaguetta Pepper, 
or Grains of Paradise, respecting which I expect to 
know more when I can obtain a sight of your ar- 
ticle on Malaguetta in the Cyclopaedia.
The capsule somewhat resembles that of Gaertner, 
but is upwards of six inches in length, of a deep 
orange colour, covering a pulpy rind, inclosing the 
374 
receptacle of the seed, of the thickness of a man's 
finger, on which the seeds are beautifully arranged, 
and imbedded in a tomentose substance.
Frequently do I lament my distance from you ; 
and severely do I feel, on numerous occasions, the 
loss of your able and friendly advice.
I follow your example, " and comfort myself with 
the bright spots in my horizon." Above all, I delight 
to preserve and cultivate those feelings of friendship 
and affection which have been the charm and hap- 
piness of my life, and few of which have returned 
me so ample a harvest as those on which I am at 
present employed.
Adieu, my dear Friend !
I am most faithfully, 
W. Roscoe.

My dear Friend, Norwich, Jan. 8, 1827.
I have received lately your 9th and 10th num- 
bers, and need not tell you with what interest I have 
looked them over.
What a treasure is your plate 
and account of the original Thalia / 
Your intended Matonia is, I presume, distinct 
from Elettaria, which last name may as well remain, 
as the French school will doubtless retain it.
I 
should be highly gratified by the perusal of your 
manuscript materials.
Surely the true Malaguetta Pepper is from Africa, 
about Sierra Leone, and is the Grains of Paradise.
375 
See Amomum in Rees's Suppl.

My dear Friend, Norwich, Dec. 29, 1827.
Having a small corner in a frank allowed me, I 
cannot refrain from writing a word or two, though 
I have but little to say, but that I have done my 
fourth volume of English Flora, except printing the 
index, and am now getting on with Flora GrcBca, 
of which I hope to get towards the conclusion in 
the course of this winter ; so that, whatever happens 
to me, I shall have done my part of the work.
My eyes are much recovered, so that I find no 
impediment from them in bright weather : all pain 
and inflammation are gone.
I suffer from rheu- 
matism and great consequent weakness in my legs : 
my stomach, too, is dyspeptic ; but I totter on.
Our 
excellent friend at Holkham is counting upon our 
visiting him in the spring.
Whenever you can go, 
we will, if possible, meet you.
Yours, 
J. E.

My dear Sir Jame9, Holkham, Oct. 2, 1827.
I cannot think of sending you the inclosed letter 
without accompanying it with one line to say that 
our friend, in his letter to me, writes in excellent 
spirits, and holds out hopes of my seeing him in the 
spring.
Pray God his health may be sufficiently 
restored to enable him to do so, is my sincere 
wish.
With our tour into Scotland Lady Anne was de- 
lighted : but not being able to leave home so early 
by a fortnight as we had intended, owing to Lady 
de Clifford's kind and unexpected visit, we did not 
go beyond Blair Athol.
We visited all the principal 
manufactories in our way through England, — Man- 
chester, Bolton, &c.
&c.
In our way to Glasgow 
I saw the establishment at Lanark, and returned by 
Lord Rosebery's, which was by far the most pic- 
turesque and beautiful place we visited in Scotland ; 
and upon our return home had the happiness to find 
our children in perfect health.
The sporting season having now commenced, I 
have taken the liberty of sending you a little game.
Lady Anne unites with me in all kind remembrances 
to yourself and Lady Smith.
Ever, my dear Sir James, 
Faithfully yours,

CHAPTER XIV.
Of the religious, social, and scientific Character of Sir J.
E. Smith.
When the religious opinions and principles of a 
man have been such as to support him through the 
trials of life and in the hour of death, they form a 
part of his history deserving our notice : this me- 
moir therefore would be imperfect without giving 
such a statement of Sir James's as may be relied 
upon for containing the most essential points.
His principles were these, — "That a man can be no 
Christian, as to faith, who does not judge for him- 
self; nor as to practice, who does not allow others 
to do so without presuming to censure or to hinder 
them." 
His opinions were formed from the same source 
whence many, with equal sincerity, derive very dif- 
ferent ones.
His creed was the New Testament, and 
he read it as a celebrated divine* recommends; that 
is, " as a man would read a letter from a friend, in 
the which he doth only seek after what was his 
friend's mind and meaning, not what he can put 
upon his words." 
He was a firm believer in the divine mission of 
Jesus Christ; and in maintaining the doctrine of the 
strict unity of God, as one of the truths our great 
Master was commissioned to teach, he considered 
his opinion truly apostolical.
* Whichcot.
378 
" I look up," he says in a letter to a friend, " to 
one God, and delight in referring all my hopes and 
wishes to him ; I consider the doctrine and example 
of Christ as the greatest blessing God has given us, 
and that his character is the most perfect and lovely 
we ever knew, except that of God himself.
This is 
my religion ; I hope it is not unsound." * 
He considered opinions and principles very di- 
stinct, though often confounded.
The latter he 
looked upon as very important; the former no other- 
wise so, than as conducing to good principles, — and 
he esteemed one virtuous act, one honest determi- 
nation, to be more worthy in the sight of God than 
any notion or discovery concerning the essence of 
that Great Being who is raised far above all human 
comprehension.
The writer has often heard him observe, that what- 
ever in the sacred writings is not clear to the capa- 
city of the humblest, most unlettered rustic, cannot 
be essential to salvation ; and he was of the same 
opinion as our immortal Wickliffe, the morning- 
star of the Reformation, who contended " that wise 
men should leave that as unimportant which is not 
plainly expressed in Scripture." 
With regard to opinions, he also agreed with the 
amiable Lindsey, " that Christians have yet to learn 
the innocency of error, from which none can plead 
exemption, and to bear with each other in their dif- 
fering apprehensions concerning the nature of the 
First Great Cause and Father of all, and the person 
of Christ, and the manner and date of his deriving his 
* Letter to Davall, April 25, 1790.
379 
being and high perfections from God ; and surely 
it must also be owned to have been left in some ob- 
scurity by God himself in the writings of the Apo- 
stles, (otherwise so many men, wise and good, 
would not have differed, and still continue to differ 
concerning it,) and so left, it should seem, on pur- 
pose to whet human industry and the spirit of in- 
quiry in the things of God, and to give scope for the 
exercise of men's charity and mutual forbearance of 
one another, and to be one great means of cultiva- 
ting the moral dispositions, which is plainly the de- 
sign of the holy spirit of God in the Christian Re- 
velation, and not any high perfection in knowledge, 
which so few can attain." * 
Let it not be supposed that Sir James was indif- 
ferent to opinions, and considered all systems 
equally good ; on the contrary, he preserved his 
own through good report and evil report, and no 
temptation of interest ever made him swerve one 
moment from the maintenance and vindication of 
those he had adopted : but among these, the first 
was charity ; exclusiveness he considered as the 
very characteristic of Antichrist and pride.
There 
was no sect of Christians, among the good and sin- 
* "In matters of eternal concern," says the biographer of Sir 
William Jones, " the authority of the highest human opinions has 
no claim to be admitted as a ground of belief; but it may with 
the strictest propriety be opposed to that of men of inferior learn- 
ing and penetration : and whilst the pious derive satisfaction from 
the perusal of sentiments according with their own, those who 
doubt or disbelieve should be induced to weigh, with candour 
and impartiality, arguments which have produced conviction in 
♦^o minds of the best, the wisest, and most learned of mankind." 
380 
cere, with whom he could not worship the Great 
Spirit to whom all look up, enter into their views, 
excuse what he might consider as their prejudices, 
and respect their piety ; and whether it were in the 
pope's chapel, or the parish church, he felt the so- 
cial glow, 
" To gang together to the kirk, 
And all together pray; 
Where each to his great Father hends, 
Old men, and babes, and loving friends, 
And youths and maidens gay." 
The affection he thus felt for others, he in general 
had the happiness of finding reciprocal, " for love 
must owe its origin to love." No one had less of a 
sectarian spirit ; nor did he ever attempt to make 
converts, except to christian charity.
Where speaking, in his Tour, of some customs 
in the catholic church, " The stocks and stones," he 
observes, " which the people are taught to worship, 
are dressed out to their imagination with attributes 
of rectitude and benignity, borrowed from the pure 
idea of an intellectual Deity ; for so congenial are 
virtue and benevolence to the human mind, that no 
system of worship could support itself without their 
semblance ; and even those most corrupt in prin- 
ciple could have little success in practice, without 
a constant appeal to the eternal law written in our 
hearts : — as to forms, the mind will associate its 
conceptions with visible objects.
The devotion of 
some persons is best excited in a choir, of others in 
a conventicle, and of others in the holy house of 
Lorctto ; but f one is their Father, even God'." 
381 
He was adverse to such a view of the Supreme 
Being as is injurious to the perfect goodness of his 
character, which, because his power is unbounded, 
has supposed it might please him to exercise that 
power to the suhversion of his no less immutable 
attributes, justice and mercy.
Such ideas of our 
Creator appeared to him dishonourable to that pa- 
rental character which makes our adoration spring 
from the heart, and delight in obeying his com- 
mands : such a view of God is to invest him in the 
evil passions, the imperfection and weakness of 
humanity.
He believed that " in no being is the 
sense of right so strong, so omnipotent, as in God ; 
and that his almighty power is entirely submitted 
to his perception of rectitude.
He ascribed to him 
not only the name, but the disposition and princi- 
ples of a father ; that he has a father's concern for 
his creatures, a father's desire for their improve- 
ment, a father's equity in proportioning his com- 
mands to their powers, a father's joy in their pro- 
gress, a father's readiness to receive the penitent, 
and a father's justice for the incorrigible ; — that 
God's justice has for its end the highest virtue of 
the creation, and punishes for this end alone ; and 
thus it coincides with benevolence, for virtue and 
happiness, though not the same, are inseparably 
conjoined.
He looked upon this world as a place 
of education, in which God is training men, by mer- 
cies and sufferings, by aids and temptations, by 
means and opportunities of various virtues, by trials 
of principle, by the conflicts of reason and passion, 
382 
by a discipline suited to free and moral beings, for 
union with himself, and for a sublime and ever- 
growing virtue in heaven." 
" It is not," continues Dr. Channing, " because 
he is our Creator merely, but because he created us 
for good and holy purposes ; it is not because his 
will is irresistible, but because his will is the per- 
fection of virtue, that we pay him allegiance.
We 
venerate not the loftiness of God's throne, but the 
equity of goodness in which it is established." 
A sentiment resembling the last may be found in 
Mason's Memoirs of Gray, in a paper which con- 
tains some very pertinent strictures on the writings 
of Lord Bolingbroke.
In speaking of the Deity, 
Gray remarks : 
" His eternity, infinity, omnipresence, and al- 
mighty power, are not what connect him, if I may 
so speak, with us his creatures.
We adore him, 
not because he always did, in every place, and al- 
ways will, exist, but because he gave and still pre- 
serves to us our existence by an extension of his 
goodness.
We adore him, not because he knoivs 
and can do all things, but because he made us capa- 
ble of knowing and of doing what may conduct us 
to happiness.
It is therefore his benevolence which 
we adore, and not his greatness or power ; and if we 
are only to bear our part in a system, without any 
regard to our own particular happiness, we can no 
longer worship him as our all-bounteous parent, — 
there is no meaning in the term." 
" This unlimited power," says Mr. Locke, " can- 
383 
not be an excellency without it be regulated by wis- 
dom and goodness ; and therefore, looking on God 
as a being infinite in goodness as well as power, we 
cannot imagine he hath made anything with a de- 
sign it should be miserable.
His justice is nothing 
but a branch of his goodness." 
" Je ne vais pas si loin que St. Augustin, qui se 
fut console d'etre damne si telle eut ete la volonte 
de Dieu.
Ma resignation vient d'une source moins 
desinteressee, il est vrai, mais non moins pure, et 
plus digne a mon gre de l'Etre parfait que j'adore.
Dieu est juste : il veut que je souflfre, et il sait que 
je suis innocent.
Voila la motif de ma confiance, 
mon cceur et ma raison me crienf quelle ne me 
trompera pas.
Laissons done faire les homraes et 
la destinee, apprenons a souflfrir sans murmure, tout 
doit a la fin rentrer dans lordre, et mon tour vien- 
dra tot ou tard !
" 
It is delightful thus to find enlightened and dis- 
interested men, who have no object but truth, con- 
curring in their hopes and views from the sponta- 
neous deductions of their own individual minds, and, 
in that perfect love which casteth out fear, reposing 
on their " Father and their God." 
The subject of the present memoir cherished a 
perfect faith in the goodness of God. The good- 
ness of God " was the reason of the hope that was 
in him." Believing that he framed the human soul 
for eternal duration and for happiness, he never 
troubled himself about the time or manner of his 
future existence, or what was to constitute it ; con- 
sideringhimself incapable of forming anyjudgement, 
384 
he relied implicitly on the benevolence of that pa- 
rental Being who had " vouchsafed to call him 
hither to this great assembly and entertainment, and 
had permitted him to contemplate his works, to 
admire and adore his providence, and to compre- 
hend the wisdom of his conduct." 
The apparent evil, the partiality, the injustice, in 
our present life, were to him assurances, combined 
with revelation, of a more perfect state hereafter.
He believed virtue not to be communicated with- 
out effort ; that the great object of our probation 
here is to acquire it, and that to possess ourselves 
of it we must cultivate and cherish it by our own 
unremitting endeavours, by the rules prescribed by 
him who was himself " the way, the truth, and the 
life." 
The following paragraph was found after Sir 
James's death, among other papers, on his library 
table.
It seems to be a memorandum of opinions 
which, had his life been prolonged, he had a design 
to use and enlarge upon.
" The attributes of God are, 
Power, > 
Wisdom, \ All infinite and eternal.
Goodness.
J 
"Power and wisdom are communicable to his 
creatures in any degree he pleases.
Goodness is 
in the very nature of things incommunicable, and 
must be acquired, else it is a nonentity.
"Man has the power of acquiring goodness.
He 
must therefore be fully capable of comprehending 
or of knowing what it is.
But man is manifestly 
385 
incapable of comprehending the wisdom or power 
of God ; nor is it of any use to him to attempt it.
" Hence all our reasonings respecting a future 
state, founded on the wisdom or power of God, or 
on natural principles, have always proved vain." 
" Those only are conclusive which are deduced 
from his goodness ; of which, as we are formed and 
commanded to imitate it, we are necessarily able to 
judge.
— J.
E. Smith." 
His devotional feelings were ardent, retired, con- 
fiding : like the pious Fenelon, he felt that " God 
is the true friend of the heart, and that there is 
no comforter like him." To say he was accus- 
tomed to the duty of prayer, seems needless after 
this, — none was less restricted to a set of words, 
none expressed "the soul's sincere desire" more 
frequently or fervently.
Devotion and benevolence 
were the marked characters of his gifted mind.
His 
love of nature was the love of God.
The subject of the few foregoing pages naturally 
recalls to mind the events of the spring of 1818.
The public has already been in possession of the 
motives which induced Sir James to offer himself 
as a candidate for the botanical chair at Cam- 
bridge*, being neither a member of the university, 
nor of the church of England.

specting Cambridge," (1818); and "A Defence of the Church and 
Universities of England," (1819).

rable Professor Martyn, beginning so early as 1813, 
and all tending to the same point, one only shall be 
selected, to remind the reader of the ground upon 
which he concluded he might safely stand.
One motive, which at least had as much influ- 
ence with Sir James as any prospect of pecuniary 
advantage, was the anticipation of associating with 
a learned and polite body of gentlemen and scholars, 
among whom he had several personal friends and 
warm supporters ; and with these he continued the 
same friendly intercourse as before, though with 
fewer opportunities, and in a different manner, from 
what would have been the case in a nearer connexion 
with the university.
On this account, chiefly, the 
disappointment of his views hurt his affectionate 
and social feelings more than it wounded his pride.
My dear Sir, Pertenhall, March 14, 1818.
The season approaches when I feel an annual 
regret, that in consequence of my age and infirmities 
I am unable to fulfill my duty as Dr. Walker's reader, 
in giving a course of botanical lectures.
If you 
could, consistently with your other engagements, 
undertake to read a course next term, I should 
esteem it a great favour done to me personally; and 
I have no doubt of its being well received by the 
university.
You are aware that you must have the sanction 
of the vice-chancellor, who, I am persuaded, will 
be ready to give the university an opportunity of 
profiting by your instructions, as he doubtless 
knows that you take the lead in the science of bo- 
387 
tany in this country, and that your reputation is 
too well established to need any recommendation 
from me.
As far as my power extends, I am happy 
in giving you full authority to take such specimens 
of plants and flowers as you think requisite for 
your lectures, together with the use of the lecture- 
room, at any time or times that may be convenient, 
— always under the controul of the vice-chancellor, 
and with a complete reliance on your discretion in 
the use of the garden.
Sincerely wishing it may suit your convenience 
to comply with this my request, 
I remain, dear Sir, 
Your ever faithful Friend, 
Thos.
Martyn.
In a subsequent letter the Professor makes the 
following observations : 12th April.
Bradley was never of any university, and had 
no education : my father admitted only with a view 
to the professorship, and never took any degree.
Vigani, the first professor of chemistry, was an 
Italian ; Dillenius, as you know, was a German.
What was Erasmus and many others who were in- 
vited to give lectures merely from their learning, 
independent of any consideration of their opinions 
in religion, or of their having been educated on the 
spot.
T. Martyn.
For Professor Martyn Sir James entertained the 
warmest regard, and their friendship was uninter- 
rupted through life : mutual good will and good 
2 c 2 
388 
offices subsisted between two men, who equally ex- 
perienced that " il y a dans la botanique un charme 
quon ne sent que dans le plein calme des passions, 
mats qui suffit seul alors pour rendre la vie heureux 
et douce." 
Sir James's sentiments towards the clergy of the 
Establishment cannot be better shown than in a 
letter he addressed, some years ago, to a dignitary 
of the church, upon his tendering his resignation 
as Fellow of the Linnaean Society : — 
Dear Sir, 
I found your letter on the table of the Linnaean 
Society at our anniversary meeting, and read your 
resignation with much regret, while I felt obliged 
by your having so largely stated your reasons.
Had 
I been previously informed of your intention, I 
should have been anxious to have altered it, and 
might therefore have presumed to controvert some 
of those reasons.
I have always been particularly 
happy to see my favourite study cultivated by per- 
sons eminent in character or station, and especially 
by the clergy, who, whether of dignified rank, or 
in the humble, not less venerable, walk of country 
pastors, may, in following this pursuit, be eminently 
useful to those around them ; while they relax their 
own minds from severer studies, and derive health 
of body, with tranquillity of mind, from one of the 
purest of all sources.
Indeed they are but following 
one precept of Him who, as I have always thought, 
conferred the highest honour on our study that it 
ever received, and exalted a pleasure into almost a 
389 
duty, when he said, " Consider the lilies of the field 
how they grow." 
Forgive me for citing this authority, so familiar 
to you ; for I hold it as high as you can possibly 
do, though we may differ on some points connected 
therewith.
I have always been no less pleased to 
see the study of nature lead good people to lay 
aside noxious prejudices and antipathies.
I love to 
see the controversialist, like a cultivated plant, dis- 
miss his thorns or his acrimony, and make an Eden 
of the garden of science.
But I encroach too much 
on that province whose duties you so highly adorn.
I am not ignorant of your high clerical character, 
nor of the very extensive calls you must have upon 
you ; nor do I mean to interfere : I only contend, 
like Ray, that the study of the book of nature is in- 
ferior to none in dignity or utility.
I remain, with every sentiment of respect, 
Dear Sir, 
Your very faithful and obedient Servant, 
J. E.
Smith.
A philosophical consideration of a future state of 
existence beyond death and the grave, was a fre- 
quent topic of discourse with Sir James ; not for 
the purpose of expelling doubts, for he entertained 
none, but for the enjoyment of recurring to the 
first, the last, and most unconquerable desire im- 
planted in the human heart.
" I grieve," he says in a letter to Davall, «?
to see 
how much imbecility clouded the latter days of 
Haller ; yet even that is an argument for the im- 
390 
mortality of the soul, had we no other light ; for 
what kind of deity must govern the world, if beings 
capable of what Haller was were only, as it were, a 
flash of existence, and all their acquirements turned 
to no account, and their hopes and powers were ex- 
cited only to be disappointed r " 
" Design," he observes elsewhere, " is evident 
throughout nature.
Some who unhappily doubt 
every thing else, allow this ; but it is sufficient to 
build everv thing upon.
We see wisdom employed 
for beneficent ends.
If we are indulged with powers 
to catch even a glimpse of the Divine Wisdom, is it 
not enough to prove we are something more than 
the clod of the valley ?
But is there no design in 
this permission r — is it intended to call forth our 
powers and hopes, only to destroy them r Where 
would be the wisdom or the beneficence of this ?
If natural religion goes thus far, is there no design 
in the further sources of information with which 
our Maker has favoured us ?
Is it not as evident in 
these as in the other ?
Nature plans the happiness, 
the beauty, the perfection of material beings ; — the 
revealed will of God considers the interests of im- 
mortal creatures ; starving amid the richest treasures 
of nature, if they have no hope beyond!" 
Such were the ideas it gave him pleasure to 
cherish, and to impart to others.
— to build up their 
hopes bv every aid, and persuade to the practice of 
virtue.
His introductory lectures are imbued with 
such sentiments, and express them in terms which 
bring their author before the mental eye of those 
who recollect his conversation, as a portrait reminds 
391 
us of those we knew.
His solemn thoughts were 
such as gave him freer spirits, and while they ele- 
vated the tone of expression enlivened it also.
" One advantage" which Sir James mentions as 
having found in the study of nature is, " that it is 
inexhaustible ; but" (he continues) " it boasts a 
still greater, — that, as far as I have been able to ob- 
serve, it never loses its relish at the decline of life.
Several botanists have continued the pursuit with 
undiminished fondness after the loss of sight, a 
misfortune one would think the most fatal to all 
their enjoyments.
Many more have derived from 
this soothing study the best alleviation they could 
find for the bitterest domestic losses and calamities.
With what delight did Linnaeus in his last illness 
turn over and over the acquisitions of his pupil 
Thunberg in Africa !
— and how have I seen the 
countenance of Scopoli, suffering under the imme- 
diate pressure of an unmerited attack upon his ho- 
nour and all his means of support, resume all its 
wonted animation and pleasure in talking on the 
subject of botany !
As a taste for the beauties of 
nature, or in other words, an admiration of the 
works of God, raises the mind and character above 
the troubles and cares of this world, may we not 
hope that such a temper of mind may be far more 
highly gratified and exalted in a future state ?
Such a 
hope is in harmony with all our best feelings, and 
may surely be humbly indulged without mischief or 
blame ; so far at least as it does not interfere with 
that absolute reference of everything connected with 
futurity to the wisdom and goodness of our Creator, 
392 
which ought to be not only our duty, but our con- 
solation and delight.
In this I conceive the very 
essence of faith and piety to consist.
But under 
the controul of this disposition every enjoyment 
and every hope is enhanced ; and He who has pre- 
sented us with a garden as the seat of primaeval in- 
nocence and delight, cannot be offended by our as- 
sociating the admiration of his works with any 
ideas or hopes concerning the happiness in store for 
us hereafter." 
" Another great recommendation of natural hi- 
story is the habit it necessarily gives of arranging 
our ideas and exercising our powers of discrimina- 
tion.
In this it vies with the study of grammar and 
the mathematics.
It is the pursuit of truth, — a love 
of which is as inherent in every sound mind as the 
love of life.
It is a science of facts ; and the only 
way by which it can of itself be advanced, or con- 
tribute to the improvement of our understandings 
and powers, is by practical observation and inquiry.
It teaches us to see and discriminate, and then to 
reason.
The worm that crawls on the ground can 
perceive, the bird that flies in the air and builds its 
curious nest can contrive ; but man only is allowed 
to contemplate, compare, and weigh the designs of 
Infinite Wisdom.
" The exercise of this high privilege soon brings 
its own reward.
We cannot long ' walk with God 
in the garden of creation,' without admiring the 
beauty and partaking of the felicity which the Cre- 
ator delights to bestow and to display.
"A superficial observation of either, however, 
393 
will afford but imperfect enjoyment or instruction.
This privilege, so consoling to our nature, so en- 
couraging to our hopes, and so improving to our 
intellects, may of itself be said to whisper immor- 
tality.
Nor is it restrained to the eminently wise 
or profoundly learned.
Like all manifestations of 
the divine goodness and mercy, it is plain and open 
to all.
Who does not at once perceive that the 
Author of nature must be wise and good?
Has he 
not then evidently intended that we should perceive 
it, — that we should attend to and cultivate this 
knowledge, and derive wisdom and happiness from 
so rich a source ?
The further we proceed with a 
right mind to prosecute our inquiries, the more are 
all these suggestions confirmed.
This I trust is so 
obvious, that I shall consider it as a tacit sentiment 
between us, more easily perceived than expressed ; 
for all 
' .
. .
. our highest notes the theme debase, 
And silence is our least injurious praise.' 
" As we discover the admirable fitness of every 
part for its destined purpose, we become far more 
sensible of its beauty ; and as we learn how partial 
evil mercifully operates for the prevention of more 
extensive ills, and even for the production of general 
good, we bow in adoration to the wisdom we can- 
not fathom, but in which we soon see we may safely 
and cheerfully confide.
As soon as we enter upon 
the deliberate contemplation of the works of nature, 
we feel the necessity of classing and arranging them 
for our convenience.
" Natural history conducts us to a knowledge of 
394 
the manners and ceconomy of different animals, and 
their places and dependencies on each other in the 
great scheme of creation.
Here the most insensible 
mind cannot fail to be struck with the infinite va- 
riety of means by which similar ends are accom- 
plished ; while amid the richest profusion of variety 
and beauty nothing is superfluous, nor any end at- 
tained but by the most advantageous and compen- 
dious means.
" We are told that * God formed man of the dust 
of the ground,' — and there is much more contained 
in that text than we usually perceive.
In the cre- 
ation of the animal kingdom, and of man at its 
head, the production of intellect was undoubtedly 
the primary object of our Maker.
" An ingenious writer has said of the sublimest 
statue in the world, the Apollo Belvidere, that ' the 
artist has made so much use of matter only as was 
necessary to execute and give a body to his thought.' 
This is literally true of the creation of animated 
beings.
Their corporeal part is manifestly but the 
vehicle, the instrument, the subordinate agent of 
that sentient existence in which their individual 
being consists, and which, in the lowest link of this 
living chain, acts and enjoys, and in the highest, 
reasons, adores, and is even permitted to love and 
imitate, its divine Creator.
c What can be a greater 
example of infinite power,' says the celebrated Lin- 
naeus, whose piety was equal to his knowledge, 
c than a little portion of inactive earth rendered ca- 
pable of contemplating itself as the work of infinite 
wisdom ; and of considering the innumerable ef- 
395 
fects of that wisdom displayed in the surrounding 
creation ?' 
" The exertions of the intellectual part of all 
living beings are spontaneously and invariably di- 
rected to the pursuit of happiness; — it may mistake 
the means, but never loses sight of the end.
It is 
in its turn made subservient to the preservation of 
its material organs, by a dread of pain, an inherent 
love of life, and fear of destruction.
It is obliged 
to attend to the calls of hunger and thirst, and is 
most bountifully rewarded for all such attention, not 
only by the gratification of the senses, but by the 
endearments of social affection, the ties of parental 
love, and of individual attachment ; in all which the 
brutes are allowed to share, and thus to partake of 
some of the best enjoyments of human nature ; as 
we, by the cultivation of our higher powers, and 
especially of our benevolent affections, raise our- 
selves towards the divine.
" Even the exertions necessary in the animal 
world for self-preservation and self-defence, which 
at first sight seem an evil in the creation, will be 
found greatly overbalanced by good in the pleasures 
derived from exertion, activity, and contrivance, 
and the happiness which results from success.
The 
apparent cruelty by which some animals tyrannize 
over their own species, or prey upon others, keeps 
up the perfection of nature by removing the weak 
and the sickly, and prevents the brute creation in 
general from ever knowing the miseries of pro- 
tracted sickness or old age.
When they can no lon- 
ger defend themselves, they are quickly removed.
396 
" It is only we who have higher aims that can 
turn such evils to advantage ; and were it not so, 
we also should most assuredly have been spared all 
similar sufferings.
"If we experience the severest of evils from which 
the brutes are exempt, must it not be for purposes 
which do not concern them ?
Else we should be 
' of all creatures the most miserable.' Thus Nature 
confirms truths which she is not of herself compe- 
tent to teach.
Even we ourselves are made subser- 
vient to the good of the animals below us.
Whole 
tribes of them, in their own nature gentle and de- 
fenceless, are brought up in ease and security to 
serve us for food or for clothing, and never know 
want, or age, or infirmity.
It is our duty that they 
should never know pain, and I wish we fulfilled it.
Much is required from the legislature, even in this 
country, to guard and favour these helpless beings, 
to whom we are so much indebted.
It is no part of 
the plan of Providence that they should be uselessly 
tortured.
He who endowed the horse and the dog 
with obedience and affection, such as may often put 
their masters to shame, designed they should be 
happy, not miserable, in our service.
' A merciful 
man regardeth the life of his beast,' and not only 
its life, but its ease and comfort.
I wish the thought- 
less to consider this, and that the cruel might be 
made to feel it." 
Speaking, in another place, of the characteristic 
properties of animals, vegetables, and minerals, Sir 
James observes, " If it be asked what is this vital 
principle so essential to animals and vegetables, and 
397 
of which fossils are destitute, we must own our com- 
plete ignorance.
We know it, as we know its om- 
nipotent Author, by its effects.
The effects of this 
vital energy are continually going on in every or- 
ganized body, from our own elaborate frame to the 
humblest moss or fungus.
Those different fluids, 
so fine and transparent, separated from each other 
by membranes as fine, which compose the eye, — all 
retain their proper situations (though each indivi- 
dually perpetually removed and renewed,) for sixty, 
eighty, or a hundred years, or more, while life re- 
mains.
So do the infinitely small vessels of an al- 
most invisible insect, the fine and pellucid tubes of 
a plant, — all hold their destined fluids, conveying or 
changing them according to fixed laws, but never 
letting them run into confusion so long as the vital 
principle animates their various forms.
But no 
sooner does death happen, than, without any alter- 
ation of structure, any apparent change in their 
material configuration, all is reversed.
The eye 
loses its form and brightness, its membranes let go 
their contents, which mix in confusion, and yield to 
the laws of chemistry alone.
Just so it happens, 
sooner or later, to the other parts of the animal as 
well as vegetable frame : — chemical changes, putre- 
faction, and destruction immediately follow the total 
loss of life ; the importance of which becomes in- 
stantly evident when it is no more.
I humbly con- 
ceive therefore, that if the human understanding 
can in any case flatter itself with obtaining (in the 
natural world) anything like a glimpse of the imme- 
diate agency of the Deity, it is in the contemplation 
398 
of this vital principle, which seems independent of 
material organization, and an impulse of his own 
divine energy." 
In another introductory lecture, recurring again 
to his own more particular study, Sir James men- 
tions that " A gentleman * of the first rank in ta- 
lents, as well as in society, lately suggested to me a 
lively illustration of the advantages of scientific bo- 
tany as a mere amusement.
* Suppose,' said he, c a 
person were possessed of a secret by which he could 
in the busy throng of this great town, on the sight 
of every one he meets, immediately recognise their 
name, their residence, their occupation, their con- 
nexions, without trouble or uncertainty, it would 
be thought an enviable talent ; but if to this were 
added a power of learning, at the same time, their 
characters, dispositions, and powers, there are few 
who would despise the acquisition of such an advan- 
tage.' Just such is systematic botany with regard 
to plants.
But we may take a far higher ground 
for the recommendation of all natural science : a 
taste for the beauties of nature, or in other words 
an admiration of the works of God, waiving the con- 
sideration of all worldly profit and advantage, co- 
operates with the highest means of divine instruc- 
tion in elevating and improving the mind.
" The christian philosopher, the more deeply he 
studies nature, the more certainly finds every thing 
in harmony with his best hopes and dependencies.
He well perceives that the same power which raises 
a plant from its seed, can abundantly perform its 
* Sir Thomas Frankland, Bart.
399 
promises to him.
The caterpillar that resigns itself 
to its temporary tomb, should be a model of his own 
glad submission to the natural and moral laws of 
his Maker; and if in his inquiries and pursuits he is 
sometimes baffled;, sometimes shocked or distressed 
by apparent unintelligible evil, amid a profusion of 
good, let him.
conceive as addressed to him those 
words which his Saviour addressed to his disciples 
on an extraordinary manifestation of his person, 
* It is 1, be not afraid!"' 
The concluding passage of the Preface to his En- 
glish Flora breathes the same sublime spirit, and 
may be referred to as the latest expression of those 
cheering hopes he was permitted to utter.
"He who feeds the sparrows, and clothes the 
golden lily of the fields in a splendour beyond that 
of Solomon himself, invites us his rational crea- 
tures to confide in his promises of eternal life.
The 
simplest blade of grass, and the grain of corn to 
which he gives ' its own body/ are sufficient to con- 
vince us that our trust cannot be vain.
Let those 
who hope to inherit these promises, and those who 
love science for its own sake, cherish the same be- 
nevolent dispositions.
Envy and rivalship in one 
case are no less censurable, than bigotry and un- 
charitableness in the other.
The former are as in- 
compatible with the love of nature, as the latter 
with the love of God ; and they altogether unfit us 
for the enjoyment of happiness here or hereafter." 
Sir James composed at different times several 
Hymns ; and these, in like manner with what has 
400 
gone before, express his feelings and ideas.
On such 
occasions they were wanned and elevated by a devo- 
tional fervour which those alone can know, who feel 
that at the approach of death, 
" They sink into a Father's arms, 
Nor dread the coming day." 
From nine that are extant, the three which follow 
are inserted as specimens of his talent in this spe- 
cies of composition.
HYMN.
How shall my mortal powers aspire 
To soar above this barren clod ?
How join on earth the heavenly quire, 
And hymn my Saviour and my God ?
Can his transcendent grandeur bow 
To hear a feeble creature's praise ?
Can I propitiate, with my vow, 
" The Ancient of Eternal Days ?
" 
Yet what, but his almighty power, 
Could first from dust and ashes bring 
My humblest longings to adore 
The heaven and earth's all-glorious King?
Would his supreme perfections shine, 
Though veil'd, yet radiant, to my sight, 
Were nought but sin and sorrow mine, 
And my last refuge endless night \ 
Stretch then, my soid, th' advent'rous wing; 
And dare to hope, and love, and praise : 
The God who prompts thy voice to sing 
Confirms thy hopes, and claims thy lays.
Thy love, a spark of heavenly fire, 
His grace will raise and still refine, 
Till certainty absorbs desire, 
And heaven's eternal year is thine.
401 
HYMN.
It is I, be not afraid.
— Matthew xiv.
27.
When power divine in mortal form 
Hush'd with a word the raging storm ; 
In soothing accents Jesus said, 
" Lo, it is I !
be not afraid." 
So, when in silence nature sleeps, 
And his lone watch the mourner keeps, 
One thought shall every pang remove ; — 
Trust, feeble man, thy Maker's love.
Blest be the voice that breathes from heaven 
To every heart in sunder riven, 
When love and joy and hope are fled ; 
" Lo, it is I !
be not afraid." 
When men with fiend-like passions rage, 
And foes yet fiercer foes engage ; 
Blest be the voice, though still and small, 
That whispers — " God is over all." 
God calms the tumult and the storm ; 
He rules the seraph and the worm ; 
No creature is by him forgot, 
Of those who know, or know him not.
And when the last dread hour shall come ; 
While shuddering nature waits her doom ; 
This voice shall call the pious dead ; 
" Lo, it is I !
be not afraid." 
The next, written after the loss of a mother he 
tenderly loved, and, in the course of a few weeks 
after, that of another relative, no less dear to the 
present writer, cannot be inappropriate in this 
place.
Filial affection was one of the strongest 
which Sir James possessed, and it extended to them 
both in no common degree.

Thou shalt sleep with thy fathers.

As o'er the closing urn we bend 
Of each beloved and honour'd friend, 
What tears of anguish roll !
In vain in death's unconscious face 
The living smile we seek to trace 
That spoke from soul to soul.
But shall not memory still supply 
The kindly glance, the beaming eye, 
That oft our converse blest ; 
That brighten'd many a prospect drear, 
Revived our virtue, soothed our care, 
And lull'd each pain to rest ?
And when these frail remains are gone, 
Our hearts the impression still shall own, 
Our mortal path to cheer : 
O God !
to point the way to heaven 
These angel-guides by thee were given ; 
How blest to meet them there !
Had the strength of Sir James Smith's bodily 
frame been commensurate with the powers of his 
mind, his friends might have anticipated length of 
days as his portion : but his health, which had never 
been unbroken, visiblv declined for the last five or 
six years, and on the 17th of March 1828, after 
the illness of a single day, it pleased God to remove 
him from the world.
The quality which rendered the social character 
of the revered subject of these pages so engaging, 
arose not less from the benevolence of his heart 
than from the stores of his understanding.
He shed 
403 
a joy around him, springing from the pure sympa- 
thy he felt for those he knew to be his friends.
Absolutely free from the vanity of display, he 
sought rather to relax his overwrought mind in the 
company of such as cast aside their wisdom for a 
while, or in the presence of the young and inno- 
cent to study nature in another form.
As a naturalist he had a benevolent delight in 
infancy itself, and interpreted the mute language of 
smiles and struggles, the rudiments of expression 
and intelligence which met his own, and gave him 
the happy sensation of looking upon beauty and 
innocence in creatures destined to act a part in a 
new existence, claiming compassion and direction, 
and as the fairest semblance of the kingdom of 
heaven.
This temperament has been obvious to notice in 
the foregoing letters.
However different the pro- 
fession, age, character, or situation, of those who 
corresponded with him, we perceive that each ad- 
dresses him as a friend upon whose fidelity he can 
rely ; — upon various occasions we have observed 
these men of science appealing to the heart of their 
friend for sympathy in distress, or participation of 
prosperity, as if he were the intimate and sole depo- 
sitory of their affections and confidence.
Towards the young and friendless especially these 
feelings were directed ; and in every instance it may 
with truth be asserted that Sir James was no re- 
pecter of persons, but quite unbiassed by the station, 
whether high or low, of the individual towards whom 
his kindly feelings were attracted.
As might be 
2 d 2 
404 
expected, this strength of attachment in his dispo- 
sition was productive of a corresponding one in the 
objects of his esteem.
In later life more particu- 
larly, his love for the young was productive of much 
benefit to their moral character.
He did not pre- 
sent virtue before their eyes, a stern forbidding 
form ; but never omitted an opportunity which of- 
fered, to display the force of some moral precept, 
some religious truth, which his own experience had 
confirmed ; and his own indulgent temper rooted 
such precepts more deeply in the heart.
Of selfish gratifications he had none; "his mind 
was formed for friendship, and could not exist with- 
out it." 
But there is no point wherein he appears more 
amiable, than in the pleasure it gave him to pro- 
mote or hear of the happiness of others ; envy and 
jealousy were passions unknown to him, and he al- 
ways considered them effects of conscious unwor- 
thiness.
If he was in any respect wanting in cha- 
rity, it was towards the malignant dispositions of 
the world.
Of the poor and humble, it gave him heartfelt de- 
light to observe and enter into their scanty pleasures, 
their little vanity, or even weakness ; but the know- 
ledge of the sacrifices they make to humanity and 
duty, their kindness to each other, their fortitude in 
distress, melted his heart, andwillinglywouldhehave 
have wiped all tears from their eyes.
He truly felt 
that " God hath made of one blood all the families 
of the earth," and his benevolent sympathies ex- 
tended to the whole human race.
405 
" A man of a kinder heart," observes his friend 
Dr. Davy, Master of Cains College, " more amiable 
dispositions, and purer moral habits, cannot exist ; 
and it was his felicity to have his mental abilities 
proportioned to his moral qualities.
In his own 
science he had from his youth stood at the head of 
the botanists of this kingdom, and I believe equal 
to those of any other; (but on this subject I must 
leave to those of his friends who are more skilful 
in that department, the office of making a more 
appropriate panegyric ;) but of him it may be truly 
said, that none could enjoy the world possessing 
or deserving more friends, and none could quit it 
with better hopes." 
" This great and irreparable loss," says Mr. Ros- 
coe, " I too much remember as one of the weightiest 
misfortunes of my life ; for though I was sensible 
that the health of my dear friend was precarious, 
yet I had flattered myself that, being younger by so 
many years than myself, I should have left him my 
survivor.
I cannot however but rejoice in his calm 
and happy departure, his great worth fully under- 
stood, his fame established, and his most valuable 
work just finished.
When I consider these circum- 
stances, together with his pure and pious mind, I 
cannot repine at the result ; and if it were not pre- 
sumptuous, I would express an earnest wish that 
my latter day might be like his." 
"To express/' says Dr. Maton, "the sincere and 
deep concern which the melancholy intelligence 
created in my mind, and in that of every one who 
knew our departed friend, seems to be almost su- 
406 
perfluous ; for I am sure that you cannot imagine 
how it should be otherwise than that I should to 
my heart lament such a loss.
The lovers of science 
will join in lamenting it throughout the civilized 
world, and our Society must feel it to be irreparable.
They have lost their corporate parent, as well as 
one of their greatest ornaments.
My friendship 
with the late excellent Sir James Smith was of al- 
most forty years' standing, — it was cordial, it was 
constant.
I shall never cease to reflect on it with 
peculiar pride and satisfaction." 
The nobleman who has succeeded to the presi- 
dent's chair in the Linnsean Society, expresses a re- 
gard which could only be the consequence of the 
same friendly feelings and high esteem which Sir 
James entertained for his lordship.
" I cannot," writes Lord Stanley, " allow a single 
moment to pass without expressing my sincere 
thanks for the very flattering attention shown me 
in communicating the loss we have sustained by 
the removal of our valued friend Sir James Smith, 
— an attention the more flattering as I cannot 
hut consider it a sort of testamentary addition to 
the many acts of kindness I have received from him 
in life, and as a proof that his surviving connexions 
do me the justice to consider me as one of those 
friends who truly regarded, and now as sincerely 
regret him.
i( His loss, indeed, in the friendly and social circles 
in which he so much delighted, must be long and 
deservedly felt ; nor will the place he filled in the 
estimation of the public and literary world, with so 
407 
much advantage to their objects and such high 
credit to himself, be soon or easily supplied.
"I cannot but fear the effect which this shock 
may produce upon the health, already too much 
shaken, of another valuable friend, — I mean Mr.
Roscoe, who, I believe, is at this moment at Holk- 
ham.
It will indeed be singular if the lives of both 
these men, amiable and worthy, as well as able 
supporters of the great principle of religious free- 
dom, should be fated to close just at the moment 
when that great point, as far as regarded at least 
all Protestant dissent, appears to be achieving its 
last final victory." 
This misfortune did not follow immediately, — 
Mr. Roscoe survived his friend more than three 
years.
He survived to add another testimony to 
those already adduced of the value he attached to 
the scientific attainments of his friend.
In the 
preface to his splendid work upon the Monandrian 
plants, while speaking of the recent loss, Mr. Roscoe 
adds the consolatory reflection, " that it did not 
happen till Sir James had been enabled to terminate 
his great work, the English Flora^ a work which 
perfected the system of English botany as far as 
present discoveries admit ; and has, together with 
his other learned writings, conferred upon its author 
a name and station which will remain pre-eminent 
as long as the science itself exists." 
" If," as we are told by the Rev. E.
B. Ramsay, 
" much of the secret of human happiness consists, 
as Paley observes, in the formation of habits of 
observation, a knowledge of botany largely contri- 
408 
butes to that happiness: for in a solitary walk, in a 
journey, or in the absence of those with whom we 
can converse, objects are constantly occurring to 
interest or amuse.
Thus botany has sources of en- 
joyment similar to those so well described by Cicero 
when speaking of the happiness arising from the 
study of letters.
' Hsec studia adolescentiam agunt, 
senectutem oblectant, secundas res ornant, adversis 
perfugium ac solatium prsebent, delectant domi, 
peregrinantur^rustwanUir^ 
" It is a noble and delightful office of the man of 
science to spread around him the happiness of 
knowledge, and to put into the power of others the 
gratifications which science can so liberally afford.
But this is a power not granted to all who are in 
possession of knowledge ; for the communication 
and the possession of wisdom are by no means al- 
ways united ; and surely the value of any man's 
knowledge is to be estimated very much according 
to the happiness he diffuses around him.
The cha- 
racter of the late illustrious President of the Lin- 
naean Society will thus live in connexion with science 
and its pleasures, and his name be repeated with 
gratitude by thousands, who will consider him as a 
benefactor, for having given them habits of obser- 
vation and attention to the natural objects around 
them, by which their sources of enjoyment were 
multiplied and pleasures made to spring up at every 
step." 
" To his extensive botanical acquirements," ob- 
serves Professor Hooker, " he added the high at- 
tainments of an elegant scholar, and a talent of 
409 
composition which has rendered his writings uni- 
versally popular, and has been the means of throw- 
ing a charm over his botanical writings scarcely 
known to the science before." 
A writer in the Philosophical Magazine * thus 
concludes his Obituary : "In summing up the sci- 
entific character of Sir James Edward Smith, it 
may be comprised in a few words.
As a naturalist 
he contributed greatly to the advancement of the 
science, and stood pre-eminent for judgement, ac- 
curacy, candour, and industry.
He was disposed 
to pay due respect to the great authorities that 
had preceded him, but without suffering his de- 
ference for them to impede the exercise of his own 
judgement.
He was equally open to real improve- 
ment, and opposed to the affectation of needless 
innovation.
He found the science of botany, when 
he approached it, locked up in a dead language ; 
— he set it free by transfusing into it his own.
He found it a severe study, fitted only for the re- 
cluse ; — he left it of easy acquisition to all.
In the 
hands of his predecessors, with the exception of his 
immortal master, it was dry, technical and scho- 
lastic ; — in his, it was adorned with grace and ele- 
gance, and might attract the poet as well as the 
philosopher."

APPENDIX.
INTRODUCTORY LECTURE, 
Read at the London Institution, May 2nd, 1825.
THE history of botany as a science has often been given 
in various forms and languages.
It makes a principal 
part of an Introductory Discourse which I had the honour 
of delivering at the opening of the Linnsean Society in 
1788, and which is published in the Linnaean Transac- 
tions and elsewhere.
The subject, under a rather different 
point of view, is continued in the article "Botany " of the 
Supplement to the Edinburgh Cyclopaedia.
It would ill 
become me to take up your time with what is detailed in 
those essays, though I have heard much of the former in- 
troduced into the lectures of other teachers ; and if it 
tended to entertain or inform their hearers, my principal 
ends in the original composition were answered.
I con- 
ceive that a writer on scientific subjects is most honoured, 
when his observations and discoveries are used, without 
mistrust or particular acknowledgement, as current coin, 
whose value is undisputed, and whose stamp and date are 
easily ascertained by those who are curious in such parti- 
412 
culars.
But an author himself ought to be the last per- 
son in the world to look for such authority or to repose 
upon it.
The more he has done, the more he will find to 
do, and, if the world should be disposed to give him cre- 
dit for any thing, the more he will be aware of the duty 
and the difficulty of not misleading its confidence or dis- 
appointing its expectations.
When science has been long 
and extensively cultivated, and is become an object of 
great popular attention, it assumes a very different cha- 
racter from the abstruse pursuits of the cloister or the 
schools, or the speculations of a few recluse and abstracted 
proficients.
TNTo study has undergone a more remarkable 
change in this respect than botany.
From its earliest dawn 
as a science, in the writings of the Greeks and Arabians, 
almost to our own time, it has been considered in no other 
light than as a branch of medical study ; and even the 
highest praise bestowed upon this, his favourite pursuit, 
by the great Haller, is, that " it equals every branch of 
medical science in utility, and surpasses every one in 
agreeableness." The chief object of the earliest and most 
learned botanists, after the revival of literature, was to 
ascertain the plants used in medicine by the ancients ; and 
however imperfectly described in their works, the vege- 
table kingdom was to these botanical physicians a great 
storehouse of remedies, whose recorded qualities were 
scarcely to be contested or examined, provided the indi- 
vidual plants could be settled beyond dispute.
This in- 
deed was the great difficulty, — to the more or less com- 
plete removal of which we are indebted for the existence 
of botany as a learned pursuit; which having engaged, 
and often baffled, the powers of many a first-rate genius, 
has taken its rank among the more distinguished studies 
of philosophers.
The attention of many following ages was 
devoted to the mere discrimination of one kind of plant 
from another, before any ideas of the necessity or the 
principles of arrangement, much less of the constitution 
and ceconomy of vegetable bodies, or of sound principles 
413 
of inquiry into their natures and properties, had ever en- 
tered into the mind of man.
Such objects are comparatively 
of recent date.
Some of them have arisen almost under 
our own observation.
They are now become the most im- 
portant and instructive part of botanical science; and 
when united to an elegant and disinterested love of the 
beauty of nature, as the work of God and an emblem of 
his own boundless perfection, they constitute, in all their 
branches, one of the most refined, improving, and unex- 
ceptionable pursuits, that can claim the notice or employ 
the leisure of persons of either sex, or of any age or condi- 
tion.
Can it be necessary for me, before I go any further, 
to expatiate on the recommendations and advantages 
of my favourite study, to which I have devoted my life?
I take it for granted that none of you would take the 
trouble to come here without some prepossession in its 
favour; and if your partiality be not increased by the 
views, however limited, which I shall have time and op- 
portunity to lay before you, I might now raise your ex- 
pectations only to disappoint them.
We cannot proceed far in even the most general and 
comprehensive views of the physiology of plants, without 
a perception that such inquiries are eminently useful in 
teaching us to think, to consider the most common objects 
in a perfectly new light, and with the help, as it were, of 
new senses.
How many of the more intelligent and im- 
proved of rational beings have enjoyed, and daily do enjoy, 
the beauty and perfume of flowers, the verdure and grate- 
ful shade of trees, in all their luxuiiancy of foliage, — with- 
out considering by what means or for what purpose those 
lovely forms and colours are so infinitely varied !
How 
many taste the delicious variety of fruits, and even see them 
grow gradually to perfection, without bestowing a thought 
on the possible means by which these various exquisite 
scents and flavours are extracted from the same common 
soil; or how the air, the warmth, or the light of heaven, lend 
their respective assistance to the production of such won- 
414 
ders I To these contemplations the young mind may most 
beneficially be directed; but there is no mind above being 
improved by reflection, and the requisite exertion soon 
brings its own reward.
But if the inquiries to which I 
have just alluded, rarely enter into the contemplation of a 
common observer, how much more seldom do the most 
reflecting minds spontaneously notice, with due attention, 
those almost infinitely varied circumstances of form, situ- 
ation, or colour, by which individuals of the vegetable as 
well as of the animal creation, and their several parts, are 
distinguished; observing, at the same time, those delicate 
and intricate combinations and coincidences by which the 
whole of nature is harmonized, and her manifold irregu- 
larities and luxuriances reduced to the most perfect order!
Here indeed our limited faculties fail us, as we attempt to 
measure them against the operations of Omniscience ; but 
we may derive abundant consolation from the reflection, 
that we are allowed and enabled to consider those opera- 
tions at all, and to converse, at the most humble distance, 
with Him, who in perfect wisdom has made them all, and 
who, in condescending to render his laws in any measure 
intelligible to us, has manifestly designed that we should 
at least try to understand them.
If he has not made the 
study of these natural laws, like those of his moral govern- 
ment, our indispensable duty, he has reserved no ordinary 
reward for such of his children as raise their thoughts to 
him even among these his lowest works.
What he has 
made beautiful to us, he doubtless intended we should ad- 
mire ; and in whatever form we are allowed to trace the 
footsteps of his wisdom and beneficence, it must be, in 
every instance, for the great ends of our own moral and 
intellectual improvement.
Such considerations as these cannot but suggest them- 
selves to every mind directed to the observation of nature.
They stimulate us to exertion, and they reward our perse- 
verance.
They furnish us also with a ready answer to all 
who doubt the importance or the utility of our pursuit, and 
415 
who think it a degradation of their own sublime talents or 
characters, to submit either to the guidance or the admo- 
nition of infinite wisdom, however manifested to us.
How far the attentive study, or even the slightest ob- 
servation of nature, is delightful and salutary to the mind, 
let those say who have, by a natural taste or an acquired 
habit, given themselves to such contemplations.
Is it 
better to walk abroad with the eyes open or shut?
Is the 
interchange of ideas in human society delightful and in- 
structive ?
Are the imitations of nature in the finest works 
of art admirable ?
And shall it not be thought a privilege 
to hold converse with the source of all thought and wis- 
dom and perfection ?
Do not the changes of seasons, and 
the endless variations in the aspect of nature and her pro- 
ductions, excite perpetual attention, and entertain us with 
never-ceasing variety?
If our deepest inquiries lead us so 
far as to understand why a bud unfolds itself in the spring, 
and a leaf falls in autumn, we shall have learned enough 
to convince us of the existence of design in nature, and of 
the application of the most wise and compendious laws to 
the most decided and satisfactory ends.
One fact, thus 
established and understood, may serve the philosopher as 
a basis, not by his machinery to overturn the world, but 
to raise a structure that shall truly reach from this world 
to another.
The study of nature is undoubtedly, above all 
others, a science of practical observation ; but to with- 
hold the exercise of our reasoning faculties as we pursue it, 
would be a strange example of intellectual blindness.
The 
old physicians indeed, to whom I have alluded, were often 
content to adopt the opinions and follow the practice of 
men who had lived a few centuries before them ; and some 
have declared they would rather be in the wrong with an 
ancient than in the right with a modern.
But such an ab- 
ject prostration of the best faculties and duties of man has 
never long existed, except where the most sordid interest 
has acquired an exclusive dominion.
In medicine and na- 
tural science such a tyranny must soon work its own cure ; 
410 
for the physician .or the philosopher who will not think for 
himself, is not likely to be long trusted or respected by 
others.
Systematic botany, as a branch of natural history, is 
conversant with the external forms of things ; but even 
this is advanced by the study of their internal nature and 
ceconomy.
So the qualities of plants are better understood, 
the more attentively we scrutinize the laws of their exte- 
rior configuration.
These various inquiries, therefore, may 
go hand in hand with great advantage ; though they have 
seldom done so, — as will appear to any one who pays a 
little attention to the history and progress of each.
The discrimination of the species of plants, which so 
long occupied the earlier botanists, whose labours are re- 
corded for our use in the numerous descriptions and often 
excellent figures of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, 
could scarcely be pursued without leading to some ideas of 
arrangement or classification.
And yet it is a curious fact, 
that such principles as these early botanists put forth were 
singularly deficient in accuracy and ingenuity.
To class 
plants according to their being eatable or poisonous, bul- 
bous or fibrous in their roots, arborescent or herbaceous in 
their constitution, is, in every point, almost equally futile 
and uninstructive.
Nor is it less curious, that philosophers 
of great eminence, who long after undertook the investi- 
gation of the anatomy and philosophy of the vegetable 
kingdom, were (to their own great disadvantage,) as little 
attentive to the natural affinities or diversities of plants, in 
the prosecution of their various experiments and the theo- 
ries founded upon them.
In like manner, the class of pro- 
fessed systematic writers, in their earliest attempts at ar- 
rangement, seem to have been led more by rules of tech- 
nical discrimination than of natural or philosophical com- 
bination.
None of these three descriptions of persons 
thought of deriving any aid from each other.
Hence the 
reproach not altogether unjustly cast upon systematic 
botany, or at least upon some systematic botanists, — that 
417 
their study teaches nothing of the uses of plants.
On the 
other hand, physiologists, in their investigations of the ve- 
getable as well as animal kingdoms, have fallen into errors 
and laboured under many disadvantages, for want of accu- 
rately knowing one thing from another ; just as mere prac- 
tical or empirical observers or collectors of plants, so far 
from noticing any circumstance that might lead by reason 
or analogy to assist their inquiries, very often, from the 
neglect of the clearest principles, commit the most absurd 
mistakes.
Thus I have known Chervil gathered for Hem- 
lock, the purple Ly thrum for the Digitalis, and Creeping 
Crowfoot for the Fiorin Grass.
The great physiologist 
Spallanzani made observations upon young aquatic snails, 
which had not yet acquired their shells, mistaking them 
for the vegetable Tremella; and proved, by learned de- 
duction, that the said Tremella, or rather the snails, were 
of an animal nature ; nor was he at all pleased at being- 
set right in this matter of fact.
We are indebted to the Italian philosophers of the seven- 
teenth century, especially to Malpighi, for the first con- 
siderable information respecting the anatomy or internal 
structure of the vegetable body ; though our ingenious 
countryman, Dr. Grew, nearly about the same time was 
intent on the same subject.
In the next century their facts 
and observations, assisted by new ones, were made good 
use of by physiologists, properly so called, — such as 
Hales, Blair, Bradley, and our immortal Newton himself, 
in England ; and more recently by Du Hamel and Bonnet, 
with a number of less original writers, on the continent.
Labourers in this field of science have, for some time past, 
not been wanting, though much yet remains to be done.
Every hand is not alike successful in advancing the pro- 
gress of real knowledge.
Those who have had some par- 
ticular object in view, as the uses of the stamens and 
pistils of plants, or the theory of their reproduction, have 
paid little regard to the physiology of other parts, — as the 
calyx, corolla, or foliage.
So, with respect to classification,

some have entered very deeply and successfully into the 
accurate principles of generic and specific distinction, as 
Dillenius, who hardly gave a thought to general arrange- 
ment ; while many systems have been planned by men 
who had no correct ideas of the natural principles of dis- 
crimination or affinity.
It seems as if the science of botany were no sooner 
destined to emerge from obscurity and confusion, by a just 
perception on these various subjects, than it becomes in 
danger of plunging again into darkness by a neglect of 
them.
The natural principles of arrangement for a scien- 
tific knowledge of plants, and a permanent discrimination 
of their families and species, have been no sooner distin- 
guished (at the suggestion of Linnaeus) from an artificial 
scheme, for their convenient investigation, than these dif- 
ferent objects are confounded.
Local Floras, for begin- 
ners, are disposed according to natural orders ; as if 
plants could be made out by them in an analytical man- 
ner, — which the most learned could scarcely attempt.
This w r ould perhaps be of small consequence, did not the 
depreciation of the artificial system of Linnaeus induce a 
neglect of those great and important principles, that di- 
dactic precision independent of all systems, to which his 
own fame and the advancement of every branch of natural 
science are owing.
If any of his principles should prove 
to be ill-founded, or his laws objectionable, either with 
regard to the characters or the names of plants, let those 
who are competent by all means amend them.
Let Lin- 
naeus himself be brought back to his own wise laws, which 
he too often transgresses.
But let not inadvertence or ignorance take place of his 
sagacity and experience, and publish their crudities with- 
out reading his works ; founding genera without knowing 
any sound rules for their discrimination, and giving names 
according to futile principles which have been scouted 
over and over again.
The French nation, always aiming at a paramount au- 
419 
thority in matters of science, grudging England her New- 
ton, and Sweden her Linnaeus, has attempted to make a 
schism in botany, as in other departments of knowledge.
But these are the contemptible aims of second-rate cha- 
racters.
The illustrious Frenchman Bernard de Jussieu, the 
early and confidential friend of Linnaeus, conceived a phi- 
losophical idea of natural orders of plants, and conferred 
on the subject with the only man whom he found capable 
of appreciating or understanding them.
He, in his letters 
to Linnaeus, even gives hira the honour of having first 
formed a scheme of natural orders of plants.
However 
this may be, they certainly laboured for some time in con- 
junction.
Afterwards Linnaeus pursued his own course 
alone ; and the first and most important result was the 
assertion of a principle to which I have already alluded, 
— that natural and artificial classification are in themselves 
essentially distinct, and calculated for purposes altogether 
incompatible with each other.
This may be easily il- 
lustrated.
That the distinction of one species of plant 
from another is strictly natural, no one will deny.
Such 
a distinction is not only obviously founded in nature, but 
is confirmed, as clearly as possible, by experience, in the 
vegetable as well as the animal kingdom.
Varieties among 
plants do, indeed, often arise from seed, originating in 
various causes ; which causes are, as yet, very imperfectly 
known.
But the experience of every day teaches, that 
such varieties are but of limited duration.
They are aber- 
rations from the regular plan of Nature, which she is ever 
checking and defeating.
As far as any observation or 
record extends, no permanent change has taken place in 
any known species of plant.
On the contrary, the history 
of those variations which have most attracted notice, as in 
eatable fruits and ornamental flowers, shows very distinctly 
that each has but a limited and uncertain duration.
This 
fact being more clearly demonstrated by Linnaeus than it 
had previously been, he advanced a step further, and as- 
2 e2 
420 
serted, that certain assemblages of species, of plants as 
well as animals, agreeing in their appropriate characters 
and qualities, are as much founded in nature as the 
species themselves.
These are called genera, or fami- 
lies of plants.
Each is marked by an assemblage of 
natural characters, in which our idea of such genus is 
founded ; while it is distinguished from all others by 
some essential character.
A few familiar examples will 
explain this.
In the animal kingdom the great tribe of 
Monkeys forms a natural genus or assemblage of species, 
which no one will dispute.
The Lion, Tiger, Leopard, Cat, 
and many more, constitute another, whose rough tongue 
and retractile claws exhibit an essential character, that 
confirms their other peculiarities and common habits.
Parrots, also, happily termed " the monkeys of birds," 
are no less similar to each other than different from the 
rest of their tribe.
In plants, the genus Rosa, under all 
the elegant differences of its species and their several va- 
rieties, is no less well marked.
You will find its indis- 
putable characters in every botanical book.
The valuable 
genus Quercus, the Oak, known by the acorn and its scaly 
cup; the very curious and extensive genus Ficus, the Fig, 
so peculiarly distinguished by the concealment of its 
flowers in a cell or bag, which afterwards becomes the 
fruit ; are both no less obviously defined by the hand of 
nature than a dog and a horse.
But there are other natural assemblages not less evi- 
dent than natural genera.
These are termed natural orders.
The Rose, the Bramble, the Strawberry, and the Cinque- 
foil, have numerous characters, as well as properties, in 
common, which stamp them all together as a natural 
order ; while each is marked by a peculiarity in its fruit, 
not unattended by other differences, by which its indi- 
vidual generic distinction is just as clearly defined.
So 
beasts of prey and birds of prey, properly so called, are 
known to everybody as natural tribes, consisting of several 
421 
no less natural genera or assemblages of species.
Nor are 
Grasses, as one clear natural order, and Umbelliferous 
plants as another, less strikingly evident among vegeta- 
bles.
Bernard de Jussieu and Linnaeus concurred in 
tracing out several of these natural orders.
But Linnaeus, 
who long survived his learned friend, at length became 
persuaded, that neither our knowledge of the species and 
genera of plants, nor the discriminative powers of the 
human mind, were as yet adequate to the forming a ge- 
neral system of such orders ; nor even to define, perhaps 
any one of them, beyond a possibility of doubt or excep- 
tion.
Genera may, in a vast number of instances, be 
clearly and technically defined with almost mathematical 
precision ; but scarcely any natural order, however di- 
stinctly perceptible, has yet been reduced to irrefragable 
definition in words.
This being the case, it is manifest 
that no assemblage of such orders can serve for the ana- 
lytical investigation of unknown plants.
That object is attainable by simple and indisputable 
principles only, which keep clear of the ambiguities of na- 
tural orders, and which require no previous knowledge of 
any such combinations.
The purpose of an artificial sy- 
stem, or any system for the use of a learner, is, to make 
out the characters, name, and history of some unknown 
plant.
The chief object of the study of natural orders is to 
enable us to understand and to teach others the limits of 
natural genera.
It is of great consequence that these two very distinct 
objects should not be confounded, for they cannot be as- 
similated.
A simple and ready artificial arrangement, on 
the plan of an alphabet, is necessary for those who, hav- 
ing found a plant, want to discover its name and history, 
by investigation of its technical characters, according to 
rules which are easily learned, and require no previous ex- 
pei'ience.
Such is the sole aim of the popular system of Linnaeus.
Being founded on parts which every plant in perfection 
422 
must have, it must be universally applicable.
These parts 
are the stamens and pistils of flowers.
Their number, 
situation, and proportion, afford the principles by which 
the twenty-four classes of Linnaeus, and their respective 
orders, are discriminated.
This alphabet is the key to our 
botanical dictionaries, whether they be universal systems, 
or Species Plant arum ; or whether they be partial or local 
catalogues, termed Floras, of particular countries, or ca- 
talogues of limited collections or gardens.
Such works as these last have multiplied prodigiously 
since the promulgation of the Linnaean system, and have 
tended very essentially to promote a practical knowledge 
of plants.
To this end, they should be accompanied with 
as much useful information as their concise plan admits ; 
or, at least, with references to more ample treatises.
Much scorn has been bestowed, by some affected phi- 
losophers, upon these "mere catalogues" as they call 
them, which, as they allege, teach nothing but names.
But these philosophers have never attempted to instruct 
us how we are to perpetuate or communicate a knowledge 
of things, without the very commodious invention of di- 
stinguishing them by names.
The subjects of the vege- 
table kingdom are indeed so immensely numerous (sixty 
thousand Phaenogamous), that this study of nomenclature 
is become of itself no less arduous than necessary ; but 
be this as it may, it cannot be dispensed with.
Voyages and accounts of distant countries are now no 
longer written or read for mere amusement, like novels 
or fairy tales.
We are not now to be satisfied with 
reading that particular nations or people use some " cer- 
tain herb or tree" for food or medicine.
We expect to 
know the scientific name, or the botanical affinities, of 
every curious or important plant, whence alone we can 
derive any real instruction.
I hope it will in time be thought no less essential, that 
the distinguishing characters of every such object, in the 
animal as well as vegetable kingdom, should be indicated 
by travellers of competent information.
423 
When we have stored our minds with the names, and 
a sufficient practical knowledge of the technical distinc- 
tions of a number of plants, we may try to study their 
natural affinities awl properties.
We shull find where we are most likely to meet with 
an eatable fruit, a medicine of a particular quality, or a 
texture or substance that may serve any one ceconomical 
purpose.
Thus a sound scientific knowledge is acquired 
step by step ; and, accordingly, Linnaeus read lectures on 
the natural orders of plants to his most assiduous and ac- 
complished pupils only.
To begin to teach botany by 
these orders, would be like putting Harris's Hermes into 
the hand of an infant, instead of his horn-book.
Linnaeus, to the last, professed himself but a learner in 
this abstruse science ; and was so well aware of his limited 
knowledge, that he never would attempt to construct any 
general system of natural classification.
He did indeed, 
as his friend Bernard de Jussieu had done, attempt ranging 
his orders in a simple series, there being a manifest af- 
finity between some of them rather than others.
He went 
a step further, and formed a sort of map, indicating in a 
geographical manner the proximity and the bearings of 
the several orders with regard to each other.
This was an 
original idea of Linnaeus, and it greatly facilitates a com- 
prehensive notion of the subject.
In this state he left it ; 
and we are indebted to two or three of his pupils, who 
took notes of his lectures, and with his leave published 
them, for almost all our knowledge of his principles or 
opinions.
These are often so imperfectly or incorrectly 
detailed, that we cannot but lament the work was not un- 
dertaken, or at least revised and corrected, by himself.
Meanwhile, however, the ancient rivalship between the 
schools of Upsal and of Paris took the commendable and 
beneficial form of a just and worthy emulation.
To the 
French botanists we are indebted for the great attempt of 
moulding into a regular shape the philosophical specula- 
tions of Linnaeus and of Bernard de Jussieu.
The latter 
424 
was succeeded by a nephew, capable of advancing his un- 
dertakings, and worthy to inherit his fame.
The present 
Professor de Jussieu has constructed a regular system, or 
methodical arrangement, upon the natural orders of his 
uncle : a system which is necessarily imperfect, because 
there are numerous genera whose orders remain undeter- 
mined ; and necessarily artificial also, because human 
knowledge, as well as human intellect, being limited, no 
man can fully comprehend, much less preconceive, the 
entire plan of the all-wise Author of Nature, without ex- 
ception or ambiguity.
One celebrated character only, the 
famous Sir John Hill, has laid claim to this power.
When Dr. Garden discovered in Carolina what was 
thought to make a new order of animals, Sir John Hill 
wrote to congratulate him, as having verified a sublime 
speculation of his own.
" I have disposed," says he, " all the works of creation 
in a series or chain, and have distinguished each by its 
appropriate number.
In doing this I have perceived that 
there must be some intermediate beings, not yet disco- 
vered, to fill up breaks in my chain.
Your new animal 
comes precisely between two of my numbers where there 
is one number unoccupied." Had I not seen the original 
letter of Sir John Hill in Dr. Garden's hands, I could 
scarcely have believed the existence of so much pre- 
sumption.
The opinion, and its pretended anticipation, 
prove equally unfounded ; for the animal supposed to con- 
stitute, not only a new genus but a new order, proves 
really a fish of the well-known genus Murana.
in ac- 
ceding to this opinion of the learned Professor Camper 
I must ingenuously confess, that, in this instance at least, 
the sagacity of an able physiologist has rendered a ma- 
terial service to systematic naturalists ; though I cannot 
submit to the contempt with which he in general regarded 
men as able and learned as himself, though in a line of 
science for which he had little taste or ability.
The na- 
tural orders of plants, therefore, not being as yet all de- 
425 
termined ; and the relationship of many of them to each 
other either very disputable or not at all perceptible; there 
being, moreover, a great number of genera which cannot 
be referred to any of them ; the chain of connexion by 
which they have, however ingeniously, been linked to- 
gether, constitutes, in my opinion, but an artificial system, 
infinitelyless easy and commodious than the professedly ar- 
tificial system of Linnseus, and making combinations, in 
several instances not more natural.
This has been well 
illustrated by my able friend Mr. Roscoe, in the eleventh 
volume of the Linnaean Society's Transactions.
No 
one can deny that the present system of Jussieu offers 
the whole vegetable kingdom to our consideration under 
a most instructive view, as bringing together every ac- 
knowledged point of affinity, and indicating even the 
most remote.
I only contend that it is but an artificial 
and imperfect assemblage of natural orders, and that its 
scheme of arrangement is totally unfit for the use of 
beginners, the most learned, who have no occasion to at- 
tend to it, being scarcely competent to unravel its nume- 
rous contradictions and exceptions.
What seems to me 
most paradoxical is, that botanists, of the French school, 
who are strenuous for the use of natural orders to the ex- 
clusion of an artificial method, object altogether to the 
principle of Linnaeus, that all genera are, or ought to be, 
natural ; they assert, that all genera are mere artificial 
combinations, existing in the mind of man only ; and yet 
they will have their own orders, which are assemblages 
of such genera, to be indisputably founded in nature.
In the one point or the other they surely must err.
Both 
appear natural to me, though I am very far from suppo- 
sing that we have brought the knowledge of either to 
perfection.
We can only advance towards that point by 
long experience and close observation.
The best practical botanist, is he who knows the great- 
est number of species, and combines them into the most 
natural genera.
The best theoretical one, is he who con- 
426 
ceives the most clear and comprehensive idea of natural 
orders, separately or combined ; who perceives best what 
constitutes an order or a genus, and, above all, from what 
particular principles, in each different order, generic di- 
stinctions are best to be derived.
But most of all I 
should wish to attempt the demonstration of some of his 
or Linnaeus's natural orders, for they are very often the 
same, that you may be enabled to see in what their di- 
stinctions consist, and to pursue the ideas of these great 
men, for your own pleasure and instruction.
The subject is 
boundless, and perfection is unattainable.
But we may 
derive great assistance from considering nature under va- 
rious points of view, and from applying to practical, use 
what others have, with great pains and difficulty, been 
able to establish.
All systematic botanists, since the subject was first at- 
tentively considered, have concurred in one sentiment, 
that the parts of fructification, or, in other words, the 
organs which compose the flower and fruit, are the only 
ones which can, with any certainty, be resorted to for the 
essential principles of arrangement.
Linnaeus extends 
this maxim to the generic characters of plants, in which 
botanists of the French school do not concur.
I cannot but esteem this one of their greatest errors, 
which, as far as I can perceive, may always be avoided by 
a competent exertion of the mental powers ; the parts of 
fructification, well considered, being abundantly sufficient 
in every case to characterize genera that are really and 
naturally distinct.
For those that are not so, of which 
examples in books are but too frequent, I am ready to al- 
low that no good distinctions are to be found.
The first 
great difference in plants universally considered as divi- 
ding the vegetable kingdom into two most natural and 
essentially distinct sections, is founded on the structure 
of the seed, and its mode of germinating or sprouting.
If its form be simple, and the bud or embryo undivided, 
the plants so circumstanced are said to be Monocotyle- 
427 
dories, or having but one cotyledon.
If the embryo di- 
vides, in sprouting, into two * primary lobes, which origi- 
nally made up the bulk of the seed, as in a Pea or Bean, 
and between which the young plant springs, such are 
termed Dicotyledones.
These are the most numerous.
The obscure tribes of Fungi, Mosses, Ferns, and others, 
whose parts of fructification are but partially known, and 
which Linnaeus referred to his class Cryptogamia, are 
supposed, with a few doubtful additions, to make up a 
third division, called Acotyledones, as having no cotyledon 
at all.
But this is an extremely doubtful point, scarcely 
capable of demonstration, or even of investigation ; and 
which the further we look we find less reason to adopt.
It would be more consonant with fact to say, that what 
are denominated Monocotyledones, have really no cotyle- 
dons.
As, however, the Cryptogamous tribes just men- 
tioned, are too imperfectly known in their germination, to 
allow us to say anything decisive about them, it is best to 
leave them apart, and to adopt for the bulk of the vege- 
table kingdom the popular terms and ideas of Monocoty- 
ledones and Dicotyledones.
This distinction is confirmed 
by others, well worthy of remark.
The Monocotyledones 
are most simple in their whole structure, external as well 
as internal.
Their vascular system is on a larger scale, 
and more easily examined.
Their bark and wood are 
scarcely, if at all, deposited in concentric or annual layers.
Their stems are less branching, their foliage generally 
simple, undivided, and without indentation.
The parts 
of fructification are disposed according to the number 3 
and its compounds, which I believe the learned Mr.
Brown either first observed, or, at least, has much con- 
firmed and illustrated.
The Dicotyledones are in every respect more complex 
and various.
Their seed-lobes either remain under ground, 
or more commonly are elevated in the form of a pair of 
leaves, till the real foliage comes forth.
The wood of 
* Rarely many-cleft.
428 
their stems and roots is composed of annual circles, in the 
youngest or outermost of which the whole process of their 
circulation, nourishment, and increase, for the present year, 
is transacted.
The number 5 and its compounds generally 
prevail in their parts of fructification.
These great primary distinctions being, in the main, 
established, we proceed to principles of subdivision.
In 
these, what is technically called insertion, or the mode in 
which one part is situated with respect to another, takes 
the lead.
Chiefly is to be considered whether the Ger- 
men (the rudiment of the fruit or seed,) is below the other 
parts of the flower or above them, inferior or superior.
Next we are to notice how the Petals (coloured leaves 
of a flower) if present, and the Stamens (organs of im- 
pregnation) are connected with each other, or with the 
Calyx (external covering).
Lastly, whether the Stamens 
and Pistils are situated in the same flower or in two di- 
stinct ones of the same species.
These several principles are the key to Jussieu's sy- 
stem.
The comparative value, or certainty, of each, we 
shall investigate as we proceed.
We must always keep 
in mind that not one of them is, in every case, strictly ab- 
solute, or without exception, in its interference with na- 
tural orders, perhaps not even the great division of Mo- 
nocotyledones and Dicotyledones.
Hence, an ingenious French author, M.
Richard, re- 
jecting this, has divided plants, according to their mode 
of germination, into Endorhizte and Exorhiza.
The first, as the name imports, produce their root from 
an internal tubercle, evolved in germination.
In the others, 
the lower point of the embryo itself becomes the root.
Endorhizce are generally analogous to Monoeotyledones, 
and Exorhizce to Dicotyledones.
But besides the great 
obscurity of these distinctions, nothing is gained by them.
They are liable to as many exceptions as the cotyledons.
I have only now to add, that nothing like mathematical 
certainty is to be found in the classification of plants.
429 
Methodical arrangement of natural bodies is but a choice 
of difficulties.
Specific characters, indeed, very often pos- 
sess this absolute certainty, independent of any casual 
variation.
Generic characters also are, not unfrequently, 
absolute, and capable of precise limitation.
Sometimes 
they are marked by one most elegant and peculiar cha- 
racter.
But classes and orders, however apparently 
obvious, are to be defined but in general terms; they are 
rather to be perceived than described.
If, therefore, I 
shall be obliged, in explaining the method of Jussieu, to 
point out so many anomalies and inconsistencies, as may 
seem to render it too difficult and uncertain for the most 
learned to make any use of, I wish my hearers to attri- 
bute those imperfections rather to the intricacies of nature, 
than to the inability of the writer.
The difficulties in 
question do not affect an experienced botanist ; who, 
knowing the orders themselves, neither wants a clue to 
make them out, nor a very precise definition of their limits, 
concerning which he must judge for himself.
But for 
these very reasons, it is clear as the day, that no student 
can enter upon the first knowledge of plants, and the in- 
vestigation of their genera and species, by so intricate 
and precarious a path.
ON THE SURNAME OF LINN^US— See page 343.
Sir J.
E. Smith to the Editor of the Monthly Magazine.
Sir, Norwich, March 10, 1810.
In reply to your correspondent in the Monthly Mag.
for March last, p.
123, I beg leave to give my reasons 
for continuing to write the name of Linnaeus, in its ori- 
ginal form, rather than Linne.
The Swedes did not adopt 
the use of regular surnames till the early part of the last 
century.
When each family took a name, literary people 
in general chose one derived from Greek or Latin ; hence 
arose the family names of Mennander, Melander, Dryan- 
430 
der, Aurivillius, Celsius, &c.
Some gave a Latin termina- 
tion to names of barbarous origin, as Bergius, Retzius, 
Afzelius, Browallius ; and these became Swedish names 
even with that termination entire.
The name of Linnaeus was in this latter predicament.
Its termination, therefore, is by no means " boorish," or 
" plebeian," or " vile," but of classical origin ; and these 
names have the peculiar felicity of being transferable into 
any language without inconvenience, and especially of en- 
tering spontaneously into Latin composition.
If your 
correspondent be in the habit of writing or reading many 
scientific books in Latin, he will duly appreciate this last 
consideration.
With respect to English writing, as we 
mention Titus, and Marcus Aurelius, in their original or- 
thography, without following the French, who call them 
Tite and Marc Aurt-le, no one has found any difficulty in 
making an English word of Linnaeus.
When this great man became ennobled, I am well aware 
that, in conformity to the court ceremonies of the day, 
which were all French, a termination borrowed from the 
language of that people was, in his case, as in others, 
adopted, with the strange jumble of a Gothic prefix, and 
he became in Swedish von Linne, as in French de Linne, 
and in barbarous Latin a Linne.
No one that I know of 
has adopted any of these in English, though some have 
called him Linne, but hitherto with little success.
I 
presume no one would wish to Anglicize his name into 
Linny ; and yet that, however ridiculous, would be the 
only correct and consistent measure, except we retain the 
von, the de, or the a.
I have therefore always used his original name, with- 
out any design, or surely any suspicion, of slighting the 
honours which his sovereign conferred upon him, and 
which, I will venture to say, reflected glory on his royal 
patron in return.
By such a disposal of honours their 
lustre is preserved, as in the cases of a Marlborough, a 
Newton, and a Nelson, from that deterioration to which, 
431 
from human imperfection and error, they are in their very 
nature otherwise prone, but from which it is the interest 
of every good citizen to guard them.
I do not conceive, 
however, that anyone needs to be reminded of the various 
dignities, whether courtly or academical, conferred on the 
illustrious Swede.
His simple name Linnaeus, recalls them 
all.
We have no occasion to say the Emperor Julius 
Caesar, King Henry IV.
of France, Mr. Secretary Milton, 
or the Right Honourable Mr. Addison.
Neither is it ne- 
cessary to say Sir Charles Linnaeus, or the Chevalier de 
Linne, to remind us that he was Knight of the Polar Star, 
and the first person who ever received that honour, equal 
to the Garter with us, for literary merit.
I must, there- 
fore, protest against any interpretation of intended slight 
in this case, for my meaning is the very reverse.
I believe the practice followed in England has decided 
the conduct of other nations.
In Latin he is now always 
called Linnaeus, even by the Swedes, and, what is still 
more striking, the French now write Linnaeus, even in their 
own language.
I presume your correspondent had never 
a design of recommending, for Latin composition, any 
thing but Linnaeus; and I hope he will not hereafter think 
me pertinacious, nor in any respect blameable, if, for the 
above reasons, I continue the same practice in English, 
leaving every one to followme, or not, at his discretion, and 
trusting to time and experience for a final decision.
I 
must express my regret that the title of the Linnaoan So- 
ciety, as I would always write it, has in its charter been 
spelt Linnean.
The latter had in view the name of Linne, 
and was so far proper; but I have always conceived the 
diphthong to be more classical, and if we preserve the word 
Linnaeus in English, undoubtedly more correct.
In this 
point, most certainly every writer may judge for himself, 
and in speaking there luckily is no ambiguity.
I remain, Sir, 
Yours, Sec.
J as.
Edw. Smith.

The grammatical article printed below is mentioned at 
p. 340, in a letter to Mr. Roscoe.
OBSERVATIONS ON SHALL AND WILL.
To the Editor of the Athenceum.
Sir, Norwich, Aug. 5, 1807.
The various writers on English grammar have scarcely 
explained with sufficient precision the proper use of the 
verbs shall and will, with the preterites should and would.
Many persons consider the just application of these verbs 
as a sort of shibboleth, a test of a true-born Englishman, 
for which no rule can be given, and which no foreigners, 
not even our fellow-subjects of Scotland and Ireland, can 
ever learn.
The latter is undeniable ; and it is equally 
true that an Englishman, however uneducated, will never, 
except corrupted by an intercourse with strangers, com- 
mit an error in this respect.
Nevertheless, before we 
indulge in triumph over other people, it becomes us to 
give, if possible, a reason for our own conduct ; nor ought 
any reproach to fall on those who, in learning a language, 
err on a point concerning which no rule can be given.
Allow me therefore to suggest that shall and will are 
two distinct verbs, which interchange their meanings in the 
different persons.
Shall and should express, in the first 
person, simple futurity, but in the second and third per- 
sons they imply a command or decision of the speaker.
On the contrary, will and would in the first person im- 
ply the same command or decision, while in the second 
and third they express only simple futurity.
There is, 
however, a third verb, will, in every one of the three per- 
sons, which expresses the decision of the person spoken 
of.
This is best understood by a table of each verb and 
its tenses.
433 
No. 1.
sxpresses simple fu- 
turity : 
I shall 
Thou wilt 
He will 
We shall 
You will 
They will.
I should 
Thou wouldst 
He would 
We should 
You would 
They would.
No. 2.
the decision of the 
speaker : 
1 will 
Thou shalt 
He shall 
We will 
You shall 
They shall.
Preterite.
I would 
Thou shouldst 
He should 
We would 
You should 
They should.
No. 3.
the decision of the 
party spoken of.
I Will 
Thou wilt 
He will 
We will 
You will 
They will.
I would 
Thou wouldst 
He would 
We would 
You would 
They would.
The first persons singular and plural in both tenses of 
the verbs No. 2.
and 3.
are necessarily the same, because 
the speaker and the party spoken of are one ; and there- 
fore No. 3.
may be said to have no first person.
The only 
apparent ambiguity lies between the second persons of 
No. 1.
and 3 ; but the verbs are so essentially distinct in 
sense, that this is never perceived even in writing ; and 
in conversation it is always avoided by the emphasis 
laid on No. 3.
An Englishman says to his friend, " I 
shall be very glad to see you : " not, like the Scotch and 
Irish, " I willhe very glad." The simple futurity only 
is here proper to be expressed, for an effort of implied 
volition destroys the civility.
It is no compliment to 
any one to say, " I will try to be glad to see you ;" and 
the expression itself is a solecism.
Writers on experi- 
mental philosophy in Scotland often say, "If we make 
such and such an experiment, we will find the result, &c," 
though they mean simple futurity, that the result will 
be so.
It is as ridiculous to say, " we will (that is, we 
are determined to) find the result so," as to say, "the 
result shall be so ;" or else to understand the verb No. 3.
instead of No. 1.
"the result will (or is in its own mind 
determined to) be so." A true English writer is so much 
VOL.
II.
2 F 
434 
on bis guard against the above error, that be sometimes 
falls into a contrary fault ; for instance, in a note of 
civility written, as usual, in the third person : — "Mr.
A. hoped to have sent Mr. B.
the promised books this 
morning, but is disappointed.
He trusts, however, that 
next week be shall have no difficulty in procuring them." 
The true meaning of which is, " he confidently thinks to 
himself, J shall have no difficulty in procuring the///." 
The writer could not so completely transform himself in 
idea into a third person, as to forget his own identity.
If he had wanted to say, " he trusts that his bookseller 
will have no difficulty in procuring them," the third per- 
son being evident, no doubt could have arisen in his 
mind.
Perhaps the use of the three verbs in question may 
be best illustrated by a familiar conversation between A., 
B., and C, in which each verb is numbered wherever it 
occurs.
A. I shall 1 fall clown the precipice if I go further in 
this slippery path.
If C.
goes on, be will 1 inevitably 
tumble, and so tvilt i thou.
We shall ' all break our necks.
I will* turn back.
B. We will" goon, and thou shalt" go with us, whe- 
ther thou wilt or not.
A. You will 1 both repent when too late, since you 
will 3 be so obstinate.
What perverseness !
They will 1 
suffer, and I shall 1 be blamed ; but their parents shall" 
know the truth.
I will* bear this no longer : you shall" 
both turn back.
I should 1 like to see you fall if I were 
sure you would 1 not hurt yourselves, and then you should* 
obey me whether you would 3 or not.
Your parents should* 
have sent some one with you that you would 5 have at- 
tended to ; but they would 3 not, even though I would* 
have had them.
They would 1 be very sorry to see what 
I see, and they would 3 be obeyed.
C. We would* obey thee if thou wouldst 3 but be less 
loquacious ; and whatever may happen, I insist that thou 
435 
skouldst* not blame us.
Thou wouldst ' be most to blame 
for alarming us.
We must not confound with the forepoino- verbs a 
fourth, should, as a sign of the potential mood, or, in 
other words, as expressing the possibility of simple futu- 
rity.
This is unchanged in all the persons, whether 
singular or plural.
— Thus C.
might proceed in the above 
conversation : 
C. If I should* fall, and thou shouldst* see me, and 
if B.
should* be unable to help me, we should 1 all lament 
our mishap.
If we should* be so unfortunate, and if you 
both should 4 go home without me, and if my parents 
should* be there, &c.
&c.
An apparent exception to the above rule occurs in 
scriptural language : "The Lord shall judge the world 
in righteousness." " The Lord shall reign for ever and 
ever," &c.
In such cases, though the fact ought, in 
ordinary language, to be announced as a matter of simple 
futurity, yet by a kind of poetical licence, the narrator 
assumes more than ordinary authority, which can only 
be expressed by the tone of decision or determination de- 
rived from inspiration itself.
We overlook the speaker 
or writer in the consideration of this all-commandinp; 
decision, proceeding from the fountain of unchangeable 
truth.
To reduce these sentences to grammatical exact- 
ness by substituting will for shall, as some injudicious 
and tasteless reformers of spiritual poetry have done, en- 
feebles their sentiment, without adding any thing to their 
precision, for they are used only on an occasion in which 
there is no possibility of mistake.
I cannot but esteem the irregularity of the verbs in 
question rather a beauty than a defect in our language.
No Englishman is puzzled in their use, because the rule 
above given is absolute.
Endless confusion arises from 
those who, not perceiving that rule, attempt to correct 
the language ; and the matter is only further obscured 
2 f 2 
43G 
by writers who, considering the whole but as one verb, 
explain it on false principles.

Ne sachant pas ce que Mr. Smith a deja dit de 
Haller dans son Voyage, je ne puis pas savoir non plus 
ce que je pourrai lui envoyer d'anecdotes sur ce grand 
homme; mais quand une fois la premiere edition de ses 
Voyages aura paru, il me sera plus facile de l'augmenter 
par des extraits de Zimmermann, ou par d'autres anec 
dotes.
Ce Zimmermann lorsqu'il a compose l'histoire de la 
vie de Haller, a ete si prodigieusement enthousiasme de 
son Mecene, qu'une fois le Docteur Langhannsde Berne, 
en presence de Mr. Sprungli le naturaliste, qui furent 
alors a Gottingue, osant dire que Mr. Haller n'etoit pas 
infaillible, et qu'il avoit aussi ses foiblesses, ce docteur 
a sur cela ete provoque en duel par Zimmermann.
Mr.
Sprungli m'a souvent raconte cette histoire, et jamais 
sans rire de tout son cceur.
Vous savez que j'ai vu, sur la fin de sa vie, Mr. Hal- 
ler presque tous les jours pendant pres de quatre mois.
II 
avoit un sommeil qui le persecutoit tous les jours d'abord 
apresmidi, ets'il s'y abandonnoit, il devenoit sombre vers 
le soir et melancholique, et alors il ne vouloit entendre 
parler que de religion, et preferoit en general les ecrits de 
St. Jean, dont il falloit toujours lui citer des passages.
Si au contraire on l'avoit empeche de dormir, et il prioit 
meme tous les assistants de le secouer, de le reveiller, 
alors il etoit calme, serein, tranquille, s'entretenoit avec 
plaisir de sciences, de nouvelles litteraires, et sa conver- 
sation etoit tres-interessante ; mais il revenoit cependant 
toujours a la religion, et me disoit souvent, " A-present, 
mon ami, quittons les bagatelles, le terns qu'il me reste 
439 
est trop court, il s'ecoule fort vite ; dites moi quelque 
chose de notre Sauveur, car il n'y a que lui qui puisse 
me sauver et rue rend re heureux." 
II me disoit souvent, "Je suis pourtant un etre bien mal- 
heureux, autrefois j'avois des idees si sublimes de l'eter- 
nite, je sentois si vivement le bonheur d'etre vertueux, 
j'avois tant d'enthousiasme pour ma religion; mais a- 
present je me sens si froid, si pesant, si indifferent, que 
cela m'attriste veritablement." Quand meme alors je 
disois a.
ce grand physiologiste, " Mais vous savez que 
vous n'etes plus dans Page ou vous avez pleure la mort 
de votre premiere femme : votre jeunesse, ou dans le 
Bremgarten vous avez compose votre poeme sur l'eter- 
nite, s'est ecoulee, vos forces ont diminue, votre corps est 
use." Cela ne le consoloit pas assez, et il ne vouloit 
jamais comprendre que son imagination et ses sentiments 
ne pouvoient plus etre aussi vifs que dans sa jeunesse.
Ce grand poete sur la fin de ses joUrs, pendant bien 
des mois, ne trouvoit de nourriture et de consolation que 
dans le simple E'vangile, dans les poesies les plus simples, 
et si je voulois 1'entretenir a son gre, il falloit lui parler 
de religion, comme j'en parle aux plus simples pay sans, 
aux enfants memes.
Quelques jours apres que l'Empereur fut chez lui, un 
bon ecclesiastique qui le voyoit souvent, et dont d'ailleurs 
il etoit tres-content, lui dit : " Mais, Monsieur !
jedoisa.
juste titre vous feliciter de l'honneur que l'Empereur vous 
a fait.
Cela doit vous soulager, vous faire grand plaisir." 
Haller n'y repondit rien pendant quelque tems, et apres 
quelques moments il regard a le pasteur, et lui dit en sou- 
riant, " Heureux ceux dont les noms sont inscrits au 
ciel," et des lors il ne fut plus question de l'Empereur.
Malgre cette facon de sentir, de penser, et d'agir, au 
milieu meme de ses douleurs continuelles, et voyant la 
mort s'approcher de fort pres, il lisoit egalement des 
romans, des brochures assez legeres, &c.
pour en faire 
des extraits et critiques pour la Gazette de Gottingue.
Je 
440 
lui reprochai cela une fois en lui disant, dans un acces 
qu'il avoit de melancholie, que j'etois fort etonne de le 
trouver si souvent occupe de pareilles bagatelles ; mais 
il me repondit sur le champ, "C'est mon metier, mon 
ami !
je fais cela pour le Journal de Gottingue, non pas 
pour m'en amuser." 
Ne pouvant etre un moment sans s'occuper et tra- 
vailler, et ne voulant pourtant pas abuser du Sabbath, — il 
s'occupoit ces jours a composer ses lettres sur la religion, 
et la refutation des ouvrages de Voltaire.
II est mort en observateur, en medecin.
J'etois le 
dernier jour de sa vie a la campagne ; il me fit faire plu- 
sieurs messages, que je ne scus malheureusement que 
le soir en revenant en ville.
J'y courus fort vite, mais 
je le trouvai deja mort depuis quelques moments.
Un 
ecclesiastique des plus respectables de notre ville lui avoit 
tenu la tete, et tout d'un coup Haller dit avec une cer- 
taine force, " Je meurs !
" et e'en etoit fait.
Le seul honneur qu'on a fait a Haller apres sa mort 
a. Berne, fut celui de placer son portrait dans la galerie 
ou sont nos avoyers, entre les deux avoyers regnants ; 
mais je crois qu'il doit cette distinction plutot aux sen- 
timens de Mr. Sinner, qui etoit alors bibliothecaire, qu'a 
un ordre souverain.
Vous verrez de tout ceci que je viens d'ecrire fort a la 
hate ce qu'il vous plaira !
Et disez a.
Mr. Smith que je 
me fais veritablement un plaisir de lui rendre quelque 
service ; ne pouvant pas lui fournir des decouvertes inter- 
essantes en botanique, je voudrois bien lui prouver par 
d'autres services que je l'estime infiniment.
Je viens de lire dans le Journal litteraire de Jena que 
quelqu'un s'est deja charge dela traduction des Voyages 
de Smith, ainsi que je puis esperer de les lire bientot.

A REVIEW OF THE MODERN STATE OF BOTANY, 
WITH A PARTICULAR REFERENCE TO THE NATURAL SYSTEMS OE 
LINNiEUS AND JUSSIEU*.
[" A Review of the modern State of Botany," mentioned Vol. i.
p. 49-i, not having been printed in the Transactions of the Lin- 
ncean Society, it may prove an acceptable addition to the present 
work to introduce this Essay, which from its situation in the 
Encyclopaedia Britannica, not being accessible to general readers, 
is given entire in this place.~\ 
THE Linnsean system of botany, the principles upon 
which it is founded, with its application to practice, have 
all been amply elucidated in the fourth volume of the 
Encyclopedia Britannica.
The reader will there find 
a general view of this celebrated system, including 
the generic characters, as well as some of the specific 
differences, of most plants hitherto discovered, with their 
qualities and uses.
The terminology of Linnseus is ex- 
plained ; his arguments for the existence of sexes in 
flowers are detailed ; his ideas of a natural method of 
classification, and of its utility in leading to a knowledge 
of the virtues of plants, are subjoined to a compendious 
history of botanical science.
< 
The writer of the present supplementary article pro- 
poses to take a different view of the subject.
This study 
has, within twenty or thirty years past, become so popular, 
and has been cultivated and considered in so many diffe- 
rent ways, that no dry systematic detail of classification 
or nomenclature is at all adequate to convey an idea of 
what botany, as a philosophical and practical pursuit, is 
now become.
The different modes in which different 
nations, or schools, have cultivated this science ; the cir-

cumstances which have led some botanists to the investi- 
gation of certain subjects more than others ; and the 
particular success of each; may prove an amusing and 
instructive object of contemplation.
In this detail, the 
history of scientific botany will appear under a new as- 
pect, as rather an account of what is doing, than what is 
accomplished.
The more abstruse principles of classifi- 
cation will be canvassed ; and the attention of the student 
may incidentally be recalled to such as have been neg- 
lected, or not sufficiently understood.
The natural and 
artificial methods of classification having been, contrary 
to the wise intention of the great man who first distin- 
guished them from each other, placed in opposition, and 
set at variance, it becomes necessary to investigate the 
pretensions of each.
The natural method of Linnaeus 
may thus be compared with his artificial one ; and as the 
competitors of the latter have long ceased to be more than 
objects of mere curiosity, we shall have occasion to show 
how much the rivals of the former are indebted to both.
In the progress of this inquiry, the writer, who has lived 
and studied among the chief of these botanical polemics, 
during a great part of their progress, may possibly find 
an occasional clue for his guidance, which their own 
works would not supply.
No one can more esteem their 
talents, their zeal, and the personal merits of the greater 
part, than the author of these pages ; but no one is more 
independent of theoretical opinions, or less dazzled by 
their splendour, even when they do not, as is too often 
the case, prove adverse to the discovery of truth.
Nor 
is he less anxious to avoid personal partiality.
Incorrup- 
tam jidem professis, nee amove quisquam, et sine odio, di- 
cendus est.
About the end of the seventeenth century, and the be- 
ginning of the eighteenth, the necessity of some botanical 
system, of arrangement as well as nomenclature, by which 
the cultivators of this pleasing science might understand 
each other, became every day more apparent.
Nor was 
443 
there any deficiency of zeal among the leaders and pro- 
fessors of this science.
Systems, and branches of systems, 
sprung up over the whole of this ample field, each aspi- 
ring to eminence and distinction above its neighbours.
Many of these, like the tares, that fell by the way side, 
soon withered for want of root ; others, like the herb a im- 
pia of the old herbalists, strove to overtop and stifle their 
parents ; and all armed themselves plentifully with thorns 
of offence, as well as defence, by which they hoped finally 
to prevail over their numerous competitors.
This state 
of scientific warfare did not, in the mean while, much pro- 
mote the actual knowledge of plants, though it prepared 
the way for a final distribution of the numerous acquisi- 
tions, which were daily making, by the more humble, 
though not less useful, tribe, of collectors and discoverers.
The success of the Linnsean artificial system is not alto- 
gether, perhaps, to be attributed to its simplicity and fa- 
cility ; nor even to the peculiar attention it commanded, 
by its connexion with the striking phaenomenon, brought 
into view at the same time, of the sexes of plants.
The in- 
sufficiency, or at least the nearly equal merits, of the many 
other similar schemes that had been proposed, began to 
be most strongly felt, just at the time, when the great 
progress and success of practical botany, rendered the 
necessity of a popular system most imperious.
While 
the cause of system was pending, some of the greatest 
cultivators of the science were obliged to have recourse 
to alphabetical arrangement.
This was the case with 
Dillenius, the man who alone, at the time when Linnseus 
visited England, was found by him attentive to, or capable 
of understanding, the sound principles of generic distinc- 
tion.
These he probably understood too well to presume 
to judge about universal classification.
It was the fashion 
of the time however for every tyro to begin with the lat- 
ter; and the garden of knowledge was consequently too 
long encumbered with abortive weeds.
Linnaeus had no sooner published and explained his 
444 
method of arranging plants, according to that which is 
generally termed ihe Sexual System, than it excited con- 
siderable attention.
His elegant and instructive Flora Lap- 
ponica could not be perused by the philosopher or the 
physician, without leading its readers occasionally aside, 
from the immediate objects of their inquiry, into the paths 
of botanical speculation, and awakening in many a curi- 
osity, hitherto dormant, on such subjects.
But the scope 
of that limited Flora is by no means sufficient to show 
either the necessity or the advantages of any mode of ar- 
rangement.
Linnaeus may be said to have grasped the 
botanical sceptre, when, in the year 1753, he published 
the first edition of his Species Plantarum; and the com- 
mencement of his reign must be dated from that period.
The application of his system to universally practice, in 
this compendious distribution of all the known vegetables 
of the globe ; his didactic precision ; his concise, clear, 
and certain style of discrimination ; his vast erudition dis- 
played in synonyms ; and, perhaps as much as any thing 
else, the fortunate invention of trivial or specific names, by 
which his nomenclature became as evidently commodious, 
and indeed necessarily popular, as any part of his per- 
formance ; all these causes co-operated to establish his 
authority.
An immediate impulse was given to practical 
botany.
The vegetable productions of various countries 
and districts were marshalled in due array, so as to be 
accessible and useful.
A common language was esta- 
blished throughout the world of science ; a common stock 
of knowledge and experience began to accumulate, which 
has ever since been increasing, and can now never be 
lost.
Of these partial Floras to which we allude, those of 
Lapland and Sweden, the productions of Linnaeus him- 
self, were the models of most of the rest, and have never, 
on the whole, been excelled.
Hence arose the Linnsean school of* botany, which 
though founded in Sweden, extended itself through Hol- 
land, Germany, and more or less perfectly in other parts 
445 
of Europe, though not without impediments of which we 
are hereafter to speak.
In Britain it was firmly esta- 
blished by the influence of some of the most able pupils 
of Linnaeus, and strengthened at length by the acquisition 
of his literary remains.
But these are adventitious sup- 
ports.
The strength of philosophical, like political, au- 
thority is in public opinion, and the cement of its power 
is public good.
As we proceed to trace the practical influence of the 
Linnaean system, or ratherof the facility which it afforded, 
in botanical studies, it will be useful at the same time to 
observe the effects of adventitious circumstances, which 
render botany almost a different sort of study in different 
parts of the habitable globe.
In those northern ungenial climates, where the intellect 
of man indeed has flourished in its highest pei'fection, but 
where the productions of nature are comparatively spa- 
ringly bestowed, her laws have been most investigated 
and best understood.
The appetite of her pupils was 
whetted by their danger of starvation, and the scantiness 
of her supplies trained them in habits of oeconomy, and of 
the most acute observation.
The more obvious natural 
productions of such climates are soon understood and 
exhausted.
But this very cause led Linnaeus to so minute 
a scrutiny of Swedish insects, as had never been under- 
taken before in any country ; in consequence of which a 
new world, as it were, opened to his contemplation, and 
the great Reaumur declared that Sweden was richer in this 
department than all the rest of the globe.
Such indeed 
was its appearance, because it had been more carefully 
examined.
When the ardour and acuteness of the pupils 
of the Linnaean school first sought matter of employment 
for their talents, some few had the means of visiting di- 
stant, and scarcely explored, countries ; but this could 
not be the lot of many.
The greater part were confined 
to their native soil ; and it is remarkable that those who 
were longest so confined, have displayed in the sequel the 
446 
greatest abilities, and have rendered the greatest services 
to science, independent of the accidents which made the 
labours of others imperfect or abortive.
Such men as 
Ehrhart and Swartz were not to be satisfied with the ge- 
neral productions of the fields or gardens to which they 
had access.
They had no resource but in the recondite 
mysteries of cryptogamic botany, in the first instance.
To these they directed their microscopic eyes, and more 
discriminating minds, with the happiest success.
When 
they had derived from hence an ample harvest, Ehrhart, 
limited in circumstances and opportunites, hindered more- 
over perhaps, in some degree, by a singularity and inde- 
pendence of character, not always favourable to worldly 
prosperity, opened to himself a new path.
The native 
trees of the north, and especially the hardy shrubs and 
arborescent plants of the gardens, had not, as he judi- 
ciously discovered, received that correct attention, even 
from his master Linnseus, which was requisite to make 
them clearly understood.
Difficulties attending the study 
of these plants, the various seasons in which they require 
to be repeatedly scrutinized, and the obscurity or minute- 
ness of the parts on which their differences depend, were 
by no means calculated to deter this laborious and accu- 
rate inquirer.
He submitted the supposed varieties of the 
shrubbery, the kitchen garden, and even of the parterre, 
to the same rigorous examination, and, for the most part, 
with the happiest success.
His discoveries have not re- 
ceived the notice they deserve, for his communications 
were deformed with asperity and pedantry, and he did 
not always keep in mind the concise and sober principles 
of definition, which his preceptor had both taught and 
practised, and to which he owed so large a share of his 
well-merited fame.
Ehrhart died prematurely ; but his 
name ought to be cherished among those whose talents 
have advanced science, and who loved Nature, for her 
own sake, with the most perfect disinterestedness.
The fate of Swartz has been far more propitious to 
447 
himself and to the literary world.
Having thrown more 
light upon the cryptogamic productions of Sweden and 
Lapland than they had previously received, and which 
has only been exceeded by the more recent discoveries of 
the unrivalled Wahlenberg, he undertook a botanical in- 
vestigation of the West Indies.
Carrying with him, to 
this promising field of inquiry, so great a store of zeal 
and practical experience, his harvest was such as might 
well be anticipated.
Whole tribes of vegetables, which 
the half-learned or half-experienced botanist, or the su- 
perficial gatherer of simples or flowers, had totally over- 
looked, now first became known to mankind.
Tropical 
climates were now found to be as rich as the chill forests 
and dells of the north, in the various beautiful tribes of 
mosses; and the blue mountains of Jamaica rivalled its 
most fertile groves and savannas in the beauty, variety 
and singularity of their vegetable stores.
Nor must we pass over unnoticed the discoveries of 
another illustrious disciple of Linnaeus, the celebrated 
Thunberg, who has, now for many years, filled the pro- 
fessorial chair of his master, with credit to himself and 
advantage to every branch of natural science.
The rare 
opportunity of examining the plants of Japan, and of 
studying at leisure the numerous and beautiful produc- 
tions of the Cape of Good Hope, as well as of some parts 
of India, have thrown in the way of Professor Thunberg 
a greater number of genera, if not species of plants, than 
has fallen to the lot of most learned botanists ; except 
only those who have gone round the world, or beheld the 
novel scenes of New Holland.
These treasures he has 
contemplated and illustrated with great advantage, so far 
as he has confined himself to practical botany.
We lament 
that he ever stepped aside to attempt any reformation of 
an artificial system.
It is painful to complain of the 
well-meant, though mistaken endeavours of so amiable 
and candid a veteran in our favourite science ; but what 
we conceive to be the interests of that science must form 
448 
our apology.
We cannot but be convinced, and the ex- 
perience of others is on our side, that discarding those 
principles of the Linneean system which are derived from 
the situation of the several organs of impregnation, and 
making number paramount, has the most pernicious and 
inconvenient effect in most respects, without being advan- 
tageous in any.
This measure neither renders the system 
more easy, nor more natural, but for the most part the 
reverse of both.
We have elsewhere observed, (Intro- 
duction to Botany, ed.
3. 358,) that the amentaceous 
plants are of all others most uncertain in the number of 
their stamens, of which Linnaeus could not but be aware.
" Even the species of the same genus, as well as indivi- 
duals of each species, differ among themselves.
How un- 
wise and unscientific then is it, to take as a primary mark 
of discrimination, what nature has evidently made of less 
consequence here than in any other case !
" When such 
plants are, in the first place, set apart and distinguished, 
by their monoecious or dioecious structure, which is liable 
to so little objection or difficulty, their uncertainty with 
respect to the secondary character is of little moment ; 
their genera being few, and the orders of each class widely 
constructed as to number of stamens.
Linnasus, doubt- 
less, would have been glad to have preserved, if possible, 
the uniformity and simplicity of his plan ; but if he found 
it impracticable, who shall correct him ?
Such an attempt 
is too like the entomological scheme of the otherwise in- 
genious and able Fabricius.
The great preceptor having 
arranged the larger tribes of animals by the organs with 
which they take their various food, and which are there- 
fore accommodated to their several wants, and indicative 
of even their mental, as well as constitutional, characters, 
Fabricius his pupil would necessarily extend this system 
to insects.
But nothing can be more misapplied.
Feed- 
ing is not the business of perfect insects.
Many of them 
never eat at all, the business of their existence through 
the whole of their perfect state, being the propagation of 
449 
their species.
Hence the organs of their mouth lead to 
no natural distinctions, and the characters deduced there- 
from prove, moreover, so difficult, that it is notorious they 
could not generally be applied to practice by Fabricius 
himself, he having, in the common course of his studies, 
been chiefly regulated by the external appearance of the 
insects he described.
This external appearance depend- 
ing on the form and texture of their wings, and the shape 
of their own peculiar organs, the antennce, affords in fact 
the easiest, as well as the most natural, clue to their ar- 
rangement and discrimination.
As we presume to criticize the systematic errors of 
great practical observers, it cannot but occur to our recol- 
lection how very few persons have excelled in both these 
departments.
Ray, Linnaeus, and perhaps Tournefort, 
may be allowed this distinction.
We can scarcely add a 
fourth name to this brief catalogue.
The most excellent 
practical botanists of the Linnsean school have been such 
as hardly bestowed a thought on the framing of systems.
Such was the distinguished Solander, who rivalled his 
preceptor in acuteness of discrimination, and even in pre- 
cision and elegance of definition.
Such is another emi- 
nent man, more extensively conversant with plants, more 
accurate in distinguishing, and more ready in recollecting 
them, than almost any other person with whom we have 
associated.
Yet we have heard this great botanist declare, 
that however he might confide in his own judgement with 
regard to a species, or a genus of plants, he pretended to 
form no opinion of classes and orders.
Men of so much 
experience know too much to be satisfied with their ac- 
quirements, or to draw extensive conclusions from what 
they think insufficient premises.
Others, with a quarter 
of their knowledge, find no difficulty in building systems, 
and proceed with great alacrity, till they find themselves 
encumbered with their own rubbish; happy if their doubts 
and uncertainties will afford them a tolerable screen or 
shelter !
But we here anticipate remarks, which will come 
VOL.

with more propriety hereafter.
We return from the con- 
sideration of the labours of particular botanists, to that of 
the diversities of nature and circumstance.
While it is remarked that in the cold regions of the 
north, the skill of the deep and learned botanist is chiefly 
exercised on the minute and intricate cryptogamic tribes, 
we are not to infer that Nature is not everywhere rich in 
beauty and variety.
Mosses and Lichens afford inex- 
haustible amusement and admiration to the curious inqui- 
rer, nor are more gorgeous productions entirely wanting.
Even Lapland boasts her Pedicularis Sceptrum, never seen 
alive out of her limits, and Siberia offers her own beauti- 
ful crimson Cypripedium, to console for a moment the mi- 
serable banished victims of imperial caprice.
Kotzebue, 
though ignorant of botany, did not pass this lovely plant 
unnoticed, even in the height of his distress.
The au- 
thoress of the pleasing little novel called " Elizabeth," 
has represented in a just light the botanic scenery of that 
otherwise inhospitable country ; yet it must be allowed 
that its rarities are not numerous, except perhaps in those 
microscopic tribes already mentioned.
Let us in imagination traverse the globe, to a country 
where the very reverse is the case.
From the represen- 
tations, or accounts, that have been given of New Hol- 
land, it seems no very beautiful or picturesque country, 
such as is likely to form or to inspire a poet.
Indeed the 
dregs of the community which we have poured out upon 
its shores, must probably subside, and purge themselves, 
before any thing like a poet, or a disinterested lover of na- 
ture, can arise from so foul a source.
There seems how- 
ever to be no transition of seasons, in the climate itself, to 
excite hope, or to expand the heart and fancy; like a 
Siberian or Alpine spring, bursting at once from the icy 
fetters of a sublime though awful winter.
Yet in New 
Holland all is new and wonderful to the botanist.
The 
most common plants there are unlike every thingknown be- 
fore; and those which, at first sight, look like old acquain- 
451 
tances, are found, on a near approach, to be strangers, 
speaking a different language from what he has been used 
to, and not to be trusted without a minute inquiry at every 
step.
The botany of the Cape of Good Hope, so well illus- 
trated byThunberg, and with whose treasures he scattered, 
a charm around the couch of the dying Linnaeus, most 
resembles that of New Holland.
At least these countries 
agree in the hard, rigid, dwarfish character of their plants.
But the Cape has the advantage in general beauty of 
flowers, as well as in a transition of seasons.
After the 
dry time of the year, when every thing but the Aloe and 
Mesembryanthemum tribes is burnt up, and during which 
innumerable bulbs are scattered by the winds and driving 
sands over the face of the country, the succeeding showers 
raise up a new and most beautiful progeny from those 
bulbs.
The families of Ii ia, Gladiolus, his, Aittholyza, 
Oxalis, and many others, then appear in all their splen- 
dour.
Some of them, the least gaudy, scent the evening 
air with an unrivalled perfume, whilst others dazzle the 
beholder with the most vivid scarlet or crimson hues, as 
they welcome the morning sun.
The lovely Floras of the Alps and the Tropics contend, 
perhaps most powerfully, for the admiration of a botanist 
of taste, who is a genuine lover of nature, without which 
feeling, in some degree of perfection, even botany can 
but feebly charm.
Of one of these the writer can speak 
from experience ; of the other only by report ; but he 
has had frequent opportunities of remarking, that the 
greatest enthusiasts in the science have been Alpine bo- 
tanists.
The expressions of Haller and Scopoli on this 
subject go to the heart.
The air, the climate, the charms 
of animal existence in its highest perfection, are associ- 
ated with our delight in the beauty and profusion of na- 
ture.
In hot climates, the insupportable languor, the 
difficulty of bodily exertion, the usual ill health, and the 
effects of unwholesome instead of salutary fatigue, are 
2 o 2 
452 
described as sufficient to counterbalance even the pleasure 
which arises from the boundless variety, and infinite 
beauty, of the creation around.
The flowery trees of a 
tropical forest raise themselves far above the human 
grasp.
They must be felled before we can gather their 
blossoms.
The insidious and mortal reptile twines among 
their boughs, and the venomous insect stings beneath 
their shade.
We who enjoy the productions of these cli- 
mates in peace and safety in our gardens, may well ac- 
knowledge our obligations to the labour and zeal of those 
who, by arduous journeys and painful researches, supply 
us with the riches of every country in succession.
We 
do not, indeed, enjoy them in perfection ; but we can 
study and investigate at leisure their various beauties and 
distinctions.
We can compare them with our books, 
and profit by the acuteness of former observers.
We can 
perpetuate, by the help of the pencil or the pen, whatever 
is novel or curious.
We can preserve the plants and 
flowers themselves for subsequent examination, and re- 
turn to them again and again in our closet, when winter 
has fixed his seal on all the instruction and pleasure af- 
forded by the vegetable creation abroad.
Yet let not the 
sedentary botanist exult in his riches, or rejoice too heed- 
lessly in the abundance of his resources.
A plant ga- 
thered in its native soil, and ascertained by methodical 
examination, is more impressed on the memory, as well 
as more dear to the imagination, than many that are ac- 
quired with ease, and named by tradition or report.
The 
labours of its acquisition and determination enhance its 
value, and the accompaniments of delightful scenery, or 
pleasing society, are recollected, when difficulties and 
toils are forgotten.
The western continent is, with respect to botany, al- 
most a world in itself.
There exists, indeed, a general 
affinity between the plants of North America and those 
of Europe, and many species of the arctic regions are the 
same in both ; but there are few common to the more 
453 
temperate climates of each.
A considerable number 
communicated by Kalm to Linnaeus, which the latter 
considered as identified with certain well-known plants 
of our quarter of the world, prove, on more accurate ex- 
amination, to be corresponding, but distinct species.
In- 
stances occur in the genera of Carpinus, Corylus, Quer- 
cus, as well as in the Orchis tribe, and others.
These 
points of resemblance are found mostly among the vege- 
table productions of the eastern regions of North America.
Mexico, and what little we know of the intermediate 
space, abound with different and peculiar productions.
So, in South America ; Peru, Guiana, Brasil, 8tc.
have 
all their appropriate plants, of which we know as yet 
enough to excite our curiosity, rather than to satisfy it.
Whatever has hitherto been given to the world respecting 
American botany has had one considerable advantage.
Each Flora has been founded on the knowledge and ex- 
perience of some one or more persons, long resident, and 
in a manner naturalized, in the countries illustrated.
Those 
regions commonly comprehended under the name of 
North America, have afforded materials for the Flora 
Boreali- Americana of Michaux, and the more complete 
and correct Flora America Septentrionalis of Pursh.
Mi- 
chaux, Wangenheim, and Marshall, have particularly il- 
lustrated the trees of those countries.
But all these 
works have been enriched by the communications and 
assistance of men who had much more extensive and re- 
peated opportunities of observation than their authors, 
except Mr. Marshall, could have.
Such are the vene- 
rable John Bartram, the Reverend Dr. Muhlenberg, 
Messrs.
Clayton, Walter, Lyon, &c.
The Mexican Flora 
has received, for a long course of years, the attention of 
the able and learned Mutis, who long corresponded with 
Linnaeus, and whose countrymen have prepared the sump- 
tuous Flora Peruviana ; each of the authors of which 
has repeatedly traversed, at various seasons, the rich and 
interesting regions, whose botanical treasures make so 
454 
splendid and novel an appearance in those volumes.
Of 
those treasures, we have still more to learn from the un- 
rivalled Humboldt.
The French botanist Aublet, after 
having gained considerable experience in the Mauritius, 
resided for many years in Cayenne and Guiana, for the 
purpose of studying the plants of those countries, of which 
his work, in four quarto volumes, gives so ample a history 
and representation.
All the writers just named have been practical bota- 
nists.
They have generally excelled in specific discri- 
mination, nor have they neglected the study of generic 
distinctions.
Any thing further they have scarcely at- 
tempted.
It is remarkable that they have all followed, 
not only the Linnsean principles of definition and nomen- 
clature, but the Linnsean artificial system of classification.
This same system was chosen by the veteran Jacquin, in 
his well-known work on West Indian plants, entitled 
Stirpium Americanarum Historia, as well as by Browne, 
in his History of Jamaica-, not to mention Swartz, in his 
Flora India, Occidenta/is, who only wanders a little out 
of the way, to adopt some of Thunberg's alterations.
We cannot but observe, that in the very department of 
botany in which he has most signalized himself, and with 
which he is most philosophically conversant, the Orchi- 
decB, he totally rejects the ideas of Thunberg.
If we now turn our eyes to the oriental world, we shall 
find that the seeds of Linnsean botany, sown by Koenig, 
have sprung up and produced successive harvests among 
the pious missionaries at Tranquebar, who still continue 
to interweave a sprig of science, from time to time, among 
their amaranthine wreaths, which are not of this world.
India too has long possessed a practical botanist of inde- 
fatigable exertion and ardour, who has thrown more light 
upon its vegetable riches, with the important subject of 
their qualities and uses, than any one since the days of 
Rheede and Rumphius.
It is scarcely necessary to name 
Dr. Roxburgh, whose recent loss we deeply lament, and 
455 
whose acquisitions and learned remarks are given to the 
world by the munificence of the East India Company, in 
a style which no prince has ever rivalled.
That enthusi- 
astic admirer of nature, Colonel Hardwicke, and the 
learned botanist Dr. Francis Buchanan, have also contri- 
buted greatly to increase our knowledge of Indian botany.
The latter has enjoyed the advantage of investigating, for 
the first time, the remote and singular country of Nepaul; 
so prolific in beautiful and uncommon plants, that few 
parts of the world can exceed it, and yet meeting, in se- 
veral points, not only the Floras of the lower regions and 
islands of India, but those of Japan, China, and even 
Siberia.
The only systematic work on East Indian plants, 
is the Flora Indica of Burmann, which is classed ac- 
cording to the Linnsean artificial method.
We cannot 
but wish it were more worthy of the system or the sub- 
ject; yet, as a first attempt, it deserves our thanks.
In 
speaking of Indian botany, shall we withhold our homage 
from that great and sublime genius Sir William Jones ?
who honoured this study with his cultivation, and, like 
every thing else that he touched, refined, elevated, and 
elucidated it, with a beam of more than mortal radiance.
No man was ever more truly sensible of the charms of 
this innocent and elegant pursuit ; and whenever he ad- 
verted to it, all the luminous illustrations of learning, and 
even the magic graces of poetry, flowed from his pen.
But we must extend ourview beyond the utmost bounds 
of India, and of the then discovered world, to trace the 
steps of those adventurous circumnavigators who sought 
out, not only new plants, but new countries, for botanical 
examination.
The names of Banks and Solander have, 
for nearly half a century, been in every body's mouth.
Their taste, their knowledge, their liberality, have diffused 
a charm and' a popularity over all their pursuits ; and 
those who never heard of botany before, have learned to 
consider it with respect and admiration, as the object to 
which a man of rank, riches, and talents, devotes his life 
456 
and his fortune ; who while he adds, every season, some- 
thing of novelty and beauty to our gardens, has given the 
Bread-fruit to the West Indies, and is ever on the watch 
to prompt, or to further, any scheme of public advantage.
With the recollection of such men must also be associated 
the names of the learned Forsters, father and son, of 
Sparrmann, and of Menzies, who have all accomplished 
the same perilous course, and enriched their beloved 
science.
The cryptogamic acquisitions of the latter in 
New Zealand, prove him to have attended to that branch 
of botany with extraordinary success, and at the same 
time evince the riches of that remote country.
Indeed, 
it appears that any country proves rich, under the inspec- 
tion of a sufficiently careful investigator.
The labours of 
these botanists have all been conducted according- to the 
principles and classification of Linnseus.
Forster, under 
Sparrinann's auspices, has judiciously pointed out, and 
attempted to remedy, defects that their peculiar opportu- 
nities enabled them to discover, but with no invidious 
aim.
They laboured, not to overthrow or undermine a 
system, which they found on the whole to answer the pur- 
pose of readily communicating their discoveries, but to 
correct and strengthen it for the advantage of those who 
might come after them.
It is much to be lamented that, 
except the Nova Genera Plant arum, we have as yet so 
short and compendious an account of the acquisitions 
made in their voyage.
To the technical history of these, 
however, the younger Forster has commendably added 
whatever he could supply of practical utility, and has thus 
given us all the information within the compass of his 
means.
Long since the voyages of these celebrated naturalists, 
the same remote countries have been visited, in our own 
days, by two learned botanists more especially; these are 
M. La Billardiere, and Mr. Brown, Librarian of the Lin- 
naean Society.
The former has published an account of 
the Plants of New Holland, in two volumes folio, with fine 
457 
engravings ; the latter has favoured the botanical world 
with one volume of a most acute and learned Prodromus 
of his discoveries.
As his voyage was made at the public 
expense, we may trust that the government will consider 
itself bound to enable him to publish the whole of his ac- 
quisitions, in such a manner as to be generally useful.
His 
own accuracy of observation, illustrated by the drawings 
of the inimitable Bauer, cannot fail to produce such a 
work as, we will venture to pronounce, has never been 
equalled.
M. La Billardiere has disposed his book ac- 
cording to the system of Linnaeus, a rare example in 
France, where any thing not French usually comes but ill 
recommended.
Mr. Brown, on the other hand, has writ- 
ten his Prodromus, at least, on the principles of classifi- 
cation established by the celebrated Jussieu, the great 
champion of a natural system of his own.
On this subject 
we postpone our remarks for the present.
Before we can 
enter on the subject of natural classification, it is neces- 
sary to consider the state and progress of botany, for some 
years past, in the schools, and among the writers, of 
Europe.
Sweden has continued to maintain her long established 
rank in the several departments of natural science, nor has 
Denmark been behind-hand with her neighbour and an- 
cient rival.
The son and successor of the great Linnseus 
endeavoured to follow his father's steps, and was ambitious 
of not being left very far in the rear; a commendable aim, 
which his short life, to say nothing of his talents or expe- 
rience, disabled him from accomplishing.
He completed, 
and gave to the world, the unfinished materials which his 
father had left, for a Supplement to his Species Plantarum 
and Mantissa, ; and having enriched the book with many 
communications of Thunberg and others, as well as a 
number of original remarks, he felt a strong desire, not 
altogether unpardonable, of being thought the principal 
author of the work.
All uncertainty on this subject, 
wherever other helps fail, is removed by the original ma- 
458 
nuscript of the Supplementum Plant drum in our posses- 
sion.
Ehrhart superintended the printing of this work, 
and made some alterations in the manuscript, traces of 
which are perceptible in the affected Greek names, given 
to some species of Carex, Mespifus, &c, as well as in 
their sesquipedalian specific characters.
But he had intro- 
duced his own new genera of Mosses; which the younger 
Linnaeus thought so alarming an innovation, that he or- 
dered the sheet which contained these matters to be can- 
celled.
We are possessed of a copy, which shows the 
genera in question to be almost all well founded, and 
what are now, under Hedwig's sanction, generally received, 
though by other names.
The descriptions of Ehrhart are 
precise and correct, though his terminology is exception- 
able, full of innovations, and crabbed expressions.
Two 
years, almost immediately preceding the death of the 
younger Linnaeus, were spent by the latter in visiting En- 
gland, France and Holland, and were employed to very 
great advantage, in augmenting his collection of natural 
productions, as well as his scientific skill.
During this 
tour, he attached himself strongly, through the medium 
of his old friend Solander, to Sir Joseph Banks ; and 
while in France, he almost planted, or at least greatly ad- 
vanced, a Linnaean school in that kingdom.
He had 
scarcely resumed his professorial office at home, when he 
was unexpectedly taken off, by an acute disease, in his 
forty-second year.
Of the talents and performances of 
his successor Thunberg, who still with honour fills the 
chair of the Rudbecks and the Linnaei, we have already 
spoken.
Dr. Swartz is the Bergian professor of Botany 
at Stockholm.
The Transactions of the Upsal Academy, 
founded by the younger Rudbeck, are continued occa- 
sionally ; and those of the Stockholm one, whose founda- 
tions were laid by Linnaeus, are published regularly.
Both 
are from time to time enriched with botanical communi- 
cations, worthy of the pupils of so illustrious a school.
A 
veteran in botanical science, Professor Retzius, still pre- 
459 
sides at the University of Lund.
The worthy and accu- 
rate Afzelius, well known in England, who accomplished 
a hazardous botanical expedition to Sierra Leone, is the 
coadjutor of Professor Thunberg ; and the difficult sub- 
ject of Lichens, under the hands of Dr. Acharius, is be- 
come so vast and so diversified, as to be almost a science 
of itself.
Denmark has always possessed some acute and learned 
botanists, and has, more than most other countries, been 
supplied with dried specimens of plants, as an article of 
commerce, from her West or East Indian establishments.
Oeder, the original author of the Flora Danica, and Mul- 
ler its continuator, have distinguished themselves ; but 
their fame is inferior to that of the late Professor Vahl, 
who studied under the celebrated Linnaeus, and who is the 
author of several excellent descriptive works.
He under- 
took no less than a new Species, or, as "he entitled it, 
Enumeratio, Plant arum, an admirable performance, cut 
short by his death at the end of the second volume, which 
finishes the class and order Triandria Monogynia.
It is 
almost superfluous to mention, that Afzelius and Retzius, 
as well as Vahl, in all they have given to the world, have 
followed the system of their great master.
The Flora 
Danica, chiefly a collection of plates, with few synonyms 
and no descriptions, has come forth, from time to time, 
for above fifty years past, in fasciculi, without any order, 
and is still incomplete.
It was undertaken by royal com- 
mand, and, in a great measure, at the sovereign's expense; 
though regularly sold, except some copies presented to 
certain distinguished men, as Linnaeus.
After the example of Denmark, Sweden, &c.
Russia 
has been desirous of promoting, throughout its vast de- 
pendencies, an attention to natural knowledge.
Nor 
was any country ever more fortunate in the possession of 
an active and intelligent naturalist.
The celebrated 
Pallas successfully devoted a long life to these pursuits, 
and to the communication of his discoveries and obser- 
460 
vations.
He prompted the Empress Catherine to offer 
an unlimited sum for the museum, library, and manu- 
scripts of Linnaeus ; but, fortunately for their present 
possessor, the offer was made too late.
A Flora Rossica, 
on the most magnificent scale, was undertaken by Pallas, 
his Imperial mistress proposing to defray the cost of the 
whole undertaking, not merely for sale, but for gratui- 
tous presentation, on the most princely scale, to all who 
had any taste or ability to make use of the book.
This 
well-intended munificence was the cause of the ruin of 
the project.
Half of a first volume was bestowed as the 
Empress intended.
But the second part, instead of fol- 
lowing the destination of the first, got into the hands of 
interested people, who defeated the liberal designs of 
their sovereign, misapplied her money, and by the dis- 
gust and disappointment which ensued, prevented the 
continuance of the work.
Those who wished to com- 
plete their sets, or to obtain the book at all, were obliged 
to become clandestine purchasers, buying, as a favour, 
what they ought to have received as a free gift ; and 
were moreover, like the writer of this, often obliged to 
put up with imperfect copies.
In like manner, the in- 
tentions of the great Mr. Howard, respecting his book 
on Prisons, were rendered ineffectual, by the disgrace- 
ful avarice of certain London booksellers, who immedi- 
ately bought up, and sold at a greatly advanced price, 
the whole edition, which its benevolent author had de- 
stined to be accessible to every body at an unusually 
cheap rate.
These examples, amongst others, show that 
it is the most difficult thing in the world to employ pa- 
tronage, as well as gratuitous charity of any kind, to real 
advantage, except under the guidance of the most rigo- 
rous discretion.
" All that men of power can do for 
men of genius," says Gray, if we recollect aright, "is to 
leave them at liberty, or they become like birds in a cage," 
whose song is no longer that of nature and enjoyment.
The great and the affluent may foster and encourage 
461 
science and literature, by their countenance, their at- 
tention, and a free, not overwhelming, liberality.
But 
when princes become publishers of books, or directors 
of academies, they generally do more harm than good.
They descend from their station, and lose sight perhaps 
of their higher and peculiar duties, which consist in pro- 
moting the general prosperity, peace, and liberty of their 
subjects, under the benign influence of which, every art, 
science, or pursuit, that can be beneficial to mankind, is 
sure to flourish without much gratuitous assistance.
Several of the immediate scholars of the illustrious 
Swedish naturalist were planted in different parts of Ger- 
many.
Murray, to whom he entrusted the publication 
of that compendious volume, entitled, Systema Vegeta- 
bilium, and who printed two successive editions of the 
work, was seated as Professor at Gbttingen.
Giseke 
was established at Hamburgh, and, after the death of 
Linnaeus, gave to the world such an edition as he was 
able to compile, from his own notes and those of Fabri- 
cius, of the lectures of their late preceptor, on the Natu- 
ral Orders of Plants.
His ideas on this subject Linnaeus 
himself always considered as tooimperfect to be published, 
except in the form of a sketch or index, at the end of his 
Genera Plantarum.
The venerable patriarch, Professor 
Jacquin, still survives at Vienna, where he, and his wor- 
thy son, have eniiched botany with a number of splendid 
and useful works.
They have given to the public seve- 
ral labours of the excellent practical botanist Wulfen, and 
others, which might, but for their encouragement, have 
been lost.
The highly valuable publication of Host on 
Grasses, is conducted on the planof Jacquin's works.
His 
Synopsis of Austrian plants is an excellent Flora, dis- 
posed according to the Sexual System, as is the more 
ample Tent amen Flora Germanica of the celebrated Dr.
Roth, one of the best practical European botanists, and 
more deeply versed than most others in cryptogamic lore.
The best Linnaean Flora, as far as it goes, that the world 
4(52 
has yet seen, — we speak it without any exception, — is the 
Flora Germanica of Professor Schrader of Gbttingen, the 
first volume of which, comprising the first three classes 
of the sexual system, was published in 1806.
The cor- 
rect distinctions, well-digested synonyms, and complete 
descriptions of this work, are altogether unrivalled.
If 
the whole should be equally well executed, for which the 
longest life would be scarcely sufficient, it must ever be 
the standard book of European botany.
Its descrip- 
tions of grasses are worthy to accompany the exquisite 
engravings of the same tribe from the hand of Leers, 
published at Herborn in 1775, which excel every other 
botanical representation that we have examined.
They 
will bear, and indeed they require, the application of a 
magnifying-glass, like the plants themselves.
The pur- 
chaser of this little volume must however beware of the 
second edition, whose plates are good for little or nothing.
The name of Schrader has long: been distinguished in 
Cryptogamic Botany.
In this pursuit, the industrious 
and accurate botanists of Germany, shut out from exten- 
sive opportunities of studying exotic plants, have had 
full scope for their zeal and abilities.
In this field the 
Leipsic school has distinguished itself.
Here the great 
Schreber first began his career with some of the most 
perfect, cryptogamic works, especially on the minute ge- 
nus Phascum.
Here the same author published his ex- 
cellent Flora Lipsiensis, his laborious practical work on 
Grasses, and finally his improved edition of the Genera 
Plantarum of his friend Linnseus.
But, above all, Leip- 
sic is famous for being the residence of Hedwig, whose 
discoveries, relative to the fructification and generic cha- 
racters of Mosses, form an aera in botanic science.
Under 
the hands of such an observer, that elegant tribe dis- 
plays itself with a degree of beauty, variety, and singu- 
larity, which vies with the most admired herbs and flow- 
el's, and confirms the Linnaean doctrine of impregnation, 
which the more obvious organs of the latter had originally 
4G3 
taught.
Nor must we, in speaking of cryptogamic 
plants, neglect here to record the names of Weis, Weber, 
Mohr, Schmidel, Esper, and especially Hoffmann ; the 
plates of the latter, illustrating the Lichen tribe, are 
models of beauty and correctness.
His Flor a Germanica 
is a most convenient and compendious manual, after the 
Linnaean system.
Fungi have been studied in Germany 
with peculiar care and minuteness.
The leading syste- 
matic author in this obscure tribe, Persoon, was indeed 
born, of Dutch parents, at the Cape of Good Hope ; but 
he studied and published at Gbttingen.
Two writers, of 
the name of Albertini and Schweiniz, have published the 
most minute and accurate exemplification of this natural 
order, in an octavo volume, at Leipsic, in the year 1805, 
comprising the Fungi of the district of Nisid in Upper 
Lusatia.
If their figures are less exquisitely finished 
than Persoon's, or less elaborately detailed than Schra- 
der's, their descriptions make ample amends.
The German school of botany has, for a long period, 
been almost completely Linnaean.
This however was not 
always the case, for, in the earlier part of his career, the 
learned Swede was attacked more repeatedly and severely 
from this quarter of the world than any other ; his ridi- 
culous critic Siegesbeck of Petersburgh excepted, who 
would not admit the doctrine of the sexes of plants, be- 
cause the pollen of one flower may fly upon another, and 
his purity could not bear the idea of such adultery in 
Nature.
Numerous methods of arrangement appeared 
in Germany, from the pens of Heister, Ludwig, Haller, 
and others, and even Schreber adopted a system like some 
of these in his Flora above mentioned.
It would be to 
no purpose now to criticize these attempts.
They cannot 
rank as natural systems, nor have they the convenience of 
artificial ones.
Part of their principles are derived from 
Linnaeus, others from Rivinus.
Their authors were not 
extensively conversant with plants, nor trained in any 
sound principles of generic discrimination or combination.
464 
They set off with alacrity, but were soon entangled in 
their own difficulties, and were left by Linnaeus to answer 
themselves or each other.
We here mention these learned 
systematics, for learned they were thought by themselves 
and their pupils, merely because they will scarcely require 
animadversion, when we come to canvass the great ques- 
tion of natural and artificial classification, they having had 
no distinct ideas of a difference between the two.
Hedwig 
used frequently to lament, that his preceptor Ludwig had 
never perfected his system of arrangement; but from 
what he has given to the world, we see no great room to 
suppose he had any thing very excellent in reserve.
Un- 
executed projects are magnified in the mists of uncer- 
tainty.
We have ventured elsewhere, in a biographical 
account of Hedwig, to remark, that even that ingenious 
man " did not imbibe under Ludwig, anything of the true 
philosophical principles of arrangement, the talents for 
which are granted to very few, and are scarcely ever of 
German growth.
We mean no invidious reflections on 
any nation or people.
Each has its appropriate merits, 
and all are useful together in science, like different cha- 
racters on the theatre of human life." 
Germany may well dispense with any laurels obtained 
by the very secondary merit of speculative schemes of 
classification, when she can claim the honour of having 
produced such a practical observer as Gaertner.
This in- 
defatigable botanist devoted himself to the investigation 
of the fruits and seeds of plants.
Being eminently skilled 
in the use of the pencil, he has, like Hedwig, faithfully 
recorded, what he no less acutely detected.
The path he 
struck out for himself, of delineating and describing in 
detail, with magnified dissections, every part of the seed 
and seed-vessel of each genus within his reach, had never 
been explored before in so regular and methodical a man- 
ner.
Botanists of the Linnaean school are justly cen- 
surable for having paid too little attention to the structure 
of these important parts, in their generic characters.
In- 
465 
deed it may be said, that if they were able to establish 
good genera without them, and, after the example of their 
leader, merely preferred the more obvious and distinct or- 
gans, when sufficient for their purpose, their conduct was 
justifiable.
If generic principles be natural and certain, 
it matters not on what parts of the fructification they are 
founded; nor is the inflorescence, or even the herb or 
root, rejected by sound philosophers, but because they 
are found to lead only to unnatural and uncertain charac- 
ters.
It is therefore extremely to the honour of Linnaeus, 
Gaertner, and Jussieu, that their conceptions of genera are 
almost entirely the same.
They meet in almost every 
point, however different the paths by which they pursue 
their inquiries.
Their labours illustrate and confirm each 
other.
Even Tournefort, who conceived so well, on the 
whole, the distinctions of genera, which he could but ill 
define, receives new strength from their knowledge, which 
does not overturn his imperfect performances, but improves 
them.
The accurate student of natural genera cannot 
fail to perceive, that where Gaertner differs from Linnaeus, 
which is but in a very few material instances, such as his 
numerous subdivision of the genus Fumaria, and his dis- 
tribution of the compound flowers, it arises from his too 
intent and exclusive consideration of one part of the fruc- 
tification, instead of an enlarged and comprehensive view 
of the whole.
In other words, he neglects the Linnaean 
maxim, that " the genus should give the character, not the 
character the genus." Such at least appears to us the 
case in Fumaria.
In the syngenesious family, being so 
very natural in itself, the discrimination of natural genera 
becomes in consequence so difficult, that Gaertner and 
Linnaeus may well be excused if they do not entirely 
agree, and they perhaps may both be satisfied with the 
honour of having collected materials, and disposed them 
in different points of view, for the use of some future sy- 
stematic, who may decide between them.
However exact 
Gaertner may have been in discriminating the parts of 
VOL.

seeds, we believe him mistaken in distinguishing the vi- 
tellus as a separate organ, distinct in functions from the 
cotyledons.
His readers will also do well, while they 
profit by his generally excellent principles, not to admit 
any of his rules as absolute.
They may serve as a clue to 
the intricacies of Nature, but they must not overrule her 
laws.
Still less is our great carpologist to be implicitly 
followed in physiological doctrines or reasonings ; witness 
his feeble and incorrect attack on Hed wig's opinions, or 
rather demonstrations, respecting the impregnation of 
Mosses.
His criticisms of Linnaeus are not always marked 
with that candour which becomes a disinterested lover of 
truth and nature, nor can we applaud in general his 
changes of nomenclature, or of terminology ; especially 
when he unphilosophically calls the germen of Linnaeus, 
the ovarium, a word long ago rejected, as erroneous when 
applied to plants.
These however are slight blemishes, 
in a reputation which will last as long as scientific botany 
is cultivated at all.
Botanists can now no longer neglect, 
but at their own peril, the parts which Gaertnerhas called 
into notice, and to the scrutiny of which, directed by his 
faithful guidance, the physiologist and the systematic 
must often, in future, recur.
We shall close this part of our subject with the men- 
tion of the Berlin school, where Gleditsch, who, in 1740, 
repelled the attacks of Siegesbeck on Linnaeus, was Pro- 
fessor, and published a botanical system, founded on the 
situation, or insertion, of the stamens ; the subordinate 
divisions being taken from the number of the same parts; 
so that it is, in the latter respect, a sort of inversion of 
the Linnaean method.
In the former, or the outline of 
its plan, the system of Gleditsch is in some measure an 
anticipation of that of Jussieu.
Berlin has of late been 
much distinguished for the study of natural history, and 
possesses a society of its own, devoted to that pursuit.
Its greatest ornament was the late Professor Willdenow, 
who, if he fell under the lash of the more accurate Afze- 
467 
lius, is entitled to the gratitude of his fellow-labourers, 
not for theoretical speculations, but for the useful and ar- 
duous undertaking of a Species Plantarum, on the Lin- 
naean plan, being indeed an edition of the same work of 
Linnaeus, enriched with recent discoveries.
This book, 
left unfinished at the end of the first order of the Crypto- 
gamia, by the death of the editor, wants only a general 
index to render it sufficiently complete.
The Musci, Li- 
chenes, and Fungi, are systematically treated in the sepa- 
rate works of writers devoted to those particular, and now 
very extensive, subjects, from whom Willdenow could but 
have been a compiler.
With the Filices, which he lived to 
publish, he was practically conversant.
His insertion of 
the essential generic characters, throughout these volumes, 
is an useful addition, and now become necessary in every 
similar undertaking.
Little can be said of Holland in this review of the bo- 
tanical state of Europe for a few years past.
The Leyden 
garden has always been kept up, especially during the 
life of the late Professor David Van Royen, with due 
care and attention ; we know little of its fate in the sub- 
sequent convulsed state of the country.
Botany has long 
been on the decline at Amsterdam, though we are indebted 
to that garden for having first received, and afterwards 
communicated to other countries, such acquisitions of 
Thunberg in Japan as escaped the perils of importation.
The botany of Switzerland may, most commodiously, 
be considered in the next place.
Here, in his native 
country, the great Haller, after a long residence at Gbt- 
tingen, was finally established.
Its rich and charming 
Flora has been illustrated by his classical pen, with pecu- 
liar success.
Everybody is conversant with the second 
edition of his work, published in 1768, in 3 vols, folio, 
and entitled, Historia Stirpium Indigenarum Helvetia, 
with its inimitable engravings, of the Orchis tribe more 
particularly.
But few persons, who have not laboured 
with some attention at the botany of Switzerland, are 
2 h 2 
468 
aware of the superior value, in point of accuracy, of the 
original edition of the same work, published in 1742, 
under the title of Enumeratio Methodica Stirpium Hel- 
vetia Indigetiamm.
This edition is indispensable to those 
who wish fully to understand the subject, or to appreciate 
Haller's transcendent knowledge and abilities.
These 
works are classed after a system of his own, intended to 
be more consonant with nature than the Linnsean sexual 
method.
We can scarcely say that it is so, on the whole; 
nor is it, on the other hand, constructed according to any 
uniformity of plan.
The number of the stamens, com- 
pared with that of the segments of the corolla, or its 
petals, regulates the characters of several classes, and 
those are artificial.
Others are assumed as natural, and 
are for the most part really so, but their characters are fre- 
quently taken from Linnaeus, even from his artificial sy- 
stem, as the Cruciate, and the Apetalce.
Lord Bute has 
well said, that Haller was aLinnaeanin disguise.
His clas- 
sification however was merely intended to answer his own 
purpose, with respect to the Swiss plants ; for he was 
not a general botanist, nor had he a sufficiently compre- 
hensive view of the subject to form a general system, or 
even to be aware of the difficulties of such an underta- 
king.
He ought not therefore to be obnoxious to criticism 
in that view.
His method has served for the use of his 
scholars, as the Linnaean one serves English botanists, by 
way of a dictionary.
Some such is necessary ; and those 
who should begin to decide on the merits of a system, 
before they know plants, would most assuredly be in dan- 
ger of appearing more learned to themselves than toothers.
We cannot exculpate Haller from some degree of preju- 
dice in rejecting real improvements of Linnaeus, which 
are independent of classification ; such as his trivial or 
specific names, by which every species is spoken of at 
once, in one word, mostly so contrived as to assist the 
memory, by an indication of the character, appearance, 
history, or use, of the plant.
What did the great Swiss 
469 
botanist substitute in the place of this contrivance?
A 
series of numbers, burthensome to the memory, destitute 
of information, accommodated to his own book only, and 
necessarily liable to total change on the introduction of 
every new-discovered species !
At the same time that 
he rejected the luminous nomenclature of his old friend 
and fellow-student, who had laboured in the most inge- 
nuous terms to deprecate his jealousy, he paid a tacit 
homage to its merit, by contending that the honour of 
this invention was due to Rivinus.
In this he was not 
less incorrect than uncandid, the short names of Rivinus 
being designed as specific characters, for which purpose 
Haller knew, as well as Linnaeus, they were unfit.
Useful 
specific characters he himself constructed on the plan of 
Linnaeus, with some little variation, not always perhaps 
for the better, as to strictness of principle, but often 
strikingly expressive.
Here, as in every thing connected 
with practical botany, he shines.
The most rigid Linnaean, 
whose soul is not entirely shrivelled up with dry apho- 
risms and prejudice, must love Haller for his taste and 
enthusiasm, and the Flora of Switzerland as much for his 
sake as its own.
No wonder that his pupils multiplied, 
and formed a band of enthusiasts, tenacious of even the 
imperfections of their master.
The line of demarcation 
is now no longer distinctly drawn between them and the 
equally zealous scholars of the northern sage.
The 
amiable and lamented Davall strove to profit by the la- 
bours of both.
The Alpine botanists of France and Italy 
have served to amalgamate the Swedish and the Helve- 
tian schools.
The Flora of Dauphiny by Villars is nearly 
Linnaean in system, and the principles of the veteran Bel- 
lardi of Turin are entirely so; though he has been, in 
some of his publications, obliged to conform to the me- 
thod of his late preceptor, the venerable Allioni, who, in 
spite of all remonstrance, had the ambition of forming a 
system of his own.
His Flora Vedemontana is disposed 
according to this system, an unnatural and inconvenient 
470 
jumble of the ideas of Rivinus, Tournefort, and others.
This work is also faulty in the neglect of specific defini- 
tions, so that its plates and occasional descriptions are 
alone what render it useful ; nor would it perhaps, but 
for the uncommon abundance of rare species, be consulted 
at all.
We may glance over the botany of Italy, to whose 
boundaries we have thus been insensibly led, as the eye 
of the traveller takes a bird's-eye view of its outstretched 
plains from the summits of the Alps.
We may pass from 
Turin to Naples without meeting with any school of di- 
stinction.
The northern states are not without their 
professors and patrons of botany, nor are their nobles 
destitute of taste in various branches of natural know- 
ledge.
The names of a Castiglione of Milan, a Durazzo 
and Dinegro of Genoa, and a Savi of Pisa, deserve to be 
mentioned with honour, for their knowledge and their 
zeal.
The unfortunate Cyrillo, and his friend Pacifico, 
at Naples, were practical botanists.
There is also a rising 
school, of great promise, at Palermo.
But since the time 
of Scopoli, Italy has contributed little to our stock of in- 
formation ; nor are the latter publications of this eminent 
man, while he resided at Pavia, commensurate in import- 
ance or merit with those earlier ones, the Flora, and En- 
tomologia, Camiolica, which have immortalized his name.
Scopoli, who at first adopted a system of his own, had 
the sense and liberality, in his second edition, to resign 
it, in favour of what his maturer experience taught him 
to prefer, the sexual system of Linnaeus.
Spain and Portugal claim our attention ; the former 
for being the channel through which the gardens of Eu- 
rope have been, for some years past, enriched with many 
new Mexican and Peruvian plants ; and likewise as the 
theatre of the publication of some important books, rela- 
tive to the botany of those countries.
In speaking of 
American botany, we have mentioned the Flora Peru- 
viana, whose authors, Ruiz and Pavon, rank deservedly 
471 
high for their industry and knowledge.
The late Cava- 
nilles, resident at Madrid, has also communicated to the 
learned world much information, from the same source.
Spain seems anxious to redeem her reputation, which 
suffered so much from the neglect, or rather persecution, 
of the truly excellent but unfortunate Dombey, who, like 
many other benefactors of mankind, was allowed to make 
all his exertions in vain, and finally perished unknown, 
in the diabolical hands of English slave-dealers at Mont- 
serrat.
Portugal is most distinguished at home by the 
labours of a learned benedictine, Dr. Felix Avellar Bro- 
tero, author of a Flora Lusitanica, disposed after the 
Linnaean method, reduced entirely to principles of num- 
ber ; and abroad by the valuable work of Father Loureiro, 
entitled Flora Cochinchbiensis, in which the plants of 
Cochinchina, and of the neighbourhood of Canton, are 
classed and defined in the Linnaean manner, with valu- 
able descriptions and remarks.
It is undoubtedly a dis- 
grace to the possessors of such a country as Brasil, that 
they have not derived from thence more benefit to the 
world, or to themselves, from its natural productions.
But they are satisfied with what the bowels of the earth 
afford, and they neglect its more accessible, though per- 
haps not less valuable, treasures.
The jealousy and in- 
numerable restrictions of their Government render what 
they possess as useless to all the world as to themselves.
A genius of the first rank in natural science, as well as in 
every thing which his capacious mind embraced, has 
arisen in Portugal, and has been domesticated in the 
schools of Paris and London, the amiable and learned 
Correa de Serra, now a traveller in the United States of 
America.
What little impulse has been given to litera- 
ture in Portugal, and particularly the foundation of a 
Royal Academy of Sciences, is owing to him ; and though 
his name has chiefly appeared in the ranks of botanical 
science in an incidental manner, no one possesses more 
4/2 
enlarged and accurate views, or more profound knowledge, 
of the subject.
In the extensive, though incomplete, review which we 
have undertaken of the recent history of botanical science, 
the individual merits of particular writers have chiefly 
hitherto been detailed and compared.
The most difficult 
part of our task perhaps still remains ; to contrast and 
to appreciate the influence and the merits of two great 
and rival nations, in the general school of scientific bo- 
tany ; to consider the causes that have led to the parti- 
cular line which each has taken, and to compare the suc- 
cess, as well as to calculate the probable future conse- 
quences, of their respective aims.
England and France 
have, from the time of Ray and Tournefort, been compe- 
titors in botanical fame, because each was ambitious of 
supporting the credit of the great man she had produced.
This contest, however, as far as it regarded theoretical 
speculations; has entirely subsided on the part of Ray's 
champions.
In practical science, likewise, the admirers 
of Ray and of Tournefort have shaken hands, like those 
of every other school.
On the subject of system, the 
question is greatly changed; for though a phoenix has 
arisen from the ashes of Tournefort, its " star-like eyes," 
darting far beyond all former competition, have been met, 
if not dazzled, by a new light, rising in full glory from 
the north ; a polar star, which has been hailed by all the 
nations of the earth.
The Linnsean system of classification, with all its con- 
comitant advantages of nomenclature, luminous technical 
definition, and richness of information, was planted, like 
afresh and vigorous scion, in the favourable soil of En- 
gland, already fertilized with accumulations of practical 
knowledge, about the middle of the last century.
If we 
may pursue the metaphor, the ground was entirely cleared 
for its reception ; for all previous systems had been of 
473 
confined and local use ; the alphabetical index having 
become the resource of even the most learned ; and the 
pupils of Ray being held to his method of classification, 
rathe 'by their gratitude for his practical instruction, than 
any other consideration.
Accordingly we have, in our 
own early progress, before they were all, as at present, 
swept off the stage, found them rather contending for his 
nomenclature, imperfect as it was, because they were ha- 
bituated to it, than for his system, of which, it was evi- 
dei t, they had made little use.
Hence the first attempt 
in England to reduce our plants to Linnsean order, made 
by Hill, was chiefly a transposition of Ray's Synopsis into 
the Linnsean classes, the original nomenclature being re- 
tained, while the specific names of the Species Plantarum 
were rejected.
Hill's imperfect performance was superseded by the 
more classical Flora Anglica of Hudson, composed under 
the auspices and advice of the learned and ingenious Stil- 
lingfleet, in which the botany of England assumed a most 
scientific aspect, and with which all the knowledge of 
Ray was incorporated.
At the same time, the principles 
of theoretical botany, and the philosophical writings of 
the learned Swede, were studied with no ordinary powers 
of discrimination and judgement, in a small circle of ex- 
perienced observers at Norwich.
A love of flowers, and 
a great degree of skill in their cultivation, had been long 
ago imported into that ancient commercial city, with its 
worsted manufacture, from Flanders ; and out of this 
taste, something like the study of systematic botany had 
sprung.
These pursuits were mostly confined to the 
humblest of the community, particularly among the then 
very numerous bodies of journeymen weavers, dyers, &c.
Towards the middle of the eighteenth century, several of 
the opulent merchants seem to have acquired, by their 
intimate connexion with Holland, not only the above- 
mentioned taste for horticulture, but likewise an ambition 
474 
to be distinguished by their museums of natural curiosities.
The former sometimes extended itself, from the flowery 
parterre, and the well-arranged rows of tulips, hyacinths, 
carnations and auriculas, into no less formal labyrinths, 
or perhaps a double pattern of angular or spiral walks, 
between clipped hedges, exactly alike on each side of a 
broad gravel walk.
Such was the most sublime effort of 
the art within the compass of our recollection.
" Grove" 
could by no means be said to " nod at grove," for the 
perpendicular and well-trimmed structure was incapable 
of nodding ; but that "each alley should have a brother" 
was an indispensable part of the design.
Greenhouses 
of exotic plants, except oranges and myrtles, were at this 
time scarcely known ; and the writer well recollects 
having seen, with wonder and admiration, above forty 
years ago, one of the first African Geraniums that ever 
bloomed in Norwich.
If, however, the progress of natural 
science was slow in this angle of the kingdom, the wealthy 
manufacturers, become their own merchants, found it ne- 
cessary to acquire a knowledge of various foreign lan- 
guages, in order to carry on their wide-extended com- 
merce.
In learning French, Italian, Spanish, Dutch, and 
German, they unavoidably acquired many new ideas.
Their sons were sent to the continent, and it were hard 
indeed if many of them did not bring home much that 
was worth learning.
The society of the place, aided by 
some concomitant circumstances, and the adventitious ac- 
quisition of two or three men of singular talents and ac- 
complishments, became improved.
A happy mixture of 
literature and taste for many years distinguished this 
city above its rivals in opulence and commercial pros- 
perity.
Such Norwich has been in our memory; and if 
its splendour be gone by, a taste for mental cultivation, 
originating in many of the before-mentioned causes, still 
remains, and is fostered by the novel pursuits of chemistry 
and natural history, on which some arts, of great import- 
475 
ance in the manufactory of the place, depend for im- 
provement.
We trust the reader will pardon this digres- 
sion from the subject more immediately before us, to 
which we shall now return.
Some of the more learned students of English plants, 
among the lovers of botany in Norwich, had long been 
conversant with the works of Ray, and even the Historia 
Muscorum of Dillenius.
They were prepared therefore 
to admire, and to profit by, the philosophical writings of 
Linnaeus.
Hence originated the Elements of Botany, 
p\iblished in 1775, by Mr. Hugh Rose ; who was aided 
in the undertaking by his equally learned friend, the Rev.
Henry Bryant, of whose acuteness and botanical skill no 
better proof is wanting, than his having found and deter- 
mined, nine years before, the minute Tillaa muscosa, for 
the first time in this island.
Numerous pupils were eager 
to improve themselves by the assistance of such masters, 
and amongst others the writer of these pages imbibed, 
from their ardour and their friendly assistance, the first 
rudiments of a pursuit that has proved the happiness and 
the principal object of his life.
London became, of course, the focus of this science, 
as well as of every other.
Of the English Universities, 
Cambridge most fulfilled its duty, in rendering its public 
establishments useful to the ends for which they were 
founded and paid.
The names of Martyn, both father 
and son, have long maintained a distinguished rank in 
botany ; and the latter, for many years, has inculcated the 
true principles of Linneean science from the professor's 
chair.
A botanic garden was established, by a private 
individual, Dr. Walker, about the period of which we are 
speaking.
A Linnaean Flora Cantabrigiensis, by Mr.
Relhan, has renewed the celebrity of that field, in which 
Ray had formerly laboured ; and there has always existed 
a little community of Cambridge botanists, though fluc- 
tuating and varying, according to circumstances.
At 
Oxford, botany, so vigorously established by Sherard and 
476 
Dillenius, slept for forty years under the auspices of the 
elder Professor Sibthorp, at least as to the utility of its 
public foundations.
Yet even there the science had many 
individual cultivators, and if others were forgotten, the 
name of a Banks ought to render this school for ever ce- 
lebrated.
The younger Professor Sibthorp well atoned 
for the supineness of his father and predecessor.
He 
published a Flora Oxoniensis, and extended his inquiries 
into the classical scenes of Greece, finally sacrificing his 
life to his labours, and sealing his love of this engaging 
study by a posthumous foundation, which provides for the 
publication of a sumptuous Flora Grceca, and the subse- 
quent establishment of a professorship of Rural Economy.
Edinburgh, under the auspices of the late worthy Pro- 
fessor Hope, became distinguished for the cultivation of 
botany, 'as a branch of medical education.
The physi- 
ology of plants was there taught, more assiduously than 
in almost any other university of Europe; and the Linnaean 
principles were ably enforced and illustrated, not with 
slavish devotion, but with enlightened discrimination.
Nor must the dissenting Academy at Warrington be for- 
gotten, where the distinguished circumnavigator Forster, 
of whom we have already spoken, was settled.
Here 
many young naturalists were trained.
The neighbouring 
family of the Blackburnes, possessed, even to this day, of 
one of the oldest and richest botanic gardens in England, 
have steadily fostered this and other branches of natural 
knowledge.
The same taste has spread to Manchester, 
Liverpool, and the country around.- Westmoreland, Nor- 
thumberland, and Durham have their sequestered prac- 
tical botanists, in every rank of life.
Scenes celebrated 
by the correspondents of Ray are still the favourite haunts 
of these lovers of nature and science, who every day add 
something to our information, and to the celebrity of other 
parts of the same neighbourhood.
We must now concentrate our attention to the London 
school, which for about forty years past has maintained a 
477 
rank superior to most other seats of botanical science ; 
the more so perhaps for its being founded in total disinter- 
estedness, both with respect to authority and emolument.
Truth alone, not system, has been the leading object of this 
school ; unbiassed and gratuitous patronage its support ; 
and a genuine love of nature and of knowledge its bond 
of union, among persons not less distinguished from each 
other by character and opinion, than, by their different 
pursuits, and various ranks of life.
The illustrious Banks, 
from the time when, after his return from his celebrated 
and adventurous voyage, he devoted himself to the prac- 
tical cultivation of natural science for the advantage of 
others, as he had long pursued it for his own pleasure 
and instruction, has been the head of this school.
Here 
he fixed the amiable and learned Solander, for the re- 
mainder of his too short life.
The house of this liberal 
Mecsenas has ever since been, not only open, but, in a 
manner, at the entire command of the cultivators and ad- 
mirers of this and other branches of philosophy; inasmuch 
as his library and museum have been devoted to their free 
use ; and his own assistance, encouragement and infor- 
mation are as much at their service, as if his fortune and 
fame had all along depended on their favour.
With such 
an establishment as this, aided by the perpetual re- 
sources of the numerous public and private gardens 
around, botany might well flourish.
The liberal spirit of 
the leaders of this pursuit gave a tone to the whole.
The owners of nurseries, though depending on pecuniary 
emolument for their support, rivalled each other in disin- 
terested communication.
The improvement of science 
was the leading object of all.
One of this latter descrip- 
tion took his rank among the literary teachers of botany.
Lee's Introduction was much approved by Linnaeus, 
whose system and principles it ably exemplifies, and who 
became the friend and correspondent of its author.
Tra- 
velling botanists were dispatched, under the patronage of 
the affluent, to enrich our gardens from the Alps, the 
478 
Cape of Good Hope, and the various parts of America.
Every new acquisition was scrutinized, and received its 
allotted name and distinction, from the hand of the correct 
and classical Solander, who one day was admiring with 
Collinson, Fothergill, or Pitcairn, the treasures of their 
respective gardens, and another labouring with the distin- 
guished Ellis, at the more abstruse determination of the 
intricate family of marine productions, whether sea-weeds, 
corallines, or shells.
His own acquisitions, and those of 
his friend and patron, in the fairy land of the South-Sea 
Islands, the hazardous shores of New Holland, or the 
nearly fatal groves and swamps of Java, were at the same 
time recorded by his pen, as they were gradually perpe- 
tuating by the slow labours of the engraver.
To this 
band of zealous naturalists the younger Linnaeus was, for 
a while, associated, as well as the excellent and zealous 
Broussonet, who, though not unversed in botany, devoted 
himself most particularly to the more uncommon pursuit 
of scientific ichthyology.
The Banksian school, altogether intent upon practical 
botany, had adopted the Linnaean system as the most 
commodious, while it pursued and cultivated the Linnaean 
principles, as the only ones which, by their transcendent 
excellence, could support the science of botany on a stable 
foundation.
In these Dr. Solander was, of course, well 
trained ; and, having added so wide a range of experience 
to his theoretical education, few botanists could vie with 
him, who had, as it were, caught his preceptor's mantle, 
and imbibed, by a sort of inspiration, a peculiar talent for 
concise and clear definition.
Abstract principles of clas- 
sification, or even such outlines of natural arrangement as 
Linnaeus had promulgated, seem never to have attracted 
Solander.
In following the chain of his ideas, discernible 
in the materials he has left behind him, one cannot but 
remark his singular inattention to every thing like botani- 
cal affinity, to which the artificial sexual system was, with 
him, entirely paramount.
The genera which, for extern- 
479 
poraneous use, he named with the termination oides, com- 
paring each with some well-known genus, till a proper 
appellation could be selected, are seldom thus compared 
because of any natural affinity, nor scarcely any external 
resemblance, but because they agree with such in their 
place in the artificial system, or nearly perhaps in tech- 
nical characters.
A great botanist therefore, it is evi- 
dent, may exist, without that vaunted erudition in a pe- 
culiar line, which some would have us consider as the 
only road to knowledge and to fame.
We allow that 
this sort of erudition is now, since the attention it has 
received from Linnseus, Jussieu, and others, become in- 
dispensable to a good theoretical or philosophical bota- 
nist, as is the study of carpology, in consequence of the 
labours of Gsertner ; we only contend that it is possible 
to know plants extremely well without either.
The learned Dryander, less skilled than his predeces- 
sor as the coadjutor of Sir Joseph Banks, in a practical 
acquaintance with plants, exceeded him in theoretical 
lore and ingenious speculation, and far excelled every 
other man in bibliographic information, as well as in the 
most precise fastidious exactness relative to every sub- 
ject within the wide extent of his various knowledge.
He 
furthered, upon principle, and with unwearied assiduity, 
every object of the noble establishment to which he was 
devoted ; but he, like Solander, now sleeps with his fa- 
thers,andhis place is supplied byageniusofBritishgrowth, 
who unites talents with experience, and theoretical skill, 
in the most eminent degree, with practical knowledge.
Although it is almost superfluous to name the most 
eminent disciples of the London school of botany, it 
might seem negligent to pass them over without some 
particular mention.
The ardent and ingenious Curtis 
has left a permanent monument behind him, in the Flora 
Londinensis, to say nothing of the popular Botanical 
Magazine, continued by his friend Dr. Sims.
The Flora 
Scotica of Lightfoot first offered, in a pleasing and fami- 
480 
liar garb, the botanical riches of that part of the island 
to its southern inhabitants.
The lynx-eyed Dickson, so 
long and faithfully attached to his constant patron, has 
steadily traced, through all its windings, the obscure 
path of cryptogamic botany, with peculiar success.
No 
more striking instance can be pointed out, to prove how 
totally the most consummate practical skill, even in the 
most difficult part of botany, is independent of theoreti- 
cal learning.
Even those who profit by the certain aids 
supplied by the discoveries of Hedwig, can with difficulty 
keep pace with this veteran in their pursuits, who, with 
conscious independence, neglects all those aids.
Just at the time when the school, whose history we are 
endeavouring to trace, had most firmly established its 
credit and its utility, a great additional weight was given 
to England, in the scale of natural science, by the ac- 
quisition of the entire museum, library, and manuscripts 
of the great Linnaeus and his son, which came amongst 
us, by private purchase, in 1 784, after the death of the 
latter.
Hence our nomenclature has been corrected, 
and our knowledge greatly augmented.
These collec- 
tions have necessarily been consulted by most persons, 
about to publish on the subject, of natural history ; and a 
reference to them, in doubtful cases, secures a general 
conformity of sentiment and nomenclature, among the 
botanists of Europe, Asia, and America.
We are seldom 
obliged to waste time in conjecturing what Linnaeus, or 
the botanists with whom he corresponded, meant, for we 
have before us their original specimens, named by their 
own hands.
An entire London winter was devoted to 
the almost daily labour, of comparing the Banksian her- 
barium throughout, with that of Linnaeus, and to a copious 
interchange of specimens between their respective pos- 
sessors, who, with the aid of Mr. Dryander alone, ac- 
complished this interesting and instructive comparison.
Hence the Hortus Kewensis of the lamented Aiton, which 
was at that period preparing for publication, became 
481 
much more correct in its names, than it, or any other 
similar performance, could have been, without this advan- 
tage.
It could scarcely be imagined that Sweden would, 
unmoved, thus let the botanical sceptre pass from her; 
but it is much to the honour of the nation, that all her 
naturalists have ever preserved the most friendly inter- 
course with us, particularly with the person who deprived 
them of this treasure.
They have not merely pardoned, 
but publicly sanctioned, the scientific zeal which prompted 
him to this acquisition, by associating him with all their 
learned establishments, without any solicitation on his 
part.
The institution of the Linnsean Society at London in 
1788, especially under that name, must be considered as 
a triumph for Sweden in her turn.
By this establishment 
the intercourse of science is facilitated; essays, which 
might otherwise have never seen the light, are given to 
the world ; and a general taste for the pleasing study of 
nature is promoted.
Learned and worthy people are thus 
made acquainted with each other, from the remotest cor- 
ners of the kingdom, and their information enriches the 
common stock.
The state has given its sanction to this 
rising establishment.
Its publications and its members 
are spread over the Continent, and other similar institu- 
tions have borrowed its name, imitated its plan, and paid 
respect to its authority.
Yet it is not in the name alone 
of Linnaeus, that the members of this Society place their 
confidence; still less do they bow to that name or to any 
other, at the expense of their own right of private judge- 
ment.
Their Transactions are open to the pupils of every 
school, and the observations of every critic, that have any 
prospect of being useful to the world.
The writer of each 
communication, must, of course, be answerable for the 
particulars of his own performance, but the Society is re- 
sponsible for each being, on the whole, worthy to be 
communicated to the public.
The possession of the very 
materials with which Linnceus worked, his own specimens

and notes, enables us very often to correct mistakes, even 
of that great man, many of which would be unaccountable 
without the means of thus tracing each to its source.
At 
the same time, the acquisition of materials to which he 
never had access, tends to improve and augment the hi- 
story of what he had left imperfect.
His language, his 
definitions and characters were, for some time, held so 
sacred, that they were implicitly copied, even though 
manifestly inapplicable, in some points, to the objects to 
which they were referred.
Synonyms were transcribed 
from his works by Rose, Hudson, Curtis, and even Gaert- 
ner, (we assert it on the positive proof of errors of the 
press, copied in the transcribing,) without reference to the 
original books, to see whether such synonyms, or their 
accompanying plates, agreed with the plant under consi- 
deration.
The example of Dr. Solander first led the wri- 
ter of this to avoid such a negligent and unfaithful mode 
of proceeding ; yet he has ever considered as sacred the 
very words of Linnaeus, where they require no correction.
They are become a kind of public property, the current 
coin of the botanical realm, which ought not, with impu- 
nity, to be falsified or adulterated.
To them we hope to 
be pardoned if we apply the words of the poet, 
" The solid bullion of one sterling line, 
Drawn to French wire, would through whole pages shine." 
Of this it is needless to quote examples.
We must be 
every day more and more sensible of the value of the Lin- 
naean style, in proportion as the number of those who can 
attain it is evidently so very small.
By the light of our 
master alone can the science, which he so greatly advanced 
and refined, be preserved from barbarism, while long and 
tedious, loose and feeble, ill-contrasted and barbarously- 
worded definitions, press upon it from various quarters.
New terms are invented to express old ideas ; names and 
characters are changed for the worse, to conceal the want 
of new discoveries ; and students are often deterred from 
483 
adopting real improvements, because they know not which 
guide to prefer.
From the combined effects of the various causes which 
we have endeavoured to trace, the study of botany in 
England has, for a long period, been almost entirely prac- 
tical.
To determine the particular species intended, in 
every case, by Linnaeus ; to distinguish and to describe 
new ones; to improve scientific characters, and to correct 
synonyms ; these have been the objects of our writers ; 
and hence many publications of great utility, especially a 
number of critical and descriptive essays, in the Transac- 
tions of the Linnaean Society, not unworthy of the school 
which gave them birth, have enriched the general stock 
of knowledge.
These are the sound fruits of skill and 
investigation, the solid advantages of real information, 
applied to practical use.
They are independent of theo- 
retical speculation, and will stand unshaken, amidst any 
possible changes of system.
On such principles the Flora 
JBritannica has been attempted, and continued as far as 
the present unsettled state of some of the latter orders, of 
the last class, will allow.
Such impediments, which 
depend on the difficulties of systematic discrimination, 
among the Lichens especially, it is hoped will soon be 
removed.
Meanwhile the English Botany of the same 
writer, illustrated by Mr. Sowerby's expressive and scien- 
tific figures, has finished its course, and formed so nearly 
complete a body of local botany, as, we believe, no other 
country has produced.
In this the liberal contributions 
of numerous skilful observers, from the alpine heights of 
Scotland to the shores and circumambient ocean of the 
south, are preserved and recorded ; evincing a degree of 
general inquiry and acuteness, which hardly any nation 
can rival.
The memory of several benefactors to the 
science, otherwise in danger of passing away, is embalmed 
in this national work, which serves at once as their bota- 
nical testament, and the monument of their fame.
Some 
of our botanists of the present day have thrown great light 
2 i 2 
484 
on several of the most obscure departments of the science; 
witness Mr. Sowerby's work on English Fiuigi ; the la- 
bours of the learned Bishop of Carlisle on Carices, and, 
in conjunction with Mr. Woodward, on Fuci ; of Mr.
Dawson Turner on the latter tribe, and on the Musci of 
Ireland ; but especially Mr. Hooker's inimitable display 
of the British Jioivermcunrice.
Nor shall the contributions 
of a Winch or an Abbot, a Withering, Knapp, Stackhouse 
or Velley, nor the more splendid labours of the indefati- 
gable Lambert, be forgotten.
Each, in one way or other, 
has enlarged the bounds of science, or rendered it easier 
of access.
We cannot, in the compass of our present 
undertaking, pay the tribute due to every individual, our 
aim being a general picture of the whole.
From what we 
have said, the zeal with which this lovely science has been 
cultivated in England will sufficiently appear.
Nor have 
public lectures, or botanic gardens, been neglected, in 
order to render the knowledge of botany as accessible as 
possible, and to diffuse a taste for its pursuit.
The po- 
pularity of the study has, at least, kept pace with the 
means of instruction.
The garden and green-house, the 
woods, fields, and even the concealed treasures of the 
waters, are now the resource of the young and the elegant, 
who in the enjoyment of a new sense, as it were, in the 
retirement of the country, imbibe health, as well as know- 
ledge and taste, at the purest of all sources.
France alone now remains to be considered, in order 
to finish the historical picture which we have undertaken, 
of the state of botanical science in Europe.
To do justice 
to this part of our subject, we must turn our attention to 
times long since gone by, or we shall scarcely render in- 
telligible the state of affairs at present.
The great Tournefort, by the force of his character, his 
general and particular information, the charms of his pen, 
and the celebrity which his name gave to his country, 
through the popularity of his botanical system, was so 
firmly established, in the ideas of the French, as the Grand 
485 
Monarque of botany, that they would have as soon allowed 
the greatness of Louis XIV.
to be questioned, as that of 
this distinguished philosopher.
So beneficial was this 
partiality, in some respects, that it gave an unprecedented 
impulse and popularity to the science ; so disadvantageous 
was it in others, that it placed a formidable barrier in the 
way of all improvement.
Vaillant, the able and worthy 
pupil of Tournefort, has never been forgiven for speaking, 
on some occasions, too freely of his master's defects.
Hence his own merit has been kept in the background.
The doctrine of the sexes of plants was discountenanced 
as long as possible, because it was proved by Vaillant, 
after having been rejected by Tournefort.
Nevertheless, 
when the good seed of science is once sown, it can hardly 
be totally suffocated by the impediments of prejudice and 
ignorant partiality.
Practical zeal sprung up by the side 
of speculative jealousy, and the tares withered, while the 
profitable plants flourished.
Some botanists followed the 
steps of Tournefort to the Levant, exploring afresh those 
countries which he has for ever rendered classic around.
Others visited America, which they traversed in different 
directions.
The indefatigable Plumier performed three 
separate voyages to the western world, and though his 
discoveries have, in a great measure, suffered shipwreck 
from tardy and imperfect patronage, as a great part of his 
collections did by the accidents of nature, yet something 
of value remains.
His Filices are enough to insure his 
perpetual remembrance, and his Nova Genera are the 
basis of our knowledge of generic differences in West In- 
dian plants.
Most of all has been distinguished, among 
the French botanists who succeeded the times of Tourne- 
fort and Vaillant, the family of the Jussieus.
One of 
these investigated the prolific regions of Peru, and dis- 
covered some things which no succeeding traveller has 
gathered ; other branches of this family, besides being- 
eminent in medical science and practice, have pursued 
the study of botany with no ordinary success, on the most 
486 
philosophical principles.
Of these the most eminent are 
the celebrated Bernard de Jussieu, the contemporary of 
the earlier days of Linnaeus ; and his nephew Antoine Lau- 
rent de Jussieu, the pride and the ruler of systematic 
botany at present ill France.
The views and the perfor- 
mances of these great men lead us to a new branch of our 
subject, which indeed we have had in our contemplation 
from the beginning of this essay, the exposition of the 
principles of a natural scheme of botanical classification, 
as hinted, and imperfectly sketched, by Linnaeus, and 
brought to the perfection of a regular system by the Jus- 
sieus.
Previous to our entering on this detail, and the remarks 
to which it will give rise, we must conclude all that be- 
longs to the former part of our undertaking, by giving 
some account of those botanists who have formed and 
maintained a Linneean school in France.
We must shel- 
ter ourselves under the broad banner of truth when we 
observe that these have, till very lately, been almost the 
only French botanists that have supplied us with any 
practical information ; and their labours have been useful 
in proportion as they have commendably shaken off the 
prejudices of their predecessors.
Of this last proposition 
Duhamel is a witness, though we may perhaps excite 
some surprise in classing him among Linneean botanists.
His preface to his Traitt des Arbres sufficiently shows 
how fearful he was of being taken for such, and yet how 
he was held by vulgar prejudice alone, to the nomencla- 
ture, or rather the generical opinions, of Tournefort.
He 
tells us, while he adopts these, that his judgement went 
with Linneeus, whom he follows in all new discoveries.
The plan of his book, confined to hardy trees and shrubs, 
justifies his use of an alphabetical arrangement, in pre- 
ference to any system, unless he had thought sufficiently 
well of Tournefort's to prefer that.
But he has prefixed 
to his work, as a practical method of discovering scienti- 
fically what it contained, no other than a sexual classifi- 
487 
cation.
His practical botany was so limited, being en- 
tirely subservient to his great objects, of forest planting 
and vegetable physiology, that he had no attention to 
spare for the consideration of methodical systems.
Ac- 
cordingly he tells us, that some such is necessary for the 
use of botanists, especially of those who explore the pro- 
ductions of foreign countries, but whether the method of 
Ray, Tournefort, Boerhaave, Van-Royen, Linnaeus, or 
Bernard de Jussieu be adopted, is of no importance.
Six 
years before Duhamel's work came out, Dalibard had 
published, in 1749, his Flora Parisiensis Prodromus, ac- 
cording to the Linnaean system.
It has always appeared to the writer of this, from the 
conversation and writings of French botanists, that the 
judgement of the learned Le Monnier, and the countenance 
of his patron the Duke D'Ayen, afterwards Marechal de 
Noailles, first established the reputation of Linnaeus in 
France ; not so much possibly for the sake of his system, 
as his discoveries, his commodious nomenclature, and his 
clear principles of discrimination.
When Le Monnier 
botanized in Chili, in the company of the astronomers with 
whom he was associated, he soon found, like Dr. Garden 
in South Carolina, that the classification of Tournefort 
was no key to the treasury of a new world.
He however 
made his remarks and collections, and studied them sub- 
sequently under the auspices of a more comprehensive 
guide.
The Marechal de Noailles, a great cultivator of 
exotic trees and shrubs, corresponded with the Swedish 
naturalist, and endeavoured to recommend him to the no- 
tice of the lovers of plants in France.
Meantime Gerard 
and Gouau in the south, both introduced themselves to 
the illustrious Swede, and promulgated his principles and 
discoveries, though only the latter adopted his classifica- 
tion.
Villars we have already noticed as the author of a 
Linnaean Histoire des Plantes de Dauphine.
He died lately, 
Professor of Botany at Strasburgh, where he succeeded 
the very able and philosophical Hermann, one of the truest 
488 
Linnaeans, who had imbibed all the technical style of the 
Swedish school, as well as its accuracy of discrimination.
We may now safely announce Hermann as the real author, 
in conjunction perhaps with Baron Born, of that ingenious 
but bitter satire the Monachologia, in which the several 
species of monks are affectedly discriminated, and their 
manners detailed, like the animals in the Linnaean Systema 
Natura.
This ludicrous performance has long since ap- 
peared in a, not very exact, English translation, and was 
rendered into French by the late M.
Broussonet.
As we 
are led again to name this amiable man, too soon lost to 
his country, after experiencing every vicissitude of revo- 
lutionary peril and alarm, we cannot help distinguishing 
him as one most zealous in the cultivation and diffusion 
of Linnaean learning, a taste for which he chiefly imbibed 
in England.
He had no indulgence for those prejudices, 
which cramped the talents of his countrymen, and pre- 
vented their deriving knowledge from any quarter where 
it was to be had.
He recommended the younger Linnaeus 
to their personal acquaintance and favour, which service 
he also rendered, a few years after, to the person who now 
commemorates his worth, and who will ever remember, 
with affection and regret, his many virtues, his agreeable 
converse, and his various and extensive acquirements.
The intimacy which subsisted between this enthusiastic 
naturalist, and the distinguished botanist L'Heritier, con- 
firmed, if it did not originally implant, in the mind of the 
latter, that strong bias which he ever showed for the Lin- 
naean principles of botany.
According to these his nu- 
merous splendid works are composed.
He moreover 
imbibed, if we mistake not, from the same source, a pe- 
culiar preference for uncoloured engravings of plants, 
instead of the coloured ones which had Ions been in use.
It cannot be denied that the merit of these last is very 
various, and sometimes very small.
They do, nevertheless, 
present to the mind a more ready idea of each species, 
than a simple engraving can do, nor is the latter less liable 
489 
to incorrectness.
When plates are taken from the deli- 
neations of such exquisite artists as L'Heritier employed, 
they have a good chance of excellence ; but the engra- 
vings of Cavanilles, done after miserable drawings, though 
they deceive the eye by their neat finishing, are really less 
exact than many a rude outline.
Coloured plates, if ex- 
ecuted with the uniformity and scientific exactness of Mr.
Sowerby's, or the characteristic effect of Jacquin's, speak 
to the eye more readily than most engravings.
The art 
of printing in colours, practised formerly in England with 
small success, was revived at Paris by Bulliard, and is 
carried to the highest perfection in the recent publications 
of Redoute and Ventenat, which leave hardly any thing 
to be wished for, with respect to beauty or exactness.
Many of the works of L'Heritier have remained imperfect, 
in consequence of the political convulsions of his country, 
and his own premature death.
The learned and worthy 
Desfontaines, who travelled in Barbary, has been more 
fortunate in the completion of his labours.
His elegant 
Flora Atlantica, in 2 vols.
4to, with finely engraved un- 
coloured plates, is classed and modelled on the plan of 
the Linnaean school.
Such also is the plan of the works 
of that distinguished botanist La Billardiere, who, besides 
his account of New Holland plants, has published five 
elegant decades of new species from Syria.
That scien- 
tific horticulturist M.
Thouin, likewise a most excellent 
botanist, though he has scarcely written on the subject, 
is a correct pupil of the Swedish school.
His general spirit 
of liberal communication, and his personal attachment to 
the younger Linnaeus, led him to enrich the herbarium of 
the latter with the choicest specimens of Commerson's 
great collection, destined otherwise to have remained in 
almost entire oblivion.
A singular fate has attended the 
discoveries of most of the French voyagers, such as Com- 
merson, Sonnerat, and Dombey, that, from one cause or 
other, they have scarcely seen the light.
So also it has 
happened to those of Tournefort, Sarrazin, Plumier, and 
490 
others, whose acquisitions have long slept in the Parisian 
museums.
Happily there seems to have arisen of late a 
commendable desire to render them useful by publication, 
and thus many fine plants, known merely by the slight 
and unscientific appellations of Tournefort, and therefore 
never adopted by Linnaeus, have recently been clearly de- 
fined, or elegantly delineated.
The journeys of Olivier 
and Michaux towards the east have enriched the Paris 
gardens, and been the means of restoring several lost 
Tournefortian plants.
We believe however that the En- 
glish nurseries have proved the most fertile source of aug- 
mentation to the French collections, as appears by the 
pages of all the recent descriptive writers in France.
We dare not presume to arrange the indefatigable and 
very original botanist Lamarck among the Linnaean bota- 
nists of his country; but we beg leave to mention him here, 
as one who has thought for himself, and whose works are 
the better for that reason.
His severe and often petulant 
criticisms of the Swedish teacher, made him appear more 
hostile than he really was, to the principles of that great 
man.
Being engaged in the botanical department of the 
Encyc/opedie Methodique, he was obliged to conform to 
an alphabetical arrangement ; but he surely might have 
chosen the scientific generic names for that purpose, in- 
stead of barbarous or vernacular ones, which, to foreign- 
ers, would have made all the difference between a com- 
modious and an unintelligible disposition of his work.
In 
the detail of his performance, he has great merit, both 
with respect to clearing up obscure species, or describing 
new ones, and he had the advantage of access, on many 
occasions, to Commerson's collection.
Lamarck's Flore 
Frartfoise, is arranged after a new analytical method of 
his own.
This book however is valuable, independent of 
its system, as an assemblage of practical knowledge and 
observation.
We have only to regret a wanton and in- 
convenient change of names, which too often occurs, and 
which is not always for the better ; witness Cheiranthus 
491 
hurtensis.
instead of the long established incanus of Lin- 
naeus ; Melampyrum violaceum, which is not correct, for 
nemorosum, which is strictly so, and which preserves an 
analogy with the rest of the species.
We shall now undertake the consideration of the prin- 
ciples that have been suggested, and the attempts that 
have been made, respecting a 
Natural Classification of Plants.
The sexual system of Linnaeus lays no claim to the 
merit of being a natural arrangement.
Its sole aim is to 
assist us in determining any described plant by analytical 
examination.
The principles on which it is founded are 
the number, situation, proportion, or connexion, of the 
stamens and pistils, or organs of impregnation.
These 
principles are taken absolutely, with the sole exception 
of their not being permitted to divide the genera, that is, 
to place some species of a genus in one part of the system, 
and others in another, though such may differ in the 
number, situation, proportion, or connexion of their sta- 
mens or pistils ; those characters being possibly artificial, 
while the genera are supposed, or intended, according to 
a fundamental law independent of all systems, to be na- 
tural assemblages of species.
We need not here explain 
the mode in which Linnaeus has provided against any in- 
convenience in practice, resulting from such anomalies of 
Nature herself.
But though this popular system of Linnaeus does not 
profess to be a natural method of classification, it is, in 
many points, incidentally so, several of its classes or or- 
ders whose characters are founded in situation, proportion, 
or connexion, being more or less perfectly natural assem- 
blages ; nor can it be denied that, on the whole, it usually 
brings together as many groups of natural genera, as oc- 
cur in most systems that have been promulgated.
This 
fact would be more evident, if the various editors of this 
492 
system, those who have added new genera to the original 
ones of Linnaeus, or, in general, those who have any way 
applied his method to practice, had properly understood 
it.
They would then have perceived that its author had 
always natural affinities in view ; his aim, however in- 
completely fulfilled, according to our advanced know- 
ledge, having constantly been, to place genera together 
in natural affinity or progression, as far as their relation- 
ship could be discerned.
At the same time he uses an 
analytical method, at the head of each class in his Sy- 
stema Vegetabilium, in which the genera are disposed 
according to their technical characters.
Murray, in 
compiling the fourteenth edition of that work, has been 
inadvertent, respecting this essential part of its plan.
Indeed it is probable that he was not competent to judge 
of the affinities of the new genera, introduced from the 
Supplement um, or from the communications of Jacquin, 
Thunberg, 8cc.
Yet surely he might have perceived the 
affinity of Banksia to Protect, rather than to Ludwigia or 
Oldenlandia ; and indeed Linnaeus himself ought to have 
discovered the relationship of the latter to Hedyotis, if he 
did not detect their identity, instead of inserting it be- 
tween two such strict allies of each other as Ludwigia and 
Ammannia.
To pursue these remarks would be endless.
It is hardly necessary to indicate the natural classes, or 
orders of the Linnaean system, such as the Tetr adynamia, 
Didynamia, Diadelphia, Syngenesia; the Triandria Di- 
gynia, Gynandria Diandria, &c.
Except the first-men- 
tioned class, which, if Cleome be removed, is strictly 
natural and entire, the others are liable to much criticism.
We are almost disposed to allow, what we know not that 
any one has yet observed, that the system in question is 
the more faulty in theory, for these classes being so natu- 
ral as they are.
Each order of the Didynamia presents 
itself as a natural order, though the character of that 
class, derived from the proportion of the stamens, serves 
to exclude several genera of each order, and to send them 
493 
far back, into the second class.
If all ideas of natural 
affinity be discarded from our minds, there is no harm 
whatever in this ; but if the Didynamia claims any credit, 
as a class founded in nature, the above anomaly is a de- 
fect.
So, still more, under the same point of view, is the 
Diadelphia, or at least its principal order Decandria, lia- 
ble to exception.
This order consists entirely of the very 
natural family of Papilionacece.
They are characterized 
as having the ten stamens in two sets.
Now it happens 
that there are many papilionaceous genera, indeed a great 
number of such have been discovered since Linnseus 
wrote, whose ten stamens are all perfectly distinct.
These 
therefore are necessarily referred to the class Decandria, 
and they come not altogether amiss there, because they 
meet, in that class, some concomitant genera, which though, 
like them, leguminous, are less exactly, or scarcely at all, 
papilionaceous.
But the greatest complaint lies against 
some genera of the Diadelphia Decandria, for having 
the stamens all really combined into one set, so as in 
truth to answer to the technical character of the pre- 
ceding class, Monadelphia.
There is mostly indeed some 
indication of a disunion upward, where they, more or 
less perfectly, form two sets ; and some of them are 
so nearly diadelphous, that their complete union at the 
bottom may easily be overlooked ; others, however, have 
only a fissure along the upper side of their common tube, 
without any traces of a separate stamen or stamens.
The papilionaceous character of the corolla therefore, in 
such cases, is made to overrule that of the particular 
mode of union among the stamens, and is in itself so clear, 
as seldom to be attended with any difficulty ; but the 
incorrectness of principle in the system, in the point be- 
fore us, as being neither professedly natural, nor exactly 
artificial, cannot be concealed.
Part of the objections, 
to which the sexual system was originally liable, have been 
obviated.
We mean what concerns the last class but 
-194 
one, Polygamia.
Dr. Forster observed, in his voyage 
round the world, that this class was subject to great ex- 
ception, on account of the trees of tropical climates, so 
many of which are constantly or occasionally polygamous; 
that is, each individual frequently bears some imperfect 
flowers, male or female, along with its perfect or united 
ones.
Such a circumstance reduces any genus to the 
class Polygamia ; and on this principle Mr. Hudson, think- 
ing perhaps that he made a great improvement, removed 
our Ilex Aquifolium, or Holly, thither, though Ilex is well 
placed by Linnaeus in the fourth class.
The author of the 
present essay has ventured to propose a scheme, which is 
adopted in his Flora Britaimica, for getting clear of this 
difficulty.
He considers as polygamous such genera only 
as, besides having that character in their organs of im- 
pregnation, have a difference of structure in the other 
parts of their two kinds of flowers.
Thus Atriplex has, in 
its perfect flowers, a regular spreading calyx, in five equal 
segments ; in the attendant female ones a compressed 
one, of two leaves, subsequently much enlarged.
The genera thus circumstanced are so very few, as far 
as we have discovered, that possibly the class might, but 
for the uniformity of the system, be abolished.
We can- 
not indeed tell what future discoveries may be made ; and 
its character, on the above foundation, is sufficiently clear 
and permanent; for flowers of an essentially different 
configuration, can hardly vary into each other.
The or- 
ders of the last class of the Linnaean system, Cryptoga- 
mia, are natural, and preserved, all nearly the same, by 
every systematic projector.
The original appendix to 
this system, the Palmce, would be a great blemish therein, 
as an artificial arrangement : for such an arrangement 
ought to be so formed as to admit every thing, on some 
principle or other.
But this stumbling-block is now re- 
moved.
The palm tribe were placed thus by themselves, 
merely till their fructification should be sufficiently known.

Now they are found to agree well with some of the esta- 
blished classes and orders, where they meet with several 
of their natural allies.
Whatever advantages might accrue to the practical 
study of botany, from the convenience and facility of his 
artificial system, Linnaeus was from the beginning intent 
on the discovery of a more philosophical arrangement of 
plants, or, in other words, the classification of nature.
This appears from the 77th aphorism of the very first 
edition of his Fundamenta Botanica, published in 1736, 
where he mentions his design of attempting to trace out 
fragments of a natural method.
In the corresponding- 
section of his Philosophia Botanica, he, fifteen years af- 
terwards, performed his promise ; and the same Frag- 
menta, as he modestly called them, were subjoined to the 
6th edition of his Genera Plant arum, the last that ever 
came from his own hands.
The interleaved copies of 
these works, with his manuscript notes, evince how assi- 
duously and constantly he laboured at this subject, as long- 
as he lived.
He was accustomed to deliver a particular 
course of lectures upon it, from time to time, to a small 
and select number of pupils, who were for this purpose 
domesticated under his roof.
What this great botanist 
has himself given to the world, on the subject under con- 
sideration, is indeed nothing more than a skeleton of a 
system, consisting of mere names or titles of natural or- 
ders, amounting in his Philosophia to 67, besides an ap- 
pendix of doubtful genera ; and that number is, in the 
Genera Plantar um, reduced to 58.
Under the title of each order, the genera which com- 
pose it are ranged according to the author's ideas of their 
relationship to each other, as appears by some of his ma- 
nuscript corrections ; and some of the orders are subdi- 
vided into sections, or parcels of genera more akin to each 
other than to the rest.
He ingenuously avowed, at all 
times, his inability to define his orders by characters.
He 
conceived that they were more or less connected with 
49G 
each other, by several points of affinity, so as to form a 
map, rather than a series.
The experienced botanist, 
who peruses the above-mentioned Fragment a, will in most 
cases readily imbibe the ideas of their author, as to the 
respective affinities of the genera.
In some few instances, 
as the Dumosce, where he avows his own doubts, and the 
Holeracea?, where he is unusually paradoxical, it is more 
difficult to trace the chain of his ideas.
Such however 
was all the assistance he thought himself competent to 
afford.
His distinguished pupils Fabricius and Giseke 
fortunately took notes of his lectures on natural orders ; 
and by the care of the latter, to whom Fabricius commu- 
nicated what he had likewise preserved, their joint acqui- 
sitions have been given to the public, in an octavo volume 
at Hamburgh, in 1792.
Nor was this done without the 
permission of their venerable teacher, who told Giseke by 
word of mouth, when they took leave of each other, that 
" as he loved him, he had laboured with pleasure in his 
service ;" adding, that " Giseke was at liberty to publish, 
whenever he pleased, any thing that he had retained from 
his own instructions." 
Linnaeus, according to a conversation with Giseke, 
recorded in the preface of the volume edited by the latter, 
declined to the last any attempt to define in words the 
characters of his orders.
His reason for this appears in 
his Classes Plant arum, where he justly remarks, that no 
certain principle, or key, for any such definition can be pro- 
posed, till all the orders, and consequently all the plants, 
in the world are known.
He has however so far expressed 
his opinion, in the work last quoted, as to point out the 
situation of the seed itself, with respect to other parts, 
and the situation and direction of its vegetating point, or 
corculnm, as most likely to lead to a scheme of natural 
classification.
Hence the system of Caesalpinus stood 
very high in his estimation.
He also, in the conversation 
above mentioned, divides his own orders into three sec- 
tions or classes, Monocotyledones , comprising the first ten 
497 
orders, with the 15th ; Dicoti/ledones (with two or more 
cotyledons), the 1 lth to the 54th order, inclusive, except 
the 15th; and Acotyledones, order 55th to 58th, with a 
hint that the last, or Fungi, ought perhaps to be altogether 
excluded.
This distribution of plants, by the number or 
the absence of the cotyledons, or lobes of the seed, is the 
great hinge of all the professedly natural modes of ar- 
rangement that have been attempted.
We shall for the 
present not enter on the consideration of this principle, 
as it will more properly be explained when we examine 
the system of Jussieu.
Linnaeus did not consider it as 
absolute, for he told Giseke that he knowingly admitted 
into his 11th order some plants that are monocotyledo- 
nous, with others that are dicotyledonous.
The reason 
of this was the only secret he kept from his pupil, nor 
could the latter ever dive into it, though he afterwards 
endeavoured to learn it from the younger Linnaeus, who 
knew nothing, neither did he, as Giseke says, much care, 
about the matter.
We hope to be able to throw some 
light upon this mystery, when we come to the order in 
question.
The want of any avowed principle of distinction, pre- 
cludes all criticism of these natural orders of Linnaeus, as 
a regular system ; we can therefore only take a cursory 
view of them as they follow each other, with such indica- 
tions of their characters as Giseke has recorded, or as we 
may ourselves be able to trace.
A great part of the sub- 
stance of the lectures, published by him, consists of re- 
marks on the genera of each order, as to their mutual di- 
stinctions ; with numerous botanical and even economical 
matters, which do not all come within the compass of our 
present consideration.
What we have to lay before the 
reader, is not, in any manner, forestalled, by what he will 
find in the fourth volume of the Encyclopedia, above 
cited, which is taken from a different source.
Order I.
Palms;.
" An entirely natural and very di- 
stinct order." This tribe of plants, stationed by nature 
VOL.

498 
within the tropics, is considered by Linnaeus as the ori- 
ginal food of man ; still supplying the place of corn to the 
inhabitants of tropical countries.
Palms are the most 
lofty of plants, and yet it is a matter of doubt whether 
they ought to be called trees or herbs.
They do not form 
wood in concentric circles, year after year, like our trees, 
though they are extremely long-lived.
The author of the 
sexual system was, as we have just mentioned in speak- 
ing of that system, but little acquainted at first with the 
structure of the flowers of palms, or the number of their 
stamens or pistils.
His predecessors in the establishment 
of genera of plants, Tournefort and Plumier, had pub- 
lished little or nothing illustrative of this tribe.
He had 
himself seen no more than three or four species in fructi- 
fication, nor had he any other resource, in founding ge- 
nera, than the plates of the Hortus Malabaricus, (excel- 
lent indeed, but not delineated with any particular view 
of this kind,) and the less complete representations of 
Rumphius.
The growth of these plants is quite simple.
Each terminates in a bud, of a large size, called the heart, 
or by voyagers in general the cabbage, of the palm.
When this is cut off, the tree dies, though the growth of 
many centuries.
This bud has a gradual and nearly con- 
tinual vegetation, unfolding its leaves, which Linnaeus 
rather incorrectly terms fronds, one after another in suc- 
cession, not all at any particular season.
The bud there- 
fore is perennial, not, as in our trees, annual, nor can it, 
for this reason, be renewed.
Fresh buds, in time becom- 
ing trees, are furnished from the generally creeping, per- 
ennial, and deeply descending roots.
What have com- 
monly been denominated the branches of palms, Linnaeus 
very properly declined calling so, because they never in- 
crease by producing lesser branches.
He objected to 
calling them leaves, " because they are each attended by 
no separate annual bud, neither have they the texture of 
ordinary leaves, nor do they wither and fall off at any 
particular season." He adopted the term frond, which 
499 
he always used when he could not decide whether the part 
in question were a branch, leaf, or stem.
We cannot but 
think these are truly leaves, though it must be confessed 
they differ from the generality of such, in being destitute 
of any line of separation by which they are capable of 
falling, or being thrown off, from the stem.
In this they 
agree with the foliage of Musci and J ungermannicE, ; there 
being a perfect continuity of substance throughout.
The 
hardened torn fibres, or rather vessels, which remain on 
the stems of palms, where the leaves have once been, are 
precisely the same as what occur in various mosses ; and 
something similar may be observed in many liliaceous 
plants and their allies, which approach to the nature of 
palms.
In describing the fructification of this order, Linnaeus 
considered as belonging thereto, what we should presume 
to be rather the inflorescence.
Hence the great branch- 
ing flowerstalk retains, in a technical sense, the name of 
spadix, derived from the ancients ; and its ample con- 
taining sheath is denominated a spatha.
The latter is 
reckoned a kind of calyx, as the former a sort of branched 
common receptacle.
Linnseus strengthens his terminology 
in this case, by tracing an analogy between the spatha 
of palms, and the glume of grasses.
We doubt whether 
any such particular analogy exists.
Neither does his 
other comparison, of the part in question to the sheath 
of a Narcissus and its allies, at all, as far as we can judge, 
elucidate or confirm his principle.
He surely swerves in 
these instances, as well as in his generic distinctions of 
the umbelliferous plants, from the correctness of an axiom, 
on which botany as a philosophical science depends, 
that generic characters, and much more those of classes 
and orders, should be exclusively derived from the parts 
of fructification.
Surely a very slight consideration of 
the flowers and fruits of the Palmte, as we have become 
acquainted with them since the time of Linnseus, will 
abundantly satisfy any person, that they afford clear cha- 
2 k 2 
500 
racters, on which to found a sufficient number of distinct 
and very natural genera.
Even that author, in the lec- 
tures before us, records that some genera have a three- 
leaved calyx, others none at all ; some have a corolla of 
three, others one of six, petals ; most have six stamens, 
some three, others nine, while the Nipa of Thunberg has 
only one.
The germens are three in some, solitary in 
others, and the style and stigma are subject to like diver- 
sity in different genera.
The fruit is in some, as the 
Phoenix dactylifera, or Date, a single drupa, in others 
composed of three; in some, like the Cocoa, a nut with a 
coriaceous coat.
The seeds are mostly solitary, but in 
several instances two or three in each fruit.
Hence, while 
the fructification affords sufficient materials for discrimi- 
nating genera, Linnaeus observes that no common charac- 
ter, exclusively descriptive of the whole order, can be 
founded upon it.
The reader will find the essential cha- 
racters of his genera in our Vol. IV.
288.
His Zamia, 
concerning which he avowed considerable doubts, chiefly 
because it wanted a spat ha, is now by common consent 
among botanists, removed either to the Ferns, or to an 
intermediate order between them and the Palms, to which 
also Cycas belongs.
The technical characters which have 
induced this alteration, are confirmed by circumstances 
attending the habit and qualities of these genera.
At the end of his proper Palmes, Linnaeus subjoins in 
a distinct section, three genera, which he was doubtful 
whether to leave there, or to establish as a distinct order.
These are Stratiotes, Hydrocharis, and Valisneria.
He 
remarks in his lectures that " they have a spatha ex- 
tremely like the palms ; a calyx of three leaves, and a 
corolla of three petals; leaves perennial and evergreen, 
folded when they first come forth.
Hydrocharis cannot 
be separated from Stratiotes, nor Valisneria from Hydro- 
charis.
They produce their leaves crowded together at 
the base, like Ferns.
Although their strict affinity with 
the larger Palms of India cannot be demonstrated, thev 
501 
ought nevertheless to be associated therewith.
They are 
all aquatics, whence we may presume that India may 
afford some aquatic palms, smaller than the others, which 
may prove a connecting link between the latter and the 
plants of which we are speaking." Giseke points out 
several palms, in various authors, which though but im- 
perfectly ascertained, confirm this conjecture of his pre- 
ceptor.
Linnaeus in his own copy of the Genera Plan- 
tarum, enriched with his manuscript notes, to which we 
shall often refer, has marked this section, or appendage, 
of his Palmce, as distinguished by " an inferior fruit, with 
many seeds." He has moreover added 4 genera to this 
assemblage, Pandamis, Bromelia, Tillandsia, and Bur- 
mannia.
Giseke has amply illustrated the order of 
Palmce, by observations of his own, or those of various 
writers; but the most solid acquisitions to our knowledge, 
in this interesting tribe, are derived from the labours of 
Dr. Roxburgh, in his Plants of Coromandel.
Order 2.
Piperita.
"The plants of this order have 
an acrid flavour, whence the name." They afford no 
common character to discriminate the order, except pos- 
sibly the elongated receptacle and sessile anthers, but 
some amentacece, have the same.
They consist of Zostera, 
Arum, and its allies, Orontium, Acorus, Piper, and Sau- 
rurus.
The last is removed by Linnaeus in his manuscript 
to his 15th order.
OrderS.
Calamakis.
"These are closely related 
to the true grasses, and have almost the same kind of 
leaves.
Their seed is solitary and naked; stamens three; 
style one, not unfrequently three-cleft at the summit.
Their glume is of one valve (whereas most grasses have 
two valves), except Schccnus, which bears several valves 
irregularly disposed, though in other respects so near the 
rest of its order, as scarcely to be distinguished without 
accurate examination of the parts alluded to.
The stem 
of these plants is a culm, mostly triangular, rarely round, 
often leafless, or nearly so.
Leaves rather rigid and rough.
502 
Flowers often disposed in an imbricated manner.
Seed 
in a few instances surrounded with bristles.
When these 
are extended into a kind of wool, hanging out beyond the 
scales, such a character marks the genus Eriophorum." 
Linnaeus asserts that " Scirpus differs from Carex, in 
having all the flowers united, whereas in the latter some 
scales are accompanied with stamens only, others with 
pistils ;" but he forgot the tunic, or arillus, of the seed, 
which makes the essential and clear character of Carex.
He mistakes also in supposing the stamens are always 
three in this order; in several instances they are but two, 
in a few they are solitary.
Much has been done respect- 
ing the genera and species of this order by Rottboll, Vahl, 
Brown, Schrader, and others.
Linnaeus has made a ma- 
nuscript correction in the Calamarice, excluding from 
thence Typha and Sparganium, which he would remove 
to the preceding order, principally, it seems, because he 
judged the latter to be very closely allied to Zostera ; as 
well as on account of its anthers, but we can trace no re- 
semblance in those to the Piperita.
On the contrary 
they and their filaments agree with the Calamaricc.
The 
stamens of Typha indeed are somewhat different, and Mr.
Brown, in his Prodromus Flora Nova Hollandia, has an- 
ticipated this alteration of Linnaeus.
Order 4.
Gramina.
"The true Grasses compose as 
peculiar a family as the Palms.
They are the most com- 
mon plants in the world, making about a sixth part of the 
vegetable kingdom, especially in open situations.
There 
they multiply, and extend themselves by their creeping 
roots, prodigiously.
In confined and woody places they 
scarcely creep, but stand erect.
They are the most im- 
portant of all vegetables, for this reason, that they are 
the chief support of such animals as depend on vegetable 
food.
They make the verdure of our summers, and the 
riches of rustic life.
Their leaves are not easily hurt by 
being trampled on, and though the severity of winter may 
wither and fade them, so that in the early spring no ap- 
503 
pearance of life remains, yet they revive.
The solicitude 
of the Author of Nature, for the preservation of this im- 
portant tribe of vegetables, appears from their flowering 
stems being rendered unfit for the food of cattle, that 
nothing may hinder the perfecting of their seeds.
Besides, 
the more they are cut and ill-treated, the more vigorously 
they grow, propagating themselves proportionably under 
ground ; and in order that they may be enabled to thrive 
any where, their narrow leaves are so contrived, as to 
insinuate themselves between the divisions or branches of 
other herbs, without any mutual impediment.
There are 
very few grasses agreeable to our palate.
For the most 
part they are insipid, like pot-herbs ; a very small num- 
ber being fragrant.
None are nauseous or poisonous.
Grasses are the most simple of all plants; having scarcely 
any spines, prickles, tendrils, stings, bracteas, or similar 
appendages to their herbage." 
"Their stem is termed a culm, being hollow, composed 
of joints which are separated by impervious knots.
In 
our quarter of the world the culm is usually simple, unless 
in consequence of cutting away the flowering part ; in the 
Indies most culms are branched.
The leaves are mostly 
alternate, always undivided, and generally flat on both 
sides, with a rough edge, and either smooth or hairy sur- 
face.
Each leaf stands on a sheath, which embraces the 
stem, and is crowned with a membrane, sometimes termed 
ligula, closely embracing the stem, to hinder the admis- 
sion of water.
The sheath springs from a knot, and (with 
its membrane) answers the purpose of a stipula." 
" The fructification of Grasses differs so much from 
that of other plants, that it was supposed impossible to 
reduce them to scientific order.
They were first distin- 
guished into corn and grasses ; but such a distinction is 
founded merely on the comparatively larger seeds of the 
former, on which we depend for food, as small birds do 
on the very minute seeds of the latter.
Ray was the first 
botanist who undertook a regular examination of grasses.
504 
He distributed them according to their outward appear- 
ances, but distinctive characters failed him.
Neither was 
Tournefort, however great a botanist, equal to the arrange- 
ment of this tribe.
Monti .followed Ray, but investigated 
such only as were natives of Italy.
John Scheuchzer, 
first induced by Sherard, paid a most laborious attention 
to this subject, collecting grasses from all quarters, and 
describing them with the greatest exactness ; but he was 
deficient in technical terms, and his very long descriptions 
are nearly all alike, till he arrives at the flowering part.
The terms which he uses are folliculus for the corolla, 
gluma for the calyx, locusta for the spikelet contained in 
the latter.
After him Micheli contrived a new method, 
dividing grasses according to their spikelets, which he 
observed to be either compound or simple.
He subdi- 
vided them by their flowers being united or separated ; 
and subjoined an order of plants "akin to grasses," which 
really do not belong to them.
If their sexes be attended 
to, the arrangement of grasses becomes less difficult.
They 
are either monandroiis, diandrous, triandrous, or hexan- 
drous.
The two latter have either united, monoecious or 
polygamous flowers." 
"The inflorescence in this order of plants is either 
spiked or panicled.
Their spike, properly so called, con- 
sists of several flowers, placed on an alternately toothed 
rachis, or stalk.
If such a rachis be conceived perfectly 
contracted, it will become a toothed common receptacle, 
as in compound flowers, so that grasses may thus be dis- 
tinguished into simple and compound.
Or if we imagine 
all the flowers to be sessile on one common base, such 
grasses as are properly spiked will have a scaly receptacle, 
the rest a naked one, according to the analogy of the syn- 
genesious class ; and by this means the corn family may 
be separated from the rest, for they are scaly.
" The calyx is a husk of two valves, one proceeding 
from within the base of the other, like the claw of a crab.
These husks arc concave, and truly the leaves of the plant 
505 
in miniature.
The calyx contains one, two, or more, flo- 
rets, which are constructed in the same manner, of two 
leafy husks, called by Linnaeus petals, to distinguish them 
from the former.
Within the petals the receptacle bears 
two very minute, roundish, pellucid, extremely tender, 
withering scales, often invisible without a magnifier, which 
Micheli termed petals, Linnaeus nectaries.
Stamens ge- 
nerally three, in a few one, two, or six with capillary fila- 
ments, and oblong incumbent anthers, whose lobes become 
separated at each end.
Micheli erroneously imagined 
those which have six stamens, to bear, as it were, doubled 
flowers.
The germen is superior, with two styles, some- 
times raised on a common stalk or elongated base, and 
they are usually reflexed to each side, being either longi- 
tudinally hairy, or tufted at the summit only.
Seed 
universally solitary, without a capsule, Lygeum only 
having a nut, of two cells, which is very singular.
A few 
have a simple style, as Zea, Nardus, and Lygeum.
The 
seed is occasionally coated by the petals, which closely en- 
fold it, and are almost united with it, — witness Hordeum 
and Avena ;" (to which examples indicated by Linnaeus 
we may add Briza).
''Many grasses are furnished with 
an awn, arista, mostly rough, like a prominent bristle, 
inserted into the back of the outermost petal, either at the 
bottom, middle, summit, or a little below the latter.
This 
appendage is either straight, or furnished with a joint, 
and twisted backward, or simply recurved ; in some it is 
woolly : in several it is accompanied by hairs at the base 
of the corolla.
The use of these parts is to attach the ripe 
seeds to the coats of animals, that they may be the more 
dispersed." 
" Although grasses are destitute of spines properly so 
called, a few have their leaves longitudinally involute, in 
such a manner that their rigid permanent points have all 
the properties of thorns, as in Spinifex, and some Festucce.
Their foliation is, for the most part, involute, but in some 
instances, as Dactylis ghrnerata, it is folded.
This cha- 
506 
racter has not as yet received sufficient attention, but 
ought to be noticed in future, as it may throw great light 
on the distribution of the family of plants in question.
Very 
few indeed are furnished with setaceous leaves." 
Order 5.
Tripetaloideje.
" Scheuchzer and other 
authors have referred J uncus and its allies to Grasses, 
under the title of Graminibus affines.
In truth, they are 
so similar to grasses, as scarcely to be distinguishable 
without fructification.
The genera are J uncus, Apht/llan- 
thes, Triglochin, Scheuchzeria, E/egia and Restio in the 
first place, then Flagellaria, Calamus, Butomus, Alisma 
and Sagittaria." Linnaeus, in his manuscript, has hinted, 
that the three latter may possibly belong to the above- 
mentioned section at the end of his Palmes; see Ord. 1.
Order 6.
Ensatje.
"So called from the form of their 
leaves, resembling a sword, being perfectly simple, almost 
linear, alternate, mostly converging by the margins, often 
cloven longitudinally, so that the edge of one leaf embraces 
the other, thus constituting what is termed equitant fo- 
liage.
The root in many cases is oblong and fleshy, lying- 
flat on the ground, or creeping.
But some species of Iris 
are truly bulbous, like Crocus, Ixia, Antholyza, Sec. Stem, 
in these genera, simple, erect, zig-zag; but in Commelina, 
especially the annual kinds, it is branched, as in Trade- 
scantia.
Crocus and Bulbocodium have no stems.
Leaves 
usually sword-shaped ; very rarely quadrangular ; in the 
bulbous species of Iris involute ; in not a few Commelina 
ovate ; in Xyris and various kinds of Eriocaulon awl- 
shaped.
Fulcra, or appendages, are scarcely to be found 
in this order.
The calyx is a spalha, though but of 
a spurious kind, being mostly a large concave valve, re- 
sembling a halved sheath in Iris ; most beautiful in Com- 
melina, where it is heart-shaped.
In Sisyrinchium how- 
ever this part is more perfectly bivalve.
Corolla generally 
of six petals ; though in Iris so united by their claws, as 
to constitute a monopetalous corolla.
In Commelina and 
Tradescantia the petals are very distinct, but the three 
507 
inferior being ruder in texture, and smaller, resemble a 
calyx.
Style with three stigmas, except some Comme- 
Una. Pericarp a capsule of three cells and three valves, 
with many seeds ; generally inferior, but not so in Com- 
melina, Tradescantia, and Callisia.
Hence it follows that 
this order affords no certain mark, on which a distinctive 
character could be founded." 
Order 7.
Orchideje.
" Orchis is a most ancient 
generic appellation, alluding to the testicular shape of 
the roots, in many plants of this family, which have, at 
all times, been believed to possess a stimulating or aphro- 
disiacal virtue.
All the Orchidece might be compre- 
hended in one genus, in which light also the Umbellata, 
Semiflosculosa, Papilionacea, might each likewise be con- 
sidered.
But the science would be overwhelmed in con- 
fusion by such extensive genera, which it is therefore 
found necessary to subdivide.
"Many Orchidece have a tuberous fleshy root; not 
properly to be termed bulbous, because its fibres are 
thrown out from the top, or crown, whereas true bulbs 
produce their fibres from the base.
These tubers, or 
knobs, are mostly in pairs ; some of them globose and 
undivided, others palmate, like the hand.
One of these 
tubers, from whence the plant of the present year has 
come, being exhausted, will swim in water ; the other, 
destined to blossom next season, is so solid as to sink.
In the palmate kinds, the former is vulgarly called the 
hand of the Devil, the latter the hand of God. Ophrys 
corallorrhiza however has a threadshaped, branched, 
and jointed root ; that of O.
bifolia is perfectly fibrous.
In other genera, particularly Epidendrum, the root con- 
sists of clusters of fibres." 
" The stem is solitary and herbaceous, except in se- 
veral kinds of Epidendrum, quite simple, often leafy.
In 
some however there is merely a leafless, radical flower- 
stalk, generally round, though not so in Ophrys Loeselii 
and palndosa.
The leaves are simple, alternate, undi- 
508 
vided, sheathing the stem ; sometimes wanting, as in 
Orchis abortiva.
Appendages none at all, except brac- 
teas.
Inflorescence terminal, either spiked or racemose.
Fructification irregular, and very singular, for it is impos- 
sible to say what is calyx, and what corolla ; nor is this 
point of much importance, nature having placed no limits 
between them.
There are five petals ; besides a nectary, 
which makes, as it were, a sixth.
These five seem to 
constitute an upper lip, the nectary an under one.
Or it 
may be said that the corolla is composed of three outer, 
often ruder petals ; and three inner, the lowermost of 
which ought rather to be denominated a nectary.
This 
last is various in different genera, having its appropriate 
figure and dimensions, while the rest of the petals are 
more uniform.
Sometimes the middlemost of the five 
petals, composing the upper lip, (like that of a ringent or 
helmet-shaped flower,) is more erect and dilated ; but I 
have received some species from the Cape of Good Hope, 
in which these petals are united to each other, and elon- 
gated at their common base into a spur.
Such will con- 
stitute anew division or genus, of this family, as it stands 
in the Species Plantarum, many of which have a spur 
from the base of the lower lip, or nectary.
The petals 
however do not afford sufficient distinctions, for genera 
or species.
The former are determined by the nectary, 
which is for that purpose principally to be regarded.
There is indeed no occasion to advert to any other part 
than the flower of these plants, for distinguishing either 
genera or species.
Vaillant therefore, and Seguir, have 
contented themselves with delineating their various flowers 
alone." 
" The stamens consist of two anthers, nearly without 
filaments, very singular, and peculiar to this order, con- 
cealed in a double pouch or hood, but their pollen has 
not been ascertained.
They are ' contracted at the base, 
naked, or destitute of a skin, divisible like the pulp of an 
orange, and covered each by a cell open underneath, in- 
509 
serted into the inner margin of the nectary ;' as described 
in the Genera Plantamm.
It remains therefore for in- 
quiry, whether the anthers burst in these as in other sta- 
mens, and whether the pollen explodes upon the female 
organs ?
or whether there be any internal communica- 
tion between the anthers and germen?" This latter opi- 
nion Linnaeus was inclined to adopt, because, (as he 
thought,) " the pistil was so obscure, that no one was 
able to say whether there were any style or stigma." We 
cannot but remark here that the latter is sufficiently ap- 
parent, in the form of a shining glutinous depression or 
cavity, just below the anthers ; nor is there any doubt 
that the pollen, though different in texture from other 
plants, and various in the different species of these, per- 
forms the office of impregnation by the stigma.
It con- 
sists of naked elastic or granular masses, being what Lin- 
naeus terms the anthers.
" The germen is inferior in the whole order; the style 
short, inclining, in many hardly manifest, in some Ameri- 
can Orchidea very conspicuous.
Stigma either obsolete, 
or funnelshaped, sometimes compressed.
A small gland 
moreover is present, suspected to belong to the female 
organs of impregnation, but not very decidedly." (Lin- 
naeus surely errs in asserting that the sexes of the plants 
in question are very obscure.) " The fruit is a capsule, 
of one cell, and three valves, which last are connected by 
a lateral suture, to which the seeds are attached, as to a 
receptacle.
The capsule does not burst in the usual 
manner, but the valves separate at their lateral sutures, 
while their extremities remain united at top and bottom.
The seeds are numerous, of a chaffy appearance, like 
saw-dust." 
" Many fine species of this order are found in Europe 
and America ; the Cape of Good Hope is not rich in 
them;" (Mr. Brown observed a considerable number 
there ;) " both Indies abound with singular ones, espe- 
cially with Epidendra.
Their favourite soil is a spongy, 
510 
moist, friable, rich, but not manured, earth, in rather 
shady situations.
The species of Epidendrum are all, 
perhaps, parasitical, insinuating their roots into the bark 
of aged trees." 
" Orchidea are extremely difficult of culture." We 
refrain from transcribing the ideas of Linnaeus on this 
subject, as it is now known that some of these plants may 
be propagated by seed, and that several succeed very well 
in our stoves, among the rotten bark of trees, accompa- 
nied by fresh vegetable mould.
Our wild Orchises are 
best removed when in full bloom, when the mould should 
be entirely cleared away from their roots, and the latter 
planted immediately in fresh sifted soil from their native 
place of growth, with moderate subsequent watering.
Thus treated they will come up and flower for many suc- 
cessive years in the same pot.
Order 8.
Scitamine^e.
" These nearly approach the 
Orchidea in aspect.
The name of the order is an ancient 
word, synonymous with aromatic, and answers to the 
whole of the tribe, except Musa, Heliconia, and Canna." 
(The two former certainly do not belong to this order, and 
the last but imperfectly.) 
" The roots of the Scitaminea are fleshy, mostly acrid 
and aromatic, lying on the surface of the ground, and 
throwing out fibres from their under side, like some of 
the 6th order.
Stem always quite simple," (to this there 
are exceptions in Maranta,) "in some bearing alternate 
leaves ; in others naked, and separate from the foliage.
Leaves lanceolate, quite entire, even, stalked, convoluted 
contrary to the direction of the sun ; their stalks sheath- 
ing the stem.
Inflorescence either a spike or cluster, the 
flowers being separated by coriaceous or membranous 
bracteas.
Flower superior.
Calyx a perianth of three 
valves.
Corolla always irregular.
Pericarp in most in- 
stances a capsule of three cells and three valves, with 
many seeds in each cell." We pass over much of the 
Linnaean description, recent discoveries having enabled 
511 
succeeding writers, particularly Mr. Roscoe, in Trans, of 
Linn.
Soc. vol.
viii., and Mr. Brown in his Prodr.
Nov.
Holl., to explain the flowers much better.
The corolla 
is monopetalous, with a double limb, and more or less ir- 
regular ; each limb in three deep segments ; the inner 
most unequal, one of its segments being a dilated, lobed, 
ornamented lip, like that of the Orchidecu, the other two 
sometimes very small, or obsolete.
Stamen one, inserted 
into the tube, opposite to the lip ; its filament mostly di- 
lated, and of a petal-like habit, by the diversity of whose 
shape Mr. Roscoe has first reduced this order into na- 
tural genera, a matter in which preceding botanists had 
altogether failed.
The anther consists of two parallel 
distinct lobes, united lengthwise with the filament, burst- 
ing longitudinally, sometimes spurred at the base.
There 
are usually the rudiments of two abortive stamens, first 
asserted to be such by Mr. Brown.
Germen roundish, 
with a threadshaped style, lodged between the lobes of the 
anther, and a dilated, cup-like, often fringed, stigma.
" To this order belong the Ginger, Cardamoms, Grains 
of Paradise, Cost us, Galangale and Zedoary of the shops, 
all aromatic.
We have nothing similar to them in Eu- 
rope, except Acorus." 
What Professor Giseke has subjoined to the lectures 
of Linnaeus, relative to this order, is, to say the best of 
it, superfluous.
Order 9.
Spathaceje.
" These are distinguished by 
their bulbous root, consisting of a radical bud, formed 
from the bases of the last-year's leaves, which envelope 
the rudiments of the future foliage.
In a bud the scales 
are expanded into leaves ; in a bulb the permanent base 
of the leaves becomes fleshy.
In this order the leaves are 
sheathing at the root, so that they exhibit no instance of 
a scaly bulb, but only a coated one.
Their leaves are, with 
a few exceptions, almost linear, or linear lanceolate.
Stem 
no other than a scapus, or radical flowerstalk, either round, 
two-edged, or triangular.
The spatha, or sheath, is a 
512 
terminal membrane, splitting lengthwise, except in U(c- 
manthus, where it divides into six segments, resembling 
an involucrum, and is permanent.
The spatha sometimes 
contains many flowers, and where it naturally bears but 
one, is liable occasionally to produce more.
The flowers 
are stalked within the spatha; in most instances they are 
superior, but not in Bu/bocodium, whose corolla is divided 
to the very base.
This plant therefore has erroneously 
been referred to Colchicum.
Tulbaghia has a perfectly 
inferior flower, but cannot be referred to Hyaciuthus, on 
account of its many-flowered spatha.'" (The nectary, or 
crown of the tube, abundantly distinguishes it.) "Al- 
lium has invariably an inferior flower, but its spatha shows 
that it belongs to the order before us.
Some of its spe- 
cies bear flowers as big as a Narcissus." 
• The corolla in most of the genera is monopetalous, 
inasmuch as the nectariferous tube bears the petals.
Otherwise they might all be denominated hexapetalous, 
except Colchicum and Criuum; to say nothing of Gelhyllis, 
distinguished from all the rest by its very long tube.
Sta- 
mens six, except in the genus last mentioned, where they 
are twice that number.
Pistil one, except Colchicum; but 
many have a three-cleft stigma, so that in Colchicum this 
part may be considered as only further divided even down 
to the germen.
Capsule in all of three cells, with many 
seeds." (Hcemanthus has a berry.) 
" The roots of this tribe grow best if they are dried 
after the leaves perish, either artificially, or by the arid 
nature of their place of growth.
Many of these roots are 
nauseous and acrid, therefore poisonous, especially Col- 
chicum.
The bulb of a Narcissus will kill a dog.
No 
analogy holds good between these plants and the Tulip, 
whose bulb may be eaten with impunity ; because they 
are not of the same natural order.
All the species of Al- 
lium are impregnated with their own peculiar pungent 
flavour, and nature being disposed to expel them with 
violence from the stomach, they prove most powerful su- 
513 
dorifics.
Much of the substance of these last-mentioned 
is mucilaginous, which involves and separates their acrid 
particles.
Hence they are not dangerous in substance, 
but their expressed juice, deprived of viscidity, is fatal." 
Order 10.
Coronari/e.
" A coronary or garland 
flower was anciently such as, on account of its beauty, 
was used for ornamental wreaths." 
" Ornithogalum has much in common with Allium, but 
wants the spatha.
S cilia is so nearly related to Ornitho- 
galum, that they are scarcely to be distinguished but by 
the breadth " (some say the proportion) " of their fila- 
ments.
Hyacinthus and Scylla are with difficulty distin- 
guishable, though the latter has six petals, the former a 
monopetalous six-cleft corolla, but this is in some in- 
stances so deeply divided as nearly to approach the 
latter." 
" In this order the root is either tuberous, a solid bulb, 
or, as in Lilium, a scaly one.
The leaves of Aloe, Yucca, 
Agave, and Bromelia, are, as it were, a bulb above ground, 
whose dilated, fleshy, permanent scales remain year after 
year; just as the bulb of the Lily consists only of the 
perennial bases of the foliage.
In the Aloe tribe, not 
merely the base, but the whole leaf is perennial.
Who- 
ever is ignorant of this, cannot fail to go astray in study- 
ing the order in question." 
" The stem is simple, often a mere scapus, occasionally 
leafy, in consequence of a partial elevation of the radical 
leaves." 
" The flower, destitute of spatha or any sort of calyx, 
consists of six petals." (Linnaeus terms them such, be- 
cause they fall off when the flowering is over.) " In 
Ornithogalum some species have the under side of the 
corolla green, which part therefore is permanent here, as 
consisting of corolla and calyx united.
In some kinds of 
Anthericum, and in Veratrum, the.
petals are likewise 
permanent, but in a faded condition.
The stamens are 
universally six, three of them interior.
Germen superior.

In Aloe the pistil is solitary, and three-cleft; but the style 
is divided to the very base into three parts in Mefauthium, 
Helonias, Veratrum, and one species of Ornithogalum.
All the tribe have a capsule of three cells, and three 
valves, the seeds being placed one above another." 
" There is no uniformity in the qualities of the Coro- 
naria, there being among them a great diversity of scent.
The nauseous smell of Frilillaria imperialis and Veratrum 
indicates a very poisonous quality, of which likewise Aloe 
partakes.
Lilium is mild; its root inodorous and muci- 
laginous; its qualities therefore are emollient and lubri- 
cating.
Scilla maritima is in the highest degree acrid 
and diuretic, dissolving viscid humours.
The root of Or- 
nithogalum umbellatum, as well as of O.
luteutn, is eatable.
The former appears to be the Dove's dung, sold for so 
high a price during the siege of Samaria, as recorded in 
the Second Book of Kings, chap.
vi.
ver.
25; in the first 
place, because it is very abundant in Palestine, whence 
the English call it Star of Bethlehem ; secondly, because 
the flower resembles the dung of pigeons and other birds, 
in its greyish and white partycoloured hue, whence also 
comes the name Ornithogalum, or bird's milk, alluding to 
the white substance, always accompanying the dung of 
these animals ; and lastly, because the root in question is 
to this day eaten in Palestine, at least by the poor." (See 
English Botany, t.
130.) 
" Wepfer has proved by many experiments, the very 
poisonous nature of the root of the Crown Imperial, which 
kills dogs, wolves, and various other animals.
The an- 
cients relate that the honey of its flowers caused abortion.
No flower, except Melianthus, produces more of this fluid, 
yet the bees do not collect it !
We owe this fine plant, now 
so common, to Clusius, who more than two hundred years 
ago received it, along with the Horse-Chestnut, from the 
east.
He likewise acquired many other bulbs before un- 
known, now become the ornaments of our gardens.
From 
his time no one has taken the same pains.
Certainly if 
515 
any person could travel, for this object, into the interior 
of Persia and the kingdom of the Mogul, he would be 
likely to obtain many superb plants of this order, as re- 
cent travellers to the Cape of Good Hope have made us 
acquainted with so many novelties among the Ixia, An- 
tholyza, &c.
of which Hermann, Oldenland, &c, their 
predecessors, have not mentioned a word.
Tulipa Gesne- 
riana is so called, because it was procured by Conrad 
Gesner, from Cappadocia, whence it has become common 
throughout Europe : its endless varieties are the delight 
of florists, and some of them fetch a high price." 
Linnaeus in his own manuscript has, as we have already 
said, removed JBromelia, TiUandsia, and Burmannia, 
from this order to the Palmes, or at least an appendix 
thereto.
Order 11.
Sarmentaceje.
" Sarmenta among the 
ancients meant unarmed, prostrate, weak branches, una- 
ble to support themselves ; hence this name is applied to 
the order before us, many plants belonging to which an- 
swer to that character, being of a long, weak, trailing or 
twining habit.
The Sarmentacece are monocotyledonous.
They differ much in fructification, and may be variously 
arranged; either by their calyx and corolla; the number 
of their stamens or of their pistils; the nature of their 
fruit; or the inferior and superior situation of their ger- 
men.
Hence it appears that no common character, appli- 
cable to the whole order, can be deduced from the fructi- 
fication." 
" Raiania, Tamus, Dioscorea, Smi/av, Cissampelo?, 
Menispermam and Ruscus, form one assemblage, all ex- 
cept the last having the above-mentioned kind of stem, 
twining to the left, not to the right, except in one species 
of Menispermam.
Such a difference is rare between plants 
of the same natural order.
Smilax supports itself by two 
tendrils, springing from near the base of the footstalks ; 
all the rest are spiral, and without examination of the 
fructification, may easily be confounded.
The above are 
2 l 2 
516 
dioecious, except one or two species of Ruscus." (Cen- 
tella ranged among these in Gen. PL is now referred to 
Hydrocotyle.) 
11 Draccena, Asparagus, Convallaria, Uvularia, Glori- 
osa and Erythronium, compose another section.
The last 
is intermediate, as it were, between the present order and 
the Coronaria.
Gloriosa simplex is a small plant, not 
unlike Erythronium, with reflexed petals." (What Miller, 
who is Linnaeus's sole authority for this species, intended, 
nobody has ever been able to make out.) 
" Medeola, Paris and Trillium have whorled leaves, 
except M.
asparagoides, which scarcely differs from the 
genus Asparagus, except in having three styles instead of 
one." 
Aristolochia, Asarum and Cytinus, nearly akin to each 
other, are removed from this order by the author in his 
manuscript, to the 27th, Rhoeadea, but not without a 
query.
In the same place we meet with what may per- 
haps prove a solution of the mystery, which Giseke was 
so anxious to unriddle, and to which we have already al- 
luded in the beginning of this part of our subject.
Lin- 
naeus has here mentioned Nymphcca, as having in some of 
its species one cotyledon, in others two.
He notes also 
that Menispermum and Aristolochia are dicotyledonous.
Nymphtea however appears to be the great secret which 
the worthy professor told his pupil that he or some other 
person might chance to find out in ten, twenty or fifty 
years, and would then perceive that Linnaeus himself had 
been aware of it.
Accordingly, Gaertner and Jussieu have 
made the same discovery, or rather, fallen into the same 
mistake; describing Nymphaa as monocotyledonous, and 
Cyamus Sm. Exot.
Bot. v.
i. 59.
(their Nelumbo, or Ne- 
lumbium), as in some measure dicotyledonous.
The ex- 
cellent De Candolle, in the Bulletin des Sciences, n.
57, 
published in 1802, has first rightly considered both as di- 
cotyledonous, and akin to the Papaveracea of Jussieu, the 
Linnaean Rhoeadea.
517 
Linnaeus, in his lectures, proceeds to observe, that he 
" wanted to make further inquiry into the cotyledons of 
his Sarmentacea; for though he knew that several of these 
plants were monocotyledonous, he knew two, and did not 
doubt there were more, perfectly dicotyledonous.
Hence 
he suspected the order might be separated into two, in 
other respects very closely related." 
" The roots of all this family are oblong and fleshy, 
except JErythronium, whose radicles are long and quite 
simple ; those of Smilax Sarsaparilla run very deeply into 
the ground, and are sometimes so thickened at the ends 
as to become tuberous.
The stem at first coming forth 
is smooth and leafless, mostly branched, except in Paris 
and Trillium; in some prostrate.
Leaves in every instance 
simple and undivided, sometimes linear, sometimes lan- 
ceolate and acute, or heartshaped, uniform, mostly alter- 
nate ; except when three or more stand together in a 
whorl, and in Dioscorea oppositifolia.
It is rare that al- 
ternate and opposite leaves occur in the same natural or- 
der.
Flowers mostly on simple stalks, Smilax excepted, 
which has umbels; they are drooping, except in Paris.
Stamens universally six, except in Menispermum.
Styles 
three, or three-cleft.
All the genera, almost without ex- 
ception, are deficient in either calyx or corolla.
The fruit 
is generally of three cells.
Inflorescence axillary in all 
except Erythronium, which has but one flower, and Rus- 
cus, where it springs from the leaf." 
" Their qualities are to be judged of by the smell.
All 
of them betray something of malignity, except two in- 
sipid ones which are eatable, Dioscorea and Asparagus.
Gloriosa is very poisonous ; the dried flowers of Lily of 
the Valley cause sneezing, like Veratrum, that is, they 
produce convulsions.
Paris has always been deemed 
poisonous.
One kind of Cissa?npelos, named Pareira 
brava, and Smilax, are known by physicians to be highly 
diuretic, as well as the roots of Asparagus.
Menispermum 
Cocculus kills fishes, lice, and men." 
518 
" This whole order is entirely without pubescence, even 
the prickly Smi laces." 
Next follow the Dicotyledonous Orders.
Order 12.
Holerace^, pot-herbs, (erroneously printed 
holoracece in Gen. PL, which has misled several writers).
" This denomination is given to plants that are tender or 
brittle in the mouth, and easy of digestion, like many of 
the order before us." The order is divided into several 
sections.
Of the first Blitum, Alriplex, Chenopodium, 
Salsola, Salicor//ia, &.c. are examples.
The second con- 
sists of Petiveria, Calligonum, Ceratocavpus and Corisper- 
mum.
Callitriclie was subsequently removed to the 1 5th 
order.
In the third section Axyris stands alone.
Of the 
fourth Hemiaria , Illecebrum, Amariuithus, Phytolacca, 
may serve to give an idea.
The fifth begins with Bego- 
nia, (of whose affinity Linnaeus candidly confesses his igno- 
rance, and to which no botanist has yet found an ally).
Next follow Rumex, Rheum, Polygonum, &c.
The sixth 
section has Nyssa, Mimusops, Rhizophora, Bucida and 
Anacardium; and the seventh Lanrus, Winterana and 
Heisteria; in both which the fleshy receptacle appears, 
where he could trace it, to have guided Linnaeus to an ar- 
rangement evidently paradoxical, which he labours, with- 
out satisfying us, to justify.
Order 13.
Succulemtje.
" Bradley wrote on Suc- 
culent Plants, by which he meant such as could not be 
preserved in a Hortus Siccus.
When gathered, vegetables 
of this nature will live, often for a whole year, flowering 
as they hang up in a house, and throwing out roots after- 
wards if planted.
All such plants, however, do not enter 
into the present order.
Stapelia, Euphorbia, and Aloe 
are excluded.
The Succulents grow, and become very 
turgid, in the driest soil, nor are any found in watery 
places.
If moistened too much they perish, and their 
roots decay.
They afford, in putrefying, a fine vegetable 
mould, whereas dry plants, like heath and fir, scarcely 
yield any." 
519 
Linnaeus has distinguished these into four sections.
In 
the first are Cactus, Mesembryanthemum, Tamarix, and 
others.
Nymphaa, placed here in the Linnaean manu- 
script, as well as in Giseke's publication, was afterwards 
removed by Linnaeus to his Rhoeadecc.
Sarracenia he 
conceived to be akin thereto.
In his second section are 
Sedum and its numerous allies; in the third Portulaca, 
Claytonia, &c.
; and in the fourth a very different as- 
semblage, as we should think, composed of Saxifraga, 
Adoxa, &c.
and even Hydrangea.
Linnaeus however 
thought all these sections nearly related.
"They are," 
says he, " succulent, insipid, inert, and inodorous, there- 
fore mere pot-herbs, widely different from the other fleshy 
plants, Stapelia, &c.
whose fructification is so unlike 
them, and whose qualities are so poisonous.
We find in 
this order, that opposite or alternate leaves is an indiffe- 
rent circumstance.
These plants have no true spines, 
no tendrils, nor climbing stems, neither stipulas nor brac- 
teas." (Giseke well remarks, that Sedum acre is one ex- 
ception to their alleged insipidity, though we can scarcely 
agree with him that Sempervivum tectorum is another.) 
Order 14.
Gruinales.
The best-known genera here 
are Linum, Drosera, Oxalis, Geranium and its relations.
Linnaeus admits also Quassia, Zygophylhim, Averrhoa, 
&c, and his editor inserts, with well-founded doubt, 
Sparmawiia.
Their roots and habits are various.
Calyx 
usually of five leaves, and corolla of five petals.
Sta- 
mens various in number and connexion.
Pistils mostly 
five or ten.
Fruits various.
Linnaeus professed himself 
unable to define the character of this order.
Many of the 
plants have acid leaves.
Order 15.
Inundate.
" So called because they 
grow in water, many of them under its surface, except 
their blossoms." Potamogeton is the genus most gene- 
rally known, to which Linnaeus suspected Orontium to be 
related, but not correctly.
Myriophyllum, Proserpinaca, 
Hippuris, &c.
are placed here, and even Elatine, notwith- 
standing its numerous seeds.
Char a and Najas form a 
520 
section at the end.
Callitriche, Lemna, and even Pistia, 
were proposed to be brought hither ; with Saururus and 
Aponogeton.
'. The qualities of the Inundates are very obscure.
These plants are mostly inodorous, except a fishy scent 
in some ; nor have they any particular taste ; hence they 
are not used medicinally." 
This order is out of its place with respect to the ar- 
rangement by the cotyledons, of which Linnaeus seems 
aware, from the remarks subjoined to it, in his lectures, 
concerning that principle.
To these we shall hereafter 
refer.
Order 16.
Calyci florae.
This consists of Osyris, 
Trophis, Hippoph'de and Elceagnus.
No observation re- 
lative to it is given in the lectures, except that these ge- 
nera are removed elsewhere.
A manuscript note before 
us indicates a suspicion of its relationship to the 6th sec- 
tion of the Holeracea.
Linnaeus sometimes referred Me- 
mecylon to one of these orders, sometimes to the other, 
but finally to his 18th ; we should rather presume it be- 
longs to the 1 9th notwithstanding the definite number of 
the stamens, which caused Jussieu to range this genus 
with the Linn-dean Calycmithema ; see the next order.
Order 17.
Calycanthem;e.
"The title of this older 
is precisely synonymous with the last, and is applicable 
in a different manner to the different genera of which the 
present consists.
In those whose germen is inferior, the 
calyx bears the flower and enfolds the germen ; in those 
where the latter is superior, it is unconnected with the 
calyx, into which the stamens are, in that case, inserted, 
like the Senticoscz and Pomacea, not into the receptacle.
The germen is inferior in Epilobium, Oenothera, Gaura, 
Jussieea, Ludwigia and Isnarda, as well as in Mentzelia 
and Loosa" (or Luasa) ; "in the rest, Ammannia, Gris- 
Itea, Glaux, Peplis, Frankenia, Lythrum, Melastoma, Os- 
beclcia, and Rhexia, it is superior.
Some genera have 
four, others five or six petals.
Glaux and Isnarda have 
none.
Ammannia and Peplis have occasionally petals, 
521 
or not, in the same plant.
Melastoma lias a berry ; the 
rest a capsule, usually of four or five cells, in some ge- 
nera of but two, or one." Linnseus mentions Melastoma 
as the only arboreous genus.
The rest are herbaceous, 
(rarely shrubby,) with opposite or alternate leaves ; sta- 
mens from fourto twelve, pistil always solitary, the stigmas 
either four or one.
"These plants are mostly inodorous and insipid, ex- 
cept a styptic property in the root of Lythrum ; none of 
them are used in the shdps.
It is remarkable in this 
order particularly, that some flowers are sessile and axil- 
lary, but towards the summit the leaves gradually dimi- 
nish, and are finally obliterated, so that the inflorescence 
becomes a spike, as may be seen in Epilobium." 
Order 18.
Bicornes.
"So called," by Linnaeus, 
" from the anthers, which in many of this tribe terminate 
in two beaks.
The plants are rigid, hard and evergreen, 
almost all more or less shrubby ; certainly perennial.
Diospyros is arboreous.
The leaves of this order are al- 
ternate, simple, undivided, scarcely crenate, permanent.
Stipulas and bracteas wanting;" (certainly not always 
the latter).
" Calyx of one leaf, more or less deeply four 
or five cleft.
Corolla usually monopetalous ; in Pyrola, 
Clethra, and their near allies, pentapetalous.
Nectaries 
none, except in Kalmia." (Linnaeus can here mean only 
the pouches which for a while detain the elastic stamens, 
and those are by no means nectaries.) "Stamens from 
four to ten, answering to the divisions of the corolla, or 
twice their number.
Pistil 1 , except Royena, which is 
digynous.
Germen in some superior; in others, as Vac- 
cinium, inferior.
Some have a capsule, others a berry ; 
the cells of each four or five ; but Diospyros has a fruit of 
eight cells.
The seeds are either one or many in each 
cell, mostly small, chaffy." Linnaeus remarks that "they 
can scarcely be raised in a garden, especially as the 
plants are many of them natives of boggy situations ; " 
but our English gardeners are masters of their treatment, 
522 
witness the abundance of Erica from the Cape, now com- 
mon in every greenhouse, and many other charming 
shrubs, cultivated in a peat soil.
He conceived the whole 
order to be nearly confined to one meridian, from the 
North Cape of Lapland, to the Cape of Good Hope ; but 
he is incorrect in saying there are very few in North 
America, and none in the East or West Indies.
llalesia, Styrax, Spathelia, Citrus and Garcinia are 
subjoined as an appendix to the Bicomes, but there is al- 
lowed to be a considerable distance between them, and 
the last is erased in the Gen. Plant, as having opposite 
leaves.
Giseke records, p.
345, that when Linnaeus said 
no Erica grew in America, he asked him whether Hud- 
sonia were not an exception to this ?
On which he took 
that genus from his herbarium, and after contemplating 
and replacing it, wrote something, Giseke knew not what, 
in his Genera Plant arum.
We find what he wrote to be 
as follows : " Videnda Hudsonia, Empetrum, Ilex, [tea." 
It is interesting to be thus able to trace the thoughts of 
such a man.
He was moreover correct .as to the genus 
Erica itself, of which no species has been detected in 
America.
Order 19.
Hesperide./e.
Of this nothing is said in 
the lectures.
The original genera are Eugenia, Psidium, 
Myrtus, and Caryopliyllus ; to which Giseke has added 
Calyptranthes and Legnotis of Swartz.
Melaleuca also 
strictly belongs to this tribe ; though, by a strange error, 
referred in the Mantissa to the 40th order, and yet said 
to be akin in Ginora, which belongs either to this or the 
17th.
Philadelphus is subjoined as forming a section 
by itself, and still with a mark of doubt.
The discoveries 
in New Holland have thrown much light on this fine order 
of aromatic and elegant shrubs, of which the Myrtle is a 
familiar type.
Linnaeus intended to remove Garcinia 
hither.
Order 20.
Rotaces:.
The lectures are also deficient 
as to this order.
It consists of Trientalis, Centunculus, 
523 
Anagallis, Lysimachia, Phlox, Exacum, Chlora, Geu- 
tiana, Sioertia, Chironia and Sarothra ; to which Ascy- 
rum, Hypericum and Cistus stand as an appendix.
The 
wheel-shaped corolla of many of the above plants, has 
evidently suggested the name.
Order 21.
Precis.
Primula and its elegant relatives 
form the basis of this order.
" They are all destitute of 
stems.
Leaves simple.
Flowerstalk umbellate, except 
in Cyclamen.
Flower regular.
Calyx, as well as corolla, 
five-cleft.
Stamens five.
Style one.
Fruit a simple 
superior capsule.
The umbel is often accompanied by 
an involucrum.
They are vernal-flowering plants, and 
have, except Cyclamen, nothing malignant in their quali- 
ties." Limosella stands alone in a second section of this 
order, but rather perhaps belongs to the 40th.
Meny- 
anthes, Hottonia and Samolus form a third section, at- 
tended by a mark of doubt.
Sibthorpia was once inserted 
in manuscript, but afterwards erased.
Order 22.
Caryophyllei.
The Pink and Campion 
tribe.
"Root fibrous.
Stem herbaceous, scarcely shrubby, 
jointed ; its branches commonly alternate.
Leaves simple, 
more or less of a lanceolate figure, undivided, hardly cre- 
nate in any degree, sessile, with no other appearance of 
a footstalk than their elongated narrow base, opposite, 
obvolute.
Stipulas none; neither are there any distinct 
bracteas, nor spines, prickles nor tendrils.
The plants 
are mostly smooth, few are hairy, none prickly or bristly.
Flower rarely sessile.
Stamens never numerous, but either 
the same in number as the petals, or twice as many.
Pistils from one to five, not more.
Fruit a capsule, either 
of one cell, or of as many as there are styles ; the cells 
usually with many seeds, Drypis only having a solitary 
seed.
A few of these plants with separated flowers occur 
among the species ofCucubalus, Silene and Lychnis.
The 
whole order is harmless, without any peculiar taste or 
smell, except in the flowers.
It contains the flores ca- 
ryophyllali of Tournefort, who defined these as having the 
524 
calyx tubular, and the limb of the corolla flat ; but he 
referred Statice and Li?utm hither, which differ widely 
from this order, while his character excludes the Alsine, 
orChickweed, tribe." Linnaeus thought Ve/ezia had been 
wrongly placed here by Gerard, and was doubtful re- 
specting Cherleria; but he was afterwards satisfied that 
both are Caryopkyllei.
He remarks that " the order 
consists, as it were, of two leading genera, or rather fa- 
milies, the Caryophyllus, or Pink tribe, such as Dianthus, 
Saportaria, Gypsophifa, Silene, Lychnis, &c.
; and the 
Alsine, or Chickweed family, consisting of Spergula, 
Cerastiuni, Arenaria, Stellaria, and others.
In the first 
division, the calyx is tubular, of one leaf; in the second 
of five." A third section of this order has Pharnaceum, 
Glinus, Mollugo, Polycarpon, Mimiartia, Queria, Or- 
tegia, Loeflingia ; to which were afterwards added Gisekia 
and Rotala.
Holosteum also, having laciniated stipula- 
ceous membranes, was intended to have been removed 
to this third section.
Scleranthus, by itself, makes a 
fourth, but is erased by Linnaeus, and removed to his 31st 
order.
Polypremum, with a query, stands at the end.
A most extraordinary remark is subjoined by Professor 
Giseke at p.
354 ; that "Alsine media and Holosteum 
umbellatum are one and the same plant," and that " Lin- 
naeus had no specimen of the former in his herbarium in 
the year 1771." Swartz is cited in confirmation, who 
only says in his Obs. Bot.
1 1 8, that this Alsine is a spe- 
cies of Holosteum.
We trust it is better referred to Stel- 
laria in Flo. Brit., and we can affirm that an authentic 
specimen of this common plant, which Linnaeus had when 
he published the first edition of Sp. PL, in 1753, still 
exists in his collection.
The real Holosteum umbellatum, 
a rare English plant, is well delineated in Engl.
Bot.
t. 27.
Order 23.
Trihilatje.
" So called from its three- 
celled, and three-grained fruit, for all the cells are distinct.
Melia however has five cells.
The calyx in this order is 
525 
either of four or five leaves, or of one leaf in five deep 
segments.
Petals four or five.
Stamens eight or ten.
Pistil one.
One part of the fructification is often dimi- 
nished as to number, for instance the petals ; and when 
they become but four, the stamens are only eight.
A 
nectary is always present ; hence the corolla is frequently 
irregular.
The leaves are disposed to be compound, and 
are both opposite and alternate.
The whole order scarcely 
contains anything acrid, except Tropaolum, nor anything 
either fragrant or noxious ; on the other hand, the Tri- 
cocca, properly so called, are highly poisonous." 
The first section consists of Melia, Trichilia, Guarea 
and Turraa ; to which Linnseus has added, from his 54th 
or miscellaneous order, Cedrela and Swietenia.
The se- 
cond is composed of Malpighia, Bannisferia, Hiraa, Tri- 
opteris, Acer, and Aesculus.
Linnaeus was inclined to bring 
hither, from his 14th order, the genus Fagonia, because 
of the likeness of its flower to Malpighia, but he found a 
difficulty in the five cells of its fruit.
A third section 
consists of Staphylea, Sapindus, Paulinia, Cardiospermum 
and Tropaolum ; to which Hippocratea is added in ma- 
nuscript, and a question subjoined, Whether Staphylea 
be not akin to Celastrusl Cavanilles has added many 
new genera to this order, but he is surely complimented 
to excess by the editor of the Pralectiones.
Order 24.
Corydales.
" The title of this order is 
synonymous with Fumaria amongst ancient writers." 
" The genera are Melianthus, Monnieria, Epimedium, 
Hypecoum, Fumaria, Leontice, Impatiens, Utricularia, 
Pinguicula, and perhaps Calceolaria.
The calyx is of 
two leaves; except in Pinguicula, where it is only cloven; 
and Melianthus, where it consists of four leaves.
The 
flower of Fumaria is remarkable in its throat, and uniform 
in that respect throughout the genus ; but the various 
species differ widely in their fruit; which in some, as offi- 
cinalis, &c.
contains a solitary seed ; in capnoides, clavicu- 
lata, &c.
it is a genuine pod ; in vesicaria a large inflated 
52G 
capsule." Monnieria and Melianthus (two very puzzling 
genera,) were thought by Linnaeus to be nearly related to 
each other, though differing from the order under consi- 
deration, in having several capsules, and a calyx in five 
deep divisions.
But he judged the ringent corolla of 
Monnieria to betray an affinity to Fumaria ; while the 
nectary of Melianthus is similar to that of Monnieria, the 
combined stamens of the latter being exactly those of Fu- 
maria.
Hence a relationship is traced between Melian- 
thus and this order, which, but for Monnieria, could not 
have been suspected.
" There is a certain fragility and delicacy of texture 
characteristic of the Corydales, with a glaucous hue, 
which points out their affinity ; as well as a bitter flavour.
Scarcely any of the order are odoriferous, except Melian- 
thus, which is extremely foetid." 
Linnaeus professes his inability to point out any exclu- 
sive mark of distinction for this order.
" The leaves 
indeed are alternate in all, Calceolaria excepted ; and 
many bear stipulas.
Their mode of flowering is spiked, 
racemose, or solitary, their stalk naked or leafy, different 
in different species.
All that we are acquainted with are 
smooth and unarmed ; a very few of them climbing by 
means of tendrils.
Melianthus and Monnieria only are 
shrubby.
All the tribe prefer shady, moist situations, 
where the soil is not disturbed." (Some however grow 
in cultivated ground, as the Fumitories.) 
"The Melianthus, a Cape plant, produces more honey 
than any other plant, so that a tea-spoon full may be col- 
lected every morning, from each of its numerous flowers.
But the offensive odour" (of the bruised plant) "indicates 
a poisonous quality, as in Cimicifuga." 
Order 25.
Putamine/e.
On this order, named from 
the strong rind of the fruit in several instances, there is 
no commentary in the Pralectiones, nor any manuscript 
note in the Gen. PI.
The genera are Cleome, Cratava, 
Morisona, Capparis ; Crescentia and Marcgravia being 
527 
added with hesitation.
Tancccium of Swartz, and Possira 
of Aublet, which last is Rittera of Schreber, are subjoined 
by Giseke.
Order 26.
Multisiliqu^e.
This consists of four sec- 
tions.
In the first are Pceonia, Aquilegia, Aco?iititm and 
Delphinium, to which Linnaeus, after much diversity of 
opinion, finally determined to add Cimicifuga and Actcea.
The second contains Dictamnus, Rut a and Peganum: the 
third Nigella, Garidella, Isopyrum, Trollius, Helleborus, 
Caltha, Ranunculus, Myosurus and Adonis: and the fourth 
Anemone, Atragene, Clematis, and Thalictrum.
"Most of 
the order, with a few exceptions, are of European growth; 
rarely arboreous or shrubby, except such species of Cle- 
matis as climb trees.
The roots are fibrous, sometimes 
tuberous.
Leaves often many-cleft, or compound ; but 
in a few instances simple; all alternate, except in Clema- 
tis integrifolia.
There are no stipulas, spines, nor prickles.
One or two kinds of Clematis bear tendrils.
Flowers in 
no case monopetalous.
Stamens always more than eight, 
except in the second section.
Fruit in some capsular, in 
some single-seeded.
An acrid taste prevails through the 
whole.
Their odour is disagreeable, almost universally, 
so that none is esculent, and many, if not all, are poison- 
ous, though there is no milky plant among the whole, nor 
any one with a twining stem." Linnseus remarks, that 
"a calyx is very rarely present, and when it occurs, ma- 
nifestly originates from the leaves;" but this is not ap- 
plicable to Ranunculus and its nearest relations, nor to 
any genus in the second section ; that section indeed 
being a most distinct order of itself, called by Jussieu 
Rutacecz, but not well defined by him.
Order 27.
Riiceade/e.
The poppy tribe.
No remark 
on this order is found in the lectures of Linnseus, but he 
has made some manuscript notes.
He wished to remove 
it next to the 24th and to place its genera thus, Argemone, 
Chelidoniuni, Papaver, Podophyllum, Sanguinaria and 
Bocconia.
Sanguinaria, he observes, has the flower of 
528 
Avtaa, which last genus he had once brought hither.
He 
has finally placed here Aristolochia, Asa rum and Cytinus, 
as we have mentioned under the 1 1th order.
Numphaa 
also is indicated, but afterwards erased, which is unfor- 
tunate.
Order28.
Lurid^;.
The gloomy family of nightshades, 
henbane and tobacco.
"This order is a most distinct and 
evident one.
All the plants have alternate leaves ; a five- 
cleft calyx ; monopetalous corolla; stamens four or five ; 
pistil one ; germen superior ; seed-vessel of two cells, in 
some a berry, others a capsule.
Their corolla folds in a 
plaited manner." 
Digitalis, Celsia, Verbascum, Nicotiaua, Atropa, Hy- 
oscyamus, Datura, Physalis, Solarium, Capsicum, are ex- 
amples of this order.
"They are none of them arboreous, 
though some are shrubby.
Colour (of the herbage) mostly 
dull and lurid ; the taste disagreeable, smell nauseous, 
hurtful to the nerves, hence their generally poisonous 
qualities." Ellisia is properly expunged in the manu- 
script, and Nolana with equal propriety removed hither 
from the 4 1 st order.
Linnaeus observes, that "the poisonous quality of Ver- 
bascum appears in its power of killing fish, if made up 
into balls with meal." " Nicotia?ia rustica," he says, " fur- 
nishes the Turks with their best tobacco, yet it is not 
cultivated by us, though it grows readily.
Atropa Man- 
dragora, a most poisonous and dangerous plant, becomes, 
under proper management, an excellent and powerful 
medicine," for instances of which Linneeus referred his 
hearers to his lectures on the Materia Medica.
These, as 
Giseke notices, were never published.
On turning to the 
manuscripts used by the professor in that course, we find 
the Mandragora mentioned as " virose, acrid, bitterish 
and nauseous, useful in the gout and colic; the herb boiled 
in milk, and applied to scirrhous tumours, more active in 
dispersing them than hemlock or tobacco.
Three of the 
berries boiled in milk, given to a potter, labouring under 
529 
a dreadful cholic, threw him into a sleep for twenty-four 
hours, out of which he awoke cured.
The ancients gave 
an infusion of this plant in wine, before they amputated 
a limb.
Its narcotic qualities render it very useful in epi- 
lepsy and hysteria, though to be cautiously administered.
Nothing can be more dangerous in a state of pregnancy.
The editor of Hernandez, Hist.
Nat. Mexic.
Book viii.
chapter 28, speaks of this fruit as eatable, without any 
soporific or injurious effect." 
Linnaeus himself appears to have been doubtful about 
Catesbcea, which he has marked as akin to his Dumosce.
Giseke has subjoined an observation, not well founded, 
of the Solandra of Swartz being hardly distinct from Da- 
tura.
Order 29.
Campanaceje.
These Linnaeus has noted 
as most nearly allied to the 24th order.
" They never 
form trees, rarely shrubs.
Leaves in every instance alter- 
nate ; calyx and corolla five-cleft ; stamens five ; pisti.
one, except Evolvulus, which has at least a deeply four- 
cleft style, if not four distinct ones.
Fruit a capsule.
They are milky plants, at least while young and tender.
Their qualities therefore are purgative, and but slightly 
poisonous." 
Convolvulus and Campanula, with their respective al- 
lies, constitute this order.
To the latter Viola is supposed 
to be connected, through the medium of Lobelia.
Par- 
nassia, though in the manuscript rightly said to be not 
milky, stands at the end, its affinity being indicated by 
the nature of the flower-stalk, calyx, as well as the seeds 
and their situation, but especially the nectaries and stigma.
The anthers come one after another and impregnate the 
latter, retiring subsequently in their turns.
Their close 
application to that part, as Linnaeus conceived, rendered 
the access of extraneous pollen impossible, "hence," says 
he, "no more species ^of this genus can be produced.'' 
This alludes to his hypothesis of new and permanent spe- 
cies, or even genera, having been generated, from time to 
VOL.

time, in the vegetable kingdom, by cross impregnation ; 
which we are very unwilling to admit, nor do any of his 
instances prove satisfactory to us.
As to Parnassia, we 
now know several American species, as distinct as those 
of any other genus.
Order 30.
Contortje.
"This order derives its name 
from the corolla, which," (in all the species known to 
Linneeus,) " is twisted in the bud, contrary to the course 
of the sun, its limb being wheel-shaped, when expanded, 
in such a way that each of its segments, unequally pro- 
portioned in their margins, is curved inward under the 
next segment, the shorter side of the former being beneath 
the longer one of the latter.
Europe is very poor in this 
tribe, India very abundant.
Many of the plants are 
milky, and, like most other such, poisonous; some indeed 
so violently, as immediately to destroy animals that eat 
them.
Their medical effects, rightly managed, may be 
very great.
They have all, naturally, an injurious pro- 
perty, even Asclepias Vincetoxicum, though this plant, like 
Nerium and Vinca, is scarcely milky, but in its very 
youngest shoots." (It is singularly remarkable that the 
fruit of one of this family, at Sierra Leone, the size of an 
orange, yields a copious and wholesome milk, used by the 
colonists as cream to their tea.
See Sm. Ititrod.
to Bo- 
tany, ed.
3. 316.) 
" Many of the order of which we are treating are 
shrubby ; the leaves opposite and evergreen, except the 
species of cold countries.
The flower is, in many cases, 
intricate in structure, because of the peculiar apparatus 
of the nectaries of various genera." 
" The roots are perennial.
Leaves all, as far as hi- 
therto known, simple and undivided, and, with very few 
exceptions, opposite ; sometimes ternate, or quaternate ; 
rarely alternate.
The inflorescence is often peculiar, in 
having its flowerstalk not axillary, but proceeding from 
the side of the stem between the insertion of the leaves.
Calyx of one leaf, five-cleft.
Corolla of one petal, regular.
531 
its segments contorted, as above described, and often 
notched in the margin.
Nectaries, in many instances, 
singularly formed.
Stamens five.
Pistils two, or one with 
a double stigma.
Germen superior in all, except Gar- 
denia, Genipa, and Macrocnemwn," (all now certainly not 
admitted into this order.) " The Fruit, in many genera, 
as Vinca, Nerium, Echites, Plumeria, Tabernamontana, 
Cameraria, Periploca, Apocynum, Cynanchum, Asclepias, 
Stapelia, Ceropegia and Pergularia, consists of two di- 
stinct follicles, not observable in other plants.
This sort 
of seed-vessel is like a spatha amongst the other kinds of 
calyx, of one valve, splitting longitudinally at the inner 
edge.
But the seeds are not attached to the suture, there 
being a separate thread-shaped receptacle, extending the 
whole length of the seed-vessel, over the whole of which 
the seeds are imbricated, in a downward position.
In all 
the above mentioned the seeds are crowned with a soft 
hairy tuft, except those of Vinca, which have no such ap- 
pendage.
The flowers of the Contorts are usually very 
handsome, and there is something so singular in the struc- 
ture of many of them, especially relative to the nectary 
and stigma, that it is difficult to say, in many instances, 
whether they have one or two stigmas ; especially when 
two germens seem to bear but a single style.
The corolla 
in all is five-cleft, and the stamens five.
Jacquin contends 
that the latter are really ten.
Linnaeus from repeated ex- 
amination of Asclepias, was confirmed in the former opi- 
nion, and especially from the investigation of Periploca, 
whose flower, evidently constructed on the same principle 
as Asclepias, has, no less evidently, but five stamens." 
Giseke very improperly annexes Embothrivm and Rho- 
pala to this order, only because their fruit is a follicle ; 
nor does any other genus which he, or Linnaeus, has men- 
tioned, really belong to it, except Allamanda, Rauwolfia 
and Cerbera of the latter ; Gynopogon and Melodinus of 
Forster, with Willughbeia of Schreber.
The first has a 
bivalve coriaceous capsule, as if formed of two follicles 
2 m 2 
532 
united, with imbricated seeds; the rest have pulpy fruits.
Most of the other genera referred hither, as Gardenia, 
Cinchona, Portlandia, &c.
belong to the great order of Ru- 
biacece in Jussieu, of which the Linnsean Stellata, No. 47, 
make a part.
It must be allowed, nevertheless, that the 
corolla of Gardenia answers to the character of the Con- 
tort a:.
Mr. R.
Brown, in the Wernerian Transactions, has 
thrown much light on the principal genera of this family, 
under the title of Asclepiadea and Apocinea, with the ad- 
dition of numerous new ones.
Order 31.
Veprecul^.
No explanation of this occurs 
in the Prcclectiones.
The genera are Dais, Quisqua/is, 
Dirca, Daphne, Gnidia, Struthiola, Lachncea, Passerina, 
Stellera, with Thesium, and in the manuscript Scleranthus 
and S ant alum.
These three last do not properly belong 
to the others, which constitute a most natural order of 
generally small shrubs, as the name implies.
They are 
known by their tough branches; silky inner bark; sim- 
ple entire leaves; acrid and even burning flavour; and 
sweet-scented flowers, whose calyx and corolla are united 
into one integument, most coloured within.
Order 32.
Papilionace.se.
An extensive and very 
natural family, " consisting of the Leguminosee of Ray ; 
which Tournefort," (following an idea of Baptista Porta), 
"called Papilionacecc ; Rivinus flores tetrapetali irregu- 
lares ; and Magnol pentapetali.
They have not all five 
petals, for in many the claw of their keel is simple ; in 
some the keel is separated towards the base into a double 
claw; while in a few only, the whole keel is composed of 
two distinct petals, as in Spartiurn." 
" Their character is as follows.
Perianth of one leaf, 
irregular, inferior, generally withering.
Corolla nearly 
the same in all.
Its standard either emarginate or entire, 
either reflexed or not at the sides, for the most part very 
large, compared with the other petals.
Wings, if present, 
always two, opposite, frequently large, sometimes, as in 
Co/utea and Hedysarum, very short.
Keel simple, either 
533 
pointed, obtuse, or abrupt.
Stamens ten, nine of which 
have their filaments united, more than half way up, form- 
ing a membranous sheath to the pistil ; the tenth stick- 
ing closely under the pistil, and being sometimes in- 
serted into the base of the tube composed by the other 
nine.
Hence arise two divisions of the order, without 
attention to which the genera are with difficulty de- 
fined.
Pistil generally uniform; the style downy or 
woolly, either above or below; stigma either acute or ca- 
pitate.
Legume of two valves, which must not be con- 
founded with a Siliqua, or Pod> though old writers have 
so termed it, applying that name equally to the fruit of 
this order and that of the Tetradynamia class.
As these 
fruits differ widely in structure, Linneeus has restricted to 
the latter the term pod, whose character is to have the 
seeds attached to each suture of the valves ; whereas in 
the legume, or fruit of the class Diadelphia, they are con- 
nected with one suture, or margin, only.
The name of 
legumen indeed originally belonged to the seed itself of 
these plants ; but for want of a better \vord, Linnseus has 
applied it to their seed-vessel.
The legume is mostly of 
one cell, containing many seeds ; except Astragalus and 
Biserrula, in which one suture is internally dilated, as it 
were, so as to make a partition, separating the fruit into 
two cells; whilst Phaca has the same part extended only 
half the breadth of the legume, rendering the separation 
incomplete.
Geoffraa has a drupa, which still ought to 
be considered as a single-seeded legume, whose pulp is 
hardened," (or rather, whose coat is made pulpy.) " The 
ripe legume bursts along its sutures, and throws out its 
seeds.
There are indeed some which do not open in this 
manner, but fall off in separate joints, each containing a 
seed, examples of which are Hedysarum and Ornithopus.'' 
" The genera of this natural order so nearly approach 
each other, that it is difficult to detect their discriminative 
characters.
Tournefort, though he distributed other ge- 
nera by their flowers, divided and determined these by 
534 
their foliage.
But Hedysarum forms an objection to such 
a principle of arrangement, because some of its species have 
simple leaves, others ternate, conjugate, or pinnate." 
" Lathy r us, Cicer, and Vicia are genera most nearly 
akin to each other, as are Phaseolus and Dolichos.
Coro- 
nilla, Ornithopus, Hippocrepis, Scorpiurus, Lotus, and 
some species of Trifolium, agree in their umbellate in- 
florescence." (Sophora, and its many new-discovered 
allies, ought to make a section, at least, by themselves.) 
" There is no poisonous plant in this whole order, ex- 
cept the seeds of Lupinus, with which the Hippopotamus 
is killed, and which fowls will not eat.
Indigo becomes 
poisonous in its preparation, but the plant is originally 
harmless.
On the other hand, none of this tribe is medi- 
cinal, except Glycyrrhiza.
Galega, commended as anti- 
pestilential, is not to be trusted.
These plants have no 
remarkable odour," (except in the flowers of a few spe- 
cies.) " Their seeds are flatulent; but afford nourishing 
food for labouring people." 
Order 33.
Lomentacej;.
" These are perhaps all 
shrubby," (or arboreous.) " Leaves alternate, compound, 
at least in the indubitable plants of this order; pinnate or 
bipinnate; without a terminal leaflet, Moringa excepted.
Stipulas always large, particularly to be noticed.
Calyx 
five-cleft.
Corolla in some degree irregular, polypetalous, 
except Ceratonia, and several Mimosa.
Stamens differing 
in number; mostly ten.
Pistil universally single.
Fruit 
a legume, for the most part having transverse partitions.
The leaves fold together at night, except those of Cerato- 
nia, and that in a different manner according to the diffe- 
rent species.
Many of this order possess a purgative 
quality, while some have a virose or nauseous flavour about 
them, but this last is not at all the case with Ceratonia." 
Of Polygala, which stands at the head of this order, 
nothing is recorded by Giseke from the lectures of Lin- 
naeus, nor has he himself made any note.
It surely an- 
swers but indifferently to the Lomentacece.
Genuine ex- 
535 
amples of the order are Bauhinia, Hymeneea, Casalpinia, 
Cassia, perhaps Securidaca ; from which Ceratonia, Mi- 
mosa, Gleditsia, &c.
considerably recede in character, 
though less in habit.
Cercis ought to be ranged with 
Anagyris, Sophora, &c.
either in the preceding order, or 
rather in a separate one, intermediate between the two.
Order 34.
CucurbitacEjE.
" In this order there are, 
properly, no trees.
Some of the plants indeed have a 
climbing, woody, perennial stem ; others a perennial root 
only; whilst others again are entirely of annual duration.
Leaves in all alternate, simple, always accompanied at 
their origin by stipulas.
There are mostly glands, either 
on the footstalks, at the base of the leaf, or on its disk.
All have tendrils, by which they climb if they have 
any opportunity ; otherwise they are procumbent.
These 
plants seem akin to the Sarmentaceee, order 11th; but 
the latter have a twining stem, these not; they are mo- 
nocotyledonous, these dicotyledonous; they are destitute 
of tendrils, with which these are furnished.
The calyx is 
either of five leaves, or five deep segments.
Corolla of 
one petal, in five deep divisions, but so much cut in many 
instances, that it is scarcely possible, but from analogy, to 
say whether it consists of one or five petals.
The stamens 
are inserted, not into the receptacle, but into the interior 
surface of the calyx, to which also the corolla is attached.
Their filaments are often five, but frequently so combined 
as to appear three only.
So also the anthers are often 
connected, the summit of one to the base of another, ma- 
king a continued serpentine line.
The style is of consi- 
derable thickness, with three, frequently cloven, stigmas.
Fruit internally of three cells, fleshy, and somewhat juicy.
The seeds are, for the most part, capable of being kept 
for a long time, though they appear of a dry nature; but 
that they are not really so, is evident from the emulsions 
prepared from some seeds of this tribe.
Gardeners think 
them better for keeping.
The sex of the flowers is, in 
several cases, distinct, and either monoecious or dioecious.
536 
The whole order is noxious and foetid, hence it affords 
some of the most violent medicines, as Colocynth and 
Elaterium.
Even melons themselves, if taken too plen- 
tifully, are said to be injurious, though in ripening they 
part with much of their unwholesome quality." The ge- 
nera are Gronovia, Anguria, Elaterium, Sicyos, Melothria, 
Bryonia, Cucurbita, Cucumis, Trichosanthes, Momordica, 
Feuillea, Zannonia, Passijlora.
" The last affords some 
of the most beautiful of all flowers; many of them are 
fragrant." 
Order 35.
Senticos^.
The briar and bramble tribe.
The genera are Alchemilla, Aphanes, Agrimonia, Dryas, 
Geurn, Sibbaldia, Tormentilla, Potentilla, Co mar um, Fra- 
garia, Rubus, Rosa.
Poteriam and Sanguisorba are in- 
serted at the head of this list, in the Linnaean manuscript.
See the following order.
Order 36.
Pomace/e.
The apple and plum kinds, 
consisting, in the first section, of Spircea, Ribes, Sorbus, 
Cratcegus, Mespilus, Pyrus; in a second, of Punka; and, 
in a third, of Chrysobalanus, Primus and Ami/gdalus.
These two orders are treated of together, in the Preelec- 
tions, it is not said for what reason, though their strict 
affinity cannot be overlooked.
" Many of these plants," 
says Linnaeus, " are shrubs, most of the whole are peren- 
nial, very few annual.
They are rarely smooth.
The 
leaves are alternate, mostly compound.
Stipulas always 
two, large.
None of the plants properly climb, though 
some brambles support themselves on their neighbours.
Their distinguishing character principally consists in the 
receptacle of the stamens being equally that of the ger- 
men, but raised, at the sides of the calyx, above the ger- 
men.
Hence, the calyx bearing the stamens, they are 
calycanthemi.
The fruit is either superior or inferior, there- 
fore that distinction is not always important.
In Rosa, for 
instance, the part in question seems inferior, but is in fact 
the contrary, for the seeds are really inserted into the in- 
ner side of the calyx, exactly as in Mespilus, with this 
537 
difference only, that in the latter they are imbedded in 
the pulp, which fills the calyx.
The segments of the ca- 
lyx are mostly in a double series, the innermost largest, 
the outer alternate therewith, and smaller, answering to 
the petals.
Stamens for the most part numerous, but 
Sibbaldia, Alchemilla, and Aphanes form an exception, 
the first having five stamens, the two last only four," (or 
even fewer).
" The pistils vary in number.
There is 
nothing acrid in the whole order, nor much fragrance; 
there is much of a styptic, little of a mucilaginous qua- 
lity; nothing poisonous; so that if the fruits are worth 
tasting, they may certainly be eaten with impunity." 
Order 37.
Columnifer^.
" So called, not because 
the author meant to express, in the name, the essential 
character, but in allusion to some distinguished examples 
of this order, whose stamens are united into a columnar 
form.
Linnaeus was really the founder of the order in 
question, though Tournefort endeavoured to keep together 
as many of the same plants as possible, under his Mono- 
petali Campaniformes.
But the corolla has five petals, 
though they all fall off" in one body, being connected with 
the combined stamens.
Some have been denominated 
akin to Malvacea ; indeed many of the class Monadelphia 
belong to this tribe." 
" The root in all these plants is fibrous, in no instance 
bulbous or tuberous.
Stem often herbaceous, but there 
are many arboreous, and amongst others the kinds of 
Bombax, or Silk Cotton, almost the largest trees in the 
world.
Some of these only bear spines ; but some spe- 
cies of Hibiscus are prickly.
There is scarcely a perfectly 
smooth plant in the whole order.
They have all stipulas, 
in pairs.
The leaves are alternate, never opposite ; in 
numerous instances stalked ; plaited in the bud; and, 
what is remarkable, many of them have glandular pores 
under the rib.
No tendrils are found in the order.
The 
inflorescence is various.
Calyx in several simple and five- 
cleft, but in some genera double, as Malva, Alcea, A I- 
538 
tinea, Lavatera, Ma/ope, Gossypium and Hibiscus.
Petals 
generally five, but as they often adhere to the united fila- 
ments, the corolla seems monopetalous.
This adhesion 
contradicts the opinion of Vaillant, who has said that 
stamens are never inserted but into a monopetalous co- 
rolla.
Their connected claws often form a nectary be- 
tween them.
The corolla is somewhat abrupt, and twisted 
contrary to the sun's motion.
Pistils usually correspond- 
ing in number to the parts of the fruit; as do the stigmas, 
where the style is simple.
Turnera has as many styles 
as there are cells in the capsule.
The fruit is always su- 
perior, but differs in different genera.
Malva, Alcea, Al- 
thaea, Lavatera and Malope, have numerous capsules, 
ranged like a wheel round the base of the style ; nor is the 
latter placed upon, but in the midst of, them, as in the 
Asperifolice, order 41.
Each capsule is single-seeded, 
and falls off with the seed ; which is likewise the case in 
Urena; such seed-vessels might perhaps rather be named 
arilli, or tunics, as they burst at their inner side.
Many 
of this order have solitary seeds in their cells, or capsules, 
like the above, and the genus Ayenia; but many others 
are polyspermous, as Bombax, Hibiscus, Theobroma, &c.
A few of the genera produce woolly seeds, as Bombax and 
Gossypium ; in the place of which appendage, Adansonia 
has a mealy powder.
Some bear a capsule of five cells, 
containing many seeds; which in Hibiscus Malvaviscus," 
(now constituting the genus Achania,) " becomes pulpy.
It is curious that Hibiscus Moscheutos bears its flower- 
stalk upon the footstalk, like Turnera; a rare circum- 
stance in the whole vegetable kingdom." 
u Hermannia has hooded petals, in a corolla twisted 
like that of Malva.
They are auricled and dilated below, 
forming a nectary by their involution, as the true Malva- 
ceae do by the cohesion, or approximation, of their petals.
The calyx is tumid.
Capsule of five cells.
All the species 
are shrubby.
The flowers' are so alike in all, as hardly 
to be distinguishable from one another ; and hence pet- 
539 
haps it may be presumed, that the various species, all 
natives of the Cape of Good Hope, may in this, as well as 
other genera, have been produced from the hybrid im- 
pregnation of some original one.
H .
pinnata has the only 
compound leaves in this order." We must protest against 
this extensive speculation, of the production of permanent 
mule species, having seen many arise from such a cause, 
but none continue to propagate itself for any length of 
time.
It is not the least curious particular, in the struc- 
ture of the genus before us, that the flowers, which com- 
monly grow together in pairs, have the corolla twisted in 
an opposite direction to each other.
The second section of this order, composed of Camellia, 
Thea, Gordonia, Stuartia, Tilia and Kiggelaria, are at 
least nearly akin to the foregoing genera.
" This whole order contains no disagreeable or hurtful 
plants, nor are they esculent.
None are foetid, but some 
agreeably fragrant.
Many of the flowers are beautiful.
Their quality is generally mucilaginous, particularly Al- 
thaa, Malva and Alcea.
The ancients made considerable 
use of Mallows in their food, but these plants are now out 
of use in that respect." 
Order 38.
TricoccjE.
" Botanists apply this term to 
plants whose fruit is, in a manner, composed of three 
nuts, combined together like that of Thea.
In the order 
under consideration, the seed-vessel is generally a round- 
ish three-cornered capsule, rounded on all sides, with 
single-seeded cells, which bursting elastically, with con- 
siderable force, scatter the seeds to a distance.
It must 
be observed, however, that as in this order some genera, 
like Mercurialis and Cliffortia, are dicoccous" (having 
only two cells, or lobes), " so there are tricoccous plants" 
(as Thea, and many more,) " that do not belong to it." 
u The plants of this order bear alternate, mostly sim- 
ple, leaves, often furnished with glands.
Many afford a 
most acrid milk; they are generally offensive, nauseous, 
purgative, or poisonous.
The style is in several highly 
540 
remarkable, being more or less deeply three-cleft, and 
each of its branches divided.
The calyx, as well as co- 
rolla, have always something unusual in their conforma- 
tion, or in their nectary ; and many of the genera are mo- 
noecious or dioecious." 
" Euphorbia, as a familiar and most distinct genus, 
may serve as a principal example.
It is certainly no less 
singular than extensive.
The calyx of one inflated leaf 
has four or five marginal teeth, and terminates in as many 
abrupt coloured glands.
The latter are remarkably situ- 
ated on the teeth themselves; but these teeth seem, to- 
gether with their glands, to be rudiments of petals.
In 
Euphorbia corollata the glands are actual petals, as thin, 
expanded, and delicate, as those of Flax ; but scarcely 
another instance is known, of petals originating in teeth 
of a calyx." 
" Plukenetia, a very rare plant, has a four-cleft flower, 
and four-celled fruit, with a climbing stem." 
There are numerous genera besides.
Rumphia and 
Treivia are added to the list in the Linnaean manuscript.
Order 39.
Siliquos.^.
" All botanists have acknow- 
ledged the common affinity of the genera constituting 
this order, and have denominated them Siliquosa and Si- 
licatoses.
Tournefort called them cruciform flowers ; 
Linnseus, Tetr adynamia.
These plants have mostly in- 
versely-heartshaped cotyledons, except some Cresses, in 
which those organs are three-cleft ; the rest agree with 
the genus Convolvulus ; so this character is no proof of 
affinity." 
" The stems are herbaceous, except some species of 
Alyssum, and one Vella.
There is no real tree among the 
whole.
The roots are all fibrous, none bulbous or tu- 
berous," (except perhaps Derttaria.) " Leaves univer- 
sally alternate, without stipulas, tendrils, prickles, or ve- 
nomous stings.
Inflorescence usually a corymbus, which 
gradually elongates itself into ixracemus, so that the flowers 
are corymbose, and fruit racemose.
Calyx always of four 
541 
leaves, deciduous, except u\Alyssum calycinum and Bras- 
sica Erucastrum.
Petals four, with claws ; some species 
of Lepidium and Cardamine only having flat, or straight 
petals.
The receptacle in most, but not in all, is furnished 
with glands.
Stamens six, the two opposite ones shorter, 
or at least more spreading." (A very few species have 
only four or two stamens.) " Fruit commonly a pod, 
with two valves, two cells, and many seeds.
A few ge- 
nera have a solitary seed, either imbedded in pulp, as 
Crambe ; or in a lamellated flat seed-vessel, as Isatis ; or 
in an angular one, as Buiiias." 
" The plants of this order are distinguishable into Si- 
liquosa and Siliculosa, the former having an oblong, the 
latter a rounded pod.
But it being difficult to define the 
precise limits of each, Linnaeus refers to the Siliguosce 
such as have a stigma without a style, and to the Silicu- 
los<z such as have a style to elevate the stigma, which 
character is conspicuous in every instance, except in 
Draba, where the style is but short." 
" It is of importance to observe whether the calyx in 
the present order be closed or spreading ; that is, whether 
the leaves composing that part be parallel, so that their 
sides touch each other," or horizontally distant." 
" The nature of a Siliqua, or Pod, appears from what 
has been already mentioned.
It differs from a Legume, 
in having the seeds attached to each suture, or margin." 
" All these plants have a more or less acrid watery 
juice ; hence their external application excites redness in 
the skin, and their internal use irritates the finer fibres.
Nature therefore is solicitous to expel them, and, in con- 
sequence of their watery nature, by the kidneys, hence 
they are all diuretic.
Salt, being of a corrosive quality, 
produces scurvy ; but salt is secreted from the body by 
the promotion of urine, though it must first be dissolved 
in a watery menstruum ; consequently the herbs in ques- 
tion rank among the chief antiscorbutics, especially water- 
cresses and scurvy-grass.
They ought never to be used 
542 
in a dried state, as their acrimony and medical virtues are 
destroyed by drying.
Boiling likewise is destructive of 
acrimony, especially in these plants ; they ought there- 
fore to be taken recent.
Their diuretic powers render 
them eminently serviceable for evacuating water in the 
dropsy.
Yet their use ought not to be too long conti- 
nued, as their acrimony abrades the minuter fibres, ren- 
dering the vessels, and the intestines, in a manner, cal- 
lous.
This appears from the rigidity and torpidity of 
stomach induced by too much use of mustard." 
" There is scarcely any thing odoriferous about these 
plants, except in their flowers.
When they are bruised, 
indeed, something volatile ascends, of an acrid, rather 
than odorous nature, irritating the coats of the nerves, 
and inducing spasms, which do not originate in the me- 
dullary substance of the nervous system, but in its coats." 
No alteration or addition respecting the genera of the 
Tetradynamia occurs in the Linnaean manuscript.
Order 40.
Person ATiE.
There is no commentary 
on this order in the lectures of Linnaeus.
Giseke has 
given a synoptical arrangement of the genera, according 
to the shape of the corolla, which is not in every part pre- 
cisely correct.
He justly expresses his doubts respecting 
Melaleuca, of which we have spoken under the 19th 
order ; and he truly observes that there is no order in 
which so many genera are named after botanists as in the 
present.
The only manuscript additions or corrections, which 
occur in the Genera Plant arum of Linnceus, are the fol- 
lowing : Martynia, Craniolaria, Torenia and Scrophu- 
laria are pointed out as akin to Pedalium, in order 28th ; 
Hyobanche, hinder nia, Paderota, Manulea, Premna and 
Calceolaria are inserted, with a question, certainly not 
well founded, whether the latter should not rather be re- 
ferred to the 24th order.
Brunfelsia also is placed among 
the Personatcc, at the suggestion of Van Royen.
Order 41.
Asperifolije.
" These plants were first 
543 
• 
collected into an order by Gaesalpinus, and received the 
above appellation from Ray, because of their generally 
harsh or rough habit.
Their root is fibrous.
Cotyledons 
two.
Stem branched ; the branches alternate and round.
Leaves alternate, simple ; neither divided nor compound, 
for the most part nearly entire, rough with rigid scattered 
hairs; convolute before they expand.
Stipulas none; 
nor are there, except very rarely, any other fulcra, or ap- 
pendages.
Common flowerstalk having the flowers ranged 
along one side.
Before flowering it is rolled spirally 
backwards, gradually expanding as the flowers are ready 
to open, and divided into two parts, each bearing the 
flowers on its back, in the form of an unilateral spike.
Calyx in five divisions.
Corolla inferior, of one petal, 
regular except in Echium, five-cleft ; its mouth either fur- 
nished with vaulted valves, or crowned with teeth, or 
naked.
Stamens five, equal ; in Echium only they are 
unequal.
Fruit superior.
Germens four, naked, except 
in Cynoglossum, Tournefortia, and Nolana ; inserted in o 
the receptacle by their base ; hence the lowest part of 
each seed is of a tapering form, as if artificially rounded.
Pistil one.
Style not standing upon the germens, but 
occupying the central space between them ; often divided 
into two equal parts ; not one longer than the other as in 
the class Didynamia.
Seeds four, rarely combined into 
two ; but it is singular that Nolana has five seeds." Lin- 
naeus has, as already mentioned, removed this genus to 
his Lurida, order 28th.
" The Asperifolia are distributed according to the 
mouth, or throat, of their corolla, which is naked, or per- 
vious, in Echium, Pulmonaria, Lithospermum, Heliotro- 
pium, Cerinthe, and Onosma ; toothed in Symphytum and 
Borago ; closed with vaulted valves in Cynoglossum, 
Asperugo, Anchusa, Lycopsis, Myosotis, and Tourne- 
fortia.'' 
In the Gen. Plant.
Messerschmidia, Coldenia, Hydro- 
phyllum, and Ellisia are inserted in manuscript.
544 
" All the Asperifolia are mucilaginous, and act only 
as such.
The ancients selected their four cordial flowers 
out of this order, seeming not to have been aware that 
the motion of the heart depends upon the nerves, which 
therefore must be strengthened if the force of the heart 
is to be increased.
This end however is not to be at- 
tained by either the flowers or the herbs of this tribe, 
which nevertheless have long been used for the purpose.
The leaves may be eaten as food, by which their small 
medical use may be estimated.
The root is perennial 
and mucilaginous ;" (we would rather say, " if perennial, 
is mucilaginous," which perhaps were the original words 
of the lecture.) "Among the whole, Symphytum abounds 
most with mucilage, equalling, in quantity as well as 
quality, the monadelphous plant Althaa in this respect.
Symphytum tuberosum has been recommended in the 
gout.
Possibly its mucilaginous quality may hinder the 
crystallization of the gouty matter.
The root in almost 
all the Asperifoliff, is red, but for the most part externally 
only.
The root of Lithospermum tinctorium, now Anchusa 
tinctoria, is used for its colouring properties.
Of all 
plants, the herbs of this order yield the largest proportion 
of ashes.
There is hardly an odoriferous, nor one fra- 
grant, herb in the whole tribe ; though Cynoghssum has 
a somewhat foetid scent.
Their taste is nothing, the 
great quantity of mucilage involving the stimulating par- 
ticles.
These herbs are esculent, especially when young 
and tender, although their rough surface renders them 
less agreeable to delicate palates.
They generally grow 
in dry mountainous situations ; and it is singular that in 
proportion as they are found nearer to water, they become 
smoother." 
Order 42.
Verticillatje.
"Ray, in constructing 
his system, founded three classes, which all succeeding 
botanists hitherto have approved, the Stellata, Asperi- 
folia, and Verticillata; but he was unable to give proper 
characters of the genera.
Hermann subsequently, esta- 
515 
blishing a system upon the fruit, called the Verticillata 
of Ray Gymnotetrasperma , plants with four naked seeds, 
but he could not by this means distinguish them from the 
Asperifolia, which have the same character.
The gene- 
rality of Asperifolia, in fact, differ from the Gymnotetra- 
sperma, in their corolla, which in the former is regular, in 
the latter irregular, though likewise monopetalous.
But 
Eckium, though it belongs to the Asperifolia, has still an 
irregular corolla.
The Asperifolia have alternate leaves, 
the Gymnotetrasperma opposite ones.
These classes 
might therefore be distinguished from each other, accord- 
ing to Hermann's method, were not Echium an obstacle.
Linnseus, however, that he might avoid all confusion be- 
tween the orders in question, has borrowed a character 
from the stamens, and has referred to his class Didynamia 
such plants as have two stamens longer, and two shorter.
He has moreover divided that class into two orders, the 
first of which comprehends Hermann's Gymnotetrasperma, 
whose stamens easily distinguish them from the Asperi- 
folia;.
But the consideration of the stamens has further 
obliged the author of the sexual system to refer certain 
genera, of the natural order under our present considera- 
tion, to his class Diandria.
These are Verbena, Lycopus, 
Amethystea, Ziziphora, Cunila, Monarda, Rosmarinus, 
Salvia, and Collinsonia ; of which Verbena and Collin* 
sonia perhaps ought rather to be placed in the other order 
of the Didynamia, called Angiospermia." This is cor- 
rect with regard to Verbena only.
" The calyx of the Verticillata is of one leaf, inferior.
Corolla of one petal, irregular, in most instances gaping, 
with two lips, the uppermost of which was called by Ri- 
vinus the galea, or helmet, the lowermost the barba, or 
beard.
Stamens four, except in the several genera just 
mentioned, where they are only two, inflexed, ascending 
under the upper lip.
Germens four, from between which 
the style arises, as in the Asperifolia, which is wavy, so- 
VOL.

546 
litary, except in Perilla, where there are two, and bearing 
two acute stigmas.
Seeds four, naked, Prasium excepted, 
whose seeds have a succulent skin, causing them to re- 
semble berries.
A berry, properly speaking, is a seed- 
vessel ; but in Rosa it is the calyx, in Fragaria the re- 
ceptacle, and in Prasium the skin of the seeds." 
" Many of this order are humble shrubs, none are trees, 
most of them are annual or perennial herbs.
The stem 
is generally square.
Leaves in every instance opposite, 
simple, mostly undivided.
None of the plants are fur- 
nished with tendrils, nor of a climbing nature.
The scent 
of nearly all of them is highly fragrant, the odoriferous 
matter being contained in minute cells, which, when the 
leaves are held against the light, appear like numerous 
perforations." 
"The flowers usually stand in whorls, encircling the 
stem as with a ring.
When these whorls approach very 
closely together, the stems appear spiked, as in Ori 
ganum." 
" This order is in the highest degree natural ; whence 
arises great difficulty in determining the genera.
Lin- 
naeus has derived a character from the calyx, according 
to which the whole order is divided into two sections." 
" The first of these comprehends such as have a five- 
cleft calyx, that is, where all the teeth of this part are 
nearly of equal size and shape.
The second consists of 
those with a two-lipped calyx, which is indeed five-cleft, 
but its two upper segments are, in a manner, united into 
one, which might almost be termed emarginate only ; 
while between these two united segments and the remain- 
ing three, there is so deep a fissure, at each side, that the 
calyx is nearly divided into two parts, or lobes.
Linnaeus 
has bestowed great attention in searching for the essen- 
tial characters of genera in this natural order, and has 
detected several, which are marked in the Systema Vege- 
tabilium with a sign of exclamation." 
547 
Order 43.
Dumosje.
" Dumus and nemus are syno- 
nymous, meaning a thicket ; or wood consisting of shrubs, 
not of large trees.
All the plants of this order are shrubby, 
but none of them, except in the genera of Sideroxylum 
and Chrysophyllum, grow to large trees." 
" Rhamnus is supposed to be familiar to everybody.
Its calyx is tubular, five-cleft at the margin, occasionally 
coloured, like a corolla, but not perforated at the bottom.
A monopetalous corolla falls off, with a perforated tube ; 
which is not the case here.
But betwixt every two seg- 
ments of the calyx is stationed a delicate little scale, which 
any person might easily take for so many petals.
The 
stamens however, being placed under each scale, are 
therefore alternate with the divisions of the calyx; whereas 
ifthese scales were real petals, the stamens ought, by a 
general rule, to be alternate with them, and not with the 
parts into which the calyx is divided.
Some species, as 
the Buckthorn, R.
catharticus, have four-cleft flowers, 
but they are mostly five-cleft.
This last-mentioned, like 
JR.
alpimis, is dioecious ; Zizyphus is polygamous.
The 
stigma in some Rhamni is emarginate, in others three- or 
four-cleft.
The fruit of this genus is various ; a berry in 
some with four seeds, in others, as Paliurus and Alaternus, 
with three ; in others again it has a single seed with two 
cells, as in Zizyphus.
Paliurus has not, properly, a berry, 
but a depressed, bordered, shield-like capsule.
The stem 
in some is thorny, in others prickly, in others unarmed." 
" French botanists have recommended the dividing of 
this genus into several, a measure which appears highly 
proper to those who have not seen the Indian species.
If 
such genera are to be distinguished by their fruit, species 
most resembling each other will be put asunder, and widely 
different ones brought together, as any person making the 
experiment will find.
Besides, the structure of the flower, 
and the habit of the plants, are respectively so alike in 
all the species in question, and so different from all the 
2n2 
/ 
548 
rest of the order, that any peasant might perceive their 
affinity." 
" Phylica agrees in almost every point with Rhammis, 
except that its flowers are aggregate, and florets superior.
This genus is so nearly akin to Brunia, that without see- 
ing the fruit, which very rarely occurs, they can scarcely 
be distinguished.
Phylica radiata therefore, universally 
esteemed a Phylica, proves, on the detection of its fruit, 
to be a Brunia.
" 
11 Ceanothus, with its three-lobed fruit, like that of 
Rhamnus Alaternus, agrees in every character with Rham- 
nus ; but the scales of that genus are here drawn out into 
vaulted petals, supported by long claws." 
" Buttneria differs in hardly any respect from Rham- 
nus, except its anthers; for the calyx, prickles, and every 
thing else, answer so well, that at first sight one would 
decidedly take it for a species thereof." 
" Sideroxylum has a five-cleft calyx, and at the same 
time a monopetalous corolla ; but between all the seg- 
ments of the latter stands a little serrated tooth, analogous 
to the scales of Rhamnus.
The flowers are likewise ses- 
sile on the stem, but the berry has only one seed." 
" Chrysophyllum is so nearly akin, and so similar, to 
Sideroxylum, as hardly to be distinguishable by its ge- 
neral aspect; but its fruit contains many seeds, though 
indeed they are disposed in a circle." 
" Achras differs from Chrysophyllum in having a six- 
cleft flower ; and to this genus Prinos is very nearly re- 
lated, differing in the flat form of the corolla, and fewer 
cells of the fruit." 
" Ilex so nearly accords with the last-mentioned genus, 
that the only Prinos then known was originally taken for 
an Ilex ; but the flower of Ilex is four-cleft, not six-cleft." 
" Tomex and Callicarpa only differ from Ilex in having 
a single style, and not four stigmas.
The berry of Calli- 
carpa is like that of Ilex.
In Tomex the stamens are in- 
549 
serted into the receptacle, whereas in Callicarpa they are 
attached to the tube of the monopetalous corolla." These 
genera have since been united by the author himself.
" Euonymus is so nearly allied to Tomex, as scarcely 
to be distinguishable, except by having a capsule instead 
of a berry.
Its seeds moreover have a pulpy tunic." 
" Celastrus, though differing from Euonymus in having 
alternate leaves, is so much akin to that genus, as to 
have been called Euonymus by all systematic writers.
Yet its fruit differs in number and proportion from Euo- 
nymus, just as Peganum does from Ruta.
The tunic of 
the seeds however, though not pulpy, confirms the affinity 
to which we allude.
Some botanists, especially the 
French, are unwilling to admit plants with opposite leaves 
and alternate ones into the same natural order, and they 
are right; yet this character is not absolute, for such a 
difference often occurs in one and the same genus." 
" Viburnum and Cassine come so near together, that 
there is rather a question respecting the distinction of the 
genera themselves, than of their natural order.
Cassine 
has three seeds, Viburnum one, which seems two com- 
bined.
The former is akin to Sambucus, and, like that 
genus, emetic in quality.
Concerning the affinity of Vi- 
burnum to Ilex and Callicarpa, any person, who considers 
their fructification and habit, can have no doubt.
Thus 
far therefore the matter is clear." 
" Sambucus may excite some mistrust, because of its 
inferior fruit; yet this is the case in Phylica, about which 
nobody has ever doubted.
The leaves, aspect, and sti- 
pulas indeed seem to indicate something extraneous, and 
leave us in uncertainty." 
"So Rhus has much the same sort of fructification, 
and a berry with one seed ; as well as the closest affinity 
to Sambucus, insomuch that if Sambucus be kept in this 
order, Rhus must accompany it.
So also must the sister 
shrubs Schinus and Fagara." 
"The Dumosa all agree in malignant qualities.
They 
550 
are either purgative, or altogether poisonous, as Sideroxy- 
lum is known to be at the Cape.
Nor are the species of 
Sambucus clear of this charge, for their qualities are either 
nauseous or foetid, and therefore sudorific, especially the 
berries and flowers.
The bark, taken internally, is either 
emetic, or powerfully purgative, as its vinous infusion 
proves in the dropsy ; externally it is a powerful repellent." 
" Rhus is the most venomous of trees, particularly its 
American three-leaved species, called Toxicodendra, or 
Poison-trees.
Their fumes in burning are said to have 
proved mortal, and their effluvia to have blinded an artist 
who was at work upon some of the wood.
Those who, 
being in a perspiration, hold a branch of one of these 
shrubs in the hand, are seized with an eruption over the 
whole body." 
"The bark of Rkamnus Frangula is our best indigenous 
purge, and a syrup of Rhamnus catharticus is safely used 
for children." 
" In this tribe, therefore, some have opposite, others 
alternate, leaves, nor is any general character to be de- 
rived from the parts of fructification.
The corolla affords 
none, being either of one or five petals, or altogether ab- 
sent, as appears from a contemplation of the characters of 
the different genera.
No mark is to be obtained from 
the nature of the fruit, that being either a berry, drupa, 
or capsule.
The seeds in some instances are solitary, in 
others numerous, though never more than one in each 
cell ; and it is well worthy of observation that they are 
attached, as in the Gymnotetrasperma, by their base.
These plants betray some affinity to the Tricocca, but can 
never be referred to the same order." 
In the Linnsean manuscript before us, Diosma and Har- 
togia are introduced between Callicarpa and Euonymus ; 
— see our remark on the 26th order.
Staphylea is also 
subjoined, near Celastrus, but with two marks of doubt, 
and a note of its having a nectary, as well as opposite 
leaves.
551 
Order 44.
Sepiaiuje.
" All these are shrubby or ar- 
borescent.
Leaves opposite, with scarcely any evident 
stipulas.
Flowers disposed in a more or less dense pa- 
nicle.
Calyx four-cleft.
Corolla four-cleft, regular.
Sta- 
mens two.
Pistil one, with a cloven stigma.
Fruit either 
a drupa, with one, two, or many, seeds, or a capsule." 
No manuscript remark occurs here, nor is there any 
observation worth copying in the lectures, except that 
Oka is said by Linnaeus to be scarcely a distinct genus 
from Phillyrea.
Order 45.
Umbellate.
''The name of this order is 
derived from the form of its inflorescence, whose stalks 
all spread from a centre, like the ribs of an umbrella." 
" These plants are either perfectly umbellate or not.
The former are required to have a compound umbel, each 
stalk, or ray, of which ends in a receptacle, producing 
other stalks bearing flowers, or florets ; the latter have a 
simple umbel, whose stalks are not subdivided.
The lat- 
ter constitute a separate section in Tournefort's system.
They are comprehended by Linnaeus in one natural order 
with the former." 
" An umbel is properly a receptacle of a compound 
flower, elongated into stalks; which manifestly appears 
in Eryngium, whose florets are united into a head, just 
like the proper compound flowers, — see the 49th order ; 
nor are they supported by elongated stalks.
Hence an 
umbel may accurately be considered as a compound 
flower.
Those who controvert the opinion of Linnaeus in 
this point contend, that many umbellate plants, having 
male and hermaphrodite flowers in the same species, 
ought to be placed in his class Polygamia.
But this is 
a mistake ; for no other plants ought to find a place in 
that class, than such as have distinct male, or female, as 
well as hermaphrodite, flowers, in the same species.
This 
is not the case with the Umbellatce, in which all the flo 
rets of one universal umbel, that is, the whole umbel it- 
self, constitutes but one flower, and this flower is never 
552 
altogether barren, that is, its florets are never entirely 
male.
On the contrary, these florets are to be considered 
as the parts of a compound flower; and there being male 
and hermaphrodite ones intermixed, is exactly a parallel 
case with the polygamy of the Syngenesious class." 
" This order is eminently natural, though all plants 
which bear umbels do not belong to it, but only those with 
five stamens, two styles, and two seeds." 
" The germen is inferior, simple, solitary, separating, 
when arrived at maturity, into two equal naked seeds ; 
each of which is furnished with a thread, inserted into its 
summit.
These two threads combine to form a very slen- 
der receptacle, at the top of the stalk of the floret.
Each 
floret has a superior perianth, with five teeth, which is 
often so small as scarcely to be discerned, even with the 
help of a magnifier.
Petals five, caducous, often unequal ; 
hence Rivinus referred these plants to his class of penta- 
petalous irregular flowers.
Stamens five, inserted into 
an elevated annular or circular receptacle, that surrounds 
the pistils, deciduous.
Styles two, often very short, and 
hardly visible.
Seeds naked, without any seed-vessel." 
" The stem is mostly hollow, sometimes filled with 
spongy pith ; rarely shrubby, very rarely arboreous, of 
which last character Phyllis is the only example, — see 
order 47.
Leaves generally alternate, and repeatedly 
compound.
Root mostly quite simple ; in Oeiianthe tu- 
berous, in Batiium Bulbocastamim globose." 
" Nothing is more arduous than to distinguish the ge- 
'nera of umbelliferous plants by appropriate characters.
Tournefort himself, who excelled in the knowledge of this 
tribe," (perhaps Linnaeus meant rather to say, in the dis- 
crimination of genera, but his auditors did not take his 
words accurately,) " has distributed them according to the 
shape and size of their seeds.
But this is a very falla- 
cious mode, as the seeds often differ much in proportion, 
though not in any other respect.
Morison wrote an entire 
book on umbellate plants ; but with little success, their 
553 
genera not being, as yet, established.
Artedi first paid 
attention to the involucrum, which is either universal as 
well as partial, or only partial, or entirely wanting.
This 
principle has likewise been adopted, as fundamental, by 
Linnaeus, and his three primary divisions are regulated 
accordingly.
The inequality of the petals affords him a 
principle for his leading subdivisions, some of the umbel- 
liferous family having the outermost petals of their exter- 
nal florets larger than the rest ; while in others all the 
petals are equal.
The former are termed radiant flowers.
Another subdivision is taken from the sex of the florets.
Some of these, having no germen, are furnished with sta- 
mens only; and such florets are termed abortive; others, 
having both germen and stamens, bring their fruit to per- 
fection, and are therefore denominated fertile." 
On these principles Linnaeus has arranged the umbel- 
late plants, as maybe seen in his works.
Nothing occurs 
in his manuscript, except the insertion of Hernias next to 
Eryngium.
Order 46.
Hederacete.
The lectures give no new 
information concerning this order.
The six genera stand 
as in the Genera Plantarum; Panax, Aralia, Zanthoxy- 
lum, Hedera, Vitis, and Cissus.
Order 47.
Stellate.
" This order was founded by 
Ray, and received its name from the leaves of most of the 
plants which compose it being placed, four, six, or eight 
together, in the form of a star, round the stem.
It is un- 
usual to see more than two leaves opposite to each other, 
nor is it the case here.
For two of these only are pro- 
perly leaves, the rest being no other than stipulas, grown 
to the size of leaves.
This appears evident in several 
Indian plants of the present order, as Knoxia, Diodia, 
Stc. which have only two opposite leaves, though between 
these some small acute stipulas are found, being the same 
that in the rest of the order attain the magnitude of leaves.
Ray believed all the plants of this order to have whorled 
leaves, which is generally the case, as far as regards those 
554 
of European growth, but rarely with the Indian ones, of 
which few were known in his time." 
" In this order there is no tree, unless perhaps Lippia ; 
there are very few shrubs, most of the tribe being small 
herbs, growing in barren earth, or coarse sand." 
" The roots are in many instances perennial.
Leaves 
opposite, horizontal, mostly rough.
Stipulas of the form 
and aspect of leaves, so that it is impossible to say whe- 
ther they be truly such or not, hence the leaves appear 
whorled ; but this does not hold good universally.
In 
those however which have no leafy stipulas, there is found, 
at each side, a sort of toothed membrane, connecting the 
leaves together, and occupying the place of stipulas." 
" The stem is jointed, with mostly tumid knots.
Co- 
rolla of one petal, either flat, wheel-shaped, or funnel- 
shaped ; in one genus bell-shaped ; mostly four-cleft, 
sometimes almost down to the base ; rarely five-cleft.
Stamens four, never eight, though sometimes five or six, 
in which case the corolla has a parallel number of seg- 
ments.
Pistil solitary, divided ; in Richardia three-cleft, 
because that genus has a six-cleft corolla, six stamens, 
and a three-grained fruit, its parts of fructification being 
all augmented in a similar proportion.
Those parts are 
not augmented with the same regularity in genera fur- 
nished with a three-cleft corolla, and five stamens, for 
their pistil is still bifid, and their fruit two-grained, as is 
the case with such as have a four-cleft corolla and four 
stamens.
" The fruit is, for the most part, inferior ; though su- 
perior in Houstonia ; and in Crucianella superior with re- 
spect to the calyx, though inferior to the corolla." This 
is incorrect, for Crucianella has a real superior perianth, 
like the rest of the order, though so small as to be hardly 
discernible ; what Linnaeus here terms calyx, being an in- 
volucrum, or perhaps bracteas.
" The sexes are rarely 
separated in this order, though Valantia, which is poly- 
gamous, can by no means be excluded from it.
Many of 
555 
the genera have a two-grained fruit, of two cells, with a 
solitary seed in each.
But in Hedyotis and Oldenlandia 
the cells contain many seeds; while in Cornus both cells 
are united into one seed, which, nevertheless, has two cells.
The fruit has a green, fleshy, but not juicy, coat, nor does 
it usually become coloured in ripening ; though in Rubia 
the fruit is a perfect berry." 
(Of the remarks on particular genera, we find nothing 
to extract except the following.) 
" Asperula tinctoria is used in Gothland instead of 
Madder, and is preferable." 
" Sherardia has an oblong fruit, which the permanent 
calyx renders toothed, or crowned with three points.
It 
was the fate of William Sherard, a man worthy in the 
highest degree of botanical honour, to have two different 
genera distinguished by his name, both which were after- 
wards referred to others.
Pontedera, Vaillant, and Dil- 
lenius each published, at the same time, a Sherardia.
Pontedera described his plant so very obscurely, that it 
was ten years before Linnaeus made it out to be his own 
Gallenia.
Vaillant called the two-seeded Verbena by the 
name of Sherardia, but he was to blame in separating 
them from their proper genus.
Dillenius named a She- 
rardia, from among the Slellata, which Linnaeus has re- 
tained, though not very certainly distinct.
Being unwill- 
ing that so meritorious a botanist should remain without 
a memorial, Linnaeus declined referring the plant in ques- 
tion to Asperula-, especially as the three teeth, at the top 
of each seed, may serve, if not very satisfactorily, to keep 
it separate." 
" Valantia was so named by Tournefort ; but Vaillant, 
perceiving it to be the same with Tournefort's Cruciata, 
thought it a bad genus, which could not support itself.
He therefore wished to abolish all generic names, given 
in honour of botanists, because he supposed his own was 
untenable.
But Tournefort confounded several genera 
under the appellation of Cruciata, so that Linnaeus has 
556 
been enabled to establish a Valaiitia from among them, 
referring the rest to their proper places." 
Order 48.
Aggregate.
" These constitute a natural 
order, first established by Vaillant in the Memoirs of the 
French Academy of Sciences.
They agree so far with the 
Composite, that they have generally a common calyx, as 
well as receptacle, containing many sessile flowers, each 
of which has always an inferior germen.
But there is a 
total difference with respect to the remaining parts of 
fructification, nor can these two orders be, by any means, 
united." 
" The calyx, as we have just said, is common to many 
flowers.
Common receptacle either naked, villous, hairy, 
or scaly.
In the place of a partial calyx is the corolla, 
generally of one petal, regular or irregular, in four or five 
divisions, rarely polypetalous.
Stamens four, with sepa- 
rate anthers.
Germen inferior.
Fruit single-seeded.
The 
flower is therefore complete in this tribe, except only Va- 
leriana, whose calyx is scarcely apparent.
The leaves are 
often opposite, and the stem shrubby." 
Order 49.
Composite.
" A compound flower gene- 
rally consists of a common calyx, containing several florets.
But this definition is not sufficiently discriminative, for 
there are certain flowers termed Aggregate .which though 
they have numerous florets in one common calyx, are con- 
nected by no affinity whatever with these ; witness Cepha- 
lanthus, Dipsacus, Scabiosa, Knautia, Allionia.
Hence 
botanists have tried to discover an appropriate and distin- 
guishing character for a compound flower, but they have 
scarcely succeeded.
There are indeed flowers of this 
order, furnished with solitary florets in each calyx, as 
Seriphium, Corymbium, Strumpjia.
All of them have a 
monopetalous corolla, but so has Scabiosa and others.
Most have five stamens, but some have only four.
The 
greater number bear their anthers united into a cylinder, 
but Kuhnia, which belongs to them, has separate anthers; 
while Jasione, Viola and Impatiens, which do not, have 
557 
combined ones.
The united anthers burst internally, by 
which means their pollen is communicated to the stigma ; 
but the anthers of Kuhnia open at the extremity, and re- 
semble the corolla of an Aristolochia.
All the florets are 
superior, but this holds good likewise in Scabiosa.
Hence 
it appears that no essential character of compound flowers 
is to be detected, though no order can be more natural 
than that before us." 
" Tournefort first divided the compound flowers into 
three sections, according to the shape of their partial co- 
rollas.
These are either ligulate or tubular.
Such as 
consist of ligulate florets only, are called by this writer 
semiflosculosi; such as are formed only of tubular ones, 
Jlosculosi ; while those which have ligulate florets in the 
radius, and tubular ones in the disk, are denominated ra- 
diati.
This division seems natural enough, and yet is 
not so.
For it refers both the discoid and capitate com- 
pound flowers of Linnseus to the Jlosculosi, which never- 
theless are too dissimilar to be possibly admitted into the 
same section.
The discoidei of Linnaeus, Ray's aggregati, 
having aggregate florets, seated on a hemispherical recep- 
tacle, are, in fact, more allied to the radiati; while the 
capitati, such as Thistles, are widely different, so as ne- 
cessarily to constitute a division by themselves." 
" Vaillant attempted a new botanical system ; but it 
is to be lamented that we are possessed of no more of his 
labours, than what concerns the compound flowers.
In 
this performance, published in the Memoirs of the Pari- 
sian Academy for the years 1718, 1719 and 1720; he 
has displayed an extensive knowledge of species, and has 
treated the subject admirably.
As the Memoirs of the 
Academy are not within the reach of every body's purse, a 
German named Von Steinwehr has collected the anato- 
mical, chemical and botanical papers, into an octavo vo- 
lume, published in 1754 at Breslaw.
In this Vaillant's 
treatises are preserved entire," (but in the German lan- 
guage.) 
558 
" The florets of compound flowers are threefold with 
respect to sex, being either hermaphroditi, perfect, having 
the organs of both sexes ; female, destitute of anthers ; 
or neuter, deprived of both organs, and barren." 
(t Tournefort, Vaillant, Ray, and almost every botanist 
who has treated of this tribe, divide it into three or four 
orders, some of them adding the aggregate flowers to the 
compound ones, whence arises the fourth order.
But they 
have not fixed limits to their orders, such being scarcely 
discoverable.
The semiflosculosi and c'apitati, for instance, 
though apparently widely different, are proved nearly akin 
by Scolymus and Elephantopus.
The former of these has 
all the habit of a Carduus, and yet all its florets are ligu- 
late ; the latter is intermediate between the semiflosculosi 
and capitati, nor are we certain to which of these divi- 
sions it belongs.
Perdicium, a new genus, connects Inula, 
which is radiated, with the semiflosculous genus Hieracium, 
so that accurate limits are hardly to be drawn between 
them.
Most of the semiflosculosi are milky, but Lapsana 
and Cichorium want this quality." 
"Section 1.
Semiflosculosi; all the florets ligulate." 
" These genera are distributed, first by their recep- 
tacle, which is either chaffy, villous, or naked.
In the 
next place, they are subdivided by the down of their 
seeds, pappus, which is either absent, or bristle-shaped, 
or hairy, or feathery.
Thirdly, a peculiar distinguishing 
character is borrowed from the form or nature of their 
calyx." 
" The quality of the Composites in general is innocent ; 
but some of the present section are milky, which secretion 
proves, by experience, somewhat of a poisonous nature.
So Lactuca virosa, in a wild state, is as poisonous as 
opium ; yet by culture it becomes esculent and culinary, 
though still causing sleep by its debilitating power." 
Linnaeus surely could not mean that this and the garden 
lettuce are one species.
It is possible his hearers mis- 
took him.
559 
" There are no trees, and few shrubs, among the semi- 
Jlosculosi\ no bulbs, scarcely a tuberous root, except in 
some species of Hieracium.
Their flowers are mostly 
yellow ; sometimes red underneath, as in Leontodon, Hi- 
eracium and Crepis ; " (very rarely pink, in Geropogon 
and Crepis;) sometimes blue, in Cichorium and Cata- 
nanche; never white." 
"Section 2.
Capitati; all the florets tubular, assem- 
bled into a head, in one common calyx." 
" All these are prickly or spinous, and vulgarly called 
Cardui, Thistles.
If however they were all considered 
as one genus, such a genus would prove too ample ; 
hence it is best to separate them into several, though the 
task is very difficult.
Centaurea belongs to them, though 
necessarily referred, in the sexual system, to the order 
Polygamia-frustranea.
Its calyx, always tumid, and often 
spinous, proves its affinity.
The most extensive genera 
of this section, Carduus, and Serratula, are the most 
difficult to distinguish ; hence it is best to study the 
rest, in the first place, that those puzzling ones may prove 
easier." 
" Vaillant divided this capitate tribe by the spines of 
their calyx, whether simple, spinous, or leafy.
But the 
gradation is so imperceptible, that no accurate principles 
of discrimination are hence to be obtained.
No plant of 
this section is milky, or poisonous, or arboreous.
Some 
of the Serratula are shrubby ; many of the herbs are 
destitute of stems, as in Carlina, Atractylis, Onopordum, 
Carduus, and Centaurea." 
" Atractylis has a radiant flower, and the florets of the 
radius have each both stamens and pistil, a solitary in- 
stance among compound flowers, rendering the genus very 
distinct.
The elongated and coloured scales of the calyx 
in Carlina have misled Tournefort to rank it among ra- 
diant flowers." 
u .
The capitati have a character peculiar to themselves, 
in the dilatation, or inflation, of the tube of each floret, 
500 
just below the limb, which causes their florets to project, 
in a more elongated manner, than in the discoidei, or other 
compound flowers." 
" Section 3rd.
Discoidei.
The first subdivision of 
these, polt/gami aqualis," (consisting of such as have all 
the florets furnished with stamens and pistils, and all pro- 
ducing seed,) "are distributed according to the receptacle, 
whether naked, chaffy or hairy, and their seed-down, like 
the semijiosculosi." 
"The second subdivision, polygamic/, superflua, have 
female florets in the circumference, but these are tubular, 
not ligulate or radiant.
So that the flowers, though they 
have a marginal series of female florets, cannot be called 
radiated." We have here extracted the ideas of Linnaeus 
from his remarks on Artemisia, which seem to refer to 
the whole of this subdivision, and are certainly correct, 
though they interfere with the distribution of the order 
before us in the Genera Plantarum, and seem to have 
been unintelligible to the editor of the Prcelectiones ; — see 
his note in p.
539 of that work.
"Section 4th.
Radiati." (Marginal florets radiant.) 
" The first subdivision is polygamia superflua," (all whose 
florets are capable of producing perfect seed, though the 
marginal radiant ones have no stamens.) 
These are distinguished by the presence or absence of 
seed-down, or of a membranous border to the seed, and 
by the nature of their receptacle, whether naked or 
chaffy.
The second, polygamia frustranea, have imperfect or 
defective female or neuter florets in the circumference, 
producing no seed.
These in Centaurea are tubular, and 
neuter ; in the rest ligulate, furnished with rudiments, 
more or less evident, of a pistil.
The third, polygamia necessaria, have effective seed ; 
bearing female florets in the circumference only.
" Section 5th.
Monogamia." (Such as have but one 
floret in each partial calyx.) 
561 
Seriphium, Corymbium, and Strumpfia.
" None of the Composites are poisonous, except Ta- 
getes, Doronicum, and Arnica ; the latter is more so than 
Doronicum.
They contain much of a bitter flavour; 
hence many of the order are medicinal and strengthen- 
ing.
Some, less bitter, as Arctium, Cynara, Carduus, are 
therefore esculent.
Many semrftosculosi are used as food, 
though furnished with a milky juice, which in them is not 
poisonous," (see a remark under Order 30th.) "except 
Lactuca virosa, whose juice as above mentioned, has the 
quality of opium, and L.
sativa has a soporific virtue.
Boiling entirely destroys the power of this, as well as of 
the other semiflosculosi." 
Order 50th.
Amentace*.
" An amentum, catkin, is 
a species of calyx, and very like a spike, consisting of a 
common receptacle, drawn out like a thread, on which 
the flowers stand in alternate order, subtended by scales 
or bracteas.
Such a calyx is found in the plants of this 
order, whence Linnaeus gave it the above name.
They 
are all either trees or shrubs, with alternate leaves, and 
separated 'male and female flowers, being either mono- 
ecious or dioecious.
Many of them produce but one seed 
from each flower ; but Salix and Populus bear a seed- 
vessel of two valves, with many seeds.
The styles are 
usually two or three.
The flowers come before the leaves, 
that the latter may not hinder the access of the pollen of 
the male to the female blossoms." 
" Monoecious genera are Betula, Carpinus, Corylus, 
Quercns, Juglans, Fagus, and Platanus." 
" Dioecious ones Pistacia, Myrica, Populus, and 
Salix." 
Order 51st.
Conifers.
" These are generally ever- 
green trees of cold climates.
In the Indies almost all 
the trees are evergreen, and have broad leaves ; but in 
our cold regions most trees cast their foliage every year ; 
and such as do not, bear acerose, that is, narrow and 
acute, leaves.
If they were broader, the snow which falls

during winter would collect among them, and break the 
branches by its weight.
Their great slenderness prevents 
any such effect, allowing the snow to pass between them.
This precaution is unnecessary in India, where snow is 
unknown.
Nevertheless, Liquidambar is to be referred 
to this order, though it bears no such slender, but rather 
broad, foliage ; nor is it a native of a cold country." 
" The plants of the present order are denominated Co- 
nifera, because they bear Strobili, which the older bota- 
nists called Coni, Cones.
A cone and a catkin are closely 
related to each other.
The latter bears several imbricated 
flowers about a common receptacle or axis.
Under each 
flower a membranous scale or bractea is attached, which 
if it hardens and becomes woody, the catkin becomes a 
cone.
Hence a cone is nothing more than a permanent 
or hardened catkin." 
" All the Corriferce properly bear cones, though in 
some instances their fruit seems of a totally different na- 
ture.
For instance, the fruit of Jwiiperus has all the ap- 
pearance of a berry, and is universally so called.
Yet it 
is no other than a strobilus, whose scales are replete with 
pulp, and do not split asunder ; being in fact six fleshy 
united scales, in each of which is concealed a solitary 
seed.
Taxus has a berry, which is merely a fleshy
