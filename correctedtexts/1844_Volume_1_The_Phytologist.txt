M.DCCC.XLIV.
" The slightest piece of information which may tend to the advancement of the 
science [of Botany], we should thankfully receive.
However trifling in itself, yet 
combined with other facts it may become important.
Whatever relates to the de- 
termination of species, even in the lowest and seemingly least important of Nature's 
works, ought never to be neglected.
He who determines with certainty a single 
species of moss, adds so far to the general stock of human knowledge." â€” Sir J.
E. 
Smith.
PKEFACE 
The Phytologist owes its existence to the desire of recording 
and preserving facts, observations and opinions relating to Botany 
in general, but more especially to British Botany.
Prior to its com- 
mencement these had no appropriate receptacle.
There was no pe- 
riodical to which they would be acceptable.
For works of a general 
character, they were esteemed too dull : for those of high scientific 
pretensions they were supposed too trifling.
By field-botanists alone 
\yere they considered worth preserving : to such the utility, the value 
of an unpretending monthly journal was most manifest; and these 
field-botanists â€” these observers â€” these labourers in the delightful 
fields of botanical enquiry, have freely availed themselves of its pa- 
ges : they have done all that was anticipated, and * The Phytologist ' 
has become the medium of their communications with each other and 
with the botanical public.
It has been a source of great pleasure to me to observe, from time 
to time, among such contributors, the honoured names of Forster, 
Woods, Borrer, Wilson, Boott, Taylor, Greville and Ralfs, â€” names 
familiar as household words to the ear of every botanist, â€” names 
that constantly occur in works treating of British plants.
Neither 
must I omit to enumerate others, perhaps of a younger school, but 
already honorably known ; â€” as Mr. Spruce, the talented muscologist, 
Mr. Babington, Mr. Leighton, Dr. Balfour, Mr. Watson, Mr. Irvine, 
and Mr. Luxford, â€” all highly esteemed for their labours in the cause 
of British Botany, have lent their aid to ' The Phytologist.' To the 
last-named gentleman I am indebted, not only for those papers which 
bear his name, but also for numerous anonymous articles, and the 
VI 
editorial management of the entire volume.
And here I will take 
occasion to remark, that although ' The Phytologist ' is published at 
my cost, and under my immediate control ; and although I am in 
every respect responsible for anonymous articles ; yet 1 have no claim 
whatever to the merit of such articles, since they have generally ema- 
nated from the pen of Mr. Luxford, whose name now stands in the 
title-page as the avowed editor.
It only remains for me to offer my best thanks to every sub- 
scriber and contributor, to all who promoted the welfare of my under- 
taking ; but more especially to Mr. Luxford for his editorial labours, 
and to Mr. Dennes, Secretary to the Botanical Society of London, 
for the unremitting kindness and regularity with which he has fur- 
nished such able Reports of its proceedings.

â€” A History of the British Lycopodia, and allied Genera, 
By Edward Newman.
COMMON CLUB-MOSS.
Lycopodium clavatdm of Authors.
LOCALITIES.
England \ 
Wales I universally distributed, on elevated moors and heaths.
Scotland f '' 
Ireland j 
The Commou Club-moss, Wolf's-claw, or Stag's-hom is the only 
species of Lycopodium that can be spoken of as abundant in Britain.
It occiu-s on most of our moors and heaths, especially when rather more 
elevated than the surrounding country j for instance, in the vicinity of 
London it is found on Hampstead Heath, High Beech, the Addington 
Hills, &c.
It is abundant on nearly all the mountains of the north 
of England, Wales and Scotland, and is found occasionally, but less 
frequently, in similar situations in Ireland.
This club-moss is a handsome and interesting plant.
I have heard 
of a lady who had a ball-dress ornamented with its graceful festoons ; 
and Linneus relates that in Lapland he saw the boys with their heads 
decorated with chaplets or wreaths formed of it, the double spikes 
projecting on all sides, a sight which reminded him of the fauns and 
satyrs : * and Tragus says that the girls in Germany make it into 
chaplets and belts.
f 
Old Gerarde has some remarks on the subject which are so plea- 
sant, that I think my readers will not object to my quoting them at 
length.
" There is another kinde of mosse which I have not elsewhere 
found than upon Hampstead Heath, neere unto a little cottage, grow- 
ing close upon the gi'ound amongst bushes and brakes, which I have 
shewed unto divers surgeons of London that have walked thither with 
mee for their further knowledge in simples, who have gathered this 
kinde of mosse, whereof some have made them hatbands, girdles, and 
also bands to tye such things as they have before gathered, for the 
which purpose it most fitly served ; some pieces whereof are six or 
eight foot long, consisting as it were of many hairy leaves set upon a 
tough string, very close couched and compact together, from which is 
also sent forth certain other branches like the first : in smadry places 
there be sent down fine little strings, which serve instead of roots, 
wherewith it is fastened to the upper part of the earth, and taketh 
hold likewise upon such things as grow next unto it.
There spring 
also from the branches bare and naked stalkes, on which grow cer- 
taine eares as it were like the catkins or blowings of the hasell-tree, in 
* Vidi aliquando, grato spectaculo, pueros Lapponum ex hoc musco serta confe-

shape like a little club or the reed mace, saving that it is much lesser, 
and of a yellowish white colour, very wel resembling the claw of a 
wolfe, whereof it tooke his name, which knobby catkins are altogether 
barren, and bring forth neither seed nor floure." * 
It seems rather unaccountable that neither Gerarde, nor his able 
editor, Johnson, to vsdiom, by the way, the great herbalist is indebted 
for the better half of his fame, should have so entirely overlooked the 
minute but multitudinous seeds, which have attracted the attention of 
so many other botanists.
Olearius appears to have been the first to 
mention these seeds, and a curious purpose to which they have been 
applied.
This author devotes the 24th chapter of the 4th book of his 
Itinerary to the fire-works of Ardebil, a town in Persia ; and he be- 
lieves them produced by the seeds of this Lycopodium.
He observes, 
" We saw at a distance some flames rise suddenly in the air, and as 
suddenly disappear, and we supposed them to be produced by the Rus- 
sian Pimm, which is much used for this purpose.
The plann, to explain 
more fully, is nothing more than a yellow dust which is beaten out of 
the Muscus terrestris.
The moss is called in herbals heerlap^ or De- 
riVs-claiv, and grows commonly in fir and birch woods, and also on 
waste lands ; I have frequently met with it in the Russian and Livo- 
nian woods.
It throws out twin cones, which, when ripe in August, 
are collected in large quantities and dried in furnaces ; the powder is 
then beaten out and sold by the pound.
I bought several ox-bladders 
full, and brought them home with me.
Its other uses are in green 
wounds, recent bruises, and for chafed children, inasmuch as it is of 
a drying and healing nature, and it is moreover used by the Russians 
in the Chaldaic fire above spoken of.
The powder is placed in a tin 
cases, of elongate conical form, about half an ell in length, or sometimes 
shorter ; this is taken in the hand, and a burning light or torch is pla- 
ced at the aperture, the case is then waved about in the air, so that 
the p/rtwÂ« flows through the aperture, and then ignites, producing a 
bright flame : when the motion is rapidly repeated, so that one flame 
follows another, it produces a very extraordinary effect.
Fine fun 
may be made in company, if a tobacco-pipe be secretly filled with 
this ;?/Â«?/;?, and held at the light and blown into ; a strong flame, sud- 
denly and unexpectedly to those sitting around, proceeds from it, and 
that it may produce a great noise, they mix it with powdered birch- 
leaves.
The plaun-powder has the property of igniting only when it 
is dusted through a flame in the air, and not otherwise, even if a torch

or light be placed in it, or it be cast on live coals.
In case the plaun 
is not to be obtained, finely powdered sweet-scented gum or rosin will 
answer the purpose, and this, besides the amusement, produces a plea- 
sant smell.
The plaun has no particular smell and produces no 
smoke."* Subsequent writers appear to have curtailed and garbled 
these interesting remarks, rather than verified them by their own ob- 
servations.
In some of the chemists' shops of this country the seed of Lycopo- 
podium is kept as an article of sale ; and Mr. Luxford, who has tried 
the experiment, bears ample testimony to its inflammable property.
The demand for this article, as may be supposed, is extremely limited, 
yet a friend has informed me that he is acquainted with a chemist who 
has received an order for several pounds weight of it; the purpose for 
which this large quantity was required is unknown.
Sir J.
E. Smith 
says that the seeds are still sold in the shops in Germany for the pur- 
pose of producing artificial lightning on the stage :t this use must how- 
ever be very limited, on account of the difficulty of procuring the seed 
in any quantity ; and moreover, as mentioned above by Olearius, pul- 
verised rosin is found to be a cheap and efficient substitute.
I have 
lately been informed that these seeds, spread upon a plate of metal, 
have been employed in Chladni's lectures to illustrate the vibration 
produced by sound.
The medical properties of the common club-moss have been greatly 
extolled by our earliest writers.
Tragus gives a flaming account of 
its virtues, the chief of which seem to be the removal of calculus by 
comminution, and the cure of gout ; % Matthiolus,Â§ Camerarius, || 
LobeljII Tabemaemontanus,** Ray, ft and Dillenius,Jt appear to 
have taken these virtues for granted, as they have copied them with- 
out hesitation.
Ray indeed adds several others, and asserts that a 
decoction of its leaves was used in Poland as a cure for a disease call-

that loose teeth may be fixed by washing the mouth with a decoction 
of the seed in red wine.* I am, however, incUned to think that its 
use in either of these capacities must have been much less extensive 
than its historians imagined ; indeed, fi'om certain references, it seems 
not improbable that many of its supposed virtues owe their origin to 
a passage in Dioscorides, on a plant which he calls Muscus marinus, 
and which, beyond all doubt, is one of the Algse.
Mr, Ward informs 
me that whatever may have been its pristine fame, it holds no place in 
the modem Pharmacopoeia.
Tragus observes that the Germans call 
the plant Weingrein, from its power of restoring injured wine, f 
The same observation is repeated by liis successors.
Lightfoot, in his ' Flora Scotica,' says that the Swedes make mats 
of the club-moss to rub their feet on ; if this be true, it is remarkable 
that the fact should have escaped the notice of such observant men as 
Linnaeus and Wahlenberg ; neither of whom makes the slightest allu- 
sion to the subject.
Is it possible that Lightfoot has made free with 
the remark in Wahlenberg's 'Flora Suecica,' that the Swedes call the 
plant Mattegriis, % a most appropriate name, being simply equivalent 
to matted grass, and not at all implying its employment in the manu- 
facture of mats ?
The older botanists have generally called this species Muscus ter- 
restris, or Muscus clavatiis : Cordus terms it CliauKepeuce, or dwarf 
fir : and all writers since the establishment of the Liunean binominal 
nomenclature, have agreed in naming it Lycopodmm clavatum.
It is 
figured by Tragus, Lobel, Tabernsemontanus, Cordus, Gerarde, John 
Bauhin, Plukenet, Matthiolus, Camerarius, Dillenius, &c., but with 
the exception of the figure by Dillenius, || none of them give a very 
accurate idea of the plant ; of later representations, that in the ' Flora 
Danica'II is perhaps the best, but even this does not approach in ac- 
curacy or freedom of drawing the admirable figure by Dillenius.
The roots of this species are very tough, wiry, and pale in colour; 
they are generally nearly straight and simple for an inch or more, then 
suddenly divided and tortuous ; they are usually placed singly and at 
rather long distances fi'om each other, and do not penetrate dee])ly into 
the earth, but yet fix the creeping stem most firmly, and prevent any

injurious action from the wind.
It has been supposed that on lofty 
mountains this plant, fonning as it does a compact matted turf, whence 
the Swedish name, serves to bind the surface of the soil more closely 
together, and thus secure it from the continued crumbling away to 
which, in exposed situations, it is constantly liable, from the effects of 
^^^nd and rain.
The stem is procumbent and repeatedly branched, the branches 
being at first slightly elevated, but soon becoming completely pros- 
trate.
It extends to a great length ; T have frequently found plants 
on Crooksbury Hill, near Farnham, in Surrey, spreading to a circum- 
ference of ten or twelve yards.
The whole plant has a rigid, harsh, 
and wiry feel when handled, even in a living state, and more especially 
when dried.
When the plant is about to produce seed, there are 
thrown out fi'om various parts of its branches, spikes of about an inch 
in length, of a pale sulphur colour, and in shape somewhat resembling 
catkins ; these are usually double, but some few are single, and a still 
smaller number treble ; they are erect and straight until the seed has 
been shed, when they become curved; they are situated on a stalk 
about twice their own length, and nearly naked, a character which is 
suflScient to distinguish this from any other of our indigenous species, 
and which gives to the plant, when growing luxuriantly, as I have 
seen it at Cwm Idwal and other parts of Caernarvonshire, a most 
striking and beautiftil appearance.
The whole of the branches are densely covered with narrow, flat, 
ribless, smooth leaves, the edges of which are slightly toothed, and 
the tips terminate in a filamentous point : the leaves as well as the 
stems are persistent; I have observed them in March and April per- 
fectly uninjured by our severest winters.
On the stalks supporting 
the spikes the leaves are longer, narrow, and of a pale yellowish green 
colour ; they are closely pressed against the stalk, and disposed some- 
what in whorls, thus giving to the stalk the appearance of the stem of 
an Equisetum ; they also in a great degree want the long filamentous 
points which are invariably present on the leaves of the prostrate 
branches, to the extremities of which they often give a hoary appear- 
ance.
In the spike itself the leaves are very much broader at the 
base, being altogether of a more triangular figure, and assuming the 
appearance and ofiice of bracts ; their colour is a pale yellow, and 
their margins are membranaceous and serrated.
After the seed has 
escaped, these leaves or bracts become reflexed, giving to the spike a 
vciy altered character and appearance.
The thecaj are somewhat reniform, perfectly sessile, and of a pale 
yellow colom' : they are situated at the base of the bracts ; each is 
two-valved, and filled with numerous minute and almost impalpable 
seeds, from which in cultivation young plants may be raised with little 
difficulty.

â€” Description of a Primula, found at Thames Ditton^ 
Surrey, exhibiting characters both of the Primrose and the 
Cowslip.
By Hewett Cotteell Watson, Esq., F.L.S.
&c.
The circumstances under which this oxlip was found, rather than 
any peculiar character in the plant itself, induced me to exhibit it at 
the meeting of the London Botanical Society on Friday last.
For several years past I have been in the custom of traversing the 
fields and coppices of Thames Ditton and the adjoining parishes, and 
have particularly looked out for oxlips, but until the present spring- 
not a single plant of the kind has been observed, while cowslips and 
primroses are abundant in many places.
The oxlip in question was 
found in an old orchard, where the ground is very damp, and in sum- 
mer much shaded by trees.
Numerous plants with the true cowslip 
and primrose characters were growing about this solitary oxlip ; 
and I could not see another specimen on again visiting the spot a week 
later, when more of the cowslips had come into flower.
It should be 
remarked, however, that as I had never before been within the orch- 
ard, I cannot say that oxlips had not grown there in preceding years.
I had frequently walked down a lane which runs alongside the orch- 
ard, and observed that it contained both cowslips and primroses; and 
was again doing so, when the showy flowers of the oxlip attracted my 
attention, and induced me to cross the hedge for it.
The mention of 
an orchard might lead to a supposition that the plant had been intro- 
duced ; but this appears to me improbable, since the fruit-trees grow 
in grass only, there being neither dug ground, nor any garden j^lants ex- 
cept the fruit-trees, which are chiefly apples.
All the circumstances 
lead to a reasonable presumption, that this solitary oxlip had origi- 
nated from a seed either of the cowslip or primrose ; yet its characters 
are so completely intermediate between the two, that I can give only 
the slightest preponderance in favour of the cowslip.
The plant I imagine to have been of three years' gi'owth, and that 
this is the second year of its flowering.
It had four umbels, only 
on eof them having the flowers expanded when the plant was taken up.
Besides these umbels there were half-a-dozen solitary flowers and buds 
10 
on as many separate scapes ; all these single-flowered scapes spring- 
ing jfrom the same point amongst the leaves clustered on the head of 
the root, or rather, subterranean stem.
The calyx is intermediate be- 
tween those of the cowslip and primrose.
The corolla has the deep 
colour of the cowslip, but in size, and in the flatness of the limb, ap- 
proaches much nearer to that of the primrose.
The leaves of the 
present year have the colour and nearly the form of those of the cows- 
lip, but two or three large half-withered leaves, of last year as far as 
can be now ascertained, resembled more decidedly those of the prim- 
rose.
If these old leaves had not been seen, I should have pronoun- 
ced the plant a cowslip, notwithstanding the size and flatness of the 
corolla, and the few single-flowered scapes.
The specimen exhibited at the meeting was only half the plant ; 
the other part is planted in my garden, where I hope to watch its 
flowers next spring.
After finding this one specimen, I examined the cowslip and prim- 
rose localities all around with renewed diligence, and found a second 
oxlip a mile or two from the first, and in a situation very different, ex- 
cept in being damp.
It was growing amongst many cowslips in a 
pasture field, with primroses not many yards distant, and in every re- 
spect resembled the other cowslips, except that the corolla had the 
pale tint and almost the shape of the primrose ; being considerably 
larger than the cowslip, but smaller than the primrose.
This plant 
had been crushed under the foot of a cow ; and its leaves were small 
and the scapes short, and bearing few flowers : it was obviously in- 
jured and unhealthy.
Primroses, self-sown, spring up freely in my garden, and the seed- 
lings occasionally produce umbelliferous scapes ; but in other respects 
they have hitherto retained all the characters of the wild primrose, 
except varying in colour from pale yellow to different shades of red, 
and occasionally exhibiting monstrosities in the calyx.
I may remark that young botanists sometimes mistake a late state 
of the common cowslip for the oxlip.
After the germen is fertilized, 
the flowers of the former become erect ; the limb of the corolla loses 
its concave form, and when large and vigorous it bears at this stage 
some resemblance to a small primrose flower.

â€” Notice of^A Flora of Shropshire.'' By W.
A. Leighton, 
B.A., F.B.S.E. London : Van Voorst.
1841.
With addi- 
tional Notes on many of the Plants described in the Work.
Previously to the appearance of this excellent work, there was no 
regular Flora of Shropshire in existence ; the only ilhistrations of the 
Botany of that county being contained " in the county lists of plants 
in ' Camden's Britannia,' the ' Botanists' Guide ' [by Turner and Dill- 
wyn], and the 'Agricultural Survey,' and the few notices scattered 
throughout the works of How, Ray, Purton, Withering and Smith : " 
and the only record left by any botanist of the result of his investiga- 
tions in this district, is a MS.
catalogue of the plants of Shropshire, 
with their localities, compiled by the Re\^.
E. Williams, which still re- 
mains unpublished in the hands of the Right Hon. Lord Berwick, who 
liberally allowed Mr. Leighton to make unreserved use of its contents.
Li this catalogue are enumerated 715 species of flowering plants and 
300 species of Cryptogamia.
The present volume of the ' Flora of Shropshire' is complete in it- 
self, and is restricted to the Vasculares, of which it contains chai'acters 
and full descriptions of 876 species, aiTanged according to the Linnaean 
system, with synonymes and references ; and a copious list of localities 
is attached to the less common plants.
It was at first the intention of the author, that this work should 
" appear as a mere catalogue of plants, with localities and observa- 
tions," but he was ultimately induced to present it in the more ex- 
tended form of a descriptive Flora.
To render it " more comjDlete 
and comprehensive than could be effected by his single and unaided 
efforts, circulars, containing queries and heads of enquiry, were dis- 
tributed, to which many friends of science resident within the district 
most cheerfully and liberally responded." 
In the list of friends to whom the author returns thanks for assist- 
ance rendered in this and other ways, we notice the names of many of 
the first botanists of the day, including Professors Don, Graham, Lind- 
ley and Nees ab Esenbeck, Dr. Bromfield, Messrs.
Babington, BoiTer, 
Bowman, Dovaston (the friend and biographer of Bewick), Forster, 
and E.
Lees.
" In the preparation of the work the invaluable Floras of Smith 
[2nd ed.] and Hooker [3rd ed.] were taken as text-books ; and the 
Shropshire plants have been compared with their descriptions, and 
also, when requisite, with the works of Koch, Fries, Reichenbach, 
Bluff and Fingerhuth, and other continental botanists.
The descrip- 
12 
tions have been, so far as practicable, invariably drawn up from care- 
fiil examination of living or dried specimens, at the same time adopting 
such portions of the information conveyed by these authors, as a com- 
parison with nature dictated, and rejecting it where apparently new 
and better characters displayed themselves." 
Several valuable data towards the elucidation of the geographical 
distribution of the Shropshire plants, have been communicated by Dr.
T. O.
Ward, of Shrewsbury ; and in a complete index of localities 
the geology of the county is exhibited from Murchison's ' Silurian 
Regions : ' the geological relations of the plants being by this means 
clearly pointed out.
Many plants are recorded as occurring in Shropshire, which have 
been discovered and published as British since the appearance of Sir 
J. E.
Smith's 'English Flora,' in 1828.
The detection of these new 
forms, whether regarded as species or varieties, is the result of that 
spirit of enquiry and research which is now directing the labours of 
the most eminent of our British botanists, and which we believe to 
have sprung, in a great measure, fi-om a desire to enable the progress 
of Botany in this country, to keep pace with its rapid advance on the 
continent.
The following is a list of such of the species new to Bri- 
tain as are described in the work before us ; but the book itself must 
be consulted in order that an adequate idea of the mass of valuable in- 
formation contained in it may be formed.

We have here a list of upwards of thirty new plants found in the 
county, thirteen of which belong to the genus Rubus.
Whether ma- 
ny of the numerous reputed species of this genus will ultimately be 
allowed to retain that rank, is at present exceedingly doubtful.
In 
13 
hardly any genus throughout the whole range of botanical science, 
does so much uncertainty prevail with regard to the limits of species, 
as in the genus Rubus : and it really must afford great comfort to bo- 
tanical tyros, who have been puzzled by these most vexatious plants, 
to find that the gi'eat masters in Botany, â€” those who have paid par- 
ticular attention to this difficult genus, are so completely at fault in 
their endeavours to determine the species, as the conflicting opinions 
appended to the descriptions of the fonns an*anged under the fruti- 
cose or bramble division of the genus, most evidently show them to 
be.
Nor, after the perusal of these opinions, can we feel any surprise 
at finding the following remarks from the pen of Mr, Leighton himself, 
who is well known as an ardent botanist.
"To the examination of the 
Shropshire brambles I devoted two successive summers, and collected 
specimens of every form which came under my notice, in which any 
conspicuous differences were observable.
But, notwithstanding some 
care and attention, the strange and inconstant manner in which simi- 
lar forms, and even what were apparently distinct ones, in innumera- 
ble instances varied or ran into each other, precluded me fi'om arriving 
at any definite conclusions as to the limits and true characters of the 
estimated species, and in fact left me in a complete maze of doubt 
and ignorance whether they should not all be considered as modifica- 
tions endlessly varied of one and the same species." Mr. Leighton 
then distributed his specimens to Nees von Esenbeck, Professor Lind- 
ley and Mr. Bon-er, and solicited their opinions.
" In consequence, 
howevei", of their severally referring the same forms, in many instances, 
to different and opposite species, I found that no other alternative was 
left to me than to describe from the specimens submitted to them the 
various forms of the genus, and append to each description their opin- 
ions and remarks." 
We are very glad that Mr. Leighton has prefaced these descriptions 
with the well-known and often-quoted observations on the genus by 
Mr. Borrer* and Professor Lindley,t because we believe that the fact 
of the uncertainty respecting species which prevails in many British 
genera, though perhaps in none to so great a degi-ee as in Rubus, can- 
not be too frequently or too prominently brought forward.
For as in 
politics " agitation " is the watch-word when a party would attain an 
object on which they have set their affections, even so must the same 
means be resorted to whenever the energies of the cultivators of sci- 
ence are to be awakened, and their exertions directed to any desired

end.
The paramount importance of attention to " the limits within 
which a species may vary," has been most ably argued by the Rev.
Professor Henslow in 'The Magazine of Zoology and Botany' for 
August, 1836, and ' The Magazine of Natural History,' iii.
406; and 
unless, as recommended in those valuable communications, a series 
of experiments and observations be instituted and carefully conduct- 
ed, having for their express object the elucidation of this interesting, 
but at present most unsettled question ; and unless, in addition to di- 
rect experiment, all the observed variations from what are considered 
the normal forms of plants, with the circumstances accompanying 
such variations, be carefully and precisely recorded ; â€” we fear it will 
be long ere an approximation to the truth will have been attained.
Our pages will ever be open to the reception of the results of such 
investigations ; and it will give us great pleasure if by our means one 
single fact should be added to the existing stores of botanical know- 
ledge, which may tend, however remotely, to the attainment of that 
important desideratum â€” the more exact determination of species.
It is not so easy to make suitable quotations from the pages of a 
Flora as from those of a connected narrative, whether in poetry or 
prose, and the illustrative observations contained in the work before us 
are all so valuable, that we find some difficulty in determining which 
to select : we must, however, lay before our readers some few speci- 
mens of the highly interesting contents of the book, at the same time 
taking the liberty to introduce occasional remarks on such of the plants 
of Shropshire as have fallen under our own observation in other parts 
of the country.
Veronica scutellata, Linn.
" A variety with the whole herbage 
hairy occurs on some boggy ground north of Bomere Pool, and at the 
east end of Blackmere." As Mr. Leighton does not mention the co- 
lour of the flowers of this variety, we suppose it to be the same as that 
of the plant in its usual state.
Several years ago we found, in some 
boggy gi'ound near Bloxwich, in Staffordshire, two specimens of what 
appears to be a weak, prostrate variety of this species, with the leaves 
short, ovate-lanceolate and rather hairy, and the flowers blue : the 
plants, except in the colour of their flowers, closely resembling the 
Ver. parmularia, of Poit.
et Turp.
' Fl. Paris.' tab.
14, which is Ver.
scutellata /3 of ' Eng. Fl.' i.
21.
Veronica polita, Fries, the Ver. agrestis of ' Eng. Bot.' 783, may 
readily be distinguished from that species by the bluish green hue and 
less succulent appearance of the whole plant, in which we have never 
15 
observed any disposition to assume a red or puq^le colotu-, as in cer- 
tain situations agrestis may frequently be seen to do ; the peduncles 
in agrestis are shorter than the leaves, and the cells of the capsule 
contain few seeds, whereas in poUta the leaves are shorter than the 
peduncles and sharply serrated, and the cells of the capsules are ma- 
ny-seeded.
These two species are admirably figured in 'English Bo- 
tany,' poliia in tab.
783, and agrestis in tab, 2603 (Suppl.) In the 
Shi'opshire Flora the latter species is said to be " common," while the 
former is described as being " rare ; " we have observed these condi- 
tions to be reversed in many parts of Surrey.
Veronica Buxhaumii, Tenore, 'Fl. Neap.' i.

6 ; distinguished from Ver. polita and agrestis, to 
both which it is allied, by the form of the capsule, which is compress- 
ed, obcordate, and in breadth nearly double its length, with its lobes 
divaricated, sharply keeled, smooth and veiny.
We possess speci- 
mens raised from seeds which had been sent fi-om Sussex by Mr.
BoiTer, the original discoverer, to one of our friends, (now deceased) ; 
these seedlings exhibit all the characters of their parents.
Some bo- 
tanists look upon this as a doubtftdly-indigenous species, beheving it 
to have been either introduced with crops, or to have escaped from 
cultivation; in a paper read before the Botanical Society, Nov. 10, 
1836, after giving two new Scottish localities for this species.
Pro- 
fessor Graham remarks that he " had not seen either station, but was 
inclined to believe with Dr. Dewar [the authority for these localities], 
that the plant had not been introduced, because it had only lately been 
cultivated, and probably has not been so yet near either of these sta- 
tions." â€” First Reijort, p.
34.
Pinguicula vulgaris, Linn.
Mr. Leighton observes, â€” " On the 
gradual decay of the leaves in autumn, small, round, leafy buds or hi- 
bernacula are formed, wliich survive the winter, and are caj^able of 
developing new plants in the spring.
" Our excellent friend Mr. Ca- 
meron, of the Birmingham Botanic Garden, first pointed out to us 
these hibemacula on Sutton Common in Warwickshire, April 17th, 
1835 ; when we also had the gratification of finding in flower, for the 
first time, the local Eriophorum vaginatum, the silvery gi'ey glumes of 
its spikes being nearly hidden by the prominent yellow anthers.
On 
the 23rd of May in the same year we paid a second visit to the Com- 
mon, and found the Eriophorum in seed, with its beautiful silky heads 
waving in the breeze ; the Pinguicula was then in full flower, as were 
also Eleocharis caespitosa, Vaccinium Vitis-idaea, Empetrum nigrum.
16 
and several other plants which rewarded our researches the same day.
One specimen of Pinguicula vulgaris which we then gathered, has the 
flower-stalk divided, at about half an inch from the base, into four 
branches, of different heights, each bearing a solitary flower at the 
summit.
Mr. Leighton does not mention the irritability exhibited by this 
species of Pinguicula, nor is it alluded to by either Smith or Hooker.
When the plant is dug up the leaves bend backwards and downwards, 
so as completely to conceal the root ; the flower-stalks also become 
cm-ved.
This action we have frequently observed in the Pinguicula 
vulgaris ; but as we have never had an opportunity of collecting 
either of the other British species, we are not aware whether they also 
exhibit the same irritability ; the leaves of our specimens of Pin.alpina 
are however deflexed quite as much as those of vulgaris, whence we 
infer that the two species are thus acted on in an equal degree ; in 
our specimens of Lusitanica and grandijlora the leaves are not at all 
deflexed.
Rhijnchofspora alba, Vahl.
Two varieties of this species are record- 
ed as growing with its usual form, and in nearly equal abundance, at 
Bomere Pool and on Twyford Vownog, near Westfelton ; one with the 
corymb as long as the outer bracteas, and the other having the spike- 
lets in a somewhat oval head, shorter than the outer bracteas.

[Fes. elatior, Linn.; E.

p. 51, Mr, Leighton remarks, " After a careful comparison of the two 
preceding very closely allied species, I have been unable to discover 
any satisfactory characteristic distinctions, and am induced to consider 
them only as modifications of the same plant.
The chief differences 
assuredly consist in the larger size of F.
arundinacea, the ovato-lan- 
ceolate not linear form of the spikelets, and the number of florets, yet 
all these may possibly depend on soil and situation producing a more 
vigorous growth and a suppression of development in the florets.
No 
dependance can be placed on the awns of the corolla, since they are 
equally present or absent in both plants, nor on the roots, which are 
in both somewhat creeping and the fibres downy.
In deference, how- 
ever, to the authority of our British Floras, they are here retained as 
separate species."

Although one of the commonest Norwegian and Swedish species, 
the Interrupted Club-Moss is of rare occurrence in the British Isles.
In England and Ireland it is entirely unknown : in Wales it appears 
to be confined to a single locality, the side of Glyder mountain above 
Llyn-y-Cwn. It was first discovered in this locality by Llwyd and 
Ray; the former of whom speaks of its occurring abundantly.* Dille- 
nius corroborates this statement,t and the habitat has been established 
by modern botanists: Messrs.
Borrer, Janson, Woods and W.
Wil- 
son, have seen the plant growing in the same spot, but all these 
gentlemen found it very sparingly; and in 1839, when I diligently 
searched the mountain- side, I could not find a single plant : therefore, 
although the observation of Ray is most satisfactorily established, it 
is still doubtful whether the habitat is likely to be preserved, and even 
whether the plant is not now confined to Scotland, where it grows at 
great elevations, and in wild and exposed situations.
I am indebted 
to Drs. Greville and Balfoiu: for specimens from the localities which I 
have recorded.
The interrupted club-moss appears to have been well known to our 
earliest botanists, although nothing remarkable has been recorded of 
its history.
The best figure is that in Dillenius ;t that in the posthu- 
mous volume of Morison edited by BobartÂ§ is also good; Plukenet's|| 
figure is much too small to give a satisfactory idea of the plant.

The roots are tough, wiry and tortuous, apparently not long, but 
veiy firmly fixed in the ground.
The stem is creeping, very strong 
and tough, and has the surface deeply and irregularly striated: it sends 
out, at intervals varying from one to four inches, long branches in an 
erect position ; these increase annually in length, the growth of each 
year being very decidedly marked by the altered length and direction 
of the leaves; so much so indeed as to give the branches a somewhat 
jointed appearance.
From the marking of each year s growth the 
name of annotinum has probably been given to this Lycopodium ; a 
name, however, not exactly appropriate, because the word rather im- 
plies of one year's age, leading us to imagine the plant was annual.
These upright branches are either single or again divided ; and when 
fertile, which is by no means invariably the case, the spike is usually 
on the sixth or seventh joint of the branch.
After having fruited, or 
arrived at equivalent age, the erect branches become prone, throw out 
roots and emit erect branches as before.
Connected with this subject 
Sir J.
E. Smith has broached an interesting hypothesis, which I will 
give in his own words.
" The flowering branches are erect, densely 
leafy, but little subdivided, each terminating in a solitary upright spike, 
whose scales, being deciduous, seem to leave the branch partly naked, 
but it afterwards bears proper leaves, except a few diminished ones 
just under where the spike had been, and produces, in the following 
season, another spike : hence the jointed or interrupted asj)ect of 
the branches."* This assertion would surely never have been made 
without what the learned author considered sufficient ground, and it is 
with considerable hesitation that I venture to express an opinion at va- 
riance with that of so observant a botanist, but I must confess that the 
specimens I have examined by no means bear out the opinions I have 
quoted ; indeed, were the hypothesis a correct one, should we not find 
the spike occupying indifferently any joint of the branch, and not so 
generally confined to those which are numerically the same ?
More- 
over, in a specimen now before me from the herbarium of Mr. S.
P. 
Woodward, the spike exhibits all the symptoms of incipient decay.
The branches, throughout their length, are clothed with linear 
leaves, which are very acutely pointed and have minute lateral serra- 
tures : those on the older portions are somewhat more scattered and 
distant, an appearance caused by the elongation of the stem itself, the 
leaves being persistent, and enduring for very many years.
Those on 
the lower portion of the erect branches are often somewhat reflexed, 
while on the more recent growth they are erect, more crowded, and

somewhat imbricated.
Smith says that the leaves are ranged in five 
rows ; and an attentive examination of the plant leads one to agree 
with this remark, still the character is not noticeable, and can only be 
traced with difficult3^ 
The spike is oblong, terminal, and completely sessile ; the long pe- 
duncle, which, in the common club-moss, separates the spike from the 
leafy part of the branch, is entii'ely w^anting, a character amply suffi- 
cient to distinguish this species from the foregoing.
The leaves or 
bracts in the spike are nearly round, yet have a j)ointed apex ; their 
edges are membranous and jagged, they become reflexed when the 
seed is shed : in the axil of each is situated a large, conspicuous, re- 
niform capsule, which, when ripe, opens transversely, allowing the 
escape of numerous minute, sulphur-coloured seeds.

â€” Notice of- A Flora of Shropshire.'' By W.
A. Leighton, 
B.A., F.B.S.E. London : Van Voorst.
1841.
(Concluded from page 16).
We are sorry to find that in speaking of the published illustra- 
tions of the Botany of Shropshire, in the former part of this Notice, 
we so worded our remarks as to make it appear that the * Botanist's 
Guide' by Turner and Dillwyn was the only work bearing that title 
in which such illustrations had appeared, thus excluding the * New 
Botanist's Guide ' by Mr. Watson.
In Turner and Dillwyn's Guide 
are recorded the stations of 91 species of flowering plants; in Mr.
Watson's New Botanist's Guide the number of species is raised to 
157, the localities also being much more numerous, and chiefly deri- 
ved from the previously unpublished notes of botanists of high repute.
Galium cruciatum, With., (Valantia Cruciata, Linn.) In ' Mag.
Nat. Hist.' viii.
280, Mr. Leighton mentions two small, yellow, glan- 
dular bodies, situated on the back of the leaves of Galium cruciatum, 
immediately below their apex ; and asks if these bodies are peculiar to 
the present species, and if any correspondent " can explain their pro- 
bable use in the economy of the plant." We are not aware of any re- 
ply to these enquiries having appeared : the glands are obvious even 
in dried specimens of Galium cruciatum, but we have not observed 
them in any other species.
Anchusa officinalis, Linn.
; " Oakley Park meadows, near Ludlow.
Mr. H.
Spare." We do not remember having before seen any other 
habitat for this species, than the Links at Hartley Pans, Northumber- 
land, where it was discovered by the Rev. Thomas Butt : see his letter 
in 'Memoirs of Sir J.
E, Smith,' i.
439.
The three reputed species of Primula, namely, vulgaris, elatior and 
veris, of ' English Flora,' i.
271, and other works, are, in the Shropshire 
Flora, restored to the rank assigned them by Linnaeus, as varieties of 
his Primula veris; a, officinalis, being described as the cowslip, /3, ela- 
tior, as the oxlip, and y, acaulis, the primrose ; /3 and y being con- 
nected by a subvariety of acaulis, the P.
vulgaris ^ of ' Eng. Fl.' 1.
c. 
At p.
9 of the ' Phytologist' will be found the description of a new sub- 
variety, forming another link in the chain of evidence on this question.
Of Hedera Helix, Linn., Mr. Leighton observes, "the greatest 
elevation at which I recollect to have seen this plant growing in 
Shropshire, was near the summit -of the Caradoc Hill, where it most 
23 
magnificently overspread the pei^pendicular and exposed face of one 
of the rocks." 
Gentiana Amarella, Linn.
" A variety with perfectly double flowers 
has been observed by the Rev. T.
Salwey !
at Trefonen, Oswestry." 
Cuscuta Epilinum, Weihe, appears to be the only species of this 
genus occurring in Shropshire.
It was " discovered by J, E.
Bow- 
man, Esq.
! July 29th, 1836, on flax, in a field near Croesmere, Elles- 
mere." See ' Mag. Nat.
Hist.' n.
s. ii.
343.
Shropshire can boast of possessing all the British Droseras.
Under 
Dros.
rotundifolia is recorded a variety, &., ramosa, which " occurs, 
not unfrequently, at Bomere Pool, of stouter and taller habit, with 
more numerous leaves, and the raceme forked or branched.
On some 
specimens a simple raceme occurs, as well as the forked one." 
Scheuchzeria palustris, Linn.
Two Shropshire localities are given 
for this very rare plant, Bomere Pool and Shomere Moss, both near 
Shrewsbury.
In ' Eng. FL' ii.
199, Lakeby Carr, near Boroughbridge, 
Yorkshire, is stated to be the only British station : in addition to this 
two others are given in Hook.
' Brit.
Flora,' 174; so that we have now 
five recorded stations for a plant which, previously to 1807, was not 
known as a native of Britain.
Chrysosplenium alter nifolium, Linn.
" In all the Shropshire spe- 
cimens which I have examined, of both species of Chrysosplenium, 
the calyx has been uniformly found to be 4-cleft, and the stamens 8 j 
4 of them alternating with, and 4 opposite to the sepals." This pre- 
cisely accords with the result of our own observations on these plants.
Dianthus plumarius, Linn.
; distinguished from Dia. Caryophyl- 
lus by the glaucous leaves being "finely serrulate at the margins" 
throughout their whole length, and not at the base only, as in the latter 
species ; the flowers also have the outer edge of the petals deeply la- 
ciniated, while those of Caryophyllus are only sharply toothed.
Mr.
Leigh ton observes that " the only true stations known for Dia. Cary- 
ophyllus are the Kentish castles ; " the old authors record a number 
of localities for it, but the plant growing in most of them is probably 
plumarius, as it certainly is at Ludlow in Shropshire and East Ham 
in Essex, while the plant of Rochester Castle in Kent is as certainly 
Caryophyllus.
Spergula vulgaris, Bonningh.
Distinguished from Sperg.
arvensis, 
with which it grows, by the seeds being " sharply keeled, and covered 
with white papillae." 
Localities are recorded for the rare Anemone apennina and ranun- 
culoides : and the local Ranunculus parvijlorus is said to be " not 
24 
uncommon ; " as indeed would appear from the long list of localities 
following the description.
Galeopais versicolor, Curt.
Mr. Leighton remarks, " I sowed seeds 
of this plant in my garden in 1834, where it has now completely natu- 
ralized itself; but I cannot perceive, on a comparison with the dried 
specimens from which the seeds were taken, any change in its charac- 
ters, or any tendency to run into Gal. Tetrahit (of which it has been 
considered a variety), of which species I have never observed a single 
specimen in my garden." This was written in 1838.
LathrcBa squamaria, Linn.
The economy of this singular parasite, 
and its mode of attachment to the roots of the trees on which it grows, 
have been most successfully investigated by Mr. Bowman, who com- 
municated the results of his researches to the Linnean Society, in a 
valuable paper read Nov. 3rd, 1839.
This paper, with two exquisite 
plates of details, was published in the ' Linn.
Transactions,' xvi.
399 ; 
and an abstract appeared in the 'Mag. Nat.
Hist.' v.
45, illustrated by 
three excellent wood-cuts, copied from Mr. Bowman's original draw- 
ings.
The 1st exhibits a perpendicular section (highly magnified) of 
one of the minute tubers situated at and near the extremities of the 
forked fibres of the root, showing the insertion of the tap-shaped base 
of the tuber into the alburnum of the root of the tree ; the 2nd is a 
view of the longitudinal section of a leaf, through one of the parallel, 
perpendicular cavities or chambers excavated in the interior, each of 
these cells communicating with the external atmosphere by means of 
a very narrow opening " between the incurved lower edge of the leaf 
and the underside of the leaf-stalk;" the 3rd cut exhibits a magnified 
view of a transverse section of one of the subterranean leaves, wherein 
are shown all the cavities or cells divided in the middle, and lined 
with the minute, stalked papillee or glands, which perform the various 
functions of the absorbing and perspiring cuticular pores of most other 
plants, these pores being absent from the external cuticle of the sub- 
terranean parts of Lathraea.
One of the stations for Lathraea is given on the authority of Mr. Do- 
vaston; who says it is "naturalized to excess on hazel-roots at the 
Nursery, Westfelton." It will not perhaps be thought out of place 
here, if we introduce a quotation in reference to this naturalization, 
from a delightful article ycleped "Chit-chat," by Mr. Dovaston, in 
'Mag. Nat.
Hist.' v.
503.
" Von Osclal.
So you have at last succeeded in getting the toothwort (Lathraa 
rirnuunaria) to grow on the roots of the hazel ?
" Dovaslon.
Not until I had utterly despaired.
It was four years, and some fne, 
25 
before it came up visibly.
I gathered the seeds in Erddig woods, where, you may re- 
member, we saw it in profuse luxuriance.
It will, however, turn pink or purple when 
very much exposed to the light, notwithstanding the remark of our learned friend, in 
his scientific and elaborate essay; for having cut away some of the hazel branches, to 
bring it more in view of the walk, the sunbeams in a few days turned it so very pinky 
and purple, that some ladies were very much struck with the beauty and delicacy of its 
colours, though the plant itself is rather of a repulsive and cadaverous aspect." 
Of Bidens tripaHita, Linn., " specimens not unfreqiiently occur, in 
which the leaves are all undivided ; but attention to their being petio- 
late, and to the outer involucral bracteas being unequal, serrated, and 
many times longer than the flowers, will at once obviate any doubt 
which may by possibility arise, as to which species the plant ought to 
be referred." 
The list of Salopian Orchidese comprises 21 species; among which 
we are glad to recognise the names of 17 of our oldest friends, as well 
as of 4 rarer species with which our acquaintance commenced at a later 
period.
The former include Orchis ustulata, rare ; Habenaria viridis, 
chlorantha and bifolia, neither of them unfrequent ; Ophrys apifera, 
not unfrequent, and muscifera, very rare ; Neottia spiralis, not com- 
mon ; Listera ovata, frequent ; Neottidium Nidus-avis, not common ; 
Epipactis latifolia, not unfrequent, and palustris, not common.
The 
four rarer species are Gymnadenia albida, Ophrys aranifera, Listera 
cordata, all very rare in Shropshire; and Cephalanthera ensifolia, rare.
Gymnadenia albida, Scop.
Orchis albida, Sm., 'Eng. Fl.' iv.
18.
Habenaria albida, Br., Hook.
' Brit.
Fl.' 376.
" The structure of this plant is certainly that of Gymnadenia not Habenaria.
I am 
far from being certain that this genus and Aceras ought to be retained separate from 
Orchis.
Gymn.
conopsea comes so very near to Ore. pyramidalis in habit and appear- 
ance, as often to be hardly distinguishable without examination, and the structure of 
the anther is scarcely sufficiently diiferent to constitute a genus." â€” Bahington.
Neottidium Nidus-avis, Schltd.
Listera Nidus-avis, Hook.
' Fl.
Scot.' 253 ; ' Eng. Fl.' iv.
39 ; ' Br. Fl.' 379.
The non-parasitical na- 
ture of this plant, and its mode of propagation, have been determined 
by the Hon. and Rev. W.
H. Herbert ; the results of whose researches 
we here lay before oiu' readers.
" The Hon. and Rev. W.
H. Herbert has investigated the economy of this plant, 
which has been considered as parasitical on the roots of trees.
He found several dead 
flower-stalks which had grown out of bundles of fleshy fibres, diverging every way, but 
the fibres were falling apart, and the plant appeared to have died as an annual after 
flowering.
On stirring the ground further, at a short distance, he discovered a live 
bundle of similar fibres, with a very strong white shoot or eye, like the dormant shoot 
of a perennial herbaceous plant, which was evidently to produce a flowering-stem in 
the next summer.
Pursuing his researches he soon discovered similar bundles of dif- 
26 
ferent sizes, wbich were clearly immature, and not ready to sprout in the following 
spring.
On examination of the smallest, he found that it grew from the end of a half- 
dead fihre ; and recurring to the dead plant which he had first taken up, he perceived 
that its several fibres, or at least many of them, though dead at the base, were alive at 
the other end, and beginning to bristle or protrude young fibres near the extremity.
By further research, he clearly ascertained that the plant dies after flowering, but is ca- 
pable of reproducing a new plant from the point of each of its fibres after they have 
fallen apart, the extreme point becoming the eye or shoot, which increases in size till 
its maturity, and the lateral bristles becoming the fibres by which the plant is to be 
nourished and afterwards propagated.
The young roots continue thus to increase in 
bulk under ground till they come to the flowering age, when they push up vigorously, 
die and spawn again in the same extraordinary manner." â€” p.
434.
We regret that we have room for only one more extract, which is a 
graphic description from the pen of J.
F. M.
Dovaston, Esq., of a re- 
markable monoecious variety of the common yew, with pendulous 
hi'SincheSf {Taxus baccata, var.
/3.
Dovastoniana, Leighton), growing 
in that gentleman's grounds at Westfelton, near Shrewsbury, and figu- 
red in Loudon's 'Arboretum Britannicum,' iv.
2083, fig.
1990.
" It is about sixty years since my father John Dovaston, a man without education, 
but of unwearied industry and acute ingenuity, had with his own hands sunk and con- 
structed a pump ; and the soil being light, it continually fell in ; he secured it with 
wooden bars, but foreseeing their speedy decay, he planted near to it, a Yewtree, which 
he bought oS" a poor cobbler for sixpence, who had plucked it up from a hedge-bank 
near Sutton; rightly j udging that the fibrous and matting tendency of the yew-roots 
would hold up the soil.
They did so ; and independent of its utility, the yew (as you 
have to your great admiration witnessed) grew into a tree of the most striking and dis- 
tinguished beauty ; spreading horizontally all around to a diameter of 63 feet, with a 
single spiral leader to a great height; each branch in every direction dangling in tressy 
verdure down to the very ground, pendulous and playful as the most graceful birch 
or willow, and visibly obedient to the feeblest breath of summer air.
Its foliage, like 
that of the asparagus, is admirably adapted for retaining the dew-drops ; and at sun- 
rise it would seem that Titania and a bevy of her fairies had been revelling the night 
around it, and left their lamps in capricious frolick, so glitteringly coruscant is every 
branch with its millions of every-coloured scintillations, as it were all a-blaze.
To de- 
scend, however, to prose : â€” this lovely tree has food for the mind of the philosopher, as 
well as for the eye of the poet; for, strange to tell, and what few unseeing believed, 
though a male, and smoking like furnace, or a very volcano, with farina to the blasts 
of February, it has one entire branch self-productive, and exuberantly profuse in Fe- 
male berries, full, red, rich, and luscious ; from which I have raised 17 plants, every 
one of which already markedly partakes largely of the parents' pensility.
Of these 
seedlings several have been presented to the following friends.
* * The 
remaining trees are still in my possession, and are intended to be distributed to Socie- 
ties or persons who will undertake to plant them in situations where they are likely to 
be preserved.
Berries will also, at the proper season, be given with pleasure to such 
persons who may be curious in these matters." â€” p.
497.
The plates, 19 in number, are a somewhat novel feature in a local 
27 
Flora ; of their utility, however, there can be but one opinion.
With 
the exception of Nos. 5 and 11 they are filled with magnified figures 
and sections of the fruit and its appendages of such closely-allied spe- 
cies as are best distinguished by a reference to those parts ; including 
9 species of Potamogeton, 9 of Rumex, 27 of the 34 species of Um- 
belliferae found in Shropshire, all the British Carices, and 18 species 
belonging to other genera of Cyperaceae.
In plate 5 are shown the 
variations in the form of the leaves and mode of inflorescence of Che- 
nopodium polyspermum, Linn., the erect, acute-leaved form of which, 
at the suggestion of his friend Mr. Davall, Sir J.
E. Smith described 
and figured as a distinct species under the name of Chen, acutifolium, 
in *Eng. Bot.' xxi.
t. 1481 : and plate 11 is entirely filled with details 
explanatory of the curious economy of Colchicum autumnale.
In concluding this brief and imperfect notice of the 'Flora of Shrop- 
shire,' we feel that we cannot too strongly recommend it to the notice 
of our readers.
For although, as a local Flora, it professes to treat 
only of the plants of a single county, that county produces more than 
half the number of species of flowering plants indigenous to the king- 
dom.
The descriptions are unusually full and carefully drawn up : and 
when we add that some of the less understood species have been il- 
lustrated by the critical remarks and observations of some of our most 
eminent botanists, as for instance, many of the Hieracia and Orchideje 
by Mr. Babington, the oaks by Professors Don and Graham, and the 
Cerasi by Dr. Bromfield and Messrs.
Borrer, Dovaston and Forster, 
and that throughout the work there is constant reference to the state 
of the science on the continent and to the works of modem continen- 
tal botanists, we think we have good grounds for saying that the 
' Flora of Shropshire ' should be in the hands of every one who feels 
interested in the botanical productions of the British isles.

Art. IX.
â€” Varieties ; Original and Select.
1 .
L YCOPODIUM clavatum.
I may observe that this plant makes a beautiful ob- 
ject when cultivated in a greenhouse, and suspended from the roof or side walls.
I 
have seen it in such situations with branches from three to four feet long, flowering 
most abundantly, and having a peculiarly imposing appearance : in this state it is not 
readily recognized by persons familiar with it in its ordinary localities.
â€” D.
Moore ;* 
Dublin, May 2A, 1841.
2. Plants in the neighbourhood of Falmouth, Comvmll.
This comer of England is 
by no means devoid of interest to a lover of Botany.
I think thou wilt like to know 
what plants I have already seen.
The first I was struck with was Cotyledon Umbili- 
cus, which grows in the greatest profusion ; not a hedge but is studded with it.
The 
hedges here are banks of earth or loose rocky stones, and are overgrown with verdure, 
mostly affording on their top a convenient foot-path.
In a lane, close by, grows Sib- 
thorpia in abundance ; also Anchusa sempervirens quite commonly.
Thrift of course, 
on the coast ; and some species of Cochlearia, one of which is said to be Danica, but 
I cannot see that the pouch is reticulated with veins.
Cardamine hirsuta is very 
common.
Senebiera didyma is a weed growing against the walls of houses.
Smyr- 
nium Olusatrum plentiful.
Viola lactea, with its peculiar leaves, almost as common 
as canina.
Myrica Gale grows in the same marsh as Menyanthes.
On a promontoiy 
crowned with Pendennis Castle grow Mcenchia erecta, Silene maritima, Spergula sub- 
ulata and Ranunculus parviflora.
Melittis grandiflora grows in two or three localities 
near the sea.
Oxalis corniculata is said to grow sparingly in the hedges.
All the 
plants mentioned, except Oxalis, I have seen myself; no doubt there are others, equal- 
ly rare, to be found as the year advances.
The Melittis found here agrees with the 
description of grandiflora, except in the calyx, which seems more like that of Melisso- 
phyllum.
Vaccinium Myrtillus is common.
â€” Daniel Peirson ; Falmouth, 5th month 
(May) 28, 1841.
3. Rare Plants in West Surrey.
Ribes rubrum and nigrum, the former in many 
places, the latter abundantly in one place, by the side of the Mole near Esher : per- 
fectly wild and completely naturalized.
Turritis glabra, abundant and fine by the 
road-side between Hampton and Sunbury.
Diplotaxis tenuifolia, a rare plant in Sur- 
rey, is very abundant above Walton Bridge, Cerastium arvense, on banks by the side 
of the Thames below Walton Bridge.
â€” /.
S. Mill ; Kensington, June 1, 1841.
4. Isatis tinctoria is now growing in prodigious luxuriance in the chalk-quarries close 
to the town [of Guildford].
It grows (in many instances) out of clefts in the precipi- 
tous chalk cliff, and makes almost a bush of flowers from the same root.
Geranium 
lucidum I again found in my old locality, near St. Catherine's Hill.
â€” Id. June 8, 1841.
5. Aconitum Napellus, This beautiful plant occurs abundantly in various locali- 
ties in the immediate neighbourhood of Leominster in Herefordshire ; its growth is 
luxuriant, and its habitat is invariably the bank of one of the numerous rivulets which 
so abound in that fluviatile district.
It is introduced into the gardens in the town, 
and grows with health and vigour when removed from its native humid station.
Sir 
W. J.
Hooker, in ' Brit.
Flora,' i.
264, mentions this as " a doubtful native," but I 
have seldom seen a plant which exhibits more manifest symptoms of being indigenous.
Edivard Newman ; 45, Wellclose Square, June 21, 1841.
* In a letter to E.
Newman,

6. Inula Helenium.
This noble plant grows in a field at Stoke, near Leominster, 
in great luxuriance, sometimes attaining the height of 7 feet.
The exact site is at the 
foot of some unusually tall poplars ; indeed so conspicuous are these poplars that they 
serve as a guide to the spot, even from a distance of two miles.
I have also seen it 
near Knightsford Bridge, in a wood on the right hand, close adjoining the turnpike

7. Pelargonium tricolor.
In making a short cut over a stony hill (primitive sand- 
stone, the general rock of this country) covered with low bushes, T noticed in the fissure 
of a rock, the elegant Pelargonium tricolor in blossom.
This to me was like recogniz- 
ing an old forgotten acquaintance, of a pleasant character ; for the existence of this 
old but elegant and delicate inhabitant of English greenhouses, had quite passed from 
my mind ; till (scarcely raised above the stone on which it grew) a large cluster of its 
pure white blossoms, shaded into blackish crimson, met my eye in this inhospitable re- 
gion, and revived many associations in connection with the persons under whose care 
I had seen it cultivated.- -James Backhouse^s Journal, part 7 : South Africa.
8. Spontaneous appearance of Plants.
Eaton mentions [the raspberry] by the name 
of Rubus Idaeus among the native plants.
It grows and spreads abundantly, so as 
quickly to overspread a large space of ground.
I have never seen it in the primitive 
woods ; but whenever a clearing is made the raspberry appears.
* * The bushes 
are extremely numerous on every road-side and almost in every field, growing in the cor- 
ner of the fences, springing up abundantly in ground recently cleared and" burnt over ;" 
and invariably forming a great bush around every dead stump or neglected log.
* 
Poplars are very rarely seen in the primitive forest : but if a clearing be made, and 
neglected for a few years, the ground will be covered with a new growth of trees, usu- 
ally called "second growth timber," consisting almost wholly of poplars, provided the 
land be slightly disposed to wetness.
The'cause of this I cannot in anywise explain.
It is not confined to the case I have mentioned : it has very often been observed that 
when forests are destroyed, they are succeeded by a spontaneous growth of plants of 
altogether different species from those which originally occupied the ground.
How 
are they produced ?
From seed, certainly : but whence comes the seed ?
Has it lain 
in the ground for uncounted ages, waiting a favourable opportunity to spring up ?
I 
cannot tell ; this is one of those mysterious things which I am not at all adequate to 
unfold ; I can only notice the fact.

9. Typha latifolia.
Have you ever examined any of that large patch of bull-rushes 
(Typha latifolia) which grow in the bottom of this field ?
It is difficult to get at them, 
as it is a complete bog all around, but they are so curious that they repay the trouble 
of obtaining them.
The thick cylindrical head appears like a fine but very closely set 
brush radiating from the axis or stalk, which it covers for about six inches.
On pick- 
ing out a lump of what we may call the bristles of this brush, we are surprised to see 
that we have a handful of the softest down, that which before was not larger than 
one's thumb, now, on being freed from the stalk, filling one's hand ; and the hiatus 
made by the loss is filled up by the expansion of the remainder so completely as scarcely 
to be perceivable.
In short the whole head is composed of this very expansive down ; 
and I am told that poor persons sometimes collect quantities of it to make beds, which 
are said to be soft and elastic.

Red and Green Snow.
In the 44th No. of Taylors' ' Annals and Magazine of 
Natural History,' is the translation of a paper from Weigmann's Archiv.
(Heft.
i. 1840), 
entitled "On Red and Green Snow; by the late Prof.
Meyen:" from which we learn 
32 
that M.
Cli. Martins, who twice accompanied the French expedition to Spitzhergen, 
is of opinion that the colouring matter of red snow, Protococcus nivalis, and of green 
snow, Frot.
viridis, " are one and the same plant, only in different stages of develop- 
ment." Prof.
Meyen, however, considers it to be still a question whether the colours 
of the snow are really produced by different states of the same species, but he has no 
doubt that the so-called Protococci belong, not to the vegetable but to the animal 
Mngdom, being true Infusoria; that Protococcus viridis is identical with Ehrenberg's 
Euglena viridis and Prot.
nivalis with his Â£Jug. sanguinea, (the Enchelis sanguinea and 
Pulvisculus of authors) ; that these Euchelides " exhibit at times a perfectly motion- 
less state, in which they appear spherical," and that in this state they have been de- 
scribed as Protococci ; that " it is these spherical, reposing animalcules which often 
appear in almost incredible numbers, and, surrounded with a kind of slime, form more 
or less thick skins, which frequently cover the bottoms of shallow standing waters;" 
and it is in consequence of observing that these animalcules, after long remaining in 
this passive and inert state, occasionally resume their activity, that so many philoso- 
phers have spoken of a metamorphosis of Infusoria into plants, and vice versa.

â€” John Eeynolds, Esq., Treasurer, in the Chair.
Dr. Killikelly (of Indiana) presented a specimen 
of TiUandsia tJsneoides fi-om the banks of the Mississippi.
Dr. John Lhotsky read a paper " On the Periodical Decortication of the genus Eucalyptus in Australia." 
After describing the appearance of the bark hanging in strips from the trunks and branches of the Eucalypti, 
Dr. Lhotsky observed that in addition to this singular effect, the varying colour of the denuded ti-unks and 
branches, from pui-e white through all shades to deep red, presents an equally original and characteristic as- 
pect.
Little is yet known as to the period of decortication; and the questions to be determined by future ob- 
servers are, 1 st, Whether the decortication of the different species of Eucalypti takes place at any certain season 
or is dependent on other cu'cumstances ; and 2dly, Whether all the species decorticate at the same period, or 
the different species at different times.
The cause of a phenomenon apparent in so gi'eat a number of a 
genus scattered most widely over the Ausfci'alian continent, is matter of importance for physical Geogi-aphy, 
and for Botany especially.
And Dr. Lhotsky thinks a clew towards its explanation may be obtained thi-ough 
that botanical axiom, that the concentric layers of wood and bark are the reverse of each other, the foi-mer in- 
creasing externally, the other internally.
As exogenous plants (like the Eucalypti) increase by annual addi- 
tions of new matter on their outsides, it is plausible to say, that as the growth of the Eucalypti, in almost all 
the species, is very rapid, the alburnum of these trees extends so rapidly that the liber first becomes considerably 
distended, then cracks, and finally separates from the trunk.
The New Hollanders have largely taken advantage 
of this phenomenon.
The huts or sheds temporarily occupied by them are made of the sheets of the bark of the 
Eucalypti.
It is on such sheets that they repose, and protect themselves from the humidity of the soil.
From 
such sheets also they make their most rude canoes, (with which, however, they only navigate the lakes) ; they 
bind them in an adequate manner, and fill up the crevices with soil and melted gum.
The New Hollander 
possesses neither flint nor steel; and as he finds it difficult to produce fire, he carries with him on his aquatic 
excursions, a piece of a large ignited branch of an Eucalyptus, which, fi'om its resinous natiu'e, burns like a 
torch.
In conclusion.
Dr. L.
obsei-ved, â€” " Taking all this, and what I have said in previous papers, together, 
the New Hollander may, with some degiee of propriety, be called the ' Eucalyptus-man.'â€” G.

The Savin-leaved Club-moss, as its name of alpinum implies, is 
completely an alpine plant : it occurs in great abundance on the ele- 
vated tracts in Scotland, where I have myself seen it in localities too 
numerous to detail; and have received a long list of habitats from Drs.
Greville and Balfour, Mr. Graham, &c.
Tn several of the adjacent 
islands it is also found ; and Mr. Edmonston has sent a specimen from 
Unst, the most northerly of the Shetlands ; this specimen is ticketed 
"Lycopodium clavatum'''' (which species is not in the collection), and 
unfortunately is so recorded in a late number of the * Annals and Ma- 
gazine of Natural History.'* Mr. Edmonston, vrith a laudable desire 
to make his list as correct as possible, sent the plants themselves for 
comparison ; and it has happened that I have had frequent opportu- 
nities of examining the collection.
In North Wales it seems to be 
abundant on the high ground in Caernarvonshire ; particularly on the 
ascents of Snowdon, Glyder, David, Llewellyn, &c., but it seldom 
occurs immediately on their summits.
Mr. Janson, Mr. Kippist, and 
others have given me similar habitats : in Denbighb shire, and on Ca- 
der Idris in Merionethshire, it occurs more sparingly.
In England, 
Northumberland, Cumberland, Westmoreland, Durham, Yorkshire, 
and Lancashire produce the species in some abundance; Miss Beever 
informs me it is " plentiful on the Fells near Coniston." In Turner 
and Dillwyn's 'Botanist's Guide,' i.
193, a single Cheshire habitat, 
â€” " Moors above Micklehurst," â€” is recorded on the authority of Mr.
Bradley; and in the same work (i.
192), on the authority of Mr. J.
Martin, it is said to have been found on "Mountains near the Der- 
went" in Derbyshire.
In Ireland I found it sparingly in the counties 
Donegal and Kerry ; and Mr. Moore has seen it on Knocklayd, Co.
Antrim, near Belfast, and on the Mourne Mountains.
Mr. Ball of 
Dublin writes me that he found it on Mangerton ; and having spelled 
the name for the benefit of that nuisance to tourists, the self-styled 
Sir Peter Courtney, that worthy engraved it on a flat stone with the 
point of his knife, and doubtless displays his botanical lore for the 
edification of future tourists, and to the profound admiration and hu- 
miliation of his brother guides.
Our early botanists have so mixed up this with another continental 
species, Lycopodium complanatum, that it is impossible to decide to 
which their observations are to be referred.
I have little doubt that 
Gerarde describes alpinum, although his figure evidently represents 
complanatum, and Tragus appears to be unacquainted with it altoge- 
* In the same list Lomaria spicaiit appears as "Polypodium vulgare." 
35 
ther, his figure being likewise that of coraplanatum.
Dillenius, as re- 
marked by Sir J.
E. Smith, was well acquainted with both species, but 
unaccountably misquotes Tragus, Gerarde, Dalechamp, and the two 
Bauhins, under his description of L.
alpinum : owing to this confu- 
sion it is unsafe to quote any of the virtues, real or supposed, that have 
been assigned by these patriarchs of the science to either species.
We are informed by Sir W.
J. Hooker that Lye. alpinum is used by 
the inhabitants of Iceland as a die for their woollen cloths.
" A vast 
heap of Lycopodium alpinum lying before the priest's house drew my 
attention, and on enquiry I found that it was used for the purpose of 
giving their wadmal* a yellow die, which is done by merely boiling 
the cloth in water, with a quantity of the Lycopodium and some leav^es 
of Vaccinium uliginosum.
The colour imparted by this process, to 
judge from some cloth shown me, was a pale and pleasant, though 
not a brilliant yellow." f 
The savin-leaved club-moss is a pretty plant, in its foliage much re- 
sembling the savin from which it has derived its English name : it 
retains throughout the winter a much brighter green than either of its 
congeners : in summer the young shoots have a blue tint.
According 
to Sir W.
J. Hooker it is the badge of the clan Macrae.
The roots are tough, strong, wiry, and generally tortuous and 
branched ; they occur at intervals varying from two to four inches, and 
are somewhat darker in colour than those of Lye. clavatum ; they fix 
the plant firmly to the soil.
The stem is procumbent, extending to a great length, and throwing 
up at short intervals clusters of branches, which, being twice or thrice 
dichotomously divided, give the plant a densely tufted appearance : 
the tips of the branches or divisions in each bunch or tuft are of nearly 
equal length, the extremities tenninating on a level.
When the plant 
is about to produce seed, spikes are thrown out from the extremities of 
these branches without any intermediate foot-stalk: the spikes are ra- 
ther more than half an inch in length, and somewhat exceed the uu- 
fruitful branches in thickness, and are of a paler, yellower green colour 
than the rest of the plant : they are almost invariably in double pairs, 
plainly exhibiting the repeatedly dichotomous division of the branches 
which they terminate.
The entire plant is covered with elongate, harsh, indistinctly keeled, 
obtusely pointed leaves ; the edges of the leaves are without percepti- 
ble teeth or serratures, and the points have no acute or filamentous

tennination : the leaves or bracts in the spike are membranous, flat, 
scale-like, serrated at the sides, dilated at the base, and terminating in 
a prolonged point at the apex.
After the escape of the seeds the spikes 
bend downwards, assuming a semicircular form, and the bracts become 
reflexed.
The thecEe are sessile, of a pale yellow colour, and in form much 
resembling a kidney bean.

â€” Short Account of an Excursion to Cohham, Kent.
By Al. Ievine, Esq.
Albury, June 21, 1841.
Sir, 
If you think the following short account of a visit to Cob- 
ham, Kent, worth your notice, you are welcome to insert it in ' The 
Phytologist,' to which I wish much success.
Yours very truly, 
Al. Irvine.
To the Editor of ' The Phytologist.' 
On Whitmonday, May 31, 1841, my friend Mr. Wm.
Pamplin, jun.
and myself left London Bridge in one of the steamers about 8 o'clock 
A, M., and arrived at Gravesend by half-past 10.
We then started for 
Cobham across the fields, a walk which may be accomplished with 
ease in little more than an hour.
Among the com we found Papaver 
hybridum, Adonis autumnalis, Ajuga Chamsepitys, Bupleurum rotun- 
difolium, &c.
After passing through the village of Cobham towards the park, be- 
yond the carpenter's shop and yard, in a corner partly in the wood and 
partly on the little waste ground between the cornfield and the wood 
skirting the park, we gathered a species of Tragopogon,* which Mr.
Pamplin, who showed me the spot, told me, as far as I can recollect, 
is an undescribed or unrecognised species.
From the spot where the Tragopogon grows we walked along the 
verge of the park, having the park on our left hand and the corn-fields 
on our right, and in a few minutes arrived at most magnificent plants of 
Astragalus glycyphyllos, growing in great abundance; we also ob- 
* See next page.
37 
served a few plants of Lathyius Nissolia.
Hence cutting across, that 
is, avoiding the windings of the park, and going over a rising part of 
the ground, we reached the field where Althaea hirsuta is this year in 
gi'eat profusion.
This field extends quite up to the park, and is per- 
haps about half an hour's easy walk from Cobham.
Salvia pratensis 
is found in the same spot, all along the bank on the extremity of the 
field, and close to the park.
The ground rises as one walks towards 
Rochester, and that city is seen after passing along the head of this 
field and part of the next.
After collecting some specimens of Althaea hirsuta and Salvia pra- 
tensis, the latter plant being at that time most luxuriant and beautiful, 
we crossed the fields by a path which leads to the road between Cux- 
ton and Hailing, on the Medway.
On the steep chalky downs or pas- 
tures about midway between these two villages, we found numerous and 
fine plants of columbine (Aquilegia vulgaris), the flowers of which were 
of a deep and exquisite blue ; also specimens of Orchis fuse a and va- 
rious other Orchidaceous plants.
My fiiend Mr. Pampliu had the 
pleasure of finding a curious variety of Ophrys niuscifera.
Between 
an ancient religious house and Cuxton, going towards the latter place 
on the right hand, and nearer to the said house than to the village of 
Cuxton, we gathered Anchusa sempervirens under the hedge ; a plant 
very rarely found, but which has been occasionally noticed as belong- 
ing to this spot, since the times of the earliest botanists.
Near the 
road between Gad's Hill and Gravesend, grow Lathyrus latifolius or 
sylvestris and Fumaria parviflora.
These places, together with the marshes about the Medway, will 
well repay the labour of investigation ; especially to such as have a 
taste for the cultivation of local Botany.
[In a subsequent communication dated July 8tli, Mr. Irvine kindly favours us with 
some remarks on the Tragopogon mentioned at p.
36, which Mr. Pamplin has observ- 
ed in the same spot at Cobham for several years.
Mr. Irvine also added from Koch's 
' Flora Germanica,' a description of Tragopogon orientalis, Linn., with which species 
the Cobham plant agrees in the peduncles being cylindrical, and only slightly swollen 
immediately under the flowers, in the number of leaflets (8) of the involucre, and in 
the florets being much longer than the involucre.
These, however, are almost the only 
particulars in which the Cobham plant agrees with Trag.
orientalis ; and having care- 
fully examined fine and perfect specimens with which Mr. Pamplin has obligingly 
furnished us, we find them to agree so exactly with the description of Trag.
pratensis 
in 'â–  English Flora,' iii.
388, even to the curling of the tips of the long and gradually 
tapering leaves, that we have little doubt of the Cobham plant being that species in a 
state of great luxuriance, and with the florets longer than usual, which Sir J.
E. Smith 
says is sometimes the case.
Our opinion is strengthened by finding that in the Cob- 
38 
ham plant the ligules are streaked with brown on the under side, and that the anthers 
are brown â€” characters which Linnaeus, in contrasting Trag.
orientalis and pratensis in 
his ' Species Plan tarum,' expressly states that the former species does not possess ; * 
moreover, the marginal achenia in our plant are muricated with tubercles, not with 
scales, as those of Trag.
orientalis are stated to be by Koch.f 
We may tale this opportunity of mentioning our ^belief that the common plant of 
our meadows and pastures is Tragopogon minor of Fries, Nov. 2nd ed.
291, in which 
the involucre is about twice as long as the florets, and the peduncles much swollen im- 
mediately beneath the flowers ; at least this is the plant we have generally met with.
Ray's remark that in Tragopogon the rays of the calyx are longer than the flowers,^ 
would seem to favour this opinion ; Relhan also observes that the corolla is sometimes 
shorter than the calyx.
Â§ We should be glad to receive communications on this and 
other doubtful points connected with the history of British plants.

â€” Notes on Plants growing in the neighbourhood of 
Guildford, Surrey.
By J.
S. Mill, Esq.
Impatiens fulva.
At whatever period introduced, this plant is now 
SO thoroughly naturalized, that it would be pedantry any longer to re- 
fuse it that place in the English Flora, which has been accorded on 
less strong grounds to many plants originally introduced from abroad.
For many miles by the side of the Wey, both above and below Guild- 
ford, it is as abundant as the commonest river-side plants, the Lythrum 
Salicaria or Epilobium hirsutum ; and my friend Mr. Henry Cole in- 
forms me that it is found in various places by the same river all the 
w^ay to its junction with the Thames.
It is equally abundant on the 
banks of the Tillingboume, that beautiful tributary of the Wey; espe- 
cially at Chilworth, where it grows in boundless profusion: and near 
Albury, where I saw it for the first time in 1822.
The plant stated by 
Sir J.
E. Smith to be growing near Guildford, under the name of Im- 
patiens Noli-me-tangere, is doubtless no other than this plant.
The 
Noli-me-tangere, which I have seen growing about Windermere, in 
the Pyrenees, and in Switzerland, is very distinct from this.
Â« 
Geranium lucidum ; in most of the lanes about Guildford.
Fumaria capreolata ; near Losely, and by the roadside between 
Guildford and MeiTOw.
Fumaria parviflora ; in corn-fields on the summit and southern de- 
clivity of the Hog's Back ; and in lanes at its foot.
Valerianella dentata (or Fedia dentata) ; corn-fields on the chalk 
hills on both sides of Guildford, abundantly.
41 
Isatis tinctoria ; in great perfection in the chalk-pits close to the 
town, on the Shalford road ; as noticed in ' The Phytologist,' p.
30.
Hippuris vulgaris ; in one of the ponds in Clandon Park.
Bupleurtim rotundifolium.
This plant grew, last summer, in a 
corn-field on the brow of the hill by the path leading from Guildford 
to Martha's Chapel.
The field having been sown this summer with a 
gTeen crop, which was removed early, the plant cannot now be found.
Campanula hyhrida ; abundant in the lower part of the same field.
Corydalis claviculata.
This plant formerly grew close to Martha's 
Chapel, but I have sought for it this year in vain.
Dipsacus pilosus ; most abundant near Chilworth, especially in the 
hanging wood.
Androscemiim ojfficmale ; near Albury, but sparingly.
Saponaria officinalis ; near Shere.
Stellaria glauca.
This interesting and elegant plant grows in 
marshy meadows by the river Wey, near the foot of St. Catherine's Hill.
Menyanthes trifoliata ; now (whatever may formerly have been the 
case) a rare plant in Surrey.
It grows on Gomshall Common, in the 
vale of Albury ; where I also once found a double variety of Carda- 
mine pratensis.

â€” Botanical Notes.
By George Luxford, A.L.S., F.B.S.E.
Under this title will occasionally be laid before the readers of 
*The Phytologist,' any interesting particulars relating to British 
plants that may happen to fall under my observation, in the hope that 
such notices will, in doubtfal cases, lead to farther enquiry.
Silene injlata, Sm. A short time back while looking over the her- 
barium of Mr. Wm.
Bennett, I found two specimens of a plant from 
the collection of one of his friends, ticketed " Silene Otites : Wool- 
wich Marshes : June, 1836." These were specimens of a curious 
state of Silene inflata, somewhat similar to the female variety of that 
species stated by Linnaeus to be frequent in the Upsal garden ; but I 
have no recollection of having met with a record of the previous oc- 
currence of anything similar to it in Britain.
The stem and leaves of 
the Woolwich specimens are the same as those of the plant in its usual 
state ; the panicle also is repeatedly dichotomous and spreading, but 
the flowers are crowded together into a compact head at the extremity 
of each of its branches.
The flowers themselves have neither the in- 
flated calyx nor the large white petals of the perfect plant, but in size 
and general appearance bear a strong resemblance to those of the 
fertile plant of Silene Otites.
They consist of four or five membrana- 
ceous scales or bracteas, slightly streaked and reticulated with purple, 
and inclosing several follicular bodies, each of which terminates in a 
twisted, purple, style-like point.
In one of the flowers which I exa- 
mined there were ten of these bodies, the five central ones cohering 
and forming an ovarium with five styles, the outer five being fiee and 
detached.
I could discover nothing resembling stamina.
I subjoin a description of the Upsal variety of Silene inflata (the 
Cucubalus Behen of Linnaeus) from the ' Species Plantarum,' whereby 
the differences between that and our plant will at once be perceived.
" A female variety is frequent in the Upsal garden.
This is smaller 
than the perfect plant.
The calyx is exactly ovate, not oblong-ovate, 
and more obscure : corolla smaller : lamina half the length of the co- 
rolla, terminating in a tubercle without anthers : styles 3 â€” 5, longer 
than the corolla, turned to one side : each plant is fertile." * 
* Cucubalus Behen " Varietas Feminea in Horto upsaliense frequens.
Haec 
Hermaphrodito minor.
Calyces exacte ovati, magis obscuri, nee oblongo-ovati.
Co- 
rolla minor.
Stamina corolla dimidio breviora terminata tuberculo absque antheris.
Styli 3 s.
5, corolla longiores, declinati.
Planta utraque fertilis." â€” ' Sp. PI.' 591, 
43 
The above description of the Woolwich plant is very imperfect; the 
specimens had apparently been dried by the application of heat and 
considerable pressure, so that immersion in boiling water did not re- 
store them to a good state for examination.
The present notice may 
however lead to the detection of this variety (or rather monstrosity) in 
other localities.
Monotropa Hypopitys.
I have long wished that some able botanist 
would seriously set to work on this plant, in order to determine whe- 
ther it be really a parasite or not.
The question has been settled with 
regard to Lathraea ; and there is no doubt that a series of observations 
conducted in the same candid spirit which characterises the investiga- 
tions of Mr. Bowman, would in this case lead to equally satisfactory, 
though I suspect somewhat different results.
From my earliest botani- 
zing days I have felt much interested in the enquiry, and have neglected 
no opportunity of endeavouring to ascertain whether a connection does 
really exist between this plant and the roots of the trees among which 
it grows ; but either from not being able to command the requisite time 
or necessary patience, my researches have hitherto led to nothing sa- 
tisfactory.
In the neighbourhood of Reigate the Monotropa grows 
under the beeches in the rather stiff clay capping the chalk hills.
On 
taking up a tuft containing several individuals of Monotropa growing 
in a large lump of soil, I have generally found that however loose and 
friable the upper surface might be, the lower part was invariably hard 
and thoroughly permeated by the fibres of the beech-roots.
It is al- 
most impossible, in clearing away this part of the soil, to avoid break- 
ing off the very brittle fibrous roots of the Monotropa ; the fibres of 
the beech, being much tougher, may, with a little care, be extracted 
in considerable lengths.
One would suppose, if the plant were really 
parasitical, that to these beech-fibres we should find attached at least 
some small portions of its roots ; this I have not observed to be the 
case.
Steeping the clay in water in order that it may be washed from 
the plants, appears rather to have the effect of rendering it harder : I 
once had a tuft in water for upwards of a week, but the steeping did 
no good.
I have generally found a number of young detached plants of Mo- 
notropa dispersed through the lump of earth : they vary in size from 
little, white, pea-like bodies to half an inch or upwards in height; and 
I should say are certainly not connected with the beech-roots.
I am 
inclined to believe that a portion at least of the nourishment of this 
plant is derived from a layer of vegetable matter, consisting chiefly 
of the slowly decaying leaves of the beech, which are generally co- 
vered with a white byssoid fungus.
44 
I shall be exceedingly glad to learn that some favourably situated 
botanist has been able to settle that long-debated point, â€” the parasit- 
ical or non-parasitical character of Monotropa.

â€” Notice of * A History of British Forest Trees.^ By 
Prideaux John Selby, F.R.S.E., F.L.S., Etc. London : John 
Van Voorst.
Parti.
July, 1841.
This work is to appear in monthly numbers, and is printed uni- 
formly with the series of British Quadrupeds, Fishes, Birds &c.
The 
Jirst number is now before us.
Although in announcing the Phytologist we have drawn no line be- 
tween the botanical productions of Britain and the more showy plants 
of sunnier climes, yet we freely confess that we feel a strong bias in 
favour of everything indigenous ; and the discovery of a moss or some 
rare flower in an unrecorded and unexpected habitat, gives us more 
pleasure than the importation of cargoes of the choicest exotics : the 
word "British" compensating abundantly for sobriety of colouring or 
humility of stature.
Influenced by this feeling we take up Selby's 
* British Forest Trees ' with the most perfect and entire good will, and 
it is with some feelings of compunction that we pen even a single line 
which may be taken for dispraise.
The number before us contains portraits of eight trees ; the lime, the 
American lime, the sycamore, the Norway maple, the common maple, 
the horse-chesnut, the holly and the Robinia, commonly but erroneously 
called the acacia.
Of these the maple and the holly are unquestiona- 
bly British, the lime as cultivated and the sycamore have a doubtful 
claim, and the remaining four have no claim at all.
This seems to us 
scarcely in accordance with the title.
We do not complain that Mr.
Selby has attempted any misrepresentation ; on the contrary his work 
supplies abundant evidence of our assertion, that four only of the trees 
are reputed to be British.
We submit therefore whether it would not 
be well to amend the title of the work by the introduction of the words 
" indigenous or introduced : " this would give the public a much bet- 
ter idea of the real object of Mr. Selby's undertaking.
The figures of the trees are beautifully cut, but have the demerit, if 
so it may be called, of being drawn from extraordinary specimens ; 
thus, although we have no doubt that the figures are faithfiil portraits 
of certain trees that do exist, yet in exuberance of growth they so far 
45 
exceed their kith and kin, that we fail to recognise in them the forms 
of our old famihar friends.
The detached figures of the leaf and 
florification are admirable : nothing can be better than the sprig of 
holly at p.
47 ; and the botanist will justly attach greater value to these 
details, than to the more showy effigies of the trees themselves.
The following specimens of the letter-press are from the descrip- 
tions of the sycamore and the common holly.
" Frequently as we hear the sycamore abused as not worth growing for the value 
of its timber, and devoid, as an ornamental tree, of beauty of outline and picturesque 
effect, we nevertheless agree with Sir T.
Dick Lauder, that it is ' certainly a noble tree.' 
Vying in point of magnitude with the oak, the ash, and other trees of the first rank, it 
presents a grand unbroken mass of foliage, contrasting well, in appropriate situations, 
and when judiciously grouped, with trees of a lighter and more airy character, and af- 
fording, as Gilpin expresses it, ' an impenetrable shade.' Lauder well observes, ' The 
spring tints of the sycamore are rich, tender, glowing, and harmonious ; in summer its 
deep green hue accords well with its grand and massive form, and the brown and din- 
gy reds of its autumnal tints harmonise well with the mixed grove to which they give 
a fine depth of tone.' The colour of the bark is also agreeable to the eye, being of a 
fine ash grey, frequently broken into patches of different hues, by the peeling off, in old 
trees, of large flakes of the outer bark, in the manner of the plane." â€” p.
15.
" In natural woods, and especially in the deep glens and rocky denes of our nor- 
thern districts, however beautiful and diversified the sceneiy may be, it never fails to 
receive an additional life and charm wherever the holly is present to intermingle its 
glossy foliage with the various tints around it.
Oft have we stood and lingered in our 
walks to watch and admire the bright and fleeting lights produced by our favourite 
evergreen, as moved by the gentle zephyr, its polished leaves have reflected in dia- 
mond-like coruscations, the rays of light as they penetrated the recesses in which it 
grew, at the same time that its rich dark green foliage, by force of contrast, gave an 
additional value to the paler tints of the mountain ash, the hazel, and various other 
shrubs which grew around it." â€” p.

Value of Botanical Notes.
I am glad to see any fresh effort to extend botani- 
cal knowledge, and yours seems to be well calculated for this purpose.
I hope that 
your solicitation for " the slightest piece of information " will be responded to, for these 
little affairs are sometimes productive of much pleasure and interest to succeeding bo- 
tanists.
I recollect an instance.
A correspondent wrote to me for a specimen of As- 
pidium fragile, Stvartz : I sought it in vain : but on turning to Withering I found 
mention of a station within two miles of my own house, where it had been found thirty 
years before by a lady who happened to have a temporary residence close to the spot.
I went in search of it, and had the delight to find a single plant, â€” the only one I have 
ever discovered in the neighbourhood.

Supposed effect of Chlorine on Blue Flowers.
As we are alluding to trifles, I 
will mention a circumstance which may lead to further enquiry.
Near to the British 
46 
Alkali Works, in Worcestershire, I found a white variety of Campanula patula.
This 
called my attention to the appearance of the species generally, and also to Campanula 
rotundifolia, both being abundant in the neighbourhood.
I observed that the flowers 
of each species were in every instance much paler that I had been used to see them, 
and I have not the least doubt that the chlorine, which was then thrown ofi" in great 
abundance from the alkali works, produced this effect.
I am not supposing that the 
flowers, on expansion, were really bleached by a vitiated atmosphere ; but I believe 
that the chlorine had an influence on the juices of the plants, and prevented the deve- 
lopment of the usual colour of their flowers.

Polypodium Dryopteris and Allosorus crispus grow among rocky debris [on the 
Malvern Hills], a locality not mentioned in Mr. Newman's beautiful work on British 
Ferns, and thus proving that the geographical distribution of species can hardly be sa- 
tisfactorily determined without the extensive aid of local botanists.

South Cottage, Malvern Wells, July 12, 1841.
14.
Asplenium viride.
While on the subject of ferns I will just mention a curious 
locality for the green spleenwort (Asplenium viride), proving at the same time the te- 
nacity of existence exhibited by these mural insinuators.
About fourteen years ago 
some plants gathered by the late Mr. T.
B. Stretch, of Worcester, fell into my hands, 
and among them was a specimen of Asplenium viride, ticketed " Ham Bridge, Wor- 
cestershire." This is an old stone bridge over the river Teme, near Clifton, between 
Tenbury and Knightsford Bridge.
Thinking this a curious habitat for this mountain 
fern, I took an early opportunity of examining the bridge, and did so for two or three 
successive years; but my search was vain, for the bridge had been recently repaired 
and whitewashed (horribile dictu !), and no trace of any fern or even plant could I find 
upon it.
However, in 1836, happening to go that way again, I once more paused and 
leaned over the parapet of the bridge â€” scarcely believing my eyes, two specimens of 
the Asplenium were positively there and well fruited.
One I gathered, and left the 
other as an " egg in the nest." That the fern had been almost obliterated, and its 
roots completely obscured and hindered from vegetating for some years by the villain- 
ous whitewash, appears I think very evident ; but this fact seems to suggest that where 
a fern has once established itself, it may probably be again found after the lapse of years, 
though at intermediate times of examination apparently extinct.

15.
Dispersion of Seeds.
The modes by which the seeds of plants are transported 
about, are exceedingly various and well worthy of attention : and perhaps none are 
more so than those of Syngenesious plants, most of which have a downy egret, as the 
dandelion, thistle, groundsel, &c.
I do not know a prettier sight than a dandelion- 
seed floating along beneath its feathery plume, on a gentle breeze : now erect, now 
lightly waving to one or the other side, yet still keeping its position, like the car of a 
miniature balloon ; till at length it slowly descends, and fixes itself in some crevice of 
the earth, there to be nourished, far enough from its parent flower.
Some seeds have 
attached to them a broad, thin blade (samara), as the ash, maple, &c., which forces 
them obliquely through the air, instead of perpendicularly : others are jerked to a dis- 
tance by a peculiar mechanism in the seed-vessel : others are carried to distances in the 
stomachs of birds, their vegetative power increased, rather than destroyed, by the pro- 
cess of digestion.
All show a power at work, to which the wisdom of man is foolish- 
ness.
* * One of the most curious of our forest seeds is that of the bass-wood, 
[Tilia americana, Linn.'] You may see one yonder slowly descending through the air: 
it whirls round horizontally with great rapidity, as it falls, as if on an axis or pivot.
47 
Take it up and examine it ; here is a long, ovate-lanceolate leaf (bractea), transversely 
bent in the middle : from the angle on the under side proceeds a slender stalk, at the end 
of which is fixed a round body like a pea, which looks, as it descends, as if it hung by a 
thread from the leaf-like wing : this contains the seed.
â€” Gosse^s ' Canadian Naturalist.' 
16.
Splitting of trees by the freezing of water.
Old trees, when cut down, are often 
found to have the heart-wood so separated from the sap-wood, as to fall apart when a 
log is split through the centre ; and we find that the crevice or intermediate space has 
been occupied by a film of ice.
This explains those loud reports which we heard just 
now, and which so often occur in the forest in frosty weather.
Some water has lodged 
in the tree â€” perhaps in some maggot's or woodpecker's hole â€” which freezing, rends 
the wood by its irresistible force of expansion ; into the rent so formed, the water per- 
colates as soon as a thaw comes, and freezing again, extends the crevice downwards, 
each rent attended with these sudden and startling sounds.

Arrow-poison plant.
Our path was over " hill and dale," mostly in a N.N.W.
and N.W. direction.
It became eveiy moment wilder : we had to cross several moun- 
tain-streams, which flowed in deep beds, precipitating at their banks a ferruginous mat- 
ter ; underbush became scarce ; it appeared as if Nature here delighted only in gigantic 
forms.
Our Indians thought they had mistaken the track ; but as we arrived at a 
stream which ran rapidly over the sloping ground, exhibiting granitic shelves, we ob- 
served that several paths united ; and crossing the brook our guides stopped, and point- 
ing to a ligneous twiner which wound itself snake-like from tree to tree, they called out 
" Urari," the name of the plant in the tongue of our guides.
My wish was thus real- 
ized ; and that plant which Baron de Humboldt was prevented from seeing, and which 
was one of the chief objects of Mr. Waterton's ' Wanderings,' but without success, I 
now saw before me.

Hist.' July, 1841.

Preparation of the Indian arrow-poison.
It is only the bark of the woody parts 
and its alburnum which are considered to possess the poisonous principle in the high- 
est degree.
The stem of the plant is therefore cut into pieces about three feet in length, 
off which the bark is stripped, and after having been pounded it is steeped in water, for 
which purpose a new earthen vessel is used ; here they allow it to remain for some time 
well covered, until the water is of a yellowish colour, when it is filtered through a fun- 
nel-shaped matappa lined with plantain-leaves.
Several other plants have been mean- 
while procured, and after their juice has been extracted in a similar manner, this ex- 
tract is kept ready to be added to the former, at the moment it has been concentrated 
on a slow fire to the consistency of a syrup.
The addition of that juice gives a darker 
colour to the Urari, which, from the time of its becoming concentrated, has the appear- 
ance of tar : it is now put into small calabashes, which are covered with leaves to pre 
vent the poison from coming in immediate contact with the air.
* * This is 
the unadorned account of the preparation of the Urari, and the method which is fol- 
lowed by the Macusis at and about Pirara, and the Wapisianas of the Canuku moun- 
tains where the plant grows.
There appears to be no danger whatever in the prepara- 
tion, and the vapours which are disengaged are entirely innocent ; but the circumstance 
that it requires several days to watch the pot closely on the fire and to take off the scum 
&c., before it is properly concentrated, as well as the superstitious customs with which 
the poison-maker, for his own advantage, surrounds the preparation of it, prevent the 
Indian, with his natural indolence, from making it more than once or twice a year.

Effects of the poison.
As much as I had heard of this fatal poison, I never- 
theless cannot abstain from noting the astonishment by which I was seized when I saw 
48 
it used for the first time.
We travelled over the savannahs girt by the Pacaraima 
mountains ; a deer was discovered browsing in the high grass before us.
Lieutenant 
Haining, of the 65th regiment, my faithful travelling companion, was too far behind 
with his gun for us to await his coming up, and one of the Macusi Indians took a poi- 
soned spike from his sarima and fixed it to his arrow.
Cautiously he stole upon the 
unsuspecting deer, and shot the arrow into its neck ; it made a jump in the air, fled 
with the speed of the wind over the savannahs, but it had scarcely run forty yards when 
it fell panting to the ground, and expired.
* * i jjave seen the tapir, while 
swimming across the Rupununi, so slightly wounded that the spike had just penetrated 
through the thick skin ; nevertheless it took eff'ect, and the animal expired.
Numer- 
ous are the birds of larger and smaller size which I have seen thus secured.

â€” The secretary read a botanical description of the Lodoicea Sechellanim., by M.
Bernard.
This 
production, which has long been known under the appellation of the double sea-cocoa-nut, grows only on two 
small islands of the Sechelles group, nearly under the equator.
Many centuries before the place of its gi'owth 
was known, portions of this nut had been frequently carried by the oceanic currents to the Maldive islands, 
&c.; and the most absui-d fables were current respecting its origin and virtues.
It was generally supposed to 
grow at the bottom of the sea ; and the votaries of Vishnu devoutly believed that when that deity was churn- 
ing the ocean, he broke off several of the branches from the tree, that they might float upon the surface, and 
be a specific for aU the ills that affiict mankind.
The Lodoicea attains a height of 80 or 90 feet, and is sur- 
mounted by a beautiful crown of winged and palmated leaves.
The leaves open like a fan ; they are of large 
size, often attaining a length of 20 feet with a breadth of 10 or 12.
The fruit is generally double, sometimes 
triple and even quadruple, and with its enclosing drupe attains a length of 13 inches with a circumference of 
3 feet ; and sometimes weighs from 40 to 50 lbs.
A remarkable circumstance connected with this tree, is the 
length of time necessary to mature its fruit, and the long duration of its bloom.
It bears flowers and fruits of 
all ages at one time.
It is to be regretted that this tree is not cultivated, and that a practice has prevailed of 
cutting it down in order to get at the fruit and tender leaves.
The writer of the notice, in fact, expresses his 
fears that the species will be ere long entirely lost.
The uses of the double sea-cocoa-palm are numerous.
When young the fruit is a refreshing article of 
food : when ripe it furnishes oil.
Its germ, when developed, is a sweet dish.
The hard shell is formed into 
vessels for cai-rying water, &c.
; and the whole nut is used in India as a medicine.
The wood is used for 
building purposes &c.
: its leaves for thatching, and when platted they are made into hats, baskets, fans, and 
a number of tasteful works for which the ladies of the Sechelles are celebrated.

The Marsh Club-moss appears to occur, although not abundantly, 
on most of the heaths and commons in the south of England, parti- 
cularly where turf has been pared from the surface.
In the immedi- 
ate neighbourhood of London many habitats have been recorded ; 
those given above I have had opportunities of verifying.
In the mid- 
land and northern counties it is less common; in Scotland and Wales 
it is of comparatively rare occurrence ; and in Ireland it is altogether 
unknown.
It is found on wet or turfy ground, generally preferring a 
sandy or gravelly soil : its non-appearance in Ireland appears unac- 
countable.
Our early botanists were not generally acquainted with this species.
It is described and figured by Vaillant and Dillenius, but the latter 
author has given it a branched and luxuriant appearance which I have 
never seen it assume.
Tragus and Gerarde do not mention the plant, 
and although Plukenet and Morison have been quoted as authorities, 
I much doubt the correctness of the references.
Its medical virtues 
have not been recorded.
The marsh club-moss is an insignificant and by no means striking 
plant.
In its foliage and solitary spike it more nearly resembles Ly- 
â€¢ copodium clavatum than any other British species ; but the nearly 
circular capsule and other distinguishing characters separate it widely 
from that, and indeed from all the other indigenous Lycopodia.
The roots are stout ; they do not penetrate the earth so deeply as 
those of either of the species previously described : the prostrate stem 
creeps close to the soil, and is occasionally, but rarely, branched, the 
branches still remaining prostrate; the stem appears to be of slow 
growth, and never increases in size in the same way as that of the 
species before described ; between the points where it is attached by 
the roots, the stem sometimes assumes an arched appearance.
The growth of each year, with the exception of its extreme point 
(which remains firmly rooted to the ground), dies during the succeed- 
ing winter; the dead portion for some months adhering to the soil, 
and even after decay leaving a conspicuous black line on the surface.
In the autumn each plant throws out an erect solitary spike, situated 
on a foot-stalk which usually rather exceeds the spike itself in length.
Every part of the plant is densely clothed with linear acute leaves ; 
those on the prostrate stem are invariably curved upwards ; on the 
footstalk they are rather more scattered, erect and without curvature.
The leaves or bracts on the spike differ from the others in being broad- 
er at the base, and are not unfrequently furnished with a single tooth 
51 
on each side.
The capsules are situated at the base of the bracts 
they are nearly spherical, and of a pale yellowish green colour.
In my observations on the supposed uses of Lycopodium clavatum 
a ludicrous blunder occurs.
I have surmised that Lightfoot, whose 
* Flora Scotica' was published in 1777, borrowed an idea from Wah- 
lenberg, who wrote in 1826.
The name of Mattegras is of old date, 
so that the reasoning of the passage is still sound.

â€” Observations on the Structure and Development of the 
Organs of Pilularia globulifera.
In a Letter to R.
H. Solly, Esq., 
F.R.S. and L.S. By William Valentine, Esq., F.L.S.
Mr. Valentine, already well known by his papers ' On the develop- 
ment of the Theca, and on the sexes of Mosses,'* and ' On the exis- 
tence of Stomata in Mosses,'t has in the article before us recorded 
the results of his investigations on the structure and economy of an in- 
teresting British plant, of rather unfrequent occurrence.
We do not 
strictly observe the order adopted by the author in treating on the 
various parts of the subject, but however, like him, we begin with the 
sporules.
The involucrum of Pilularia globulifera contains two kinds of bodies 
occupying distinct sacs.
The first kind are found chiefly but not exclu- 
sively in the upper part of the involucrum j they are round, not more

than the 460th of an inch (in diameter ?) and about forty in each sac : 
these bodies have been called pollen by some botanists and anthers 
by others, but the author proves Dr. Lindley's conjecture that they 
are abortive sporules, to be perfectly correct.
The second kind are of 
an oblong pyriform shape, slightly constricted in the middle, with a 
more or less plicate conical projection at one end ; these are far less 
numerous than the first kind, and occur singly in each sac ; they are 
about the 60th of an inch broad, and have the power of germinating, 
which the first kind do not appear to possess.
The author considers 
these larger bodies to be " undoubted sporules ; " each of them con- 
sists of three coats, and the interior is occupied by a grumous fluid 
and particles of matter of various sizes and mostly ovate figure.
The 
conical projection of the sporule is a prolongation of the middle coat, 
and is perforated at the apex : the inner coat is not continued into the 
cone, but on the removal of that part may be seen closing the aper- 
ture, in the form of a transparent membrane marked with three lines 
radiating from the centre, which indicate a valvular structure.
The progress of development of these sponilar bodies is minutely 
detailed, and illustrated by a number of beautifully executed figures.
" A transverse section of the involucrum, when about the size of a small pin's head, 
shows it to consist of four integuments containing a mass of very delicate, spongy, 
compressible, cellular tissue, subdivided into four ecjual triangular portions, by four 
lines radiating from the centre."â€” 488.
In the centre of each of the four triangular portions is a cavity, into 
which projects a number of nipple-like processes attached to a com- 
mon receptacle.
As the involucrum advances the cavities increase in 
size by a gradual recession of the surrounding cellular tissue, caused 
by an inherent condensation, of which the four radiating lines are the 
result ; and at maturity this condensation " is so complete, that the 
whole of the spongy tissue is condensed into four dissepiments, divid- 
ing the cavity of the involucrum into four equal loculi." The nipple- 
like processes continue to increase in size, and on examination are 
found to be hollow sacs, each containing a quantity of grumous mat- 
ter, and " about ten soft, rather opaque, pulpy bodies, which are evi- 
dently compounded of four closely connected parts, so placed on each 
other as to form a cone with a triangular base." Such of these bodies 
as occupy chiefly the upper portion of the involucrum, â€” 
" Enlarge, become pellucid, and recede from each other, but continue to be at- 
tached to each other by four stalks as long as half their diameter, which meet in one 
centre.
It is now evident that these four bodies or sporules are contained in a mother- 
cell, which most probably existed before, but on account of its close approximation 
57 
to the foui* united sporules could not be seen.
On the surface of each of these sporulcs 
are three short lines, which radiate from the insertion of the stalk." â€” 489.
After a time the mother-cell is ruptured, the sporules separate from 
each other at the centre where the stalks meet, so that each is at first 
furnished with a short tail, which soon disappears.
These sporules 
at length become perfectly opaque and white, by the gi-adual deposi- 
tion of matter on the outer surface, and then they contain a little gru- 
mous matter, having previously been quite empty.
The mother-cell 
entirely disappears, but the author is "inclined to think that a portion 
of it becomes attached to the surface of each of the sporules, of which 
there are about forty in each sac." After arriving at this stage no fur- 
ther change appears to take place.
Up to the time of their becoming pellucid and receding from each 
other, the sporules in the lower part of the involucrum are developed 
in precisely the same manner as those in the upper, but here the ana- 
logy ceases.
At this period, instead of the mother-cell being broken 
up and disappearing while the sporules remain entire, the greater 
number of the sporules themselves are ruptured and the unchanged 
mother-cell continues to envelope them.
" The shrivelled remains of the ruptured sporules continue to be attached to each 
other by their stalks, and the mother-cell remains perfect ; in short no further change 
takes place, for they may be found in this state in the same sac with the ripe spo- 
rules.
The two or three unruptured sporules which are single in each union * * 
enlarge, each struggling for the mastery, and it is not long before one prevails, the 
smaller ones rupturing and passing into the same state as those first ruptured.
The 
sole remaining sporule now enlarges rapidly, assumes a pyriform shape, and the mo- 
ther-cell gradually recedes from it by a still more rapid enlargement, except around 
the narrow extremity to which the three ruptured sporules which form the union are 
attached, where the mother-cell has contracted an adhesion.
It appears that this dila- 
tation of the mother-cell is caused by a secretion of fluid between it and the sporule, 
for if the cell be punctured the fluid will escape, and the cell return by its elasticity to 
the same dimensions as the sporule." â€” p.
490.
This stage is marked by the disappearance of the three ruptured 
sporules, which till now had remained attached to the growing one : 
the author conjectures that they may escape by an aperture in the mo- 
ther-cell, which is visible at a later period.
A deposition of opaque 
matter on the mother-cell now takes place, and forms the outer coat of 
the sporule ; and â€” 
" When the outer coat is completely formed, the mother-cell or middle coat ceases 
to enlarge, whilst the inner sac or true sporule continues its growth until it is checked 
by coming in contact with the inner surface of the mother-cell, to which, in its mature 
state, it is firmly adherent.
The sporule is at first perfectly pellucid and deficient of 
5S 
all granular contents ; it is not till after the addition of the outer coat that the gru- 
mous granular matter is secreted." â€” 491.
The germination of the sporules is minutely described by the author.
" The first external sign of germination is either the appearance of four cells pro- 
jecting through the apex of the conical projection, or a gradual swelling of that part.
* * The enlarging cellular mass then distends the conical projection, unfolding 
the plicae of that body, and at length appears externally with four of its cells project- 
ing beyond the general mass, and compressed into a quadrangular form.
* * 
Soon after the exposure of the entire germ, which is effected by the reflection of the 
valves [of the internal membrane] and conical membrane over the side of the sporule, 
where they lie quite concealed by the germ, little fibiillee or rootlets begin to shoot 
from one side.
They are simply articulated tubes, or elongated cells applied end to 
end, with frequently a bulbous extremity ; and each is produced from one of the cells 
of the germ." â€” 485.
Shortly after the appearance of these rootlets the cells of the germ 
become flatter and more intimately connected with each other ; and 
at the same time that part of the germ which closes the cavity of the 
sporule becomes hollow- and afterwards points in two places.
These 
points gradually lengthen, and on dissection each will be found to 
consist of a closed sheath, one containing the first leaf and the other a 
root : these two apparently distinct sheaths communicate with each 
other, and envelope nearly the whole of the germ.
The young leaf, 
when rather longer than the sporule, bursts through its sheath, and 
the root protrudes before it is as long as the sporule.
" After the leaf has grown to be many times the length of the sporule, or about 
two lines long, another leaf grows from the germ close to the first, to which it is in all 
respects similar ; and then a bud begins to be developed from some indefinite part of 
the germ, but like the leaves and root, from within the sheath, which is now frequent- 
ly much lacerated.
This bud is covered by a peculiar kind of jointed hairs, whose at- 
tachments are lateral, at a short distance from their bases, and which contain a few 
colourless granules.
This bud sometimes appears after the first leaf, in which case 
there is no second primordial leaf formed ; and is the rudimentary stem, the first 
growth from it being a leaf, which exhibits, although in a small degree, the first evi- 
dence of gyration, and shortly after a root, which is furnished with its own sheath.
* 
* The roots are all formed in sheaths, through the apices of which they ultimately 
burst, the sheath continuing to embrace the base of the root, whilst a distinct and far 
more delicate sheath closely embraces its point." â€” 487.
" This account of Pilularia shows that it is incorrect to say of Acrogens that * ger- 
mination takes place at no fixed point, but on any part of the surface of the spores ;' 
for it is quite certain in this instance that germination invariably takes place at a fixed 
spot, which maybe pointed out before germination has commenced.
It is at that part 
of the sporule indicated by the three radiating lines which appear to have been produ- 
ced by the pressure of the three other sporules that originally helped to constitute the 
quaternary union ; and as the spores of all the other tribes appear, according to Mohl, 
59 
to be developed in similar unions, it is most probable that similar lines indicating a 
valvular dehiscence also exist on them.
This is certainly the case in some mosses, for 
instance, in CEdipodium, and in Isoetes, Lycopodium, and Osmunda regalis; and in 
those instances where such a structure is not visible, it is probably oveing to a thicken- 
ing of the membrane, or a deposition of opaque matter on its surface, as in Pilularia.
In the mature sporules of Pilularia they can only be discovered by dissection, and in 
the abortive ones they cannot be discovered at all after the first stages of their growth ; 
whilst, again, the sporules of Jungermannia complanata exhibit similar lines after 
they have been submitted to the action of sulphuric acid.
After the protrusion of the 
germ, however, it does appear to be quite immaterial from what part of the germ the 
first leaves, root or stem shall arise.
" It is almost superfluous to point out, that these primordial leaves, if the sporules 
be considered as seeds, have no analogy, except in their use, with cotyledons, because 
true cotyledons pre-exist in the seed, whereas these are the product of germination.
But according to the view of the nature of sporules which I have endeavoured to es- 
tablish, Pilularia must be considered as nearly allied to monocotyledons in its germi- 
nation.
* * I shall conclude these observations by stating that I have not 
been able to detect any organs which, as in the mosses, can by any possibility be sup- 
posed to perform the office of impregnating the sporules." â€” 492.

â€” Supplementary Observations on the Development of the 
Theca, and on the Sexes of Mosses.
In a Letter to R.
H. Solly, 
Esq., F.R.S. and L.S. By William Valentine, Esq., F.L.S.
The author commences his letter by observing that subsequent ex- 
amination of mosses leads him to concur in Mohl's views with regard 
to the fourfold development of sporules in a mother-cell, a fact of 
which he had expressed some doubt in a note appended to his paper 
' On the development of the Theca, and on the Sexes of Mosses,' in 
' Trans.
Lin. Soc' xvii.
481.
He says he now feels himself "bound 
to confirm the accuracy of Mohl's observation in this respect : " and 
then proceeds to give a detailed account of the structure of the theca, 
and of the development and tetrahedral union of the sporules, as ob- 
served by himself in CEdipodium GriflB.thianum, a moss found plenti- 
fully on Snowdon, and examined in a recent state.
From these observations it appears that like those of Pilularia, the 
four sporules of CEdipodium are piled on each other in the mother- 
cell, " so as to form a cone with a triangular base ; " like them, also, 
the four are connected with each other, when young, by a " very mi- 
nute stalk, situated at the junction of three radiating lines." The 
author has " observed several instances in which the mother-cell con- 
tained but one sporule, which was in all the cases round, and did not 
exhibit any signs of a stalk, or of radiating lines on its surface." 
The following observations on the analogy subsisting between the- 
cae and anthers, and on that between sporules and pollen, which the 
60 
author evidently considers to be essentially identical, are exceedingly 
interesting.
" In the first place, tte sporules are formed in thecae which have a great resem- 
blance to some anthers.
They are in most instances surrounded by a perichaetium, 
which is a collection of modified leaves analogous to the perianth.
They are either 
sessile, or seated on a stalk or seta, which may be named the filament.
In Sphagnum 
the theca is elevated on a pedicel or leafless prolongation of the axis, of which peculi- 
arity the anther of Euphorbia is a parallel instance.
The thecae are one-celled, yet 
they have a columella, which may be likened to the connectivum ; and although the 
connectivum usually divides the anther into two cells, Callitriche is an instance in 
which there is but one cell ; and there are examples in which the cavity is spuriously 
divided into four cells, as in Tetratheca, which in this respect resembles the theca of 
Polytrichum ; and in the fact of evacuating its contents by a single pore, resembles 
the general structure of thecse.
All thecae are lined by a distinct membrane, and so 
nearly does this resemble the endothecium of an anther, that in Jungennannia multi- 
fida its tissue is fibrous.
The remarkable manner of the development of sporules and 
pollen is a most convincing analogy ; they are developed in unions of fours in the ca- 
vities of simple cellules ; in fact, they are secretions in the cellules which occupy the 
interior of the theca or anther, and are the only instances on record within my know- 
ledge, of organized secretions in the cavities of simple cellules.
Although the tetra- 
hedral union of both sporules and pollen is almost always dissolved at an early period, 
yet in some instances, as in (Edipodium and Erica Tetralix, it remains at maturity.
Again, neither sporules nor pollen ever have the slightest apparent organic connexion 
with the parent plant, â€” a most remarkable coincidence, and a fact which has never 
been insisted on as a distinguishing character between sporules and seeds." â€” 502.
The effects produced by the application of sulphuric acid to the 
sporules are next described ; " the same phenomena occur as when it 
is applied to pollen." The author in a foot-note recommends this acid 
as " a valuable agent in the analysis of the peristomes of mosses," and 
thus concludes his valuable letter : â€” 
*' Lastly, to complete the analogy, the sporules of mosses and of some other tribes 
commence their germination by the emission of the internal lining membrane in the 
form of a tube, which is exactly analogous to the pollen-tubes.
In the mosses these 
tubes increase by the addition of a series of fiesh tubes at their extremities, and at 
length a bud containing the rudiments of stem, leaves and roots is formed, which may 
be considered analogous to the embryo or young bud in the seed of the more highly 
organized plants." â€” 506.
The beautifully engraved illustrations which accompany the paper, 
comprise figures of GEdipodium Griffithianum, both of the natural size 
and magnified, and highly magnified views of the sporules in various 
stages of development, of the theca, and other parts of that moss ; 
and also figures exhibiting the effects of sulphuric acid on the spo- 
rules of Gymnostomum truncatulum, Orthotrichum striatum, and Jun- 
gennannia complanata.

Cnieus Forsteri I saw growing by hundreds last month in a piece of marshy 
ground fonnerly part of Ditton Common ; at least it was the plant I previously found 
near Weybridge and sent to Sir W.
Hooker.
It was growing with various numbers 
of flowers from one up to four, each on a separate and generally a long stalk.
On com- 
paring it with the books both English and foreign, and especially with Decandolle's 
description of his Cirsium anglicum (our Cnieus pratensis), I have little doubt that it 
is merely a variety of that, and that C.
Forsteri, as you suggested, has no existence as 
a species.

Note on British Lycopodia.
From what I read in " The Phytologist " I am 
led to infer that any notice of fresh localities of our British Lycopodia, (especially in 
the Midland Counties, where these plants are comparatively rare), may not be entirely 
without interest.
Three out of our six native species I have formerly found on Coles- 
hill Heath (especially near Coleshill Pool), Warwickshire; viz.
Lycopodium Selago, 
clavatiim and inundatum ; â€” all however, seem now to have disappeared ; at least no 
one of the three have I been able to meet with at the above station for some years 
past.
Many years ago, when quite a boy, and in company with my father, I remem- 
ber to have seen a single plant of Lye. Selago growing in the bog below the pool.
This was the only specimen I ever saw, or heard of being found, in the neighbourhood ; 
and as we gathered it, thinking it a prize, I suppose we put a finishing stroke to 
its existence in that situation.
Lye. clavatum was met with in some abundance.
People knowing nothing of Botany were struck with the beauty of the plant, and used 
to gather long strings of it, hanging them in festoons round their looking-glasses and 
picture-frames, to adorn their rooms.
I have failed to meet with the plant in its old 
quarters for some years, and I attribute its non-appearance to the growth of young 
plantations, the trees of which have overshadowed the ground, and in great measure 
destroyed the vegetation beneath.
For the non-appearance now-a-days of Lye. inun- 
datum I am at a loss to account, because the parts where it grew (the shores of Coles- 
hill pool), remain much in the same state as formerly, and would seem to be peculiarly 
suitable to the growth of the plant, being always moist, and occasionally overflowed.
But after repeated searches in the very spots where it used to grow plentifully, I have 
for some years past failed to find it.
A like fate, I may add, ( though the fact has 
nothing to do with Botany), seems to have befallen the beautiful little Polyommatus 
Argus in the above district.
We used to take it in great abundance : indeed, as a 
boy, I was more familiar with this species than with the common Pol. Alexis; but 
now we cannot find a single specimen.
True it is Coleshill Heath has been greatly 
curtailed byinclosures and cultivation since the days I have alluded to ; still however, 
considerable tracts yet remain in statu quo : the dryer parts purpled over with the 
three common kinds of heath, the bogs a sheet of gold in their season with the blos- 
soms of Narthecium, and abounding with Oxycoccus, Coraarum, Eriophorum, Me- 
nyanthes, &c., &c., but no Polyommatus Argus, no Lycopodium inundatum, so far as 
recent researches can discover.

New British Narciss^ls P I have now for some years cultivated in the garden a 
very handsome daff"odil, which was found wild by a friend of mine, near Tenby in 
Pembrokeshire, and is quite distinct from any other British Narcissus that I am ac- 
quainted with.
The late Mr. Haworth, to whom I sent it in 1830, considered it new 
* lu a letter to E.

to Britain, and recorded it in the ' Philosophical Magazine ' under the name of Ajax 
lobularis.
It is a highly ornameutal species, a free flowerer, and increases readily.
I think it may fairly he considered a native plant, ( unless, indeed, it should he held 
to have been introduced by the Romans ), for it is not likely that it should have been 
the outcast of a garden, being, as I believe, so little, if at all, known in the gardens, 
till of late years distributed by me among various private friends and public institu- 
tions, to all of whom it appears to have been previously unknown.
The plant comes 
true from seed ; the seedlings which I have raised differing very slightly, if at all, 
from the parent.

Lilium Martagon.
This plant occurs in tolerable plenty near the village of 
Sampford, in this county [Essex], on the road from Great Bardfield to Walden.
This 
locality was pointed out to me last May, by my relative Mr. R.
M. Smith of Great 
Bardfield, who has known of it for above twenty years.
The spot is a high bank, 
sprinkled with low bushes, on the side of a lane leading from the village eastward to 
some unexplored part of the county.
From the situation I cannot at all suppose that 
the plant can be an escape from any garden.
When I visited the spot there were a 
considerable number of plants, chiefly growing on the outsides of the clumps of bushes, 
but sometimes quite out in the grass.
I do not see any mention of this locality in Ray's 
list of the rare plants of Essex, in Camden's Britannia, edit.

Lilium Martagon.
I think I never shall forget the extreme pleasure I expe- 
rienced when, in 1826, 1 first saw this beautiful plant growing in a little coppice to the 
right of the lane leading from Mickleham to Headley, in Surrey.
The coppice was 
overshadowed by oak trees of considerable size, and the underwood had been cut dur- 
ing the previous year, so that the tall racemes of the lily stood up nobly and conspicu- 
ously above the brushwood, and it would have been difficult for any passing observer 
not to have noticed them.
â€” Edward Newman ; August 13, 1841.
[At the end of June, 1840, in a delightful excursion which we believe some of the 
party will not soon forget, we had the gratification of seeing Lilium Martagon grow- 
ing in the greatest profusion in the station last mentioned.
In some parts of the cop- 
pice the plants were so crowded that the flowers produced a perfect blaze of the richest 
colour among the young trees.

Note on British Orchidacece.
From the commencement of the Birmingham 
Garden we have cultivated, with tolerable success, such of the British Orchidaceae as 
we could obtain, and have preserved some species for several years without being obli- 
ged to procure a fresh supply from their native places of growth.
They are grown in 
pots placed with our alpine plants ; and about six years ago I was agreeably surprised 
at seeing some self-sown seedlings in several of the pots with the alpine plants, some of 
them being very small, and evidently seedlings of that year, others were much stronger.
Of plants so obtained we have flowered several fine specimens every season for the last 
three years ; some of them were permitted to flower where they came up, others were 
transplanted singly into pots, and all flowered equally well.
They mostly are to be 
found with such alpine plants as have leaves covering the pots in winter in a living 
state, so as to ward off a portion of the rain, or in pots where the plants have a mass of 
roots to answer the same purpose, by absorption of the superabundant moisture.
The 
species which have flowered from self-sown plants are Gymnadenia conopsea, Orchis 
maculata and O.
latifolia, â€” the latter species being most abundant.
As far as I can 
ascertain they flower the third year after their appearance in a seedling state.

Lycopodium clavatum grows freely with us iu a peat bed in a shaded situation, 
and appears as manageable as many other plants.
Those who intend to cultivate it 
should, upon obtaining plants from their native habitat on the moors, put them into 
light sandy peat, and place the pots in a shaded situation until well rooted, when they 
may be turned out, with the balls entire, into a favourable situation, where they will 
require little further care or attention, except putting a little peat over some of the 
running stems to encourage them to make fresh roots.

Lycopodmm Selayo may also be grown in the same way as Lye. clavatum, but 
does better in pots kept in a cool frame, or under a hand-glass, during the winter at 
least; it is also a plant well adapted for growing in the house, in a glass jar or glass 
case.
Slugs are very fond of this species, and when once they commence will soon de- 
vour the whole plant if not sought out and destroyed.

Dianthus plumarius and Dia. Cai-yophylhis.
The Dianthus plumarius from 
Ludlow Castle and D.
Caryophyllus from Rochester Castle, cultivated together, be- 
sides the very satisfactory specific distinction presented by the different division of the 
petals and the serratures on the margins of the leaves, &c., have a different period for 
flowering ; the flowers of D.
plumarius appearing in June, while D.
Caryophyllus 
only commences flowering at the latter end of July, and is now, in the middle of Au- 
gust, in perfection ; the first corresponds iu time of flowering with the garden pink, 
while the latter agrees with that of the carnation.

Cibotium Baromez, J.
Smith.
This interesting fern, which produced one fer- 
tile frond in the autumn of 1839, and of which a description by Mr. Westcott was read 
before the Linnean Society, February 18, 1840, has one fertile frond upon it this sea- 
son.
By some means or other a mistake has crept into the report of Mr. Westcott's 
description of this fern in the ' Proceedings of the Linnean Society,' Feb. 18, 1840, 
which perhaps had better be corrected.
The passage I allude to is the following.
â€” 
" Mr. Westcott is however in possession of a specimen of a fern collected in Mexico 
by Mr. Ross, which closely resembles the plant of the gardens, and should they prove 
to be identical, all doubt will be removed as to the claims of the present plant to be 
regarded as the Baromez of Linnaeus, which is a native of China." The true state of 
the case is this.
For want of a work containing the description of Cibotium, Mr.
Westcott thought that in our fern he had detected a new genus ; and he also found, 
among a lot of dried ferns from Mexico, a mutilated frond of a fern which would 
belong to the same genus, (this has since been tolerably well ascertained to be Cibo- 
tium Scheidei, Chamisso) ; and it was the genus he meant that had a wide range, ex- 
tending from China to Mexico, but not the species, C.
Baromez.
Whether our plant 
really be the Baromez of Linnaeus cannot be cleared up, as we are unable to trace out 
its native country ; we however never had any reason for supposing it to be from Ame- 
rica.

Impatiens fulva.
From what I have heard of the circumstances under which 
Impatiens fulva occurs in the localities given in the last No. of the Phytologist (p.
40), 
I should hardly consider it entitled to a place in the British Flora.
I have not 
visited the spot myself, but I learn from my friend Mr. Jenner, who is pretty well ac- 
quainted with the neighbourhood, that the plant is scarcely to be found on the banks 
of the stream above Albury.
It is cultivated in the Albury gardens, whence the seeds 
are most probably carried down by the stream and deposited on its banks, where they 
vegetate, and the plant soon becomes established, its range being extended still 
lower in the same manner : it even occurs on the banks of the Thames, below the con- 
64 
fluence of the Wey. This Impatiens is also cultivated in Mr. Goulbuvn's gardens at 
Betcliworth ; and about a fortnight ago Mr. Henness and myself found plants of it 
growing on the banks of the Mole near Brockham, (below the gardens).
I have no 
doubt that in a few years it will be carried down to Burford Bridge, and perhaps far- 
ther, and establish itself on the banks of the Mole as it has on the banks of the Wey 
near Albury.

Additional Guildford Stations.
Since the publication of the list of Guildford 
plants in the last number of ' The Phytologist,' Fumaria claviculata has been refound 
in its old locality, Martha's Chapel, and likewise on the extensive common near Shal- 
ford, called Blackheath.
Epipactis latifolia has been found at the Sheepleas, and 
Cuscuta Europsea in an osier holt by the river Wey, a short distance above Guildford, 
entwined round nettles, the Spirsea Ulmaria, and the osiers themselves.

Seeds of Aponogeton.
I write for the purpose of describing to you a rather 
singular phenomenon which I observed yesterday while committing to the water some 
seeds of the Aponogeton distachyon, and which you will probably have it in your 
power to notice.
On their touching the surface, some of the seeds instantly began to 
move in starts and whirls, and had every appearance of living insects.
On close ob- 
servation I found that a considerable force (how produced is a mystery) was exerted 
to throw off what remained, after I had rubbed them, of the pithy matter from the 
pod which still adhered to them.
As soon as they had rid themselves of this they 
sank.
This is one of the most curious things I have ever seen.

Various donations to the Libraiy, Herbarium and Museum,

The Rev. George Munford exhibited specimens of Asjndium cristatum,, collected by him

Dr. John Lhotsky presented some interesting specimens of Aus-

The following Papers were read : â€” " On the Botany of Western Norfolk," by The Rev. G.
Munford.
The geography of plants is of much interest to the botanist, and every attempt to promote the 
knowledge of this branch of the science is worthy of observation.
It is now universally admitted that the 
geological character of every district exercises very great influence over its vegetation.
By a reference to 
Woodward's Geological Map of Noi-folk, published in 1833, it will be seen that proceeding eastwai-d from 
Lynn, which is situated on the alluvium, we meet vrith a narrow strip of the Kimmeridge clay and oolite 
that runs in a direction north and south nearly the entire length of the district.
This is followed by a much 
wider portion of the fiai-stone, running in the same direction ; and parallel with this lies about the same 
quantity of chalk maile.
The indentation of the eastern side of the district extends into the hard and me- 
dial chalk, but embraces only a small portion of the latter, towards the north.
The Paper concluded with a 
very copious list of habitats.

A. 
Johns, F.L.S. The author concludes that the plant is not itself phosphorescent, and that whatever light was 
reflected came not from the globular cells of the plant, but from the globules of fluid resting upon it.
A si- 
milar fact was also observed in two species of Jungcrmannia.
It appears however to be confined to those 
Cryptogamic plants with reticulated leaves.
Mr. S.
P. Woodward exhibited two rhizomas of Aspidium Fi- 
lix-mas; one showing the spiral arrangement of the rachides, and on the other (and on the little pieces ac- 
companying it) buds were developed.
Near the bases of some of the rachides which appear in some instances, 
Mr. W.
had seen to produce fronds yearly, tUl they became rhizomas in their turn, an inch or two long.
This mode of development is common in Foreign genera, but Mr. W.
was not aware of its having been men- 
tioned as occurring in any of the British ferns.

This species, which, without much reason, has obtained the name 
of the Prickly Club-Moss, is widely distributed over the hilly districts 
of the North of England, Wales, Scotland and Ireland.
I have found 
it in every part of the Snowdon range that 1 have visited ; also on Ca- 
der Idris, in the Western Highlands of Scotland, and on Errigal and 
other elevations in the County Donegal : and my correspondents have 
kindly supplied me with such a host of habitats, that I am compelled 
to limit the number given, on account of the space which the whole 
would occupy.
It delights in the vicinity of those little rills so com- 
mon in all our hilly counties, and whose course is so often marked by 
a sinuous line of vivid green, delighting the heart of the botanist, and 
leading him on from crag to crag, regardless of the crumbling debris 
and detached masses of stone w^hich in such spots too often give way 
beneath his tread, and leap with awful bounds down the hill-side, till 
they find a new resting-place in the abyss below.
On such localities 
has this interesting little plant fixed for its home, and here it may ever 
be found, the companion of saxifrages and the rarer ferns.
Lycopodium Selaginoides was well known to Ray, who considered 
it generically distinct from all the other British Lycopodia,* in which 
Dillenius appears to agree with him.f The figure % by Dillenius is 
not inaccurate, but wants that elegance which is so characteristic of 
the majority of his figures : the other figures of our earlier botanists 
convey little or no idea of the characters of the plant.
The roots are extremely slender, thread-like and fragile ; they take 
but a slight hold on the crumbling soil in which this species is usu- 
ally found.
The stem is procumbent, very slender, weak, repeatedly branched, 
the branches short and somewhat sinuous : the seed-beaiing spikes 
are thrown up at intervals, generally two or three on each plant ; they 
are subclavate and considerably thicker than the prostrate stem.
The entire plant is clothed with lanceolate leaves, which are ser- 
rated and almost jagged at their edges; those on the procumbent 
slender portions of the stem are shorter, narrower and somewhat scat- 
tered, while those on the spike, more properly termed bracts, are every 
way larger and much broader at the base.
The thecse are sessile at the base of the bracts, pale yellow and to- 
lerably roxmd ; the upper ones contain the usual minute pollen-like 
particles which have already been spoken of as the seeds of Lycopo- 
dium clavatum, used under the name of 'plaun ' for the production

of flashes of light; the lower ones contain larger grains, equal in size 
to the seed of many phaenogamous plants.
This double mode of fruc- 
tification has excited the admiration of botanists from the earliest pe- 
riod, and given rise to a variety of conjectures ; some have contended 
that both the large and small grains are productive seeds, others that 
the smaller bodies are true seeds, the large ones gemmae or buds ; 
others that the smaller are abortive and the larger productive seeds ; 
and others again that the larger ones only are seed, the smaller ones 
being grains of pollen.
Wahlenberg* has given a very clear and accurate description of this 
twofold fructification.
He observes that the capsules containing the 
granifonn seeds are subquadrilocular, in reality bivalve, but sometimes 
dehiscing in four directions ; they occupy the lower portion of the 
spike, and are larger and more protuberant than those above.
The 
seeds are always four in number, and are so squeezed and pressed to- 
gether that three triangular areas are produced at the base of each ; in 
this particular they so much resemble the seeds of Isoetes lacustris, 
that, agreeing as the plants do in so many other respects, it is hardly 
possible to doubt their being closely related.
The seeds are nearly 
as large as those of the poppy, and invariably fall from the capsule en- 
tire and are scattered upon the earth, a circumstance quite conclusive 
against their being anthers, as suggested by Hedwig.
Capsules filled 
with the powdery seed common to the other Lycopodia and the bi- 
valved ferns, occur in the axils of the upper bracts ; this powder con- 
sists of somewhat hirsute granules, four of which are combined in a 
tetrahedron, exactly like the seeds in the lower capsules, exhibiting a 
very obvious analogy between the two kinds of seed, and leaving no 
doubt of their having the same origin.
If therefore the powder emit- 
ted from the capsules of Botrychium Lunaria be true seed, it follows 
that the powder produced by the capsules of Lycopodium Selaginoi- 
des is seed also.
It cannot be male pollen, its appearance being pre- 
cisely synchronous with that of the mature seeds.
The spike itself is 
annual, decaying immediately after it has fruited in July or the begin- 
ning of August, and the next year a new spike springs from some other 
part of the prostrate stem, on no part of which can a trace of future 
capsules be found.
From these circumstances it seems probable that 
the only difference between the granules is that of size, each being to 
be regarded as true seed ; a somewhat analogous discrepancy occurs 
in the varied form of the seeds of spinach.

â€” Notice of a Plant ivhich produces perfect Seeds without 
any apparent Action of Pollen.
By Mr. John Smith, A.L.S.
This curious and interesting member of the Euphorbiaceae, to which 
Mr. Smith has assigned the name of Coelehogyne ilicifolia, is a native 
of Moreton Bay, on the east coast of New Holland, whence three plants 
were sent to the Royal Botanic Garden at Kew, in 1829, by Mr. Allan 
Cunningham, who was unable to determine the natural order to which 
it belonged, not having seen either flowers or fruit.
Mr. Brown also 
" collected specimens of this plant, but equally without fructification, 
at Keppel Bay, on the same coast, in 1802." Under cultivation the 
plants retain their scrubby habit, and have much the appearance of 
dwarf holly -bushes.
" Shortly after their introduction the plants produced female flowers, an examina- 
tion of which proved the genus to he Euphorhiaceous, and allied to Sapium : hut al- 
though I have watched them carefully from year to year, I have heen unsuccessful in 
detecting anything like male flowers or pollen heaving organs; and T should naturally 
have passed them over as dioecious, and considered the three introduced individuals 
as females, had not my attention heen particularly directed to them in consequence of 
each of them producing fruit and perfect seeds, from which I succeeded in raising 
young plants.
This, too, was not the result of one year, but of several successive 
years' sowing : the plant now exhibited to the Society was raised last year, and the si- 
milarity of the offspring to the parent would alone lead me to conclude that it is not 
the result of cross-fecundation.
The circumstances connected with the situation of 
the plant in the garden, and the absence of allied male plants, as also the peculiarity 
of the natural order to which it belongs, which do not readily hybridize, led me to be- 
lieve that no foreign pollen had fecundated the ovarium ; and on watching the progress 
of the stigma all doubts were removed.
* * I have already said that the 
stigma consists of three connate lobes, which are more or less notched ; at first the 
lobes are depressed on the ovarium, but as the ovarium swells they lose their reddish 
colour and become inclined upwards, retaining their succulent and healthy appear- 
ance till dried up by the ripening of the fruit : the surface has a granular appearance, 
derived from minute papillae, and showing no signs of having been acted on by pol- 
len.
Spiral vessels occur in the thick part of the base of the stigma, and are doubt- 
less connected with the vascular tissue of the ovarium.
I have seen nothing like pol- 
len-tubes.
The stigmatic surface remaining so long unchanged aS'ords a strong proof 
of its not having been acted upon by pollen, it being well known that the stigma of 
many plants remains for a long time unaltered, but soon after the application of pol- 
len a change takes place, as is readily seen in Orchideae.
" On considering the circumstances above noticed, and in particular the absence of 
72 
male flowers of the plant itself or of others related to it, and the fact of the stigma 
remaining so long unchanged, and not exhibiting the symptoms usually seen in stig- 
mas after having been acted upon by pollen, I can arrive, â€” especially after the length 
of time during which I have watched it, â€” at no other conclusion than that pollen is 
not essential to the perfecting its seeds ; but if an external agent be necessary, and 
really act upon the stigma, I am unable to say what that agent is or how it acts.
I 
might mention a view which I at one time entertained, namely, that the viscid fluid 
which issues from the glands situated below the ovarium might produce some efi"ect 
by exciting the action of the pistillum ; and this view received some support from find- 
ing the ydung stigma often smeared with the fluid.
That there is some specific action 
on the ovula I think there can be no doubt ; for, as in most other plants, some of the 
ovula are frequently abortive.
" My object being merely to state the facts observed respecting this plant, without 
the intention of advancing any opinion on the various theories of vegetable impregna- 
tion, I shall conclude by merely observing, that the absence of pollen in this instance 
is irreconcil cable with the theory that every grain of pollen furnishes a germ, and that 
the ovulum is merely a matrix to receive and nourish it till it becomes a perfect seed."

Parts 2 and 3.
Au- 
gust and September, 1841.
The second part of this elegant work contains portraits and descrip- 
tions of four trees ; â€” the wild cherry, the whitethorn, the mountain 
ash and the common ash.
Mr. Selby considers the cherry well worth 
cultivating as an ornamental tree, principally on account of the pro- 
fusion of its flowers at an early period of the year, and the rich purple 
tints of its foliage in the autumn.
The whitethorn, or quickset as we 
term it, is more apt to be regarded as the staple commodity of our trim 
English hedges than as a forest tree ; still, Mr. Selby has selected so 
noble a specimen as an illustration of the species, that it reminds us 
of a figure we have somewhere seen of the gigantic * chestnut of a hun- 
dred horse ' long celebrated by travellers.
The rowan, that familiar 
tree, is represented more in accordance with our ideas of its magni- 
tude.
" The mountain ash grows in almost every district of Britain, but its favourite ha- 
bitats and where it reaches its greatest size and most imposing appearance, are moun- 
tainous declivities, or in those deep dells in mountainous and hilly districts, where 
the earth is loose and free, and kept in that moist state most congenial to its growth, 
by the percolation of the rain and dews, or of springs which issue from the disruptured 
rocks.
In such localities it frequently becomes a tree of the second or third magni- 
73 
tude, with a form generally devoid of that stiffness and round-topped outline it usu- 
ally assumes under cultivation, or as seen in dressed and garden grounds.
In old 
trees situated in such wild scenery, the branches lose their formal appearance, and as 
they become elongated and unable to sustain the annually increasing weight of the 
foliage, gradually yield and take a partially pendant direction.
Such are many of 
those groups which claimed the approving notice of Gilpin, and which we have oft ad- 
mired in the wild and enchanting scenery of the Scottish Highlands ; and such were 
the old and venerable trees in our own romantic dene at Twizell, before the destruc- 
tive storms of the last few winters overthrew and laid low the leafy honours of the 
largest and finest among them.
In addition to a light and graceful foliage, chaiming 
us with its fresh and lively tint, the mountain ash, in spring, bears conspicuous and 
sweet-smelling corymbs of cream-white flowers, and as the autumn advances, its ber- 
ries, of the richest coral hue, give it a singularly pleasing and beautiful effect ; â€” 
" How clung the Rowan to the rock 
And through the foliage showed his head 
With narrow leaves and benies red ; â€” " 
and add to the contrast produced by its mixture with the deep green of the pine, and 
the tufted and waving foliage of the spiry birch, two of the usual and most predomi- 
nating trees in those localities in which it most delights.
It is not, however, to be 
despised, or its cultivation neglected, in scenery of a tamer and less stirring descrip- 
tion, and, loaded with its rich and glowing fruit, it is one of the greatest ornaments to 
the pleasure gardens of suburban villas." p.
77.
The third part contains the English elm, the cork-barked elm, the 
wych elm, the smooth-leaved wych elm, and the common walnut.
A 
figure of some noble specimen of each tree accompanies the descrip- 
tion, which is always very complete, giving the history, appearance, 
mode of culture, uses, and every other particular that can interest the 
enquirer.
The work abounds in useful hints to planters, and practical observa- 
tions on the effect produced by the propinquity of other trees.
Of the 
ash the author observes it is best planted without admixture of other 
trees, as from its mode of gi'owth it proves one of the worst of neigh- 
bours in mixed plantations, particularly to the oak, which it lashes 
and destroys by its heavy and easily swayed head.
On the other hand 
the cherry is strongly recommended to the planter's notice, both on 
account of its value for underwood and as a timber tree, and particu- 
larly as being â€” 
" one of the few trees that can be advantageously planted as a nurse or subsidiary 
to the oak, as it is neither apt to ovftrtop or crush its neighbours by a rampant growth 
or wide spreading head like the wych elm or the ash, or to hurt and injure them in 
winds and stonns, as is constantly the case where trees with a more flexible or easily 
agitated spray are introduced.
It has also this further recommendation as a nurse to 
the oak, that, although a quick growing plant while young, and fulfilling the duty of 
a protector, it naturally yields to the tree it has fostered after the first twenty or thirty 
years of its growth, and is afterwards content to vegetate beneath its shade, rendering 
74 
it even as a mere neighbour the least dangerous to oaks in cases of neglect, or where 
regular thinning has not been duly administered." â€” p.
61.
We are gratified in observing that tlie words " Indigenous and In- 
troduced" have been inserted in the title on the wrappers of the parts 
before us, in accordance with a suggestion in our notice of the first 
part of this work.

â€” Varieties.

Polypodium calcareum and Dryopteris.
I consider these plants to be quite dis- 
tinct, the former having truly the erect habit which Smith describes ; I believe also 
that the pubescence is constantly present in P.
calcareum.
The two species are gene- 
rally found in different habitats, but in a wood on the side of Ingleborough, as you go 
to Weathercote, they are found in company.
I have cultivated them side by side for 
many years, with their respective characters unchanged.

Woodsia Ilvensis and hyperhorea.
I have never had the slightest difficulty in 
distinguishing these plants, the first by its ovate, the second by its oblong pinnae.
Woodsia Ilvensis was found by me many years ago near Llyn y Cwn, and by no one 
else in modern times, but those whom I have directed to the spot.
I believe however 
it is the " Filix Alpina, Pedicularis rubras foliis subtus villosis" of Ray (Syn. 118), 
although I must confess I have only seen Woodsia hyperborea on Clogwyn y Garnedd, 
the habitat recorded by Ray. â€” Id. July 5, 1841.
In a short visit to the Snowdon dis- 
trict last month, I found a few plants of W.
Ilvensis in the old locality, but they ap- 
peared weak and dwindling for want of sufficient earth.

Botanical Excursion to Teesdale.
Having arrived at Middleton, in Teesdale, 
Durham, a little before 12 o'clock on the 21st of August, 1838, after taking some re- 
freshment I set off for Langdon beck, cheered by sun-gleams, which had suddenly 
succeeded heavy clouds and rain.
I reached my destination^t 2, and secured, as a 
guide, the landlord of the unpretending little public-house, on whose pony we crossed 
the deeply swollen beck, our first obstacle in progressing to Widdy-bank and Caldron 
Snout, (incorrectly given Spout by Francis and Hooker).
And here allow me to hint 
to botanists who may visit this place, in search of plants the locality of which is sim- 
ply given as Widdy-bank, to take a guide as they desire success in their search, since 
Widdy-bank is a tract of country extending about 'three miles square, and thus a very 
indistinct description for the locality of a small plant.
We had not proceeded far when 
we found Bartsia alpina in great abundance, principally either young plants or in seed; 
I was however fortunate enough to secure three in flower.
A little farther on, and 
extending over a large space, was Tofieldia palustris in seed.
We then saw many 
plants of Gentiana verna, not far from the side of the river; and, mounting higher 
ground, discovered one tuft of Carex pulicaris.
The remainder of our way, until we 
reached the Snout, was unproductive.
There, growing out of the crevices of the rock 
on the Durham side, were Festuca vivipara and Polypodium Phegopteris in great lux- 
uriance.
We crossed the stream by its narrow bridge, into the county of Westmore- 
land, but dared not extend our ramble, in consequence of the threatening aspect of 
* In a letter to E.
Newman.
75 
newly accumulated clouds, so that T considered myself amply rewarded by finding 
Cnicus heterophyllus, Habenaria viridis and Gentiana campestris.
Recrossing tlie 
bridge we pursued the course of the stream, which, almost immediately below the 
Snout, takes a sudden turn, and thus we found our track hemmed in by the over-laden 
Tees on our right hand, and the lofty basaltic rocks called Falcon Glints on our left.
My eye was now anxiously directed to the face of these rocks, to discover, if possible, 
the chief object in taking our present course â€” Woodsia Ilvensis.
Rain now began 
to fall heavily, and the wind, which had been all day very tempestuous, bore it against 
us so as to render observation, either of locality or objects, very imperfect.
However, 
after tracing as near as I can judge about 400 yards, I espied some small specks of 
green through the broken fragments of a stream which poured over the Glints, and 
under which I soon stood, pulling hastily the patches I had seen, and these, to my 
delight, proved to be two small plants of the Woodsia, mixed with a few fronds of 
Asplenium viride and Cistopteris fragilis.
The state of the weather, for by this time 
the rain had penetrated a Mackintosh cape, rendered all further search impracticable ; 
we therefore retraced our path as quickly as possible to our starting-point, having 
picked up as we proceeded Sedum villosum, Lycopodium Selago and Selaginoides, 
Galium boreale and Solidago Virgaurea, all of which were growing in great profusion.
On the following day I went in the opposite direction, into Baldersdale, to gather Sax- 
ifraga Hirculus ; and here again I provided myself with a guide, a requisite in search 
of a plant which is confined in its growth to a very limited area.
It gi'ows on the sur- 
face of a very lofty and exposed hill to the south of the Balder, at the exact point of 
its junction with the Black beck.
The storm of wind and rain was violent as yester- 
day, and I was once more completely "wetted to skin," even through another Mackin- 
tosh cape : but I do not complain ; I found the plant in great plenty and luxuriance, 
growing among moss, and where I had to stand at least six inches deep in water whilst 
I gathered it.
The storm again prevented further search, or any advance lower down 
the beck for the purpose of gathering Epilobium angustifolium, which grows there.
Yet let it not be supposed that the wettings were not counterbalanced, when Woodsia 
Ilvensis and Saxifraga Hirculus were in the scale against them.

Avena alpina found in Yorkshire.
Whilst on a visit to a friend near Settle a 
fortnight since, Mr. J.
Tatham took me to a hill above that town to gather Avena 
alpina, which had been discovered there for the first time a few weeks previously, by 
himself; and in the evening of the same day I discovered it in a hazel wood, a little 
northward of Stackhouse near Settle, in great abundance.
I mention this, thinking it 
may be interesting to know that this almost exclusively Scottish plant has a habitat in 
Yorkshire.
I believe it was not known to Mr. Baines as having been found in that 
county.

38.
Asplenium lanceolatum.
It affords me pleasure to be able to communicate 
what I am sure will be interesting to you, viz., a locality for the rare Asplenium lan- 
ceolatum, not mentioned in Mr. Newman's delightful little work on the ferns.
Mr. J.
W. Ewing, of Norwich, who resided here for some time a few years ago, discovered the 
plant growing on a bank at Stapleton, about three miles from Bristol, and pointed out 
the spot to me.
Not paying much attention to the ferns at that time, the circumstance 
escaped from my memory, until reminded of it by a friend who was with us at the 
time.
I have recently revisited the spot and again found the plant, but growing there 
very sparingly ; however, by searching very diligently, day after day, the rocks in the 
76 
immediate neighbourliood, I discovered it in one or two other places, and in one of 
tliese abundantly, covering the dry surface of a rock completely sheltered from rain, 
and, though its roots are almost exposed and a slight pull detaches it from the rock, 
it gi'ows in the greatest luxuriance, one frond which I gathered measuring eighteen 
inches in length.
I have observed in all the fronds of this fern which I have gather- 
ed, that the rachis is throughout its entire length furnished with linear scales, a cha- 
racter which best distinguishes it in all its forms, and even in its very young state, 
from Asplenium Adiantum-nigrum.

Anagallis arvensis and cmndea.
I have this season been able to preserve two 
fine plants of Anagallis caerulea on the spot where those raised from your Reigate 
seeds stood some years ago ; they are spreading on the ground with some stems more 
than two feet long.
Anagallis arvensis has also been preserved close by, with stems 
nearly as long ; both keep to their colours.
I have often endeavoured to find some 
satisfactory specific distinction between these plants, but can discover none that would 
enable a person to distinguish them when not in flower.
The caerulea is still the most 
robust plant, as formerly, and has larger leaves, vvith the veins more prominent on 
the back than in arvensis, the points of the shoots too are inclined to be somewhat 
erect, until borne down by their own weight as they advance in growth.
The corollas 
are finely laciniated, as in the plants raised from the original seeds.
Perhaps the 
stalked glands on the margin of the corolla of arvensis would be the best distinguish- 
ing character, if the plants are to be considered two species.
The points of the shoots 
of arvensis have not the same tendency to ascend as those of cserulea.
â€” David Came- 
ron ; Botanic Garden, Bh-mingliam, September 3, 1831 .
[The seeds of Anagallis ceerulea from which Mr. Cameron's first plants were raised, 
we had the pleasure of collecting near Reigate, in July, 1836.
They were immedi- 
ately forwarded to Biimingham, and plants with the blue laciniated corolla have an- 
nually sprung up in the same spot ever since that time; nor, we believe, has A.
arvensis 
once made its appearance among them, but has kept its own station close by.
We 
may perhaps, at some future time, lay before our readers all the evidence we can col- 
lect at all bearing on the question of the specific identity or distinctness of the two 
plants : in the mean time we should be obliged by the communication of any facts re- 
lating to the point at issue.
It should perhaps be mentioned that we have never heard 
of Anagallis caerulea being found wild near Birmingham.

Ulex str ictus, or Irish Furze.
Did I ever mention having saved seeds of the 
Ulex strictus, or Irish furze, in 1839, which were sown under glass in the spring of 
last year, and the seedlings transplanted out of doors in autumn ?
Of eight plants so 
obtained there is not the least deviation in the appearance from that of the parent ; 
which, although no decided proof of the plant being a genuine species, would go far 
to make me conjecture that it is so.

Enquiry relating to the Plates of Leightoii's ' Flora of Shropshire.' I beg to 
enquire, through the medium of ' The Phytologist,' which of the nineteen plates in 
Leighton's Flora has either figures or sections'of the fruit or appendages of any of the 
six following species of Carex described in the 4th vol, of Smith's ' English Flora,' 
&c.
&c.; viz., C.
angustifolia, Mielichoferi, speirostachya, stictocarpa, tenella and 
ustulata?
â€” Saml.
Gibson ; Hehden Bridge, September 7, 1841.
[Our correspondent will find figures and a section of the fruit of Carex ustulata, 
on the right hand side of plate 16, p.
461, of the Shropshire Flora; the other five Ca- 
rices enquired after, and which are described as species in the ' English Flora,' are not 
now considered to be entitled to that rank.
We are decided enemies to the multipli- 
cation of species on insufficient grounds ; and have long been of opinion that at least 
the Carex stictocarpa and angustifolia of ' English Flora,' possessed but weak claims 
to the rank assigned to them by the author.
Sir W.J. Hooker was unacquainted with 
both when the earlier editions of his ' British Flora' appeared ; and in the 4th edition 
of that work stictocarpa appears as a synonyme of Hudson's C.
recurva, and angusti- 
folia bears the same relation to C.
csespitosa, Linn.

lish Flora' as the Carex tenella of Schkuhr, Sir W.
Hooker asks in the earlier editions 
of his Flora, " May it not be a starved state of the following .'' " (C.
remota) ; he sub- 
sequently appears to have had reason for believing this conjecture to be well founded, 
for in the 4th edition of that work, we find C.
tenella sunk into a synonyme of C.
re- 
mota, Linn.
A like fate has befallen the two remaining Carices, respecting whose 
whereabouts our correspondent enquires.
The facts of the histories of the plants de- 
scribed in ' English Flora' as the Carex Mielichoferi of Willdenow and C.
speirosta- 
chya, Swartz, seem to have been somehow or other confounded in such a manner that 
it would now perhaps be difficult to unravel the mystery ; suffice it to say that in the 
last edition of the ' British Flora,' the latter has been referred to C.
fulva, Good., as a 
variety, and the name of the former appears as a synonyme of C.
phaeostachya, Sm.
And even of C.
phaeostachya itself Sir W.
Hooker remarks, " In deference to the opin- 
ion of Mr. Borrer, I rank this as a species ; but it is probably only a variety of C.
pa- 
nicea, with less glaucous (greener) herbage and a bifid beak to the fruit.
The above 
synonymes are referred hither at the suggestion of Dr. Boott." This gentleman has 
for several years past made the Carices his particular study ; and Sir W.
J. Hooker 
expresses his acknowledgments to him " for many valuable remarks and improvements 
both in the arrangement and definition " of the Carices, for the fourth edition of the 
' British Flora.' 
While on a subject connected with Mr. Leighton's ' Flora of Shropshire,' we 
embrace the opportunity of laying before our readers the following complete list of 
species and varieties new to the British Flora, described in that work.
The list may 
be regarded as a supplement to the 'Catalogue of British Plants' printed for the Bo- 
tanical Society of Edinburgh.

Drosera rotundifolia, ^.

This pretty variety grows in 
great plenty, together with the usual state of the plant, on Carrington Moss, Cheshire, 
seven miles south of Manchester.
The same individual often bears simple and com- 
pound racemes, as mentioned by Mr. Leighton.
There does not appear to be any 
difference sufficient to fonn a specific distinction.
All three species of Drosera grow 
within seven miles of Manchester ; D.

D. Anglica abundantly in various localities.

Orohanche barbata, (p.

This species is found upon St. Vincent's Rocks, 
near Bristol, where I had opportunities for examining it several years in succession.
It grows chiefly upon the ledge under the suspension bridge, and is always parasitic 
upon ivy.
The O.
minor, which I consider perfectly distinct, I have gathered in clo- 
ver fields, between Clevedon and Walton, Somersetshire, twelve miles S.W. of Bristol.
It also springs up occasionally on a steep grassy bank overhanging the sea, growing

On the craggy precipitous sides of Nightingale Valley are several fine spe-

Lycopodium.
Anything in reference to this genus will be interesting, I pre-

Four of the six species grow near Manchester, but neither of them in any 
quantity.
On a wild desolate moor called Fo-edge, about fifteen miles north, L.
cla- 
vatum, Selago and alpinum are found within a few yards of each other, together 
with a vast profusion of Allosorus crispus, which flourishes there in extraordinary 
beauty.
L. inundatum is plentiful on Baguley Moor, a spot of much celebrity 
among Manchester botanists.
In addition to the three Droseras, the following plants 
are produced there : â€”

Spurless Variety of Dog Violet.
We have lately received specimens of a form 
of Viola canina, in wMch the flowers are said to be always destitute of a spur ; thus 
assuming a regular figure.
It has been found abundantly in Bedfordshire, by Mrs.
Gye, a correspondent of Dr. Daubeny.
Thus, in the violets, we have on the one hand 
this return to a regular type, and on the other, a complete state of irregularity in those 
instances, observed in V.
rothomagensis, hirta, and others, in which the petals have 
each a spur.
This lady's violet is at this season of the year apetalous â€” a frequent oc- 
currence in V.
mirabilis, montana, and many others ; including the common sweet 
violet.

Neglected Garden in Jamaica.
At Cold-spring estate (4378 feet above the sea), 
once the seat of the Wallens family spoken of by Bryan Edwards, we found the re- 
mains of a garden, in which European and tropical vegetation were strangely blended 
too-ether, and where the plants and trees of both worlds seemed equally to luxuriate.
The fences leading to it were garnished with the white rose and the (Rosa) multiflora; 
strawberry plants in fruit and flower carpeted the ground : the Guernsey lily, the Aga- 
panthus, the beautiful Begonia and the columbine, were the wild flowers of the region.
Here we saw the English oak and Spanish chestnut spreading their noble branches, 
and almost under their shade the tea-plant and coffee-tree were in full flower.
On 
one side of the garden was a Magnolia tree, of two trunks rising from a single stem, 
each trunk about 14 inches in diameter, and a little farther on, on the mountain slopes, 
large copses of the English furze and broom, rich with yellow, aff'ording a retreat for 
the quail and partridge.
Our horses browzed on strawberry-leaves as on common 
grass: the fruit is small but refreshing, and sells for Is. a quart in Kingston market.
Near this strange spot the apple-tree was in bearing, and we saw artichokes, carrots, 
cabbages, green peas and parsneps.
St. Catherine's top was 600 feet above us, encir- 
cled by mountain mist, and the clouds were rolling in dense masses below us : it was 
a strange and wonderful scene, and we hardly knew how to admire it enough.

LOCALITIES.
England.
\ 
o ^f^' 1 I- in all our mountain districts.
Ireland.
J 
The Fir Club-Moss, next to the common Club-moss, is the most 
abundant of our British species; it is however almost exclusively con- 
fined to alpine districts, growing on bare and bleak mountain slopes, 
or occasionally rooted in the fissures of rocks.
I found it abundantly 
in the Western Highlands of Scotland, and have received specimens 
or records of habitats fro\n my kind correspondents at Edinburgh, 
showing it to be a plant of general occurrence among the Scottish 
hills ; and Mr. C.
C. Babington informs me he found it in August 
last in Harris and North Uist, two of the outer Hebrides.
From the 
North of England I have also received a variety of habitats, far too 
numerous to detail ; and in North Wales it is abundant on the ranges 
of which Snowdon, Cader Idris and Plinlymmon are the more noto- 
rious summits.
In the midland and southern counties of England we 
find it more sparingly distributed.
I have specimens before me from 
the Titterstone Clee Hill, Shropshire, found by Mr. Cameron ; from 
Moseley Common, Worcestershire, by Mr. Luxford; from Felthorpe 
Bog, Norfolk, by Mr. Wigham; from Leith Hill, Suney, and Tilgate 
Forest, Sussex, by Mr. J.
A. Brewer ; and from Woking Common, by 
Mr. D.
Cooper : Mr. C.
C. Babington has found it also on Waldi'on 
Down, Sussex.
It is said to grow in Derbyshire, Oxfordshire and 
Devonshire, but I have not seen examples from these counties.
On the Welsh mountains I have observed that only a portion of the 
plants appear to be in a thriving and healthy condition ; the larger 
ones almost invariably being loaded with fructification, and exhibit- 
ing symptoms of incipient decay.
With the exception of Dillenius I 
think no author has noticed this peculiarity ; and this learned writer 
rationally concludes that each plant exists for a definite term and then 
dies.* Whether the term of its existence be biennial, triennial, or 
longer, I leave for future observers to decide ; but I have not the 
slightest doubt that its existence has a fixed term, as suggested by the 
great muscologist.

The figures of this plant can scarcely fail of being characteristic, 
its appearance is so different from that of our other species: Dillenius 
figures several varieties, all of them very expressive of its distinguish- 
ing features.
These varieties appear to be the result of locality : 
when last at the Birmingham Botanic Garden, Mr. Cameron called 
my attention to some living specimens which he had himself collected 
on the Titterstone Clee Hill ; in these the lower leaves were consider- 
ably narrower and somewhat reflexed, and the plants (as indeed do all 
from the same locality) exhibited a uniform although scarcely describ- 
able difference from those of Scotland, the North of England, and 
Caernarvonshire; and these again differ from the specimens collected 
in Norfolk, Sussex and Surrey, which are also of uniform apjjearanco, 
of much smaller size, and have the branches obtusely pointed rather 
than flat-topped.
When rooted in the fissure of a rock it occasionally 
assinnes a pendulous character, the branches being very long and 
their extremities recurved ; in this state the whole appearance of the 
plant is graceful and elegant, and totally dissimilar to its normal 
form; such specimens I have found on the rocks in the Pass of Llan- 
berris, and my brother has lately procm-ed a fine example on the 
ascent of Plinlymmon.
Mr. Babington in a note to me observes, " I 
have a curious specimen which was growing under a rock near Llan- 
berris, in which the stems are prostrate and about a foot in length, and 
the leaves less densely placed than is usual in the species." 
This species has received credit for many extraordinary medical 
properties; T shall record only a few of these.
In the ' Flora Prus- 
sica' it is recommended as a specific for ruptures, bruises, &c.
Brey- 
nius asserts that a decoction of it destroys the lice which infest man ; 
and Linneus informs us that the Swedes employ it to kill those of 
swine and cattle.
Schwenckenfeldius says that is used by countrymen 
as a cathartic and emetic ; and Linneus, on the authority of Rothraan, 
adds that it is sold, though not commonly, in the chemists' shops of 
Sweden, under the name of " vfiuscus calharticus,^'' and is'prescribed 
in the form of a decoction as an emetic ; but remarks that the dose must 
be very weak, otherwise it is likely to produce convulsions.
Lightfoot 
says tliat it is taken by the Highlanders both as a cathartic and emetic, 
but unless used in small quantities it induces giddiness and convul- 
sions ; he also informs us that in the island of Raasay, near Skye, and 
in some other places, it is used instead of alum, to fix colours in dy- 
ing woollen cloths.
The roots are numerous, tough, wiry, tortuous, and often divided.
They are emitted from divers parts of the stem, always however where 
g2 
84 
it is in contact witli the earth.
The plant in its normal form appears 
to be perfectly erect, but its hold on the ground being apparently in- 
sufficient for the maintenance of this position, it generally becomes 
partially recumbent, as represented in the figure.
This change takes 
place as soon as the plant has risen above the stunted herbage with 
which it is commonly surrounded, and has thus subjected itself to the 
action of the violent winds that seem to be almost incessantly sweep- 
ing the mountain-sides.
The stems are repeatedly dichotomous, stout, rigid, somewhat flat- 
topped, and usually erect.
Every part of the plant is densely clothed with rigid, lanceolate, 
acute, entire leaves, much resembling those of Lycopodium annoti- 
num.
At the upper extremity of each branch a portion of these 
leaves become transformed into irregular 6-cleft calyces or cups, 
very closely resembling the perichsetia of mosses; 
the outermost lobe of the six which compose this cup 
is longer and larger than the rest, and of the pair on 
each side one is generally incumbent on the other, 
so as nearly to conceal it ; this was overlooked by 
Lightfoot, who, in speaking of the cup, describes 
it as consisting of ^^four stiff, lanceolate, incurved, 
minute leaves." This perichsetial cup is shown in 
the margin, and also at a a, in figures 2 and 3 of the 
cut below.
Lightfoot, in continuing his description, 
goes on to say, "at the bottom of this calyx are five small pellucid 
substances resembling leaves, which are supposed to be analogous to 
pistils, these in time grow up into three large broad leaves, two unit- 
ed together like the hoof of an ox, &c." I have only examined these 
parts when in the mature state.
Instead of terming the interior pro- 
12 3 4 
cesses leaves, I should be inclined to say that within each perichsetial 
cup already described, is situated a kind of flattened gemma or bud.
85 
consisting of five distinct lobes or component parts, combined at the 
base ; the three inner lobes are large, prominent and conspicuous, 
even to the naked eye, [b in figures 1, 2 and 3) ; the two outer lobes 
are very small, and may easily be overlooked, one of them is closely 
appressed to the anterior, the other to the posterior surface of the 
bud* These buds, which have no representatives in either of the 
previously-described British species of Lycopodium, are truly the 
genns of fiiture plants, as each, when mature, is detached from its 
perichaetial socket with the slightest touch, falls to the earth, and ger- 
minates with the greatest readiness : figure 4 represents a bud thus 
germinating ; it is drawn from a specimen found in a state of nature.
From the under surface of what may be termed the collum or neck of 
the bud, is protruded a single stout root, at first very pilose, but soon 
becoming smoother; and in the centre of the three large lobes ap- 
pears what might readily be mistaken for a sixth and central lobe^ but 
which is, in reality, the undeveloped stem or ascending axis of the 
young plant.
This part is very observable in figures 3 and 4, in the 
centre of each figure.
As germination advances this axis gradually 
becomes elongated upwards by the successive unfolding of the leaves, 
which are spirally arranged round it.
The stem in this advanced 
state is shown at c c, in figures 1 and 2.
When the leaves first unfold 
at the apex of the stem they are erect, but soon assmne a spreading 
direction, and finally become reflexed.
Whether these buds remain attached to the parent plant or fall to 
the ground, their germination proceeds in the same manner ; for when 
grown in a closed glass case, a situation which precludes the action 
of wind and rain, and therefore lessens the chance of their being dis- 
lodged, the buds germinate in situ, giving to the extremity of each 
branch a bushy and very remarkable appearance.
A single bud thus 
growing in its perichaetial socket is shown at figure 2.
A plant 
from the Titterstone Clee Hill, cultivated by Mr. Luxford in a closed 
glass, died during the second year, leaving green and vigorous young 
ones growing on the parent stem.
Some of the gemmae were acci- 
dentally detached when the specimen was planted in the glass about 
twelve months ago ; these have vegetated on the surface of the soil 
and produced young plants, one of which is now more than an inch 
high.
It appears to me that by these gemmae the plant is so abundantly 
* Dillenius was the first to notice these gemmae.

ramos praesertim superiora versus e foliorum alis, corpuscula cristata, crebra rigida e

so 
])r()i)agiitc(l ill a state of nature, and not by its seeds.
In a paper by 
Sir J.
E. Smith, ])rinted in the 'Transactions of the Linnean Society,' 
Mr.
.Joseph Fox, of Norwich, is said to have raised young plants of 
l^ycopodium Selago from seed.
The record of these experiments ap- 
pears to rac very unsatisfactory, as no detail is given, and I am quite 
inclined to suppose that the gemma; were mistaken by that industri- 
ous individual for the seeds ; if so, his observations have been verified 
by many subsequent cultivators.* 
I have already stated that the pericha^tial leaves and their buds 
occur near the extremities of the branches; belowthem, 
and in the axils of the ordinary leaves, are produced 
the true theca;, each ultimate branch being alike fer- 
tile throughout the greater part of its length.
The 
ihecse are sessile, large, yellow, renifonrn and bivalve ; 
their dehiscence is rectilinear and longitudinal, but 
rarely takes place in a state of nature.
In every 
plant that I have examined while living, the thecse 
have been firmly closed; by pressure however they 
may be compelled to open, when they ai'e found to 
be filled with minute yellow seeds.
A detached leaf with its axillary 
thcca is represented in the margin.
The Lycopodia of Britain being now enumerated, I think it best to 
state in answer to some direct enquiries and for the information of 
botanists generally, that this little monograph will not be reprinted in 
a separate form.
I think it due to the subscribers to ' The Phytolo- 
gist ' to give them this assurance.
I take this opportunity of return- 
ing my best thanks to those botanists who have so kindly assisted me 
in the genus Lycopodium, and of soliciting information respecting 
Jsoetes and Pilularia.
Among the specimens of Isoetes which 1 have 
seen, there appear two constant varieties, unaltered by locality or sea- 
son ; they grow side by side in the lakes of Caernarvonshire.
Any 
information tending to prove that these are or are not species, will be 
very thankfully received.
In order to allow time for communications 
on these genera, I shall not describe either of them in the December 
number of ' The Phytologist.'

Botany of the Isle of Man. I am anxious through your pages (for all which, 
yet published, I heartily thank you) to turn the attention of British botanists to a 
tract, small indeed in extent, but of much importance in the Geography of British 
plants, I mean the Isle of Man. Whether the geographical and geological relations 
of that island oscillate between the three neighbouring countries â€” England, Scotland 
and Ireland, as much as we know that it formerly gloried in making its politics do, I 
shall not stay to enquire, but proceed to the only subject with which ' The Phytolo- 
gist ' can have anything to do.
It seems to me then that the Isle of Man, lying as it 
does with relation to England, Scotland and Ireland, should be no bad field in which 
to look for connecting links between the Floras of those three countries ; and one or 
two hurried excursions made there confirm that belief.
It is thirty miles West of St.
Bees, the nearest point in England; sixteen miles South of Burran, the nearest in 
Scotland ; and twenty-seven East of Strangford, which is the nearest point of Ire- 
land : so that if mere geography, or at least geographical position, were to guide our 
conjectures, it would be, ci priori, a matter of guess more than of reasoning, to which 
of the three the Isle of Man, in its Flora, would bear most relation.
Midway between the 
very northern part of England and that part of Ireland where its middle parallel of 
latitude would cross it, and much nearer to Scotland than either, we find, first, two 
plants decidedly characteristic (I believe) of Ireland and the South of England ; and 
the third and prevailing one equally characteristic of Scotland.
The two former are, 
first, Pinguicula lusitanica, still to be found in bogs West of Douglas, and Adiantum 
' Capillus- Veneris, formerly growing at Glen Maij, near Peele ; while the prevailing 
fern of the glens throughout the Isle is Osmunda regalis, of which I have repeatedly 
gathered fronds seven and eight feet in length.
The little history of Adiantum Ca- 
pillus-Veneris as a Manx plant, is curious, and to me, who love plants for their own 
sake, vexatious; and illustrates what, I dare say, Mr. Newman and the author whom 
he quotes in his own account of Asplenium lanceolatum, intended by " the ravages of 
unprincipled botanists," (British Ferns, 66).
Some years ago, I think in 1835, I found 
this graceful fern completely roofing a small cave on the left of the glen below the 
waterfall at Glen Maij ; and sharing with my companion the pleasure of having made 
this discovery (as I then thought it), I communicated it to a few brother botanists ; 
one of whom, in return for my information, told me that it was no new discovery, for 
that the station was given in the ' Flora Scotica ' a long while ago ; so it was, as I af- 
terwards found, and it was given on the authority of one " Mr. Clark.
" About two 
years ago, when on my way home from the county of Kerry, Dr. Wood, of Cork, most 
obligingly showed me his ample and well-kept herbarium of British plants, where one 
of the first things I found was " Adiantum Capillus-Veneris.
Glen Maij, Isle of 
Man," with the date of (I think) 1809.
This I took as a knock on the head to my 
90 
claim, but was glad of it still, as establishing the plant's true nativity.
But now for 
the catastrophe : when I revisited the Glen last year for the pleasure, chiefly, of see- 
ing this fern, I found my friends had loved it to death ; â€” it was gone !
â€” gone so com- 
pletely that I thought I had mistaken the cave, and looked about for some other ; but 
when I came back to look at least at the spot where I had seen it grow, I discovered 
a morsel of a frond yet clinging on : this I carefully carried home, and planted under 
a closed glass, where it is now growing and spreading most vigorously, but in the Isle 
of Man I fear it grows no more.
I have one or two notices yet to offer on the plants 
which are found, and of some which are not found, in the Isle of Man : but must for 
the present postpone them.

Hymenophyllum Wilsoni has been found here this summer, on the Old Man, 
where it grows on wet rocks, hidden from sight by the luxuriant growth of Crypto- 
gramma crispa.
In many such situations it is found, but not in great abundance.
In 
one other situation we have found it at a comparatively low elevation, on a large moss- 
covered stone, standing in, but not overflowed by, a mountain stream.

Lycopodium clavutum.
One plant only grows in a field near the lake, the sur- 
face of which is peat and below it gravel.
The part in which this plant grows has had 
the grass removed, and appears to have been burned.
It was observed about two 
months since : there has been no appearance of fructification.
The field, which is a 
large one, has been well looked over, bnt no other plant has been found.

Lastrcea rigida.
I have much pleasure in giving you an opportunity to record 
in the pages of your interesting periodical a Westmoreland habitat of Lastrsea rigida, 
whence I supplied myself for the first time on the 15th of July, 1840.
I believe the 
station had been known to a gentleman resident in the neighbourhood for many years, 
but he kept his secret close, lest the exterminating searcher should remove all traces 
of his valuable discovery.
My knowledge of the fern arose from Miss Beever, who, in 
1839, sent a few fronds for my opinion, slating her belief that they were Lastraea rigi- 
da, which belief Mr. Francis, to whom specimens had also been sent, fully confirmed.
The fern grows sparingly on the side of a road leading from Morecambe Bay to 
Arnside, on the very confines of Westmoreland, and in very great abundance on the 
southern face of Arnside Knot, a limestone hill which rises northward from that road.
Phcenix-like, it springs from the ashes of its parent, without any apparent access to 
nourishment but what it may receive from ihe decayed fronds of the preceding year, 
by which it is surrounded.
Its tufts are very dense, each consisting of many hundred 
fronds, so that T cannot entertain the least fear ihat it should ever be eradicated.
I 
may remark that, from its less elevated site than near Settle, hitherto the chief source, 
through Mr. Tatham, of supply to the botanical world, its fructification is more often 
perfected, and the character of the plant is more fully developed, in the Westmoreland 
than in the Yorkshire habitat.
Nor can I avoid noticing how completely the Arnside 
plant stamps the correctness of the figure given in Mr. Newman's elegant and valua- 
ble History of Ferns.
This may have been noticed by those who have received speci- 
mens from the Botanical Societies of either London or Edinburgh, to both which I 
sent several the past year and furnish more the present one.

Gentiana Pneumonanthe with white flowers.
I send herewith a white-flowered 
specimen of Gentiana Pneumonanthe.
It was gathered on the 5th of August last, at 
PouUon-le-Sands, near Lancaster, in the same place as that from which I stored my- 
self in July last year, hut where, 1 fear, ere next summer, the plough will have de- 
stroyed the hoard.
The plant grew among whins, confined to an area of a very few 
feet, in the centre of an uncultivated piece of ground.
Out of sixty specimens ga- 
thered hy me this year, about twelve were white ; and perhaps the white were in the 
same proportion to the blue ones last year, hut I did not take particular notice.
Their 
appearance in the bright sunshine was most exquisite.

Polygonum dumetorum grows copiously in the hedges on more than one part of 
the road from the Woking-Common station to Guildford.
â€” /.
S. Mill ; Kensington, 
Octobei- 3, 1841.
[This is one of those odd plants which we can never expect to find in the same 
spot two years in succession.
At least such is the case so far as we are taught by 
our observation of its habits in the neighbourhood of Reigate.
Previously to the year 
1 836, when we had the good fortune to detect it, Polygonum dumetorum was not 
known as a Reigate plant; in the following year it was found in one or two other sta- 
tions; from one at least of these it has entirely disappeared, but to make amends has 
sprung up in the greatest abundance in a locality some miles from either of those 
previously occupied by il.
We are always glad to record the stations of such plants, 
wherever they may choose temporaiily to take up their residence.

Rarer Plants of the Isle of Wight.
I observed the following less common 
plants in the Isle of Wight, during a week's tour in July, some years ago.
MARITIME PLANTS.
Matthiola, (no doubt) incana, or Cheiran- Cakile maritima 
thus incanus, in inaccessible plt-.ces Adenarium (Arenaria) peploides 
on Compton Cliff's, Freshwater Bay. Pyrethrum maritimum (Ryde) 
The same plant grows most abun- Convolvulus Soldanella (sands near Yar- 
dantly in places overhanging the sea mouth) 
on the promontory of Posilipo, and Salsola Kali (Ryde) 
other similar situations near Naples, Atriplex littoralis 
where it flowers copiously in Febru- Beta maritima 
ary, and little children collect bou- Euphorbia Peplis (Sandown Bay) 
quets of the plant at great apparent Arundo arenaria 
risk, to sell to passers by.
Triticum Nardus 
SALT MARSHES NEAR YARMOUTH.
Althaea oflicinalis Salicornia herbacea 
Tamarix gallica Chenopodium maritimum 
IN A MARITIME BOG AT EASTON, NEAR FRESHWATER.
Ranunculus Lingua Scirpus maritimus 
Epipactis palustris Cladium Mariscus 
MISCELLANEOUS.
Pea hulbosa.
Alum Bay.
Mentha rotundifolia.
This plant, so common on the continent, but comparatively so 
unfrequent in England, grows on the Undercliff", in a maritime situation, near 
Puckaster Cove.
Lathyrus sylveslris and Rubia peregrina.
Common in hedges on the Undercliff.
The 
former grows in profusion on the landslip near Bonchurch.
92 
Iris fcEtidissima.
As common on the Undercliff, and (if I recollect right) in other 
parts of the island as in Devonshire.
Inula Helenium.
By the side of a lane between Yarmouth and Freshwater Bay, hut 
sparingly.
PLANTS COLLECTED SHORTLY AFTERWARDS ON THE COAST OF HAMPSHIRE, OPPOSITE 
TO THE ISLE OF WIGHT.
Atriplex portulacoides.
Abundant in salt marshes at Lymington.
Bartsia viscosa and Fumaria capreolata.
Roadside between Lymington and Exbury.
Euphorbia striata.
Cornfields near Beaulieu river.
Campanula hederacea.
New Forest, near Ashurst Lodge.
Parnassia palustris, Drosera longifolia and Myrica Gale.
In various parts of the Fo- 
rest.â€” J.

60.
Laihrcsa squamaria.
I once obtained a very expressive example of the para- 
sitical property of Lathreea.
It was attached to a small branch of the root of a pop- 
lar, which was closely surrounded by the thick branched roots of the Lathrsea, whose 
tuberous suckers penetrated the root of the poplar.
The example figured by Mr.
Bowman in the Linnean Transactions, is evidently derived from a young plant.
In 
mine the suckers by which the root of the Lathrasa attached itself, were numerously 
seated upon its principal divisions, not at the termination of the lesser branches mere- 
ly, but wherever a point of contact between the parasite and its prey existed, there 
were tebe found the suckers.

Sium nodijlorum.
I beg to forward a specimen of Sium uodiflorum with a 
remarkably long flower-stalk.
The umbels of this species are commonly said to be 
sessile, but in this neighbourhood at least, absolute sessility is rare.
â€” Geo. Sparkes ; 
Bromley, Kent, October 11, 1841.
[The umbels of Sium nodiflorum are rarely, we believe, quite sessile, and we have 
observed the peduncle to vary much in length ; in the specimen sent by our coiTespond- 
ent it is about as long as the umbel.
The specimen appears to be a portion of a 
very luxuriant plant.

62.
Anagallis ccerulea.
With respect to the query at p.
76 of ' The Phytologist,' I 
may observe that I never found but one plant of Anagallis cserulea near Bromley, and 
that I have in vain searched the same field for two successive years without finding 
another.
I once met with a solitary plant at Leamington in Warwickshire.
The blue 
in this instance had a distiuct shade of violet.

Curious Fern.
Enclosed are specimens of what I consider a very curious va- 
riety of Athyrium Filix-foemina.
The original plant was found in the county of Gal- 
way, Ireland, by a Mr. Smith, brother I believe to Mr. Smith, curator to the Hull 
Botanic Garden, where I noticed a vigorous specimen in the course of last summer.
During the last two years I have had many opportunities of observing the plant in cul- 
tivation, in which state its form appears constant, although grown in a variety of soils 
and situations.
From the great irregularity in the laciniation of the pinnae I have 
experienced considerable difliculty in determining its venation, which however appears 
to agree with that of the normal state of the lady-fem.
I have minutely examined a 
great number of fronds, but can discover no traces of fructification.
In the herbarium 
of a friend I have seen specimens of an unusual form of A.
Filix-fcemina collected in 
Staffordshire, which agree with the one under consideration in the irregularity of size 
and cutting of the pinnul2e, but are without any division or branching of the rachis; 
they likewise agree in the dwarfish habit and permanent barrenness of the fronds.
93 
The plant grows readily, increasing its roots and putting out fresh fronds much in the 
manner of shoots, without having any well-defined rhizoma.
Finding no allusion to 
this variety in your valuable 'History of British Ferns,' or in the 'Notes on Irish Na- 
tural History,' I have been induced, in the spirit of enquiry, to place these specimens 
and notes entirely at your disposal, in order that the variety may be assigned to what- 
ever species it may belong, through the medium of ' The Phytologist,' to which, and 
its promising contemporary ' The Entomologist,' I wish enduring success.
â€” John Har- 
dy ;* 52, Trippet Lane, Sheffield, October 11, 1841.
[The singular fronds accompanying this obliging letter, evidently partake in some 
degree of a monstrous or unnatural character, the rachis being often dichotomous and 
irregularly branched, and the pinnulse invariably ban-en.
The venation, although 
uncertain and affording no positively tangible character, evinces a nearer approach to 
that of Cystopteris fragilis than to any other of our ferns, the veins in the pinnulae be- 
ing alternately branched ; the size also of the fronds, which do not exceed seven inches 
in length, and the decurrent pinnulee attached throughout to the midrib of the pinna, 
favour this conclusion, as these characters occur not uncommonly in some of the forms 
of that pretty species.

Description of a metamorphosed variety of Polytrichum commune.
On examin- 
ing some specimens of mosses received a few days ago from Roborough, Devon, my 
attention was drawn to a remarkable accidental variety of Polytrichum commune, 
which exhibited the union of two calyptrae, forming a very beautiful illustration of the 
power of cohesion of two distinct bodies, under favourable circumstances, possessed by 
the vegetable kingdom, and so commonly represented by united leaves, stems, flower- 
stalks, &c.
The description of the specimen is as follows.
Stem about three inches 
high, branched, producing two terminal setae: perichcetia distinct: calyptrce closely 
adhering by their hairy covers : leaves patent, linear-subulate, the margins not invo- 
lute, serrated ; keel seiTated at the tip.
The specimen in question is remarkable for 
its manner of growth, it having two setae from the apex of the stem, each surrounded 
by a distinct perichsetium ; the calyptrae also are united by their hairy covers, thus 
forming a two-celled calyptra : â€” the origin of which appears to have been in the deve- 
lopment of two setae from the same axis, and the consequent proximity, and most pro- 
bably the pressure together, of the outer coverings of the calyptrae, which would cause 
them to adhere while in a young state, and being thus earned upwards by the elonga- 
tion of the setae, fonned the monstrosity in question.
The above was read before the 
Botanical Society of London, on the 4th of September, 1840 ; I have since received 
similar specimens from G.
B. Johns, Esq. found by him on an old wall on the banks 
of the river Walkham, near Walkhampton, Devon, growing plentifully.
There is al- 
so in the herbarium of the Bot. Soc.
Lond.
a specimen of P.
juniperinum, collected 
by Mr. W.
Gardiner, jun.
of Dundee, at Hare Craigs, near Broughton, exhibiting a 
similar monstrosity in that species.

Lycopodium Selago detected in Tilgate Forest, Sussex.
I was very much pleased 
last week on visiting Tilgate Forest, to find Lycopodium Selago growing plentifully 
on the banks of the pond below the bog between Pease-pottage gate and Starve-mouse 
plain.
L. Selago, inundatum and clavatum were all growing in abundance within 
the space of twenty yards.
Exacum filiforme was growing abundantly in the bog, and 
in great perfection.

Tragopogon pratemis.
T have not the slightest doubt that the Tragopogon no- 
ticed by Messrs.
Irvine and Pamplin at Cobhara (Phyt, 36), is the true T.
pratensis of 
Linnsus and Smith, (Eng. Bot.
t. 434).
It is far from being a common plant in Eng- 
land, indeed the only specimens that I have seen are from Sussex (Fvamfield) and 
Suffolk, (St. Petei-s, Southelmham) ; and it appears to be totally unknown to the ma- 
jority of English botanists.
The more common Tragopogon is, I think, as certainly 
the T.
minor of Fries, as was pointed out several years since by Mr. Leighton.

Polypodiam Dryopteris and calcareum.
1 am much pleased with ' The Phy- 
tologist,' which promises to be a very useful medium for exchanging infonnation on 
botanical subjects; and as you seem to adopt the scrap-book motto, viz.
"the smallest 
contribution thankfully received," I may venture to add a mite.
You find Mr. Wil- 
son's opinion coincides with mine, as lo the distinctness of the two Polypodia â€” Dry- 
opteris and calcareum.
The pubescence, wbich is one distinguishing character of P.
calcareum, is a beautiful microscopic object, each slender stem supporting a globular 
head, but this pubescence soon dries, so that only on freshly gathered specimens can it 
be fully perceived or accurately examined.
Though we found P.
Dryopteris fre- 
quently in Wales, we never met with P.
calcareum there ; and though, like Mr. Wil- 
son, we have cultivated them side by side for years, we can also testify that their re- 
spective characters remain unchanged.

Monotropa Hypopilys.

Silene nutans, (Phytol.

Will your correspondent be good enough to 
say if the plant grew on or about the Castle previous to the burning ?
Or are we to 
regard the circumstance he mentions as a curious parallel to that spoken of by Mori- 
son (Dialogus inter Socium &c., p.
495), respecting the sudden appearance of Sisym- 
brium Irio on the ruins of London, after the great fire of 1666 ?

Quinate OEnothera.
I have been much interested this autumn by finding nu- 
merous flowers on a plant of OEnothera grandiflora in my garden, possessed of five 
sepals, five petals, ten stamens and five to ten stigmas, while the remainder of the 
flowers on the same individual presented the usual quaternary arrangement of their 
parts.
This may have been observed before, but as it is an interesting fact in Phyto- 
logy, I send it you for publication if you think proper.

Substitution of Leaves for Petals in a Dahlia.
While upon this subject, I may 
mention that a Dahlia of mine has this autumn presented the curious substitute of 
green leaves for petals ; the whole of the " flower " being composed of thick, fleshy ex- 
pansions, arranged in an imbricate fonn, and springing, not from a common recepta- 
cle, but in regular verticils on the terminating half-inch or so of the peduncle.
A 
more beautiful illustration of the doctrine of Morphology I have seldom seen.

In the Gardeners' Chronicle for September 25, 1841 , we observe the following 
correction of an error which appeared in a preceding No., and was copied by us into 
'The Phytologist,' p.
80.
" Spurless variety of Dog Violet.

Gage." We did not see this until too late for inserting it in our last.

Eriophorum alpinum.
We are glad to see from a notice in the Gardeners' 
95 
Chronicle, p.
662, that this pretty little plant " has been re-discovered in a new situa- 
tion, about two miles from Dumlanrig Castle." We suspect that this should be 
Drumlanrig, in Dumfriesshire ; if so it is about 90 miles South of the " bog of Reste- 
nat, near Forfar," hitherto the only authentic British station for this species, but where 
for many years it has not been found, in consequence of the bog having been drained.
In preparing for publication the second edition of ' English Botany,' it is a pity that 
the figure of the young Carex dioica should not have been erased from the otherwise 
characlerislic portrait of this Eriophorum, (E.
B. 31 1, and I.
71 of the new edition); 
at all events we think it ought to have been mentioned in the text, for it is obvious 
that the figure as it now appears, must mislead those who have not seen the plant it- 
self, unless they have access to Smith's ' English Flora,' where alone, we believe, has 
the error been noticed, â€” Ed.

Death of M.

Seven volumes of M.

Mr. Watson exhibited specimens of the following plants : â€” 
1. Mimulus luteus, found by him apparently wild and gi-owing abundantly in marshy ground along the 
north side of tlie Tay, fjom half a mile to a mile below Perth ; and also from a rill by the roadside, in front 
of Daenacardock Inn, forest of Athol, Perthshire.
2. A laud variety of CallUriche pcdunculala, from Mr. W.'s garden, supposed to have originally come 
from Esher Common, and inadvertently made in the fourth edition of Hooker's 'British Flora' a variety of 
C. autumualis instead of C.
pedunculata, a species with which it perfectly agrees in the elongated peduncle 
and keeled fruit, the latter being only half the size of the fruit of C autumnalis.
3. A series of five specimens of Fvstitca pratensis and loUacea, showing the intermediate states of the 
supposed two species.
The first was the common fonn of F.
loliacea of British authors, bearing eleven 
nearly sessile spikelets disposed alternately along the common stalk or rachis, so as to constitute a simple 
spike or raceme The second differed by having the peduncles of the spikelets slightly longer, and two of 
them divided The third, still a spiked raceme of Festuca luliacca, but in the place of the two lower spike- 
lets there were two branches bearing respectively four and sLx nearly sessile spikelets.
In the foui-th the form 
of the panicle was more developed, there being seven principal branches bearing from two to five spikelets 
each, on very short stalks.
In the fifth the spikelets were more decidedly stalked and disposed into a panicle, 
which had the ordiuai-y appearance of that of Festuca pratensis in luxuriant growth.
All five specimens 
96 
were gathered by the Thames, shortly above the Lock at East Moulsey, the racemose inflorescence distin- 
guishing the specimens which had grown nearer tJie towing path, where the ground was more dry and stony.
4. Cniciis pratensis and Forsteri.
A series of specimens designed to show that branched plants of 
C. praUnsis are referi'ed by botanical authorities to C.
Forsteri, and that possibly aU specimens of C.
Foi-s- 
teri are luxuriantly developed plants of C.
pratensis.
Four specimens of C.
pratensis were exhibited in its 
usual state, each having a solitary flower and from one to three crenate leaves on the stem.
A fifth differed 
fi-om these in having two flowers and six leaves on its stem.
A sixth specimen from Sir W.
J. Hooker, and 
labelled "C.
Forsteri, Weybridge," had also a two-flowered stem, the lower portion of which was absent, 
but it was accompanied by a leaf somewhat pinnatifid instead of crenate at the edges.
Two other specimens, 
gathered near Whitmoor Pond, Surrey, in June last, presented a still wider variation from the ordinary form 
of C.
pratensis, and would be called C.
Forsteri by most botanists : the stems bore respectively two and 
four flowers, and eight and ten pinnatifid leaves.
Only a single plant had been found by Mr.
"W., but having 
six separate stems from the same root, mostly with two or three flowers each.
The last specimen exhibited 
was one that had been collected by Mr. Coleman near East Grinstead.
This one differed from the Whitmoor 
plant in having its leaves more divided and a branched stem bearing eleven flowers, together with the broken 
peduncles of two or three others.
Mr. C.'s specimens closely con'esponded with the specimens of C.
Forsteri 
preserved in Smith's herbarium, and is doubtless the true plant.
In the absence of the intei-mediate speci- 
mens it would have appeared to be very distinct from C.
pratensiSihntthe transition is so strongly established 
throughout the other specimens as to render it difficult to say where the one alleged species ends and the other 
commences.
Mr. Watson states the transition is still fiullier aided by a foreign specimen in Smith's herba- 
rium, labelled " Carduus dissectus, (Vill.)' and which has only one flower though many leaves on a stem.
Between the Weybridge C.
Forsteri, as named by Sir W.
J. Hooker, and the two-flowered specimens of C pra- 
tensis, there was scarcely a perceptible difference, except in the one pinnatifid leaf of the former and the 
slightly crenate leaves of the latter ; but to counterbalance this difference in foliage Mr. Watson produced 
two leaves gathered that day from the same plant in his garden, one of which was simply crenate, while the 
other was pinnatifid ; the plant from which they were plucked being an undoubted C.
pratensis.
5. Juncus lampocarpns and nigritellus.
A series of specimens to show that J.
nigritellus of English 
botanists is identical with J.
lampocarpus, unless in some cases where small specimens of J.
acutiflorus pass 
under the same name.
Mr. Watson believed that J.
nigritellus might originate in two ways from J.
lampo- 
carpus : occasionally small feeble plants of the latter, with very few clusters of flowers, are named J.
nigri- 
tellus, but perhaps more usually this alleged species is represented by detached shoots or branches of J.
lam- 
pocarpus, produced by the flower-stalk being trodden down by cattle or laid prostrate by wet weather ; various 
changes are thus made in its inflorescence ; one of the variations being seen in the production of roots at the 
joints of the stem, and the shooting up of secondary branches, terminated by a few clusters of flowers.
As 
the old stem decays, these branches, being rooted at the base, become distinct plants and are gathered as 
J. nigritellus, as was shown by specimens on the table.
It was Mr. Watson's opinion that several of our 
alleged species are in fact only extreme forms of some one or two other species .
In speaking of one alleged 
species being the extreme forms of two other species, he meant that the varieties of the two might be so much 
alike as to be combined into a third supposed species by those botanical writers who describe plants from 
dried specimens, and also do not supply then- herbaria with series of specimens sufficient to illustrate the 
range of variation for each species.
A letter was read from Mr James Eich, of Mahon, giving an account of a botanical excursion made by 
him to Majorca.
Mr. R.
having left Mahon in the latter part of April, reached Palma after a sail of four 
days, from whence he proceeded to Valldemosa, about eight miles distant, which Mr. E.
remarks is " a place 
of extreme beauty amongst the mountains ; in some places the rocks rise to an immense height, almost per- 
pendicularly fi-om the road, with their grey-looking solitaiy peaks generally buried in clouds.
At their bases 
the luxuriance of the vegetation is unmatchable, but as you look higher up you see nothing but a stunted 
oak or a pine (Q,uercus Ilex and Pinus halepensis), gi-owing as it were out of the solid rock." The following 
plants are a portion of those collected by Mr. E.
for the Society's collection, viz.
â€” Punica gi-anatum, Aspho- 
delus ramosus and fistulosus, Lonicera inflexa.
Iris sisyrinchium, Hypericum Balearicum, Delphinium sta- 
physagi-ia, Ceterach officinarum, Sedum altininum.
Salvia clandestina.
Origanum majoricum.
Thymus fili- 
formis, Verbascum sinuatum, and a number of others which, although common to England, are exceedingly 
interesting in a geographical point of view.
Mr. E.'s next journey was to SoUer, about fifteen mUes distant 
from Palma, and three miles from the sea, the details of which he has promised to give in his next letter, and 
concludes the present vrith a list of species added to his former collection, amongst which we observed Althsea 
hirsuta, Lavendula spicata and dentata, Bellis annua, Tragacanthus poteiium, Hedysarum spinosissimum, 
Psoralea bituminosa, Cytisus spinosa and argenteus, Anchusa angustifoha, and Anagallis phtenicea ; most 
of which were collected on the road from Valldemosa to SoUer, near the base of the mountains, some of which 
rise to an altitude of near 5000 feet above the sea.

Having engaged to accompany my friend Mr. Buckman, of Chelten- 
ham, in a botanical exploration of the Cotswold Hills, in the second 
week of September last, we found ourselves on the evening of the third 
day at the base of the precipice of Cleeve Cloud, on our return.
We 
had just emerged from a rocky wood, where we had been fortunate 
enough to find Rubus saxatilis in fine fruit, Convallaria Polygonatum, 
also in fruit, and some other rarities ; and were about at once to turn 
our steps homeward, when I noticed a thick beech-wood about two 
miles farther on, and proposed advancing to it.
My friend, who had 
been on his legs ever since the early morn, for we had travelled far 
and long, rather quailed at this proposition, urging the necessity of 
recruiting the outer man before undertaking further enterprizes, but 
yielded the point on my suggesting to him that we might possibly find 
Monotropa Hypopitys, although he said he had never heard of its 
growing there.
On arriving at our ground we scaled a stone wall, 
and entered such a "twilight grove" as I have seldom seen.
It form- 
ed indeed a tent of the densest foliage, consisting almost exclusively 
of beeches ; and as evening was rapidly approaching, was really so 
dark that we could scarcely at first see our way to find anything.
After a little inspection my friend showed me several fine specimens 
of Epipactis grandiflora, which only redoubled my anxiety to find 
the Monotropa, but we searched for some time in vain.
At last we 
detected a stunted specimen, then several others, and finally, where a 
tree had been felled, there was a luxuriant growth of thirty or forty all 
together.
I deemed this a favourable opportunity to ascertain, if pos- 
sible, whether Monotropa were really parasitical, as suggested by Mr.
Luxford, (Phytol.
43).
Mr. L.
states that he could not satisfy him- 
self on this point; and indeed Sir James Smith remarks in his 
* English Flora,' that he " could never find it truly parasitical, any 
more than Mr. Graves, though the uniform pallid hue of the plant in- 
dicates it to be so."* I was accordingly careful to get up several 
roots deep enough fi-om among the dead fungoid mass of beech-leaves 
that thickly matted the ground.
On commencing my investigation at home, I found considerable 
difficulty in removing the ir.atted mass of soil around the base of my 
plants ; and in attempting to trace the connection of the tapering base 
of the succulent stem therewith, in spite of all my care, several stems 
broke off, and I was foiled in my efforts, although I found the fibres 
of the beech-roots inextricably connected with this compact brown 
* ' English Flora,' ii.

lump, (see fig.
1).
Lookiug carefully, however, over the mass of roots 
and soil I had brought away, I observed numerous young plants which 
seemed to promise greater facilities in the examination.
These I ac- 
cordingly worked at very patiently, but still, at the base of each ap- 
peared what to the naked eye seemed hard granules of soil mixed up 
with hairy radical fibres of beech.
Expecting that maceration in wa- 
ter would remove this hard matter and expose the roots of the Mono- 
tropa, I steeped them in water ; but to my surprise they remained as 
hard and intractable as before.
On applying a lens to solve this mys- 
tery, it became fully evident that these hard hairy knobs were in fact 
parasitical nidi attached to the roots of the beech, and deriving their 
sustenance from them.
Having now obtained a clew, I found that the 
hairy knobs on the beech-roots were of all sizes, from that of a pea, 
fi'om which the little embryo Monotropa was sprouting, to that of a crab, 
nourishing a full company of several plants, (see the figures).* These 
parasitical knobs, which constitute the nidi from which the Mono- 
tropa springs, are formed on the extreme radical fibres of the beech, 
but I was able to trace their connection with the thicker roots, and 
they were evidently composed of the swollen fibres agglomerated to- 
gether, and so covered with a brown hirsuture, that to the eye they 
looked like lumps of compact soil.
The larger knobs had the same 
aspect when examined with a lens, so that they, no doubt, increase in 
size every year, as additional sustenance is required by the multiply- 
ing plants ; for when a single plant has once established itself on its 
parasitical attachment, numerous offsets soon arise from the parent 
plant, (see fig.
1).
At the same time, as the juices are concentrated 
in the knob, and it increases in size, so do the fibres about it ramify- 
in complexity on all sides, and send forth their spongioles in every 
direction, so that the parasitic mass, like the mistletoe, always has an 
abundant magazine at command.
These hairy parasitical nidi ap])ear 
to me most analogous to the moss-balls formed by the Cynips Kosae 
on roses and sweet-briars, except that while the latter, being formed 
for the nourishment and habitation of insects, only endure for a sea- 
son, the former are perennial.
I have shown, I think satisfactorily, that the hairy vesicular knobs 
that I have discovered, are seated on, and of necessity nourished by, 
the radical fibres of the beech, connected as these are with the rami- 
fications of larger roots.
As the Monotropa springs from and derives 
its nourishment through the medium of these nidi, which increase in 
* I observed, also, many very minute nodules on the beech-roots, where the embryo 
plant was as yet not apparent.
h2 
100 
size with the growth of the plant, it is proved to be a true parasite.
The figures will show the connection of the knobs and radical fibres 
perhaps better than can be explained by words.
I scarcely wonder that any one should consider Monotropa to be 
non-parasitical, for it requires the utmost care and patience in the ex- 
amination ; and it is only after much attention that I have arrived at 
the persuasion that it is really a parasite.
The full-grown plant is 
naturally examined by all who have the opportunity, but here the at- 
tempt to trace the connection between its stem and the roots of the 
beech, is rendered so difficult, if not impossible, by the impermeable 
mass of fibres, mould, and fleshy clusters* that appear, that it becomes 
no easy matter to untie the truly Gordian knot.
Added to which the 
stem of the Monotropa tapers down to so narrow a junction with its root, 
that it generally breaks off in the examination.
Besides, the whole 
mass is obscured with a hirsuture that appears like a byssoid fungus.
These hairy fibres, however, appear to me to be really part of the eco- 
nomy of the plant, imbibing nutriment fi'om the rootlets of the beech, 
to which they are closely applied, and conveying it to the succulent ra- 
dicles of the Monotropa, with which they are also connected.
In proof 
of this I find these hairy fibres closely applied to the swollen rootlets 
in the smallest plants that I have been able to find.
As I before sta- 
ted, therefore, I perceived it expedient to hunt for young unexpanded 
plants, their connection with the roots of the beech being more readily 
observable than in matured flowering ones, from the cause previously 
mentioned.
In every case the only clear way to observe the connec- 
tion of the roots of the beech with those of the Monotropa, is to steep 
the hirsute knob at the root of the latter in water, after clearing away 
as much of the mould as possible, and then placing the moistened 
mass on paper, carefully examine it with a magnifier.
The fleshy 
roots of the Monotropa will then appear as if covered with a varnish, 
inextricably mixed up with the beech rootlets, which in various pla- 
ces appear swollen at their junction with the parasite, while a close 
examination shows ultimate hairy fibres fixing the roots of the Mono- 
tropa to the rootlets of the beech, and seeming to absorb nutriment 
from the alburnum of the latter.
The rootlets thus circumstanced are 
evidently in a living state, vigorous, and sending forth their minute 
spongioles in all directions.
The question still remains for elucidation, as to how the seed of the 
* The fleshy clustered radicles of the Monotropa bear a considerahle resemblance 
to the " densely aggregated fleshy fibres" which form the root of Listera Nidus-Avis.
Xhey are as succulent, but still more crowded and brittle than in the latter plant.
101 
Monotropa establishes itself upon the rootlets of the beech, and by 
what process the hirsute knobs from which it derives its nourishment 
are formed.
The seed must exercise some power in concentrating the 
juices of the rootlet about it, and in forming this magazine of nutri- 
ment, which may be analogous to that performed by the liquid which 
the Cynips deposits with its egg in the plant or tree frequented by it, 
producing those curious galls so common on the oak and other vege- 
tables.
It may also be questionable how long the Monotropa requires 
to arrive at maturity after the seed has fallen, for I would not be too 
certain that the young plants I met with were seedlings of last year, 
though it is probable they are so.
When once established, numerous 
offsets are thrown off from the perennial nidus.
Monotropa Hypopi- 
tys varies much in size and luxuriance, some specimens with a single 
flower being only three inches high, wliile others occur above a foot 
in height, with a cluster of seven or eight flowers.
The strong prim- 
rose-like scent exhaling from it is very remarkable and characteristic.
The seeds are peculiar, and as the valves of the capsule open, they 
appear pressing out at the interstices like a host of very minute worms.
Smith describes them as " very numerous, minute, oval, each enve- 
loped in a membranous reticulated tunic, greatly elongated at both 
ends." In fact their structure is scarcely discernable with the naked 
eye from their minuteness, but when examined through a lens, they 
appear like very minute globules of gum, screwed up in a white elon- 
gated envelope, and thus simulating the aspect of extremely small 
worms.
They are so adhesive to anything they come in contact with, 
that even when accidentally dropping on the smooth surface of the 
finger-nail, they cannot be shaken off.
This shows how easily the 
seeds may affix themselves to the roots of the beech under which they 
grow, whose radicles, more almost than those of any other tree, ap- 
proach the surface of the earth, and so occupy the ground that scarce- 
ly any other plants, besides mosses and fungi, can flourish beneath its 
shade.

â€” Three Days on the Yorkshire Moors.
By Richard Spruce, Esq.
The excursion detailed in the following pages was undertaken, in company witli 
a botanical friend (Mr. Ibbotson of Gautborpe), principally with the view of explor- 
ing Whitston-cliffe, on the western edge of the oolitic hills, and the Hole of Horcum, 
on the high moors between Pickering and Whitby.
We left Ganthorpe, a small village about a mile and a half West of Castle-How- 
102 
ard, at 9 o'clock in the morning of Tuesday, June 29th, 1841 ; a walk of a mile 
brought us to Terrington, a noted locality for Sedum dasyphyllura, which we observed 
on an old wall.
On Colton Moor, three miles farther on, we first observed Digitalis 
purpurea; and throughout the rest of our journey we never went far without seeing it 
in greater or less quantity : here too we noticed the pretty Antennaria dioica.
From 
Colton to Gilling the distance is three miles ; between the last-named place and Am- 
pleforth College we saw Carex intermedia ; and in ascending the steep hill to Am- 
pleforth Mill, we gathered a few plants of Geranium columbinum.
On Ampleforth 
Moor we found Empetrum nigrum and Lycopodium clavatum, plants which oc- 
cur abundantly on all the high moors, besides a few plants of Aspidium Oreop- 
teris.
Having passed Ampleforth Moor we came upon Wass Moor, and were busi- 
ly employed in hunting for Lycopodium alpinum, which is said to grow there, when 
we were driven from our ground by a tremendous thunder-storm, and after various 
stoppages reached the Hambleton Hotel, 16J miles from our place of starting, at 5 
o'clock P.M., amidst a heavy fall of rain.
Our plans were now totally disconcerted, 
for we had anticipated spending the greater part of the afternoon and evening at 
Whitston cliff e ; we however started again about 6 o'clock, and in twenty minutes 
reached the brow of Whitstoncliffe, having in our way observed Listera cordata, Aira 
verna [?] and Lycopodium Selago.
Here the view was most magnificent ; we stood on 
the highest part of an almost perpendicular range of cliffs, extending in the form of a 
crescent, at an elevation of 1,178 feet above the level of the sea.
At our feet lay Gor- 
mire, a remarkable lake about a mile in circumference, but appearing to us scarcely 
larger than a duck-pond ; beyond extended a vast plain, a continuation of the vale of 
York, on which we distinguished Thirsk, distant about five miles, and several other 
towns ; farther still were lofty hills, conspicuous among which was Penhill, at the en- 
trance of the romantic valley of Wensley dale.
We now commenced descending the 
hill â€” no trifling task, and in our way down gathered fine specimens of Avena praten- 
sis (frequent on the coralline oolite of Yorkshire, and also on the magnesian limestone), 
Aira cristata, Neckera crispa, Jungermannia Tamarisci and Sphserophoron coralloides.
At Gormire we collected Pilularia globulifera, and Potamogeton heterophyllus with- 
out floating leaves, and noticed Menyanthes trifoliata.
If the descent had been difii- 
cult, much more fatiguing and dangerous was it to ascend, as we did at the steepest 
part where an ascent was at all practicable.
On our toilsome journey we collected 
Arabis hirsuta, Geranium lucidum, Aspidium aculeatum, Cystopteris fragilis, Asple- 
nium Trichomanes, Tortula tortuosa and Jungermannia platyphylla.
We had not 
reached the summit of the cliff when we were again overtaken by a heavy shower, and 
having clambered up as speedily as possible, we sat down under an old wall with an 
umbrella spread over us.
And here we saw a sight that can be seldom witnessed ; a 
beautiful rainbow extended over our heads to the opposite extremity of the crescent, 
whence it was continued downwards into the vale below, and, had it not been for the 
small space immediately underneath us, would have formed a perfect circle.
After 
spending little more than two hours at Whitstoncliffe, for the satisfactory exploration 
of which as many days would be required, we made the best of our way to the hotel.
We were detained at the hotel by rain until 9 o'clock the following day, June 
30th, when we again started and walked across Hambleton to Scawton, 2J miles, and 
in our way gathered Poa compressa and Orthotrichum Hutchinsiae on an old wall ; 
passing the village we descended into a deep glen called "the Howie," where we spent 
a considerable time very usefully.
The most conspicuous object here was the elegant 
103 
Polypodium Phegopteris, which grew in the greatest profusion on the rocks houndin,g 
the narrow valley ; hesides laying in a stock of this, we gathered Dicranum pellu- 
cidum, Hookeria lucens, Hypmun palustre, Jungermannia asplenioides, Jung, furcata 
\a.\\ ^,elongata, Peltidea horizoutalis and canina, â€” all heautifully in fructification.
Leaving Scawton Howie we next directed our course to Rievaulx, 3 miles.
No- 
thing particular met our view (save Verbascum Thapsus growing in the rocky places) 
until we came to a boggy mead within a short distance of Rievaulx, where we gather- 
ed fine specimens of Primula farinosa, Schcenus nigricans and Eriophorum pubescens.
At Rievaulx, on the bridge which crosses the Rye, grew Geranium pusillum ; and at 
some distance up the river we found a few plants of Hesperis matronalis.
We next 
visited Rievaulx Abbey; I have not room here to expatiate on its beauties, or on those 
of the romantic valley (Bilsdale) at the southern extremity of which it is situated ; but 
I may mention that we gathered Rosa tomentosa growing nearly at the summit of the 
ruins of the choir.
We were now directed across the hills to Beckdale and Helmsley, 
but as we had no road to follow, we were many times at a loss which way to turn, and 
did not reach Helmsley until the evening.
But our walk was far from being uninte- 
resting : we passed along several fine and well-wooded valleys, and in one of them, 
called Dark Gill, we found Helleborus viridis and Actaea spicata growing together in 
great abundance.
This is certainly the wildest station for the former plant I ever 
saw, and I think no one who should see it growing there, could for a moment doubt 
its being truly indigenous to the soil : I know several other localities for Actaa, but 
all on either the coralline oolite or magnesian limestone.
Besides the two plants last 
mentioned, we observed here and there plants of Campanula latifolia, Pyrola minor, 
Paris quadrifolia and Crepis paludosa.
A little beyond this wood we saw on a hill- 
side a patch of Sambucus Ebulus, but not in flower; and in another wood we found 
quantities of Elymus europeeus and Melica nutans.
By the brook-side at the bottom 
of one of the valleys grew Myrrhis odorata.
After toiling up and down hill for a long 
time, we at last emerged into Beckdale, and commenced searching for Cypripedium 
Calceolus, which has been gathered there, but did not succeed in finding it.
In fact, 
to examine perfectly the tract of country which we this day only passed through, would 
require many days, and even weeks.
Beckdale extends quite to the town of Helms- 
ley, where we remained a short time for the sake of refreshment and rest, and then 
started again for Pickering.
Our road lay through a highly cultivated, and therefore 
(to us) uninteresting country; and passing through Kirby Moorside, Symington, &:c., 
we anived at Pickering about 10 o'clock P.M.
At 8 o'clock next morning we left Pickering by the Whitby railway for the Hole 
of Horcum.
The part of the railway traversed by us runs up a deep valley, through 
ground in general somewhat marshy, and two or three times crosses the brook which 
runs through Pickering.
As we went along we noticed the following plants; jEgopo- 
dium Podagraria, Serratula tinctoria, Myrica Gale, Carex vesicaria and riparia.
At 
Raindale (7 miles from Pickering) we left the railway, and turning to the right, pro- 
ceeded across the barren moors in the direction of the Hole of Horcum, which we 
reached after three or four miles of very rough walking, having gathered by the way 
Sphaerophoron coralloides (growing on large stones), and a few plants of Scyphophorus 
cocciferus.
The Hole of Horcum is " a singular basin-shaped hollow, suddenly and 
deeply excavated, in the Moorlands, through the calcareous grit and lower strata," and 
may be about four miles in circumference, measured on the ridges of the hills which 
bound it.
Here we expected to meet with Cornus suecica, but we unfortunately hap- 
pened to come u]) to " the Hole " at a point exactly opposite to its locality, and being 
104 
ignorant of this, we sought about in every place that we thought likely to produce the 
plant, without seeing anything like it, until about noon, when we arrived at a little 
house standing on the east side, under Saltergate Brow.
Here we called and procur- 
ed some refreshment, and on enquiring if our entertainers had ever observed anything 
like the plant, which we described to them, we learned that such a plant (called by 
them " honeysuckle ") had been sometimes come in search of by botanists.
The mis- 
tress of the house (a widow of the name of Smith) was the only person acquainted with 
the exact locality, and she chanced to be from home ; but her son-in-law recollected 
having heard her say that it grew on the hill-side adjoining the Whitby road, between 
two plantations, and to this place he volunteered to conduct us.
We gladly accepted 
his offer, and on coming to the spot were gratified by finding the beautiful little Cor- 
nus growing in great plenty, but so nearly out of flower that after a laborious search 
we only succeeded in procuring a dozen flowers each.
Its fruit does certainly consi- 
derably resemble that of the common honeysuckle, besides there being a close natural 
afiinity between the two plants, and hence no doubt arose the name we heard given to 
it.
Along with the Cornus were three other plants with nearly ripe fruit, viz., Empe- 
trum nigmm, Vaccinium Myrtillus and Vitis-Idea.
The other plants observed here 
were Habenaria chlorantha, Gymnadenia conopsea, Listera cordata and Crepis palu- 
dosa.
In our walk hence to Pickering (9 miles) we observed on an old wall near 
Lockton, AspleniumTrichomanes, Ruta-muraria and Adiantum-nigrum, and a variety 
of Cystopteris fragilis, growing in great abundance.
We also saw here and there, 
in stony places, Cerastium arvense.
On our return to Ganthorpe (15 miles) next day, our road lay principally through 
the vale of Pickering (Kimmeridge clay), where we gathered Festuca elatior and Rosa 
systyla near Kirby Misperton, and Nasturtium sylvestre at Newsham Bridge, where 
we crossed the Rye. Coming again upon the coralline oolite we found Anthemis ar-

I 
will only farther observe that although during our ramble we had collected many in- 
teresting plants, we were yet deeply sensible that for want of sufiicient time we had 
but imperfectly explored a country which undoubtedly contains many rarities hitherto 
unnoticed.

â€” A List of Plants met with in the neighbourhood of 
Swansea, Glamorganshire.
By J.
W. G.
Gutch, Esq.
The following must by no means be considered a complete Catalogue of the plants 
to be met with in the unusually rich locality presented by the neighbourhood of Swan- 
sea, but rather as the nucleus of a future Swansea Flora.
In the absence of such a 
work, the list is off'ered to the notice of botanists who may be visiting this portion of 
Glamorganshire, which they will find a district peculiarly rich in both land and ma- 
rine plants.
Several rarities have been detected there within the last two years, by 
my friend Mr. Ralfs, of Penzance, a most indefatigable and attentive botanical ob- 
server; and I have no doubt that many more, if carefully sought for, might be added 
lo the already copious list, as much ground, I feel convinced, yet remains unexplored.

Swansea can now boast of a Royal Institution for the cultivation and advancement of 
Science, at the head of which, as President, is L.
W. Dillwyn, Esq. The Institution 
already possesses a most extensive herbarium presented by Mr. Bicheno ; and I look 
forward with confidence to the time when a complete list of all the plants found in the 
neighbourhood, with a specimen of each species, will be deposited in the Institution : 
This would indeed be most interesting and acceptable to the botanist visiting Swan- 
sea, and would supply, in the best manner, the present want of a local Flora.
Ranunculus Flammula.

Found growing in the greatest luxuriance on Pennard Castle, where 
it was first noticed by the late Mr. Lucas, of Stouthall, who communicated his 
discovery to Dr. Coite of Ipswich ; and it was the fault of Dr. Coite, as he ad- 
mitted to me, that the merit of this interesting addition to the British Flora was 
not given to Mr. Lucas.
Mr. Lucas afterwards showed the plant to Dr. Tur- 
ton, and he sent the specimens to Mr. Sowerby which were figured in the ' Eng.

The various improvements manifest in the new edition have greatly enhanced the 
value of this Catalogue, both as a medium of communication and a manual for re- 
ference.
Not the least of these improvements we consider to be the change of form ; 
for instead of the unwieldy folio sheet, we now have a greater amount of information 
compressed into a neat octavo.
One grand feature of the new edition consists, how- 
ever, in numerous changes of nomenclature ; the names of the editors are a sufficient 
guarantee that these changes have not been lightly or unadvisedly made, and their 
reasons for making them will be seen in the following extract from the Preface.
" In 
drawing up the Second Edition of the Botanical Society's Catalogue, the compilers 
have been desirous, as far as possible, to make the nomenclature of British plants cor- 
respond with that adopted by the best continental writers.
In doing this, they have 
been forced to make many alterations, the importance of which will, it is hoped, be re- 
cognized by the members of the Society.
They have been guided in their amend- 
ments chiefly by the works of De Candolle, Koch, Nees von Esenbeck, Kunth and 
Leighton.
When the name of a genus or species has been changed, reference is made 
to the name under which it appears in the fourth edition of Sir AVm. Hooker's British 
Flora.
The sources whence new species are derived are indicated by reference to the 
works from which they are taken, and when they are still unpublished as British plants 
they are marked as additional species." 
The importance of following some uniform system of nomenclature cannot be dis- 
puted : and anticipating as we do, a very wide circulation for the Botanical Society's 
Catalogue, we would venture to suggest to our correspondents the expediency of their 
adopting it as a standard for names in drawing up local lists of plants.
We would 
even go so far as to recommend that the alphabetical arrangement of the Catalogue 
should also be strictly adhered to ; for we consider the systematic arrangement of spe- 
cies in a merely local list, to be a matter of minor importance.
The neutrality of the 
alphabetical arrangement, setting aside its convenience, will surely go far towards re- 
commending the Edinburgh Society's Catalogue as a model worthy of being adopted 
by botanists engaged in framing local lists of British plants, whether the Linnseau 
or the natural system may stand highest in their favour as the principle on which a 
general Flora ought to be arranged.
In comparing the enumerations of the plants in the two editions of the Catalogue, 
we observe that the new one contains a numerical preponderance over its predecessor, 
of 13 species and 90 varieties, and includes 24 species not contained in any other list 
of British plants.

Orders ; in ivliich the tivo Systems are combined hy reference to ' English Bota-

E. SowERBY, A.L.S. London : Sowerby, 3, Mead Place, Lambeth ; 
Longman cSc Co.; Simpkin & Co. Part 1, 12mo.
November, 1841.
We believe Great Britain to be the only country in the world which can boast of 
having its botanical treasures fully and ably illustrated by three successive generations 
of the same family.
The merit of designing and engraving the plates of this little work 
is due to a grandson of the late Mr. Sowerby ; and the style in which they are executed 
is another proof that no inconsiderable portion of the talent displayed in the productions 
of the first illustrator of ' English Botany,' is inherited by even the younger branches of 
his family.
Each part of the Catalogue will contain 8 plates, each plate comprising 
6 coloured figures ; the letter-press gives the scientific and English names of the spe- 
cies, their habitats, duration, and times of flowering ; together with references to the 
two editions of ' English Botany,' and to the well-known works of the authors enu- 
merated above.
The 48 figures in the first part are very prettily executed.
Instead 
of giving a figure of the wIloIc plant on a small and uniform scale, the artist has ju- 
diciously adopted the plan of drawing the upper portion of each species, with its flowers 
and foliage, and, without going minutely into details, has added such other parts as 
are absolutely necessary for specific distinction.
The figures are drawn as nearly of 
the natural size as the limits would allow, and are carefully and neatly coloured.
We have great pleasure in recommending this Catalogue to the notice of all who, 
at a moderate price, would possess a portable and useful series of illustrations of our 
native plants.

ish herbarium.
They may be had either in sheets, for the purpose of being cut out 
and attached to the papers containing the species, or made up in a neat 8vo.
volume, 
which can be used as an index to the collection.
The following extracts from the 
preface will more fully explain the plan of the work.
" The aim has been to condense into a small space as much information as possi- 
ble; â€” each label therefore contains the Natural Order, the Linnean Class and Order, 
the generic, specific, and common name of the plant for which it is intended, together 
with the synonyms of the botanists just named, [Smith, Hooker, Lindley and Mac- 
reight] : the principal habitat is also added (except in the case of the rarer plants, 
where localities are given instead), and a sufficient blank space is left for the insertion 
of the customary memoranda of time, place, and collector's name.
" As each plant has one or more labels assigned to it whenever the writers above- 
mentioned difi"er in their nomenclature, all will be able to select that of their favorite 
text-book, while the synonyms attached will show the arrangement adopted by the other 
three authorities, and thus, to the less advanced student, tend in some degree to in- 
crease the facilities of botanical intercourse."

Note on the Gemis Tilia.
There is, I think, a misapprehension on the part of 
the writer iu No. 5 of ' The Phytologist ' (p.
79), as to my remarks on the Lime.
The 
fact is, about two years ago I sent to the Botanical Society of London, a paper on the 
British species of the genns Tilia (lime-tree), which perhaps he heard read.
Since 
that time the Society have published no Transactions, and consequently my paper has 
not appeared, and I am not aware that any abstract of it was ever printed in the ' Ma- 
gazine of Natural History,' or elsewhere ; except that I also communicated to Mr.
Loudon, for his ' Arboretum Britannicum,' the fact of a large wood, of more than five 
hundred acres in extent, existing in Worcestershire, where, strange to say, the greater 
part of the undenvood, regularly cut down at stated intervals, consists of Tilia parvifo- 
lia : thus, I should say, removing any doubt, if any could exist, of the indigenousness 
of this tree, as far as England is concerned.
My paper, however, went to show that 
T. grandifolia was also indigenous, and that T.
europaea was to be included under T.
grandifolia as a form.
Numerous localities were named, and old individual trees ad- 
verted to.
I also descanted on the natural history of the lime, and contended (at least 
as far as that tree was concerned) that the honey-dew was really an exudation of its 
saccharine juices, and had nothing to do with the Aphides.
1 see a very interesting 
anecdote of Mr. Luxford's is opposed to me as respects another tree (Entomol.
No. 90) ; 
but the fact really is, that as in the old nursery tale of the shield that was gold on 
one side and silver on the other, so with the honey -dew.
In some cases the Aphides 
cause it, and in others, at a particular temperature, it exudes from the leaves without 
their agency.
The latter is certainly the case with the lime at any rate.

Veronica montana, (Phytol.
70).
This is always included in lists of rare plants, 
wherefore I cannot tell, unless that it is passed over for Ver. Chamaedrys, and conse- 
quently esteemed a treasure when accident brings it prominently before the notice of 
the botanist.
It grows plentifully in all the woods and shady dells and dingles in the 
neighbourhood of Bristol ; nor is it less frequent about Manchester, where I have seen 
it in every locality favourable to its taste for moisture and seclusion.
Mere Clough, 
Agecroft Clough, Boghart-hole Clough, Ouse-end Clough, &c., produce it in abun- 
dance.

Astrantia major.
This plant was, in 1840, discovered by Mr. Dl.
Sharpe in 
the wood above Stokesay Castle, Shropshire, " in plenty." Mr. Borrer this summer 
examined the wood, which is extensive, and found four large patches of it along the 
little-frequented path at the upper edge of the wood, and one a little off from the path, 
near one of the four.
It had every appearance of being quite wild, and the locality 
did not favour the idea of an accidental escape from cultivation.
Possibly, however, 
it may have been sown there ; and perhaps some of your correspondents may be able 
to clear up this doubt, as well as to inform us whether it occurs dispersedly over the 
wood.

Silene nutans.
In answer to your correspondent (Phytol.
91), I beg leave io 
state that to the best of my knowledge Silene nutans grew on Nottingham Castle-rock 
previously to the castle being burnt, sparingly, as it does at present ; but since that 
event in 1830, it has established itself on the walls, in the crevices between the stones 
and in fact in every place where it is possible for a plant to vegetate.

O. Stephens of Bristol presented thirty-three species of British

A paper was read from Mr. G.
H. K.
Thwaites, on Polystichum amleatum and Pol. lobatum.
The 
author observes that owing to the difference of opinion entertained respecting these ferns by botanists of ce- 
lebrity â€” some considering them two distinct species, and others that they are merely varieties of one â€” any 
facts tending to bring to light their real character must be interesting ; and therefore he has much gratifica- 
tion in making known a peculiarity of structure exhibited by each, whereby he considers all doubt as to their 
being distinct species will be removed.
The two ferns, in their typical form, differ very materially from each other; and their differences have 
been well described by those who have written on the subject.
But almost all, if not the whole of the char- 
acters which have been set down as distinctive, are liable to be so extremely modified by different degrees of 
altitude, moisture, light, exposure &c.
of situation, that an unpractised eye would often be quite unable to de- 
termine the species of these closely-allied plants, whence, questionless, has arisen the doubt as to their sepa- 
rate specific individuality.
Thus, Polystichum lobatum, upon an elevated situation, possesses a lanceolate 
frond, generally very close and compact ; its pinnae overlapping each other ; occasionally, however, these are 
distant from each other to almost the extent of their width, and the pinnulee are more separated, so that the 
plant much resembles P.
aculeatum.
But P.
lobatum, when gi-owing in a low situation, is still more like P.
aculeatum ; its fronds, instead of being lanceolate, inclining more to ovate, its pinnulee also are not merely 
serrated, but become slightly pinnatifld, indeed the plant can with difficulty be identified.
These facts, and 
several others which might be adduced, show the slight value, in this genus, of characters derived from the 
outline of the frond or of the pinnse and pinnulse, which are all so liable to vary in this particular: it was 
therefore very desirable to endeavour to find some more constant character by which these kindred species, if 
they proved species, might be distinguished one from the other ; and after many hours spent in diligent exa- 
mination of a gi-eat number of fronds, the author discovered a difference of venation in the two species, which 
he thus describes.
" In examining the fronds of P.
aculeatum, it may be noticed that the veins which bear thecae are not 
continued, like the rest of the veins, to the edge of the pinnulse, but each terminates either at its mass of the- 
cae, or at a very little distance beyond it.
The same thing is not observable in P.
lobatum (when mature), for 
the corresponding veins in this are each continued through its mass of thecae to the very edge of the pinnule, 
and even in the fronds of immatm-e plants of this species, when there is but little fructification, the same cha^ 
racter is perceptible in the pinnulae nearest the base of the pinnae and of the frond â€” the parts which in ferns 
exhibit most strikingly all the charactei-s of maturity : in a few of the terminal pinnulae some of these veins 
do not reach the edge.
It must not be concealed that in P.
aculeatum, in an extremely few instances (being 
just what might be expected) is a slight indication discoverable of a theciferous vein being continued to the

â€” A Botanical Excursion in Teesdale, in July, 1840.
By Samuel King, Esq.
Lane House, Luddenden, near Halifax, 
SiR^ October 20, 1841.
Taking it for granted that any communication respecting plants will be 
acceptable for your periodical, I take the liberty of sending a sbort account of a bota- 
nical excursion in Teesdale in July, 1840.
If you think it worth printing it is quite 
at your service.
Yours &c.
Samuel King.
To the Editor of ' The Phytologist.' 
On the 20th of July my companion and myself left Darlington for Barnard Cas- 
tle, a distance of sixteen miles.
The common hedge-plants of this neighbourhood are 
Ballota nigra, Lamium album, Bryonia dioica, Potentilla reptans and anserina, Cy- 
noglossum officinale, Lycopsis arvensis, Hordeum murinum, Conium maculatum.
Reseda luteola, Chaerophyllum temulentum.
Lychnis vespertina, &c.
We arrived at 
Barnard Castle about 11 o'clock, and proceeded to Cotherston (a distance of four 
miles), where we commenced our work by going up Balderdale in search of the rare 
Saxifraga Hirculus : as we went on we observed Cnicus heterophyllus, Ribes petrsum, 
Geranium sylvaticum, &c.
After walking about four miles we arrived at Hurry ; 
here we learned that a persou named Joseph Raine, who resided at a faim-house call- 
ed East Waybut, knew something about the plant we were in search of.
At about a 
mile farther on we came to the house and found the man, who readily undertook to 
conduct us to the spot where the Saxifraga was growing : he knew the plant well, and 
gave us two specimens which he happened to have by him.
When we had gone about 
two miles farther up the valley, which is wild and barren, we crossed the water and got 
on the edge of Cotherston Fell, about half a mile below the junction of the Black 
Beck and Balder Beck : here we found plenty of Saxifraga Hirculus growing among 
moss in a wet swampy place, in company with Sedum villosum, but being too early in 
the season, we could obtain but two plants in flower.
We then returned to the house 
of our guide, and wrote our addresses with a quill pen upwards of twenty years old ; 
in the following August our guide collected for me a number of specimens of the 
Saxifraga, and transmitted them by post.
On leaving our guide's house he directed 
us over the fells to Middleton in Teesdale, about six miles distant; but in consequence 
of losing our road on the fells, we did not arrive there until late.
Next morning, accompanied by Mr. Thompson, the landlord of the Talbot Inn, 
we started for High Force Inn, distant five miles, calling in our way at New Bigging.
Thence we passed over the fields to Winch Bridge, where the Tees is crossed by a 
foot bridge.
Here the troubled stream of the Tees is confined by rocks, upon which, 
and on the adjoining ground, grow Serratula tinctoria, Cnicus heterophyllus, Galium 
I 
114 
boreale, Rubiis saxatilis, Potentilla fruticosa, Melampyrum sylvaticum, Polygonxim 
viviparum, Plantago maritima, Geranium sylvaticum, Festuca vivipara, Primula fari- 
nosa, Pyrus Aria, Trollius europteus, Rosa Sabiiii and.
involuta, and some other species 
whicli require more examination in a growing state.
I do not find any record of this 
locality for the two roses here mentioned, which I discovered here, on the Yorkshire 
side of the Tees.
The latter is said to grow in the Hebrides and Western Highlands 
of Scotland, but as far as my knowledge extends, this is the first time of its having 
been gathered south of the Tweed.
One old plant was all that I found at the time, 
a sucker from which is now growing freely in my garden.
I am inclined to think that 
Rosa Doniana of Smith grows freely in the same place.
This spot is about a mile 
from High Force Inn. In the afternoon we visited High Force, which was an aw- 
fully grand sight, the river being much swollen by the heavy rains.
We here observ- 
ed plenty of Cnicus heterophyllus, Brachypodium pinnatum, &c.
The morning of July 22nd being fine, we set out, with Mr. Scott the landlord for 
our guide, he being well acquainted with the localities of all the rare plants of the 
neighbourhood.
We proceeded by way of Whey Syke, crossed Langdon Beck, and 
so on to Widdy Bank, where we gathered Bartsia alpina, Gentiana verna (in seed), 
Carex capillaris, Equisetum variegatum, Parnassia palustris, Tofieldia palustris, Sax- 
ifraga aizoides, Lycopodium Selaginoides, &c.
Widdy Bank being an extensive tract 
it will be necessary to say that the place where we gathered the above plants was the 
sloping bank of the Tees, in Widdy-Bank Farai.
From this spot we proceeded to 
Falcon Clinks ; here grow Lycopodium Selago, Cryptogramma crispa, Asplenium 
Trichomanes, viride and Ruta-muraria, Sedum Telephium, Vaccinium Vitis-idsea and 
Juniperus communis, in great abundance.
Here I cast around many an anxious look 
for Woodsia Ilvensis ; at length, after much searching, and a good wetting from the 
drip of the water from the huge basaltic rocks, to my great joy I espied two small 
plants, which were instantly secured ; a little farther on we saw three more under 
a bush of Prunus Padus, but not liking to destroy the plant, we left the roots of 
these in the crevice of the rock where they were growing.
After resting awhile under 
the Clinks, I had another round at searching for this wee fern, but without success, so 
I was obliged to leave the spot with an impression that one day or other it would 
be extinct there.
As we passed along I observed plenty of what I then called Asple- 
nium viride, but not wanting that plant I did not gather any, it now however strikes 
me forcibly that among this was Asplenium fontanum also.
A few hundred yards 
above the last-mentioned locality is Caldron Snout.
This is a place where the Tees, 
which above here runs on a level, now rushes with tremendous fury down among rocks 
for I should think not less than a hundred yards.
Over the Snout is a narrow wooden 
bridge, connecting the counties of Durham and Westmoreland, which we crossed, and 
in traversing the extreme point of the latter county, found Ajuga alpina?
Habenaria 
viridis, Gentiana campestris &c.
We then forded the swollen Maize Beck into York- 
shire, and obtained a fine view of the Snout.
Passing along we gathered Sedum villo- 
sum, Saxifraga hypnoides, Rubus Chamsmorus &c.
At length we reached the sum- 
mit of Cronkley Fell, and there we gathered Lycopodium alpinum, Dryas octopetala, 
Cistus marifolius and Helianthemum, Carex capillaris and pulicaris, Tofieldia palus- 
tris, Arenaria verna, Gentiana verna, Thalictrum alpinum, Anthyllis vulneraria, Aira 
cristata, Hippocrepis comosa.
Thymus Serpyllum, &c.
Pursuing our course towards 
Cronkley Bridge, we gathered Carex binervis, Avena pratensis and pubescens, and 
Habenaria viridis; we then recrossed the Tees to the Durham side, when our guide 
115 
left us, taking the nearest road home, and we went down the valley, where Potentilla 
fruticosa and other plants grow in abundance.
For more than a mile we were almost 
lost in juniper bushes, with the river on our right hand and high cliffs on our left : 
here we found Arbutus Uva-ursi.
When we again reached High Force we gathered 
Festuca vivipara andAvena alpina?
on the rocks; this is another place where the river 
falls twenty or thirty yards down the rocks, which are here, as in other parts of Tees- 
dale, gloriously painted with Lecidea geographica.
The next day we returned homewards, well laden with plants ; visited the lead- 
mines at Middleton, fourteen miles from Brough.
At Church-Brough Castle gathered 
Trifolium procumbens, Carduus acanthoides and Conium maculatum.
Here we had 
to wait five hours before the coach came up from Barnard Castle to take us to Kirby 
Lonsdale.
We had scarcely taken our seats when the horses started off without guard 
or coachman, and upset the coach on a bridge; I was so much injured as to be quite 
incapable of making further observations, and thus ended my botanical excursion in 
Teesdale.

â€” List of Plants collected by M.
Schimper in Abyssinia.
By N.
B. Ward, Esq.
Wellclose Square, October 20, 1841.
My dear Sir, 
Among the numerous collections of plants made by the Unio Itineraria, 
there are few that equal, and none that surpass in interest, the collection made by 
Schimper in Abyssinia.
The portion which has reached this country contains about 
300 species, mostly procured in the neighbourhood of Adowa; an enumeration of which 
I send you, as I think it will gratify the readers of ' The Phytologist.' 
I have marked with an * the few species which are also natives of Britain.
And am, 
My dear Sir, 
Your's very truly,

Besides Rosa canina and tomentosa, there are other wild 
roses in the neighbourhood, but I confess my inability to distinguish from each 
other many of the species which my friend has described, and I know not which, 
or whether either of them, is entitled to a place among the British rariores.

Art. XLIV- â€” Notices of Books 8fc.
connected with British Botany.
1. A Manual of the British Algce : containing Generic and Specific Descriptions of 
all the known British Species of Sea-Weeds and of Confervas, both Marine and 
Fresh-water.
By The Hon. William Henry Harvey.
London : Van 
Voorst.
1841.
8vo.
The beautiful family of plants known by the popular name of sea-weeds, has long 
excited the admiration not only of the mere sea-side rambler, but of many profound 
botanists.
The names of Esper, Lamouroux, Mortens, Agardh, Lyngbye, Kiitzing 
and others on the continent; and of Stacthouse, Turner, Dillwyn, Hutchins, Griffiths, 
Berkeley, Greville and Harvey in our own country ; are especially associated with 
these plants.
It is, however, only within the present century that the algological Flo- 
ra can be said to have assumed a strictly systematic form.
The structure and affinities 
of the Algffi have, within this period, been carefully examined, their economy investi- 
gated, and their geographical position ascertained.
The four great genera â€” Tremella, 
Fucus, Ulva and Conferva, into which Linnaus divided the comparatively few species 
he was acquainted with, have expanded, in the British Flora alone, into 127 for the 
most part well-defined genera ; and a rigid analysis is at length applied to these as 
well as to other plants.
In Great Britain, as might have been expected from the fa- 
cilities which her shores present to the student, several works of standard merit have 
been devoted to their illustration.
'English Botany' contains figures (deficient in de- 
tails) of all the species known at the time of its publication.
The splendid ' Historia 
Fucorum ' of Turner includes all the British species formerly described under the hete- 
rogeneous genus Fucus ; and Dillwyn's ' Synopsis of the British Confervae ' contains 
illustrations of the equally heterogeneous Conferva; while in the 'Algae Britannicae' 
of Greville are given figures and analyses of the modern genera of the inarticulate 
tribes.
Various species are also represented in the same author's ' Cryptogamic Flora;' 
and lastly, in point of time, Berkeley's ' Gleanings' illustrate many others belonging 
to the more minute and difficult groups, It was not, however, until the publication 
of the second volume of the ' British Flora' in 1833, that the whole of the British Al- 
gffi were brought together and described with methodical accuracy by Mr. Harvey, 
with the exception alone of the Diatomaces, which were contributed by Dr. Greville.
Three years subsequently, the entire algological department of the ' Flora Hibernica ' 
was executed in a most able manner by Mr. Harvey, and particular attention bestowed 
on some of the difficult genera, especially Callithamnion and Polysiphonia.
One 
other work of eminent utility remains to be mentioned â€” the ' Algs Danmouienses ' of 
Mrs. Wyatt (under the superintendance of Mrs. Griffiths), on the plan of that beauti- 
ful collection, ' Algues de la Nonuandie, par J.
Chauvin ' ; but of this publication, as 
well as of his views regarding the work immediately under consideration, we shall let 
our estimable author speak for himself.
" The want of a work in the English language, entirely devoted to the British Algae, 
in which fuller descriptions should be given than the scope of Hooker's ' British Flora' 
admitted of, and in which all the known species should be included, has long been 
felt by lovers of this branch of Botany.
Had my friend Dr. Greville completed, as 
was once his intention, his admirable ' Algee Britannicse,' no room would have been 
left for ray humble labours, nor should I for a moment wish to take the subject out of 
such able hands.
But his work has unfortunately stopped short with the " inarticu- 
123 
late " tribes, nor has he at present any intention of resuming it.
The task has conse- 
quently fallen on my shoulders, and my object will be gained and my ambition fully 
satisfied, if, in the following pages, I have succeeded in affording any assistance to 
the researches of my fellow-students.
I could have wished, and indeed had intended, 
that the work should be illustrated with figures, at least of the genera ; but my limited 
stay in Europe did not afford time to prepare them, and it does not now appear desirable 
to delay the publication till they could be got ready.
However they might have added 
to the beauty of the book, the student will experience little loss by their omission, who 
takes this Manual for what I wish it to be, a companion to the ' Algse Danmonienses, 
published and sold by Mary Wyatt, Dealer in Shells, Torquay; ' a most important work, 
now extending to four volumes, with a supplement, composed of specimens of 234 spe- 
cies, beautifully dried and correctly named.
These volumes furnish the student with 
a help, such as no figures, however correctly executed, can at all equal, â€” nature's own 
pencil illustrating herself." 
Of this ' Manual ' we do not think it too much to say, that Mr. Harvey alone, 
among British botanists, was prepared to undertake it.
For many years the Algee, as 
we have seen, were his peculiar favourites, and he had carefully studied those groups 
which had been most imperfectly described by other authors.* His volume contains 
an ample Introduction, in which he considers the structure, habits and uses of these 
plants ; and the descriptive portion is preceded by a Synopsis of the Families and 
Genera.
The general an-angement is that proposed by the author in the 'Flora Hibernica;' 
the families being primarily grouped under four series, as follows ; the first three be- 
ing chiefly characterized, as their names indicate, by the colour of their seeds.
Series T.
Melanospermes, contains the families Fucoideas, Lichineas, Lamina- 
rieae, Sporochnoideae, Dictyoteae, Ectocarpeae, Chordarieae.
Series II.
RhodospermejE.
â€” Gloiocladeae, Gastrocarpeae, Spongiocarpeae, Fur- 
cellarieae, Florideae, Ceramieae.
Series III.
CHLOROsPERMEiE.
â€” Lemaniea?, Batrachospermeae, Chaetophoroideas, 
ConferveEe, Siphoneae, Oscillatorieas, Ulvaceae, Nostochinae, Byssoideae ?
Series IV.
Diatomace^.
â€” Desmidieae, Fragillarieae, Styllarieae, Cymbelleae.
It will be observed that Mr. Harvey has altogether done away with the old method by 
which the Algas were primarily disposed according to the articulate or inarticulate cha- 
racter of the frond.
This is surely a great improvement, as many fonns occur whi ch ^ 
are strictly intermediate, by uniting both characters in the same individual.
We observe under Sporochnoideae that Striaria Grevilliana of Pollexfen is reduced 
to a variety of Sporochnus rhizodes.
This very singular plant we have ourselves ex- 
amined, and are not prepared to question the decision at which the author has arrived; 
but the examination has led us to the conclusion that Sp. rhizodes itself might with 
propriety be placed in the genus Striaria, the character being slightly modified.
A 
new species of Ectocarpus is described, which was discovered at Ballycastle by Miss 
Hincks ; besides Ect. fasciculatus and pusillus, for the first time made known in the J 
'Algae Danmonienses.' 
*Mr. Harvey's algological researches have not been confined to the British Flora.
Vide his ' Genera of South African Plants,' and various papers in botanical periodicals.
124 
The genus Naccaria, Endl.
(Chsetospora, Ag.), placed among the Ceramiese by 
Agardh, and among the Fk)rideffi by Gieville, is brought under the Gloiocladese of 
Harvey.
The author observes that the " habit is completely that of Gloiosiphonia and 
Mesogloia.
The membrane, too, of the periphery, is formed of exceedingly minute, 
longitudinal fibres, cohering together.
May not Naccaria therefore be regarded as a 
Mesogloia, wanting the verticillate filaments, except in the ramuli ?
" Our readers 
will recognise this plant as the rare Fucus Wiggii of Turner.
A plant of considerable interest, and which has been the occasion of a good deal 
of epistolary controversy, we find raised at length to the rank of a species.
The Alga 
we allude to is Fucus alatus, y.
of Turner, (Delesseria alata, i3.
angustissima, ' Brit.
Flor.').
It has been named Gelidium ?
rostratum by Mrs. Griffiths, and is assuredly 
quite distinct from Delesseria alata.
We believe that all the mistakes which have 
arisen with respect to this subject, have been caused by very narrow varieties of Del.
alata having been mixed with, or distributed instead of the true plant.
It is remark- 
able that although found in considerable abundance in Morayshire, by Mr. Brodie, 
upwards of thirty years ago, it has never been collected by any other botanist.
We have already observed that Mr. Harvey is known to have investigated the Ce- 
ramiese with great care ; and we find abundant evidence of this in the work before us.
It would be impossible to notice the many corrections which his observant and accu- 
rate eye has led him to make in this difiiuult family.
We are truly glad to find that 
he has united Polysiphonia Agardhiana, badia and denudata with Pol. atrorubescens.
Pol. Lyngbyaei, Harv.
in ' Brit.
Fl.' turns out to be a new species, and is now named 
P. Grevillii.
We have also a new species named P.
Griffithsiana, and two Irish ones 
named by their discoverer, Mr. Moore, P.
affinis and atro-purpurea.
The most interestmg addition, however, to the British Flora in the whole volume, 
is the exquisitely beautiful Thorea ramosissima, no native specimens of which exist, 
we believe, in any herbarium.
But the late Mr. Templeton has left a note of its hav- 
ing been discovered " in a pool in a bog in the Co. Donegal mountains, going from 
Letterkenny to Dumfanaghy." The plant is too remarkable, and Mr. Templeton's 
accuracy too well known, to admit of any doubt in regard to it.
We shall not dwell upon the Chlorospermeae and the DiatomacejE, more than to 
bear our cordial testimony to the care which has been bestowed upon them.
These 
series contain the more obscure families, and doubtless much remains to be done for 
their farther elucidation.
In the genus Conferva itself, as it now stands, characters 
will, we feel assured, be detected, for affording generic subdivision.
It is in this part 
of the work that we feel the want of pictorial illustration ; and we trust that when Mr.
Harvey shall be called upon for another edition, he will be enabled to add those plates 
which we know he was most anxious should accompany his excellent Manual.
It is 
indeed a work which must immediately become the text-book of every student of our 
marine Botany.
2. Collectanea for a Flora of Moray : or, a List of the Phomogamous Plants and 
Ferns hitherto found within the Province.
Elgin : printed by Alex.
Russell, 
Courant Office.
1839.
We are always disposed to give a hearty welcome to a local Flora, whatever may 
be the district to which it relates ; but the present work possesses peculiar claims to 
125 
our kindest regard, for independently of the value of the Collectanea in a botanical 
point of view, they possess additional interest in our eyes from the circumstance that 
in almost every page we meet with the names of localities, ouce honoured with the 
presence of Scotland's Burns, and immortalized by the genius of our own Shakspeare.
Sir J.
E. Smith, in his ' Tour on the Continent,' has remarked that " a plant ga- 
thered in a celebrated or delightful spot, is, like the hair of a friend, more dear to me- 
mory than even a portrait, because it excites the mind without presuming to fill it.
" 
The truth of this observation will, we think, be acknowledged by all who have been in 
the habit of seeking the botanical productions of any country, in their own peculiar 
habitats; and the remark applies even to the more common and less beautiful plants 
of a district, as well as to localities with no particular historical or poetical associations 
attached to them.
But with how much deeper interest would such a plant as Alche- 
milla alpina be invested, if gathered at " the Fall of Foyers," perhaps on the very spot 
where Burns stood when he wrote in pencil the beautiful lines beginning â€” "Among 
the heathy hills and ragged woods " !
Again, the pleasure of botanizing in the woods 
of Cawdor and Gordon Castles, and of collecting there Pyrola media and secunda or 
Circaea alpina, must surely be heightened by the remembrance that Burns himself had 
wandered in these very woods, since he tells us that he " crossed the country to Fort 
George, but called by the way at Cawdor, the ancient seat of Macbeth ; there I saw 
the identical bed in which, tradition says.
King Duncan was murdered;" â€” and that 
his well-known verses â€” " Streams that glide in orient plains," &c., were written when 
reluctantly relinquishing the kirfdness and hospitality of the noble owners of " Bon- 
nie Castle Gordon." Then again, Brodie House and its Laird being so frequently 
mentioned in the Collectanea, we cannot fail to remember that Burns slept at Bro- 
die House; and that we read in his journal â€” "Mr. Brodie tells me the muir where 
Shakspeare lays Macbeth's witch-meeting, is still haunted â€” that the country folks 
won't pass by night." This inuir we presume to be "The ' Blasted Heath,' near Bro- 
die;" if so, the midnight revels of Shakspeare's gay old ladies seem to have scared 
away all the country plants as well as counti'y /o/A-s, for we find but one recorded as 
growing there â€” Orobus tuberosus, var.
tenuijolius.
Others of the Macbeth localities 
are also very frequently mentioned, as, for instance, Forres and its castle-hill ; but 
we must leave poetry and poetical associations, and endeavour to give our readers 
some idea of the botanical contents of the work before us.
We are quite of opinion that if the rules laid down in Mr. Watson's excellent 
" Observations on the Construction of a Local Flora " (' Mag. of Zool.
and Bot.' i.
424) were generally known and strictly adhered to, the scientific value of local Floras 
and lists of plants would be greatly enhanced, inasmuch as a greater degree of preci- 
sion being followed in the compilation of such works, increased confidence in their 
accuracy would be felt on the part of those who have occasion to consult them.
Act- 
ing therefore on this opinion, we think we cannot do better than to transfer these 
rules to our own pages, both with the view of bringing them more immediately under 
the notice of our readers, and also to exhibit from the Collectanea some examples 
of the practical application of the spirit of the rules.
We must however premise 
that the work is not, strictly speaking, a local Flora, but simply such a carefully exe- 
cuted list of plants as we should be glad to see drawn up for every botanical district 
in the kingdom ; by the circulation of which, as the compiler observes in the Preface, 
" among those who take an interest in the Botany of the North of Scotland, it is in- 
tended to show the result of inquiries hitherto made within the Province of Moray, and 
126 
to afford a nucleus arouud which future discoveries and observations may be collected." 
Rule "First, a local Flora, we take it, ought to relate to a definite area, and not 
pretend to include a wider space than has been really and well investigated." â€” (Mag.
Zool.
& Bot. i.
426).
" Secondly, we should have a full list of species and the more remarkable varieties; 
the nomenclature being adapted to that of the standard Floras which relate to Britain 
generally; generic and specific characters, descriptions and references being altogether 
omitted."â€” (Id.) 
" Thirdly, we should desire to see the degree of scarcity or abundance of each spe- 
cies mentioned, in as close an accordance as possible with some fixed scale." â€” (Id. 427).
" Fourthly, the time of flowering, and the soil and situation affected by each spe- 
cies, should be given from actual observation." â€” (Id.) 
" Fifthly, the general distribution of each species, and the localities of the rarer 
ones, are to be precisely shown." â€” (Id. 428).
" Sixthly, we should recommend the history of the species to be attended to." â€” (Id).
We will now illustrate these rules by examples from the ' Collectanea, ' beginning 
with the first.
After describing the boundary lines of " The Province of Moray, or more strictly, 
the portion of Scotland kept in view while drawing up this List," the compiler pro- 
ceeds, â€” " In extent and locality the district here selected very nearly corresponds to the 
" Elgin, or Eighth Botanical District of Scotland " as laid down and illustrated in a 
valuable paper lately read by Mr. Brand before the Edinburgh Botanical Society.
In 
a district so extensive as this, and so little explored (particularly in the southern and 
western portions) there must be plants yet to be discovered, and many facts to be re- 
corded regarding the distribution of those already met with.
The most effectual me- 
thod by which these objects could be accomplished, would be to institute separate and 
careful examinations of the several sections â€” such as parishes and other well-defined 
districts â€” into which the Province might be divided.
And for this purpose this List, 
if interleaved, it is hoped will prove highly useful." â€” Preface, iii.
That the conditions of the second, third and fifth rules have been as far as possible 
complied with, will be evident from the following observations and extracts.
The ca- 
talogue contains neither generic nor specific descriptions nor references, but gives the 
scientific names and localities of all the species discovered within the district, up to 
the time of publication.
"There are 724 species in the Catalogue of Moray Plants, of which 65 are marked 
(?) as doubtfully â€¢native, and 70 {X) as certainly introduced.
Dicotyl.
Monocotyl.
Acetyl.

30.
" Sir W.
J. Hooker's ' British Flora,' 4th edition, is followed in the nomenclature 
and arrangement of the Collectanea.
The signs used [to denote the comparative rari- 
ty and abundance of the species ivithin the district'] are those employed by the Edin- 
burgh Botanical Society, [in the 1st edition of their Catalogue].
After these signs 
the provincial names are added to some of the more common plants.
Localities are 
occasionally given for species which are very far from being rare ; but where 'â–  &c." is 
not added, all the known stations are almost invariably inserted.
The dates of disco- 
very are stated in many instances ; and, when no other authority is quoted, the com- 
piler himself has found or gathered the plant, in the specified localities." â€” Pref.
v. 
127 
This perhaps is the proper place to notice one feature of the Collectanea, hy which 
its value to all who feel an interest in the geographical distribution of British plants 
is greatly increased.
" At the foot of the page, and under a line, a (ew species are in- 
troduced as being, from their ascertained range in Britain, likely to form early addi- 
tions to the Flora of Moray.
It is on this account, and with the view of noting their 
localities in the adjoining districts, that they have been placed here.
A comparison, 
however, of Lists T.
and II.
will show the plants, which are most probably undisco- 
vered denizens, as they contain the species found on either side, but not yet within the 
Province." â€” Pref.
v. The lists referred to are : â€” 
" I.
â€” List of Plants, not nbserned in Moray, but found in Aberdeenshire, or in the 
eastern part of Banffshire." This List contains 89 species.
" II.
â€” List of Plants not observed in Moral/, but found on the west side of Scotland 
and north of Oban and lona, or in the counties north of the Caledonian Canal." Con- 
taining 69 species, 17 of which are common to both lists.
Two other lists are also 
given ; one of QQ species, not uncommon within sixteen miles of Edinburgh, but either 
not observed or very rare in Moray ; and the other of 42 species of Moray plants which 
are not found within sixteen miles of Edinburgh.
With regard to the fourth rule, the omission of the times of flowering is perhaps 
of little importance, although they would have formed an interesting addition to the 
Collectanea ; but we confess that we should have been glad to see some notice of the 
geological relations of the species growing in the district.
On this subject the com- 
piler observes : â€” 
" In such a treatise as this, it is usual to give a sketch of the geological structure 
of the district.
Such would have been attempted, had there been a sufl5cient number 
of facts ascertained to show that there was here really any connexion between the ve- 
getation and the underlying formations.
The distance from the shore, and the ele- 
vation above the sea level, seem to influence the distribution of the species far more 
than the mineralogical character of the strata over which they grow.
Besides, through- 
out the Province generally, and especially in the lower part of it, there is such a vast 
accumulation of alluvial matter interposed between the rock and soil, that the nature 
of the latter and of its vegetation depends mainly upon the circumstance of the allu- 
vial deposits or subsoil being mossy, gravelly or clayey.
In a few spots within the 
Province, such as Craighalkie near Tomintoul, where the beds of limestone, subordi- 
nate to the primary stratified fonnations, crop out, there are occasionally to be found 
several species of plants, whose range is evidently circumscribed within the influence 
of the calcareous soil.
Avena jwatensis seems confined to soils of this nature, changing 
its habit as the proportion of their ingredients diff'ers.
Where there is a superab\m- 
dance of limy matter the plant often assumes a glaucous and rigid appearance, which 
has probably originated the A.
alpina, and causes it still to hold a place as a distinct 
species." â€” Pref.
iv.
In the above extract there is much to confinn our own views respecting the geolo- 
gical distribution of plants.
We are of opinion that it is by the surface soil in which 
they grow that plants are aff'ected, and not by the rocks or strata ovei- which they occur, 
unless the latter happen to lie so near the surface as to aff'ect the surface soil, by altering 
its constituent parts or modifying their proportions.
We have no doubt that elevation 
has considerable influence in the distribution of species ; but we cannot help suspecting 
that the character of the soil of a given district exercises quite as powerful an influence.
Avena pratensis and alpina mentioned above, confirm the truth of our position.
These 
128 
two plants, whether distinct species or merely different states of the same species, are 
confined to a calcareous soil, yet each has its own favourite modification of such a soil , 
and neither of them seems to occur except where the subordinate beds of limestone 
crop out.
But our limits prevent our pursuing this interesting enquiry any farther at 
present.
The subject recommended to he attended to in the sixth rule is an exceedingly im- 
portant one, and in one of its divisions â€” that relating to variations caused by change 
of situation or season, closely connected with the fourth.
We however could not ex- 
pect any infonnation of this nature in a catalogue, whilst a local Flora would scarcely 
he complete without it.
A " Table of Altitudes within or on the borders of the Province of Moray," and 
extracts from meteorological journals kept at Elgin and Kingussie, nearly the most dis- 
tant points of the Province, are very valuable additions to the Collectanea.
The al- 
titudes vary from 54 to 4390 feet.
A comparison of the annual means of three years' 
observations of the thermometer and rain-gauge, at the two stations, exhibits a higher 
mean temperature by 2-8212 at Elgin than at Kingussie; the mean depth of rain at 
Kingussie exceeds that at Elgin by 6-860 inches.
In a recent number (Phytol.
94) was a notice of Professor Balfour's discovery of 
Monotropa Hypopitys within this province ; and in our present number are some fur- 
ther remarks on this interesting addition to the Scottish Phsenogamic Flora.
We must now take leave of the ' Collectanea for a Flora of Moray;' and in so do- 
ing would again express a hope that the Botany of every district in the kingdom may 
ere long be equally well illustrated.

Remarks on British Carices.
In my last note (Phytol.
77) I made no enqui- 
ry as to how far the Carices in question are distinct as species ; but it having been 
said (Id. 27) that there are figures of the fruit and its appendages of all the British 
Carices, if these Carices be British, we should certainly expect to find them there.
Of 
Carex stictocarpa and angustifolia Hooker tells us he knows nothing, except what is 
said in Smith's ' English Flora ; ' and if Smith be correct in his descriptions, and I 
have no reason to believe otherwise, Carex stictocarpa is a very different plant from C.
recurva.
Of the latter I possess 79 varieties, and none of them will at all answer to 
the description given in ' English Flora ' or the figure in ' English Botany.' What 
Hudson's Carex recurva might be I know not, but I consider C.
angustifolia quite as 
distinct from ceespitosa as either C.
stricta, aquatilis or acuta, although Hooker, in the 
] st edition of his ' British Flora,' placed acuta in quite another division of his Carices.
If Sir W.
J. Hooker had ever seen Schkuhr's beautiful figure of C.
tenella, I think he 
would never have said " May it not be a starved state of" C.
remota.
The two sta- 
mens of C.
tenella I consider to be alone sufficient to keep it distinct as a species, to say 
nothing of its very smooth fruit, which is said to be convex on each side, with an entire 
beak.
A fruit like this is very much at variance with Mr. Leighton's description of 
Carex remota, wherein he says, â€” the fruit is " plano-convex, ribbed, margins rough, 
orifice bifid." â€” (Flor.
Shrop.
452).
Mr. Leighton further says, speaking of the convex 
side of the fruit, " with a cord-like mass of ribs which proceed downwards from the hi- 
129 
fid orifice to a little above the middle, where it diverges into five ribs, which agaia 
converge and unite a little above the base." Now I am at a loss to know how any one 
could ever think that the starving of a plant would make all these changes of charac- 
ter ; â€” to make the five-ribbed fruit of Carex remota become very smooth, and to turn 
plano-convex into one that is convex on both sides, and lastly its bifid orifice into one 
that is entire; not to say anything about the number of stamens, which, in the days 
of Linnaeus, would almost have removed it into some other class.
Of Carex Mielicho- 
feri I know nothing, except from the figure in ' English Botany, ' and what is said by 
Smith in 'English Flora;' but of Carex speirostachya I possess specimens from Wales 
and others from near Lancaster.
The plant is certainly a very difi'erent one from C.
fulva, and a section of the ripe nut of C.
speirostachya would have been very conspi- 
cuous amongst Mr. Leighton's figures of those parts.
Among the strange forms that 
I have gathered this season, I see there is Carex Ecklonii, Kunze, ' Supplement zu 
Schkuhr's Riedgrazer (Carices), tab.
5; but how far this is distinct as a species, I will 
leave to the judgment of others.
In the last edition of the 'British Flora,' Carex spei- 
rostachya is referred as a variety to the C.
fulva of Goodenough.
Goodenough tells 
lis that his C.
fulva is only a variety of C.
flava; Leighton tells us that C.
flava and 
Gi)deri are the same; and if I add the C.
Ecklonii of Kunze to the list, we shall see 
that it will take Carex speirostachya, fulva, flava, CEderi and Ecklonii to make Carex 
flava : now I should think, for my own part, that these are sufficient to make one spe- 
cies, if not, we may add the Trasus Hostianus of Gray, &c.

liemarhs on the List of Plants, (Phytol.

I embrace this opportunity of 
making a few remarks on the list of species and varieties said to be new to the British 
Flora, and described in Leighton's ' Flora of Shropshire.' For my own part I find 
(with the exception of the Rubi) very little that is new in this list; for surely we cannot 
consider such plants as Oxalis Acetosella ^.
purpurea new to the British Flora, since 
we find it mentioned in the fifth edition of Withering's Botany, as growing in a lane 
between North Owram and Halifax ; but that locality has long been destroyed ; the 
plant however was rediscovered about six years since by Mr. Riley of Halifax, about 
a mile from the place mentioned by Withering.
Next we find the plant mentioned 
by Gray in his work, at page 631, where he says â€” "plant small, rather villous, petals 
bluish-purple." Again we find in Smith's ' English Flora,' at page 323, flore purpu- 
reo, Dill, in Rail Syn. 281.
Ranunculus fluitans and tripartitus, we received descrip- 
tions of twenty-one years ago in Gray's Botany.
The Hypericum tetrapterum of 
Leighton is Hypericum quadrangulum of Smith, &c., so that we have nothing new in 
that except the name; Hypericum maculatum I have not been able to find in Mr.
Leighton's work.

Avena alpina, (Phytok 75).
In reply to Mr. Simpson's note on Avena alpina, 
I would say that the plant was known to Mr. Baines as having been found in the 
county, as I gathered the plant, in company with Mr. Baines, in June, 1836, about 
two miles from Tadcaster.
The reason of its not appearing in the Yorkshire Flora is 
that we do not consider it distinct as a species from Avena pratensis, as we have exa- 
mined numerous specimens, and find none of the characters that are laid down by 
Hooker to be constant.
The plant I believe to be a very common one, as I received 
specimens last season from Buxton in Derbyshire, and from Wales; I also received 
specimens from the Yorkshire side of Teesdale.
In addition to the above localities, I 
have a specimen of Avena alpina which I gathered near Settle in 1838.
In order to 
L 
130 
show that Mr. Baines and myself are not alone in considering Avena alpina and pra- 
tensis to be the same species, I copy the following from a note that I received from 
Mr. Tatham a short time ago.
" Dost thou think there is any real difference between 
Avena pratensis and alpina ?
If the panicle being compound or simple is any distinc- 
tion, we have them both, but I think they are one and the same." Mr. Tatham fur- 
ther says in a note dated September 9, 1841, " I do not think the roughness or smooth- 
ness of the sheaths of Avena alpina is at all to be depended on, for I have seen both 
extremes in the same tuft." â€” Id.
83.
Sedum rupestre, (Phytol.
68).
Your correspondent says " no doubt introduced 
originally." Why he should suppose so I know not.
The plant is by no means local 
in its distribution upon the rocks, and frequently occurs in the most inaccessible parts.
â€” Leo. H.
Grindon ; Manchester, October 20, 1841.
84.
Habenaria chlorantha, (Id. 70).
The species which I have always considered 
to be the bifolia, is very common in woods and shady places about Bristol.
Near But- 
combe, Somersetshire, as well as at Horfield and Stapleton, it grows in most luxuriant 
profusion.
The chlorantha I have seen but once, viz.
under Cook's Folly â€” one of the 
localities quoted for it.
Does it really deserve to rank higher than as a variety of H.
bifolia ?
â€” Id.
85.
Anagallis cm'ulea, (Id. 76).
I thought botanists were long since agreed as to 
this plant being only a variety of A.
arvensis.
It grows in cornfields upon the lias at 
Knowle and Horfield, near Bristol, and ouIt/ on the lias, never appearing elsewhere 
with blue flowers, or retaining its colour when sown in ordinaiy garden soil, as I have 
myself proved.â€” ZtZ.
86.
Equisetum fiuviatile.
I gathered a curious variety of this plant in August, 
1841, on the bank of the Manchester and Sheffield railway, near Glossip.
This spe- 
cimen was leafy and in good fruit ; the catkin was topped by a prolongation of the 
frond about twelve inches in length.
Mr. Francis, in his ' History of British Ferns,' 
mentions a similar specimen having been gathered near Bangor, in 1836, â€” Joseph 
Sidebotham ; Manchester, November 4, 1841.

Plants observed in the Neighbourhood of Shoreham, Stissex.
During the early 
part of July, 1838, my brother and myself spent some days at Shoreham, on the coast 
of Sussex, principally with the view of collecting a few plants from that locality.
Amongst the great mass of shingle thrown up by the sea, we found Vicia lutea very 
abundant.
Galeopsis Ladanum, specimens very small, scarcely exceeding 6 inches in 
height.
Glaucium luteum, abundantly displaying its large bright yellow flowers to 
the saline breeze.
A few solitary plants of Crambe maritima (which had not flowered 
that season) between the pier-head and the preventive station ; and in the same loca- 
lity we observed a few patches of Crithmum maritimum, just coming into flower.
Se- 
dum anglicum, plentiful, displaying its beautiful white starry flowers out of reach of 
the shingle ; as was also the case with Statice Armeria, Frankenia laevis, Arenaria ma- 
rina and Ervum hirsutum.
Ruppia maritima, very plentiful in the small pools of salt 
water in the marshes adjoining, (towards Worthing); and on their margins Triglochin 
maritimum, CEnanthe pimpinelloides, Glaux maritima and Juncus acutus, and where 
the tide flows over, Salicornia herbacea and Atriplex portulacoides, very abundant.
At the harbour's mouth, against the piers, we found a few plants of Cakile maritima 
and Statice spathulata.
Centaurea Calcitrapa abundant.
Linum angustifolium very 
abundant at the foot of the cliff's towards Brighton, near Kingston.
RottboUia incur- 
vata, on the sands just above h'gh-water mark.
Cheuopodium maritimum and Silene 
131 
marltima everywhere.
Coronopus didyma, in various places by the road sides.
Al- 
though we very carefully examined the whole line of beach between Brighton and 
Worthing, we could not find a single specimen of Trifolium stellatum : the only ha- 
bitat, as stated in the 'Botanist's Guide' &c.
is "between the sea and Shoreham Har- 
bour in the gi'eatest profusion," and supposed to have been originally introduced in 
ballast.
I should very much wish to know if any specimens have been taken from this 
station of late years.
I have specimens in my herbarium from this locality, collected 
upwards of thirty years ago ; the great alterations that have taken place at the en- 
trance of the harbour, by the erection of piers &c., have in all probability destroyed the 
habitat.
On our return from Shoreham we observed Sambucus Ebulus very plenti- 
fully but not in flower, by the sides of the road, against the toll-gate at Bramber and 
in the fosse at the foot of the old castle.
Iris foetidissima, very plentiful and in full 
flower.

Ci/perus longus in the Isle of Wight.
It will, I have no doubt, interest the 
readers of ' The Phytologist ' to know that I have detected " the tall and graceful Cy- 
perus," as my friend the Rev. G.
E. Smith very justly calls it, in three distant locali- 
ties within the island.
In two of the above stations it is abundant ; in the third, a wet 
meadow below Carisbrook Castle, on the S.E. side, very rare, a specimen or two only 
having been gathered.
I first detected Cyperus longus, which I had always calculated 
on eventually finding with us, quite accidentally, in a low meadow at Apes Down,* 
between Carisbrooke and Swainston, the seat of Sir Richard Simeon, Bart., on whose 
land it grows, and within a mile of the house on the Carisbrooke road, at the bottom 
of a steep pitch, the meadow being on the right coming from Carisbrooke, and nearly 
opposite a small farm.
This was in 1839, and the next year I found the plant in still 
greater quantity, covering at least half an acre, in a marshy meadow through which 
runs a little stream, between the new lighthouse at St. Catherine's Point, and empties 
itself into the sea at Old Castle Point by Puckaster, the station being much nearer the 
latter, and below the farm of Little Buddie, by which there is a path that conducts 
almost to the spot, within ten minutes walk of the Sand-rock Hotel.
The Cyperus 
begins to flower about the middle of August, but is in its greatest perfection a month 
later, after which it is usually mown down by the occupier of the land, as green fod- 
der for his cattle, to which this plant, from its sweetness, is very acceptable.

Note on Tamarix gallica, (Phytol.
91).
Pulteney long since gave Freshwater 
Gate as a habitat [for this plant], but I could never find it there, except as a cultiva- 
ted tree, by the hotel, a condition which, of course, excludes it entirely from notice 
amongst our indigenous productions.
As far as my own observation goes, the genus 
Tamaiix should be expunged, with Staphylea and some others, from the British Flo- 
ra, since I cannot ascertain that it is even naturalized, strictly speaking, in any of its 
recorded stations.
At Hastings it certainly does not grow spontaneously, though sta- 
ted to do so by Goodenough, and it has but too evidently been planted at St. Michael's 
Mount and other places in Cornwall, as well as at Languard Fort, and in every other 
spot where I have had an opportunity of seeing it.

Flora of the Isle of Wiffht.
Anxiety to render as complete as possible a Flora 
of this island, on which I have been for some years past, and am still engaged, and a 
desire to verify personally all the species and their respective stations, lead me ear- 
nestly to request from such gentlemen as have botanized in the island, a communica- 
tion of their discoveries, which I shall at all times feel most happy and grateful to 
receive and acknowledge, and most particularly so when accompanied by specimens, 
however small, of the plants found by them.

Discovery of Monotropa Hypopitys at Cawdor, Nairnshire.
Dr. Balfour lately 
paid me a hurried visit, on his return from a botanical excursion to Skye and the outer 
Hebrides, when he was so forLunate as to mate a very interesting addition to the Flora 
of this district, by the discovery of Monotropa Hypopitys in the wood of Cawdor, about 
a mile from here : I may, I believe, call it an addition to the Flora of Scotland, for 
Mr. Watson does not mention it in his very accurate ' Botanist's Guide,' as occurring 
in Scotland.
Dr. Balfour could get only a single specimen ; some days afterwards I 
succeeded in getting a few more, growing under birch and oak, where the ground was 
thickly covered with a moss (a species of Hypnum I believe), so densely indeed that 
the grass was almost choked with it, a blade only being to be seen here and there.
The 
specimens of Monotropa were generally about a yard apart, sometimes two being toge- 
ther.
I could trace the fibres of the Monotropa a very little way beyond those of the 
moss, and did not observe any connection between them and the roots of the oaks and 
birch, the only trees growing near them ; and am of opinion that if they draw any 
part of their nourishment from the roots of the neighbouring trees, they certainly do 
derive considerable support from the vegetable soil in which they grow.

Death oj Professor Don, It is our painful duty to announce to our readers the 
loss which Botany has sustained in the death of our esteemed and lamented friend, â€” 
Mr. David Don. His merits as a botanist are abundantly testified by his numerous 
papers and essays published in periodicals or transactions during the last twenty years, 
his worth as a man requires a more particular notice.
It has never been our lot to 
meet with a botanist equally able and willing to afford information to the student: 
his bibliographical knowledge was most extensive ; so much so indeed, that on the 
name of an author being mentioned to him, he would instantly inform the enquirer of 
all the works written by that author, of the value of their authority, their dates, prin- 
cipal contents, and the library in which they might be found ; and the slightest en- 
quiry would immediately elicit a detailed statement of every serviceable fact relative 
to the subject suggesting it.
Nothing could exceed the prompt and cheerful manner 
with which he entered into all debateable questions relating to botanical nomencla- 
ture, or his rigid impartiality in asserting the right of priority : nothing could exceed 
the kindness and zeal with which he assisted every student, however complicated or 
however trite the subject laid before him.
Indeed we may safely say, that in him the 
botanical enquirer has suffered a loss never to be repaired.
â€” 
" We ne'er shall look upon his like again." 
Mr. Don was born at Forfar on the 21st of December, 1779 ; and his descriptions 
of new and rare native plants found by his father in Scotland, proves Mr. Don's early 
proficiency in the study of Botany.
He came to London in 1819, and in 1822 was 
elected librarian to the Linnean Society, an appointment which he held during the 
remainder of his life.
In 1836 he was appointed Professor of Botany at King's Col- 
lege, and commenced his first course of lectures in the May of the same year.
He 
died at the house of the Linnean Society, at 1 o'clock in the morning of the 8th of 
December, 1841, after a painful and lingering illness of upwards of twelve months, 
and was buried on the 15th at the Kensale Green Cemetery.
In addition to the im- 
mediate relatives of the deceased, the funeral was attended by Dr. Brown, Sir W.
J. 
Hooker, Messrs.
Bowman, Forster, Bentham, Bennett, Anderson and Smith.
We insert below a chronological list of Mr. Don's works, so far as we have been 
able to ascertain them.

which causes an increase of heat by checking evaporation, whilst its depression, by encouraging evaporation, 
produces a decrease of heat.
3. That the sensible heat of plants is directly as the temperature of the air and 
the chemical action proceeding in their cells, and inversely as the radiation, evaporation and conducting 
power of the air and soil ; the chemical action increasing with an increase of atmospheric temperature, the 
amount of heat resulting therefrom increasing also.
BOTANICAL SOCIETY OF EDINBURGH.
Thursday, November 11, 1841.
Professor Graham in the chair.
Donations to the Herbarium were presented from Dr. Von Martius, and to the Library from Mrs. W.
Campbell, â€” and Professor Balfour mentioned that since last meeting he had been in communication with the 
Natural-History Society of Athens, to which he had transmitted a set of the Society's publications.
The following papers and communication were read : â€” 
1. Account of a Botanical Excursion to Skye and the Outer Hebrides, during the month of August, 1841, 
by Professor Balfour and Mr. Charles C.
Babington ; and remarks on the plants observed by them in the Is- 
lands of North Uist, Harris, and Lewis.
In this communication the authors drew attention chiefly to those 
facts which tend to illustrate the variations produced by climate, soil and elevation.
In Skye their observa- 
tions were confined to the south-western part of the island.
They landed at Armadale, and passing by Knock, 
Ord, and Strathaird to Loch Coiruisg, they crossed the Cuillin Hills to Sligachan, and from thence went by 
Bracadale to Dunvegan.
Among the plants observed in this route may be mentioned Eumex aquaticus, Atri- 
plex rosea, Arabis petreea, Myriophyllum altemiflorum, Potamogeton oblongus, Orobanche rubra, Mimulus 
luteus, &c.
From Dunvegan they crossed the Minsh to Loch Maddy in North Uist, and after examining the 
botany of that island they proceeded to Harris and Lewis.
On the lofty mountains of the forest of Harris, 
some of which they reckoned to be at least 3000 feet high, they were surprised to find very few alpine plants, 
for which they could only account by supposing the climate of the island to be so modified by the vicinity of 
the Great Atlantic Ocean, as to be too mild for the production of the usual alpine vegetation.
The following 
are mentioned among the more interesting plants found in Harris and Lewis : â€” Lamium intermedium, Eup- 
pia maritima, Pinguicula lusitanica, Thalictrum alpinum, Salix herbacea, Aira alpina, Saussurea alpina, 
Luzula spicata, Arabis petraea, Silene acaulis, Blysmus rufus, Juncus balticus, Scirpus lacustris, &c.
They 
also gathered Hymenophyllum Wilsoni among rocks upon the summit of Chesham, apparently the highest 
mountain of the range.
The number of species observed in North Uist, Hams and Lewis, during this ex- 
cursion, was 311, of which 21 belonged to the orders Filices, Lycopodiaceje and Equisetacese.
The number 
of true ferns was 14 ; being in the proportion of 1 to about every 22 of the flowering plants ; that is, they 
form about l-22nd part of the whole number of species at present known to be indigenous in these islands.
Mr. T.
Edmonston, jun., records 249 species of native plants for the Shetland Islands, (Ann. Nat.
Hist.
viii.
287), of which 14 are ferns, Lycopodiacese and Equisetacea;, the number of true ferns being 7, thus showing 
a proportion of 1 fern to about 33 flowering plants.
0\ving to the necessarily imperfect character of the Long 
Island list, it is impossible to draw any satisfactory conclusions from the above proportions, between the flow- 
ering plants and ferns, yet it may be noticed that there is a great preponderance of ferns in both these north- 
ern and insular countries, although the actual niunbers recorded are remarkably small.
The ferns in Shet- 
land are less numerous than those in Iceland or Faroe, while those of the Long Island exceed the Faroe 
species by four, and are exactly equal to the number found in Iceland, â€” the Faroe and Iceland lists being the 
smallest recorded in Mr. Watson's valuable paper on the Distribution of Ferns, recently published in the 
Transactions of this Society, (vol.
1, p.
89).
The more mountainous character of the Long Island will pro- 
bably account for the much larger proportion (1 to 22), which its ferns bear to the flowering plants, than that 
which appears to exist in Shetland â€” for although considerable allowances be made for the imperfect state of 
the Long Island list, on account of the short time employed in its preparation, yet it does not seem probable 
that the number of its flowering plants will be so far increased as to raise their relative proportion as high as 
that shown to exist in Shetland, since this would require an addition of 151 species, even if the number of 
136 
ferns remained stationary.
The communication concludes as follows :â€” "We must be allowed to impress up- 
on the Society, that this tour is not of the less interest for not having produced any plants new to the British 
Flora, since we consider the determination of the Flora of any district, peculiar either in its structure or situ- 
ation, to be of importance, as elucidating the effect of soils or climate upon the distribution of plants.
We 
would also take this opportunity of expressing our sense of the obligations under which we lie to the gentle.
men of Skye and the Long Island, who in a tiuly kind and liberal manner exercised their hospitality towards 
our party, and greatly contributed to the pleasure, indeed we may say to the success, of the excursion." 
2. On the Anatomy and Physiology of the seed of Phaseolus vulgaris, or French Bean; by Dr. Spencer 
Thomson, Burton-on-Trent.
In this paper, which was accompanied by illustrative drawings, the author, 
after giving an elaborate dissection of the seed, stated a variety of circumstances relative to its mode or coui'se 
of germination, and traced the analogy between that process and the growth of the foetus in the animal king-

Tuber ferrugineum, iri- 
dium Thesii, (Leefe), and Uredo Symphyti, (DeC.) ; by The Rev. J.
E. leefe.
With regard to the first of 
Uiese fungi, Mr. Leefe says â€” " The specimens are in general of a rich red bronze colour.
Their smell is pe- 
culiarly strong and penetrating, so that on receiving a letter enclosing specimens, Mr. Berkeley can, before 
opening it, determine positively what it contains." 
4. Notice of the discovery of Cerastium triviale, /3.
holosteoides, (Fries), near Kinfauns Castle, Perth- 
shire ; and of Eubus arcticus, near the head of Glen Tilt, Perthshire ; by Mr. J.
Robertson, Kinfauns Gar- 
den.
Considerable interest was manifested respecting the occurrence of tie latter species in the British Flora, 
and some discussion took place with regard to its identity ; but the specimen exhibited was so imperfect as 
to leave doubts whether the discovery ought yet to be fully relied on, especially as our botanists have more 
than once been disappointed in this respect.

BOTANICAL SOCIETY OF LONDON.
November 29.â€” Fifth Anniversary Meeting.
John Edward Gray, Esq., F.E.S,, &c., President, in the 
chair.
The Report of the Council was read, from which it appeared that 20 members had been elected since 
the last Anniversary, and that the Society now consisted of 142 members.
The donations to the Library 
amounted to 220 volumes, many of them valuable works.
The Council had determined that the Report on 
the Scientific Proceedings of the Society should appear at the close of the winter season, and it was fully ex- 
pected that a nearly complete collection of British plants would be ready for use in the course of the present 
winter, and also that a Foreign herbarium of several thousand specimens would soon be in equally good or- 
der.
The new regulations as to the disti-ibution of specimens, whereby the members are enabled to receive 
then- parcels shortly after their lists of desiderata are sent in, had been much approved of, and the appoint- 
ment of a paid Curator had been equally advantageous.
The Report was unanimously adopted.
A Ballot 
then took place for the Council for the ensuing year, when the Chairman was re-elected President, and he 
nominated John George Children, Esq., F.R.S., and Hewett Cottrell Watson, Esq., F.L.S., Vice-Presidents.
Mr. G.
E. Dennes, F.L.S., Mr. J.
Reynolds, and Mr. T.
Sansom, were respectively re-elected Secretary, 
Treasurer, and Librarian.
Additional local Secretaries were also appointed.

Beever ; British Fungi from Mr. D.

Wors- 
ley.
Mr. Hewett C.
Watson, V.P., presented specimens of the following undescribed British plants : â€” 
1. Linaria Bauhini.
Discovered near Penryn, in CornwEdl, in 1830 or 1831, by Mr. Watson ; again 
found at Shirley, near Soutliampton, in 1840 ; also by The Rev. W.
Hincks, in the county of Cork, last smn- 
mer.
It is the Antirrhinum Bauhini of Gaudin's ' Flora Helvetica,' â€” the Antirrhinum genistifolium of 
Suter's 'Floi-a Helvetica,' â€” but not the plant so named by Linnseus.
Probably also it is identical with 
Linaria Italica of Treviranus, and of Koch's ' Synopsis Florae GermanicEe et Helvetia;.' 
2. Lolium, multiflorum.
Discovered in a pea-field at Claygate, SuiTcy, in August, 1840, by Mr. Watson ; 
also in other parts of England, during the past summer, by different botanists.
It is Lolium multitlorum 
of Lamarck, Koch, and other continental botanists, who distinguish it from Lolium perenne by its annual 
root, numerous flowers in the spikelets, and the long awns.
The two last are varying characters, and the 
plant is reduced to a variety of Lolium perenne by Bertolini, in the ' Flora Italica." 
3. Bromus commutatus.
This grass is frequent in England and Scotland, but has constantly been con- 
fused with other species of Bromus.
Smith first mistook it for Bromus arvensis, and afterwards, in Uie 
' English Flora,' described it jointly with another species under the name of Bromus racemosus.
The spe- 
cimens distributed by the Botanical Societies of London and Edinburgh, under the name of Bromus arven- 
sis, all probably belong to Bromus commutatus, and it is left a question whether the former species is indige- 
nous to Britain.
Independently of more technical distinctions, there is one obvious enough at first sight, 
namely, that the flowers of Bromus arvensis (Linn.) are only half the size of those of Bromus commutatus, 
(Schrader), as was shown in an accompanying specimen of Bromus arvensis from Germany.

â€” Three Days on the Cotteswolds.
By Jas. Buckman, Esq.
Having engaged to accompany my friend Mr. Edwin Lees, in a three days' Na- 
tural-History expedition to the Cotteswolds, towards the end of September in the pre- 
sent year [1841] we started on our journey, armed with vasculums, portfolios, books, 
hammers and bags, and under the command of General Briggs, of Cheltenham, a 
gentleman to whom the naturalists of this neighbourhood are much indebted for his 
kindness in aiding their researches, by accommodating them on such occasions as the 
present with the use of his carriage, so that they may arrive at the scene of their la- 
bours on the rugged hill-top or heathy moor, fresh and ready for work.
Having proceeded as far from Cheltenham as the first coach-stage on the Lon- 
don road, we tunied to the left from Andoversford Inn, and in a short time alighted 
from the carriage in the very heart of the Cotteswolds, the road leading directly 
over the top of the hills to the ancient town of Stow-on-the-Wold.
Of course we soon 
diverged from the road into the fields, where we duly commented on the great abun- 
dance of Campanula glomerata, Cnicus acaulis and Carlina vulgaris, which in this 
neighbourhood are always stout and fair, and of goodly proportions, the latter espe- 
cially, as it occurs from one to two feet in height, whilst on Leckhampton, a hill nearer 
Cheltenham, it seldom attains more than four inches, and looks so withered and dead 
as to lead an inexperienced botanist into the belief that it is some ill-grown specimen 
of a common thistle in a state of decay ; and this peculiar appearance is not entirely 
lost in the more luxuriant specimens, as the external scales of the involucre always 
present the appearance of the " sear and yellow leaf " of approaching death.
That 
beautiful thistle, Cnicus eriophorus, is frequently met with in a most luxuriant condi- 
tion on the grassy sides of these hilly roads.
Immediately on emerging from this road to the right across the fields, by a place 
called Slad Barn, we found some fine plants of Linaria spuria, the corollas of severa.
specimens of which had three or four spurs ; this is a curious circumstance, but one 
that I had before observed in specimens growing near Cheltenham in a rich cultivated 
soil.
Some of these corollas too, instead of being lipped, were salver-shaped, with a 
straight upright tube.
I very much regret that I did not then think of ' The Phyto- 
logist,' as all good botanists should do, or I should certainly have made a drawing of 
this singular kind of metamorphosis, for insertion in its valuable pages ; this omission 
I promise to rectify on some future occasion, as the extent of change cannot be shown 
in the dried specimens.
This Linaria is extremely common on our highest hills as 
well as in the vales, and is accompanied in all its habitats by the elegant little L.
Ela- 
tine, and I suspect the one is derived from the other, as I have met with numberless 
intermediate stages ; and if Linaria spuria and Elatine are to be considered distinct 
species, surely the speciuicn I have adverted to ni ust claim to be considered as an ad- 
M 
138 
ditional one.
Specularia hybrida, with Euphorbia exigua and Peplus, were found at 
the same spot.
Onobrychis sativa formed the aftercrop of the field, from which barley 
was just ready to be carried; this substitution of Onobrychis for clover as an aftercrop 
is a somewhat novel feature in our farming.
Having crossed the road some distance farther on, we commenced tracing up a 
lovely hill-stream called the Windrush.
At the picturesque village of Harmton it is 
a small brook, whose " waters flow on with a murmuring sound,'* and are as bright 
and as clear as crystal ; and here we met with four species of Potamogeton, â€” grami- 
neus, densus, crispus and lucens ; the large beds of the three last, with their rich po- 
lished leaves, as they were agitated by the ceaseless flow of the rippling stream, under 
the influence of a bright sun, reflected the richest and most varied tints imaginable.
The Potamogetons are comparatively rare with us, on account of our great paucity of 
water.
In this brook we also found another plant of rare occurrence in this district, 
â€” Poa aquatica.
Just before we left the road to explore the brook, our attention was 
arrested by the sight of two large trees of Pyrus Aria, which were then in fine fruit.
This tree gives quite a characteristic feature to all the Cotteswold woods, the bright 
silvery leaves contrasting beautifully with the dark green of summer and the rich yel- 
low and brown tints of autumn ; but owing to the practice of annually clearing away 
a portion of underwood, with which this tree is generally doomed, it is rare to find a 
specimen in flower ; and it is not until one meets with a venerable tree in some retired 
nook, where the woodman's axe has been withheld for a number of years, that one can 
obtain a presentable specimen, as these trees do not flower until, " with lichens silvery 
grey," the bark has attained the same hue as the leaves.
Leaving this brook to pursue its tortuous course through some beautiful green 
fields, we proceeded by a nearer route to the spot where it passes under the turnpike 
toad ; and having recrossed this via intermedia of our course, we again traced up the 
brook to the rich botanical habitat known by the name of the Seven Springs.* Here 
the water gushes out from several places at the base of an oolitic hill, tossing and 
leaping in wild tumultuous joy, as if well pleased to escape from its rocky cave into 
the light of day, and a glorious day it was that shone upon the liquid crystal at the 
time of our visit.
These waters, at a short distance from the base of the hill, run over 
a largish surface of tolerably level ground, forming a kind of swamp or bog, bounded 
on one side by the Windrush, whose waters these springs considerably augment.
The 
botanist who is not afraid of wet feet, or the chance of the occasional disappearance of 
a leg or so in the depths of a quagmire, and few ardent spirits mind such trifling mis- 
chances, will find himself amply rewarded by diligently examining every inch of this 
slippery place; for though it was so late in the year, we discovered the following 
plants during our short visit.
â€” 
Blysmus compressus Menyanthes trifoliata Pinguicula vulgaris 
Carex vesicaria Parnassia palustris Scutellaria galericulata 
Hydrocotyle vulgaris Pedicularis palustris Triglochin palustre 
Marchantia polymorpha 
* These Seven Springs must not be confounded with those on the Cirencester road, 
which are said to be the source of the Thames.
Our country people are very fond of 
calling by this name all places where the water gushes forth from a number of small 
channels.
139 
A few yards farther on, in the spring or early summer, was to be found that rare 
plant Thlaspi perfoliatum ; and this is now perhaps the only locality for it in Britain, 
as I am given to understand that the rapacity of unprincipled collectors has nearly or 
quite destroyed it in its old habitat at Burford quarries.
Two years since, on another 
of the small hills beyond the one at the base of which we have been tarrying so long, I 
gathered a plentiful supply of Anemone Pulsatilla ; and at the same time I acciden- 
tally stumbled on the Thlaspi.
In the vale below, on the brook side, is our only ha- 
bitat for Saxifraga granulata.
Leaving this most interesting spot we pursued our journey to the large and opu- 
lent village of Bourton-on-the-Water, plucking on our road a few specimens of An- 
thyllis Vulneraria and the pretty little Geranium columbinum ; which latter plant, 
associated with Acinos vulgaris, occurs plentifully on all our hilly lands which have 
been subjected to cultivation.
Next morning we had to await the ending of a thunder-storm before we could re- 
sume our wanderings ; and then, having to pass over a considerable tract of country 
which we had already examined, we hired a vehicle to convey us to the woods between 
Bourton and Winchcombe, having previously fixed on the latter place as the termi- 
nation of our second day's journey.
On arriving at Guiting woods we left the chaise 
and proceeded a little distance along the lane, the grassy sides of which were thickly 
strewn with Gentiana Amarella ; this species is very abundant all over the hills, but I 
have never found G entiana campestris in this neighbourhood.
Having fairly entered into these woods we made it a point to trace up the Wind- 
rush to its source, expecting to meet with a picturesque wood scene, and perhaps find 
some good plant, which might be accurately localized from growing in such a situa- 
tion.
In the former expectation we were disappointed, as the spring rises out of a 
swampy piece of ground, and presents nothing remarkable ; but three grasses amply 
satisfied us on the latter score, these were Elymus europaeus, Calamagrostis epigejos 
and Poa nemoralis, all three of rare occurrence here.
Alchemilla vulgaris was very 
fine ; this plant is not common here, while A.
arvensis is found everywhere.
Rham- 
nus catharticus and Viburnum Lantana were observed in this wood ; and the grassy 
glades in the wood and fields around were thickly studded with Colchicum autumnale.
This plant is very plentiful all over the Cotteswolds, and even in the vale we have 
whole fields of it : the roots and seeds of the Colchicum are collected in great quanti- 
ties from this neighbourhood, for the London physic-market, as the plant still holds a 
high reputation for the cure of gout and rheumatism.
The above are some of the most important plants seen by us this day, the grass 
having been so wet as to prevent our examining the country with the requisite indus- 
try and circumspection ; moreover, we were rather anxious to reach the old-fashioned 
town of Winchcombe, whither our friend the General had preceded us.
Soon after 
emerging from the wood we fell upon a large stone-quarry, which of course claimed a 
share of our attention.
And this reminds me that I have not yet said anything on the 
geological construction of this neighbourhood, a subject which I consider highly im- 
portant to the proper illustration of the Botany of a district ; perhaps therefore the 
following remarks may not be deemed out of place.
The vale of Gloucester is composed of the blue clays and marls of the lower lias 
formation, presenting us with all the fossil remains peculiar to this formation, such as 
the Ichthyosauri, many Ammonites and bivalve shells, and occasional remains of 
plants.
This bed of lias clay is occasionally covered to the depth of from 20 to 30 
M 2 
140 
feet with fine sand, especially in many parts upon which the town of Cheltenham is 
built, the greater portion of which deposit is derived from the neighbouring hills by 
which the vale is bounded on its eastern extremity; on tracing up the escarpments of 
these hills we meet with the following beds, namely, the middle lias or lias marlstone, 
the upper lias, corresponding with the alum shale of Yorkshire, immediately on which 
rests the inferior oolite, which forms the greater portion of the Cotteswold hills.
And 
it should be remarked that although the members of the lias formation make up the 
greater portion of the acclivities by which the higher hills are approached, still these 
slopes are so thickly covei'ed with the debris from the oolite which forms the upper 
stratum, as to render this, so far as the Botany is concerned, a district of oolitic lime- 
stone, whilst the vale, as I have before remarked, offers us the stiff clays of the lias.
And here I would refer my readers to an article by Mr. Spruce (Phytol.
101), and it 
will at once be seen that notwithstanding this neighbourhood and Yorkshire are so 
much alike in lithological character, scarcely two plants of the same species were found 
in the three days' ramble of the two parties, plainly showing that in these instances 
we must seek for some other causes of variation besides the soil, of which altitude and 
climate may require some consideration.
It may be worthy of remark that our high- 
est elevation is little more than 1 000 feet.
After duly examining the quarry which has led us into the above geological disser- 
tation, we proceeded on the even tenour of our way along the lane, the banks of which 
were thickly strewn with that everywhere found and universal favourite, the harebell, 
intermixed with Gentiana Amarella and the common Hieracium Pilosella.
Having 
arrived at the Tracey Arms at Winchcombe, and packed up a hamper of specimens, 
we refreshed ourselves, and then finished the second day's ramble with an examination 
of the fine ruins of Sudely Castle, whence we gathered, as a memorial of our visit, 
that constant attendant on old ruins, Cheiranthus Cheiri.
Notwithstanding certain gloomy appearances the previous evening, the early dawn 
of our third day was as favorable as one could desire.
The sun, at rising, was shroud- 
ed in clouds of mist â€” a sure indication of a fine day ; these being gradually dispelled, 
he soon shone forth in all his splendour, the fierceness of his rays being tempered by 
a delightfully refreshing breeze.
Early on a morning of such promise did Mr. Lees 
and myself once more wend our way to the Cotteswolds, this time with the iutenti(Â»n 
of examining their western escarpment.
Proceeding from the town of Winchcomb 
towards Postlip, near the paper-mills, we fell in with a tree of Rosa sarmentacea ; the 
greater stoutness of the stems, its more compact mode of growth, with the larger bright 
scarlet fruits of this rose, distinguish it at first sight from Rosa canina.
In ihe same 
hedge-row were some fine trees of Salix Russelliana ; and further on, nearer the mill, 
great quantities of Lathyrus sylvestris presented themselves.
At the once stately 
mansion called Postlip Hall, we spent a little time in sketching the beautiful Norman 
arches of a ruined chapel.
Immediately below the chapel, on the banks of a hill ri- 
vulet, we met with Triglochin palustre, Blysmus compressus, Spergula nodosa, and 
quantities of Valeriana dioica ; and following this little stream up a ravine, we were 
soon presented with some fine specimens of Polypodium calcareum, and on the side of 
the hill to the left were some splendid plants of Atropa Belladonna in fine fruit.
We 
then passed over Cleeve Clouds in the hope of finding Astragalus hypoglottis, as I 
had seen a specimen from thence, but in this we were disappointed ; however, in exa- 
mining a field covered with Calluna vulgaris, we were amply rewarded by securing 
many specimens ot Gnaphalium sylvaticum.
We next examined the clifls over- 
141 
hanging Queen Wood, which look down upon Lord Ellenhorough's seat at Southam ; 
the crevices of the rocks afforded Aspleuium Trichomanes and Ruta-muraria, and on 
some of the masses of stones were Myosotis collina, Solidago Virgaurea, and young 
plants of Verbascum nigrum.
Upon penetrating into the wood helow, we were soon 
iu active employment securing the most beautiful specimens of Convallaria Pulygo- 
natum in fruit, in searching for which we saw whole patches of C.
majalis.
Rosa vil- 
losa, Viburnum Lantana and Opulus, Rhamnus catharticus, Conyza squarrosa and 
Campanula glomerata also claimed a share of our attention ; but the greatest prize in 
this rich spot is Rubus saxatilis, and of course upon seeing it we were very anxious 
to secure specimens in fruit, as it simulates the young state of R.
caesius so m\ich, as 
to render it a matter of great difficulty to distinguish them.
After looking for some 
time in the thickest part of the wood without finding the wished for red drupes, we di- 
rected our attention to the more open parts, where we found some specimens in very 
fine fruit, with the drupeols few, large and red.
And here we observed a somewhat 
curious fact, which is that such plants as had runners were without fruit, while 
those in fruit were stronger, partially woody, but destitute of runners.
After collect- 
ing quantum suff.
of these rare plants, we were bending our steps homewards towards 
Cheltenham, when my friend Lees became very anxious to visit a beech-grove then in 
sight ; and though we had been thirteen hours on the wild hills with only a biscuit 
between us.
I was fain to yield to his wishes in the hope of finding Monotropa Hypo- 
pitys, which we did find, and I am quite sure the readers of ' The Phytologist ' will 
share in our pleasure and gratification in so doing, in reading the elegant paper by 
Mr. Lees, detailing his investigation into its parasitic nature, (Phytol, 97).
After se- 
curing an abundance of the Monotropa in fruit, and also some fine specimens of Epi- 
pactis grandiflora in the same state, we set our faces homeward in real earnest, and 
soon arrived well satisfied with our sport, and inwardly resolving never to let a season 
pass without having a Natural-History expedition ou the lovely Cotteswolds.

Mr. Thomas Milne, a botanist not likely to be deceived, told me that 
he had seen specimens which he knew had been gathered on a heath somewhere 
near Pontardulais, but I have never been able to find it.
I was also assured by 
Dr. Turton, that a wild specimen of Erica mediterranea had been brought to 
him, which was gathered in the same neighbourhood, (Dillwyn).

lufii-mary, and at Salt-house Point.
Abundant on Cromlyn Burrows, where I 
have also found a plant which very well answered to Sowerby's figure of Chiro- 
nia littoralis, and I much doubt whether either of them is more than a starved 
plant, or variety of E.

to PwUywrach.
Another species, allied to V.
Blattaria, which I believe has not 
yet been admitted into the British Flora, for many years grew freely with CEuo- 
thera biennis, on the sand hills in front of Cambrian Place, but by the enclosure 
of the Burrows it has probably been destroyed, (Dillwyn).
Atropa Belladonna.

Note on Lyeopodium inundatum.* I have this day been looking on Esher 
Common, with the last number of ' The Phytologist ' in hand, for Lyeopodium inun- 
datum, and have found it in tolerable abundance ; but as on close inspection I find its 
habit as to branching to be more than occasional, I venture to send you a specimen, 
and to state what appears to me to be the normal mode of growth.
In several plots 
of ground which have been pared not very long ago, perhaps three or four years, I en- 
deavoured to trace the old branch of the Lyeopodium, and almost invariably, where I 
* In a letter to E.
Newman.
146 
was able to do so, found it remotely connected with another old branch at a wide an* 
gle.
I think I found as many recent stems forked as simple ; and the latter, to my 
mind, appeared to form the exception, and not the rule.
I beg to send this as a sug- 
gestion, which, I cannot help thinking, you will find, on investigation, to be founded 
in reality ; for, according to my view, the stems are, as you say, prostrate, creeping, 
firmly adhering to the soil by means of their roots, but instead of being rarely branch- 
ed, with a tendency at length to become dichotomous, the two branches then gradually 
growing at a wider angle from each other, perhaps until the angle is one of 70".
The 
old stems are all so much decayed that I was not able to secure a single one with its 
remote branch ; but the specimen I send vnll show the incipient ramifications, the 
weaker of the two at a very obtuse angle.
Centunculus minimus and Bidens cernua 
are both found on the common.

Curious form of the common Reed.
Should the botanist be tempted to ramble 
along the shore towards Puckaster, he can hardly fail to remark the very singular form 
of the common reed (Phragmites vulgaris), which abounds on the slipped banks of wet 
a,nd almost semifluid clay, skirting the southern shores of this island.
The only notice 
I can find of this curious prostrate variety of a species naturally quite erect, is in Ray's 
Synopsis, 3rd edition, by Dillenius, where, in the Indiculus Plantarum Dubiarum at 
the end of the volume, I remember to have read very long ago the then very puz- 
zling announcement of a " Gramen arundinaceum 30 pedes longum.
On the South 
of the I.
of Wight by the sea-side towards the Point; " precisely the very station on 
which I first met with it, and calling to recollection the above quotation, which at the 
time of reading it only created a feeling of wonderment, the mystery was at once ex- 
plained.
Springing from the steep sides of these extraordinary land-slips, the roots in- 
terlacing in all directions just beneath the surface, may the common reed of our ponds 
and marshes be seen with its culms depending like long and slender ropes, or trailing 
in a straight or serpentine direction on the shingly beach or the smooth and level sand, 
and that without rooting at the joints, to the length of from 20 to 40 or even 50 feet.
I have never observed the extremities of the culms to blossom under these circumstan- 
ces, as indeed they could scarcely be expected to do with so exhausting a length of 
growth ; the leaves too are very short, as if imperfectly developed, and occasionally a 
few radicles are emitted from one or other of the joints, but in general the plant lies 
quite prostrate and entirely unconnected with the soil from the root upwards, so that 
it may be wound about any object like a cord, without the least difiiculty.
The vari- 
ety is very common on the slipped shore beyond Black-gang, and has been noticed 
since near Bembridge, by my zealous friend Dr. Thos.
Bell Salter.

Staphylea pinnata.
The retention of Staphylea pinnata in our Floras seems 
continued in deference to the authority of Ray, in whose time it is said to have grown 
about Pontefract sparingly and not certainly wild.
It is likewise mentioned by Mer- 
rett as found in " woods in the farther part " of the same county, and as a Yorkshire 
plant by Smith, on the authority of Saml.
Hailstone Esq. of Bradford, but who now 
sees reason to believe himself mistaken in thinking it a native.
The old writers, Ge- 
rarde and Parkinson, mention it, the former giving very suspicious localities for it in 
Lincolnshire, the latter, hedges about Ashford in Kent.
In none of these stations has 
it been seen by any recent botanists.
I am told it is plentiful in Arniston woods, near 
Edinburgh, but accompanied by the lilac, laburnum and other shrubs of foreign growth, 
plainly pointing out its extraneous origin.
It is much to be regretted that our gene- 
147 
ral and local Floras should be burdened with stations actually more than suspicious, 
yet passed currently for truly wild localities, without allusion to or comment on their 
disputable character.
The practice is one subversive of all progress in Vegetable Ge- 
ography, a most interesting and delightful department of botanical science.

Additions and corrections in the Scottish localities of Lycopodium inundatum, 
(Phytol.
49).
From the careful manner in which Mr. Newman is drawing up his in- 
teresting papers on the British Lycopodia in 'The Phytologist,' I presume he will ex- 
cuse my pointing out a slight inaccuracy in that on Lye. inundatum.
He mentions 
two localities in this country, but they are really but one and the same station, and 
that a very circumscribed one, hardly two yards square, first observed by myself.
Dr.
Balfour, I know, never saw this Lycopodium growing in Nairnshire, and Dr. Greville 
I believe never was there ; they have furnished him I suppose with copies of the tal- 
lies which accompanied the specimens they received from the station, so that it is not 
unlikely the mistake ai'ose with myself; I shall give below the station more correctly 
described.
This correction is so unimportant that I should not have troubled you 
about it, but that I can give you at the same time three other Scotch stations for this 
plant.
Beginning at the most South-easterly station and going N.W., they would 
stand in the following order, which is also, I rather think, the order of their discovery,

Notes on the Genus Tilia.
Notwithstanding the repeated discussion of the 
claims of our three species or fonns of Tilia to be considered indigenous to Britain, 
and the adduction of many facts pro and con, no definite conclusion appears as yet to 
have been arrived at.
In this undecided state of the question it becomes the duty of 
botanists to accumulate all the facts and observations within their power, bearing up- 
on the subject at issue.
With this view I forward the following statement of the ap- 
pearance and occurrence of the genus in the Forest of Wyre, as communicated to me 
by Mr. George Jorden, of Bewdley.
I should however premise that the present Fo- 
rest of Wyre, which comprises an area of about fifteen or isixteen square miles, one 
148 
lialf in Shropshire and the other in Worcestershire and Staffordshire, is merely the 
remnant of a much more extensive forest, which, from ancient records, is well ascer- 
tained to have existed there in the earlier periods of our history, and consequently 
must be considered as an undoubted primitive or natural forest.
Mr. Jorden writes as 
follows.
" The Tilias are thinly scattered over the Shropshire part, but in the Worcestershire 
portion they are abundantly spread over an extensive district, there being many entire 
copses of them.
A loamy or sandy soil suits them best.
By some eminent botanists 
the Tilias are not considered indigenous ; I consider them truly so, if I may be allow- 
ed to differ from them in opinion, when founded on the results of my having traversed 
this forest in various parts, for upwards of three miles in a straight direction.
I find 
T. Europcea and grandifolia very generally distributed in a great portion of Worcester- 
shire, and but sparingly in Shropshire, in our native woods and hedges on the rocky 
declivities of the banks of the Severn, where they grow self-planted in shapeless mass- 
es.
They prefer the light soils accompanying the new red sandstone formation, and 
have spread themselves over the stiff soils adjoining, but more sparingly.
Even the 
oak, king and tyrant of the forest, has permitted the location of Tilia Europcea in the 
centre of the forest of Wyre, but T.
grandifolia is not so plentiful.
In our very old 
hedges, so interesting iu those portions of the country which have been longest under 
cultivation, are faithfully recorded all our truly indigenous trees and shrubs, which 
were moved promiscuously from the contiguous wilds some centuries ago, and which 
will remain for ages yet to come, since by diminishing their stature their existence is 
apparently prolonged.
In a very short space of such hedges I have noted the greater 
number of our native trees and shrubs, the undoubted tenants of our ancient forests, 
and amongst the rest Tilia Europcea and grandifolia.
In plantations I perceive some 
Tilias which seem to differ from those which grow wild in our woods and hedges." 
Mr. Jorden kindly accompanied the above interesting and instructive remarks with 
specimens, which on examination I found readily separable into three very distinct 
forms, identical with our three species : â€” Europcea, grandifolia and parvifolia.
These, 
independently of any characters from the form, number, or clothing of the fruit, I 
perceived were easily distinguishable by the form and texture of their leaves.
In T.
Europcea and grandifolia the leaves were of a thin membranaceous substance, of a 
bright transparent green, paler on the under surface, and with very unequal bases.
In Europcea the serratures of the margins were finer and sharper, their apices pretty 
generally directed towards the point of the leaf; whilst in grandifolia the serratures 
were larger and coarser, their apices patulous or spreading in all directions.
The 
nervures of T.
grandifolia on the under surface were ciliated or hairy ; those of Eu- 
ropcea being glabrous, except at the axils.
In T.
parvifolia, on the contrary, the leaves 
were of a thick coriaceous texture, of an opaque green on the upper surface, but pe- 
culiarly and most markedly glaucous beneath, and with very equal and deeply cordate 
bases.
The serratures of the margins were large, coarse and patulous, having a strong 
tendency to become lobed in the upper portion.

Notes on Monotropa Hypofitys.
In reference to the question of the parasitical 
habit of Monotropa (Phytol.
43), I may state that I have had an opportunity of study- 
ing it this year in rather favourable circumstances.
It grows on the Lancashire coast, 
near Southport, among Salix argentea, on the roots of which it was supposed to be pa- 
rasitical.
With a view to ascertain this, I was supplied in August last with a plant 
149 
carefully cut out in the sod, by the oiiginal discoverer (Linneeus Aughton of Southport), 
through the kindness of my friend Dr. J.
B. Wood, of Manchester.
Notwithstanding 
the apparent facilities for laying hare the root of the plant, the soil consisting of mere 
sand, it was not an easy task to separate the extraneous matter from the subject of en- 
quiry, and at the same time to preserve the connexion^ if any, that might exist between 
the root of the Monotropa and that of the Salix included in the sod ; but having bestow- 
ed considerable care on the process, 1 feel warranted in stating that the plant is not a 
parasite.
The root seems to consist of a number of branched tubers, whose extremi- 
ties are not attenuated, but obtuse.
My idea of the tuberous nature of the root, is 
founded on the fact that young buds are found immersed in the substance of the cy- 
lindrical ramifications, destined, I presume, to become future branches, which grow 
out at right angles from that on which they are fixed.
If spongioles exist at all, they 
must be sought for at the extremities of the ramifications.
It may be as well to state 
that the individual examined possessed a rudimentary stem, which had all the appear- 
ance of being a successive growth for development at a future season.
The position 
of this embryo stem was somewhat peculiar, pointing downwards.
I believe the plant 
to be entirely destitute of stumata : it also differs materially from Lathraea in its eco- 
nomy, having nothing whatever analogous to the subterranean leaves of that plant.
Since writing the above I have read the paper by Mr. Lees, â€” ' On the parasitic 
growth of Monotropa Hypopitys,' (Phytol.
97) ; and whilst I admit that my researches, 
however carefully conducted, afford only negative proof, I think it must be granted 
that neither the drawings nor the observations of Mr. Lees are conclusive, and that 
the affirmative evidence of the parasitism of Monotropa, amounts to no more than 
prohability.
Moreover, I cannot avoid the inference that the investigation has not 
been conducted with that care and scientific skill which the subject demands; for no- 
thing like microscopic dissection appears in Mr. Lees' drawings, and the mere appli- 
cation of a lens will not solve the mystery.
In my deliberate judgment the " fleshy 
clustered radicles " mentioned in the foot-note at p.
100, form the proper and the only 
root of the plant; and some of Mr. Lees' remarks confirm this opinion.
In the 
Southport plant examined by me, there was indeed a very close investment of the root, 
nearly like that described by Mr. Lees; but my inference was that it consisted of the 
woolly matted extremities of the grasses which grew with the Monotropa : be that as 
it may, I succeeded in detaching it from the roots of the latter, with as much ease as 
such a coat might be expected to permit, and when detached there was no appearance 
of laceration or "solution of continuity" between it and the root which it had encased.
Some idea of this coating may be gathered from the cloth-like arillus of the seed of 
the tamarind.
I will now briefly state what I myself observed at variance with the 
position laid down by Mr. Lees.
1st.
That the mass composing the root of the Southport Monotropa had a white 
covering of a matted and somewhat woolly substance, supposed to proceed from the ra- 
dicles of the grasses which grew with it.
Under the microscope, and after careful 
anatomical examination, I could not find the least trace of organic connexion be- 
tween this coating and the root of the Monotropa.
2ndly.
That there was not even contact, much less parasitical connexion, between 
this white coating and the roots of the Salix contained in the sod.
I may here mention what were my perceptions as to the scent given out by Mono- 
tropa.
Mr. Lees confirms the account given by Smith, and it would appear that a 
primrose-like scent exhales from the ])]ant, even when in seed.
Fresh flowering plants 
150 
from Soiithport were quite inodorous to me until they had lain some time in paper to 
dry ; they then gave out a scent very similar to that of a raw potato, and I took care 
to have the fact confirmed by other people's noses.
I may also mention that Mono- 
tropa has not been accurately described either by Smith or Hooker.
What the for- 
mer alludes to as smaller and interior petals, in reality constitute the calyx, and are 
inserted on the outside of the true petals, which have cucuUate bases projecting farther 
back than the point of insertion : hence the mistake into which Smith has fallen ; the 
petals therefore are but 4 or 5, and the leaves of the perianth corresponding in number.
The hollow channelled stigma and style of Monotropa may be considered very favour- 
able for exhibiting the pollen-tubes ; with a small hooked needle they may be drawn 
out from a longitudinally divided style in considerable masses, each poll en- tube having 
the same diameter as the grain of pollen at its summit.

Adiantum Capillus-Veneris in the Isle of Man. During the summer of 1841, 
and but a short time previous to the date of Mr. Clark's notice (Phytol.
89), I had oc- 
casion to visit the Isle of Man ; and foremost among the objects of attraction in the 
island was Adiantum Capillus-Veneris at Glen " Meay," to see which, and the ruins 
at Peel, a day was set apart.
We were soon rolled across the island from Douglas, 
and having wandered musingly for some time among the venerable ruins of Peel Cas- 
tle, I proceeded to the extensive quarry of old red sandstone in the neighbourhood, and 
thence directed my steps to " the Glen," which, after some trouble, I found.
The 
plantation was entered through a gap in the hedge-row, and following a narrow path 
through the trees, I gained the brook-side about twenty yards below the fall ; with 
some ditBculty I made my way, on the right hand side of the brook, to the basin, and 
having leaped the stream, I found good footing on the extended gravel bed of the brook, 
which was bounded by a precipitous bank of rock, but certainly in no way deserving 
the appellation of a cave.
It was in the crevices of this rock that I first observed the 
Adiantum, and here I found only about four almost leafless plants ; fearful lest this 
might be the only spot on which it grew, and deprecating, with Mr. Newman, every- 
thing like botanical ravages, I made some further examination before any specimens 
were gathered, and for the satisfaction of Mr. Clark and others I can state that there 
is no need of doubt respecting its continuance, for in the course of my search, which was 
continued as far as I could manage to get along the left bank, I found young plants, 
intermingled with a few more mature ones, in tolerable quantities, though it required 
some examination where the fronds were gone, and they were fast decaying, to disco- 
ver the roots of the fern.
Furthermore I may add that the finest root I saw, perhaps 
the parent of the whole, was high above the waterfall, and perfectly inaccessible ; this 
it was that left in my mind no fear of its eradication, I therefore gathered the few roots 
I first saw, leaving little thei-e behind me.
Such however was the state of these roots 
that they only supplied about seven green fronds ; they are doing very well in cultiva- 
tion.
The difiiculty of discovering the frondless roots was perhaps, also, in some mea- 
sure, the cause of Mr. Clark's disappointment ; but surely, to carry away the only root 
to be found, is not the best method of rendering authentic a dubious locality.

Objection to the Alphabetical Arrangement of Local Lists of Plants.
Mr.
Editor, will you allow me to make public (in the same periodical) an individual pro- 
test against a recommendation made by the reviewer of the second edition of the Cata- 
logue published by the Botanical Society of Edinburgh, (Phytol.
109).
The reviewer 
151 
very judiciously recommends the adoption of that Catalogue as a general standard of 
nomenclature ; and with that recommendation I would most cordially concur, not- 
withstanding an opinion that some of the names will be again changed in a third edi- 
tion.
But the reviewer extends his recommendation farther than this, by suggesting 
the expediency of botanists adopting the alphabetical arrangement in publishing local 
lists of plants ; and it is against this latter part of the recommendation that I would 
offer my single protest ; knowing well, from long and frequent experience, the extreme 
inconvenience of consulting such alphabetical lists.
It is absolutely necessary for dis- 
tributing societies to have a fixed series of names, to facilitate the tedious processes of 
sorting their specimens, and of supplying the desiderata-lists of applicants; and the 
alphabetical order certainly offers many advantages for this special purpose.
It is 
much otherwise when the general objects of science are concerned, and individual stu- 
dents or writers require to consult numerous books and lists of plants, published at 
different periods, or in different countries.
Uniformity of names is out of the ques- 
tion under these circumstances ; and any arrangement by which similar plants are 
brought together becomes better than an alphabetical one, in which similar names 
only can be brought together, and where a difference of name of course destroys the 
regularity of the series.
I am now engaged in preparing for the press a somewhat vo- 
luminous work on the distribution and localities of the plants of Britain, and have 
found it so very inconvenient to make references to alphabetical catalogues, or even to 
consult them, as to have felt strongly disposed to draw a line of distinction between 
the alphabetical and arranged lists ; rejecting the former as unsuitable for the purpo- 
ses of science.
I find that with one, or at most two exceptions, this line of distinction 
would throw out only the inaccurate lists of inexperienced and incompetent botanists; 
but as it would be wounding the feelings of others without any necessity for doing so, 
did I give examples of this, it is better to refrain.
Those who have had half as fre- 
quent occasions as I have had, to consult lists of plants published in this country, will 
easily supply examples from their own recollections.
The internal evidence afforded 
by the Catalogue reviewed, clearly indicates the individual author of the altered no- 
menclature ; and we do not find him publishing local lists alphabetically, when the 
general purposes of botanical science are in view, though he has printed some highly 
interesting and valuable lists of that class.

Additions to the Flora of Moray.
Mr. Stables (Phytol.
132) records an inte- 
resting addition to the published Catalogue of Moray plants.
Perhaps it may be 
worth while to add two other species observed by myself within the same district last 
summer, as the non-mention of any plant in a local Flora is a sort of negative evidence 
against its existence in the tract.
The two species are Allosorus ciispus and Carex 
saxatilis; the former growing in plenty on a stone wall near the toll-bar at Dalwhin- 
nie ; the latter in a mountain corri, about five miles eastward of the same place, and 
at an elevation rather exceeding 2,500 feet.

E. Smith, at Lymington ; which, although presenting the characters of that species, actually exhibited in 
two panicles a strong tendency to the reflexion of the adult branches, as in Poa distans.
Mr. Adam Gerard 
presented some interesting plants from Sierra Leone, collected by Mrs. Blyth.
The Society had also received 
a large collection of foreign mosses from Dr. Muhlenbeck ; and specimens of Seseli Libanotis collected in 
Herts, by The Rev. W.
H. Coleman.
Books had also been presented by Mr. Gutch, Mr. Luxford, Mr G.
Rich, and the Shropshire Natural-History Society.
A letter was read from Dr. Nees Von Esenbeck, thanking 
the Society for electing him a foreign member.
A paper was read from Edwin Lees, Esq. F.L.S., " On the Flora of the Malvern Hills, and the suiTound- 
ing Distiict, in Worcestershire, Herefordshire and Gloucestershire," (accompanied by an excellent map illus- 
trative of the stations of plants).
The author observed that the Malvern Hills, in an undulating narrow ridge 
of nine miles in length, running very nearly due North and South, form " a great back-bone" between the 
counties of Worcester and Hereford, while Gloucestershire joins the two former counties at the extreme South- 
em end of the chain.
The mass of syenite itself, of which the hills geologically consist, is so narrow that but 
little advantage would be gained by attempting to note the plants of the Hills irrespective of the District 
aroujid them, most of the rarer plants in fact occurring rather in the valleys or at the base of the chain, than 
on the rocky summits themselves.
Mr. L.
proposed to trace the vegetation of the district in three divisions, which will accord as well with 
the superficial aspect of the country as with its geological character ; and it will then be more readily seen 
what influence (if any) the nature of the soil exercises upon the habitats of the various plants found within its 
boundaries.
The first division comprises the flat country eastward of the hills to the Severn, whose course, setting aside 
curvatui-es, is nearly parallel to the Malvern chain, the distance from the river varying in the space between 
Worcester and Tewkesbury, from five to about seven miles.
The whole of this plain consists of red marl, 
with deposits of diluvial gravel in various places close to or to vnthin short distances of the river.
To the 
South of Upton several isolated hills of lias limestone occui-, and North of that town various tabular or ra- 
ther roof-shaped hills of red marl, more or less covered with wood, run parallel with the Severn, and beauti- 
fully diversify the scene.
Even nearer the hUls, especially southwards, many fortress-like eminences start 
up in a picturesque manner, and, robed with foliage, greatiy relieve the tame flat that would otherwise present 
itself.
The drainage of the whole district is received by the Severn, even from the limestone on the western 
side of the ridge ; for the Ledden, that, flowing past Ledbury, collects the streams from the southward, after a 
further course of ten or twelve miles flows into the Severn at Gloucester.
Throughout the whole eastern 
plain no lake or even pool of any striking dimensions occurs, but the streams that flow from the hills in the 
direction of Eldersfield, the Berrow and Longdon, being precluded from reaching the Severn directly by the 
intervention of steep banks of marl, and having only one ouUet to that river with scarcely any fall, necessa- 
rily accumulate in the flat meadows, forming marshes of considerable extent and entu-ely overflowed in the 
autumnal season.
Many efforts have been made to drain these marshes, and deep ditches beset them on 
eveiy side ; but having only one sluggish outlet, and being in fact in many places below the level of the bed 
of the Severn, it appears impracticable to provide an adequate drainage for them.
However, the boundaries 
of the marshes have doubtless been much restricted of late years, for Mr. L.
was informed that within the 
memory of persons stiU in existence, the ague was a common complaint in all the neighbouring parishes, but 
is now almost unknown ; and the author had met with men who could tell tales of thii-ty yeai-s ago or more, 
when the ignis fatims or wild-fire has led them a strange midnight dance, though now unseen for many a day.
Mr. Lees proposed to treat of the two other divisions in futui'e papers ; and the present paper concluded 
with a copious list of habitats, and specimens of aU the plants (many of which were exhibited) are deposited 
in the Society's herbarium : and it is the intention of Mr. L.
to send the Society specimens of all the plants 
(including Cryptogamia) in the Malvern district.
The following are the habitats of some of the interesting plants.
Isatis tinctoria : On a precipitous clifi" of red marl forming the left bank of the Severn, immediately op- 
posite Sam Hill, at a place called the Mythe, one mile North of Tewkesbury, and a few hundred yards from 
the new iron bridge over the river.
Mr. L.
had noticed this plant here for above twenty years.
Koniga ma- 
ritima : Near the chalybeate well.
Great Malvern : found in August 1 841.
Vicia Bithynica : In a field East 
of Malvern Wells, between the Admiral Benbow and Benbow's Farm-house.
In the original edition of 'Eng- 
lish Botany,' Dr. Abbot is said to have gathered it a few miles to the North of Great Malvern.
Smiirninm 
Olusainim : On the red marl cliff" at the Mythe Tout above Tewkesbury, close to the Severn, where some un- 
derwood extends up the acclivity.
Iris fcetidissima : On Sam hiU, near Forthampton, very luxuriant.
Also at Cruckbarrow, South of Worcester, and on the BeiTOw hill, two miles from the southern end of Mal- 
vern chain eastwards.
Crocus vcrtnis : Battenhall, a litfle South of Worcester.
Dijjsaciis jrihsus : Below 
the Abbey, Malvern, eastward, and Bubble Brook, Worcester.
Verbascum BlaUaria : Fonhampton, and 
between that place and Longdon.
Siiiecio sgualidus : Old buttresses, Worcester.
Delphinium Consoli-

LOCALITIES.
England.
\ 
Scotland l'^" ^^ lakes of all our mountain districts.
Ireland, j 
The Quillwort, thougli confined to our mountain lakes, is an abun- 
dant plant in such situations, clothing the bottoms of the deep and 
still waters with a perennial verdure, and supposed by the casual tour- 
ist to be a submerged grass.
In the North of England it occurs 
abundantly; and I am indebted to Miss Beever, of Coniston, for an 
abundant supply of living specimens from that neighbourhood : had 
it not been for that lady's kind and timely assistance, I should have 
been unable to draw up a satisfactory description of this curious plant; 
since in dried specimens many interesting characters are lost.
In 
Ireland and Scotland I observed it more or less abundantly in every 
lake I had an opportunity of searching.
In Caeman^onshire I have found it in more than a dozen of the 
little lakes which abound in the Snowdon range, and this appears to 
have been one of the earliest recorded habitats.
It was found in Og- 
wen, Lyn-y-Cwn, and the Lakes of Llanberis, by Llhwyd, Ray, Rich- 
ardson and Dillenius, the latter of whom waded into the waters of 
Llanberis purposely to find it.
The imagination of a botanist delights 
to picture the Sherardian professor in this interesting situation ; his 
shoes, with their enormous silver buckles, and his grey-ribbed hose, 
are seen reposing on the strand ; his important bag wig and his for- 
midable military hat, sharply looped on three several sides, adorn his 
learned head ; the ample skirts of his coat are gathered on one arm, 
whilst the other hand grasps a gold-headed cane, wherewith to uproot 
the brittle Calamaria.
I will quote the entire passage in which this 
adventure is recorded ; the mention of uncomfortable lodgings will be 
amusing to those modem botanists who have feasted in the palace-like 
hotel, now standing almost on the site of the philosopher's pathetic 
lamentation.
" I found the common Suhularia folio rigido, mention- 
ed to grow only in Phynon Vreech, and the Juncifolia coclilearics 
capsidis* pretty plentifully, which relieved me very much of our dis- 
appointment of not seeing more Glyder plants.
In the lake near 
Llanberis, a little further on, where you found the Suhularia fragilis, 
folio longiore et tenuiore, cast out of the lake, I pulled oif my shoes 
and stockings, and found it growing there in great plenty.
If any 
* " Subularia aquatica," [.S'm.] 
155 
body had the means of fishing out plants from the depths of these 
lakes, I am inclined to think he might find strange things.
Near this 
place, about three years ago, Mr. Evans, coming home late from a 
christening, in stormy and rainy weather, was drowned.
His corpse 
could not be found by any means used for fishing.
There being no 
parson living at the jDlace at present, it is almost impossible for any 
body to go herborizing thither.
We had very hard and uncomforta- 
ble lodging at the alehouse, and with difficulty got a young man to be 
our interpreter and guide.
At last young Mr. Evans, of Bangor, gave 
us leave to lie at his house, and sent us provisions from Bangor.
" If some rich botanist, that has no relations or children, would 
build a house there, and buy some land to it, which might be done 
with little money, it would be a very kind invitation for botanists to 
visit these strange places, and be an inducement for making a collec- 
tion of Welsh plants, as you proposed.
Without such a fixed place 
of abode, it seems to me impracticable." * 
Dillenius learned from the mountaineers of the neighbourhood, that 
fish feed on the Isoetes ; and that when detached from its hold in the 
soil and cast on shore, the cattle devour it greedily and grow fat on it.f 
The passage is rather obscurely worded, and its meaning seems to 
have been mistaken by compilers, who make it fatten the fish, and 
leave the bullocks out of the question.
The figures by Dillenius are striking, but in some points scarcely 
accurate.
That in the ' Flora Danica' (191) possesses none of the 
characteristics which distinguish the root of our British species, and 
this part of the drawing is either supplied from imagination or drawn 
from a species hitherto undiscovered in this country.
The same ob- 
servation applies to the figure of the capsule in ' English Botany,' 
(1084), where that part is represented as bivalved.
Sir W.
J. Hook- 
er's figure in the ' Flora Londinensis ' is the best that I have seen, 
but in this there is an indistinctness in the representation of the tuber, 
and a reference to certain scales on the capsule, the existence of 
which I have been altogether unable to detect.
In Loudon's * Ency- 
clopaedia of Plants' (894), the capsule of Pilularia is given as that of 
Isoetes, and that of the latter is entirely omitted.
The roots are three or four inches in length, flexible, semipellucid, 
of uniform substance, tubular, and sometimes dichotomously divided

towards the extremity.
They spring from a tuber, which, in mature 
plants, is about the size of a hazel-nut.
This tuber seems analogous 
to what I have called a tufted rhizoma in ferns : it is of various form, 
commonly, however, slightly bilobed ; its external coating is spongy, 
and of a dark brown colour approaching to 
black, and apparently composed of decayed 
portions of its substance : the interior is 
very compact and of a pure white, with a 
small and nearly pellucid portion in the cen- 
tre, whence the leaves appear to originate.
The taste of this tuber is earthy, but not 
otherwise remarkable, and it seems perfectly 
innoxious, as I have eaten several without 
injury.
A longitudinal section of the tu- 
ber {t t) with its attached radicles, is shown 
in the margin.
Wahlenberg says that this 
tuber vegetates in the interior while dying 
round the circumference,* a mode of ac- 
counting for its appearance which seems 
highly probable.
The leaves are sessile, and rise from the 
crown of the tuber ; at the base they are 
very broad, and furnished with membranous 
margins, which clasp the inner leaves much 
in the same manner as the scales of a hly- 
bulb.
With the exception of this basal 
portion, the leaves are nearly cylindrical, 
sometimes however approaching to a quad- 
rate form, with obtuse angles, and termi- 
nating in a sharp point ; they are hollow, 
the interior being divided by longitudinal 
septa into four tubes, which are again sub- 
divided into numerous compartments by 
transverse septa placed at irregular distan- 
ces : these transverse septa are very apparent through the semi-pellu- 
cid substance of the leaf, and give it a jointed appearance.
The 
leaves are extremely brittle, and usually break at these apparent joints.
They are persistent, â€” the plant being in every respect an evergreen, 
whence the Linnean name of IsoeteSy\ signifying that its appearance

is alike throughout the year.
The exterior leaves decay slowly and 
in order of priority, the decay commencing in each leaf about an inch 
above the crown of the rhizoma and extending upwards and down- 
wards ; the decayed portion soon loses its rigidity, the upper part 
bending over and becoming prostrate.
The leaf retains its at- 
tachment long after its vitality has ceased ; and numerous leaves so 
attached fall over the tuber and its radicles when the plant is taken 
from the water, and, mingling with the latter, are preserved as such 
in most of our herbaria.
Leaves in a state of decay are shown in the 
figure at the head of this article.
The fnictification of the Quillwort is very curious.
It consists of 
capsules or thecal, about the size of swan-shot, placed singly at the 
base of each leaf, in the very substance of which they are imbedded ; 
only a very small portion of the capsule being visible through a circu- 
lar aperture in the anterior face of the leaf.
In this structure alone 
does it differ fi-om Lycopodium, in which genus the theca is quite 
distinct, although perfectly sessile in the axil of the leaf, and remov- 
able without injury to the leaf itself.
The sub- 
stance of the theca is hard though membranous ; 
it is attached at a single point {b) on its posterior 
surface, to something which appears analogous 
to a midrib of the leaf The figvu-e in the mar- 
gin represents a theca removed from its cavity in 
the leaf: from its point of attachment (b) arise 
what appear to be two free placentae {a a), for the 
attachment of the seeds, yet I cannot positively assert that such is 
their office, for I have never opened a theca without observing that 
the seeds escaped, as if entirely without attachment.
Wahlenberg 
speaks of these bodies as being many;* from this statement, and that 
author's surpassing accuracy, I am inclined to suppose the few theca) 
which I have had the opportunity of examining in a recent state to 
be exceptions to the general mle, especially as in the generic charac- 
ter of Isoetes in 'English Flora' (iv.
343), Sir J.
E. Smith describes 
the capsule of the fertile flowers as having " several transverse bris- 
tle-shaped bars." The seeds themselves are rugose and perfectly 
white ; they have raised ridges on the surface, indicating a quadruple 
division ; indeed, when thus divided, the inferior half of each seed is 
nearly hemispherical, and the superior half may be again divided into 
* Ex illo receplaculo fructus longitudinali oiiuutur plura receptacula scminum scu 
narlialia fiiliformia, &;c.

three sub-triangular portions.
When crushed, even after the lapse of 
years, these seeds are found to be filled with a transparent and some- 
what oleaginous fluid.
Other thecse contain apparent seeds, which 
are extremely minute, being scarcely equal in size to the pollen-gra- 
nules of many flowering plants : these minute bodies possess the form 
and characters of the larger seeds.
The thecae containing the two kinds 
of seed are scarcely to be distinguished from each other, nor do they 
follow any law in their relative position, as many of our botanists have 
asserted, but most frequently occur alternately.
Linneus, in his ' Iter 
Scanicum,' has described these as male and female flowers, * but bo- 
tanists are not agreed as to their precise nature, the question, when 
discussed, must comprise the kindred twofold fructification of Lycopo- 
dium Selaginoides, and probably many other species : the real nature 
of the four portions into which each (supposed) seed is divisable, also 
requires further investigation.
I am too superficial a botanist to ofier 
an opinion on so important a subject.
Mr. Valentine, whose valuable paper on the structure and develop- 
ment of the organs of Pilularia, in the 18th vol.
of the Linnean Trans- 
actions, has already been noticed in this work (Phytol, 55), has made 
some interesting observations on the germination of Isoetes, which I 
hope may eventually be given to the public.
There are two forms of Isoetes, so difi"erent that Dillenius, and, in 
some of his works, even Linneus, treat them as distinct species ; thus 
in the passage quoted fi-om Dillenius, at p.
154, they are designated 
"Subularia folio rigido" and "Subularia fiagilis;" and in his great 
work, the 'Historia Muscorum,' the same author describes them as 
"The short and thick-leaved Quillwort, Calamaria folio breviore et 
crassiore," and "The long and slender-leaved Quillwort, Calamaria 
folio longiore et graciliore ; " and enters very clearly into theh distin- 
guishing characters.f The following paragraph from a letter of Lin- 
neus to Haller, written in 1749 and printed in Smith's 'Selection of

the Correspondence of Linnaeus, &c.' ii.
433, proves that this great 
botanist considered the two forms to be species.
â€” " In Scania I have 
met with the flowers, male as well as female, of both species of Ca- 
lamistrum, figured by Dillenius, in his Historia Muscorum, by the 
name of Calamaria.'''' 
Gray, in his * Natural AiTangement of British Plants,' makes two 
varieties in addition to the normal form of the plant, and describes 
them as follows.

By a reference to Ray* it will be seen that this Subularia fragilis is an 
addition by Dillenius, and is doubtless identical with the Calamaria 
folio longiore &c.
of that author ; the forms are thus again reduced to 
two, and concerning these Mr. Wilson, who has paid great attention 
to the subject, kindly sends me his opinion in the following words.
" The solitary plants with short spreading leaves, I believe to be the 
first fiill development after the seedling state, and before any lateral 
extension of the rhizoma has taken place : when the plants are crowd- 
ed together, either by lateral increase (or offsets) or by a multitude of 
individuals in close contact, the fironds can grow only in an erect pos- 
ture.
In a specimen from Llyn Ogwen, the tallest I have, and which 
I cut through the middle before drying, the section of the rhizoma or 
tuber is very large, while in another specimen, gathered in the same 
place, and at the same time, the rhizoma is very small and inconspi- 
cuous ; in a third specimen the rhizoma is very broad and concave at 
the base.
The size of the tuber may depend on the age and vigour 
of the plant ; its analogy with the rhizoma of ferns I think consider- 
able : when a number of the outer or lower fironds have ripened and 
dropped off, then and not before it becomes exposed to view." 
Mr. Sansom has given the two supposed species a minute and care- 
ful examination, and has favoured me with the following remarks.
â€” 
" In the diffuse variety the seeds are globular or nearly so, and the su- 
tures in many cases very indistinct, while in the erect plant the seeds 
are angular, the angles appearing to be formed by the swelling of the 
edges of the sutures, and thus giving it an angular appearance.
Again, 
the texture of the seed is different ; in the diffuse plant it has a slight- 
ly pellucid appearance, while, in the erect variety, they are of a firmer 
* Syn. Ed.

160 
texture, appearing quite white and homy." Mr. Sansom, however, 
suggests, with great propriety, the probability of the seeds which he 
examined being in different stages of maturity ; those which I have 
examined do not exhibit the differences which he has pointed out.
The following definitions appear to me to express the distinguish- 
ing characters of the two forms, 
a. Normal form.
Fronds 6 to 15 in number, 2 to 5 inches in length, spreading, 
very brittle : tuber as large as a hazel-nut, slightly bilobed ; radicles about as 
long as the leaves, rarely divided.
This form is represented in the figure at the 
head of this article ; the full length of the radicles being shown at p.
156.
/3.
Slender form.
Fronds 20 or more in number, 12 or 18 inches long, very erect 
and compact together : tuber very small, mostly to be distinguished with diffi- 
culty ; radicles less than one fourth the length of the leaves, frequently divided.
The two forms grow together in the lakes of England, Scotland 
and Wales.

â€” List of Plants found in Devonshire 8f Cornwall, not men- 
tioned by Jones in the Flora Devoniensis, with remarks on the 
rarer Species.
By The Rev. W.
S. Hore, M.A., F.L.S., G.S.* 
Communicated by Edwin Lankester, M.D., F.L.S., F.B.S.E.
It was my intention to have prepared a list of the plants indigenous to the coun- 
ties of Devon and Cornwall, accompanied with remarks on the rarer species, but when 
I considered that a Flora of the former county existed, published about twelve years 
since, I detenuined on limiting my observations to an enumeration of such species as 
have since been discovered in Devon, and those which are found in Cornwall, but 
which have not been met with in the sister county.
The latter are so few in number, 
that Jones's ' Flora Devoniensis ' may be considered as a Flora of the two western 
counties, and the whole district, when geographically viewed, would induce us to ar- 
rive at the conclusion that much discrepancy could not possibly exist in their natural 
productions.
In the eastern portion of Devon, where the geological aspect of the 
county begins to merge into the newer formations of Dorsetshire and Hampshire, we 
might indeed be inclined to expect a more distinctly marked vegetation, and some 
plants not to be found towards its western limits ; this however is not the case, for with 
the exception of that singularly rare plant â€” Lobelia urens, which is confined to the 
neighbourhood of Axminster, no distinct plants have as yet been detected.
A similar 
result obtains with reference to the interior part of the county, where, notwithstanding 
some of the torrs of Dartmoor reach the lower limits of the Upland Region of Watson, 
no plants characteristic of that region have been discovered, except Listera cordata, 
recently found by Mr, Ward, on Coddon Hill, near Barnstaple.
We may therefore view these two western counties, with a portion of Somerset, i.
e. 
Exmoor and its vicinity, as forming one large botanical district, connecting England

with Brittany and Normandy by means of the Channel Islands, and manifesting such 
connection by the following plants : â€” Trichonema Columnae, Iris fcetidissima, Aspleni- 
um lanceolatum, Erodium moschatum, Herniaria ciliata, Scilla autumnalis, Arthrolo- 
bium ebracteatum, Lotus angustissimus, Hypericum linariifolium, &c.
To enter into a 
detailed account of the geological aspect of the district would be superfluous, as Jones 
in his Flora has been at some pains to describe it accurately as regards Devon, and 
with the exception of the serpentine of the Lizard, the same remarks may be supposed 
equally applicable to the county of Cornwall.
The number of Phanerogamous species described in the ' Flora Devonensis,' 
amounts to 774 : to these must be added 41, for species since detected in the same 
county, or separated from others of which they were supposed to be mere varieties.
Of these 41, 15 are also found in Cornwall.
There are also 31 species peculiar to the 
latter county, not natives of Devon.
The western Flora would therefore contain 846 
species, â€” a number certainly not too great for the extent of surface included within its 
limits, and the variety of soil and other peculiarities which it presents.
Jones adopts the Linnaean classification, which, for convenience, I shall now follow 
in enumerating the additions &c.
made since the publication of his work.
Veronica Buxbaumii, Ten. Occurs both in Devon and Cornwall, but not abun- 
dantly : it appears limited to the fields which have been recently ploughed, and disap- 
pears in a season or two.
Veronica polita.

Pinguicula vulgaris^ Linn.
Mr. Ward found this plant in a bog near Ilfracombe, 
on the road to Morthoe.
I had previously heard that it grew there.
Trichonema Columna, Reich.

No plants were found 
there last year.
Fedia Auricula, Gaud.
Lindulph, Cornwall, according to the Rev. Mr.
Bree.
Bolt Head, Devon, Mr. Babington.
Scirpus Holoschcenus, Linn.
Jones says of this plant that it is now probably exter- 
minated at Braunton Burrows, its only habitat, by draining and cultivation, as a search 
for it in the summer of 1820 was unsuccessful.
Watson, in his Botanist's Guide, 
gives the following directions : â€” " Braunton Bun'ows, in hollows or flats among the 
sand hills.
The keeper of the light-house knows the plant, and pointed out one of 
the stations to me about half a mile to the right of the light-house." I easily found 
this spot last autumn, which I believe to be the only one where the plant is now to be 
found.
Miss Hill writes me concerning it as follows: â€” " The large spot where those 
rushes grew is now covered with blown sand, but a new place has been found.
I do not 
think the present plants so large as those I have collected at the old spot thirty years 
since, and much within that time." 
Cyperus longus, Linn.
Miss Warren informs me that it grows near Truro, Cornwall.

Brachypodium pinnatum, Beauv.
I have never seen this plant in Devon, where 
Jones says it is common.

This plant was discovered some years 
since by my friend Mr. Johns, hut has now disappeared.
As it has since been found 
in cultivated fields in this neighbourhood, I fear that it can hardly be recognized as 
indigenous.
Exacum filiforme, Sm. Jones gives Stackhouse, a Cornish botanist, as his author- 
ity for considering this species as Devonian, who says it is more common in this county 
than in any other.
Stackhouse must have mistaken some other plant for it.

â€” Notice of ' The London Journal of Botany,^ being a 
New Series of ' The Journal of Botany.' By Sir W, J.
Hooker.
London : Bailliere, Regent Street.
It is with feelings of unmingled satisfaction that we announce the present spi- 
rited recommencement of this invaluable work.
While we are endeavouring to render 
our pages as popular as scientific accuracy will permit ; and while we avowedly give 
the preference to everything connected with British Botany, the * Journal ' must at- 
tract those laborious and erudite papers, which, although invaluable as works of refe- 
rence, are scarcely calculated for the hasty perusal of those readers who seek in a pe- 
riodical the passing information â€” the botanical chit-chat of the day : it must also 
continue to obtain those minutely descriptive latin lists of exotic novelties which have 
hitherto rendered its pages so acceptable to the technical botanist.
Our little ephe- 
meral will be contented with those lighter contributions â€” those unstudied brevities 
and observations which, delightful though they be to ourselves and to numbers of our 
readers, would detract from the scientific dignity of the graver ' Journal.' 
Thus each of these botanicals will take what the other is glad to give, and so pro- 
mote the prosperity of its friendly rival.
Influenced by these feelings, we wish the 
" New Series " every success ; and though our naiTow limits preclude the possibility 
of giving anything like an analysis of the numbers as they appear, we purpose always 
giving a list of the articles, and occasionally transferring to our chapter of ''Varieties" 
any paragraph relating to British Botany, which we think vdll be interesting to our 
readers.

Enquiry respecting Sieher''s ' Synopsis Filicum?
Is it in accordance with the 
plan of ' The Phytologist ' to make such an enquiry as the following to the readers of 
that useful periodical ?
On Sieber's return from Martinique and the West India 
Islands, he brought back a number of specimens of ferns, an account of which was 
published under the title of ' Synopsis Filicum,' and numbered.
This is not the ' Sy- 
nopsis Filicum ' of Swartz, and I suspect it was a paper published in some foreign 
periodical.
Can any of your readers inform me where Sieber's ' Synopsis Filicum ' is 
to be met with ?
Sieber's ferns are well known, and his ' Syn. Fil.' is referred to by 
Kaulfuss and Presl ; but I can nowhere meet with any account of it.
Sieber's name 
is mentioned as an authority in the Addenda to Linnseus's ' Systema Vegetabilium,' 
edited by Sprengel, or the second part of the 4th vol.
â€” J.
Riley ; Papplewick, October 
28, 1841.
[Mr. W.
Pamplin has kindly sent us the following reply to the above enquiry ; we 
shall be glad to receive further information on the subject from any correspondent].
Sieber''s Ferns.
To the best of my belief the citation of " Sieber, Synopsis 
Filicum," in Presl, Sprengel, and others, does not apply to any printed publication, but 
rather to the numbers upon the printed tickets which accompany his collections of 
specimens distributed among individual purchasers.

Death of J.
E. Bowman, Esq., F.L.S., F.G.S., Src The readers of the Neivs 
will perceive in our obituary of this week the death of our estimable and respected 
townsman, John Eddowes Bowman, Esq., which melancholy event took place at his 
residence near Manchester.
The Manchester Guardian of the 1 Ith instant pays the 
following just tribute to the benevolent character and literary acquirements of the 
deceased, and which we insert in preference to giving any lengthened eulogy of our 
o^n : â€” " The death of this very intelligent and excellent gentleman , which was noticed 
in our last number, will be a great loss to science.
He was indefatigable in the pur- 
suit of knowledge, and his time and talents were most willingly devoted to its advance- 
ment.
In his botanical and geological investigations he displayed a perseverance, 
activity, and acuteness, seldom surpassed ; and he had no greater pleasure than in the 
discovery and communication of any new fact illustrative of the wisdom, power, or 
benevolence of the Deity.
Soon after the commencement of his residence in Man- 
chester, he became intimately acquainted with the dififerent cultivators of kindred 
studies : and by the activity of his mind, and his zeal for the promotion of knowledge, 
no less than by the accuracy and solidity of his own acquirements, proved one of the 
most valuable and efficient members of the principal scientific institutions of this 
town and neighbourhood.
His exemption from the absorbing avocations of business 
enabled him to concentrate his whole attention on objects of science, and to afford a 
kind and degree of assistance in promoting them, which few others had it in their 
power to give, and which it will not be easy to replace.
To those who had the happi- 
ness of enjoying his private friendship he was endeared by the amiable cheerfulness 
167 
and simplicity of his manners, by his unaffected readiness to communicate informa- 
tion, and by his generous ardour in behalf of every object and institution connected 
with the diffusion of knowledge, and with the extension of the means of human 
â€¢virtue and happiness.
Those who knew him most intimately can best appreciate his 
genuine piety and benevolence of heart, which formed the animating principle of his 
character, and pervaded every relation of his domestic life.
By his associates in the 
Literary and Philosophical, the Natural History and Geological Societies of Man- 
chester, his memory will be warmly cherished ; and his death will be deeply regretted 
by the most distinguished members of the British Association, especially when they 
assemble in this town next year.
His communications to the transactions of the 
Linnean, Geological, and other Societies, will fonn lasting evidence of his acquire- 
ments, and valuable memorials to his relatives and friends." â€” From the Shrewsbury 
News of Saturday, December 18, 1841.

Locality of Trifolium stellatum.
It will be satisfactory to your correspondent 
Mr. Salmon (Phytol.
p. 130), to learn that Trifolium stellatum is not lost at Shore- 
ham, but still comes up in abundance every spring in its first-observed station â€” a low 
line of ballast-heaps, deposited, I am assured, before any present inhabitant of Shore- 
ham can recollect, between the river and the wide bed of shingle on the seaward side 
of the river, overagainst the east end of the town.
The plant flowers early, and a less 
abundant second crop is usually to be seen in the latter summer months.
I once, 
several years ago, met with a few specimens among the shingle, overagainst South- 
wick; and again, on a part, now occupied by a quay, of the landward shore of the ri- 
ver, at Kingston.
The immediate neighbourhood produces several plants worthy of 
notice, which Mr. Salmon has not enumerated ; among them are Salicoruia radicans, 
Poa bulbosa, distans, procumbens and Borreri, Festuca uniglumis, Medicago denticu- 
lata and Borkhausia fcetida.
Vicia bithynica, which grew formerly near Southwick, is 
now, I fear, lost ; as well as Chrysocoma Linosyris, of which Mr. Trevelyan found a single 
plant about 1825.
Of the plants mentioned by Mr. Salmon, I never saw there Statice 
spathulata, Juncus acutus or Coronopus didyma.
The first of these grows near Rot- 
tingdean ; the other two in the West of Sussex.

Anagallis arvensis and ccerulea.
Five or six years ago I planted a root of the 
latter in a garden, and saved the seed, which I sowed the following spring; a consi- 
derable number of the plants now come up annually from self-sown seed, but always 
with blue corollas ; not a single specimen of the red variety ever making its appear- 
ance in the garden.

Note on Crocus vernus and C.
nudiflorus.
It may probably be no uncommon 
thing to meet with individual specimens of the wild Crocus having more than the 
regular number of stamens, divisions of the perianth, &c., but as I am not aware 
whether this is the case, I wish to mention that in March last, when I visited the Not- 
tingham meadows for the long-desired pleasure of gathering Crocus vernus, I met 
with three specimens having four stamens, four lobes to the stigma and eight segments 
to the perianth ; also one, having five stamens, five lobes to the stigma and ten seg- 
ments to the perianth.
Can you or any of your correspondents inform me whether 
the leaves of Crocus nudiflorus are to be looked for at the same time as the flowers of 
C. vernus, or late in the autumn after its own flowering ?
I saw many large patches 
of leaves, indeed the turf of the meadows seemed in great measure composed of them, 
and I hoped that they might belong to C.
nudiflorus, but on digging for the roots, 
they were apparently too young for flowering, and differing in no respect hut greater 
168 
height from those of the flowering roots around, I fear my hopes were ill founded.
I 
do not know that I ever saw a more lovely sight than those meadows presented in 
their spring attire; they were literally "glowing with beauty." â€” Anna Worsley ; 
Brislington, February 1, 1842.

Notes on Linaria spuria and L.
Elatine.
In your number for the present 
month (Phytol.
137) are some remarks on a monstrous form of Linaria spuria, by Mr.
Buckman.
I should not have adverted to these remarks, as the monstrosity in ques- 
tion is of no rare occurrence, being in fact analogous to the same deformity in the 
flowers of Linaria vulgaris called Peloria, but that Mr. Buckman's observations are 
coupled vpith the additional assertion that L.
spuria and Elatine are probably forms 
of one species, he having traced the identity through " numberless intermediate sta- 
ges." Now if Mr. Buckman's observations are correct, the fact derived from them is 
one of great interest, and should serve as an additional warning to the manufacturers 
of species to proceed more leisurely for the future, in the use of the first and two last 
rules of Cocker's Arithmetic.
But I am strongly inclined to suspect Mr. Buckman 
of having too hastily assumed his premises ; and I think the source of error may be 
traced in limine from the close resemblance Linaria spuria and Elatine bear to each 
other in the conformation of their lower leaves when young, these being often rounded 
in the latter as well as in the former, for a considerable distance upwards, and in both 
usually more or less notched.
I have frequently been deceived myself by the similar- 
ity of configuration, but I have never seen either plant when more advanced exhibit- 
ing any such ambiguity of structure as to create a doubt to which species it belonged, 
though I have carefully and repeatedly examined each kind in its native localities and 
in various parts of England, with a view, if possible, of determining a question which 
their close afiinity naturally suggested to me.
Both Linaria spuria and L.
Elatine are 
very abundant in the Isle of Wight ; the latter may be found in every field, afi"ecting 
equally our stiff clays as well as our calcareous soils ; the former confining itself more 
exclusively to the chalk, or where the subsoil is of that formation.
In many places 
in the island the two grow intermixed, and sometimes in such abundance as nearly to 
cover the ground, L.
spuria predominating over its congener.
Yet in such localities 
I have uniformly failed in tracing any intermediate gradations between these nearly 
allied species, under circumstances the most favourable to the elimination of every 
possible variety of form and structure ; hence, till proof has been brought foiivard to 
the contrary, I am j ustified in considering them truly distinct.
This view of the case 
is strengthened by the geographical distribution of each species ; an element, I con- 
ceive, of much greater importance than is usually supposed in determining the validity 
of specific difference, though to be adduced as collateral rather than as positive evi- 
dence in most instances.
L. Elatine has a much more extended range in this coun- 
try and on the continent than L.
spuria, which is a decidedly more southern species.
The limits of the first may be stated to be a little below 55Â° in England, and it ranges 
as far as Ireland to the westward, where however it is very local, if really indigenous.
In Scotland it has not hitherto occurred at all, though from part of that country lying 
under its limitrophe parallel in England, it will probably be found ere long to inhabit 
the southern counties.
On the continent L.
Elatine extends somewhat higher, namely, 
into the South of Sweden as far as 56", or a little beyond that parallel in Scania and 
CEland, where, as in Scotland and Ireland, L.
spuria is quite wanting.
The bounda- 
ries of this last may be assumed at about 54" in England (Malton corn-fields, York- 
shire ?), beyond which its occurrence on rubbish and ballast heaps must be considered 
169 
as merely fortuitous, and it sensibly diminishes in frequency in all the western coun- 
ties, nor does it reach, like L.
Elatine, to any part of the sister kingdom.
On the 
continent L.
spuria has apparently the same limits to the northward as with us, being 
absent from Denmark proper, though found in the neighbouring dutchy of Holstein 
under the same parallel as Yorkshire.
As I have already remarked, L.
spuria is more 
attached to certain soils, and to tillage lands, being rarely seen beyond the limits of 
cultivation, whilst L.
Elatine I have repeatedly gathered, though sparingly, in places 
very dissimilar and remote from ai'able ground, even on heaths and in spongy bogs, 
by ditch-banks, &c.
The Peloria form has not come under my notice in the Isle of 
Wight, but I have gathered it in corn land near Winchester, affecting both the spe- 
cies alike, and exactly in the way Mr. Buckman describes.
It now only remains 
that I should notice the possibility that Mr. Buckman's " intermediate stages " may 
have resulted from cross impregnation, an accident to which plants of this natural 
order seem peculiarly liable, witness Scrophularia, Verbascum, &c.
We have a beau- 
tiful hybrid occasionally produced in the Isle of Wight, between Linaria repens and 
L. vulgaris ; it is therefore by no means unlikely that the same thing may happen 
with two other species of the genus still more nearly allied.
The subject is well worth 
Mr. Buckman's investigation ; and it is to be hoped that he will favour your pages with 
whatever conclusions he may hereafter arrive at.

4, 1842.

Note on ike British species of Tilia.
I was extremely glad to read the very 
interesting account of our native species of Tilia, communicated by Mr. Leighton in 
the words of Mr. Jorden, with further remarks by the former gentleman, (Phytol.
147); 
and they have, I think, like able counsel, made out a plain case in favour of their cli- 
ents' claim to the rights of citizenship.
Till I saw Mr. Jorden's account in your pa- 
ges, I was disposed to believe the small-leaved lime (Tilia parvifolia) the only species 
really indigenous to this country, never having met with the broad-leaved ones in any 
situation where they had a perfectly wild appearance; but the distribution of the three 
species on the continent of Europe, in conjunction with the decided testimony of Mr.
Jorden to their spontaneous growth in Worcestershire &c., has almost entirely, if not ab- 
solutely, removed my previous scepticism, I must however premise, that from some 
varieties I have observed in these trees, I am not without suspicions that Tilia parvi- 
folia and grandifolia are the two extremities of a series, of which T.
europaea is a mid- 
dle link; but to substantiate this view of the subject would require much stronger 
evidence than I am able to bring forward at this moment.
The genus Tilia seems to 
have its metropolis in the cooler portion of the temperate zone, a few species extend- 
ing into the warmer parts only, where the increase of temperature is modified by hu- 
midity of soil or elevation.
Tilia parvifolia is the most northern form or species, and 
the only one found native in Norway, Sweden, and the northern provinces of the Rus- 
sian empire, ranging in Scandinavia to 63" 30', and in Russia to at least 60", being 
frequent in woods about St. Petersburg.
The broad-leaved species, T.
europaea and 
grandifolia, predominate in the vast forests that cover the extensive plains of central 
and eastern Europe between 55" and 50", in Poland, Lithuania, and the more southern 
governments of Russia, where Pallas tells us ('Flora Rossica') the small-leaved lime 
(T.
parvifolia) is rarely met with.
The famous honey of Konow in Lithuania is ga- 
thered by the bees from the blossoms of a broad-leaved lime, which is there said to 
constitute entire forests, and is doubtless the same species as that of the bark of which 
the Russian bast or matting is manufactured.
Proceeding farther south, we find in 
O 
170 
Fiance, Switzerland, and the North of Italy, the three forms or species of the lime- 
tree affecting elevated or even mountainous situations, rarely descending into the plains 
unless favoured by concomitant humidity and consequent diminution of temperature.
In these parts the small-leaved lime is almost supplanted by those of more ample fo- 
liage.
From the consideration of their geographical distribution from north to south, 
there seems no reason why all these three species or varieties of the lime should not occur 
wild in Britain, but local causes may combine to give predominance to one oi other of 
them in particular.
Thus the general low average of our summer temperature, re- 
sulting from the combined moisture and cloudiness of the atmosphere, even in the 
South of England, may and indeed does dispose to the production of northern species 
or varieties under parallels of latitude which, in countries where the sun's influence is 
less impaired by absorption of his rays in passing through a misty medium, or the ac- 
tual interception both of heat and light by dense masses of vapour, would rather favour 
the development of southern forms of vegetation.
We are geographically nearer the 
wine region of Europe than to any part of the Scandinavian peninsula along our sou- 
thern coast, yet does the character of our vegetation partake more of a northern type 
than would be inferred from the consideration of latitude alone.
I believe also our 
entomological productions approximate more to those of Sweden and Denmark than 
to the same tribes in France or Germany.
In accordance with these facts we might 
expect that of all the three species of Tilia native to Britain, the small-leaved lime 
(T.
parvifolia) would predominate with us, as being the more frequent one towards the 
north, and such appears to be the case.
I can vouch to having seen T.
parvifolia truly 
wild and abundant between Halstead and Sudbury, in various places along the road 
in hedge-rows and copses, and I found a wood between Bury and the village of Whep- 
stead, about six miles distant, quite full of this species, but kept down by periodical 
lopping to the dimensions of a shrub.
Mr. Abraham of Exeter told me that there 
were woods of T.
parvifolia about Buckleigh in Devonshire, which Mr. H.
C. Watson 
seems to think adverse to the idea of its being indigenous there, a conclusion the very 
reverse of that I should arrive at, since this species is by far the least ornamental of 
all our limes, and of little or no value as timber, nor have I ever heard of its being 
planted to any extent for copsewood.
The very large wood of T.
parvifolia near 
Shrawley in Worcestershire, mentioned by Mr. Lees, is another instance in point, were 
farther proof wanting to substantiate the claim of this species at least to rank as na- 
tive with us, which was the opinion moreover of the cautious and scrutinizing Ray, as 
also of Evelyn.
I would suggest whether Lyndhurst in the New Forest, may not be 
derived from a wood (hurst) of limes (linden) now no longer existing, as I find both 
T. parvifolia and europsea in old hedgerows about Lymington occasionally, which is 
not very distant from the former place, but I dare not venture to pronounce either cer- 
tainly indigenous there.
Evelyn seems to hint at the existence of Tilia europtea as a 
native tree, when he speaks of our wild limes as having " a somewhat smaller leaf" 
than the cultivated, and as apt to be civilized !
that is, improved or made larger by 
transplanting, Gerarde, too, if I remember right (for he is not now at my elbow to 
ask the question of), refers to this or T.
grandifolia as growing in the woods of North- 
amptonshire, under the then common denomination of Tilia fcemina, and Stokenchurch 
woods in Oxfordshire were till lately said to have produced both the broad-leaved spe- 
cies.
Again, Mr. Ward, of Richmond, in Watson's 'New Botanist's Guide,' finds T.
grandifolia truly wild on Clink Bank, near that town ; and my excellent friend Mr.
Borrer has observed a lime growing abundantly in a hill-side copse in Sussex, the sta- 
171 
tion for which, an apparently truly wild one, he pointed out to me in an excursion we 
made to Beachy Head, in the autumn of 1840.
From the periodical cutting of the 
brushwood not permitting the trees to acquire a flowering size, Mr. Borrer cannot with 
certainty refer them to their species, I understand however that they belong to the 
kinds with broad foliage.
Other stations for Tilia europasa and grandifolia are given 
both in England and Scotland, as at Boxhill, Streatham, Blair Athol and near Edin- 
burgh, but from what has been just said of the distribution of the broad-leaved limes, 
it is not probable that they are indigenous to the latter country.
In Ireland T.
parvi- 
folia is the only really indigenous species recorded by Mr. Mackay (' Flora Hibernica') 
on the authority of Templeton, and this is what we might expect from the nature of 
the climate of that island.
Mr. Leighton's observations on the differences between 
our three limes (now I trust fully established as aboriginal in Britain), are made with 
his accustomed accuracy.
Tilia parvifolia in particular is, as generally seen, an ex- 
tremely well marked species, from its smaller, more numerous and much later flowers, 
and their weak leathery capsules, besides the other striking features so ably pointed 
out by Mr. Leighton ; yet varieties do present themselves with most puzzling and as- 
piring tendencies to emulate the umbrageous honours of their more " civilized^ fellow 
species.

Additional Facts on Monotropa Hypopitys.
Mr. Wilson, I see (Phytol.
149), 
objects to my view of the parasitic growth of Monotropa ; and the difficulty of the sub- 
ject is shown, when even with the aid of the microscope so acute an investigator could 
not arrive at positive certainty, even with respect to the " woolly substance " investing 
its roots.
This hairy envelope, I still think, is part of the economy of the plant, 
having found it present in every specimen, and appearing to my observation to be 
wound about the young tubers of the Monotropa and the rootlets of the beech, at 
their junction with each other.
No doubt it may be detached from the clustered 
fleshy radicles of the flowering plants, and from the shrinking of the beech-roots the 
connexion, with the nicest observation, appears dubious.
Had Mr. Wilson, however, 
the harsh oolitic soil of the Cotswolds to deal with, as I had, instead of the sand of 
Lancashire, and seen me working at my task for a week, he would scarcely have im- 
puted to me a want of care, in so far as I had conducted the investigation.
Anxious 
only to elicit truth, I have stated what appeared to my observation with ordinary ap- 
pliances, being desirous, if possible, to render the matter clear to general observation; 
nor does it follow that due care was not employed because I had no facilities for mi- 
croscopic dissection close at hand.
A powerful double lens, my pocket companion for 
years, certainly Ithiirielizes my sight to some extent, and as far as it goes may be de- 
pended upon.
It appeared to me, then, that the fleshy clustered radicles of the Mo- 
notropa, about which there can be no doubt, had ultimate fibres, spongioles or suckers, 
connecting them with the rootlets of the beech.
But as I have stated throughout, young 
tubers must be examined for this, the " woolly substance " about the old plants, what- 
ever it is, being too inextricably entangled to allow us to arrive at any certainty as to 
the nature of its connexion.
I shall here, however, just state an additional fact, con- 
firmatory of my views, and I invite other botanists to examine the subject, with a per- 
fect freedom from prejudice.
Wishing to see if the young plants I had obtained from 
among the beech-roots could be kept alive, I immersed two in a tumbler of water, 
where they remained about a month, when, as they made no progress, I took them out 
for preservation, and placed them in the sun to dry on a piece of white paper.
To my 
great surprise I found them, some days after, affixed to the pajjcr as if glued thereon.
172 
nor could tliey be sbakeu off; while a lens, on examination, plainly shotved very mi- 
nute hair-like fibres or suckers proceeding from the fleshy tubers of the young Mono- 
tropa, and binding it down to the paper.
Unfortunately, one of these fixed plants 
(which thus appear at least curiously to have simulated a parasitical growth) was trod- 
den upon through an accidental fall of the paper, but the other remains affixed as at 
first ; and I hope to induce some friend, more skilful at microscopical dissection than 
I profess to be, to examine it.
What I find remarkable, and I write from careful re- 
iterated observation on specimens collected by myself, is the diversity in the size of 
the clustered roots, from old ones possessing numerous rudimentary stems, to small 
tuberous knobs where the buds are scarcely disceruable with the naked eye.
In these 
last, more especially, I find the fleshy tubers closely applied to and even twisted round 
the beech-roots, so that I cannot separate them without violence, even after having 
possessed them above four months.
In a specimen now before me, after immersion in 
water, a beech-root just at its entrance among the clustered radicles of the Mouotro- 
pa, is obviously thickened, and covered by them in an imbricated manner, just as if 
melted glue had been laid on with a brush.
The subject is of course, as I have my- 
self intimated, open to further elucidation, and I have only had the opportunity of the 
inspection, carefully made, however, which I have already recorded, (Phytol, 98).
Yet 
though opinions may differ as to the real nature of the attachment of Monotropa to 
the roots among which it is found nestled, I should think that botanist rash who, in 
the present state of the enquiry, and without having watched the plant from its first 
germination, should absolutely affirm that it is not parasitical.
I may here state that 
all my mature flowering specimens of Monotropa, as well as the young plants, are 
perfectly erect, and in only one instance can I perceive the slightest indication of a 
bend at the summit of the stem.
As Mr. Wilson is at issue with me as to the scent 
given out by the plant, and " counts noses " against me, it is but fair to hear my evi- 
dence as to the odorous influence exercised by Monotropa upon the olfactory nerves 
in Worcestershire.
Without mentioning my own impression, I presented three ma- 
ture plants in seed, which were gathered in September last, to a lady, and requested 
her this morning to smell them.
She had no sooner done so than she instantly ex- 
claimed â€” ^'â– Beautiful !
just like the Mezereon !
" This, be it remembered, is after the 
lapse of nearly five months; but when I had about fifty fresh plants together, the fra- 
grance proceeding from them was so powerful as to scent the room they were in for 
weeks, and was instantly perceptible on opening the door.
As I have stated, the im- 
pression of the fragrance on my senses assimilated to that of primroses, although of 
course much more powerful ; assuredly " a raw potato " is the last and lowest simile 
that would have occuned to me as a comparison of its odour.

List of Alges from Guernsey.
We know so very little of the marine Botany 
of the Channel Islands, that I am induced to send you the following veiy imperfect 
list of Algae for insertion in ' The Phytologist.' The collection from which I prepared 
it, was made in Guernsey last summer, by Mr. D.
Ross of Lasswade, who, not being 
an algologist, merely took such species as came in his way.
This will account for the 
absence from the list of various common plants, as well as of a large number of spe- 
cies which have such a general resemblance to each other as to cause them to be passed 
over by individuals unacquainted with their forms.

True office of the Earth in relation to Plants.
Although so much has been 
written on the subject of gases evolved and absorbed by plants ; on the form and func- 
tions of the stomata or mouths of plants ; and on the obvious numerical preponderance 
of the stomata in the leaves and branches over those in the roots ; yet the broad asser- 
tion that the office of the earth in relation to plants is precisely equivalent to its office 
in relation to animals â€” namely, to maintain them in the position best suited to their 
well being â€” has, I believe, never yet been made in print.
Almost as long ago as I 
can recollect, this phytological fact was impressed forcibly on my mind by seeing how 
beautifully hyacinths blossom with their roots immersed in water and without a parti- 
cle of earth that they could possibly reach.
I have constantly asserted my belief on 
this point, but have always been laughed at as a visionary and theorist.
It is, how- 
ever, with infinite satisfaction that I see my views slowly gaining ground.
Each suc- 
ceeding year diminishes the number of those who assert that plants feed on the earth 
as we feed on meat and bread and potatoes : still, by far the larger portion of convers- 
ing mankind religiously believe this, and most of our farmers look on a rich soil as 
being as directly food for their wheat as a sack of barley-meal is food for their pigs.
Now the truth is the very converse of this : the earth feeds on plants â€” is increased by 
plants â€” owes what is called its richness and good properties to plants.
These facts 
are not only interesting in themselves, but the ends to which they are applicable would 
174 
furnish almost a new era in existence.
It can scarcely be doubted tliat nature has pro- 
vided, in the earth, the best possible receptacle for the roots of plants ; yet even this 
position will admit of considerable modification, for we have first to consider whether 
our object in cultivation is to carry out the designs of nature, or to make nature sub- 
serve our artificial requirings ; if the latter, it is quite certain that art can be advan- 
tageously applied : we have but to call to mind our commonest fruits and vegetables 
as examples.
Thus, although plants may best achieve their destined ends when rooted 
in the earth, it may reasonably be doubted whether in turning their good properties to 
our uses a more advantageous receptacle may not be found.
But without extending 
the enquiry so far as this, if it be once admitted that earth is in no ^vise the food of 
plants, then, cceteris paribus, the most unproductive sand, for instance, the heaths of 
Surrey, may be rendered as productive as the Golden Valley : we have only to make 
use of this sand, as nature intended it, for a receptacle of roots, and then having learn- 
ed what is the true food of plants, to supply that food in the most profitable way.
It 
is now generally admitted that carbonic acid gas is the food of plants ; but leaving 
even this question to those more competent to decide on it correctly, it is quite certain 
that their food, whatever it may be, is evolved in greater quantities from certain che- 
mical preparations than from the richest and most highly manured earth.
Poverty of 
soil thus becomes a nonentity : rotation of crops a mere amusement : once admit that 
earth is simply a receptacle for roots, and you invest it with a property which you can- 
not wear out.
Every common and heath may be made to produce wheat at the will 
of the cultivator, and the supply must ere long greatly exceed the consumption ; that 
very description of food, the supply of which causes such difficulty to all our legisla- 
tors, becoming more abundant than our most zealous philanthropists could desire.

New British Equisetum.
We have received from Francis Whitla Esq., of 
Belfast, a very fine Equisetum, hitherto unnoticed as British, the Eq. elongatum of 
Willdenow ; a southern plant, indeed, but of which, as is well known to be remarka- 
bly the case with some other plants that have been supposed to be peculiar to warmer 
skies, the range has extended to Ireland.
Mr. Whitla found it in mountain glens, 
near Belfast.
* * Our specimens are 2j and 3 feet long.
If the roughness of 
the stem, its great length and ramification, and elongated teeth of the sheaths, and 
the apiculus of the spikes be considered, it cannot be confounded with any other of 
our native species.â€” London Journal of Botany, p.

New British Chara.
Chara latifolia of Willdenow.
This fine species of Cha- 
ra, which I have no hesitation in stating to be new to Britain, occurred in great abun- 
dance in Belvidere Lake, Co. Westmeath, where I collected it in August last.
The 
great size and semipellucid appearance, at once struck me as remarkable.
The main 
branches are striated and covered with raised rough points, as are the first joints of the 
whorled ramuli, while the remaining portion consists only of one pellucid tube, which 
is thicker than the lower joint, and ends in a sharp point.
The branches of the whorls 
are again beset with smaller ramuli (not bractese), in which respect it difiiers from all 
our species in the opaque division.
I regret I could not find the [species in^ fruit, 
neither globule nor nucule was present ; though I examined hundreds of specimens in 
various parts of the lake, where it sometimes covered the bottom to the extent of ma- 
ny square perches ; and what is singular enough, all the other species in the opaque 
division occurred abundantly in the same lake, and were all in full fruit, each pre- 
serving its respective character.

â€” 
1. On the Groups Triandrte & Fragiles of the genus Salix.
By the Rev. J.
E. Leefe, Audley End, Essex.
" Whoever would study the willows with success, must see them growing at different seasons of the year; for 
fragments gathered at one season only, serve but to perplex and confuse the botanist.
Another soiu-ce of con- 
fusion is the practice of collecting specimens, w ithout numbering them and the tree, U'usting subsequently for 
identification to the memory alone, whereby a most unpleasant feeling of uncertainty is produced.
The chan- 
ges in the form of the leaves, and in the relative proportion of some of the parts of fructification at different 
periods of growth, are often so surprising, that without a mark of recognition, I should frequently have doubt- 
ed whether my specimens had been all collected from the same tree.
Again, it is a common practice to select 
for preservation the largest and most vigorous-looking sjiecimens, in consequence of which an erroneous idea 
of the average character is very apt to be produced.
If an unusually luxuriant specimen be chosen, it should 
have a corresponding label." The author proposes the cultivation of the more intricate species of the genus 
in gardens, in order that their variations may be regularly observed : and in continuation recommends the 
adoption of a practice followed by himself : â€” "I should advise that the specimens of eveiy Salix in a herba- 
rium (exceiJtiug, of course, species about which there can be no mistake), should be such as to present one or 
more regular series illustrative of the progressive development of the catkins, each set being taken from the 
same tree at intervals during the flowering season, â€” and that at least two specimens of the leaves, gathered at 
different periods, should be preserved, so as to show the form of the stipules, and the progressive alteration 
in the foliage ; â€” also, that thin sections of a catkin of each species, perpendicular to the axis, should be gum- 
med dovra, by which means the form of the ovarium and any other particular respecting it â€” the length and 
pubescence of its stalk, the nectary, the character of the axis, and the number of ovaria in a given length of 
the spiral, could easily be seen without mutilating Uie other specimens.
The exact date also of each specimen 
should be registered, whereby many ambiguities would be removed.
For instance, it is common to find cha- 
racters derived from the relative proportion borne by the nectary to the ovarium ; but this varies greatly, as 
a dated sei-ies of specimens would immediately make evident, â€” sometimes, as in the viminalis group, from J 
to \.
Good specific characters frequently disappear in the drying process, â€” for instance, the furrowed shoots 
of -S.
amygdalina, which afford an excellent mark of distinction from S.
Hoffmanniana in fresh specimens, 
cannot be relied upon when the specimens are diy, owing to the shrinking of the bai-k." After some remarks 
ou the willows as occurring at Audley End, the author gives a description of each species in the above groups.

2. On three newly proposed species of British JtiiigermanniiB.

3. Remarks on the Flora of Shetland, with a full catsdogue of plants observed in these Islands.
By Mr .
Thomas Edmonston, jun.
The author observed that the Botany of Shetland had never been adequately in- 
vestigated.
Dr. Neill, who spent ten days or a fortnight there in 1804, was the first to enter upon this field, 
and he was followed by Dr. Gilbert M'Nab, who spent a few weeks there in 1837.
Mr. Edmonston (a native 
of Shetland) has devoted the last four years to this agi-eeable pursuit, and in that time has visited the whole 
district.
Two years ago, he transmitted to London a list of the plants which had then been observed by him, 
and this list, though incomplete, and, in some instances, inaccurate, made its appearance lately in the 'Annals 
of Natural History,' without any previous intimation, so that he had no opportunity of correcting it.
The 
Orkney Islands, which are numerous, stretch about 70 miles from S.E. to N.W. Their geological formation 
is altogether primitive ; the most abundant rocks being gneiss, granite and limestone, which are very generally 
covered by large tracts of peat moss, and often destitute of all vegetation excepting the commonest bog plants.
Unst is the most northerly island, and is also the most diversified in its formation ; gneiss, mica slate, chlo- 
rite slate and serpentine being all found on it.
Its vegetation is equally varied, some of the species being pe- 
culiar to it in Britain, and others being rare elsewhere.
The most interesting of these, viz., Arenaria norve- 
gica and Lathyrus maritimus, were discovered by Mr. Edmonston when he was little more than twelve years 
of age.
Eonas Hill, which attains an elevation of about 1500 feet, is the highest land in Shetland, and it is 
only upon it that the botanist meets with anything like alpine vegetation.
The largest island, usually called 
the Mainland, presents little of interest, but is, for the most part, a succession of dreary peat moors, occasion- 
ally enlivened by Scilla verna and Finguicula vulgaris ; nor are the other islands generally more productive, 
though sometimes a fertile spot occurs.
" The general character of Shetland vegetation," says Mr. Edmon- 
ston, " seems to be subalpine, or nearly so, for we find plants belonging properly to that region, in every situ- 
ation, such as Tkalictruin alpinum, Draba incana, &c., which grow down almost to the sea level." The list 
of species which accompanied this paper, comprehends 395, viz., 2S6 phanerogamic and 109 cryptogamic, â€” 
the latter consisting of 22 ferns, 65 mosses and 22 hepaticee.
4. Account of a Botanical Excui-sion in Norway.
By Dr. John Shaw.
The circumstance that most 
struck Dr. Shaw in this tour, is the almost total absence of Calluna vulgaris, which covers our Scottish moors, 
but which in Norway is so far from being common, that throughout an extent of 600 miles, he ''could scarce- 
ly find a specimen of it." He also remarks on the extreme wildness and sterility of some tracts, as contrast- 
ed with the fertility and luxu-.iance of vegetation in others.
The species which he observed were in general 
the same as those which gi'ow in Scotland, â€” those not indigenous here being in about the proportion of 1 to 5 ; 
but several plants which are extremely rare in this country, such as Menziesia cmrulea, Pyrola unifiora and 
LinncBa borealis, he found abundant in many places.
He was also particularly gratified by the beauty and 
luxuiiance of TroUius europtBus, of which he observed "myriads, witii their corollas like half pounds of but- 
ter, gracefully waving their heads, almost in the frozen region." â€” Condensed from the Report in 'Tlie JEdin'

A paper was read by Mr. Adam Gerard, " On the Botany of Kotgurk " in the Himalaya, taken from the 
notes of Captain Patrick Gerard, of the Bengal Native Infantry.
Kotgurk is surrounded on three sides by 
tJiick woods, in which the Rhododendron flourishes ; they and the neighbourhood abound in pines, oaks and 
almost every tree, shrub and plant, indigenous to Europe, besides many others unknown.
Amongst the lat- 
ter is a species of small red bamboo, which grows all over the higher mountains, attains the height of 8 â€” 12 
feet, and is used for a variety of domestic purposes.
The following were mentioned as the chief vegetable 
productions; â€” Rice, several kinds, mostly of the coarser sort; Jow, or barley; Oowa, ^o-w,{Hordexmicel<estc); 
Kunuk, or wheat; Phuphura or phuphur, {Panictim tartaricum) ; Chuberee, or Jabvu-ee, the grain of which 
difiers little in appearance from that of tlie Phuphur and Oogul ; opium in considerable quantities for export ; 
three species of Bathoo [Amaranthus Anardhana) ; various kinds of pulse ; a small quantity of cotton and 
ginger on the banks of the Suthy and other rivers ; Indian corn, limited.
The Jow ripens earliest; the Oowa 
jow and Kunuk fully a month later.
In elevated situations in the neighbourhood the crops are often very 
backward, the wheat especially, which is frequently not housed until the rainy season has set in, and is some- 
times reaped in a green state.
The chmate and other peculiarities were fully described.

â€” On British Species and Varieties of the Genus Sagina.
By Samuel Gibson, Esq.
, Hebden Bridge, February 10, 1842.
Sir, 
The following descriptive list is dravm up from specimens 
of Sagina in my own herbarium : I have thus endeavoured to furnish 
a few materials towards the history of this difficult genus.
Probably 
some of the forms may hereafter be considered distinct species ; but 
not presuming to decide on that point, I leave it to the better judg- 
ment of others.
If you should consider the list worthy a place in the 
' Phytologist,' it is at your service.
Saml.
Gibson.
To the Editor of ' The Phytologist.' 
Genus.
â€” Sagina, Linnc&us, 
Capsule 1 -celled, 4-valved, many-seeded: petals 4, (shorter than 
the calyx or entirely wanting) : stamens 4 : styles 4 : sepals 4.
1. S.
apetala, Linn, Plant annual, glaucous, reclining but not tak- 
ing root.
Stems rough with scattered points : leaves, each tipped 
with a very distinct awn or bristle, slightly combined by their mem- 
branaceous bases, linear, about a quarter of an inch long, fringed 
at the edges with jointed hairs : flower-stalks erect, smooth, about an 
inch long : calyx ovate, obtuse, about one third shorter than the cap- 
sule ; segments with narrow membranaceous margins : petals entirely 
wanting: seeds nearly smooth, variable in shape, with their edges 
crenate.
On moist, barren, sandy ground.
Common in many parts of Lancashire.
I ga- 
thered this plant in 1840, on the Bolton road, about two miles from Manchester; and 
have specimens of it from Marple, &c.
(3.
stricta, mihi.
Plant quite upright : stems and leaves ciliated 
with jointed hairs : flower- stalks set with stalked glands : seeds 
smooth, with their edges dentate.
This variety diflfers from the above in being always upright, and having glandular 
flower-stalks.
On the muddy banks of the river Mersey, opposite Liverpool, in June, 
1831.
I gathered this plant in Wallazey Pool, in June, 1841.
P 
178 
y. divaricata, raihi.
Plant upright in a young state, decumbent 
with age : seeds rough, keeled at the back, keel crenate.
This variety is prominently distinguished, not only hy its divaricated mode of 
growth, but by the great dissimilarity of its seeds.
It appears to be somewhat rare, as 
1 have specimens from one locality only, namely, the garden walks of P.
M. James, 
Esq., Sumerille Irlams, on the heights near Manchester, communicated to me by Mr.
W. Charlton.
S".
prostrata^ mihi.
Plant with numerous stems, all spread quite 
flat on the ground, dark green, hairy : leaves short (about one eighth 
of an inch long), hairy: flower-stalks and calyces quite smooth: seeds 
as in a.
The prostrate habit of this plant at once distinguishes it from every other fonn of 
Sagina apetala.
On the walks of neglected gardens in Halifax &c.
; apparently not 
very uncommon, as I have a specimen from Cornwall, and have also seen others from 
Richmond, in Yorkshire.
E. setacea, mihi.
Plant upright, veri/ slender, from two to five inches 
high : stems few, smooth, leaves about one quarter of an inch long, 
narrow, membranaceous at the base, their edges ciliated, each tipped 
with a very short bristle : seeds smooth, dentate on their back.
The very slender and upright habit of this at once distinguishes it from every other 
foi-m of the plant.
Apparently not very common : my specimens are from Richmond 
in Yorkshire.
?. glabra.
( Sagina apetala, i3.
glabra, Babington, ' Primitiae Florae 
Sarnicae,' p.
15).
Plant nearly upright: stems and leaves smooth, the 
latter tipped with a very distinct bristle: flower-stalks and calyces set 
with minute stalked glands, the two outer sepals mucronate.
For specimens of this variety I am indebted to Mr. Babington ; they are from Jersey .
17.
l(Bvis, mihi.
(Sagina maritima of the Manchester Flora, p.
14).
Plant nearly upright, smooth in every part 
Closely allied to the foregoing, but differing in the flower-stalks and calyces being 
destitute of the stalked glands so conspicuous in that variety.
This appears to be the 
most common form of Sagina apetala.
Perhaps this and the last might be considered 
two forms of one distinct species : the two outer sepals of the calyx being mucronate, 
together with the absence of hairs from the leaves &c., would serve to distinguish them 
from every other form of Sagina apetala.
My specimens are from the walls of Bow- 
den Church-yard, given to me by the author of ' Flora Mancuuiensis ; ' also from 
Brandon Hill, &c.
by Mr. Grindon; and Greenwich Park, Mr. Luxford.
In 1835 I 
gathered it at Selby, and in 1836 on the magnesian limestone at^Garforth, six miles 
from Leeds.
2. S.
maritima, Don. Plant annual, smooth.
Stems prostrate, 
divaricated : leaves short, broad in proportion, thick and blunt, com- 
bined by their membranous bases : flower-stalks slender : segments 
179 
of the calyx broad, ovate, obtuse, with narrow membranous edges : 
petals none : cajDsule shorter than the calyx.
All my Scottish specimens answer to the ahove description.
/3.
erecta, mihi.
Plant upright, smooth, very slender : leaves nar- 
row, long in proportion, tipped with a very short bristle : capsule 
longer than the calyx.
The more slender and upright habit of this variety, combined with its longer cap- 
sule, will serve to distinguish it from the above.
My specimens of this plant I ga- 
thered in WallazeyPool, Cheshire, in June, 1841, where I found all our three species 
of Sagina growing together.
My Warrington specimens differ but little from this.
I 
have also a specimen of the Sagina maritima from Devonport, communicated to me 
by Mr. Luxford, that exactly agrees with my Warrington plants.
3. S.
procumbens, Linn.
Perennial.
Stems one to ten inches or 
more in length, spreading on the ground and taking root at their 
joints, leafy: leaves evergreen, combined at their base by a thin mem- 
brane, ribbed, linear, about one to three quarters of an inch in length, 
very smooth, often tipped with a minute bristle : flower-stalks short, 
smooth, often drooping : calyx-leaves broad, ovate, obtuse, with very 
narrow membranous edges : petals (if present) ovate, obtuse, about 
half the length of the calyx.
This species grows in damp shady places everywhere.
Smith tells us that the 
leaves of Sagina procumbens are three-ribbed ; this character I have not been able to 
find in any of the forms of the plant : nor have I ever been able to find the seeds of 
any species of Sagina bordered with a black ring.
/3.
pentandra, mihi.
This differs from the above only in having a fifth part added to the whole fructifi- 
cation.
Rare: my specimens I found at Dob-royd near Todmorden, in July, 1840.
y. nodosa, mihi.
Stems procumbent, densely crowded, strong and 
woody, bearing at their joints moss-Uke tufts of leaves, which are about 
half an inch in length, each tuft bearing a solitary flower-stalk.
This singular-looking variety I found in the town of Malton, September, 1838.
5".
maritima, mihi.
Root branched at the crown : stems few, very 
short, prostrate, disposed in a circular form.
The very small size of this variety, combined with its circular mode of growth, will 
at once distinguish it from the common state of the plant : probably the maritime lo- 
cality of this little variety will account for the difference.
Found at Crosby, near 
Liverpool, in June, 1841 .
Â£.
spinosa, mihi.
(Sagina procumbens, var.
&. spinosa, Baines's 
' Flora of Yorkshire.') 
This differs from the normal state of Sagina procumbens in the edges of the leaves 
being margined with minute diaphanous spines.
Found at Halifax, Shibden, near 
Leeds, Hebden Bridge, &c.
&c.

plentiful on the boggy parts of Sketty Burrows, which are now enclosed ; and 
found by Mr. Moggridge in Tennant's Canal, near Coed-y-allt, (Dillwyn).
Iris Pseudacorus.
Common on all the marshy ground near Swansea, Mumbles road 
and Cromlyn Bog.
â€” fcetidissima.

has continued to flourish with it for more than thirty years at least.
Iris fceti- 
dissima also grows in Gower, (Dillwyn).

Asparagus officinalis.
Near Loughor, and also on Worms Head and the coast near.
Meadows between Cowbridge and the sea, about Cardiff, and at Singleton.
In 
Martyn's edition of Miller's 'Gardener's Dictionary' it is denied that the "spar- 
row-grass " of our gardens is the same species ; and it would be interesting to 
ascertain whether the young shoots of the wild plant possess the same flavour, 
and the effect of removing them to a richer soil.
Allium vineale.
Common near Port Tennant.
Scilla verna.
On the lime-stone hill between the Mumbles and the light-house ; on 
the Worms Head and other places in Gower, plentifully.
Paris quadrifolia.
In the woods about Britton Ferry and near Kilvay Bridge, in Ni- 
cholston wood and other woods in Gower.
It not unfrequently occurs with five 
leaves; and the Rev. G.
E. Smith, in his Catalogue of the Phsenogamous Plants 
of South Kent, says that the flower then frequently follows the quinary division, 
presenting five sepals, five petals, ten stamens, five styles and a five-celled capsule.
About Devon I have frequently found the plant with six, and sometimes with 
seven leaves, and have never observed any variation from the usual quaternary 
arrangement of the flowers, (Dillwyn).

Alopecurus bulbosm.
Found in Cardiff Marshes and about the Aust passage, but 
some specimens that have been gathered in this neighbourhood, and have been 
mistaken for it, are nothing more than varieties of Alopecurus geniculatus.
A. 
bulbosus appears to have been chiefly founded by Linnaeus on the Gramen my- 
osurioides nodosum of Ray, Syn. t.
20, fig.
2, which may possibly be different; 
and as there is no specimen in the Linnaean herbarium, it can only, at most, be 
regarded as a very doubtful species, (Dillwyn).

Note on Primula elatior, Src* ' The Phytologist ' appears to me to oflFer to 
botanists, particularly those residing in the country, great facilities for making known 
any observations they may make relative to the science, and especially with regard to 
our indigenous plants ; and to afford such persons a valuable medium through which 
they may communicate, and direct the attention of others to, any particular circum- 
stances connected with the habitats of doubtful species.

facts, sufficient data might in time be gained to enable botanists to arrive at some just 
conclusion as to the merits of the individuals in question.
The furtherance of this 
design is the object I have in view in writing this letter ; the immediate subject of 
which is an account of the conditions under which I have found Primula elatior grow- 
ing, and which, in my opinion, bear much on the question of its right to be considered 
as a distinct species, or as a hybrid production between P.
veris and P.
vulgaris.
The 
only locality in which I have chanced to find P.
elatior, has been at Chinham, near 
Basingstoke, Hants, where I have found it in tolerable abundance for several succes- 
sive years.
The meadow in which it grows is, as most of the meadows in our " wood- 
lands " are, surrounded either by hedgerows or coppices, which distribution of wood 
and meadow is peculiarly favourable for the hybridization of such plants as P.
veris 
and P.
vulgaris ; the former growing in abundance in the open meadows, and the lat- 
ter in equal profusion in the hedgerows &c., while the two species intermix, as might 
be expected, along the border of the field, in which situation the oxlip is found, not 
extending into the meadow with the cowslip, nor into the wood with the primrose, 
which it might be expected occasionally to do, were it a distinct plant.
Having found 
the oxlip under the conditions above mentioned, I have for some time considered it in 
my own mind as a hybrid production ; being however aware that it is unsafe to draw 
conclusions from a solitary instance, I send this communication to your journal, in 
the hope that some of your correspondents may be induced to detail any circum- 
stances under which the plant may have occurred to them, with a view to the 
settlement of the question.
In the same situation I have not unfrequently met with 
the variety which has both the single and the manyflowered stalks on the same indi- 
vidual.

Seasons of Crocus nudijlorus.
Miss Worsley was probably correct in suppos- 
ing that the longer-leaved Crocuses in Nottingham meadows, were plants of Crocus 
nudiflorus, (Phytol.
167).
The leaves of that species appear above the ground in 
winter, and are in perfection about March or April, lasting some time longer.
They 
are thus much forwarder in their growth than are those of C.
vernus, at the usual time 
of flowering for the latter species.
The root (or, technically, the cormus, not root) of 
C. nudiflorus appears to be naturally less than that of C.
vernus, and it would neces- 
sarily be small in the early part of the year, when the new bulb was forming.
It is 
well known to every botanical physiologist (though I have had to explain this to each 
of three gardeners successively in my service, who injured the flowering of the plants 
through ignorance of the fact) that the Crocus forms an entirely new cormus every year ; 
the new one growing at the bases of the leaves, and within the pale sheaths that envelope 
the lower parts of the leaves.
The position of the new coiinus is immediately above 
the old one, which gradually withers away, and finally drops ofi" in the shape of a flat 
plate or scale from the base of the new one.
It is stated, indeed, in Mr. Francis's 
recently published ' Grammar of Botany,' that the new cormus is developed under- 
neath the old one ; but this is impossible physiologically, as the slightest reflection 
must convince any botanist at all conversant with the laws of vegetable development.
Should this paragraph be printed in ' The Phytologist ' for April, it may be suggested 
to any young botanical readers, to pull up a common crocus, and examine the half- 
grown new, and the half-withered old cormus.
The former will be found uppermost, 
and its position at the bases of the leaves will illustrate the ordinary formation of the 
stems of Monocotyledonous plants ; the crocus " root," as it is commonly called, be- 
189 
ing a flattened palm-stem in miniature.

Tlie Genus Tilia.
Sir William Hooker still appears to class the three species 
(if species we must call them) among the introduced trees of Britain; all of them be- 
ing distinguished by the (*) in the last edition of the ' British Flora.' Mr. Lees and 
Dr. Bromfield have half convinced me that Tilia parvifolia and T.
europsea are genu- 
ine Britons ; but with regard to T.
grandifolia, it seems to me that the evidences are 
greatly short of proofs.
I allude to the genus just now, in order to remark that some 
of your correspondents probably do not know T.
grandifolia ; the specimens sent un- 
der this name, from the western counties, to the Botanical Society of London, seem 
all to belong to T.
europaea.
Specimens should be gathered in seed, when the promi- 
nent angles of the fruit in T.
grandifolia will prevent ambiguity or error.
The num- 
ber of flowers, the outline of the leaf, and the disposition of the hairs, are too variable 
to be relied on as certain characters.
There are so few really natural woods in Eng- 
land, that the existence of a wood of lime-trees almost authorizes a conclusion that 
the wood was originally a plantation.
Our remote forefathers did not plant the same 
trees that we do, nor for the same purposes.
With them a quick-growing tree might 
have been better worth planting than one of slow growth, even though producing su- 
perior timber.

Discovery of Leskea pulvinata, Wahl.
As the addition of Leskea pulvinata 
(Wahl.
in 'Flora Lapponica,' 369) to the British Flora has not hitherto been announ- 
ced, I may state that I had the good fortune to discover it near York, on the 30th of 
October, 1841 ; and have since ascertained it to occur abundantly about the roots of 
trees, and on low bushes in situations liable to be inundated by the Ouse.
I forbear at 
present oS"ering any description of this elegant little moss, as I have not yet gathered 
fruit with perfect opercula, and cannot hope to do so earlier than September next.
Its closest affinity is with Leskea polycarpa, Hedw.
(Hypnum medium, Dicks.), from 
which the faintly-nerved (occasionally nerveless) leaves sufficiently distinguish it.

The Council of the Botanical Society of London have issued a set of " Regu- 
lations for the Exchange and Distribution of Specimens." These Regulations are 
chiefly interesting to members, being intended for their guidance in the exchange of 
plants with the Society.
We are glad to see that the Council intend to follow up the 
frequently-expressed determination of the Committee of the Botanical Society of Ed- 
inburgh, to reject all imperfect and ill-dried specimens that may be sent in.
The ne- 
cessity for this public expression of such a determination on the part of the two Socie- 
ties, shows how little understood is the really simple and easy process of drying plants.

The following papers were read, 
1. Notes on preserving the Colour of certain Vegetables hy immersing them in hot water: by Mr. Evans.
It is well known to every one who has had any experience in the drying of specimens, that, while many 
plants are easily preserved by the ordinary means of placing them between layers of absorbent paper, and 
subjecting them to certain degrees of pressure â€” there are others that cannot be so readily dried ; and some 
are even so constant in their tendency to turn black in drying, that this feature has been deemed characteris- 
tic of them.
The use of hot water, as a means of accelerating the process of desiccation in certain vegetables, 
has been long known to botanists ; but the author is not aware of its having been employed, to any extent at 
least, as a means of preserving their colours.
To Mr. Peter Henderson, one of the gardeners at Melville Cas- 
190 
tie, the chief merit of this apph'cation Is due â€” he having, last summer, succeeded by it in preserving Lathrcea 
squamaria and some other plants, which ordinarily become black in drying, particularly Asperula odorata) 
Melampyrum pratense, Agraphis nutans, Rhinantkus crista-galli, and several Orchidese.
During the sum- 
mer and autumn, Mr. Evans tried the same method, and found that, besides the greater beauty of the speci- 
mens thus treated, they could be dried in nearly one half of the time usually required, as also that, from the 
power of hot water in destroying rigidity, they were much more easily arranged on the drying paper.
Mr.
Evans observed that while he and his friend, in pursuing this method, were guided almost entirely by the na- 
ture of the plants subjected to the process, they considered from twenty to tliirty seconds a medium time to 
keep Orchideae and other plants of a robust and fleshy nature in the water, which was always kept boiling ; 
while a mere dip was found sufficient for those of a more delicate structure.
He is, however, of opinion that 
the success of their metiiod is not to be entirely attributed either to the temperature of the water used, or the 
exact time the plants are kept in it, but depends much on the frequent changing, for some time, of the paper 
in which they are afterwards placed ; as unless this is strictly attended to, the specimens will be speedily de- 
stroyed by the gi-eat quantity of water with which they are at first surrounded.
It has been recommended, as 
a means of freeing the plants fi-om external moistui'e before placing them in the drying paper, to press them 
gently between cloths ; and this he considers beneficial for plants of a robust nature, but rather injurious to 
the more delicate ones, â€” to these he merely gives a gentle shake, but changes the papers sooner about them 
than the others.
Mr. Evans concluded by observing that, besides the utUity of this method for retaining the 
colour of the leaves of such plants as natui-aUy become Mack in drying, it will be found serviceable in preserv- 
ing the blue colour of the corollas of Campanulas and some other plants, which rather incline to turn white.
The specimens exhibited by Mr. Evans in illustration of his success, were most beautiful â€” the colour be- 
ing in almost all of them perfectly retained ; and to show that it was their previous immersion in hot water 
which had effected this object, he had purposely kept some portions of them out of the water, and in such in- 
stances, only the immersed parts had retained their natural colour.
2. Notice relative to certain Species found in the Parish of Alvah, Banffshire ; with alist of Plants oh- 
served in that parish : by the Rev. A.
Dodds.
Communicated by Mr. W.
A,.
Stables.
â€” The chief interest of 
this paper arose from the contrast which it presented between the south and north parts of Scotland, in regard 
to the occurrence and comparative frequency of several species : the recent occurrence of some which have 
now become generally disseminated, to the farmer's great annoyance, such as Senecio Jacobtsa, and the gra- 
dual disappearance of others which were formerly common, as Arctium Lappa, &c.
3. Description, with drawing, of a Vegetable found on the Gills and Fins of a, Goldfish: by Mr. Good- 
sir.
â€” In this interesting paper Mr. Goodsir gave a minute description of the parasite, explaining practically 
its foiTii, structure, mode of fructification, &c., but the fish having died during its conveyance to town, and 
putrefaction having commenced before he saw it, his observations were necessarily imperfect on some points 
which he had felt anxious to illustrate.
Professor Christison stated, that above a year ago he had noticed a 
similar parasite on a goldfish, which was entii-ely covered with it as with a soft down, but the animal's health 
did not seem at all aifected, and he believed it was stUl alive â€” nor was the affection communicated to other 
fishes which were put for some time in the same vessel with it.
Mr. Bennet also stated the result of some mi- 
croscopical observations made by him on Mr. Goodsir's fish, chiefly with reference to the condition of the ani- 
mal under the invasion of its vegetable foe.
4. Remarks on the affinities subsisting among Viola lutea, arvensis and tricolor : by Alexander Seton, 
Esq., of Mounie.
â€” Mr. Seton says that not having been able to discover any definite or permanent distinction 
between the plants which had been termed Viola lutea and tricolor, his attention was directed to their compa- 
rative appearance and habits in native situations ; and having found all gradations of form, colour and habit 
between the extreme characters of the perennial plant called lutea and the annual called tricolor, he had come 
to the conclusion that they are originally from the same stock or species.
As to the form of the stipules, and 
the different degrees of ramification or divarication in the stem, which Smith, Hooker, and other writers have 
adopted as distinguishing marks, they are so varying as to be totally unsuitable for that purpose.
On the 
other hand, the Viola which has been by some termed V.
arvensis, but has for the most part been considered 
as a variety of V.
tricolor, is so different, and so constant in its general character, that he is inclined to consider 
it a separate species, though in most particulars extremely similar.
It is completely annual, and he has never 
found it with that multiplicity of stems arising from a spreading root and radicating at their base, which are 
usual ^vith the two others when they have remained for any length of time undisturbed.
It is also taller and 
more succulent in the herbage than V.
tricolor, even when the latter is in a rich and congenial soil; and it 
maintains its characteristics when propagated by the seeds, without those gradations of variety which obliter- 
ate distinctions of species : for, having observed it grovrfng in corn-fields and by waysides, along with V.
tri- 
color, not only in this kingdom, but also in France, Italy and Germany (in all of which countries both species 
are common), he uniformly found it retaining its own peculiarities, unblended with those of its congener.
â€” 
But, though the habits and general appearance of the plants are considerably different, yet their various parts 
are so much alike that he is unable to find any other descriptive distinction than the proportion between the 
calyx and corolla.
Mr. Seton also notices some remarkable variations in form and habit, obviously arising 
from soil or locality, in several other plants, such as Trifolium pratense, Plantago lanceolafa, &c.
5. Notice respecting some late additions to the Flora of Jersey: by Mr. Joseph Bickson, Corresponding 
wt 
Secretnry.â€” The chief interest of this paper consisted, as in the case of No. 2, in the contrast afiforded with tlie 
vegetation of other parts of Britain ; and the author promised to take an early opportunity of extending hii 
observations on this subject.

The following papers were read.
1. Notices of several Vegetable Monstrosities, with Specimens : transmitted by Mr. H.
C. Watson and 
others.
â€” Some of these monstrosities were veiy interesting, particularly a Geranium {pusillmn?) having the 
branches terminated by heads or umbels of flowers, through adhesions and excess of parts, â€” the petals being 
mostly green or obsolete and the stamens imperfect; Anthriscus sylvestris with the umbels proliferous, which 
was gathered in the wet autumn of 1839; Linaria repens â€” varieties growing together, and showing a gradual 
approach to L.
vulgaris ; Anemone nemorosa, having the pistils changed to leaves ; and Galium Aparine 
presenting a remarkable lusus natnrce, probably caused by insects, the quadi-angular stem being twisted so 
that the stellate leaves have become secund.
2. Mr. Goodsir described the Sarcinitla VentricuU, a new vegetable infusorial allied to the genus Goni- 
vm, which he had found existing in immense numbers in the fluid ejected, for many weeks, from the stomach 
of a patient labouring under a particular form of indigestion.
This fluid was ejected in large quantities at a 
time, and had an appearance similar to that of liquor in a state of fermentation.
The plant is microscopic 
of a square form, and having the parts arranged in a beautifully symmetrical manner in the square.
The 
number of cells of which the plant consists is 64 ; it propagates by the division of each of these 64 cells into 4 
new ones, so as to consist of 2-56 cells â€” and simultaneously with this iucrease in the number of parts divides 
spontaneously into four young plants.
The author then adverted to the extremely rapid increase of the plant by such a mode of propagation â€¢ 
and after some observations on the nature of the disease in which it occurred, and of which it probably eon- 
stituted the cause, he concluded with remarks on the genera of plants and animals to which the new plant is 
allied.
U. On Primula veris and allied species: by the Eev. J.
E. Leefe.
â€” Mr. Leefe, after remarking that Pri.
mula injlata, Lehm, approaches very near to P.
veris, says â€” " in the woods at Audley End, Essex I find a 
good deal of what is commonly known as P.
elatior intermixed, but sparingly, with primroses and cowslips.
It agrees with the character of P.
elatior, Jacq., as defined by Koch, but not witli the figure in ' English Bo- 
tany.' The calyx-teeth are more ovate at the base, and the leaves are those of a cowslip â€” indeed the teeth are 
almost precisely the same in form as those of the P.
injlata before alluded to.
The limb of the corolla is how- 
ever, equal in breadth to more than half of the tube, and is flat, or nearly so." 
Professor Henslow writes on this subject : â€” " With respect to the identity of the three common Primulis 
I consider that no argument can be derived from their keeping distinct, in nature or under culture.
It is 
purely a physiological question, whether all of them may not originate from the seeds of any one a question 
which can only be decided by direct experiment.
Let a cowslip be highly manured, and its seeds sown in a 
shady, moist aspect, and I suspect the chances are in favour of some of them coming up as primroses or at 
least, as oxlips.
I have had several independent testimonies to the fact of cowslip roots changing to primro- 
ses ; and until proof, by direct experiment, contradict the experiments of Mr. Herbert and myself I cannot 
help believing that the three species (as they are Uiought) and the polyanthus, are merely races of one species."

6. 0)1 the varieties nf Dryas ociopctala: by Mr. C.
C. Babington, M.A., F.L S., F.G.S., &c.
The cha- 
racters distinguishing these are the proportional length and form of the sepals â€” the form of the base of the 
calyx â€” the form of the leaves â€” and the pubescence of the petioles.
Two of these varieties are apparently con- 
fined to Ireland, where Mr. Mackay first noticed the differences existing among plants of this species and 
the third is commonly found in alpine situations in England, Scotland, and on the continent of Europe.
The 
latter being the best known form, may be considered as the type of the species, and in it the sepals are acute 
and three or four times as long as broad â€” the base of the calyx being hemispherical ; in R the calyx is very 
nearly the same, being only less acute; but in y the sepals are scarcely twice as long as broad and very blunt 
and the base of the calyx is truncated in a very remarkable manner.

The following papers were read.
1. On four new species of British Jungermannice ; by Dr. Taylor, Dunkerron.
Communicated by Mr.
Wm. Gourlie, jun., Glasgow.
â€” Mr. Gouriie read the descriptions of the species, and illustrated them by 
beautifully preserved specimens.
Some of these were so minute as to require microscopic aid for their exa- 
mination, â€” a circumstance which enhances the merit of their discovei-y by Mr. Wilson and Dr. Taylor who 
have laboured with so much zeal and success in the field of Cryptogamic Botany.
The following were the 
species described : â€” Jungermannia Wilsoni, Taylor, discovered by William Wilson, Esq., at Cromaglown 
Killarney, in November, 1839, and named in compliment to him by Dr. Taylor.
J. stellulifera Taylor 
also discovered by Mr. Wilson, who found it near Crich, in Derbyshire, in September, 1833.
J. voluta Tay- 
lor, and spicata, Taylor, both discovered near Killarney, in 1841, by Dr. Taylor.
Mr. GourUe afterwards exhibited specimens of the following plants : â€” Leskea pulinnata, Wahl., disco- 
vered near York, by Mr. E.
Spruce.
Anictangium Hornschuchianum, discovered at Cromaglown by Dr.
192 
Taylor; both new to the British Flora.
Jungcrmannia Balfouriana, Taylor MSS., a new and highly 
curious species, brought fi-om New Zealand by Dr. Stanger, and named by Dr. Taylor in comphment to Pro- 
fessor Balfour of Glasgow, from whose herbarium the specimens were communicated.
2. Notice of the discovery of Herniaria glabra in Berwickshire, by Mr. William Marshall; and 
of Linncea borealis in the same county, by Br. Johnston : communicated by Dr. Greville.
The former 
of these species has genei-ally been regarded as a native of the south of England, but there seems no reason to 
doubt its being indigenous in the above station.
It was observed that Mr. Gorrie had found the plant abun- 
dantly in Perthshire, where he had no doubt it must have escaped fi-om gardens, though now quite natural- 
ized, and almost a weed in some places.
The discovery of a new station for the lowly but beautiful plant 
named in honoui- of Linnaeus, is always a matter of interest, and especially in the south of Scotland, where 
it occurs very rarely.
3. On four new species of Desmidium : by Mr. J.
Ralfs.
â€” Mr. Ealfs observes that " this natural genus 
is not well defined either in Agardh's ' Conspectus Criticus Diatomacearum,' or in any of our British wox'ks.
Its best distinctive character seems to consist in the crenated appearance of its filaments, which is least evident 
in D.
mucosum.
These filaments, which are generally twisted in a regular manner, are of a pale green co- 
lour, simple, fragile, short and straight.
The species are found during a great part of the year in clear shal- 
low pools, or in old peat bogs, â€” the filaments being scattered in loose bundles in the water, or fonning a thin 
gelatinous fleece at the bottom of the pool." The species ascertained by Mr. Ealfs are named by him Z>.

5. Notice on the adhesion of Lepas or Barnacle to Fuci ^-c.
by Mr. Edmonston; with a specimen com- 
municated by Mr. Archibald Gibson, Accountant.
â€” Some observations were made by Mr. Edmonston and 
others with regard to this parasite, which at one time was popularly regarded as the veritable origin of the 
barnacle goose.
6. Mr. Edmonston read a letter from Mr. P.J. Brown, of Thun, respecting the three species of pi-imroses 
usually considered to exist in this country.
He says â€” "Against Sir James Smith's opinion (in Eees's Cyclo- 
pedia), that Primula elatior may be a mule between veris and vulgaris, I may obserse that the three are 
not often the inhabitants of the same district, â€” veris is almost universally diffused; but where vulgaris 
is very abundant, I have rarely seen elatior in any quantity, and by far the most frequently not at all; 
while in general, as is the case at Thun, elatior grows by thousands in places -nithin many leagues of 
-which vulgaris is absolutely unknown.
P. vulgaris contents itself i\ith an elevation but little above the level 
of the sea, although in the neighbourhood of the Lake of Geneva it is in perfect condition at from 1200 to 1500 
feet; but at Thun, -nith an elevation of 1900 feet, it languishes, whether planted in a thicket, on a bank, or in 
a garden; while elatior, being more aspiring, prefers an elevation of from 1500 to 2000 feet, and although wil- 
lingly climbing beyond the latter, descends reluctantly below the former level.
Professor Balfour (of Glasgow) made observations on the distinctions among the genera of Ferns â€” Ane- 
mia, Mohria, Coptophyllum, Trochopteris and Schizaa, some of which had been recently established by Mr.
â– Gai-dner.
The Professor next alluded to the various theories which have been advanced to accovint for the 
origin of woody fibre, and more especially to that of Du Petit Thouars.
He showed by sections of palms that 
the interlacing of the fibres in Endogenous plants was quite in conformity with Du Petit Thouars' theoi-y, 
and that the appearance of the woody matter in tree ferns, and in the natureil orders Piperacece, Aristolochi.
acece, and the formation of roots externally in screw pines, Vellosias, &c., all supported the theory of wood 
being formed by the development of fibres from buds acting as fixed embryos.
Dr. Balfour also endeavoured 
to show that the formation of what have been called by Dutrochet embryo buds, may, in many cases, be ac- 
counted for by the development of leaves on ihem at one period of their gi-owth ; and that on examining some 
others which he exhibited, the woody matter might be traced communicating with the alburnum, at one point 
by rupture of the bark, and insinuating itself between the layers of bark.

Note on Irregularities in the Floivers of Tropceolum atro-sanguineum.
As the 
107 
observation of the ivregulaiities in plants is not only interesting in itself, but has also 
proved useful in establishing the laws which regulate their growth, I beg leave to for- 
ward to you the accompanying sketch of some which I observed in the autumn of 
1836, on a bed of Tropaeolum atro-sanguineum.
No. 1 represents a series of the calyx 
and spur, showing a gradual change from an almost complete absence of the spur to 
the development of three.
In another instance where the spur was absent, its place 
was supplied by an additional sepal.
In No. 2 the spur was fully developed, and 
another spur was formed, which was inverted, and its point appeared among the sta- 
mens : in the figure the petals are turned back to show its position.
No. 3 is the ex- 
ternal appearance of the spur, showing the place where the second spur is inverted.
The same irregularity I have frequently observed since that time; and in 1837 I found 
an instance (No. 4), in which two spurs were developed and both inverted, presenting 
the appearance in the inside of the flower represented in No. 5.
On each of the points 
I found a small drop of honey.

List of Mosses ^c.
collected in Wharf edale, Yorkshire.
The plants mentioned 
in the following list were collected in Wharfedale, Yorkshire, on the 18th and 20th of 
December, 1841 ; they were all found within a space of a little more than three miles 
along the banks of the Wharfe, extending from Bolton Abbey to Barden Tower, where 
the mill-stone grit is the prevailing geological formation.
When I state that the sea- 
son was one of extreme severity ; that I had in most instances to clear away the rime 
before I conld ascertain what I was collecting ; and lastly, to cut up the frozen mass- 
es with my knife ; â€” I think the collection will be considered an interesting one.
I 
have to acknowledge my obligation to Dr. Taylor for clearing up my doubts with re- 
gard to a few of the species.

Mosses near Castle-Howard.
After my visit to Wliarfedale, I passed a short 
time in the neighbourhood of Castle-Howard ; but the continuance of the storm pre- 
vented me from botanizing to any extent.
I had, however, the pleasure of discover- 
ing, in company with Mr. Ibbotson, Hypnum Blandovii and Bryum aiSne,* in the 
same bog where he had a short time previously gathered Leskea dendroides (in fruit) 
and Hypnum nitens.
Pursuant to a suggestion from Mr. Wilson, we intended to 
search further in the same locality for Bryum squarrosum, which Mr. W.
discovered 
in Cheshire accompanying the plants above named, but were disappointed by the set- 
ting in anew of the frost and snow.
A letter however from Mr. Ibbotson, dated 28th 
February, contains the interesting intelligence that he has found Hypnum nitens and 
Bryum affine coming copiously into fruit ; and, more than all, the wished-for Bryum 
squarrosum in equal abundance !
To use his own words, â€” " there is a space of not 
less than an acre, on which this and Hypnum nitens are the chief plants." â€” Id.

Trifolium incarnatum.
Although Trifolium incarnatum has been intro- 
duced into some of our later botanical catalogues as an indigenous production, it 
does not appear to be often met with.
Mr. Peete, and another experienced botanist 
whom I have consulted, have never seen it, except as a cultivated plant, in the fields.
It may not, therefore, be uninteresting to mention, that I met with a very fine cluster 
of it, in fuU bloom, about the beginning of last June, on a piece of waste land at Nor- 
wood, in Surrey, quite away from any fields where the plant was likely to have been 
sown for agricultural purposes.
I have no doubt at all of the identity of the flower.
In Martyn's ' Flora Eustica ' Trifolium incarnatum is said to vary in the colour of the 
spike, from bright to very pale red ; the colour of my specimens was a very beautiful 
bright red.
If it should be practicable to visit the same spot this year, at the proper 
time, I shall see whether the plant has maintained its position there.
I do not doubt 
at all that it would be most proper to consider the plant which I found as an acciden- 
tal occupant of the soil ; but, when we find that this elegant species of Trifolium has 
been seen in such sterile spots as the Lizard Point in Cornwall, by the Rev. Mr.
Hore; 
on the sands, in two separate places in Jersey, by Mr. Babington ; and again, on the 
gravelly soil of Norwood ; â€” we may yet hope to meet with its bright silky flowers in 
sufiicient abundance materially to enhance the charms of our English Flora.

Neio localities for Carex elongata.
Will you allow me, through the medium 
of your valuable and excellent little journal ' The Phytologist,' (for the institution of 
which the botanical world owes you a lasting debt of gratitude), to make known to 
you and your readers the discovery of no less \h.<mjive additional habitats for one of 
the most rare and beautiful of our British Carices; â€” I allude to Carex elongata, Lin.
This species, as you are well aware, for many years had only one authentic station in 
this countiy, first recorded by the late Mr. Jonathan Salt, who found it on the banks 
of the Don, near Shefiield.
It was afterwards gathered at Colemere, in Shropshire, by 
the lamented J.
E. Bowman, Esq., of this place, who obligingly furnished me with a 
specimen from that locality.
My friend Mr. Wilson, of Warrington, also discovered 
* Frequent near York, in moist situations.
199 
it many years ago at Over, where, he writes me word, it still exists in small quantity.
Lastly, it is recorded in the Yorkshire Flora, as being found in the neighbourhood of 
Boroughbridge.
One of the five new localities is at a place near Town-lane Bridge, 
which crosses the Worsley Caual near Tildsley, about nine miles from Manchester : 
the plant here grows in an alder-swamp in great abundance, and was first discovered 
several years since by Mr. John Martin, a humble but ardent investigator of the ar- 
cana of Nature, who resides near the spot ; by him it was sent to Mr. Wilson, who de- 
termined its identity.
The second locality was discovered by my friend Mr. Buxton, 
on the 24th of last May, about four miles from Manchester, near the village of Chorl- 
ton, where it exists in profusion, encircling and growing in three large ponds, or, as 
they are technically termed here, "/)i<s;" and this habitat, I may remark en passant, is 
one that is not likely to be destroyed by the ruthless and unsparing hand of improve- 
ment, either real or imaginary.
Mr. B.
also found it a few days prior to this, in con- 
siderable plenty, on the swampy banks of Rostherne Mere, Cheshire, a large and beau- 
tiful inland lake, and a locality rich in botanical productions, particularly in the genus 
Carex.
The fourth locality is one that was pointed out to me when on a visit to War- 
rington last summer, by Mr. Wilson, who had long been aware of its existence there : 
the " pit " is in a field near to Bruch Fann, about a mile and a half from Warrington, 
on the road to Manchester, and here, likewise, it is in great abundance.
During our 
rambles together on the same day, we again met with this delightful plant in very 
great quantities, completely lining the sides of the ditch for a very considerable dis- 
tance ; this was previously entirely unknown to Mr. Wilson, and you may be assured 
our delight was commensurate with the value of the discovery.
The name of the lane 
I do not at this moment remember, but it is in the immediate vicinity of Warrington, 
and would be most readily pointed out to any one happening to visit that neighbourhood, 
and who might be desirous of gathering it, by Mr. Wilson, whose courtesy and urba- 
nity to all who are ambitious of increasing their knowledge in natural science, is such 
as to merit the highest meed of praise.

Nero locality for Carex axillaris.
It also aflFords me much pleasure to add 
another to the localities already known for the equally rare Carex axillaris.
This was 
also found by my indefatigable friend Buxton, in company with Mr. J.
Martin, on the 
30th of last May (1841), about one mile west of Leigh, in Westleigh, and about ten 
miles from Manchester : the plant was growing sparingly from the hedge-bank, and 
much cropped by cattle.
In connexion with this species, perhaps you will permit me 
to observe, that during a short stay in York last summer, on my return from a very 
prosperous botanical visit to Teesdale, I had the pleasure of calling upon Mr. Baines, 
the author of the excellent ' Flora of Yorkshire;' and in looking over his duplicates, I 
met with a single specimen of Carex axillaris, which is now in my herbarium.
It 
was not then known to him, but he assured me most confidently that he had gathered it 
himself in Heslington fields, near York, shortly before, and that, as far as his recollec- 
tion served him, it was in considerable quantity.
I hope, however, that either Mr.
Baines, or some other resident botanist, will elucidate this fact clearly and satisfacto- 
rily, and favour us with the result of his investigation through the pages of 'The Phy- 
tologist,' which are always open for the promulgation of truth and the advancement 
of botanical science.

List of Mosses ^c.

I returned this 
morning from a two days' excursion in Surrey, whither I had accompanied my friend 
200 
Mr. Ward, in quest of fresh air, exercise, scenery and health, and at the same time 
to renew my acquaintance with whatever mosses and Hepaticas might fall in my way.
As many of your readers may not he aware how large a portion of the plants com- 
posing these two most interesting orders may he discovered so near London, and in so 
short a time as that which we devoted to searching for them ; I suhjoin a list of all 
that we found, marking those which grew on Leith Hill or its neighbourhood with the 
letter L; those at Box Hill, Headley, or Walton, with the letter B.

I am not sufficiently acquainted with the Botany of the neighbourhood of London to 
know whether any of the above are of rare occurrence ; if they are, I shall be happy 
to give such directions to any of your correspondents as will enable them to procure 
specimens for themselves.
In the course of our ramble we observed Lycopodium cla- 
vatum, in considerable abundance, near the summit of Leith Hill, and Mr. Joseph 
Ward met with a solitary specimen of Lye. Selago.

New Habitat for Bri/um Tozeri and Hypnum catenulatum.
In the course of 
a ramble with Mr. Ward from Greenhithe to Swanscombe, on Saturday last, April 9, 
201 
1 had the good fortune to discover the Hypniim catenulatum of Schwcegrichen grow- 
ing- on a hedge near Betsham.
It differs (as j'ou will see by the enclosed specimen) 
from the plant bearing the same name described by Hooker, in being furnished with 
a nerve which disappears above the middle of the leaf, while in Hooker's plant the 
nerve is not more than one fourth the length of the leaf.
Bryum Tozeri, which has 
not yet, I believe, been found east of Devonshire, grows very abundantly on the per- 
pendicular side of a deep sand-pit in Swanscombe Park Wood.
Its foliage is very 
luxuriant, but though it bears what appears to be male fructification freely, I could not 
discover any setae.

Note on Lolium multiflomm, (Phytol.
136).
The Lolium I now enclose is 
the one mentioned at p.
136 of ' The Phytologist.' This plant was found in great 
profusion near Manchester in June, 1840, by Messrs.
Crozier and Eversfield of that 
town; they sent me this plant under the name of Lolium perenne, var., they also sent 
it to my friend Mr. Leyland, of Halifax, A short time afterwards Mr. Leyland was 
in a seed-shop in that town, where they told him they had a new grass imported under 
the name of " Italian ray-grass." It struck Mr. Leyland forcibly that this must be 
the same as the Manchester Lolium, he of course procured a few of the seeds and had 
them sown, and on flowering, the plants turned out to be what he expected.
In June, 
1841, in company with my friend Mr. Baines, of York, I visited the neighbourhood of 
Tadcaster, to collect Monotropa Hypopitys, a few of the Carices, &c.
We met with 
a farmer in that part who took us a little out of our way to look at a new grass he told 
us they had just received seeds of; on our arriving at the place it was what I expect- 
ed â€” the Italian ray-grass.

Note on the two forms of Monotropa.
As it is not perhaps generally known 
that we have two very different forms of Monotropa growing in England, the follow- 
ing account of them may be acceptable to some of the readers of ' The Phytologist.
1 .
Monotropa Hypopitys of authors.
In this form of the plant the edges of the outer 
petals (or what Gray calls the calyx) ciliated with strong hairs ; inside of the inner (or 
true) petals densely covered with the same kind of hairs ; stamens also hairy, hairs 
pointing forward.
This form of the plant grows in shady woods, in soil composed of 
the decayed leaves of trees.
I have specimens of the above form from the following 
localities: â€” East Kent, collected about 1836, sent to me by my friend E.
H. Bulton, 
Esq.
: Cotswold Hills, by Mr. Lees : Reigate, Surrey, by Mr. Luxford : and from 
Jackdaw Crags, near Tadcaster, Yorkshire, gathered in that locality by myself.
I have 
also a specimen from the late E.
Hobson, answering to the above characters, but the 
locality is unknown to me.
2. Monotropa Icevipetala, mihi.
In this, the more rare 
form of our Monotropa, the outer and inner petals are smooth in every part ; the sta- 
mens also are quite smooth.
This plant grows in sand, as at Southport, &c.
I have 
a specimen of this form from the north-west end of Selborn Hanger, for which I am 
indebted to my friend Mr. Tatham ; and have seen other specimens from the same 
locality, all of them answering to the above characters.
I have also specimens ga- 
thered at Southport in 1840, by Linnsus Aughton (said to be the original discoverer, 
Phytol.
149), and others gathered by a lady in 1836.
Besides these I have a speci- 
men gathered at Southport in August, 1789, by the late James Bolton, author of Fi- 
lices Britannicae.' This specimen was in the herbarium of the late Dr. Dinely ; that 
herbarium was sold by auction about twenty-five years ago, and fell into my hands 
for the small sum of two shillings and sixpence ; it contained a few rare plants, such 
as Cardamine bellidifolia, &c.
Specimens of this plant [Monotropa] gathered fifty 
202 
years ago perfectly agreeing with specimens gathered at tlie present time, will, I think, 
be sufficient to show that the smoothness of the petals of the Southport Monotropa is 
not accidental ; and as this plant is destitute of hairs on the petals and stamens, per- 
haps it is destitute of smell also.

Reappearance of Gelidiumrostratumin Scotland.
Having seen in the notice of 
Harvey's ' Manual of British Algae,' in ' The Phytologist' (Phytol.
124) that an obser- 
vation is made on the long-disputed plant Gelidium rostratum, that it has not been 
found for thirty years ; I think it will be interesting to your readers to learn that it has 
again made its appearance.
By the kindness of Mi*.
Dickie of Aberdeen, I have re- 
ceived very fine specimens, gathered by him at intervals from December 1841 to March 
of the present year, the latter fresh, and with ripe fruit of both kinds, some of them 
eight inches long; Mr. D.
had one measuring twelve, I have again examined these 
beautiful plants, and have requested a friend to submit them to higher powers of the 
microscope than I possess, and the result of both is a full confirmation of my former 
opinion, that it is decidedly a distinct species, differing in structure from Delesseria 
alata, and that its nearest generic affinity is Gelidium.
Mr. Dickie informs me that 
some fragments were found two years since, and that he has received it lately from 
Montrose ; and as Mr. Brodie originally discovered it at Lossiemouth, it has a consi- 
derable range of coast.
Mr. Dickie also infonns me that it is a deep-water plant â€” 
gi'owing on the old stems of Laminaria digitata, together with Delesseria alata and 
Ptilota plumosa, cast up after storms.

Note on Trichonema Columnte.
In my paper on the Botany of Devon and 
Cornwall (Phytol.
160), I have stated that no plants of Trichonema Columns were 
found during the spring of last year on the Warren at Exmouth, the habitat referred 
to in the British Flora.
I was induced to make this statement on the authority of a 
botanical friend well acquainted with the plant.
From the nature of this interesting 
species I was induced to think that some ruthless collector had extirpated it from the 
Warren, as it did not appear to me probable that flowering bidbs could be in existence 
without disclosing their charms at the proper season.
This, and to supply the wants 
of our Botanical Societies, led me, on Tuesday last, to visit Exmouth for the express 
purpose of seeking out the truth relative to it.
Although rather early for it, I was gra- 
tified in finding it scattered over the waste of sand in several places, but not in abun- 
dance.
It grew amongst the grass (that is, where the grass foimed a kind of turf) at 
the western end of the Warren.
Cladouia rangiferina is in abundance in its neigh- 
bourhood, and seems to confine it within certain limits, as I did not find a single spe- 
cimen protruding from amongst this Lichen where it prevailed in large quantities.

Note on Primula elatior.
During a recent excursion upon the continent, 
whilst botanizing near Spa, in Belgium, I found, growing under some nut-bushes up- 
on the banks of one of the numerous mountain streams in the neighbourhood, three 
young plants of Primula elatior in flower.
Throughout the whole of my walk I did 
not observe a single specimen of the other two species, â€” P.
vulgaris and veris.
The 
plants in question appeared to be about three years old.

Bupleurum tenuissimum.
About the middle of last August in walking through 
some fields on the north of Highgate (I am unable to describe the place, as I was ne- 
ver there before or since), in one field I observed a quantity of Polygonum Aviculare 
204 
growing in a place where water had evidently stood, though then dry.
Induced by its 
luxuriance I gathered a handful, but did not look at it until I had gone a considerable 
distance, when, on examination, I found I had another plant mixed with it, which 
proved to be Bupleurum tenuissimum, a specimen of which I enclose and beg your 
acceptance of.
â€” William Mitten ; 91, Blachnan St., Borough, April 14, 1842.
[We beg our correspondent to accept our thanks for the veiy fine specimen he has 
so obligingly sent; it is larger than any we had previously seen.
On turning to Milne 
and Gordon's ' Indigenous Botany,' we find it recorded that this species was found " by 
Merret, at Paddington beyond the bridge in the way to Harrow upon the Hill, whence 
it is now probably extirpated." The re-discovery of this plant in the neighbourhood 
of the metropolis, is a very interesting circumstance.

Oxlips found at Bardjield, supposed to he identical with the Primula elatior of 
LinncBus. I send you some oxlips from Bardfield, in Essex, which, from a notice in 
the Gardener's Chronicle of the 12th of March, appear to me to be identical with what 
the writer calls the true Primula elatior of Linuceus and the German botanists.
They 
have nodding flowers, and in no instance have I seen single-flowered stalks, as in the 
primrose.
They vary but little, and apparently owing to some having a more favour- 
able situation than others.
They cannot be hybrids, for the primrose does not exist in 
the parish, and these oxlips grow by thousands in the meadows, and in moist woody 
places adjoining ; in one instance a meadow of about two acres is entirely covered by 
them, being a very mass of yellow bloom.
Pagils or cowslips also occur in the neigh- 
â–  bourhood, but prefer dry ground.

The Oxlip.
A notice in the Gardeners'* Chronicle (Oct. 9, 1841),* upon the 
respective relations of an old and long-disputed family, the Primrose, Cowslip, and 
Oxlip, although correct in the main, requires a few observations to make the state of 
the case perfectly clear.
It is probably true that the English Primula elatior or Ox- 
lip (not that of Linnaeus and the continental botanists) is a hybrid between the com- 
mon Primrose (P.
acaulis) and the Cowslip (P.
officinalis).
Two reasons may be 
adduced for this belief: 1st, That England is almost the only country in which the 
Primrose and Cowslip are found in company with each other ; the former being on 
the continent rather a southern plant, ranging from France to Calabria and Asia Mi- 
nor; the latter a northern one, ranging from Finland to the top of the Alps.
Both 
species, may, indeed, be found in mountainous parts of the south of Europe ; the P.
officinalis on the higher parts of the Apennines, and the P, acaulis in the low waim 
grounds of Florence and Naples â€” but not together, nor does the English Oxlip seem 
to be known in those countries.
The union of the Cowslip and Primrose in our banks 
and meadows is no bad type of the climate of England, in which the representatives 
of the northern and southern flora are found side by side, and what wonder if a hy- 
brid be the result .â– ' In confirmation of this view of the true place of the English Ox- 
lip, it must be familiar to every gatherer of wild flowers that Oxlips difl'er greatly from 
one another, as seedling varieties and their descendants often do.
Some are more like 
* No. 149, next page.
205 
one parent, some like another, and perhaps their produce maybe neither pure nor con- 
stant.
Some Oxlips are scarcely anything else than larger-flowered Cowslips, and others 
appear to he merely caulescent, or rather scapescent Primroses.
We look in vain for 
a specific character.
But with regard to the German Oxlip, the true P.
elatior of 
Linnasus and of the German botanists, and which is not yet known to be a native of 
England or of north-western Europe, the case is difi'erent.
It is found in great abun- 
dance throughout Germany, south of the Neckar, and as far as the Italian side of the 
Alps, in the pastures of the Tyrol.
It seems to be subject to no varieties, and is 
found not intermixed with other species, unless, perhaps, with some of the Alpine spe- 
cies in their peculiar localities.
It has a peculiar cramp habit of leaf, a rough scape, 
nodding flowers, swelling calyx, and is scentless.
In beauty it is inferior to either our 
Oxlip or Cowslip, or to P.
Columnee or suaveolens of Italy.
It may rank, perhaps, 
with P.
Pallasii.
The English Oxlip is only known on the continent by its garden 
varieties, namely, the Polyanthus tribe.
Perhaps the north and west of France, where 
the climate is the same as in England, should be excluded from these observations re- 
garding the continent; as it is possible that Brittany and Normandy may possess both 
Primrose and Cowslip, and consequently the Oxlip.

The Primrose, Cowslip and Oxlip.
In your report of the Proceedings of the 
Botanical Society of Edinburgh, p.
645, it is stated, in reference to the variable off"- 
spring of Polyanthus-seed, that " several members expressed their belief that the va- 
rieties arising from Primula vulgaris and P.
elatior of British authors, maybe correctly 
referred to one species ; but that the P.
veris is a distinct and well-marked species, 
never seen to amalgamate with, or pass into the others." Bearing on this point, one 
or two cases have come under ray notice which seem to lead to a contrary conclusion.
I once saw a number of seedlings from the Cowslip (P.
veris), among which there was 
as great a diversity, both in form and colour, as is generally found in a bed of seedling 
Polyanthuses.
Many retained the Cowslip form, but varied in colour from deep yel- 
low, through all the gradations, to dark red ; others, again, approached the Polyan- 
thus in breadth of corolla.
On the other hand, the Primrose (P.
vulgaris) does not 
appear to vary much in fonn, but only in colour, when raised from seed.
At Kiplin, 
in Yorkshire, the seat of the Earl of Tyrconnel, there are Primroses of more than a 
dozen distinct shades of colour, which must originally have sprung from seed ; but al- 
though there are thousands of plants, I have no recollection of ever seeing one among 
them with more than a single flower on a stalk, or betraying any disposition to assume 
the cupped corolla of the Cowslip.
Might not the Oxlip (P.
elatior) be a hybrid be- 
tween the Cowslip and the Primrose ?
The flowers of the common Primrose on the 
flower-stalk of the Cowslip, would be a near approach to the Oxlip.
It is much less 
common (at least wherever I have been) than either the Cowslip or the Primrose, which 
seems to indicate that it is not reproduced freely by seed.

â€” Professor Christison in the chaii-.
The following communications were read.
â€” 
1. Professor Balfour of Glasgow made some remarks on the natural order Lecythidacese, and exhibited 
various specimens of the fruit of Lecythis and Couratari, from Brazil.
Dr. Balfour also exhibited specimens 
of various fossil palms, which had been found embedded in sandstone collected at Stevenston, Ayrshire, by 
the Rev. David Landsborough.
He likewise exhibited specimens of the snake-nut, brought by Dr. Campbell 
from Guiana ; and communicated from Mr. W.
Gourlie, Glasgow, a specimen of a large Sphaeria attached to 
a West Indian caterpillar, and which had commenced its gi-owth during the Ufe of the animal.
2. Dr. Balfour read extracts from a letter addressed to him by Mr. Edward Forbes, dated H.M.S. Bea- 
con, Macri, Asia Minor, February 28th, 1842.
Mr. Forbes's cruise round the islands of the Archipelago, al- 
though rich in results as regards marine Zoology and tertiary Geology, had been almost fruitless in Botany, 
in consequence of the season.
3. Dr. Balfour read his Report on the Progress and State of Botany in Britain, from February 1840 to 
January 1841 ; being a continuation of a paper on the same subject by Dr. Greville, printed in the Society's 
Transactions.
4. Dr. Balfour next read a communication from Mr. Ralfs, of Penzance, on the following species of Al- 
gse.
â€” 1.
Homceocladia anglica, concerning which there appears to be considerable confusion, some looking 
upon Mr. Ealfs's specimens as Schizonema xylodes, others as Oscillatoria chthonoplastes ; and Harvey noti- 
ces them under the name of Microcoleus marinus.
Mr. Ralfs was satisfied of his plant being the true Ho- 
mceocladia anglica, by comparing it with a specimen in the herbarium of Mr. Berkeley.
2. Desmiclium 
compressiim, a new species of the genus, concerning which Mr. Berkeley remarks, â€” "I am quite delighted 
with your new Desmidium ; your observations are very correct.
I see very distinctly the gland between each 
pair of segments ; but as there are no separate joints in my specimen, I cannot quite ascertain its form.
â€” 
It is certainly quite distinct from the other species, and a most interesting discovery." Specimens of both 
these AlgEE, as well as of Desmidium Borreri, were presented to the Society.

A paper was read from Edwin Lees, Esq., F.L.S., being " Remarks on the Flora of the Malvern HQls in 
the counties of Worcester, Hereford and Gloucester.
Part 2 : â€” The Hills and their immediate Roots." In 
geological language the Malvern Hills form an eruptive or igneous chain, stretching in a narrow ridge nearly 
due North and South for upwards of nine miles- Quartz, felspar, mica and hornblende are their mineralo- 
gicul ingredients in luimberlcss varied proportions; but it must be understood that the greater part of the 
207 
mass is in a disinteffrateJ state, breaking up into angular fiagmeuts of every size, and tlms forming debris on 
and materials for soil at the base of the slopes, while hard masses of gi-anitic rock, weathering the atmosphe- 
ric wear and tear of centuries, are of comparatively rare occurrence.
This of course tends greatly to modify 
the capacity of these eminences as depositories of plants ; and although rising up boldly in an insular man- 
ner in the midst of a flat district, and with no superior heights near at hand, their moderate altitude precludes 
the growth of any alpine plants ; while their complete exposure to the blaze of summer even unfits them for 
subalpine species that grow in shady localities farther south.
This may be instanced in Saxifraga hypnoides, 
which, though it grows in the moist recesses of the Cheddar Cliffs, Somersetshire, is entirely absent from every 
part of this rocky range.
On the other hand, Sedum alhum, which no drought can destroy, finds an appro- 
priate home in the exposed cliffs of the principal hills here, flowering when most other plants are completely 
withered and burnt up by the intolerable heat.
The Phanerogamous vegetation of the Malvern Hills is by no means so varied or remarkable as might at 
first have been anticipated from their geographical position.
But in fact the breadth of the chain nowhere 
amounts to a mile, and for the most part does not exceed half a mile.
There are scarcely any longitudinal 
valleys, as in only one place does the chain break distinctly into two parallel heights, and throughout a dis- 
tance of above nine miles there are but five transverse ones.
The average height of the chain above the level 
of the sea is about 1000 feet, the highest hills attaining respectively the altitude of 1300, 1350 and 1444 feet.
â€” 
According to a very accurately taken barometi-ical observation by Mr. Addison of Great Malvern, the Worces- 
tershire Beacon, which, as just stated, is 1444 feet in height by the Ordnance Survey, is only 923 feet above 
the library at Great Malvem, the slope at the base of the hUls being thus shown to be full 600 feet above the 
level of the Severn.
Such a moderate elevation can scarcely be expected to yield plants of an alpine kind, es- 
pecially when the ravines, though not without rocks, possess none of a veiy precipitous character, and the 
streams that trickle down the hills, though abundantly musical, have but very little relation to the torrents 
that dash in thunder down the clifls of stern and rugged mountainous regions.
The late Mr. Purton (author 
of the Midland Flora) remarked that even in Wales he scarcely observed any lichens that were not to be found 
upon the Malvern Hills.
In like manner the mosses are very luxuriant and abundant on the hills as well 
as in the woods around their bases, though the beautiful genus Splachmim Seems to be altogether absent.
â€” 
Jungermaixniee constitute a great proi)ortion of the investiture of the hills, though the variety of species is not 
very remarkable, from the comparative scarcity of dripping rocks, yet in one shadowy laviue at least the 
beautiful Junyerinannia iomentella is found.
Jung, resupinatais rather abundant, and Jung, ciliaris is ex- 
cessively common.
The Fungi are pretty numerous, and, as might be expected, the Agaric tribe in particu- 
lar is profusely scattered on the grassy declivities of the hills in the autumnal season.
Many species of ferns 
are found in extreme profusion on the rocks as well as on every boggj- declivity ; and in the damp woods on 
either side the range, Polypodium vulgare, Aspidium aculeatum and lohatum and AspUnium Filix-fcemina 
are particularly abundant; while Fteris aquilina covers the sides of the hills in every part.
Among the ra- 
rer species are AUosorus crispun and Polypodium Dryopteris, while Asplenium viride gi-ows on an old bridge 
across the Teme, about eight miles north of Great Malvem, on the extreme verge of the district.
Aspidium 
Oreopteris is rather plentiful wherever a boggy soil presents itself.
Grammitis Ceterach, though occurring 
on old walls at Great Malvern, can scarcely be called a legitimate denizen, for not a stray individual occurs 
on any of the rocks.
The Eriophori are almost the only vascular plants that give anything like a subalpine aspect to the ve- 
getation of Malvern, and even these now only occur in a few favoured spots.
Eriophorum polystachion and 
pubescens give a pretty aspect to the bogs on the western side of the hills, to which at the present time they are 
limited ; while E.
angustifolium occupies marshy spots in the low country on the eastern side.
The Cypcra- 
cea; are pretty abundant in the numerous wet spots about the hills, though mostly of small size, and none 
very rare or peculiar.
The following species have been gathered.
â€” 
Scirpus setaceus Care.x vulpina 
Blysmus compressus teretiuscula 
Eleocharis palustris stellulata 
multicaulis curta 
pauciflora ovalis 
Carex ilioica remota 
pulicaris axillaris 
intei-media pendula 
muricata sylvatica 
divulsa.
The most abundant grasses forming the turf of the hills are Anthoxanthttm odoratum, C'ynosttrus cristattm, 
Fesiuca oi'ina, Agrostis vulgaris, Avenafiavescens, Aira flexuosa, prcEcox and caryophyllea : those of rarer 
occuiTCnce are Aira cristata, Triodia decumhens, Festuca Myurus, Glyceria rigida and Nardus strictii.
â€” 
The latter indeed is plentiful on the commons at the eastern base of the hills, with most of the commoner grass- 
es.
Mr. L.
had seen Avena fatua in wheat-fields at the base of the hills almost as plentiful as the corn among 
which it grew.
The former marshy state of the country at the eastern base of the hills is shown by the abun 
dance, in spots not yet fully drained, oi Poa aqvatica andfluitans, Phalaris arundinacea, Ariindo Plirag 
Carex Pseudo-cypenis

208 
tes, Catabrosa aquatica and Calamagrostis Epigejos; the latter of which forms a dense fi'iugs to the hedges 
and ditches in marshy fields.
The genus Ti/oha is not very common in the district, although in one or two 
spots T.
angustifoUa rather prevails.
On the rocks aiipear : â€”

Habenaria viridis 
bifolia 
chlorantha 
Neottia spiralis 
Plantago Coronopus 
Allium vineale 
Polygonum Bistorta 
minus 
Ranunculus parviflorus 
In thickets at the foot of the hills and skirting their bases, wild roses are exceedingly abundant and beau- 
tiful, and Mr. Lees had collected the following.
â€” 
Rosa spinosissima Rosa tomentosa Rosa rubiginosa Rosa Forsteri 
villosa inodora canina systyla 
scabriuscula micrantha dumetorum arvensis 
The deep-coloured blossoms of Rosa villosa axe very remarkable, and the pale ones of R.
scabriuscula cha- 
racteristic ; R.
micrantha and systyla are of frequent occurrence.
The Rubi are of equal if not superior luxuriance, in many remarkable forms, which are still under Mr.
Lees' obsei-vation.
It may be here sufficient to state that the glandulose forms are rather abundant : Rubus 
carpinifolius seems the most uncommon species.
In the woods oak {Querctis Robtis) predominates above every other tree, and on the ridge-way in Eastnor 
Park is one about 150 years old, which is adorned with a fine coronal of mistletoe.
Q. sessiliflora al so pre- 
sents itself, but assuredly much less in quantity than the former, though it boasts a white-leaved variety not 
mentioned by botanists, so far as Mr. Lees was aware of.
A hamlet occupying the valley between tlie Ragged 
Stone and Keysand Hills (the two most southerley ones of the chain), bears the appellation of " The Wliite- 
leaved Oak," but after several visits to the place Mr. L.
could never find any remarkable oak there, and was 
indeed assured by a man who had known the vicinity many years, that there had formerly been an oak there 
with light or whitish foliage, but that it had been cut down.
Here the matter rested till 1841, when wander- 
ing about the syenitic protuberances at the extreme northern termination of the hills, Mr. L.
fortunately came 
upon an oak whose leaves were variegated with white, growing on one of these rocky knolls, and it proved to 
be Quercus scssilifiora, doubtless similar in the character of its foliage to the old " WJtite-leaved Oak" that 
has bequeathed its name to the hamlet before mentioned.
The prevalence of West, South-west and Southern winds at Malvern, especially during the winter and 
spring months, gives an almost perpetual moisture to the grassy tui-f favourable to Cryptogamic growth ; but 
the violence of the winds has the effect of keeping the Phsenogamic vegetation in a very dwarf state, especially 
near the summits of the hills.
This is observable particularly in Carlina imlgaris, which is often very lux- 
uriant at the base of the hUls and only a few inches in height on the summit of the Herefordshire Beacon.
â€” 
Other plants seem influenced in the same way, as Myosotis coUina, which on the ridge scarcely peers above 
the soil and is excessively hirsute.
The following are the rarer plants not alluded to in Mr. Lees' former paper.
Veronica montana 
Myosotis collina 
versicolor 
Cynoglossum sylvaticum 
Hyoscyamus niger 
Campanula patula 
latifolia

bills (sending specimens to the Society) in a future paper.

PILL-WORT OR PEPPER-GRASS.
PiLULARIA GLOBULIFERA of AuthorS, 
The Pill-wort or Pepper-grass seems pretty generally, though not 
plentifully, distributed over the United Kingdom.
It is found on the 
extreme margins of ponds, or on swampy ground, submerged during 
the winter and more or less exposed during the summer.
It is some- 
times so abundant as to form a dense and almost inextricably matted 
covering to the ground.
In no instance that has come to my know- 
ledge has it been found in deep water, or in a state of constant sub- 
mersion.
The figures of this plant are generally characteristic, but nearly all 
of them eiT in not representing it sufficiently slender ; the best I 
T 
210 
have seen are those by Bernard de Jussieu, published in the ' Me- 
moires de I'Academie Royale des Sciences,'* and by Mr. Valentine, 
in the ' Transactions of the Linnean Society.'f Both these authors 
have given fidl and interesting details of its history, and seem so com- 
pletely to have preoccupied the ground as to leave little or nothing 
for me to add.
An abstract of Mr. Valentine's paper has already ap- 
peared in 'The Phytologist' (Phytol.
55), and a second detail of his 
observations would not be justifiable.
The roots are generally two or three inches in length, very flexi- 
ble, slender, and but slightly branched ; they are hollow, and divided 
by several longitudinal septa ; they appear to descend pei-pendicularly 
into the mud or moistened earth in which the plant is found : they 
spring from a creeping rhizoma, which is also hollow and longitudi- 
nally divided ; it is very slender and cylindrical, and the terminal or 
growing portion is invariably covered with a close investment of scales 
or scale-like hairs ; these, like a similar investment common to the 
creeping rhizomata of Polypodium vulgare, Davallia canariensis, and 
several other ferns, fall off with age, leaving the rhizoma perfectly na- 
ked and smooth.
The roots spring from the rhizoma at intervals of 
considerable regularity, usually measuring about the thii-d of an inch: 
they are generally three or four in a cluster, and immediately above 
them rise an equal number of erect, slender, smooth, setiform, pointed 
leaves : these are hollow like the roots and rhizoma ; they are ra- 
ther longer than the roots, and when they first make their appearance 
are rolled up in a manner precisely analogous to that exhibited in the 
circinate vernation of ferns.
At many of the points of the rhizoma 
whence spring the leaves and roots, it also emits a small lateral 
branch, which bears leaves and roots at intervals like the parent rhi- 
zoma ; and when this, in the course of nature, decays, these lateral 
branches continue vigorous, and become the nuclei whence future 
plants originate.
The lateral branches occur with great regularity 
alternately on the right and left of the parent rhizoma ; 
in proportion to their distance from the terminal point 
of the rhizoma these lateral branches increase in 
length, and the angles at which they join it become 
more and more obtuse.
The capsule is placed on a short stalk in the axil 
of the leaves : when full grown it occasionally attains 
the size of an ordinary pepper-corn, and is neaiiy 
spherical, but slightly elongated at its apex ; it is closely covered with

211 
a dense investment of hair.
When mature* it opens at the apex, 
dividing longitudinally into four parts, each of which continues at- 
tached by its inferior extremity to the common footstalk.
Each of these four parts is hollow, and its cavity, which retains the 
figure of a quarter sphere, is filled with an hermaphrodite flower com- 
posed of stamens and pistils arranged on a common placenta.
This 
placenta is a membranous band attached to the interior spherical por- 
tion of the membrane which invests the 
capsule.
The pistils, according to Jus- 
sieu, are ranged on the inferior part of the 
placenta, and consequently occupy the 
lower portion of the common receptacle, 
as exhibited in the annexed cut, which is 
copied, with some slight alterations, from 
Mr. Valentine's figure.f The shaded bo- 
dies represent the so-called pistils of Jus- 
sieu, and one of these detached is repre- 
sented below, with its gelatinous covering, the result of immersion 
in water.
The upper part of each cell is occu- 
pied by smaller granules, which are described as 
stamens, but this appears a somewhat vague conjec- 
ture, their office as such never having been clearly 
proved.
Whatever may be the correct designation 
of the larger granules in their earlier state, it is quite 
certain that they ultimately become true seeds ; for 
both the authors quoted have succeeded in tracing 
their germination, and have recorded their observations on the subject 
with a close con'espondence which mutually proves their accuracy 
and precision ; the improvement in the structure of microscopes and 
the more artistical drawing of Mr. Valentine giving however a decided 
superiority to his illustrations.
These observations are made on the 
assumption that Mr. Valentine was entirely unacquainted with the 
contents of M.
Jussieu's admirable essay, which, from an observation 
in his introductory remarks, I most readily believe.
According to Jussieu the seeds of Pilularia are to be found in the 
months of September and October, floating on the surface of the wa- 
ter and germinating in that situation.

â€” Sketch of an Excursion to the Clova Mountains, in 
Juhj and August, 1840.* By William Gardiner, Esq., Jun.
In company with a botanical friend, I left Dundee on the morning 
of the 27th of July by the first railway train for Glammis, where we 
arrived about half past 10 o'clock.
Between that place and Kinie- 
muir nothing of consequence attracted our attention, except abun- 
dance of Galeopsis versicolor in the cornfields, and the unusual beauty 
and exuberance of the more common flowers.
We despatched our 
baggage to Clova from Kirriemuir, and walked on ourselves for the 
purpose of botanizing by the way.
From the latter place to Cortachy 
there was little to cheer us save our own glad thoughts and joyful an- 
ticipations, and the beauty of the scenery through which we passed, 
steeped in the bright radiance of a summer sun.
Beyond Cortachy, 
however, we began to come among the mountains, and some traces of 
subalpine vegetation made their appearance.
Agrostis vulgaris var.
7. 
pumila was our first acquisition, and soon after we came upon Habe- 
naria bifolia and Narthecium ossifi-agum, both very common to sub- 
alpine places, such as the Sidlaw Hills.
We next met with Viola 
lutea in grassy places by the waysides ; and this beautiful mountain 
violet occurred more or less profusely all the way up the glen to its 
very top.
On little knolls beyond a miserable public-house dignified 
by the high-sounding appellation of the Red Lion Inn, we met with 
Habenaria albida : and being now at the foot of the mountains we made 
a short deviation from the road, and gathered firom a large detached 
rock Alectoria jubata var.
(3.
chalybeiformis and Andra3a rupestris.
By the sides of rills abundance of Saxifraga stellaris and aizoides 
showed themselves, and on the heaths we picked a single stalk of 
Erica Tetralix with white flowers, and one or two of the pink-flowered 
variety of E.
cinerea.
Farther up the Glen we found Meum athaman- 
ticum in abundance by the waysides, and by the margin of the Esk 
grew Carex aquatilis in great luxuriance, along with Galium boreale, 
and here and there a specimen of Cnicus heterophyllus.
Some little 
distance beyond the " smithy" Pyrola media occurred, though spar- 
ingly and past its prime, as was Polygonum viviparum with which it 
was associated.
Alchemilla alpina now showed itself, and was our 
constant companion wherever Ave went, during our stay at Clova.
Pretty well loaded for the first day, we reached the hamlet of Clova 
in time to enjoy the glorious spectacle of an alpine sun- set, and soon

213 
after did complete justice to the good cheer prepared for us by Mary 
Findlay.
We next morning went up the mountains to Loch Brandy, for the 
twofold pm-pose of enjoying the sight of its wild and picturesque 
scenery, and searching out the botanical treasures of its surrounding 
rocks.
On the marshy banks of the stream by which we ascended we 
found Veronica serpyllifolia var.
^, alpina, Epilobium alpinum and al- 
sinifolium, and great profusion of Saxifraga aizoides and S.
stellaris.
These plants we aftei-wards found more or less abundant by the sides 
of all the streams in the district which we examined.
The first view 
we had of the Loch was from an unfavourable position, and we felt 
disappointed ; but as we advanced up the steep hill on the left hand 
side, our admiration increased at every step, till at length, having 
gained the summit, and descended a few yards among the over- 
hanging clitfs, the whole grandeur of the scene burst upon our enrap- 
tured gaze.
Far below lay the dark lake, slumbering in its mountain 
solitude, wliile around it rose, guardian-like, the mighty cliffs, sun- 
ning their rugged brows in the sweet light of the morning, and look- 
ing proud in their magnificence.
Quietness brooded in the still air, 
and no somid was heard to break the awful tranquillity, save when the 
distant bleat of a sheep fell upon the startled ear, or the plaintive tones 
of my companion's flute awoke the echoes of the wild rocks.
We 
feasted om'selves for some time on the sublimity of this alpine picture, 
and then turned our attention to the gems of beauty which the fair 
hand of Flora had profusely scattered around.
We here gathered 
Azalea procumbens, Gnaphalium supinum, Rubus Chamaemorus, Ly- 
copodium Selago and alpinum, Polytrichum alpinum, Conostomum 
boreale, Splachnum mnioides, and, at the risk of breaking our necks, 
Cerastium alpinum and Saxifraga hypnoides.
At the head of the Loch 
we descended by a terrific water-course to its margin, collecting in 
our way Saxifraga oppositifolia, Salix herbacea, Hieracium alpinum, 
Rhodiola rosea, Weissia acuta, Didymodon capillaceus and rigidulus, 
the latter but sparingly ; and among the rocks on the banks of the 
Loch there was an exuberance of Arbutus Uva-ursi and Vaccinium 
Vitis-idaea, but neither of them in flower.
We went round about the small lochs looking for Isoetes lacustris, 
and picked up a specimen or two, but saw no appearance of it in a 
growing state, and did not think of wading in search of it, otherwise 
we should have reaped a rich harvest, as it was found, along with Lo- 
belia Dortmanna, in the greatest abundance, by my friends Messrs.
Croall and Kerr, in September.
Among the rocks, just where the 
214 
southmost stream issues from the Loch, we met with the elegant Hyp- 
nura Silesianum.
A little farther down we came upon some fine tufts 
of Aspidium Lonchitis, and before reaching the hamlet plenty of Po- 
lypodium Phegopteris.
Our next excursion was to Glen Dole, and a perilous one it was, 
partly owing to our inexperience of the place.
On leaving the ham- 
let we picked a few specimens of Carex ovalis ; and at Bradooney we 
spent a considerable time searching for Oxytropis campestris among 
" rocks facing the south," but found only Habenaria viridis and Mar- 
chantia hemisphserica for our trouble.
Oxyria reniformis was plentiful 
on the banks of the Esk near Achame, but we found it in a much finer 
state on a small island in the Dole, near where it is joined by Kilbo 
Bum. On this island there was also abundance of Valeriana offici- 
nalis, Solidago Virgaurea and Festuca ovina var.
e. vivipara : the latter 
plant was plentiful in many places, but nowhere finer than here.
We 
went up Glen Phee a considerable distance, but finding nothing ex- 
cept Junipems communis and Arbutus Uva-ursi, retraced our steps 
and ascended the face of Craig Rennet by an untrodden path, so pre- 
carious that the very recollection of it almost curdles the blood in 
one's veins.
Our toil was rewarded, however, with fine specimens of 
Silene acaulis, Andrgea alpina, Conostomum boreale, Weissia acuta, 
Jungermannia nemorosa, var./5.
purpurascens, &c.
; and on the summit 
there was abundance of Cetraria Islandica.
This interesting lichen, 
which we had hitherto looked upon as a rarity, was plentiful on all 
the Clova mountains which we visited, and in fine condition, though 
barren.
Proceeding along the ridge towards Craig Maid, we found in 
boggy places Vaccinium uliginosum, and several beautifiil patches of 
Splachnum sphaericum ; and on the summit of Craig Maid Luzula 
spicata.
We had intended to have gone to the White Water and 
come round by the head of Glen Dole, but time forbade, as the day 
was wearing to a close, and we therefore determined to attempt de- 
scending into Glen Dole.
The ascent of Craig Rennet had inured us 
to danger, and we did not hesitate to choose for our path a wild and 
dismal-looking water-course that led us down the very face of Craig 
Maid.
By caution and perseverance we accomplished our task, and 
reaped in our way a rich botanical harvest.
Among our acquisitions 
were the beautiful Lycopodium annotinum, Hieracium alpinum and 
Halleri, Cnicus heterophyllus, Aspidium Lonchitis, Rhodiola rosea 
in great perfection, and various other species which we had previously 
met with.
During our stay at Clova we made two other trips to Glen Dole.
215 
The first of these was on the 31st of July.
We ascended Craig Mel- 
lon from Achame, collecting in our way fine specimens of Gnaphalium 
supinum, Saxifraga oppositifolia and Lycopodium selaginoides, and 
on the stones at its summit Lecanora venlosa.
Proceeding along the 
ridge we picked specimens of Bryum alpinum and a few Junger- 
raanniae, and came upon the Dole at its junction with the White 
Water.
About the falls we gathered Rhodiola rosea, Lycopodium 
annotinum, Cnicus heterophyllus and a variety with deeply cut leaves, 
Thalictrum alpinum, Hieracium pulmonarium, Carex curta, fiilva, 
sylvatica, binerns and several others, Salix alba and arenaria, Pyrus 
aucuparia, Veronica alpina and Phleum alpinum.
The two latter 
plants occurred, though sparingly, both above and below the falls.
In the crevices of the rocks below we found Bryum elongatum, cm- 
dum and ventricosum, and a slender state of Trichostomum aciculare.
On the banks of the White Water above the falls we met with Juncus 
triglumis, and proceeding round by the shieling at the head of Glen 
Dole we collected Melampp'um pratense, Cornus suecica, and Rubus 
Chamaemorus in flower and fruit.
On our third visit, August 5th, we examined some of the rocks a 
short distance below the falls of the White Water, and had the good 
fortune to discover the beautiful Hypnum Crista-castrensis in fructi- 
fication, and the rare Dicranum polycarpon ; and on the moist preci- 
pices almost within reach of the spray, a few specimens of Erigeron 
alpinus and Asplenium viride.
Jungermannia Blasia occurred in cre- 
vices of rocks by the side of the Dole.
At the head of Glen Dole, 
after an eager search, we came upon the bog where Carex rariflora 
grows, and found it in the greatest profiision.
Before we had satisfied 
ourselves with the much-prized rarity, the evening mist had gathered 
around us, and so densely, that we could not see more than a few feet 
beyond us.
Had we not taken our bearings well we should have been 
truly bewildered, and run the risk of ending our career at the bottom 
of the neighbouring precipices ; but by the aid of our compass we 
managed to reach the shieling, and the shepherd carefully put us on 
" Jock's road," which, though not a very " redd " road, led us safely 
down the glen.
We spent a day on Carlowie hill gathering lichens, for few flow- 
ering plants of interest were there, except Arbutus Uva-ursi.
We 
picked from the rocks and stones numerous specimens of Gyrophora 
cylindrica, proboscidea and polyphylla, Comicularia tristis and lanata, 
Stereocaulon paschale, Sphserophoron coralloides and one tuft of var.
/5.
(the Sph. fragile of Acharius) in fructification.
These lichens were 
216 
also abundant on the hill above the hamlet of Clova, as well as several 
others, particularly Lecanora tartarea and Parmelia omphalodes.
On 
the " Greenhill," south of Loch Brandy, we found Spergula subulata 
and Azalea procumbens.
To the Bassies mountain we made two visits, and found several 
good things.
Azalea procumbens was plentiful on its summit, asso- 
ciated with Salix herbacea and Juncus trifidus : the specimens of the 
latter plant gathered here, however, were stunted and insignificant in 
their appearance compared with the fine tufts which we culled from 
the fissures of the roots about half way down.
Carex rigida was 
fi-equent ; Alchemilla alpina literally mantled the mountain with its 
silvery foliage ; and we noticed Sibbaldia procumbens and Tofieldia 
palustris, but without flowers.
On the summit there was a profusion 
of Cetraria nivalis, and we also gathered Solorina crocea, Cornicula- 
ria aculeata in fruit, Lecidea fusco-lutea and Splachnum sphsericura ; 
and in a bog was Polytrichum juniperinum, var.
|3.
gracilius (the P.
strictum of Menzies).
Between Bassies and Scorie there was plenty of 
Conostomum boreale and Polytrichum hercjTiicum, together with Di- 
cranum StarMi, subulata and virens.
Polytrichum alpinum was in 
abundance everywhere on the mountains at a good elevation.
By the 
side of a watercouse in descending from the Bassies we met with a 
specimen or two of Alopecuius alpinus, Hieracium alpinum and Hal- 
leri ; but the most interesting of our acquisitions on the Bassies was 
Jungermannia ciliaris with calyces, which are of exceedingly rare oc- 
currence.
The calyx-bearing plants were very small and perfectly 
procumbent, growing among tufts of Dicranum scoparium.
We also 
found on this mountain beautiful specimens of Tetraphis pellucida in 
fruit.
On the banks of the Esk about Clova there was plenty of Carex 
ampullacea and Geranium sylvaticum, with Galium palustre var.
/3.
Witheringii and Cnicus heterophyllus ; and we also found Rumex 
aquaticus and Rubus suberectus.
The latter plant occurred in many 
places in the valleys as well as on the mountains.
On our return down the glen we met with nothing that we had not 
previously seen in the district, except Triodia decumbens, which grew 
on small hillocks by the waysides.
This being our first visit to these mountains the ground was entirely 
new to us, and particular localities quite unknown, so that M^e were 
unsuccessful in obtaining many of the rarities which are there to be 
found.
Professor Balfour, who is intimately acquainted with the dis- 
trict, procured, just before we left, Dryas octopetala, Veronica saxati- 
217 
lis, Liunoea borealis, Malaxis paludosa, Sonchus alpinus and Salix 
lanata.
From my second visit, which I hope to be able to make this 
summer, better results may reasonably be anticipated.

~ Notes on Arenaria rubra, marina, and media.
By Samuel Gibson, Esq.
Hebden Bridge, May 5, 1842.
Sir, 
A difference of opinion having long existed as to 
whether Arenaria rubra and marina are two distinct plants, or only 
varieties of one species ; in order to set this question at rest in my 
own mind, I procured specimens of the two plants from every locality 
where I could possibly get them from, either by sending to my friends 
or by collecting them myself After collecting what specimens 1 
could get, I gave them a careful examination, and am now of opinion 
that Arenaria rubra and marina, and the media of Linnaeus, all three 
possess permanent characters sufficient to keep them distinct as spe- 
cies.
Arenaria marina and media I have found plentifully growing- 
together, each retaining its characteristic marks ; the seeds of media 
being bordered with a striated membrane, while those of marina are 
destitute of such a border.
What Sir W.
J. Hooker's Arenaria rubra may be I know not.
The 
calyx is said to be nerveless; such a character I have not been able 
to find in any of the three forms.
It may require further investiga- 
tion in order to decide M'hether or not Sir W.
J. Hooker's plant be 
something very different from anything I have ever seen j but what 
specimens I possess will answer to the following descriptions.
1. Arenaria rubra, (Red Sandwort).
Stems procumbent, smooth, 
except near the flowers, where they have a few glandular hairs such 
as cover the calyx and flower-stalks : leaves linear, flat, tenninating 
in a small bristle : segments of the calyx ovate, acute, three-nerved, 
the two lateral nerves very short, the middle one as long as the seg- 
ment : seeds small, somewhat pyriform, thick in proportion to their 
breadth, rough all over with raised points.
My specimens are from Hiuldcrslickl, Halifax, &c.
218 
B. hrevifolia, mihi.
This variety differs from the more common 
state of Arenaria rubra in the intemodes of the stems and the leaves 
being only about half the length, and in the flowers being more nu- 
merous, &c.
Common in the neighbourhood of Manchester, as at Kersal Moor, &c.
2. Arenaria marina^ (Marine Sandwort).
Stems procumbent, 
smooth : leaves as long as the internodes, blunt at the point, semi- 
cylindrical : capsule as long as the calyx : segments of the calyx 
ovate, three-ribbed, ribs pellucid : seeds ear-shaped, thickened and 
rough on their edges, depressed and nearly smooth in the middle, 
nearly twice the size of those of Arenaria rubra.
This appears to be somewhat rare ; some of my specimens are from the Yorkshire 
coast at Bridlington and Scarborough, and others from near Liverpool.
&. hirsuta, mihi.
This differs from the above in the stems being 
wholly covered with glandular hairs.
My specimens are from Newlyn Cliff, near Penzance, Cornwall.
3. Are?iaria media, (Smooth-seeded Sandwort).
Stems procum- 
bent, smooth : leaves as long as the internodes, blunt at the point, 
semicylindrical, fleshy, flaccid when dry : capsule twice the length of 
the calyx : segments of the calyx obovate, three-nerved, nerves pel- 
lucid : seeds ear-shaped, smooth, much larger than those of Arenaria 
marina, with a broad, white, striated border.
This appears to be the most common of the three plants, as I have specimens from 
the following localities, viz., North shore, Liverpool, Southport &c., Lancashire ; Wal- 
lazey pool, Cheshire ; &c.
I also have it from two three localities in Ireland, and 
others from Scotland.
If you should think the above remarks worthy a place in your peri- 
odical, they are at your service.
Yours, &c.
Saml.
Gibson.

â€” On tJie escape of Fluid from the Apex of the Leaf of 
RicJiardia (cthiopica, Kunth, [Calla athiopica, Linn.) By 
Edwin J.
Quekett, Esq., F.L.S., B.S., &c.
My attention having been directed to this fact by my friend Mr.
Ward, and having a large case constructed after his plan for the 
growth of plants, T placed within it, in the summer, with numerous 
219 
others, a healthy specimen of Kichardia gethiopica, which was kept 
well supplied with water.
It was soon perceived that the dripping 
from the apex of the leaf had commenced, and it continued as long as 
the weather was warm.
On experimenting on this plant it was found that the greatest num- 
ber of drops in a given time were to be obtained soon after the sun 
had ceased to shine on the plant, which was at mid-day ; the number 
never exceeded one in a minute, and generally they were not so fre- 
quent as this.
I was anxious to collect some of the fluid in order to 
analyze it, and suspended a small vessel near to the apex ; during 
the day and night I could thus obtain two or three drams from one 
leaf.
It was perfectly bright in colour and tasteless, and on apply- 
ing tests which usually exhibit impurities in water no reaction could 
be obtained.
The plant was sometimes watered with a decoction of 
logwood, yet no indication of its presence could be detected in the 
colour of the fluid, or by the salts of iron ; in fact it appeared to be 
pure water, notwithstanding that lime and other matters must have 
been present in the water applied to the roots.
Reflecting on the purity of the fluid, and how the plant could so 
effectually separate the soluble impurities from the water absorbed, I 
was at a loss to conceive how such a quantity could escape from the 
minute apex, which it always did, and not from sundry other spots 
then trickling towards the point, previous to its falling from the leaf 
As the escape of this fluid does not often occur when the plant is 
out of doors, or if the sun shines on it when confined under glass, it 
was imagined that under either of these conditions the evaporation 
from the surface of the plant might be sufficient to carry off" any ex- 
cess of water sent by the roots into the interior, under the stimulus of 
increased temperature ; and that when evaporation could not so pro- 
ceed, the channels which conveyed the fluid became surcharged, and 
the apex, which seems as it were the confluence of numerous minute 
streams, gives exit to the excess collected on account of suppressed 
evaporation.
It became necessary to apply to the anatomy of the leaf in order to 
account for and prove the escape of the fluid from the apex.
The 
leaves of this plant are arrow-shaped, and terminated by a nearly cy- 
lindrical point, varying fi'om half an inch to three quarters in length, 
and about the twentieth part of an inch in diameter.
The venation 
makes one of the exceptions to the general rule, that the leaves of all 
Endogens are straightly veined, for in this leaf is to be noticed an 
arrangement of veins somewhat analogous to that of an Exogenous 
220 
plant, being in this instance especially allied to the leaf of a plant 
belonging to the order Myrtaceee, on account of the presence of a 
distinct marginal vein.
A strong midrib proceeds from the pe- 
tiole for some distance up the leaf, and is gradually attenuated and 
expended by giving off numerous branches, which take a curved di- 
rection outwards and forwards, and which are intercepted before they 
reach the margin, by the vein running parallel to the circumference, 
which has its commencement at the petiole and its termination in the 
apex ; consequently each vein has a tendency to carry its fluid to- 
wards the apex by the intervention of this marginal vein.
And there 
is no doubt that the fluid is conducted by these courses, for if any one 
be wounded by a sharp instrument, dropping will proceed from the 
wound as well as from the point ; besides, the veins do not form pro- 
minent opaque ribs as in many exogens, but are level with the surfa- 
ces of the leaf; and when examined by transmitted light they appear 
the most transparent portions, an indication of their being full of fluid.
If the attenuated apex of the leaf be examined by dissection, mi- 
croscopically, it will be found to present some few stomata on its 
cuticle and a dense bundle of vessels in its centre, surrounded by 
cellular tissue containing multitudes of acicular raphides; and I could 
never carry the dissection fine enough to discover whether or not 
these vessels communicate with the surface or the caverns with which 
the stomata are connected.
From the anatomy of the leaf it would appear that the surcharged 
vessels all propel their contents towards its point, and the excess 
finds the means of escape as through a filter.* It cannot be from 
gravity, for it occurs whilst the young leaf is making its appearance, 
before it unrols, when the sharp-pointed apex is in the most elevated 
position, being quite perpendicular.
If it occurred only when the 
leaf was pendulous, it might be imagined that the liquid was conden- 
sed in the cavernous tissue of the leaf, and escaped through the sto- 
mata fi'om gravity ; but as this is not the case, it must be considered 
that this peculiarly constructed apex is a beautiful provision â€” a kind 
of natural safety-valve, for permitting the superabundance of watery 
fluid to be readily removed, the retention of which might be connected 
with unhealthy action in the economy of this elegant plant.
The escape of fluid from the apex of the leaf is not peculiar to Ri- 
chardia, as many other plants, when grown under glass will exhibit 
* The apex of the spathe, in its eavly state, will also exhibit the phenomeaon ; as 
will also a leaf when a fifth of its point has lost the signs of vitality.
221 
the phenomenon, as young plants of barley and wheat ; consequently 
I conceive that there must be some special contrivance of nature in 
these leaves, perhaps in all leaves, to guard against the accumulation 
of watery fluid.
The opportunity of witnessing these experiments can in no way be 
so successfully obtained, or their results so satisfactorily examined, as 
in Mr. Ward's cases ; which gives us another instance of the useful 
adaptation of this plan to the pursuit of experimental inquiries re- 
specting the functional operations performed during the growth of 
plants.

â€” Analytical Notice of a treatise 'On the Growth of 
Plants in Closely Glazed Cases.'' By N, B.
Ward, F.L.S.
London : John Van Voorst.
1842.
8vo.
The lovers of Nature and of Nature's works are deeply indebted to 
the author of this treatise, for showing them by what means plants 
may be made to grow and thrive in situations where kw could even 
exist before.
For although the fact that plants will live and grow 
without direct communication with the external atmosphere, may have 
been often observed long before the fern and gi-ass sprang up in Mr.
Ward's closed glass cylinder, yet to that gentleman is undoubtedly 
due the sole merit of so closely reasoning upon a simple circumstance 
luiexpectedly brought under his notice, as to have deduced from it 
principles which have already led to important results, while it is not 
improbable that consequences still more important yet remain to be 
disclosed.
By means of this mode of cultivating plants, the botanist may cre- 
ate for himself, even within the " brick-wall bounds " of any of our 
large towns, such a scene of natural beauty as will in some measure 
compensate for his exclusion from the pleasure of studying his favor- 
ites in their own native haunts.
In many respects indeed he will be 
a gainer, in the facilities for study afforded by the naturalization of 
the denizens of the wild wood or the snow-capped mountain under 
his own roof, nay, even by his own fire-side : for rarely is a botanist 
placed in such favorable circumstances as to be able to do more than 
collect specimens of plants, as they are met with in his too often hur- 
222 
ried excursions ; and specimens so collected generally form the only 
materials with which is reared many a plausible hypothesis relating 
to specific distinction or identity.
But now the student may have 
his plants living under his own eye â€” may watch their growth 
from day to day â€” from hour to hour.
In the case of a fern, he may 
scatter its sporules and observe the first appearance of the slightest 
possible tinge of green on the surface of the soil ; then after a time he 
will note the expansion of the first seedling fronds ; and so step by 
step proceeds the progi'ess of development, until he perceives with 
dehght â€” 
" Each stem and leaf wrapped small, 
Coil'd up within each other 
Like a round and hairy ball." 
Then again how closely may he 
" Watch that ball unfolding 
Each closely nestling curl, 
And its fair and feathery leaflets 
Their spreading foims unfurl !
" 
And all this pleasure and instruction he may secure, even in the most 
impure atmosphere, by the simple expedient of surrounding his pro- 
teges with glass, which, while it allows of the free passage of light, 
â€” a most essential condition in the culture of plants, effectually 
prevents the access of fuhginous matter and loss of moisture by 
evaporation, and at the same time ensures a calm atmosphere and 
a more equable temperature.
In the treatise before us Mr. Ward has published the results of his 
thirteen years' experience in the mode of growing plants in closely 
glazed cases.
The work is divided into six chapters, and the con- 
tents of these we give below.
Chap.
I. â€” On the Natural Conditions of Plants.
Unless we pos- 
sess some knowledge of the conditions which regulate the growth of 
plants in a state of nature, it is evident that our treatment of them in 
cultivation must be more or less defective.
These conditions vary in 
an almost endless degree ; plants being " influenced by the atmo- 
sphere, heat, light, moisture, varieties of soil, and periods of rest." 
The growth of plants is most sensibly affected by the purity or impu- 
rity of the atmosphere : the heat to which they are subjected has a 
range, at different seasons and in different countries, of not less than 
150Â° : the intensity of light " varies from almost total darkness to a 
light double that of our brightest summer's day :" then again " the 
223 
states of moisture vary as much as those of heat and light " : varieties 
of soil also visibly affect plants : and lastly â€” 
" All plants require rest, and obtain it in some countries by the rigour of winter ; 
in others by the scorching and arid heat of summer.
Some, " after short slumber 
wake to life again," while the sleep of others is unbroken for many months.
This is 
the case with most alpine plants, and is necessary to their well-being.
* * In 
Egypt the blue water-lily obtains rest in a curious way.
Mr. Traill, the gardener of 
Ibrahim Pacha, infonned me that this plant abounds in several of the canals at Alex- 
andria, which at certain seasons become dry ; and the beds of these canals, which 
quickly become burnt as hard as bricks by the action of the sun, are then used as car- 
riage-roads.
When the water is again admitted the plant resumes its growth with 
redoubled vigour.'' â€” p.
5. 
On the power possessed by plants of adapting themselves in a cer- 
tain degree to the circumstances in which they are placed, the author 
remarks : â€” 
" To suit all the varied conditions to which I have thus briefly alluded, and under 
which plants are found to exist, they have been formed by their Almighty Creator of 
different structures and constitutions, to fit them for the stations they severally hold 
in creation ; and so striking are the results, that every different region of the globe is 
characterized by peculiar forms of vegetation.
A practised botanical eye can with 
certainty, in almost all cases, predict the capabilities of any hitherto unknown coun- 
try, by an inspection of the plants which it produces.
* * But in order to give 
us a clearer idea of the " strong connexions, nice dependencies," existing between cli- 
mate and vegetation, let us survey plants in a state of nature.
We shall find some 
restricted to certain situations, while others have a wide range, or greater powers of 
adaptation.
It is not perhaps going too far to assert, that no two plants are alike in 
this particular, or in other words, that the constitution of every individual plant is dif- 
ferent.
Of the former, Trichomanes speciosum is an example, it not being able to ex- 
ist, even for a short time, in a dry atmosphere : of the latter, familiar examples are 
presented to us in the London Pride and the Auricula ; these of course grow in great- 
er or less luxuriance, as the conditions are more or less favorable.'' â€” p.
6. 
Chap.
II.
â€” On the Causes which interfere with the Growth of 
Plants in large towns.
Among these are more particularly mention- 
ed " deficiency of light, the dryness of the atmosphere, the fuliginous 
matter with which the air of large towns is always more or less load- 
ed, and the evolution of noxious gases from manufactories." The 
author expresses his belief that the generally depressed state of ve- 
getation in large towns, is chiefly due to the quantity of soot floating 
in the atmosphere ; and that although deficiency of light and mois- 
ture certainly exerts an influence to a certain extent, yet that neither 
of these, nor the evolution of noxious gases, nor the three combined, 
is the sole or even the chief enemy to the growth of plants in 
a town atmosphere.
After quoting from Mr. Ellis's paper in the 
224 
'Gardeners' Magazine' for September, 1839, that part which relates 
to the observations and experiments of Drs. Turner and Christison 
on the effects of sulphurous and muriatic gases upon vegetation, the 
author observes : â€” 
" The conrectness of the above ohservations of Messrs.
Turner and Christison, as 
to the effects of sulphurous and muriatic acid gases upon plants, cannot for one mo- 
ment be doubted ; and that plants suffer when exposed to a direct current of these 
gases, before there is time for diffusion through surrounding space, is equally matter 
of fact ; but I contend, that it yet remains to be proved that there exists generally in 
the atmosphere of London, or other large cities, such a proportion of these noxious 
gases as sensibly to afiect vegetation.
We shall find in the windows of shops and 
small houses, in numerous parts of London, hundreds of geraniums and other plants, 
growing veiy well and without any crisping or curling of the leaves, care being taken 
in these instances to keep the plants perfectly clean and free from soot ; and it is certain, 
that although my cases can and do exclude the fuliginous portion of the atmosphere, 
and certainly protect the plants from the effects of any direct current of hurtful airs, 
they cannot exclude that portion which becomes mixed with the atmosphere." â€” p.
17.
The author gives various examples of the rapidity with which gases 
mingle with each other and with the atmosphere, under the influence 
of " a law constantly in action under all circumstances " and in all 
places, by means of which the several constituents of the atmosphere 
are ever preserved in their respective proportions.
Chap.
III.
â€” On the Imitation of the Natural Conditiojis of Plants 
in closely glazed Cases.
At the commencement of this chapter the 
author gives such a pleasant description of the fi-ustration of his early 
attempts to obtain something like country within the smoke of Lon- 
don, and of the occurrence which led to his subsequent success, that 
we must quote the passage entire.
" The science of Botany, in consequence of the perusal of the works of the immor- 
tal Linnaeus, had been my recreation from my youth up ; and the earliest object of 
my ambition was to possess an old wall covered with ferns and mosses.
To obtain 
this end, I built up some rock-work in the yard at the back of my house, and placed 
a perforated pipe at the top, from which water trickled on the plants beneath ; these 
consisted of Polypodium vulgare, Lomaria spicant, Lastrasa dilatata, L.
Filix-mas, 
Athyrium Filix-fcemina, Asplenium Trichomanes, and a few other ferns, and several 
mosses procured from the woods in the neighbourhood of London, together with prim- 
roses, wood-sorrel, &c.
Being, however, surrounded by numerous manufactories and 
enveloped in their smoke, my plants soon began to decline, and ultimately perished, all 
my endeavours to keep them alive proving fruitless.
When the attempt had been given 
up in despair, I was led to reflect a little more deeply upon the subject in consequence 
of a simple incident which occurred in the summer of 1829.
I had buried the chry- 
salis of a Sphinx in some moist mould contained in a wide-mouthed glass bottle, co- 
vered with a lid.
In watching the bottle from day to day, I observed that the mois- 
ture which during the heat of the day arose from the mould, became condensed on the 
225 
internal surface of the glass, and returned whence it came ; thus keeping the mould 
always in the same degree of humidity.
About a week prior to the final change of the 
insect, a seedling fern and a grass made their appearance on the surface of the 
mould.'' â€” p.
25.
After briefly stating the reflections to which this unexpected event 
gave rise, and having mentioned the conchisions arrived at, the author 
proceeds : â€” 
" Thus, then, all the conditions necessary for the growth of my little plant were 
apparently fulfilled, and it remained only to put it to the test of experiment I pla- 
ced the bottle outside the window of my study â€” a room facing the north, and to my 
great delight the plants continued to grow well.
They turned out to be liastraea Fi- 
lix-mas and Poa annua.
They required no attention, the same circulation of the wa- 
ter continuing ; and here they remained for nearly four years, the Poa once flowering 
and the fern producing three or four fronds annually.
At the end of this time they 
accidentally perished, during my absence from home, in consequence of the rusting of 
the lid, and the admission of rain water." â€” p.
26.
The author next details his experiments on different plants, includ- 
ing Trichomanes speciosum, Hymenophyllum, Jungennanniae, and 
Crocuses both with natural and artificial light ; and describes his 
Tintern-Abbey house, his alpine case, drawing-room case and case 
with spring flowers ; thus exhibiting to his readers the gradual deve- 
lopment of his plans, until he conducts them to his " largest experi- 
mental house." In this house, erected in the scene of his early dis- 
appointments, perhaps on the very site of the rock-work on which 
no attentions could prolong the existence of some of our hardiest na- 
tive plants, we now see not only the " wall covered with ferns and 
mosses," â€” the earliest object of the author's ambition, but a host 
of botanical treasures from all parts of the globe growing side by side 
in the gi'eatest luxuriance and beauty : the ferns especially, both na- 
tive and foreign, appear to be quite at home ; the tender and delicate 
Trichomanes speciosum being one of the most lovely objects in the 
collection, and Osmunda regalis, planted in March last, now has 
its noble fronds crowned with fructification.
The chapter concludes with the following remarks upon " the im- 
portance of reflecting on what we see around us." 
" The simple circumstance which set me to work must have been presented to the 
eyes of horticulturists thousands of times, but has passed unheeded in consequence of 
their disused closed frames being filled with weeds, instead of cucumbers and melons ; 
and 1 am quite ready to confess, that if some groundsel or chickweed had sprung up 
in my bottle instead of the fern, it would have made no impression upon me : and 
again, after my complete success with the ferns, had I possessed the inductive mind of 
a Davy or a Faraday, I ought, in an hour's quiet reflection, to have anticipated the re- 
U 
226 
suits of years.
I sliovikl have concluded that all plants would grow as well as the ferns, 
inasmuch as I possessed the power of modifying the conditions suited to the wants of 
each individual." â€” p.
42.
Chap.
IV.
â€” On the conveyance of Plants and Seeds on Ship-board, 
After some observations on the means formerly employed for the pre- 
servation of plants during long voyages, the author thus proceeds : â€” 
" But by far the greater number of plants require to be kept growing during the 
voyage ; and, prior to the introduction of the glazed cases, a large majority of these 
plants perished from the variations of temperature to which they were subjected, â€” from 
being too much or too little watered, â€” from the spray of the sea, â€” or, when protected 
from this spray, from the exclusion of light." â€” p.
46.
The author's reflections on these causes of failure induced him, in 
June, 1833, to send out to Sydney two experimental cases filled vdth 
ferns and grasses, nearly the whole of which amved there " alive and 
flourishing :" â€” 
" The cases were refilled at Sydney in the month of February, 1834, the thermome- 
ter then being between 90Â» and 100*'.
In their passage to England they encountered 
very varying temperatures.
The thermometer fell to 20Â® in rounding Cape Horn, and 
the decks were covered a foot deep with snow.
At Rio Janeiro the thennometer rose 
to lOOÂ®, and in crossing the line to 1200.
In the month of November, eight months 
after their departure, they arrived in the British Channel, the thermometer then being 
as low as 40".
These plants were placed upon the deck during the whole voyage and 
were not once watered, yet on their arrival at the docks they were in the most healthy 
and vigorous condition." â€” p.
46.
Subsequent experiments with plants of a higher order were equally 
successful ; and the following extract of a letter to the author from Mr.
George Loddiges, is confirmatory of the importance of the plan.
" My brother and I have, since 1835, made trial of more than 500 cases to and 
from various parts of the globe, with great variety of success ; but have uniformly 
found, wherever your own directions were strictly attended to, â€” that is, when the cases 
were kept the whole voyage in full exposure to the light, upon deck, and care taken to 
repair the glass immediately in cases of accident, â€” that the plants have arrived in good 
condition.
* * Some of the cases have been opened in fine order after voyages 
of upwards of eight months : in short, nothing more appears to be wanting to ensure 
success in the importation of plants, than to place them in these boxes properly mois- 
tened, and to allow them the full benefit of light during the voyage.'' â€” p.
86.
Full instructions are given for the construction of the cases and the 
preparation of the plants for the voyage.
Chap.
V. â€” On the application of the closed plan in improving the 
condition of the Poor.
" Among the numerous useful applications of the glazed cases, there is one which 
227 
1 believe to be of paramount importance, and well deserving the attention of every 
philanthropist : I mean its application to the relief of the physical and moral wants 
of densely crowded populations in large cities.
Among the members of this popula- 
tion there are numbers, who, either from early associations, or from that love of Nature 
which exists to a greater or less degree in the bosom of all, are passionately fond of 
flowers, and endeavour to gratify their taste at no small toil." â€” p.
57.
After some observations on the importance of the free admission of 
light into human habitations, and on its influence upon the animal 
economy as well as upon vegetation, the author shows in what man- 
ner the innate love of Nature above alluded to may be gratified at a 
trifling expense.
He however cautions the poorer classes " against 
indulging a taste for what are called fancy flowers â€” things which this 
year are rewarded with gold medals, and the next are thrown upon 
the dunghill" â€” as being opposed to the legitimate pursuits of horti- 
culture.
The benefical eflects of the study of Botany are next dwelt 
upon; and the interesting anecdote of Parke and the moss concludes 
the chapter.

â€” On the prohahle future application of the preceding 
facts.
The Wardian cases evidently fimiish great facilities for ex- 
perimenting on numerous doubtful matters connected with Botany, 
Horticulture and Agriculture, such as the effects of different soils and 
manures ; the power of the roots in the offices of absorption and se- 
lection ; the determination of the existence and nature of excretions 
from the roots, whether poisonous or otherwise ; " the effects of poi- 
sons upon plants ; " " the influence of light in protecting plants from 
the effects of low temperature ; " various points respecting the deve- 
lojiment and growth of Fungi, and the other lower orders of vegeta- 
tion; and the investigation of " that debatable ground on the confines 
of the animal and vegetable kingdoms, where in our present state of 
ignorance it is often impossible to determine the point at which one 
ends and the other begins ; " â€” these are but a few of the quanstiones 
vexatce in the settlement of which the glazed cases may be used with 
great advantage.
The author next adverts to the application of the principle on a 
large scale as "a remedial means of the highest order" in the treat- 
ment of numerous diseases which would readily yield " to the reno- 
vating influence of pure air," although without this auxiliary the skill 
of the medical man may be of little avail.
He more particularly men- 
tions measles and consumption as diseases in which a supply of pure 
air and a properly regulated atmosphere are of the greatest impor- 
tance ; and after s])caking of the direct mortality arising from measles 
228 
in crowded districts of large towns, as well as the numbers of persons 
who die of diseases superinduced by neglect during the measles, he 
thus concludes : â€” 
" With respect to consumption, could we have such a place of refuge as I believe 
one of these closed houses would prove to be, we should then be no longer under the 
painful necessity of sending a beloved relative to a distant land for the remote chance 
of recovery, or too probably to realize the painful description of Blackwood : â€” " Far 
away from home, with strangers around him, â€” a language he does not understand, â€” 
doctors in whom he has no confidence, â€” scenery he is too ill to admire, â€” religious com- 
forters in whom he has no faith, â€” with a deep and every day more vivid recollection of 
domestic scenes, â€” heart-broken, â€” ^home-sick, â€” friendless and uncared for, â€” he dies," 
-p.

The interest we feel in the subject and our conviction of its impor- 
tance, have perhaps led us to extend our notice of Mr. Ward's useful 
book somewhat beyond our prescribed limits ; we however feel assur- 
ed that we shall be readily excused for this by such of our readers as 
have used the Wardian cases, whether on the same humble scale as 
ourselves, or in the more superb style of Mr. Ward's own large fern- 
ery.
In conclusion, we would advise all whose love of Nature is not 
to be suppressed by the din and smoke of large towns, immediately to 
set to work, and we can venture to promise that the trifling trouble 
and expense they may be at, will be amply repaid by the gratification 
and the instruction they will derive from their observations ' On the 
growth of plants in closely glazed cases.'

Parts 4â€”9.
The illustrations increase in beauty and the descriptions in interest 
as the work proceeds.
The details of the inflorescence are drawn, 
engraved and printed in masterly style : the catkins of the goat wil- 
low at p.
168, of the aspen at p.
188, and of the alder at p.
221, are 
extremely pretty.
Some of the vignettes also merit the highest 
praise : the artist's "bit" at p.
193, with its cool and quiet shade, is 
" beautifiil exceedingly," and so is the peep into a wood at p.
237.
The portraits of the trees themselves still somewhat dissatisfy us : not- 
withstanding the skill and labour bestowed on them, the result is far from 
satisfactory.
We are ever ready to exclaim, " What a beautiful tree !
" 
but we always refer to the accompanying letter-press to learn its name.
It would appear to be a task of infinite difficulty to portray a tree so 
229 
exactly that its figure shall convey to the beholder a warrant of its 
identity.
A familiar bird or insect is recognized at sight ; but who 
shall select an oak, an ash, or an aspen fiom among the most faithful- 
ly drawn group of forestry ?
The fault is perhaps in the subject, not 
in the manner of execution.
How many are there who, seeing the 
trees themselves tossing their sinewy branches in the breeze, would be 
unable to refer each to its particular species ; how difiicult therefore 
must it be for the pencil to seize on characters which the experienced 
eye shall often fail to detect !
The work, in fine, must rest its claim 
to public patronage on the correctness of its details and the complete- 
ness of its descriptions, rather than on any striking likeness in the 
portraits of the trees themselves.
The author's remarks on the comparative value of timber are highly 
interesting and valuable.
The Black Italian or Necklace Poplar {Po- 
pulus monilifera) is the subject of high encomium.
"The wood is 
of a greyish white colour, tough when seasoned, and if kept dry very 
durable ; its great size renders it fit for the largest buildings, and as 
flooring for manufactories and other erections nothing can surpass it, 
as in addition to the property of not splitting by percussion, it pos- 
sesses the peculiar advantage of not easily taking fire, and even when 
ignited burning without flame or violence." â€” p.
201.
The last-named 
quality is an excellence of more than ordinary importance : what an 
amount of humem life and property might be saved by the use of tim- 
ber which would thus arrest or even retard the awful power of flame !
Speaking of the beech Mr. Selby tells us that when this noble tree 
is grown singly or in hedgerows it is, " from its dense and widely-ex- 
tended shade, and the deleterious nature of its drip, more injurious to 
the herbage beneath than any other tree : and here we may also re- 
mark, that one of the greatest disadvantages attending Beechen woods 
or groves, is that no underwood or herbage, with the exception of 
some Orchideous and Cryptogamic plants, will thrive beneath their 
shade : even the hardy holly, a plant that flourishes and bears, com- 
paratively unhurt, the drip and shade of many other trees, pines and 
languishes under the Beech ; laurels and other evergreens, as well as 
deciduous shrubs, all speedily die when planted beneath its shade." 
â€” p.
312.
Does not our author here lay too much stress on the drip 
of the beech ?
We should hesitate before attributing this deleterious 
effect to any other cause than the exclusion of light, for we have often 
seen young beech contending for the mastery with a vigorous under- 
growth of holly and wych elms ; and although the beeches have out- 
stripped their fellows, which much consequently receive their drip.
230 
yet all are growing together in the most perfect amity and vigour.
" For narrow upright hedges, to divide or enclose nursery grounds, 
gardens, or even small fields, the beech is superior to the hornbeam, 
or any other deciduous tree, as it not only bears the shears equally 
well, and may be trained to as great a height, but retains the leaves 
during winter, thus affording additional shelter and warmth, and giv- 
ing a richness of appearance the others do not possess." â€” p.
315.
It is perhaps generally known that the Spanish chesnut, although 
here only occasionally eaten by the lower classes, forms in Italy and 
Spain a most important article of their food, serving in great measure 
as a substitute for bread or potatoes.
The nuts are variously prepar- 
ed, sometimes simply boiled or roasted, at others ground to flour ; " of 
this flour, la Galette, a thickish kind of girdle cake, mixed up with a 
little milk and salt, and sometimes with the addition of eggs and but- 
ter, is made ; la polenta is also another preparation made by boiling 
the chesnut flour in milk till it becomes quite thick ; when made with 
water, it is eaten with milk in the same manner as oatmeal porridge 
in the north of England and Scotland.
Chatigna, that is, chesnuts 
boiled and then mashed up as we do potatoes, is also another prepa- 
ration common in France and Italy." â€” p.
329.
Of the Pine Mr. Selby gives a very complete and valuable history, 
detailing the botanical characters of the family to which it belongs, 
the peculiarity of its wood differing from that of dicotyledonous trees, 
the geographical distribution, the requisite soil, and various other par- 
ticulars.
With the following pleasantly written account of the fructi- 
fication of the common pine we must conclude.
" The male flowers or catkins, when in bloom, are from half an inch to upwards of 
an inch long, and are placed in whorls at the base of the young shoots of the current 
year; the flowers contain two or more stamens with large yellow anthers, which dis- 
charge a sulphur-coloured pollen in great abundance.
The embryo cones or female 
flowers appear on the summits of the shoots of the year, in number from two to as ma- 
ny as six, and of a green or purplish green colour.
When impregnated, they become 
lateral and reflexed, and cease to increase in size till the following spring, when they 
again begin to swell, and by July attain their full size, ripening by degrees into ovate, 
pointed and tessellated, hard, woody cones, from one inch and a half to two inches 
long.
These remain on the tree for a considerable time afterwards, though the seeds 
are discharged the following spring, and it is then that trees are frequently seen with 
cones in four difi"erent stages : viz., in the youngest or embryo state ; in an unripe or 
green condition, but of full size; in a matured state, or when they have become brown; 
and lastly with the scales expanded, after the seed has been shed.'' â€” p.

Enquiry respecting the Parasite on the Goldfish, (Pliytol.
190).
In the last 
No. of ' The Phytologist' there is a notice of a paper read by Mr. Goodsir on the 1 1th 
of January last, at a meeting of the Botanical Society of Edinburgh, on a vegetable 
found on the gills and fins of a goldfish.
Although Mr. Goodsir " gave a minute de- 
scription of the parasite, explaining practically its form, structure, mode of fructifica- 
tion, &c." you have not even favoured your readers with the name of the vegetable, or 
given the slightest account of it.
This I very much regret, as a friend of mine a few 
weeks since sent me a small carp, which he had kept in a pond, and which, it would 
appear, died from the same disease as that mentioned by Mr. Goodsir.
We examined 
this fish, and found it covered with a minute vegetable substance, which we supposed 
to be a Conferva.
Around the operculum it was very thick, and apparently obstruct- 
ed the opening of this valve ; the gills too were very much ulcerated and almost unit- 
ed into one mass by the parasitic covering.
The internal organs were also inflamed, 
and near the heart we found a transparent mass, filled with a fluid, and which we con- 
ceived to be a hydatid.

Turner; 47, Lower Stamford St., Blackfriars Road, 
April, 1842.
[Our notice of Mr. Goodsir's paper was given verbatim from the report published 
in the Edinburgh Evening Post.
We cannot learn that the parasite has yet received 
a name, and the only description we can meet with we have given below ; it is from a 
report in Taylor's 'Annals ' of the February meeting of the Royal Society of Edinburgh.
Mr. John Quekett has obligingly furnished us with a notice of a very interesting fact 
observed by him in connexion with this parasite, which we have great pleasure in in- 
serting.

Description of the Vegetable parasitic on the Goldfish.
" The concluding 
part of Dr. J.
H. Bennet's paper on Parasitic Fungi growing on living animals was 
read, and as portions of it bear dii'ectly on Natural History, we shall briefly allude to 
these.
Fungi of this description have previously been noted as occuning in the stic- 
kleback and common carp, but we are not aware that any particular description has 
yet been supplied of these fungi.
Dr. Bennet had an opportunity of examining them 
upon the gold carp, Cyprinus auratus, having been persistent before death.
To the 
eye they presented the appearance of a white cottony or flocculent matter attached to 
the animal.
Under the microscope it presented two distinct structures, which were 
severally cellular and non-cellular.
The former consisted of long tubes divided into 
elongated cells by distinct partitions.
At the proximal end of several of these cells 
was a transparent vesicle about "01 of a millimetre in diameter, which the author con- 
sidered to be a nucleus.
Some of the cells were filled with a granular matter ; others 
however were empty, the granules having escaped through a rupture of the tube or of 
the cellular walls.
Besides these there were long filaments about "OG of a millimetre 
in diameter, which apparently sprung from the sides of the cellular tubes.
They were 
uniform in size throughout their whole length, and were formed of an external deli- 
cate diaphanous sheath, and an internal more solid transparent matter.
This vegeta- 
ble structure sprung from a finely granular amorphous mass.
Fungi of a similar kind 
were also found in the lungs of a man who died of pulmonary consumption, and from 
whose lungs they were also copiously discharged in the expectoration during life.
The 
vegetable structure in this instance consisted of tubes, jointed at regular intervals, and 
232 
giving off branches generally dichotomous.
They varied in diameter from '01 to '02 
of a millimetre, and appeared to spring without any root from an amorphous, soft, 
finely gmnular mass.
They gave off at their extremities numerous oval, round or ob- 
long corpuscules, arranged in bead-like rows, which were considered reproductive spo- 
rules.
The same appearances were found in the soft cheesy matter lining some of the 
tubercular cavities after death." â€” From the 'â– Annals and Magazine of Natural Histo- 
ry,' March, 1842,;).

Note upon the Fungus parasitical on fishes.
Having seen that Mr. Goodsir of 
Edinburgh has described the parasite which infests the bodies of gold carp and other 
fishes, I imagined that the following incident concerning it might not prove uninte- 
resting to your readers.
About a month since I placed six newts in a tank of water in 
which there were some aquatic plants, and three small fish commonly called stickle- 
backs.
One of these, the largest of the three, had the hinder part of its body covered 
with the plant.
The newts had not long been in the tank, when my brother, Mr. Ed- 
win Quekett, and myself, saw one of them in the act of nibbling away at the parasite, 
whilst the fish remained perfectly quiet : on disturbing them the same thing was re- 
peated by another newt ; the fish appeared much pleased, and even moved its tail fre- 
quently towards the newt, as though it were anxious to get rid of the parasitic growth.
Whether the act of the newt were dictated by kindness I cannot say ; probably these 
animals perforai (as tench are said to do) the office of physicians to the diseased por- 
tion of the finny race.

Note on the Oxlips from Bardfield, Sfc. The oxlips kindly sent to me by Mr. H.
Doubleday from Bardfield (Phytol.
204), and concerning which you enquire, appear to 
me to be the species intended by the figure in ' English Botany ' (513), and also to be 
identical with Swiss and German specimens in my herbarium, which were sent to me 
under the name of " Primula elatior, Jacq." The Bardfield specimens differ slightly 
from the figure in ' English Botany,' but not importantly, except in having the calyx 
decidedly shorter than the tube of the corolla.
They are unlike any other English 
oxlips in my herbarium (all of which may be gradually traced either to the primrose 
or to the cowslip, by intermediate links), and, as appears to me, they may be safely 
pronounced the real representatives of Primula elatior.
The dubious oxlip, gathered 
last year at Claygate, and mentioned in your first number (Phytol.
9), has this 
year flowered in my garden.
It there grows in a much drier and a less shaded situ- 
ation than that in which the wild root was found.
In the form of the calyx, corolla, 
and leaf, it is now decidedly a primrose, although the umbel is elongated on a stout 
scape of five inches in height.
In the deep colour of the corolla and the tint of the 
leaves, it has more nearly the cowslip hues : the pubescence is intermediate, but nearer 
that of the primrose.
I consider the plant to be an umbelled primrose, but cannot 
account for the cowslip colours.
Preparations for a botanical tour to the Azores (for 
which I expect to sail in two or three days) have prevented my giving attention to the 
subject of the oxlips this spring ; and sundry experiments bearing upon the question 
of their relations to the cowslips and primroses that had been commenced will be inter- 
fered with by my absence, which I anticipate will continue for the whole summer and 
autumn.
As far as my observations go, there is not any one point in the specific 
characters ordinarily given for the primrose and cowslip, which is constant in either.
Each characteristic of the primrose may be seen in specimens that otherwise would be 
called cowslips, and vice versL The least variable, perhaps, are the very short and 
close pubescence of the cowslip, and the long weak hairs of the primrose.
I have 
233 
never seen the primrose with obtuse sepals, however, though the cowslip has the sepals 
acute, obtuse, or quite rounded at the apex.
The experiments on which Professor 
Henslow lays so much stress, are certainly of great value in relation to the distinctions 
of species, not merely in the genus Primula, but for systematic Botany generally.
Still, 
they may be said to require confinnation ; and one confirmation which appears to be 
requisite, is, that the experiment should be repeated by some botanist who would stu- 
diously avoid letting his gardener or any other party know the object of his experi- 
ment.
I was once told by a gardener, that he had helped his master's horticultural 
experiments, during the absence of tlie latter, so as to produce the results which he 
supposed would gratify his master.

On the immersion of Specimens of Plants in Boiling Water, (Phytol.
189).
Having been induced from a report in ' The Phytologist ' to try the effect of boiling- 
water in preserving the colours of botanical specimens, I was much disappointed to 
find that it was, with me, quite ineff'ectual.
Lathraea squamaria, one of the plants 
mentioned in the report, turned completely black on remaining in boiling water ten 
seconds ; and in one specimen which was but partially immersed, that part only turned 
black, whilst the remainder has preserved its colour in a slight degree.
By the same 
treatment the colour was extracted from the flowers of Orchis mascula, leaving the 
petals of a dirty brown hue ; whilst specimens dried by the usual method partially re- 
tained their colour, and certainly their form, which the boiled ones did not.
Speci- 
mens of other plants which I tried were all acted upon in a similar manner.
It cer- 
tainly appears very strange to me that others should succeed so perfectly, whilst T, using 
exactly the means prescribed, could not succeed in the least; and I think there must 
be something more than has yet appeared, either in the water or the subsequent treat- 
ment, in order to preserve the colour of such plants as Lathreea squamaria &c.

True office of the Earth in relation to Plants.
As the article ' On the true of- 
fice of the earth in relation to plants ' (Phytol.
173), seems to have been penned for the 
purpose of exciting discussion, I am surprized that you have as yet luid no communi- 
cations on the subject.
I take the liberty of sending you a few remarks, as I cannot 
subscribe to the opinion which, in that article, Mr. Newman has endeavoured to main- 
tain.
The feeding of plants in order that they may afford food for man, is an impor- 
tant subject at this time; and if I understand Mr. Newman rightly, he maintains that 
the earth or soil in which they grow has nothing to do with the supplying this food.
He makes this inference from the fact that hyacinths grow in water ; and to this in- 
stance he might have added those of floating water-plants, of most of the Orchideae, 
and a number of mosses, lichens, 'Sec, which evidently derive their nutriment from 
sources independent of those constituents of the earth or soil in which they do not grow.
But this does not at all prove Mr. Newman's position, that those plants which grow in 
the earth do not derive their sustenance from the soil in which they are placed.
The 
fact is that plants, like animals, require different kinds of food, and they are always 
naturally placed in those positions in which they ai'e best supplied with their peculiar 
food.
All plants, it may perhaps be stated, require for their growth water and carbo- 
nic acid, and they obtain these from the soil or the atmosphere, according to their 
structure, which is adapted to the peculiar localities in which they live.
The plants 
of the deep sea, and most of the lower forms of Cryptogamia, obtain these agents by 
their whole surface ; but in the higher forms of Phanerogamous vegetation, the func- 
tion of absorption is exceedingly localized, and these plants seem to be almost cou- 
X 
234 
fined to the extremities of tbeir roots â€” the spongioles, as a means of obtaining food.
These spongioles are placed in the soil, and from the soil, and from no other source, 
do they derive their water and carbonic acid.
It is this that makes carbonaceous soils 
so valuable when any agent is added to them that will facilitate the union of their 
carbon with oxygen, and thus supply to plants an abundance of carbonic acid.
On 
the necessity of water as a food for plants I need not dwell ; and that this alone enters 
plants from the soil is proved by the flourishing vegetation of a swamp during a drought, 
compared with the withered aspect of the same on hills and well-drained fields.
But 
water and carbonic acid are by no means the only food of plants; there are other mat- 
ters which they derive from the soil, and which they cannot get from any other source.
The various saline and earthy constituents of plants are derived from the soil ; and 
unless these are supplied the plant perishes.
The nature and proportion of these vary 
very considerably in dilFerent families, but in most cases they are essential, if not to the 
existence, at least to the health and productiveness of the plant.
Of these substances 
the phosphates, nitrates and carbonates of lime, potassa and soda, silica and ammonia, 
may be given as examples.
It is a knowledge of this fact that is now giving such an 
impetus to the enquiry concerning the manuring of plants, and which, far from lead- 
ing to the conclusion that the composition of the soil is of little importance, attaches 
to it the utmost value.
For this purpose the vegetable physiologist has called in the 
aid of the chemist ; and Dr. Daubeny, at a late meeting of the Agricultural Society, 
presented a plan for keeping a debtor and creditor account between the soil and plants 
that grew on it, seeing that the latter took away that which the former possessed.
It 
is a knowledge of this fact that gives the true theory of the rotation of crops, the ne- 
cessity for which does not arise from the excretions of a plant being poisonous to itself 
and not to another, but from the fact that plants abstract from the soil the whole of an 
ingredient that, as food, is necessary for their health ; this is not supplied till after the 
next manuring.
That the earth supplies ingredients necessary to the existence of 
plants, is also proved by their distribution on the surface of the globe, independent of 
height, of heat and light, which are so important; some plants grow on one stratum 
and some on another ; and many plants are known to geologists as determining the 
existence of particular rocks, whose particles are mingled with the soil.
I cannot 
therefore admit that the earth is " simply a receptacle for roots,'' for the very constitu- 
ents of which the earth is composed, are constantly undergoing decomposition and en- 
tering into the structure of the plant ; and had not the earth naturally or by artificial 
means a peculiar constitution, the plants which grow on it could not exist.

Note on Sagina apetala and maritima.
In the numerous examples of Sagina 
apetala which I have witnessed, I have never failed to detect rudimentary petals, (see 
' British Flora ').
This obtains also in the maritime variety found in Anglesea, near 
Beaumaris.
S. maritima is strictly apetalous.
The latter species I have never seen 
growing at WaiTington : the nearest habitat known to me is Runcorn Gap, on the 
Mersey.

Carex tenella, (Phytol.
128).
A word on this subject.
I have no doubt that 
the figure of Schkuhr has been seen by the author of ' British Flora,' and I think there 
is good evidence of its having been consulted at the very time when that part of the 
' British Flora ' was written.
The mistake, if any has been made, may even have been 
caused by relying too implicitly on Schkuhr's figure of the ripe fruit.
This, in Sir J.
E. Smith's opinion, has been taken " from a starved specimen of C.
loliacea,''^ which 
235 
lias " huit Jlat on one side" (' Eng. Flor.' 83), Mr. Gibson appears to have miscon- 
ceived the meaning of the question which he so freely criticises ; the doubt evidently 
refers to the Scottish specimen, and not to the species called C.
tenella.

Isoetes lacustris.
Had I known of Mr. Newman's intention to describe the 
fructification, I would have sent my own recorded observations earlier.
In some of 
the fertile capsules, only one central columnar bar from back to front was visible, but 
in other cases, and especially in those which seemed to contain male organs, there were 
ten such bars, ranged on each side of the thickened central line which runs down the 
back.
No good evidence appeared that these bars were receptacles for the seeds.
On 
the inner side of the frond, immediately above the capsule, a rounded membranous 
scale is observable, having a depression at its base.
It has an evident communication 
with the capsule.
In one instance two scales were seen, one placed above the other.
The so-called anthers were alike furnished with scales.
In the " normal form '' from 
Llyn y Cwn, I observed that the seeds were much more numerous and smoother than 
in the slender variety from Ffynnon Freeh, the capsules were also larger, with twelve 
bai-s or pillars from back to front.
In the capsule of the slender variety the seeds were 
from thirty to forty in number, with winged sutures; not the least trace of any pedicel 
could be found.
The above remarks seemed to me less likely to be accurate than those 
of Mr. Valentine, which, founded as they are on subsequent observation and most di- 
ligent scrutiny, must be regarded as worthy of the highest credit.
One conclusion 
drawn by him was, that no essential difference existed between the fertile and the so- 
called male fructification.

Myrica Gale with androgjfnous floivers.
I enclose a few specimens of Myrica 
Gale with androgynous jiowers, that is, with the flowers united in the same glume, not 
simply monoecious.
In the same catkin you will find the lower portion principally oc- 
cupied with barren flowers, the upper portion with fertile flowers, and the intermediate 
portion with the flowers united.
The whole bush, whence the specimens were obtain- 
ed, had catkins of this character ; it still grows on the borders of Risley Moss, near 
this place, and can easily be found again.

Notes on Monotropa.
It may not be amiss to make a few more observations 
on Monotropa.
The description of the root of M.
Hypopitys in ' English Botany,' t.
68, is applicable enough to Mr. Lees' plant, but not to that which grows at Southport, 
and which seems also to differ from the true M.
Hypopitys in its drooping flowers.
With respect to the scent of the true species, it would seem, according to Smith's ob- 
servation, that it becomes evident only when the plant has " arrived at maturity, and 
then acquiring a fragrant smell, generally compared to primrose roots, but rather re- 
sembling those flowers.'' My Southport specimens, therefore, though they should not 
prove to belong to a distinct species, are not necessarily opposed to Mr. Lees' percep- 
tions, for they were gathered early in the season.
Perhaps I have eiTcd in not sooner 
replying to Mr. Lees' observations, (Phytol.
171).
My silence has been entirely ow- 
ing to an aversion from anything which has a tendency to defeat the object for which 
' The Phytologist ' is intended, as a vehicle of information.
The perfect good humour 
with which Mr. Lees has received my former comments, assures me that I have given 
no ofl'ence, and surely none was intended.
No one can be more sensible than myself 
of the great pains he must have taken in the disinterment of the roots of Monotropa ; 
T only intended to say that closer investigation is requisite to determine the parasitism of 
the plant, than he has yet given to the subject.
As to the scent of his specimens, I have 
as little doubt that I should have agreed with him, as I have of the accuracy of my 
236 
own perceptions with respect to the Southport plant.
All my remarks were written 
purely with a wish to excite enquiry into facts not yet fully established by evidence.
My friend Dr. J.
B. Wood last year directed my attention to some very singular re- 
marks on this plant by Monsieur Jaume St. Hilaire, in the ' Plantes de la France,' iii.
{] 809).
At that period he says the plant was so little understood, that it was difficult 
to ascertain " whether it was a distinct species or a monstrosity of another plant," (si 
c'est une espece distinct, ou une monstruosite d'une autre plante) ; and that it was al- 
ways found "adhering and parasitical upon the roots of elms &c., but never [after- 
wards] in the same spot." So that here we have a plant at once migratory and para- 
sitical, properties which would be very astonishing, thus united, in any but a plant of 
such mysterious origin.

Note on the second Bniish species of Monotropa.
The smooth-petalled form 
of Monotropa Hypopitys noticed by Mr. Gibson (Phytol.
201) will probably be found 
in other localities now that attention is directed to it.
I have a specimen in my pos- 
session from Cholsey, Berks, gathered by Mr. Babei', and distributed by the Botanical 
Society of liOndon in 1839, which differs from a Reigate specimen of the more usual 
form, sent to me by the same Society, and agrees with the characters given by Mr.
Gibson.
The plant or variety has, however, been recognized before by various foreign 
botanists, and appears to be the same as the Hypopitys hypophegea of G.
Don, ' Ge- 
neral System of Gardening,' iii.
866.
Tt is the H.
glabra of DecandoUe (Prodr.
vii.
780), who gives as its habitat the roots of beech-trees in various parts of Germany, and 
suggests that it may be also found in France and England.
A smooth form of Mono- 
tropa Hypopitys is also mentioned by Koch, in his ' Syn. Flor.
Germ, et Helv.' where 
it is considered as being merely a variety, between which aud the hairy form this au- 
thor finds many intermediate states.

Tnfolium incarnatum, (Phytol, 198).
The only localities in which I have met 
with Trifolium incarnatum are Snelsmore and Greenham Commons, near Newbury, 
Berkshire ; where, in 1838, it grew on the turf, not far from the road-side, in many 
parts of the commons, and by an inexperienced botanist, who was not aware of the 
plant's being cultivated in the neighbourhood, would certainly have been supposed to 
be wild ; indeed, I confess, that when I first saw its deep red flowers, I hoped that I 
had found a prize.
It grew in a scattered manner, and was always very starved and 
stunted in its growth.

Potamogeton prtBlongus.
In the ' Northern Flora' by Dr. Alexander Murray, 
of Aberdeen, published in 1836, occur the following remarks respecting this plant.
â€” 
It " is one of the most recent additions to the British Flora.
It is said, however, that 
there are specimens of it in the herbarium of Mr. Brodie of Brodie,* 20 or 30 years 
old ; and it is certain that the writer of these remarks, though then unable to deter- 
mine the name, gathered this species in Cromar, Aberdeenshire, several years before it 
was known to be a native of Britain, and showed the specimen, still in his possession, 
upon the same day, as something remarkable, to his friend Mr. John Anderson, now 
editor of a London daily paper." The readers of ' The Phy tologist ' are of course aware 
that since the time at which these words were written, various localities, both in Eng- 
* Lochlee is on the Brodie property ; but few of the specimens in the Brodie her- 
barium were gathered within the province of Moray.
231 
land and Scotland, have teen -discovered for the interesting plant to which they refer.
But they are not, perhaps, aware by whose means or in what manner it was first made 
known that Potamogeton prselongus had been found in this country.
In the summer 
of 1832, 1 found this plant first in the moss of Litie, and soon afterwards in Lochlee, 
both stations within the county of Nairn.
After examining it over and over, and 
comparing it with the descriptions given in Hooker's ' British Flora,' I could not iden- 
tify it with any species there described.
I at last showed a specimen to my friend, 
Mr. William A.
Stables, of Cawdor Castle, who had not previously seen it, and could 
not name it.
Ever more ready to promote a friend's fame than his own, Mr. Stables 
in 1833, sent some specimens to Dr. Walker Arnott, who pronounced the plant to be 
Potamogeton prselongus (adding several synonymes), and " new to the British Flora." 
It is highly probable that it had been, in several instances, mistaken for another spe- 
cies before the time to which I have alluded, but certainly it was not known by any 
distinct name as a native of Britain until, through the communication of Mr. Stables, 
it was named by Dr. Amott.
I forget whether it was before or after he knew its name 
that Mr. S.
found the plant growing in Lochindorb.
With reference to what I have now 
written, I may just remark, that I have no wish to depreciate the botanical services of 
others in order to extol my own, or to take away from the merit â€” if merit there be â€” 
of the mere discovery of a plant previously unknown.
But I think that those who do 
actually make discoveries, knowing or suspecting them to be so, certainly do very lit- 
tle for the cause of botanical science by neglecting to communicate them.
And in my 
honest opinion my excellent friend already named has, with respect to the plant in 
question, more merit than any who have had a hand in adding it to the British Flora.
The description of P.
praelongus is now so well known, and has been so recently in- 
serted in your pages, (Phytol.
28), that it need not be here repeated.
There is, how- 
ever, one peculiarity in the leaves, which I think has not been quite correctly descril)ed 
by our British botanists.
By some they are said to be " obtuse," by others " hooded " 
at the point ; and by others, I think, they are not, in that particular, described at all.
I would describe them as terminating in what resembles the bow of a boat, and I think 
the " foliis apice navicularibus " of the continental botanists â€” for which expression I 
am also indebted to Mr. Stables â€” forms the best possible description of them.
When 
dried and flattened they are of course split at the point.
The lamented author of ' The 
Northern Flora,' who did live to finish what would have formed the most interesting 
of all our local Floras, assigns, on the authority of Francis Adams, Esq., Surgeon, 
Banchory, the feminine gender to the word Potamogeton.
In an appendix to Dr.
Murray's work, Mr. Adams has furnished ' Notes from the Ancients on certain indige- 
nous species ; ' and among other things remarks â€” " Modern botanists have fallen into 
strange mistakes about the gender of this word.
Thus Sprengel, in his ' History of 
Botany,' makes it masculine ; and Hooker, in his ' Flora Scotica,' makes it neuter 
Now it so happens that the word is unquestionably feminine in Latin, as is proved 
from the following passage in the N.
H. of Pliny: â€” "Potamogeton adversatur et cro- 
codilis : itaque secum habent earn qui venantur.
Castor hanc aliter noverat &c." Dr.
Murray adds in a note, that " general principles, as well as the authority of Pliny, may 
be said to be in favour of Potamogeton being a feminine word." â€” J.

Enquiry respecting Pyrola media.
As it is very important that published lists 
of plants should be correct, and I feel especially desirous that 'The Phytologist' should 
become an authority on this point, allow me, through your medium, to ask Mr. Buck- 
238 
ley if he is quite sure he gathered at Lytham in July last, Pyrola media, which he in- 
cludes in his list of Lytham plants, (Phytol.
165).
I ask this because whilst I gathered 
Pyrola rotundifolia in that locality in July, 1834, and have since received it from the 
same place, I have never seen, nor before heard of, Pyrola media growing there.
Py- 
rola rotundifolia is also abundant at Southport, on the opposite shore of the Ribble, in 
similar situations.

Chrysosplenium alternifolium.
I may mention that Chrysosplenium alterni- 
folium grows along the banks of a narrow rivulet in the immediate neighbourhood of

es, and entirely eclipsing its more humble, and there, less abundant sister â€” Chrysos-

Note on the Oxlips from Bardfield.
I have, by the kindness of Mr. H.
Dou- 
bleday, been furnished with specimens of the oxlip (Primula elatior) from Bardfield, 
(Phytol.
204), which I believe to be quite distinct from the plant usually called by 
that name.
The leaf is very diflferently formed, the tube of the corolla much longer, 
the flowers ahvays drooping, and the general appearance of the plant is altogether dif- 
ferent.

The following communications were read : â€” 
1. On Fumarla pardjlora, as a native of England : by Mr. C.
C. Babington, M.A.
F.L.S., &c., Cambridge.
Mr. Babington, in reference to an opinion formerly express- 
ed by him, that this species was a veiy doubtful native of England, not having then 
seen any specimens agreeing with the true characters of it, now states that he has ob- 
tained satisfactory proofs of its being a native, but that most botanists have been in 
the habit of calling F.
Vaillantii by that name.
He says, however, that the flowers of 
English specimens of F.
Vaillantii are decidedly smaller than those of some which he 
possesses from Montpelier, and that in some white-flowered English specimens of the 
same plant, he perceives traces of an apiculus; â€” also that in French specimens of i^.
parviflora the flowers are of the same size as those of F.
Vaillantii, but the fruit has 
an apiculus.
Mr. Babington then proceeds to give a minute description of the prin- 
cipal characters which distinguish this and other allied species of the genus, and among 
which there has hitherto been much confusion.
2. On the occurrence of Gelidium rostratum, Harv., at Aberdeen : by Mr. George 
Dickie, Lecturer on Botany, Aberdeen.* This remarkable plant, which Mr. Turner 
was disposed to consider, though with some hesitation, as merely a variety of Delesseria.
alata, but which Dr. Arnott and Mrs. Griffiths refer to Gelidium, Mr. Dickie states to 
be abundant at Aberdeen, though it has not hitherto been found in situ.
It occurs on 
the large stems of Laminaria digitata, and appears to be an inhabitant of deep water 
â€” being only found cast up after storms.
Mr. Dickie says, â€” " after comparing nu- 
merous fresh specimens of G.
rostratum and D.
alata, I feel convinced that there is no 
essential diff'erence in the structure and outward fonn of the fiiiit in these plants.
In 
both the ternate granules are tenninal and axillary, and the capsules occupy the same 
position.
The seeds, however, diff"er in form ; those of D.
alata are mostly oval, in the 
other they are spherical." 
3. On some anomalies in form in Scolopendrium vulgare : by Mr. Joseph Dickson.
The fronds exhihited by Mr. Dickson presented every possible variety of shape, from 
lanceolate to reniform, and from entire to lobed or rather digitate.
The more usual 
form is certainly entire and oblongo -lanceolate, and it is difficult to account for the 
freaks of fonn which not unfrequently occur in this species of fern.
After these papers were read Professor Graham exhibited some very beautiful and 
interesting specimens of exotics from his own green-house.

Mr. Edward Doubleday exhibited a Primula found at Bardfield, Essex ; and sta- 
ted that some few years ago his brother, Mr. Henry Doubleday, observed that the ox- 
lips growing near Bardfield, in Essex, were strikingly different from those found in the 
vicinity of Epping, where the oxlip is not common ; and that further observation had 
induced him to believe that the Bardfield plant was a distinct species, an opinion in

which he (Mr. E.
D.) was disposed to concur.
Mr. Doubleday next referred to an ar- 
ticle in the ' Gardeners' Chronicle,' since republished in ' The Phytologist,' (Phytol.
204), and pointed out the resemblance of the Bardfield plant to the one there alluded 
to.
He expressed his opinion veiy decidedly that there were in England three distinct 
species of Primula, known by the names of primrose, cowslip or pagel, and oxlip, but 
that the oxlip commonly so called is nothing more than a hybrid between the prim- 
rose and cowslip.
This hybrid is extensively distributed over the country, especially 
in localities where the primrose and cowslip abound : it constantly exhibits a tendency 
to revert to the primrose by throwing up single flowers of precisely the primrose cha- 
racter, as well as others possessing characters of its other parent the oxlip.
As a natural consequence such a hybrid would reproduce at times both the parent 
species, a fact Mr. Doubleday believes to be fully proved.
The Bardfield plant, which Mr. Doubleday considers the true oxlip, differs from 
the hybrid in the foiTU of the calyx, in its drooping umbel, and in its leaves dying off 
in autumn : he has examined thousands of plants at and near Bardfield, and never 
observed a single instance of a solitary flower being thrown up as in the hybrid.
The 
primrose does not occur for some miles round Bardfield, though the cowslip is abun- 
dant ; therefore hybridization cannot well take place in that locality.
The plant un- 
der cultivation does not change its character.
Should it prove a distinct species Mr.
Doubleday claimed for his brother the credit of first detecting the distinction.

â€” A Monograph of the Genus Disporum.
By David Don, 
Esq., Libr.
L.S., Prof.
Bot. King's Coll.
Lond.
The name of this genus, unaccompanied by a description, first ap- 
peared in Mr. Salisbury's list of Petaloid Monocotyledons, published 
in the first volume of the Horticultural Society's Transactions.
The 
chief characters of the genus were pointed out by Mr. Brown, " and 
among others its binary ovula, which doubtless suggested to Salisbury 
the name of Disporum.'''' No description of the genus appeared until 
the publication of Mr. Don's 'Prodromus Florae Nepalensis,' in 1824, 
where, to Salisbury's single species â€” Disp.
puUum ixais^xvaiedifulvum 
in the Prodromus, as well as in the report of the present paper in the 
* Proceedings of the Linnean Society,' p.
45), two others are added, 
namely, Disp.
Pitsutum * and Disp.
parviflorum.f 
" The characters of the genus consist in its campanulate perianthium, with the se- 
pals produced into a short pouch or spur at the base, in the cells of its ovarium bearing 
two [ascending] ovula, in its baccate pericarpium, and in its umbellate inflorescence.
These distinctions will be found to be common to all the Asiatic species hitherto im- 
properly refeiTed by most botanists to Uvularia.
* * This genus terminates the 
series of the Melanthaceae, forming the transition from that family to the Smilaceae, 
the chain of connexion between them being rendered complete by the intervention of 
a new genus, of which Streptopus lanuginosus is the type." â€” p.
513.
The normal Melanthaceae, principally North American plants, have 
the floral organs " persistent, and the partial decomposition of the tri- 
merous pericarpium is almost universal." From the author's remarks 
on the three groups into which " the Melanthacea appear naturally to 
divide themselves," we extract the following characters.

Melanihece or Veratrea.
Carpels partially concrete ; pericarp capsular ; dehis- 
cence generally septicidal; flowers frequently unisexual ; perianth less coloured, 
persistent ; stamens persistent ; rhizoma fibrous.
British genus, Tojieldia.
2. ColchicecB.
Perianth more highly developed ; sepals with long claws, often com- 
bined into a tube ; styles long ; carpels concrete ; pericarp capsular, dehiscence 
septicidal ; rhizoma bulbous ; floral axis naked, hypogaeous.
British genus, 
Colchicum.
3. Anguillariea.
Floral organs frequently deciduous ; styles short, as in the first 
group ; carpels completely concrete ; pericarp capsular or baccate, dehiscence 
loculicidal ; rhizoma bulbous or fibrous ; axis leafy.
" The genus Colchicum establishes an evident relationship through Stembergia 
and Crocus between MelanthaceBe, Amaryllideas, and Irides.
The present genus 
connects the family with Smilaceae, and Tofieldia as clearly with Juncese, whilst a 
comparison of the stiiicture of Uvularia and Eiythroninm fully makes out their afii- 
nity with Liliacese or Tulipaceae.
* * The class of Monocotyledonous plants 
off'ers a beautiful confirmation of the tioith of the doctrine of the continuity of the se- 
ries of organized beings ; and however much the universal existence of transition or 
osculant genera in this class may perplex the botanist who looks to the technical defi- 
nition of his groups as the highest object of the science, we are not to exclude such 
genera from our researches merely because their presence renders the circumscription 
of our pretended natural orders more difficult, for they ceitainly form the most inte- 
resting part of the study of natural affinities.'' â€” p.
514.
Eight species, natives of Asia, are fully described in this Mono- 
graph ; and the paper is concluded by a description of Reich enbach's 
closely allied genus Kreysigia.
The species â€” Kreys.
multiflora, is a 
native of New Holland, and was discovered by Mr. Allan Cunning- 
ham, who introduced it in 1823 to the Royal Botanic Garden, Kew, 
where it annually flowers and matures its fruit.
It was at first sup- 
posed to be a species of Schelhammera, but on examination was found 
to differ essentially both from that genus and Disporum.
" This genus is essentially distinguished from Schelhammera by its sessile biap- 
pendiculate sepals ; by the stamens proceeding free from the torus, unconnected with 
the sepals ; by the cells of its ovarium bearing only two ovula ; by its somewhat bac- 
cate pericarpium ; and, lastly, by its axillary peduncles, which are furnished with three 
small verticillate bractes.
The presence of appendages, the spreading sepals, free sta- 
mens, strophiolate seeds, minute embryo, axillary inflorescence, and valvular fruit re- 
move it equally from Disporum.'' â€” p.
523.
The attention of the author was drawn to the appendages at the 
base of the sepals, resembling those of Parnassia, by Mr. John Smith 
of Kew ; Mr, Don, as well as Endlicher, at first supposed them to be 
imperfectly developed stamens, but Mr. Brown having pointed out " the 
intimate connexion of these curious appendages with the sepals, and 
the entire absence from them of vascularity," the author here corrects 
the error into which he had previously fallen.

â€” A Monograph of Streptopus, with the Description of a 
new Genus note first separated from it.
By David Don, Esq., Libr.
L.S., Prof.
Bot. King's Coll.
Loud.
" The genus Streptopus was first proposed by the elder Richard in Michaux's ' Flo- 
ra Boreali-Americana,' and was intended to include not only the Uvularia amplexi- 
folia of Linnasus, l)ut two other plants therein d&scribed for the first time, namely, S.
roseus and lanuginosus.
The two last are exclusively confined to North America, 
while the first is coJumon to Europe and America." â€” p.
525.
In Streptopus amplexifolius, which Mr. Don considers as the type 
of the genus, are united the following characters : â€” a six-leaved cam- 
panulate perianth with deciduous sepals, which have " a nectariferous 
furrow at their base ; erect sagittate anthers, with short dilated fila- 
ments ; three separate stigmata;" and a berry-like pericarp with poly- 
spermous cells.
From the genus thus characterized the author has 
found it necessary to remove Strept.
lanuginosus, on which he founds 
a new genus.
The genus Streptopus still comprises three species, â€” 
Str. amplexifolius, roseus, and simplex : the last species is from the 
Himalayas, and was first described by the author in his ' Prodromus 
Floraj Nepalensis.' 
" These plants have all a peculiar habit, cylindrical leafy stems, hroad amplexicaul 
leaves, glaucous beneath, and axillary, solitary, mostly single-flowered peduncles, which 
in amplexifolius are curiously twisted at their middle.
The genus undoubtedly be- 
longs to the Smilacese, and is nearly allied to Convallaria and Smilacina, but is essen- 
tially distinguished from both by its distinct sepals, each furnished with a nectariferous 
furrow, separate stigmas, and polyspermous berry.
With Uvularia it accords in habit, 
and in its solitary, axillary, campanulate flowers ; but its innate anthers, furnished 
with short filaments, baccate pericarpium, and noncarunculate seeds, remove it widely 
from that genus." â€” p.
526.
Of the new genus, Prosartes, the author observes : â€” 
" This very natural genus, as I have already stated, forms the transition from the 
Smilaceae to the Melanthaceae, and possesses several characters in common with Strep- 
topus and Disporum.
From the former genus it is essentially distinguished by its 
much more lengthened filaments, binary pendulous ovula, and terminal umbellate in- 
florescence ; [and it differs from Disporum] in its innate anthers, nearly concrete styles, 
and pendulous seeds." â€” ^p.
53J.
The genus Prosartes includes two species, â€” Pros, lanuginosa, from 
North America, the Streptopus lanuginosus of Michaux; and Pros.
Menziesii, also from North America, named after the late Mr. Men- 
zies, and now first described.
" In the Smithian Herbarium there is a single specimen of this highly interesting 
plant gathered by my venerable friend Mr. Menzies on the north-west coast of Ame- 
rica in the voyage of discovery under Vancouver, to which he was attached in the ca- 
2 Y 
244

From their position in the natural system, and the author's remarks 
on their affinities, it will be evident that the plants described in the 
papers above noticed bear a close relationship to many interesting 
British genera, including Trichonema, Convallaria, Ruscus, Paris, 
Tofieldia, Narthecium, &c.

â€” On some new Brazilian Plants allied to the JVatural Order 
Burmanniacese.
By John Miers, Esq., F.L.S.
Von Martius, in his ' Nova Genera et Species Plantarum Brasi- 
liensium,' gives the characters of the genus Burmannia, and fully 
describes five species, discovered by him in the interior provinces of 
Brazil.
Michaux gave the generic name of Tripterella to two North 
American species, which Mr. Miers appears to consider as not dis- 
tinct from Burmannia.
Seven other species have also been found in 
Africa, India, and New Holland.
Previously to his departure from 
Brazil the author discovered five new plants, closely allied to Bur- 
mannia, but differing from that genus in many important particulars.
These five species, together with another discovered by Mr. Schom- 
burgk in British Guinea, and Nuttall's Apteria setacea, are divided 
into three genera, namely, Dictyostega, containing four species, Cym- 
bocarpa with one, and Apteria, Nuitall, (formerly Stemoptera, Miers) 
with two species.
All these genera and species are fully described in 
the present paper, and their characters minutely illustrated by figures.
The author observes that the Burmanniacese may be divided into 
two groups.
The first will contain the genera Burmannia and Gony- 
anthes, having a trilocular ovarium and central placentation ; the se- 
cond, possessing a unilocular ovarium and parietal placentation, will 
include Dictyostega, Cymbocarpa, Apteria and Gymnosiphon.
If the 
principle be adopted " on which Apostasieae have been separated from 
Orchideae and Xyridese from Restiacese," the two sections must be kept 
distinct, and the author suggests that the second would, in that case, 
form a separate family, under the name of Apteriaceae ; if however the 
difference in the structure of their ovaria be not thought sufficient to 
warrant their separation, they must remain associated as Burmannia- 
aceae, the first section being named Burmannieae, the second Apteriese.
The author mentions Gentianeae as an order presenting many similar 
245 
instances of transition from a unilocular capsule and parietal placen- 
tation to a bilocular fruit and central placentation.
The author next details some very striking points of resemblance 
between these plants and many Orchideae ; particularly in their seeds 
and the structure and texture of the pericarp, as well as in their stem 
and imperfectly developed leaves : and he observes that but for the 
differences in the stamens and stigmata, " it would be difficult to draw 
a line of distinction between the structure of these plants and that of 
Orchideae." 
" Another analogous fact is deserving of notice : on examining the stigma of Dic- 
tyostega after flowering, it will be found to be crowded with bundles of white cottony 
filaments, which may be seen even with a common lens to consist of pollen-tubes issu- 
ing in a body from the cells of the anthers and penetrating the stigma, leaving their 
ends exserted, and clavately terminated by their respective grains, thus displaying in 
a very beautiful manner the singular mode of fecundation so ably illustrated by Mr.
Brown in his admirable paper on that subject, published in the 16th volume of the 
Transactions of this Society.
The pollen also in its texture presents great resemblance 
to that of the Orchideae, its component granules cohering in like manner into a solid 
waxy mass previous to the dehiscence of the anthers.'' â€” p.

â€” Some Account of the Curata, a Grass of the Tribe of 
Bambuseae, of the Culm of which the Indians of Guiana prepare their 
Sarbacans or Blow-pipes.
By Robert H.
Schomburgk, Esq. Com- 
municated by the Secretary.
During his first expedition in Guiana M.
Schomburgk discovered 
the plant from -which the Indians prepare their deadly arrow-poison, 
(Phytol.
47).
This discovery rendered our enterprizing traveller the 
more anxious to identify the plant from which are obtained the reeds 
used in the manufacture of the Indian blowpipes.
Nearly forty years 
had elapsed since Baron Humboldt saw a canoe nearly filled with 
them, and was led to ask the question â€” " What is the Monocotyledo- 
nous plant that furnishes these admirable reeds ?
" and during that 
period botanists had received no fiirther information relative to the 
plant or its place of growth.
" No wonder, therefore," says M.
Schomburgk, " that next to the plant which fur- 
nishes the active principle of the famous Urari or Wurali poison, the discovery of the 
reed by means of which the Indian is enabled to send his poisoned arrow with so much 
precision into his intended victim, should have been a point of the greatest interest to me.
" But in answer to all my questions to the Indians as to the locality from whence 
they procured the reeds that play such an important part in the construction of the 
blowpipe, they merely pointed to the west, and gave me to understand that it was far 
away.
The value which the Indians of Guiana set upon these reeds, and the uncer- 
tainty from whence they came, increased their interest ; and one of my first ques- 
246 
lions on arriving at a settlement of Indians whieli I had not previously visited, was, 
whether they knew from whence were obtained these reeds, so different in structure 
from all known Bambuseas.
I ascertained at last that the Macusis received them from 
the Arecunas, but that they did not grow in the country of that tribe ; on the contrary, 
the Arecunas undertook journeys of several months duration to procure them from an- 
other tribe, who lived still further westward." â€” p.
557.
M. Scliomburgk, in his third expedition, visited the Arecunas, and 
from them he ascertained " that the plant which produced the reeds 
grew in the country of the Giiinau and Maiongcong Indians, near the 
head-waters of the Oronoco." 
" We saw among the Arecunas a large number of these reeds, which they were ma- 
nufacturing into blowpipes.
The reed being so valuable, and so liable to destruction 
if carried openly through the woods, the Indian puts it for protection into the slender 
trunk of a palm (a species of Kunthia ?), which he simply hollows out for the purpose.
Being aware that the tube thus manufactured is in constant demand by the other 
tribes, he does not leave the regions which he inhabits to oflFer his ware for sale, but 
patiently awaits the visits of the Macusi, skilled in manufacturing the Urari poison, 
who brings him that deadly preparation, and exchanges it against these reeds or the 
ready-finished blowpipe.
By this mutual exchange, they are each rendered masters 
of life and death over the feathered game ; for, armed with his blowpipe, the wily 
huntsman gradually steals nearer and nearer to his victim, and launches his weapon of 
death, which seldom fails of its deadly aim, before the unconscious bird is even aware 
of the approaching danger.
" The great object of my last expedition led me to that far west.
We camped on 
the 26th of January near the river Emakuni, at a settlement inhabited by Maiong- 
cong Indians; and the first object which struck me on entering the miserable hut 
which served as a dwelling to the Indians, was a large bundle of these reeds, some of 
which were sixteen feet long ; a circumstance which naturally induced, the inquiry, 
from whence they came.
The houses being built on elevated ground, we had an ex- 
tensive view before us : at the distance of twenty miles we observed a large chain of 
mountains, which trended N.N.E. and S.S.W.
; and among this chain a high moun- 
tain was pointed out to us, which they called Mashiatti, and where we were told that 
these reeds were growing ; but as we were given to understand that we should find 
them likewise at Marawacca, and as Mashiatta was entirely out of our road, we did 
not visit it.
It was consequently only in the middle of February, and after we had 
crossed the river Parima, that my wish of becoming acquainted with that curious plant 
was accomplished.
" The Maiongcong and Guinau Indians, whom the Spaniards call Maquiritares, 
conducted us to that part of Marawacca (a high mountain which terminates in an al- 
most perpendicular wall of sandstone) where the plant grows.
It is a day's journey 
from a Maiongcong settlement on the river Cuyaca, from whence the hospitable and 
good-natured savages showed us the beaten track.
After having ascended Mount 
Marawacca, to about 3500 feet above the Indian village, the traveller follows a small 
mountain -stream, on the banks of which the Curas or Curatas, as the Indians call 
these reeds, grow in dense tufts.
They form generally clusters of from fifty to one 
hundred, which are pushed forth, as in many other species of that tribe, by a strong, 
jointed, subterranean rootstock.
The stem rises straight from the rhizoina, without a 
247 
knot, and of equal thickness, frequently to a height of sixteen feet, where the first dis- 
sepiment stretches across the inside, and the first branchlets are formed.
The articu- 
lations then continue at regular intervals of about fifteen or eighteen inches to a fur- 
ther height of from forty to fifty feet.
The full-grown stem is at the base an inch and 
a half in diameter, or nearly five inches in circumference.
It is of a bright green, per- 
fectly smooth, and hollow inside." â€” p.
657.
The long jointless stem Mr. Schomburglc considers to be the growth 
of a very short period; it is surmounted by a head of numerous verti- 
cillate, slender, leafy, jointed branches, three or four feet long, which 
spring from the nodes of the articulated portion of the stem; the 
whole being terminated by the inflorescence.
" The whole stem is from fifty to sixty feet high ; but the weight of the numerous 
branchlets forces the slender stem to droop, and the upper part describes an arch, which 
adds greatly to its graceful appearance." â€” p.
560.
The Ciurata (its native name) grows in a rich soil and shady situa- 
tion, about 6000 feet above the level of the sea.
It appears to be re- 
stricted in its range to the chain of sandstone mountains extending 
between the second and fourth parallel, and forming the separation 
of waters between the rivers Parima, Merewari, Ventuari, Orinoco and 
Negro : M.
Schomburgk determined only three localities, â€” Mounts 
Mashiatti, Marawacca and Wanaya.
" It is a remarkable circumstance, that the plant which furnishes the chief ingre- 
dient for the preparation of the Urari poison is likewise peculiar to a few mountain- 
ous tracts ; consequently the tribes who inhabit the regions where these plants grow, 
and who are acquainted with the mode of their preparation, acquire a general impor- 
tance." â€” p.
560.
The Indians who inhabit the district where these reeds grow, are 
called Curata-people by the other tribes, a circumstance indicative of 
the rarity of the plant.
The Indians of the Rio Negro and the Ama- 
zon, who have no intercourse with the Curata-people, manufacture 
their blow-pipes out of a slender palm, the stem of which is hollowed 
out, either by being steeped in water for some days, when the internal 
substance is pushed out with a stick, or else the stem is split along 
its length, and the interior is removed by burning; when the inside 
has been polished, the two parts are accurately joined together by an 
indigenous glue, and a wooden mouth-piece is added.
The constant demand for a plant having so limited a range, would 
be likely soon to exhaust the stock, were it not for the numerous 
shoots from a single rootstock and their rapid growth, combined with 
the great care taken of his blowpipe by the Indian.
Carrying it erect 
he winds his way through thickets which would be almost impenetra- 
248 
ble to the unincumbered European, without injuring liis weapon.
It 
is said by Humboldt that " a hunter preserves the same sarbacan dur- 
ing his whole life," and boasts of its precision and lightness as we do 
of the good qualities of our fire-arms.
The young reeds only are used in the manufacture of the blowpipe ; 
these are cut into the proper lengths, turned slowly over a moderate 
coal fire to prevent their warping, exposed to the sun until they have 
acquired a deep yellow colour, and are then encased for protection in 
the trunk of a slender palm.
"This case is called by the Macusi In- 
dians Yurua-Cura-pong." 
Mr. J.
J. Bennett has determined this reed to be a distinct species 
of Arundinaria, near to the Arund.
verticillata of Nees von Esenbeck 
and Kunth ; he has named it Schomhurgkii, and gives the following 
characters.
Arundinaria Sehomhurgkii.
Leaves linear, acuminate, smooth ; mouth of the 
sheaths bristly on each side : spike simple, few-flowered ; spiielets sessile ; hypogynous 
scales lanceolate, acute.

â€” On Cuscuta epilinum and halophyta.
By Charles 
C. Babington, Esq., M.A., F.L.S., F.G.S., &c.
In a paper ' On the Stracture of Cuscuta europaea,' (Linn.
Trans, 
xviii.
213), Mr. Babington confirms the accuracy of Mr. Brown's 
observations, on the existence of scales in the tube of the corolla 
of that species, in opposition to Sir J.
E. Smith's opinion, that its 
flowers are, " in all the British specimens, as well as in Ehrhart's 
German ones, destitute of scales in the throat of the tube," (' English 
Flora,' ii.
25).
Mr. Babington, on examining fresh specimens of Cus- 
cuta europsea from Sompting, in Sussex, gathered in company with 
Mr. Borrer, found the scales lying quite close to the corolla, being 
perfectly transparent and very minute; and these circumstances would 
seem to account for their having been overlooked by Smith and Hook- 
er, as well as by some of the continental botanists.
Mr. Babington 
remarks : â€” 
" They are, indeed, so difficult of detection as not to have been at first noticed by 
Mr. Borrer and myself, even when examining fresh specimens, and it is scarcely pos- 
sible to discover them in flowers that have been dried." â€” p.
213.
Reichenbach, in his * Icones Plantarum,' pi.
v. fig.
690, represents 
" each scale exactly under its corresponding stamen,* yet at p.
62 of 
the same volume he calls the corolla a calyx, and appears to have 
* See our fig.
2, which, with the other figures are copied from the Linn.
Trans.
249 
looked upon the scales as constituting the true corolla, and as alter- 
nating with the stamens : â€” 
" This view is manifestly incorrect, for the scales constitute a complete internal 
whorl, each of them being connected with its neighbour so as to form a short tube, the 
upper edge of which is always free and distinct from the corolla (calyx of Eeich.), and 
the lower parts of the filaments of the stamens may be traced under the cuticle of the 
corolla, descending exactly behind the centre of each scale.
It is perfectly clear, there- 
fore, that the scales cannot represent petals, since the whorl of stamens is invariably 
found within that of petals, but in this plant the stamens are situated further from the 
axis of the flower than the so-called corolla.
" I do not attempt to form any theory concerning these minute organs, but hope 
that some fortunate botanist will soon discover them in such a state of monstrous de- 
velopment as to show what is their real nature.
" That the number of scales is equal to that of the segments of the corolla is proved 
by their structm'e in C.
epithymum, in which plant they are not even divided into two 
lobes, [tig.
3].
There is not, indeed, the slightest trace of a division to be discovered 
with a very high power of the microscope.
I ought to add, that Reichenbach does not 
continue the above theory in his 'Flora Excursoria;' but reverts to the old nomencla- 
ture."â€” 214.
Referring to Reichenbach's figure of the opened flower of Cuscuta 
europaea (Ic. PI.
v. f.
690, B., our fig.
2) Mr. Babington makes the fol- 
lowing obsers^ations, which we particularly recommend to the notice 
of our readers.
" It will be seen that this last differs materially from my fig.
1 .
May not his plant 
be a distinct species characterized by its constantly 4-cleft corolla and palmate sexfid 
scales ?
This genus is well deserving of attention from Biitish botanists, for several 
other species are inown in Germany, Sweden, and France, which most probably exist 
in these islands." â€” p.
215.
Since the publication of the paper from which the above extracts 
are made, Mr. Babington has examined Cuscuta epilinum and halo- 
phyta, and in both these species he has detected the presence of scales.
His observations are contained in the paper the title of which is given 
above.
" In the first of these plants, Cuscuta epilinum, Weihe, we find a ventricose tube 
furnished with a whorl of adpressed bifid scales, each branch of which is usually divi- 
ded in a rather irregular manner into two or three fingerlike points, as I have endea- 
voured roughly to represent in fig.
1 , [our fig.
4] ; the divisions of the corolla terminate 
in acute points, and the stamens have very short filaments and are inserted much higher 
up than the extremity of the scales.
" In Reichenbach's figure of this plant in his ' Icones Plant.' tab.
693, the scales 
are vei^y incorrectly given, each of them being there represented as two minute, sepa- 
rate, roundish bodies, pointing downwards.
Specimens received from him (No. 19 of 
his Fl. Germ, exsic), gathered near Borna, in the neighbourhood of Chemnitz, by M.
250 
Weicker, have however these parts of exactly the form descrihed ahove, and agree in 
all points with the English plant, with the exception of the want of a bractea under 
each bunch of flowers.
It is however possible, from the manner in which this bractea 
is hidden by the flowers in the English plant, that it may also exist in that found in 
Germany, although the employment of its absence as a part of the specific character, 
is strongly opposed to this supposition." â€” p.
563.
The next species, Cuscuta halophyta, has not, we believe, been de- 
tected in this country.
It was recently discovered on the southern 
coast of Norway, growing on succulent saline plants; and was first 
described by Fries, in his * Novitianim Fl. Suec.
Mantissa prima,' p.
8. Fries does not mention the scales ; but Mr. Babington has found 
them in a specimen gathered by Dr. Blytt " on the coast of the Fiord, 
near Christiana," who gave it to Mr. Bowman, from whom Mr. Ba- 
bington received it.
The following illustrations exhibit the corolla of each species laid 
open, in order to show the form of the scales, and their position with 
respect to the stamina ; they are copied from Mr. Babington's figures 
in the two papers under notice : from which source are also derived 
the characters of the four species, and the description of Cuscuta 
epilinum.

â€” On the Reproductive Organs q/" Equisetum.
By Mr. Jo- 
seph Henderson.
Communicated by the Rev. M.
J. Berkeley, M.A.
F.L.S.
The results of Mr. Henderson's observations on the reproductive 
organs of this genus, differ, in some respects, from those arrived at by 
Treviranus, Meyen, Bischoff" and Mohl, by whom, without his being 
aware of the fact at the time he wrote, he has been in part anticipated.
Mr. Henderson well remarks that : â€” 
" There is no part of the structure of Equisetum more curious or more anomalous 
than the organs of reproduction ; and although the position of the order in the natu- 
ral system depends on the nature of these organs, yet this is so far matter of doubt, 
that very eminent botanists do not seem decided as to whether Equisetaceae are to rank 
among Phaenogamic or Cryptogamic plants." â€” p.
567.
Without however entering into this question here, we must content 
ourselves with giving, by way of introduction, a brief description of 
the fructification of the genus, which will render the subsequent ana- 
lysis more clear and satisfactory.
The reproductive organs of Equisetum are borne in terminal cone- 
252 
like catkins, which are composed of a number of angular peltate scales, 
spirally arranged round a central common stalk or axis, to which each 
is attached by a short pedicel.
Seated round the margin of each of 
these scales, on its inner or under surface, are from four to eight ob- 
long membranous cells or thecae, opening inwardly and longitudinally, 
and discharging numerous somewhat globose sporules, to each of 
which are attached, at one point, fom* spiral filaments ; the filaments 
are dilated at the extremity, and they are generally more or less 
studded with small granules.
Hedwig and other observers hare 
described these filaments as stamens, looking upon their dilated ex- 
tremities as the anthers, and supposing the minute granules to be the 
pollen.
The filaments are at first wound spirally round the sporules, 
but when discharged fi:om the theca suddenly unroll themselves, and 
cause the sporules to leap about as if alive.
The curious motions of 
the sporules are owing to the structm'e of the filaments, which are 
excellent hygrometers, being twisted like the awns of Avena fatua or 
animated oat, and many other grasses, and are influenced in the same 
way by the varying degrees of moisture in the atmosphere.
Mr. Henderson's observations were made on Equisetum hyemale; 
and he describes the changes which take place in the various parts of 
the fiructification, from the first appearance of the catkin above the 
terminal sheath of the stem up to the discharge of the mature sporule 
from, the theca.
" When tlie spike or fructification of Equisetum hyemale begins to swell beyond 
the terminal sbeatb, the spores may be observed in a rudimentary state on carefully 
dissecting the theca, the interior of which is at this time divided into cells of extreme 
tenuity, in which the spores originate.
These cells are filled with a viscid, greenish- 
coloured fluid, which, when mixed with a small portion of water and highly magnified, 
will be found to contain innumerable minute granules, possessing spontaneous motion, 
and moving apparently on their axes with considerable rapidity : they are of various 
sizes and of various shapes, the larger generally oblong, the lesser spherical : they are 
all equally active, and being transparent, they communicate a whitish colour to the 
water when viewed with the naked eye.
* * It is extremely difficult at this 
time to detach any of these cells entire, owing to the filmy condition of the walls and 
the viscid nature of their contained fluid : a better opportunity is afibrded of viewing 
their form and arrangement, by macerating the theca in dilute nitric acid, when they 
appear somewhat shrunk and collapsed, and the minute granules are therefore easily 
discernible in the cells and also in the spores : the whole mass is easily forced asunder 
even to the theca, which separates into parts con-esponding with the sides of the outer 
cells."â€” p.
568.
The next stage in the progress of the sporules, namely, their tran- 
sition from the granules with which the cells are at first filled, to the 
253 
aggi-egation of these granules in the centre of the cell, is partially sup- 
plied in a passage from Mohl, given as a foot-note at p.
567, from 
which we make the following extract.
" The young capsules (of Equisetum variegatum) are filled \vith a very delicate, 
polyhedral, cellular tissue.
These cells are connected together in greater or lesser 
masses, without, however, being surrounded by mother-cells (if they are not rather 
themselves to be so regarded), and are filled with a granular mass.
In older capsules 
these cells are larger and distinct from each other, and the green granular contents 
fonn for the most part a disc lying in the middle of the cell.
In still more advanced 
capsules this green disc is changed into an oval grain, wrapped round with the two 
elaters.
* * â€” Flora, 1833, pp.
45, 46." 
The spores are at first oval or ovate in shape, but they soon be- 
come globular, which form they afterwards retain : on the contrary 
the cells, which previously had an angular form from mutual pressure, 
" gradually acquire substance, separate from each other, and, chan- 
ging their form, become first globular, and afterwards oval integuments 
of the spores; the spaces caused by their separation being filled 
up with a dark green viscid fluid containing abundance of minute 
granules." 
*' The next change which the integument undergoes is in the development of the 
spiral sutures, by which it is divided into two narrow bands with broad and rounded 
ends: at first the dividing lines are indistinctly seen traversing the iutegiiment; after 
a time they become more distinct, and their spiral direction becomes evident.
Two 
lines of separation run in a spiral direction round the integument, and meet in a sinu- 
ous transverse suture at each end : these lines cut the integument into two equal parts, 
the ends of which are dilated and uniform ; and these are the clavate ends of the fila- 
ments which have been considered by Hedwig and others as forming part of a sexual 
apparatus.
The separation of the integument into parts takes place immediately after 
the edges of the sutures have arrived at their proper thickness ; it is therefore very dif- 
ficult after this to find the integument entire.
" The spore at this time contains a greenish-coloured fluid mixed with some mi- 
nute granules ; soon after it changes to a deeper green colour, its contents become 
thicker, less soluble in water, and filled with a greater number of granules ; the fluid 
which had previously filled the integument and the rest of the thcca is gradually ab- 
sorbed, leaving the granules which it contained sticking in masses to the spores and to 
the separated portions of the integument.
It is these masses of granules, when found 
adhering to the filaments in the ripened state of the spore, that have been mistaken 
for pollen-grains : when removed by means of water, they are found to consist exclu- 
sively of the lesser granules, the larger ones having now altogether disappeared.
As 
the spore swells, the divisions of the integument are forced asunder ; a portion at each 
end however generally adheres longer ; and although further separated, these divisions 
are still held in their spiral position until the ripening of the spore, when, being eject- 
ed from the theca, they recoil with a jerk, and immediately twist into narrow clavate 
filaments, the state in which they have been most frequently observed.'' â€” p.
569.
254 
When the spore is ripe it has a wrinkled appearance ; on the addi- 
tion of water its size is considerably enlarged and the wrinkles disap- 
pear.
A curious effect is produced on tincture of iodine being added 
to the water ; the nucleus of the spore " is contracted to a much 
smaller size, leaving the outer membrane occupying the space to which 
it had been distended by the water, and appearing under transmitted 
light like a transparent limb to the opake spore." The minute gra- 
nules in the spore are said to be " exactly similar to those contained 
in the pollen-grains of flowering plants ; " and the author is of opin- 
ion that they are of the same nature as the smaller granules on the in- 
tegument and in the spaces between the cells of the theca ; he also 
finds that the larger granules are soluble in boiling water though not 
in alcohol ; water does not dissolve the smaller ones, and alcohol pro- 
duces no other effect on them than to suspend their motion.
Iodine 
imparts to the larger granules a bluish colour, but produces little or 
no effect on the small ones.
Both kinds of granules have been found by the author in the unripe 
thecEB of ferns, of Lycopodium and of Ophioglossum ; he has also ob- 
served active granules in the unripe thecae of mosses and several spe- 
cies of Jungermannia, in the apothecia of lichens, in the lamellae of 
Agarics and the perithecia of some other Fungi.
" On comparing these granules with those contained in the unopened anthers of 
flowering plants, they appear to me to be in every respect identical ; in both cases, 
where the larger ones occur, they are similarly acted upon by iodine, and are therefore 
probably of the same nature ; in the theca they appear to occupy a similar place with 
those in the cells of the anthers, and they decrease in like manner during the progress 
to maturity of the pollen-grain and of the spore.
In the granular contents of the spore 
also there is the most perfect resemblance to those of the pollen-grain.
Perhaps the 
most obvious difference is in the entire absence of green colour from the fluid of the 
latter."â€” p.
671.
The paper concludes with a detail of the changes which take place 
in the organization of the theca during the progress of the spores to 
maturity ; and the descriptions are illustrated by figures.

â€” Account of two neiv Genera allied to Olacinese.
By George 
Bentham, Esq., F.L.S.
The two species on which Mr. Bentham has founded one new ge- 
nus, Pogopetaliun, are among the plants collected by M.
Schombm-gk 
in British Guiana : and fine specimens of another genus, named Apo- 
dytes dimidiata by Ernst Meyer in Drege's plants, but first described 
in the present paper, are in a collection from Port Natal, in South 
255 
Africa, communicated to the author by Mr. Harvey.
The determiua- 
tion of these genera having led the author into an inquiry as to the 
affinities of others belonging to the same group, the results of his in- 
quiries are given in the paper here published.
Great difference of opinion seems to have been entertained among 
botanists, respecting the true position and affinities of the Olacineae : 
after giving a synoptical view of the whole order, in which the eleven 
genera belonging to it are briefly characterized and divided into three 
tribes, the author comes to the conclusion that Mr. Brown's view of 
the close connexion of this order with the Santalacese is the correct 
one.
The j^aper concludes with detailed descriptions of the two new 
genera, which are also figured.

Read the following " Notice of the discovery of 
Cucuhalus baccifer, Linn., in the Isle of Dogs." By Mr. George 
Luxford, A.L.S.
" The accompanying specimen of Cucubalus baccifer was, with many others, col- 
lected by me in the Isle of Dogs, in the early part of last August.
This plant was 
originally introduced into the British Flora by Dillenius, in the third edition of Ray's 
Synopsis, [267, under the name of Cucubalus Plinii].
He there speaks of it as hav- 
ing been gathered in hedges in Anglesea (Mona) by Mr. Foulkes of Llanbeder, and 
sent by him to Dr. Richardson ; but in a letter from Mr. Foulkes to the latter gentle- 
man, published in the Linnean Conrespondence, vol.
ii.
p. 171, he states that he only 
had ' an account of it from one who pretended to know plants very well,' but that he 
himself ' could find no such plant.' In a note to this letter, in the work just mention- 
ed.
Sir J.
E. Smith says, ' Nobody, as far as I could learn, has ever met with the plant 
since, except in curious botanic gardens, in any part of the British isles ; and accord- 
ingly I was obliged to be content with a garden specimen for the figure in ' English 
Botany,' tab.
1577.
I am, therefore, under the necessity, however unwillingly, of 
excluding the Cucubalus baccifer from our British Flora.' It was accordingly omit- 
ted when Sir James published his ' English Flora.' 
" The locality in the Isle of Dogs is on the banks of the ditch on the left hand of 
the road from Blackwall to the Ferry-House ; and there, if not truly indigenous, it is 
at least perfectly naturalized.
I also feel convinced that I have met with it in simi- 
lai- situations in other parts of England ; but the plant not being in flower, I have 
passed it, as I did the first time I saw it in the Isle of Dogs, thinking it to be merely 
Cerastium aquaticum, which in that state it much resembles.
It is probable that, like 
Polygonum dumetorum, this plant only requires to have the attention of botanists di- 
rected to it, to lead to its discovery in other localities ; and I shall be happy if my 
meeting with it so near London may be the means of getting it restored to the British 
Flora, where it is certainly as much entitled to a place as Centranthus mber, Petrose- 
linum sativum, and other avowedly naturalized plants.'' â€” p.

Read a "Notice of Cereus tetragonus." By Edward 
Rudge, Esq., F.L.S. The plant is a single stem between nine and ten 
feet high.
For about a foot from the roots it is four-angled ; at be- 
tween three and four feet it is five-angled, with the angles lobed, and 
within about eighteen inches of the top it has six angles.
The flowers 
are produced from the angles, and near the top of the stem.

Read " Descriptions of some Vegetable Mon- 
strosities." By the Rev. W.
Hincks, F.L.S. The case first described 
occurred in a flower of Iris versicolor, which had " 5 outer reflexed 
segments, 4 inner upright segments, 5 stamens, 5 distinct stigmas and 
a 5-celled ovarium.
This variation appears to have been the result 
of the union of two flowers ; and the author has witnessed a similar 
case in some QEnotherse.
The second case occurred in Iris sambu- 
cina, in which " 3 segments of the inner series only remain, while there 
are 5 parts in all the other circles : the line of junction is much less 
evident than in the former, but may be observed in the ovarium and 
tube of the perianthium." 
After mentioning similar cases of union of parts in other plants, Mr.
Hincks observes : â€” 
*' But tlie most remarkable instance of this kind of union with which he has met, 
(Occurs in a specimen of Scrophularia nodosa, found at Water Fulford, near York, in 
which four flowers are united into one.
In this case several monstrous flowers occur 
on the same branch, but are generally unions of only two flowers, and the tenninal 
flowers are invariably of the ordinary structure.
This Mr. Hincks regards as what 
might be expected in a plant with centrifugal inflorescence, where the monstrosity 
consists of a union of flowers ; whereas in the same kind of inflorescence, when the 
monstrosity consists in a more full and equal development, the central flower might be 
expected to be the first afiected ; and this actually occurs in a specimen which he pos- 
sesses, of a species of Linaria with all the terminal flowers (and those alone) peloriated.
" In the stalk of the flower of Scrophularia nodosa referred to, Mr. Hincks thinks 
he can recognize the junction of 4 peduncles; the number of sepals is 15, one of them 
being narrow and somewhat displaced ; that of the petals, which all cohere together, 
1 6.
Of these 7 are the lower or more developed petals, which are upright in the limb 
and are united in pairs.
* * Of the upper or reflexed petals only 9 remain ; and 
as there are 3 of these in each ordinary flower, if one be supposed to have perished at 
each juncture, according to the analogy of the Irides and CEnotherEe, the whole num- 
ber will be accounted for.
The number of stamens is 20, or 5 to each flower; one of 
these has its anther abortive and changed into a scale, and there are several instances 
of two being united together, but all may be distinctly traced.
There are 3 distinct 
ovaria," [two of which are each 2-celled, the third is 8-celled].

â€” List of Jungermanniee S^c.
observed in the neigh- 
bourhood of Dumfries.
By James Cruickshank, Esq.
The neighbourhood of Dumfries appears particularly favourable to 
the growth of Cryptogamic plants, especially mosses and Hepaticae, 
as may at once be seen both from the number of species and the size 
and beauty of the specimens.
The extensive tracts of uncultivated mossy ground on the Dumfries 
side of the Nith, and the long range of green pasture hills on the op- 
posite side of the river in Kirkcudbrightshire, intersected as they are 
by deep rocky glens, and in some parts covered with extensive woods, 
are all favourable to the growth of these orders.
T have for the last two years paid particular attention to the mosses 
and HepaticEe, and have succeeded in collecting a good number of 
species of each.
I subjoin a list of the Hepaticae, with their locali- 
ties, and, so far as I can judge fi-om my opportunities for observation, 
the frequency of their occurrence throughout the district.

â€” Notes on the Genus Utricular ia.
By the Rev. J.
B. Brichan.
The second species of this genus â€” Utricularia intermedia â€” has 
long had assigned to it, as one of its habitats, the Loch of Spynie in 
Morayshire.
Having never examined that locality I cannot ])ositively 
affirm that the species is not to be found there ; but I think that the 
following remarks, if they do not prove the contrary, at least render it 
very doubtful whether it has ever been gathered in Morayshire.
About ten years ago 1 received from a botanical friend a single 
specimen of an Utricularia labelled intermedia, and taken from the 
locality in question.
Without particularly comparing it with the de- 
scription, and not doubting the authority by which it was named, I 
added it to my collection.
Not long after I had the pleasure of find- 
ing in the Moss of Inshoch, Nairnshire, a plant flowering abundantly, 
which on examination I found to be indubitably Utricularia minor ; 
it then struck me that the plant I had found and examined was the 
z 2 
260 
same as that which had been sent me from the Loch of Spynie, and 
on comparing them they appeared identical.
Not over confident, 
however, in my own botanical discrimination, I commmiicated my 
opinion to my disinterested friend Mr. Stables, who sent some of my 
Nairnshire specimens to Sir W.
J. Hooker.
That distinguished bo- 
tanist pronounced them to be specimens of U.
minor, and this, of 
course, I received as a final confirmation of my own opinion.
It may not at once appear from what 1 have written, that Utricula- 
ria intermedia has not been found in the Loch of Spynie.
From cir- 
cumstances, however, which have come under my cognizance, I have 
not the least doubt that all the specimens gathered there as U.
inter- 
media have belonged to the other species â€” Utricularia minor.
To 
confirm what T say, let me present the reader with the following ex- 
tract from a ' Collectanea for a Flora of Moray,' published in 1839.
â€” 
"U.
intermedia.
Observed to flower annually since 1830, in some 
holes whence turf seems to have been cut, under the north bank of 
the Loch of Spynie, about half a mile west from Ardivol.
If there 
he a specific difference hetween this and U.
minor, the Spynie plant 
upon closer inspection will probably be found to belong to the latter 
species.^'' 
I request the reader's attention to that part of the extract which T 
have marked for Italics ; it implies a doubt concerning the existence 
of any specific distinction between U.
interaiedia and U.
minor.
This at once convinces me that the writer of it had never gathered U.
intermedia, and that the specimens in his possession were specimens 
of U.
minor.
The former I have never seen, except as figured in Sir 
J. E.
Smith's ^ English Botany ; ' but presuming from the correctness 
with which U.
vulgaris and minor are there given, that U.
intermedia 
also is correctly figured, I have not a doubt as to the truly specific 
distinctness of all three ; and I think that U.
intermedia would more 
readily be confounded with vulgaris than with minor.
It seems ra- 
ther surprising that the Spynie plant should ever have been mistaken, 
as it appears to have been.
Perhaps the following description of the three species of Utricula- 
ria, from ' The Northern Flora,' may be acceptable to the reader.
1. Utricularia vulgaris.
" Plant floating, of considerable size, sometimes fully a foot long.
Leaves green, 
composed of numerous capillary or bristle-like segments, fringed at the margin, and 
carrying small, beautiful, reticulated bladders.
Flowers yellow, placed upon a leafless 
stem, which elevates them several inches above the water: lower lip longer than the 
261 
upper, and having a projecting palate, which is about the same length as the upper 
lip.
Spur conical." 
2. Utricularia intermedia.
" Leaves with a similarity to those of the former, usually dividing into three parts, 
each of Avhich splits into two flat acute segments, fringed with hristle-like teeth.
Blad- 
ders placed upon separate stalks.
Flowers yellowish : the upper lip twice as long as 
the palate.
Spur conical.'' 
3. Utricularia minor.
" Leaves smooth at the edges and bearing bladders.
Flowers few and small, pale 
yellow, with a very short blunt keeled spur : upper lip about the length of the palate." 
The author of *The Northern Flora' further observes, that " inde- 
pendently of the flowers it will be possible to determine the plants, as 
follows.
The Jirst species may be always recognized by the large 
size, and by the leaves being minutely fringed and supporting the 
little bladders.
In the second the bladders are not mixed with the 
leaves, but placed upon distinct stalks, and the plant is more leafy, 
with the segments broader, and, so far as I have observed, of a paler 
green.
The last species is known by its small size and smooth leaves, 
which support the bladder-like bodies." 
I may add, that as far as my experience goes, U.
vulgaris flowers in 
deep water, while U.
minor flowers only in shalloiv.

veind, Kirkcudbrightshire, where it was discovered by Mr, John Brown, Dumfries, in 
1838, thus proving that it is found on the west coast of Scotland, where Sir W.
J. 
Hooker says it does not occur.

Economical use of the Brake {Pteris aquilina, Linn.) in the Forest of Dean.
Passing a few days a fortnight since at a friend's house in the Forest of Dean, Glou- 
cestershire, I was surprized by some girls bringing a quantity of recently cut Pteris 
aquilina, or " Earn" which they retailed about at twopence per bxishel.
On enquiring 
the use to which it was put, I was informed that it was extensively employed in the 
forest for feeding pigs, which are very fond of it.
For this purpose, however, it must 
be cut while the fronds are still uncurled, and a quantity of them boiled in a furnace.
The slushy or mucilaginous mass thus produced is then consigned to the wash-tub, or 
any other receptacle, and in this state it will keep as pig-food for a considerable length 
of time.
I was informed that it was found very serviceable, especially to cottagers, 
as coming in at an early period of the summer, when the produce of the garden is 
but scanty.
Perhaps a boiled dish of the Pteris in its circinate state, might not be ve- 
ry unpalateable or unacceptable with a broiled rasher of bacon â€” at least to a hungry 
man.
If so, we might thus have a variation in our spring vegetable condiments; but 
I am not aware whether the experiment has been made.

Enquiry respecting Carex axillaris and remota.
Allow me, through the me- 
dium of ' The Phytologist,' to enquire if any of the readers of that work can tell me 
how to distinguish Carex axillaris from Carex remota.
I have spent much time in 
trying to make out the difference, and all to no purpose.
Carex axillaris is said to be 
a very rare plant ; this may account for my not being able to make it out.
Dr. Good- 
enough tells us in the second volume of the Liunean Transactions, that the capsules 
in C.
remota are entire, and in C.
axillaris cloven ; if I rely on that character C.
re- 
mota / have never seen.
But on turning to the third volume of that work, I find Dr.
Goodenough withdrawing the statement, and telling us that he believes that all Cari- 
ces dispose of their seeds by the opening of the points of their capsules.
It would ap- 
pear by this that Dr. Goodenough was not a very close observer of the Carices, or he 
would have known that they, at least our British species, do not dispose of their seeds 
in other way than by their capsules (if so I may call them) and seeds falling together.
Smith seems to rely very much on the spikes being simple or compound ; he tells us 
that the spikes of C.
remota are simple, and those of C.
axillaris compound : if this 
be the character to distinguish them by, I have often seen both species on the same 
root.
He also says that the lower bracteas of C.
axillaris are very long, and that the 
beak of the fruit is more deeply cloven than that of C.
remota, though he says the dif- 
ference is not very striking.
It appears that Sir W.
J. Hooker relies very much on 
the length of the lower bracteas in distinguishing the two species ; directly opposite to 
what Smith has said, he tells us that the lower ones in C.
axillaris are scarcely so long 
as the spike.
He also tells us that C.
axillaris is a stouter and taller plant than C.
261 
retnota, the latter character needs no comment ; suffice it to say that I have now before 
me good specimens with roots, varying in height from three inches to three feet; and 
as to the bracteas, a little attention to the Carices will serve to show that the length of 
these parts is not at all to be depended upon- I see there is something said in the 
' British Flora ' on the scales of the calyx of the two species ; these I will now exa- 
mine and give you the result.
The three scales I now enclose are from the same spike ; 
they all have tivo close green nerves ; in one you will observe that the nerves are discon- 
tinued below the point, in the others they are extended to the point : you will also ob- 
serve that one is only about one half the proportionate breadth of the others.
As the 
scales of most of our Carices are much broader about the middle or in the lower part 
of their sj)ikes than at or near the summit, we may rely too much on such characters.
Now, after gaining what information I possibly can from books, I turn to my speci- 
mens, and on examining them, among the rest I find two fine specimens of C.
divulsa, 
sent to me a few years ago (from what was then considered good authority) for C.
ax- 
illaris ; another I find, of recent date (from what is now considered good authority), 
that was sent for C.
axillaris, which turns out to be C.
paniculata ; so that I gain no 
infoimation by this, and as a last resource I avail myself of ' The Phytologist.' Per- 
haps some of the readers of that work will be able and kind enough (if there be no se- 
cret in the matter), to inform me how to distinguish the two species.
In addition to 
the above enquiry, I beg to say that good specimens or information on any of the Ca- 
rices is always most gratefully received by me; as it is my intention, at some time or 
other, to give a paper at some length on the British species and varieties of this genus, 
when I shall have to notice some strange forms, and one in particular, which is now 
considered to be a new species, and will be called Carex Leylandi.
The plant was dis- 
covered by me about a mile from Hebden Bridge in May 1840.
It has been seen by 
Mr. Leighton and many others of our eminent botanists, and they all consider it quite 
new ; and Mr. Babington, in his letters also expresses his opinion that it is distinct.

Enquiry respecting Bromus commutatv^.
While on the subject of enquiries, 
allow me to ask what are the " more technical distinctions " of Bromus commutatus ?
(Phytol.
136).
The writer of the notice refen-ed to appears to doubt whether Bromus 
arvensis be a British plant ; a few days ago I had the pleasure of giving to Mr. Bor- 
rer specimens of the true B.
arvensis.
I first found the plant in 1840, growing about 
half a mile from Hebden Bridge ; and in 1841 I again found it in abundance in this 
neighbourhood.
The three spikelets I enclose will serve to show that no reliance can 
be placed on the size of the flowers : the three are from the same plant.

Stellaria holostea with laciniated petals.
In my rambles about this neighbour- 
hood I have met with a singular laciniated variety of Stitchwoit (Stellaria holostea ?).
The petals have at the base of the incisure a very minute tooth, slender and sharp- 
pointed, about half a line in length ; the tip of each segment of the petals is also di- 
vided into two unequal acute teeth, the outermost being about half the size of the in- 
ner one.
The leaves on the stems are the shape and size of those of S.
holostea, and 
have also the peculiarly fine serrature of the edges.
The flowers are about one third 
smaller than the regular size of those of S.
holostea.
The plants formed several large 
bushes in the hedge on one side of the road near the summit of one of our mountains, 
they occupied a portion of the hedge about a dozen yards in length, forming four or 
five rather large bushes at each end of the above distance.
Bushes of plants with 
flowers of the regular form were closely adjoining them, the branches in one case in- 
265 
lertwining.
The laciniation ol' the petals gave the bushes of the plant a singular ap- 
pearance, that attracted the attention when at some distance.
I intend to tiy to pro- 
cure some of the seeds when mature, and sow them against next season, in order to 
observe whether the dentation of the petals will be trasmitted by seeds or not.

Lavatera Olbia in Epping Forest.
A few years since a new piece of road was 
made through Epping Forest to Woodford.
At a spot called Fair-mead Bottom a 
large quantity of earth was dug from the forest and thrown up to raise the road, for 
the distance of about half a mile.
The following summer the sides of this piece of 
road were covered with various plants, such as Senecio Jacobaea, thistles, &c., and 
among them a great number of plants of Lavatera Olbia, a species not known, I be- 
lieve, as a native of Britain.
There is not the slightest doubt that the seeds had been 
buried for a vast number of years, and vegetated when brought to the surface, as it 
seems impossible for the plants to have got there in any other way.
For three or four 
years they seemed to flourish, and flowered abundantly ; but now the banks having 
become covered with grass &c., they seem to be disappearing, and last year I could 
find only three or four plants : when I first noticed it there were hundreds scattered 
along the whole length of the raised portion of the road.

The following Statement was read.
â€” " The Council, having had under their se- 
rious consideration the financial affairs of the Society, submit the following statement 
to the Fellows at large.
The cost of the Collections and Library of Linnaeus, toge- 
ther with those of the first President, Sir James Edward Smith, purchased of the exe- 
cutors of the latter in 1828, amounted to Â£3000.
Of this sum about Â£1500 were 
then raised by subscription ; and to meet the remainder a debt, on bonds, was incur- 
red, which now amounts to Â£1300, paying interest at 5 per cent.
In consequence 
partly of this amount of interest, and partly of a diminution in the annual receipts, 
there has been accumulated, within the last few years, a further debt of about Â£500.
By recent arrangements a saving of some amount has been effected in the expendi- 
266 
ture ; but the Council are convinced that no farther material reduction can be made, 
without greatly impairing the efficiency of the Society, and they desire to avoid, as far 
as possible, the necessity of calling upon the Fellows to agree to a small charge being 
placed upon the Society's publications, that appearing to be the most obvious means 
of supplying the deficiency in the annual receipts.
With this view they propose a 
general subscription, which they trust may reach such an amount as to meet the pre- 
sent liabilities, and to relieve the funds of the Society from the burthen of debt and 
interest.
They, therefore, earnestly recommend the subscription to the members of the 
Society." The names of subscribers to the amount of Â£600 were appended to this 
statement, which was circulated among the members present at the meeting.

June 9, 1842.
â€” Dr. Neill in the chair.
Donations to the library and herbarium 
were announced from the Worcestershire Natural-History Society, Dr. Miguel, M.
Parlatore and Mr. Sowerby.
Professor Graham communicated the agreeable intelligence, that the late Mr. Ar- 
chibald Menzies had bequeathed to the Botanic Garden his interesting and valuable 
herbarium, which was chiefly formed in the course of his voyages round the world with 
Vancouver and other circumnavigators.
Mr. Menzies was the last survivor of Van- 
couver's companions, having lived to the age of eighty-eight.
He was a native of 
Perthshire, and studied at this University, towards which he continued throughout life 
to entertain the warmest feelings of attachment.
The chairman adverted, with deep regret, to the loss which the Society, in common 
with the botanical world, had sustained by the death of Mr. Falconar of Carlowrie, who 
was a most zealous and successful cultivator of the science, and who enjoyed, in a high 
degree, the esteem and respect of his friends.
The following papers were read : â€” 
1. Notice of the discovery of Phascum alternifolium (Bruch &c.) in Dumfriesshire, 
and of Arenaria verna, on the west coast of Scotland : communicated by Mr. James 
Cruickshank.
This Phascum is not the plant of Hooker, which is the Archidium 
phascoides of continental botanists.
The present plant was formerly discovered in Bri- 
tain, but long ago and in very smaU quantity.
It is, in the opinion of Mr. Wilson, a 
good species.
Arenaria verna was found at Drumlanrig, by Mr. Cruickshank.
It is 
very rare, if existing at all, on the west coast of Scotland.* 
2. Notice on the occurrence of Avena alpina and Saxifraga umbrosa in Yorkshire :

elevation of between 600 and 800 feet above the sea.
When growing in our elevated 
open pastures the plants are generally single, also on our limestone cliffs ; but when in 
our natural woods, which are mostly hazle, it is found in large tufts, where you may 
get perhaps fifty specimens in the space of a few inches.
I believe I could send from 
the same tuft specimens of ulpina with the panicle quite as simple as any pratensis.
I consider Saxifraga umbrosa as really wild here.
It is met with in Heseltine Gill, 
which is a deep ravine at the foot of Pen-y-ghent, and Fountains Fell.
There are 
only two houses in about three miles, and these not near the place.
Actcea spicata, 
Rihes petrcBum, &c., grow along with it.
The valley runs from west to east, and the 
Saxifraga is found only on the south side, which receives no sunshine except in sum- 
mer.
Some of the plants are inaccessible, the cliffs are so steep." 
The impression of the meeting was that no specific distinction existed between the 
plant now shown as Avena alpina and A.
pratensis, and the same remark may be ap- 
plied to all other specimens of the former hitherto exhibited from British stations.
.3.
On three new Species of Grasses of the Genus Poa : by Richard Parnell, M.D., 
F.R.S.E. The author stated that these grasses were so unlike, in general appearance, 
to any of the other Pace, and possessed such strong marks of specific distinction, that 
he considered them entitled to rank as distinct species.
1. Poa sectipalea, Parnell.
â€” 
This plant differs from Poa pratensis, the only species it can well be confounded with, 
in the branches of the panicle being stouter, more erect and rigid ; the spikelets larger.
Outer palea seven or nine ribbed, seven of the ribs being very distinctly marked ; in- 
ner palea one-third shorter than the outer, and invariably divided to the very base : 
whereas in Poa prateresis the inner [Pouter] palea has never more nor less than five 
ribs, and the inner very little shorter than the outer, and always entire.
Found grow- 
ing in sandy situations between Cramond and Queensferry.
2. Poa polynoda, Parnell.
This species differs from Poa compressa, in the florets not being ribbed at the base ; 
outer palea five-ribbed.
Joints eight or ten in number, the uppermost joint situated 
but a short distance from the panicle ; whereas in Poa compressa the florets are very 
distinctly ribbed, suspending the carix [?] by their silky fibres.
Outer palea three-rib- 
bed.
Joints seldom exceeding four in number.
3. Poa nemoralis, montana of Koch.
Inflorescence simple, panicled, occasionally racemed.
Panicle erect, narrow and slen- 
der ; the branches erect, long and slender, bearing few spikelets.
Spikelets lanceolate- 
ovate, of two or three awnless florets.
Calyx of two unequal, acute glumes, three-rib- 
bed.
Florets not in the slightest degree webbed.
Outer palea five-ribbed, the dorsal 
and marginal ribs slightly haiiy.
The whole plant is of a glaucous hue.
This grass 
was first obtained by Dr. Greville, who, in the year 1833, gathered several specimens 
on Ben Lawers; since then it has been found in many parts of the Highlands, but has 
hitherto been considered as a glaucous variety of P.
nemoralis.
These grasses are figured in Dr. Parnell's work on the Scottish grasses, now in the 
press, in which he has given 130 figures, with minute descriptions.
Dr. Graham exhibited some beautiful exotics from the greenhouses, chiefly natives 
of Asia â€” and also a specimen of the interesting Megaclinum falcatuyn in flower, which 
had been raised by Mr. Gray, of Greenock.
A handsome plant of Armerla fasciculata 
from the south of Eiuope, which had been raised in the Horticultural Garden, was 
likewise exhibited.

A paper was read 
from Edwin Lees, Esq., F.L.S., " On the Flora of the Malvern Hills.
Part 3 : being 
a Sketch of the Cryptogamic Vegetation indigenous to the chain." 
Notwithstanding the limited extent of this narrow chain of hills, scarcely exceed- 
ing nine miles in length, and rising to only 1500 feet in altitude, yet they offer almost 
every variety of aspect and condition favourable to the development of Cryptogamic 
vegetation.
In fact the Malvern Hills, when considered only as a ridge, vsdthout refe- 
rence to the country around them, are far more remarkable for their Aeotyledonous 
than their Vascular productions.
Commencing with the Northern termination of the hills in Cowleigh Park, several 
miniature syenitic spurs here appear, abrupt and rocky yet prettily shaded with wood, 
amidst deep glens and shaggy defiles overtopped by lateral steeps of limestone, amidst 
whose gullies streamlets are ever gushing with musical intonation.
From this " happy 
valley " a verdant park-like glacis leads the wanderer up among the exposed treeless 
turf, and rugged, jutting-out, lichened rocks of the End and North Hills, those of the 
latter being more precipitous and remarkable than those of any other hill of the chain, 
and boasting a great number of lapideous lichens.
Between this hill and the Wor- 
cestershire Beacon, a deep and winding valley extends, watered by bubbling stream- 
lets, and abutted by moist dripping rocks on the southern side, where several species 
of Jungermannia shelter ; but it must be observed that excepting in this place, and in 
" The Gullet" (as it is termed) of the Holly -bush Hill, almost all the other Malvern 
rocks are without exception dry and bleached by the wind and sun.
At the Western 
base of the Worcestershire Beacon occurs one of the few bogs that yet remain about 
the hills, Aspidium Oreopteris marking this and the other boggy places by the profu- 
sion in which it covers the margin of the black soil.
A mile farther south, at " the 
Wych," the syenite and limestone are in contact, and the latter having been exten- 
sively quarried, numerous abandoned excavations occur, in many instances embowered 
in wood, and offering favourite habitats for many mosses unable to fruit on the sun- 
burnt sides of the hills.
These limestone rocks also offer an instructive example of 
the lichens more particularly affecting limestone, when compared with the loftier and 
more exposed syenite.
From the Worcestershire Beacon undulating green knolls, many cultivated to near 
the summit, stretch past the Wells for a distance of four miles to the Herefordshire 
Beacon, without any intervening valley ; but diversified in some places by rocky dry 
ravines, strewed with broken fragments, and in others by plantations, or natural thick- 
ets of stunted whitethorn along their sides.
Round tufts of Ulex nanus dot the hills 
in every direction.
The portion of the chain just mentioned terminates rather ab- 
ruptly at " the Wind's Point," where a deep valley commences, plunging down to the 
eastern base of the Herefordshire Beacon, and extending to the romantic wooded vi- 
cinity of Little Malvern Priory, where some thick alder-holts shroud a purling stream.
The Herefordshire Beacon, with several detached eastern buttresses, lifts up its 
bare, shivering and indented fortified sides in sullen grandeur, turf and mosses alone 
occupying its windy ramparts, except a number of scathed, old, scattered elder-trees.

Mr. L.
considered that nearly one half of the plants occupying the Malvern Hills 
are Cryptogamic ; and the following synopsis will show this to he not an unreasonahle 
supposition, especially as the census the author had taken is not to be considered a per- 
fect one, embracing however all the species Mr. L.
had been enabled to identify after 
an attentive examination of five years and upwards,

Mr. Lees had been unable to give any attention to the AlgcE Confervoidece, and had 
not taken much note of the minuter species of Sphceria among the Fungi, so that were 
these carefully noted by the algologist and practised mycologist, doubtless the list 
might be easily extended to a thousand or more.
But in an enumeration of the Flo- 
ra of any locality, especially when considered with reference to a comparison with otlier 
lists, it is hardly fair to drag into the account every black spot or stain upon leaves or 
dead sticks ; and therefore Mr. L.
had left untouched nearly all but the really tangi- 
ble and decided species, independent of minute microscopical examination.
Ferns.
â€” The rarer ferns of the hills are Pobjpodium Dryopteris and Allosorus ciis- 
pus ; the latter only occurs upon the Herefordshire Beacon, thus offering a good illus- 
tration of the geographical distribution of plants, the fern thus occurring so sparingly 
on these hills being plentiful upon the Welch mountains.
Asplenimn viride, also an- 
other fern of common occurrence about the waterfalls of Wales, though not found oa 
the hills themselves, occurs on an old stone bridge over the Teme called Ham Bridge, 
a few miles northward of Great Malvern.
Aspidium Oreopteris occupies in profusion 
the margin of various boggy spots on both the eastern and western sides of the hills.
Aspidium dilatatum is of common occurrence among the stones of the hills; and As- 
plenium Filix-fcemina almost fills the little watery glens running among them.
Poly- 
podium vulgare, with stunted growth and multilobed varieties, is not unfrequentlymet 
with in and on the sides of deep hollow lanes.
Grammitis Ceterach, though scarcely 
truly belonging to the district, and not found on any of the rocks, yet flourishes on a 
massive stone wall by the side of the road at Great Malvern ; and Mr. L.
had also no- 
ticed this fern growing in the interstices of an old brick wall at Forthampton.
On 
Rosebery Rock, north of Great Malvern, Mr. L.
had gathered very singular specimens of 
Scolopendrium vulgare, eighteen inches in length, with the extremities of the frond lobed 
in a most remarkable multifid manner; the specimens are in the Society's herbarium 
having been sent some time since.
Pteris aquilina robes the bases and three parts up 
most of the hills of the chain, and would be a great pest were it not mowed down eveiy 
autumn, and stacked in ricks for litter by the humble economical farmer.
It is per- 
haps remarkable that Mr. L.
had never yet been able to detect a single species of Ly- 
copodium at any point or in any spot throughout the entire length of the chain or about 
its base.
Mosses.
â€” The mosses have exercised a considerable agency in the creation of the 
soil now upon the Malvern Hills ; doubtless indeed they were the primary originators 
270 
of vegetation upon the bare rocks, whose hollows they have filled up in the lapse of 
ages with a soft spongy carpel, and so encompassed and obscured them that numerous 
masses of grey rock, almost immersed in the verdant mossy inundation, now scarcely 
exhibit their points above it.
The lichens have been generally considered as the first 
pioneers of vegetation, but their eff'orts to create a humus for the nourishment of other 
plants are but trifling when compared with the economical powers of the mosses.
To 
test this by experiment, observing the tiled roof of an outbuilding at Malvern Wells, 
evidently erected but a few years, studded with tufts of Bryum capillare, (Linn.), Mr.
Lees gathered one of them in March last, with the black earth collected around its 
base.
The mass altogether weighed six ounces ; bnt when, after repeated and careful 
washings, Mr. L.
had extracted all or nearly all the black mould that enveloped the 
roots, the actual residuum of frondescence when weighed amounted to only half an 
ounce ; thus satisfactorily showing (for no soil could have been collected on the slop- 
ing roof, independently of the agency of the Bryum) that the moss, through atmosphe- 
rical and imbral agency, had formed a soil exceeding its own weight at the very least 
above ten times !
By operations on a more extensive scale, it is easily conceivable 
how a bare mass of rock may, in the course of a few years, be covered with a thick 
coating of soil, sufiicient for the nourishment of any of the phanerogamous species 
adapted to the climate and elevation where they may stand.
Mr. L.
regretted that in 
the experiment adduced he could not certainly determine the exact space of time that 
the Bryum had occupied the roof ; but as it is found expedient, from the excessive 
growth of mosses, to cleanse roofs about Malvern almost every year, Mr. L.
felt cer- 
tain that, at the utmost, the plants in question had been located on the tiles between 
two and three years.
Bryum hornum has been noticed to be a great accumulator of 
soil in marshy spots ; while the excessive growth alone of the stems and foliage of such 
mosses as Sphagnum palustre, Dicranum glaucum, Bryum falustre, Hypium molluseum, 
Hypnum cuspidatum^ &c., in the course of time entirely fills up bogs, drinks up their 
water, and conduces to their ultimate establishment as component parts of terra firma 
fit for useful cultivation.
In this manner Mr. Lees considered the Malvern Hills to 
have received originally that rich humus which covers their sides, and which, combined 
with the disintegrating touch of time's mouldering fingers, renders their soil, in the 
present day, capable of immediate cultivation, even in the steepest places, producing 
crops that well repay the toil of the industrious cultivator, and tend to give an im- 
pulse to fresh inclosures of the verdant turf every year.
On a first cursory glance 
at the turf of the hills, there seems a great sameness in the mosses that luxuriate there.
Dicranum scopariuin, Hypnum triquetrum, splendens, purum and molluseum, seeming 
as if they had united to exclude the rest, Hypnum triquetrum especially everywhere 
predominating.
However, a little attention will show a considerable variety, especially 
upon or in the immediate vicinity of the rocks or on the margin of the numerous tink- 
ling rills that show a cincture of the tenderest green wherever they tiickle down.
In- 
clusive of the woods about the bases of the hills, Mr. Lees had numbered 121 species, 
without by any means exhausting the interminable Hypna, so that it is probable a few 
more may yet be detected.
Specimens of nearly all that Mr. L.
had met with accom- 
panied the paper, and many of them were exhibited.
Here followed a list of those 
observed.

tish plants had been received from Mr. Sidney.
Read, the continuation of Mr. Edwin 
Lees' paper (commenced at the last meeting), â€” " On the Flora of the Malvern Hills.
Part 3 : being a Sketch of the Cryptogamic Vegetation indigenous to the Chain." 
Hepaticce.
â€” Among the Hepaticae occur Anthoceros punctatus and Targionia hypo- 
phylla, the latter at the foot of the Worcestershire Beacon ; and there are three species 
of 3Iarchantia, polyniorpha, conica and hemisphcerica.
The JungermannicB are not in 
such variety as might have been expected, though some of them, especially Tainarisci, 
dilatata and ciliaris, are abundant upon the turf of the hills as well as upon the rocks.
Jungermannia pinguis (Linn.) is excessively common, though very rarely fruiting: J.
tomentella is a beautiful species that has only occurred in one place, on a dripping 
rock in " the Gullet.'' The following are all the species Mr. L.
had met with : â€” 
Jungermannia asplenioides Jungermannia complanata Jungermannia Mackaii 
ventricosa scalaris serpyllifolia 
bicuspidata viticulosa dilatata 
connivens Trichomanis Tamarisci 
pusilla bidentata pinguis 
resupinata platyphylla epiphylla 
albicans ciliaris furcata 
obtusifolia ?
tomentella 
Lichens.
â€” The Mai vera Hills are particularly remarkable for the various lichens 
they produce, most of which grow in a very luxuriant and beautiful manner ; and in 
the moist autumnal and wintry months many of the rocks present an appearance from 
them truly gratifying to the lover of nature.
Some of the harder granitic rocks are 
entirely covered with Umbilicaria pustulata, which at this time is of an olive-green co- 
lour, and as flabby as a piece of moist leather, though in the summer months it appears 
as black and sooty as if subjected to the action of fire.
On other rocks the deep pur- 
ple Partnelia omphalodes extends itself, contrasted with wide patches of the grey Par.
physodes, the darker P.
saxatilis, the dingy P.
olivacea, or the conspicuous glaucous 
pitted thalli of Sticta scrobiculata.
On the higher rocks the curled Cetraria glauca 
grows in abundance ; while a remarkable hoary aspect is imparted to the protruding 
masses by the silvery Toidium comlloides, and the still more coralline appearance of 
Spheerophoron compressum.
The rein-deer lichen, Cladonia rangiferina, called by Crabbe 
" The iviry moss that whitens all the hill,'' â€” 
is plentiful on the turf with its allied species, and the sadder and darker Cornicularia ; 
while in every part the brown and scarlet apothecia of the Scyphophori, in all their 
multiform varieties, contribute to decorate the scene.
Tn the whole, including the 
cortical lichens, about 220 species are met with.
It may be specially remarked that the Parmeliaceae and Collematas, and the Pel- 
tigerous tribe of lichens, are particularly abundant on the Malvern Hills, as well on 
the moss and turf as on the rocks.
Here followed a list of the lichens, most of which 
accompanied the paper.
Fungi.
â€” The extensive dispersion of the majority of the Fungi causes thein to be 
met with in most parts of the country at all favourable to fungoid development.
The 
moist grassy declivities of the hills are, however, in autumn peculiarly adapted to the 
growth of the Agaric tribe ; and at that season great quantities appear, and of every 
conceivable colour, from the vivid scarlet of Agaricus muscarius, or the brilliant gi'een 
and yellow of A.
psittacinus, to the dullest brown assumed by the common fairy-ring 
A, oreades.
Mushrooms are generally very plentiful, though the common kind, A.
campestris, is much exceeded in numbers and luxuriance by A.
Georgii : A.
procerus 
is also very abundant, and frequently of enormous size.
A. granulosus, pratensis, co- 
nicus and coccineus commonly occur.
The short turf, too, is often adorned by different 
coloured Clavarice, inteimixed with the dark Geoglossum glahrum and Spathularia fia- 
vida.
The brilliant little blood-red Peziza humosa is very common amongst dark 
masses of Polytricha ; while in moist weather a characteristic feature is presented to 
view in the great number of " Jews' ears " {Exidia Auricula-Judce), hanging upon the 
countless old elders that cover the eastern declivity of the Herefordshire Beacon.
The little beech-wood behind the Wells Hotel, harbours several rare or curious 
species ; and here Mr. L.
had gathered the following species in great abundance : â€” 
Agaricus hypothejus, Fries.
Hydnum repandum Helvella crispa 
torminosus Thelephora coralloides Peziza onotica, Pers.
violaceus Clavaria abietina Phallus impudicus 
glaucopus rugosa 
In the same little wood Bryum roseum may always be found, and Mr. L.
had ga- 
thered it in fruit there.
Many other fungoid productions may be met with : and here followed a list of 
those observed.
On the whole the Flora of Malvern may be considered as most remarkable and 
abundant rather in its Cryptogamous than Phanerogamous productions.
After an at- 
tentive examination of the hills and the district around them for some years, Mr. Lees 
had been enabled to detei-mine : â€” 
Dicotyledonous Plants, 553 
Monocotyledonous Plants, 173 
Total Phanerogamic, 726 
Mr. L.'s Cryptogamic census amounts altogether to 712, and with a little more in- 
dustry and research among mycological productions, the author doubted not it might 
considerably exceed this amount, while few, he thought, could be added to the Pha- 
nerogamous list.
The flowering plants observed by Mr. Lees are extended to the limits 
(given in the first paper, Phytol.
152) to the banks of the Severn, while the Cryptoga- 
mia are more exclusively the product of the hills and the woods at their bases.
Alto- 
gether the entire number of plants which Mr. Lees had determined and appropriated 
as belonging to the Flora of the Malvern Hills, amounts to 1438.
Thanks having been voted to Mr. Lees for his interesting communication, the Pre- 
sident announced that the Council had appointed Mr. Arthur Henfrey, Curator ; and 
that the herbarium might be inspected every Monday, Wednesday and Friday, from 
10 to 4, and on Friday evenings from 7 to 10.
The President also announced that the 
first excursion of the members would take place on the 7th instant.

Equisetum Mackaii, Newman, Equin.
elongainm, Hooker, 
' London Journal of Botany,' 42 ; but neither of Willdenow nor 
Keichenbach.
y. Equisetum variegatiim, Schleicher.
Although our more eminent modern botanists have considered as 
distinct species the plants which I have here given as varieties; and 
although I most willingly admit that each, in its extreme state, is 
without difficulty to be distinguished from the others ; yet I am totally 
unable to find constant characters by which to distinguish either : I 
shall therefore treat of them as constituting but a single species, figur- 
ing nevertheless each peculiar form of its natural size, and giving on 
one block magnified representations of those characters which have 
been pointed out as distinctive.
The figures usually quoted as representing this plant are so in- 
correct that they can only be referred to with doubt.
Tragus* and 
Dalechamp,t whose figures are usually quoted as representations of 
Equisetum hyemale, have adorned the upper part of each stem with 
whorls of short branches, which give the plant a very extraordinary 
appearance, and suggest the idea of their being intended for Equise- 
tum limosum or Hippuris vulgaris, the upper part of the stems much 
resembling the latter plant ; and it should be added that Tragus as- 
signs to his figure the name of Hippuris.
It should however be ob- 
served that one of these figures is a servile copy from the other, the 
outline having been traced and transferred to another block, by which 
the figure has been reversed.
The figure in Matthiolus,!
also sup- 
posed to refer to this species, may possibly be intended for the varie- 
gatum of Schleicher ; but I can only venture this as a suggestion, for 
it is by no means characteristic of any plant with which I am acquaint- 
ed.
Gerarde's figureÂ§ evidently represents variegatum : the specimen 
selected for the purpose being more than usually divided : the learned 
author however ascribes to his plant the property usually assigned 
exclusively to the normal form, speaking of it as the " small and na- 
ked shave-grasse wherewith Fletchers and Combemakers doe rub and 
polish their work."|| Camei'arius^ also represents variegatum.
The 
figure in ' English Botany ' ** appears to me to be spoiled by an at- 
tempt to represent the roughness of the stem, which of course cannot 
be accomplished.
That in the * Flora Londinensis ' ft is the most 
characteristic I have met with.

The medicinal and other properties of this Equisetum have been 
amply recorded by the earlier herbalists, but most of them appear to 
quote Galen as their authority.
In consequence of the confused 
nomenclature and very indifferent figm-es of these authors, the pro- 
perties in question become very doubtfvd as intended for the present 
species ; and even were they so intended, all faith in them, as far as 
regards medicine, has long been exploded.
Tragus* tells us that it is 
most useful as a medicine, taken internally or externally ; internally 
its properties appear to be somewhat astringent, but it has long been 
out of use : held to the nostrils and applied at the same time on the 
neck, it stops bleeding at the nose, and when bruised and laid on a 
recent wound it staunches the blood.
We are told by Lightfootf that " some entertain an opinion that if 
cows chance to feed upon" this Equisetum "their teeth will drop out: 
how far this may be true," he adds, " I know not, but I am persuaded 
that the pasture must be very bad where they are compelled to eat 
such food." Sir William Hooker appears to give the plant credit for 
this injurious quality : he says " that though while to sheep it proves 
injurious, and that the teeth of cows who eat it soon fall out, it is 
wholesome for horses."| 
The stems of this plant have for centuries been used by artificers 
in smoothing the surface of wood, bone, and even metal, previously 
to giving these substances their final polish.
This employment of the

stem was noticed by Gerarde in the passage already quoted.
Haller* 
also mentions it as being in his day used in common with other spe- 
cies of Equisetum to polish metal vessels, but speaks of this species as 
being the roughest and best.
We are further told by Lightfootf that 
" in Northumberland the dairymaids scour their milk-pails with it." 
The value of this plant for the pui'pose of smoothing or polishing is 
not, however, merely traditionary, or, like its medicinal virtues, ima- 
ginary : it is still used for polishing wood, bone, ivory, and various 
metals, particularly brass ; for this purpose it is imported, under the 
name of " Dutch Rush," in large quantities, from Holland, where it is 
grown on the banks of canals and on the sea ramparts, which are of- 
ten bound together and consolidated by its strong and matted roots.
Bundles of this imported Dutch Rush are exposed for sale by many 
London shopkeepers.
They may be seen at Mr. Woodward's, Old 
Compton St., corner of Frith St., Soho.
I find however that a doubt 
exists with some excellent botanists, whether the Dutch Rush as cul- 
tivated in Holland is identical with either of the plants which I have 
enumerated.
,Mr. Shepherd, the curator of the Liverpool Botanic 
Garden, having this plant in cultivation, has most kindly supplied me 
with specimens in a recent state.
These are of much larger size than 
any British specimens of hyemale I have yet seen, and present struc- 
tural characters more strikingly different fi'om those of either of the 
British plants, than those by which these are distinguished from each 
other.
The most obvious differences are the much greater number of 
strise, amounting in some instances to thirty-two, and the colour of 
the sheath, which, at the base, is identical with that of the stem, and 
towards the apex paler or grey-green, the extreme margin being 
tipped with black.
The differences, however, do not appear so 
great on examining a bundle of these rushes as exposed for sale ; the 
stems being generally of much smaller size, and the sheaths variegat- 
ed with black and white, as in our British specimens.
a. Equisetum hyemale.
This plant appears almost unknown in the midland and southern 
English counties.
Indeed, throughout the kingdom it is but spar- 
ingly distributed, and may be considered a strictly local plant.
â€” 
In Turner and Dillwyn's ' Botanists' Guide,' the following English 
habitats are recorded : â€” in Northumberland, Scott's wood, wood be- 
* Omnia Eqiiiseta ad polienda vasa metallica adhibentur.

asperrimum ita aurifahris et scriniaviis suos ad usus optissimum est.

low Mill Green, and Heaton wood ; in Cumberland, Lowgelt-bridge ; 
in Durham, woods about Derwent bridge and Castle Eden Dean ; in 
Yorkshire, woods at Castle Howard and Kirkham, Rigby woods near 
Pontefract, near Ingleton and Halifax, about Leeds, Hackfall, near 
Huby, Laver Banks and Mackershaw wood, on the banks of the Skell 
by Ripon ; in Cheshire, near Arden Hall, in a wood close to the river ; 
in Norfolk, on St. Faith's bog and Arming Hall wood, near Norwich ; 
in Nottinghamshire, about the middle of Nettleworth Green, two miles 
from Mansfield, plentifully among the rushes ; in Warwickshire, in a 
moist ditch near Middleton ; in Cambridgeshire, Stretham Ferry and 
Gamlingay Bogs ; in Bedfordshire, Potton Marshes and Ampthill 
Bogs ; in Wiltshire, in a rivulet near Broadstitch Abbey, plentifully.
The same authors have recorded two Welch habitats : â€” in Denbigh- 
shire, on the west side of the brook that runs from Henllan Mill into 
the river Elwy, about 300 yards from Trap Bridge, less than a mile 
from Garm, and in Flintshire, near Maesmynnan.
Through the kind- 
ness of Dr. Greville, Dr. Balfour and Dr. Campbell, I have received 
specimens from several Scotch habitats, more particularly in the vici- 
nity of Edinburgh.
Mr. Kippist informs me that he has 
seen it in abundance in the woods about Corra Lyn, 
Lanarkshire.
In Ireland, Mr. Mackay and Mr. Moore 
have found it in the counties Dublin and Wicklow.
The roots are strong, black and frequently divided ; b^y.
the rhizoma or underground stem is creeping, jointed, W 
branched, and with age extends to a great length : at V, 
the joints it is solid, but between them it is par- 
tially hollow, the interior being occasionally more 
or less divided by longitudinal septa.
The stems 
are generally erect, and, when divided, the branch 
is lateral, and issues from the main stem imme- 
diately below the base of one of the sheaths; a 
stem has rarely more than a single branch.
The an- 
nexed figure represents a branched specimen, for 
which I am indebted to Dr. Greville : it is fi'om Ros- 
lin woods, near Edinburgh.
The engraving at the head of this article represents a stem of fine 
but not extraordinary growth : the stem has been divided into six por- 
tions in order to exhibit the whole at a single view ; its diameter 
and length, together with the distances between the sheaths, have 
been faithfully copied.
The sheaths in the sjiecimen figured are 
fourteen in number, the internodes decreasing in length towards 
278 
either end.
Both the internodes and sheaths are striated, the former 
more strongly so : the striae are usually about twenty in number in 
luxuriant stems, but this number is liable to great variation, and 
appears to depend solely on the size of the stem, always decreasing 
towards its attenuated apex.
The stems are hollow, and jointed or 
divided by a strong transverse septum at each of the sheaths : the striae 
of the sheaths correspond in number with those of the internodes, and 
they terminate in an equal number of acute and elongate, but mem- 
branous and often deciduous teeth.
Under certain but unascertained 
conditions these teeth become setiform and persistent, but in general 
all trace of them is early lost, the upper margin of the sheath exhi- 
biting a regular series of rounded divisions, uniform in number with 
the striae of the stem.
The basal portion of each sheath is black, 
the central part whitish, and the upper part again black, the deci- 
duous teeth excepted, the sides of which are membranous and trans- 
parent.
Sir Humphrey Davy detected in the stem of this plant an extraor- 
dinary quantity of silex ; it is this that communicates the rough and 
file-like character to its exterior, from which it derives its value as an 
article of commerce.
The silex appears in the form of minute crys- 
tals, and is arranged with beautiful and perfect regularity.
Under 
the microscope we find on the stem numerous longitudinal series of 
elevations, each bearing a cup-shaped depression in its centre, at the 
bottom of which is placed a stoma.
In the volume on Optics in 
Lardner's ' Cabinet Cyclopedia,' Dr. Brewster has recorded that he 
found each particle of silex to possess an axis of double refraction.
We are told by botanists that the quantity of silex is so great and the 
particles are so closely set, that the M^hole of the vegetable matter may 
be removed by maceration without destroying the form of the plant.
I'he catkin is small, dark coloured, apiculate and terminal; its 
scales are from forty to fifty in number, and each is impressed with 
two or three vertical striae.
Before the scales have separated in their 
approach to maturity, these striae are continuous throughout the cat- 
kin, even entering its terminal apiculus, which, in consequence, as- 
sumes a polyhedral figure : they generally correspond in number with 
the striae of the last internode, thus leading to the conclusion that the 
catkin is a metamorphosed portion of the stem.

Manchester.
By J.
B. Wood, Esq. M.D.
Broughton, near Manchester, 
March 10, 1842.
Sir, 
I have noticed and read with much interest and pleasure 
the several local lists which have appeared in ' The Phytologist.' Of 
the utility of such catalogues I think there can be but one opinion, as 
it is only by such means that the Botany of the Kingdom can be sa- 
tisfactorily known, the geographical range and distribution of the 
various species ascertained with any degree of accuracy, and the dis- 
covery of new habitats for some, hitherto considered unique or very 
rare, made public.
Should you deem the accompanying list of the 
principal plants of the Flora of this neighbourhood (and I have men- 
tioned only such as I conceived were not generally diffused, from the 
fear of trespassing too much on your pages) worthy of having a place 
in your valuable columns, I shall feel myself obliged by its insertion.

I. â€” Monograph of the British Atripliceee.
By Charles C.
Babington, M.A., 
F.L.S., F.B.S., F.G.S., &c.
" Much difficulty attends the determination of the species in the genus Atriplex, 
owing to the great tendency of some of their parts to become disproportionally en- 
larged when the plants are growing upon a richer soil than that to which they are ac- 
customed.
The leaves become thick and fleshy, and their form so much changed as 
nearly to obliterate the characters drawn from their shape and outline of margin ; an 
erect plant may become prostrate, or a slender and elegant one maybe so much thic k- 
ened, and so irregularly swollen in some or all of its parts, as scarcely to be identified 
by any person who has not made these plants his peculiar study.
It must therefore be 
manifest that, in determining the species, those specimens should be selected for exa- 
mination which are least affected by these changes.
This is more particularly requi- 
site in considering the calyx and fruit ; for in almost all the species a few of the calyces 
upon an individual are often very much enlarged and even become foliaceous, in which 
cases the fruit, if produced at all, is much larger than in the neighbouring calyces 
which are of the usual size, and the seed is often tuberculated and opaque, when its 
being smooth and shining is characteristic of the species.
It is probable that these 
unnaturally enlarged fruits are monstrosities, and would not germinate.
These chan- 
ges are generally the result of extreme luxuriance, caused by the plants growing upon 
richly manured soil or the muddy sea-shore, when their natural locality is waste land, 
or the shingly or rocky beach." â€” p.
5. 
The author remarks that he has ventured on the attempt to elucidate 
the species belonging to this tribe, " only after a careful and long-con- 
tinued study of the living plants : " and that it is probable that many 
even of our most eminent botanists will say â€” " if the plants are in- 
deed of so very variable a character as is represented in this paper, 
and the distinctions between them so uncertainly defined, they ought 
not to be divided to so great an extent, and that several of the species 
which I consider as distinct, must be looked upon as only forms of 
variable plants." 
285 
Mr. Babington meets these objections by observing that he cannot 
but think he has done Avell in keeping distinct all the species here de- 
scribed ; for, however anomalous may be their fonns, he can always 
refer the living plants to their respective species : and that if they are 
not to be separated by the characters employed in this paper, they 
must be reduced to fewer species than the author conceives would be 
recommended by " the most energetic 'lumper of species.' " 
In Meyer's ' Flora Altaica ' the European species of Chenopodia- 
cese are divided into four tribes, which may be thus characterized.
1. Salsolece.
Seeds with little or no albumen; embryo spiral.
British genera, 
Salsola and Schoberia.
2. ChenopodiacecB.
Seeds albuminous ; embryo forming a ring round the albumen ; 
(in these points agreeing with the two following tribes): flowers hermaphrodite : 
stems not jointed.
British genera, Chenopodiujn and Blitum.
3. Salicornece.
Flowers hermaphrodite : stem jointed.
British genus, Salicornia.
4. Atriplicea.
Flowers dioecious or monoecious, sometimes with a few hei-maphro- 
dite flowers intennixed : stems not jointed.
British genera, Atnplex and Ha- 
timus.
Mr. Babington remarks â€” " These tribes are well marked by their 
very different habit, although in description their characters may not 
appear to be peculiarly strong : " and then proceeds to describe the 
genera and species to which the paper refers.
I. Atriplex, Linn.
Flowers polygamous : female perigone compressed, formed of 
two distinct or more or less connate leaves : stigmas two : pericarp membranaceous, 
free : seed vertical, either attached near the base by a lateral hilum, or towards the 
centre by means of an elongated funiculus ; testa crustaceous ; radicle inferior, as- 
cending.

into 
The genus Atriplex, as thus restricted, may be again divided 
the two following sections.
1. Eiiatriplex, Meyer, (the true Atriplices).
Leaves of the female perigone two, 
distinct to the very base: seed vertical; horizontal in the hermaphrodite flow- 
ers, which are rarely produced.
2. Schizotheca, Meyer.
Flowers monoecious, (true hermaphrodite flowers never 
appearing) : leaves of the female perigone more or less connected below, the 
attachment not extending above the lower half.
"In both of these sections, only the latter of which has as yet been detected amongst 
the native plants of Britain, the pericarp is quite detached from the perigone, the tes- 
ta is crustaceous, and the radicle, although always ascending, is never terminal.'' â€” -3.

Mr. Babington remarks â€” " These two plants {littoralis and marina) differ from all 
the following, by the total want of larger lobes at the base of their leaves.
The latter 
species has long been considered as only a variety of the fonner, although originally 
distinguished by Linnaeus, and also adopted as a species by Hudson.
Within the last 
few years, they have been again distinguished upon the authority of the observations 
of Detharding, as published in his Conspectus quoted above ; and I have much plea- 
sure in recording, in confirmation of their distinctness, the valuable and independent 
observations of Mr. Power." â€” p.
6. 
It is probable that in a living state the plants may differ more than 
they do in description ; the chief points of distinction appear to be 
that in A.
littoralis the enlarged calyx-valves have " the apex in ge- 
neral considerably projecting and acute, each in an advanced state 
remarkably diverging from its fellow, and giving a peculiarly rough 
aspect to the plant," the tubercles on the margins of the valves are not 
coloured, and " the whole plant is more or less covered with a green- 
ish-hoary mealiness : " while in A.
marina the calyx-valves have "an 
obtuse contour at the apex, which scarcely at all projects from the 
outline of the valve, in many cases appearing like a mere continua- 
tion of the marginal denticulalions : they are closed when mature : " 
the points of the tubercles on the margins of the valves are generally 
reddish, " and the whole fruit and the fruit-stalks have a peculiar yel- 
lowish mealiness." 
3. Atriplex angustifolia, Sm.
! Stem erect or prostrate, nearly round, striated, 
usually with long, simple, opposite branches; each branch and the main stem termi- 
287 
naling in a wand-like, interrupted, siihsimple spike of distant few-flowered clusters.
Leaves lanceolate, entire; lower ones hastate, the lobes ascending from a wedge- 
shaped base, all shortly stalked.
Enlarged calyx-valves rhomboidal, acute, entire; 
lateral angles acute, prominent, ascending, without tubercles on the back, reticu- 
lated, rather longer than the smooth, shining, black seeds.

" In its normal state the whole of this plant is slender and delicate, the leaves thin, 
and the calyx of the fruit small, but sometimes the stems and leaves become thicken- 
ed and veiy fleshy, and the calyces exceedingly enlarged (I have seen them an inch in 
length, and broad in propoi-tion) and even tubercled.
In this monstrous form the fruit 
is usually transformed into leaves, and no seed is produced.
Vaiious intennediate states 
occur, and often only a few of the calyces become monstrous, whilst the rest of the 
plant retains the normal appearance." â€” p.

4. Atriplex erecta, Huds.
Stem most frequently erect, sometimes weak and pros- 
trate, quadrangular, striated, often reddish, 12 or 18 inches high ; branches mostly 
opposite, simple, ascending.
Leaves mostly opposite ; lower leaves ovate-oblong, wedge- 
shaped at the base, with ascending lobes, irregularly dentate, sinuato-dentate or inci- 
so-dentate ; upper leaves lanceolate or nearly linear, entire ; all pale green above, mealy 
beneath.
Spikes many-flowered, terminal and axillary, shortly branched ; flowers in 
small, round, dense clusters, usually so close as to appear continuous on the spike, in 
which respect this plant difi"ers from Atr. angustifolia.
Enlarged calyx-valves rhom- 
boidal, acute, toothed above the lateral angles, which are acute, sometimes prominent ; 
valves more or less muricated on the back, scarcely longer than the seed, densely cloth- 
ed with minute, pellucid, crystalline glands, which dry into a mealy coat.
Seed black, 
smooth, shining, half the size of that of Atr. patula.

It is probable that this plant is frequently confounded with Atr. an- 
gustifolia, which Mr. Babington says it sometimes resembles in the 
lower leaves being without teeth and the spikes being interrupted, but 
from that species " it is still clearly distinguishable by its compound 
spike, calyx-valves and leaves." He also observes : â€” 
" Our plant is certainly the Atr. erecta of Hudson and Smith, of which the only 
authentic specimen, preserved in Sir J.
E. Smith's herbarium, is apparently only the 
upper part of a very luxuriant plant ; in it the calyx of the fruit is much more spin- 
ous than is usually the case, and the panicle larger and more dense." â€” p.
8. 
5. Atriplex prostrata, " Bouch." Stem prostrate, quadrangular, somewhat striated, 
much branched, branches prostrate.
Leaves nearly opposite, fleshy, hastate-triangu- 
lar, entire or with few teeth, lateral lobes horizontal or slightly descending, the base 
288 
tnnicate, margins entire or rarely sinuato-dentate ; in the intermediate leaves the la- 
teral lobes are ascending, the base wedge-shaped, and one or two teeth are generally to 
be found above the lobes ; the uppeimost leaves are lanceolate and entire, gradually 
decreasing until they become very small nearly linear bracteas : all the leaves, as well 
as the other parts of the plant more or less clothed with mealiness.
Spikes terminal 
and axillary, numerous, slightly branched, clusters small and distinct, as in Atr. patu- 
la and angustifolia.
Valves of the calyx of the fruit cordate-triangular, often scarcely 
longer than broad, and but just covering the seed, sometimes more nearly cordate, 
rarely much elongated and with two prominent angles between the lateral ones and the 
apex.
The valves are often unsymmetrical in form, usually slightly toothed.
Seeds 
black, smooth, shining, small.

There appears to be much uncertainty respecting this plant.
None 
of the descriptions of the authors referred to exactly agree with it, al- 
though those of Wahlenberg and Drejer's Atr. latifolia come nearer 
than any others.
Mr. Babington, considering our plant to be identi- 
cal with DeCandolle's Atr. prostrata, notwithstanding the imperfect 
description, has preferred adopting that name rather than to " intro- 
duce another species into this difficult genus."

This plant is very variable in luxuriance ; in a rich soil the calyx- 
valves often take the character of leaves, and then "several sets of 
apparent calyces are found w^ithin each other, with one or more en- 
larged fruits inclosed in them." Attention must also be paid to the 
characters of Atr. angustifolia, prostrata, deltoidea, microsperma and 
rosea, in order to avoid confounding them with the present species.

9. Atriplex rosea, Liun.
Stems diS'use, procumbent or ascending, usually slender, 
square, striated, sometimes much thickened and fleshy, clothed with whitish meal in 
common with all parts of the plant, often beautifully tinged with red or purple, with 
spreading branches.
Leaves ovate-triangular, with two large, prominent, horizontal 
lobes at the base, irregularly sinuato-dentate, very white and mealy beneath ; upper 
leaves similar in general character, but with the lobes smaller in proportion and the 
leaf lanceolate : in the more fleshy plants the leaves are more triangular and less lobed, 
the upper ones being more lanceolate and nearly entire ; in a straggling much branch- 
ed form occurring on muddy shores, all the leaves are lanceolate and nearly entire, a 
few only having small basal lobes.
Clusters few-flowered, small, distinct, either col- 
lected towards the end of the stem and branches into a somewhat spicate form, each 
being subtended by a small lanceolate bractea ; or a few of the uppermost clusters only 
are bracteated, the rest being axillary ; or else the clusters are all axillary, except the 
two or three last, and all so much scattered that the spicate appearance is quite lost.
Calyx of the fruit large, rhomboidal, acute, toothed in the upper part, with a double 
series of tubercles on the back, sometimes nearly smooth, varying in outline even on 
the same plant.
Seed large, tubercularly nigose, opaque, tinged with red.

Apparently the most variable of the genus, but when once known 
easily distinguishable from all the other species.
It often approaches 
Atr. patula and angustifolia in the form of the leaves and the scattered 
clusters of flowers, and Atr. laciniata in the form of its fruit ; from all 
these the very large lobes of the leaves, the form and dentate margins 
of the calyx, and the scattered flowers will serve to distinguish it.

1. Halimus pedunculatus, Wallr.
Stem herbaceous, erect, flexuose, shortly branch-

Leaves obovate-oblong, obtuse, entire, contracted at the base into a short petiole, 
upper ones of the same form but narrower.
Flowers scattered, in a lax terminal spike, 
sessile ; as the fruit ripens the base of the calyx becomes lengthened into a long slen- 
der peduncle, the upper part taking an inversely wedge-shaped form, with two obtuse 
lobes and an acute intermediate point.

The author remarks, â€” " Can there be two spe-

Unfortunately the extreme rarity of the

2. Halimus portulacoides, Wallr.
Stem erect or ascending, woody, branched.
Leaves oblong-lanceolate, obtuse, entire, contracted below into a rather long petiole.
Flowers in smaU clusters, forming a small, branched, terminal raceme.
Peduncle ve-

The existence of two species under the name of H.
portulacoides, 
is indicated by Nees ab Esenbeck, â€” "the one, borealis, described by 
Roth in the ' Flora Germanica ' and figured by Nolte in ' Flora Dani- 
ca,' the other, australis, occurring in the South of France, and differ- 
ing from the first in habit, in the naiTower and more scaly leaves, and 
in the pointless calyces of the fruit." * Mr, Babington says â€” 
" Specimens which I possess from the south of Europe are unfortunately in much 
too young a state for the characters drawn from the fruit-bearing calyces (the only ones 
of value) to be determined.
I suspect that specimens which I gathered upon Exmouth 
Warren, in Devonshire, in September, 1829, will prove to be this latter plant ; for al- 
though the fruit, from being young, will not allow a certain conclusion to be drawn, 
yet, as far as I can ascertain, the calyx is totally without tubercles upon its back, and 
it appears to be much less rounded below than is usual in the true H.
portulacoides.
* * It is much to be wished that those botanists who may visit the southern 
coasts of Britain, would endeavour to determine the existence of the latter plant (H.
australis) upon our shores, and also that they would turn their attention to the value of 
the character drawn from the muricated calyces in the genus Halimus." â€” p.

idea that local lists of plants often prove interesting to botanists, I now send you the 
following additions to the list given by Mr. Spruce, (Phytol.

I hope my friend 
Mr. S.
will pardon the use of the more practical names of Leighton's Catalogue, in 
preference to those of Hedwig, Bridel, <*Scc.

understood if he had called his Grimmia rivularis G.

Hooker, and for Weissia fugax said W.
striata, var.

Hooker;' For the We- 
issia striata of Hooker is Bryum crispatum of Dickson, Grimmia striata of Sehrader, 
Weissia Schisti of Schwa;grichen, and the Grimmia Schisti of the ' Flora Britannica.' 
Mr. Spruce may be right, but if we carry out this plan where are we to stop ?
for so 
great is the multiplication of synonymes in this department of Botany, that it has be- 
come a matter of difficulty in some eases to decide which name ought to be adopted.

Note on Carex tenella Sfc. Perhaps you will allow mc a little room to make a 
lew remarks on Carex tenella, (I'hytol.
2.')4).
Allowing that I have made some mis- 
203 
take in relying too implicitly on Sclikuliv's figures, I must again say, without reference 
to those figures, that I am much surprized to find that after Sir W.
J. Hooker has gi- 
ven us a description of C.
teuella (which is verbatim from Smith), differing in every 
point from C.
remota, that he should ever say " may it not be, &c." But I will just 
see what Sir J.
E. Smith says on the subject.
He first tells us that his plant is the C.
tenella of Schk.
Car. 23.
t. P, p.
f. 104, exclusive of i.
k. I : he then tells us Willde- 
now and Wahlenberg refer the same plant of Schkuhr to C.
loliacea, which he says 
differs in having a ribbed fniit, flat on one side, &c., this he also tells us is Schkuhr's 
C. gracilis, 48.
t. E.
f. 24.
Then he goes on to say that it appears to him that Schkuhr 
has drawn the ripe fruit of his C.
tenella, fig.
i. k.
1, from a starved specimen of C.
lo- 
liacea, (Eng. Fl.
i. [iv.] 83).
I shall now refer to the three figures of Schkuhr, viz.
i.k.l. and see how far they represent a n66Â«i fruit, which is^aÂ« on one side.
The figures 
i. k.
1. I find, as I expected, to represent a smooth fruit, cquallt/ com^cx on each side : 
here again I am under the painful necessity of either becoming a critic, or, what ap- 
pears to me to be much worse, of believing that the starving of C.
loliacea would change 
its ribbed plano-convex fruit into fruit which is smooth, and equally convex on both 
sides.
For my own part I can no more believe that the starving of a plant will cause 
all these changes in the character, than that the starving of the soil in which they grow 
would make it produce new plants altogether.

Note on Sat/ina maritima.
Perhaps it may not be out of place here to say 
where my Sagina maritima was gathered, so fiir as Warrington is concerned, (Phytol.
179 and 234).
My first specimens are from the late Mr. E Hobson, gathered at Cu- 
redly Marsh, in July, 1824.
I have the plant from the same locality, gathered in 1840 
and 1841 by two different persons.
Again, I have Sagina maritima gathered by Mr.
G. Crozeir, three and a half miles from Runcorn Gap, nearer to Warrington.
Curedly 
Marsh, if I am rightly informed, is three and a half miles from Warrington ; Run- 
corn Gap is eight miles from Warrington.

Monograph of the British Roses.
I wish some one of your more able corre-

zling genera that can be.

Trifolium filiforme.
Having for several years past narrowly watched this 
plant, I send for insertion in your periodical, the result of my enquiries, which will not 
be thought superfluous, when, even in so late a work as Leighton's ' Flora of Shrop- 
shire,' this truly distinct species is passed by as a mere variety of T.
minus, and tlie fi- 
gure in ' English Botany,' t.l257, which is sufficiently expressive, is not at all alluded to.
I can confirm the account of this plant given in the ' English Flora ' by Sir J.
E. Smith, 
as very faithful.
The racemose inflorescence is an unfailing character, and there are 
not wanting other peculiarities by which it may be known from T.
minus, Eng. Bot.
t. 1256.
The two plants grow together near Warrington in several places, and I am 
quite satisfied that the view taken of T.
filiforme in Hooker's ' British Flora,' and es- 
pecially in Leighton's work, is erroneous.
It may easily be recognized by its more 
truly procumbent or prostrate habit, its deep yellow almost fulvous flowers and its dark 
green foliage.
The common stalk of the leaves is always very short, about half as long 
294 
as the stipules.
The corolla does not " become tawiiy as the seed ripens,'' but turns 
very pale, and owing to the narrowness of the petals, and especially of the standard 
(which is deeply eniarginate), the legume or fruit as it ripens becomes quite conspicu- 
ous ; whereas in T.
minus it is entirely covered and concealed by the faded, deflexed 
and scariose standard, twice as broad as in T.
filiforme, and furrowed.
The diligent 
observer will find other points of difference, which I forbear to enumerate.
I have 
sought in vain for intermediate states, and fully believe that the two species may be 
identified, if only a single flower of each be produced for that purpose.
Your useful 
peiiodical will, I tmst, raise up a host oi field-hotanists, who will put to the test all our 
dubious species, and point out the diagnostic characters of such as are genuine but 
imperfectly described.
These will counteract the modern epidemic termed hair-split- 
ting, which sometimes intrudes itself into your pages, and must be tolerated until per- 
sons infected with the disease have learned better.
If any of your readers suspect me 
to have now fallen into this error, let him investigate the subject for himself.

will " deceive no student,'' if he diligently explore the volume with â€”

Poa maritima and P.
distans.
These are unquestionably distinct species, but 
unless studied at large in their native haunts, apt to be confounded.
The creeping 
root of P.
maritima is not always a very obvious character.
The leaves in both species 
seem to be equally convolute ; but those of P.
maritima are destitute of the seven pro- 
minent rough ribs found on the leaves of P.
distans.
P. maritima also has the branches 
of the panicle smooth.
In favourable situations the stems are quite prostrate, yielding 
an abundant and heavy crop of herbage.
The produce of a single root will sometimes 
cover a space of more than three feet in diameter.

Potamogeton setaceum of Hudson.
It has long been my opinion that this 
plant is no other than a narrow-leaved variety of the species now called P.
oblongus.
In peat-ditches on the borders of Risley Moss, near Warrington, this plant may be 
seen in various states, from the normal form to one with extremely narrow (linear-lan- 
ceolate) floating leaves ; but when in that state the plant is sterile.
P. oblongus is 
most prolific when growing in shallow water, and its broadest leaves are produced 
when the plant is almost left dry.
In deep water it becomes P.
setaceum of Hudson.

E. Smith, in ' English Botany,' t.
1985, remarks that no one knows this plant.

Scleranthus perennis.
Never having seen this plant in a growing state, I of- 
fer with some hesitation the following remarks, which I trust some one will put to the 
test.
In habit the plant seems very diSerent from S.
annuus ; for instead of being re- 
peatedly forked, with wide-spreading divisions and flowers in the forks of the stem, my 
specimens are mostly unbranched, never dichotomous, and the flowers are terminal, the 
leaves nearly erect and directed to one side, the whole plant having much of the habit 
of Spergula nodosa ; so that if my specimens truly represent the species, they might 
be thus characterized ; â€”

Equisetumjluviatile.
There is a large patch of Equisetum fluviatile at Nor- 
wood.
A road leads down the hill from the neighbourhood of the Woodman lun to- 
wards Dulwich ; and a little way down the hill, on the right hand, a quantity of the 
soil has been dug out, so as to leave a precipitous bank ; on the acclivity of this bank, 
and about a small pond close by, the above-named plant grows in such luxuriance as 
to make a very handsome appearance.
The whorls of dark green leaves, rising one 
above the other, can only be compared to a miniature gTove of pines, growing up the 
side of some steep mountain in Germany.

In the margin of my copy of Ray's Sy-

ten as a habitat Springfield, Essex.
From the colour of the ink and style of writing 
it is evident this entry was made soon after the Dillenian edition of the Synopsis ap- 
peared.
Perhaps some of your readers, on seeing this note, will search in the neigh- 
bourhood of Springfield for this plant, which may very readily have been overlooked.

An Hour^s Botanizing among the Falls of Lawers.
I should like to call the 
attention of your readers for a few minutes to this spot, not so much for its botanical 
treasures, as for the exquisite beauty of its scenery, which is, I fear, not much known 
to tourists, in consequence perhaps of being overlooked in the guide-books.
It is, how- 
ever, well worthy of being visited by every lover of picturesque scenery who passes this 
way, and to the botanist it is a little Garden of Eden.
The principal Falls are situ- 
ated in a rocky dell embosomed in a fir-wood, a few minutes walk up from the toll-bar 
of Lawers.
Before reaching the wood a number of beautiful little cascades occur, se- 
veral of them fourteen or fifteen feet high, some of them overshadowed by graceful 
ash-trees, and all margined by verdure-mantled rocks glowing with bright blossoms, 
among which Vicia sylvatica.
Geranium sylvaticum and the " foxglove's purple bells" 
are conspicuous.
Polypodium Phegopteris and Polygonum viviparum are also here 
in abundance.
On entering the dark wood the rocks assume a wilder aspect, the roar 
of water greets the ear, and we soon come upon the principal falls, which, although by 
no means so imposing as those of Acharn, Moness or Bruar, possess a charm peculiar 
to themselves.
In the upper one the water takes four distinct leaps, and in the lower 
is precipitated through a narrow channel over a perpendicular rock about fifty or sixty 
feet high, into a dark and dismal-looking pool beneath.
The harmonious and sooth- 
ing murmur of the smaller cascades is now exchanged for the roar of the cataract, the 
light of the sun is almost shut out by the overhanging woods, and the rocks that rise 
rugged and lofty are garnished profusely by tufts of ferns, and wild flowers of varied 
hue.
The botanist will here find in great exuberance among the moist rocks the beau- 
tiful little Asplenium viride and the delicate Hymenophyllum Wilsoni.
Hieracium 
paludosum is plentiful, and Circaea alpina, Alchemilla alpina, Oxyria reniformis, Me- 
lica uniflora, Festuca ovina, var.
c. vivipara, Melampyrum sylvaticum and pratense, 
occur more or less abundantly.
In the crevices of the rocks may be gathered Hyp- 
num commutatum in fine fructification, with plenty of Bryum turbinatum and ven- 
Iricosum, Marchantia hemisphserica and the elegant Hypnum rufescens.
Bryum 
julaceum grows by the sides of the stream, and many others might be detected by a 
296 
little closer examination.
The dell all the way up is a perfect picture-gallery of sweet 
little water-falls, and an hour spent in exploring their varied beauties cannot fail to he 
pleasantly remembered in after years.
To the lover of Flora it will furnish an excel- 
lent preface to the mighty volume of Ben Lawers, of which I will say something to 
your readers by and bye ; and the first thing he should do on reaching this snug little 
inn, is to enquire for the Falls of Lawers.

Note on the British Pyrolce.
The " Enquiry respecting Pyrola media '' by 
INIr. Simpson (Phytol.
237), is one of which I should like to see many more examples.
I am persuaded the two species P.
media and rotundifolia are often confounded : with 
regard to the latter Hooker observes â€” "Yorkshire and many places in Scotland are 
assigned as stations for this plant ; but it is so often confounded with the two follow- 
ing species (media and minor), that I cannot quote them witli equal certainty." From 
what I have seen of Pyrola minor in its living state, I should think that no one could 
confound it with P.
media.
The rose-coloured, pink or nearly white, and much small- 
er flowers, and its short style and broad stigma imthout erect points, serve at once to 
distinguish it.
Pyrola media is a much stouter plant, with larger flowers, which are 
generally whitish, sometimes tinged with pink or rose, and a protruding style, which is 
almost invariably deflexed and slightly curved, seldom quite straight : the stigma is 
rightly described as having " five erect points." I have never seen living specimens 
in flower of Pyrola rotundifolia, and therefore cannot speak so confidently with regard 
to its being distinct from P.
media : from the dried specimens in my possession I can 
however say that the remarkable curvature of the style, which is considerably longer 
than that of P.
media, seems to me to render the diff"erence between the two very visi- 
ble, even at first sight.
With respect to the leaves I think it is next to impossible for 
the most acute observer to distinguish between the three species above named, until 
they are in flower.
Pyrola secunda is a very distinct species ; its ovate and serrated 
leaves and "greenish white'' secund flowers, which do not spread themselves open like 
those of the other Pyrolas, render the plant at once distinguishable.
Pyrola uniflora, 
now separated from the genus and named Moneses grandiflora, I have never seen 
except in a dried state : for many years it has not appeared in the two stations near 
Brodie House ; the other station in Moray I have not visited.
With respect to the 
distribution of the Pyrolee in the only localities with which I am particularly acquaint- 
ed, I may mention that in my opinion P.
minor is the most extensively distributed 
within the county of Moray, and next to it P.
media.
P. secunda is rather local.
In 
this district, or rather in the small part of it which I have examined, the two species 
media and minor are equally and rather abundantly distributed ; while I have not 
been able to detect more than a single patch of P.
secunda, containing about twelve 
or twenty specimens, and not in flower this season.
The only station in which 1 have 
had an opportunity of seeing P.
rotundifolia is that mentioned in the ' Collectanea for 
a Flora of Moray.' This I visited in July, 1 834 ; the plant was not then in flower.
By the way 1 would observe that the Pyrolse in general seem to flower during the 
months of June and July, not of July and August, as is generally stated.
They grow 
best in shady places, but Pyrola media is often found in heathy ground, and there it 
flowers earlier, and the flowers assume a whiter hue, tinged with more of pink or 
rose-colour.

Rhinanthus major and Crista-galli.
Some years ago having heard doubts ex- 
pressed respecting the existence of a real specific distinction between the two species 
297 
of Rhinanthus found in Britain, although I had no doubt of their being really distinct, 
I examined rather minutely a number of living specimens, and the following was the 
result of that examination.
Rhinanthus major, Rhinanthus Crista-galli.
Whole plant often immensely larger Branches few, nearly horizontal, 
than Crista-galli, generally more branch- 
ed ; sometimes smaller and not branched, 
but in every state preserving its character- 
istics.
Branches often numerous, nearly 
erect.
Calyx equal to the tube of corolla.
Calyx longer than the tube of corolla.
Corolla twice as long as calyx ; bright Corolla not much longer than calyx ; 
yellow, segments of upper lip purple, and yellow, variously spotted with purple: 
a single spot of purple on each of the side open, with segments of upper lip divari- 
lobes of the lower lip : closed, with seg- cate and somewhat revolute.
ments of upper lip connivent.
Style almost always exserted, some- Style included, 
times the sixth of an inch.
Capsule smaller, seeds fewer, with one Capsule larger, seeds more numerous, 
side thicker, and a narrow margin ; when of unifonn thickness, with a broad margin, 
fully formed bursting the skin at the thick- 
er side.
To the above observations I may add that the tout ensemble of R.
major is very dif- 
ferent from that of R.
Crista-galli, 1 mean in so far as appearance is concerned.
I 
have seen both plants growing together, and think no one who could see them grow- 
ing would consider them to belong to the same species : when dried they become quite 
black.
Rhinanthus major may be said to be rather common iu the counties of Moray 
and Nairn, at least on the coast.
In the former county I have seen it growing on an 
eminence at the height of about 200 feet above the sea, and apparently aspiring still 
higher, in defiance of Ulex europseus and other well armed and stubborn shrubs.
Its 
locality however is in corn and grass fields, where its abundance, its size, and the pro- 
fusion of its bright yellow flowers, render it veiy conspicuous.
There seems to be lit- 
tle reason to doubt that in Scotland at least it is not indigenous.

Schistostega pennata.
I enclose a few specimens of Schistostega pennata, 
which I gathered last month in Nottingham forest, where it almost completely covers 
the roof of a dry sandstone cave.
I found specimens in all stages of fructification, and 
think, from the situation in which it grew that there must be a constant succession in 
fruit.

Notes on the supposed parasitism of Monotropa Hypopitys.
It is under feelings 
of most unaffected diffidence that I venture to publish my notes on this subject, more 
especially as I find them at variance with the recorded observations of botanists so 
much more able to grapple with the question than myself.
Still, having most unex- 
pectedly become possessed of some luxuriant specimens of this interesting plant, I 
could not forego the opportunity of investigating for myself this qucestio vexata, and I 
now offer the results to the readers of ' The Phytologist.' The plants were four in 
number ; each had two or more stems, about seven inches in height, bent over at the 
top and in full flower, a few young stems were ascending in a perfectly erect position.
298 
The flowers had a scarcely perceptible scent, but the stem when broken smelled exact- 
ly like a raw potato.
Each plant had been dug up with care, and was accompanied 
by a large ball of chalky earth, the surface-mould being abundantly intermixed with 
fragments of the cones of spmce and larch firs, and the leaves of spruce fir, birch and 
whitethorn, all in a state of decay.
Each mass was penneated by roots, the majority 
of which were also decayed, but some few of them were still living, and I made them 
out to be those of a fir, a Hieracium and a scabious.
I separated the earth from each 
mass with great care ; the roots of the plants above mentioned falling from the mass 
as soon as the removal of the earth permitted of their doing so ; and although, from 
the multiplicity of fibres, many of them had obviously been in immediate contact with 
the Monotropa, there appeared to be nothing like adhesion ; and in no instance that 
I could detect was any portion of either of the roots contorted, swollen, shrunk or al- 
tered in appearance by the proximity of the Monotropa.
In order to satisfy myself 
fully on this head, T subjected each detached root to a lengthened and tedious exami- 
nation under a lens.
Having cleared the Monotropa from extraneous substances, I 
next subjected the plant itself to a rigid scrutiny.
It appeared to me to consist of 
three parts, somewhat analogous to the frond, rhizoma and roots of ferns.
The rhi- 
zoma or underground stem was fleshy, brittle, succulent and branched : the branches 
were thickly clustered, the termination or growing extremity of each being always ob- 
tuse : scattered at intervals over the surface of the rhizomata were the gemmae or 
buds destined to become fronds or ascending flower-stalks; on making a longitudinal 
section of one of these, the scales of the future frond were observable, neatly packed 
one within the other.
Those portions of the rhizoma on which these gemmse were 
most observable, were usually more detached than the rest ; and it appears that when 
a frond begins to ascend, an active formation of rhizomata commences from the same 
point, shortly forming a dense cluster somewhat difficult of examination.
Closely in- 
vesting every part of these rhizomata except the growing extremities, which, for a 
short space, are invariably naked, I found the byssoid substance which Mr. Wilson 
has suggested may be the " woolly matted extremities of grasses," (Phytol.
149) ; this 
substance I believe to be an intrinsic and most essential portion of the Monotropa, and 
is the part to which I hare applied the term root.
My reasons for supposing it a part 
of the Monotropa are these : â€” 1st.
Its constant presence ; a " byssoid fungus '' (Phytol.
43), " the woolly matted extremities of grasses " (Phytol.
149), or any other extraneous 
matter, would of necessity be irregular in its appearance.
2ndly.
The uniformity of 
its growth ; the larger end of each fibre being invariably attached to the rhizoma ; the 
branching, which is frequent, taking place at angles which are uniform among them- 
selves, and follow the normal mode in other roots ; and the distal extremities being 
extremely minute.
3rdly.
Because on viewing a thin transverse slice of the rhizoma 
under a high power, the substance of the rhizoma and that of the roots appeared per- 
fectly continuous and identical.
4thly.
That when these fibres were forcibly detached 
at their origin, a manifest rupture of the cuticle of the rhizoma took place.
These 
roots, for such I must consider them, spread freely over every substance within their 
reach.
In many instances I found them forming a beautifully reticulated covering 
to the fragments of decaying fir-cones and leaves, and also in the fissures occa- 
sionally occurring in nodules of chalk.
Sometimes they appeared closely investing 
the extraneous roots, but it is worthy of notice that I generally found these completely 
decayed : not simply shrivelled as by the exhausting power of a parasite, but in that 
state of decay in which a slight touch of the forceps would cause immediate separa- 
299 
tion.
In many instances, wlien tlie Mouotropa roots were purposely separated from the 
decayed roots, leaves, or portions of cone, their extremities remained attached to these 
extraneous substances.
The proportion of living roots to which the fibrous extremities 
of the Monotropa roots had found their way was small as compared with that of those 
in a state of decay, yet such instances did occur ; and although I used every endea- 
vour to mate out a decided continuity between the roots of the Monotropa and those 
of its supposed supporter, I relinquished the search without any proof that this occa- 
sional contact between the living roots was a matter of choice, or by any means essen- 
tial to the vitality or well-being of the Monotropa.
In candour it should further be 
remarked that in some instances the connexion between these byssoid fibres and the 
Monotropa was not fully made out ; the more beautiful examples occurring on frag- 
ments detached from the mass before the superincumbent network had been observed ; 
yet between attached and unattached fibres I detected no difference.
The conclu- 
sions at which I have arrived as to the true nature of the byssoid covering of the rhi- 
zoma having been drawn from observations made with what might be considered, in 
the present day, an imperfect instrument, I obtained the kind assistance of Mr. E.
J. 
Quekett, and by means of his superior microscope and able manipulation, the opin- 
ion which I had previously fonned of the fibres became fully established.
It is, I believe, generally admitted that many species of ferns derive part of their 
food through the decaying portions of the bark and wood of trees to which their 
rhizomata are appressed : if this be strictly parasitism, then I think it will not be diffi- 
cult to prove a like parasitism in the plant now under consideration.
If, on the other 
hand, we are to understand by the word parasitism that one plant extracts the living 
juices of another by immediate contact and positive adhesion, as in the case of the dod- 
der and mistletoe, or, as suggested by Mr. Lees in the case of Monotropa, by means 
of " hairy vesicular knobs seated on and of necessity nourished by the radical fibres of '' 
another plant, (Phytol.
99), then I must confess that I met with nothing to induce 
such a conclusion.

New locality for Carex clandestina.
I am pennitted by my brother-in-law, 
the Rev. Thomas Butler, of Langar, Notts., to state that on visiting Brean Down, 
Weston-super-Mare, in May last, he discovered Carex clandestina growing abundant- 
ly over the hill, in the same places with Helianthemum polifolium and Iris foetidissi- 
ma.
I say discovered, because I have never seen any locality quoted for C.
clandestina 
but that of St. Vincent's Rocks.
The addition of a second station for so rare a plant, 
seems a fact of much interest.

Carex axillaris and C.
remota.
These two species are readily distinguished 
from each other, as C.
vesicaria is from C.
ampullacea, by the structure of the culm or 
stem and leaves.
In C.
axillaris (and in vesicaria) the stem has three acute angles and 
the leaves are flattened : in the other two the stem is nearly round, and the leaves are 
bent at the sides so as to be almost semicylindrical.
The bracteas of C.
axillaris are 
by no means constant in their length ; in one of my Cheshire specimens the lowest 
bractea scarcely overtops the spikelet to which it is attached ; while in one gathered 
by John Martin in this county, it is twice as long as the spike.
In this species, how- 
ever, the second bractea is always very small compared with the lower one, having a 
membranous base much resembling the glumes in size and shape, the upper part rough, 
very narrow and awn-like.
All the bracteas are auricled at the base j while those of 
C. remota, instead of auricles, have generally a pale very obscure lignle, passing 
completely round the rachis or common stalk of the spike, where a striking feature 
300 
exists : â€” It is zigzag, with only two rough edges, taking a fresh direction at each 
joint, as if pushed aside by the spikelet and itsbractea; in C.
axillaris the rachis 
is perfectly straight, and has three rough edges.
The glumes in C.
axillaris are 
roundish ovate (not acuminate), tipped with a very short rough point or continuation 
of the midrib ; they are larger and whiter than those of C.
remota, which are ovate- 
acuminate and narrower than the fruit.
The lowest spikelet is generally compound in 
C. axillaris ; but I have never seen it so in C.
remota.
With the ripe fruit of C.
ax- 
illaris I am not yet acquainted ; but from what I can judge of it in an immature stage 
it must be narrower than the glumes, and the ribs on the outer side must be essential- 
ly different from those of C.
remota.
I fear your correspondent (Phytol.
263) has ano- 
ther object in view, besides asking for information.
He seems to have a particular 
fancy for severe criticism, and I am really surprized that he should advance the strange 
opinion that Dr. Goodenough was " not a very close observer of the Carices.'' The 
passage alluded to only shows that he had not at that time fully investigated the sub- 
ject.
It is surely sufficient for us to rectify the casual mistakes of our predecessors, 
without robbing them of their due meed of praise.
Again, Mr. G.
should be careful 
to quote accurately ; and it is hardly fair to quote at all the first edition of Hooker's 
' British Flora,' when in the second and subsequent editions the mistake has been cor- 
rected.
In the second edition Carex axillaris is thus described : â€” "lower bractea 
long, the rest scarcely so long as the spike." The criticism unfairly represents that 
author as standing alone in the statement that C.
axillaris is a taller plant than C.
remota.
Smith, in different language, says the same, namely, that C.
axillaris is "lar- 
ger " than remota.
I quite agree that comment on this point is needless ; and, as a 
comment, the superadded remark about the size of C.
remota is inconclusive and mis- 
placed.
If Sir J.
E. Smith were living, he would much disapprove of the use made 
of the other passage misquoted by Mr. G.
â€” Smith, no doubt, had in mind what Good- 
enough had said of the " entire capsule '' of C.
remota, and was desirous of correcting 
the mistake, in language and in a spirit well worthy of imitation by all critics.
He 
therefore mildly says of C.
axillaris : â€” " beak more deeply cloven perhaps than that of 
C. remota, though this difference is not very striking." Mr. G.
omits the important 
word " perhaps,'' and thus reduces the passage to sheer nonsense.
This is not the way 
to deal with an author, nor the way to derive (much less to communicate) instruction.
Mr. G.'s real difficulty in distinguishing C.
axillaris from C.
remota arises from his 
never having seen it.
As for the descriptions in the two works quoted, they are not 
so defective that specimens actually in my possession might not, if taken singly, jus- 
tify either of them.
I cannot see the utility of alluding to the " good authority '' of 
the source whence Mr, G.
has received C.
paniculata under the name of C.
axillaris.
If any competent botanist has thus sent it, he must have done so through mere inad- 
vertence ; and I do not think the kind intention of the donor is well requited by the 
public and somewhat sarcastic announcement of his error.

Description of Carex axillaris, (Phytol.
263).
Koot creeping, not caispitose 
(which in C.
remota it certainly is), growing in a more scattered and isolated manner 
than C.
remota, quite as much so as C.
teretiuscula compared with C.
paniculata.
â€” 
Stem from eighteen inches to two feet or more in height, rigid, comparatively robust 
and acutely triangular (its angles rough), strongly striated, nearly erect and straight.
Leaves arising from the lower part of the stem, which they enclose in their sheathing 
bases, linear, plane, though channelled on their upper surface, striated, of a bright 
light green colour, more than twice the breadth of those of C.
remota, slightly keeled 
301 
on the bacl<, the edges of their lower half smooth, of the superior part rough, about 
equalling the stem in height, gradually narrowing into slender, rough points.
Lower 
bractea foliaceous, rigid like the leaves, erect, forming as it were a continuation of the 
stem as regards its direction, generally taller than the spike, though very variable in 
this respect ; the second and superior bracteas remarkabli/ short and diminutive, nearly 
wanting in the upper spikelets, their bases expanded, then suddenly contracting and 
assuming an awn-like or capillary aspect ; all the bracteas have evident auricles.
â€” 
Spike two or three inches long, of from six to twelve ovate-lanceolate spikelets ; the 
upper spikelets simple and remarkably crowded, those in the lower part more remote, 
and the lowest of all almost always compound ; sometimes there are two or more com- 
pound spikelets on the same spike, especially in robust plants, their common rachis 
straight and triangular.
Scales membranaceous, of a brownish white colour, broadly 
ovate, equalling the fruit in breadth but not in length, bluntish, with a strong promi- 
nent green central rib or keel, which extends beyond their apex, forming a distinct and 
very evident mucro.
Fruit ovate, ribbed, with a rather broad, straight, cloven beak.
Those who doubt the specific difference of this plant from Carex remota, do so, I feel 
persuaded, from not having had a sufficient opportunity of contrasting the two plants 
in a living state.
I feel satisfied that no one who has ever witnessed, as I have done, 
these two species growing within a few inches of each other, and preserving unaltered 
their peculiar characteristic features, could be longer sceptical on this point.
Their 
habil is strikingly different, so much so as to impress upon the mind at once (without 
the necessity of having recourse to minute anatomical differences) the conviction that 
they must be essentially different plants.
The distinct and separate mode of growth 
of C.
axillaris, its robust, rigid, and nearly erect triangular stems, its broader, plane 
and channelled foliage, the remarkable disposition and comparative length of its brac- 
teas, its more numerous and larger spikelets, and their aggregation at the summit of 
the spike, are differences, I should think, amply sufficient to enable any one to distin- 
guish it, ivhen seen, from C.
remota, and to satisfy any mind that is open to convic- 
tion, and willing to acknowledge the truth of facts so plainly manifest to the most 
careless observer of the beautiful works of creation.

Love of Nature.
Ah !
it is the love of nature that burns within our bosoms ; 
the instinctive admiration of those woods, dark in shadow or hallowed by the coloured 
Iris; those cliffs now lit up in gold, or gray in twilight; those ravines whose depths 
are hidden in foliage, and into which the river plunges with sullen roar; those land- 
scapes with all their waters and all their inhabitants, that, solemnly robed in the mists 
of morning, or splendidly revealed before the setting sun of evening, with all their as- 
sociations, and all the thoughts and reflections they create and absorb, that charm, en- 
chant, and enchain us.
Whatever our avocations may be, whatever may be the object 
or the pretence with which we set out, when once under the open canopy of heaven, 
we axe free ; that machinery spreads before us in its simplicity and complexity, which 
requires no sighs, groans or anguish to keep up its movements ; and that pure brisk 
air which the country only knows, is in motion to fan our foreheads, fill our lungs and 
excite us to hope, thought and inspiration!

The Heaths.
Now it is that the different species of heaths (Erica) appear in 
their perfection of beauty, making glad the wilderness wherever they present them- 
selves.
Sandstone cliffs are empurpled with the flowers of the Erica cinerea, which 
often, too, covers the sides of mountains to a considerable height; while, wherever a 
weeping spring oozes upon the waste, the pale wax-like bells of the Erica Tetralix 
droop in clusters to the ground.
Sir Walter Scott has finely depicted in Marmion, a 
sun-rise in a mountainous country, when the heath was in flower, and the first golden 
rays fell upon the mountains â€” â€¢ 
" And as each heathy top they kiss'd 
It gleam'd a purple amethyst." 
â– * * But the mountain heather of the Scotch poets, which gives such a black 
aspect to the bleak hills of Scotland, is the ling, or common heath (Calluna vulgaris), 
whose calyx, as well as corolla, is coloured ; and whose elegant attire, generally dif- 
fused as it is in Europe, deserves every encomium it has received.
When in full 
flower, nothing can exceed the beauty presented by a near prospect of hills of bloom- 
ing heather, while they offer to the way- worn wanderer a fragrant couch, on which he 
may recline in luscious idleness, and obtain " divine oblivion of low-thoughted care." 
From the extent of moorland in Scotland, that country has been generally distinguish- 
ed as the " land of brown heath," and the clans of McDonald and McAlister bear two 
of the species as their device : hence clouds, storms, and impending dreary rocks, are 
images that unconsciously arise in our minds, when referring to the heather bells ; 
and a modern writer, when descanting upon the " moral of flowers," has exclaimed â€” 
" Since I've view'd thee afar in thine own Highland dwelling, 
There are spells clinging round thee I knew not before ; 
For to fancy's rapt ear dost thou ever seem telling 
Of the pine-crested rock and the cataract's roar.'' â€” Id.
201.
The White Water-lily.
As the rose is the queen of the bower, so undoubtedly 
is the lily the empress of the lake, and I have only done my duty in thus testifying 
my admiration, as far as she is concerned ; but I have merely sketched her figure as 
she reclines upon her liquid throne, realizing her poetical Indian name "Cumada," 
or " Delight of the Waters ; " but there seems something so emblematical of purity 
about this lovely plant, that the warning of Shakspeare not to paint it is singularly 
appropriate, and I shall not soil the fair petals of the flower by touching farther upon 
it.
â€” Id.

Wild Flowers of August.
Summer !
ah, where has summer been this year?
is often a common exclamation at its close ; for in ungenial years scarcely have we 
been able to obtain a glimpse of it, before it is already perceived waning away.
Fine 
or wet, the flowers spring and fade, and the profusion of composite or syngenesious 
ones now perceptible, gives serious warning that the summer is declining and the days 
shortening.
On the river side the tansy (Tanacetum vulgare) spreads its golden disk, 
gilding the bank ; the hawkvveeds muster numerous on the walls ; the bristly-leaved 
Picris echioides, and grove hawkweed (Hieracium sabaudum), in the woods; other 
species appear throwing a golden hue upon the aftermath of meadows, or limestone 
banks ; and the fleabane (Inula dysenterica) opens its specious disk upon the last days 
of August.
Other signs are, alas !
not wanting â€” the berries of the mountain ash are 
flushed ; those of the water Guelder-rose (Viburnum Opulus), and the Rhamnus Fran- 
gula, show their crimson beauties impending above the deep-flowing streams ; the 
willow-herbs (Epilobium) empurple the beds of rivulets and wet ditches, and the mints 
303 
are beginning to blossom.
Now tbe great mullein or hag-taper (Verbascuni Thapsus) 
shows its " flannel leaves " and lofty spike of yellow flowers in perfection, like a huge 
torch in the dusk of evening ; and others of the same species flash gloriously by way- 
sides or gardens.
In certain spots the tall dyer's weed (Reseda luteola) is very con- 
spicuous, and the starry scabious (Scabiosa arvensis) lifts its flowers of regal purple 
high in air.
The little centaury (Chironia Centaurea) named from Chiron the cen- 
taur, about this time adorns many a bank with its bright pink flowers ; and the hedges 
are over-run with the ramping fumitory, the brilliant violet clusters of the tufted vetch 
(Vicia Cracca), the pink flowers of the everlasting pea (Lathyrus sylvestris), and the 
conspicuous white bells of the great convolvulus (Convolvulus sepiura).

BOTANICAL SOCIETY OF EDINBURGH.
July 14, 1842.
â€” This Society held its last meeting for the season in the Botanic 
Garden, Professor Graham in the chair.
Various donations were presented to the her- 
barium and library : â€” from Mr. Loudon, plants collected in the South Sea Islands by 
the late Mr. Corson, surgeon ; from Miss Ferguson, seeds collected by her father in 
Sierra Leone; a box of plants from the Mediterranean, collected by Edward Forbes, 
Esq., and volumes of important works from Dr. Muller of Emmei*wick, on the Rhine, 
David Steuart, Esq., Edinburgh, and the Leopoldine Academy of Breslau.
Thanks 
were ordered to be returned to the several donors, and Dr. Muller was unanimously 
elected a foreign member of the Society.
The corresponding Secretary read a statement of the plants which had been con- 
tributed during the season, amounting, on a rough estimate, to 5,000 species, and 
25,000 specimens, many of which are rare and otherwise interesting, and he expressed 
his gratification in being enabled to say that they were generally much better preserv- 
ed than the contributions of former years.
Professor Graham next exhibited to the Society a number of rare and beautiful 
plants which had recently come into flower in the green-houses ; most of the gentle- 
men present thereafter accompanied the professor in a walk through the garden and 
greenhouses, and particularly to inspect a magnificent specimen of Caryota urens, 
which was a few days ago removed from the large green-house to the open border at 
the north end of the range.
This magnificent palm was raised in the garden from 
seed brought from Calcutta about twenty-seven years ago, and has now attained a 
height of above forty-five feet, which rendered its removal necessary, as the house 
could no longer contain it.
It is still comparatively uninjured, but will doubtless soon 
fall a victim to the cold and rough weather of our climate.
The public should there- 
fore not miss this rare opportunity of seeing a tropical palm growing luxuriantly in a 
Scottish garden â€” especially as it is much the finest specimen of the kind in Britain, 
if not in Europe.
The heaths and many other green-house plants are at present in a 
beautiful stale, and well worthy of a visit, â€” nor could the garden generally exhibit a 
more agreeable aspect than it now does.
The various papers on the list were deferred till next session.

purchased at the sale of the Botanical Museum of the late A.

Mr. Arthur Henfrey (Curator) exhibited a monstrous specimen of Scrophularia 
aquatica (which is now in the Society's Museum), found by him on the 30th of June 
last, on an island in the Thames above Teddington.
The plant was about three feet 
high, having a flat ribband-like stem rather more than half an inch broad, and scarce- 
ly an eighth thick.
The flower-stalks grew chiefly out of the flat surfaces, nearly per- 
pendicular to them, a very few only being at the edges, and not in any regular order.
These flowering stalks extended over about eighteen inches of the stem, being about 
forty in number, exclusive of a very dense cluster at the summit of the plant.
The 
flowers all appeared perfect, and the peculiarity of growth seemed to have resulted 
from a natural grafting of two plants.
Mr. George Dickie presented specimens of 
Gelidium rostratum (Harvey), collected by him at Aberdeen.
Specimens of Lastrcea 
crintata (Presl), collected at Holt, Norfolk, were presented by the Botanical Society of 
Holt ; and Mr. R.
Phillips presented some seeds from the Cape of Good Hope.
Mr.
Thomas Sansom exhibited a monstrous specimen of Cynoglossum Omphalodes (Linn.) 
in which three peduncles were united longitudinally from the base to the extremity, 
and terminated by tivo calyces, the first being 6-partite, bearing a corolla of six seg- 
ments, ^w stamens, one pistil and four seeds.
The second was 9-partite, formed by 
the union of two calyces, respectively 4 and 5-partite, bearing two distinct petals pla- 
ced side by side, each 5-lobed, each with five stamens, and each containing a pistil 
and a set of four seeds.
Mr. S.
also exhibited a specimen of Galeohdolon luteum (Sm.) 
in which the terminal petal was salver-shaped and 5-lobed ; stamens four.
A paper was read by Mr. T.
Sansom, being Notes of the first Excursion of the 
Members of the Society into Kent in June last; containing the habitats of the rarer 
species of flowering plants, and also notes on the most interesting specimens collected.

MACKAY'S SHAVE-GRASS.
Equisetum hyemale, (3.
Mackaii,* Newman.
* Named after the original discoverer, Mr. J.
T. Mackay, of Dublin.
2c 
300 
This plant occurs in the North of Ireland, more particularly in the 
counties Derry and Antrim.
It was originally discovered in the year 
1833, by Mr. Mackay, the well-known author of the ' Flora Hiberni- 
ca,' when in company with Mr. Whitla, in Colin Glen, near Belfast.
Subsequently to this date it has been repeatedly observed by different 
botanists : Mr. Moore, the talented and energetic conservator of the 
Dublin Glasnevin Gai'den, to whom I am indebted for a supply of 
both recent and dried specimens, has found it in many of the glens 
in the northern counties, particularly in Ballekavregan Glen (Derry), 
and in the wild deep ravines emphatically called "The Glens" (Antrim).
In Scotland it was first discovered in 1841, on the banks and "in what 
is usually called the bed of the river" Dee, in Aberdeenshire, by the 
Rev. Mr.
Brichan, to whose kindness I am also indebted for specimens.
Its discovery caused a multiplicity of correspondence among bota- 
nists, some maintaining that it was merely an elongate and exuberant 
form of Equisctum variegatum ; others that it was a good species, 
perfectly distinct from any which had been previously recorded as 
British.
The matter rested thus until the question was referred to Sir 
W. J.
[looker, and that illustrious botanist decided not only in favor 
of its distinctness as a species, but pronounced it to be the Equisetum 
elongatum of Willdenow, (see 'London Journal of Botany,' 42, and

lorous with the internodes : I have faithfully transcribed both of the 
original descriptions.
Moreover, on consulting Professor Vaucher's 
' Monographic des Preles,' published in the first volume of the ' Me- 
moires de la Societe de Physique, etc.
de Geneve,' I find that learned 
author has not only described at length but figured (PI.
VI.) Willde- 
now's plant under Desfontaine's prior name of Equisetum ramosissi- 
mum : the subduplicato-ramose and verticillate characters of the stem 
as well as the concolorous sheaths are well represented.
Vaucher gives 
the appropriate name of Equisetum multiforme to a species which ap- 
pears to include the variegatum of Schleicher's Catalogue and various 
other forms, among these the present plant is not distinctly charac- 
terized : his (3.
Equisetum multiforme ramosum, which, in other re- 
spects, comes the nearest, having the sheaths differently coloured.
â€” 
His description of this variety is quoted below.* 
This author, in his introductory remarks on the genus, aptly cites 
this species as an instance of characteristic liability to variation.
Af- 
ter mentioning that the Equiseta generally occur on the banks of 
streams and in damp places, as well as in the water, he says they are 
occasionally "even met with in sandy places that are not watery, such 
is the case with Equisetum multiforme : this species appears strongly 
influenced by the properties of the soil in which it grows, for some- 
times it throws out but a small number of slender and short branches, 
at other times, on the contrary, and especially when in a more fertile 
soil, we find issuing from the principal stem branches not only much 
longer but much more divided, so much so indeed that it has been 
thought it could not then be referred to the same species."t

The roots and rhizoma present no characters by which I can dis- 
tinguish this plant from that previously described as the normal form 
of the species : they are both black, the roots being tortuous, much 
divided, and often clothed with minute and matted fibrillae : the stems 
are very long, generally erect, nearly straight, and jointed as in the 
former species ; the figure shows a perfect stem divided into six por- 
tions, its size and the relative length of the 
internodes having been copied with scru- 
pulous accuracy.
Both the internodes 
and sheaths are striated ; the striae vary 
in number from eight to twelve, or even 
fourteen.
The stem is hollow, with the 
exception of the transverse septa occur- 
ring at the sheaths.
Instead of being uni- 
formly simple, as represented in the figure 
at the head of this article, it is often spar- 
ingly branched, as shown in the left hand 
figure ; the branches rise singly from below 
one of the sheaths, and a stem often bears 
two or three such branches, the branches 
themselves also occasionally emit other 
branches in the same way, the plant, in that 
case, being very luxuriant, and attaining a 
height of three to four feet : the right hand 
figure is a diagram showing the mode of 
branching.
Under the microscope the 
structure of the stem appears precisely iden- 
tical with that of E.
hyemale ; the double 
row of elevations on each of the ridges, with 
their cup- shaped depressions in the centre, 
are exactly as I have already described them, (Phytol.
278).
The 
sheaths are generally black, the central part sometimes white, but 
scarcely ever so distinctly banded as in hyemale : the teeth are very 
long, flexuous and setiform ; their edges at the base are dilated, 
membranous, somewhat whitish, and nearly transparent ; they are 
partially but not so decidedly deciduous as in the normal form of 
hyemale.
The catkin is small, nearly black, apiculate, terminal, and 
striated as in hyemale : the scales are about thirty in number.

Gathered by the late Mr. G.
Don on the Clova Mountains, as I learn 
from an original wild specimen in Mr. BoiTer's herbarium.
As the 
name originally applied to this plant by Mr. Don (but not published) 
had been previously employed by Lamarck for another plant, it has 
become necessary, in order to avoid confusion, to give a new name to 
this species.
Closely allied to A.
alpina, but usually much larger in all its parts, 
and distinguished by its leaflets not being separated down to their 
base, broader, more silky on the under side, and so placed that in the 
radical leaves the two external leaflets almost, if not quite, touch each 
other.
2. Alyssum calycinum has maintained itself for several years on 
uncultivated spots in Scotland, and is therefore possibly a true native 
of that country, although an introduced plant in England.

3. Betula glutinosa.
This is the more common species in the 
northern pai'ts of Scotland.
4. Bunium Bulbocastanum.
Plentiful in the chalky fields of Hert- 
fordshire and Cambridgeshire.
See Eng. Bot.
Suppl.
5. Carex irrigua.
I have gathered this plant upon Muckle Moss, 
Northumberland.
It is distinguished from C.
limosa by having flat 
leaves, with their margins scabrous only near the end, usually three 
female spikes, fruit without striae, and the scales of the catkins with- 
out the longitudinal green band which is seen in that species.
This 
plant is well figured in Hoppe's 'Caricologia Germanica.' It was first 
noticed in the above station by Mr. John Thompson, of Crow Hall 
Mill, near Ridley Hall, Northumberland.
6. Centranthus Calcitrapa.
This has but slender claims to be con- 
sidered as a British plant, as it has only been found in a naturalized 
state at Eltham (?) in Kent.
7. Echinospermum Lappula.
In small quantity at South wold in 
Suffolk, where it was discovered by the Rev. E.
A. Holmes.

8. Epilohium lanceolatum, (Seb.) This is the E.
montanum, var.
y. 
lanceolatum, of my Prim, Flor.
Sara., which was there considered as 
a variety owing to my supposing that the plant of Koch was the same 
as that of Sebastiani.
Bertoloni has since shown that Koch's plant 
is, as he supposed, a variety of E.
montanum, but that the true E.
lan- 
ceolatum, with which ours agrees, is a distinct species.
9. Eranthis hyemalis.
Only a naturalized species.
10.
Erysimum virgatum.
In the neighbourhood of Bath the place 
of E.
cheiranthoides is supplied by this plant.
11.
Galium insuhricum.
I look upon this as rather a doubtful spe- 
cies ; it being too closely allied to G.
Mollugo.
Found near Win- 
nander Mere several years since by the Rev. C, A.
Stev^ens.
12.
Gentiana germanica.
Stated by Dr. Grisebach to be common 
in Britain ; I am inclined to consider it only a variety of G.
Amarella.
13.
Hieracium IcBvigatum.
I am now convinced that this plant is 
not the species intended by Willdenow, but that it is the H.
rigidum 
of Hartmann and Fries.
It is found in many places.
14.
Linaria purpurea.
Only a naturalized plant.
15.
Malcolmia maritima.
In my opinion this plant has no just 
claims to be included in the list.
16.
Melissa officinalis.
Naturalized in many places.
17.
Nasturtium anceps.
A common and distinct species.
18.
Oxalis siricta.
Naturalized at Penzance, in Cornwall.
19.
Pinguicula longicornis, (Gay?).
An apparently distinct spe- 
cies, found by Mr. Jos.
Woods in a valley near Helvellyn, and caJled 
by this name, of which there is no trace in any of the works to which 
I have access.
20.
Rumex scutatus.
Near Edinburgh : a very doubtful native.
2L Scirpus parvulus.
Found in Hampshire, and probably over- 
looked in other places owing to its minuteness.
22.
Scrophularia Elirharti.
An account of this plant will be found 
in the ' Annals of Nat. Hist.' v.
1. It has been observed near Edin- 
burgh, Berwick-upon-Tweed, Preston and London.
23.
Teucrium regium.
It is much to be feared that some mistake 
has occurred in stating that this plant grows on the Blorenge, near 
Abergavenny, as the exact spot on which it is believed to have been 
gathered, has been examined carefully by a distinguished botanist, 
but without success.
24.
Trifolium Bocconi.
Found by Mr. Borrer and myself near the 
Lizard Point in Cornwall.
25.
Urtica Bodartii.
Found in Cambridgeshire, Norfolk and Essex.

Account of Botanical Excursions from Edinburgh in Autumn 1839.
By 
Robert Graham, M.D., F.R.S.E., F.L.S.
& B.S., Professor of Botany 
tn the University of Edinburgh.
One of these excursions was commenced on the 2nd of August ; 
the first plant mentioned is the rare moss Diphyscium foliosum, which 
Dr. Greville observed in great quantity and fine fruitâ€” "by the road- 
side, in many places both to the north and south of Loch-Earn-Head." 
Carex vesicaria was also found in large quantities at the head of Loch 
Lubnaig, " towards the village called Nineveh or Strath-Eyre," Dr.
Graham doubts the accuracy of the statement that the latter plant, 
with Lysimachia vulgaris and Lythrum Salicaria occur sparingly near 
Edinburgh.
Of the vegetation on the mountains beyond Milgurdy 
the author remarks : â€” 
" In general the alpine vegeUtion was found to be very scanty, except Gnaphalium 
supinum, wliich here, as on almost every mountain of considerable elevation in Scot- 
land, was abundant.
Azalea procumbens was in considerable quantity, though much 
less abundant on the Breadalbane mountains than in many other stations in Scotland.
Erigeron alpinus, Salix reticulata and Saussurea alpina were found sparingly on the 
most distant mountains which we visited.
Hieracium alpinum was also scarce, but 
more diffused.
Carex saxatilis was abundant, especially on the north side of the 
mountains below the summits, and at the base of a steep wet cliff there, Mr. M'Nab 
found Epilobium alsinifolium (?) In bogs, on the north side of the mountains, below 
the summits, we also found Juncus biglumis.'' â€” p.
20.
In their route to Catjaghiamman the party observed nothing "but 
a sparing quantity of the ordinary alpine plants, and a few fine speci- 
mens of Woodsia hyperborea, Myosotis alpestris and Veronica saxa- 
tilis," Juncus castaneus being abundant in one place.
Tempestuous 
weather prevented the party from thoroughly examining the summit 
of Catjaghiamman, of which the author observes : â€” 
312 
" I feel quite certain that this is untrodden ground, for no collector could have left 
such specimens as we gathered of Draba rupestris ; specimens many times larger than 
I erer saw before, except some which I found at no great distance on the same ridge, 
during the last visit which I paid to that district." â€” p.
21, 
On the south side of Ben Lawers Dr. Greville and Mr. M'Nab found 
the only specimens of Azalea procumbens seen on the whole range, 
except those found to the north-west of Milgurdy.
Sedum villosum 
occurred at a much greater elevation than the author had before ob- 
served it in.
Gentiana nivalis was found in considerable abundance 
at the base of the rocks j and â€” 
" Among shelving rocks, near the bottom of the hill, and to the eastward of the 
wood above Finlarig, I gathered Eriophorum gracile.
This I think certainly the plant 
indicated by Don, and figured by Smith in ' English Botany,' and it was even at a 
distance easily distinguished from Eriophorum angustifolium, among which it grew ; 
but whether it is entitled to rank as a species is quite another question.
I do not think 
it a scarce plant, at least in the north of Scotland.
I am sure I have seen it in large 
quantities in Sutberlandshire.'' â€” ^p.
22.
At Inverarnan Drs. Graham and Greville collected specimens of 
the oaks which grow there, in the expectation of finding among them 
the true Quercus sessiliflora, which the former gentleman thought he 
had seen in that locality on a former visit.
â€” 
" In spite of our receiving a shower-bath with every twig we pulled, we persevered 
as long as we saw the least chance of clearing up a doubt about the species of this most 
important genus ; but we were obliged to desist, with only a strong suspicion that my 
conclusion regarding the sessile-flowered oak was hasty.
Whatever character may be 
got for this supposed species, I fear at present that the foim of the leaf wiU yield none, 
for I certainly saw trees with leaves which I should have considered characteristic of 
Quercus sessiliflora, which nevertheless had peduncles several inches long.
It was too 
dark to judge of habit, in which also, in my former visit to this district, I conceived I 
had seen a character." â€” p.
23.
In a second excursion, during a walk by the bottom of Loch Eck 
to Kilmun, the author observed " nothing worth mentioning except a 
profusion of Carum verticillatum in almost every damp pasture," and 
a great quantity of Polygonum amphibium, var.
(3.
terrestre, in flower.
Ben More, the highest mountain in Cowal, the author found to be 
most unproductive of alpine plants ; this could hardly have been ex- 
pected, the whole country being micaceous and wet, but an inspection 
of the district explained the cause.
" The rocks are not crumbling, but present the same forbidding sharp angles as 
those we had before seen in Glen Ogle.
We got absolutely nothing worth naming in 
our ascent.
We descended by a crumbling ravine in a cliff" where eagles build, and 
313 
got there the only things worth notice.
Among these were Aira alpina, Poa glauca, 
Alchemilla alpina, Galium boreale, Saxifraga oppositifolia, S.
stellaris, S.
nivalis (three 
or four specimens only), S.
aizoides, Cochlearia officinalis, Carex rigida (very little in 
fruit), C.
pallescens, Luzula spicata, Salix herbacea, Saussurea alpina (on one spot 
only), Aspidium spinulosum in various forms, Asplenium viride, Hymenophyllum 
Wilsoni in abundance, and in moist pasture, some way up the mountain, Carum ver- 
ticillatum." â€” p.
24.
The last excursion mentioned is that by Messrs.
Brand and Camp- 
bell in September, from Edinburgh by Perth and Dunkeld to Blair 
Athol, thence to Cawdor Castle in Nairnshire.
On Craig-y-Barns, a 
hill north of the park at Dunkeld, Saxifraga umbrosa was observed 
covering acres of ground, and in some places forming the entire turf 
to the exclusion of everything else, with every appearance of being 
native ; but the presence of Hypericum calycinum and other certain- 
ly introduced plants, induced our travellers to believe that the Saxi- 
fraga had been planted there, though at a remote period.
From the 
Sow of Athol Menziesia caerulea has been nearly eradicated, only two 
plants having been found after a long search : at the foot of the moun- 
tain Carex pauciflora was abundant.
In one place by the roadside 
between Dalnacardoch and Blair occuiTed what was considered to be 
the true Arctium Bardana, a plant so distinct from A.
Lappa, that the 
propriety of sinking it as a species is questioned.
But while an old 
specific distinction might thus be restored, the travellers seem disposed 
to discard a new one : for Rumex aquaticus, found frequently near 
Cawdor Castle, on being examined in different situations, was thought 
to " shade away towards, if not into, Rumex crispus." Among other 
good plants abounding in the Cawdor woods were Rubus saxatilis, 
Goodyera repens and Trientalis europaea ; the latter is sometimes of 
" remarkable size ; Mr. Stables having one plant whose branches, 
spread out, measured about one foot square." Lapsana pusilla and 
Loliura temulentum were observed near Elgin, usually among wheat.
" Mr. Gorrie has been the first to discover Orobus niger in the Pass of Killiecran- 
kie, scattered over a piece of ground in the coppice wood, at least twenty yards across, 
and far removed from any cultivated ground." â€” p.

Observations on a Metamorphosed Variety of Antirrhinum majus.
By 
Herbert Giraud, M.D., Member of the Council of the Botanical So- 
ciety.
" The general growth and habit of this plant corresponded with its normal condi- 
tion, and the stems, leaves and sepals answered to their specific characters.
But the 
petals, with the other parts of fructification, existed in a state of very singular trans- 
formation, â€” affording a striking illustration of the great doctrine of morphology, â€” 
314 
that the organs of reproduction, with their appendages, are but metamorphosed leaves.
* * The points in which this plant departed from its normal condition, appear 
to be these: â€” The corolla, instead of being petaloid, irregular, five-cleft and brightly 
coloured, was leafy, regular, in five deep segments, of a green colour.
The stamens, 
which should have been didynamous, were here absent.
The ovarium, from being 
two-celled, became five-celled ; the stigma five-cleft, instead of bifid ; and the style 
hollow, instead of being solid.
" The quinary condition of the ovarium, and the alternation of its carpels with the 
divisions of the corolla, is a state which would be expected to follow any alteration in 
the number of its cells, with an accompanying tendency to assume regularity in its de- 
velopment ; as the quinary arrangement is that which prevails in dicotyledons.
The 
supernumerary carpellary leaves, of which the ovarium is composed, are obviously those 
which, under the normal condition of the plant, would have gone to the formation of 
stamens.
That they are developed from the next whorl of leaves to the corolla is 
plain, from their alternating with its divisions.
Now, in the normal condition, the 
stamens would be so situated ; one leaf, however, in the whorl is altogether abortive, 
â€” forming neither a stamen nor a carpel ; for the carpellary development of this would 
produce a six-celled ovarium.
The abortion of stamens in the natural family Scro- 
phularineae (to which this plant belongs) is by no means unfrequent." â€” p.
27.
This case of metamorphosis is remarkable as presenting an instance 
of changes proceeding in opposite directions in the same flower ; â€” 
1. from centre to circumference, the bright-coloured irregular corolla 
having been converted into five equal, green, leafy segments, clothed 
with glandular hairs, like the calyx : 2.
from the circumference to the 
centre, the stamina taking the form of carpellary leaves.
The former 
of these changes is considered by the author to disprove an opinion 
expressed by Dr. Lindley, that transformations of the reproductive 
organs " always take place in the order of development, or from cir- 
cumference to centre ; that is to say, that the calyx is transformed 
into petals, the petals into stamens, &c., but that the converse does 
not occur r 
IV.
On the British Species of Fumaria.
By Charles C.
Babington, M.A.
F.L.S., F.G.S., &c.
Mr. Babington, in a paper read before the Society on the 12th of 
May last, has entered more fully into the specific distinctions of Fu- 
maria parviflora and other allied species of the genus, (Phytol.
239) ; 
we therefore think it better to defer our analysis of the present paper 
until the publication of the second in the Transactions.
V. On Systematic .Arrangement in the Formation of Kaiural-History Collec- 
tions.
By William Brand, C.S., F.B.S.
Believing that nothing has been created without an object, the 
315 
author also imagines " that all things exist according to a suitable ar- 
rangement, the laws or conditions of which may, in some measure, be 
ascertained by a well-directed investigation," the first requisite for 
which is such an acquaintance with the various objects as will enable 
the enquirer " to recognise and identify them wherever they appear." 
This knowledge can be gained only "by studying the features of each 
individual," and can be applied only by the several individuals being 
characterised, so that each may be distinguished from all others of its 
class.
This may be termed " the process of separation or disjunc- 
tion ; and an object thus discriminated is termed a species.^'' 
The author then briefly treats of " the process of combination^'' by 
which species are formed into genera, these again into other groups, 
and so on, until all the objects in any kingdom of nature are classed 
under a few grand divisions.
These groups, being but interrupted 
links, " where nature probably exhibits a continuous chain," must be 
to a certain extent artificial, a separation into species or individuals 
being the only real classification indicated in nature.
The author 
meets the objection that naturalists "waste their time and energies 
upon the external character and appearance of objects, instead of ap- 
plying themselves to ascertain their relationship, properties and uses," 
â€” by remarking that the former is an indispensable preliminaiy to the 
successful prosecution of a higher course of research, to the pro- 
motion of which a still farther advance must be made, " namely, to 
ascertain the range or distribution of species, with their relative con- 
dition, and other attendant circumstances in any different region of 
the globe." 
" Now, in prosecuting such an investigation, I consider it necessary to commence 
by mapping out, or dividing the surface of the globe into appropriate sections ; then 
to ascertain the various productions which occur in each, with the circumstances at- 
tending them ; and lastly, to register the information thus acquired, in such a way as 
to afford a ready and comprehensive view of these productions, both as they exist in 
any one section, and as they stand relatively to those of other sections." â€” p.
41.
In forming these sections, although no abrupt or decided change 
in their productions may be occasioned by topographical influences, 
yet may certain lines be traced whereby such changes are indicated ; 
such lines would form appropriate boundaries for the sections.
Thus 
the ridge of a moimtain chain, a table-land, or the channel of a great 
river, may sometimes be properly chosen as a sectional line, especially 
when the former regulate the water-sheds or sources of streams flow- 
ing in opposite directions.
The sections should be so limited in ex- 
tent that all the important changes occurring in the productions of a 
316 
district may be exhibited, while they should " not be so numerous as to 
render definite limits unattainable, or otherwise obstruct the scheme 
in its practical working." The author observes that " any mode of 
division adopted must always be liable to controversy," but that he 
himself believes "about 110 sections would suffice for the proposed 
object." 
" This object being accomplished, the next requisite for ascertaining with accura- 
cy the productions of the earth, is to procure specimens of these from every section 
wherein they occur, along with full particulars relative to their condition ; and to re- 
cord those particulars in such methodical array as to make them directly available for 
the purpose intended.
To carry on this process efficiently, however, I ccmsider it es* 
sential that the information should be registered immediately on being obtained, or at 
least as soon thereafter as possible, both that the rapid accumulation of objects in a 
general collection may not interrupt the regularity of procedure ; and because I con- 
ceive that a material saving of labour will always be effected by disposing of these ob- 
jects at once, and singly as they occur." â€” p.
42.
Mr. Brand considers that the best mode of rendering Natural-His- 
tory collections easily available, is to record the species in a tabular 
form under an alphabetical arrangement, employing certain simple 
signs or marks to indicate all the information obtained respecting them.
The author is of opinion that the adoption of this mode of arranging 
and registering all known facts and circumstances connected with ob- 
jects of Natural History, must eventually lead to the highest practical 
results.

Communicated 
by the President.
The fossil which is the subject of the present paper "was found in 
a mass of bituminous shale, from the coal strata which are exposed 
along the coast at Granton." The specimen here described and fi- 
gured is the only one met with during a long-continued series of re- 
searches in the locality wherein it occurred ; and it appears to con- 
stitute an entirely new fossil genus.
At first sight the figure (which is of the natural size) appears to 
represent about three inches of the lower part of a catkin of Typha 
angustifolia, attached to a portion of the stem.
On a closer inspec- 
tion, however, it is seen to differ materially from the fertile catkin of a 
Typha, for in that genus there is no other floral envelope than the 
hairs surrounding the pedicel of the pericarp ; whereas on the expo- 
sed surface of the fossil are four longitudinal series of bodies, each of 
317 
which, in the accompanying magnified views, is seen closely to re- 
semble a four-leaved calyx.
Another point in which the fossil differs 
from Typha is that on the stem, about an incb below the catkin, we 
observe a scar apparently indicating the spot whence a leaf or spatha 
had fallen, or where a branch had been broken off ; now there is no- 
thing of this kind in Typha.
It therefore became necessary to seek 
in some other genus for the living analogues of this fossil, and these 
are apparently furnished by several species of Pothos, a genus belong- 
ing to the natural order Aroideae, and characterized by having a one- 
leaved spatha, and a simple cylindrical spadix covered with flowers, 
which have a four-leaved calyx, no corolla, four stamina, and bear a 
4-seeded berry.
These characters will be found to apply nearly to 
the fossil, making allowance for " the compression it has undergone, 
and the change of appearance produced by its mineralization." 
" The greatest number of the species of the genus Pothos are parasitic, and inhabit 
the vast forests of tropical countries.
In some of the species, also, there are truncated 
fleshy scales on each side of the germeu, and which, in the young state, completely 
cover the male organs of the plant ; these are especially conspicuous in P.
acaulis.
â€” 
The similarity of the habitats also favours the idea of its belonging to this class of 
plants." â€” p.

The author enters at some length on the mode in which the differ- 
ent carboniferous strata have been deposited, and explains the process 
of formation of fossil fuel in the present era, as observed by travellers 
in America.

Read, Extracts from a Letter addressed to Dr.
Greville, from R.
J. Shuttleworth, Esq., Berne, dated 11th September, 
1839, containing " Observations on Diatomaceae." After some obser- 
vations on Gomphonema, Meridion, Diatoma, &c., the author says â€” 
" I have no doubt as to the non-animal nature of these and analogous genera ; for 
though I have examined, I may say, tens of thousands of individuals of most of them, 
I have never observed the slightest trace oi spontaneous motion or action.
The motion 
of Oscillatoria is perfectly mechanical, caused by the rapid development of each suc- 
cessive cell or joint; and an analogous motion, though merely caused by separation of 
each joint, is common in Diatoma." â€” p.
53.
Mr. Shuttleworth passed " eight days on the Grimsel, the hospice 
of which is 6400 feet, or thereabouts, above the level of the sea ; " he 
wished to ascertain if Diatomeee exist in the alpine waters, which are 
scarcely above the freezing point.
31S 
â€¢' I found that every pool or stream was full of them and Infusoria, and even the 
Scytonema that covered the rocks several hundred feet above the hospice, and over 
which the snow-water trickled, served as the habitation or matrix of Synedra lunaris, 
Ehrenh.
(Exilaria, Auct.) a true Diatomea." â€” p.
54.
The author enumerates many of the species found here, several of 
which were quite new : he also details the results of an examination 
of " the Red snow quite fresh^'' which, to his astonishment, he found 
composed of Protococcus nivalis {Ag. not Grev,), P.
nebulosus, Kutz, 
three or four deep red and two uncoloured Infusoria ; " the Infusoria 
were endowed with the most astonishing activity of motion." 
" The coloured snow was collected in a bucket, and then allowed to melt, when the 
colouring matter was deposited, and immediately examined; but hardly had the wa- 
ter acquired the temperature of the air, than all life ceased, and the Alga was only to 
be distinguished from the Infusoria, by its greater transparency and lighter colour.
The proportion of the Alga (Protococcus nivalis) to the Infusoria was about 5 or 6 to 
1000 of the latter.
That this is always the case I do not believe, as Haematococcus 
Noltii is always mixed with a brown Stentor, which latter varies in its proportion much.
The Protococcus nivalis of the Grimsel is the same plant as that figured by Agardh, 
in the ' Icones Alg. Europ.' tab.
21, f.
a. The sporules, or rather the contents of the 
plant, are merely grumose, and the granules are so small, as to be even inconspicuous 
with a power of 300 diameters, whereas in Hamatococcus Noltii (to which your spe- 
cies of red snow is closely allied) the granules are large, and few in number.
The 
Protococcus nebulosus, Kutz., is a simple, very small, grey or uncoloured globule, 
which abounds everywhere, and as, from mechanical causes, it is attracted round the 
globules of red snow (Alga and Infusoria), it is certainly the cause of the gelatinous 
appearance of the substratum, described and figured by many authors, which however 
does not exist in our Swiss plant.
The colouring matter of the red snow extends to 
the depth of eight inches at least below the surface; it is only found on old snow of 
some years standing probably, and only developes itself during warm weather and a 
southerly wind.
This snow is also always more or less covered with minute particles 
of humus; and I regret that the state of the weather did not permit me to examine 
the humus immediately below the snow.'' â€” p.

pendrium vulgare, gathered at Auchmithie in Forfarshire.
I'he most 
frequent form is that with a simply bifid termination ; one specimen 
is three-cleft ; in others the midrib being divided near the base "forms 
a frond with two branches, nearly at right angles with each other ;" in 
another specimen the frond is much branched at the extremity ; then 
again some have a rounded termination, the midrib not reaching to the 
end, and other fronds have a circular form ; the edges of some fronds 
319 
are firalariated, of others crenated ; and in one remarkable variety the 
frond is much thickened, and the veins are more distant than usual, 
" there being about one-third only of the usual number in a given 
space."

Stevens, Kent, on Scrophularia aquatica of Linnaeus and of Ehrhart.
The author, considering the plants of the above authors to be distinct

Ehrharti, and thus characterizes them.
" S.
aquatica, Linn.
Leaves cordato-ovate, very obtuse, crenato-serrate, lower ones 
auricula te; lateral cymes corymbose, many-(8 â€” 15)-flowerecl; sterile filament reni- 
form, nearly round, entire ; capsule ovate, ratber acute.

near, obtuse, entire.

Dr. W.
B. Clarke read a communication on certain pro- 
perties existing in Tilia europaea, Linn.
The author observes that 
" this plant is remarkable for the immense quantity of mucilage con- 
tained in the bark, and for the manner in which the cellular tissue in- 
volving it is arranged w^ithin the meshes of the ligneous tissue." The 
mucilage exists in a nearly solid form, but is soluble in water ; the 
spaces in the woody fibre of the inner bark containing the cellular tis- 
sue appear to be formed " by the cohesion of the woody tissue in cer- 
tain parts, and its separation in others, to such an extent, that by the 
gradual and lateral distension of the earlier layers of the liber in the 
exogenous growth of the tree, certain spaces are made to intervene 
between the reticulations of the woody fibre, which are gradually fill- 
ed up by the development of cellular tissue." A transverse section of 
a branch exhibits these spaces so disposed in the bark as to present 
" a series of little conical figures, with their bases towards the circum- 
ference of the bark, and their apices in communication with the me- 
dullary rays, which traverse the wood of the stem." 
The author describes the mode of preparing this vegetable mucus 
from the bark.

Read, Observations on Gentiana Amarella, Linn., and G.
germanica, Willd.
; and on Pyrola media, Sm.; by P.
J. Brown, Esq., 
Thun.
The author states his belief that the much-controverted ques- 
tion of the specific identity or distinctness of the two Gentians is yet 
far from being settled ; and " that it never can be set at rest in the clo- 
set, or in any other way than by the continued examination of both 
plants in a living state, and in their native abodes." 
" Smith, in his ' English Flora' (under G.
Amarella), says that G.
germanica, W.
' may be a good species, but has not yet been observed in England.' Grisebach, the 
latest and best authority for the Gentianeae, has England or Scotland as the country 
of every variety of Amarella, and near Ripon as a habitat of germanica.
His distinc- 
tions and descriptions, although apparently available upon paper, will not, however, 
stand the test of the field, as they fluctuate within the limits of probable variation, as 
may be judged to be likely when he has four states of each species.
Minor distinc- 
tions being set aside, there seems to be little more left than G.
Amarella, ovarium and 
capsule sessile, calyx-lobes lanceolate, obtuse, though variable ; G.
germanica, ovarium 
and capsule stipitate, calyx lobes ovato-lanceolate, acuminate.
It is true that in his 
characters, he calls the tube of the corolla of Amarella cylindrical, and of germanica 
' sensim ampliata ; ' but in his descriptions he calls them both obconical.
Every dis- 
tinction he makes depending on size, form, or proportion of parts, may be found here 
in the space of a few square yards equally applicable to the one as to the other, our 
plants varying from two inches to two feet, from quite simple, with one flower, to very 
much branched, with from 150 to 200 flowers ; leaves broad and narrow, blunt and 
pointed, much more distant from each other than their own length, or quite the re- 
verse ; the calyx-lobes, which are avowedly inconstant, vary as much as the other parts, 
and the question is nearly reduced to the sessile or stipitate ovarium, and capsule.
Now, although our plants are, at least in my opinion, decidedly Grisebach's G.
ger- 
manica, I do not find the stipitate ovarium, and am inclined to suspect it may be 
a delusory appearance, arising in the following manner.
* * * The 
lower third of the ovarium being destitute of seeds, and at the same time fleshy 
and succulent, I suspect that when gathered in an early stage of flowering, or later if 
much pressed and dried very quickly, the ovarium shrinks uniformly in drying, and 
has the sessile form attributed to Amarella ; but that when in a more advanced stage, 
particularly if dried slowly under slight pressure, the substance of the swelling seeds 
keeps the upper portion of the ovarium expanded, while the lower empty succulent 
part shrinks and produces the stipitate form of germanica." â€” p.
69.
The author observes that his attention was drawn to the subject too 
late in the season to pursue the inquiry satisfactorily ; he suggests that 
botanists should study these plants " from the commencement to the 
end of their flowering season, drying specimens at stated intervals of 
about a fortnight, and noticing the form of the ovaria in the living and 
dried states." In this recommendation we most heartily concur, and 
should be glad to learn the results.
Mr. Babington's opinion on G.
germanica is recorded in the present number (Phytol.
310).
321 
The author's idea relative to the ovarium of Gentiana germanica, 
was suggested by his observations on Pyrola media, which appears to 
be a rare plant in Switzerland.
In June, 1838, the author chanced 
to find a tolerable supply about five miles from Thun.
The plants 
agreed pretty well with the characters given, except that the style 
instead of being club-shaped was decidedly cylindrical.
In the pro- 
gress of drying however this difficulty was explained " by the conver- 
sion of the cylinders into clubs," whereby the character most insisted 
on was shown to be false.
" The styles, which are considerably elongated, and although declined, are scarcely 
curved, have a diameter at least twice that of P.
rotundifolia, and are very succulent, 
being furnished with a stout ring at the apex, as in the last-named species.
In the 
individuals gathered while the flowers were yet young, the rigidity of this annular 
protuberance prevented the summit of the style from shrinking, and it consequently 
became club-shaped when dry ; but in those which were further advanced, the ring 
having become more or less flaccid, it ceased to afford the same resistance, and the 
styles remained nearly cylindrical, although shrunk to half their original thickness.
This view is now confirmed by British specimens in my herbarium.
One from Eng- 
land, gathered when the plaut was coming into flower, has a style nearly triangular ; 
the other six, from different Scottish stations, are all in fruit, and have all the styles, 
excepting one, cylindrical, and that one not far from being so.'' â€” p.

Dr. Herbert Giraud read a paper " On the Existence of Nitrogen 
in Plants, considered with reference to their development, and to their

tions of nitrogen in the constitution of organized beings, and that it 
" appears to be the most essential element of organization." That all 
the tissues of plants contain nitrogen, is shown by the experiments of 
the author, as well as by those of Boussignault, Pay en and Rigg; 
who have also proved " that vegetables have the power of deriving 
that element from the atmosphere." The proportion of nitrogen 
varies from about three to five per cent.
Speaking of M.
Boussig- 
nault's researches the author remarks : â€” 
" The results of his experiments have shown, that the proportion of nitrogen in any 
vegetable tissue or organ, bears an intimate relation to the activity of the vital func- 
tions with which the tissue or organ is endowed.
Thus, in that part of the seed in 
which germination commences, nitrogen predominates.
Seeds also, which germinate 
most readily and most rapidly, contain the largest quantity of nitrogen.
With regard 
to woody structures, it appears that the alburnum, which greatly exceeds the heart- 
wood in the activity of its functions, contains by far the largest proportion of nitrogen.
Those timbers also, which grow most rapidly, contain the largest proportion of nitro- 
gen." â€” p.

I, â€” On the Development of the Vascular Tissue of Plants.
By Edwin J.
QUEKETT, F.L.S., B.S., &c.
Mr. Quekett commences his paper by commenting on the difficul- 
ties attendant on the enquiry ; and observes that he believes the idea 
to be in great measure correct, that " in structure vessels differ but 
little from cellular tissue, and that the elements of which the latter is 
formed are only altered and converted to fulfil a different function in 
the former, and that the development of the one will more or less cor- 
respond to that of the other." He then proceeds to give the views of 
Schleiden, Raspail, &c., and alludes to the opinion of Mirbel, Trevi- 
ranus and Slack, that the membranous tube of a vessel is formed firom 
a number of cells ranged end to end, their connexions being ultimate- 
ly absorbed, thus causing the production of a continuous cylinder in- 
stead of several separate cavities.
Pursuing this idea the author thus 
proceeds : â€” 
" I must state that in many instances I have met with arrangements of cells in 
such a way as would lead one to suspect that this was the true origin of a vessel ; and 
it is a curious fact that cells adhere end to end much more strongly than they do side 
by side ; therefore, when disturbed, they appear more frequently in strings than in other 
forms : but I believe no one has ever seen the fact farther than here described, or fol- 
lowed out the complete development of a vessel from this condition of cells ; and there 
is one fact presently to be mentioned, connected with the development of a vessel, 
which entirely disproves this theory." â€” p.
3. 
In order to watch the development of the membranous tube of a 
vessel, Mr. Quekett recommends that some part of a plant in a nascent 
state, as a bud or bulb, should be selected for examination ; he also 
lays great stress on the necessity there is for caution in making dis- 
sections of recent paits in order to witness the appearances which he 
subsequently describes.
The author then details observations for the 
most part confirmatory of Schleiden's views, as explained by that 
writer in his memoir on Phy togenesis, a translation of which appeared 
in the ' Annales des Sciences Naturelles,' (tom.
xi.
Botanique) : he 
continues : â€” 
" When the young vessels are recognized (which by experience becomes an easy 
matter, even in parts considerably developed, though not so at first), they appear as 
pellucid glassy tubes, with a cytoblast in some part of their interior ; earlier than this 
they are not to be recognized readily from cells.
As they grow older the cytoblast di- 
minishes, and the contents, which at first were clear and gelatinous, become less trans- 
parent from containing thousands of granules, which are too small to allow of the 
passage of light, and consequently appear as dark points ; these atoms are about the 
55505 of an inch in diameter, and have the motion known as " active molecules." If the 
vessel be wounded at this period the gelatinous contents pour slowly out, and then the 
2d2 
324 
singular movetneiits of these molecules are still more clearly seen.
These atoms, from 
their freedom of motion, are arranged indiscriminately in the interior of the vessel, but 
in a short time some of them enlarge, and then transmit a little light, which, on ac- 
count of their minute dimensions, is not suffered to pass as a white pencil, hut is de- 
composed in its course, the granule thereby becoming of a greenish hue.
The granules 
exhibiting this greenish hue are now in a fit state to enter into the composition of the 
fibre that is to exist in the interior of the membranous tube, and in a spiral vessel this 
is the manner in which this act is accomplished.
" The granules which are in active motion in the viscid fluid near one of the ends 
become severally attracted to the inner wall of the vessel, beginning at the very point; 
those granules first attracted appear as if cemented to the spot, by the viscid fluid in 
that direction losing some of its watery character, for there appears a string of a whit- 
ish colour, besides granules, in the line which the fibre is to occupy.
As the other gra- 
nules are attracted to those already fixed in an inclined direction, the spiral course is 
soon to be seen, and the same action progressively goes on from the end it began to- 
wards the other, avound the interior of the tube in the form of a spiral ; the fibre being 
produced, like a root, by having the new matter added continually to the growing point, 
thereby causing its gradual elongation.
" This action is not throughout the vessel at the same instant, for I have witnessed 
a vessel having one half laid down with fibre, and in the other part the operation had 
not been commenced.
When the granules have arranged themselves throughout the 
whole length of the tube, those which were first deposited, and had then some slightly 
visible space between them, have by this time been reinforced by others or nourished 
by the contents of the vessel, so that that space is obliterated, the fibre beginning to 
assume a thread-like shape with defined borders, and sufiiciently large to allow of the 
transmission of white light.
When this same action has progressed throughout the 
entire vessel, the transparency begins to be restored, and what is singular, the entire 
mass of granules has completely disappeared, appearing as if the exact number and no 
more had been generated to form the fibre.
After the vessel has reached maturity, the 
liquid contents themselves become absorbed, as happens in the cells of the pith, and the 
vessel is then empty ; and probably from being seen at difierent periods of its existence 
in these difiierent states, sometimes full and at others empty, may account for the dis- 
crepancies existing among botanists as to the functions these vessels perform." â€” p.
5. 
It appears scarcely necessary to follow the author through the re- 
marks which succeed the passage above quoted ; a summary of his 
views on the direction of vegetable fibre, will, however, we trust, be 
highly acceptable to physiological botanists.
" It appears to me that the only theory capable of explaining the direction of the 
fibre, is one that will apply to some peculiar laws existing between the granules them- 
selves and between the granules and the vital force residing in the vessel or cell in 
which they are contained.
There can be no doubt that at first the granules are in the 
jelly, consequently as they become sufficiently developed they acquire freedom of mo- 
tion, and attraction commences between the wall of the cell and the granules, and it 
can be easily imagined how these numerous atoms may be induced to approach to the 
circumference of the vessel, but the diflBculty of the proposition is to account for their 
doing so in a spiral or other determinate form, and always of the same figure in the 
sartic situation in the same plant.
325 
" Some part of the law, I believe, is made tolerably clear, viz., that fibre is com- 
posed of granules arranging themselves lite beads on a string, which become nourish- 
ed by the contents of the vessel until a perfect thread is the result, and the direction 
this takes seems to me to be the result of some special power residing in the vessel 
under the control of the whole plant, probably electrical ; and which is modified in the 
several vessels I have enumerated : farther than this I believe we cannot go, though 
nature occasionally alters forms, she seldom varies much in her laws, but what these 
may be it is forbidden the eye of man at present to detect, and they appear to me, 
though operating in such minute spaces, to be stamped with as much permanency of 
power in the formation of these curious and elegant organs, as those laws on a grander 
scale are in the fashioning of our owii frame, or in the maintaining of the stability of 
the universe." â€” p.

â€” On certain Phenomena observed in the genus Nitella, as illustrative of 
the peculiar structure recently discovered by Mr. Boiverbank, in a Fos- 
sil Wood from the London Clay.
By Arthur Farre, M.D., F.R.S., 
&c.
Dr. Farre's paper on Nitella is highly interesting, as illustrative, in 
some degree, of appearances previously detected in fossil wood by Mr.
Bowerbank.
The author had procured some specimens of Nitella 
flexilis for the purpose of observing the circulation of the sap : up to 
the 4th of April this was going on vigorously, but two days afterwards 
it had entirely ceased, and certain green particles, previously lining 
the interior of the stem, had shrunk from the parietes, and, together 
with the green circulatory matter, was collected in iiTegular masses 
within the tube.
Five days afterwards Dr. Farre found that in many 
of the joints these irregular masses had resolved themselves into glo- 
bular bodies of a brown colour, the tubes being left as transparent as 
glass, and the brown globules appearing as an irregular row of beads 
in the interior.
In almost all the globules was a cup-shaped depres- 
sion, generally so situated as to face the surface of the tube in the cen- 
tre of the depression : a small collection of brown gi'anules, of about 
uniform size with the globules of circulation, was always present.
The brown bodies, on being torn open, were found to consist of a 
very thin investing capsule, filled with the green granules of the plant 
mixed with mucous fluid.
" It appears then that this remarkable change had taken place within a week after 
the circulation had been observed to be going on vigorously in the plant.
And the 
nature of the change appears to be this.
The green granules which line the internal 
surface of the living joints desert the parietes, and, together with the green circulating 
granules of the interior collect together in irregular masses in the centre of the tube, 
which then resolve themselves into irregular spheres, still retaining the granular out- 
line indicative of their formation by aggregation, but which they afterwards lose on 
326 
assuming a more perfect spherical form, and become bounded by an investing capsule, 
which turns of a rich brown colour, while the contained granules retain their original 
green.
"It is difficult to imagine what purpose is intended to be answered by such a change 
taking place after all circulation and other evidences of life in the plant have ceased.
Yet the idea of such a change being the result of a merely fortuitous arrangement of 
the component particles of the plant attendant on decomposition, is negatived by the 
circumstance of the remarkable unifonnity and symmetry of the resulting globules, 
which appear to possess the most defmite characters, differing from each other only in 
size.
Nor is the change by any means uniform for the whole plant ; for in some parts 
two of the joints were observed to be in the green state, while the joint situated be- 
tween them was free from green matter and contained the brown bodies : but this 
might have resulted from the circulation ceasing earlier in the central joint, and con- 
sequently allowing more time for the changes to take place."â€” p.

Mr. Quekett cites many interesting examples of hygroscopic pro- 
perties as exemplified in Mosses, Lycopodium lepidophyllum, the 
seed-vessels of Epilobium, Mesembryanthemura, Rhododendron, Ge- 
ranium, Banksia, Hura, Avena fatua &c.
He then details the struc 
ture of the capsule of Cerastium, which we give in his own words.
*' Let us take, for example, the capsule of some plant of the order Caiyophyllese, as 
Cerastium, and it will be found that when that organ approaches maturity, the apex, 
which was pointed and entire, will open by splitting into five equal valves, which curl 
outwards, making one complete coil, and always in the same direction ; by the appli- 
cation of moisture the valves will resume their original position, and when dry take on 
the curled fonn again.
" If one of these valves be examined it will be found to be thin and diaphanous 
where it forms part of the body of the capsule, but where it is hygroscopic it is horny 
and opaque.
When a section taken from the edge of the valve or curled part longi- 
tudinally is examined by the microscope, it will be found that the tissues will be dif- 
ferent on the exterior and internal surfaces, both however cellular ; but the inner layer, 
or the cells of the convex border, are of different dimensions from the outer, being nei- 
ther so large nor having so thick walls, (though they are thicker than ordinaiy cells) ; 
whilst those of the outer layer are almost solid, and the only cavity they have is indi- 
cated by thin spaces between a series of lines, the chief one of which is in the direc- 
tion of the longer axis of the cell, the others connected to it at right angles.
These 
cells are of most curious structure, and form an interesting object for the vegetable 
anatomist.
" In this arrangement of parts it must be evident that by the shrinking of the tis- 
sues of the seed-vessel by loss of moisture, there will occur unequal contraction, and 
that side will be curved which contracts the most forcibly, and by this curvature one 
valve must necessarily be removed from the next, evidently showing that the tissues 
act as unequal antagonists to each other.'' â€” p.

Mr. Quekett gives numerous instances in which the great end of 
527 
disseminating the seeds of plants is accoraplislied by the hygroscopic 
properties of their tissues.
The subject is one of much interest, and 
well worthy the attention of the student of nature.
In pursuing the 
enquiry he will almost invariably j&nd the means so admirably adapt- 
ed to the required end, that not only would it be impossible for human 
ingenuity to devise an improved plan, but the plans adopted by na- 
ture often offer us models and exhibit combinations which have sug- 
gested some of our most apt and useful applications of mechanical 
power.

â€” The process of charring Vegetable Tissue as ctpplied to the examina- 
tion of the Stomata in the Epidermis of Garden Rhubarb.
By the 
Rev. J.
B. Reade, M.A., F.R.S.
The Rev. Mr.
Reade's paper on charring vegetable tissue appears 
to be of great importance, as tending to settle the mooted question of 
the existence or otherwise of a membranous covering to the stomata 
of vegetables.
The author's conclusions are these : â€” 
" That in the simple unchaiTed state of the semitranspaieiit tissue there is much 
room for difference of opinion, so that the eye, fortified by a little previous theory, 
might most pardonably see the stomata either open or closed.
" That the application of the process of charring proves, beyond a do"ubt, that the 
stomata in this tissue of the rhubarb are distinct openings into the hollow chambers 
of the parenchyma of the leaf.
" That the perforation is the rule and not the exception in the structure.
" And that the exception, where it exists, i.
e. where the stomata are closed, proves 
the existence of the overlying membrane discovered and described by Dr. Brown." â€”

On the Mode of Growth of Monotropa Hypopitys.
The discussion between 
Messrs.
Lees and Wilson on the parasitic nature of Monotropa excited so much inte- 
rest in my mind, that not only did I regret its sudden termination, but determined on 
the first opportunity to examine the matter thoroughly for myself.
Today, through 
the kindness of Mr. Wilson, I obtained specimens from Southport, and after some la- 
bour and trouble have arrived at the following conclusions, which, as they differ in 
some measure from those of both the combatants above mentioned, I beg to hand you 
for a place, if thought worthy of it, in your invaluable Journal.
Having carefully 
removed the outer covering of sand, I came to the matted roots of the willow, which, 
from their density, and the t^uantity of sand amongst them, threatened to prove an ef- 
fectual barrier to my further progress, for an hour was spent in unsuccessful picking 
and poking at them with a penknife.
In this stage of my proceedings a large bowl 
of water was procured, and by slowly moving the mass, held carefully between my 
hands, through the water, the stem of the plant being supported by my thumbs, I 
had soon the gratification of seeing, not only all the sand, but the loose willow-roots 
and much other foreign matter, deposited in the bowl.
The plant was then allowed to 
drain for a minute, and it afterwards required very little labour to extricate it, with 
roots, as seen at fig.
1. The plant is not parasitic ; it has no organic connexion with 
330 
the " nidi " of roots among wliich its own are developed ; but on tlie other hand it 13 
provided with an independent root of its own, and that, too, as extensive as in most 
plants of its size : nor are these dense nodules of fibre produced only in its immediate 
vicinity; several such were examined, and no trace of Monotropa could he found; â€” 
they appear to be attached equally to other substances.
After examining the willow- 
roots which were in contact with those of the Monotropa, and on which I could find, 
in no instance, the slightest evidence of attachment, I proceeded to note the structure 
of the root itself.
It consists of very brittle, tortuous, fibres, which are thickly stud- 
ded with more or less claviform branches or fibrils (as represented magnified in fig.
2).
Many of these fibrils were necessarily broken off during their separation from the mass, 
but in such cases a scar distinctly marks their former position.
One of them was 
then placed under the microscope ; with a low power it appeared as at fig.
3, and the 
transparency of the tip suggested the idea that they were spongioles formed as in other 
plants.
Various sections were then made, which, on the application of higher powers, 
proved this to be the case ; figs.
4 and 5 are selected from these, and show at once all 
the peculiarities of the ordinary spongiole.
From this it will appear that although the 
root of the Monotropa be remarkable in structure, it is still a true root, and present in 
sufficient quantity to supply the necessities of the plant ; and with regard to its con- 
stant proximity to the root of some tree, may it not â€” the difficulty of the subject and 
the notion of parasitism having called undue attention to it â€” be more signally re- 
markable in our books than in nature ?
Or is the excrementitious matter of these 
trees particularly nutritious to it, or it's to them ?
This I leave to those who have bet- 
ter opportunity to decide the matter ; but I have no hesitation in saying, that the Mo- 
notropa has as independent an existence as any other plant.
The " minute hair-like 
fibres '' mentioned by Mr. Lees were also carefully examined ; they have certainly not 
the appearance of suckers, and though they infest the plant to a considerable extent, 
are not universally present, indeed I could not assert that they are part of its struc- 
ture.* â€” Thos.

Cistopteris fragilis grows abundantly at Castleton ; I gathered some beauti- 
ful fronds that were growing on the rocks at the entrance of and rather sheltered by the

Lathyrus Aphaca.
1 take the liberty of enclosing a specimen of Lathyrus 
Aphaca with its true leaves, which I believe are rare.
It was discovered in 1841 by 
Mr. W.
Newnham, jun., in a corn-field near Farnham, where it was then very plenti- 
ful ; this year it is by some accident very rare.
The enclosed was gathered by myself.

Newnham; Farnham, Surrey, August 4, 1841.
[We beg our correspendent to accept our thanks for the interesting little specimen 
sent.
The occasional appearance of leaves in this species, especially on young plants, 
is mentioned by Linnasus, Smith, Hooker, and other authors, but we do not remember 
having seen any notice of a variation in the form of the stipules when the leaves are 
present.
The young specimen kindly forwarded by Mr. Newnham has two leaves, 
each consisting of a pair of elliptic-lanceolate leaflets ; tlie stipules accompanying the 
leaves, instead of being of the usual broad arrow-shaped fonm, are merely half arrow- 
shaped.

Inland Localities for Maritime Plants.
I beg to hand you the following no- 
tice of plants which have been recently discovered by Mr. George Reece of this city, 
in localities not hitherto noticed by botanists, so far as I am aware.
Arenaria marina 
is mentioned in Purton's 'Midland Flora' as occurring on Defford Common, where 
salt springs were discovered many years since, and where salt is now, I believe, manu- 
factured an a small scale.
Erodiura maritiraum is also recorded by Purton as having 
been found at Stourbridge, Kinver and Bewdley ; and to Triglochin palustre is as- 
signed a habitat at Feckenham ; but neither Glaux maritima nor Plantago maritima 
is noticed in the ' Midland Flora.' Arenaria marina, Glaux maritima and Triglochin 
palustre are found on the banks of the Droitwich Canal ; Erodium maritimum and 
Plantago maritima on Hartlebury Common.
Beautiful specimens of these plants have 
been collected by Mr. Reece, and are now deposited in the herbarium of the Worces- 
tershire Natural-History Society.

Note on Woodsia Ilvensis.
On the 17th of 8th month [August] 1798, my fa- 
ther gathered a single frond of a fern from Crosby-Ravensworth Church, Westmore- 
land.
Being unable to name it he showed it to several botanists in London, who coiUd 
not decide what it was ; Lewis Dillwyn at length sent it to Sir J.
E. Smith, who re- 
turned the specimen labelled as follows : â€” 
" Polypodium arvonicum.
With, et Fl. Brit.
J. E.
Smith.
P. ilvense.
With.
^ 
Acrost.
ilvense, Huds.
(not Linn.) 
Acr. alpinum, Bolt." 
The original specimen is now in my possession, with Sir J.
E. Smith's autograph ; the 
frond is 3^ inches in length from the bottom of the rachis to the apex, and about 2 
inches from the lowest pinnae to the apex.
The church has been pulled down and re- 
built within the last few years.

Enquiry respecting the British Oaks.
Can any of your correspondents inform 
me what are the true specific distinctions between Quercus Robur, intermedia, and 
sessiliflora?
I have found what I consider to be the three species growing in various 
localities round Manchester: I have also gathered a number of specimens with the 
form of the leaves, length of the petioles and situation of the fruit so varied and inter- 
mediate, that I cannot with certainty refer them to either species.
Several trees near 
Mottram, from which I procured specimens last month, have the fruit quite sessile and 
the petioles of the leaves so short as to be scarcely perceptible ; whilst specimens of the 
ti*ue sessiliflora from Leigh Woods, near Bristol, given to me by Mr. Grindon, and al- 
so specimens gathered by myself in Bredbury Wood, Cheshire, have petioles near an 
inch in length.
I have also specimens from near Mottram, which appear to be hy- 
brids between Q.
Robur and intermedia ; these have their fruit upon peduncles less 
than an inch long, but never properly sessile, whilst the leaves are perfectly so.
The 
fonn which I consider to be the real intermedia of authors, has long petioles to the 
leaves, and peduncles nearly half an inch in length, but one of the most prominent 
characters is in the form of the foliage ; for whilst in Robur the leaf is much dilated 
towards the extremity, in intermedia the greatest width exists near the centre, the end 
332 
being much narrower in proportion, and the margin being altogether more bluntly cut 
or divided.
I am inclined to believe from the consideration of these several forms that 
either the number of our native species of oak is at present undetermined, or that in 
reality we possess but one.^Joseph Sidehotham ; 26, York St., Manchester, August 12, 
1842.

On Monotropa Hypopitys.
In deference to such high authority as that by 
which Mr. Newman's views are supported, I have re-examined the subject with much 
care, and specimens kindly supplied by Mr. Newman in a recent state have been stu- 
died in connexion with others obtained from Southport.
Before I state the conclu- 
sion at which I have arrived, let me acknowledge to my much-esteemed opponents, 
that although I consider them to have been mistaken, I regard their error as scarcely 
to be avoided under the circumstances.
I have seen a portion of a specimen corre- 
sponding with that which they examined, and was myself strongly inclined at the first 
to coincide in their view ; nor was it until after very minute dissection that I perceived 
any fallacy.
The " rhizoma " had apparently an uniform fibrous covering; but in the 
specimen since received from Mr. Newman, and in those from Southport (examined 
at the same time) the fibrous matter occurs only in very irregular and detached mass- 
es, leaving considerable tracts of the rhizoma quite naked, and this fibrous matter ap- 
pears to be different on different specimens ; but as an able and enthusiastic friend is 
now engaged in the investigation of this portion of the subject, I shall briefly state 
that my inference is that the supposed " cuticle of the rhizoma " is really a foreign 
body.
Thin transverse sections of the stem exhibit no trace whatever of a cortical lay- 
er; except that the cellular tissue is surrounded by a single indurated stratum of 
smaller cells of a brown colour, perfectly continuous with the rest of the cellular tis- 
sue.
No membranous cuticle could be detected, by scraping or otherwise, upon the 
stem.
On the rhizoma something like a cuticle was at times found in parts not coated 
with fibrous matter ; but this, besides being immeasurably thinner, is diflferent in struc- 
ture from the cuticle referred to in Mr. Newman's paper* (Phytol.
298), and can only 
be detected by scraping the surface of the rhizoma.
In some cases it seems to be quite 
absent, and may therefore not belong to the plant.
Mr. Newman's first and second 
reasons do not appear to be well founded.
Wherever the fibrous matter occurs I find 
it matted together, and attached to the rhizoma in such a manner as to forbid the idea 
of organic connexion ; and if there be any difference in the thickness of the ends of 
each fibre, which is very doubtful, the position of the parts is at variance with Mr.
Newman's idea.
The fibres indeedare often united together into fasciculi, presenting 
an appearance very apt to mislead.
After careful inspection of the colourless extremi- 
ties of the " rhizoma," I retain the opinion expressed in my former remarks.
In 
opposition to the opinion that they are only growing extremities of the divisions of a 
rhizoma, I would remark that I know of no instance where the growing j)arts of a rhi- 
zoma have a downward or backward direction ; also that the supposed growing extre- 
mities never develope themselves into scaly buds : â€” these are always laterally inserted, 
and, if I mistake not, are at first immersed in the substance of the root, like the buds 
in the tuber of a potato.
On this point my former remarks require some correction.
â€” 
W. Wilson; Warrington, August 12, 1842.
* Considerably more than ^^^j^ of an inch in thickness, and therefore easily seen when 
a section of the rhizoma is under the microscope.

On Carex tenella.
Far be it from me to condemn that liberal criticism, the 
object of which is the attainment or communication of truth.
Next to the relation of 
interesting facts, I know of nothing more suited to the pages of 'The Phytologist' 
than judicious and candid strictures on standard works relating to Botany ; I trust we 
shall see many such, and that Mr. Gibson will frequently direct his abilities into that 
channel.
In my former remarks I did not intend more than to show that the author 
of the ' British Flora' is not chargeable with the neglect or inadvertence imputed to 
him.
The account given by Sir J.
E. Smith was referred to, proving that an experi- 
enced botanist, with superior advantages for forming a correct judgement, and with 
peculiar inducements to be deliberate, may see or think he sees, in Schkuhr's figure of 
Carex tenella, something which is not apparent to Mr. Gibson.
The question indeed 
is properly one between him and Sir J.
E. Smith only; and if it should prove, as T 
believe it will, that the question of doubt in ' British Flora' was confined to the Scot- 
tish specimen called C.
tenella by Smith, Mr. G.
must be sensible that some of his 
remarks were needless, as bearing upon a point not under dispute.
Admitting Mr.
G. to be right in his view of Schkuhr's figure, it follows that Smith must have been 
wrong, and if so, he may have been also in error as to the Scottish specimen.
I could 
point out parallel cases where Sir J.
E. Smith has too hastily assumed the identity of 
essentially diff'erent plants ; and it is probable that if he possessed only a solitaiy spe- 
cimen, his examination would, in this case, be rather superficial.
To ascertain the 
existence of only two stamens, dissection would be requisite, and to dissect would be 
to mutilate what he might wish to preserve uninjured.
The fruit also might be so 
immature as not to exhibit the character of the species.
The author of ' British Flora' 
was not bound to admit that specimen, which he had never seen, on the mere author- 
ity of one who reported that Schkuhr's figure could not be implicitly relied on ; and it 
would not be unreasonable in Mr. G.
to have some misgivings on the same subject.
Let it be remembered also that Wahlenberg and Willdenow refer the whole figure to 
C. loliacea, a species which, notwithstanding what is said of it by Smith, may possibly 
have fruit corresponding with the figure.
To determine this question recourse must 
be had to the original description, and perhaps to an authentic specimen of C.
lolia- 
cea.

Note on a Criticism in Taylor^s Annals* Allow me to say in reference to a 
note in the July number of the ' Annals and Magazine of Natural History,' (p.
421), 
* The following is the criticism referred to by Mr. Gibson.
" Notes on Arenaria 
rubra, marina and media ; by S.
Gibson, Esq.
[The two former appear to us to be dis- 
tinct species, but we cannot agree with Mr. Gibson in separating the latter from ma- 
rina, as our own observations would lead us to believe that the characters drawn from 
the seeds and length of the capsule are not constant.
We trust that we shall not be 
considered presumptuous if we hint to this very accurate observer, that a more frequent 
reference to the writings of continental botanists would be desirable.
We say this 
without the least wish to detract from the value of Mr. Gibson's papers, but m^erely to 
avoid the introduction of additional synonyms into our already encumbered science, of 
which an instance occurred in a late number of the ' Phytologist,' where a supposed 
new species of Monotropa is named and described, which had long since received se- 
veral denominations in botanical works.]" â€” From a notice of 'The Phytologist,' in the 
'Annals and Magazine of Natural History,' ix.
421.
334 
that I have this season, willi a determination to avoid any preconceived opinion on 
Arenaria marina and media, made all the enquiry that I possibly could ; the result of 
this enquiry is that I have not been able to find anything opposed to what I have be- 
fore said on the subject, (Phytol.
217).
After assiduously examining these plants, I 
may be excused for observing that I cannot participate in the writer's opinion; for not- 
withstanding the possibility of there being some little variation in the seeds (but such 
I have never seen), I have not the least doubt of their specific distinction.
I might 
just as confidently state the rubra to be identical, if I were to find some little differ- 
ence in the seeds of that plant, and indeed it would appear that the seeds of rubra do 
vary most strangely, as they are described by Leighton and others as being angular, 
whereas all that I have seen are somewhat pyrifoim ; perhaps the Arenaria rubra de- 
scribed by authors may be a plant which I have never seen, as it would appear that 
the rubra of authors is something very like marina, since Mr. Babington tells us that 
he is inclined to believe them to be two species, but that he has been unable satisfac- 
torily to distinguish them, (' Priraitiae Floras Sarnicae,' p.
16).
So far as regards the 
Monotropa, I am quite willing to give up for a better one the name I have used to 
distinguish the two fornis of that plant, and shall leave to botanists the decision of the 
question how far they may be distinct as species.
I am well aware of the evil attend- 
ing the introduction of additional synonymes, and am much surprised to find that bo- 
tanists who ought to know better are carrying out the thing to the greatest length ; as 
I see that we have in Baines's 'Flora of Yorkshire,' published in 1840, a description 
of Aira caespitosa, var.
j8.
rigida ; in Leighton's ' Flora of Shropshire,' published in 
1841, we have an Aira caespitosa, var.
/3.
major ; in the Edinburgh Botanical Society's 
Catalogue, second edition, 1841, we have an Aira caespitosa, var.
^3.
vivipara ; and if we 
look into a few works on our British plants, we shall find that in many instances the 
same plant has a different name in each.
In Lightfoot's ' Flora Scotica' we have a 
plant under the name of Arundo arenaria ; in the 4th edition of Withering's Botany 
we have the same plant called Calamagrostis arenaria, and in the 5th edition of the 
same work Arundo arenaria ; in Gray's Botany it is called Psamma arenaria, in Smith's 
' English Flora' Arundo arenaria ; by Sir W.J. Hooker it is called Ammophila arun- 
dinacea; in the Edinburgh Society's new Catalogue we find it to be Ammophila 
ARENARIA, Should wc wish to trace this plant into the works of continental writers, 
we shall find it under such names as Spartum auglicanum, &c.
But as I have no 
wish to go beyond the bounds of my own country, I will trace the Ammophila a little 
further in the works of my countrymen ; the above name T find used in 1802 for a ge- 
nus of Hymenopterous insects by Kirby, the same name has been retained by Turton, 
Sowerby, Leach, Samouelle, Stephens, &c.
The above name Ammophila arenaria 
may be convenient to the Edinburgh Botanical Society for the Sand-marram, but for 
me as an entomologist it is not convenient, for if I consult Donovan on that subject, I 
find the very same name â€” Ammophila arenaria applied to one of our Sand Wasps.
And perhaps botanists will soon lose their antiquated generic name Ficus, as I see Mr.
Cumberland of Bristol is now using it for a genus oi fossil Crinoidea.
The editors of 
the 'Annals and Magazine ' say that they trust they will not be thought presumptuous 
in hinting to me that a more frequent reference to the writings of continental botanists 
is desirable.
In reply to this I would tell them (as it appears they have forgotten it) 
that all botanists are not equally fortunate in being so placed as to have an opportu- 
nity of consulting such books ; and if I may be allowed to speak on the introduction 
of synonymes, we have a fine specimen of this in the Shropshire Flora.
The four spe- 
335 
cles of Arenaria found in that county are there phiced luider four different generic 
names ; the Arenaria rubra of Smith being Lepigonum rubrum in Leighton's Flora 
-and the Alsine rubra of the Edinburgh Society's new Catalogue.

Note on Carex axillaris and remota.
Allow me to return my best thanks for 
the information given by Mr. Wilson on the two Carices, (Phytol.
299).
I have care- 
fully looked over the descriptions and separated the characters assigned to each ; and 
leaving out all the superfluous matter they will stand thus : â€” 
1. Carex axillaris.
Leaves flattened.
Bracteas variable in length, second very 
small, with a membranous base, upper part rough, veiy narrow and awn-like, all of 
tliem auricled at the base.
Rachis perfectly straight, with three rough angles.
Glumes 
roundish-ovate, tipped with a very short rough point.
2. Carex remota.
Leaves bent in at the sides, so as to be almost semicylindrical.
Bracteas generally with a pale very obscure ligula, passing completely round the com- 
mon stalk.
\_Rachis'] zigzag, in the upper part with two rough angles.
Glumes ovate- 
iicuminate, narrower than the fruit.
Mr. Wilson tells us that the rachis in remota is zigzag, and in axillaris perfectly 
straight.
Dr. Wood tells us that the lower bractea in axillaris forms as it were a con- 
tinuation of the stem as regards its direction.
Now if the Dr. be correct in this point 
the stem must be pushed out to give room for the spikelet, and therefore would be at 
variance with Mr. W.'s straight rachis.
Mr. W.
tells us that the leaves in axillaris 
arejlat^ the Dr. tells us that they are channelled â€” but stop, perhaps I am leaving out 
.something of importance, he says ^^ plane though channelled," &c.
; here I am a loss to 
know how a plane leaf can be channelled.
Whatever praise might be due to Dr.
Goodenough from his first paper on our British Carices, I do think that he robbed him- 
self of such praise by writing the following passage.
â€” " 1 have stated axillaris as hav- 
ing the capsule divided at the summit, and remota as having it entire ; but this is not 
constant.
I believe all Carices dispose of their seeds by the opening of the point of 
their capsule, this opening is observable in some very early, in others not till quite old.
In the fomier the capsule is described as opening ; in the latter, because it is not seen 
but in very advanced age, it is mentioned as closed." â€” (Trans.
Linn.
Soc. iii.
76).
Whatever Mr. W.
may think of the above passage, it was written when the subject 
had, or at least ought to have been, fully investigated.
However Mr. W.
may be sur- 
prised at my opinion on what Dr. Goodenough has said on the capsules of our Carices, 
I now say that if ever he had investigated the fruit of one Carex, he would have known 
that when the fruit is first formed, that the opening, if there be any, is very conspicu- 
ous, and may be seen surrounding the style, with the stigmas protruding therefrom ; 
and as soon as the capsule is discernible, it will be seen whether its beak be entire or 
cloven, as it never changes in that respect after it is first formed.
So far as regards 
my quotation from the ' English [British] Flora,' I would ask Mr. W.
if Sir W.
J. 
Hooker had not accurately described C.
axillaris in the first edition of that work, or 
has he conected himself in order that his description may better agree with that of Sir 
James Edward Smith.?
Mr. W.
tells us that the bracteas in C.
axillaris are by no 
means constant in their length ; if he be correct in this, Sir W.
Hooker had made no 
mistake, and therefore we could have no need of any such correction.
Mr. W.
tells 
us that the passage I have quoted from the ' English Flora' without the word "per- 
haps,'' is sheer nonsense ; I would say that the passage as it stands in the ' English 
Flora ' is something very like nonsense, for it amounts to nothing more than to say it 
336 
ma}/ or may not he so.
What Sir J.
E. Smith might have had in his mind when he 
wrote tlie passage I know not ; but I do disapprove of the use of such passages in de- 
scriptions of plants.
But as I have said before, in my enquiry on the two species of 
Carex, ray real difEculty in making out the two may perhaps arise from my never hav- 
ing seen them both ; but here I must say (omitting Dr. Goodenough's description of 
the capsule of his remota), that I have specimens in my possession that will answer to 
every description that I have seen, and many other forms that are not described at all 
in any work.
Our Carex axillaris, remota, angustifolia, csespitosa, aquatilis, stricta, 
acuta, and others, require a strict investigation, in order that the species may be cor- 
rectly made out, and the mere varieties arranged as such.
To describe the extremes 
of any variable plant is quite easy, but when we have got a regular gradation from 
the two extremes, then the difEculty occurs.
â€” Id.
[We trust that the discussion on this subject will now be allowed to terminate : 
had Mr. Gibson's only object been to obtain information on a doubtful point, he would, 
we think, have been satisfied with acknowledging that already afibrded, which appears 
quite suflficient to enable any one to distinguish Carex axillaris from every state of 
C. remota.
We have thought it unnecessary to extend Mr. Gibson's paper beyond 
its present limits, by printing some remarks therein contained on two specimens of 
Carex remota which accompanied it : the only difference we can perceive between 
these specimens is, that one is rather more slender than the other.

Note on the Stomata of Equisetum hyemale.
I would remark on what is said 
of the stomata of Equisetum hyemale (Phytol.
278), that they are immersed in cavities, 
not in elevated disks.
There are two series of stomata in each furrow, one immedi- 
ately on each side of the ridge, and somewhat concealed under it when in a dry state.
The structure of E.
variegatum is similar, but less conspicuous.

This, like the preceding form of the species, is local, occurring ge- 
nerally on dry moveable sand in the immediate vicinity of the sea : 
when in moist situations it assumes a somewhat altered appearance, 
but the example figured is, T think, a faithful representative of the 
plant when growing in dry sand.
In England it occurs at the mouth of the Mersey ; I have repeated- 
ly observed it on New Brighton sands on the Cheshire side, and the 
Bootle sands on the Lancashire side : it is tolerably abundant also at 
Southport, in the latter county.
In Teesdale it has been found in 
several spots, more particularly on Widdy Bank, and about Winch 
Bridge : the specimens from this locality are much less rough to the 
touch than those from the Mersey.
In Scotland it occurs on the sands of Barry, near Dundee ; also in 
Rosshire, and in Kincardineshire on the banks and in the bed* of the 
Dee, intermixed with the two forms of the plant already described ; 
the specimens are generally much more elongate, and like those from 
Teesdale are also smoother than the Mersey specimens.
In Ireland 
it is abundant in several sea-coast localities, more particularly at Port 
Mariiock in the vicinity of Dublin, and also in the Dublin Canal.
For specimens from these localities, and for much valuable infor- 
mation respecting them, I have to acknowledge my best thanks to Dr.
Greville, Dr. Balfour, Mr. Wilson, Mr. Babington, Mr. Gibson, the 
Rev. Mr.
Bi'ichan, and Mr. Moore of the Dublin Glasnevin Garden.
The roots and rhizoma, like those of E.
Mackaii, present no cha- 
racters by which I can distinguish this from the normal form of hye- 
male.
Like the roots of many other plants when growing in loose 
sand, those of the present variety are frequently clothed with a quan- 
* An error occurs in a quotation from the Eev. Mr.
Brichan's letter, (Phytol.
306); 
instead of " what is usually called the bed of the river,'' it should have been " what is 
usually the bed of the river." The meaning is this, " that the Dee has this season, 
owing to the excessive heat, sunk so far within its usual bounds, as not to cover what 
is usualhj its bed." That part of the Dee in which the Equiseta occur is in the county 
of Kincardine, not of Aberdeen.
339 
tity of matted fibrillae : the stems are short, often semiprostrate, and 
the internodes are short and frequently somewhat arcuate, giving the 
enthe stem a sinuous appearance.
The figure represents the plant of 
the natural size ; the four detached stems being portions of rather 
more elongate specimens : both the sheaths and internodes are stria- 
ted ; the striae ai'e few in number, six or eight may be taken as the 
average : under a microscope the cuticle precisely resembles that of 
the varieties already described : the ridges are grooved, the grooves 
being margined on each side with a longitudinal series of minute flinty 
tubercles : in the furrows are two longitudinal series of stomala placed 
very near the ridges, indeed so near, that in stems dried in an imma- 
ture state, they are frequently partially obscured by the ridges.
Mr.
Wilson, whose surpassing accuracy deserves the thanks of all botani- 
cal students, has pointed out a very decided error in my prior descrip- 
tions, in which I have stated the stomata to be placed on the ridges 
instead of in the furrows.
On receiving Mr. Wilson's note, correct- 
ing this error, I carefully re-examined the specimens, and found that 
ray published description was erroneous, and Mr. Wilson perfectly 
correct.
The lower portion of the sheaths is perfectly concolorous 
with that of the internode, the upper portion only is black, thus caus- 
ing the sheath to appear much shorter than in the varieties previously 
described : the teeth are short, wedge-shaped, and commonly without 
the setiform apex which distinguishes the variety last described: their 
edges are membranous, occasionally black, as represented in the de- 
tached stems to the left of the figure, but usually white, giving the 
plant that variegated appearance from which its name has probably 
been derived.
The catkin is small, apiculate, terminal and striated, 
as in the preceding varieties ; its scales are few â€” eighteen 
to twenty-five in number.
The stem of this variety is much less liable to become 
branched than either of the preceding, still this branch- 
ing occasionally occurs ; in the margin I have represented 
a New Brighton specimen bearing a branch ; the black 
colouring of the sheath in this specimen extends much 
lower than is usual, yet the teeth remain wedge-shaped.
Specimens occasionally occur in the same habitat repeat- 
edly branched, and much more luxuriant than the one 
figured.
Of one of these in his own herbarium Mr.
Wilson has kindly furnished the following description.
" 1 have some specimens of E.
variegatum from New Brighton, op- 
posite Liverpool, which are very much branched, and very tall ; but 
2e 2 
340 
even in these I can find only two branches at any one joint.
1 will 
describe one of the best marked of these.
Height 22 inches, of which 
2j inches is black, having been buried in the ground to that depth, 
and rather more.
At 2^ inches two opposite branches (a a) shoot out, 
with rooted hases.
At the next joint are two other opposite branches 
B 
(b b) placed at right angles to the first pair a * a with respect to the 
B 
axis.
At the next joint are two other opposite branches, as in a a, 
and at the next joint is another opposite pair, as in b b.
The right 
branch, a, at the seventh joint, has two branches, which are contigu- 
ous or nearly so (not opposite), and two more at the ninth in the same 
condition; two opposite ones at the tenth joint, one branch having 
the same direction as the two lower branches.
In this specimen the 
main stem is broken off" at the height of seven inches ; the second 
primary pair of branches has also one branch ramified, but less re- 
markably so than the one which I have already given in detail." 
Mr. Moore's specimens of the Dublin plant were accompanied by 
the following note.
" There is a third plant* which claims attention, 
it occurs near Dublin, growing in water, upright, and to a much great- 
er size than E.
variegatum in its usual state, and it possesses the other 
characters noticed in Hooker's ' British Flora,' 4th edition, p.
394, f 
as distinguishing the plant found by Mr. Wilson at Muckruss.
This 
species or variety, whichever you please to call it, appears to adhere 
to its natural habit when subjected to cultivation, under which state 
I have had it about six months, and the new fi-onds are getting much 
stronger than those which the plant produced naturally.
Although 
entirely removed from the water it grows quite erect, and continues 
smoother, with the same number of striae." I do not agree with my 
much-esteemed correspondent in thinking the Dublin and Muckruss 
plants identical, still the Dublin plant is very different from the usual 
variegatum form, and nearly resembles the specimens from Kincar- 
dineshire already alluded to.

lished in the furrows, and the sheaths not so conspicuously nor so constantly furnished 
with acumin.ited teeth or summits as is usual in the ordinary state of the plant.'' â€” Br.

â€” On the nature of Ihc BijshouI Substance found 
investing the Roots of Monotropa Hypopitys.
By Thos.
G. 
Rylands, Esq.
Although I feel, and with much more cause, the diffidence expe- 
rienced by Mr. Newman in expressing an opinion on a subject so dif- 
ficult as the present one, yet, when after an investigation conducted 
with the utmost care and deliberation, and extended over many hours, 
I have arrived at results the most constant and apparently decided, I 
feel that it is not only desirable, but my duty, to publish them : and 
moreover, it seems but right, since the matter has proceeded thus far, 
that it should not be abandoned till some decision be recorded.
It is 
on these grounds that the following remarks are j)roduced to the public.
The opinions already expressed in 'The Phytologist,' relative to 
the nature of the byssoid substance found on the roots of Monotropa, 
from all stations that have supplied specimens for examination, are as 
follows.
Mr. Luxford refers them to a " byssoid fungus," (Phytol.
43) ; Mr.
Lees regards them as "suckers," (Id. 171) ; Mr. Wilson suggests that 
they may be "the woolly matted extremities of grasses,"* (Id. 149) ; 
and Mr. Newman believes them to be essentially the root, (Id. 297).
To these, in the first place, I will add a detail of my own investiga- 
tions, and then proceed to compare the results of all.
Having arrived 
at the conclusion that the "claviform branches" of the "rhizoma" 
were the true roots of Monotropa (Id. 329), the minute fibres now un- 
der consideration were only examined in connexion with Mr. Lees' 
idea that they were spongioles or suckers, and then thrown aside : but 
on the publication of Mr. Newman's observations, to whose kindness 
I am indebted for specimens of the plant from Shoreham in Kent, and 
Hurstperpoint in Sussex, without which I should have been ill pre- 
pared for my present essay, attention was again directed to them, and 
the following is the result.
Viewed with a magnifying power of about 30 linear, the byssoid 
substance presents an appearance not unlike that of unsized paper seen 
under similar circumstances.
It consists of an irregularly matted mass 
of flocculent matter, more or less depressed, investing the roots of 
* It is but just to my friend Mr. Wilson to state here that after a more careful in- 
vestigation his opinion is, in the main, in strict accordance with the results of my own 
observations.
Nor would I omit to acknowledge how much confidence the accjssiou 
of one whose authority is so deservedly high, has imparted to my mind.
342 
Monotropa, and occasionally other substances in its vicinity.
Usu- 
ally it is present in such quantities as to render the examination of it 
an operation exceedingly difficult ; on the Southport specimens it 
is sometimes much less abundant, but even in these cases it was not 
till after repeated examination that the real nature of its connexion 
became satisfactorily apparent.
The fibres of which it is composed 
are nearly equal in thickness throughout, irregularly branched, and 
united hy lateral adhesion, at intervals, to the substance on which 
they are found : this union, in several instances, was so complete, that 
when the fibres were forcibly detached, a very small portion of the bo- 
dy with which they were connected was separated with them ; in no 
case, however, was this operation performed but a continuation of the 
fibre became evident, as seen at n, o, fig.
2. Evidence of a terminal 
connexion or thickened extremities was seen in no instance.* 
In order more fiilly to test the correctness of these observations, 
the roots of other plants were appealed to : several fi^om the green- 
house which were matted owing to the small size of the pots in which 
they grew, were examined ; but in these a marked distinction was evi- 
dent, so much so, that at first sight I should have had no doubt of 
their origin, they possessed in every particular the appearance of 
spongioles : while the really fungoid matter found on the roots of 
groundsel, Epilobium, Plantago &c., had so much resemblance to the 
substance in question, that it would be difficult by words to render 
the difference appreciable.
Thus far had I proceeded when by the application of a magnifying 
power of about 350 linear, I became aware that the fibres on the 
Southport plant were of two very difierent kinds ; and, on examina- 
tion, the specimens received from Mr. Newman afforded, at least, a 
third.
This I regard as a somewhat forcible argument in favour of 
the opinion that they are altogether extraneous ; for all the species are 
similarly attached, and I apprehend that no such differences as those 
about to be described would be likely to occur in the roots of one 
plant.
The species observed are as follows : â€” 
No. I.
â€” Filaments tufted, fasciculate, more or less adnate, membranaceous, slightly 
tubular, jointed, irregularly branched, colourless.f (Fig- 1, c, d, e).
Found only on Mr. Newman's specimens from Shoreham.
* These results were obtained with powers of about 100 â€” 200 linear, 
f The Sussex specimens from Mr. Newman supply a filament differing from these ; 
but as the one had been some time dry before examination, and the others were viewed 
in a fresh state, I have preferred leaving it undescribed.
343 
Were further proof of a lateral connexion necessary, the fact that 
the filaments, when not in contact with any other body, are found thus 
attached to each other, might supply it : in the species most thorough- 
ly adnate they frequently adhere throughout their whole length ; (see 
d, e, fig.
1).
No. II.
â€” Filaments spreading irregularly, adhering at intervals, horny, smooth, dis- 
tinctly tubular, and divided by septa, from which are produced the hemispheri- 
cal buds of the branches ?
(</) : branches nearly at a right angle.
Of a rich brown 
colour.
(Fig. 2,/, g, m, n, o ; Fig. 3, x, y).
Found in moderate quantities on most of the portions examined, 
exterior to the other species.
No. III.
â€” Filaments agglutinated or interwoven together, pellucid, with slight traces 
of a cellular structure, rarely dichotomously branched ; accompanied by numer- 
ous subspherical tuberculated or granulated bodies (sporidia ?), which have on 
their depressed surfaces a circular lucid disk.
(Fig. 2, h, i, k, I).
Found only on a portion of the Southport specimens.
To Mr. Wilson I am indebted for calling my attention to the 
spheroidal bodies ; they were not observed during my examination 
of Southport plants, gathered three weeks after his, and as they are 
objects far from likely to be overlooked, I suppose they were not pre- 
sent : the fibre to which they belong was there in abundance.
Speci- 
mens from Southport gathered in 1841, kindly supplied by Mr. Wilson, 
having the filaments, are likewise without the sporidia.
All my attempts to discover actual proofs of an organic connexion 
of these globules with the fibres among which they are found, have 
been unsuccessful : though from several circumstances observed, such 
as that the filaments are frequently flattened, and have occasionally in 
the depressions the appearance of scars (fig.
2, ^), I have little doubt 
that such does exist, the transparent disks being the point of union.
Fragments of one or two other kinds have been met with, but not in 
quantities to supply the characters for a description.
The three given 
will suffice.
Such are the data on which I would ground the opinion that the 
"byssoid substance" is really fungoid, and performs no essential func- 
tion in the economy of the Monotropa.
Each of the operations has 
been often repeated, with all the care and diligence I could command.
Sections in all variety have been viewed, wet, moist and dry, with re- 
flected and transmitted light; and though the results were in all cases 
the same, yet it should be stated that those were the most satisfactory 
in which the portion had been saturated with, and was examined

From the nature of the objects this might 
have been expected ; for let it be remembered that six thousand of the 
filaments in juxta-position would but occupy an inch, and moreover, 
that so delicate and tender is their texture, that the air of a room, or 
even the dryness ordinary to the atmosphere at this season, causes 
them speedily to shrivel and contract.
The advantages of this mode 
of examination, and its efficiency, are admitted in regard to other 
members of the class.
In reply to Mr. Newman's reasons for believing them a portion of 
the Monotropa, I would say : â€” 
Firstly.
â€” Its presence â€” if he refers to a byssoid substance gene- 
rally â€” is, as far as we can judge, scarcely more "constant" than 
other species of fungus, when the circumstances are suited to their 
growth ; â€” putrefying paste has constantly its Mucor.
On some por- 
tions of the Southport plant it was not present at all ; if the spe- 
cies found on the plant from Shoreham alone is intended, and such

would appear the most forcible argument, it was not on the Southport 
plant in any case.
Secondly.
â€” From the examination of analogous productions, I am 
led to believe that the stmctural and habitual " uniformity of its 
growth " is such as to strengthen the idea that they are fungi, rather 
than to prove them the roots of a phenogamous plant.
Thirdly.
â€” That although, when viewed partially dry, the substance 
of the rhizoma and these fibres may " appear perfectly continuous 
and identical," yet, when distended, every trace of such appearance is 
lost; nor does a longitudinal section of the rhizoma display any signs 
of an internal continuation of the fibres, which, if they were indeed 
the fibrillae of the root, might be expected.
Such is the case with the 
claviform branches before mentioned, (fig.
1, a).
Fomthly.
â€” That in no instance, either sectional or otherwise, could 
any "rupture of the cuticle " be produced, except such as already ex- 
plained, and shown on / in fig.
2. 
In reference to Mr. Lees' opinion that the fibres arc " suckers," I 
346 
would remark, tliat those portions which are produced on the root of 
Monotropa itself, under ordinary circumstances, labour rather to main- 
tain their connexion with it than to unite with other substances : and 
would refer to their structure as one not at all supporting his idea.
In conclusion, I would urge upon Mr. Luxford the more thorough 
examination of specimens from the locality where " the slowly decay- 
ing leaves of the heech " in the neighbourhood of Monotropa, " are 
generally covered with a white byssoid fungus." That such is their 
nature not the slightest doubt now remains in my mind ; I regard them 
as an interesting addition to our Cryptogamic vegetation, and hope 
that the following attempt to assign them " a local habitation and a 
name " among their fellows, undertaken as it has been at the express 
desire of several parties, will not be deemed an impropriety.
In proceeding with this portion of the subject I felt that there was 
no small difficulty to be overcome, not only on account of the intri- 
cate nature of the order, but from the fact that our knowledge of my- 
cological productions generally, is so exceedingly imperfect.
So 
great however was my desire lastingly to associate with the discovery 
the names of those gentlemen who originated or have assisted in it, 
that I applied to the Rev. M.
J. Berkeley, enclosing him specimens 
and sketches.
To his kind attention and assistance I am indebted 
for a knowledge of the genera Zygodesmus and Tubm-cinia, and se- 
veral other particulars, without which I could not have approximated 
so nearly to the truth.
Epiphagos Luxfordii, (Ryl. MSS.) Fig. 1 , c, d, e.
This I have applied as a provisional name to No. 1 â€” the species 
observed by Mr. Luxford on beech-leaves and Monotropa.
There is 
much reason to believe it an undescribed genus, probably a byssoid 
Alga ; but owing to the total absence of fi-uctification its position can- 
not be positively determined.
It is to be hoped that at some future 
period Mr. Luxford will be fortunate enough to meet with fertile spe- 
cimens.

of Corda, characterized as follows) : â€”

It is with no design to forward my own views that three of the four

that two of the species do not perfectly accord with the genera in 
which they have been placed, such having been constructed with re- 
ference only to the kinds then known ; so slight however are the dis- 
crepancies, as will be seen by the parentheses, that I have deemed it 
but prudent to admit them.

On the Botanical Characters of the British Oaks.
By R.
K. Gre- 
viLLE, LL.D., F.L.S., &c., Vice-President of the Botanical Society.
For three years previously to the publication of this paper the au- 
thor was engaged in the examination of the British oaks, with a view 
to ascertain the characters by which each so-called species may be 
distinguished from its congeners: the results of this investigation are 
here published.
The paper is accompanied by two plates, wherein 
are delineated the most striking forms of leaf which have come under 
the author's notice, together with the peduncle and young fruit ; and 
349 
the author observes that " in an extensive series of specimens, these 
forms are united by intermediate links." In his preliminary remarks 
he also states : â€” 
" When I first approached this suhject with a view to ascertain the value of the 
characters by which the British Oaks are supposed to be distinguished, I was under a 
strong impression, that at least, the two forms recognised as species under the names 
of Robur and sessilrflora were really distinct.
But I soon found that the ascribed cha- 
racters were of little importance in rigid specific discrimination, and that the only one 
of any value at all, viz., the sessile or pedunculated fruit, must be received with so 
much latitude as greatly to weaken, if not to render it entirely unworthy of confi- 
dence." â€” p.
65.
The following remarks are made on " the characters supposed to 
reside in the leaves." 
1. The petiole in Quercus Robur is said to be short; that is, in the 
form so called the petiole is supposed to be shorter than in either Q.
sessiliflora or intermedia.
In two of the figures " which certainly do 
not represent Q.
Kobur, they are shorter than in several of the forms 
which undoubtedly belong to that plant." 
2. The general outline of the leaf.
This cannot be defined " so as 
to distinguish any of the forms as species, as they run insensibly into 
each other.
Nay, some of the forms in Q.
Robur are absolutely re- 
peated in Q.
sessiliflora." 
3. The characters supplied by the strict outline of the leaf and of 
its several parts, appear to be equally unsatisfactory.
" The base va- 
ries equally in all the forms." " In Q.
Robur, although generally more 
or less bi-auriculate, it is sometimes rounded, and even attenuated," 
and such is the case in Q.
sessiliflora also.
No greater importance is 
to be attached to the pinnatifid character of the leaf; the lobes of the 
leaf too " are sometimes rounded, when the sinuses are acute, and vi- 
ce versa ; and sometimes both lobes and sinuses are obtuse, at others 
both are acute." The staiTy pubescence attributed by Prof.
Don to 
Q. intermedia, the author finds to be present in the young state of 
almost all the forms he has figured, and it may be traced in nearly the 
whole series of his fully developed specimens.
" If the leaf be taken in conjunction with the peduncle, no character whatever is 
afforded ; and I agree with Mr. Leighton, who has truly remarked that the leaves of 
our oaks 'vary without the least reference to the absence or presence, or relative length 
of the peduncle.' If the peduncle alone be taken as a guide, we shall in vain search 
for an immutable character, for every intermediate state is to be observed between the 
elongated peduncle as I have it from Cumberland, 5 inches long, and from Killin, 
above 4 inches long, to its total absence.
350 
'â€¢ When the peduncle becomes shorter, it is generally thickened or distorted; and 
when present, as it often is in Q.
sessiliflora, it is very short and robust.
It would ap- 
pear, that in proportion as the peduncle deviates from the normal state, as we observe 
it in Q.
Robur, and becomes more and more contracted, the acorns (no longer produ- 
ced at ihe usual intervals) are developed in a clustered manner, till at length the pe- 
duncle becomes so short, as to render them almost, if not really sessile.
The acorns 
of the British oaks are as sportive as the leaves ; so that no characters which have 
been hitherto employed, taken singly or in combination, seem to be available for sepa- 
rating our native oaks.'' â€” p.
67.
" Were we to be guided by the result of such an examination as I have been able 
to institute, into the characters hitherto employed for botanically distinguishing the 
British oaks, we should be led to conclude that we certainly possess only one native 
species.
At the same time, it is quite possible that characters may have been over- 
looked, which may really suffice to separate them.
A remarkable diflference in the 
timber has long been observed, that of Q.
sessiliflora being termed Red Oak, â€” that of 
Q. Robur, White Oak, from the colour of the wood.
The relative merits of the two 
kinds do not seem to be quite satisfactorily established ; but the gi'eatest weight of 
testimony seems to be in favour of red oak (Q.
sessiliflora), contrary to the expressed 
opinion of Sir J.
E. Smith.
"It may still be a question whether the superiority of the one timber over the other 
depends upon the specific difference of the tree.
The subject is one of vast practical 
importance, and still requires much investigation.
It has not been in my power to 
examine the wood of the trees from which my specimens were obtained, and therefore 
I am unable to throw the smallest light on this part of the subject.
My only object 
at this time is to show, that the received botanical characters by which Q.
Robur, Q.
intermedia, and Q.
sessiliflora are at present distinguished, pass insensibly and com- 
pletely into each other, and cannot therefore be depended on, in collecting acorns for 
seed, and supplying the dock-yard with timber." â€” p.

IX.
On the Vegetation and Botany of the Island of Madeira.
JBy James 
Macaulay, A.M., M.D., Foreign Secretary of the Botanical Society.
The author observes that the island of Madeira " may be termed a 
Transition station between the European and the African vegetation, 
and intermediate between the temperate and intertropical regions of 
botanical geography." In character its Flora appears to be most al- 
lied to that of the northern shores of the Mediterranean, notwithstand- 
ing the situation of the island off the African coast, between 32Â° and 
33Â° N.
lat.
Many of the plants however are species not found in Eu- 
rope, although they belong to European genera; some species are 
peculiar to the island, while others are common to Madeira, the Cana- 
ries and the Atlantic isles.
" The scenery is of the inost glorious character, both as respects the beauty of the 
cultivated parts and the sublimity of the mountain districts of the island.
In the in- 
terior, and on the rth coast especially, the traveller meets with combinations of na- 
tural objects such as in no other part of the world can be witnessed, and which oblite- 
351 
rate every conception that had previously been formed of the grand and sublime in 
scenery.
This is greatly the result of the geological character of the island.
The 
mountains have not the integrity of outline and tame regularity of form that always 
appear in some of the formations of older geological epochs, but are composed of the 
most recent basalts and other igneous rocks ; and, on a scale of alpine magnificence, 
present a scene of the wildest confusion, being eveiywhere deeply riven by rugged ra- 
vines, the precipitous cliffs of which are clothed to the very summit with ancient fo- 
rests.
Among these wild scenes there occur landscapes of the utmost loveliness, so 
that the scenery is altogether perhaps the finest in the world.'' â€” p.
71.
The climate and temperature of the island are quite as varied as its 
scenery.
In sheltered spots on the south coast there is a tropical 
temperature, and there the climate remains more genial than an Eng- 
lish summer ; while " on the opposite coast, and in the interior of the 
island, the mountains are covered with snow, and all the rigour of a 
northern winter is experienced.
Between these extremes every de- 
gree of climate is met with, and the range of vegetation varies accord- 
ingly." The author mentions some of the peculiarities arising 
from these varieties of climate, in connexion with the changes of the 
seasons.
" During the winter the residents on the coast look up from amidst their tropical 
vegetation and genial temperature, through every degree of climate and verdure, to 
the bleakest desolation on the snow-covered hills above them.
In the declining months 
of the year, again, while on the coast the summer foliage is yet unaltered, and the in- 
fluence of the sun little diminished, the upper parts of the landscape present the vari- 
egated tints and the fading foliage of autumn.'' â€” p.
72.
The author gives the following as "the most marked zones of bota- 
nical climate on the south side of the island." 
" 1.
Region of Heaths â€” beyond 3500 or 4000 feet above the sea.
Erica arborea 
is the most characteristic plant of this climate.
" 2.
Region of Laurels â€” from 3000 to 4000 feet.
Laurus indica, Laurus Til, and 
other indigenous evergreen forest trees chiefly clothe the mountains in this zone.
" 3.
Region of European Trees â€” from 2000 to 3000 feet.
Forests of chesuut and 
other trees introduced from Europe here principally flourish.
"4.
Region of the Mediterranean Flora â€” from 1000 to 2000 feet.
In this zone 
the plants of Southern Europe abound, and numbers of the trees and flowers of tem- 
perate climates have been introduced.
The upper limit is marked by the vine being 
scarcely cultivated beyond 2000 feet above the sea.
" 5.
Sub-Tropical Region â€” from the level of the sea to 1000 feet above.
The li- 
mit of this zone is well marked by a Cactus, the Opuntia Tuna of DeCandolle, which 
grows on the cliff's on the coast, and does not reach higher than 1000 feet.
" 6.
Tropical Region.
In a few sheltered spots on the south coast many of the 
West Indian and other tropical fruits flourish." â€” p.
73.
352 
The following extracts are in accordance with an opinion we have 
frequently ventured to express, namely, that although elevation and 
climate doubtless exercise considerable influence over the vegetation 
of a district, yet that an influence fully as powerful is exerted by the 
character of the soil.
" The geological structure of the island is almost wholly volcanic, basalts and ba- 
saltic conglomerates and other igneous rocks forming the whole mass of the island.
At 
one or two places there appear beds of tertiary limestone and other non-volcanic for- 
mations, but in so very small a proportion to the whole surface, as to have no effect 
upon the character of the vegetation." â€” p.
72.
" The indigenous Flora is smaller than might be expected from the range of cli- 
mate, the effect probably of the want of variety of soils, and the absence of other causes 
of difference of vegetation.
The most conspicuous natural families are, the Filices, 
the Laurincce, the Compositse and the Labiatse.
Of the Ericese, there are two plants 
which attain to a remarkable growth in the island, â€” Vaccinium maderense and Erica 
arborea.
The whortleberry forms little thickets or forests on the mountain sides, often 
from fifteen to twenty feet in height.
The heath grows eveiywhere on the mountains 
beyond 2500 or 3000 feet above the sea.
On Pico Ruivo, the highest peak in the 
island, it commences at about 3500, and covers most of the mountain side to nearly 
the summit, which is more than 6200 feet above the sea.
The stems are frequently 
six, and sometimes eight feet in circumference.* The wood is very hard, and is used 
for most of their common work by the peasants.
The other indigenous forest trees 
chiefly belong to the Laurineae.
The Laurus indica, Vinhatigo of the natives, grows 
to an immense size.
Its wood is of a dark colour, and of excellent quality, and is em- 
ployed in various articles of work, under the name of Madeira mahogany.
Of foreign 
trees, the most conspicuous is the chesnut, Castanea vulgaris, which was introduced 
by the early settlers; it forms line woods on the lower parts of the mountains, espe- 
cially in the interior, and on the north coast.'' â€” p.

X. On the Specific Value of the Antherine Appendages in the Genus Viola, 
By Edward Forbes, M.W.S., Foreign Secretary of the Botanical 
Society.
Mr. Forbes observes that " form is the chief if not the only source 
of specific character in the vegetable kingdom : " the higher divisions 
are founded on modifications of the internal structure of plants, but 
in characterizing minor groups and species, we ought rather to attend 
to the modifications of external form.
The reason for this will be 
*Sir J.
E. Smith, in his ' Tour on the Continent,' says â€” " I never saw Erica arbo- 
rea so truly arboreous as in this place, [between Frejus and Cannes].
It was often ten 
feet high, with a trunk three inches in diameter, much resembling, in form and size, 
the trees on Box-hill in Surrey.
I am informed by Dr. Lind, that it grows to a much 
larger size, even 18 inches in diameter, on the Serra at Madeira, 5165 feet above the 
sea."â€” i.
210, Etl. 2.
353 
apparent when we consider that in plants, contrary to what obtains 
among animals, external form itself is often structure, or rather it is 
equivalent to the internal structure of animals : for structure being a 
modification of form for the performance of some function in the eco- 
nomy of the creature, " in animals such modification is usually an in- 
volution of form, in plants the reverse." 
Naturalists are aware that in the lowest as well as in the highest 
groups, whether of plants or animals, there is no organ which is equal- 
ly and uniformly available as affording distinctive characters.
" For 
example, the shape of a leaf in one genus of plants may be common 
to all the included species, and therefore is not a specific character ; 
in the next genus it may vary in each species, and the variation be 
constant in each, becoming the most evident source of distinction be- 
tween the species." This depends on what Mr. Forbes terms " the 
law of undulation of character^'' that is, "either on the adaptation of 
organization to circumstances," or on "modifications of forms &c., of 
no importance in the animal or vegetable economy, though of great 
value as marks to distinguish one original fonn (that is species) from 
another.
In the last case, the character is usually also representative ^ 
that is, it may be the analogue of an organ which plays an important 
part in some other species, group, or type." 
The author has chosen the genus Viola as affording illustrations of 
his positions.
" Among the irregularly-flowered genera of the family of Violarieae, we often find 
certain of the stamina provided with dorsal appendages, styled by some botanists nec- 
taries, which are lodged in the spur of the flower.
In the descriptions of violets, 
mention is rarely made of these bodies, they being generally regarded as of generic 
importance only.
Any one, however, who compares the nectaries of a pansy with 
those of a dog-violet, will see such a difference, as indicates a specific, at any rate, a 
sectional importance.
In order to ascertain the value of the character so derived, I 
have compared minutely above seventy species of violets ; and the results of such com- 
parison, and their application to the elucidation of British Botany, I now lay before 
the Society." â€” p.
77.
1. Form of Nectaries.
In the allies of V.
canina they are lancet- 
shaped, â€” the most common form; in the pansies they are linear; 
and the rarest form is the rotund, found in V.
palustris.
These ai'e 
the only three forms in the genus ; the first varies in length and 
breadth, the linear in length.
2. Relations of Nectary and Spur.
The spur varies in proportion 
according to the form of the nectaries ; " it is usually thick in 
proportion to its length, and very blunt," when the nectaries are lan- 
cet-shaped.
" The rotund nectary is associated with a very short 
2f 
354 
rounded spur, the linear usually with along slender spur, often of great 
length, as in the pansies." 
3. Relation of Nectary and Colour of Flower.
Mr. Forbes is dis- 
posed to consider that gieater importance is due to colour in specific 
distinctions than is usually assigned to it.
" In the genus Viola blue, yellow, purple and white are the colours seen.
The blue 
may again be divided into purple-blue and sky-blue, each passing abnormally into white, 
but the respective whites must not be confounded.
The purple-blue may also pass 
abnonnally into rose ; but the sky-blue, as far as I am aware, never does.
These dis- 
tinctions are of importance in the investigation of nearly allied species, such as V.
ca- 
nina and V.
montana.
The yellow passes on the one hand into white ; on the other, 
into purple.
White is rarely the normal colour of a species of violet.
The lancet- 
shaped nectary is chiefly associated with blue flowers, sometimes with the yellows pass- 
ing into white, never with the yellows which pass into purple.
They have always 
linear nectaries.
The violets, which are normally white, derived from blue, have al- 
ways lanceolate or rotund appendages, never linear.
The odorous violets have always 
purple-blue, or its derivative white flowers, and always lancet-shaped appendages, but 
the colour does not necessarily imply the odour.
The yellows which do not pass into 
purple have always lancet-shaped appendages.
Among the dog-violets we find the lancet- 
shaped appendages lengthening in proportion to the mixture of purple in the blue, and 
the contrary in cerulean flowers, and their derivatives milk-white.
All violets may be 
abnormally white, but the form of the nectary peculiar to the species, does not change 
with the change of colour in the individual." â€” ^p.
79.
4. Relations of Nectary and Leaf.
The cordate leaf in violets 
is generally associated with a lancet-shaped nectary, which is always 
found when the leaf is lanceolate or truly ovate, and sometimes when 
through being deeply lobed a cordate or rotundo-cordate leaf becomes 
pinnato-palmate.
" A iew cordate-leaved violets have linear appen- 
dages, and some of the pinnato-palmate ; but all the pansies, or violets 
with ovato-spathulate leaves have linear nectaries." In the stemless 
species with cordate leaves, "as the leaf becomes more and more 
rounded there is generally a tendency in the nectary to become shorter 
and shorter, whilst the contrary is often the case in such as have stems.
Rotund appendages are associated only with reniform- cordate leaves." 
Mr. Forbes gives a tabular view of " the relations of leaf and nectary 
in seventy-one species of violets." 
5. Relation of Nectary to Bractioles and Stipules.
The relation 
borne by the bractiole to the nectary is one of size, not of position, â€” 
the linear nectary being generally associated with minute bractioles : 
the stipules " are almost always large when the nectary is linear." 
6. Relation of Nectary to Stem.
In the arborescent, and gene- 
rally in the shrubby violets the nectary is lanceolate ; in the more her- 
baceous stemmed species it is usually linear ; while in most of the 
355 
stemless violets, including the odorous species, it is lancet-shaped, in 
a few only being linear.
7. Geographical distribution of VioletSj according to their Nec- 
taries.
â€” 
" Violets are found in most parts of the world, though their distribution is influ- 
enced materially by climate.
The species from tropical countries are mostly from 
localities where the influence of elevation has neutralized or modified the climatal in- 
fluence.
The various sections of the genus have geographic centres, as may be seen in 
the congregations of the allies of hirta in North America, and of those of tricolor in 
alpine Europe.
North America may be looked upon as the capital of the whole genus, 
since we find there representatives of all its subdivisions.
, In the following table the 
distribution of 75 species, according to the form of their nectaries, is exhibited : â€” 
Lancet-shaped .
. Europe, 19 Asia 4 Africa 1 N.
America 22 S.
America I Australia 1 Total 46 
Rotund 2 1 1 4 
Linear 12 4 I 6 23 
8. Applicatioti of the above considerations to the arrangement of 
the Violets.
â€” 
" To group the violets according to the form of the nectary, without considering 
the relation of that form to the other characters of the plant, would be to arrange them 
artificially and not naturally; for then we should have such violets as ochroleuca and 
prionantha associated with the pansies, and other combinations of a similarly unnatu- 
ral character.
But associating the form of the nectaries, with that of the leaf, with 
the colour, and with the geographical distribution, we obtain a very natural arrange- 
ment of the species.
The odorous and hairy violets, presenting short lancet-shaped 
nectaries, cordate leaves, often being hairy, and frequently nearly orbicular, purple- 
blue flowers, no stem, and a centralization of the species in North America, form a 
first group.
The same form of appendage, but usually more developed as to length, 
combined with a cordate or lanceolate leaf, smooth, or slightly hairy, a stem, purple- 
blue or cerulean flowers, and an almost equal distribution in the old and New Worlds, 
indicate a second equally natural, which may be represented by V.
canina.
V. palus- 
tris is the type of a third, and V.
bifiwa oi & fourth ; the former associating a reniform 
leaf with a rotund appendage and a cerulean flower, and the latter a similar leaf with 
an abbreviated lancet-shaped appendage and a yellow flower.
The linear nectary, 
combined with a yellow flower and cordate leaves, fonns a.
fifth; parallel to which may 
be placed (sixth) such as have pinnate leaves, blue flowers and linear nectaries.
Last- 
ly, the pansies fonn a most natural group (seventh) of themselves, presenting us with 
flowers of all colours, linear nectaries, leaves peculiar to themselves, lyrate stipules, 
and a centralization in the mountainous countries of the western portion of the Old 
World."â€” p.

An Attempt to ascertain the true Hypericum quadrangulum of Linneeus.
By Charles C.
Babington, M.A., Cantab., F.L.S., F.G.S., &c.
The author observes that the difficulty attending the determination) 
of the Hypericum quadrangulum of Linnaeus, has arisen from a belief 
356 
that Linnaeus himself referred to different species by that name.
In 
the Linnaean herbarium are two specimens, on " different papers j)in- 
ned together, the first of which is the H.
quadrangulum of Eng. Bot.
(t.
370), and has a number appended referring to the Sp. PL ; the 
other is the H.
duhium of Leers (Eng. Bot.
t. 296), and has the same 
number attached to it, and also the name of " H.
quadrangulumP 
Linnaeus first described his H.
quadrangulum in the 'Hortus Clifforti- 
anus,' (p.
380), where it is said to have ^'^ Folia calycina suhulata^^ 
and Morison (vol.
ii.
t. 6, f.
10) is referred to as the original authority.
Morison's plant is the H.
quadrangulum of Smith, "which has the 
folia calycina suhiilata^'' while in the H.
dubium of Leers and Smith 
they are " broad and very obtuse." Linnaeus, in all his subsequently 
published works, refers to the ' Hortus Cliffortianus ' as the authority 
for his H.
quadrangulum ; and as the plant so named in Smith's works 
and figured in 'English Botany' agrees with that described by Lin- 
naeus in having subulate calyx-leaves, there can be no doubt of its 
being the Linnaean H.
quadrangulum.
Mr. Babington next shows that the plants named H.
duhium by 
Leers and Smith, H.
quadrangulum by Fries and Wahlenberg, H.
maculatmn by Crantz and Allioni, and H.
delphinense by Villars ; â€” 
" constitute two well-defined and truly distinct species," although the 
above names are generally considered synonymous.
The paper con- 
cludes with the descriptions and synonymes of the three species, so 
far as the author has been able to determine the latter, " but in nearly 
all cases, excluding the synonymes cited by the respective authors."

iN'oies on the Distribution of British Ferns.
By H.C. Watson, F.L.S.
Mr. Watson commences his admirable remarks by observing that 
" excepting some spots of small extent, whence they are banished by 
local peculiarities of the surface, ferns may be said to range over the 
whole of Britain, from south to north, from east to west, and from the 
shores of the sea almost to the summits of the loftiest mountains ; from 
which latter situation they are probably absent, rather in consequence 
of the bleak exposure to wind, than of the diminished temperature in- 
cidental to the height of any of our mountains." 
The number of species of British ferns will be variously estimated, 
according to the views entertained by botanists regarding specific li- 
mits.
"The lowest estimate may be taken at 34; which is raised to 
36, by the inclusion of two species now supposed to be extinct, and, 
perhaps, never found wild in England, namely, Asplenium fontanum 
and Trichomanes brevisetum." The latter number will be raised to 
40, by those botanists who regard as distinct species the following 
plants: â€” Polypodium Dryopteris and calcareum; Aspidium lobatum 
and aculeatum ; Asplenium Ruta-muraria and alternifolium ; and Cis- 
topteris fragilis and dentata.
" And the number of 40 would be still 
farther augmented by the addition of four other varieties, which are 
sometimes accepted for species, namely, â€” 
" Aspidium angulare, a variety of A.
aculeatum or lobatum.
" Aspidium dilata turn, ...
A. spinulosum.
" Aspidium dumetomm, ...
A. dilatatum or spinulosum.
" Cistopteris angustata, ...
C. dentata or fragilis.'' 
Then again a few botanists would raise to the rank of species Aspi- 
dium recurvum and Asplenium irriguum ; while others would regard 
as varieties Cistopteris alpina and Woodsia hyperborea ; " but since 
their views are not shared by many, we may hold our ferns to be esti- 
mated at 36, 40, or 44." 
The number of species of indigenous flowering plants would in like 
358 
manner vary, according to the views of the party by whom the esti- 
mate might be made.
" By rigidly excluding all species not fully 
recognised as indigenous, and also numerous varieties which are com- 
monly now counted amongst species, the flowering plants of Britain 
will be found scarcely to exceed 1200; or, admitting doubtful species, 
but still excluding doubtful natives, they may be taken at 1400.
To 
reach the number of 1636, given in the Catalogue printed by the Bo- 
tanical Society of Edinburgh,* we must admit many species of foreign 
introduction, and a goodly list of varieties named and received as spe- 
cies." But in determining the proportion borne by the ferns to the 
flowering plants, " if we take a low estimate for one group, we must 
follow the same rule in the other, or their proportions will unavoidably 
appear wide of truth." The proportions of the two groups taken from 
the three estimates of the number of each given above, will be these.
"ferns.
flowers.
proportions.
36 1200 1 to 33i 
40 1400 1 to 35 
44 1636 1 to 37" 
The author by way of comparison next gives a table showing the 
relative numbers of ferns and flowering plants in eight different Floras ; 
the proportions (omitting fractions) being as under.
Iceland 1 to 25 Channel Isles 1 to 51 Sweden I to 40 
Faroe 1 to 27 Belgium 1 to 67 Lapland 1 to 25 
Ireland I to 30 Zealand 1 to 47 
" Ferns are thus seen to bear a larger proportion relatively to flowering plants, in 
the northern and mountainous parts of Western Europe, than is the case with this 
group of plants in low countries, â€” such as Belgium, Zealand, and the Channel Isles, 
â€” ^whose latitude nearly corresponds with that of England ; whilst the proportions he- 
fore set down for Britain place it in the scale betwixt Faroe and Iceland, on the one 
hand, and Belgium and the Channel Islands on the other; the former having a rela- 
tive predominance of ferns, the latter having a similar predominance of flowering 
plants." â€” p.
91.
It is then shown by a comparison of twenty local Floras, that the 
distribution of ferns in Britain corresponds with their distribution in 
the north-west of Europe generally, since both the relative and abso- 
lute number of species diminish " as we pass from the hilly districts of 
*The 1st edition of the Catalogue is here refeiTed to ; the number of species (1636) 
given in the " Enumeration of Plants " prefixed to the Catalogue appears to include 
the ferns as well as flowering plants.
In the 2nd edition the number of species in the 
two groups is distinctly given us 1594 and 55, (including Lycopodium, Isoetes, Pilu- 
laria and Equisetum).
359 
Scotland and the north and west of England, towards the low south- 
eastern countries lying nearest to Belgium." In Yorkshire, accord- 
ing to the table given, there are 36 ferns and 1002 flowering plants; 
or 1 to 28 : the Faversham and East Kent Flora, on the contrary, fur- 
nishes only 13 ferns and 806 flowering plants, or 1 to 62 : these being 
the extreme proportions afforded by the twenty Floras examined.
â€” 
The Midland Flora has 23 ferns and 840 flowering plants, or 1 to 37.
Mr. Watson remarks that " York is pre-eminently the county of 
ferns; " for although the author of the Yorkshire Flora "has multipli- 
ed species more than many other writers on local Botany," the ferns 
are really most numerous in that county.
This the author attributes 
to various causes, such as its central position, and the diversified cha- 
racter of the country ; " the climate of its low vales being sufficiently 
mild for the growth of species which shun the northern counties of 
Scotland, without being too warm or dry for the growth of boreal spe- 
cies, to which the hilly districts of its western border are particularly 
suited, as well as to the production also of the more exclusively moun- 
tain species." Then again its coast furnishes Asplenium marinum, 
and its various soils and rocks are adapted for those species which are 
attached to particular formations.
In Cambridgeshire there are 14 ferns and 847 flowering plants, or 
the ferns are as 1 to 60.
This paucity of ferns is also explained by a 
reference to the character of the county.
A large portion consists of 
low fens, with but little wood and few hedge-rows; "much of the rest 
is composed of gentle undulations of chalk," of inconsiderable eleva- 
tion, with few trees and little water.
" Moray ranks next to Yorkshire in the high proportion of its ferns," 
(1 to 30).
This is accounted for by "the rigid exclusion of introdu- 
ced species of flowering plants" by the author of the Moray Flora.
â€” 
On the other hand the number of flowering plants in Northumberland 
and Durham is high (1030), in consequence of" the addition of many 
species brought to the coasts of those counties in ship ballast." In 
the absolute number of species (28) the ferns of these counties rank 
next to Yorkshire, although, from the cause above mentioned the pro- 
portion borne by them to flowering plants is much lower, (1 to 37).
It is evident from the variation in the number of ferns in the seve- 
ral districts, that some species must have a partial range ; accordingly 
it appears that " no one of the district Floras includes all the native 
species, whilst about half of these Floras include fewer than half of 
the species." Some species are so widely diffused and so abundant in 
individuals, that they are probably to be found in every county ; others 
360 
again are either confined to a few localities, or have a wide range 
over certain parts of the island although excluded from others.
A table is next given wherein are enumerated fortj-three species, 
showing in how many of the twenty local Floras before mentioned, 
and in what number of twenty-four manuscript lists, the name of 
each species occurs.
By this means may be gained a tolerably cor- 
rect idea of the range of our native ferns ; although, as the author ob- 
serv^es, " without regard to the distinctness of the species, the dates of 
their first discovery, and the certainty of their nomenclature," errone- 
ous conclusions might be drawn from the list.
Pteris aquilina, Polypodium vulgare and Aspidium Filix-mas are 
the only three species " so universally distributed as to be included in 
all the forty-four district Floras and lists." But although these are 
our three commonest ferns, yet to neither of them does the widest ge- 
ographical range in Britain belong.
" The most widely ranging of 
our native ferns, taking into view the three directions of latitude, lon- 
gitude and elevation, are Blechnum boreale and Aspidium dilatatum 
(or spinulosum)." 
" It has been already stated that ferns prevail chiefly in the hilly tracts towards the 
north and west, and that they are less numerous in the low south-eastern counties of 
England, â€” a peculiarity that is doubtless in great measure attributable to the more 
humid and cooler atmosphere of the former.
The three circumstances on which this 
difference of climate depends, are those of latitude and longitude, conjointly with ele- 
vation of the surface ; and the influence of these three conditions in producing the ge- 
neral result, will scarcely admit of divided consideration.
We may, indeed, trace some 
agreement betwixt the range of certain species and the geographical divisions of lati- 
tude and longitude ; yet this connexion (or, more strictly, this coincidence) is so much 
interfered with by the third condition, that of height, as to render separate investiga- 
tion almost useless." â€” p.
97.
In proof of these positions it is remarked that about half the num- 
ber of indigenous ferns are absent from the English counties lying to 
the east of Gloucestershire and Nottinghamshire ; " whilst none of the 
species found growing in these south-eastern counties are wholly want- 
ing in those to the westward of them ; most of these species also being 
much more plentiful in the western counties." The paucity of ferns 
in the south-eastern counties is accounted for by the different cha- 
racter of the surface, owing to the absence of rocky ravines, waterfalls 
and mountain elevations, and the consequent dryness of atmosphere, 
rather than by the difference of longitude.
Nor is the northern or southern limit of a fern's range altogether 
to be determined by the degree of latitude, though they may be more 
361 
decidedly traced than the longitudinal boundaries ; yet even m this 
case the author states the lines of cessation to be determined more by 
" the hilly and broken character of the surface " than by the degree 
of latitude ; and instances the hills of Wales as bringing " several spe- 
cies into a more southern latitude than it is at all likely they vs^ould 
have been found in, if Wales and the adjacent English counties had 
been as little diversified with high hills as are the counties under the 
same latitude on the eastern side of the island." 
" The effect of the mountains, however, is prohably much more decidedly shown in 
prolonging the southern range than in arresting the northern range of ferns ; since the 
low coast-line, as weU as small plains and valleys around, or amongst the hills, may 
still afford suitable localities for such ferns as are unfitted to bear the climate of the 
mountain summits or acclivities, although capable of growing in the climate inciden- 
tal to the latitude." â€” p.
98.
The author's classification of ferns according to their range in Bri- 
tain, and his observations, are very interesting.
Those are first given 
which " may be considered to have a range of latitude almost through 
the whole of Britain." â€” 
Cistopteris fragilis Osmunda regalis Aspidium dilatatum 
Polypodium Phegopteris Scolopendrium vulgare Asplenium Filix-foemina 
vulgare Hymenophyllum Wilsoni Trichomanes 
Pteris aquilina Aspidium lobatum Ruta-mumria 
Blechnum boreale Oreopteris Adiantum-nigrum 
Botrychium Lunaria Filix-mas marinum 
Ophioglossum vulgatum spinulosum 
Four of the above twenty species " are very rare in the south of 
England, namely, Botrychium Lunaria, Cistopteris fragilis, Hymeno- 
phyllum Wilsoni and Polypodium Phegopteris, especially the last ; 
and they are not found at all in the Channel Isles." Asplenium ma- 
rinum, Scolopendrium vulgare, Ophioglossum vulgatum and Osmunda 
regalis, are decidedly rare in the north of Scotland, " and they are not 
found at all in the Faroe isles, though the Ophioglossum is stated to 
grow in Iceland." 
The following are " boreal and mountain ferns, which are unknown 
southward of the Thames." â€” 
Woodsia hyperborea Cistopteris dentata Asplenium septentrionale 
ilvensis Polypodium Dryopteris Aspidium Lonchitis 
Cistopteris alpina Asplenium viride Cryptogramma crispa 
Four species are given as being chiefly " confined to the middle la- 
titudes of Britain." â€” 
2g 
Aspidium cristatum Asplenium alternifoHuni 
rigiduni Polypodium calcareum 
Four species " affect the southern, or southern and midland counties, 
being absent from the northern counties." â€” 
Adiantum Capillus- Veneris Aspidium Thelypteris 
Asplenium lanceolatum Grammitis Ceterach 
Of four others either the range is undeterminedj or their specific 
distinctness is questionable.
â€” 
Hymenophyllum tunbridgense Aspidium angulare 
Aspidium aculeatum dumetorum 
" Two remaining species, if ever found in England, and not now 
extinct, are exceedingly local in the north of England." â€” 
Asplenium fontanum Trichomanes 'breTisetum 
The author observes that more complete and accurate observations 
are yet required " with regard to the limits of ferns in ascending the 
mountains ; " and refers to Francis's * Analysis of British Fems ' as 
containing nearly all that has been published on the subject.
Five 
are mentioned as certainly rising " almost to the summits of the high- 
est hills in Scotland," being found at an elevation of between 3000 
and 4000 feet ; the two first probably above 4000 feet.
Cryptogramma crispa Aspidium (dilatatum ?) 
Blechnum boreale Lonchitis 
Polypodium Phegopteris 
The following occur " at a lower elevation, but still probably above 
2000 feet, and some perhaps above 3000 feet." â€” 
Botrychium Lunaria Asplenium viride Cistopteris fragilis 
Woodsia hyperborea Cistopteris alpina Polypodium vulgare 
ilrensis deutata 
" On quitting the mountain tracts, we leave the four following spe- 
cies behind us : " â€” 
Woodsia hyperborea Aspidium Lonchitis 
ilvensis Asplenium viride 
Two others, being rare on the isolated lower hills, may be classed 
with the mountain ferns.
â€” 
Cryptogramma crispa Asplenium septentrionale 
a63 
Eight species, found chiefly in the hilly districts of the north and 
west, yet occasionally occur " so far from the mountain tracts, that they 
cannot be held in the character of exclusively mountain ferns." â€” 
Cistopteris alpina Hymenophyllura Wilsoni Polypodium calcareum 
dentata Polypodium Phegopteris Botrychium Lunaria 
fragilis Dryopteris 
It is next remarked that " under the combined influence of latitude 
and longitude, thus modified by the effect of elevation of surface, the 
lower limits of many ferns, equally as those of flowering plants, ap- 
pear on a map like irregular lines, whose general direction runs from 
south-west to north-east ; whilst their upper limits encircle the hills, 
or the hilly tracts, like zones or belts." It must not, however, be 
supposed that by terminal lines are to be understood any others than 
" artificial lines, drawn on a map, so as to connect the extreme sta- 
tions for any species in either direction." Also the terms upper and 
lower limits are to be understood as applying " to latitude, to eleva- 
tion above the sea-level, and also in some measure to the degree of 
proximity to the mountain tracts." In the neighbourhood of the lat- 
ter a great change in the character of the Flora of a district becomes 
evident, although the latitude and absolute elevation remain nearly 
the same.
Thus the upper limit of British plants will include, unless 
otherwise qualified, the three conditions of more northern latitude, in- 
creased elevation and greater proximity to mountain tracts.
Again, 
by the lower limits are to be understood " the opposite conditions of 
southern latitude, diminished elevation, and also comparative remote- 
ness from the mountain tracts, as centres around which the species are 
distributed." 
These explanations being kept in view, it will be seen to be impos- 
sible at present to represent on maps the distribution of British plants 
with anything like accuracy, " in consequence of the upper limits of 
most of the species being yet so little known." Their upper limits in 
latitude might be traced pretty accurately ; and an approximation to 
their altitude above the sea-level might be arrived at ; but the diffi- 
culty would be to determine their propinquity to the mountain cen- 
tres.
This can only be ascertained when botanists shall carefully re- 
cord the places where plants of the plains are last seen by them, as 
they enter amongst the valleys of the mountain districts.
" As an example of such difficulties, let us take Scolopendrium vulgare, a fern 
widely diffused in Britain from Orkney to the Isle of Wight, and abundant in the 
south of England.
Betwixt these extreme points, however, there are many wide spaces 
364 
I'roin which this fern is wholly absent ; and one of these spaces perhaps includes nearly 
the whole of the Highlands.
The Scolopendrium is reported to grow in the counties 
of Renfrew, Lanark, Edinburgh, Forfar, Nairn and Orkney, and thus seems partially 
to encircle the Highlands.
But whether its extreme stations, or upper limits towards 
the mountain centres, are found in these counties, remains to he shown.
Again, Pte- 
ris aquilina is exceedingly plentiful in Britain, from one extremity to the other, but 
it fails upon the higher hills of Wales, the north of England, and the Scottish High- 
lands ; and may even prove to be wholly absent from a transverse belt of high moors 
and hills crossing Scotland about the 57th parallel of latitude.
But what botanist can 
trace on a map of Britain those portions of the surface from which this very conspicuous 
fern is quite absent ?
" â€” p.
103.
" In returning from this digression respecting maps to the immediate subject of 
the present paper, it may be farther observed, that ferns, as a class of plants, cannot 
be exclusively connected with any particular local situation or quality of soil.
For 
the most part, a shady situation, damp ground and atmosphere, and a porous or peaty 
soil, are suitable to ferns ; whilst exposure to sun, wind, and salt spray, as well as very 
dry or marshy localities, are unsuitable.
But some of the Asplenia grow in dry cre- 
vices of rocks and walls, as also do Grammitis Ceterach, Polypodium Dryopteris, and 
Polypodium calcareum, and even the less rigid ferns constituting the genus Cistopte- 
ris.
On the contrary, Osmunda regalis might almost be designated a marsh fern ; 
and other species so far approximate to the same character, as to thrive in swampy 
ground, that is, in watery places, where the soil is loose and spongy ; for example, 
Aspidium Thelypteris.
But ferns that grow well in swampy places will also grow 
well on rocks and banks where the soil is not particularly wet ; for instance, Blechnum 
boreale and Asplenium Filix-foemina.
None are aquatics.
One only is a littoral spe- 
cies, Asplenium marinum ; and this one is occasionally seen in places many miles 
from the sea.
Osmunda regalis so frequently occurs near the shore, within reach 
of the salt spray, and even at times within reach of high tides, that it might be regard- 
ed as a sub-littoral species.
None perhaps require the sun's rays directly shining upon 
them ; but some few will bear daily exposure to the sun for several hours, though the 
greater number thrive best on a slender allowance of sunshine.
It cannot yet be stat- 
ed that any species are absolutely limited to soils of a particular chemical or geognos- 
tic character ; but Grammitis Ceterach, Polypodium calcareum, and the species of 
Cistopteris, certainly affect lime rocks, though, indeed, it is believed by some bota- 
nists, that the Polypodium calcareum is a variety of P.
Dryopteris, varied in its habit 
through the influence of soil or exposure.
If so, the only species that is limited to 
limestone, if even it be so limited, is Grammitis Ceterach.
The harder kinds of trap 
and slate rocks seem favourable to Asplenium septentrionale and Woodsia ilvensis.
â€” 
And, in general, the sand-stones are more productive of ferns than chalk or clays ; 
though the difference here is probably owing more to the mechanical than to the che- 
mical qualities of the soils." â€” p.

New Locality for Halimus pedunculatus .
â€” I have much pleasure in sending 
you what is, I believe, an unrecorded station for the rare Halimus pedunculatus.
I 
found it in August last, growing not very plentifully in the salt marsh about two miles 
below Gravesend.

on their specific identity, but merely to call the attention of botanists to the capsules 
of the plants belonging to this genus, perhaps some of us will be able to make out the 
number of seeds contained in each.

Anagallis arvensis with White Flowers.
In the course of one of my rambles 
this month, I gathered a specimen of Anagallis arvensis, answering precisely to that 
described by Sir W.
Hooker, viz., the " flowers pure white, with a small, well-defined, 
bright purplish-pink eye in the centre of every corolla,'' said to have been found by 
Mr. John Dillwyn, at Penllegare, S.
Wales.
I coidd find but one plant, but I shall 
examine the field carefully next year, and earlier in the season, as my specimen had 
only two flowers on it, the rest having formed capsules.
I should imagine that the 
specimen gathered by Mr. Dillwyn is the only one upon record.

Mr. Thomas Twining, jun., exhibited a large collection of cultivated specimens 
from Twickenham.
A paper was read from Mr. R.
S. Hill, being " An Enquiry into 
Vegetable Morphology.'' 
Morphology is that division of Botany which takes cognizance of the various 
changes which occur in the condition of the vegetable organs, both such as are nor- 
mal, as the transmutation of leaves into the several floral organs, as well as such as 
are abnormal, and occur only accidentally.
Taking the above as the definition of the subject, we immediately see its divisibi- 
lity into two heads ; the first of which treats of regular metamorphoses, which are con- 
nected with the natural structure of all vegetables : while the second includes those 
irregular or accidental metamorphoses, which result from an imperfect or redundant 
perfonnance of the several changes noticed under the first head.
These last influence 
particular plants, or parts of plants, and occur only in occasional instances.
To this 
division belongs the consideration of double and other monstrous flowers.
Of regular Metamorphosis.
â€” The great principle of regular Morphology is, that the 
various floral organs are but modifications of one common type, which is the leaf.
Lindley endeavours to give to Linnaeus the credit of having been the author, or at 
least of haviug suggested the idea of this great fundamental principle ; and in proof 
of this opinion quotes passages from his ' Systema Naturae ' and ' Prolepsis Planta- 
rum,' in which the theory is imperfectly hinted at.
At his suggestion the subject does 
not seem to have been taken up ; nor was it at all until Goethe published in 1770 his 
work ' On Vegetable Metamorphosis.' With a knowledge of the character of his poe- 
tical writings, it hardly need excite surprise that botanists of the day should have been 
sceptical on a subject so new, and at first sight so opposed to the dictates of common 
sense ; and that his work at the time should have been considered to partake of the 
fanciful character of his poetry ; or that they should regard it more as a poetical dream 
than as a sober philosophical truth, in connexion with a natural science.
Leaves are in many instances entirely wanting, or exist only in the degenerated 
forms of scales and spines.
In these cases there is hardly any part of a plant which 
is not capable of being modified and rendered capable of performing the functions of 
leaves.
For this purpose we find the excessive development of the stem which obtains 
throughout lactaceous plants; also the stem is furnished with leafy wings or expan- 
sions which run down its sides, as is seen in Acacia alata, &c.
The petiole, in the 
form of the phyllodium, frequently takes upon itself the ofiice of the leaf, as in most 
of the Acacias from New Holland.
The same functions are frequently discharged by 
the peduncle, as in Ruscus, Asparagus, &c.
; and this appears to be the true charac- 
ter of the leafy organs of Ferns, the true leaves of which exist in the degenerated form 
of scales known by the name of ramenta.
The evidence of the identity of bracteae with leaves is more apparent than that of 
many of the other organs, for in very many plants they difi"er but little, except in size,, 
from the original type, and indeed in almost every instance, even among those which 
are highly coloured, as in many of the genus Salvia, we find presented a gradual tran- 
sition from the fonn and colour of the leaf to an almost petaloid condition ; Salvia 
splcHdens and Sclarea are both good examples of this.
The position of these organs on 
the axis shows clearly their close analogy to leaves, for they usually follow more or less 
the normal position of the leaves of the species, whether alternate or opposite.
The 
calyx consists of a series of leaves arranged in a whorled manner round the axis, either 
368 
distinct, or more or less combined, according to the character of the plant under con- 
sideration.
Examples of partial reversion of calyx to the character of the leaf are seen 
in specimens of Trifolium repens, the Polyanthus of the gardens, and in cultivated roses.
In monstrous specimens we sometimes meet with the petals becoming leafy, of the 
occurrence of which in Anetnone nemorosa M.
DeCandoUe has represented a remarka- 
ble example ; and the author had seen the same condition occurring in the petals of 
Papaver Argemone.
Stamens appear to be formed from petals by the gradual narrowing of their lower 
part, so as to form the filament, while the anthers develope themselves on the upper 
margins.
Nympecea alba affords a beautiful example of the gradual transition of all 
the floral organs ; and in it this transmutation of petals into stamens is clearly seen, 
the petals at first become narrower, then one of the margins has an abortive anther 
developed on it, to this another is afterwards added on the opposite margin, and finally 
the contraction of the petal having completely taken place, a perfect stamen is deve- 
loped.
The petaloid cup which is found in the genus Narcissus is formed from an addi- 
tional row of three stamens, as is evident from the frequent division of this organ into 
three pieces, which alternate with the divisions of the corolla.
The only instance with which the author was acquainted, wherein the carpellary 
leaf is to be found in an extended or unfolded state, naturally occurs in the order Co- 
niferae, where it simply covers but does not enclose the ovules.
The carpellary leaf in 
this condition manifestly approaches a bractea.
The conversion of the pistil into a leaf is likewise frequently seen in Trifolium re- 
pens ; and the author has a specimen of a species of Potentilla, which exhibits this 
change in a remarkable degree.
It was announced that the paper would be continued at the next meeting.
Mr. Adam White laid before the Society a selection of the plants he had lately 
found in a walk from Whiting Bay, Isle of Arran, to Brodick, and from Brodick to 
the top of Goatfell.
He alluded to the strangely contrasted climates of Arran, arising 
partly from its insular position and its alpine mountains ; he exhibited a few lichens, 
mosses, and pheenogamic plants peculiar to alpine districts, and at the same time from 
the garden of Mr. Paterson of Whitehouse, Lamlash, laid before the meeting dried 
specimens of two species of Leptospe^inum from New Holland, one of them believed 
to be new, as well as of three or four other New Holland plants, the names of which 
were as yet unascertained.
He particularly referred to the fine plants of warmer re- 
gions reared by Mr. Paterson in the open air, some of which stand the winter without 
shelter ; as instances he referred to two species of Salvia, Pentstemon, diC, and exhibit- 
ed luxuriant sprigs of Fuschsias, one of which was taken from a tree-like shrub, 18 
feet high, and 22 feet wide, which, in its native soil, could scarcely have been more 
luxuriant.
The damp atmosphere, he remarked, so different to their own dry climate, 
prevented some of the New Holland plants from flowering, but, he added, their luxu- 
riant foliage and strong shoots nearly compensated for this.
He alluded to the lists 
of the rarer plants found in the island, and communicated by the Eev. David Lands- 
borough to Dr. M'Naughton, for insertion in his account of Kilbride (one of the island 
parishes) published in the ' New Statistical Account of Scotland,' and mentioned that 
he had been lately informed that Professor Gardner of Glasgow, in company with the 
minister of Stevenston, had found Funaria Muhlenbergii, a rather scarce moss, in 
tolerable plenty.

â€” Description of Equisetum hyemalCi Mackaii and vari- 
egatiim^ as found on the hanks and in the bed of the River Dee; 
with addition'al observations.
By J.
B. Brichan.
Equisetum hyemale.
Root creeping, jointed, branched.
Stems several from one branch 
of the root, or branched at the base, one to three feet high, or upwards, 
stout, erect or decumbent, articulated and fluted, occasionally throw- 
ing out catkins or very small branches near the top.
Ridges or 
furrows fourteen to twenty-one in number, in luxuriant specimens 
twenty-eight ; ridges grooved, and, as well as the furrows, grained like 
a file.
Sheaths widest at top, at first pale green, with a black crenate 
rim ; afterwards entirely black ; ultimately white, with a broad black 
band at the base, the rim remaining black as before.
The uppermost 
sheaths of the root generally, and the upper and lower of the younger 
stems occasionally, bear black, membranous, flexuose, deciduous teeth 
or bristles.
The sheath of the catkin is invariably and persistently 
toothed.
Catkins terminal, more rarely lateral, and in that case either 
single or in opposite pairs.
Equisetum Mackaii.
Root creeping, jointed, branched.
Stems several from one branch 
of the root, or branched at the base, slender, often filiform, erect or 
decumbent, one to two and a half feet high, consisting of articulations 
from one to two and a half inches in length.
The older stems fre- 
quently throw out long slender branches, which generally bear cat- 
kins.
The stems are fluted, the ridges grooved, and both ridges and 
furrows grained as in E.
hyemale.
Number of ridges or furrows eight 
to twelve.
Sheaths cylindrical, at first pale or yellowish green, with 
a narrow black band immediately under the teeth ; ultimately wholly 
black, with the lower border of the black entire.
Teeth equal in 
number to the ridges, membranaceous, white at the edge, long and 
tapering, terminating in a flexuose bristle which is generally black, 
2h 
370 
but sometimes white, in which case the white margin of the teeth is 
broader : they often adhere in pairs, and are decidedly persistent.
â€” 
Catkins terminal, either on the stems or on the branches.
Equisetum variegatum.
Root creeping, jointed, branched.
Stems many, three to twenty 
inches long, branched at the base and upwards, generally but not in- 
variably decumbent and filiform, rather brittle, consisting of numerous 
fluted articulations, half an inch to an inch and a half long.
Ridges 
or furrows five to nine, the former grooved, and both grained as in 
E. hyemale and E.
Mackaii.
Sheaths slightly swollen upwards, the 
upper half black.
Lower border of the black waved or toothed, the 
dentations alternating with the teeth, and, like them, equal in number 
to the ridges.
The teeth are distinct, never adhering, obtuse, some- 
what ovate, black in the centre, with a broad, white, membranous 
margin, and tipped with a short bristle, which is either black or white, 
and more or less deciduous, while the teeth themselves are persistent.
Catkins terminal, rather large in proportion to the size of the plant.
These descriptions are intended to apply to the plants only " as 
found on the banks and in the bed of the river Dee," and as seen ei- 
ther with the naked eye or through a small lens.
I have endeavoured 
to exclude everything that could not with propriety be admitted as a 
specific distinction.
The characters which I have given, and which 
I find to be constant, together with the various circumstances noticed 
in what follows, have led me to the conclusion that the three plants 
are well entitled to be ranked as distinct species.
I conceive that the 
main strength of my position lies in the fact, that amidst all the va- 
rieties of size and shape which each plant presents, the distinctive 
characters remain the same.
The species never shade off into one 
another, the smallest specimen of the largest species being readily 
distinguished from any specimen of the other two ; while, on the other 
hand, the stoutest stems of E.
Mackaii and variegatum can at once be 
recognized as distinct from each other, and from the slenderer stems 
of E.
hyemale.
The following additional remarks apply chiefly to the 
situation, stems, sheaths, catkins and branching.
Situation.
â€” The three plants are found at various parts along the 
course of the Dee, within the parish of Banchory, extending over a 
space of six or seven miles in length.
There are three distinct sta- 
tions for E.
hyemale, four for E.
Mackaii, three for E.
variegatum.
371 
and several intermediate spots in which detached plants of each spe- 
cies or variety, especially of E.
Mackaii, occur.
I have no doubt 
whatever that both above and below the part where these stations are, 
there exist other localities hitherto unrecorded.
In no instance have 
I seen E.
hyemale associated with either of the other two, although E.
Mackaii grows in its immediate vicinity.
In two of the localities E.
Mackaii and variegatum grow together, sometimes in juxta-position 
so close that they seem to spring from the same root.
The three grow 
both upon the banks of the river and in the water, E.
hyemale being 
generally highest and driest, whilst E.
variegatum shows most of a 
tendency to take the water.
The former seems to attain its largest 
growth among loose dry earth, especially where it finds shelter among 
large stones and trees or bushes, and insinuates its long straggling 
roots between and under the stones.
E. Mackaii appears to prefer a 
locality where water, oozing from the bank, forms a green moist spot, 
or finds its way through a rent made by the river, or a channel worn 
by itself.
The water where E.
Mackaii thus fixes its habitat, is 
generally, if not invariably, chalybeate, being accompanied by that 
orange-coloured mineral or vegetable substance, and exhibiting on its 
surface that bluish-grey silvery scum, both of which are said to indi- 
cate the presence of iron.
On the brink and in the cavities of such a 
spot the plant luxuriates freely, and assumes all its different forms, â€” 
short, tall and branched.
E. variegatum is found in similar situations, 
generally running farther into the river, and the roots of both plants 
are frequently stained with the orange- coloured matter just mentioned.
E. variegatum manifests a disposition to run its roots under large 
stones and grow beneath their shelter, where, and in the water, it is 
most luxuriant.
From the stations assigned to it I am inclined to 
think that its natural habitat is " on the banks and in the bed " of 
rivers ; and that, when found among sand, it has been carried down 
by the stream at whose mouth it grows : its greater growth in water 
seems to favour this conclusion.
I think that when E.
hyemale and 
E. Mackaii grow entirely in water, they are much smaller than in their 
pecuhar situations already described.* 
* Since writing the above I have seen another station for Equisetum Mackaii, and 
one for E.
hyemale, both farther down the river.
In these both plants grow more 
sparingly, â€” E.
hyemale upon a hard, dry, grassy bank, decumbent, almost prostrate, 
and much more slender than usual ; E.
Mackaii in the immediate neighbourhood of 
mineral water, but growing partly, as it does in some of the other stations, among loose 
stones in the river's bed, and also nearly prostrate.
372 
Stems.
â€” The longest stem of E.
hyemale I could find measured 
three feet two inches : it consisted of eighteen articulations.
Several 
other stems measured nearly three feet in length.
The longest articu- 
lation on any stem examined was about three and a half inches; occa- 
sionally a very short internode occurs among the rest, and there are 
sometimes two or three such in succession.
The thickest stem I observed was, in various respects, peculiar.
It 
was composed of eleven principal articulations, the seventh of which, 
broken by accident, was bent at about a right angle to the lower part 
of the stem.
The eleventh articulation was about one inch in length, 
and in it was inserted a sort of double stem, or rather a couple of 
stems, one of which, about one fourth the diameter of the original, 
consisted of four short articulations, having about twenty striae, all 
that remained of the other being the decayed basal sheath.
The bro- 
ken internode and sheath were wet with an orange-coloured liquid, 
which, when touched, stained the hand.
The cause seemed to be, 
that rain had lodged in the sheath and spread itself over part of the 
internode.
Both, when dry, were partly quite black and partly of an 
orange colour.
Does this indicate the presence of iron in the plant ?
I have already mentioned the fact, that I generally find E.
Mackaii 
and E.
variegatum in the vicinity of water impregnated with that 
mineral.
Another stem, growing in the river, had but five articulations, the 
upper part having decayed.
At the top of the fifth articulation there 
were two opposite branches, the one upwards of thirteen inches long, 
the other rather shorter, each having twelve articulations, besides the 
black radical sheath.
The sheaths of the main stem had fallen off, 
and a few setiform black teeth were present on the upper and lower 
sheaths of the two branches.
The standard or normal number of striae both on this plant and on 
the other two, appears not to depend either on the length or thickness 
of the stem.
The greatest number I have found on one of the most 
luxuriant stems, but not the stoutest, is twenty-eight; the smallest 
number, but not on the smallest stem, fourteen.
On some of the most 
slender stems 1 have counted twenty-one, which I consider the stan- 
dard number.
The striae diminish in breadth, but not generally in 
number, as they approach the top of the stem, nor is the greatest num- 
ber always found on the thickest internode.
Taking an average stem 
of each plant, E.
hyemale appears to have the narrowest ridges; E.
Mackaii the widest ridges and narrowest furrows ; E.
variegatum, 
ridges and furrows of nearly equal width, and, if there is any differ- 
373 
ence, rather broader than those of E.
hyemalc.
From this cause 
stems of E.
Mackaii and variegatum can at once be distingaished, at 
least in their recent state, by holding them between the eye and a 
light; E.
Mackaii appears almost quite opaque, the furrows being 
scarcely seen, while E.
variegatum and E.
hyemale under the same 
circumstances appear semitransparent.
No stem of E.
Mackaii that I have seen deserves a particular de- 
scription.
The longest I measured was two feet five and a half inches 
in length, the next longest two feet four inches.
The number of arti- 
culations is about the same as in E.
hyemale, the terminal one, when 
in fruit, being usually much longer than in the latter plant.
The 
standard number of striae I take to be eleven.
Of E.
variegatum I have found no stem longer than about twenty 
inches, exclusive of the smallest portion of the root ; the usual length 
is from three to ten.
On one of the longest stems I have counted up- 
wards of thirty articulations, the shortest has no fewer than eight ; 
the terminal articulation, when bearing a catkin, is longer in propor- 
tion to the size of the plant than that of E.
hyemale.
It is likewise 
as stout as any on the same stem, often the stoutest of all.
The stan- 
dard number of striae is eight.
The structure of the cuticle is undoubtedly the same in each species 
or variety ; the largest plant having the narrowest stria;.
In all, the 
furrows are more minutely grained than the ridges.
It appears to me, 
however, that the structure of the cuticle in all the Equiseta is more 
or less the same, though the siliceous tubercles may not be disposed 
with the same regularity.
Sheaths.
â€” These in E.
hyemale have only two thirds of their length 
coloured differently from the internodes ; in E.
Mackaii two thirds or 
one half; in E.
variegatum never above one half: the lower third or 
half being concolorous.
In this I think they differ from some of the 
other Equiseta, whose sheaths are wholly coloured in a different man- 
ner from the stems.
The colour changes according to the growth of 
the plant, as above described.
After a good deal of searching, and examination of many specimens, 
I have not found the semblance of teeth upon the sheaths of E.
hye- 
male, except on one or two of the younger stems and branches, and 
generally on the upper and lower sheaths.
When present they are 
wholly black, subulate, and flexuose ; they are extremely fugacious, 
and, from their rare occurrence, appear to me to be quite accidental.
The sheath which embraces the catkin has always rather large, coarse, 
black, flexuose, ])ersistent teeth, unlike the delicate membranaceous 
374 
teeth of E.
Mackaii and variegatum The sheaths, havmg first split 
longitudinally along the furrows, fall off before the plant has decayed.
The sheaths of E.
Mackaii invariably bear teeth such as are de- 
scribed above.
They remain longer on the plant than those of E.
hyemale, and the teeth and bristles seldom, if ever, fall off before them.
In E.
variegatum the bristle alone is usually deciduous.
The teeth 
remain till the sheaths decay, which they do in the same manner as in 
E. Mackaii.
In both the teeth of the uppermost sheath differ from 
the rest, only in being larger and in having shorter bristles.
The sheaths of all three turn more or less white before their final 
decay.
When they begin to split or fall off, the part of the internodes 
which they have covered is of a pale green colour, like that of the 
sheath in its first stage.
Soon after it begins to turn black and swell, 
and thus the plants in extreme old age become bent and geniculated.
This, however, is quite different from the sinuous appearance which 
the stem sometimes assumes when in perfect vigour.
Catkins.
â€” These, like the other parts of the plant, are well de- 
scribed by Mr. Newman.
While the catkins of E.
hyemale, in one of 
the stations on the Dee, expand freely and shed their seed or pollen, 
I have not in any case observed those of E.
Mackaii or variegatum to 
expand at all.
They appear to ripen without expanding or rising 
fully out of the sheath.
On the top of many stems of E.
hyemale I observed a pile of small, 
dark brown, membranous, elastic, conical, inverted sheaths, of the 
same substance as the teeth of the sheath which embraces the catkin, 
increasing in width upwards, and so closely embracing each other that 
the rim only of each is seen, except the highest and largest, which 
gives the top of the pile a conical shape.
Although scarcely an inch 
in length, it resembles an inverted abortion of the plant.
Its lower 
end is at first inserted in the uppermost sheath, and surrounded by 
several small sheaths of a texture similar to its own, and placed within 
each other.
It is afterwards quite protruded, and gradually falls off, 
leaving a flexuose apex, somewhat like that of the catkin, whose for- 
mation I am persuaded it precedes.
On dissecting the top of several 
stems from which the pile of cones seemed but recently to have fallen, 
I found the germ of the catkin completely enclosed within its sheath, 
the teeth of which, not yet separate, form by their union the apex 
which appears when the pile falls off.
Dissection, however, when 
the cones are present, seems often to discover an abortive germ.
The 
number of inverted sheaths in one of these piles is about twelve ; what 
375 
Iheir peculiar function may be I cannot even conjecture : T do not 
find anything analogous either on E.
Mackaii or on E.
variegatum.* 
Branching.
â€” On what the branching depends I am unable to say.
It is sometimes not easy to distinguish between branches and stems ; 
the only distinction I can suggest seems almost a truism.
Stems arise 
from the root, and branches from the stem.
As the root is always black, 
they can therefore be in general distinguished, if this method of distinc- 
tion is attended to.
And I think it will generally be found that E.
va- 
riegatum is the only plant of the three that can strictly be said to branch 
from the base, inasmuch as it does so in all circumstances, while the 
other two can scarcely be said to throw out basal branches, except 
when the stem has been broken off, or has decayed almost at the root.
The three are occasionally branched near the top of the stem.
With 
respect especially to E.
hyemale and Mackaii, it may be said that this 
appears, in every instance, an effort of the plant to prolong its exis- 
tence.
It is always in older or broken stems that such branching takes 
place.
E. hyemale is least subject to this manner of growth, and 
when branched, rarely throws out more than a single branch.
I have 
not observed one above two or three inches long, except in the solita- 
ry instance of the stem before described.
Sometimes, instead of a 
branch, a single catkin, and more rarely a pair of opposite catkins, 
appears.
E. Mackaii is, for the most part, unbranched, but of the three it is 
most liable to branching from the upper part of the stem.
In this 
case the most frequent number of branches is three, and these, spring- 
* Subsequent observation has enabled me to ascertain the following facts.
The 
sheaths which in E.
hyemale surround the base of the pile of cones, are the rudiments 
of several of the upper articulations of the stem.
The base of the pile embraces the 
rim of the innermost sheath, and within these the catkin and its sheath are, in their 
geiTOinal state, completely enclosed.
It is only when these incipient internodes prove 
abortive, that they appear of a texture similar to that of the crowning deciduous pile.
Thei/ are entirely destitute of teeth.
The apex of the stem of E.
Mackaii, previously to the appearance of the catkin, 
proves, when dissected, to be composed of the converging teeth of a sheath which en- 
closes several others disposed in a similar way, and having long, black, subulate teeth, 
like its own.
As in E.
hyemale, the germ of the catkin is found within, thus pro- 
tected in its embryo state.
The manner of growth in E.
variegatum is exactly the 
same, but the teeth in every stage are somewhat white at the edge.
What length of time stems thus gradually developed require to attain their full 
growth, I cannot say.
This, aud many other particulars respecting these plants, might 
form very interesting subjects of observation to those by whom they are cultivated, or 
to those who have leisure to study them in their natural state.
376 
ing from different parts one above another, are either horizontal, or 
vertical, or variously inclined.
Sometimes there is but one branch, 
sometimes there are four, of which two are occasinally opposite.
They 
generally, but not always, bear catkins, and that more abundantly than 
those of the other two varieties.
The general length of the branches 
is from three to seven inches ; sometimes it is a foot or upwards.
E. variegatum, as already observed, naturally branches from the 
base, and, it may be added, from all parts of the stem.
Its branches 
vary in length from one to fifteen inches.
I know not whether the 
following description be worth notice, but it may perhaps illustrate 
the mode of growth frequently adopted by the plant, and the difficulty 
of distinguishing between stems and branches.
On part of an as- 
cending root five inches long, growing at the side of a large stone al- 
most in the water, I found eight distinct ramifications.
The four low- 
est were simple and perfect, the other four broken, or decayed, and 
branched.
The lowest of the latter had three undivided branches j 
the next, which rose from a branch of the root, had seven branches, 
two of which had each a branchlet : the next had one divided branch, 
and the highest had three branches, one of which was divided.
Be- 
sides all these it threw out another root, which bore the remainder of 
a branched stem.
A piece of the stem which formed a continuation 
of the primary root remained in a decayed state, and also appeared to 
have been branched.
None of the ramifications exceeded a few inches 
in length.
Mr. Newman has kindly furnished me with specimens of the Dublin 
Canal plant, which he considers a variety distinct from that which 
grows in the Dee. To me they appear identical ; that from Dublin 
being not more luxuriant than many specimens I have gathered here.
Some of the remarks now made may appear unimportant, and even 
puerile ; but in so far as they contain facts, they must possess at least 
some value, and perhaps there is not too much presumption in the 
hope that they be the means of leading others to institute similar in- 
vestigations.
To myself the particulars above so minutely detailed 
are valuable on two accounts ; first, because they have served to con- 
vince me more of the distinctness of the plants in question as species; 
and secondly, because I am of opinion that the advance of botanical 
science, as well as of all other sciences, dejDends more upon the parti- 
cular inquiries made by individuals than upon the general knowledge 
acquired without much investigation by the generality.
I may be al- 
lowed to add, that although I have come to a different conclusion from 
Ml*.
Newman's, with regard to the plants I have attempted to describe, 
377 
and have been most kindly encouraged by that gentleman to study 
the matter, and to publish the result of my inquiries, I feel all the de- 
ference due to authority so high, and therefore much diffidence in de- 
claring myself to be of an opposite opinion.

â€” Notes on Geniiana Amarella, (Linn.), and Gentiana 
germanica, (Willd.) By George Luxford, A.L.S.
&c.
These remarks are published in the hope that others, who have had 
an opportunity of examining the plants to which they refer, may be 
induced to record the results of their investigations in * The Phytolo- 
gist.' Mr. Babington's opinion (Phytol.
310) and Mr. Brown's obser- 
vations (Id. 320) have already appeared in its pages; on the other side 
of the question I may give the following extract from the ' Gardeners' 
Chronicle.' â€” 
^^ New British Plant.
â€” Some years ago Mr. W.
Pamplin, bookseller, of Queen, 
street, Soho, observed a Gentian with large flowers in the neighbourhood of Tring, in 
Hertfordshire.
Following his indication, the Rev. W.
H. Coleman of Hertford has 
obtained specimens which have confinned him in his suspicion that it would be found 
distinct from G.
Amarella.
In fact it proves to be the Gentiana germanica of foreign 
authors.
He observes the following differences between it and G.
Amarella : â€” " The 
plant is much smaller and less branched, while the flowers are fewer and larger.
The 
leaves are broader â€” minutely but more distinctly dentate, as are also the segments of 
the corolla.
The calyx is more rounded at the base, and its tube is equal to the seg- 
ments; while G.
Amarella has the segments rather longer than the tube.
The seg- 
ments of the corolla of such specimens of the Gentiana as he has examined, in cestiva- 
tion overlap those adjacent to them on the right â€” while those of G.
Amarella overlap 
towards the left.
More important diff"erences than these consist in the ovary of Gen- 
tiana geimanica being stalked and the corolla widest at the throat, while in G.
Ama- 
rella the ovary is sessile, and the corolla almost cylindrical.
Dr. Grisebach has already 
referred the figures of G.
Amarella in ' English Botany ' and the ' Flora Londinensis,' 
to G.
germanica; and there can, we think, be no doubt that it and G.
Amarella are 
quite distinct species.'' â€” Gardeners' Chronicle, Oct. 9, 1841.
The perusal of this paragraph made me determine, whenever an op- 
portunity occun-ed, to investigate the subject for myself, and, if possible, 
to satisfy my own mind as to the justness of the claims of the plant 
called Gentiana germanica to be considered specifically distinct from 
the Gentiana Amarella of Linnaeus.
At that time I had seen no au- 
thentic specimens of the former plant ; my examination was therefore 
confined to the specimens of G.
Amarella in my own herbarium.
The 
results of this examination certainly did not tend to remove certain 
doubts which previously existed, at the same time, I was not so influ- 
enced by them but that my mind remained open to conviction should 
the evidence subsequently adduced tend in the opposite direction.
A few weeks since Mr. Wm.
Pamplin very kindly sent me a recent 
specimen of a gentian, gathered by him near Streatley, Berks, together 
with the folio wins- remarks : â€” 
382 
" I have the pleasure to enclose herewith a fresh specimen of that large-flowered 
variety, or whatever it be, which I first gathered near Tring, in Herts, and which some 
have since considered, I believe, Gentiana germanica of Reichenbach and others.
" I add one or two plants of the common state of Gentiana Amarella, for your 
comparison.'' 
At last, then, I had in my possession a veritable example of the 
wished-for plant, as well as additional materials for comparison, and 1 
at once resolved to go to work.
The first step to be taken in the 
enquiry was obviously that of consulting Willdenow, the original au- 
thority for Gentiana germanica.
The characters assigned by him to 
the two plants, omitting the synonymes, are the following : â€” 
38.
Gentiana germanica, W.
Corolla 5-cleft, salver-shaped, bearded, segments of 
the limb ovate, acute : leaves ovate-lanceolate : branches longer than the internodes.
â€” â€¢' Species Plantarum,' Berolini, 1797.
P. 1346.
39.
Gentiana Amarella.
Corolla 5-cleft, salver-shaped, bearded, segments of the 
limb lanceolate, acute : leaves lanceolate : branches shorter than the internodes.
Differing from the preceding in its whole habit, shorter branches, narrower and 
smaller corolla, lanceolate leaves and pale yellow root (radice j^am).
â€” Id. 1347.
Here, it will be observed, nothing is said about the stipitate ovarium 
of G.
germanica, or the sessile one of G.
Amarella.
Willdenow's 
distinctive characters are founded chiefly on differences in the shape 
of the segments of the corolla, in the form of the leaves, and in the 
relative length of the branches and internodes.
He also, in the re- 
marks above quoted after G.
Amarella, applies to its root the same 
term {Jlava) as Froelich, in the following description of his G.
Ama- 
rella, applies to its root.
Froelich's G.
Amarella is quoted by Will- 
denow as a synonyme of G.
germanica.
Froelich's description of the plant being very full, I shall give it 
entire, omitting only his synonymes.
33.
Gentiana Amarella.
Corolla 6-cleft, salver-shaped, acute, throat bearded ; seg- 
ments of the calyx sub-equal.
Hab. in the meadows of Europe.
Annual.
Flowers in the autumn.
Root simple, fibrous, pale yellow, {flava).
Stem erect, obsoletely hexagonal, pur- 
plish, leafy, branched in a brachiate manner ; branches opposite, single-flowered, leafy, 
frequently many-flowered, of the same height as the plant ; frequently more simple, 
few-flowered, not longer than the corolla.
Radical leaves numerous, lying on the 
ground, obovate, obtuse, narrowing into a petiole, obscurely 3-nerved, withering ; stem- 
leaves sessile, slightly connate at the base, ovate or ovate-lanceolate, more or less acute, 
rough at the margin, 3-nerved ; upper stem-leaves and those on the branches sub-cor- 
date, acute.
Flowers terminal and axillary, solitary or two together, erect, an inch 
long (shorter in small plants), peduncles erect, angular, shorter than the flower.
Ca- 
lyx campanulate, marked with fifteen raised lines, 5-clcft beyond the middle, about 
383 
lialf the length of the corolla, segments lanceolate, acute, siibeqiial.
Corolla salver- 
shaped, piirplc-hlue ; tube widening upwards, angular, striated, transversely wrinkled 
between the striae, contracted and paler at the base ; limb 5-cleft, segments ovate-lan- 
ceolate, acute, entire, one-third the length of the tube : scales in the mouth of the tube 
five, membranaceous, white, multifid in a capillary manner at the apex.
Stamina : â€” 
filaments rather longer than the tube, at the base of which they are inserted ; anthers 
oblong, free.
Pistil : â€” germen oblong, on a short stalk (breviter pedicellatum), attenu- 
ated upwards : stigmas ovate.
Capsule oblong, longer than the corolla, stalked.
Seeds 
roundish, rather compressed, smooth, brown.
â€” Froelich, 'De Gentiana Libellus,' Er- 
langa), 179(5.
P. 86.
Then follow the characters and an equally full description of G.
pratensis, a native of Russia and Siberia, given by Willdenow as a 
distinct species, but quoted by Grisebach as synonymous with his G.
Amarella, Â«.
The following are its characters.
34.
Gentiana pratensis.
Corolla somewhat 5-cleft, salver-shaped, obtuse, throat 
bearded ; segments of the calyx unequal : leaves lanceolate.
At the end of his work, Froelich gives the following interesting ac- 
count of his meeting with another Gentiana Amarella, apparently dis- 
tinct from the plant so called by himself and other German botanists.
" After the preceding part was printed, the 1st fasciculus of Dickson's Dried Plants 
came into my hands; among them is Gentiana Amarella, No. 5, from Derbyshire, 
in England.
The root is like that of Gent.
Amarella above describeil, but yellow, {lu- 
tea).
Stem as in that, also purple, but more slender ; ten inches high.
Branches be- 
ginning at the middle of the stem, shorter than the adjoining internodes, as in Gent, 
pratensis and campestris ; the stem therefore is not pyramidical, as it generally is in 
our Amarella.
Lower leaves spathulato ovate, the next ovate-lanceolate, the upper ones 
lanceolate, acute, shorter than the internodes.
Flowers terminal and axillary, solitary 
or in pairs, the lower ones seated on the branches, erect, 9 lines long, 2 lines wide, 
being thus much smaller than in Amarella as above described.
Calyx as in that, and 
about half the length of the tube of the corolla, rather unequal.
Corolla likewise si- 
milar, only narrower, and apparently of a paler blue.
Stamina the length of the tube.
Germen still more attenuated above.
This seems to be a species distinct from our 
Amarella, and if, as appears from the title of the fasciculus, it is named on the autho- 
rity of the Linnaean herbarium, it must retain the name of Amarella ; whilst our plant, 
the Amarella of German botanists, must receive another name.
â€” Id. 141.
Willdenow, in the following year, published the German Gentiana 
Amarella in his ' Species Plantarum,' under the name of G.
germanica.
Turning now from Froelich and Willdenow to Grisebach, " the lat- 
est and best authority on the Gentianese," I must confess that I at first 
found myself somewhat bewildered among his characters of the " four 
states of each species," and the nimierous synonymes assigned to each 
of these states.
I think I cannot better illustrate the uncertainty and 
384 
difficulty attending this investigation, than by giving the characters of 
these plants and their varieties, with other essential particulars, as I 
find them in Grisebach's elaborate * Genera et Species Gentianearum.' 
I had intended to give the whole of the synonymes, but finding that 
by so doing I should considerably lengthen my paper, I determined 
on quoting merely the references to original authorities and the very 
few British works.
I may here remark that T have endeavoured to render all these trans- 
lations as literal as possible, without any attempt at elegance of diction.

rolla blue ; its tube obconical ; the lobes elliptic-lanceolate, about 
half the length of the tube.
Stamina about as long as the tube.
* The learned author observes, in a foot-note, that " The synonymes of the older 
writers had better be devoted to eternal oblivion." 
385 
Varleiiea.
â€” A variable species as to the form of the leaves, the 
length of the calyx and the shape of its lobes ; also in the number of 
parts in the flowers, which are either quatemary or quinary ; in its mode 
of branching, and in the inflorescence, which varies from panicled to 
1 -flowered and sub-axillary ; also in the colour of the corolla, which 
varies to white.
The stem occasionally sends off" from its base single- 
flowered partially decumbent shoots, (Scotland).
It is also sometimes 
somewhat naked, and nodding at the apex, with leaves scarcely half 
an inch long, rather obtuse and narrow, with few-flowered axillary 
cymes, rigidly spreading, (stony places in the region of Baikal).
â€” 
There are scarcely any limits between the other varieties ; &.
however 
is more constant.
Observations.
â€” The following remarks will give some idea of the 
history of this species, the synonymy of which Reichenbach was the 
first to clear up satisfactorily.
Gentiana Amarella is much more fre- 
quent in Sweden than G.
germanica, if indeed the latter occur there 
at all, which I very much doubt, since Linnaeus was either altogether 
unacquainted with it, or else did not distinguish it from the former, 
which is met with everywhere in that country.
Ehrhart also collected 
G. Amarella with Linnaeus j and on his return to Hanover, when he 
first saw G.
germanica, he named it G.
critica.
This name, according 
to the rule of priority, would have been substituted for Willdenow's, 
had not Ehrhart's specimens presented a more rare and smaller form, 
but still having the stipitate ovary.
Ehrhart's specimens are identi- 
cal !
with Smith's figure in ' English Botany,' 2-36, which, by mistake, 
is given as the G.
Amarella of the Linna3an herbarium, and unnatu- 
rally represented with a sessile ovary ; * it is, however, G.
germanica.
Dickson, more accurate in this respect, proved the G.
pratensis of 
Froelich to stand in the Linnasan herbarium as G.
Amarella; and 
Smith himself, having subsequently become sensible of his error, in 
his letter to Panzer written in 1822 (Flora, 1830, p.
529), says that 
G. germanica is distinct from the G.
Amarella of Linnajus.f Sir W.
* Grisebacli appears to be in error here.
A very evident though short stalk is re- 
presented at the base of the separate ovary in the ' English Botany' figure.
f Sir J.
E. Smith, in the second volume of his ' English Flora,' published in 1828, 
six years after the date of the letter above mentioned, has the following observations 
under Gentiana Amarella.
" G.

critica of 
Ehrhart, Herb.

Amarella in having ^ozrers nearly twice as large, situated about the upper part of the 
stem^ which is of a corymbose form of growth.

Hooker, however, did not consider tlie two plants to be distinct spe- 
cies ; and has consequently again figured G.
germanica under the 
name of G.
Amarella ; and in thus combining them other botanists 
agree, but I do not, since I have never seen intermediate forms, nor 
do I think that the arguments to be drawn from the different geogra- 
phical stations of the two species, ought to be neglected.

Under the name of Gentiana carapestri-germanica, Grisebach also 
describes a plant which he considers to be a hybrid between G.
ger- 
raanica and G.
campestris.
The flower is 5-cleft, the calyx having 
two of its lobes much larger than the rest.
It will, I think, be considered quite unnecessary for me to give quo- 
tations from the works of any other continental botanists than those 
already referred to, who are all intimately connected with the subject 
under discussion ; â€” Willdenow from being the original authority for 
G. gerraanica, Froelich from the full descriptions contained in his Li- 
bellus of the species of Gentiana known at the time it was written, 
and Grisebach, from his elaborate Monograph of the whole order, in 
which work he has devoted considerable space to the illustration of 
the plants now before us.
I am, however, truly gratified in being able 
to close this part of the enquiry wdth a short extract from the Jifth 
edition of Hooker's ' British Flora,' published only within the last 
fortnight.
The two plants stand therein as distinct species ; the cha- 
racters assigned to each being substantially the same as Grisebach's, 
already given, I need not quote them : the following remarks, under 
G. germanica, will, however, show that although the opinions of the 
leai'ned author, in deference perhaps to the high authority of Grise- 
bach, may have been somewhat modified since the publication of the 
' Flora Londinensis,' he evidently considers the question as still open 
to discussion.
" la tlie ' Flora Londinensis ' I stated it as my opinion that the G.
Amarella and 
G. germanica were not specifically different.
Grisebach, Koch, and others think dif- 
ferently ; and as the former author has examined and made his remarks on the speci- 
mens in my herbarium, I have given his characters, and would direct the attention of 
botanists to the subject.
Mr. H.
Watson is of opinion that they are but trifling vari- 
eties of each other.
In all iny numerous specimens of G.
Amarella, the plant takes a 
more or less pyramidal form, ami the flowers arc far more numerous, crowded, and 
considerably smaller than in G.
germanica." â€” Hook.

Since the preceding part was written I have again examined and 
compared all the specimens of Gentiana at my command, that can be 
refen-ed to either of the two forms.
This examination has led to the 
following conclusions.
1. That no character can be derived from either the positive or re- 
lative size of either plants or flowers ; both forms being exceedingly 
and equally variable in this respect.
The specimen from near Streat- 
ley is much larger, more branched, and with many more flowers than 
the specimens of G.
Amarella which accompanied it; the reverse of 
these conditions obtained in the plants mentioned in the extract from 
the ' Gardeners' Chronicle' (Phytol.
381).
2. That no dependence can be placed on the relative proportions 
of the leaves, branches, and internodes ; these proportions frequently 
varying even in the same individual.
In the Streatley specimen some 
of the branches are shorter, others are longer, than the internodes of 
the stem, while the leaves are shorter.
The same remarks will equally 
apply to large-flowered continental plants, and to British specimens 
of G.
Amarella.
3. That in form both the leaves and calyx-lobes are variable ; and 
the proportion borne by the latter to the tube of the calyx difiers in 
the same^specimen.
4. That although the tube of the corolla may, in some specimens, 
be correctly described as cylindrical, and in others as gradually wid- 
ening upwards, yet intermediate forms are extremely common.
And 
Grisebach, in his descriptions, calls them both " obconical," as Mr.
Brown has already remarked, (Phytol.
320).
5. That with respect to the stalk [stipes) of the ovary, if by that 
term is to be understood a stalk separate and distinct fi'om the sub- 
stance of the ovary supported by it, similar to that represented in tab.
236, ' English Botany,' then such a stalk I have not been able to find 
either in the Berkshire plant before mentioned, in continental speci- 
mens, or in any others that can possibly be referred to G.
geimanica.
6. That if, on the contrary, by the term stipes we are to understand 
such a gradual diminution of size in the base of the ovary itself, as 
would probably be produced by the shrinking of that part, as sug- 
gested by Mr. Brown, then such a stalk I find to be more or less evi- 
dent in every specimen that I have examined, whether referrible to 
G. Amarella or G.
germanica.
7. Moreover, in undoubted specimens of G.
Amarella, gathered 
rather late in the season, I find some flowers with mature capsules, 
which contain ripe seeds, and are generally perfectly sessile ; while in 
389 
other flowers on the same plant, sometimes even in those on the same 
branch, the ovary being immature when the plant was gathered, it is 
stalked, apparently in consequence of the shrinking of the lower part 
in the manner described.
Lastly : as a necessary consequence of the above conclusions, and 
in the absence of more positive evidence than any we at present pos- 
sess, I think I shall be warranted in considering the numerous forms 
of the two plants as all belonging to one variable species.
I shall be gratified by receiving specimens of any form of these 
plants for further examination ; and earnestly hope that the subject 
will be taken up by more able botanists, who will favour the public 
with the result of their enquiries.

â€” Some Account of the Botanical Collections recently 
made hy Dr. Theodore Kotschy (for the Wurtemhiirg Botani- 
cal Union) in Nubia and Cordofan.* Communicated by Mr.
William Pamplin, jun.
The collection of dried Nubian plants (amounting to nearly four 
hundred species) made by Dr. Theodore Kotschy in 1839, possesses 
so much interest, not only to the members of the Wurtemburg Union 
among whom the plants are distributed, but also to the botanical world 
at large, that Dr. Schnizlein, in the hope of rendering an acceptable 
service to botanical Geography, has kindly undertaken the task of 
enumerating and comparing them with the materials already known 
as forming part of the Floras of Egypt, Arabia, Eastern India and 
Western Africa.
So favourable an opportunity of acquiring a know- 
ledge of the vegetation of the eastern part of Africa, will not probably 
soon occur again.
In the first place, with respect to the condition of the plants, it is 
quite evident, on inspection, that they have been prepared with great 
care ; of some there are specimens both in flower and fruit ; all are 
exceedingly well preserved ; and of many species the specimens are 
numerous.
We find twenty species in the most excellent state ; two 
hundred and fifty-six in perfectly good condition ; and only about 
forty which are not quite complete, or, in other words, less perfect : 
in fact, altogether, they could not have been expected to amve in a 
* Translated and abridged from the ' Regensberg Flora oder Botanische Zeitung ' 
for 1842.
390 
better state, for they are neither broken nor otherwise injured, and fre- 
quently several specimens of one species are given, and reckoned only 
as one : it must, however, be acknowledged, that on the whole a ma- 
jority of small-sized plants occur, and a few of the larger ones, such 
as shrubs and trees, are cut into small pieces and occasionally divest- 
ed of the root, probably with the view of economizing the space re- 
quired in packing them.
Among the greatest ornaments of the collection, the following may 
be particularized.
The two splendidly dried Utricularias â€” U.
inflexa 
and U.
stellaris, the new and delicate Udora cordofana.
The superb 
grasses Fimbristylis hispidula, Isolepis prselongata, Cyperus aristatus, 
squarrosus, resinosus, Lappago orientalis, seven species of Aristida, 
Ctenium elegans, the ornamental Triachyrum cordofanum, Chloris 
spathacea, Pennisetum lanuginosum, Panicum Petiverii.
Isnardia 
lythrarioides, Heliotropium pallens ; the magnificent Ipomoea repens, 
a bog plant, with large rose-coloured flowers ; the small but extraor- 
dinary Conomitra linearis, with its orbicular and long-pointed pod ; 
the conspicuous Mollugo bellidifolia ; but above all, that rare and re- 
markable plant the Neptunia stolonifera, whose root-stem reminds one 
of our Phellandria, the heads of flowers of (Enanthe, while the leaves 
and the fruit resemble those of a Mimosa; Poivrea aculeata, Guiera 
senegalensis, six Cassias, four Bergias, the three splendid Nymphseas â€” 
caerulea, Lotus and ampla ; Striga orchidea, Acanthodium hirtum, Pe- 
dalium Caillaudii, Melhunia Kotschyi, Monsonia senegalensis, Dales- 
champia cordofana, four Pavonias, five Hibiscus, eight Sidas ; the fine 
Acacias â€” papyracea and seriocephala : altogether we have thirty-nine 
species of Papilionacese, among which the Requienia obovata and the 
two species of Alyssicarpus are worth noticing ; the remarkably well 
named Euphorbias â€” acalyphoides, covolvuloides and polycnemoides.
In the second place, the principal districts and localities in which 
Dr. Th.
Kotschy made his collections are to be noted.
They are as 
follow : â€” first in the province of Cordofan, the city Obied, with the 
neighbouring mountain Arasch Cool, the lake Tara, and the river 
Clioor; then the villages Abu-Gerad, Bara Chursi, Hogeli, Tejara 
and Uagle ; then the more southerly situated town Tekele, and the 
mountain Kohn : second, in the province Sennaar, the village Wolet 
Medine, Gujeschab on the Nile, then the islands by the cataracts of 
the White Nile, at the mountain Gerri.

Remarks on the Structure and Morphology of Marehantia.
By 
George Dickie, Lecturer on Botany at Aberdeen.
The author's observations refer chiefly to Marehantia polymorpha ; 
and they are arranged under two heads: " 1.
The structure of Mar- 
ehantia.
2. The inferences to be drawn from the facts exposed under 
the first head." The paper is illustrated by figures.
In the first division of his subject Mr. Dickie describes the stnic- 
ture of the frond, and the fiructification.
In speaking of the lower 
surface of the frond he states that what is called by Sir W.
J. Hooker 
a " prominent blackish midrib," " is in reality a groove in the frond, 
from the edges of which originate purplish scales, which, by meeting, 
conceal the groove ; in this groove are numerous transparent fila- 
ments." Many short radicles originate from the surface of the frond 
at the sides of the groove.
The receptacles of both the (so-called) male and female reproduc- 
tive organs, are supported by peduncles ; these originate " from the 
grooves on the lower surface of the frond, and are grooved in a si- 
milar manner, the peduncles and their posterior grooves being conti- 
nuous with the fi-ond and the groove on its inferior surface.
In each 
of the grooves is lodged a bundle of transparent tubular filaments, the 
walls of which " are covered with gi-een granules, often arranged in a 
spiral manner." The lower end of the filaments is blunt and closed, 
the upper extremity spreads over the inferior surface of the receptacle, 
sending off" a bundle to each lobe or ray of the former.
The filaments 
at this part " are covered with overlapping scales, similar to those of 
the lower surface of the frond." 
What are generally considered to be male receptacles are lobed at 
the margin, while the female receptacles are rayed ; the rays, however, 
are stated to be " merely lobes bent upon themselves, from above 
downwards." A perpendicular section of the male receptacle shows 
it to consist of cellular tissue enclosed between two membranes.
In 
the tissue " are embedded numerous flask-shaped sacs, with long 
necks, terminating each by an orifice on the upper surface of the re- 
ceptacle.
* * The sacs contain the bodies called anthers, 
892 
which vary in form according to the stage of development at which 
they are examined.
Each of these bodies consists of a celhilar sac 
filled with a granular matter." For a correct description of the fertile 
receptacles, with their involucres and capsules, the author refers to 
Sir W.
J. Hooker's account of those parts.
Under the head of Morpliology, the author institutes an enquiry 
into the true nature of the peduncles, and of the so-called male recep- 
tacles and anthers ; and shows that the latter bodies bear no relation 
to those organs in flowering plants.
He is of opinion that the lobed 
receptacles and the peduncles "may be considered as metamorphosed 
fronds," of which a longitudinal section shows them to be continua- 
tions; "the grooves of the peduncles are continuations of the grooves 
on the lower surface of the fronds, and they enclose the same spirally 
dotted filaments." 
" The flat receptacle is lobed like the fronds, its structure is the same, on the lower 
surface, filaments in grooves covered with scales, and a cuticle with stomata on the up- 
per surface ; and the fact that one of the notches is larger than any of the others, and 
the concavity on one side of the peduncle, appear to lead to the inference, that this re- 
ceptacle is a small frond folded horizontally upon itself.
In M.
conica the relation of 
the two is more evident, the receptacle in this species being sessile, and still more so 
in that variety of M.
hemispheerica where the receptacles are always sessile, and em- 
bedded, as it were in the substance of the frond." â€” p.
110.
With respect to the bodies termed anthers, the author institutes a 
comparison between them as found in Marchantia and Riccia, a nearly 
allied genus.
In the latter genus the capsules are spherical, in Mar- 
chantia the sacs " are flask-shaped, and have a long neck protruding 
by an orifice at the surface." The inclosed bodies also differ some- 
what in shape, but in both genera they consist of "a cellular mem- 
brane enclosing minute granules." Hence the author is disposed to 
consider these bodies as gemmae, or one means by which young plants 
are produced, but remarks that " it may appear rash to an*ive at any 
such conclusion until they are actually seen to germinate under fa- 
vourable circumstances." 
XIV.
Remarks on some curious Metamorphoses of the Pistil of Salix caprea.
By the Rev. J.
E. Leefe, M.A., Audley End, Essex.
The author commences his remarks by quoting Professor Lindley's 
observation, that the pistil is seldom found " converted into stamens, 
but it often takes upon itself the form of petals, and although cases 
are very rare of pistils bearing pollen, yet several instances are known 
of ovules being borne by the stamens." This rare instance of conver- 
393 
sion occurred in the calkins of an apparently healthy plant of Salix 
caprea, growing on the banks of the Cam, near Audley End, Essex.
" The catkins were of a light green colour, longer, and tapering to a point, instead 
of being blunt, as is usual in S.
caprea.
In one case three apparently proceeded from 
the same bud.
The nectary and scale were very little altered, and the change is very 
various in its character, and several intermediate forms occur in addition to those which 
I am about to mention.
Those enumerated are, however, the most remarkable.
I 
may here mention, that I do not mean that all the forms are to be found in the same 
catkin, and also that the greatest alteration is observable in the flowers at the apex and 
base of the catkins.
" 1.
Styles two, each bearing at the top two small pale stigmas; in other respects 
as usual.
"2.
Scale and nectary as usual.
Stalk of the ovarium extremely lengthened, re- 
sembling a filament, downy, especially towards the base, terminating in an ovarium.
Style cloven, the cleft penetrating the substance of the ovarium ; at the base of the clo- 
ven style, on one face only, appeared two yellow bodies like the lobes of an anther.
" 3.
Stalk greatly lengthened.
Ovarium silky, not much altered at the base ; stig- 
mas almost entirely obliterated ; instead of them a vertical depression or sinus, on each 
side of which was a yellow antheriform body, erumpent from the substance of the ova- 
rium.
These contained perfect pollen, and in the lower ovarium-like portion I remarked 
several ovules.
" 4.
Stalk forked or branched near the top, each fork bearing a silky body resem- 
bling an ovarium.
"5.
Stalk forked; one fork filament-like, and tipped with an anther yielding pol- 
len ; the other silky, approaching an ovarium in form, and containing ovules.
" 6.
In this form, in which the nearest approach to a stamen was made, each fork 
bearing an anther containing pollen, and the ovarium being entirely obliterated, traces 
of the original structure are to be seen in the bifurcated filament analogous to the two 
stigmas." â€” p.

All these various forms are illustrated by figures.

Descriptions of Jungermannia ulicina (Taylor), and of J.
Lyoni (Tay^ 
lor).
By Thomas Taylor, M.D., M.R.I.A., Bunkerron, Kenmare, 
Kerry.
1. Jungermannia ulicina, i^ayXoi).
Stem creeping, filiform, branched: leaves dis- 
tichous, roundish-ovate, concave, bilobate, inferior lacinia much the smaller, involute ; 
stipides ovate, bifid : fruit axillary ; perichaBtium three-leaved, compressed, two upper 
leaves narrow at the base, roundish-oblong, inner margins incurved; lower leaves ob- 
long-ovate, bifid.
On stems of Ulex europseus and Erica cinerea, " on wet banks fa- 
cing the north, over Finnehy river, near Kenmare, Co. of Kerry; (T.
T.) 
At Dolgelly, North Wales ; Mr. W.
Wilson." 
A minute species, bearing a strong resemblance to J.
minutissima, 
Sm.
-y from which it may be distinguished by the presence of stipules, 
2l 
394 
by the large, flattened, tliree-leaved perichaetium, by the caulme leaves 
mcreasing in size as they approach the perichsetium, by the skin be- 
ing less flexuose, by the leaves being more distant, and by the paler 
colour of the whole plant.
Dr. Taylor refers to Hooker's * British Jungermannise,' tab.
lii.
fig.
3, as being " a just representation of the stem, leaves, and stipules of 
J. ulicina ; " and observes, 
" It is remarkable that on the same stems of furze in the above locality, grew every 
one of the minute tribe to which the present species is allied, viz., J.
minutissima, J.
hamatifolia, J.
calyptrifolia, andJ.
serpyllifolia." â€” p.
116.
2. Jungermannia Lyoni, (Taylor).
Stem ascending, somewhat branched : leaves 
distichous, alternate, somewhat quadrate, concave, recurved, trifid ; anterior lacinia 
rounded in front, posterior one reflexed, all acute or terminated by a single large tooth ; 
stipules none : fruit at length lateral ; calyces oblong, obtuse, inflated, rather naked at 
the base, mouth fringed and plaited.
" So great is the force of individual vegetation, that within the calyx, and along- 
side the pistilla, a bud may sometimes be seen to arise, and at length to emerge out 
of the calyx, clothed with leaves.
Perhaps this viviparous condition of the calyx has 
not yet been observed in any other species.
The plant nearest in natural affinity is 
probably J.
orcadensis, Hook., equally destitute of stipules, having a similar erect, 
scarcely-branched stem, growing up among tufts of mosses, but differing, 1st, by the 
leaves being simply emarginated, 2nd, by their margins being recurved, and so assum- 
ing, when moist, a convex and tumid appearance in front." â€” p.
117.
Resembling J.
barbata, Schreh.
and J.
incisa, Schrad., but differing 
from the former in the presence of stipules, in its more oblong calyx, 
and in its less concave, subsquarrose leaves, which are also less im- 
bricated ; and from the latter, in its larger size and ascending stems, 
in the leaves being anteriorly rounded and entire, with their lower la- 
cinia reflexed and their cells smaller, in the more tumid and less pli- 
cate calyx, in its squarrose perichsetial leaves, in the leaves being 
more distant and paler in colour.
This species is described at considerable length, and illustrated by 
figures.

Extracts from the Minute-Book of the Botanical Society, from JVo- 
vember, 1840, to July, 1841.
1840, December 10.
Read, Extracts from a letter addressed to the 
Secretary, b}' the Rev. T.
B. Bell, dated December 3, 1840, contain- 
ing " Observations on the specific distinctions between Asplenium 
Ruta-muraria, and A.
alternifolium." 
Mr. Bell observes, â€” " I am aware some botanists have remarked, that attenuated 
forms of Asplenium Ruta-muraria approach indefinitely near A.
alternifolium.
I be- 
395 
lieve the two species have occasionally been confounded, but I always regarded this as 
a mistake into which no one could fall who had perfect specimens before him, and who 
was not prepared to substitute the general aspect and habit of the plants for their spe- 
cific characters.
As Mr. Newman, in his recent publication on Ferns, has fallen into 
this mistake, and conjoined the species, I think it not out of place to communicate to 
the Botanical Society the following brief observations : â€” 
" The first character is taken fi'om the form of the frond, which is correctly stated 
by Sir William Hooker to be bipinnate in A.
Kuta-muraria, and, in alternifolium, pin- 
nate, the lower pinna ternate ; the pinnee in both being alternate.
Now so far from its 
being the tendency of attenuated or contracted forms of A.
Ruta-muraria to approach 
the pinnate form of alternifolium â€” the truth of the matter is, that the more attenuated 
the former is, the more distinctly bipinnate does it become, or in other words, the near- 
er A.
Ruta-muraria approaches alternifolium in its general aspect and habit, the fur- 
ther and more visibly does it diverge in this character.
" The second character is taken from the indusium, with regard to which it is hard- 
ly necessary to remark, that while that of alternifolium has a smooth even edge, the 
edge in all varieties of Ruta-muraria is invariably jagged or uneven, and this is quite 
visible to the naked eye." â€” p.

In these observations the cinnamon plantations of Ceylon were de- 
scribed at considerable length, and the distinguishing qualities of the 
three principal varieties of cinnamon mentioned.
He also alluded to 
the Malabar cinnatnon, " which included several sorts in one parcel, 
but amongst which only a few pieces are equal to the finer qualities 
of Ceylon cinnamon." It was also remarked that the Cassia lignea of 
commerce is of three kinds ; â€” " that from China, sometimes called 
Chinese cinnamon ; that from the islands bordering on China ; and 
that from the continent of India." The former appears to be distinct 
from all the varieties of cinnamon, from which it differs in its texture, 
taste, colour, and other characters ; " the quills of cassia are made of 
single rolls of bark â€” those of cinnamon are distinguished by being 
composed of several, one within the other." The different products 
of cinnamon were described, and observations made on the botanical 
characters of the plants which yield the cinnamon and cassia of com- 
merce ; allusions were also made to the difficulties attending the in- 
vestigation, caused by the contradictory statements of authors.
The 
history of the various researches into the subject was adverted to, and 
Dr. K.
concluded his observations with a brief description of the " se- 
veral species of cinnamon growing in Ceylon, Java, and the Malabar 
coast ; as also of the Cinnamomum aromaticum, or Laurus Cassia of 
Nees Von Esenbeck." 
Prof.
Christison observed that for the last tvvent\ -five years nothing 
396 
had been imported from Ceylon under the name of cassia-bark, and 
stated his reasons for believing the greater part of it to come from Can- 
ton.
He also made some remarks on the plants from which the bark 
is produced.

Read, Notice of the discovery of the cones of Pinus 
Mughus [Jacq.), in peat bogs in Ireland.
By Mr. Charles C.
Babing- 
ton, Cambridge.
The specimen sent to the Society was found under 
" six feet of solid peat bog at Burrishoole, near Newport, Mayo." 
Prof.
Don was of opinion that it was a "cone of Pinus Mughus, Jacq., 
which, however, he considered a variety of P.
sylvestris, but quite dif- 
ferent from any of the varieties now native in Scotland." 
" It is interesting to find that a tree which must have formed at least a portion of 
the native forest of that wild part of Ireland, in which a tree is now scarcely to be found, 
should be thus proved to belong to a form of Pinus not now native in Britain, but con- 
fined, I believe, to the Austrian Alps.
The native forests of that part of Ireland have 
now been totally destroyed for about two hundred years, one clause in the original 
grants to English settlers having required their destruction and employment in the 
smelling of iron.
Professor Don states, that these cones agree exactly with others that 
he has seen from the bogs of Armagh." â€” p.

Read, a Notice of the disappearance of plants from par- 
ticular localities.
By Mr. J.
Just, Bury, Lancashire.
The first plant 
mentioned is Lepidium Smithii, Hook., of which, in the summer of 
1840, the author could not find a single specimen in a locality where 
it had previously abounded, although there was no apparent cause for 
its disappearance.
Orchis maculata and the white-flowered variety of 
Orchis mascula are other cases mentioned.
The white-flowered va- 
rieties of Myosotis sylvatica and Geranium robertianum, were intro- 
duced into a garden and allowed to shed their seeds, the plants from 
which show a disposition to revert to the original colour.

Mr. James Mc'Nab made a communication " On some 
anomalous methods of cultivating plants in hot-houses." This com- 
munication, with several illustrative wood-cuts, appeared in the ' Gar- 
deners' Chronicle ' for August 14, 1841.
The plants experimented 
on were Ficus elastica, Polypodium am-eum, Acrostichum alcicome, 
Euphorbia splendens and Bilbergia nudicaulis.
The roots were first 
denuded of the soil ; the plants of Ficus were suspended from the roof 
in various ways, with their roots entirely exposed ; the Polypodium, 
Acrostichum and Euphorbia had their roots covered ^\'ith moss, they 
were then suspended from the roof in an inverted position.
All the 
plants thus treated grew well, and the ferns had a very handsome 
appearance.
July 8.
Dr. Douglas Maclagan read a notice of the Chemical Con- 
stitution of the Fruit of a species of Phytelephas, commonly called 
" Vegetable Ivory." This fruit is the product of a South American 
plant, and has lately been much used as a substitute for ivory.
The 
seed is triangular, from l^- to 2^ inches long and from 1 to 2 broad; 
its substance is hard, and closely resembling ivory in its physical cha- 
racters.
The specimen examined, on being cut across, was found to 
have a cavity in the centre, the walls of which were soft and yielded to 
the nail.
A portion of the white matter, including part of both the soft 
and hard substance, was analysed by the action of cold and hot water, 
alcohol, and subsequent incineration.
The constituents of the portion 
examined are then stated, with their several proportions; and the results 
of a subsequent analysis of the ashes are also given.
The notice is 
concluded with the statement that " from these experiments it ap- 
peared that there was nothing in the chemical constitution of the ve- 
getable ivory, which could account for its hardness, which must be 
due only to a peculiar texture in the woody fibre." â€” p.

Note on Primulas.
I have no other observation to make on the common yel- 
low Primulae, than that in the district haunted by me, in canton Appenzell, varying 
from 3000 to 8000 feet above the sea, not a specimen of P.
veris (cowslip), or P.
vul- 
garis (primrose), was to be seen, or, by the most diligent enquiry, had ever been heard 
of, that I could find.
P. elatior (oxlip) was everywhere over the meadows, peeping up 
among the very earliest, on the first warm patches cleared of snow in February, and 
continuing to gladden the eye, more or less sparingly, according to the altitude and 
protection, until all is again covered up with snow in November.
P. veris abounded 
398 
in the valleys below up to 1200 or 1400 feet.
P. vulgaris I never saw in that part of 
Switzerland.

Economical Use of the Dock.
As a counterpart to Mr. I^ees's statement of 
the domestic use of the fern in the forest of Dean (Pliytol.
2fi3), I beg leave to add the 
following similar use of the neglected dock in this neighbourhood.
In summers when 
food for pigs is scarce or difficult to be procured, the dernier resort of the housewife is 
the dock, which is then gathered and boiled in the manner described in the before- 
mentioned statement ; sometimes mixed with a few potatoes or a little barley-meal, it 
forms a very nice mess to help through the time of scarcity.
Another use of them to 
the farmer's wife is as wrappers for her butter in bringing it to market, the greater 
portion heing wrapped up in dock-leaves after they are washed clean ; it is only after 
these have failed, on the approach of winter, that they begin to use the cloth wrappers.

Enquiry respecting Bryum pyriforme.
Perhaps some of your readers would 
be able to say if the plant described in ' English Flora ' under the name of Bryum py- 
riforme be the same as the one figured in ' Muscologia Britannica ' under the same 
name.
A short time ago as I was examining a few specimens of what I thought to be 
Bryum pyriforme, I was greatly surprised to find them so much at variance with the 
description of that plant by Sir W.
Hooker, in ' English Flora,' vol.
v. p.
60, whei'ein 
he says â€” " This differs from all other Brya in the remarkable shape of its leaves, which 
are almost wholly composed of nerve, except at the base, and there deeply serrated.'' â€” 
The point in which my plants differ from the description given by Sir W".
Hooker, con- 
sists in the leaves being quite smooth on their edges.
On turning to the ' Muscologia 
Britannica,' I find the figure in that work to represent leaves which are smooth at the 
base and somewhat serrated at the point.
It will be evident, on examination, that the 
description above quoted and the figure in ' Muse.
Brit.' do present characters sufii- 
ciently distinct to justify the adoption of two species.

Note on Equisetum variegatum, var.
Mackaii.
1 have received the following 
communication from Dr. Scouler, correcting some mistakes into which he supposes I 
have fallen respecting the history of the Equiseta.
He states that the var.
Mackaii, or 
" E.
elongatum of Hooker, was recognised as a distinct species by Mr. Whitla of Bel- 
fast, but that this gentleman's views were not adopted by any Irish botanist until the 
beginning of the present year.
The plant was first found by Mr. Whitla in Colin 
Glen, near Belfast ; afterwards, in 1833, he found it in the Deer-park, near Glenarne.
The remarkable variety of E.
variegatum growing on the margin of the canal near 
Dublin, was found by Mr. Johnson, a very acute botanist." â€” Edward Newman ; 2,

County Lists of British Ferns.
1 most earnestly solicit from those botanists 
who may read this notice, assistance in forming a correct and complete county list of 
all the British species of ferns and allied genera.
The plan I wish adopted is to give 
the name of every species that may occur, however common, because I regard it as 
quite possible that even such species as Asplenium Ruta-muraria, Pteris aquilina and 
Lastraea Filix-mas, may not occur in every county, and their non-occurrence w^ould 
thus become known and a curious fact established.
All observations and localities 
which the writers may consider of value are also solicited, especially with regard to the 
rarer species.
It is my intention to use these lists as data for a general work ; each, if 
permission be given by the writer, will be handed over to ' The Phytologist/ for inser- 
399 
tion in its pages, prior to any other use being made of it.
The subjoined list of 
Herefordshire ferns only, as far as I have had an opportunity of observing them, will 
perhaps show what is desired.

Vegetable Morphology.''

Irregular Metamorphoses of flowers are extremely common, and usually consist 
either of an actual multiplication of petals, or of the transformation of stamens and 
pistils into petals ; the effect of these changes being the formation of double flowers, 
the impletion of which appears to take place in different ways in different plants.
In 
most Icosandrous and Polyandrous plants, impletion appears to result almost entirely 
from the conversion of the stamens, and in some instances of the pistils, into petals ; 
in the double varieties of Ulex europceus it results from the same change.
In Oligan- 
drous plants we usually find an actual multiplication of petals ; as may be seen in the 
double stocks and wallflowers of our gardens.
Where the impletion is the result of 
this alteration of the essential floral organs, the plants are necessarily barren.
Such, 
however, is not the case with the Dahlia, Aster, and other plants which belong to the 
Corymbiferous section of Compositae ; in these the impletion results, first, from the 
change of the tubular florets of the disk into ligulate florets, the same as those of the 
ray, as in the Dahlia, and, secondly, by the simple enlargement and elongation of the 
tubular florets, as in the many varieties of the China Aster.
Such monstrosities, from 
the fact of the essential organs not being in any way implicated, are capable of per- 
fectly impregnating their ovules.
Thus a knowledge of the mode in which impletion 
occurs, is of importance to the gardener, in order that he may be enabled to calculate 
on the possibility of producing new varieties by seed.
Dr. Lindley says that " these changes always occur in the order of development, or 
from the circumference to the centre ; that is to say, that the calyx is transformed into 
petals, petals into stamens, and stamens into ovaria ; but that the reverse does not take 
place." In proof of this hypothesis he further says " that if the metamorphosis took 
place from the centre to the circumference, or in a direction inverse to the order of 
development, it would not be easy to show the cause of the greater beauty of double 
flowers than of single ; because the inevitable consequence of a reversed order of trans- 
formation would be that the rich or delicate colour of the petals, upon which all flow- 
ers depend for their beauty, would be converted into the uniform green of the calyx.
Such a change therefore, instead of increasing the beauty of a flower, and making it 
superior to its original, would tend to destroy its beauty altogether." Now were this 
hypothesis correct, and founded on fact, what ought to be the condition in which we 
find the organs in double flowers ?
We ought surely to find the centre of the flower 
filled up with an increased number of pistils.
But is this the case ?
It is plain it is 
not ; indeed, were it the case, the beauty of a double flower would be most effectually 
destroyed.
This theory must therefore fall to the ground, and we must confess that 
we are unable to find any laws by which the order of ti'ansmutation, in such monsters, 
is governed.
The aim and object with the cultivators of double flowers, is to convert all the flo- 
ral organs into petals, and we generally refer to cultivation as the cause of flowers be- 
coming double ; farther than this we are ignorant of the causes of their impletion.
â€” 
They probably owe their origin, at first, to accidental circumstances, and afterwards 
the variety is carefully propagated by the methods usually adopted for that purpose.
The two classes of vegetable functions, namely, the vegetative and reproductive, 
notwithstanding their close connexion, appear to be performed, in some degree, in op- 
position the one to the other ; thus any excessive development of the one class, takes 
place at the expense of the other.

â€” Notes on Botanical Excursions from Glasgow during 
the past Summer.
By J.
H. Balfour, M.D., Regius Professor 
of Botany in the University of Glasgow.
During last summer I made botanical excursions every week with 
my pupils, and the results of some of these will, I hope, not be unin- 
teresting to the readers of ' The Phytologist.' 
My first trip was to Bowling, a small village on the banks of the 
Clyde, about ten miles west of Glasgow.
The vegetation of the trap 
rocks in the neighbourhood is very luxuriant, but no plants of parti- 
cular interest were gathered, except Glyphomitrion Daviesii.
Our 
visit to Campsie Glen was more productive.
Here my pupil Mr.
Macleod picked Equisetum Drummondii, â€” the first time it had been 
seen in the neighbourhood of Glasgow.
I have no doubt that this 
plant is abundant in many woods, and has often been mistaken for E.
arvense.
I picked it in profusion afterwards near the Falls of Clyde.
Among other plants met with in or near the Glen I may notice Geum 
intermedium, a plant which is common in all the woods in this neigh- 
bourhood, Viola lutea.
Campanula latifolia.
Geranium lucidum, Car- 
damine amara, Stellaria nemorum, Lysimachia thyrsiflora, Polypodium 
Phegopteris, Vaccinium Oxycoccos and Buxbaumia aphylla.
Carex 
pauciflora was also seen in marshy ground near Strathblane, at a much 
lower level than usual.
The wooded banks of the Clyde at Hamilton and Cadzow furnish 
an amjDle supply of plants for the student of Botany.
Here we found 
Carex pendula, sylvatica and pallescens, Cardamine amara and Stel- 
laria nemorum in great luxuriance.
Veronica montana, Epipactis 
latifolia.
Arum raaculatum, Doronicum Pardalianches, Trollius euro- 
paeus, Ornithogalum umbellatum, Euonymus europaeus.
Viburnum 
Opulus, Ribes alpinum, Ophioglossum vulgatum and Scolopendrium 
vulgare.
Near Bothwell Castle and Blantyre Priory we saw Carex 
reniota, Aquilegia vulgaris, Berberis vulgaris, Galium boreale.
Gera- 
nium phaeum and Allium vineale.
On the banks of the Clyde some 
alpine plants occur at an elevation considerably below that at which 
2m 
402 
they usually grow.
Thus, near the Falls of Corra Lin there is consi- 
derable profusion of Saxifraga oppositifolia and Asplenium viride, â€” 
alpine ])lants, which, however, are not found on the mountains in the 
vicinity.
The facilities afforded by railway and steam enabled us to visit 
many interesting localities at a considerable distance from Glasgow.
One of these was the island of Bute, famous for the mildness of its 
climate.
We proceeded along the shore from Rothesay towards 
Mount-Stuart, and returned by a road across the island.
In the 
course of our walk we gathered Cotyledon Umbilicus in great abun- 
dance, Anagallis tenella, Saxifraga aizoides, Pinguicula lusitanica, 
Alisma ranunculoides, Sinapis monensis, Veronica scutellata, Anthyl- 
lis Vulneraria, Alsine peploides, Scirpus pauciflorus, Carex panicula- 
ta, Poa maritima, Osmvmda regalis and Scolopendrium vulgare.
Our next excursion was made in the neighbourhood of Ratho, a vil- 
lage about ten miles west from Edinburgh.
We examined chiefly 
Ravelrig Bog and Dalmahoy Hills.
In the woods at Dalmahoy we 
picked Cephalanthera ensifolia, Pyrola minor and Listera ovata ; and 
on Dalmahoy Hill, Saxifraga hypnoides, Viola lutea, Trientalis euro- 
pa3a and Epilobium angustifohum.
In Ravelrig Bog and the woods 
near it, we saw Corallorhiza innata, Listera cordata, Potamogeton 
oblongus and Linnaea borealis.
Before returning to Glasgow we paid 
a visit to Linlithgow, and in the loch near the palace we found pro- 
fusion of Ceratophyllum submersum ?
Potamogeton crispus and pu- 
sillus.
Nasturtium terrestre and Poa aquatica.
The kindness of my friend John Smith Esq. LL.D., enabled us on 
another occasion to visit the romantic glens in the neighbourhood of 
his residence at Crutherland, about eleven miles south-east from Glas- 
gow.
On the wooded banks we met with Carex stricta in considera- 
ble quantity, Carex sylvatica and remota, Epilobium angustifolium, 
Milium effusum, Impatiens Noli-me-tangere, Cistopteris fragilis, Po- 
lypodium Dryopteris and Phegopteris.
On the moors in the neigh- 
bourhood grow Drosera anglica, Vaccinium Oxycoccos, Veronica 
scutellata, Callitriche platycarpa, Rhynchospora alba, Lycopodium 
Selago and Splachnum mnioides.
Near Langlands I gathered Peu- 
cedanum Ostruthium* and Lamium maculatum, var.
ft.
laivigatum.
The Island of Arran is interesting in a botanical as well as a geolo- 
gical point of view, and the facilities afforded by the Ayr railway and 
* This plant was also picked subsequently near Kilwinning in Ayrshire, by nay pu- 
pil Mr. James C.
Murray.
403 
the steam-boats from Ardrossan, induced me to visit it.
The party 
spent two days on the island, making Brodick their head-quarters.
Our first walk extended from Brodick, along the shore to Lamlash ; 
then to Whiting Bay, Dippin Point and Kildonnan Castle, whence 
we returned to Brodick.
During this walk we gathered many inte- 
resting plants, among which may be mentioned Sinapis monensis, 
Steenhammera maritima (the oyster-plant as it is called), Glaux ma- 
ritima, Poa maritima, Ammophila arenaria, Juncus maritimus and 
Gerardi, Scirpus maritimus, Blysmus ruius.
Aster Tripolium, Solidago 
Virgaurea, Plantago maritima and Coronopus, Anagallis tenella and 
arvensis, Habenaria bifolia and chlorantha, Gymnadenia conopsea.
Ranunculus sceleratus, Althaja officinalis, Atriplex rosea, Bromus ar- 
vensis, Carex arenaria, extensa and laevigata, Qilnanthe crocata and 
pimpinelloides, Potamogeton oblongus, Erythraja Centaurium (a va- 
riety with very narrow leaves, the |3.
compressa of some authors), and 
Lycopodium selaginoides.
Between Lamlash and Whiting Bay there 
is profusion of Hypericum dubium (Leers) and Androsa^mum, Coty- 
ledon Umbilicus, Agrimonia Eupatoria, Eupatorium cannabinum, 
and Isolepis setacea.
Near Dippin Point, where there are fine trap 
clifis, we met with Convolvulus sepiuni, Verbascum Thapsus, Sola- 
num Dulcamara, Conium maculatum, Ligusticum scoticum and Vicia 
sylvatica.
In our second day's walk we proceeded by the sea-shore towards 
the northern part of the island.
We visited Glen Sannox, ascended 
Goatfell, and returned by Glen Rosa to Brodick.
Along the shore 
we found many of the species picked on the previous day, and besides 
these we noticed Drosera anglica, Lycopus europa?us.
Polygonum la- 
pathifolium, Osmunda regalis, Bidens tripartita, Corydalis claviculata.
Near the Inn at Brodick there is profusion of a variety of Mentha ro- 
tundifolia, called velutina by Mr. Babington ; and here also we picked 
specimens of Pastinaca sativa.
In Glen Sannox we searched in vain 
for Avena planiculmis, which was discovered there several years ago 
by Mr. Stewart Murray.
The ascent of Goatfell from this glen is 
very steep and difficult, and the granitic debris is very unproductive.
Goatfell itself, although attaining an elevation of about 2700 feet, does 
not yield many alpine plants.
This may arise partly fiom its insular 
situation, and partly from the nature of the dry granitic rocks of which 
it is composed.
The plants picked by the party were Saxifraga ai- 
zoides and stellaris, Salix herbacea, Sedum Rhodiola, Alchimilla al- 
])ina, Armeria maritima, var.
&. alpina, Empetrum nigrum, Juniperus 
communis, var.

Selago.
On descending into Glen Rosa we picked Drosera anglica, 
Lylhrum Salicaria, Molinia ca^rulea, var.
l3.
alpina, Rhynchospora al- 
ba, Galeopsis versicolor, Habenaria bifolia and chlorantha and Vacci- 
nium Vitis-Idgea.
On the sea-sliore near the inn we also gathered 
Sagina maritima and Eryngium maritimum.
With the view of examining the Flora of the alpine districts, we 
made an excursion in July to the mountains on the shores of Loch 
Lomond.
Leaving Glasgow at 4, P.M., we reached Tarbet in the 
evening.
Here we took up our residence for two days, and made ex- 
cursions in the neighbourhood.
On the first day we proceeded along 
the shores of Loch Lomond, as far as the Sloy water; we then as- 
cended the stream to Loch Sloy, and thence commenced our ascent 
of Ben Voirlich, a high hill near the head of Loch Lomond.
On the 
shores of the Loch we picked Osmunda regahs and Hymenophyllum 
Tunbridgense and Wilsoni, Hypericum Androssemum and Betula al- 
ba and glutinosa.
In Loch Sloy, Lobelia Dortmanna, Littorella la- 
custris and Subularia aquatica were seen.
On Ben Voirlich the alpine 
plants collected were Alchimilla alpina, Silene acaulis, Sibbaldia pro- 
cumbensj Cerastium alpinum, J uncus trifidus and triglumis, Saussurea 
alpina, Gnaphalium supinum, Hieracium alpinum, Saxifraga aizoides, 
stellaris, hypnoides and nivalis, Carex rigida, Polystichum Lonchitis, 
Sedum Rhodiola, Polygonum viviparum, Poa alpina, and a new Poa, 
called by Dr. Parnell P.
Balfouri, Aira alpina and var.
vivipara, Fes- 
tuca ovina, var.
e. vivipara, Epilobium alpinum and Thalictrum alpi- 
num.
Carex saxatilis was gathered in great profusion on the descent 
of the hill towards the head of Loch Lomond.
On the second day 
Ben Lomond was visited, and on it, besides most of the alpine 
plants already noticed on Ben Voirlich, we saw Rubus suberectus and 
Chamsemorus, Scutellaria galericulata, Salix arenaria and Asplenium 
viride.
On the shores of Loch Lomond we particularly remarked the great 
quantity of fruit produced this season, by the ordinary trees, as birch, 
beech, oak, alder, hazel, apple, holly, &c.

Sir, 
In the course of my botanising this season through the 
peculiarly rich and interesting district within ten miles of Edinburgh, 
having observed several plants not noted in the last List of the Flora 
of that district, I beg to hand you the catalogue of them, with habitats 
&c.
; and also notes on a few of the rarer or more interesting species 
previously observed.
If you should consider this trifling contribution 
to our knowledge of local Botany worthy of insertion in your valua- 
ble periodical, it is at your service.
I am.
Sir, 
Your very obedient Servant, 
Thos.
Edmonston.
To the Editor of ' The Phytologist.' 
Bidens cernua, (3.
radiata.
Lochend.
Bromus velutinus.
Some dwarf specimens of the variety (3.
occur- 
red near Musselburgh.
Callitriche platycarpa.
Compensation pond on the Pentland hills, 
Lochend and Duddingston Lochs, &c.
Afterwards observed in the 
former station by Mr. Babington, who assures me it is the true plant.
It has not, I think, been previously noticed out of England.
Carex divisa.
Pentland hills, scarce.
â€ž incurva.
Musselburgh and Dalmeney.
I also, late in the 
season, picked what I believe was this plant near St. David's, on the 
Fife side of the Firth, but it was too far gone to be identified proper- 
ly.
This species is probably often passed over as C.
arenaria.
Cerastium holosteoides.
The C.
triviale, var.
&. Jtolosteoides, of the 
Edinburgh Botanical Society's Catalogue (2nd edit.) seems a distinct 
plant, as I shall soon endeavour to prove.
The Edinburgh specimens 
agree with some from Kinfauns in Perthshire, exhibited at the Bota- 
nical Society last winter.
Dalkeith.
Cerastium (tomentosum ?
). Hills behind Aberdour.
Dianthus glaucus, Linn.
(D.
deltoides, $.
glaucus^ Hook.) Left 
unmarked in the Edinburgh Catalogue, but abundant in the King's 
Park.
1 should be disposed to consider it distinct.
Festuca ovina, e.
vivipara.
Pentland hills, above Collinton.
It 
406 
appears to me that some confusion exists with regard to the species 
called F.
vivipara by Smith.
The plant figured by that author [Eng.
Bot. 1355], and abundant on all our more elevated hills, especially 
those of a micaceous character, seems to be distinct from the common 
F. ovina of our plains.
It is not improbable that the alpine plant is 
the viviparous state of a distinct grass, which, from the great disposi- 
tion of alpine grasses to assume the viviparous character, is seldom 
seen in its normal form, and is therefore sunk into F.
ovina.
The 
study of the alpine plant would repay any one conveniently situated 
for that purpose.
I may notice, en passant, the curious tendency of 
alpine grasses, such as Aira alpina, Poa alpina, &c., to become vivi- 
parous.
It would almost appear an effort of nature to make up for 
the paucity of seeds matured in such situations.
Pimpinella magna.
I am not aware of this having been detected 
previously in Scotland.
It occurs abundantly by the hedge-sides, 
shortly after leaving the village of Collinton, and proceeding west- 
wards ; probably merely a luxuriant variety of P.
Saxifraga.
The 
Collinton specimens agree perfectly with those from the Isle of Wight 
and numerous others in my collection.
Polygonum Rati.
This is surely often confounded with the mari- 
time variety of P.
aviculare (I presume " P.
maritimum, L." of the 
Edinburgh Catalogue), for the true plant occurs abundantly on both 
sides of the Firth of Forth.
This is surely not the P.
Koberti of the 
continental botanists, of which I possess specimens from the shores 
of the Adriatic, &c.
Ranunculus Jluitans, Lam. Though now raised to the rank of a 
species, I cannot believe this to be anything more than one of the 
multifarious varieties of R.
aquatilis ; the differences merely lie in the 
very peculiar habit.
It is sometimes two or three feet long, but this 
is occasioned by its growing in deeper water ; it has also a curious 
tufted and sometimes almost geniculated appearance.
Lochend.
Rubus nitidus, rhamnifolius, suherectus.
Craigmillar Castle.
I 
doubt not that many more of the reputed species of bramble may be 
found in this neighbourhood, and those fond of multiplying specific 
distinctions in this troublesome and intricate genus, will have abun- 
dant opportunity about the above-named station, the Peebles road, 
Dalkeith, Craigleith, and numerous other localities near Edinburgh.
I will not attempt to name any but the above three, and I must con- 
fess, from my mite of experience, that I do think, without the slightest 
danger of confounding distinct plants, the arrangement of Koch might 
be followed in distinguishing nearly all our British species.
407 
Salvia Sclarea.
Armistoii and Dalkeith ; in all probability the 
outcast of a garden.
Samhuciis nigra, /3.
laciniaia.
Collinton, Auchindenny and Dal- 
housie woods.
Saxifraga platypetala.
Abundant at Habbie's How, Pentland hills.
Whether this is only one of the forms of S.
hypnoides, or a distinct 
species, seems still doubtful.
The flowers are as large as, and have 
quite the appearance of, those of S.
granulata, and the habit is more 
lax and elongated than in the common form.
Viola lactea.
Arthur's Seat.
A variety of V.
canina, as I have 
proved by seeing every intermediate stage.
SPECIES PREVIOUSLY OBSERVED IN THE DISTRICT.
Adonis autumnalis.
Fields near Comely bank; probably introduced.
Alopecurus agrestis.
Preston pans.
Beautiful specimens and very 
abundant in this station.
Arctium Bardana.
This is again restored to the rank of a species, 
but I am unable to see permanent characters, and I must confess it 
seems to run into A.
Lappa.
What I believe to be an intermediate 
state, is the most common burdock about Edinburgh.
Bromus madritensis.
Grange toll.
Barharea prcBcox.
Roslin, Currie, &c., not uncommon.
The small 
flowers and large radical leaves of this plant are very constant in all 
the specimens I have seen.
Cardamine sylvatica.
Very abundant, but appearing to run into 
C. hirsuta.
In habit it combines the herbage of C.
amara with the 
flowers of C.
hirsuta, and is apparently a luxuriant variety of the latter.
Carex axillaris.
Said to be found near Craigmillar Castle, but I 
have been unable to detect it there, and specimens I have seen under 
this name from that station, were varieties of C.
remota.
Carex vesicaria.
Duddingston Loch.
Cichorium Intyhus.
A rare Scottish plant, but very abundant and 
certainly indigenous near Granton, on the green slope on both sides 
of the road between the pier and Wardie.
Cochlearia danica.
Abundant on both sides of the Firth.
Doronicum Pardalianches.
Dalkeith, Hunter's tryste, &c.
D.plan- 
tagineum is said to occur, but I cannot detect permanent characters.
Eranthis hyemalis, Craigmillar Castle.

some plants came up in newly 
trenched ground ; these have how- 
ever nearly disappeared again.
The 
cultivation of it has ceased for about 
half a century ; and the fact of its

â€” A List of the rarer Flowering Plants and Ferns of the 
Neighbourhood of Dumfries ; with Remarks on the Physical 
Conditions of the District.
By Peter Gray, Esq.
Annexed is a list of the less common flowering plants and fems, 
growing in the vicinity of Dumfries ; and perhaps, by way of intro- 
duction, a hasty sketch of the boundaries and physical aspect of the 
region thus illustrated, may not be altogether inappropriate.
The Nith, in its course through the district to which it gives name, 
flows through three basins or valleys, which, according to the specu- 
lations of some geologists, have, at a remote period, formed the beds 
of as many lakes, successively drained by the river into the Solway 
Frith.
The lowest of these, the vale of Dumfries, is enclosed on all 
sides, except the south, by hills chiefly composed of greywacke, and, 
viewed from the heights around that town, presents a natural amphi- 
theatre of great beauty ; the undulating surface characteristic of the 
new red sandstone formation, here the predominating one, together 
with the intersecting ridges that mark the outer channels of the prin- 
cipal river and its tributary streams, tending pleasingly to diversify 
the scenery of the interior.
The immediately environing hills are of no great height ; but, on 
the north, the Moffat range, and among them Queensbeny, which at- 
tains an elevation of 2259 feet, overtop these, and, although at some 
distance, appear continuous.
On the west, the numerous ravines be- 
tween them are filled, and the hills themselves belted or crowned with, 
plantations of modern growth, abounding in Rubus saxatilis, Vacci- 
nium Myrtillus, Polypodium Phegopteris and Dryopteris ; where bare 
of wood, Gymnadenia conopsea, G.
albida, Habenaria viridis and Ly- 
copodium clavatum, alpinum, Selago and selaginoides, are also met 
with.
Criffel, a syenitic hill 1895 feet high, forms the southern ter- 
minus of these hills, and although good ground for the cryptogamist, 
is nowise rich in the i-arer flowering plants.
Loch Kinder, at its base, 
furnishes Lobelia Dortmanna in abundance.
On the south-east, and approaching close upon the town, lies the 
extensive morass of Lochar Moss, occujDying many thousand acres.
Although not perhaps so fruitful in botanical rarities as might be an- 
ticipated from its great extent, this moss contains a few good plants.
Among these may be enumerated the pretty little Utricularia minor, 
in some places exceedingly abundant, Ranunculus Lingua, Drosera 
longifolia and anglica, Bidens tripartita, with several of lesser note.
417 
I shall just particularize another locality, to which frequent refer- 
ence will be made in the catalogue.
Near the suburb of Maxwelton 
there is, or rather has been, a system of small lochs, now all drained, 
with the exception of the last of the series, itself considerably reduced 
in size.
This little district, while it may be said to present an epit- 
ome of the dale in its geographical details, affords also almost every 
species found in the valley, with others â€” such as Carex limosa, C.
fi- 
liformis, Eriophorum pubescens, Lysimachia vulgaris and Lycopus 
europaeus â€” that have not been observed in any other part of the latter.
These circumstances, together with its proximity to the town, ren- 
der it the favourite haunt of our Dumfries botanists.

Third, in the province Berber, the city Chartum and the village 
Gubba, the island Tutti near Chartum ; the villages Abu Haschim, 
Abu Hamed, with the island Mograd and Kalebsche, and the great 
desert of Berber.
It is therefore evident that our traveller made best 
use of the short space of time allotted to him, in extending his excur- 
sions as much as possible through a great variety of locality, namely, 
mountains, hills, plains, lakes, river-sides &c., circumstances however 
prevented him in a great measure from taking the altitudes and noting 
other particulars of the mountainous districts.

We have already given a few extracts from this work (Phytol.
301), 
and as our limits are very circumscribed, we cannot now do better 
than allow the author himself to explain the design and scope of 
the book before us.
" I WILL admit in limine that I am not here writing to instruct the professional 
student of Botany.
Neither do I aim to surprise my brother botanists by any new ar- 
rangements in classification or discoveries in physiology.
But if I take a humbler 
rank than the dignity of science may seem to warrant, and thus make no advances in 
their estimation, still I hope I may be in some degree useful in attracting the many to 
the pleasures afforded by an examination of plants in their wild localities, and thus, 
indirectly at least, subserve the cause of Natural History, by enlisting recruits, whose 
enthusiasm may perchance be awakened by my incitations to observation and adventure.
" In my experience as a practical collecting botanist for some years, I have jnva- 
421 
riably found that however my botanical friends might tate fire at the exhibition of my 
specimens or the mention of their habitats, that the uninitiated in these things were 
unable to comprehend the sources of my pleasure, and could not understand on what 
principle I could experience delight in making long journeys, and taking fatiguing 
rambles, merely in search of plants.
* * The neglect of physical 
and mental enjoyment lying within the reach of almost every body, appears to me to 
arise from a false supposition that the toils attendant upon the study of Botany would 
greatly counterbalance any pleasure to be derived from it.
In these papers, then, I 
aim to show how incorrect such a conclusion is ; â€” and, in monthly order, my object 
has been to produce delineations which, even to the general eye of those imfamiliar 
with botanical terms, shall offer charms which may tempt the leisure of those who de- 
sire a pleasing and instructive occupation ; while I have introduced incident to show 
that the botanist, during his rambles, may still look out with all the gusto of a travel- 
ler superadded to his scientific examinations â€” while the stores of his collecting-book 
will make " a wet day at an inn " veiy different from " the wet day " so graphically 
described by Washington Irving."

" Treating the subject thus lightly, I may hope to attract some whose attention 
would shrink from the study of more laboured treatises â€” and the ardent enquirer, if 
he accompanies me for excitement, will find abundant works before the public, where 
the sparks here kindled, may contribute fuel to the continuation and duration of the 
scientific flame he desires to nourish with increasing and perennial vigour.
Even the 
proficient in botanical study may not be displeased with the allusions made to the ha- 
bitats of some of his favourites; since as iron sharpeneth iron, so is enterprise awa- 
kened by the narration of the humblest pilgrim to the shrine that is the object of the 
reverence of his fraternity." â€” Preface.
Were we disposed to be critical, we might perchance quarrel a lit- 
tle with the author's style, and say that it is, in some places, rather 
too sentimental ; but this, if it be a fault at all, is one into which a 
writer may readily fall, if, when he treats of flowers, they suggest to 
his mind other ideas than such as relate simply to their utility or sci- 
entific an-angement.
However, " take it for all in all," we hail the 
* Botanical Looker-Out ' as a very agreeable contribution to our stock 
of popular works on Botany.

Note on Brywn pyriforme, (Phytol.
398).
In the ' Muscologia Britannica ' 
of Hooker and Taylor, it is stated that this moss " is remarkable in the shape of its 
leaves, of which the upper ones are the longest and most flexuose.
They are com- 
posed, moreover, except at the very base, almost wholly of nerve ; there being only a 
2 o 
426 
narrow membranous margin, which, toicards the extremities, is deeply serrated." These 
remarks apply only to the perichaetial leaves (for the others are without serratures), and 
the term " deeply serrated " is somewhat too strong, even when thus limited.
I have 
no doubt whatever that the same meaning was intended to be conveyed in the ' Brit- 
ish Flora;' but that through an error of the transcriber (in the attempt perhaps to ab- 
breviate the passage) the language there used has a quite different import.
I have 
examined all the specimens in the herbarium of the author, and can therefore assure 
Mr. Gibson that two species have not been confounded under this name.
Bryum py- 
liforme is indeed a peculiar species ; the moss most resembling it is B.
gracile (Wil- 
son).
In a barren state it has considerable affinity with Phascum alternifolium of 
Schweegrichen ; but when in fruit, I know of no moss, whether British or foreign, 
which is likely to be mistaken for it.
It is moreover one of the very few mosses which 
produce " anthers and pistils '' within the same envelope ; a circumstance which has 
not escaped the notice of Bruch and Schimper in their elaborate ' Bryologia Europaea.' 
In case this work should not be in Mr, Gibson's possession, I may mention that seve- 
ral new species, allied to B.
casspitilium, have been introduced into it; and it may 
be worth while for those who have the opportunity, carefully to examine and compare 
such mosses as generally pass for B.
capillare, B.
tnrbinatum &c., in their various as- 
pects and localities, with a view to ascertain the validity of the distinctions insisted 
upon in that work.

Note on Hierochloe borealis.
I fear it will be a veiy difficult matter to get a 
British specimen of Hierochloe borealis ; and I think I run no risk of contradiction 
when I say there is not a living botanist who has gathered it.
For several years when 
residing in Angus-shire (my native county), my attention was directed to its discovery, 
but without success.
The locality given in Hooker's 'British Flora,' â€” "a narrow 
mountain valley called Kella, in Angus-shire,'' I was never able to find.
There is, 
about three miles from Arbroath, a place called Kelly-glen, that is a narrow valley but 
not a mountain one ; neither do I think the plant in question is to be found there, at 
any rate I was never so fortunate as to find it, nor have Professors Graham and Bal- 
four, nor any of the numerous parties which almost annually proceed from Edinburgh 
to the mountains of Angus-shire, ever met with it.

Institution, Dumfries, November 7, 1842.

Potentilla tridentata.
There are several others of the late Mr. G.
Don's disco- 
veries which have never been found except by himself, such as Potentilla tridentata ; 
of which very rare plant I possess an original specimen, given me by Mr. James Reid, 
gardener to Sir James Carnegie, of Southesk.
There is no locality attached to the 
specimen ; and Mr. Reid informed me that although an intimate friend of Mr. Don, 
he knew the localities of very few of his rare plants.

231.
Phascum axillare and patens.
About a fortnight since I found Phascum ax- 
illare in fruit, in great profusion, on the bank of a newly made ditch near the Reigate 
station of the Dover Railway, where the soil is particularly light.
It appeared to me 
so very early for the fruiting of this moss (March being the time given in Hooker's 
Flora) that I thought the fact worth recording.
The axillary capsule renders this spe- 
cies particularly interesting, and indeed I think it the most beautiful of our Phasca.
At the same time I found Phascum patens in fruit : this was also growing on the side 
of a newly made ditch, near the above-named spot, the soil a stiff' clay ; it was by no 
427 
means plentiful.
This very minute but interesting moss differs very widely from the 
other species of the genus, in its patent serrated leaves, which are beautifully reticu- 
lated, with the nerve disappearing below the point.
I shall be glad to supply any of 
your correspondents with specimens â€” of the former species more particularly, until my 
stock shall have become exhausted.

Cibotium Baromez, (Phytol.
63).
I must tell you that I again have a fine 
frond of Cibotium Baromez, seven feet long, sparingly in fruit.
This is the third 
time the plant has fruited with us, which is rather singular, as there has been no par- 
ticular care bestowed upon it; and why should it persist in flowering here and not 
elsewhere ?

Note on Hypericum perforatum, ^.
angmtifolium, Koch; H.
veronense, Schrank.
As this plant has not been noticed by any British writer, perhaps it will be interesting 
to some of your readers to know that it has been found this season.
On the 6th of 
July last, in company with my friend Mr. Tatham, I made a short excursion in 
the immediate neighbourhood of Settle, for the purpose of making myself ac- 
quainted with a few of the Carices of that part.
At Giggleswick Scar I met with the 
above Hypericum; the plant was plentiful, but as it was only just coming into flower 
at that time, I did not gather much of it.
As Mr. Tatham is on the spot I may per- 
haps, through his kindness, be able to procure specimens next season.
â€” Samuel Gib- 
son ; Hebden Bridge, November 8, 1842.
[The receipt of Mr Gibson's communication reminded us of a specimen of a nar- 
row-leaved Hypericum, received in 1839 from Mr. Cameron, of the Birmingham Bo- 
tanic Garden.
It is labelled " Hypericum perforatum, var.
microphyllum ?
Ludlow: 
1839." Not being able to find the letter which accompanied the specimen, we wrote 
to Birmingham respecting it, and have been favoured with the following reply from 
Mr. Westcott.
Our specimen is much more branched than Hypericum perforatum 
generally is, the branches being nearly erect ; the leaves are very narrow, and their 
edges revolute.
â€” Ed.'] 
234.
Note on the narrow-leaved Hypericum from Ludlow.
The Hypericum was 
first observed by Mr. Cameron and myself, in the year 1839, on the walls of Ludlow 
Castle, and since that time on many of the walls which surround the Castle.
I have 
also this year found it on the rocks of Whitcliffe, and on the hedge-banks near the 
Angel-bank, Clee hills.
In the year 1839, Mr. Cameron and myself brought roots of 
it from the walls of the Castle, and on our return they were planted in the Binning- 
ham Botanic Garden, where the plant has continued to flourish, still retaining its cha- 
racter.
I have some recollection that we sent you a specimen on our return, under 
the name of Hypericum perforatum, var.
microphyllum ; but on further observation I 
conceive it to be distinct from that plant in its inflorescence, and as I cannot find that 
such a variety is described in any author to which I have access, I have called it H.
perforatum, var.
linearifolium.
The plant is from one foot to a foot and a half high, 
less branched, and in all its parts much smaller than Hypericum perforatum ; branches 
more erect and compact, not diffuse ; inflorescence more corymbose than paniculate.

Lapsana pmilla, Willd.
I had the pleasure to meet with this singular and 
interesting little plant, in considerable abundance, during the late season (1842), in 
the sandy meadows west of the " Broom fields," on Bexley Heath.
I believe it is 
scarce in some districts ; it is not mentioned in either the Faversham, the Yorkshire, 
the Manchester, or any other local Flora to which I have referred, nor do I remember 
428 
to have observed it in any station so near the metropolis as the one just given.

Cyperus fmcus, L.
It may be interesting to the readers of ' The Phytologist ' 
to be informed that this exceedingly scarce species still exists in its only recorded Brit- 
ish locality, where it was first noticed by the late Mr. Haworth, namely, Eel-brook 
meadow, a marshy pasture situate between Walham Green and Parson's Green, be- 
yond Little Chelsea, Middlesex.
On a visit to the spot in September, 1841, 1 was so 
fortunate as to obtain several good specimens, although it required some patience and 
diligence in order to detect them, the entire plant being of inconspicuons appearance, 
and only a few inches in height.

Note on Pyrola uniflora, L.
I am not aware if any of our hand-books men- 
tion that this species seems to possess a similar property with that appertaining to our 
three Droseras, as observed by Sir W.
J. Hooker and Mr, Wilson, (Brit.
Flora, 132, 
4th ed.) At least, judging from specimens in my own possession, labelled as having 
been collected in the woods at Scone, Perthshire, by Mr. W.
Gardiner, jun.
of Dun- 
dee, the single-flowered winter-green, like the British species of Drosera, retains the 
property of staining the paper that lies next to it in the herbarium, of a deep rusty rose 
colour, so that the form of the plant is distinctly represented through to the back of 
the sheet on which it is fastened, and also upon the backs of several others which, at 
different times, may have lain above it, and this although the specimens are perfectly 
dry.

[We can confirm our correspondent's observations on this plant ; other species of 
Pyrola appear to possess the same property.

Habitats for Petroselinum segetum, Koch, and Carex Pseudo -Cyperus, L.
For 
the use of the youthful botanists resident in or near the " great metropolis," to whom 
information of the whereabouts of any of the rarer species is a desideratum, I would 
mention that of Petroselinum segetum.
Of this plant I gathered specimens a sum- 
mer or two ago from Charlton lane, and about the church-yard wall, Charlton, Kent, 
which, if I mistake not, is an unpublished station for this pretty species.
And of the 
beautiful Carex Pseudo-Cyperus, in June, 1842, I noticed several large tufts growing 
by the margins of some shallow pools, near where excavations for brick-earth were in 
operation, at the Highgate end of Maiden lane, HoUoway, Middlesex, a short distance 
from the Highgate cemetery.
â€” Id.
[Petroselinum segetum is not uncommon in some of the marshy ground near Lon- 
don, as between the Thames and the lower road to Deptford, where it sometimes grows 
to a considerable size.

Enquiry respecting Byssus harbata, Eng. Bot.
I enclose you a specimen of a 
byssoid substance, or fungus, gathered by myself last week from a mass of decaying 
timber supporting the roof of a drift-way in an iron-mine at Clurewell Meend, Forest 
of Dean, Gloucestershire, 318 feet below the surface of the ground.
When I first 
saw it in the mine by candle-light, it presented a very beautiful appearance, looking 
like a golden fleece with every hair glistening with moisture.
It extended over a con- 
siderable surface of the roof of the drift-way, and on its sides, as far as the decaying 
timber extended.
It no doubt belongs to the old genus Byssus of authors, which, hav- 
ing been abolished for sheltering too many outcasts of other genera, our present species 
has been turned out of doors, and from the glorious uncertainty of modern botanical 
nomenclature, especially in the fungoid tribes, I do not know where to find it.
It 
certainly appears to me to bear a close resemblance to, if indeed it be not absolutely 
429 
identical with, the Byssus barbata of ' English Botany,' as drawn by Sowerby; and at 
p. 181 of Hooker's ' English Flora,' v.
pt.
ii.
Fungi, it is incidentally stated that this 
Byssus barbata of ' English Botany ' is Ozonium auricomum.
No authority however 
is given for this name, and on turning to the index for Ozonium, no such name occurs.
Under these circumstances, being dubious as to whether the Byssus barbata of Smith 
and Sowerby is described at all in the cryptogamic volumes of Hooker's ' British Flo- 
ra,' perhaps some fungological reader of ' The Phytologist ' may be able to give some 
information on the subject, or refer me to a recent volume where the plant is noticed 
under its present recognised name.
I recollect no very late notice of the occurrence 
of this production in local Floras.

Bryum pyriforme.
Under this species the authors of ' Muscologia Britanni- 
ca ' observe â€” " They (the leaves) are formed, moreover, almost wholly of nerve ; there 
being only a narrow membranous margin, which, towards the extremity, is deeply ser- 
rated; " (Ed. 1, p.
118).
I pointed out to Dr. Taylor, a few months ago, the discre- 
pancy between this and the corresponding remarks in ' English Flora ' (quoted by Mr.
Gibson), and we agreed that, if not an error of the press, it was to be referred to an in- 
advertence on the part of the author of the latter work.
As to the actual facts, I have 
assuredly never seen the leaves of Bryum pyriforme serrated " at the base:'-' my York- 
shire specimens show faint serratures near the points of the leaves, but in a specimen 
now before me, gathered at Blarney, near Cork, since the publication of 'Flora Hiber- 
nica,' they are far more distinct.
The figure in 'Muse.
Brit.' does certainly not repre- 
sent the leaf " deeply serrated,'' and yet I cannot doubt that the authors of that work 
saw what they described.
Mr. Gibson need not be told (for no one knows better than 
he) that mosses, as well as other plants, are liable to variation in this respect.

Note on the discovery of Statice tatarica, near Portsmouth.
I beg to commu- 
nicate to your esteemed periodical the discovery of Statice tatarica as a British plant.
It has been observed by myself, as well as by Mrs. Robinson of this town, on the shore 
between Wicker Hard and Cams, on the borders of Portsmouth Harbour : I have also 
noticed it growing by the side of Fareham Creek, from half a mile to a mile below the 
town.
I was at first undecided to what species to refer it; but on forwarding a spe- 
cimen to Professor Lindley, he pronounced it to be S.
tatarica.
Its time of flowering 
is about the same as that of S.
Limonium ; and it is undoubtedly wild in both places.

Mr. Brand read a paper by Mr. Edmonston, jun., on the Botany of Shetland, and 
instituted a comparison between tlie number of genera and species existing in that re- 
gion, and those which occur in other districts of Scotland.
" The Botany of Shetland," observes Mr. Edmonston, " though not very exten- 
sive, is interesting.
Many of the less common (chiefly subalpine) plants are abundant 
in all situations, and many species very commonly distributed, and indeed often mark- 
ed as universal throughout Great Britain, are very rare or altogether unknown in Shet- 
land.
Among the last may be mentioned â€” Alchemilla arvensis and vulgaris, Briza 
media.
Primula veris, Anagallis arvensis.
Convolvulus arvensis, Teucrium Scorodonia, 
Geranium robertianum, Lapsana communis and others of the commonest weeds.
Again, 
Thalictrum alpimim, Blysmus rufus, and other local plants, are everywhere abundant, 
growing down to the sea level ; and sylvan plants â€” those generally associated with 
woods or luxuriant pasturage, are almost entirely wanting.
The Geology of Shetland 
is rich in interesting phenomena.
The formation is almost wholly primitive â€” the most 
abundant rocks being gneiss, mica-schist, clay and chlorite slate, granite, quartz, ser- 
pentine, limestone, &c.
; besides which there are amygdaloidal porphyritic rocks of dif- 
ferent kinds.
The difiFereuce of formation between Shetland and Orkney is very striking 
â€” that of the latter being as uninteresting as the former is the reverse.
Orkney con- 
sists chiefly of an apparent continuation of the North coast of the Mainland, being 
composed of sandstone, clay-slate, and other secondary rocks, while the Shetlands may 
be said to belong to the oceanic series of islands.
Again, the diff"erence seems as great 
between the Shetland and Faroe isles â€” for in the latter group the rocks are all basaltic.
Many of the Shetland rocks present a most remarkable degree of similarity to those of 
the South of England â€” chrome ore, native magnesia, serpentine, crystallised fluor, and 
several others, being common to both extremities of Great Britain, though rarely found 
in the intermediate space ; and it is a singular fact, that some of the plants present a 
corresponding analogy â€” as for instance, Lathyrus maritimus, &c.
" The prevalence of peat is a very characteristic feature in the general aspect of 
Shetland, and proves beyond a doubt the great abundance of trees in former ages.
â€” 
Judging from their remains, these seem chiefly to have belonged to Corylaceae and Pi- 
naceae, as trunks and nuts of the hazel, and cones of Abies Picea, have repeatedly been 
dug out of the moors.
This evidence of their existing formerly in such abundance, 
leads to the question whether they may still be grown.
I certainly do not think that 
the experiment has been fairly tried, nor is it probable that it soon will be on a scale 
that can set the matter at rest.
Indeed, many reasons seem to concur in rendering it 
unlikely that trees could be reared so as to render them profitable in an economical 
point of view.
The frosts and cold weather which often occur early in autumn do not 
leave the plants time to form their buds for hybernation before the old leaves are nip- 
ped ; and the heat of summer is by no means sufficient (as in most other northern la- 
titudes) to compensate for the shortness of its duration.
I do not attach so much im- 
portance as has sometimes been done to the influence of the sea spray, by which, during 
heavy gales, Shetland is liable to be swept â€” for these happen generally after the sap 
has descended, and when therefore the plant is dormant.
I may here mention some experimeuts which have been carried on by my father 
for five or six years, in order, if possible, to settle the question.
He obtained from 
Messrs.
Lawson, of Edinburgh, all the more generally cultivated trees and shrubs, â€” 
North British, North American, and North Asiatic, â€” and the result has been as fol- 
lows : â€” Among the indigenous trees of Scotland, the ash appears to stand as well as 
431 
any other, as it puts forth its leaves late and loses them early.
Of the scarcely indige- 
nous, or naturalised species, the plane-tree appears to be the hardiest ; while the birch 
and Scotch fir will scarcely live a year.
Again, Pinus montana and ^sculus Hippo- 
castanum, comparatively tender plants, appear to thrive well ; and Pyrus aucuparia, 
which is indigenous with us, thrives tolerably in cultivation.
Almost all the willows 
do well ; â€” Salix Russelliana, fragilis, cinerea, viminalis and vitellina, among the best.
The alder is rather too early in putting forth its leaves, but some poplars appear to do 
well, especially the white Scotch, black Italian and Lombardy, and Populus nigra is 
indigenous.
Oak and beech will not thrive at all.
Generally speaking, evergreens, 
whether trees or shrubs, appear not to suit.
Pinus Cembra, Abies Picea, black, white 
and Norway, have all been repeatedly tried, but seldom languished a year.
Even the 
hardy shrubby evergreens, which are met with indigenous, or in every shrubbery on the 
mainland, as Ilex Aquifoliutn, Hhododeridron ponticum and flavum, Viburnum Tinus 
&c., die almost immediately.
Among the best thriving evergreen shrubs may be men- 
tioned Arbutus Uva-ursi, Cotoneaster mucronata, Hedera Helix, &c.
The latter in- 
deed, is native, and in some situations thrives remarkably well, as it also does in Orkney.
" The climate of Orkney and Shetland are much alike, but scientific observations 
have only been recorded of the former.
'Regarding it,' Mr. Clouston states, 'the hioh 
latitude of Orkney will no doubt induce many well-informed persons even in Scotland 
to suppose that our winter is much colder than that of any other country, and it may 
sui-prise them when we say that our winter is as warm as that of Glasgow, and several 
degrees warmer than that of Applegarth in Dumfriesshire, on the very southern border.
This is owing to the influence of the surrounding ocean, which elevates the tempera- 
ture of winter as much as it lowers that of summer.
Thus, the temperature of Orkney 
in May, June and July, is 7 degrees below that of Glasgow dnring these months â€¢ but 
for the whole year, the mean annual temperature in Orkney is nearly the same as that 
in Applegarth â€” both being about 46 degrees, or 3f below that of Glasgow.'" 
Mr. Edmonston goes on to observe, that " the uniformity of temperature in Shet- 
land strikes every one; and a remarkable feature in the climate is the great and almost 
constant humidity.
These causes no doubt have a great influence on the veo-etation 
for there is not a semblance of arctic, and scarcely (except in a very few instances) of 
alpine vegetation throughout the whole islands.
This is certainly rather what might 
be expected than otherwise ; but there are other anomalies which cannot be altogether 
referred to climate ; and the extreme scantiness of the Flora is remarkable, consider- 
ing the extent of the islands, and the variety of soil, exposure and situation which they 
present." 
The flowering plants (including the grasses) hitherto observed in Shetland, extend 
to 94 genera and 178 species ; while those found in the district of Moray amount to 
333 genera and 692 species ; and even in a range of sixteen miles round Aberdeen 
there have been found 287 genera and 562 species ; and in a similar extent round Ed- 
inburgh, the numbers are 389 genera and 908 species â€” while the flowering plants of 
Great Britain extend to 523 genera and 1594 species.
The proportion of species to 
genera is also least in Shetland and Aberdeenshire, being only 2 to 1, whereas in the 
Edinburgh district it is 2^ to 1 ; and in Britain generally it is 3 to 1.
The statements in Mr. Edmonston's paper led to some interesting conversation 
in the course of which Professor Graham remarked, as a phenomenon which has not 
hitherto received a satisfactory solution â€” the entire destruction or absence of wood in 
many parts of Scotland where once it evidently abounded, and where the change can- 
432 
not apparently have arisen through human instrumentality ; and he observed that the 
investigation of this subject vi^ould be attended with great interest, besides being of 
importance in a national point of view.
Dr. Neill said, that in his opinion the peat mosses of Scotland have generally been 
formed at an earlier period than is usually supposed â€” ' some of them containing trees 
which do not now exist in the country ; and he suggested that means should be taken 
to ascertain the particular species of which the mosses consist, by taking specimens of 
wood and seeds, or cones &c.
from the successive layers, and duly noting their relative 
position, with all such circumstances as might tend to establish a correct theory respect- 
ing our aboriginal forest vegetation ; indeed he had once proposed that a prize should 
be offered by the Highland Society for the best essay on, this subject ; but his propo- 
sal had not been carried into effect.' 
Mr. Brand remarked that in this country, as in America, the forests in many places 
appear to have been destroyed by fire ; and he instanced some oak trees in Dalkeith 
Park, which seem to have been burnt down at an early period, and to have thrown out 
new trunks from the stumps at a later date.
Mr. Goodsir supposed that the increase of the peat might gradually render the soil 
unfit for the support of trees ; and stated, in reference to a remark made by Professor 
Graham, on the approach of the alpine plants in Shetland to the sea-edge, that this pe- 
culiarity coincided with the elevation of the deep-sea invertebrate animals, to the high- 
water mark in the same locality.
BOTANICAL SOCIETy OF LONDON.
November 4:, 1841.

Donations to the library were announced from the American Academy of Sciences, 
Philadelphia, the Horticultural Society of Berlin, and Mr. S.
P. Woodward.
British 
plants had been received from Mr. G.
W. Francis, Mr. S.
P. Woodward, Mr. D.
Stock, Mr. B.
D. Wardale, Mr. E.
Ranking and Mr. S.
Gibson.
The Chairman pre- 
sented a specimen of Cnicus Forsteri, which he said corresponded exactly with the cul- 
tivated specimen of the same species preserved in Smith's herbarium.
The specimen 
exhibited by Mr. Watson was also a cultivated one ; the root having been found near 
Whitemoor pond, in Surrey, in Jvine, 1841, and flowering specimens of it exhibited 
before the Society last year.
The wild specimens had from two to four flowers only on each stem ; whilst the 
cultivated specimens had ten or a dozen each.
Mr. W.
exhibited the specimens for 
the purpose of pointing out the differences between Cnicus Forsteri and C.
pratensis ; 
branched specimens of the latter species having been in several instances mistaken for 
the former.
Mr. Robert Ranking, F.L.S., presented a specimen of Plantago Coronopus, col- 
lected at Hastings, showing the easy and natural transition from a spike to a raceme; 
also a specimen of Dactylis glomerata, in which the glumes were become foliaceous.
The commencement of a paper was read from Mr. George Clarke, of the island of 
Mahe (communicated by Mr. H.
W. Martin), " On Lodoicea Sechellarum,'^ which will 
be concluded at the next meeting, when a copious report will be given.

Having received from a correspondent a copy of the ' Bombay 
Monthly Times for June, 1 842,' which contains some interesting par- 
ticulars relating to the Baobab-tree of Senegal, as observed in India, 
2 P 
434 
it has occurred to me that a few notes on this " colossus of the vege- 
table kingdom," even if they contain nothing new, may not be out of 
place in the pages of ' The Phytologist.' 
The Baobab is a native of Senegal and other parts of the western 
coast of Africa, from the Niger to Benin, " a part of the world," says 
Adanson, " which has always been justly looked upon as the mother 
of monsters." This celebrated French naturalist resided in Senegal 
for about five years, and was probably the first botanist who had the 
advantage of studying the Baobab in its native country.
In 1756 
M. Adanson communicated a very full account of this remarkable tree 
to the Royal Academy of Sciences at Paris; his paper, together with 
an admirable summary of it, were published in the Memoires of the 
Academy in 1761, and appear to be the chief source whence subse- 
quent writers have derived their knowledge of the Baobab.
A letter from Adanson to Linnaeus, written four years after the re- 
turn of the former from Senegal, and previously to the publication of 
the memoir mentioned above, contains the characters of his new ge- 
nus, and several remarks upon it ; the following is an extract from this 
letter, which is printed in the ' Correspondence of Linnaeus and other 
Naturalists,' ii.
467.
" Paris, Oct. 2, 1758.
" Among numerous new otservations in natural history wiiicli I have formerly com- 
municated to the Academie des Sciences, is a complete description of the Bahobab, 
which Bernard de Jussieu has named Adansonia, and of which I had long ago given a 
description hefore your letter reached me.
B. de Jussieu had refrained from sending 
you this description during my absence, that he might not deprive me of the opportu- 
Jiity of giving you pleasure.
I therefore now send the essential parts of the character 
which you ask for, taken from the Memoirs of the Academy intended for publication, 
or rather from my own Latin manuscripts, according to the plan of your Genera 
Plantarum, as I mean to give them to the public.

is the normal number.

" Seeds numerous, almost bony, kidney-shaped, lodged in friable pulp.
" Hence you may perceive how much this genus differs from the rest of the mallow 
tribe.
First, by the calyx falling off immediately after flowering; â€” second, by the 
number and situation of the filaments at the top of a monadelphous tube; â€” third, by 
the number and form of the stigmas ; â€” fourth, by the woody and close capsule, with 
its pulp and cells ; â€” fifth, the compound fingered leaves ; â€” and sixth, by the tree it- 
self, which of all hitherto discovered is tl-J most prodigious in the size of its trunk and 
branches, being as it were the stupendous vegetable monster of Africa.
This tree is 
found in the country of Senegal only, from whence its fruit, with that of the Agilhaid, 
is sent every year, as an article of commerce, to Egypt.
Some of its seeds having been 
planted there, in a garden, one or two trees were raised, which appear, from Prosper 
Alpinus, to have attained no remarkable size, nor perhaps to have flowered, if we may 
judge by the figure in that author, which in every particular, except the fruit, is erro- 
neous.
In the West Indian island of Martinico, a single tree of this kind, already full 
gi'o\vn, bearing flowers and fruit, is carefully preserved.
It was formerly sown there 
by the negroes.
These and similar remarks are detailed, with my authorities, in the 
communications to the Parisian Academy." 
In the above extracts allusion is made to the immense size of this 
tree, which has been spoken of as the largest (or rather the broadest) 
in the world, a title it well merits, as will be seen from the following 
description.* 
The Baobab has more the appearance of a forest than of a single 
tree.
It is an immense hemispherical mass of foliage, sixty or seventy 
feet high, and from a hundred and twenty to a hundred and fifty feet 
in diameter.
The main trunk is very short in proportion to its size, 
being only about ten or twelve feet high ; while it is at least twenty- 
five feet in diameter.
Golberry, in his Travels in Africa, mentions a 
Baobab the trunk of which measured upwards of thirty-four feet in 
diameter, and was about thirty feet high.
The branches are of con- 
siderable size, and fifty or sixty feet long ; the central branch rises 
perpendicularly, the others spread around it in all directions, the low- 
*The Norfolk-Island Pine (called kauri by the New Zealanders) occasionally 
grows to a large size.
Mr. Terry, in his lately-published work on New Zealand, men- 
tions an extraordinary individual which grows on the eastern coast, near Mercury Bay, 
which is the largest in New Zealand.
" It is called by the natives the Father of the 
Kauri.
Although almost incredible, it measures seventy-five feet in circumference at 
its base.
The height is unknown, for the surrounding forest is so thick, it is impossi- 
ble to ascertain it accurately.
There is an ann some distance up the tree, which mea- 
sures six feet in diameter at its junction with the parent trunk.'' It is evident 
that the particular tree here spoken of, far exceeds the average size of the species.

er ones being nearly horizontal for the greater part of their length, 
while the extremities frequently trail on the ground, from their own 
weight.
The roots are much longer than the branches.
The central 
root descends perpendicularly to a great depth ; the lateral ones ex- 
tend horizontally, and are sometimes but a short distance below the 
surface of the ground.
Adanson saw one of these roots, of which a 
great portion had been laid bare by the waters of a river ; the unco- 
vered part measured about one hundred and ten feet, and judging 
from its size he considered that forty or fifty feet might be still hidden.
437 
The bark of the trunk and older branches is about nine lines thick, 
of an ash-grey colour, smooth to the touch, and having a shining ap- 
pearance, as if varnished ; that on the younger branches is greenish 
and somewhat hairy.
The wood is soft, white, and extremely light, 
being very little heavier than cork.
In the Bombay Monthly Times 
are given the results of carboniz- 
ing seven different sorts of wood, 
including that of the Adansonia.
The weight per cent, of charcoal 
yielded by each is as follows.
â€” 
Adansonia, 33; lignum vitae, 26*4; 
mahogany, 25 ; oak, 22 ; beech, 
19; ash, 17; Scotch fir, 16 : so 
that the lightest wood presents the 
anomaly of yielding 6 6 per cent, 
of charcoal more than the heaviest.
The leaves are very similar in 
general appearance to those of the 
horse-chesnut, being somewhat 
orbicular in outline, and divided 
into several elliptical lobes, which 
are entire at the margin, and vary 
in number from three to seven.
They are alternate, and supported 
by a petiole, at the base of which 
are two small stipules; these are 
said by Adanson to fall off as soon 
as the leaves expand ; they are, 
however, represented in his figure.
The leaves of very young trees are 
undivided and nearly sessile ; the 
digitated leaves first make their 
appearance when the young plant 
is about a foot high.

sent the different forms of the leaves; the lobes of the fully developed 
leaves {i) are fi-om four to six inches long and two or three inches wide.
The flowers of the Baobab, as might be expected from the size of 
the tree, are very large.
The flower-bud (fig.
a ) is globose, and 
nearly three inches in diameter ; when fully expanded the flowers are 
usually about six inches in diameter.
There arc generally two or 
438 
three of these flowers on a branch, each being suspended by a pedun- 
cle which springs from the axil of one of the lower leaves, and bears 
a few scattered deciduous scales or bracts.
The peduncle is a foot 
long and four lines thick.
The handsome white flowers, like those of 
many allied plants, expand in the morning, about sun-rise, and close 
towards evening, thus aflbrding an example of what Linnaeus terms 
the sleep of plants.
Golberry observes that the negroes assemble 
round the Baobabs to watch the expansion of their flowers ; and that 
each flower, as it opens, is saluted with â€” " Good morning, beautiful 
lady !
" An expanded flower is shown at b.
Omitting Adanson's minute description of the calyx and other parts 
of the flower, I will pass on to the fruit (p.
437), which is fromtwelve 
to eighteen inches long and six inches in diameter, and is suspended 
by a peduncle two feet long and nearly an inch thick.
It is very hard 
and woody, and is covered with a greenish down.
When cut across 
the fruit is found to be divided into from ten to fourteen cells by 
membranous dissepiments.
The seeds are embedded in a spongy 
substance, which is whitish in fresh and healthy fruits, and of a red- 
dish hue in those which are badly formed or very old ; as it dries it 
becomes friable, and separates, either spontaneously or on receiving 
a very slight blow, into a number of irregular polyhedrons, each of 
which contains a single seed.
Adanson describes the structure of the seed and its mode of germi- 
nation, four different stages of which are figured.
The cotyledons 
are at first orbicular, then elliptical ; on the fourth day the first true 
leaf is developed ; at the end of a month the young tree is about a 
foot high, and at that time, as before stated, the digitated leaves ap- 
pear ; during the first summer the tree increases to about five feet in 
height, and is then about an inch or an inch and a half thick, whilst 
in France, under the most careful treatment, the author observes that 
within the latter period it attains no greater height than about twelve 
inches.
A specimen in the botanic garden at Calcutta is said to have 
attained a circumference of eighteen feet in twenty-six years.
The Baobab comes into leaf in June, flowers in July, matures its 
fruit in October and November, and in the latter month it loses its 
leaves.
It is very common both in the Island of Senegal and at the 
Cape de Verd, and along the sea-coast to Sierra Leone, and is even 
met with at Galam, which is more than a hundred leagues from the 
sea.
M. Golberry says that in the year 1786 he "saw the greatest 
number of Baobabs on the isthmus of the peninsula of Cape de Verd, 
between the bay of Jof and that of Dakar," a space of nearly two 
439 
square leagues, where there were at least sixty trees.
The roots pe- 
netrate rocky soils with great difficulty, and if ever so slightly injured 
they decay ; this decay is soon communicated to the trunk, where its 
progress is very rapid and the tree quickly perishes.
Hence it thrives 
best and is most abundant in wet shifting sands, such as those which 
extend from Senegal to Cape de Verd, a distance of thirty leagues ; 
while at Galam, where the soil is a hard stony clay, it occurs much 
less frequently and is comparatively small.
Besides a general rottenness or decay arising from injuries received 
by the root, this tree is occasionally subject to another disease, most 
probably produced by a fungus somewhat similar to that causing the 
dry rot, which spreads through the woody portion, and reduces it to 
the consistence of the pith, without either altering the colour of the 
wood or changing the disposition of its fibres.
The bark also remains 
uninjured, and there is notliing in the external appearance to indicate 
the operations of the insidious enemy within.
When thus affected the 
tree is frequently unable to resist the force of the wind ; Adanson met 
with one in an island near Senegal, the trunk of which had been bro- 
ken asunder in the middle during a gale.
The trunk, at the time he 
saw it, was inhabited by an immense number of very large Coleop- 
terous larvae.
The disease by which the tree was desti'oyed had most 
probably made considerable progress before the insects deposited 
their eggs in the tnmk ; at all events we know this to be the case with 
willows and other trees, which are seldom if ever attacked when in a 
souni and healthy state.
The rapid decay of a fine specimen of this tree, which grew at Co- 
labah ai Bombay, is doubtless to be attributed to the same disease.
â€” 
This tne â€” one of the finest in western India â€” was forty-four feet in 
circumference.
In May 1840, it was vigorous and apparently healthy ; 
a Uvr months after that time the large branches began to fall off and 
the javages of disease proceeded with great rapidity.
On examina- 
tion the decayed portions were found to be perforated in all direc- 
tions, like the one seen by Adanson, by the larvae of a beetle, which 
were i">ducing the whole to a powder resembling saw-dust.
Both the 
larva aid the perfect insect are figured in the Bombay Times.
The 
former i described as being two and a quarter inches long, and three 
inches in circumference at the thickest part.
Some idea of the rava- 
ges of thfcje larvae may be formed from the statement, that a piece of 
the tree thee feet long and eight inches in girth, apparently healthy 
and sound, vna found to be so thoroughly perforated that scarcely two 
inches of sold wood could be found entire.

We have heard such astounding statements respecting the longe- 
vity of this tree, that it would not be right to pass over the subject 
quite without notice.
In the Bombay Monthly Times before referred 
to, are some interesting notes furnished by the Rev. Dr.
Wilson, who 
remarks that â€” 
" This tree seems to he associated with ahsuvdity among the sages of the West as 
well as the East.
'The Baobal-tree of Senegal,' says Lyell in his 'Principles of Geo- 
logy,' ' is supposed to exceed almost any other in longevity; Adanson inferred that one 
which he measured, and found to he thirty feet in diameter, had attained the age of 
5160 years.
Having made an incision to a certain depth, he first counted tLree hun- 
dred rings of annual growth, and observed what thickness the tree had gained in that 
period.
The average rate of growth of younger trees, of the same species, was then 
ascertained, and the calculation made according to a supposed mean rate of increase.' 
Now, how does the matter stand, with regard to the specimens we have before xis in 
India ?
Dr. Koxburgh tells us that the tree is an exotic in this country â€” and he is 
quite correct.
It was introduced by the Portuguese from Mozambique within the last 
three hundred years ; and in many instances it has already attained to a growth ex- 
ceeding that specified by Adanson and Lyell.
Dr. Lindley has shown that what are 
called the annular [?
annual] rings, are not to be depended upon in calculations as to 
the age of trees ; and that with reference to this very extraordinary species." â€” Extracts 
from Notes of a visit to Dwaraka, by the Rev. Dr.
Wilson.
There is no doubt that the Baobab lives to a very great age, as may 
be inferred from its enormous bulk.
Adanson's observations on some 
trees which he met with in one of the Magdalen islands, led him to 
the conclusion that they were growing there at the time of the deluge, 
consequently that they were, at the time he saw them, upwards of Ave 
thousand years old !
On these trees were carved some European 
names, some of which were distinctly dated in the fifteenth and sixteenth 
centuries, others less distinctly bore date in the fourteenth.
Acanson 
thought it probable that the same trees were seen by Thevet when he 
passed these islands in 1555, on his voyage to the antarctic regions.
The letters of the names were six inches high, and the names them- 
selves occupied a length of about two feet, or somewhat less than the 
eighth part of the circumference of the trunk.
Reasoning from t)ese 
facts, and from his own observations of the rate of growth o the 
tree, Adanson arrived at the conclusion above stated, which i?
most 
probably an erroneous one.
The same trees were seen by Gaberry, 
thirty-six years after Adanson was on the island ; he says flat the 
words of the inscription were Dutch, and that one of the d'-tes was 
1449.
When I first read Adanson's account of the Magdalen-island Bao- 
babs, I could not help suspecting that their size was incorj^ctly given, 
a circumference of sixteen or eighteen feet appearing to /"ear no pro- 
441 
portion to the enormous age assigned to them.
But on turning to 
the narrative of his voyage, prefixed to the ' Natural History of Sene- 
gal,' p.
66) 1 find that the diameter of the trees is expressly stated to 
be six feet.
The author says that the names were deeply engraved in 
the bark, and that each person of the party, except himself, added his 
mark to those previously on the trees, but that he was satisfied with re- 
newing two of the names which were old enough to be worth the trouble, 
one of them being dated in the fifteenth the other in the sixteenth 
century.
Then follow the size of the letters, and a brief summary of 
the same arguments relating to the age of the trees which are after- 
wards given in detail in the Memoir published by the Academy.
But 
be it observed, that neither in the Narrative nor in the Memoir does 
Adanson say one word about his having made an incision in the trunk 
and counted the number of annular layers of wood, in order to deter- 
mine the age of the tree ; his arguments are founded solely on the ob- 
served annual rate of increase of young trees in height and diameter, 
and his data are given by Sir W.
J. Hooker, in the ' Botanical Maga- 
zine,' 2791-92, where the flower, fruit and leaf are beautifully figured.
The following remarks by a correspondent of the Bombay Monthly 
Times bear directly on the questions of the age of the tree and of its 
native country.
" I find you make no mention of the Adansonia digitata obtaining great perfec- 
tion in the ruins of Mandoo and its environs, of which I remember once to have des- 
canted in our evening conversations; indeed I believe these are the only localities in 
the upper parts of India, where the ' Khorassan Eemlee ' as it is there called, is to be 
found in great numbers and of enormous girth.
" From Nalcha to the Delhi gate of Mandoo, a distance of six miles along the Vin- 
dyah, the road on either side is lined with the ruins of palaces, mosques and tombs, 
mingled with innumerable groups of the Adansonia digitata, the same extending in a 
long avenue from thence to the Jumna Musjid in the centre of the city, from whence 
they diverge to the royal parks and gardens.
" The Mahometans fondly treasure this tree as a relic of Moslem sovereignty, be- 
lieving it to have been brought liy the northern conquerors to embellish their imperial 
residences in the east ; and moreover, that it languishes and dies in any Indian soil 
but that favoured as the abode of royalty.
Sooner therefore would they lose an arm 
than a branch from this boasted tree, although its insidious inroads have done more to 
complete the ruin of Mandoo, than either the hand of time or Rajpoot bigotry ; root- 
ing itself in every crevice of the walls and roofs, and uptearing with its giant arms 
enormous masses of masonry.
* * That the tree appears to be one 
to which the natives of India seem to attach much importance, is evident from both 
Hindoos and Mussulmen considering it in a sacred character : this probably proceeds 
from its prodigious size and comparative scarceness, as it is evident the Mahomedans 
have no claim to its importation from Khorassan, as I am credibly informed by travel- 
lers from thence there is scarcely a tree in that region attains a tithe of its size.' 
442 
Adaiison considers the Baobab to be indigenous nowhere but in 
those places on the western side of Africa which have been mention- 
ed above ; and states that the negroes, wherever they go, are in the 
habit of carrying with them the seeds of such plants as they make use 
of in cooking, or for other purposes.
He enumerates many of these 
plants, among which are the Baobab, two kinds of cotton, the tama- 
rind, several sorts of beans, the water-melon, &c., and observes that 
all these are now found in America, where they have every appear- 
ance of being indigenous, although many of them have not received 
American names.
In support of his opinion that the Baobab is a na- 
tive neither of the American continent nor of any of the West-India 
islands, he cites the works of Plumier, Sloane and Browne, in which it 
is not mentioned.
He also observes that M.
Thiebault de Chanvalon, 
an inhabitant of Martinique, speaks of a single tree growing on the 
island, as being the only one he had ever seen in that region.
This 
was a young tree at the time Adanson received his information from 
M. Thiebault, although it had then, for some years, borne flowers and 
fruit.
Dr. Roxburgh does not consider it to be indigenous in India, 
where he says it is scarce and of small size, observing that a few only 
have been found of any size at Allahabad, Masulipatam, on the coast 
of Coromandel, and in Ceylon.
After reading Adanson's remarks on 
the custom of the negroes in transporting the seeds of the Baobab, it 
is not difficult to account for its introduction into Asia, and other 
parts of the world where it is now met with.
As a genus Adansonia seems to be chiefly distinguished from Bom- 
bax (whose habit it has, and to which Linnseus and Cavanilles say it 
is too nearly allied) by its deciduous calyx, its numerous stamina and 
its smooth shining seeds, those of Bombax being downy or woolly.
â€” 
Among other and more obvious marks of agreement with other genera 
of the alliance Malvales, such as the extreme lightness of its wood, the 
large and handsome flowers, &c., may be mentioned that of the pollen 
grains being round and covered with minute points, as in our common 
Mallows.
From the position of the Baobab in the system, we should 
expect to find its properties similar to those of its natural allies the 
Malvaceae ; and the various uses made by the negroes of the different 
parts of the tree confirm this expectation.
The mucilaginous emol- 
lient quality common to the tribe, resides principally in the bark and 
leaves ; these are dried in the shade, in a fi'ee current of air, then re- 
duced to a powder of a beautiful green colour and nearly tasteless ; this 
powder is kept in a dry place in calico bags, and is called lalo.
The 
negroes make daily use of the lalo in their food, for the purpose of 
443 
keeping up an abundant perspiration and cooling the blood.
Adan- 
son and one of the French officers who accompanied him, made use of 
the lalo rather freely, and to it he attributes their preservation from 
the ardent fevers so prevalent in Senegal during September and Oc- 
tober.
The author particularly mentions the year 1751, the autumn of 
which year was more than usually unhealthy in Senegal, and states 
that himself and his friend were the only persons of the party who 
were able to follow their usual avocations, all the other officers being 
confined to their beds.
The fruit of the Baobab appears to be as use- 
ful as the leaves ; in a recent state its flesh is slightly acid and of an 
agreeable flavour, and its juice, mixed with sugar and water, forms a 
refreshing beverage in putrid and pestilential fevers.
The fleshy en- 
velope of the seeds, when dry, is I'educed to an impalpable powder ; 
P. Alpinus says it was sold in his time as a medicine, under the im- 
proper name of terra sigillata, or Lemnian earth.
Monkeys are said 
to feed on the seeds ; these are about the size of a bean, shining, and 
of a brownish colour, and are made into necklaces by the negroes.
The shell of the fruit, and even the fruit itself when spoiled for eating, 
is burned, and the ley obtained from the ashes, boiled with rancid 
palm oil, forms an excellent soap.
Our author concludes his account of the various uses made of the 
Baobab, with the following singular narrative.
It has been previously 
stated that the roots of such trees as grow in stony ground are liable 
to injury, and that in consequence their trunks decay and become 
hollow.
The negroes take advantage of the cavities thus formed, and 
shape them regularly into chambers, or rather vast caverns, wherein 
they deposit the bodies of those whom they deem unworthy to receive 
the ordinary rites of burial.
Of this class are persons called guiriots ; 
these are the poets, musicians and players, of both sexes, who are 
hired to preside over and assist at dances and other entertainments, to 
which they impart much life and spirit by their buff'ooneries.
The 
negroes regard these people, while living, with a kind of superstitious 
awe and reverence, but no sooner are they dead, than such feelings 
give place to horror and contempt ; the natives then neither allow 
their bodies to be buried in the earth nor cast into the waters, ima- 
gining that if thus disposed of, the fish in the latter would be destroy- 
ed, and that the former would produce no food.
By way of averting 
these evils the bodies of the guiriots are suspended within the hollow 
tmnks of the Baobab, the entrances to which are closed with planks, 
and there, without being embalmed, they quickly dry up and become 
converted into a kind of mummy.
444 
But it appears that the Baobab is not exclusively appropriated as a 
receptacle of the dead ; the one measured by Golberry was hollow, 
and used as their hall of assembly by the inhabitants of the A^alley 
of Dock-Gagnack.
The entrance was seventeen feet high, and faced 
a lake ; the height of the cavity itself was twenty feet and its diame- 
ter twenty-one.
The negroes had ornamented the sides of the door- 
way and the interior of the cavern with rude sculptures in relief The 
party pitched their tents by the side of this tree, and M.
Golberry was 
so well pleased with the chamber, that he ordered his bed to be pla- 
ced within it, intending to pass the night there.
This however caused 
so much dissatisfaction among the natives, that he abandoned his in- 
tention, although the chiefs would not have prevented him from car- 
rying it into effect.
He states that he had no occasion to repent his 
forbearance, having been afterwards treated with the greatest kindness 
by the natives.
In Dr. Wilson's notes above alluded to, it is mentioned that he 
visited one of these trees in India, which the Bairagees whom he 
found sitting in its shade told him was the only one in the world, and 
requested him to take off his shoes as he approached it, an honour 
which himself and party declined paying.
He was informed that 
several devotees nightly took up their quarters in the hollow trunk 
of this tree.
It is also stated that in South America the natives hollow out the 
trunk of the Baobab and use it as a habitation, and that the tree thus 
hollowed continues to grow and flourish so long as the sap-wood and 
bark remain.
The wild bees of Abyssinia are also reported to depo- 
sit their honey in this tree ; and that the honey stored therein is the 
best in the country.
Dr. Alex.
Gibson, in the Bombay ' Medical and Physical Transac- 
tions,' states that at Goozerat, where grow many fine specimens of the 
Baobab, the fishermen use the fruit as a float for their nets, and that 
logs of the very light wood ai'e also employed by them as a catamai'an 
or raft in fishing or duck-catching.
Adanson observes that in Senegal the Baobab has almost as many 
names as there are kingdoms.
The Oualofes call the tree Goni and 
its fruit Boui; the French call the tree calahassier, and the fruit mon- 
keys' bread, [pain de singe).
Prosper Alpinus, the first botanist who 
wrote of this tree, says that a fruit called Baohah was brought from 
Ethiopia to Grand Cairo ; from his description, and fi:om the notes of 
his commentator, Wesling, there is no doubt of this fruit being that of 
our tree, although, as Adanson observes, the fruits seen by Alpinus 
445 
must have been small and in a bad state, being probably such as are 
used at Senegal for no other purpose than making soap.
The author 
considers the figure given by Alpinus to have been drawn from ima- 
gination, but remarks that Clusius contented himself with represent- 
ing only what he saw.
Clusius says that he received the fruit under 
the names of ahavo and abavi, from persons who had it from English 
sailors returning from Ethiopia, or rather from the coast of Guinea or 
Senegal : he also says that the Portuguese call the fruit calehacera.
Scaliger gives a very short description of the fruit, brought from Mo- 
zambique under the name oi guanahimus.
After stating that all the 
above-named authors are cited in Bauhin's Pinax, Adanson observes 
that M.
Lippi's manuscript remarks ought not to be passed over in si- 
lence.
This learned traveller, who was the victim of a voyage into 
Abyssinia, undertaken by order of Louis XIV.
during a period of tu- 
mult and revolution in that country, gives a much more accurate de- 
scription of the fruit of the Baobab, which he saw at Cairo, whither 
it had been brought from Upper Egypt, than any author who had 
preceded him.
After a wai-m eulogium on M.
Lippi, Adanson con- 
cludes his admirable memoir by stating that it is evident, from the 
passages quoted, that the authors cited were acquainted only with the 
fruit and leaves of the Baobab, but that they had no knowledge of its 
flowers or of the tree which bore them, the monstrous size of which 
presents a fact the most remarkable which the history of Botany and 
perhaps that of the world can furnish.

â€” Note on the Sands of Barry, and on Equisetum 
variegatum.
By Mr. J.
B. Brichan.
I HAD lately an opportunity of examining the locality named above, 
and as Equisetum variegatum there assumes a somewhat different ap- 
pearance from that which it presents on Deeside, the few remarks I 
have to offer will forai an appropriate sequel to my paper on the three 
allied Equiseta, (Phytol.
369).
Whether or not the spot in which I 
found the plant is the same in which it was found by Don, I am un- 
able to say ; having no guide and no information, I rather stumbled 
upon it than searched it out, and though I went over a considerable 
446 
space, I detected it only in one spot.
As the locality is in various re- 
spects interesting, I may be pardoned for occupying a few sentences 
in particularly describing it.
A considerable part of the parish of Barry, containing from six to 
ten square miles, is a low sandy flat, which, at some remote period, 
undoubtedly lay under the sea, and is still very little elevated above 
its level.
The links and sands, which compose the southern portion 
of this flat, are diversified by numerous sand-hills and knolls, which 
increase in size towards the south-east, and there terminate in a large 
sandy ridge, probably about 100 feet above the level of the sea.
The 
smaller ones are covered with grasses, mosses, Carices &c., especially 
with Ammophila arenaria [Scottice bent), which covers also the larger 
hills and part of the higher ridge already mentioned.
Towards that 
ridge the sand-hills are rather crowded, but to the westward they de- 
crease both in size and in number, rising however in some cases to a 
height of 20 or 30 feet.
Of these the highest and most conspicuous 
hill, or group, lies close to the sea, about one mile west of the light- 
houses, and immediately south of a large plain or meadow, where a few 
tall poles mark the locality of an old race-course.
It is on all sides 
clothed with Ammophila, but is hollow and broken in the middle.
A 
cart-road runs through the hollow, in the middle of which, and on 
each side of the road grows Equisetum variegatum.
The spot is, on 
an average, not more than ten feet above the sea.
The whole district of which Barry forms a part, rests upon the Old 
Red Sandstone, which, according to Mr. Miller's intensely interest- 
ing work bearing the same name, derives its prevailing colour from an 
admixture of iron.
I know not whether it is to be attributed to the 
same cause that much of the sand of the district is tinged with red ; 
but in the work just alluded to I find the following.
â€” " The oxide 
deposited by the chalybeate springs which pass through the lower 
members of the formation, would give to white sand a tinge exactly 
resembling the tint borne by this upper member." And it is certain 
that when a cut of several feet is made in almost any part of the plain of 
Barry, the chalybeate water immediately appears, and that its peculiar 
scum is seen floating along the edges of a small stream which bounds 
the parish on the west, and into which various chalybeate springs dis- 
charge their waters.
The general appearance of the surface where 
E. variegatum grows is perhaps against the supposition that the sand 
has any mixture of iron ; but when the sand is dug, it is found to be 
of a dingy brown, and the lowest stratum of the sand-hills is streaked 
with sand of a still deeper hue.
Those facts appear to confirm the 
447 
remarks I lately offered on the three allied species or varieties, â€” E.
hyemale, Mackaii and variegatum ; there is, however, this difference 
between the two localities that I have examined, that the prevailing- 
rocks on Deeside are granite, and, if I mistake not, gTanitic gneiss.
The situation of E.
variegatum at Bany seems to overthrow my con- 
jecture that " the banks and bed of rivers " are its natural habitat : 
there is scarcely an imaginable way in which a stream could have de- 
posited it in the spot which it now occupies.
The roots of the Barry plant scarcely differ from those of the Dee- 
side variety.
The stems are of the same variable length and number 
of articulations, with 4 â€” 10 striae : they are completely prostrate, ex- 
cept in a few instances, when supported by Ammophila arenaria.
When not sheltered by that or any other plant, they are brownish on 
the upper or exposed side and green on the under ; it is, however, 
possible that the brown colour may be the effect of the lateness of the 
season.
On the upper side also the bands of black upon the sheaths 
run farther down the stem than they do on the under side.
The teeth 
are wedge-shaped, not ovate as at Banchory : the bristles are longer 
and apparently more persistent.
The catkins are in general more 
cxserted and matured, and, as well as the stems, have sometimes a 
reddish tinge.
The plant seems to branch in the same manner as in 
the higher and moist situation on Deeside, 150 feet above the sea.
When the sand is compacted by small plants which afford no shelter 
to the Equisetum, the latter is generally very small, slender and fili- 
form ; where the sand is loose or the plant has shelter, its growth is 
much stronger, and in the sheltered situation it is greener.
In no 
case does the plant attain the same size as on Deeside.
Some speci- 
mens slightly resemble E.
Mackaii, but are perfectly distinct ; the 
resemblance arises from the bristles being longer, and the amount of 
black upon the sheaths greater than in the usual state of the plant.
The links and sands of Barry form a very interesting botanical sta- 
tion.
I have no doubt that a summer ramble among these hills and 
hollows would amply repay the researches of the botanical visitor ; 
for although my visit took place at the end of October and the begin- 
ning of November, when they were in a state of decay, I could detect, 
among others, the following plants:â€” Astragalus hypoglottis, Elymus 
arenarius, Juncus balticus, and, I think, Erigeron acris.
Juncus bal- 
ticus is especially plentiful, being found in almost every part of the 
extensive links, and forming large plats in the meadows and hollows 
between the sand-hills.
In this and similar places the intelligent 
observer cannot fail to be struck with the peculiar adaptation of the 
448 
prevailing vegetable productions to the character of the soil in which 
they grow.
To my mind it furnishes a striking instance, not only of 
the " Wisdom of God in Creation," but of the wisdom of God in pro- 
vidence also.
In a district of almost pure sand, while the more inland 
and level part is covered with common vegetation and vegetable mould, 
the seaward portion has been gradually overgrown with Ammophila 
arenaria, Carex arenaria, Elymus arenarius, and several other plants, 
all so well fitted by their creeping roots to bind the sand and prevent 
it from shifting.
Even Equisetum variegatum, though confined to a 
small space, has its creeping root, and is calculated to serve the same 
end.
And thus, in the first instance, an arid waste of sand, either up- 
heaved from the bottom of the sea or exposed by the gradual retiring 
of its waters, and in that state utterly destitute of vegetation, has, by 
the agency of a powerful wind, been partly accumulated into a natu- 
ral bulwark against the return of the ocean ; and then, while its plains 
have by degrees been covered with a mould which has converted them 
into land capable of cultivation, its still sandy heaps which compose 
that bulwark have become consolidated, even to the verge of the 
sea, by a dense covering of plants, the most prominent and important 
of which are found only in such localities.

â€” County Lists of the British Ferns and their Allies.
Compiled by Edward Newman.
I DO not wish to conceal the fact that the perusal of Mr. Watson's 
admirable paper on the ' Geographical distribution of British Ferns,' 
has been the means of inducing me to attempt a still more rigid in- 
vestigation of the produce of our counties, so far as regards this beauti- 
ful family of plants.
In prosecuting this design, I find myself at the 
very threshold compelled to abandon my original intention of restrict- 
ing each county list to the observations of an individual botanist : 
the kind and prompt attention with which my wish, expressed in 'The 
Phytologist,' has been met, enables me to make these lists far more 
interesting, by combining under each county the observations of ma- 
ny botanists.
In employing the nomenclature formerly proposed by 
myself, and subsequently adopted in the valuable Catalogue publish- 
ed by the Botanical Society of Edinburgh, I conform to the usage of 
the majority of my correspondents.
The authorities are arranged as 
149 
nearly as possible in accordance with the dates of the letters contain- 
ing the information quoted.
It appears, from carefully collating all the authorities within my 
reach, that the recorded species of British ferns are forty-six in num- 
ber : of these one is now considered a doubtful native ; twelve (printed 
in italics) are ranked by some authors as varieties ; and thirty-three 
(printed in Roman letters) are acknowledged by every writer.
By ad- 
hering to these numbers the relative proportions of each county will 
remain uninfluenced by the different views of botanists on this most 
interesting but debatable point.
Species whose present existence 
in the county has not been verified by any of my correspondents, are 
marked with a dagger, f

f Woodsia Ilvensis.
Richmond (J.
Wood), Francis' 'Analysis of British Ferns.' 
Cj'stopteris fragilis.
Uncommon in the neighbourhood of Sheffield, J.
Hardy ,- 
Shibden and Beeston woods near Halifax, Settle, Knaresborough, and many other 
places in the county.
The genus Cystopteris is said to affect limestone, but I always 
find the varieties growing much larger, and their forms better displayed, where there 
is no limestone.
Mr. Francis lays great stress on the length of the rachis as a charac- 
ter whereby to distinguish the species ; if he had been a fern-collector he would have 
known that this character depends very much on the situation in which the plant hap- 
pens to grow, if, for instance, among loose stones, the rachis will be long, if on a mor- 
tared wall, short.
The same author also remarks that C.
dentata is only half the size 
of C.
fragilis, and double the size of C.
alpina : my specimens of the form called fra- 
gilis vary from 2 to 18 inches in length, of that called dentata from 4 to 16 inches, 
and of the Low Layton plant from 1 to 8 inches ; S.

Cystopteris angustata.
Scarce in three places, Gordale and Attermine scars and 
Catterick-force, J.

Spruce: near Aysgarth-bridge, Wensley-dale, Baines's Yorkshire 
Flora.
Cystopteris alpina ovregia.
Near Fountain's-abbey, and on wet rocks about Knares-

Belbank-wood near Bingley, the place mentioned in Ray's Synopsis (Mr.
Teesdale, in his Supplement to 'Plantse Eboracenses,' published in the 'Trans- 
actions of the Linnean Society of London) ; Trichomanes brevisetum was cer- 
tainly found near Bingley by Bolton, I have seen a specimen from that place, 
S. Gibson ; it was figured in ' English Botany,' pi.

elsewhere.
Symphytum officinale, var.

Near Muttonhole, &c.
SPECIES PREVIOUSLY OBSERVED.
Geranium rotundifolimn.
Very fine at Preston-pans.
Geuni intermedium.
Abundant in many places, as at Roslin, Haw- 
thomden, &c.
Is this a species or not ?
Hahenaria chlorantha, Bab. After observing this plant very at- 
tentively for some time, and comparing it with the allowed H.
bifolia, 
and with specimens from the Edinburgh Botanical Society, from Mr.
Babington, and other eminent botanists, of their H.
chlorantha, I 
must say that I cannot see permanent grounds of specific distinction.
The extreme forms appear very unlike, but the interaiediate ones are 
so very common, that it appears to me there are scarcely sufficient 
reasons for separating the plants.
I should much like to see in ' The 
Phytologist' a record of the observations of some botanist familiar 
with the plants in a living state.
Hieraciiim sahaudum.
One of the most common Edinburgh 
hawk weeds.
456 
Hordeum pratense.
Not now to be found in the district; some 
fine specimens occurred to Dr. Neill in the King's Park many years 
since.
Junciis ohtusiflorus.
Pentland Hills.
A curious viviparous variety 
of J.
supinus (J.
uliginosus), with half-prostrate stems from a foot to 
two and a half feet long, occurs with the preceding in the marshes 
near Collinton.
Lamium Galeohdolon and rugosum.
Dalkeith Park.
L. album, 
Linn., L.
maculatum, Linn., and L.
rugosum, Ait., appear to be cor- 
rectly referred by some authors to states of the same species.
Leontodon palustre.
Very abundant on the Pentland Hills and 
elsewhere near Edinburgh.
From several years' observation of this 
plant in Shetland and elsevrhere, I am inclined to think it is a good 
species, although now generally sunk into a variety of L.
Taraxacum.
The characters drawn from the involucre appear to be constant in all 
the specimens I have seen; and it is by no means improbable that 
small specimens of L.
Taraxacum have been confounded with palus- 
tre, for I have seen them growing together, and each preserving its 
distinctive characters.
Leontodon autumnale.
Specimens of a curious variety of this plant 
having a very stout scape, and covered with a very dense, long, and 
silky pubescence, occur near Collinton.
It is exactly similar to some 
specimens brought from the Outer Hebrides by Dr. Balfour and Mr.
Babington last year, and exhibited at the Botanical Society.
Polygala vulgaris.
I have observed some curious variations in the 
size of the leaves and sepals, and in the habit, of some Polygalas on 
Arthur's Seat, Braid, Blackford and Corstorphine hills, &c., and Mr.
E. Forbes has registered the same.
Whether these differences may 
prove sufficiently constant to constitute species, I must leave to fu- 
ture observers.
Potamogeton.
Great numbers of this intricate genus are to be met 
with around Edinburgh, and, I have little doubt, forms (or species) dif- 
ferent from those described, but I confess myself perfectly unable to 
distinguish many of the puzzling fonns ; and I do think that minute 
differences in the shape of the fruit are not always to be depended on.

On the poisonous effects of the Seeds of Hemlock.
In Lindley's ' Introduction 
to the Natural System,' 2nd ed.
p. 22, it is stated tbat " the fruit of the Unibellifera' 
is in no case dangerous." In the 'Pharmaceutical Journal' of this month, p.
337, Dr.
Pereira mentions the case of a gentleman who suffered severely from having drank an 
infusion of anise, in which some seeds of Conium maculatura were detected.
From 
the expressions used by the Dr. I presume that they were not numerous.
It appears 
to me veiy desirable that the point should be set at rest.
Dr. Maton is quoted by Pa- 
ris in his Pharmacologia, as stating that the value of Extractum Conii is much in- 
creased by including the seeds in the preparation.
If any confidence is to be placed 
in the case detailed by Dr. Pereira, which is taken by him from the ' Journal de Chi- 
mie Medicale' for August, 1842, it would appear that an infusion of the seeds is infi- 
nitely more powerful than tlie extract usually procured in commerce, since Dr. John 
Davy has admistered the latter in drachm doses daily, with scarcely any untoward 
symptoms.

On the folia accessoria of Hypnum filiciriiim, Lin. A short time ago, whilst 
walking along the banks of one of our rivers, I haj'pened to take up a tuft of that state 
of Hypnum filicinum which has been called H.
fallax by Bridel, and on scrutinizing 
it with my pocket-lens, was surprised to observe, scattered here and there on the stem, 
several minute leaflets, scarcely one tenth so large as the true leaves, but yet resem- 
bling them in appearance.
I brought the tuft home with me, and took an early op- 
portunity of examining it with the microscope.
I found these " folia accessoria '' to 
occur chiefly towards the summit of the main stem, and more sparingly on the princi- 
pal branches.
In shape they are lanceolate, denticulate at the margins (a), nerveless 
(so far as I have observed), more delicate and with a wider reticulation than the true 
leaves.
Sometimes they stand singly, as in figures b, c, d ; not unfrequently several 
are found near each other, when they are smaller than usual ; but most generally they 
stand in pairs, one leaflet partially overlying the other (c/).
I observe them to be si- 
460 
tuated indifferently near tlie base or in the axil of a leaf, so that they cannot be consi- 
dered stipules ; but their most usual position is midway letween two consecutive leaves.
Accessory leaves of Hypnum jilicinum.
a â€” c.
Accessory leaves standing singly.
d. Accessory leaf and radicles, e, f.
Accessory leaves occurring 
in pairs.
g Leaf of a branch bud.
All the figures are magnified.
My first impression was that they were branch-buds ; but the true branch-buds, which 
exist copiously on elongations of the stems, are first displayed as little biilbs bursting 
forth from the stem, and are composed of closely packed and very minute leaves, of 
the shape represented at fig.
g. Afterwards, remarking that the folia accessoria were 
confined to the upper part of the stem, while the lower part was profusely clothed with 
radicles.
I thought it barely possible that the former might pass into the latter ; but 
after a very careful scrutiny I detected several instances of the two organs occurring 
intermixed, and each preserving its characters unaltered ; thus, the radicles, in their 
most rudimentary state, were jointed cylinders of a deep brownish-purple hue ; while 
the accompanying folia accessoria were pale green, cellular, foliaceous expansions : an 
instance of their conjunction is figured at d.
I may add that the folia accessoria are 
more abundant on the upper, the radicles on the under part of the stem.
These pecu- 
liar appendages I believe have been hitherto unnoticed, although they certainly exist 
in every state of Hypnum filicinum with which I am acquainted ; it is, however, sin- 
gular that they should be absent from the very nearly allied species H.
commutatum, 
at least my specimens do not show them.
It is by no means improbable that other 
species of Hypnum may possess folia accessoria, which, from their minuteness, have 
been overlooked by previous observers ; and perhaps this brief account of what I have 
myself notited, may induce some of your correspondents, who have a love for musco- 
461 
logy, to iiKikc more extensive ohseivatioiis with a view of ascertaining tlic fact.

Information on Byssus barbata, Eng. Bot.
Your correspondent Mr. Lees re- 
quests information respecting Ozoniura auricomum (Pliytol.
428), tbe Byssus barbata 
of Withering and early English authors.
This production was first denominated Ozo- 
nium auricomum by Link in ' Berlin Magazin,' and this generic title was confirmed 
by Persoon in the ' Mycologia Europaa.' It is not introduced in the second part of 
vol.
V. of English Flora,' because Fries, Berkeley, and all the best mycologists of the 
present day, consider it best to exclude this and other doubtful productions from the 
catalogue of Fungi.
The fructification of Ozoniura is quite unknown, and this singu- 
lar plant is believed to be an abnormal and barren state of some other Fungus, proba- 
bly a Thelephora.
I have sometimes fancied it bore some resemblance to Tlielephora 
hirsula, but this plant only grows on rotten wood and stumps of trees, whilst Ozoniura 
auricomum is occasionally found on damp walls.
The figure in Withering of its sup- 
posed fructification represents nothing possible.
Although I fully concur in the pro- 
priety of excluding this plant, with the Rhizomorpha; and sirailar puzzling articles, 
frora the body of mycological works, they are too interesting to be passed over without 
notice, and raight, I think, be described in an Appendix, especially as most young fun- 
gists are disappointed by finding no mention made of them.
Mr. Lees will find an 
admirable figure of Ozoniura auricorauni in Greville's 'Scottish Cryptogamic Flora,' 
iv.
tab.
260 ; the description by Dr. G.
contains all that is known concerning its struc- 
ture, with the synonymy from the time of Dillenius upwards.

On the narrow-leaved Hypericum perforatum.
The narrow-leaved variety of 
Hypericum perforatum noticed in 'The Phytologist' for this month, (Phytol.
427), 
has been long known to me as a native of this island, where it is far from uncommon 
in similar situations with the ordinary form of the species, into which it passes by in- 
sensible gradations.
Indeed the broad-leaved and normal state of H.
perforatum is 
decidedly uncommon with us, though such a plant does occasionally occur, and makes 
a certain approach to H.
dubium of Smith, in having but few pellucid dots upon the 
leaves, and one or more of the sepals is elliptical, oblong and obtuse, while the re- 
mainder preserve their usual acuteness of termination, I have never gathered the 
real dubium in fiovver, but I possess dried specimens in that state from others, and I 
found at Mucruss in October last what I take to be the genuine plant of ' English 
Botany ' cS^c, but quite out of bloom, having all the sepals elliptical-oblong, rounded 
at the tip, and somewhat recurved ; in habit the Irish plant was more like H.
quad- 
rangulum than H.
perforatum, so sirailar indeed that I did not readily distinguish the 
two as they grew together, until more closely examined.
My kind and liberal friend.
Dr. Wood of i\Ian(.lic^Â«pr, has pointed out to rae since then the strongly raarked pel- 
lucid reticulations of the leaves in H.
dubium, when viewed by transmitted light, as 
affording an excellent character, in addition to those previously laid down for distin- 
* Since writing the above, I have received a communication from Dr. Taylor (in 
answer to a letter enclosing Hypnum filicinura with folia aecessoria), wherein he ob- 
serves â€” " the name filicinum seems to have been applied almost prophetically to this 
species, which alone possesses these cauline scales that remind one of the ferns ; they 
probably perform the same functions as the leaves, and yet they appear to be univer- 
sally without nerves." â€” R.

guishing this rather obscure or ill understood species from the common H.
perforatum.
I collected seeds of the Killamey dubium for the purpose of testing its immutability 
under cultivation.
The breadth of the leaves in our narrow forms of H.
perforatum, 
varies extremely, as I before observed, being sometimes quite linear, more frequently 
however linear-oblong or linear-elliptical, with deflexed margins ; in height, erect ha- 
bit, and corymbose inflorescence, this variety agrees exactly with that described by Mr.
Westcott.
Besides being the H.
veronense of Schrank, our variety seems to be the H.
stenophyllum of Opitz, Winn, et Grab.

Curious state of Carex panicea.
I have lately received a curious variety of 
Carex panicea, which T do not find noticed in any work on British plants.
It differs 
from the common state of the plant in having double perigi/nia, the second or upper 
ones with their peduncle passing through the orifice of the first or lower ones ; the 
lower perigynia also have the usual number of stigmas.
As such forms are not com- 
mon amongst the Carices, perhaps it may be interesting to some of the readers of 'The 
Phytologist ' to know that they do occasionally occur.
The plant was found at Bris- 
tol, in June, 1842, by Miss Wood, Liverpool-road, Islington, to whom I am indebted 
for the specimen.

Hierochloe borealis, (Phytol.
426).
In August, 1836, I went with a party of 
botanists to seek for this plant in Glen Cally, which is within three or four hours' walk 
from the Spittle of Glen Shee.
Unfortunately we set out in the afternoon, and did 
not reach tbe place until the day was far spent ; so tbat before we had penetrated the 
recesses of the Glen, the evening shadows warned us to depart.
The fatigues and the 
dangers of our return by a shorter but untried route across the mountains, and our de- 
scent long after sunset, will not soon be forgotten.
Had time permitted, I have no 
reason to thiuk that we should have been unsuccessful in our search for this plant.

Supposed neiv British Fern.
On recently comparing the specimens of Adian- 
tum Capillus-Veneris, gathered by Mr. Ward at Ilfracombe in Devonshire, in 1840, 
with one from the Isles of Arran, given to me when Ireland, by Mr. Keilly of Galway, 
I found a marked difference in the general character and habit of the two plants; and 
on closer inspection I discovered in the footstalks of the leaves a difference which ap- 
peared perfectly constant, so far as the specimens before me are concerned.
In the 
Arran specimen each pinnule is articulated to a somewhat capitate footstalk, from 
which it may be separated by a very slight touch : in this character as well as in the 
form of the pinnules, it appears identical with a common West Indian species which 
I suppose to be the Adiantum fragile of Willdenow's ' Species Plantarum.' My ob- 
ject in publishing this supposed discovery in its present crude form, is to invite those 
botanists who happen to possess specimens from both localities, to compare them, 
with a view of establishing or disproving my conjecture.

â€” Prof.
Christison in the chair.
The election of office- 
bearers for the season took place : â€” Dr. Neill, President ; Professors Christison, Gra- 
ham, Balfour and D.
Stewart Esq., Vice-presidents.
Various parcels of plants were 
announced, also donations to the library from Dr. Miiller of Emmerich, Dr. Maly, &e.
Professor Christison then submitted to the Society a highly interesting communi- 
cation on the Assam tea-plant, illustrated by specimens.
The author stated that the 
diflFerent kinds of tea were produced by different modes of preparation, and showed by 
a series of examples of the preserved tea-leaf, that the various forms were merely vari- 
eties of the same plant.
A specimen of tea, of a yellow colour, and of a remarkably 
strong flavour, was exhibited ; also tea, in the form of small rolls, sent to this country 
about twenty years ago, as a present from the Emperor of China to George IV.
Mr. Goodsir then read a paper by Charles C.
Babington, Esq., F.L.S., F.GS., en- 
titled "Observations upon a few plants, respecting the claim of which to be considered 
as natives of Great Britain, Sir W.
J. Hooker expresses doubt in the 5th edition of 
his ' British Flora,' with a few notes upon other species contained in that work, with 
reference to the Edinburgh ' Catalogue of British Plants.' The object of this paper 
was to show upon what evidence the authors (Professor Balfour, Mr. Babington him- 
self, and Dr. Campbell) of the Botanical Society's ' Catalogue of British Plants ' had 
included in it the species concerning which Sir W.
J. Hooker expresses doubt.
" I 
cannot allow this opportunity to pass," says the author of this paper, "without express- 
ing the great satisfaction which it gives me to see that so distinguished a botanist as 
Hooker has considered the catalogue deserving of quotation throughout his work, as I 
must consider it a proof that the compilers of the ' Catalogue of British Plants ' have 
not produced a work discreditable either to themselves or to the Society that intrusted 
its preparation to them" 
Mr. Brand afterwards read to the Society a " Notice of the presence of Iodine iu 
some plants growing near the sea," by G.
Dickie, M.D., Lecturer on Botany in the 
University and King's College, Aberdeen.
The author found, by chemical examina- 
tion of specimens of Statice Armeria, from the sea-shore, and of others from the inland 
and higher districts of Aberdeenshire â€” that the former contained iodine, and that soda 
was more abundant in them, while potass prevailed iu the latter.
Iodine was also 
found in Grimmia maritima, and Mr. P.
Grant of Aberdeen, has found it in Pyre- 
thrum maritimum.
An analysis was made of examples of Statice Artneria, Grimmia 
maritima, Lichina confinis and Ramalina scopulorittn, all growing near the same spot, 
and occasionally during storms exposed to the sea spray ; and all these plants, with 
the exception of the lichen, contained iodine.
The specimens having been washed 
previous to analysis, the iodine could not have been derived from saline incrustation.
All these vegetables were healthy, and the author of the paper has been led to conclude 
that marine Algae are not the only plants which possess the power of separating from 
sea-water the compounds of iodine, and of condensing them in their tissues, and this 
without any detriment to their healthy functions.

â€” Adam Gerard Esq. in the chair.
Donations of British plants were 
announced from Miss S.
B. Hawes and Miss S.
K. Barnard.
The continuation of 
the paper commenced at the last meeting, on the Lodoicea Sechellartim, by George 
Clark, Esq., was read.
464 
The Lodoicea Secliellarum is an intertropical plant peculiar to the Sechelles Ar- 
chipelago, where it grows naturally in two islands only, Praslin and Curiense.
Pras- 
lin lies to the north-east of Mahe, distant twenty-one miles ; Curiense to the north of 
Praslin, and is much smaller : a deep arm of the sea, from one to two miles in breadth, 
separates these two islands.
They lie between 4Â° 15' and 4" 21' S.
latitude, and 55" 
39' and 55" 47' E.
longitude.
In the other islands of the Archipelago there are but 
few Lodoiceas, which have all been planted, and only two or three appear to thrive.
The trunk or stem is straight, and rises to the height of 80 or 90 feet, and is ter- 
minated by a splendid crown of winged palmated leaves ; it is only from 12 to 15 
inches in diameter, and so flexible that it waves to the slightest breeze.
When the 
wind is moderately strong, the huge leaves of this giant palm are clashed together 
with an astonishing noise.
The outside of the stem is very hard and compact, while 
the interior is soft and fibrous.
The leaves, winged and palmated, open like a fan, and 
in their early growth are more than 15 feet long, without reckoning the foot-stalk, 
which is at least as much more.
In the mature trees the leaf-stalk is not more than 
8 or 10 feet long, and the whole leaf does not exceed 20 feet in length by 10 or 12 in 
breadth, and is entirely destitute of thorns.
The nascent leaves are enveloped till the 
period of their expansion by a thick covering of cottony down, of a nankeen colour ; 
but tl)is is occasionally wanting.
The unanimous testimony of the inhabitants of 
Praslin proves that each tree produces only one leaf a-year ; and " as three leaves occu- 
py about 8 inches of the trunk, and twenty years expire before that appears above the 
surface, a tree of eighty feet in height must be about four hundred years old." The 
flowers, about twenty in number, succeed each other one at a time, occasionally there 
are two together.
The nuts are two-lobed, and sometimes two nuts are enclosed in one 
husk ; three-lobed nuts are very rare, but some are met with, and it is said that speci- 
mens with five lobes have been found.
The form of the nut is very singular, and can- 
not be compared with that of any other production of the vegetable kingdom.
Two 
highly remarkable circumstances in the history of the Lodoicea are the duration of its 
blossoms and the period necessary for maturing its fruits ; for the latter purpose seven 
or eight years are required.
The Lodoicea grows in every variety of soil, but delights 
most in the vegetable mould of the deep gorges of the mountains.
It is nevertheless 
found on the bare mountain tops, and forms a very conspicuous and remarkable object 
in such situations.
It is curious that the vegetation of the nut should be prevented by 
its being buried, but if suffered simply to rest on the earth, in a situation not too much 
exposed to the sun, germination readily takes place.
The purposes to which the pro- 
duce of the Lodoicea is applied are numerous.
The fruit, in its simple state, is an 
agreeable and refreshing aliment ; when ripe it yields oil ; its genn furnishes a very 
sweet food.
Of the shell are made vessels of various shapes and sizes, that serve the 
Sechellois for nearly all domestic purposes.
The entire nut is an article of commerce 
with India, v/here o.ie of its uses is as an astringent medicine.
The trunk is employ- 
ed in building ; split and hollowed it forms excellent gutters and paling ; the leaf- 
stalks also are used for the latter purpose.
The leaf forms a covering for roofs nearly 
as good as shingles, besides furnishing materials of a very superior description for hats, 
bonnets, wood-baskets and artificial flowers, in the manufacture of which many of the 
Sechelloises display great taste and skill.
And lastly, the cottony down which covers 
the leaf previously to expansion, is a very good stufiiug for pillows and mattresses.

â€” Note on Fucus Mackaii of Turner 
By Robert Kaye Greville, Esq., LL.D.
Fucus Mackaii, Turner.
Fucus Mackaii, a species established in the absence of fructifica- 
tion by the acute Turner, is reduced by Agardh to a mere variety of 
F. nodosus ; and, it must be confessed, not without apparently good 
reason.
The plant occurs in its different localities in extraordinary 
profusion, and strongly resembles .some states of F.
nodosus, so closely 
2S 
466 
indeed as scarcely to be distinguished from them.
In the autumn 
of the present year I collected specimens of the latter plant, in Loch 
Ryan, which I thought conclasively established Agardh's view of the 
question.
A few days afterwards, however, I was most agreeably sur- 
prised to observe in the collection of Mrs. Captain Maynard, at Stran- 
raer, a specimen of Fucus Mackaii bearing receptacles ; so that the 
doubts which have so long hung over this interesting plant, are now 
at an end.
The specimen (I regret to say it was a solitary one) was communi- 
cated to Mrs. Maynard by Dr. Lindsay from the Isle of Skye.
The specific character of Fucus Mackaii may now be expressed 
as follows.
Frond coriaceous, cylindrical or subcompressed, linear, 
irregularly dichotomous : vesicles (when present) innate, elliptical, 
solitary; receptacles in pairs, ovate-oblong, terminating the lateral 
branches.
The annexed figure, copied from the drawing which I made at the 
time, of this unique specimen, will render any further description 
unnecessary.

â€” Note on a supposed New British Cuscuta; by Charles 
C. Babington, Esq., M.A., F.L.S., F.G.S. Communicated, 
with Additional Observations, by G.
S. Gibson, Esq.* 
I FULLY intended to forward C.
C. Babington's notes on the 
Cuscuta (Phytol.
412), but have delayed doing so in the hope of 
obtaining clearer information as to the countiy from which the clo- 
ver-seed came ; but after considerable enquiry have not succeeded 
satisfactorily.
The following are C.
C. B.'s remarks upon it, any part 
of which you are of course at liberty to insert in ' The Phytologist.' 
" I this morning received your letter, and immediately submitted 
the Cuscuta to the microscope.
It certainly differs considerably from 
C. Epithymum, and I suspect will prove to be a new species, for 1 
can find no notice of it in the continental works, I am not, however, 
prepared to give it as new, without more acquaintance with it than 
I have yet obtained.
I beheve that C.
Epithymum is confined to 
shrubby plants, such as Ulex, Erica and Thymus.
I add the cha-

Newman.
407 
racter of the plant, according to my present ideas, and have under- 
lined the points in which I believe it to differ from C.
Epithymum.* 
The provisional name that I have adopted is C.
Trifolii.
" C.
Trifolii, (Bab. MSS.) Clusters of flowers bracteated, sessile : 
tube of the corolla cylindrical, limb erect, scales palmately cut, con- 
verging ; calyx nearly or quite as long as the corolla.
Calyx and 
corolla whitish, with acute segments.
" 1 had heard of a Cuscuta destroying the clover in Norfolk and 
Suffolk, but have never before been able to obtain specimens.
I look 
upon it as very desirable that attention should be called to the plant, 
as it threatens to become a troublesome weed in fields, to which it 
has probably been introduced with clover-seed from the continent.
â€” 
Could you ascertain if it was known on clover before recent years, 
and if the clover-seed was of English growth, or from what country 
obtained } I think that this queiy may, if it produce a decided an- 
swer, be of much agricultural value." 
All the particulars which 1 have been able to ascertain, are the fol- 
lowing.
The clover- seed was bought by the farmer of a factor at Stortford, 
who distinctly states that it was foreign seed, but cannot tell from 
what part it came.
The same farmer states that he noticed this Cus- 
cuta on clover in one of his fields about twelve years ago, but has not 
since observed it till this year.
In the adjoining part of Suffolk, it 
was a troublesome weed in several places, covering the clover to a 
considerable extent, and greatly injuring the crop; this seed had 
been grown in England the previous year, and in this neighbourhood, 
but probably might have originally come from abroad, which I am 
anxious to ascertain, but fear the requisite information can scarcely 
now be obtained.
Perhaps if the notice of the readers of ' The Phy- 
tologist' be called to the subject, some more satisfactory result may 
be arrived at.
Should I hear any further particulars I intend to com- 
municate them.

Gibson.
Saff"ron Walden, 3rd of 1st Month, 1843.
[Mr. Babington requests us to add that he would be much obliged to any person 
who would send for examination specimens of Cuscuta from clover, addressed to him 
at St. John's College, Cambridge.]

â€” Contributions toivards a Flora of the Breadalhane 
Mountains.
By Wm. Gardiner, jun., Esq.
The plants enumerated in the following list were collected between 
the 28 th of June and the 19th of July, 1842, on that wild and rugged 
mountain range which extends along the shores of Loch Tay from 
Kenmore to Killin, and of which the mighty mass of Ben Lawers 
forms the most prominent feature, rising to an altitude of 4015 feet 
above the sea-level.
At the base of this mountain a little inn has 
been most conveniently placed, from which to the summit the dis- 
tance is reckoned about five miles, and is usually attained with less 
than three hours' moderate climbing.
Once at the top, the toil is 
amply compensated, if the mist be absent, by the magnificent pano- 
rama of the " land of the mountain and the flood " that is spread 
around.
There are many fine sights in Breadalbane : the splendid 
waterfalls at Aberfeldy, Acharn, Boreland and Lawers ; â€” 
" Th' outstretching lake, imbosom'd 'mong the hills : " 
the romantic grounds of Tay mouth : â€” 
" The Tay meandering sweet in infant pride, 
The palace rising on his verdant side ; " â€” 
the quiet pastoral beauty of Glen Lochy, and the never-tiring pictu- 
resque scenery of Killin.
But all these taken together fall short of 
producing such an interest as one feels while enjoying, in a clear sun- 
ny day, the vast prospect of alpine grandeur from the summit of Ben 
Lawers ; and the tourist who neglects this sight, although he has be- 
held the rest, misses what is most worthy of being seen.
To the bo- 
tanist Ben Lawers has additional charms.
He seldom climbs it in 
the prescribed period of three hours, for almost at every step, beauty, 
in some form or other, beckons him to stoop and examine its charms.
His pleasure is not on the summit alone, and therefore to him the as- 
cent is not so toilsome.
He walks, as it were, through a botanic gar- 
den, each compartment, as he ascends its lofty terraces, presenting 
him with a fresh banquet of new and lovely forms, unknown to the 
plains, and as he takes leisure to enjoy them, the health-giving breez- 
es circle round him.
The mountain-bee with its merry hum leads 
him to many a hidden gem ; and the babbling streams ever and anon 
are telling him of the floral treasures of their banks.
He is diligent 
as the bee, happy as the sparkling stream.
Yet no earthly happiness 
is without its alloy ; and rambling On Ben LaAvcrs, whether the tour- 
ist be botanist or not, he vt'ill meet with shady moments as well as 
469 
Ijiight ones.
If the sun beats strong and the air is dry, his lace gets 
tanned and his ears blistered.
If the mist comes on, and he has no 
compass nor guide, he runs the risk of losing himself, and descending 
the wrong side of the mountain.
If he is overtaken by a Highland 
showei-, he is positively certain of being thoroughly drenched to the 
skin ; and if he has lacked the foresight to provide a spare suit to ex- 
change for his wet one on reaching his inn, his plight will be pitiful.
Moreover, he will occasionally have the comfort of getting over the 
ancles in a bog, of being stung by an angry wasp, or of having his 
blood painfully abstracted in various ways by tiny demons in the 
shape of insects.
Yet after all, these are but trifles when we look 
them lightly in the face, and consider what a vast amount of pure 
delight is derivable from the contemplation of Nature, either in her 
minute details of vegetable and animal structure, or in her more general 
features of landscape scenery.
Thalictrum alpinum.
Plentiful on Ben Lawers and the other mountains in the Bvead- 
albane range, growing on the marshy banks of rills, as well as on wet rocks.
minus, j3.
majus.
On the hanks of Loch Tay.
Anemone neinorosa and Trollius europaus.
These two beautiful denizens of onv woods, 
the one with its delicately-tinted drooping flowers, and the other with its swelling 
globes of vegetable gold, adorned the wild and lofty rocks of Stuich-an-Lochan, 
and were greeted with all the rekindled warmth of early friendship.
Stuich-an- 
Lochan is a wild rocky mountain, rising almost perpendicularly from the dark 
waters of Loch-na-Gat, and connected with Ben Lawers, of which it is generally 
considered a part, by the yet more fearful clitTs of Craig-na-Hein.
It is one of 
the richest botanical fields in Breadalbane.
Coc/dearia r/rcenLmdica.
Plentiful about the summit of Ben Lawers, varying much in 
size, and in the colouring of the flowers and foliage.
Draha rtipcstris.

Sluich-an-Lochan could also boast of this graceful little gem of 
Flora, which recalled one from the sultry heat of July, and these perilous alpine 
rocks, to the soft luxury of the woodland in the merry mouth of May.

Chamcemorus, Abundant on the peat-bogs and moory ground of Ben Lawers, 
both in flower and fruit.
The latter, which are called Avrons by the shepherds, 
are esteemed for their nutritious properties as well as for their agreeable flavour, 
I had good reason to prefer the name of cloud-berries, for my specimens were 
culled amid the fleecy drapery of the heavens that mantled the mountain in 
their misty folds.
Potentilla alpestris.
Not uncommon on the rocky ledges of Stuich-an-Lochan.
Sibbaldia procumbens.
On the summits of all the mountains.
Alchimilla alpina.
Plentiful everywhere, from the bases to the summits of the moun-

from the crevices of a rock in the immediate vicinity of one of those beautiful 
miniature cascades that are so numerous on an alpine rivulet.
Epilobium angustifolium.
Margin of the Lochy, near Killin, imparting to the banks 
of that still and beautiful stream a peculiarly interesting aspect of floral gran- 
deur, from the richness of its numerous handsome spikes of crimson blossoms.

Lochan, Mael Tarmauach, Mael Greadha, and Craigalleach, growng in the 
clefts of rocks.
Some of it had simple stems, others branched ; and more of it 
was in fruit than flower.

I gathered it in 1838, in the crevices of rocks and among debris, in a wild ra- 
vine near the summit of Ben Lawers, but it is now getting so scarce there, that 
unless picked with a sparing hand for some years to come, it will be in danger 
of being eradicated.

In profusion in marshy places about springs and the 
sides of streams.
saxatilis.
On the rocks of Stuich-an-Lochan and Craig-na-Hein, but in

of my specimens were culled on the summit of Craigalleach, in the calm twi- 
light of a summer's evening, after a day's laborious ramble over the whole range 
from Larich-an-Lochan.
On the same spot (upwards of 3000 feet high) I last 
year had the misfortune to sprain my right ancle severely ; and what I then suf- 
fered in the descent, and for two months after, would have cured many a one of 
botanizing for ever : but somehow or other, it only tended to increase my enthu- 
siasm, and this prompted me in the present season to revisit that glorious moun- 
tain-altar, and there offer up to heaven grateful thanks for my recovery, and for 
the pure pleasure I continued to enjoy from the love of Nature's works.

AUosorus crispus.
Cliviger, in endless variety.
Mr. Francis says that the sori 
are placed in lines along the transverse veins : I find them in dots at the termination 
of the veins, with the edge of the pinnule more or less turned over, forming a cover, 
sometimes however they are quite bare, and when in that state the plant might be con- 
sidered a true Polypodiuxn.
Mr. Newman has observed that the character which dis- 
tinguishes this plant from a true Polypodium, is that the fronds are both barren and 
fertile ; but I find, that in common with all other Polypodia, it possesses not only bar- 
ren and fertile fronds, but barren and fertile pinnse on the same frond, and even bar- 
ren and fertile pinnulee on the same pinna, S.

Mr. Francis has incor- 
rectly given my name as an authority for this species being found near Lancaster; and 
in Mr. Watson's ' Notes on the Geographical Distribution of British Ferns,' this spe- 
cies is said to affect lime rocks, but the Lancashire localities are on the gravel which 
overlies the coal-formation, and it therefore cannot be said to be a limestone plant, Â»S'.

in only one locality in this neighbourhood (Broughton, Manchester), in an old alder- 
swamp at Lever's Ilulme; it is intermixed with its more common ally, and when thus

Asplenium marinum.
In 1828 I found this species sparingly on a stone by the 
side of the river, about two miles from Liverpool on the way to Runcorn, <S'.
Gibson : 
a variety still grows in Winwick Stone Delf, where it never attains any considerable 
size ; when fully devclo])e(l by cultivation in a greenhouse, the pinnules are much 
shorter and rounder than those of maritime plants under the same treatment.
I have 
not seen this species at Knot's Hole near Liverpool, but it is plentiful there according 
to Mr. T.
B. Hall, see ' Flora of Liverpool ; ' W.
Wilson : it is still in existence in 
479 
Winwiuk slonc-<iuany, near Warrinytcn ; my friend Mr. Wilson brouglit me two small 
roots from that locality a short time since, for cultivation ; it is never more than two 
or three inches high, and the pinnules arc singularly cuneatc and strongly crcnatc on 
their edges, very much resembling the Killarney plant (figured Newman's ' British 
Ferns,' 7()j; it produces seed in abundance; J.

The subject of this paper is nearly allied to our own Saussurea and 
Carlina, from the former of which genera it seems to differ chiefly in 
" the rays of its feathery pappus being disposed in two rows, and co- 
hering by twos or threes at the base." It grows in great abundance 
on the damp open slopes of the mountains surrounding the valley of 
Cashmeer, at an elevation of from 8000 to 9000 feet above the sea-le- 
vel, flowering in June and maturing its fruit in October.
The plant 
has but a slender medical reputation among the native Cashmeerians, 
since it is chiefly employed by them to protect bales of shawls from 
the attacks of moths, its odour being very pungent, and well calcula- 
ted to effect this ; portions of the stem are also suspended from the 
necks of children, in order to protect them from the evil eye, and to 
expel worms.
The author observes that he has " frequently been asked, when in 
Cashmeer, where and for what purpose the immense quantities of the 
root, annually collected, could find a market." We give a brief sum- 
mary of the commercial history of the plant, extracted from the details 
given in the paper.
The roots are dug up in September and October j 
they are chopped into pieces from two to six inches long, and in this 
state are exported in vast quantities to the Punjab, whence the larger 
portion goes down to Bombay, where it is shipped for the Red Sea, 
the Persian Gulf and China ; a portion finds its way into Hindoostan 
485 
Proper, whence it is taken to Calcutta, and is there bought up for the 
China market under the name of Pntchuk.
One object of the author in this paper is to show that the root of 
Aucklandia is identical with the Costus of Dioscorides ; and into the 
discussion of this question he enters pretty fully.
The following are 
the proofs adduced in support of this opinion.
1 .
The correspondence 
of the root of Aucklandia with the descriptions of ancient authors.
2. 
The coincidence of names, this root being called Koot in Cashmeer, 
the Arabic Koost being given as synonymous.
3. At the present day 
the Chinese burn the root as an incense in their temples, and make 
use of it medicinally ; the Costus was employed in the same way by 
the ancients.
4. The testimony of Persian authors that the Koost is 
not produced in Arabia, but is from the " borders of India." 5.
The 
commercial history of ihe Cashmeerian root.
The author in conclusion makes some remarks on the probability 
that the Aucklandia, if cultivated, " would form a valuable addition 
to the wealth of the Hill people." He states that in consequence of 
the lively demand for the root in Cashmeer, there is seldom any sur- 
plus stock in hand ; and the plant being a perennial, and requiring 
several years to mature its root, it is not likely the valley would yield 
any considerable increase on the quantity now collected, without ul- 
timately reducing that quantity.
The plant is named by the author Aucklandia Costus, the generic 
name being given in honour of George Earl Auckland ; it was met 
with during a journey to Cashmeer, undertaken under his Lordship's 
auspices while Governor-general of India.
Full characters and a de- 
tailed description are given.

â€” Description of a new Genus of Lineae.
By Charles C.
Babing- 
TON, Esq., M.A., F.L.S., F.G.S.
Read January )9, 1841.
The seeds of this interesting addition to the small order to which 
it belongs, were collected in the interior of New South Wales by Mr.
Melluish, who sent them to the Cambridge Botanic Garden, where 
at the time the paper was written the plants raised from the seeds had 
flowered during three successive years.
The name given by the author is Cliococca tenuifolia ; the generic 
name refers to the indehiscent nature of the single-seeded carpels, in 
which respect, and in an apparent tendency to the imperfect gynoba- 
sic structure of the Malvaceae, the relationship between that family 
and the Lineae is more fully evinced.
The petals are imbricated in 
486 
aestivation, and are not iinguiculate; the coats of the carpels are also 
very thick, and the carpels themselves are perfectly closed, not even 
opening when they separate for the dissemination of the seed : in all 
which particulars the plant differs from the usual structure of Lineae.
The paper contains full generic and specific characters, and is il- 
lustrated by a plate of details drawn by Mr. J.
D, Sowerby.
V. â€” On an edible Fungus from Tierra del Fuego, and an allied Chilian 
Species.
By the Rev. M.
J. Berkeley, M.Jl., F.L.S.
Read March 16, 1841.
Mr. Darwin gives an account in his Researches of a production 
common on a species of beech in Tierra del Fuego, which is used by 
the natives as an article of food.
The author's belief that these bo- 
dies were referrible to the Fungi, was confirmed by an inspection of 
the specimens preserved by Mr. Darwin, and by the perusal of that 
gentleman's original notes.
With the aid of these materials he 
has been able to establish a new genus (which he has named Cyttaria), 
containing two well-defined species.
The following extracts from Mr, Darwin's rough memoranda relate 
to the first species â€” C- Darwinii.
" In the beech forests the trees are much diseased ; on the rough excrescences 
grow vast numbers of yellow balls.
They are of the colour of the yolk of an egg, and 
vary in size from that of a bullet to that of a small apple ; in shape they are globular, 
but a little produced towards the point of attachment.
They grow both on the bran- 
ches and stems in groups.
When young they contain much fluid and are tasteless, 
but in their older and altered state they form a very essential article of food for the 
Fuegiau.
The boys collect them, and they are eaten uncooked with the fish.
When 
we were in Good Success Bay in December, they were then young ; in this state they 
are externally quite smooth, turgid, and of a bright colour, with no internal cavity.
The external surface was marked with white spaces, as of a membrane covering a cell.
Upon keeping one in a drawer, my attention was called, after some interval, by find- 
ing it become nearly dry, the whole surface honeycombed by regular cells, with the 
decided smell of a Fungus, and with a slightly sweet mucous taste.
In this state I 
have found them during January and February (1833) over the whole country.
Upon 
dividing one, the centre is found partly hollow and filled with brown fibrous matter ; 
this evidently merely acts as a support to the elastic semitransparent ligamentous sub- 
stance which forms the base and sides of the external cells.
Some of these balls re- 
main on the trees nearly the whole year ; Captain Fitzroy has seen them in June." â€” p.
38.
Mr. Darwin found the same species at Port Famine in February, 
1 834 ; and again, under the date of June of the same year, he de- 
scribes the appearance in an older state.
He found them to be much 
infested with larvae.
487 
The second species â€” C.
Beileroi â€” is a native of Chile, and is 
found upon Fagus obliqua.
It appears to have been first described 
by Bertero, in a posthumous list of Fungi published in a journal call- 
ed * Mercurio Chileno,' a translation of which by Ruschenberger was 
given in Silliman's Journal, xxiii.
78.
The following is Bertero's 
account.
" Fagus obliqua, Mirb., Roble, oak, a tree common in the high mountains.
In the 
spring is formed on the hranches of this tree a great number of whitish tubercles, the 
parenchyma of which is spongy, though sufficiently consistent at first.
I thought it a 
galla or exci'escence, produced by the wound of some insect, as is seen on some other 
trees in Europe, and I gave the matter but little attention ; but two days afterwards 
they became unglued from the branch, and I observed with surprise that the skin was 
broken, and the whole surface covered with pentagonal tubes precisely similar to the 
alveoli of a honeycomb, at first full of a gelatinous substance of the colour of milk, 
which disappeared with the maturation ; afterwards throwing out from these cavities 
with some force an impalpable powder, when it was touched, exactly as is observed in 
the Peziza vesiculosa.
At the end of two days these bodies softened, lost their expul- 
sive property, and rotted.
It perhaps forms a new genus, approximating to the Sphse- 
riag.
Its vulgar name is Dignenes.
Some persons eat them, but their insipid and 
styptic taste is disagreeable." â€” p, 39.
The following extract from Mr. Darwin's notes also refers to this 
species.
" Sept.
1834.
On the hills near Nancagua and San Fernando, there are large 
woods of Roble, or the Chilian oak.
I found on it a yellow fungus, very closely re- 
sembling tbe edible ones of the beech of Tierra del Fuego.
Speaking from memory, 
the difference consists in these being paler coloured, but the inside of the cups of a 
darker orange.
The greatest difference is, however, in the more irregular shape, in 
place of being spherical : they are also much larger.
Many are three times as large 
as the largest of my Fuegian specimens.
The footstalk appears longer; this is neces- 
sary from the roughness of the bark of the trees on which they grow.
In the young 
state there is an internal cavity.
They are occasionally eaten by the poor people.
I 
observe that these are not infested with larvae, like those of Tierra del Fuego." â€” Id.

description in English ; and the illustrative plate is filled with anato- 
mical details from his own drawings.

â€” Oh a reformed Character of the Genus Cryptolepis, Brown.
By 
Hugh Falconer, M.D., Superindendent of the Hon. East India 
Company s Botanic Garden at Saharunpore.
Communicated by J.
F. 
RoYLE, M.D., F.R.S., F.L.S., &c.
Read June 16th, 1841.
The genus Cryptolepis was established by Mr. Brown, who, in his 
Monogra])h published in the * Memoirs of the Wernerian Society,' re- 
4S8 
fcvs llic gomis to the A])ocynea3, placing it next to Apocynum : in this 
he has been followed all subsequent authors.
But Dr. Falconer finds, 
on examination of specimens of Cryptolepis Buchanani, that it " has 
the whole of the accessory stigmatic apparatus of Asclepiadea3, with 
granular pollen as typically developed as in Cryptostegia or any other 
of the Periploca), although in a less considerable degree of evolution; 
and that it must rank in that order along with them." 
The author considers that the appendiculse of the stigma, from their 
extreme minuteness must have eluded Mr. Brown's notice ; two other 
points of difference lead the author to conclude that the plant exa- 
mined by himself must have been different from Mr. Brown's.
In 
the first place he does not find the five hypogynous scales mentioned 
in the generic definition ; the same scales are wanting, so far as he 
has ascertained, in all the Periploceous genera allied to Cryptolepis, 
including even Decalepis of Wight and Arnott.
Secondly, the spe- 
cies examined by the author has axillary instead of interpetiolar co- 
rymbs, an important character in the habit.
Many particulars relating to the reproductive organs are given, to- 
gether with an amended generic character.
The drawings for the 
illustrative plate were made by Kureem Buksh, a native artist.
IX.
â€” On the existence of Spiral Cells in the Seeds of Acanthaceae.
By 
Mr. Richard Kippist, Libr.L.S. Communicated by the Secretary.
Read March 17th, 1840.
Botanists have long been aware of the existence of spiral vessels 
in the envelopes of the seeds of several families of plants.
Mr. Brown 
detected them first in the pericarps of Casuarinae, afterwards in the 
testa of some Orchideae.
They were observed by Lessing in Compo- 
sitae, by Horkel and Schleiden in Labiatse, Polemoniaceas and Hydro- 
charidese ; and in the ' Botanical Register' is given an account of their 
a[)pearance in the seeds of Collomia.
We believe that the merit of 
detecting these cells in the seeds of Acanthaceae is due to Mr. Kip- 
pist, who has in this paper given an interesting detail of his researches.
The following is the author's account of his discovery.
" My attention was first directed to this subject by witnessing the very beautiful 
appearance under the microscope of an Acanthaceous seed, forming part of a collec- 
tion brought by Mr. Holroyd from Upper Egypt, and presented by him to Professor 
Don. It is of a lenticular form, covered, especially towards the margin, with whitish 
hairs, which are closely appressed to the surface, and glued together at their extremi- 
ties, so as rather to resemble corrugations of the testa than distinct hairs ; on being 
}'laccd in water, however, they are set at liberty, and, expanding on all sides, are seen 
489 
to consist of fascicles of long, cylindrical, transparent tubes, firmly cohering for about 
one third of their length, and presenting all the characters of spiral vessels.
These 
fascicles usually contain from five to twenty tubes ; each tube inclosing one, two, or 
occasionally even three, spiral fibres, which adhere closely to the membrane.
The fi- 
bre may be sometimes seen to divide into two in the upper part of a tube, the branches 
usually continuing distinct ; sometimes, however, after making a few turns, they again 
coalesce.
Towards the free extremity of the tube the fibre is frequently broken up in- 
to a number of distinct rings; and in other cases the spire again becomes continuous, 
after having been interrupted by two or three such rings.
In those portions of the 
tubes which adhere together, the fibre is completely reticulated ; towards tlie extremi- 
ty, the coils, though quite contiguous, are usually distinct, and readily separate by the 
expansion of the tube ; in the intermediate parts they adhere more firmly together, be- 
ing connected by slender ramifications of the main fibre.
The expansion of the hairs 
in water is accompanied by a copious discharge of mucilage, which makes its escape 
by distending and finally rupturing laterally the spiral tubes in which it is contained.
" The testa, which is distinctly visible in the spaces between the hairs, consists of 
nearly regular hexagonal cells, each containing an opake mass of grumous matter, 
which, not filling the entire cavity, leaves a wide transparent border.
Cells similar to 
these, but more elongated and gradually passing into the form of tubes, immediately 
surround the base of each hair, which appears to be filled up by a conical mass formed 
of the transparent tubular portions." â€” p.
(55.
Mr. Kippist was induced, by the peculiar appearance of these seeds, 
to examine those of other genera of the same natural family, with the 
view of ascertaining to what extent the tendency to develope spiral 
hairs might prevail, and whether that peculiarity might assist in cha- 
racterizing genera.
He finds that the presence of these cells is not 
universal in the Acanthaceae, but has met with many examples, with 
"a considerable diversity in the structure and arrangement of the hairs 
which clothe the seeds." He describes the hairs of the seeds of a 
great number of species of Acanthaceaj, which appear to vary greatly 
in form and structure.
We regret that our limits prevent us from se- 
lecting examples.
The beautiful illustrations are from the author's 
own drawings.
X. Description of a new genus of Plants from Brazil.
By J .Mieks, Esq. F.L.S 
Read March 2, 1841.
This is a minute dioecious plant found by Mr. Miers in the Organ 
mountains, Brazil, in February, 1838.
Its texture is quite transpa- 
rent, and the structure of its flowers very singular.
Its position in the 
system is not accurately determined, but the author is disposed to 
place it near the Juncagineae ; in habit it resembles some Orchideae.
It is named by the author Triuris hyalina â€” the generic name referring 
to the three elongated processes of the perianth.

Note on Agaricus aimatochelis and A.
deliciosus.
I Lave found in a wood near 
here a considerable quantity of Agaricus aimatochelis, which, when Berkeley's book 
was published, was not known as a native of England.
My specimens had the red 
ring complete.
Notwithstanding M.
Roque's caution both I and my friends have eat- 
en Agaricus deliciosus, and with impunity.
It was broiled with pepper, salt and but- 
ter, and really was delicious.
T have taken a moderate-sized one at a meal.

Note on Alaria esculenta.
In 1837 Mrs. Griffiths called my attention to the 
Alaria esculenta, and wished me to observe whether a new " frond was pushed out be- 
tween the stem and the old one, as in Laminaria digitata and L saccharina." In con- 
sequence I attentively watched the plant during the three succeeding autumns, and as 
the result of my observations is interesting, and will serve to correct an eiTor in Mr, 
Harvey's ' Manual of British Algae,' v/here the Alaria is said to be annual, the follow- 
ing remarks may not be unacceptable to the readers of ' The Phytologist.' In spring 
the rocks in many parts of Mount's Bay are covered with the young fronds of the Ala- 
ria : the greater number of these are destroyed in the course of the summer ; those 
more favourably situated remain, and throw out, near the top of the stipes, a few hori- 
zontal leaflets.
In the autumn, between these and the base of the frond, the stipes 
becomes elongated, bearing a new frond, which, as in Laminaria, at first has the old 
one attached to its summit.
Numerous leaflets are thrown out from a line on each 
side of the new portion of the stem, and the old leaflets fall off".
There is a small in- 
terval between the insertions of the old and new leaflets ; and although the marks of 
the former become nearly obliterated, yet by a careful examination they may still be 
detected, and the age of the plant ascertained.
The stipes is therefore elongated when- 
ever a new frond is formed, and this is more than once repeated, as I have frequently 
observed specimens which have had three sets of the horizontal leaflets.

New locality for Grateloupia filicina.
I avail myself of this opportunity to 
notice a Welch habitat for the rare Grateloupia filicina, which Mr. Harvey, in his 
' Manual of British Algae,' mentions as having been found (in this country) only on 
the shores of Devonshire and Cornwall.
In September last I had the pleasure of find- 
ing it, rather plentifully, in shallow pools on the rocks in front of the Castle Hill at 
Abery stwith .

Note on the poisonous effects of Conia.
Your correspondent Mr. Sparkes, from 
his remarks on the poisonous effects of the seeds (or rather fruit) of hemlock (Phytol.
459) does not appear to be acquainted with Dr. Christison's experiments on the sub- 
ject.
There can be no doubt of the poisonous nature of the fruit; Dr. C.
found that 
it yielded a much larger quantity of the poisonous alkaloid â€” conia â€” than the leaves of 
the plant did.
Conia, you are aware, is one of the most deadly poisons ; a single drop 
put into the eye of a rabbit, killed it in nine minutes ; three drops used in the same 
way, killed a strong cat in a minute and a half; five drops poured into the throat of a 
small dog, began to act in thirty seconds, and in as many more, motion and respiration 
had entirely ceased.
Conia, when injected into a vein, killed a dog instantaiieously .
Tlic poison has a local irritant clfect, and destroys life by causing palsy of the muscles 
491 
of respiration, heing in tliis respect the counterpart of strychnia, which kills by caus- 
ing tonic contraction of the muscles of respiration.
In both cases asphyxia is produ- 
ced, but from different causes.
The green fruit yields conia in large quantity.
A full 
detail of Dr. Christison's experiments is given in the ' Transactions of the Royal So- 
ciety of Edinburgh, vol.
xiii.
As to Lindley's remark, that the fruit of the Umbelli- 
ferae is in no case dangerous, there surely must be some mistake.
So far as I recollect 
he states, that while the leaves of the Umbelliferce are always suspicious, the fruit is 
often aromatic.
This remark holds good generally, but there are several important 
exceptions.
Conia is easily decomposed by heat, and hence extracts of hemlock are of- 
ten inactive.
The dried leaves also, according to Geiger, contain no alkaloid.
These 
facts will account for the variable effects produced liy preparations of hemlock.
â€” J.H.
Balfour ; II, West Regent St., Glasgow, January 4, 1843.
[ The following is the passage referred to.
â€” " The properties of this order require 
to be considered under two points of view : firstly, those of the vegetation ; and, se- 
condly, those of the fructification.
The character of the former is, generally speaking, 
suspicious, and often poisonous in a high degree ; as in the case of Hemlock, Fool's 
Parsley, and others, which are deadly poisons.

22.
Dr. Lindley also states, after Fee, that the properties of Conium maculatum are 
greatly affected by climate; it being inert and eatable in Russia and the Crimea, al- 
though it is extremely dangerous in the south of Europe.
It is also stated that for 
medicinal purposes hemlock should be collected in June, soon after flowering, its ener- 
gy being much impaired if gathered later.

Note on Hierochloe borealis, (Phytol.
426 and 462).
I may mention with re- 
gard to this beautiful and interesting grass, that I possess one or two very good spe- 
cimens, which I purchased along with a few others, forming part of an old herbarium 
bearing the date of 1805, but unfortunately I could not ascertain the name of the for- 
mer possessor.
The handwriting is in an old style, and the following is a copy of the 
label: â€” " Holcus odoratus.
Calla-glen, Angus-shire mountains; rarissime!" No 
date.
Possibly these may have belonged to Mr. G.
Don, but not being acquainted 
with his handwriting, 1 cannot conjecture as to the fact.
The word " mountains" 
would seem to show that " Kelly-glen '' near Arbroath could not be the spot intended.
I may remark that in ray herbarium there are specimens of Potentilla tridentata and 
opaca, collected by Mr. G.
Don. â€” Thos.

On the Hygrometric Qualities of the Setce of Mosses.
I do not think it has 
been generally noticed that many mosses possess fully as much of this quality as Fu- 
naria hygrometvica.
Dicranum cerviculatum, varium, falcatum and strumiferum â€¢ 
Orthotrichum crispum ; Bryum turbinatum, capillare, julaceum and Zierii ; Tricho- 
stomum polyphyllum, Tortula fallax and enervis, many Hypna, Sec, I have observed 
to have this peculiarity to so great an extent, as to render it difficult to glue them to 
the paper on which they are preserved.
Mosses which were dried under heavy pres- 
sure are comparatively destitute of this property.
Thus Funaria hygrometrica, when 
the plants are picked and dried separately, has far less than when they had been pressed 
in tufts, and consequently the setae little injured l)y it.

Note on the mildness of the weather.
As an illustration of the mildness of the 
late season, the following notice of plants, which T gathered on the Derbyshire hills 
492 
beyond JMulirani, on the 2iid of January of the present year, may prove interesting to 
some of the readers of ' Tlie Phytologist.' Vacciniura Vitis-Idaea, both in flower and 
fruit, being the second time of its blossoms appearing within the last four months.
â€” 
Empetrum nigrum, several specimens of which still bore the berries of last year ; I did 
not see many with the flowers fully expanded, but if the weather had continued mild 
they would have been in full bloom in a week or two.
Besides these I noticed in full 
flower about a dozen of the hardy spring weeds, â€” Stellaria media, Lamium purpure- 
um, &c., and the following mosses were gathered in fructification.
Grimmia pulvinata Polytrichum piliferum Hypnum ruscifolium 
Gymnostomum truncatulum Dicranum taxifolium Bryum pyriforme 
Tortula muralis heteromallum argenteura 
Funaria hygrometrica Trichostomum lanuginosum horuum 
Polytrichum undulatum Hypnum plumosum punctatum

Note on Onoclea sensihilis.
Perhaps it will be interesting to some of the read- 
ers of ' The Phytologist ' to know that Onoclea sensihilis grows in an old stone-quarry 
near Warrington.
This fern was found in the above locality about four years ago by 
John Roby, Esq., of Rochdale ; the plant is plentiful and grows very luxuriantly.
It 
was also found in the north of Yorkshire a short time ago, by Mr. Baines of York.

Note on the Poisonous Properties of the Fruit of Conium maculatum.
Profes- 
sor T;in(lley is not the only botanist who has forgotten the qualities of the fruit of Co- 
nium ma(!ulatum, when speaking of the properties of the UmbelliferEe, for I find Dr.
Willshire makes the same mistake.
In his ' Principles of Botany,' he observes of the 
Urabelliferse, that " the fruit is innocuous ; often stimulating from the essential oil it 
contains." It is well known that the leaves of Conium maculatum possess a poison- 
ous quality, which depends on the presence of a peculiar and highly poisonous princi- 
ple, called Conia.
This principle is found in greater abundance in the seeds than in 
the leaves, therefore we might presume them to be more poisonous ; yet I know of no 
case on record of poisoning by the seeds, although many unpleasant effects have been 
produced when small quantities have been administered.
Professor Christison, in 
making experiments upon animals, administered about thirty grains of an extract pre- 
pared from the full-grown seeds ; it caused paralysis, convulsions and death, and this 
proves the fruit of Conium maculatum to possess very active and even poisonous pro- 
perties.
Indeed we should always be cautious how we employ the seeds of a poison- 
ous plant, for although in some, as Papaver somnifevum, they may be harmless, yet in 
others they possess all the active properties of the plant itself, as in the above exam- 
ple, to which I may also add Colchicum autumnale.

Correction of an error respecting the discovery of Statice tatarica near Ports- 
mouth.
I regret having been the means, though inadvertently, of communicating an 
error to your pages, in stating Statice tatarica to have been discovered by myself near 
this place, (Phytol.
429).
Having had some correspondence with Mr. Borrer on the 
subject, by whom I have been kindly furnished with specimens of the genuine S.
ta- 
tarica from a foreign locality, and of S.
Limonium, var.
y. (Smith), from Bosham, at 
the mouth of the Chichester river, I find that my plant is identical with the latter.
â€” 
Its chief difl'erence from the real S.
tatarica consists in the absence of the winged stem, 
which forms a remarkable featiuc in that species.
The very different appearance, 
493 
liowever, of my plant, I'roni tlie normal form of S.
Limonium, will I think admit of a 
reasonable doubt whether it is not a species distinct from that.

BOTANICAL SOCIETY OF EDINBURGH- 
Thursday, Januai-y 12, 1843.
â€” Dr. Douglas Maclagan in the chair.
James Irving, 
Esq. was elected a resident fellow, and Baron Ludwig, â€” Arden Esq. and Wm. Cald- 
well Faure, Esq., Cape of Good Hope, non-resident fellows of the Society.
Mr. Goodsir then read two papers by John Ralfs, Esq., Penzance, on the Diato- 
maceoB.
In these able papers the author described numerous species, and made some 
important observations on the structure and habits of these microscopic plants.
Spe- 
cimens were exhibited, and displayed under the microscope.
Mr. Brand read a description of two new species of British mosses, by Dr. Taylor, 
Duukerron.
The next paper was entitled " Description of a new species of Carex, found near 
Hebden Bridge, Yorkshire." By C.
C. Babington, Esq., M.A., F.L.S., &c., St. John's 
College, Cambridge.
The author staled that it was now nearly two years since Mr.
S. Gibson, of Hebden Bridge, had forwarded to him a Carex which he believed would 
prove to be a new species.
He was now satisfied that is so, and has dedicated it to 
its discoverer (under the name of Carex Gihsoni), than whom no person can be more 
deserving of commemoration by means of a plant of this genus, to the careful study of 
which he has long and successfully applied himself.
" Remarks on the Scenery and Vegetation of Madeira.'' By Dr. Cleghorn, 
H.E.I.C.S. Dr. Cleghorn sailed from Spithead for India on the 15th of August, and 
reached Madeira on the 26th.
His own narrative somewhat condensed is as follows.
In the evening of the 26th the vessel sailed into Funchal Bay. The sea was beau- 
tifully calm â€” glittering like a lake â€” the splash of the dolphin and the scream of the 
sea-bird being the only sounds.
The stupendous mountains which rise behind Fun- 
chal, with their gigantic peaks, are very magnificent, and when viewed by moonlight, 
the general outline of these mountains resembles so much some scenes in the central 
Highlands, that I should have been impressed with the belief that I had been trans- 
ported to Caledonia â€” had not the dense foliage of the plantain, the orange, and other 
trees fringing the coast, proved its vicinity to the tropics.
From whatever quarter the 
island is approached, the aspect is singularly abrupt and picturesque.
Next morning 
we went on shore.
Much care is required in landing, as there is no quay, and the 
rocks are shelving.
When the boat approaches the shore, on a signal being given, 
eight or ten boatmen yelling aloud, and tugging simultaneously, pull the skiff twenty 
yards up an inclined plane, so that passengers must holdfast, or they are capsized.
After a kind reception at the consul's residence, where are some splendid views of 
the neighbouring scenery, I sallied forth to see the lions of Funchal â€” the cathedral, 
nunneries, hospital and fortifications.
Passing through the market, where were abun- 
dance of grapes, figs, dates, oranges, bananas, tomatas, &c., affording a delicious ban- 
194 
4Uet to not a few of my shipmates, whose diet had consisted chiefly of salt junk, I af- 
terwards sought the public garden or pleasure-ground, where the Portuguese were 
playing their national airs on the guitar and machetta, and returned to the consul's, 
carrying as trophies a noble specimen of Coffea arabica, and some ripe and unripe 
fruit of Citrus Limonum and Limetta.
I started early on the morning of the 27th to have a glimpse of the interior, in 
company with three shipmates.
When entering Funchal Bay two evenings before, a 
striking ediiice, apparently imbedded under a canopy of trellis-work and creepers, had 
attracted our attention.
This conspicuous object, our guides now informed us, was 
" Nossa Senhora da Monte," or Mount Church, situated three and a half miles up the 
mountain, behind Funchal.
As the land rises rapidly from the coast to the interior, 
in order to facilitate our progress, long iron spiculse were appended to the posterior 
part of our horses' shoes, presenting in an exaggerated degree the appearance of what 
we call in Scotland %vell frosted.
This is necessary, for the angle of inclination of 
some roads above Funchal is certainly not less than the ascent of Arthur's Seat from 
the Hunter's Bog. These roads, however, though ill-suited for the progression of the 
tourist, are well adapted for the descent of the hogsheads of Madeira from the wine- 
presses above the town.
They are paved with small pebbles (nearly equal in size), 
taken from the ravines and water-courses ; and in the interstices between these stones 
the spiculse mentioned are securely fixed at each step of the horse.
We could not 
ride two abreast, as the road was only six feet broad in some places; and, speaking 
for myself, being mounted on a particularly fiery Pegasus, the occasional passing of a 
sledge, drawn by a couple of pigmy bullocks, was attended with some difficulty.
During the first part of the excursion we traversed a region of terraced vineyards, 
which are arranged in a singularly beautiful manner, the vines being carried on trel- 
lices over the roads, and, occasionally, this refreshing canopy is continued over some 
acres of rich soil â€” forming a lovely covering of leaves and fruit.
These shady avenues 
are an agreeable protection from the rays of the sun, and being arched overhead, have 
the appearance of tunnels : in them the peasants are engaged in vine-dressing during 
the day â€”the children sport in the evening â€” and dogs keep watch by night.
The Arundo donax, which attains a height of twenty feet, is cultivated extensively 
for supporting the vines, and a variety of other purposes.
The soil in the vicinity of Funchal is exceedingly rich, consisting of dark vege- 
table mould, mixed with the debris of volcanic rock, or of beds of stiff" red clay.
The 
latter produces the best vineyards ; and a bed of this description, with traces of iron 
ore, extending to the depth of thirty feet, yielded as fine produce as any that we 
passed in the island.
As we rose from this lower region, where the mountain was clothed with vines and 
figs, and where flocks of canaries of a lively green flew around, we plodded on through 
orange bowers and festoons of fragrant jasmine (Jasminurn odoratissimum).
The 
proud sunflower here overtopped the modest Heliotrope.
There were patches of Cof- 
fea arabica (in cul tivation), Cucurbitacece in great abundance, â€” gourds, melons, 
pumpkins and cucumbers.
We noticed, surrounding a merchant's villa, a stout hedge 
of Fuchsia, and some scattered specimens of Passiflora edulis and quadrangular is.
The Cactacece, singular in appearance and various in habit, showed their spiny heads 
and handsome petals, their roots being sometimes firmly secured in the crevices of the 
granite.
Here were plants of which we have no example in the north.
The vegeta- 
tion was of a diff'erent character from anything I had seen.
495 
It was evident, however, that many of the rare flowers were not indigenous â€” but 
it was not easy to distinguish those that had been introduced, as the whole country at 
this elevation had the appearance of an ornamental garden.
There was a scene of life and motion amongst the herbage, of which our Scottish 
forests afford no idea â€” the leaves of some shrubs being covered with brilliant beetles; 
the abundant foliage giving plentiful nourishment to the swaims of insect tribes.
â€” 
Larks in great numbers were carolling merrily, and kestrils hovering on the mountain 
side.
We dismounted to examine the pictures and architecture of the Mount Church, 
dedicated to Santa Maria, and from our now elevated position enjoyed a truly magnifi- 
cent view (the platform and gateway were mantled with luxuriant shoots of Lonicera 
and Clematis).
Below us lay the town and bay of Funcbal ; eastward, the singular 
promontory which we had rounded on entering the bay, and which is known to visit- 
ors by the name of the Brazen Nose ; and to the west, beyond the tract of vineyards, 
is an extensive race-course, with a range of steep craggy rocks jutting out into the sea.
In pursuing the ascent, we rode along a sharp ridge leading to the Caldeira, or 
highest peak of the island, on which is a well-supplied ice-house.
This is the range of 
the Pines and Spanish Chesnuts, and the timber here was not contemptible.
Closely adjoining, at a greater elevation, were many species chiefly of the Labiatee 
and Caryophylleee.
We were now on either side the yawning depth of ravines, where, 
after a few hours' rain, most formidable torrents rush down the adjacent valley to the 
ocean.
There were some remarkably fine s])ecimens of Gijmnogramina Loiuei (named 
in honour of the resident English clergyman, a scientific naturalist) amongst the wet 
rocks of a narrow cleft, through which we passed in crossing a watercourse ; of these 
specimens, some were singular varieties.
Sundry were the risks, as we slowly jogged down the mountain, keeping tight the 
bridle-reins, and the horses occasionally sliding on their haunches.
Thus terminated 
a visit to Madeira, which the novelty of the scenes â€” the hospitality of the British con- 
sul and Portuguese merchants, and the kind attention of the house-surgeon of the hos- 
pital (an Edinburgh graduate), had rendered one of great pleasure and gratification.
BOTANICAL SOCIETY OF LONDON.
November 29, 1842.
â€” Sixth Anniversaiy Meeting; J.
E. Gray, Esq., F.R.S., Pre- 
sident, in the chair.
From the Report of the Council it appeared that 13 new mem- 
bers had been elected since the last anniversary, and that the Society consisted of 152 
members.
The donations to the Library had been very considerable.
The Report of the Herbarium Committee was read, and stated that the British 
herbarium had been in reference order for some lime, and the Committee were using 
their best exertions to obtain the Society's desiderata, which had lately been consider- 
ably diminished by the receipt of many rare plants from Mr. G.
Francis and Mr. S.
P. Woodward, the latter gentleman having presented a large series of British mints, 
collected by the late Mr. Sole of Bath.
Many valuable parcels of British and foreign plants had been received, and the re- 
turn parcels sent to the members had given the greatest satisfaction, in many instan- 
ces the return parcel having been sent within ten days after the receipt of the parcel 
496 
from tlie member.
The Committee anticipate that in future the return parcel will re- 
gularly be sent within ten days after the receipt of a parcel from any contributor.
Amongst the most valuable parcels received during the past season, may be men- 
tioned a large collection of British plants from Mr. Hewett C.
Watson, comprising 
upwards of 5500 specimens ; also numerous Jersey plants from Mr. G.
H. K.
Thwaites.
A large collection of Shropshire Rubi from Mr. H.
Bidwell ; 300 specimens of Bu- 
pleurum falcatuin collected in Essex, from Mr. E.
Doubleday ; and numerous speci- 
mens of Lastrcea cristata, collected in Norfolk by Mr. B.
D. Wardale, and presented 
by that gentleman.
The Committee pointed out the necessity of members sending two labels with each 
specimen, one for permanent preservation in the label-book, which the Committee an- 
ticipate will, in the course of a few years, be valuable as an authentic register of the 
localities of plants, and prove highly serviceable in showing the geographical distribu- 
tion of the species.
Many interesting monstrosities had been received from several of 
the members; and the Committee impressed upon the members the importance of col- 
lecting monstrosities, and their value in a public collection.
Local Herbaria.
â€” The Society had received from Mr. Edwin Lees a herbarium of 
the Malvern Hills, including the Cryptogamic plants ; accompanied with many valu- 
able remarks upon the geographical distribution of the i^lants of the neighbourhood, 
together with the geological character of the neighbouring hills : and the Committee 
hope next year to be able to report the receipt of other local herbaria now in course of 
formation for the Society.
Ci-yptogamous Plants.
â€” The collection of mosses, lichens and Algae received during 
the past season, had been more considerable than during any former period ; and the 
first three volumes of 'Algse Danmonienses,' and part 1 of Berkeley's ' British Fungi,' 
had been presented to the Society by Mrs. Margaret Stovin.
Mr. S.
P. Woodward is 
now actively engaged in arranging the whole Cryptogamic collection.
Foreign Plants.
â€” These form a valuable part of the Society's collection, and com- 
prise plants from North and South America, British Guiana, New South Wales, Cape 
of Good Hope, Sierra Leone, China, and various other parts of the world.
Among the more interesting plants in this collection may be mentioned about 350 
species collected by Mr. R.
H. Schomburgk in British Guiana, and presented by him ; 
250 species collected in Natal, South Africa, by Dr. F.
Krauss ; many thousand spe- 
cimens collected in North America by Dr. Gavin Watson, and presented by him ; and 
numerous species from Dr. C.
F. S.
De Martins, collected by him in South America.
Museum.
â€” Numerous specimens of sections of woods, seed-vessels, barks, and se- 
veral large collections of seeds, had been received, many of them purchased at the sale 
of the botanical museum of the late A.
B. Lambert, Esq., and presented by some of 
the members.
The Reports of the Council and Herbarium-committee were unanimously adopted, 
and a ballot then took place for the Council for the ensuing year, when the chairman 
was re-elected President, and he nominated J.
G. Children Esq., F.R.S., and Hewett 
C. Watson, Esq., F.L.S., Vice-Presidents ; Messrs.
E. Doubleday, G.
Francis, and J.
G. Mitchell were elected new members of the Council, in the room of Dr. Meeson, 
Messrs.
G. Cooper and W.
H. White, who retire from the Council in accordance with 
the Rules of the Society.
Mr. J.
Reynolds, Mr. G.
E. Dennes and Mr. T.
Sansom 
were respectively re-elected Treasurer, Secretary and Librarian.

â€” Notice of a new British Cerastium.
By Thomas Edmonston, jun., Esq.* 
Cerastium latifolium, Linn.
Having for some yeai's entertained the opinion that the plant above 
figured, although generally referred to Cerastium latifolium, was dis- 
tinct fi'om the plant called by that name in Britain, I have paid con- 
siderable attention to our alpine Cerastia, and am disposed to conclude 
that my plant is truly distinct from the C.
latifolium of Smith and 
Hooker.
1 am happy to be able to say that my valued and eminent 
* Communicated by Charles C.
Babington, Esq., M.A., F.L.S.
2u 
498 
friend Mr. Babington, on a careful study of the subject, concurs in 
this opinion, and I am delighted to fortify my own view with that of 
so distinguished an observer.
After attentively comparing numerous specimens, both recent and 
dried, of the C alpinum and latifolium of our Scotch and Welch 
mountains, I am perfectly unable to detect any specific difference be- 
tween them.
Sir W.
Hooker, in ' Flora Scotica,' gives as the main 
distinction, the capsules in C.
alpinum being " oblong, curved," and in 
C. latifohum " ovate," (Fl. Scot.
144) ; while in ' British Flora,' ed.
3, 
p. 217, he says, "I agree with Mr. Wilson in thinking that there ex- 
ists scarcely any difference, either in the flower or fruit, between this 
(C.
latifolium) and the preceding (C.
alpinum) ; in both, the capsules are 
broadly oblong, shining, nearly twice as long as the calyx," &c., and 
the distinguishing characters between the two plants seem to be on- 
ly in the pubescence, viz., C.
alpinum being " clothed with long silky 
hairs," and C.
latifolium " clothed with short, rigid, yellowish pubes- 
cence." After a careful examination of numerous specimens I have 
drawn up the following descriptions, and shall then endeavour to es- 
tablish the essential characters of the three plants, viz., the one from 
Shetland, and the C.
alpinum and latifolium of our authors.
Cerastium latifolium, (Linn.) 
Plant 2 â€” 5 inches high, branching ; stems prostrate for about half 
their length, then ascending, never rooting ; whole plant covered with 
a dense, short, glandular pubescence ; leaves orbicular, obtuse, dark 
green; Jrac^eas herbaceous, lanceolate, acute; sepals blunt, with a 
membranous border half their own breadth ; peduncles one-flowered, 
equalling the flower ; Jiowers large, white, with green veins in the in- 
side ; petals bifid at the apex ; capsule ovate, shining, scarcely longer 
than the calyx, opening with ten valves.
This seems to be the original plant of Linnaeus, and the C.
latifo- 
lium of the continental botanists, for I have specimens commimicated 
by M.
Leresche from the Alpes du Vallais, exactly similar to the 
Shetland specimens, except in having the leaves slightly acute ; and 
Mr, Babington writes me that Reichenbach, in his ' Icones Florae 
Germanicae, figures the form as " C.
latifolium, var.
glaciate, of Gau- 
din, Fl. Helv." 
Abundant on a serpentine hill to the north of the bay of Baltasound, 
Unst, Shetland, extending over about a square mile of ground.
This 
station is interesting as being the only one hitherto known in Britain 
499 
for Arenaria norvegica.
1 am not aware of any other British habitat 
for it, neither have I seen any foreign specimens.

acute ; hracteas with a narrow membranous border ; sepals sometimes 
with a nan-ow membranous border ; Jlowers one, two, or three toge- 
ther in a forked panicle ; peduncle considerably longer than the 
flower ; Jlowers as in the last ; capsule broadly ovate, shining, twice 
as long as the calyx, opening with ten teeth.

Stems generally branched, ascending, sometimes rooting at the base; 
plant with a short, rigid ("yellowish" Hook.), pubescence; leaves 
oblong, acute ; bracteas often wanting, when present mostly with a 
narrow membranous margin; peduncles generally one-flowered, long- 
er than the flower ; capsule as in the last.
Of this plant Mr. Babington says " I believe that it is correctly re- 
fened by Bentham to the C.
alpinum as &.
piloso-pubescens^'' (Bab.
in litt.) 
This, with the last, grows on the more elevated mountains of Scot- 
land, as well as on Snowdon, and I believe other Welsh mountains.
/3.
seems less common than a., but I have specimens from several 
mountains of the Cairngorum range, as well as Clova, &c.
From these observations I think it will be evident not only that the 
Shetland plant is distinct, but that there exists no specific difference 
between C.
alpinum and latifolium, Sm. and Hook.
The differential 
characters I propose are the following.
C. alpinmn, Linn, Leaves ovate or ovato-lanceolate, acute ; brac- 
teas with a membranous border ; sepals with scarcely any border ; 
peduncle longer than the flower ; capsule twice as long as the calyx.
C. latifolium, Linn.
Leaves orbicular, obtuse ; bracteas without 
the membranous margin ; sepals with a broad border ; peduncle as 
long as a flower ; capsule scarcely longer than the calyx.

â€” Catalogue of Plants observed in the neighbourhood 
of Daventry, Northamptonshire.
By Mr. W.
L. Notcutt.
In forwarding a list of the plants of Daventry, Northamptonshire, 
I have thought that a sketch of the general character and geological 
formation of the neighbourhood might not be unacceptable, as I think 
it of importance to trace the connexion between Geology and botani- 
cal Geography.
Daventry is a market-town seventy-two miles from 
London, and is situate in the western part of the county of Northamp- 
ton.
The geological formation upon which it stands is the lower 
oolite, which however terminates at the distance of two or three miles 
on the north-western side of the town, where the lias formation ap- 
pears from beneath it : on the other side it extends over nearly the 
whole county of Northampton.
In many parts of the neighbourhood 
the coarse yellowish oolitic limestone lies within two or three feet of 
501 
the surface, and is quarried for mending the roads.
In these spots I 
do not think any plants of interest have been noted.
The oolite is 
characterized by its peculiar fossils, as pectens, Terebratulse, Ammo- 
nites, Belemnites, &c., many species of which are found in the stone- 
pits near the town in great abundance.
On the south side of the town 
is Borough Hill, which is chiefly composed of sand, with nodules of 
sandstone, and which probably belongs to the oolitic period.
On the 
top of this hill is a Roman entrenchment, within and on the borders 
of which are found many rare plants : the hill has been enclosed 
within the last fifty years.
Three other hills on the other sides of the 
town, viz., Newnham Hill, Fox Hill and Welton Hill, appear to be 
composed of the same kind of sand as Borough Hill, but they are ra- 
ther barren of interest in a botanical point of view.
Two large reser- 
voirs, formed for the purpose of supplying the Grand Junction Canal 
with water, are situated within a mile of the town, and bear on their 
margins a few aquatic and marsh plants worth notice, but from their 
recent formation it is not to be expected that a great variety will be 
found at present.
Watling Street, one of the old Roman roads, runs 
within three miles of the town, and contains one or two very interest- 
ing species.
Many of the plants which grow around Daventry are remarkably 
local there, being found in only one or two spots : and this feature 
prevails to a greater extent than I have noticed anywhere else.
I 
may just add that the following list is the result of a diligent investi- 
gation of the neighbourhood within a distance of three or three and a 
half miles from Daventry, during a residence there of between three 
and four years.

It is probable that 
this celebrated plant will not much 
longer exist in the above locality; it 
is now nearly extirpated, in conse-

of cattle for it.

trict, the proportion they bear to the flowering plants being .as 1 to 
TOg-, the smallest with which 1 am acquainted.

Athyrium irriguuyn.
This seemingly starved variety of Filix-femina is to be found 
in abundance in a lane near Harbourne, growing round a small spring, which seems 
as if it affected the plant by some peculiarity in the water, for at the distance of ten 
or twelve feet it gradually merges into the more usual type of Filix-femina.
Speci- 
mens of this variety were planted in the Binningham Botanic Garden, where for two 
or three years they remained pretty distinct, but afterwards the distinction grew more 
faint, and the whole plant became more luxuriant : D.

Art. CXXIV, â€” Notice of the * Proceedings of the Berwickshire 
Naturalists Club, for 1842.'* 
The perusal of this delightful summary of the proceedings of this 
little band of naturalists during the late glorious summer, is enough 
to make one " babble o' gi-een fields " even amidst the snow-covered 
houses and streets of London on this present 18th of February, 1843.
There is that sparkling freshness in its details, slight though they be, 
which nothing but an intimate acquaintance with the manifold beau- 
ties of Nature can have imparted to them.
But before we enter upon 
the pleasing duty of giving our readers a brief analysis of the botani- 
cal contents of this brochure, a few words on the nature and objects 
of the club may not be unacceptable.
From a notice in Loudon's ' Magazine of Natural History ' we learn 
that " The Berwickshire Naturalists' Club was instituted in Septem- 
ber, 1831, by some gentlemen who interested themselves in Natural 
History, and were anxious to do their best to aid one another in their 
pursuits, and to diffuse a taste for them among others.
The club 
meets four times in the year, and the place of its meeting is changed 
every time, to afford the members an opportunity of examining in suc- 
cession every part of the neighbourhood.
The members meet early 
in the morning; they spend the forenoon in excursions, and they again 
assemble at dinner, after which any papers that may be laid before 
them are read and discussed freely." â€” vi.
11.
The first president was the eminent naturalist Dr. Johnston, author 
of the ' Flora of Berwick,' who has taken the warmest interest in the 
welfare of the club from its first establishment.
The members held 
their first anniversary meeting at Coldstream, on the 19th of Septem- 
ber, 1831.
The address now before us was read at Lowick, on the 
28th of September, 1843, at the eleventh annual meeting; and exhi- 
bits " the result of the labours, or rather the harvest reaped, not by 
bodily fatigue, but yielded to the agreeable recreation and innocent 
pastime of men happy to escape from the monotonous toil of their 
necessary occupations, to i*evel in all the beauty of Nature's loveliest 
scenes, and the thousand charms of her everchanging aspects, and to 
have their feelings elevated, and their minds improved, by the calm 
contemplation of the wonderful works of God." â€” Address, p.
1. 
The anniversary meeting for 1841 was held at Kelso; the details 
* We have ventured to give a title to this interesting publication : would it not be 
w^U to print it on future wrappers ?

were furnished by Dr. F.
Douglas, who, after describing the ramble 
on the banks of Tweed, states that â€” 
" During the walk, nothing new was observed.
Several plants, however, were no- 
ticed which are of rare occurrence within the limits of the club, such as Viola hirta, 
Thalictrum majus, Clinopodium vulgare, Epipactis latifolia, Listera cordata ; and Dr.
F. Douglas pointed out the habitat of a beautiful coral-like fungus â€” Clavaria rosea 
â€” which has not been discovered in any other locality in Great Britain.
Some small 
specimens were gathered, but they were not in perfection, and their beauty was nearly 
gone.'' â€” 3.
The first meeting for the year 1842 was held at Coldstream, on the 
4th morning of the " merrie month of May ; " and a right gladsome 
May-morning it must have been, as the following extract, redolent 
of the country, will amply testify, 
" The rest of the members took a delightful walk down the banks of the Tweed by 
Lennel to Milnegraden, where the lovely scenery, rendered doubly alluring by the now 
bursting foliage of the woods spangled with heaven's own diamonds, and offering to 
the eye all the varied tints of ' many greens,' and the promise of future luxuriance, 
amply repaid all who enjoyed this walk, for the disappointment attending their search 
for a piece of water which was expected to afford a rich harvest of aquatic plants and 
insects in its ample bosom, to ' the careful and scientific explorers of its hidden trea- 
sures ; ' but which the fairies or good people had either spirited away or rendered invi- 
sible to the eyes of the expectant naturalists.
Be this as it may, no lake could be found, 
but many other very interesting objects were seen and duly appreciated.
The humi- 
dity of the morning had tempted from their lurking-places several varieties of snail, 
and a few were gathered.
The hawthorn, with its beautiful white blossoms and rich 
scent perfuming the air, was gathered in full blow in several situations â€” a proof of 
the forwardness of the season.
The sand-martin was seen in great plenty, skimming 
over the waters, and excavating its simple habitation in the banks which overhang the 
Tweed ; and the varied sweetness of the thousand warblers trilling their songs of love, 
added a charm to the morning's ramble, which the denizens of our crowded and bust- 
ling towns can but rarely taste ; and if this club had no other or higher object than 
occasionally to give such a delightful change and peaceful recreation to those whose 
occupation confines them to the desk, or the close and uninteresting monotony of a 
town life, that object alone would render it a blessing to the neighbourhood." â€” p.

The minutes of the next meeting, held at Gordon on the 15th of June, 
furaish a more purely botanical extract, which to us is doubly inte- 
resting, inasmuch as it relates principally to the charming Linnsea 
borealis, â€” that " little northern plant, long overlooked, depressed, ab- 
ject, flowering early," the very type of the early fortunes of him whose 
name it will transmit to future ages, â€” which, gracefully encircling the 
features of our own illustrious Eay, monthly greets the readers of 
' The Phytologist.' 
" The chief object of the club's meeting at Gordon was to gather Linnaea borealis 
517 
in the til-woods of Lightfield, upon the Mellerstaiii estate; and thitlier, by a circuitous 
route over moss and luuir, the eager party bent their steps.
The first object which at- 
tracted speci;il attention was an ancient and ruinous tower, situated to the west of tlie 
village, and formerly occupied by the powerful family of Setons, who were allied to 
the noble house of Gordon, fonnerly the proprietors of tliat district of country.
Near 
the old ruin Chelidonium raajus was found, furnishing another illustration to the opin- 
ion that this plant was introduced into horticulture at an early era.
In the peaty muir 
on the farm of Greenknow, were gathered Stellaria glauca and Myosotis palustris, 
while in the nearly stagnant waters of the Eden, was observed another plaut of rare 
occurrence in Berwickshire, viz., Sparganium natans.
After leaving the moss, every 
fir-wood and thicket for miles around were penetrated and carefully searched for the 
humble little flower bearing the name of the immortal Swede.
The search was, alas 
in vain ; and after continuing it for fully three hours, the spirits of the party flagged, 
and they returned disappointed to the inn, where a good dinner and excellent liquore 
soon dispelled any portion of vexation which might still be felt at the want of success 
attending the expedition.
One of the members of the club, however, nothing daunted 
by a single failure, aud anticipating better fortune in a second attempt, did not allow 
many days to elapse until he was again in the woods, in the hope of securing the pri- 
zed Linna'a, and most fully and amply was he rewarded by beholding a large space 
of ground covered with the delicate shining leaves of the trailing little plant, with here 
and there a short flower-stalk ascending, and bearing a pair of beautiful pinkish bell- 
shaped flowers, bending gracefully downwards : iuuumerable specimens of the finest 
description were obtained.
" It seemed remarkable that on the first search for it, all the members had passed 
within five yards of the spot where the Linnaea grew.
Listera cordata, Trollius euro- 
paeus, Pyrola minor, were found in the woods during the course of the forenoon's walk, 
and a new fungus, Jilcidium Pini, was added to the cryptogamic Flora of the county, 
the bark of the fir-tree on which it grew being totally destroyed by its ravages." â€” p.
5. 
At this meeting was read a paper by Mr. Hardy, entitled ' Butter- 
cups and Daisies,' in which the question of the etymology of the 
terms gouUins, gowans, gollands &c.
is fully discussed, and the vari- 
ous plants to which these names have been applied, arc jiointed out.
The author observes that these terms, " as applied to plants, are ob- 
viously related, and appear to derive tlieir origin ft-om the Anglo-Sax- 
on (jold, or, if we wish to consult a more remote parentage, from tlie 
Suio-Gothic gul, gol, yellow." Several dainty quotations from the 
old herbalists are scattered through the paper, and show that various 
yellow flowers, such as different species of Ranuncidus, Caltha palus- 
tris, Trollius europicus and the coni-marygold, wore all known as yel- 
low gowans; while the white division includes the daisy â€” the gowau 
par excellence, which "stands at the head of its class, without a peer, 
the type, as it were, in which all the superior pro})erties of the other 
species are blended." 
Then we have " the horse-gowan, the Berwickshire name for Pyre- 
thrum inodorum, Chrysanthonuim Leucanthcnuun and Anthemis ar- 
518 
vensis." But we must take leave of this subject, which we do most 
reluctantly, consoling ourselves as best we may with the following 
extract from Turner's Herbal, being a description of his " Lukken 
Gollande," which is believed to be no other than our Caltha palustris, 
though from Hodgson's ' History of Northumberland ' it appears that 
the names " locken-gowen " and " goudie-locks " are equally applied 
to Trollius europaeus.

In August the club met at Abbey St Bathans, being led thither " by 
its retired position and celebrity for natural beauty." " In such a lo- 
cality," it is remarked, "the club finds the material for forming a cor- 
rect idea of the nature, extent, and composition of the ancient forests 
in which their forefathers may, perchance, have hunted the deer, with 
hound and horn, in the gallant company of a Douglas or a Percy." 
The following is a fancy sketch, or rather a restoration, of an ancient 
border forest scene, drawn from materials still existing at Abbey 
St. Bathans.
" In the many ravines which descended from the moor above, and in whose bot- 
toms a runlet had cut its way amid shelving rocks, we found many springy spots oc- 
cupied principally with some shrubby wUows {Satix aurita and cinerea), intermingled 
with arching briars and wild roses.
In others the alder grew predominant, while rush- 
es and meadow-sweet and marsh thistles filled up the under ground, leaving often a 
middle space carpeted with mosses of yellow-green, and too moist for the growth of 
other plants than the willow-herbs, the forget-me-not, the ranunculus, and other semi- 
aquatic herblets.
But the drier ground was mainly occupied with the birch, rising up 
from amid a bed of tall heather or of blaeberries ; while a tree of oak, of the mountain 
ash, and of the tree willow {Salix caprea), grew up among the birches, marked, each 
of them, by its peculiar shade of green.
Where, again, the streamlet had cut its chan- 
nel deeper, and at a lower level, the vegetation became more free and various ; the al- 
der was more common and luxuriant ; the rose and briar arched their bows with greater 
freedom; the rowan-tree assumed a taller habit, and by its side the hagberry grew, as 
if conscious Nature had pleasure in the augmented beauty which each derived from 
the contrast between their intermingled foliage, flowers and fruit.
Here all the under- 
ground was occupied by luxuriant ferns, bending in graceful plumes over the shelving 
edges of the banks, with tall nodding rushes and grasses, wild geraniums, hypericums 
and willow-herbs, and various umbelliferous and compound syngenesious plants.
Every spot is a picture, and every one so fertile in flowers, that the botanist may cull 
there alone a richly varied herbarium, from the green moss, through whose dense 
519 
mass the spring filters its waters, to the hazel and the oak that shelter the pool lÂ»e- 
neath their shade from the too hot influence of the sun.
" How different again is the wood that hangs on the sides of the hills rising from 
the valley on each side of the principal stream or river !
It consists principally of oak, 
of moderate size at the base of the hill, gradually diminishing in stature as we ascend, 
until we find it at the summit nearly level with the surface of the ground, spreading 
in low, circular, leafy bushes.
This troop of oaks is intermingled with a considerable 
quantity of birch, as various as the oak itself in size and appearance, while an ash 
tree rises tall above them both at distant intervals.
The " bonnie broom " is frequent 
and tall on the lower line of this wood, while the whin occupies the line above with a 
denser growth than usual.
The intermediate ground under and amidst the trees is 
full sometimes of a coarser herbage, rich in fungous growths, and where lichens make 
the trunks all leprous ; sometimes moss predominates, and this is the habitat too for 
Melampyrum sylvaticum ; in other places are long streams of stones and gravel, co- 
vered partially with briars, trailing roses, and with green patches of wild sage {Teu- 
crium Seorodonia), or of the herb ]\Iercury {Mercurialis perennis).
" Such fancy paints our ancient border forests to have been, and probably there is 
much of reality and truth in the picture.
A wide mountainous and barren tract, in- 
tersected by a principal devious stream, having, on each side of it, an alluvial plain of 
some breadth that afforded good and abundant pasture for the horses, herds and flocks 
of the rude inhabitants.
On each side there run up ravines of greater or lesser depths, 
every one with a burn or rivulet in its bottom ; some rocky and clean â€” others with 
plashy places, while the hills are occupied with woods such as we have attempted to 
describe, and the plains above are brown barren moors, varied with peat-hags and co- 
vers of whins and of broom, as the depth of the soil afi'orded a locality for their growth.
Through these forests herds of red and fallow deer were wont to roam at freedom, and 
were the chase which our forefathers pursued with almost savage raptures â€” while now 
the ground is occupied with new and foreign plantations, with corn, with artificial pas- 
tures, and the hills are covered with flocks of sheep, obedient to the call of the shep- 
herd, and browsing watchless, because they know no danger." â€” p.
7. 
Fiu-ther on the writer observes it were " easy to imagine that on 
such a day as ours was â€” tempted by its sunshine and its fairness â€” 
the proud abbot of Coldingham had chosen it whereon to visit the 
sister abbey of St. Bathans, and was now descending, in all the state 
and panoply of his order, the height that overhung the hidden retreat 
about us !
" 
It is somewhat strange that in a botanical light this promising loca- 
lity should possess bul little interest.
The only plants found worthy 
particular notice are said to have been Hieracium palustre, H.
bore- 
ale [Koch), and H.
sylvaticum ; all three occuiTed "in tolerable abun- 
dance in the rocky bed of Monnie-nut burn, below Godscroft; and 
Melampyrum sylvaticum, which was abundant in the oak woods.
â€” 
Quercus Robur was the oak principally observed, " but many speci- 
mens approached Q.
sessiliflora in its peculiarities."

The last botanical notice in the number is a short but interesting 
separate paper entitled â€” 
''^Notice of the Smilacina hifolia (Convallaria hifoUaJ, a British 
Plant.
By R.
Embleton, Surgeon.
" For my knowledge of this interesting addition to the British Flora, I am indebt- 
ed to my friend, the Rev. Osd.
Head, of Howiclc, who discovered it growing, rather 
sparingly, " under the shade of a wide spreading heech," in one of the woods at How- 
ick.
It has hitherto been found in France, Germany, and other parts of the conti 
nent ; and I possess a specimen in my herbarium from Norway, collected by my friend 
Mr. R.
B. Bowman, of Leadenhall St., London.
It is a graceful and beautiful plant, 
and well deserves a share of the admiration which is so universally given to the other 
members of the natural family (the lily of the valley tribe) to which it belongs.
It is 
easily recognised by its creeping roots, from which arises a delicate stem from live to 
seven inches in height, with two alternate ovate leaves, and terminated by a spike of 
small, delicate, white flowers.
It flowers in July.
" Since its discovery in the woods of Howick, I am informed by Mr. Duncan, Earl 
Grey's gardener, that it is found in the woods at Kenwood, the seat, I believe, of the 
Earl of Mansfield, and from which place, through the kindness of the same individu- 
al, I possess specimens, which do not show any diS'erence from those gathered at 
Howick, with the exception of their being a little more succulent.
It is there found 
in similar situations, namely, under the shade of beech and fir trees.
It may, proba- 
bly, hereafter be found in many other quiet, shady spots of our native woods, and will 
well repay the wandering botanist for his labour of love in its search.
"Embleton, Sept.
21, 1842." 
Much as we should rejoice at seeing the claims of this pretty little 
plant to a place among our indigenous species fully established, we 
must confess that at present we can only look upon it as an intruder, 
although one which we can hail with a hearty welcome.
Loudon 
gives the year 1596 as the date of its introduction into Britain, so 
that it is perhaps only surprising that it should not have been previ- 
ously met with in an apparently wild state.
There are several other 
plants possessing an equally good title to be recognized as British, 
since they are at least completely naturalized, and yet botanists are 
not at all disposed to look upon them as true Britons : Lihum Marta- 
gon, Chelidonium majus and Ornithogalum nutans maybe mentioned 
as examples.
Linnaeus, in his ' Flora Lapponica,' enters fully into 
the consideration of the question whether this plant should or should 
be considered a species of Convallaria; and comes to the conclusion 
that it really belongs to that genus.
We hope at no very distant period to be able to renew our acquain- 
tance with the ' Proceedings of the Berwickshire Naturalists' Club.'

Remedial use of a Fern called " Dail llosg y Tan.'''' The fol- 
lowing notice relative to the remedial use of a fern in connexion with 
the late Lady Greenly, of Titley Court, Herefordshire, may perhaps be 
interesting, as proving the advantage of a botanical acquaintance with 
plants ; for the worthy author of the memoir of Lady Greenly, being 
unable to give anything but the Welch name of the fern in question, 
of course it is rather uncertain what he means.
I should conjecture 
the plant to be Cetei'ach officinarum.* Perhaps some Cambrian bo- 
tanist may know more about it.
The memoir I allude to appeared in 
' The Hereford Times ' of the 12th of November last, and is prefixed 
to a Welch Marwnad or death-song to her memory, composed by the 
Rev. J.
Jones (Tegid), rector of Nevern, Pembrokeshire, and to which 
the prize was awarded at the ninth anniversary of the Abergavenny 
Cymreigyddion, Oct. 12, 1842.
It is therein stated that â€” " She also 
loved flowers, but the properties of plants was one of her favourite 
studies, and a pursuit which she turned to the benefit of the poor.
â€” 
She used to cultivate a variety of herbs, and administered medicine to 
all those who needed it in her neighbourhood.
Amongst the plants 
for which she evinced a particular regard, was that called in Wales â€” 
' Dail llosg y Tan ; ' it is a species of evergreen fem, indigenous to 
Gwent and Morganwg ; and Lady Greenly having ascertained from 
her excursions among the Welch peasantry, that is was (as its name 
denotes) of value as a remedy for burns, she took pains to make it 
grow in Herefordshire, and succeeded in getting it to floui-ish round 
her favourite well at Titley." â€” E.

Note on Bryum Tozeri.
As ' The Phytologist ' notices Bry- 
um Tozeri being found in a barren state this year in Kent (Phytol.

Griffiths met with 
the capsules of this rare moss in tolerable abundance, near Torquay, 
last March.

Mr, Gibson (Phytol.

plants have one or two seeds.
If he will, next summer, examine the 
plants carefully, he will find that the ovary has two ovules, but that 
* In Davies's ' Welsh Botanology ' " Rhedyn y gogofau," and " Dueg-redynen 
feddygawl," are given as the Welsh names of Ceterach officinarum ; " Dail llosg y 
Tan," which we do not find in Davies, is probably the local name of some common 
species.

only one seed usually comes to perfection.
He will also observe a 
curious change of the dissepiment into a funiculus.
At first the ova- 
ry has two cells, with one ovule in each ; afterwards, as one of the 
ovules outgrows the other, the dissepiment gradually disappears, only 
a sufficient portion of it remaining to act as a funiculus, springing 
from the bottom of the cell and suspending the seed.
No doubt oc- 
casionally two seeds are perfected, which will account for the discre- 
pancy pointed out by Mr. Gibson.

Note on the supposed new British Cuscuta.
Having seen a 
notice (Phytol.
466) of the discovery of a supposed new British Cus- 
cuta, by Mr. C.
C. Babington, of Cambridge, it may be interesting to 
the discoverer to know that while on a visit at Ramsgate in August 
last, 1 detected a Cuscuta in one or two places in a clover-field on the 
right hand side of the road leading from St. Peter's to Broadstairs, 
and which appeared to me at the time to be a variety of C.
Epithy- 
mum.
I am now however inclined to think, fi:om Mr. Babington's 
description, that it may turn out to be the same plant as that describ- 
ed by him under the name of C.
Trifolii.
It was by no means abun- 
dant, and it occurred in patches.
I subsequently detected it in small 
quantity in one or two other places in the Isle of Thanet, where it ap- 
peared to have greatly injured the crops of clover.
I shall take the 
earliest opportunity of further investigating the subject, and commu- 
cating the result in ' The Phytologist.' â€” T.

'List of a few Plaiits observed in Lincolnshire.
Lincolnshire 
presents one of the most attractive and prolific fields for the botanist 
in the east of England.
The richness and variety of the soil, added 
to its wide extent, combine in rendering it well worthy the attention 
and careful investigation of every lover of Natural History.
It is un- 
der this impression that I think the following list of some of the more 
uncommon plants observed by me during the last few years in the 
neighbouihood of Gainsborough, may not prove altogether unaccept- 
able.
The district to which I have confined my researches, oflfers 
perhaps a greater variety than any other part of the county ; the rich 
523 
pasture land which clothes the banks of the river Trent, and the waste 
uncultivated tracts in the neighbourhood of Scotter and Laughton, 
occupy the most prominent part of it, and cannot fail to repay the 
researches of all those who take any interest in the botanical pro- 
ductions of this locality.
The following then are those which have 
principally come under my observation, and which I consider most 
worthy of notice.
Pinguicula vulgaris.
Abundant on Scotton common, but I am aware of no other 
spot in the neighbourhood in which it occurs.
Utricularia minor.
Bogs near Laughton, but not common.
Menyanthes trifoliata.
Extremely plentiful on Laughton common and at Scotton.
Hottonia palustris.
Occurs in a pond at Knaith, but is extremely scarce.
Lysimachia vulgaris.
On the bunks of the Trent, not uncommon ; also in tolera- 
ble abundance at Scotter.
Anagallis tenella.
Occurs sparingly on Scotton common and at Knaith.
Gentiana Pneumonanthe.
In abundance on Scotton common ; less frequent in 
Scotter wood.
Drosera rotundifolia and longifoUa. Plentiful on Scotton common 
Nartheciu7n ossifragum.
Scotton common, and in the fens about Laughton, abndt.
Convallaria majalis.
Lea wood ; also at Manby.
Paris quadrifolia.
In Gate Burton and Lee woods in abundance.
Butomus umhellntus.
Ditches on the banks of the Trent and at Scotter.
Reseda Luteola.
Exceedingly common on the banks of the Trent.
Geum rivale.
Very common in Gate Burton wood.
Stratiotes aloides.
Said to be found near Gainsborough, but this I am inclined lo 
think is not now the case, having never met with it in my researches, nor have I heartl 
of its being found by other collectors.
Galeopsis versicolor.
Sparingly at Laughton, in cornfields.
Digitalis purpurea.
Scarce in the neighbourhood, but occurring in small quanti- 
ties in fields between Gate Burton and Knaith.
Eupatorium Cannabinum.
Hedges near Susworth.
Petasites vulgaris.
Banks of the Trent near Gainsborough.
Hahenaria bifolia.
Plentiful in Gate Burton wood.
Ophrys muscifera.
One or two specimens have occurred at Manby wood, but it is 
decidedly uncommon.
Aceras anthropophora.
Plentiful in Gate Burton wood, with Habenaria bifolia.
Sagittana sagittifolia.
Very common in the river Ean at Scotter.

Monstrosities in the Flowers of a Fuchsia.
The first I shall 
notice is interesting to the morphological enquirer, and tends strongly 
to support the views of Professor C.
Morrcn of Liege (Ann. and Mag.
Nat. Hist.
vii.
1), that the formation of anomalous flowers is caused 
by a descending metamorphosis, or from the centre to the circumfe- 
rence, and which he sought to verify by the gradual changes observ- 
able in the double variety of the common columbine, showing that 
524 
as tlie cells of the anthers vanished the connective expanded, until at 
last it became a perfect horn-shaped nectary.
In the flower alluded 
to above, the connective of one of the stamens shot forth beyond the 
anthers, and by the time they had opened and discharged their pol- 
len, it had assumed the form of a complete ovate petal, about four 
lines long and three broad ; the part of the connective that formed 
the claw or stem of the petal, was about three lines long and one in 
breadth ; the anthers were as close together, and to all appearance as 
full of pollen, as those on any of the other filaments, and the colour 
of the petaloid expansion was the same rich purple as the petals, be- 
ing in the stem part, before it reached the anthers, of the scarlet hue 
of the filaments.
We have thus a corroborative proof of the truth of 
the hypothesis advanced by the Professor, â€” a stamen not only per- 
forming its own proper functions, but further, from its luxuriance pos- 
sessing the power to form, and fully develope, one of the next outer 
circle of floral organs, or the very reverse of the statement of Mr. Hill 
(Phytol.
368), that a stamen is only a modified petal.
Another flower on the same plant exhibited a redundance in all the 
floral organs, with the exception of the pistil ; the calyx having six 
segments, and there were eight petals and twelve stamens : thus de- 
parting, in its calyx and stamens, from the binary character of its fa- 
mily, but even in its irregularity showing the intimate connexion of 
the sepals and stamens.

Retnarks on the Fern-lists.
I have had much pleasure in 
reading the three county lists of ferns and their allies ; but perhaps 
you will allow me, through the medium of ' The Phytologist,' to ask 
your Lancashire friends the two following questions : â€” first, whether 
Greenfield is situated in the county of York or Lancaster ?
secondly, 
whether Cotteril-clough is in Cheshire or Lancashire ?
The locality 
for Hymenophyllum Wilsoni at Hake-Hey common involves a two- 
fold error, since Rake-Hey common is undoubtedly in the county of 
York, and the plant growing there is certainly Hymenophyllum Tun- 
bridgense.

Mr. Hewett Watson's grounds for connecting the name of 
" Mr. S.
Gibson " with some botanical localities.
In the February 
No.
(Phytol.
477) the name of a Mr. Gibson, but I know not whether the 
Mr. Gibson who writes to ' The Phytologist,' is stated to have been in- 
correctly connected by Mr. Francis with an alleged locality of Polj'po- 
dium calcareum "near Lancaster." It is probable that the locality was 
communicated to Mr. Francis, on the authority of a specimen pre- 
served in my herbarium with a memorandum to indicate that it was 
525 
received from Mr. R.
B. Bowman, who in turn had received it from 
â€” Gibson.
Unluckily, I have not preserved also the label which 
came to my hands along with the specimen, but there are other cir- 
cumstances which will identify the donor of the specimen to Mr. Bow- 
man.
About the years 1832-4 I received numerous dried plants from 
the north of England, by the kindness of that accurate botanist, but 
several of them gathered by other persons.
Among those plants were 
a few, mostly fragmentary and ill-dried specimens, accompanied by 
labels quite different from the neat labels of Mr. Bowman ; and to 
these labels the name of " S.
Gibson " was subscribed.
One of them 
is now before me, the same that is referred to, on p.
652, in the ' Sup- 
plement to the New Botanist's Guide ; ' the name of the place cannot 
be made out on this label, which was evidently written by an unedu- 
cated person.
From recollection I should say that the other labels, 
on which the name of " S.
Gibson " was written, were similar to this 
one in the quality of paper and character of handwriting; and it is 
thus quite possible that the writer intended some other locality, which 
was misread by myself into " Lancaster." If the name of your corre- 
spondent, Mr. S.
Gibson, had been attached to any locality " near 
Lancaster," for Polypodium Dryopteris, in Mr. Newman's list of Lan- 
cashire ferns, I should have conjectured some discrepancy of opinion 
with respect to the specific name, â€” for, in truth, this one, and two or 
three other specimens in my herbarium, incline towards P.
Dryopte- 
ris ; but that not being the case, we must suppose either an error as 
to the locality, or an error on the part of your correspondent in hastily 
assuming himself to be the person intended.
At all events, he will 
know whether he formerly did send dried plants to Mr. Bowman.
The name of "S.
Gibson" being the authority for other locaHties of 
scarce plants, in the New Guide, it would be worth while to ascertain 
who the person truly is, and what reliance can be placed on his 
reports of localities for dubiously British plants, â€” for example 
Geranium nodosum, as having been gathered by him near Halifax.

" The second time I met with it was in going from Lyndhurst in the New Forrest 
to Brockenhurst ; there is a watercourse at the entrance of the village, over which there 
are bridges, but it then being dry weather, there was no running stream, but the water 
stood in pools ; in these pools I observed to grow both the small and great Water- 
Lilly ; they were both in blossom together, so that the distinction was easily made and 
the diflference was pretty remarkable.

Supposed new British Fern.
Since the publication of a note 
on a supposed new British Adiantum (Phytol.
462), T have submitted 
the specimen to Mr. Wilson and Mr. Babington, both of whom fully 
concur with me in thinking it distinct.
Still, as an unintentional 
transposition of specimens may possibly have taken place, and as I 
can find no Arran specimens in London, with which to compare the 
specimen in question, I hesitate to publish the species as new.
If 
this should meet the eye of any botanist who can supply me with au- 
thentic specimens from Arran, even on loan, I shall esteem it a great 
favour.

BOTANICAL SOCIETY OF EDINBURGH.
February 9, 1843.
â€” Professor Graham in the chair.
Churchill Babington, Esq., 
St. John's College, Cambridge, and G- G.
Gibson, Esq., Saffron Walden, Essex, were 
elected non-resident fellows, and Alex.
Paterson Esq., a resident fellow of the Society.
Various donations of plants were announced.
Professor Graham then read a highly interesting account of his botanical excur- 
sion in Ross-shire during August, 1842, with a party of friends.
The party left Edin- 
burgh on the 21st of August, and met at Dingwall ; â€” thence they walked by Garve, 
Auchnalt &c.
for Kinlochewe.
On the low hills near Garve they found a sprinkling 
of alpine vegetation, and Nymphaea alba, beautifully in flower, in a pool near the top 
of one of them, at a higher elevation than had been previously observed.
The season 
having been remarkably dry, all the lakes were far below their usual level, and in con- 
sequence such plants as Lobelia Dortmanna, Subularia aquatica, &c.,were seen, won- 
dering at each other, in flower and fruit, on dry ground.
Things, however, were now 
changed, for the party had scarcely a dry day during the whole of their excursion, and 
few such as admitted of the vegetation being carefully examined.
Several days were 
spent among the mountains about Loch Maree, which are chiefly composed of red 
sandstone, with quartz tops â€” and by no means prolific in interesting vegetation.
Cor- 
527 
nus suecica, Saussurea alpina, Hieracium alpinum, Rubus Chamaemorus, Arbutus al- 
pina, Azalea procumbeus, Cherleria sedoides, Sibbaldia procumbens &c.
were among 
the rarest plants observed â€” and, rather unusually, all the six Lycopodia were picked 
nearly in one spot.
Tofieldia palustris, Thalictrum alpinum and Malaxis paludosa 
occurred at the bottom of the cliffs, and Salix herbacea was found sparingly on the 
red sandstone below the summit cliffs of Ben Tarshan.
Opposite Applecross, in a bog 
which the tide could seldom reach, were picked specimens of Blysmus nifus two feet 
high.
Here there is an extent of limestone country â€”easily recognised at the distance 
of several miles by a marked improvement in the pasturage.
On it the party met 
with Schoenus nigricans, Gentiana Amarella, Listera ovata, and Epipactis latifolia 
with pale flowers, but searched in vain 'for Dryas octopetala, which occurred profusely 
in similar soils in Sutherland.
In an old deserted garden between Sheildag and Jane- 
town, they observed Althceaoflicinalis, Aconitum Napellusand other introduced plants.
They also saw near Janetown, Ulex europseus (a rare plant in the west of Ross-shire) 
growing freely and producing abundance of seed ; and the elder seemed to thrive pe- 
culiarly well 
Proceeding southward, the party enjoyed one fine day at Clunie, and examined 
with considerable attention some very promising mountains to the south-west of the 
inn.
These are crumbling and micaceous, but want elevation to produce alpine plants, 
and the mildness of the western climate renders that all the more necessary.
The on- 
ly interesting vegetable feature was an immense profusion of Saussurea alpina ; though 
in spring, before vegetation gets rank, it is not unlikely that these cliffs might be found 
more productive.
A patch of snow observed on the south side of Maamsool, a moun- 
tain about twenty miles north of Clunie, made the party desirous of visiting it ; but 
here again the weather baffled their intentions.
The party took Ben Nevis in their 
route, but the same cause rendered them unable to examine, as they wished, its mag- 
nificent cliffs.
They, however, picked some interesting plants, and among the rest 
Carex saxatilis, but only in one spot.
A letter to Professor Graham, from Mr. N.
B. Ward, F.L.S., on the introduction 
of the Musa Cavendisii into the Navigator Islands, was read : â€” 
"When Mr. Williams was about to leave England in 1839, for the Navigators, 
he was anxious to take with him some useful plants, and particularly the Musa.
He 
enquired of me whether I thought that it would travel safely in one of the glazed 
cases, and, having received an answer in the affirmative, he applied to his Grace the 
Duke of Devonshire, who kindly gave him a healthy young plant.
Mr. Williams left 
England on the 11th of April, 1839, and arrived at Upolu, one of the Navigator 
Islands, at the end of the following November.
The ]Musa bore this long voyage 
well, and was transplanted into a favourable situation soon after its arrival.
In May, 
1840, it bore a fine cluster of fruit, exceeding 300 in number and weighing nearly a 
cwt.
The parent plant then died, leaving behind more than thirty young ones.
â€” 
These were distributed to various parts of the island, and in the following May (1841) 
when Mrs. Williams left the island, all of these were in a fructiferous state, and pro- 
ducing numerous offsets.
Supposing the plants to continue to increase in the same 
ratio, there will be in the ensuing May (1843), more than 800,000 of tliem, and as the 
son of Mr. Williams is established as a merchant at Upolu, â€” is owner of two vessels 
constantly employed in trading between the various islands in the South Pacific, â€” and 
is moreover actuated by the same benevolent disposition which was a striking charac- 
teristic of his late father, there cannot be a doubt that in a very short time they will 
528 
be common in all the islands.
To estimate the importance of the introduction of this 
plant, we must bear in mind the great quantity of nutritious food furnished by the 
Banana.
Humboldt has told us that he was never wearied with astonishment at the 
smallness of the portion of soil which, in Mexico and the adjoining provinces, would 
yield sustenance to a family for a year ; and that the same extent of ground which, in 
wheat, would maintain only two persons, would yield sustenance under the Banana to 
fifty, although in that favoured region the return of wheat is never less than seventy, 
and is sometimes as much as a hundred fold.
The return on an average, in Great 
Britain, is not more than nine for one." 
Mr. Ralfs' paper on the Diatomaceae, No. III., was then read, containing descrip- 
tions of several genera.
On the Development of Leaves.
By Dr. Dickie, Lecturer on Botany, King's Col- 
lege, Aberdeen.
â€” The author concludes by stating â€” " that it cannot be said that the 
forms of leaves in flowering plants have any dependence whatever on their venation, 
since young leaves are lobed &c.
previous to the appearance of the veins.
The truth 
appears to be, that the quantity of cellular tissue in a leaf determines the development 
and positions of the veins, and not the opposite."

This species appears to be generally distributed : it occurs in all 
the county lists of ferns which T have received, and is rarely mention- 
ed either as local or uncommon.
In Ireland I found it particularly 
abundant, especially in the north : in the vicinity of the Giant's Cause- 
way I observed several large patches of ground densely covered with 
it.
I have not seen it in such profusion elsewhere.
The old figures usually quoted as representing this plant must be 
received with considerable doubt.
Those of Gerarde* and Lobel,t 
evidently printed from the same block, represent a plant growing in 
the water, and having one erect and unbranched stem, and another 
branched, and somewhat resembling the present species.
Ray's 
figure t represents a variety hereafter to be noticed.
The modem fi- 
gures of course more nearly resemble the plant.
Gerarde's description appears to comprehend more than one spe- 
cies.
" The great thicke jointed stalk " describing Eq. limosum of 
Smith, while the roughness and hardness seem inapplicable to that 
species.
I subjoin the passage as it stands in the herbal.
"Water 
Horse-taile, that growes by the brinks of riuers and running streams, 
and often in the middest of the water, hath a very long root accord- 
ing to the depth of the water, grosse thicke and jointed, with some 
threds anexed thereto : from which riseth vp a great thicke jointed 
stalk, whereon grow long rough rushy leaues pyramide or steeple fa- 
shion.
The whole plant is also rough hard and fit to shave and rub 
woodden things as the other." 
It is not however only in these ante-Linnean works that the syno- 
nymy of this and the following species is involved in obscurity.
Our 
modem authors, I regret to say, have hitherto done but little towards 
the elucidation of the nomenclature.
In the hope of making the sub- 
ject somewhat more clear, I have introduced some observations on the 
specimens in the Linnean herbarium.
Unfortunately, the Linnean 
characters are frequently obscure, owing to the constant endeavour 
of their celebrated author to make them as concise as possible : in such 
case a reference to the specimen becomes indispensable.
It is, I be- 
lieve, generally known, that the Linnean herbarium was purchased by 
Sir J.
E. Smith, and subsequently by the Linnean Society of London, 
in whose possession it now remains.
The specimens are fixed on 
half sheets of foolscap paper ; they are named by Linneus himself, in 
his own handwriting, and have also the comments of Sir J.
E. Smith

wherever it appeared to him necessary or useful to add an explanatory 
note.
A few labels with MS.
notes are pasted in, but I am not certain 
of their author.
The Equiseta are comprised in a fasciculus of nine 
folios: the fasciculus is endorsed thus, â€” " 1169, Equisetum," in the 
handwriting of Linneus.
In the same apartment are preserved the author's own copies of the 
first and second editions of the ' Species Plantarura.' In the first all 
the species possessed by the author are distinguished by a particular 
mark ; and the second is enriched with his own unpublished notes.
I 
will now endeavour to combine the information obtained from these 
several sources, only quoting the published characters when requisite, 
and adding remarks of ray own on every specimen.

â€” It is clear that Linneus trusts to Ray as the authority for 
this as a distinct species, since he quotes his figure,!
which evidently 
represents the unbranched form of Eq. limosum of Smith.
Hence it 
seems that Eq. fluviatile of Linneus is the branched, and Eq. limosum 
the unbranched forai of Eq. limosum of Smith ; and that Eq. fluviatile 
of Smith has no representative either in the herbarium or the works 
of Linneus.
With respect to the observation of Linneus quoted above, 
that Haller makes this species a variety of Equisetum palustre, I think 
the criticism is an unjust one.
Haller quotes Ray's figure 3, and, as 
it seems to me, correctly, as a variety of Eq. palustre ; while Linneus 
quotes Ray's figure 2, which is evidently the Eq. limosum of Smith.
A positive proof that the fluviatile of Linneus was not the fluviatile of 
Smith, exists in the fact that he attempted to account for its increased 
size and altered appearance by its growing from the bottom of deep 
water : this is the case with Smith's limosum, but never with his flu-

Linneus.
â€” Suec.
E. N.
â€” A single specimen of Equisetum variegatum of Smith, much 
more slender than the preceding : the Linnean MS.
evidently implies

I think the above notes will be sufficient to show that as regards 
several species of Equisetum, more especially the present, generally 
known as palustre, the Linnean herbarium is not a sure guide.
There 
is, however, much collateral evidence that Linneus was not only ac- 
quainted with the Equisetum palustre of modern authors, but that ho 
referred to that species when he named the plant in question ; for he 
expressly states that his fluviatile (Smith's limosum) may be a variety 
of palustre growing in deeper water.
Now as he was so well ac- 
quainted with fluviatile (Smith's limosum), and possessed such good 
specimens, his judgment cannot be supposed so much in fault as to 
have referred it to arveuse.
The eiTor must have arisen from a want 
of care in the selection of specimens for his herbarium.
Moreover, 
the name palustre is now too universally employed to admit of its be- 
ing changed, without a better reason than a discrepancy which may 
534 
have originated in carelessness.
The same is not the case with tluvi- 
atile : I am decidedly of opinion that the name in this instance must 
be changed ; and I make the proposition previously to publishing the 
species, in order that I may be favoured with the opinions of those 
botanists who think otherwise.
I propose restoring the Linnean name 
to the limosum of Smith, and sinking the name limosum to the rank 
of a variety ; thus : â€” 
Equisetumjluviatile, Linn.
= Equisetum limosum.
Smith.
â€ž â€ž &.
limosum, with the stem quite simple, = 
Equisetum limosum Linn.
The species hitherto called fluviatile is already so well provided 
with names that it is difficult to determine which to select.
It seems 
to be the Equisetum majus of Gerarde* and Ray,t the Eq. Telmateia 
of Ehrartt and Flora Danica,Â§ and the Eq. ebumeum of Roth.|| 
In a plant of which the synonymy is so imperfectly known as the 
marsh horse-tail, it is by no means an easy task to trace the record 
of medical and other properties.
Haller seems to have collected to- 
gether a number of wise saws from a variety of sources, and gives 
them under his Equisetum No. 1677 : but not only do I doubt whe- 
ther the whole of them were intended for any one species, but I also 
doubt whether his No. 1677 is the species now under consideration.
The point is not worth a very rigid scrutiny.
He makes out his No.
1677 to be hurtful to oxen and cows, giving them diarrhoea and mak- 
ing their teeth loose, but at the same time to be harmless to horses 
and sheep.
He also speaks of the great difficulty of extirpating it 
from a field where it is once naturalized : of its uses as a medicine he 
cannot speak with certainty.H 
The roots are slender and frequently divided ; they appear to spring 
from the joints of the rhizoma, and are generally covered with minute

fibrillae.
The rhizoma is creeping, and extends to a great length ; it 
is of nearly the same diameter as the stem, very black and shining, 
and smooth to the touch : at the joints it is solid, but the internodes 
are more or less hollow.
The engraving at the head of this article represents a stem of marsh 
horse-tail of the normal size and proportions : in order to exhibit the 
whole at one view, the stem has been divided into three portions.
â€” 
The stem is perfectly erect, about fifteen inches high, deeply farrowed 
and finely granulated : the furrows are eight in number, the granula- 
tions of the ridges between them feel rough to the edge of the nail if 
drawn along them.
The stem is divided into eleven compartments 
by means of transverse septa ; the internodes are an inch and a quar- 
ter or an inch and a half in length : the sheaths occur at the septa, 
and correspond in number ; they considerably exceed the stein in cir- 
cumference, and in consequence are loose : the ridges of the stem en- 
ter the sheaths and terminate in the teeth, which are eight in number, 
acute, wedge-shaped, tipped with black, and furnished with nearly 
transparent membranous edges.
There are nine whorls of branches: 
these rise from the furrows of the stem, close to the base of the 
sheaths ; they never exceed the furrows in number, and are frequently 
fewer ; at the base of each is a short black sheath, and these form a 
series of black rings round the stem : they are divided into six or 
eight joints, of which the basal and apical are the shortest : they have 
five furrows, and the sheaths occuning at the joints are five-toothed; 
the teeth are tipped with brown : the branches vary in length in the 
same whorl, and still more so in different whorls.
The catkin is long and rather naiTow ; when mature it stands on a 
distinct stalk of its own length : it is terminal, and after discharging 
its seeds it appears to perish, the stem and branches continuing to 
retain their vigour.
There is no apiculus, the extreme summit being 
composed of a scale similar to the rest: at first the scales are crowded 
together, forming a black mass, they afterwards separate, the peduncle 
supporting each becomes visible, and the catkin, increasing in length, 
assumes a brown colour.
The catkin appears in May and June.
This species, like the preceding, is subject to extraordinary varia- 
tions, the most striking of which I shall describe.

â€” Notes of a Solitary Ramble to Loch-na-gar Sj-c, with 
Remarks on several species of Plants collected in the course of 
it, on the \Uh of July, 1842.
By Mr. J.
B. Brichan.
Wearied with a walk of at least twenty miles, 1 arrived at Castle- 
ton of Braemar about 9 o'clock on the evening of Wednesday the 1 3th 
of July.
For several miles, further down the Dee, I had found the 
pretty alpine plant, Alchemilla alpina, in situations where neither river 
nor torrent could have carried it from its native bed.
In these situa- 
tions, therefore, it is strictly wild, but at what height above the sea I 
am unable to say.
This plant is found also within a iew miles of 
Aberdeen, where it has undoubtedly been washed down and planted 
by the river.
At half-past 7 the next morning I left Castleton, and proceeded in 
the direction of Loch Callader, which lies to the south-west of the 
"dark Loch-na-gar," and the vicinity of which has been visited and 
explored by botanists times and ways innumerable.
In my walk to 
this localitiy, to which one half of the road runs through Glen Calla- 
der, and through ground which is altogether highland, I met with no 
plants strictly alpine, except Alchemilla alpina, Oxyria reniformis, 
Saxifraga aizoides and S.
stellaris.
The sides of the road and ground 
adjacent were covered with hosts of plants, which, as they are, gene- 
rally speaking, found in all situations and at all elevations, I do not 
consider in any sense alpine.
Polygonum viviparum, for instance, I 
have frequently seen at almost no distance from the sea, and at hardly 
any height above its level.
Oxyria reniformis, Saxifraga aizoides, 
and, if 1 mistake not, Saxifraga stellaris also, are, like Alchemilla al- 
pina, found at a great distance from their natural habitats, by the side 
of the river already mentioned.
I believe the same is the case with 
respect to many other alpine productions, and with respect to every 
river that has its source among the hills.
When I had arrived at Loch Callader, and had learned from the 
occupant of the solitary abode at its northern extremity, the best way 
to Loch-na-gar, I proceeded along the western margin of the lake, 
where, as the same obliging individual informed me, most tveeds are 
to be found.
I was first struck with the minute leaves of Thalictrum 
alpinum growing among the stones and moss close to the water.
I 
saw them in great abundance almost to the head of the lake, but I 
could not detect more than half a dozen perfect plants, and these al- 
most entirely in fruit.
The beautiful Saxifraga oppositifolia next at- 
tracted my attention ; there were a good many tufts or patches of it, 
537 
but few specimens in flower.
It is said to flower in April and May, 
but I am quite satisfied that in this locality it was only coming into 
flower at the time I gathered it: and if I recollect rightly, a dried 
specimen which I received some years ago, was labelled as having 
been gathered in July.
Of Tofieldia palustris I got just two speci- 
mens, and of Juncus triglurais only a few.
The four plants just named 
I observed in no part of the ground I traversed, except along the mar- 
gin of Loch Callader ; but in that station I gathered also Saxifraga 
stellaris, the viviparous variety of Festuca ovina, and Apargia Tarax- 
acij now sunk into a variety of Apargia (or Oporinia) autumnalis.
The 
lake itself seems to contain very little that may interest the collector 
of " weeds." At its southern end, or head, I observed a few plants of 
Utricularia vulgaris, not then in flower.
1 may here digress so far as 
to remark, that this plant occurs, very sparingly, in several localities on 
Deeside ; and that in one locality at least, a moss in the parish of 
Banchory, U.
minor is abundant : neither of these plants, so far as I 
know, flowered last season.
To retuni to Glen Callader.
The end at 
which the lake lies presents some interesting botanical ground, which 
1 am sorry I had not time to visit.
It is surrounded by high rocks, 
the clefl;s of which contained at the time a few patches of snow.
My route now lay over the shoulder of a ridge that skirts the east 
side of Loch Callader, and here commenced my ascent from this inte- 
resting locality to the still more interesting mass of rock and moun- 
tain named Loch-na-gar.
Instead of at once chmbing the nearest 
height, I made a considerable circuit through a sort of hollow to the 
northward ; and, though for some time I could not see the top of the 
mountain, I felt pretty sure that I was gradually winding in the direc- 
tion of it.
In this zigzag ascent the fii'st plant of any interest that I 
met with was a solitary bush of Betula nana.
As it had neither flower 
nor fruit, and as I confidently expected to meet with more of it, I 
plucked but one specimen ; more, however, I did not find.
Lycopo- 
dium aimotinum occurred sparingly.
There was, as I have invariably 
observed in the alpine localities I have visited, abundance of liubus 
Chamgemorus not flowering, and only a patch here and there partly in 
flower and partly in fruit.
Imbedded in moss, which was saturated 
with the water of a pei-petual spring, and near perpetual snow, I pick- 
ed three specimens of a small plant, with a decumbent rooting stem 
and large blue flowers, and thought I had found the rare Veronica al- 
pina, on examination, however, it appears to be no more than the va- 
riety of V.
serpyllifolia which is termed humifusa ; I could not detect 
another specimen.
Dr. Murray, " without being certain " that this 
53$ 
plant is distinct fi'om V.
serpyllifolia, has given it as a distinct spe- 
cies, " as it is at least worthy of a place among a group whose mem- 
bers press closely upon one another." To me it certainly appears 
distinct, and, if I mistake not, the capsule is ovate, and longer than 
the stj^le.
Dr. Murray observes â€” " This is by no means a very alpine 
plant, being found at Banchory, little more elevated than the sea, and 
at Glentanner, not much above the common level of the district.
It 
is even met with in the neighbourhrod of Paris, in the Bois de Boii- 
logney This seems to confirm the idea that Veronica humifusa is a 
veritable species.
I have never seen it except where I found it on 
Loch-na-gar, at least 2000 feet above the sea.
In the same spot, and 
in other similar places, Epilobium alpinum, and especially a small va- 
riety of Saxifraga stellaris, abounded.
The latter scarcely exceeds 
an inch in height, but the plant, according to its elevation and expo- 
sure, grows to all intermediate sizes between one inch and eight.
I next proceeded up the course of a very small stream, which, for 
the length of at least one hundred feet, ran under an enormous mass 
of snow.
Near this, I picked a specimen or two of Sibbaldia pro- 
cumbens, which was plentiful, but not all in flower.
I was now, al- 
though I knew it not, on the very shoulder of Loch-na-gar, but had 
not succeeded in getting one glimpse of its top.
I therefore crossed 
that shoulder, and also the head of a glen which separates the moun- 
tain from another ridge, and made towards the top of the latter, which 
I had some idea was that of Loch-na-gar.
I thought, at all events, 
that by gaining the height before me I should be able to see where I 
was.
In ascending towards it I gathered Vaccinium uliginosum with- 
out either flowers or fruit ; I picked also a few specimens of Carex 
rigida.
I had by this time nearly reached the top of the ridge, when, 
after having several times turned to survey my ground, I had the plea- 
sure of seeing the indubitable peak, from which I had wandered, con- 
siderably to the noi'th of the height on which I stood, and which is 
termed Craig-dhuloch.
I saw moreover that I had actually been on 
the shoulder of Loch-na-gar, and had no difficulty in shaping out for 
myself a route to the top.
In order to accomplish my right ascension, 
I had of course both to descend and to retrace my steps.
In this re- 
trograde movement I first gathered some specimens of Luzula spicata, 
from eight to ten inches in height.
I lighted also upon a patch of 
a single-spiked Eriophorum, which I would fain have called E.
ca- 
pitatura, but have not been able to make it any other than the more 
common species, E.
vaginatum.
In reascending Loch-na-gar I ga- 
thered Gnaphalium sui^inum and Azalea procumbens, the latter, of 
539 
course, in fruit.
Before reaching the top I passed over a long mossy 
level, and again gathered Sibbaldia procumbens, which was here of 
larger size : Luzula spicata and Carex rigida abounded.
I tore up a 
few specimens of Salix herbacea, both male and female ; and also 
gathered Festuca vivipara, which ascends to the very summit of the 
mountain, and which, I may add, finds its way down the Dee as far 
as Banchory, seventeen miles from the sea.
My ascent ended on the 
top of the natural pile of huge stones that forms the peak.
I thought 
of rhyming â€” but I remembered that this was Byron's own " dark 
Loch-na-gar." Indeed, my thoughts on the subject, by a sort of in- 
genious anticipation, had occurred long before 1 ascended the moun- 
tain ; and when actually " at the utmost top," I was so occupied with 
sheltering myself from the wind, with taking care of my hat, with the 
contemplation of the prospect around me, and with the very interest- 
ing exercise of demolishing some eatables, â€” that I had at the moment 
far more reason than rhyme in my pate.
After seeing all I could see, I began to descend on the north side, 
which is excessively steep, and strewed with large blocks of stone.
Both at this time, and throughout the day, the wind blew with such 
violence, and in gusts so sudden, that I was frequently under the ne- 
cessity of throwing myself on the ground, to avoid being driven along 
rather faster than was agi-eeable.
I descended in a direction which 
brought me to the foot of the stupendous rocks which face the north.
My time did not permit me to examine this locality ; and although I 
scrambled round the end of the small lake that lies below, my path 
lying partly over sloping rocks, where a very small slip might have 
procured me a tolerable ducking, all I found was a variety of Melam- 
pyrum pratense with very pale yellow or white flowers, having the lip 
externally purple and the throat yellow.
It is now so black, that one 
can scarcely say whether it has flowers or not.
I ascended once more 
for a short distance in an easterly direction, crossed a low ridge over 
which I was partly blown by the wind, and then commenced my final 
descent towards the water of Muick, which I reached about 6 o'clock 
in the evening, at the distance of about two miles from the lake whence 
it issues.
The only other plant worth picking with which I met after 
1 was fairly away from Loch-na-gar, was a species of Hieracium which 
I take to be H.
Halleri.* My friend Mr. Adams informs me, that in 
ascending towards Loch-na-gar from the same locality to which I de- 
scended, Dr. Murray and himself gathered the species last named ; I 
* Apparently just coining into flower; it nearly corresponds with our own spe- 
cimens of this plant from Ben-na-bourde, collected in August, 1831.

could find but one specimen.
The rest of my walk was of no inte- 
rest to any one but myself, unless some good-natured sympathetic 
botanist should feel interested in the information that I continued my 
journey till half past 1 next morning, when I arrived, sadly way-worn, 
at the place whence I had started on the 13th.
The above, I fear, will be considered but a meager concern : ano- 
ther day, and a knowledge of the Cryptogamia, of which I am igno- 
rant, would have done much to render even my hasty excursion more 
interesting.
Morven, another mountain celebrated by Byron, which 
I visited in 1841, does not present so wide a field as Loch-na-gar; it 
possesses, however, considerable interest.
By the side of a small 
stream at its base I found the beautiful Sedum villosum, which I did 
not detect either on Loch-na-gar or in its vicinity.

â€” A List of Mosses and Hepaticce collected in Eskdale, 
Yorkshire.
By Richard Spruce, Esq.
York has been said by Mr. H.
C. Watson to be " pre-eminently the 
county of ferns;" and I think I may venture to assert that it is equal- 
ly unrivalled in its mosses and Hepaticse.
In proof of this I refer to 
the valuable list of mosses in Baines's ' Yorkshire Flora,' the result 
chiefly of the investigations of Messrs.
Gibson, Nowell, Howarth &c.
in a very small portion of the county.
Since Mr. Baines's work was 
published, several most interesting species have been discovered, and 
still a considerable part of the county remains unexplored.
Our dales, 
which afford a passage for a multitude of impetuous streams, are pe- 
culiarly prolific ; and I have assigned to myself the pleasing task of 
exploring them, in turn, as opportunity shall offer.
The vale of the 
Ksk, whose partial examination T have now to detail, terminates at 
Whitby, fifty-one miles N.E. of York; the river flows nearly due east, 
and receives during its course several smaller streams, issuing from a 
like number of dales.
The Whitby and Pickering railway enters Esk- 
dale at Grosmont Bridge ; and from hence to Whitby (six miles) the 
country is well wooded, and may be called romantic.
The course of 
the river forms a series of almost semicircular curves, now on the right 
now on the left of the railway, which crosses it I suppose ten times in 
that distance ; the south side of these curves is frequently a perpendi- 
cular cliff", rising directly from the water's edge to a height of from 30 
to 150 feet ; and having a northern exposure, is richly clad with mosses 
541 
and Hepaticae.
These cliffs arc farther interesting from being in tlie 
line of the remarkable fault which extends from Whitby Harbour to 
the j)lain of Cleveland ; Dr. Young, in the ' Geology of the Yoi'kshire 
Coast,' has estimated the amount of dislocation to be about 100 feet 
at the mouth of the Esk, and in some places it is probably more.
The 
fonnation is the inferior oolite, and consists of beds of alum shale* al- 
ternating with ironstone and sandstone.
Goadland beck (or the Mirk 
Esk) joins the Esk just above Grosmont bridge, and Lythe beck (the 
sweetest spot in the whole district) runs into Goadland beck about 
half a mile higher up.
These two becks are crossed by the great ba- 
saltic dyke ; but it scarcely rises above the surface, and does not ap- 
pear to produce any peculiar plants.
I devoted two days (the 30th and 31st of December, 1842) to the 
examination of the banks of the Esk and its tributaries above men- 
tioned.
On the morning of my third and (as it proved) last day's 
botanizing, I proceeded per railway to Fen End, an extensive peat- 
moss twelve miles west of Whitby, where Goadland beck has its 
som"ce;t here I encountered a snow-storm, and although I persevered 
in examining the rocks on the south side of Newtondale (great oolite) 
until they, as well as myself, were clad in white, 1 was eventually 
compelled to desist.
I regretted the necessity of this the more, as I 
had planned out work for other five or six days ; perhaps its comple- 
tion is a treat yet to come.
Note.
â€” I have not annexed the localities to those species which 
occurred in every spot I visited, and which are generally distributed 
throughout the county.
Gymnostomum truncatulum.
curvirostrmn.
Newtondale ; barren.
I gathered a luoss on wet rocks 
by the Esk, almost intermediate in size and appearance between this species and 
Anictangium Hornschuchianum.
I saw the same plant last summer in Dr. Tay- 
lor's herbarium, under the MS.
name of G.
nimbosiim ; he has long known it oil 
Mount Mangerton, but has never met with fruit Mr. Ibbotson finds it on Pen- 
nyghent, and Mr. Nowell in Todmorden, but always barren.
In a dried state 
the leaves are remarkably brittle, so that on opening a package of it, I always 
find numbers of them broken off and strewed about.
Telraphis pellucida.
Lythe beck.
Bronmiana.
Newtondale ; with old fruit.
* The alum-works near Whitby have been celebrated for centuries, and at Gros- 
mont great quantities of iron ore are got up and sent to Newcastle to be smelted at the 
founderies.
f Another stream rises in this bog, which, altliongh it eventually reaches the same 
sea, runs in an opposite direction.

Two or three varieties.
Tortula muralis, ruralis, suhulata and unguiculata.
Polytrichum undulatum, commune, aloides and nanum, and Funaria hygrometrica .
Orthotrichum affine, striatum and crispum.
Bi-yum albicans.
Frequent on wet rocks by the Esk ; barren.
This plant is remark- 
ably fragile; two or three times I thrust my stick into the broad flakes above my 
head, hoping to procure a patch entire, but I only brought down a shower of 
mutilated stems around me.

Marchantia conica and Jungermannia asplenioides.
Jungermannia lancenlata, L.
On wet rocks by the Esk, and with calyces on stones in 
513 
Lythe heck.
The existence of this plant in Britain was foimerly donhted ; Sir 
W. J.
Hooker says â€” " I have never seen British specimens ; and I suspect the 
authors just named (Hudson, Withering, &c.) may have mistaken some other 
species for it ; " (see Brit.
Jung, and Eng. Flor.) I helieve its claim to a place 
in our Flora was satisfactorily established a few years ago by Mr. Jenner, who 
found it at Tonbridge Wells.
Its closest affinity may be with J.
pumila, but in 
my deliberate opinion J.
polyanthos is the species for which it is most likely to 
be passed over; I found the two plants growing intermixed, and certainly differ- 
ing very little in size and general appearance.
In J.
lanceolata the stems are 
procumbent, and copiously furnished with strong radicles on their under side.
The leaves are horizontal, but slightly deflexed (except the two or three terminal 
ones, which are vertically folded together, as we sometimes see the leaflets in le- 
guminous plants), longer than broad by about one half, and of nearly equal 
breadth from the base to near the summit, where they are rounded ofi", or rarely 
somewhat retuse ; their colour brownish.
The calyx is terminal, one third longer 
than the perichaetial leaves, curved upwards, subcylindrical, broadest at the sum- 
mit, where it is remarkably depressed, with a very minute slightly elevated mouth.
Jung, polyanthos is altogether of a greener hue ; the stem is more slender ; the 
leaves mostly shorter, still more quadrate in their form, and often emarginate, 
the reticulation is also closer.
Besides these marks of distinction, there are the 
more important ones of the presence of stipules (though unusually small in pro- 
portion to the leaves), and the curious two-lipped calyx with its much exserted 
calyptra, which will always suffice to keep this species far apart from J.
lanceo- 
lata.
The plant mentioned in my list of Wharfedale mosses (Phytol, 197) as an 
entire-leaved variety of J.
aspleuioides,* is not unlike J.
lanceolata in appear- 
ance, but the calyx is totally different.
Jun{jermannia riparia, Taylor, MS.
On wet rocks by the Esk; with calyces.
This 
species, which has very lately been distinguished by Dr. Taylor, was first de- 
tected by him at the Dargle, Co. Wicklow ; and I had the pleasure of gathering 
it in his company last July, at Blackwater Bridge, Co. Kerry.
It is inteniie- 
diate in size between J.
cordifolia and J.
pumila, and has some points of resem- 
blance to each, but difi'ers from both in its obovate very obtuse calyx.
I have 
gathered it in two other Yorkshire stations, namely, Wharfedale and Crambeck 
on the Derwent, and Mr. Nowell sends it from Todmorden.
" sphcerocaiya.
Abundant, but sparingly in fruit.
I observe that the 
young calyx has a short tubular mouth, without any trace of teeth.
hyalina.
Equally common with the last, and growing intermixed with 
it, but distinguished by its larger size and purplish tinge, by the broader and 
more wavy leaves, by the vertically compressed and angulate calyx, and, above 
all, by the perichaetial leaves growing upon, or adhering to, the calyx.
emarginata.
Eskdale and Newtondale.
I found a few capsuliferous 
specimens.
inflata and excisa.
With calyces on Egton moors.
A small variety of 
the latter in Newtondale, with nearly all the leaves trifid.
bicuspidata, nemorosa and albicans.
With calyces.
umbrosa.
Newtondale and woods round Grosmont bridge.
This beau- 
* Mr. Wilson considers this to be a distinct and undescribed species.
544 
tiful and rare species might easily be overlooked as a young state of J.
neniorosa, 
from which it is, however, truly distinct.
J nngermannia cnmplanata and scalaris.
In fruit.
polyanthos.
By the Esk and Lythe beck ; with calyces.
Trichomanis and bidentata.
reptans &c platypliylla.
A solitary tuft of each observed in Newtondale 
laxifolia & trichophylla.
Near the waterfall in Goadland beck ; calyces 
â€” dilatata, Tamarisci, pinyuis, epiphylla and furcata.
Lyellii P Near the waterfall in Goadland beck, growing upon Hyp- 
num commutatum.
This approaches nearest to the variety called J.
hiberuica 
by Hooker, but is above twice the size of any specimens in my possession under 
either name, and the perichaetium (or outer calyx) is longer, with repeatedly la- 
ciniated segments.
I found plenty of pistilla but no fruit, the season being too 
early.
A remarkable circumstance in the cryptogamic Flora of Eskdale is 
the total absence of the geneva Neckera and Anomodon ; whereas in 
other districts of similar appearance, but at a distance from the east- 
ern coast, such as Wharfedale, Castle Howard, &c., I have found the 
two species of Anomodon and two of Neckera (N.
puraila and crispa) 
distributed in tolerable plenty; and the abundance of N.
viticulosum 
is generally characteristic.
Jungermannia reptans and platyphylla 
also, plants which are usually so abundant in rocky situations, do not 
appear to exist in Eskdale ; their sparing occurrence in Newtondale 
has been remarked above, but this is fourteen miles from the sea, and 
belongs to another system of drainage.

â€” Remarks on the threatened extermination of rare 
Plants hy the rapacity of Collectors.
By S.
H. Haslam, Esq.
Milnthorpe, Westmoreland, 
March 7th, 1843.
" Fortunati ambo, si quid mea carmina possunt." 
Sir, 
I HAILED the first appearance of ' The Phytologist ' with 
pleasure, as I thought it promised to supply a desideratum much 
wanted in our scientific periodicals, and would afford to many a plod- 
ding botanist, as yet "unknown to fame," an opportunity of recording 
his observations in a less formidable manner than by drawing atten- 
tion to himself in a publication of higher pretensions, if, indeed, he 
had the chance of seeing such a book at all.
I dare say there are few 
545 
of us who have not within the range of our acquaintance some one or 
other, the result of whose labours we have often wished could be made 
available for the general good, but whose habits of retirement, or, it 
may be, the " res angusta domi," had always kept in the back ground.
Now, your useful little publication seems just adapted for the very 
purposes 1 allude to, and I think I am justified in saying, that the ex- 
pectations of both editor and contributor must have been very fairly 
realized; and I am glad to think that the pages of 'The Phytologist' 
have recorded many valuable hints, and put your readers in posses- 
sion of much pleasing information respecting Botany and botanists.
Having premised thus much, let me draw your attention to another 
part of the subject, less gratifying indeed (for every medal has its re- 
verse), but which I trust you will see in the same light as myself; and 
as * The Phytologist ' is the avowed organ of enlightened science and 
practical Botany, permit me, through the medium of its pages, to 
awaken a sympathetic feeling in favour of those very treasures that 
are the objects of our favourite pursuit.
And let me, ere the botaniz- 
ing season has commenced, impress upon the minds of collectors the 
desirableness of forbearance and moderation, when culling specimens 
for their herbaria, â€” particularly amongst what are rapidly becoming 
the "plantas rariores" of our island.
I frequently caution brother bo- 
tanists on this head, and seldom get more than a smile in return.
But 
if the legitimate end of Botany be a more intimate acquaintance with 
plants in a growing state ; and if it be more delightful to feast our eyes 
on these gems of the earth in the garden of Nature, than to handle a 
dry and often disfigured specimen in the herbarium of a botanist ; â€” 
surely it is a matter of grave moment, that the war of extermination 
which has lately been waged against our best and rarest plants, should 
at length be put an end to.
Some of your readers may perhaps say that 1 am fighting with a 
shadow, or that my own alarms have pictured an exaggerated state of 
things ; but when I see a recently-formed Society, determined, I sup- 
pose, to outstrip all others in the work of extermination, putting forth 
a list, including some of the rarest of our indigenous plants, and de- 
siring its contributors to send no more of them, as there are enough on 
hand to distribute for several years ; â€” can it be said that my fears are 
altogether groundless ?
What pretty picking there must have been, 
to amass such a lot of treasures !
And the machinery by which such 
a system is kept alive, is not less alarming.
Tradesmen, who cannot 
devote the time to it themselves, or else are verily ashamed of being 
caught at it â€” " pal mam qui meruit ferat" â€” send forth their apprenti-

ces to dig up every specimen they can find, of certain rare plants in 
their locality, and these are bundled off until the market is actually 
glutted.
Yet more startling facts 1 could adduce, but I trust that I have said 
enough to awaken attention to the subject.
What can be more pain- 
iiil to the true and ardent lover of Botany, than to find those spots 
where Nature has, as it were, secreted her choicest gems, visited only 
for the purposes of plunder and filthy lucre ?
I could name many 
plants that, not long ago, were plentiful in this neighbourhood, but 
which, since the establishment of railroads and learned Societies, have 
become nearly extinct.
The interests of science surely do not require 
such barbarous work, and her legitimate sons, I am equally certain, 
would not sanction it.
I think I may venture to assert, without fear of contradiction, that 
no small portion of the pleasure arising from botanical pursuits, con- 
sists in the toil and enthusiasm of a botanical ramble ; and those spe- 
cimens are most highly prized that have cost us most personal exer- 
tion to obtain.
But it is no uncommon thing, now-a-days, to see a 
collection made up entirely of " contributions from friends ; " and by 
the system I am complaining of, a herbarium may be made up " on 
the shortest notice," and without costing its possessor one hour's fa- 
tigue in the way of genuine Botany.
All this may be well enough, if 
confined to the commoner plants, but I really regret to see our darling 
science degraded into a mere handmaid of " commerce and trade," 
with the additional mortification of knowing that, one by one, our 
rarest plants are disappearing fi-om their long-recorded habitats : â€” 
" Oh infelix operis summa !
" 
Hoping that these remarks may be taken in good part by all the 
real friends of Botany, 
I remain, Mr. Editor,

â€” Observations on the publication of Local Lists of 
Plants.
By Edwin Lankester, Esq., M.D., F.L.S.
& B.S.Ed, 
In prosecuting the subject of the distribution of plants, it is exceed- 
ingly desirable that correct lists of the species that grow even in small 
districts should be obtained.
The value of lists of plants from small 
547 
rlistiicts iiiusl, however, be always proportioned to the variety of soil, 
elevation, climate, &c., which the district may possess.
Thus a list 
of plants from a small district of level or swampy ground, would not 
furnish so much valuable matter as a list from a smaller district where 
streams or hills produced a difference in the dryness and constitution 
of the soil.
Take for example the neighbourhood of Askern, a small 
district of Yorkshire, the centre of which is seated in about the mid- 
dle portion of the great escarpment of magnesian limestone, which 
runs through the counties of Nottingham, York and Durham.
Its ex- 
tent is about four miles east and west, and two miles north and south.
To the east, the magnesian limestone dips under the new red sand- 
stone, which is covered in this district by an immense swamp.
Di- 
rectly through the district, in a south-easterly direction, runs the river 
Went, making its way along a picturesque valley, which passes at 
right angles through the magnesian limestone formation.
The river 
is here about thirty feet above the level of the sea, and the highest 
hills above its banks are about thi*ee hundred and eighty feet.
The 
villages of Campsall, Burghwallis and Smeaton are seated entirely 
on the magnesian limestone, whilst Sutton, Askern and Norton in- 
clude some of the marshy districts lying above the new red sandstone.
In publishing lists of plants of particular districts, botanists have 
for a long time felt the inconvenience of going over a number of the 
names of plants which are common to almost all districts ; and yet, as 
no rule has been offered which would answer generally for the exclu- 
sion of common plants, all plants must be included in lists of any value.
In drawing up a Flora for my ' Account of Askern,' * I have en- 
deavoured to obviate this difficulty ; and I am not without hope that 
the idea acted on may be found generally applicable, at least to Great 
Britain, and that it will lead to the more general publication of local 
Floras, which will supply material for the perfecting our knowledge 
of the geographical distribution of plants.
In the Flora alluded to I have distributed the plants in four tables.
In the first table is a numerical statement of the genera and species of 
each natural order.
From this it will be seen that there are 428 spe- 
cies of phanerogamic plants, belonging to 212 genera and 78 natural

Natnral History, and a Brief Topography of the Immediate Neighbourhood.

containing much information relative to the Antiquities, Topography and Natural His- 
tory of Askern and the surrounding district.

families.
The second table contains a list of the plants that more 
particularly distinguish the district.
In drawing up this table, those 
species have been selected that are admitted into Mr. Watson's ' New- 
Botanist's Guide,' which contains only the plants found not to be 
common to eight out of twelve local Floras of Great Britain.
I have 
followed Mr. Watson in this respect, not because I think his list the 
best that could be constructed, but because his book is very generally 
known to botanists in this country.
Since the publication of Mr.
Watson's book, other Floras have been published, and materials fiir- 
nished for a more correct list of common plants than he has given ; 
and I would suggest that it might be worth the while of some of our 
botanical societies to construct a list, which, by excluding common 
plants, would enable the botanist to publish only the peculiar and 
most interesting forms.
But these two tables, even with Mr. Watson^s 
Guide and a British Flora, would give only an incomplete view of the 
Flora of a particular district, since many of the common as well as of 
the rarer plants might be absent from it.
In order to meet this defect, 
I have constructed a third table, including the plants which were com- 
mon to the twelve counties examined by Mr. Watson, but which I did 
not find near Askern.
In the present case I believe this table to be 
somewhat imperfect, but I have mentioned it in order to show the 
manner in which my plan may be carried out.
With these three ta- 
bles, a list of British plants, and Mr. Watson's Guide, we have the 
elements of a complete Flora of a district.
There is, however, one point in which such a Flora would be defec- 
tive, and that is the comparative rarity or frequency of the excluded 
common plants.
This is, however, always a difficult point to estimate, 
and little has hitherto been done towards enabling us to compute, with 
any proximity to the truth, the number of individual plants growing 
in a district.
In my fourth table, by way of meeting in some measure 
this inconvenience, I have added the names of a few plants which are 
rare in the Askern district, but which are excluded as common from 
Mr. Watson s list.
Edwin Lankester.
19, Golden Square, 
January, 1843.
[We are greatly obliged to Dr. Lantester for his valuable suggestions ; tbe adop- 
tion of his plan would, however, involve the necessity of printing at least four lists in- 
stead of one for every district illustrated.
The subject of publishing local lists of plants 
is one which has often had our serious consideration.
For various reasons we have 
hitherto preferred printing them exactly as received from the contributors, to whom 
our thanks are due for the pains they have taken to render their lists correct and com- 
549 
plete.
The following considerations have had great weight in inducing us to puhlish 
these lists without mutilation.
Botanists confessedly require more exact information 
than they at present posesss, on many points relating to the general distribution of 
plants, common as well as rare.
In all matters connected with this subject, we know 
of no botanist whose opinions are more worthy of regard than those of Mr. Watson ; 
and that gentleman, at no very distant period, has well observed, that owing to the 
want of sufficient data we are as yet unable to say with certainty, that even such com- 
mon and widely spread plants as the daisy and the dandelion are to be found in every 
county of the United Kingdom.
Such data it is the province of local lists to supply, 
and we would have them include the name of every species growing in the district to 
which they refer.
For our own part we can truly say, that if carefully drawn up, and 
more especially if they contain short remarks on any interesting circumstances connect- 
ed with the species, our only objection to these lists arises from the fear that some of 
our subscribers may think that their place would be better occupied by matter more 
generally readable.
We shall be glad to receive communications on this subject; but 
until some better plan be determined on, we trust we shall be excused if we "e'en gang 
our ain gate," printing the lists of flowering plants, mosses, &c.
entire, and in future 
transferring localities of ferns to Mr. Newman, for publication in his county lists.

â€” Notice of A Visit to the Australian Colonies.
By 
James Backhouse.' London : Hamilton, Adams Â«& Co. 1843.
To a considerable number of our readers it is well known that the 
author of this work is a member of the Society of Friends, and that 
his visit to the Australian colonies was undertaken " for the purpose 
of discharging a religious duty." But our notice of this narrative will 
be confined to that part of it which is strict accordance with the de- 
sign of ' The Phytologist,' namely, the author's observations on the 
vegetable productions of these colonies ; and we trust that we shall 
be able to show that James Backhouse is an observant and accom- 
plished botanist.
To many of our readers who are acquainted with 
this excellent man, his profound botanical knowledge is already well 
known ; still, even to these, our remarks may not be unacceptable, 
since they will collect, and somewhat condense, observations on this 
interesting science, which are scattered through a volume of 560 
pages.
The visit " occupied a period of six years, terminating with 
1838." We shall divide our notice into three parts : â€” Van Diemen's 
Land, Norfolk Island and New South Wales.
Van Diemen's Land.
â€” As far as Botany is concerned the nan-ative 
commences at Hobart Town, where the author landed in February, 1 832, 
and our first botanical sketch is of a hill near that town.
This hill â€” 
"Was clothed with gum trees â€” species of Eucalyptus â€” of large size, having foli- 
age somewhat like willows, and growing among grass and small shrubs.
Many trees 
550 
were lying on the ground, and in various stages of decay.
Smaller trees, called here 
honeysuckle, she oak, cherry-tree, and wattle, were interspersed among the others, and 
the ground was decorated with lieptospermum scoparium, Corra;a virens, Indigofera 
australis, and Epacris impressa ; the last of which resembles heath, with white, pink, 
or crimson flowers.
The trees in this country often bear the name of others belonging 
to the northern heinisi)here.
Thus the honeysuckle of the Australian regions is gene- 
rally some species of Banksia, often resembling a fir in growth, but having foliage more 
like a holly ; and the cherry-tree is an Exocarpos â€” a leafless, green, cypress-like bush, 
with small red or white fruit, bearing the stone outside !
'' â€” p.
22.
Speaking of introduced plaiits the author observes that the climate 
at Hobart town is too cold for grapes and cucumbers, but that apples, 
pears, quinces, mulberries and walnuts succeed better than in 
England.
On the basaltic hills about Hamilton, the prevailing 
tree is the oak â€” Casuarina quadrivalvis.
" It seldom grows in 
contact: its trunk is about 10 feet high and 5 feet round; its head is 
spherical, and 10 or 15 feet in diameter, and consisting of pendulous, 
leafless, green, jointed twigs, resembling horse-tail weed." At Mount 
Wellington, Acacia Oxycedrus, 10 feet high, was in flower.
" This, 
along with numerous shrubs of other kinds, formed impervious thick- 
ets in some places, while, in others, Epacris impressa displayed its 
brilliant blossoms of crimson and rose-colour." We pass on to the de- 
scription of a fern valley, which is almost enough to make a botanist 
emigrate to this distant land.
In the plate accompanying this sketch 
the author is seen crossing the stream on the trunk of a fallen Euca- 
lyptus ; how we long to be his companion !
Loddiges and Ward, 
what would you not give to realize such a scene !
"The brook that supplies Hobart Town with water, flows from Mount Wellington 
through a valley at the foot of the mountain.
Here the bed of the brook is rocky, and 
so nearly flat as scarcely to deserve the name of The Cascades, by which this place is 
called.
Many dead trees and branches lie across the brook, by the sides of which 
grows Drymophila cyanocarpa â€” a plant allied to Solomon's seal, producing sky-blue 
berries on an elegantly three-branched nodding top.
Diauella caerulea â€” a sedgy plant 
â€” flourishes on the drier slopes: this, as well as Billardiera longiflora â€” a climbing 
shrub, that entwines itself among the bushes â€” was now exhibiting its violet-coloured 
fruit.
In damp places by the side of the brook, a princely tree-fern, Cybotium Billar- 
dieri, emerged through the surrounding foliage.
A multitude of other ferns, of large 
and small size, enriched the rocky margins of the stream, which I crossed upon the 
trunk of one of the prostrate giants of the forest, a gum-tree of large dimensions, which 
had been uprooted by some blast from the mountain ; and in its fall had subdued ma- 
ny of the neighbouring bushes, and made a way where otherwise the forest would have 
been inaccessible.
On descending from this natural bridge, to examine a tree-fern, I 
found myself at the foot of one of their trunks, which was about five leet in circumfe- 
rence and ten feet in height.
The lower part was a mass of protruding roots, and the 
upper part clothed with short remains of loaf-stalks, looking rough and blackened : 
this was surmounted by dead leaves hanging down, and nearly obscuring the trunk 
551 
from distant view : above was the noble crest of fronds, or leaves, resembling those of 
Aspleuium Filix-fajmina in form, but exceeding eleven feet in length, in various de- 
grees of inclination between erect and horizontal, and of the tenderest greeiT, rendered 
more delicate by the contrast with the dark verdure of the surrounding foliage.
At 
my feet were several other ferns of large size, covering the ground, and which, through 
age and their favourable situation, had attained root- stocks a foot in height, crowned 
by circles of leaves three times that length.
Other plants of tree-fern, at short distan- 
ces, concealed from my view, by their spreading fronds, the foliage of the lofty ever- 
greens that towered a hundred feet above them.
The trunk of one of the tree-ferns 
was clothed with a Trichomanes and several species of Hymenophyllum â€” small mem- 
branaceous ferns of great delicacy and beauty.
On a rocky bank adjoining, there were 
other ferns, with creeping roots, that threw up their bright green fronds at short dis- 
tances from each other, decorating the ledges on which they grew.
In the deepest 
recesses of this shade I could enjoy the novel scene â€” ferns above, below, around â€” ^\ith- 
out fear of molestation; no dangerous beasts of prey inhabiting this interesting island." 
â€”p.
34.
On leaving Hobait Town the author sailed to Port Davey, and 
thence to Macquarie Harbour, where he describes the timber as being 
very fine.
The Huon pine, valuable for ship-building &c., abounds 
on the eastern side ; it attains a height of 100 feet, and a circumfer- 
ence of 25 feet; it has a pyramidal shape, and the branches are clothed 
with numerous slender scaly branchlets of lively green, as in the 
cypress and arbor vitae.
The celery-topped pine â€” Thalamia asple- 
nifolia â€” is suitable for masts ; myrtle for keels ; and the roots of 
light- wood â€” Acacia Melanoxylon â€” make beautiful veneers.
This 
latter wood derives its name from swimming in the water, the other 
woods, pine excepted, generally sink.
Hats are made of the sha- 
vings of some Acacias, " as well as from broad-leaved sedges â€” Le- 
pidosperma gladiata ; the leaves being first boiled and bleached," At 
Philips Island, in the same vicinity, we have another peep at the tree 
ferns.
" The huts were almost overgrown with the Macquarie Harbour vine, a luxuriant 
climber, bearing small acid frnit.
We walked over the island, and down one of its 
sides, which was woody, and which exhibited the finest tree-ferns we had seen, and in 
great profusion.
They were of two kinds, one of which we did not meet with else- 
where.
Some of their larger fronds or leaves were thirteen feet long, making the dia- 
meter of the crest twenty-six feet.
The stems were of all degrees of elevation, up to 
twenty-five or thirty feet; some of them, at the lower part, were as stout as a man's 
body : those of Cybotium Billardieri were covered with roots to the outside: the whole 
length of those of the other species â€” Alsophila australis â€” was clothed with the bases 
of old leaves, which were rough, like the stems of raspberries, closely tiled over each 
other, and pointing upwards.
There was also a number of other ferns, of humble 
growth : two species of the beautiful g nus Gleichenia had tough, wiry stems, which 
were used in the settlement for making bird-ca^es.'' â€” p.
55.
552 
At Macquavie Harbour and Port Davey a species of Blandfordia 
was observed, a lily-like plant, with a crest of scarlet tubular flowers : 
and on the hills near the former place, was a lichen of a texture re- 
sembling net-work ; this, " in the abundant rain, was distended into 
masses resembling cauliflowers." " In some places cyperaceous 
plants entwine themselves among the larger shrubs and ascend to their 
tops, and lichens hang to a great length from the boughs of some of 
the trees." 
Returning by sea to Hobart Town, our author made an excursion 
on the opposite side of the river to that on which the town stands: he 
notices the appearance of Anguillaria dioica, a little, purple-spotted, 
white-blossomed, bulbous plant, which was decorating a sunny bank 
as one of the first harbingers of spring, (August 27th) ; and also com- 
ments on the strange appearance of trees in full foliage laden with 
snow.
It is, we presume, generally known, that the trees of Australia 
may nearly all be regarded as a kind of evergreens, although not so 
strictly entitled to that name as those so commonly cultivated in our 
English gardens.
On the 26th of September J.
Backhouse sailed for Flinder's Island, 
of which he records nothing botanical that is particularly worthy of 
notice.
On the 20th of October he reached George Town, on the 
main land of Tasmania; on the 30th Circular Head, and on the 31st 
Woolnorth.
The seaweeds of this shore are of prodigious magnitude ; 
one, " a palmate species, has a stem thicker than a man's arm, and 
proportionately long.
The flat portion between the stem and the rib- 
bon-like appendages is so large as to be converted by the blacks into 
vessels for carrying water.
For this purpose they either open an ob- 
long piece so as to form a flat bag, or run a string through holes in 
a circular piece, so as to form a round one." Returning to Circular 
Head he proceeded thence by land to Emu Bay, noticing by the 
way the grass-trees, to which we shall again recur, and a beautiful 
Blandfordia, whose stems were eighteen inches high, and supported 
crests of from ten to twenty pendulous red blossoms, margined with 
yellow, an inch and a half long, and three quarters of an inch wide at 
the mouth.
On some of the hills Banksia serrifolia was the prevailing- 
tree ; " it is equal to a pear-tree in size, has leaves three or four inches 
long and five-eighths broad, and strongly toothed : its heads of flow- 
ers are six inches long and twelve round, and the seeds are as large 
as almonds." After a short rest at Emu Bay, â€” 
" We set out for the Hampshire Hills, distant 20^ miles, through one of the most 
magnificent of forests.
For a few miks from the sea, it consists chiefly of white gum 
653 
and stringy-bark, of about 200 feet in height, with straight trunks, clear of branches 
for from 100 to 150 feet; and resembling an assemblage of elegant columns, so irre- 
gularly placed as to intercept the view at the distance of a few hundred yards.
These 
are elegantly crowned with branching tops of light willow-like foliage, but at an ele- 
vation too great to allow the form of the leaves to be distinguished, yet throwing a 
gentle shade on the ground below, which is covered with splendid tree-ferns and large 
shnibs, and carpeted with smaller ferns.
Some of the larger stringy-barks exceed 200 
feet, and rise nearly as high as ' the monument ' before branching.
Their trunks also 
will bear a comparison with that stately column, both in circumference and straight- 
ness.
The bark of these trees is brown and cracked: that of the white-gums is French 
grey, and smooth.
" The prostrate trunks of these sylvan giants, in various stages of decay, add great- 
ly to the interest of the scene.
Some of them, lately fallen, have vast masses of the 
rich red earth in which they grew, still clinging to their roots ; others, that have been 
in a state of decay before they fell, present singular ruins of shattered limbs and bro- 
ken boughs ; others, that seem to have been in a state of decomposition for ages, have 
become overgrown with various ferns and shrubs.
"As the distance from the sea increases, the Australian myrtle and sassafras, of 
dark dense foliage, become the prevailing trees.
In these denser forests, tree-ferns 
form nearly the sole undergrowth, except the small, starry ferns, of low stature, of the 
genus Lomaria, that cover the ground thinly.
Some of the tree-ferus have trunks 20 
feet high.
Their leaves are from 8 to 12 feet long, and the new ones, now fonning, 
rise in the centre like elegant crosiers.'' â€” p.

Note oji the occurrence of Cusciita Epilinum and Saponaria 
Vaccaria in Morayshire.
In July, 1842, Mr. Wilson of Alves detect 
ed these two plants in a field of flax, in the parish of Alves, Moray- 
shire, along with Camelina sativa.
Mr. Babington's remark (Phytol.
250) that C.
Epilinum does not make its appearance among flax 
raised fi-om American and Riga seed, led me to enquire whence the 
seed in the present case was imported.
I am informed that all the 
flax-seed used in this district is procured either fi-om America or Hol- 
land ; that those who are in the habit of using both, can distinguish 
American seed firom Dutch by the rounder shape of the former ; and 
that the seed respecting which I made the enquiry, was the remains 
of a cargo which had been cleared out at London, was obtained from 
the vessel on its arrival at Burghead (a small port on the Moray Frith), 
and was considered to be American on the ground just mentioned.

Note on a supposed new British ^cidium.
Last August I 
found at this place a species of ^cidium, which is not noticed in 
3c' 
654 
Hooker's 'English Flora,' our text-book for British cryptogamous Bo- 
tany.
On referring to Gray's Natural Arrangement, T found the de- 
scription of an ^Ecidium that in some respects answers to mine, of 
which 1 could secure but three specimens, as the season for it appear- 
ed to be nearly over.
The following is Gray's description.

Note on the Fniit of UmbellifercB.
Before I close my note I 
wash to make a remark on the discussion in your journal concerning 
the poisonous properties of the seeds of Umbelliferge.
Lindley's state- 
ment is copied from DeCandolle's Essay on the Medical Properties of 
Plants, and DeCandolle is certainly in error.
T think the most accu- 
rate view on this subject is, that those seeds in which vittse are pre- 
sent are innocuous, while those which have no vittae are either suspi- 
cious or poisonous.
In the former, the proper juice of the plant is 
converted into volatile oil ; in the latter, it is merely deposited in a 
more concentrated form.

Note on Gigartina compressa.
My attention having been di- 
rected to some remarks on the Jusna or Ceylon moss, by M.
Guibourt 
of Paris (Provincial Medical Journal for February, 1843, No. 128), I 
am induced to trouble you with some observations made by me on 
this plant many years since, when it occurred in considerable abun- 
dance at Sidmouth, as they agree so entirely with those of M.
Gui- 
bourt, that there can be no doubt of their identity.
The species in 
question is the Fucus lichenoides of Turner, described and figured in 
his ' Historia Fucorum,' ii.
124, t, 118; the Gracilaria lichenoides of 
Greville's ' Cryptogamic Flora,' p.
125, from specimens and a drawing 
of the recent plant, communicated by me from Sidmouth, Fucus li- 
chenoides of Linn.
&c.
Subsequently, finding it agree with Sphsero- 
coccus compressus of Agardh, and that the term lichenoides was 
preoccupied and inappropi'iate.
Dr. Greville named it Gracilaria com- 
pressa in his ' British Alga3 ; ' and it is now Gigartina compressa of 
Hooker's 'British Flora,' 299, Harvey's 'Manual of British Algae,' 74, 
555 
and Wyatt's 'Algse Danmonienses,' iii.
No. 108.
Mem.- " Sidmoutli, 
1827.
Turner's description of this plant is better than the figure^ 
which is evidently from a bleached specimen.
It has been abundant 
here from June to October, often twelve inches high, in fine fructifica- 
tion, capsules and granular imbedded seeds on distinct plants.
The 
substance when fresh is cartilaginous but tender, full of moisture and 
brittle, breaking with the slightest touch, and shrinking to less than 
half its size in drying, and does not recover on subsequent immersion.
It is cylindrical in the upper, compressed in the lower branches.
When 
most plentiftil I tried several experiments with it.
Boiled in water it 
became of a most beautiful semitransparent green colour, and ate like 
delicate French beans, with a peculiar crispness and very agreeable 
taste.
It did not dissolve after boiling seven hours, but lost much of 
its size.
Vinegar nearly dissolved it, and changed the colour to yel- 
lowish brown.
Boiled in syrup of preserved apricots it became a lit- 
tle yellowish, but retained its crispness and was extremely good : and 
having but little flavour of its own it might be made to taste of lemon, 
ginger, &c." I enclose part of two plants in the different modes of 
fructification.
As a British species I would remark that its nearest 
affinity on the one hand is with Gigartina confervoides, on the other 
with Rhodomenia polycarpa of Greville (the Fucus Sarniensis of Tur- 
ner).
This last species has a much more compressed, nearly flat and 
broader frond, but the structure and fi-uit ai-e the same, and on this ac- 
count, in a future arrangement, it will doubtless be referred to its pro- â€¢ 
per genus.

Enquiry respecting Orchis hircina, Scop., and Orchis macra^ 
Lindl.
May T enquire if any kind friend can favour me by mention- 
ing any recently verified locality for either of these remarkable spe- 
cies ?
The first-named is said to occur in the neighbourhood of 
Dartford, but 1 am not aware of any living botanist having gathered 
it.

Warwickshire locality for Equisetum jiuviatile.
I fully ex- 
pected some correspondent would have given a locality for Equisetum 
fluviatile, and am sorry I did not send a solitary station for the War- 
wickshire list of ferns.
It was discovered in a damp copse near Elm- 
don, by James Clift ; and when out there last autumn I was told of it, 
and saw the decaying fronds.
It was scattered rather sparingly, but 
I should snspect it to be growing in other similar situations in that 
neighbourhood.
Equisetum sylvaticum and palustre were growing 
sparingly near the same spot ; and in a meadow close by, a new habi- 
550 
tat for Pamassia palustris was pointed out, where it had been in tole- 
rable abundance last season.

Repli/ to Mr. Watson\<i Enquiry respecting Mr. S.
Gibson.
As your correspondent Mr. Watson appears to have some doubts as to 
the identity of the S.
Gibson mentioned by Mr. Francis in his ' Ana- 
lysis of British Ferns,' in connection with Polypodium calcareum, and 
again in Mr. Watson's ' New Botanist's Guide, â€” (Phytol.
524) ; per- 
haps you will allow me to make a few remarks, which will, I think, 
set the question at rest.
In 1830â€”33 I sent several parcels of dried 
plants to Mr. R.
B. Bowman ; in these parcels there was every plant 
mentioned in Watson's Guide, with the name of Gibson connected 
with them, with the exception of Geranium nodosum, and that I never 
sent to any correspondent, since T never had more than one specimen 
of the plant, and that specimen is still in my possession.
If the Ge- 
ranium in question be any Geranium which I sent to Mr. Bowman, it 
will be Geranium pyrenaicum, and the locality would be Washerlane, 
near Halifax : and the labels for Polypodium calcareum would be 
written Sheden Clough, near Burnley, Lancashire.
If Mr, Bowman 
sent Mr. Waison fragmentary and ill-dried specimens, I cannot help 
that ; but I must say that 1 think Mr. B.
might have sent a few good 
ones out of the two or three hundred specimens of P.
calcareum which 
I sent him.
The locality for Meum Athamanticum should have been 
Ripponden, not Ripon, as in the 'Botanist's Guide,' p.
284.
If Mr.
Watson or any of his friends should happen to be in this neighbour- 
hood, and should wish to see the plants growing, I shall be happy to 
go with them to all or any of the localities given on my authority, the 
Geranium nodosum and Asarum europaeum excepted.
In 1830 I 
could have gathered five hundred specimens of Asarum, and have left 
perhaps twice that number; in 1842 I visited the locaUty in company 
with Mr. Borrer, and we sought for some time before we could find a 
single specimen, but at length we found a few, perhaps six or seven, 
some of which we gathered, and the rest we left.
If it do appear this 
season, I expect it will be the last; and then the Yorkshire Flora will 
lose Asarum europaeum, since we have no other authentic locality for it 
in the county.

Note on Polypodium Dryopteris.
I am informed by my rela- 
tive, the Rev. T.
Gisborne, that this fern was not introduced at Yoxall 
Lodge, as suggested in a former No.
(Phytol.

It exists in ex- 
tremely small quantity, and the spot has not been altered since the enclo- 
sure of Needwood Forest.â€” C.

Read, " Observations on the Growth and Reproduction of Enteromorpha intestina- 
lis." By A.
H. Hassall, Esq. The author states that in their earliest stage of deve- 
lopment the tapering filaments of this plant consist of a single series of cells placed 
end to end.
Each cell is afterwards bisected by a longitudinal line ; other lines sub- 
sequently make their appearance, and each original cell is thus ultimately divided into 
several others, each of which in its turn enlarges and is divided in the same manner.
From the repetition of this process the filaments increase in size, lose their confervoid 
character, present a reticulated appearance and become cylindrical and hollow.
The 
author states that in each articulation of the filaments, even when no thicker than a 
horse-hair, a dark central nucleus is developed, and that this is the reproductive germ, 
which he doubts not undergoes repeated division in the same manner as the reproducr 
tive globules of the Ulvee.
These nuclei germinate while enclosed within the cells, 
the filament still retaining its freshness and vigour ; and from them arise the jointed 
tapering filaments first described, which, after the rupture of the parent cell, and while 
their bases are still fixed within it, strongly resemble a parasitic Conferva.
This deve- 
lopment, division and growth of cells and reproductive bodies appears to be constantly 
going on, whence most specimens of the plant present examples of each stage of for- 
mation.
From these observations Mr. Hassall is led to regard Enteromorpha intesti- 
nalis as bearing a relation to the Conferva in its young articulated filaments, and to 
the Ulvae in its reproductive globules.
The author objects to the tautology of the spe- 
cific name, and proposes that of lacustris in its place.
Read also the conclusion of Mr. Clark's paper " On the Sea Cocoa-nut of the Sey- 
chelles.'' For a report of a paper on this subject, subsequently read before the Botani- 
cal Society of London, see Phytol.
463; the following are additional particulars.
The 
part of the trunk immediately above the ground forms an inverted cone, the apex of 
which is of an hemispherical form, with a great number of cord -like roots spreading 
from it in all directions, and remaining long after the destruction of the plant to which 
they belonged.
Where the trees have disappeared from clearings, by burning or other- 
wise, a black circle on the surface indicates their former site.
This circle is the base 
of the cone before mentioned, which now forms a huge bowl, often filled with decayed 
vegetable matter.
On removing this, the interior of the bowl is found to be pierced 
by a number of holes, each large enough to admit the end of the fore finger.
These 
holes are the openings of the compact, sonorous and brittle tubes into which the roots 
have been converted by the decay of their internal substance.
Mr. Clark states that 
the leaves are so firmly attached to the trunk, that a man may seat himself at the end 
of one with perfect safety.
The fibres of the leaflets are very strong and arranged in 
three layers, the central one being disposed transversely, the others longitudinally ; in

we hope to bring up arrears in the present and next number.

consequence of this arrangement, tlieir tissue, when divested of the parenchyma, re- 
sembles coarse book muslin.
Both male and female spadix are stated to pass through 
a fissure in the base of the accompanying leaf-stalk.
The drupe is fifteen inches in 
length, about three feet in circumference, and weighs from thirty to forty pounds ; as 
many as seven well-fonned drupes are sometimes seen on a single spadix.
The fe- 
cundation is occasionally imperfect, and then the ovary expands and lengthens, but 
' does not assume the usual form, and at the end of two or three years it falls off.
A 
female plant at Mahe flowered for several years without producing fruit, owing to the 
absence of a male plant.
In 1833, a male flower was procured from an estate a few 
miles distant, and suspended in the tree ; about two months aftei-wards one of the budi> 
expanded, and the mature fruit fell from the tree at the end of 1841.

This grain is 
about the size of mignonette-seed, and is said to be cultivated in the village of Kissy 
and the neighbourhood of Waterloo, by individuals of the Soosoo, Foulah, Bassa and 
Joloff nations, by whom it is called "hungry rice." Mr. Clarke describes the mode of 
cultivation, and the various methods of preparing the grain for food ; and he is of opin- 
ion that if imported into Europe, it might prove a valuable addition to the list of light 
farinaceous articles of food in use among the delicate or convalescent.
Specimens of the grass which accompanied Mr. Clarke's communication had becD 
examined by Mr. Kippist, Libr.
L.S., who added some observations on its botanica?
characters.
It is slender, with digitate spikes, and has much of the habit of Digitaria, 
but on account of the absence of the small outer glume existing in that genus, it must 
be referred to Paspalum.
Mr. Kippist regards it as an undescribed species, although 
specimens, collected by Afzelius at Sien'a Leone, are in the herbaria of Sir J.
E. Smith

into England, he has regarded it as a permanent variety of P.
ori- 
entale.
This name he retains for the species, both as being the older one, and appli- 
cable to all the varieties ; of which the four following he considers as permanent : â€” 
1. P.
orientale bracteatum; seeds always perfect.
2. P.
orientale prcecox, the 
" Monkey Poppy' ' of the old gardeners ; flowering in May with the preceding, seeds 
always sterile.

fect.
Only met with in continental gardens.
Dr. Forster states that he has been as- 
sured in the South of Europe, that P.
orientale bracteatum yields the best opium, and 
that in the largest quantity ; and as this plant seeds freely and suits the English soil, 
he thinks it might be advantageously substituted for P.
somniferum.

The wall opposite to the window is covered with the fern, 
which lies flat upon the stones, to which the fronds are attached throughout their whole

with a Icnife.

Read, a paper from the Rev. J.
B. Reade, entitled " Microscopic 'Chemistry, No.
IT." The paper was headed *' On the existence of Ammonia in Vegetable Substances 
described as containing Nitrogen." After stating that very minute portions of sul- 
phate of lime in snow may be rendered manifest by means of the microscope, and also 
that the almost inappreciable quautitiy of ammonia mentioned by Liebig as existing 
in the atmosphere would be capable of detection by the same means ; the author pro- 
ceeded to show the existence of ammonia in the seeds of plants, which he stated may 
be rendered apparent by burning the common field bean in a spirit-lamp, until tlame 
and smoke entirely cetvse.
The g-as given oft' is to be received on slips of glass 
moistened with pure hydrochloric acid.
The salt thus obtained he describes as 
a Siilt of ammonia, which he considei"s to be produced by the decomposition of an am- 
iuoniac;il salt previously existing in the bean, and not by the destructive distillation of 
an organic body in contact with the atmosphere.
This presence of ammonia the au- 
thor looks upon as proved in various ways : â€” 1.
By the before-mentioned production 
of crystals of hydrochlorate of ammonia on slips of glass, when the gas from the bean 
is exposed to the vapour of volatUe hydrochloric acid.
2. By the odour of this gas 
when received into an eight or ten ounce bottle, being clearly that of ammonia.
3. By 
the production of crjstals of bi-tartrate of ammonia on the addition of a little tartaric 
acid to the hydrochlorate.
4. By the action of the supposed ammouiacal g-as on test- 
papers, furnishing a proof of the presence of volatile alki\li.
And lastly, by an expe- 
riment in which he sublimed over hydrochlorate of ammonia, in an unchanged state, 
into a drop of distilled water.
The acid with which the ammonia is combined he sup- 
poses in some instances at least to be silicic acid.
In answer to an objection made to 
these views, that the ammonia is chemically fonued by the destructive distillation of 
the vegetable compoimd in contact with the atmt^sphere, the author adduced what, in 
his opinion, must be considered both negative and positive evidence ; the former being 
foimded on the known reluctance of nitrogen to enter into combination with all other 
substances ; the latter principally from the evolution of ammonia from bean-meal, 
heated in a glass tube with the month inserted into hydrochloric acid, thus preventing 
contact witli the atmosphere.
The anthor concludetl by describing a method of readily 
obtaining as a standard of measurement, a minute quantity of hydrochlorate of am- 
monia, equal to about the ^^^j^ of a grain.

distant, small, elongated, calyx with a long narrow tube, and five very 
acute lobes (occasionally with intermediate teeth), not plaited, petals 
narrow ; leaves small, spathulato-lanceolate, obscurely triple-nerved, 
mucronate ; footstalks bordered.
I have drawn up the above description from a specimen presented 
to the Botanical Society of London, by Mr. W.
L. Notcutt, who 
gathered it at Fareham.* It is a much more delicate-looking plant 
than any other British Statice I have seen, and has a very peculiar 
starved appearance.
The leaves are small and coriaceous, the only 
very distinct vein being the central one, which is very prominent at 
the back.
The most characteristic point I can find is the form of the 
calyx, which, as will be seen on a reference to the figures (3 and 6 
at page 561), differs materially fi-om that of S.
Limonium ; and I have 
ventured, fi-om this circumstance, strengthened by the form of the 
leaves and the general character of the plant, to continue Drejer's spe- 
cific distinction.
As the ' Flora Haffniensis ' is a rather uncommon 
book in this country, it may not be amiss to give here the extract con- 
taining the description of this plant : for this also I am indebted to 
Mr. Watson.

Mr. Notcutt has been good enough to furnish me with the follow-

the idea of its being a starved specimen of S.

both grow near each other."

Spikes elongated, flowers more distant, leaves lanceolate, narrow, 
sometimes linear-lanceolate (young leaves occasionally resembling 
the normal form in S.

stalks and a weak mucro, formed by the cartilaginous margins of the 
leaves.
This description is taken from a number of specimens in the herba- 
rium of the Botanical Society of London, from two localities in Scot- 
land ; one being St. Mary's Isle (the specimens are from the Botanical 
Society of Edinburgh) ; and the other Garlieston, Wigtonshire, (the 
specimens collected by Professor Balfour and communicated by Mr.
Watson).
The calyx of this variety exactly resembles that of Statice Limo- 
nium, a.
; and 1 have examined a number of specimens presenting 
every form of leaf between elliptic and linear-lanceolate, but very 
few approach to spathulate ; the spikes are very numerous, bearing 
many flowers, but are elongated, and each flower is perfectly distinct.
On this account the variety appeal's somewhat like S.
rariflora, but is 
distinguished by the shape and relative size of the calyx and the form 
of the leaves.
The whole plant, when dried, has a reddish brown tint.

â€” Sketch of Botanical Rambles in the Vicinity of 
Bristol.
By Leo. H.
Grindon, Esq.
The sketches of botanical rambles which have occasionally ap- 
peared in the pleasant pages of ' The Phytologist,' embolden me to 
offer you the following notes of two or three excm-sions made last 
summer in the vicinity of Bristol, a part of our island well known to 
be remarkably rich in rare and beautiful plants.
The lovely morning of July 3rd, 1842, found me approaching my 
native city by the Gloucester road ; and although the luxuriant and 
picturesque scenery upon either side afforded of itself sufficient delight 
and employment for the eye, I found time to remark profusion of 
Galium Mollugo, Pastinaca sativa, Malva sylvestris and Melilotus offi- 
cinalis by the way-sides, while the hedges wore a thick mantle of our 
elegant southern climber, Clematis Vitalba.
Here and there was a 
field literally purple with the bloom of the cultivated teasel, Dipsaeus 
Fullonum.
Early in the forenoon of the following day (Monday) I rambled away 
towards Horfield.
In the suburb of the town was abundance of Mer- 
curialis annua (a very common weed), Diplotaxis muralis, Coronopus 
Ruellii, Plantago media and Convolvulus arvensis ; the hedges being 
formed chiefly of Rubus fruticosus and Cornus sanguinea.
A little 
further in the countiy Centaurea Jacea, Agrimonia Eupatoria, Hy- 
pericum hirsutum and Hordeum pratense became plentiful.
The 
hedges were here completely enveloped in luxuriant Tamus communis 
and Bryonia dioica, occasionally relieved by a mass of wild roses, (R.
canina and systyla).
Viburnum Lantana and Opulus formed a consi- 
derable portion of many of the fences, as we left the smoke of the town 
behind us, and these, together with the Cornus, were in green fi-uit.
At Ashley was plenty of Rhamnus catharticus in the hedges, likewise 
in green fruit.
Asplenium Ruta-muraria was common upon the old 
walls, and Hordeum murinum by the road-sides.
On Brandon hill, 
in the afternoon of this day, I noticed Plantago Coronopus, i3.
nanus, 
in fruit, but was too late for Trifolium subterraneum, which likewise 
abounds there.
The evening was devoted to a walk to Redland: on 
the walls near the green, Hieracium murorum and Linaria Cymbalaria 
were blooming in great luxuriance ; Ceterach ofiicinarum was also in 
perfection.
I visited the Lamium longiflorum* habitat, but, as an- 
ticipated, found very little remaining in flower.
This is a most beau-

tilul plant, perfectly distinct from L.
album, and from all the cultivated 
states of L.
maculatum I have ever seen.
It occurs with both pink 
and white flowers.
The afternoon of Tuesday the 5th found me again at Redland, whi- 
ther I went for the purpose of collecting Bromus erectus, which is the 
principal grass in many meadows both here and at Horfield : but the 
scythe had swept all away.
To make amends, and not go home emp- 
ty handed, I pursued my walk until my vasculum was filled with Acer 
campestre in firuit, Poa compressa, Festuca myurus and Arenaria ser- 
jjyllifolia.
On Wednesday, July 6, we made an excursion to Clevedon, a lovely 
and highly picturesque watering place, twelve miles S.W. of Bristol.
Our road lay first through Ashton, wdiere, on the old shaded wall as- 
cending the hill towards Failand, six species of ferns at once present- 
ed themselves; â€” Ceterach officinarum, Asplenium Adiantum-nigrum, 
A. Trichomanes, A.
Ruta-muraria, Scolopendrium vulgare and Poly- 
podium vulgare : Lastraea Filix-mas and Pteris Aquilina grow upon 
the bank above, only a few feet distant.
It was upon this identical 
wall that, ten years ago, I first gathered them ; and although the inte- 
rest then excited by their novelty could not be renewed to me, their 
original beauty was still present, and filled my mind with a thousand 
pleasant memories.
Further up the hill, Cnicus acaulis 0.
caulescens was gi-owing among 
the gravel by the road-side.
Thenceforward, until we approached 
Tickenham, nothing remarkable presented itself, that is, nothing of 
botanical interest, a circumstance which none could regret, when 
compensated for by so glorious a prospect as that here enjoyed.
On 
descending the hill to the village of Tickenham, I found Linum an- 
gustifolium in flower and fi-uit, Phleum arenarium.
Verbena officinalis, 
and Salvia verbenaca in fruit ; while the high banks, even down to 
the very carriage-way, were adorned with a profusion of flowers such 
as I have never beheld, except in that one favoured spot.
Papaver 
Rhoeas, Cichorium Intybus, Galium verum, Malva moschata, M.
syl- 
vestris, wild roses, and a multitude of others no less showy, blended 
their bright hues beneath the unclouded sun more beautifully than 
pen can describe.
Thence, all the way to Clevedon, the old walls 
and dry hedge-banks were clothed with an infinite quantity of Cete- 
rach oflicinarum and Cotyledon Umbilicus ; the handsome branched 
variety of the latter being equally abundant with the ordinary simple- 
stemmed state of the plant.
Here and there in the hedges Campanula 
Trachelium showed itself; and occasionally, on walls, Sedum acre, S.
566 
clasyphyllum, S.
reflexum and Valeriana rubra.
Near the Bristol Ho- 
tel was Torilis nodosa, very large.
We reached the shore of the Bristol Channel about mid-day.
For 
a considerable distance the coast is here very precipitous and roman- 
tic, being formed of black, uncouth masses of rock, which appear to 
have fallen into their present position through the undermining influ- 
ence of the sea.
Inland the hills are steep, and, on their seaward 
slopes, comparatively barren, aflbrding little besides pasturage for 
sheep.
Filago germanica was, however, abundant, and in a little na- 
tural shrubbery of furze and brambles, I found Senecio sylvaticus and 
Calamagrostis Epigejos.
The path winds along the extreme edge of 
the cliffs, forming, as it were, the line of demarcation between earth 
and the oceanic territory.
Extending from the path down to high- 
water mark, except where interrupted by the rocks, is a steep grassy 
bank, abounding with beautiful flowers.
Here I gathered Iris fcetidis- 
sima, Orchis pyramidalis in profusion, Orobanche minor.
Euphorbia 
amygdaloides in fruit, Chlora perfoliata in profusion, Silene maritima, 
Festuca elatior, Scolopendrium vulgare, Daucus Carota^ and many 
others.
The vegetation by the sides of the path consists, in a great 
measure, of rather stunted Anthyllis Vulneraria.
Near Walton, the 
rocks are less rugged, and allow of walking upon and between them.
Here it was that in a low curious cave I met with Asplenium marinum, 
being the first time I had ever seen living plants.
Some of the finest 
sjjecimens were growing many yards from the entrance of the cave, 
where little light could enter, and so shut in by the sloping roof, that 
I had to creep till I was almost prostrate before they were accessible.
In the crevices of the rocks was abundance of Thrincia hirta, and of a 
curious and striking variety of Plantago Coronopus, having succulent, 
densely hairy leaves, and exceedingly numerous flower-scapes.
Fur- 
ther on, towards Portishead, Hypericum Androsaemum was in bloom, 
still retaining the ripe fruit of last year.
A few diminutive specimens 
of Samolus Valerandi were visible in a little cave ; and by the side of 
a fresh-water spring, which bubbles forth from amid the bosom of the 
rocks, Schoenus nigricans, brown and muddy from the tide washing 
over it.
After collecting these, together with some shells and speci- 
mens of the different Fuci, with which the rocks are thickly tapestried, 
we returned to Bristol ; and though the botanical value of the day's 
gatherings was not of the very first order, the delightful influences and 
associations under which they were collected have given them a deep 
and unfading interest.
During the 7th and 8th of July torrents of rain prevented all bota- 
567 
nizing.
Saturday the 9th was little better, but we then lost all pa- 
tience, defied the weather, and sallied forth for the purpose of explor- 
ing Leigh woods.
On the banks of the Avon, near Rownham, Trifo- 
liura fragiferum was in flower and fruit abundantly.
We likewise met 
with Cochlearia anglica, Plantago maritima, Scirpus niaritimus, Apium 
graveolens, &c.
It was desperately wet in the woods, and after a suc- 
cession of shower-baths from above, and drenchings from around and 
below, we were glad to retreat, in possession, however, of luxuriantly 
beautiful Cystopteris fragilis, Polypodium vulgare (eighteen inches 
long), Asplenium Trichomanes, Quercus sessiliflora, Pyrus Aria in 
green fruit, Tilia parvifolia, Acer campestre in green fruit, &,c.
Tuesday the 12th was brilliantly fine, and being the last day of my 
stay at Bristol, it was spent in part upon St. Vincent's Rocks; but the 
fatigue of a boisterous voyage to South Wales the previous day had 
quite unnerved me, and I was only tempted to summon up my remam- 
ing strength by the prospect of obtaining Orobanche barbata, Veronica 
hybrida, Rubia peregrina, Ceutaurea Scabiosa, Petroselinum sativum, 
Bromus diandrus, &c.
; with regard to all which, and many others of 
no less interest, I perfectly succeeded.
And thus ended my week's 
botanizing at Bristol.

â€” Plants observed in the neighbourhood of Ludlow, 
Shropshire.
By Frederick Westcott, Esq., A.L.S., &c.
Spring St., Edgbaston, December 3, 1842.
Sir, 
I send you an enumeration of plants which I gathered or ob- 
served during a short stay at Ludlow in October last.
I regret that I 
was too late for the grasses, Carices and Orchideae, and had no means 
of ascertaining the Fungi, which appear to be numerous : all these 
deficiencies I hope to supply next summer, when it is probable I may 
revisit the neighbourhood.
I send the list, not because it will be found to contain any very re- 
markable plants, but in the hope that persons in the neighbourhood 
may be induced to pay more attention to the Botany of their district ; 
for I have no doubt that many interesting discoveries may be made 
there, especially among the mosses, the lichens and the Fungi.
The 
Clee Hills, more particularly, would be found a rich locality.
568 
Hoping tkat some one on the spot will follow up this suhject in 
good earnest, and communicate the result to the interesting pages of 
your journal, I am.
Sir, 
Yours very truly, 
Fred.
Westcott.

are present on Sedura Telephium.
It was gathered by Mr. Cameron 
and myself on the Clee hills, in 
1 839, when we considered that its 
different appearance arose from 
growing at an elevation of from 
14 â€” 1 5,000 feet above the level of 
the sea ; itlias however been cul- 
tivated in the Birmingham Bota- 
nic Garden, for two years, next to 
the true S.

suffering the slightest change, and 
the difference between the two 
plants remains distinctly marked.

â€” Notice of^A Visit to the Australian Colonies.
By 
James Backhouse.' London : Hamilton, Adams, & Co. 1843.
(Continued from p.
553) 
During his stay at the Hampshire hills, J.
Backhouse made fre- 
quent excursions in the neighbouring country : in one of these he 
noticed Telopea truncata, or Van Diemen's Land tulip-tree, a laurel- 
like shrub bearing heads, four inches across, of brilliant, scarlet, wiry 
flowers ; an upright Phebalium, with silvery leaves and small white 
flowers ; and a white-flowered sorrel â€” Oxalis lactea j a Telopea, the 
571 
flowers of which abound in honey, which our author found it easy to 
extract by means of tlie slender tubular stems of gi'ass ; and a shrub- 
by Aster, with toothed leaves, so profusely loaded with pure white 
blossoms as to bend gracefully in all directions.
We now quote a 
passage that will give some idea of the denseness of the forests in this 
island.
" On an old road called the Lopham-road, a few miles from the Bay, we measured 
some stringy-bark trees, taking their circumference at about 5 feet from the ground.
One of these, which was rather hollow at the bottom, and broken at the top, was 49 
feet round; another that was solid, and supposed to be 200 feet high, was 41 feet 
round ; and a third, supposed to be 250 feet high, was 55^ feet round.
As this tree 
spread much at the base, it would be nearly 70 feet in circumference at the surface of 
the ground.
My companions spoke to each other, when at the opposite side of this 
tree to myself, and their voices sounded so distant that I concluded they had inadver- 
tently left me, to see some other object, and immediately called to them.
They, in 
answer, remarked the distant sound of my voice, and asked if I were behind the tree !
^Vhen the road through this forest was forming, a man, who had only about 200 yards 
to go, from one company of the work-people to another, lost himself: he called, and 
was repeatedly answered ; but getting fuaber astray, his voice became more indistinct, 
till it ceased to be heard, and he perished.
The largest trees do not always carry up 
their width in proportion to their height, but many that are mere spars are 200 feet high.
" The following measurement and enumeration of trees growing on two separate 
acres of ground in the Emu Bay forest, made by the late Henry Hellyer, the Surveyor 
to the V.
D. Land Company, may give some idea of its density.

The measurement of individual trees seems really enormous.
We 
have a prostrate tree measuring 200 feet to the first branch ; a second 
cut into rails each 180 feet long ; a third so large that it could not be 
cut into lengths /or splitting, and a shed had been erected against it, 
the tree serving for a back.
The following dimensions are given of 
ten standing trees, which occurred within half a mile : their circum- 
ference was taken at four feet from the ground.
No. 1,-45 feet; No.2,â€” 37A; No. 3,â€” 35; No. 4,â€” 38; No. 5,-28; No.
(i,â€” 30; 
No. 7,-32 ; No. 8,-65 ; No. 9,â€” 40| ; No. 10,-48.
On the banks of the Emu river was a laurel-like shrub of great 
beauty, with clusters of white blossoms half an inch across (Anoptera 
glandulosus).
In the same vicinity occur three edible plants; the first 
a fungus which grows on the myrtle, and is known in the colony by 
the name of " punk : " the second is also a fungus, produced in clus- 
ters from swollen portions of the branches of the same shrub, and va- 
rying in size from that of a nut to that of a walnut ; its taste is like 
cold cow-heel : the third is " Gastrodium sesamoides, a plant of the 
orchis tribe, which is brown, leafless, and 1^ foot high, with dingy, 
whitish, tubular flowers.
It grows amongst decaying vegetable mat- 
ter, and has a root like a series of kidney potatoes, terminating in a 
branched thick mass of coral-like fibres.
It is eaten by the Aborigi- 
nes, and is sometimes called Native Potato, but the tubers are watery 
and insipid." 
In returning over the island to Hobart Town, there appear to have 
been but few plants that attracted much notice.
In the vicinity of 
this place a species of Conospermura, with narrow strap-shaped leaves 
and small flowers, was noticed.
In October, 1833, the travellers as- 
cended Mount Wellington.
" At the base, sandstone and limestone form low hills ; further up, compact argil- 
laceous rock rises into higher hills, which abound in marine fossils.
The height of the 
mountain is 4000 feet.
Near the top, basalt shows itself in some places, in columnar 
cliffs.
The trees, for two-thirds of its height, are stringy-bark, white and blue gum, 
peppermint, &c.
A species of Eucalyptus, unknown in the lower part of the forest, is 
frequent at an elevation of 3000 feet.
Another is found on the top of the mountain.
The different species of Eucalyptus are very common, and form at least seven-eighths 
of the vast forests of Tasmania.
In the middle region of the mountain, the climate 
and soil are humid.
The Tasmanian myrtle â€” Fagus Cunninghamii, here forms trees 
of moderate size ; the Australian pepper-tree, â€” Tasmania fragrans, is frequent; the 
broad-leaved grass-tree â€” Richea Dracophylla, forms a striking object; it is very abun- 
dant, and on an average, from ten to fifteen feet high ; it is much branched, and has 
broad, grassy foliage.
The branches are terminated by spike-like panicles of white 
llowers, intermingled with broad, bractcal leaves, tinged with pink.
Culcilium salici.
Ibliuni, Hakca lissospcrma, Tclopea truncata, C'orriEa fcrruginea, Gaulthcria hispida.
573 
Prostanthera lasiantlios, Fricsia pcduiiculaiis, and many oUicr slinibs, are met witli in 
the middle region of the mountain.
For a considerable part of the way up, we availed 
ourselves of a path that is nearly obliterated, which was used by the workmen, when 
laying a watercourse from the breast of the mountain, for the purpose of supplying Ho- 
bart Town with water.
This path led through a forest of tree-ferns, surmounted by 
myrtle, &c.
Nearer the top, we had to ]iass a large tract of tumbled basalt.
The up- 
per parts of many of the stones were split off, probably by the alternations of frost and 
heat.
A few patches of snow were still remaining.
" Tlie top of the mountain is rather hollow, sloping toward Birches Bay, in the di- 
rection of which, a stream of excellent water flows.
The ground is swampy, with rocks 
and stony hills.
Astelia alpina, Gleichenia alpina, Drosera arcturi, several remarka- 
ble shrubby Asters, a prostrate species of Leptospermum, Exocarpos humifusus, a dense 
bushy Richea, and several mountain shrubs, of the Epacris tribe, are scattered in the 
swamps, and among the rocks." â€” p.
159.
In the narrative of a second visit to Flinders Island, in December, 
we find a more detailed account of the grass-trees than any that has 
previously been given.
Their stems are five to seven feet in height, 
and as many in circumference ; the crest or summit consists of a num- 
ber of grass-like leaves, three or four feet in length, and from the cen- 
tre of these rises a single erect flower-spike, varying from five to ten 
feet in height : this is thickly clothed with hard scales, and small, 
white, star-like flowers, except for about eighteen inches, at the base, 
which is bare.
The trunks of these grass-trees are charred with con- 
tinual burnings of the scmb ; and abundance of red resin, capable of 
being used in making sealing-wax and French polish, exudes from 
them : this resin fills the place left by the decay of the flower-stalk, 
and is abundant at the base of the stem, protecting this part from ex- 
cess of moisture.
The head of a grass-tree that has not thrown out a 
flower-stem is pleasant eating, and has a nutty flavour.
Accompanying 
the description is a plate, representing these extraordinary plants.
In May, 1834, our travellers being at Hobart Town, visited a small 
settlement on tlie Derwent, called Brown's River, and noticed in their 
walk Sprengelia incarnata, a heath-like shrub, which was in flower 
in some marshy grouTid by the way : also Plagianthns discolor, one 
of the Malvaceae, bearing clusters of white blossoms : the species of 
this genus are called Currijong, in common with others whose bark is 
sufliciently tenacious for making cordage.
Norfolk Island.
â€” James Backhouse landed on Norfolk Island in 
the beginning of March, 1835 : he thus describes it.
" Norfolk Island is about seven miles long and four broad.
A small portion of its 
southern side is limestone ; to the east of this there is a still smaller portion, of coarse, 
574 
siliceous sandstone.
The remainder of the island is basaltic, and rises into hills, co- 
vered with grass and forest.
The highest hill is Mount Pitt, which is on the north 
side of the island, and about 1,200 feet above the level of the sea.
The upper portions 
of the valleys, and the higher parts of the hills, are covered with wood.
The Norfolk 
Island pine, Altingia excelsa, towers a hundred feet above the rest of the forest ; it 
also grows in clumps, and singly, on the grassy parts of the island, to the very verge, 
where its roots are washed by the sea, in high tides.
In figure, this tree resembles the 
Norway spruce, but the tiers of its branches are more distant.
Its appearance is re- 
markably different, in its native soil, from what it is in the fine collection of trees at 
Kew ; where it nevertheless exhibits many of its striking and beautiful features.
â€” 
Where the wood of Norfolk Island merges into open grassy valley, a remarkable tree- 
fern, Alsophila excelsa, exhibits its rich crests among the surrounding verdure.
The 
fronds are from seven to twelve feet long ; they resemble those of Aspidium Filix- 
mas, and are produced in such a quantity, as to make this noble fern excel the princely 
palm-tree in beauty.
It usually has its root near the course of some rain-stream, but 
as its trunk rises to fifty feet in height, and its top does not afi"ect the shade, like many 
of its congeners, it forms a striking object in the landscape.
" Much of the land was formerly cultivated, but this is now overrun with the ap- 
ple-fruited guava, and the lemon, which were introduced many years ago, when the 
island was settled, with a view to its becoming a granary to New South Wales.
Grape 
vines, figs, and some other fruits, have also become naturalized.
In the garden at 
Orange Vale, cofi"ee, bananas, guavas, grapes, figs, olives, pomegranates, strawberries, 
loquats and melons, are cultivated successfully.
Apples are also grown here, but they 
are poor and will not keep." â€” p.
251.
" One of the remarkable vegetable productions of this island is Freycinetia Baueri- 
ana, or the N.
I. grass-tree.
It belongs to the tribe of Pandaneee, or screw pines.
Its 
stem is marked by rings, where the old leaves have fallen off, and is an inch and a half 
in diameter ; it lies on the ground, or climbs like ivy, or winds round the trunks of trees.
The branches are crowned with crests of broad, sedge-like leaves.
From the centre of 
these, arise clusters of three or four oblong, red, pulpy fruit, four inches in length, and 
as much in circumference.
When the plant is in flower, the centre leaves are scarlet, 
giving a splendid appearance to the plant, which sometimes is seen twining round the 
trunk of the princely tree-fern.
The New Zealand flax, Phorminm tenax, a large, 
handsome plant, with sedgy leaves, covers the steep declivities of many parts of this 
island, particularly at the tops of the cliffs of the coast.
It is suffered to grow to waste, 
except a little that is converted into small nets and cordage, by the prisoners, for their 
own use.
Two New Zealanders were once introduced, to teach the prisoners to pre- 
pare it ; but their process was so tedious, that the scheme was abandoned." â€” p.
256.
On the 16th our traveller rode with Major Anderson to Anson's 
Bay, on the northern side of the island.
" The road was chiefly through thick forest, overrun with luxuriant climbers.
Among thera was a Wistaria, with pea-flowers, of purple and gi'cen, and leaves some- 
thing like those of the Ash. It hangs in festocns of twenty or thirty feet, from the 
limbs of the trees that support it.
One of the most beautiful climbers of the island is 
Ipomoea pendula, which has handsome fingered foliage, and flowers like those of the 
major convolvulus, but of a rosy pink, with a darker tube.
The remains of two pines, 
575 
which were noted for their magnitude, and were blown down in a storm, were lying by 
the side of the road.
These were called ' The Sisters ; ' they were nearly two hundred 
feet in height."â€” p.
258.
The author informs us he frequently took a walk before breakfast, 
and explored the thickly wooded hills and valleys.
On the borders 
of the woods there was a great variety of beautifiil shrubs ; among 
these is â€” 
" The slender jasmine, Jasminum gracile, known in England as a delicate green- 
house plant.
Here it climbs over the bushes, or with twisted stems, as thick as a man's 
wrist, reaches the branches of lofty trees, at fifty feet from the ground, and climbs in 
their heads.
In these cases, it has probably grown up with the trees, the lower branch- 
es of which have progressively died away, and left the wreathed stems of the jasmine 
like ropes, hanging from the upper boughs.
Scattered on the grassy hills is Hibiscus 
or Lagunea Patersonii, which forms a spreading tree of forty feet in height : it is called 
here the white oak: its leaves are of a whitish green, and its flowers pink, fading to 
white, the size of a wine-glass.
It is perhaps the largest plant known to exist, belong- 
ing to the mallow tribe.* In a thick wood, I met with it eighty feet high, and with 
a trunk sixteen and a half feet round." â€” p.
258.
On the 28th of March James Backhouse, accompanied by the agri- 
cultural superintendant, walked to a stock-station, called Cheeses 
Gully, on the north side of the island.
He here observed two re- 
markable arches of rock, one of them connecting the columnar basalt 
of the cliff with a little inaccessible' islet, inhabited by gannets and 
tropic birds.
He noticed many of the old timber roads, grown up 
with the Cape goosebeny, Physalis edulis, â€” 
" Which produces abundance of pleasant, small, round fruit, in a bladder-like ca- 
lyx.
This is eaten by the prisoners, who also collect and cook the berries of the black 
nightshade, Solanum nigrum.
These berries are accounted virulently poisonous in 
England, but their character may possibly be changed by the warmer climate of Nor- 
folk Island.
'' In the woody gullies, the Norfolk-Island cabbage-tree, Arecasapida, abouuds.
It is a handsome palm, with a trunk about twenty feet in height, and from one and a 
half to two feet in circumference, green and smooth, wiih annular scars, left by the 
fallen leaves.
The leaves or fronds form a princely crest, at the top of this elegant 
column ; they are pectinate, or formed like a feather, and are sometimes nineteen feet 
in length ; they vary from nine to fifteen in number.
The apex of the trunk is en- 
closed in the sheathing bases of the leaf-stalks, along with the flower-buds, and young 
leaves.
When the leaves fall they discover double compressed sheaths, pointed at the 
upper extremity, which split open indiscriminately, on the upper or under side, and 
fall off, leaving a branched spadix, or flower-stem, which is the colour of ivory, and at- 
tached by a broad base to the trunk.
The flowers are produced upon this spadix : 
they are veiy small, and are succeeded by round seeds, red externally, but white, and 
* Except the Baobab, PI ytol.
433.â€” Ed.
576 
as hard as horn, internally.
As the seeds advance towards maturity, the spadix he- 
comes green.
The young, unfolded leaves of this cahhage-tree, rise perpendicularly, 
in the centre of the crest.
In this state, they are used for making brooms ; those still 
iinprotruded, and remaining enclosed within the sheaths of the older leaves, form a 
white mass, as thick as a man's arm ; they are eaten raw, boiled or pickled.
In a raw 
state, they taste like a nut, and boiled, they resemble artichoke-bottoms.
The seeds 
furnish food for the wood-quest, a large species of pigeon, which has a bronzed head 
and breast, and is white underneath, and principally slate-coloured on the back and 
wings.
This bird is so unconscious of danger, as to sit till taken by a noose at the end 
of a stick ; when one is shot, anothe r will sometimes remain on the same bough, till 
itself also is fired at.
We measured a Norfolk Island pine, twenty-three feet, and an- 
other twenty-seven feet, in circumference.
Some of them are nearly two hundred feet 
high.
The timber is not of good quality, but is used in building ; it soon perishes 
when exposed to the weather.
This is said to be the case with all the other kinds of 
wood on the island.
Norfolk Island iron-wood, Olea apetala, is the only other sort re- 
puted to be worth using.
No fences of wood are expected to stand above three years.
Vegetation is rapid in this fine climate, but decay is rapid also.
There are very few 
dead logs lying in the bush." â€” p.
264.
On the 2nd of April our traveller explored a gully on the north side 
of the island, and found it " shaded by forest and abounding in ferns 
and young palms;" he also observed four orchideous epiphytes on the 
upper branches of the trees.
Peperomias and ferns were plentiful ; 
the former " are spreading green plants allied to pepper ; " they were 
growing on moist rocks, " on the dark sides of which Trichomanes 
BauerianuH}, a membranaceous fern of great beauty, forms tufts ex- 
ceeding a foot in height." On the rocks of the south coast he found 
Asplenium difforme, a fern resembling Asplenium marinum : a little 
way inland the leaves of this fern are more divided, and it varies 
through every intervening form, until, in the woods in the interior of 
the island, the leaves are separated into such narrow segments, that 
the fructification becomes marginal, and in this state the plant is call- 
ed Coenopteris odontites.
On the 4th, after visiting a gang of invalids 
employed in stone-breaking, J.
Backhouse explored a place called the 
Cascade, fringed in places with copses and straggling tree-ferns.
A 
little brook winds from the woody hills to an open valley, formerly in- 
habited by settlers, whose chimneys were still standing, and whose 
orchards, now run wild, have spread grape-vines, lemons, figs and 
guavas all around.
"Their sugar-caues have also become naturalized, and border the streamlet thick- 
ly, till it falls over a basaltic rock, about twenty feet high, decorated with ferns, and a 
variety of other plants.
Here the brook is again narrowed by woody hills, and mar- 
gined by luxuriant plants of the broad, sedgy-leafed New Zealand flax, and water- 
cress, till it emerges on an open, flat, basaltic promontory, from the very point of which 
it falls, about twenty feet, to the sea beach, where it is lost among the large, rounded, 
577 
tumbled stones.
Among the sugar-cane and scrub at this point, a beautiful convolvu- 
lus-like plant, Ipomcea cataractEe, is entwined, and exhibits its large, purple flowers, 
shot with red.
It was named from this place, by Bauer, a celebrated botanist, who 
accompanied one of the earliest navigators of these seas, and whose ' Flora of Norfolk 
Island ' has lately been published by a person named Endlicher.
" Ipomcea carinata, a large plant of the Convolvulus tribe, having white flowers, 
with long tubes, that open at night, climbs among the trees in the borders of the woods.
Among the bushes there are two pretty species of passion-flower, Disemma adiantifolia 
and D.
Baueriana, with copper-coloured blossoms.'' â€” p.

Note on Adiantum Capillus- Veneris.
About sixteen years 
ago I foirnd Adiantum Capillus- Veneris on the Clee hill, Titterstoue.
It was growing among the stones, on the ascent to the group of rocks 
called the Giant's Chair.
I plucked a piece of it as a specimen, and 
placed it in my book, leaving the root.
This specimen I kept by me 
for some time, but at last it was lost, and of the loss I took no notice, 
not doubting that the next time I visited the spot, I should again find 
the plant.
However, I have hitherto been unsuccessful in my re- 
searches, but it would be well if some one would diligently search for 
it, and perhaps it may again be discovered.

Note on Convallaria bifolia, Linn., as a reputed British Spe- 
cies.
In connexion with the notice of the recent discovery of this 
beautiful little plant in England (Phytol.
520), I beg to add that it is 
mentioned as indigenous in the woods at Hampstead, Middlesex, in 
the list of wild plants in the ' History of Hampstead ' by Park, pub- 
lished, I believe, thirty or forty years ago : and in 1835 I detected 
several patches of the plant, apparently well established and really 
wild, under the shade of fir-trees, growing near the highest parts of 
Caen wood, the property of the Earl of Mansfield, between Hamp- 
stead and Highgate, A year or two before that time, 1 had also ob- 
served it under fir-trees in Aspley wood, Bedfordshire.
The village 
580 
of Aspley is situate at the distance of a short walk from the town of 
Woharn : I have no means of ascertaining if specimens may still be 
obtained from thence.
Convallaria majalis was plentiful all over Asp- 
ley wood, but past flowering when C.
bifolia was found.
This wood 
is one of the most picturesque and delightful that can be imagined.
It was a favourite resort of the late amiable poet, WifFen, when do- 
miciled at Woburn Abbey ; and many of the charming graphic de- 
scriptions of woodland scenery appearing in his works, may well be 
supposed to have been depicted from the oiiginals of this delightful 
locality.

Note on the Surrey locality for Fritillaria Meleagris.
In 
the ' Naturalists' Almanack ' for 1843, it is said that " this very beau- 
tiful and local plant flowers profusely in some meadows at Mortlake," 
(p.
9).
This species, called by the country folk " snake's head," used 
to flower in a meadow at Mortlake, SuiTey, known from that circum- 
stance as " the Snake's-head Meadow," but of late years it has become 
very scarce, if not altogether eradicated by the ruthless hands of the 
village children, by whom the early showy plant was coveted as an 
ornament to their May garlands.
The meadow is at the Thames side, 
beyond the brewhouses, and about midway between the village and 
Kew bridge.
On visiting the spot at the proper time, during several 
seasons within the last five years, I was not able to obtain more than 
a single specimen.
I am not aware of any other recorded station for 
the Fritillary in the immediate environs of the metropolis.

Lithospermum pitrpureo-cosruleum.
" The purple gromwell, 
a local and veiy beautiful plant, found in Darenth wood, in Kent," â€” 
(Nat, Aim. 11).
To the best of my belief, this species does not now 
occur in Darenth wood.
I cannot learn that any of my friends have 
detected it there during recent years ; neither have I, after numerous 
diligent searches, been able to meet with it.
I possess specimens from 
Babbicombe, Devon.

PcBonia corallina.
" The peony, a plant now only found in 
some small islands of the Bristol Channel, and even in these it is be- 
coming year after year less abundant, and will perhaps before long 
cease to exist in Britain in a state of nature," â€” (Nat. Aim.
13).
May 
I venture to enquire, through the medium of 'The Phytologist,' if the 
above statement can be verified by any reader of that useful periodi- 
cal ; and if it is within possibility to hope to obtain a specimen of so 
great a desideratum to our herbaria ?
â€” Id.

Scilla aatumnalis.
" There are several spots on Blackheath 
where it is abundant," â€” (Nat. Aim.
19j.
Within recollection this plant 
581 
was tolerably plentiful on Blackheath, but I fear it is now well nigh 
lost in that locality.
Certainly it "has been far from abundant for ma- 
ny years, owing to the heath having become a well-trodden promenade, 
and the frequent resort of cricket-players &c., which formerly was not 
the case.
I noticed the plant, in small quantity, near the clump of 
trees on the heath, near the highway to Eltham, a few autumns ago ; 
last year not a single specimen appeared.
I believe it may still be 
met with in abundance at the Warren, at Shome in this county.

Habitat for Tordylium officinale, Linn.
(Eng. Bot.
1st edit.
t. 
2440).
I used to meet with a plant which I believe to have been this 
species, about Swanscombe, in bushy places between the church and 
the entrance to Swanscombe wood, in passing from the village to the 
wood.
It was to be found there in 1839 ; not having visited the lo- 
cality since that time, I cannot affirm that it yet exists there.
This 
station for it is not given in any list of localities with which I am ac- 
quainted.
The plant seems to be now erased from our Flora; it does 
not appear in the Edinburgh Society's Catalogue.

Note on Dicranum adiantoides and taxifolimn.
Allow me, 
through the medium of your valuable periodical, to offer a few remarks 
on Dicranum adiantoides and taxifolium.
Since the commencement 
of the present season, my attention has been particularly directed to 
the consideration of these two mosses, and every observation tends to 
confirm my opinion that they are varieties of the same species, though 
their extreme forms are widely different.
The nearly allied species, 
D. bryoides, is veiy variable in form and size.
I have luxuriant spe- 
cimens before me from one of our peat bogs, two inches high, which 
preserve their character of terminal fruit-stalks, and render that spe- 
cies truly distinct : but the characters of the lateral and radicular 
fruit-stalks of D.
adiantoides and D.
taxifolium are not always to be 
depended on as specific distinctions.
A few days ago I gathered both 
growing within a yard of each other ; D.
taxifolium covered the bank 
with its beautiful green foliage, and D.
adiantoides flourished on the 
stump of a tree, intermingled with several other mosses.
Some spe- 
cimens of the latter were very fine and characteristic, bearing several 
lateral fruit-stalks, while others were small, producing them also from 
the base.
D. taxifolium occurred mostly with radicular footstalks, 
but I detected several producing them also laterally, which differed 
not materially from the smaller specimens of adiantoides.
The 
character of flexuose fruit-stalks is not peculiar to any of the species, 
as I have observed it occasionally in all three.
I hope these remarks 
may elicit further information on the subject from those who arc more 
582 
competent to treat on it than myself.

ter, March Q, 1843.

Note on Vegetable Morphology.
I cannot see how the luxu- 
riant growth of a stamen, causing it to produce a petaloid expansion 
at its upper extremity, in addition to those parts necessary for its pe- 
culiar functions, can be regarded as a proof of a descending metamor- 
phosis, (Phytol.
523) ; by which I understand a dwindling away as it 
were of the vital energy of the plant, preventing the development of 
the elementary structures into the highest forms of which they are ca- 
pable.
This theory of a descending metamorphosis appears to me to 
be unphilosophical in the extreme, for surely, if we can trace the same 
type through a series of organs, the simplest and first developed of 
which can, if necessary, perform the collective functions of the whole, 
we cannot hesitate to take this simplest form as primary.
I consider 
that the monstrosities we see in Dahlias &c.
are caused, immediately, 
by an excess of nutriment afforded to the plant, which necessitates a 
great development of the organs of digestion and respiration, viz., the 
leaves : this, of course, diminishing the power of the plant to perfect 
its floral organs, and thus causing what may be termed an arrest of 
development, whereby stamens remain petals, &c.
This does not ex- 
plain the fact mentioned by Mr. Bladon; but if the anther was perfect, 
which he says it appeared to be, there is nothing very extraordinary in 
the production of a small petaloid expansion from the stamen, arising 
from a redundancy of vital action, when we consider how closely the 
two parts in question are allied.

Note on the " Daill llosg y Tcin.^'' In answer to Mr. Lees' 
enquiry respecting the above plant (Phytol.
521), I have enclosed a 
few leaves and a young plant of the species known by that name in 
this part of Gwent,* and applied to the same purposes.
As I have 
never examined the inflorescence of this plant I cannot give its name, 
but it is evidently monocotyledonous, and not a fern.
In the summer 
the leaves are considerably larger, some of them being an inch or an 
inch and a quarter in breadth.
They never rise above the water, but 
at that season lie incumbent on the surface.
At the present time 
those with the longest stems lie horizontally, about half an inch be- 
low the surface, while the shorter-stemmed ones are as nearly upright 
as those of the generality of plants.

unable to say, but I had to break the ice to procure the specimens sent.
The manner of using the leaves is to lay a number of them on the 
burn, and as they dry to replace them by fresh ones.
A friend of 
mine, a native of Morganwg,* informs me that in that part the leaves 
are mixed up with lard, so as to form an ointment ; he thought that 
the leaves known by the above Cambro -British name were very much 
larger than the size stated ; perhaps some other species may be used 
by the Glamorganshire people for the same purpose, as the name only 
indicates the "leaf for a burn by fire." â€” James Bladon; Pont-y-Pool,

On the injiueiice of Light in 'producing the Green Colour of 
Plants.
About Christmas, 1841, I was searching in a wood, chiefly 
oak, for some lichens to decorate the perches in a glazed case, in- 
tended for the reception of some ornithological specimens.
I hap- 
pened to turn over with my foot a piece of oak bark, about fifteen 
inches long : the side next the ground (the external part of the bark 
when in situ) was covered with lichens of the most vivid green, quite 
as bright as that of any leaves in early summer, not the pale colour of 
young shooting leaves, but of those arrived at mature growth.
From 
the appearance of the grass under and on each side of the place where 
the bark had been, it had evidently lain there at least all the previous 
summer : yet I have never seen any lichens of the same or any other 
species, exposed to the full light of " day's garish eye," in the least 
approaching the vividness of the colour in the specimens alluded to 
above.

[The following passage relating to the Algse, which are nearly allied to the Lichens, 
occurs in the Introduction to Harvey's 'Manual of British Algae.' After mentioning 
the three principal varieties of colour among the Alga;, namely, grass-green, olivace- 
ous-brown or olive-green, and red, the author states that the first of these colours is 
characteristic chiefly of such species as are " found in fresh water, or in very shallow 
parts of the sea, along the shores, and generally above half-tide level,'' the great mass 
of the green Algae being inconsiderably submerged.
" The olivaceous-brown or olive- 
green is almost entirely confined to marine species; * * the red also is almost exclu- 
sively marine, and reaches its maximum in deep water.
* * How far below low- 
water mark the red species extend has not been ascertained, but those from the extreme 
depths of the sea are of the olive series in its darkest form.
For the colours of these 
last it has puzzled botanists not a little to account.

Kott' OH Viri parous Grasses.
It appears to nio that some 
misappvehonsion exists with veganl to Avhat are called " viviparoivs" 
grasses.
1 have several times been deceived by the term, and should 
like to see the matter cleared up in the pages of 'The Phytologist.' 
Ill works of authority we are told that "in wet seasons tlie seeds of 
grasses freipiently germinate before they fall from the husks, and that 
a crop of young plants at the sumniit of the pai-eut stem is the conse- 
quence," or words to that effect.
Now in the greater part, or all the 
cases of viviparous grasses which have come lutder my observation, 
the plants hare never Jiowered at all, tmd of course produced no seed.
Wow far, ('// passd/if, may this circumstance be considered as illus- 
trating the morphological doctrine, that every llower is but a stunted 
branch ?
Festuca ovina, ^.
inripara, growing in my garden, produces 
heads of young plants in the above manner every year, but never Uow- 
ers at all.
That such is the case with wild specimens of this and 
other species that are found viviparous, we are by no means led to 
suppose; in fact we are informed just the opposite.
Do the seeds of 
pastm-e grasses ever germinate in the husk, like wheat, when it is said 
to " sprit " ?
The following ai"e the grasses which I possess or have 
heard of as being occasionally viviparous.

arran{jem.ent of a Herharium.
In reply to the enrfuiry 
on the wraj/per of tlie ktftl Xo. of * 71*e VYisXfAfy^^X^ respecting the 
beftt metho<l of arranging a herbarium, I beg to offer a description of 
the plan of my owti, which iÂ«4 both compact, neat and easy of reference, 
and answers the erjd for which it waÂ« d*;signed admirably well.
In 
the first place I have six goard-book*, made of ^///<?
<ifc7wy paper, three 
quire-j in ear;h, but thlÂ» being rather too little, I would recorrnnrmd 
thr^;e and a quarter: they mu-st be at least 4|^ inches wirle in the land- 
ing, i have them labelWl, " Herbarium Britannicura, No. 1, 2,** &c- 
and also " Linnaran System," with the names of the classes contained 
in each volume.
No. 1 has the first four classes; No. 2 has one â€” 
Pentandria ; No. 3 the next seven ; and No. 4, 5 and 6, four classes 
^^ach.
Dividing the system in this manner renders the c^^itents <^/f 
frach volume as nearly equal as possible.
At the l.>eginriing of each 
volume I have an index to the classes, orders and genera contained in 
it, referring to the came pasted on the comer of the left hand page, 
where each commences, ooe or more leaves being allotted to each ge- 
nus.
The whole Is arranged after the fourth edition of Hooker's 
* British Flora.' I have also one of Francis's Hsts of species, which 
is taken from the above work, cat up and pasted at the ends of the 
volumes.
On this 1 mark off the species as I get them ; so that by 
tiiming to the lists I can see at once lx>th what each vobime contains 
and what are desiderata.
In the next place I have the specimens fas- 
tened down on half sheets of j/rintirtfj d.emy^ with very narrow strips 
of blue paper ; for this purpose I use common paste.
When this is 
rlone, and the paste is drj-, to prevent the attacks of insects, I lay on 
a little weak solution of corrosive sublimate in spirits of turpentine.
In case of small species, such as Veronicas, violets, saxifrages, &c., I 
have more than one on the same half sheet, but still keep up the ar- 
rangemerjl as above.
These leaves are then put loose in their proper 
places between the leaves of blue paper, which adds greatly to the 
beauty of the whole.
It may be thought th^t these l>^Kiks are verv' un- 
wieldy, but thev are in fact no more so than Gerard's Herl^al, or any 
3f 
â–  586 
other volume of a similar size.
This might be remedied by dividing 
the system into smaller portions, and having a corresponding number 
of books, which would perhaps be an improvement ; in this case I 
would allow a leaf to each species throughout.

Note on the supposed new British Cerastium.
In the number 
for this month (Phytol.
497) Mr. Edmonston has endeavoured to show 
that the Cerastium latifolium of Linnaeus was not known to British 
botanists as an indigenous plant, until discovered by himself in Shet- 
land ; the plants of Wales and the Highlands, hitherto so named by 
the botanists of this country, being only a variety of C.
alpinum.
This 
idea is backed by a reference to the opinion of Mr. C.
C. Babington, 
whose botanical acuteness, and particular study of the genus Ceras- 
tium, combine to render his opinion on the subject deserving of atten- 
tion.
After reading the paper of Mr. E., I examined living plants of 
the Cerastium alpinum and latifolium (of British authors), gathered on 
Ben Lawers in 1841, and now in my garden; also numerous speci- 
mens in my herbarium, from Wales and the Highlands, from Faroe, 
Norway, Switzerland, and Arctic America ; and likewise the descrip- 
tions of them by various botanical authorities.
The conclusion arrived 
at is, first, that the differential characters assigned to the two species 
(of Linnseus) by Mr. Edmonston are quite untenable ; and secondly, 
that the Shetland plant is in all likelihood a mere form or variety of 
the same species as the C.
latifolium (of British authors) found on 
many of the Highland mountains.
I consider the characters assigned 
to C.
alpinum by Mr. Edmonston to be untenable, because they would 
exclude not only many of the Highland plants commonly called C.
latifolium, but also various specimens of undoubted C.
alpinum pre- 
served in my herbarium ; while, on the contrary, his characters of C.
latifolium (of Linnaeus) apply to some of my specimens of C.
alpinum, 
quite as well as they apply to my Swiss specimens of C.
latifolium.
To go no farther than the leaves (which indeed afford Mr. E.
the 
strongest contrast â€” upon paper), I find this year's shoots of the Ben 
Lawers plants, both C.
alpinum and C.
latifolium, bearing leaves 
equally short, broad, and obtuse, as the leaves in Mr. Edmonston's 
figure of his Shetland plant.- In some of my dried specimens of C.
alpinum I observe the leaves are obtuse, while in others they are acute ; 
587 
and in a specimen of C.
latifolium (of British authors), gatliered on 
Ben Lawers, there are lanceolate, ovate, and almost orbicular leaves 
from the same root.
In Koch's Synopsis, the same terms are applied 
to the leaves of both species, namely, " elliptic or lanceolate." It is 
consequently evident that Mr. E.
was describing only particular forms 
of these plants, when he set down the leaves of C.
alpinum as "ovate, 
or ovate-lanceolate, acute," and those of C.
alpinum as being "orbi- 
cular, obtuse." Each species produces both these forms of leaves.
The other contrasted characters given by Mr. E.
appear to be as little 
constant as those taken from the leaves.

Localities of Orchis hircina, Scop, and O.
macra, Lindl.
For 
the information of your con'espondent, Mr. E.
Edwards (Phytol.
555), 
I send the following.
Orchis hircina, Scop., in consequence of the 
rapacity of collectors, is nearly if not entirely eradicated from the 
neighbourhood of Dartford, Kent.
It was to be found to a certainty 
near Puddledock and Stanhill, in Wilmington parish, about twenty or 
thirty years ago, in the hedge-rows ; also at Trulling Down, in the 
road to Greenstreet Green.
Sir James Edw. Smith, Sir Wm. Hooker, 
Mr. Borrer, the late Professor Don, Mr. George Don, Mr. Joseph 
Smith, Mr. Anderson of Chelsea, and myself, have gathered it in these 
stations, and I dare say it is still to be met with at or near some one 
of the above-mentioned places.
Orchis macra, Lindl., I have gather- 
ed at Stonewood, near Bean ; at the entrance to Lullingstone castle, 
and in a copse near the farm-house at Mapplescombe, in Kingsdown 
parish ; and I think it is likely to be met with now at the latter place, 
if diligent search be made for it.

On the proposed change in the name of Equisetum limosum.
To alter a name which is now generally adopted by botanists, solely 
because a different name was applied to the same species of plant a 
century ago, would surely be an adherence to the letter rather than to 
the spirit of that useful rule which says that priority must decide the 
name.
The rule itself is highly convenient to prevent confusion in 
nomenclature, but surely, it is better to disregard the rule in any par- 
ticular case, where an adherence to it would actually create confusion.
Moreover, in the present instance, it seems doubtful whether the rule 
really sanctions a change.
I deem it highly probable that the two 
Linnaan names, E.
limosum and E.
fluviatile, belong to two forms 
(unbranched and branched) of the one species which Smith and hosts 
of other botanists have known under the former name.
If so, the 
588 
name of its variety (E.
fluviatile) should not be substituted for the 
name of the species, (E.
limosum).
As to the plant now universally 
called E.
fluviatile by British botanists, the same objection vrould not 
lie against a change for an older name than that erroneously applied 
to it by Smith and others.
The species which is now known in Bri- 
tain as E.
fluviatile, must have been confounded with E.
arvense by 
Hudson and others ; for it is too frequent to have remained unknown.
The E.
fluviatile of Hudson must be the branched form of E.
limo- 
sum; E fluviatile of Smith is probably the variety 0.
of Hudson's E.
arvense.

Places of growth of Equisetum Jluviatile of Smith.
There is 
a partial inaccuracy in the statement that Equisetum fluviatile "affects 
loose gravelly and sandy places unconnected with water," (Phytol.
533).
It occurs occasionally in corn-fields and other places out of 
water, but is always (as far as my observation goes) short and stunted 
in such situations.
The finest examples that 1 have met with were in 
the counties of Chester and Lancaster, growing on the red marl, by 
the sides of streams or in water with a deep muddy bottom.
Indeed, 
it is a notion among the rustics of Cheshire, that horses get "bogged" 
by their endeavours to graze on this plant in the muddy pools of that 
county ; and I have certainly seen a horse almost over head in mud in 
a small pond filled with the tall "horse-tails," which is the name given 
more particularly to the barren fironds of the present species.
I may 
add also that I met with one locality for the same species in the Azores, 
and was ankle-deep in mud before I could reach a frond of it.

The supposed locality of Geranium nodosum near Halifax.
The communication of Mr. S.
Gibson (Phytol.
556) is interesting and 
satisfactory, as tending to establish the accuracy of localities for rare 
plants which were published in the ' New Botanist's Guide,' on the 
authority of specimens derived through the hands of Mr. Bowman ; â€” 
but it seems that we must make an exception to this, in the case of 
Geranium nodosum, the locality of which was printed " Waterham, 
near Halifax." Mr. Gibson corrects this, by saying that the species 
was " G.
pyrenaicum," and the locality " Washerlane, near Halifax." 
Doubtless I misread the label, which, even now, looks to me more 
like the name that I printed, than the one now given by Mr. Gibson ; 
but every one must be aware of the difficulty of reading unfamiliar 
names unless very distinctly written.
In regard to the species, how- 
ever, I can only affirm that my specimen is certainly not G.
pyrenai- 
cum ; but that it belongs to a section of the genus which includes our 
indigenous G.
pratense and G.
sylvaticum, as also that doubtful na- 
580 
live, G.
nodosum.
The specimen is merely the top part of a stem, 
with the immature fruit after the fall of the petals; and though I can- 
not speak confidently with only this " fragmentary specimen " before 
me, 1 think it G.
nodosum.
But the name on Mr. Gibson's label is 
" G.
pyrenaicum," so that there is either a mistake respecting the spe- 
cies, on the part of Mr. Gibson, or, it may be, an accidental substitu- 
tion of a garden specimen of G.
nodosum in place of a wild specimen 
of G.
pyrenaicum.
The question still remains, whether the specimen 
in my herbarium (that of G.
nodosum, probably, but certainly not of 
G. pyrenaicum) was really gathered wild near Halifax ?
On receiving 
the specimen I wrote to Mr. Bowman for further information, but that 
gentleman was not able to say more than the label stated.

Note on " Dail llosy y Tdn.^^ In a late number of your Jour-

used by the Welsh peasantry, as a remedy for burns, under the above 
name, as alluded to in the memoir appended to the prize elegy (or 
" Marwnad,") to the memory of the late Lady Greenly.
The mention 
of this enquiry to my friend " Tegid," the talented author of the poem, 
has procured for me, at his instance, from Lady Hall of Llano ver, 
(another great promoter of Welsh literature), accredited specimens of 
the plant, which, as you will see from the enclosed frond, gathered 
over " Ffynnon Ofer," proves to be the Scolopeudrium vulgare of bo- 
tanists.
Lady Hall remarks that it is in "some parts of South Wales" 
where this simple is known as " Dail llosgi Tan : " in fact, my enqui- 
ries on the subject in some parts of North Wales, availed nothing at

April 19, 1843.
â€” J.
S. Bowerbank, Esq., in the chair.
Read, a paper by Arthur Hill Hassall, Esq., entitled, " Some further observations 
on the Decay of Fruit." The author refers to an opinion expressed by him in a fonner 
paper, that the well-known principle adopted by Liebig, that a body in the act of de- 
composition is capable of communicating the same to other bodies by a kind of indue- 
592 
lion, does not apply to the general form of decomposition occurring in fruit, principally 
from the circumstance of its attacking it in a highly vital condition, when it could not 
be supposed to he the subject of any spontaneous or chemical decomposition: and also 
to that of Dr. Lankester, expressed at a former meeting, that Liebig's views did not 
afford a sufficient explanation of every example of decay occurring in fruit, as he con- 
sidered that an apple, once removed from the tree, was no longer in a vital state, but 
that it immediately became a prey to a species of fermentation.
He then proceeded 
to express his doubts as to the accuracy of the last supposition, inasmuch as it is pos- 
sible to preserve fruit, free from all visible deterioration, for many months after its re- 
moval from the tree.
Still, admitting both these and Liebig's views to be correct, they 
do not, in his opinion, explain the reason why decay commences in a spot gradually 
extending itself over the surface of the fruit, and does not at once involve its entire 
substance and fabric.
He therefore proceeded to show that these phenomena were to 
be referred to the operation of entophytal Fungi for a satisfactory solution, still admit- 
ting the existence of a second form of decomposition in fruit, this being comparatively 
of rare occurrence, and which appears to be the result of chemical affinities, in conse- 
quence of the fruit having ceased to exist, and to which the views of Liebig may in 
some cases, perhaps with propriety, be applied.
He also stated that since the former 
meeting of the society he had repeated the experiment of inoculating fruit with the 
sporules of the Fungi, with the same success which attended the former trial, but that 
he had failed in inducing decay in sound fruit by the introduction of decayed matter 
destitute of Fungi in any state ; still, however, he considered this might ensue in some 
cases in which the vitality of the fruit was either totally destroyed, or, at all events, 
much enfeebled; and even if an invariable consequence, still it would not in any way 
affect the statement made relative to the independent power possessed by Fungi in 
originating decay ; and again, if these were proved not to do this, they would still be 
of as much importance in a practical point of view as ever; since, when inserted into 
fruit which is undergoing spontaneous decay, they produce marked and rapid effects, 
and speedily ensure its complete destruction.
In conclusion, he stated that the apples 
employed in the experiments were of an exceedingly firm description, and that an 
equal number of each were inoculated with the sporules and with decayed matter.
Dr. Edward Jenner having again forwarded to the society some beautiful specimens 
of Fragilaria pectinalis and Diatoma flocculosum, and having had his attention di- 
rected to a report of the Proceedings of the Society, in which it was said that the spe- 
cimens before sent were animalcules; â€” forwarded a paper in reply, wherein he states 
that the objects sent are considered by botanists to belong to Algae.
By Ehrenberg 
they are classed with his Infusoria and thought to be animalcules, as he supposes they 
increase by self-division ; but this last fact is not sufficient to remove them from the 
vegetable kingdom, since many plants, such as the lily, crocus, &c., also increase their 
species by self-division.
Three other genera, Achnanlhes, Gomphonema and Cocco- 
nema, which are at present classed by botanists with plants, the author considers to be 
of a doubtful nature, thinking they may possibly be found to be Zoophytes.
He also 
stated that the stomic cells mentioned by Ehrenberg, were the endochrome or colour- 
ing matter of the botanist, which, when ripened into sporidia, escapes through an open- 
ing in the frustule, being one of the methods by which the species are increased.
The 
author also expressed his persuasion, that in the present imperfect state of our know- 
ledge of these objects, great caution ought to be used in advancing any opinio nrespect- 
ina them.

(Continued from p.

Eqtjisetum palustre, var.
polystachion.
The variety of Equisetum palustre which appears to be universally 
known by the name of polystachion^ is at once distinguished by its 
numerous catkins ; these are usually and principally borne on the two 
3g 
594 
upper whorls of branches : the main stem generally terminating in a 
catkin of uniform size with the others, as represented in the figure, 
which is drawn from an exceedingly beautiful specimen, kindly lent 
me by Miss Griffiths.
At other times the stem bears a catkin of the 
normal size and form, while those on the branches are comparatively 
diminutive in size ; for specimens of the latter form I am indebted to 
several kind correspondents, particularly to Mr. Ashworth of Man- 
chester.
Dillenius, in Ray's Synopsis,* gives a very faithful figure of this 
variety ; and several decided although less characteristic figm-es may 
be found in other works.
I may remark that the catkins in this form of the plant are usually 
small, and in the specimens which have come more especially under 
my notice, they are very black and compact, much more so than the 
single apical catkin of the normal form of the plant, and hence they 
much more nearly resemble those of the preceding species : in other 
respects this variety so nearly approaches the normal form, that a more 
minute description appears unnecessary.

â€” On Stalice rarijlora.
By Charles C.
Babington, 
Esq., M.A., F.L.S., F.G.S., &c.
In your last number (Phytol.
561) Mr. Henfrey has determined that 
the Statice found at Fareham by Mr. Notcutt, is the S.
rariflora of 
Drejer ; but he states it to be his opinion that the Garlieston plant is 
different, and only a variety of S.
Limoniura.
Under these circum- 
stances 1 think it as well to state that I have only had the opportunity 
of examining a minute scrap of the former plant, for which 1 am in- 
debted to Mr. Watson, but that, through the kindness of Prof.
Balfour, 
I possess excellent specimens of the latter.
The character of S.
rari- 
flora given in my Manual (p.
244), is drawn from the examination of 
the Scottish specimens, compared with two authentic examples of the 
Danish plant; one of them gathered by Drejer himself, and presented 
to me by M.
Sender of Hamburgh, the other forming No. 2200 of 
Reich.
Fl. Exsic, collected by Steenberg and authenticated by Dre- 
jer.
Both these specimens are small, and have leaves mostly resem- 
bling those of fig.
I, (Phytol.
561) ; whilst the Scottish plant usually 
has long leaves, similar to fig.
5. There is, however, amongst those 
* Syn. t.
5, f.
3. 
595 
sent me by my friend Balfour, one dwarf specimen, agreeing in every 
respect with those from Denmark, in one of which some of the leaves 
are considerably lengthened in proportion to their breadth, whilst the 
Scottish specimen referred to has a leaf (it only possesses two) even 
more ovate-spathulate than in Mr. Henfrey's fig.
1. It is therefore 
evident that the exact form of the leaves cannot be considered as a 
certain chai*acter.
The calyx appears to me to be precisely similar 
in the Scottish and Danish plants, not differing materially from that 
of S.
Limonium ; for I fear that the want of denticulations, upon 
which I have laid some stress in my Manual, will not prove to be a 
constant character.
A reference to the original descriptions, namely, 
that of Drejer in the Fl. Hafn.
121, or of Fries, who gives it as a pro- 
bable species requiring examination, under the name of S.
Limonium 
Bahusiensis, in his Mant.
Prima, 10, will show that no great stress is 
laid by those distinguished botanists upon the form of the leaves or 
upon the calyx, but that the specific definition is founded upon the 
peculiar inflorescence, which is remarkably different in the two plants.
In S.
Limonium the stalk is simple in the lower part, scarcely ever 
dividing below the middle, the branches are very much divided and 
corymbose, and curved outwards into a horizontal or even deflexed 
position, the ultimate divisions are very short, with numerous closely- 
placed subimbricated flowers.
This is the S.
Limonium Scanica of 
Fries (Mant.
Prima, 10), the S.
Behen of Drejer (Fl. Hafn.
122), S.
Limonium, Eng. Bot.
102.
On the other hand, in S.
rariflora the 
stalk is often divided far below the middle, but the branches are less 
compound, not at all corymbose, and rather curve inwards and up- 
wards than outwards and downwards, the ultimate divisions are elon- 
gated and the flowers are at a considerable distance from each other.
Having, as I trust, shown tliat the Scottish plant is the true S.
rari- 
flora, it remains to be determined if the Fareham plant is or is not the 
same ; and I must confess that the acute outer bracts and very nar- 
row calyx-segments now lead me to suspect that it may prove difier- 
ent, in which case it will have to be identified with some continental 
species, or obtain a name as new.
It is right to add, that I have rea- 
son to fear having been the misleader of both Mr. Watson and Mr.
Henfrey, as (if I mistake not) the suggestion that Drejer's name was 
applicable to both the Scottish and English specimens originated with 
me ; still I trust that pardon will be extended to mc, in consideration 
of the fact that Mr. Watson intimated it to be his opinion that the 
plants were identical, and that although possessing good Scottish spe- 
cimens, my example of the Fareham plant consists of five flowers and 
3g 2 
596 
an inch of stalk.
I of course therefore drew my ideas of the species 
from the Scottish plant.

â€” A Flora of the Neighbourhood of Sandringham, 
Norfolk.
By James E.
Moxon, Esq.
Sandringham, a hamlet of western Norfolk, situate about seven 
miles to the northward of Lynn Regis, and intermediate between 
Castle Rising and Snettisham, offers many inducements to the bota- 
nist on account of the number and intei'est of the productions of its 
vicinity, mainly attributable to the variety of soils and situations.
The geological features of this part of England are somewhat pecu- 
liar.
Firstly, there is the chalk ; which, after traversing various coun- 
ties from Sussex, and being broken in upon by the extensive fens and 
marshes of Cambridgeshire, and of that part of Norfolk, denominated 
" marshland," again appears in the neighbourhood of Downham, and, 
occupying the most elevated portions of this part of the county, termi- 
nates at Hunstanton, its north-western extremity, situated at the en- 
trance of the Wash, an extensive inlet of the German Ocean.
Secondly, 
the silt, a marine deposit, occupying all the lower parts and valleys along 
the coast, and extending in some instances to a considerable distance 
inland.
And thirdly, between this latter and the chalk, occurs the 
greensand fonnation, also a continuation of the Sussex beds, and ter- 
minating likewise at Hunstanton.
Behind the chalk, a series of non- 
fossiliferous marls and clays extends in the direction of the interior of 
the county.
In addition to this series of strata, the immediate neigh- 
bourhood of Sandringham offers a variety of localities.
Heath, fen, 
marsh, woods, cultivated lands, meadows and hedge-rows, all nourish- 
ing their peculiar species, are spread around.
Add to this the variety 
of soils ; sand, clay, marl, loam, chalk and gravel, and likewise the 
sea-shore, shingly, sandy, and muddy ; the salt marshes and ditches 
at Wolferton, Babingley &c.
; and the river at Castle Rising ; â€” all 
combine to render this a district abounding alike in rare and uncom- 
mon plants, as (considering its limits) in the number of species.
Nor 
is this all ; for lastly, the undulating character of the country in gene- 
ral, adds further to all these desiderata.
The size of the district examined, and to which the accompanying 
597 
catalogue solely applies, is included within a radius of about three 
miles from Sandringham church.
The following are its boundaries : 
â€” Northwards, Snettisham; East, the Friug and Harpley road, Anmer, 
Flitcham, Hillington, Congham ; South, Roydon (including the fen), 
Wootton-heath and North Wootton ; and to the West, the sea-coast 
as far north as Caen-hill wood, near Snettisham.
To avoid a more lengthened description, the nature of its general 
surface and the predominating vegetation, may be concisely defined as 
follows.

lia &c.
Chenopodium album, Stellaria me-

vulgaris, Poa annua, &c.
The general accordance of these divisions with the position of the 
geological strata is also worthy of remark ; the cultivated lands and 
pastures lying chiefly upon the chalk formation, the heaths and com- 
mons upon the greensand, and the marshes upon the silt.
In conclusion, the following tables will serve to illastrate the bota-

â€” Journal of a short run into Badenoch, Strathspey, 
^c, from the \bth to the 2lst of April, 1843.
By Mr. J.
B. 
B RICH AN.
Grantown, April 17, 1843.
Dear Sir, 
I am at present on my return from a very short sojourn 
in Badenoch ; and certainly the season of the year, and the weather 
when I left home, afford little or no foundation on which to construct 
any sort of article whatever for a botanical journal.
It is quite possi- 
ble, however, that the very negation of Botany may be made somewhat 
interesting to the lovers of Flora, especially if it be merely a temporary 
602 
negation, the effect of climate and season on the vegetable produc- 
tions of a district in which, as the season advances, the hills and vales 
are thickly clad with 
" Bells and flow'rets of a thousand hues." 
And such is the romantic Highland district in vs^hich I have just been.
The day before I entered it was bleak and wintry, and I was glad to 
get myself housed for the night at Carr Bridge.
Next day was fresh 
and mild, and the snow, which but the day before gave to everything 
the appearance of winter, now only chequered mountain and plain, 
and was fast yielding to the genial breath of what was really spring 
weather.
Still, however, except where a small spot appeared in the 
shape of a garden, no green thing but " the evergreen pine " cheered 
the sight that was longing for the sweet gems of spring.
And perhaps 
a more dismal spectacle could scarcely meet a botanist's eye, than the 
one I witnessed between Carr Bridge and Aviemore.
The southern 
slope of a tolerably high and rocky hill, was thinly sprinkled with 
blasted firs, the remains of a forest consumed by fire, or dead from the 
sterility of the soil.
It was some alleviation of the dreariness of such 
a sight, that on each side of the road the native birch, yet scarcely 
throwing out a catkin, scented the air with its peculiar odour.
As I 
went on, with the magnificent group of the Cairngorms, partly clad in 
snow, on the one hand, and bleak rocky hills on the other, the wide 
wooded valley of Rothiemurchus spread before me, and waiting, as it 
were, " in the hope of summer eves," â€” I could not help thinking, and 
being delighted with the thought, how many a beautiful flower the 
summer's heat would call forth from the mountain cleft, and the slop- 
ing woodland, and the rich alluvial plain ; and with what ecstacy I â€” 
for I might be there â€” would cull the precious gems, and breast the 
mountain side in search of health, and beauty, and that peculiar plea- 
sure which only botanists know.
As I entered Badenoch, the air was balmy as summer.
The hea- 
ther â€” I prefer the word to the English heath â€” " exhaled its perfume," 
although far from its season of purple bells ; and the birch, the pre- 
vailing natural wood of the district, grew more thickly on every side 
of me.
â–  Here and there, a few alders and hazels were hanging out 
their tassels, and a willow occasionally exhibited its golden flowers.
The beautiful and romantic Loch Alvie was slightly curled by the 
breeze, but its vegetation as yet exhibited no signs of life.
A few wi- 
thered reeds were all that remained to show that a single green thing 
had ever reared its head above its waters.
As I drove along the foot 
of a wooded slope opposite Loch Insh, a solitary primrose cheered 
603 
my sight.
It was the only wild thing in the shape of a flower that 1 
had seen since I left Morayshire.
Between Loch Insh and Kingussie 
there stretches a vast alluvial plain, in which are dug up the roots and 
trunks of fir trees, known in Scotland by the name of " moss fir." It 
is well known that the whole district was once covered with pine.
Kingussie signifies "the head of the fir-wood," and Badenoch, "a clump 
or patch of trees." The plain must have formed, at one time, the 
bottom of a lake, of which Loch Insh is all that remains.
The weather, as I returned to-day, was equally delightful as be- 
fore, and wood, and moor, and mountain, seemed " to listen for the 
rustle of their leaves." Vanessa Urtica), our earliest butterfly, flutter- 
ed around me in considerable numbers.
The district, in point of cli- 
mate, seems not far behind the " How of Moray." Another week, or 
fortnight at most, would bring it up to the point which the lower and 
more temperate district had reached when I left it.
The Cairngorm group has frequently witnessed the enthusiastic 
rambler after " weeds " scaling its craggy sides, gathering its treasures, 
and laving his burning brow or parched throat in its cool and delicious 
fountains.
I am not aware that the district of Badenoch has often 
been botanically perlustrated ; but I am quite sure that its richly va- 
ried scenery â€” the extensive plain alluded to â€” its inferior ranges of 
hills â€” the rocky steeps of the "wild and majestic" Craig-dhu â€” the 
sweet sequestered Loch Uvie â€” and the beautiful Loch Laggan, 
which, though not so large or so well known, may vie with Lochness â€” 
would afford to the botanist who could devote a summer month to its 
examination, as rich a treat and as abundant a harvest as any other 
part of " the stern Scottish Highlands." 
April 18.
â€” Dalnashauch Inn, near Bridge of Avon.
I have just 
passed over fourteen miles of excellent road between Grantown and 
this uncouthly named locality ; and I must bother you a little more 
with almost the same negation of Botany which at present chsuractcr- 
izes the district above described, and my description thereof.
I am 
near the wildly situated Bridge of Avon (pronounced Awn), and hear 
the unceasing sound of that rapid mountain toiTcnt which issues from 
Loch Avon, at the foot of Scotland's highest hill â€” Ben-mac-dui, and 
of which the honest old farmer, mentioned in Sir T.
Lauder's 'Moray- 
shire Floods,' said, alluding to a piece of ground of which the Avon 
had just deprived him, "I took it frae the Avon, and let the Avon hae 
its ain again." Certainly this has very little to do with Botany, and 
amounts to something very like a negation of it.
But that I may not 
be altogether barren on the subject that is dear to all phyloloijicai 
604 
hearts, let me just say that the beautiful drive 1 have last accomplish- 
ed exhibits, as the prevailing natural production of Strathspey, " the 
gay green birk," at present of course quite purple â€” that there is a 
considerable degree of wild Highland grandeur in the immense slope 
between Castle Grant and the Spey, which is thickly clothed with 
Scotland's own pine â€” and that all along that winding, deep and rapid 
river, from Grantown to Ballindalloch, " the alders dank that fringe 
the pool " assert their peculiar right to the river's margin, and are at 
this moment clad with a profusion of brown or yellow catkins.
The 
larch, which is planted in great abundance along the hilly slopes, is 
now throwing out its " tassels red " and sweet virgin green leaves.
Its 
flowers are sometimes white â€” qucere, why } They are here, as in Ba- 
denoch, though I have not mentioned them in my notes on that dis- 
trict, a week or a fortnight behind those in Moray's balmiest spot â€” 
Forres.
I think I saw, about half way between this and Grantown, 
one solitary flower of Anemone nemorosa.
In the church-yard of Cromdale, three miles and a half from Gran- 
town, lie the remains of M â€” C â€” , one of the sweetest flowers ever 
bom in the Highlands, and transplanted to the lower part of the "Pro- 
vince." I crave this passing tribute to the memory of one, with whose 
survdving amiable sisters I am proud to say I am on intimate terms.
In April, 1839, I accompanied her remains from Nairn to the inte- 
resting spot where they are now mouldering in silent dust.
The wea- 
ther, although it was later in the month than this, was keenly frosty, 
and the interests of the vegetable kingdom were as far from my 
thoughts as its beauties were from their summer perfection.
At the 
moment I write, nothing is wanting to complete the interest of the 
landscape, but the green grass, the blooming heather, and the sum- 
mer foliage of the forest.
My yesterday's friend, Vanessa Urticae, 
still flits across my path, enjoying Nature's hour of balm ; and that 
big, humming, or, as we call him in Scotland, humming, fellow.
Bom- 
bus terrestris, wings his way as briskly as if summer itself were invi- 
gorating his powers of flight.
The beauties of Strathspey are great, 
but they are "tame and domestic" in comparison with those of Bade- 
noch.
Let botanists visit Clova, if they will â€” but why not run a little 
farther north ?
Manse of Kirkmichael.
â€” April 18, ^ to 11, P.M. Although half 
asleep, I cannot resist the temptation I feel to teaze you with the very 
important information that I left Dalnashauch to-day about 1 o'clock, 
and after crossing the lower extremity of Glenlivet, proceeded up the 
Avon through what is called Strathdown.
About six miles of my 
605 
road was so narrow that two vehicles could scarcely pass each other, 
with a steep slope above and below, the only protection against an 
overthrow being the natural birch-wood which skirted the way.
The 
alder too was there.
Strathdown is a narrow, wild, romantic valley, 
through which runs the beautifully clear Avon, and about the middle 
of which, on a bank of the river, some hundred feet above its bed, is 
situated the manse of Kirkmichael, from which I now write.
The 
view from this spot is delightful, comprehending the summits of Cairn- 
gorm and Benavon â€” the climate not inferior to that of any part of my 
route above described.
The ceaseless sough of the Avon here also 
greets my ear, and reminds me of my late residence on the banks of 
the Dee, which, in the colour and clearness of its waters it strongly 
resembles.
In the dining room immediately below me is a flower-pot 
containing a few plants of mignonette in full flower.
The seed was 
sown last spring â€” the young plants appeared in autumn â€” and the 
sweet-scented favourite of ladies and of bees has been in flower all 
the winter.
Good night.
April 19.
â€” I drove to-day to Tomintoul, six miles farther up the 
Avon than Kirkmichael, and within about twenty miles both of Bal- 
later and Braemar, but could see nothing to neutralize the same mo- 
notonous negation of Botany I have already experienced, except a 
flower or two of Tussilago Farfara, which has been in blossom for the 
last month.
Such, however, is the mildness of the season, that I have 
observed since yesterday a marked difference in the buds of the trees, 
now fast opening into green leaves.
April 20.
â€” I am again at Dalnashauch.
In my downward progress 
hitherward the only additional harbinger of summer that I observed 
was the bog-myrtle ; all other things are in statu quo.
I am about 
to proceed down the Spey to Rothes, to leave for the present â€” per- 
haps for ever â€” the interesting scenes through which I have passed, 
and which, though at all times worth seeing, are at this moment but 
opening into that state of mingled beauty, and sweetness, and gran- 
deur, in which the devotee of phytological science finds his most ap- 
propriate and most delightful walk.
Forres.
â€” April 21.
The drive down the Spey from Inveravon to 
Craigellachie is partly through a bleak moorland tract, lying at the 
foot of Belrinnes, and partly through one lower and more cultivated, 
in which lie the church, manse and village of Aberlour, and in which, 
near the river-side, I saw, as evidences of the warmer temperature, 
patches of Anemone nemorosa on one side of the road, and low green 
meadows on the other.
The iron bridge at Craigellachie is a fine 
606 
specimen of art : at its northern extremity, where the road, at right 
angles to the line of the bridge, and parallel to the course of the river, 
is cut out of the face of a solid rock, grows Galium boreale, at this 
season scarcely visible.
At this point I re-entered my own county â€” 
Moray.
Two miles farther down lies the beautifully situated village 
of Rothes, with its old castle, romantic hum and fertile fields.
On 
the inverted root of a tree, lying above a heap of stones, I observed a 
single head of Lamium purpureum, one of the earliest flowering and 
by no means least beautiful plants in the climate of Moray.
I left Rothes to-day â€” the weather still very fine.
As I approached 
Elgin, the difierence in the progress of the larch towards its summer 
foliage, began distinctly to appear ; and Ulex europaeus, now nearly 
in full bloom, showed the superior mildness of the climate of the 
" How of Moray." The gardens and shrubberies were half clad in 
green.
After resting an hour or two, 1 left Elgin, passed the pine- 
clad Knock of Alves, the well-known station of the beautiful Linnaea, 
and was soon once more in Forres, where a week ago everything wore 
the appearance of winter, but where everything now is smiling into 
summer sweetness, and where, both in summer and winter, there 
blooms many a tender " bell and flow'ret," that may well vie with 
England's fairest.
I am, Dear Sir, 
Your's faithfully, 
J. B.
Brichan.

New South Wales.
â€” The continent of New Holland, as far as vi- 
sited by James Backhouse, seems less attractive to a botanist than the 
adjacent islands ; still there is sufficient to invest it with an interest 
surpassing that possessed by most other countries with which we are 
on a similar footing of familiarity.
There is nothing to compare with 
the gigantic forests which form so distinguishing a character of Tas- 
mania, or with the wild luxuriance of Norfolk Island ; yet the pines 
to which that island has given a name, may be seen, even at Sydney, 
towering here and there above the surrounding scenery, and proclaim- 
ing a climate different from our own ; and there is a host of trees and 
plants altogether distinct from those of Tasmania.
607 
On new-year's day, 1835, many beautiful native shrubs were in 
flower, including Lambertia formosa, Grevillea buxifolia and sericea, 
Epacris grandiflora, &c.: these grow in heathy soil, on the bushy 
ground covering the sandstone.
January 15.
â€” "We walked to Elizabeth Bay, and met the Colonial Secretary* at 
his beautiful garden, which is formed on a rocky slope, on the margin of Port Jack- 
son, of which it commands a fine view.
Here are cultivated specimens of many of the 
interesting trees and shrubs of this colony, along with others from various parts of the 
world, intermixed with some growing in their native localities.
Among the last, is a 
fine old rusty-leaved fig-tree, Ficus ferruginea, which is an evergreen, and has laurel-like 
leaves.
A noble specimen of Acrostichum grande, a fern of very remarkable structure, 
from Moreton Bay, is attached to a log of wood, and secured by a chain to a limb of this 
fig-tree.
The walks at this place are judiciously accommodated to the inequalities of 
the sinuous bay, and are continued round a point covered with native bush.
Peaches 
are ripe in the open ground in abundance, and liberty to partake of them freely was kindly 
given by the open-hearted proprietor.
Dendrobium speciosum and linguiforme, re- 
markable plants of the Orchis tribe, are wild here, upon the rocks ; and D.
tetragonum 
is naturalized on a branch of Avicenna tomentosa, covered with rock-oyster shells, and 
suspended in a tree near the shore.
A fine patch of the elks-horn fern, Acrostichum 
alcicome, retains its native station on a rocky point in the garden." â€” p.
239.
In a walk by the north shore on January 27, our traveller observed 
an old bushy fig-tree overhanging the water, some of its limbs almost 
covered with Acrostichum alcicorne and Dendrobium linguiforme; 
but we pass on to a description of Botany Bay, the accoimt of which 
is less inviting than its far-famed name would lead us to anticipate, 
still not without instruction.
" Botany Bay, with its gay shrubs, might wear an imposing aspect to the first na- 
vigators of these seas, after a tedious voyage ; but its shores are shallow, and not con- 
venient for landing, and most of the laud on the north side, is dreary sand and marsh, 
of little real value.
The pieces that are worth anything, are of very limited extent, 
and are in few hands.
One of the proprietors has established a woollen manufactory, 
which, from the price of labour in this country, is not likely to pay.
He told us that 
the leaves of the wooden-pear, Xylomelum pyriforme, dye wool yellow, and that the 
branches of Leptospennum scoparium, answer the purposes of fustic-wood, and dye 
fawn-colour.
A handsome species of grass-tree, Xanthorrhoea arborea, was in flower, 
in some of the sandy grounds ; its root-stocks were surmounted by an elegant crest of 
rush-like leaves; from the centre of which the flower-stem arose to ten feet in height; 
somewhat less than the upper half of this, was densely covered with brown scales, giv- 
ing it an appearance something like a bull-rush.
From amongst these scales the 
small, white, star-like flowers emerged, as in the other species of this genus.
The 
plants with large root-stocks had been destroyed, for fuel, for which purpose they are 
much valued.

lax glyciphylla, abouiuls.
It is a low, climbing plant, with navvow, heart-shaped 
leaves, having a taste something like Spanish liquorice.
It was used instead of tea, 
by the early settlers,, and formed the chief ingredient in their drink, on occasions of 
rej oicing." â€” p.
29 1 .
The following notices of Zamia spiralis and three species of Loran- 
thus are interesting.
July 18.
â€” " In a bushy hollow we met with Zamia spiralis, a singular, palm-like 
plant, in fruit.
The whole fruit has some resemblance to a pine-apple ; but large 
nuts, in red coats, are fixed under the scales forming the outside.
The Blacks place 
these nuts under stones, at the bottom of water, in order to extract some noxious prin- 
ciple from them ; they are afterwards converted into food.
In wet weather, an insipid, 
jelly-like gum, which is wholesome, and not unpalateable, exudes from the plant.
"20th.
Three species of the genus Loranthus, which consists of plants allied to 
mistletoe, grow parasitically on trees in this neighbourhood.
They have handsome 
blossoms, a little like honey-suckle, but with more green, than yellow or red in them.
Two of them have external roots, adhering to the bark of the trees that support them, 
and incorporating themselves with it ; but occasionally, one of these species happens 
to grow upon the other, and then it emits no external root!
This is a striking instance 
of that power, sometimes exhibited by a plant, to adapt itself to circumstances, and 
which is called vegetable instinct." â€” p.
294.
The question of specific identity between the productions of coun- 
tries so widely separated as Britain and her Australian possessions, is 
one of great and increasing interest.
And when we find the plants 
and insects of a far distant land named unhesitatingly as identical 
with our own, we are apt to feel a desire for a more detailed explana- 
tion.
We learn from the 'Narrative' before us, that "on the margins 
of the pools of the Bell River, there are reeds, â€” Arundo Phragraites, 
bull-rushes, â€” Typha latifolia, and some other aquatic plants, similar 
to those of England." Are we to infer that these are the aboriginal 
denizens of the spot, or have their seeds been accidentally introduced 
from the mother country ?
They occur in the valley of Wellington, 
formerly a penal settlement for educated prisoners, and still the resi- 
dence of European missionaries.
On the afternoon of the 25th of September our traveller, still in 
Wellington Valley, ascended a hill about 500 feet high ; fi'om the 
summit is an extensive view over the adjoining country, which seems 
to be a continuation of open forest hills, many of them black and bare 
fi'om fire.
" On the upper portion, there were she-oak, Casuarina quadrivalvis, and Grammitis 
rutaefolius, a small fern, both of which are common in V.
D. Land, also a Cycas ?
a re- 
markable Eucalyptus, and Sterculia diversifolia.
Upon the last, there was a remark- 
able Viscum, or mistletoe.
Lower down the hill, the beautiful Acacia venusta formed a 
bush about six feet high ; it bears heads of small, globular, golden blossoms." â€” p.

Note on the absence of Jasione montana and Verbena offici- 
nalis from the vicinity of Edinburgh.
I was much surprised to see 
from the 2nd edition of the Edinburgh 'Catalogue of British Plants,' 
that neither Jasione montana nor Verbena officinalis have been found 
â– within thirty miles of that city.
Not having been in Scotland, 1 can- 
not say whether this is correct, but to us Southrons it seems odd.
The 
absence of plants, usually common, though not so striking to the eye, 
is, or ought to be, nearly as interesting as the presence of others usu- 
ally rare.

Note on British Plants occurring in fweign countries.
It 
would be extremely interesting if some botanist would publish a list 
of English plants, with the foreign countries in which they are found.
The information might be taken from Don's book, as far as that book 
extends.
Myrrhis odorata grows in Spain, although I have not met 
with it in England south of Derbyshire, nor do I find it in any of 
your southern local lists.

[The above note by Mr. Sparkes affords us an opportunity of mentioning Mr. Wat- 
son's admirable work on ' The Geographical Distribution of British Plants,' the first 
part of which, containing the Ranunculaceae, appeared in the early part of the present 
year.
Being printed for private distribution only, we have hitherto hesitated to give a 
detailed notice of this book ; but our scruples having been removed by the perusal of 
a notice of a previous work on the same subject by Mr. Watson, in Loudon's ' Maga- 
zine of Natural History,' we hope, in an early number, to endeavour to do justice to 
its merits.
About a dozen years ago, we received specimens of Myrrhis odorata, col- 
lected in a pasture field near Chipstead, Surrey, by a young lady, who stated that it 
was plentiful in the locality, although not cultivated in that neighbourhood.

Note on Statlce rarijlora.
Mr. Notcatt's Slatice (Phytol.

and 492) is, I perceive, regarded as a distinct species by some of the 
continental botanists.
Specimens have recently been published in 
Reichenbach's 'Flora Germ.

Note on Smilacina hifolia.
I think it has not been noticed 
in ' The Phytologist,' that Smilacina bifolia was long ago reckoned a 
British plant, although the fact has been brought forward by Mr. E.
Forbes, in Taylor's ' Annals ' for February.
Parkinson says, " It 
groweth in moist shedowie and grassie places of woods, in many pla- 
ces of the Realm," (Theatr.
505); and in Ger. Em.
409, it is stated to 
grow " In Lancashire, in Dingley wood six miles from Preston in 
Aundernesse ; and in Hai'wood neere to Blackeburne likewise." â€” Id.
[The following is the Note referred to by Mr. Borrer.
â€” " Maianthemum bifolium.
This very pretty plant, recorded as British in the ' Annals ' for January, is a rediscovery, 
and not altogether new to the British Flora.
It has been already figured and recorded 
as English, but a long while ago.
In Gerarde's ' Herbal,' 2nd book, 90th chap.
p. 40c), 
will be found a very characteristic portrait of it under the name of Monophyllum or 
One blade.
He classes it with his Wintergreenes (Pyrolae), and says " it groweth in 
Lancashire in Dingley Wood, six miles from Preston in Auldirnesse, and in Harwood 
near Blackburne likewise." " It floureth in May, and the fruit is ripe in September." 
Let the Lancashire botanists look out for it next spring.
It is strange that Gerarde's 
notice of it should have escaped our older botanists ; and stranger still, that in the 
Linnean Society's copy it is marked " Convallaria hifolia" in Sir James E.
Smith's 
own handwriting, apparently without his having noticed the localities given for it be- 
low.
In the south of Norway it is very abundant in pine-woods on a gneiss soil, and 
should be looked for in similar situations in the north of Britain.

Dicranuni iaxifolimn and adiantoides.
Besides the characters 
given in ' Muscologia Britannica,' these two species are distinguished 
by the following peculiarities.
D. taxifolium has the stem constantly 
unbranched, except perhaps at the very base ; leaves linear-lanceo- 
late, the upper margin presenting a regular unbroken curve line ; pe- 
ristome inserted considerably below the mouth of the capsule ; ca- 
lyptra with an inflexed margin at the base.
In all these particulars 
D. adiantoides exhibits a perfect contrast, when not in a dwarf state : 
sometimes indeed the latter has simple stems, but the outline of the 
leaves would always be sufficient, of itself, to indicate the species.
Moreover, the teeth of the peristome, in D.
taxifolium, are more sud- 
denly contracted above into long slender points, and they are beset 
612 
externally with prominent transverse bars.
The texture of the leaves 
and of the capsule is more dense and ojjaque, and the perichsetial leaves 
and vaginula are considerably longer than in D.
adiantoides.
In a 
diied state also the two mosses have a different aspect, the foliage of 
D. taxifolium being less disposed to curl.
I have never observed any 
such ambiguities as those vrhich are pointed out by Mr. Sidebotham, 
(Phytol.581).â€” fF.
Wilson; Orforcl Mount, Warrington, May 5, 1843.

Dicratmm osmundioides and hryoides.
The difference existing 
between these two species was long ago indicated by Meyrin, but his 
observations have been overlooked.
The former of these two mosses 
has the calyptra mitriform, with the margin at the base inflexed.
In 
D. bryoides the calyptra is constantly dimidiate, and the leaf has a 
colourless cartilaginous border ; characters which would be amply 
sufficient to distinguish the two species, even if their mutual resem- 
blance were greater than it is.
They differ also in the form of the 
capsule, and in the shape of the leaves.
I may here remark that the 
blending of these two species, in ' Muscologia Britannica,' is solely 
attributable to their not having been compared together with due de- 
liberation.
Some species, in order to be properly understood, must 
be patiently studied in a living state, and at various stages of growth.
If such a method be observed, the student will have no difficulty in 
persuading himself of the validity of those distinctions by which 
Polytrichum commune is separated from P.
gracile, P.
aloides from 
P. nanum, and Orthotrichum Rogeri from O.
affine.â€” Id.

Calla ^thiopica, L.
One evening in April my attention was 
forcibly drawn to this plant (then in the parlour, not covered by glass), 
as it was copiously distilling water from the tips of its leaves.
The 
evening gave no signs of an atmosphere overcharged with moisture, 
and at night the stars shone with brilliance.
The roots of the plant 
had been well supplied with water in the forenoon.
Mr. Quekett's 
admirable paper (Phytol.
218) recurred to mind, and I was induced 
to examine closely a phenomenon which presented itself to my no- 
tice for the first time, and in circumstances where I could not expect 
to see it.
The exudation was observed on such leaves only as had 
the upper portion of the cylindrical points faded and discoloured, 
the line of demarcation between the faded and the living part indi- 
cating the spot where the fluid escaped ; in every other respect the 
position of the outlet was altogether indeterminate, some leaves dis- 
charging their fluid at the base of the cylindrical point, others at a 
spot still lower down, and one at a considerable distance from the 
top, but close to the margin of the leaf, at a part which had become 
613 
discoloured.
This led me to examine carefully the so-termed " mar- 
ginal vein," which proved to be an open continuous channel of pe- 
culiar structure, extending from the base to the top of the leaf, alto- 
gether different from the vascular tissue constituting the proper veins, 
but no doubt in communication with them, and serving as the reci- 
pient and conductor of the fluid conveyed by them from the root.
It is sufliciently wide to admit a bristle, which may be passed up it 
without the aid of a lens.
On cutting a leaf across with scissors, the 
fluid escaped from the midrib and veins, but less plentifully than from 
the marginal channels.
One leaf, which had recently expanded, and 
had its cylindrical point unfaded at the extremity, did not give out 
any fluid, nor was there any escape from the flower : with a micro- 
scope I could not detect any pore or valve, such as is stated to exist 
in Limnocharis Plumieri ; hence I am inclined to infer that the exu- 
dation does not take place, even in a close humid atmosphere, until 
some previous natural decay of the cylindrical point of the leaf.
Those who have the means of proving the contrary are requested to 
pursue the enquiry.
It may be proper to add that an escape of fluid 
was observed at the back of two of the leaves, whose extremities 
were so curled as to admit of a lodgment of the water in that position, 
and that a quantity of the fluid, collected on glass and suffered to eva- 
porate, left behind it only faint traces of mucilaginous matter.
The 
opinion entertained by some, that spiral vessels convey air and not 
fluid, will derive little support from an examination of this plant.â€” /^L

On the buds of Rohinia Pseudacacia.
One fine evening last 
summer, during one of those welcome intervals of relaxation which 
are afforded by the visits of an esteemed friend, we happened to stroll 
under the shade of this tree, when a happy collision of ideas directed 
our joint attention to its well-known property of suddenly, putting 
forth its foliage, late in the spring, without any previous warning.
On cutting across one of the petioles, near its base, with a sharp pen- 
knife, I was struck with the appearance of an open cavity lined with 
stiff" white pubescence ; and as there was no trace of an external ax- 
illary bud, it instantly occurred to us that this tree resembled Platanus 
in its mode of vegetation.
Longitudinal sections of this part were 
forthwith submitted to the microscope, when lo !
instead of a solitary 
bud, no less than three were contained in the hollow base of each 
petiole, one placed immediately below the other, the lowest in a state 
of less perfect formation.
It remained to enquire, at the proper sea- 
son, whether or not two of the three buds were abortive, and I have 
recently directed my attention to this matter.
The uppermost bud, 
614 
being the largest and most vigorous, is that which, in ordinary circum- 
stances, develops itself into a branch ; but the one below it does cer- 
tainly vegetate, and is visibly protruded from the cavity, so as to 
indicate a capability of immediately replacing the upper one, if that 
should be destroyed by frost or other accident.
I wish some of your 
correspondents would examine other species, and also the Platanus.
Professor Nuttall informs me that this mode of producing buds occurs 
in Psidium.
May it not be a general property of tropical trees which 
do not form visible external winter-buds ?
â€” Id.
307.
On the buds of Conifer<B.
Unlike dicotyledonous trees, which 
invariably produce a bud at the base of every leaf, either axillary or 
intra-petiolar, the Coniferae have the greater part of their leaves des- 
titute of buds, which are comparatively few, and scattered at distant 
intervals along the branches.
On the axis of trees of this order, the 
branches exhibit a tendency to develope themselves in a peculiar 
manner, so that the tribe is characterised by the pyramidal or conical 
shape of the individuals belonging to it.
No dicotyledonous tree, 
that I know of, produces its branches in whorls, such as we see in 
Pinus and Abies.
Can any of your readers inform me of an excep- 
tion to the rule in these genera ; and whether any other genus is 
confonnable to it ?
In Larix this tendency does not appear to exist ; 
it is not very obvious in Taxus ; and even in full grown trees of Pi- 
nus sylvestris it seems to be absent.

Vinca major.
This appears to be one of the connecting links 
between the Apocynaceae and the Asclepiadaceae.
No British author 
seems to have accurately described the pistillum, which has a very 
curious structure.
The so-called stigma, described in Smith's ' Eng- 
lish Flora,' although it bears considerable resemblance to a genuine 
stigma, cannot be considered to be such in reality, destitute as it is 
of stigmatic fluid, and moreover surrounded and fenced by a copious 
fringe of rough hairs forbidding the access of pollen.
The style, 
with its appendages, is spindle-shaped, much and suddenly dilated 
in the thickened part, where there is a flattened edge nearly covered 
with a dense pubescence, under which is an orange-coloured reflexed 
membranous zone, covered with viscous fluid, and constituting, wholly 
or in part, the true stigma.
The remainder of the style above the 
thickened part appears principally to serve the office of a pillar, to 
support a canopy formed of the crested extremities of the anthers, 
whose cells are lower in position than the stigma of Su ith, but higher 
than the true stigma, the extent of which is somewhat doubtful.
It 
may either comprehend the whole edge of the thickened part, which 
615 
has the pubescent zone imbued with the viscous fluid, abounding with 
active molecules, and easily diffusible in water ; or it may consist 
only of the reflexed orange border underneath.
The latter is i;pn- 
dered highly probable by the fact that pollen grains are constantly 
found attached to this part with their tubes fully developed, and some 
of them in positions scarcely accessible were it not for the curved 
form of the filaments, which give a favourable direction to the pollen 
as it falls from the anther.
The central tissue, from this part to the 
base of the style, is composed of very slightly cohering oblong cells, 
of the same orange colour ; and the whole may be compared to a 
funnel with a long narrow stalk, lying betvreen two bundles of vascu- 
lar tissue, which perforate the expanded part of the funnel on two 
opposite sides, and then pass up into the region above the true stigma, 
where they become greatly expanded and multiplied, so as to form a 
cylindrical congeries of spiral vessels, whose dark colour might lead 
to the supposition that they contained air, if it were not that there is 
no appearance of extricated bubbles on pressing portions of them 
when immersed in water.
A portion of the placenta has the same 
orange tint, and is probably a continuation of the stigmatic tissue ; 
but I sought in vain for pollen tubes in this region, and indeed they 
were not visible in the style, where they would have been so conspi- 
cuous had they been present.
It may be that fecundation in this 
plant is of rare occun-ence.

The

The spirally lined woody 
cells I believe to be perfectly distinct from the small oblique glands 
which are .supposed to be situated between the spires, and 1 consider 
616 
iLat the glands belong entirely to the medullary rays, on which they 
are placed obliquely, and somewhat prominent beyond the membrane

Note on the Locality of P<Bonia Corallina.
I observed this 
plant gTowing in the rocky clefts of the Steep Holmes, in the Severn, 
in the summer of 1836, but it was then nearly destroyed by destruc- 
tive visitors.
When first added to the English Flora by the late Sir 
Francis B.
Wright, in 1803, he observed it growing in great plenty on 
the island.
A solitary plant was some time since observed growing 
in the centre of a large wood near Bath, Somerset, by Miss Lonsdale; 
but I am informed it has recently been dug up.

Note on Centranthus Calcitrapa.
In your September No.
(Phytol.
309) appeared a critique by Mr. Babington, on some of the 
contents of the last Edinburgh Catalogue of phsenogamous plants.
Among other subjects, allusion is made to Centranthus Calcitrapa, in 
the following woi'ds: â€” "This has but slender claims to be considered 
a British plant, as it has only been found, in a naturalized state, at 
Eltham (.?) in Kent." I do not presume to question the opinion of 
this eminent botanist, as to the slight claims possessed by this plant 
to rank among our native productions.
The note of interrogation 
probably implies a doubt as to the exact locality in which the plant 
617 
has been found ; 1 have therefore to inform your readers, that 1 met 
with it growing abundantly on the walls of Eltham church-yard, Kent, 
and on the walls of several gardens to the east of the church, about 
the middle of last June.
After reading Mr, Babington's remarks on 
the subject, I went again to Eltham, in order to trace out, if possible, 
the source from whence this plant found its way to the above station.
A gardener, of many years' standing at Eltham, had often seen it 
growing there, on walls, and had sometimes known it to spring up, 
self-sown, in gardens near the old palace; but was not aware that it 
had ever been cultivated in any gardens adjoining the church.
Its 
inconspicuous size would not render it a very great favourite for the 
flower-border.
He thought it likely that it might have been cultivat- 
ed in a botanic garden, which long ago existed near the church ; and 
that it might have escaped thence to the neighbouring walls.
It is 
noticed in the ' Flora Metropolitana,' as being found on old walls at 
Eltham, on the authority of Mr. Wm.
Pamplin.
I accordingly wrote 
to Mr. Pamplin about it, and give the following extract from his 
prompt and obliging reply.
" It is at least twenty years ago when I 
first gathered the Valeriana Calcitrapa at Eltham." " It was to Mr.
Hewett C.
Watson's Botanical Guide that I communicated the parti- 
culars above referred to, and I suppose it was from thence copied into 
Cooper's ' Flora Metropolitana.' In my communication to Mr. Wat- 
son's Guide, I ventured to suggest that this plant (so admirably adapt- 
ed, with its feathery wings, for dispersion) might have escaped from 
Sherard's botanical garden at Eltham, originally, which I still think 
was most likely the fact." At any rate, whether indigenous or not, 
or whether likely or not to become extensively disseminated, it is a 
pretty and interesting httle plant, and worthy of a place in the herba- 
ria of our metropolitan botanists ; who will, I have no doubt, if they 
extend their excursions to Eltham, find it very plentiful on many of 
the old walls near the church.

On the habitats of Equiseium Jluviatile.
We have now be- 
fore us two accounts of the habitats of Equisetum fluviatile ; and as 
the two are so much at variance, and as it appears to me that the ha- 
bits of that plant are not well understood, I hope I shall not be thought 
presumptuous in offering a few remarks on the subject.
In the first 
place, Mr. Newman tells us that the plant " affects loose gravelly and 
sandy places, unconnected with water," (Phytol.
533).
In the second 
place, Mr. Watson states, that so far as his observations go, when the 
plant grows in corn-fields and other places out of water, it is always 
618 
short and stunted ; on the other hand, he says that the finest exam- 
ples he has met with, were in the counties of Chester and Lancaster, 
^^ growing on the red marl^'' (Id. 588).
Mr. Watson also relates some 
strange tales about the Cheshire horses getting " bogged," in their 
endeavours to graze on the plant ; and that he (Mr. Watson) has seen 
a horse almost over head in mud, in a small pond (perhaps a mud- 
pond) filled with the tall horse-tails.
I do not wish to contradict Mr.
Watson, but merely to say that water or mud is not essential to the 
luxuriant growth of Equisetum fluviatile.
At Broad-bank, four miles 
from Coin, in Lancashire, in a plot of ground which is appropriated 
to the growth of potatoes, we have the plant growing much higher 
than the fences.
At Midge Hool, neai" Todmorden, we have it grow- 
ing very fine, in a wood.
And I think I shall be correct in saying 
that the plant is not common in the ponds in Lancashire, as I have 
been in the habit of visiting them for the last sixteen years, and never 
met with it in any of them.
In the Manchester Flora, it is said to 
grow in "moist woods and hedge-banks, common." In the Yorkshire 
Flora there are four stations for E.
fluviatile,â€” two of them in woods, 
and one of the others by a road-side.
Francis observes that " the 
name Jluviatile is not so applicable to this species as it would have 
been to some of the others, as it is rarely found on the banks of rivers 
or in ponds, nor do I remember ever having seen it growing in water." 
Withering, Smith and Hooker, say the plant grows on the banks of 
rivers, lakes, &c.
Something might be said on the red marl, but as 
' The Phytologist ' is no medium for Geology, I will omit that altoge- 
ther.
How far Mr. Watson may be correct when he says that horses 
will go almost over head in mud to get at the plant, I know not ; all 
that I can say is, that so far as my own observations go, horses will 
not eat the plant at all, if they can get anything else.
I have never 
met with the fronds injured by horses, though growing in fields where 
they fi-equently feed.
Lightfoot states, on the authority of Haller, 
that the plant was eaten by the Romans ; he also tells us, on the au- 
thority of Linnaeus, that horses refuse it.
As Mr. Watson's is the first 
account we have, by British writers, of E.
fluviatile growing in water, 
it would be well if he could give us a description of that part of the 
stem which grows under water.

Note on Geranium nodosum.
Mr. Watson still leaves 
undecided the question as to whether a Geranium which he has in his 
herbarium was gathered wild near Halifax, (Phytol.
588).
In reply 
to that question I would say, that if the plant be one which / sent to 
619 
Mr. Bowman, it was gathered wild something less than two miles from 
Halifax, and is certainly G.
pyrenaicum.
The specimen I now 
enclose is the same as the one I sent to Mr. Bowman ; and if that 
gentleman sent Mr. Watson some other, I know nothing of it.
The 
specimen sent will serve to show how far I am correct in the name.
After what has been said on this subject, it will be clearly seen that 
there is some mistake concerning this Geranium, but the question is, 
who is to bear the blame ?
Whoever may have made the mistake, I 
think Mr. Watson did wrong in publishing it, since he received the 
specimen under the name of G.
pyrenaicum, and published it under 
that of G.
nodosum in the first part of the New Guide, p.
278.
In the 
second part, at p.
652, he says, " but I entertain scarcely any doubt 
as to the species ; " and in ' The Phytologist,' p.
589, he says, " I 
THINK it G.
nodosum." By this it will be seen that Mr. Watson does 
not know the plant, neither can he read the label, and therefore I 
think he ought not to have published it.
â€” Id.
[It is evident that there is some mistake connected with the specimen of Geranium 
nodosum in Mr. Watson's possession, which it will now be difficult, if not impossible, 
to clear up.
The specimen accompanying the above communication, is decidedly one 
of G.
pyrenaicum ; and it is labelled â€” " Geranium pyrenaicum.
Washer-lane, near 
Halifax, 1 830."â€” Â£"</.]

Note on the Viviparous Grasses.
I am glad to see the sub- 
ject of viviparous grasses taken up by Mr. Grindon (Phytol.
584), and 
will now give him the result of my observations on the Festuca vivipara 
of Smith.
I have often been told that at a certain height upon our 
Yorkshire hills Festuca ovina is changed into the F.
vivipara of Smith ; 
and that Smith's F.
vivipara is only a variety of F.
ovina: this change, 
I was told, is effected by the damp atmosphere causing the seeds to 
germinate in the husk, before they fall to the ground.
It had long 
puzzled me to know how it happened that the grass did not return to 
its natural form when growing at a lower elevation, as I have seen it 
cultivated in a garden for more than twenty years, and still retain its 
usual character â€” that of producing young plants instead of seeds.
In 
June, 1842, I visited one of these hills (Fountains Fell) for the pur- 
pose of examining this grass ; but on arriving at the place I did not 
find all the F.
ovina changed into vivipara, but, on the contrary, there 
was an abundance of both, each retaining its usual character.
Here 
I was under a second embarrassment, how to account for all this ; 
however, I set to work, and got a number of specimens of F.
vivipara 
and examined them, but not a single perfect flower was to be found : 
not one of those I examined had even the inner glume of the corolla, 
620 
and seeds were out of the question, as there were no organs of repro- 
duction.
I then collected a number of F.
ovina, to try if I could find 
any of the flowers of that grass in a viviparous state ; and after I had 
examined them on the spot, I gathered specimens and brought them 
home, and examined them more minutely.
This investigation con- 
vinced me that the two grasses are abundantly distinct, but how far 
they may be considered species, I shall leave to the better judgement 
of others.
The two plants may be distinguished by the outer valve 
of the corolla of F.
vivipara (when present) being more strongly cili- 
ated on their edges, and, as Smith says, " keeled " on the back, not 
cylindrical as in F.
ovina.
The calyces are also strongly ciliated on 
their edges in F.
vivipara, while, in F.
ovina, they are, as Hooker de- 
scribes them, subglabrous.
I now enclose a specimen of each, and, 
by comparing them you will be able to see the difference.

Note on Linaria Bauhinii.
It may be interesting to some of

Note on Viviparous Grasses, Sfc. I imagine that Mr. Grindon 
(Phytol.
584) takes the exception for the rule, in the matter of the vivipa- 
rous grasses.
That Festuca ovina, e.
vivipara, produces heads of young 
plants, is certainly true, indeed, if such were not the case, I do not see 
why it should be introduced into lists as a variety ; but, that the seeds 
of grasses do germinate in the husk in wet seasons, I think cannot be 
doubted, not only from the fact of the viviparous growth constantly 
taking place imder such circumstances, in grasses and sedges also, but 
that it seems infinitely more probable than a change in the nature of the 
parts concerned.
A circumstance came under my notice last year, which 
illustrates the effect of moisture on seeds while still in the seed-vessel.
I collected some specimens of Drosera rotundifolia in flower, on Wim- 
bledon common, and placed them in a Ward's case.
The plants 
throve, and some time after I noticed on one of the heads, among the 
withered petals, a small green body.
I watched this from day to day; 
two cotyledons were gradually protruded from the capsule, and at last 
a leaf, having the peculiar circinate vernation.
The little plant then 
withered away, of course for want of nourishment.
Nature not ha\ang 
intended Drosera for an aerial plant : whereas if it had been part of 
the original plant, there is no reason why it should not have gone on 
producing leaves, since it was not interfered with in any way.
I may 
mention that it was in a small case, and kept very wet.
It is, however, 
quite worth while to settle the point concerning grasses, by facts ; 
621 
and I shall be happy to communicate anything bearing on Mr. Grin- 
don's question, which may come under my notice.

Note on a Locality of Equuetmn Jiiiviatile.
In my Reigate 
Flora I have recorded a single station for this plant, " on Reigate Hill, 
south side of the Wray lane, far from any water." This lane branches 
off from the Brighton road through Croydon and Reigate, at the turn- 
pike-gate on Wray common, perhaps a mile and a half north-east of 
the latter town, and, after a gradual ascent in a north-westerly direc- 
tion, joins the Brighton road through Sutton on the top of Reigate 
hill.
Many years ago, the late Alderman Waithman, who then had 
a country house on Wray common, opened a pit close to Wray lane, 
on its south side, for the purpose of quarrying the upper green-sand, 
which was sent to London to be used as hearth-stone.
After a short 
time, from various causes, the quarry was abandoned, but not until a 
high mound of loose sandy rubbish had accumulated at the entrance.
About the year 1836, when I visited Reigate after a few years' ab- 
sence, I found this mound covered with a most luxuriant crop of 
Equisetum fluviatile, looking like a fir-wood in miniature ; the plants 
were two and three feet high.
The locality is a very dry one ; the 
nearest water is the large pond in Gatton park, and that is quite half 
a mile distant, and considerably below the spot in point of elevation.
I do not remember having met with this plant in or near water, but 
Mr. llott has recorded a locality at Norwood, where it grows on a bank 
" and about a small pond close by," (Phytol.
295).

On the arrangement of a Herbarium.
Excellent as my friend 
Mr. King may find his plan for the arrangement of a herbarium (Phy- 
tol.
585), prejudice in favour of a different one makes me think it open 
to one or two objections; and as it is highly desirable that a collec- 
tion should be commenced upon a good system, inasmuch as chang- 
ing it afterwards is attended with much inconvenience, allow me to 
suggest the following plan to your correspondent.
Let every species 
have a separate folded sheet of white paper, and each genus a sheet 
of folded blue,* placing the former inside the latter, hke drawings in 
a portfolio, all the creases or folds of the sheets being to the left hand.
The name of the genus should be written on a slip of white paper, 
and pasted near the fold of the sheet, at equal distance from top and 
* The exact size is immaterial, but it should not be smaller than foolscap nor lar- 
ger than double folio post, which is ample, under skilful management, for any plant, 
to say nothing of the expense and unwieldiness of very large paper.
622 
bottom.
If printed labels are used, so much the better.
By this 
means a genus can be found immediately, it being merely necessary 
to raise the sheets seriatim at their folds, with the fingers of the i-ight 
hand, and glance over the labels.
The names of the species should 
be written on the corresponding part of the white papers, which can 
be run through in the same way as the blue ones, when a particular 
plant is wanted ; and thus we are never under the necessity of open- 
ing several papers when but one is required, nor liable to have the at- 
tention diverted from the object in view.
The genera may be grouped 
together in sections, classes, or natural orders, according to the taste 
of the owner.
Where British plants only are collected, the Linnaean 
system is unquestionably the better one to follow ; but for the more 
extensive herbaria, which contain both indigenous and exotic plants, 
the natural arrangement* is decidedly preferable.
The groups of ge- 
nera should be tied together in fasciculi, a piece of stout blue paste- 
board, an inch larger each way than the papers, being placed both at 
top and bottom, and hroad white tape used for tying, to prevent any 
danger of cutting either paper or pasteboard.
On the upper paste- 
board should be fastened a slip of paper, containing the names of the 
orders, classes or genera comprised in the fasciculus.
If there are 
several orders in the fasciculus, which it may be desirable to keep se- 
parate, pieces of thinner pasteboard may be used for that purpose.
By giving a whole sheet to a species, any number of specimens may 
be successively introduced on half sheets, without intrading on space 
that can ill be spared, as must be the case in a hook of limited size ; 
for surely no modern botanist is content with a single specimen of any 
plant, and that probably only in flower.
In a good collection, not 
only is the fruit necessary, but, in many cases, the foliage in its dif- 
ferent stages or conditions.
Of Tussilago Farfara, for instance, five 
or six specimens at least are necessary to illustrate the plant ; and 
with regard to trees, a much larger number is requisite.
I possess a 
series of Fagus sylvatica, comprising about twenty specimens, the first 
showing the expansion of the leaf-buds, and their beautiful rosy pe- 
rules, and the last the ripe fruit, and yet am incomplete as regards 
many of the intermediate stages.
In ferns, grasses and Carices, the 
necessity of numerous specimens is too obvious to be urged upon any 
one.
Now the constant accumulation of specimens, independently of 
species, surely must be sadly at variance with such a plan of arrange- 
ment as Mr. King's ; whereas by tying them in fasciculi, as above de- 
* As given, for instance, in Hooker's edition of Smith's ' Introduction to Botany.' 
623 
scribed, all that is required is white paper in half sheets, and tape to 
meet the increase of bulk.
The present plan is, moreover, so com- 
pact, and the fasciculi are so mathematically uniform in superjficial 
measurement (that is, if a little dexterity and judgment are used in 
the mounting, so as to let the thick heads of thistles, for instance, lie 
in the comers of the papers), that they will lie upon each other like folio 
volumes.
Another advantage over the book system is that a series of 
genera and species can be taken out and laid side by side for compari- 
son, and be easily replaced when done with.
If I rightly understand 
Mr. King's method, the latter does not admit of this ; at all events, it 
cannot be practised with equal facility.
Where a cabinet, purposely 
constructed for holding plants, is possessed, of course tape and paste- 
boards are not required, the papers lying loose on their respective 
shelves.
In this case I would, nevertheless, still pursue the plan of 
having genera and species in separate blue and white papers, as above 
described.

The generic and specific characters are of necessi-

Read, a paper from E.
J. 
Quekett, Esq., " On the Nature of Vessels possessing longitudinal as well as spiral 
Fibres." Mr. Quekett stated that these vessels are not present in the majority of plants, 
and consequently have not been described until within the last few years.
They have 
been found in plants belonging to very different orders, by various observers, and it is 
not improbable that future investigation may detect them in many other plants than 
those in which they have hitherto been observed.
Thus they have been found by 
Schultz in Urania speciosa, by Mr. W.
Wilson in Typha latifolia, in a plant of the 
gourd kind by Mr. Hassall, and by Mr. Quekett in Loasa and in Canna bicolor.
In 
exogens these vessels do not appear to be either of the length or diameter they are in 
endogens, in which they seem to constitute the largest and longest of the vessels.
In 
Loasa they do not exceed the ^l of an inch in diameter, while in Urania and Canna 
they are nearly the â– ^.
In their structure they have a general resemblance to ordina- 
ry spiral vessels, having very frequently two or more fibres fonning the same screw 
coiled in the interior of the vessel, as in compound spiral vessels.
In addition to this 
spiral arrangement, there are longitudinal deposits of fibres whose number varies con- 
siderably, some vessels not having more than six or eight, while more than double 
that number may be detected in the larger vessels.
Upon applying force, these lon- 
gitudinal fibres are broken at the same point as the membrane, the broken edges of 
which project beyond the edge of the spiral ribband to which the vessels are reduced.
Their terminations are very pointed, and they are applied to each other for some con- 
siderable space.
At first Mr. Quekett supposed these vessels to be perfect of their kind, 
presenting higher marks of development than the true spiral vessels ; subsequent ob- 
servations however have enabled him to discover that a vessel presenting this longitu- 
dinal deposit of fibres, is only in a state preparatory to the complete development of a 
vessel exhibiting oval or quadrangular dots on its parietes : and he observes that al- 
though a tendency to produce longitudinal fibres may be seen in other annular and 
spiral vessels, it is only in the compound spiral that the ultimate conversion of a spi- 
ral vessel into one with dots regularly arranged in longitudinal fibres occurs.
This is 
quite in accordance with the observations of Mohl and Schleiden, which prove that the 
spiral is the earliest type of every other form of vessel, whatever phases they may after- 
wards assume.
He also described the various steps by which the spiral vessel becomes 
an annular one, and the reticulated vessel one with dots; and showed that the vessels 
forming the particular subject of this paper, are some of those in progress towards the 
dotted condition, as in some instances, in Canna bicolor, the various steps of this pro- 
cess can be witnessed in different parts of the same vessel.
He concluded with some 
observations upon the dots on the vessels in woody exogens, showing that these last are 
of a more complex structure than those formed by the mere rounding of the meshes of 
the reticulated vessel.

Having lately seen the articles on this subject by Schleiden, and 
by Mirbel and Spach, in the * Annales des Sciences Naturelles,' pub- 
lished in April and May, 1839, it has been my wish to examine for 
myself how far the former of these writers had any foundation for his 
opinions.
Hitherto I have not met with any evidence in favour of the 
doctrine which teaches that the vegetable embryo consists of a por- 
tion of the pollen-tube which has penetrated the nucleus.
The ac- 
count given by Corda (see Lindley's ' Introduction,' ed.
2, p.
550) may 
possibly be correct as applied to the spruce fir, which I have not yet 
examined, but it can scarcely be applicable to Pinus sylvestris, where 
I find the nucleus surrounded by three different integuments, each of 
them destitute of a foramen ; so that all direct communication of the 
pollen-tube with the nucleus appears to be impossible : it would even 
admit of a doubt whether the ovule in this case is really naked, and 
whether there be not a carpellary membrane (continuous with the 
stigma-like expansion at the summit of the ovule) surrounding the 
nucleus and its proper integuments.
The innermost of the three 
membranes is a very thin pellicle [sac of the embri/o of Adolphe Brong- 
niart), scarcely if at all attached to the surrounding parts.
A lon- 
gitudinal section of the ovule is given at fig.
2 (p.
625).
The action 
of the pollen has not yet been observed.
A genuine example of a naked ovule may be seen in Juniperus 
communis.
Here the nucleus consists of a roundish mass of uniform 
cellular tissue, not enclosed in a pellicle, and with only one integu- 
ment, which is open at the top ; so that there is nothing to prevent 
the pollen-tube from penetrating the nucleus.
It must, however, be 
remarked, that the nucleus has no ready-formed cavity {embryostome) 
for the reception of the pollen-tube, and thus far the observations of 
Corda seem to be inapplicable.
The like structure exists in Thuja 
occidentalis.
Unfortunately, I cannot pursue the enquiry; as the 
male plants of both are inaccessible to me at this time.
Fig. 3 (p.
625) 
represents a longitudinal section of the ovule of Juniperus ; at fig.
4 
is shown another actual section (exceedingly thin) of the nucleus, 
with a portion of the integument, carefully copied from nature, mag- 
nified about 300 times.
In Berberis vulgaris there are some interesting features.
The ova- 
rium is a cavity, imperfectly closed at the top by the stigma.
There 
is no proper style, and no central stigmatic tissue ; so that if any pol- 
len-tubes are formed, they must pass at once into the ovarium, and 
into the foramen of the ovule : but it is not yet ascertained that any 
627 
pollen-tubes are produced.* When the pollen-grains are immersed in 
water, they speedily burst and discharge the fovilla from their sides.
At fig.
5 {p.
625) is shown a longitudinal section of the pistillum, with 
one of the ovules at the base of the ovarium.
It will be seen that the 
.stigmatic surface is continued into the cavity of the ovarium, on that 
side which is most swollen.
In this plant the elastic valve of the anther fulfils an important func- 
tion, which seems to have been overlooked.
The stamen is not hap- 
pily represented in Lindley's 'Introduction,' ed.
2, pi.
4, fig.
11.
It is 
placed behind the filament, and is lower than the stigma ; but the 
valve, on turning up, also twists round towards the stigma, its cavity 
being filled with nearly all the pollen, which is thus brought to a le- 
vel with the stigma, ready to be applied to its surface the instant that 
the filament is excited below.

Equisetum palustre, var.
nudum, (Gibson, MSS.) 
This form of the plant is widely but sparingly distributed.
I am 
indebted to Miss Griffiths for specimens from Braunton Burroughs in 
Devonshire, to Dr. Greville for others from the sands of Barry, and to 
Mr. S.
Gibson for the loan of others from Aldingham, Yorkshire, and 
Broadbank, Lancashire ; to these Mr. Gibson has attached the MS.
name of " var, nudumr 
This plant, as will be seen from the figure (p.
628), differs princi- 
pally from the normal form in being without branches, or nearly so, 
the occurrence of a few scattered ones being occasional only, and con- 
stituting the exception rather than the rule.
1 can scarcely wonder 
that botanists should have referred such a j^lant to the preceding ra- 
ther than the present species : this is the case in all the herbaria I 
have examined, excepting Mr. Gibson's, which came into my hands 
just as the present paper was going to press, but in time to incorpo- 
rate a notice of it, and adopt the proposed name.
* On further examination it appears that the pollen- j^iuins do produce tubes ; and 
that the stigmatic fluid is of a resinous nature, and does not mix with water.

The specimens vary considerably in size as well as general appear- 
ance : those from Scotland, Yorkshire and Lancashire are very small, 
the stems not attaining on the average more than a length of two inch- 
es : those from Devonshire are somewhat larger, the figure represents 
a Devonshire specimen of the natural size, and I have seen others of 
a still more luxuriant growth.
Some of the examples are erect, others 
pi'ostrate, and those which grow on sand-banks have the roots densely 
fibrous.
Equisetum palustre, var.
nudum, Gibson, MS.
After a careful examination of this plant I am unable to find any 
characters whereby to distinguish it as a species from E.
palustre : â€” 
the root, stem, sheaths and catkins seeming to me identical with those 
of the species to which I have referred it.
629 
I cannot conclude my account of this species without thanking 
those botanists who have kindly given me their opinions on the no- 
menclature of the British species of Equisetum : the aggregate of 
these opinions is in favour of the changes I have proposed.
I observe 
in Dr. Diedrich's ' Deutschlands Kryptogamische Gewaschse,' pub- 
lished since my notes on the Linnean herbarium, that the author has 
adopted the nomenclature given below.
E. limosum, Diedrich, = the polystachion variety of E.
palustre, 
Linneus ?
A doubt may arise whether the polystachion variety 
of palustre, Linn., or fluviatile, Linn., be intended.
E. fluviatile, Diedrich, = E.
fluviatile, Linn, and E.
limosum, Sm.
E. Telraateja, Diedrich, = E.
Telmateja, Ehrh., E.
eburneum.
Roth, 
andE.
fluviatile.
Smith.
E. umbrosum, Diedrich, = E.
umbrosum, Meyer, and E.
Druni- 
mondii, Hooker.
The other names correspond with those in Smith's ' English Flora.' 
As Dr. Diedrich makes no reference to my observations on this sub- 
ject, and indeed could scarcely, by any possibility, have seen them, I 
think his publication may be received as further testimony in favour 
of the changes in question, and it certainly confinns my intention of 
adopting them, notwithstanding the expressed disapprobation of two 
eminent botanists, Mr. Watson (Phytol.
587), and Mr. Babington, 
(Manual, 379).* These gentlemen are themselves authorities in no- 
menclature, and their decisions are received with a respect to which 
mine are not entitled ; I therefore use no judgment of my own, know- 
ing that it would not be received as authority : but having shown the 
species described by Linneus under the name of fluviatile, that de- 
scribed by Ehrhart under the name Telmateja, and that described by 
Willdenow imder the name umbrosum ; and finding no descriptions 
prior to these since the establishment of the binominal nomenclature; 
1 revert to the names given by these authors as a matter oj course, 
not one in which I have any right to exercise a judgment or opinion 
of my own.
I may however add, that Mr. Watson's remarks on the 
habitats of E.
fluviatile, Smith, somewhat startle me : the inference 
to be drawn from half-a-dozen letters now before me, is, that the plant 
in question not only does not but cannot grow in water ; but as none 
of these are intended for publication, I forbear naming the writers.
In the confusion of names is it not possible that there is also a confu- 
* Wiililenhiirg, in his ' Flora Lapponica' (1812), clearly points out Smith's error.

siou of plants, and that Mr. Watson's fluviatile and my fluviatile are one 
and the same plant, and that we both adopt the Linnean nomenclature ?
Tn my former observations I made no allusion to the Equisetum 
Drummondii of Sir W.
J. Hooker, because no specimen of this plant 
exists in the Linnean herbarium, to which alone my remarks were con- 
fined : but the same species appears to have been long known as a 
native of Europe, by the name oi Equisetum umbroswn.
The name 
was for some time MS.
only, and is given as Meyer's MS.
name.
However, in 1809, the species was regularly characterized by Willde- 
now, in his * Enumeratio,' p.
1065 ; and again by the same author in 
his ' Species Plantarum' (1810), v.
3 : and it also appears with a mi- 
nute description in Vaucher's ' Monographic des Preles,' published in 
the first volume of the ' Memoires de la Societe de Physique &c.
de 
Geneve.' The description is accompanied by very exact figures of 
the fertile and barren fronds, and of a branched frond surmounted by 
a catkin, a very common but not constant form of the species.* In 
all these instances the name of umbrosum is given without any other 
synonyme, or any implied doubt as to its correctness.

In our last number we briefly mentioned the appearance of two of 
the works whose titles stand at the head of this article : in the pre- 
sent notice we believe we cannot do better than combine with these a 
third, and to class them all under one general head ; since the geo- 
graphical distribution of plants and their correct discrimination are 
branches of botanical science as inseparable as they are important 
and interesting.
A botanist is always anxious to ascertain not only 
the name of a plant and its place in the system ; he also wishes to 
make himself acquainted with its native country, its general geogra- 
phical range, and every circumstance connected with its habitats and 
localities, together with the various conditions of climate and altitude 
under which it occurs.
Such information relative to our native spe- 
cies will be convey ed in Mr. Watson's treatise on ' The Geographi- 
cal Distribution of British Plants,' of which the first part, containing 
the Ranunculaceas, Nympheeaceae and Papaveraceae, is now before 
us.
The author has been for many years engaged on this subject; 
the two treatises previously printed by him having been but the pre- 
cursors of the present admirable work, wherein his views are more 
fully developed, and the results of his researches stated in a more ex- 
tended form.
Its scope and design will be best shown by extracts 
from the "Preliminary Explanations." 
" The first object to be accomplished in the following pages, is that of bringing 
together, under a methodical form, those facts which are calculated to assist in show- 
ing both the general range and local habitats of such plants as are reputedly indige- 
nous, or pretty well naturalised, in the island of Great Britain and its islets immedi- 
ately adjacent, from Scilly to Shetland." â€” p.
2. 
The plants of Ireland are necessarily excluded, there not being on 
record sufficient data to enable the author to illustrate the geographi- 
cal relations of the flora of that country.
The Channel Isles are in 
like manner excluded, because they are considered to belong more 
properly to France than to this coiuitry : " all their indigenous plants 
being apparently common to those islets with France, while several 
of them are unknown among the native plants of England." 
" After bringing together such data as may be found conveniently within the au- 
thor's reach, for exhibiting the ascertained distribution of each species considered by 
itself, it will then become comparatively easy to add illustrative maps, statistical tables, 
and more comprehensive and generalised views respecting those various physical con- 
flilions which arc apparently most influential in determining the present distribution 
637 
of the plants.
To this end, it is unquestionable that copious and accurate details are 
necessary in the first place, and before the aid of maps and tables can be called in for 
the sake of explicitness and precision in conveying to others the knowledge so acquir- 
ed.
Interesting as it may be in itself to many minds, the public vaFue of that know- 
ledge must be measured by the degree in which it can tend to elucidate the causes of 
vegetable distribution ; since it is only by first ascertaining those causes that we can 
reasonably expect to render the knowledge beneficially applicable to human affairs.
But much time may yet elapse before any such application of knowledge can be made.
" Notwithstanding the long-accumulated stores of individual facts relating to the 
indigenous plants of this country, and to the particular localities for the rarer species, 
as well as many full lists of the plants of single counties or other definite tracts ; and 
notwithstanding the lively impulse which has of late years been given to such enqui- 
ries, we are still sadly short of accurately observed facts that bear directly upon the 
ultimate object here proposed.
The facts not having been observed or recorded with 
reference to any such end, they have consequently been, so far as that end is concern- 
ed, too often only inadequately observed and recorded ; the most valuable or interest- 
ing circumstances having been either noticed insufiicientlv or wholly passed over." â€” 
p. 3.
We regret that we cannot follow the author into all the details of 
the plan of the work, which, however, we trust will be rendered intel- 
ligible by such brief explanatory remarks as our limits will allow us 
to give.
First as to the botanical aiTangement : â€” 
" The so-called Natural System of arranging plants determines the order in 
which they will be spoken of in these volumes, and which will be very nearly that 
of Decandolle's Prodromus.
Nature's own system of practical arrangement is clearly 
a geographical one ; but for the convenience of technical botanists, it has been deemed 
more advisable to follow the abstract system, by which plants are supposed to be united 
into groups according to general resemblances." â€” p.
5. 
The nomenclature is that of Hooker's ' British Flora,' fifth edition, 
with occasional references for synonyms to the works of Smith, Gray, 
Withering and Hudson.
" No species will be introduced into this 
work as indigenous, unless the author has seen specimens alleged to 
be of British growth." As examples of " the difficulty of tracing any 
abrupt line of separation between the two classes of native and natu- 
ralised plants," the six following trees are mentioned ; â€” the birch, 
the beech, lime, sycamore, chesnut and walnut : the first of these be- 
ing " truly indigenous," and the last " certainly introduced." The 
author asks, "between which two, among the remaining four interme- 
diately placed names, must we draw the line that divides the natural- 
ised from the native species .?
" â€” and remarks that it would be difficult 
to obtain a unanimous decision on this question : the difficulty would 
consequently be greater in the case of the common plants of our gar- 
dens, corn-fields, road-sides and sea-shoreso 
C38 
At the head of each species are two diagrams ; one being " a mini- 
ature map of Britain, divided into eighteen districts," whih are num- 
bered in regular order from south to north ; the other exhibits " the 
absolute and comparative heights attained by the highest hills of the 
respective districts." By the omission of the figures from the spaces 
in the first diagram corresponding w^ith districts in which the species 
has not been observed, a pretty exact idea of its ascertained range is 
given ; the same course is pursued in the diagram of altitudes.
These 
diagrams are intended as index-maps to others on a larger scale.
Immediately under these diagrams are the following details.
1. 
The name of the species, with synonyms, if any.
2. An enumeration 
of the districts in which the species has been ascertained to grow.
3. 
An enumeration of such of twenty local Floras and thirty catalogues 
in which the species is mentioned.
4. Enumeration of localities from 
which specimens of the species are preserved in the author's herba- 
rium.
5. Uncertain localities.
6. Distribution of the species in Bri- 
tain.
7. General distribution.
8. Localities ranged under the various 
districts, collected from different sources.
We regret exceedingly that we cannot give copious extracts fi-om 
the author's highly interesting remarks on the general distribution of 
the plants belonging to the three natural orders treated on in the pre- 
sent part : but with two more quotations we must conclude.
" Ranunculaceous plants are very widely distributed over the surface of the globe.
They were found â€” in the typical form of the order, the genus Ranunculus â€” on all 
the arctic and polar coasts visited by Sir Edward Parry and other northern voyagers ; 
even under the highest latitudes attained, as in Melville Island and at the northern 
extremity of Spitzbergen.
They are still to be seen at the contrary extremes both of 
the old and new worlds, about the Cape of Good Hope and the Straits of Magellan ; 
and they have also been gathered on the islands of the Southern Pacific, in New Hol- 
land, Van Dieman's Land, New Zealand, &c.
Between these remote positions repre- 
sentatives of the order may be found in every part of the world, numerously in cold 
and temperate climates, but much more sparingly scattered over intertropical coun- 
tries.
Within and about the tropics, the plants of this order are chiefly seen on the 
mountains, although not invariably so." â€” p.
22.
In Steudel's Nomenclator are enumerated about 78,000 species of 
phanerogamous plants ; of these 830 species, or about a 94th part of 
the whole number, are Ranunculaceae.
Mr. Watson thinks that this 
proportion may possibly be too high, in consequence of " the species 
of this order being better known than are those of several other orders 
prevalent within the tropics, or in the southern hemisphere." The 
proportion relatively to other flowering plants, is highest in high nor- 
thern latitudes, but the greatest absolute number of species is found 
in the more temperate latittides of the northern hemisphere.
In 
639 
Britain the Ranunculacege constitute about a 48th part of the whole 
phanerogamic flora.
" The beautiful plants which are included by systematic botanists under the or- 
der of Nymphaeaceous plants, and are sufficiently familiar to most persons under 
their common name of Water-lilies, are distributed less generally over the world than 
the former order, that of Ranunculaceous plants, or than the succeeding one, consist- 
ing of the Poppies, and allied genera.
Yet, looking to the small number of distinct 
species comprehended in it, the present order may still be said to have a wide distribu- 
tion.
Being mostly large aquatic plants, adapted to grow in lakes and the less rapid 
rivers, the species of Nymphaeaceae are the ornaments of continental countries and low 
places ; and are usually banished from islands and elevated mountains, as well as from 
very cold latitudes whose waters remain frozen during a large part of the year.
Hilly 
or undulated countries, however, whose streams are converted into lakes or lake-like 
livers on their low plains and in their valleys, may be considered favourable for the 
support of water-lilies ; and we consequently find that our own insular position does 
not prevent Nymphaeacese constituting quite as large a proportion of the indigenous 
flora of Britain, as is ordinarily the case with the floras of continental countries.'' â€” 
p. 174.
We have stated that this work is printed for private distribution 
only ; it will appear from time to time as the materials may become 
ready, and is offered to those botanical friends who have assisted the 
author in his investigations on that department of botanical science 
to which it relates.
The author has adopted this course from an un- 
willingness to give such a pledge for the completion of the whole, as 
would be implied by the pubhcation of a part, of a work which must 
necessarily run to so voluminous an extent.
Whilst we cannot but 
respect the honourable feeling which prompted this course, and ad- 
mire the liberality with which it has been carried out, we must also 
regret that such a store of valuable information on this exceedingly 
interesting branch of the science, should not be rendered accessible 
to every student of the Botany of this country.
Let us now proceed to make a few observations on the two other 
publications the titles of which we have given above.
We have but 
little doubt that on the first announcement of Mr. Babington's inten- 
tion to add another to the numerous works on British Botany already 
existing, there was a feeling in the minds of many botanists that such 
an addition to their libraries was not required, or, at least, that so 
much having been effected in advancing our knowledge of British 
plants, a new Flora must necessarily be no more than a compilation.
But that a new Flora was not uncalled for at the present time, and 
that it was not impossible for such a work to be something more than 
a mere compilation, will, we trust, be rendered evident by a hasty 
010 
glance at the previously published general Floras of this country, 
commencing with the magnum opus of Sir J.
E. Smith, in 1828.* 
Although arranged according to what it has lately been the fashion 
to disparage by the appellation of an antiquated and useless system, 
the ' English Flora ' will never be superseded as a work of standard 
authority on the botanical productions of Great Britain.
Whatever 
may be its faults, they are doubtless attributable to the state of 
Botany in England at the period when it was written, and are infi- 
nitely outnumbered by its merits, which are its own, and have been 
justly acknowledged by all subsequent writers on Botany.
The ap- 
pearance of a work of such high authority, in the English language, 
gave a new impulse to the study of British plants, and laid the foun- 
dation for the more exact discrimination of our native species ; unfor- 
tunately, however, its bulk and consequent price placed it beyond the 
reach of many a humble but ardent student, who was obliged to rest 
content with the more accessible and more portable ' Compendium 
Florae Britannicae,' if he understood Latin â€” or with Galpine's ' Syn- 
optical Compend,' Macgillivray's Withering, or the ' Compendium of 
the English Flora,' if his literary acquirements extended only to the 
English language.
All these were exceedingly useful books, to the 
travelling botanist more especially; but the three of the highest au- 
hority â€” the Compendiums â€” laid claim to little more than the merit 
of being correct indexes to the larger works.
In 1830 appeared the' 
first edition of Hooker's ' British Flora,' intended, as the author says 
in the preface, " Istly, to provide the young student with a descrip- 
tion of our native plants, arranged according to the simplest method ; 
and 2dly, to afford to the more experienced botanist, a manual, that 
should be useful in the field as well as the closet." The first object 
was gained by the adoption of the Linneean method ; the second, by 
happily steering a middle course between the two extremes of de- 
voting so much space to the descriptions and synonyms as would in- 
crease the bulk of the book, or so curtailing the characters that they 
would scarcely be available for specific discrimination by the majo- 
rity of those for whose use the work was intended.
That the idea 
was a happy one, and on the whole well worked out, can scarcely be 
doubted, when we consider that within about ten years from its first 
appearance, four large editions of the ' British Flora ' in its original 
form have been disposed of; but we must confess that we do greatly 
* The first volume of Smith's 'English Flora' was published in 1824, but the 
work was not completed until 1828, when the fourth volume appeared, accompanied 
by a reprint of the preceding three volumes.
041 
doubt both the policy and the expediency of the recent change in the 
arrangement of the work, unaccompanied by corresponding improve- 
ments in the matter, of which more anon.
In addition to the works above named, which are all arranged ac- 
cording to the Linnaean system, and have all gone through several 
editions, we may here mention two others, in the arrangement of which 
the natural system was followed ; we allude to Lindley's Synopsis and 
Macreight's Manual.
All these different publications have, however, 
more or less the air of compilations ; their respective authors or edi- 
tors having probably supposed that as so much had already been 
effected in British Botany, nothing more was required, than perhaps 
just to register any new species or variety that might by chance offer 
itself to their notice ; such an event as the appearance of an original 
British Flora being deemed beyond the bounds of possibility.
The 
publication of Leighton's ' Flora of Shropshire ' we believe to have 
had some effect in dispelling this illusion ; at all events it would na- 
turally lead to the reflection, that if in the Flora of a single county so 
many improvements could be effected by the exercise of a little origi- 
nal observation, it were not unreasonable to suppose that a patient 
and careful investigation of the general Flora of the kingdom, would 
yield a rich and abundant reward to the botanist who should under- 
take the task.
I'he state of botanical science in Britain, at the period when Mr.
Babington first commenced his investigation of our Flora, and its 
probable causes, are thus described in the Preface to that gentleman's 
Manual.
" From the attention which has long been paid to the elucidation of the Flora of 
Britain, and the numerous excellent botanists who have, since the time of the justly 
celebrated Ray (not to go further back), employed their talents upon an endeavour to 
determine the indigenous products of these kingdoms, the author, in common it is be- 
lieved with most English botanists, did not suppose that much remained to be done in 
British Botany ; for he could not expect that after the labours of such men as Smith, 
Hooker, Lindley, and others, and the publication of so invaluable and unrivalled a col- 
lection of figures as is contained in the ' English Botany,' there could still be many 
questions concerning the nomenclature, or any considerable number of unascertained 
species, the determination of which would fall to his lot.
He had not however ad- 
vanced far in the critical examination of our native plants, before he found that a care- 
ful comparison of indigenous specimens with the works of eminent continental authors, 
and with plants obtained from other parts of Europe, must necesssrily be made, for it 
appeared that in very many cases the nomenclature employed in England was differ- 
ent from that used in other countries, that often plants considered as varieties here 
were held to be distinct species abroad, that several of our species were only looked up- 
on as varieties by them, and also that the mode of grouping into genera was frequently 
essentially different.

" The discovery of these facts produced considerable astonishment, and the author 
was led to consider what could have been the causes of so remarlcable a discrepancy.
The following appears to be the most probable explanation.
It is well known that at 
the close of the last centuiy Sir J.
E. Smith became the fortunate possessor of the her- 
barium of Linnaeus, and was thus enabled to ascertain, with very considerable accura- 
cy, the British species which were known to that distinguished man, and to publish, 
in the most improved form that he had given to his system, a remarkably complete and 
excellent Flora of Britain.
Then followed the long-continued separation of this coun- 
try from France, and indeed from most of the European nations, by which we were al- 
most completely prevented from observing the progress which botanical science was 
making in other countries, and at the same time our own flora was continually receiv- 
ing accessions of new plants which it was nearly impossible to identify with the species 
detected and published in France and Germany.
At the conclusion of the war we had 
become so wedded to the system of Linnaeus, and it may even perhaps be allowable to 
add, so well satisfied with our own proficiency, that, with the honourable exception of 
Mr. Brown, there was at that time scarcely a botanist in Britain who took any inte- 
rest or paid the least attention to the classification by Natural Orders which had been 
adopted in France, and to the more minute and accurate examination of plants which 
was caused by the employment of that philosophical arrangement.
Let it not how- 
ever be supposed that the author wishes at all to detract from the value of the Linnaean 
system â€” a system which was considered by its author as merely a provisional arrange- 
ment or kind of index to the known plants ; for no botanist has more strongly stated 
the value of a natural classification than Linnaeus himself, â€” as he fully believes that 
without some such artificial scheme by which newly discovered plants could be cata- 
loo"ued for easy reference, the multitudinous species which distant countries have 
supplied would long since have fonned so enormous and confused a mass as to have 
reduced Botany to a state little better than that into which it had fallen at the eom- 
mencement of the Linnaean era.
" The publication of so complete and valuable a Linnaean work as the ' English 
Flora,' greatly contributed to the permanency of this feeling, and accordingly we find 
that at a veiy recent period working English botanists were unacquainted with any of 
the more modern continental floras, and indeed even now many of those works are on- 
ly known by name to the great mass of the cultivators of British Botany." â€” Pref.
v. 
It now remains for us briefly to er quire which of the two works be- 
fore us is the most likely to have the effect of enabling the student of 
British Botany to take his stand by the side of the continental cultiva- 
tors of the science, or at least to enable him to make some steps in ad- 
vance of his present position.
And here we feel that we are treading 
on dangerous ground ; we feel that whatever is stamped with the au- 
thority belonging to so illustrious a name as that of the author of the 
well-known and widely circulated ' British Flora,' must be approach- 
ed with caution, nay, almost with reverence ; and that no rude hands 
ought to be laid on the structure he has raised.
We should how- 
ever be wanting in our duty as honest chroniclers, did we not state it 
to be our opinion, and we state it with regret, that the fifth edition of 
643 
the ' British Flora ' is neither calculated to extend the fame of its au- 
thor, nor in any considerable degree to raise the standard of botanical 
excellence in this country ; it even, in many points, falls short of the 
actual state of knowledge of our native plants, existing in Britain at 
the period of its publication.
We believe that the numerous avocations of the author have been 
urged, even by his reviewers, in extenuation of sundry little blemish- 
es, which those fond of such employment might hunt out in the for- 
mer editions of the ' British Flora.' Such a plea, to a certain extent, 
we are quite willing to admit ; at the same time we contend, that in 
the preparation of a new edition of a popular and really useful work, 
the public, who have so warmly patronized the earlier editions, have 
a right to expect that a little more care should be taken than appears 
to have been bestowed on this same fifth edition of the ' British Flora,' 
and certainly a little more regard for the researches of fellow-labour- 
ers would not have been altogether out of place.
For instance ; â€” if, 
instead of simply quoting the Edinburgh Catalogue as a mere list of 
synonyms, not worth the trouble of investigating.
Sir William had 
been led by his doubts to a re-examination of the works of the conti- 
nental authors whose nomenclature is there adopted, and had then 
thought it necessary to reject that nomenclature, â€” his reasons for do- 
ing so would have been heard with deference and respect.
Again ; 
as one example of Sir William's disregard of the labours of British 
botanists, may be mentioned the long-mooted question respecting the 
parasitism of Monotropa ; which, in the period between the publica- 
tion of the fourth and fifth editions of the ' British Flora,' was fully 
investigated and satisfactorily decided ; yet we here find repeated the 
same words â€” " Root fibrous, parasitic ?" â€” which have appeared in all 
the former editions of that work.
Nor is any allusion made to another 
form of Monotropa, now found to be common in England, and appa- 
rently so distinct from Hypopitys, as to have been raised to the rank 
of a species by many botanists.
A little more care would also have 
led to the detection and correction of numerous erroneous references to 
* English Botany,' which have been perpetuated from first to last : like 
the old nomenclature for the fems and their allies, which is retained 
with scarcely a single change.
The book is, in fact, little more than 
the fourth edition newly arranged, that is, the natural system is fol- 
lowed instead of the Linnaean in the body of the work, with a Lin- 
nsean synopsis of genera prefixed : the preface even has not been re- 
written in justification of this change of plan ; a few sentences having 
been grafted on the old stock in reference to the use of the Linnsean 
644 
synopsis.
We regret to have found occasion for this ungracious task 
of fault-finding, because we believe that Sir William could have done 
much better.
We will now turn to Mr. Babington's Manual, and see how nearly that 
comes up to the idea of what a new book on British Botany ought to be.
The model chiefly followed in its preparation is Koch's ^ Synopsis 
Florae Gerraanicge ;' but other standard works have also been consulted.
" In the present work it has been the author's endeavour to adopt, in all cases, those 
names which have the claim of priority, unless good cause could be shown for a con- 
trary proceeding, and with this object he has carefully examined nearly all the best 
European Floras, comparing our plants with the descriptions contained in them, and 
in very many cases with foreign specimens of undoubted authenticity.
In the adop- 
tion of genera and species an endeavour has been made, by the examination of the 
plants themselves, to determine what are to be considered as truly distinct, thus, it is 
hoped, taking Nature as a guide, and not depending upon the authority of any name, 
however distinguished.
Still let it not be supposed that any claim is made to peculiar 
accuracy, nor that the author considers himself qualified to dictate to any student of 
Botany, for he is well aware that there are many points upon which persons who have 
carefully studied the subject may form different conclusions from those to which he 
has been led." â€” Pref.
vi.
This is as it should be ; and such, doubtless, was the plan adopted, 
so far as circumstances would permit, by Sir J.
E. Smith, and by the 
author of the ' British Flora' himself, in the preparation of the early 
editions of that work : there is, nevertheless, a greater amount of ori- 
ginality observable in the pages of the Manual, than in any general 
work on British Botany that has issued from the press since the pub- 
lication of the ' English Flora.' In a very few instances Mr. Babing- 
ton has thought it better to rely more on the labours of his predeces- 
sors than on his own judgment, as in the difficult genera Rosa and 
Rubus, respecting which he expresses his obligations to the valuable 
monographs by Mr. Borrer, published in the 'British Flora.' But, 
while studying the works of the great continental botanists, the author 
has not deemed it unnecessary to note what has been going on at home, 
and that, too, up to the latest possible date previous to the publi- 
cation of his Manual; which is thus rendered more complete than it 
would otherwise have been.
The orders and genera are necessarily 
defined as concisely as was consistent with perspicuity; but we should 
like to see, in a future edition, a general table of the orders and genera, 
arranged on the dichotomous or some other plan, prefixed to the vo- 
lume, as well as the present Linnsean synopsis.
We must conclude with the following paragraph, which conveys 
the author's wishes respecting a future edition of his Manual.
645 
" It is hoped that those who use this book will favour the author with information 
of any (even the slightest) addition, correction or alteration that may appear to be ne- 
cessary, in order that it may be employed in the preparation of a future edition, as it 
is only through such assistance that the Flora of an extensive country can attain to 
even a moderate degree of perfection.'' â€” Pref.
viii.
We think that the cause of British Botany could scarcely be better 
served than by the extensive circulation of this work, especially if its 
possessors are not sparing of either their criticism or their labour, the 
one in discovering and pointing out to the author any errors into whicli 
he may have fallenâ€” the other in furnishing him with additional ma- 
terials, the stock of which is as yet far from being exhausted.

On the arrangement of a Herbarium.
Tmagining that the 
plan I pursue in the arrangement of my herbarium is in some respects 
superior to that of Mr. King (Phytol.
585), I am induced to forward a 
short detail of it, in the hope that it may contain hints which may be 
of service to some of your readers.
I ought to say, that although I 
have varied some of the details, I adopted the principle of the plan 
from seeing it carried out in the herbarium of a friend, which contain- 
ed an extensive collection of both British and foreign species, kept in 
beautiful order.
Specimens.
â€” My specimens are fastened on sheets 
of folio post paper, of good texture, size 15^^ inches by Og-.
The spe- 
cimens are fastened with gum Arabic on the inner right hand page of 
each sheet ; and on the opposite one I write the name, order, and 
other particulars : I also write the botanical name at the top of the 
outside of the sheet.
Before placing each species in its appropriate 
place in the herbarium, I wash it lightly over with a solution of cor- 
rosive sublimate in spirits of wine or spirits of turpentine, in the pro- 
portion of 60 grains of the former to 8 fluid ounces of either of the 
latter.
Arrangement.
â€” I arrange my specimens on the natural sys- 
tem ; and for this purpose I have wrappers, each of half a sheet of 
double crown paper folded : on the outside of which is written the 
name of one of the natural orders ; in this I place all the sheets of 
specimens belonging to that order.
In the orders Rosaceae, Compo- 
sitse, Gramineae, and one or two others, it may be as well to subdivide 
each into two or three portions, and use a separate wrapper for each.
The wrappers, with their contents, are placed in wooden boxes, made 
after the fashion of a music-case, namely, with a lid at the top, and 
the front hinged so as to fall down on a level with the bottom.
I 
have these boxes made of the size of my paper, and 6^ inches deep, 
which accommodates about 300 species in each case.
As an index I 
648 
use the Edinburgh Society's Catalogue, affixing an asterisk in red ink 
to the name of each species in the herbarium.
In this way the col- 
lection may be kept in beautiful order, and at all times in a state of 
readiness for convenient reference.

Friendly Hint to Subscribers.
I am very sorry to perceive, 
from the cover to ' The Phytologist ' for June, that its circulation does 
not pay its expenses.
Might I presume to suggest, that if each sub- 
scriber would endeavour to obtain, among his botanical friends, one 
additional subscriber, it would relieve the magazine from its difficul- 
ties, and continue to us a periodical which has hitherto been very in- 
teresting and useful, and which will, I trust, long maintain its stand- 
ing.

that V.
triphyllos is mentioned by Sir W.
J. Hooker as being found 
in Yorkshire, though accompanied with a query.

Note on the Habitats of Equisetum Jiuviatile, Sm. I went 
the other day, with my friend Mr. Sparkes, to Norwood, and minutely 
examined the station where I found Equisetum fluviatile last summer.
After reading the discordant statements which have lately appeared in 
*The Phytologist' respecting the habits of this plant, we felt a desire 
to prove whether any specimens of it would be found actually in the 
water.
It was growing most plentifully on the steep bank alluded to 
by me in the August number (Phytol.
295), but much more sparingly 
on the small piece of wet ground between that and the pond ; yet a 
few stems were found close to the water's edge.
There was not, how- 
ever, a single specimen that actually grew in the water.
It is worthy 
of remark, too, that by far the most luxuriant specimens were those 
which grew on the bank ; those about the pond being much more 
stunted in appearance.
All the authorities within my reach assign a 
station for Equisetum fluviatile near rivers and lakes ; but none speak 
of it as actually growing in water.
I send you a specimen of my 
plant, to remove all doubts as to identity.
The spot where it grows, 
is not more than a hundred yards from the top of Westow Hill, Nor- 
wood, going towards Dulwich.

Note on Centranthus Calcitrapa.
The following notice of 
649 
Centrantluxs Calcitrapa is at your service, if you think it worth insert- 
ing among your Varieties.
It is now fifty, if not sixty, years since I 
first saw this plant on a wall at Elthara, where it was well known to 
the London botanists, who, I believe, always thought it had es- 
caped from Sherard's garden, and it was therefore considered a natu- 
ralized plant, not to be admitted into a British Flora.
We also used, 
at the same time, to find it on the wall of a garden at Enfield, in Mid- 
dlesex, which had formerly been that of Dr. Uvedale, the friend of 
Plukenet, in which was then a celebrated cedar of Lebanon.
Not 
having been that way lately, I do not know the present state of the 
place.

Note o?i Myosotis sylvatica.
I find Myosotis sylvatica grow- 
ing abundantly in several ash plantations in this neighbourhood.
It 
flowers throughout the month of May and the early part of June, and 
during this period makes a very splendid appearance.
T have recent- 
ly observed a beautiful variety with pure white flowers, which I think 
is not common ; a specimen of it I now enclose, â€” Thomas Bentall ;

Note on Equisetum Jluviatile, Sm. It is highly desirable that 
the controversy respecting Equisetum fluviatile should be settled as 
early as possible, and surely there can be no great difliculty in the 
matter.
About Manchester it is one of our very common plants, grow- 
ing in woods, pastures, meadows, and moist gravelly banks, but I ne- 
ver yet met with it growing in water.
The nearest approach to the 
latter habitat is in the wood below Arden Hall, Cheshire, where it 
flourishes in a sicamp, to the height of six or seven feet.
Now the 
branched state of E.
limosum, which is not unlike fluviatile in gene- 
ral appearance, completely fills up many of the ponds in this neigh- 
bourhood, and I am therefore induced to think it possible that the two 
plants may sometimes have been confounded, and that thus the ques- 
tion as to the true habitat of E.
fluviatile has originated.
At Reddish, 
yesterday, I noticed a cow in one of the limosum ponds, eating ofi' 
the tops of this species ; but whether from a liking to the Equisetum, 
or to the Glyceria fluitans which was growing with it, I am unable to 
say.

Note on Fragaria elatior.
I am almost inclined to believe 
that the authors of the various works on the British Flora, must have 
written their descriptions of Fragaria vesca and elatior, without hav- 
ing seen specimens of the latter.
According to Sir W.
J. Hooker, 
the hairs of the pedicels are closely pressed in F.
vesca, but widely 
spreading in elatior ; this is the only character given by which we are 
3k 
650 
to know the two plants apart.
Dr. Withering gives no other, except 
size ; and, if I remember rightly.
Sir J.
E. Smith is equally obscure 
on this point.
When it is borne in mind that pubescence varies much 
with situation, the above character seems but a frail one to depend on, 
especially as there appears to me to be a far more striking distinction 
by which F.
elatior may at once be recognised.
In F.
vesca, the 
petals are white ^ both in the liml) and claw, and their length and 
hreadth are about equal, the limb has two slight notches, and the 
claw is very indistinct.
The petals in F.
elatior are in length only 
equal to two thirds of the hreadth ; the limb is white and perfectly 
entire, the claw is quite distinct, and bright yellow.
I found the two 
species growing together in Earl Bathurst's park, in this neighbour- 
hood, and was much struck with the difference between them ; the 
flowers of F.
elatior are far handsomer than those of vesca.

Note on Carex hoenninghausiana, Weihe.
I have for some 
time past had in my herbarium two specimens of a Carex labelled C.
axillaris, from Crichton Castle, Scotland.
I had long felt considera- 
ble doubt whether they were properly referred to that species ; though 
I was pretty certain they did not belong to C.
remota, to which the 
Crichton Castle plants are referred by Mr. Edmonston, (Phytol.
407 
and 522).
A few weeks ago I had occasion to send my Carices to 
Mr. Gibson, of Hebden Bridge, for his examination, but without ex- 
pressing my doubts of this species' being correctly named, as 1 did in 
several other instances.
On their return, I found that Mr. Gibson had 
pointed out the differences between my plants and the descriptions 
of C.
axillaris as given by Hooker, in the ' British Flora,' and by Mr.
Wilson and Dr. Wood, (Phytol.
299 and 300) as well as Mr. Leighton's 
figure of the fruit of C.
axillaris.
I now find that my plants are the 
C. hoenninghausiana of Weihe, a species introduced to the notice of 
British botanists by Mr. Babington, in his lately published Manual.
It 
has the habit of C.
axillaris, but differs from that species chiefly in 
the nearly entire beak of the fruit being " serrated from below the mid- 
dle," in the glumes about equalling the fruit, their midrib "not reach- 
ing the point," and in the bracts not being auricled at the base, but 
having a narrow brown ligule passing round the rachis.

Asperugo procumbens a Kentish Plant.
The cares and duties 
of the day being finished, I strolled out, a few evenings since, in the 
direction of the Abbey Wood, beyond Erith village, when after a 
lengthened ramble in the neighbourhood of Plurastead, and towards 
Plumstead church, I chanced to meet with a plant I had never before 
seen, and had not hoped to find in this county, namely, the extreme- 
ly scarce and interesting Asperugo procumbens, Linn.
It occurs 
sparingly in one or two places in a narrow bushy lane, part of the 
foot-way leading from the marshes at the Thames-side to Plumstead 
church-yard.
The plant appeared to have been somewhat injured â€” 
probably through the late almost incessant rains â€” but was in other 
respects very luxuriant and beautiful, Irvine, in his ' London Flora,' 
mentions the Asperugo as having been found in Essex, but, if I re- 
member rightly, does not give any recently verified habitat for it.
This notice is sent for publication in ' The Phytologist,' simply fi-om 
a sincere desire to add an humble mite of information to the general 
record already contained in the pages of that most useful periodical ; 
and therefore I should be exceedingly sorry to find that my having 
done so should lead to the eradication of this rare plant, in what I 
believe to be its only known station in Kent.
The Aspeiiigo is fra- 
gile and delicate, and, like its congeners, Lycopsis, Lithospermum, 
and other Boragineae, loses its beauty sadly in drying.

BOTANICAL SOCIETY OF EDINBURGH.
May n, 1843.
â€” Dr. Neill, President, in the chair.
John Kirk, Esq., was elected 
a resident fellow.
Mr. Brand read a communication from Dr. Joseph Dickson of St.
Helier's, Jersey, respecting some recent discoveries in the Flora of that island.
Dr. Neill communicated an interesting letter from Mr. Brackenridge, who was at 
one time a journeyman in the experimental garden here, and now holds the post of 
Iwtanical curator at Washington.
We insert full excerpts from his letter, the more 
readily, that his successful career may encourage others of his profession to similar ex- 
ertions.
Mr. Brackenridge writes :~" I spent the first fourteen months in the United 
States veiy much to my satisfaction, as foreman to Mr. Buist, who has one of the lar- 
gest plant establishments in America.
When the South Sea expedition was oro-anised 
I was induced by Mr. Poinsette, the Secretary of War, to accompany it in the capaci- 
ty of Assistant-botanist and Horticulturist.
The voyage lasted nearly four years, and 
my compensation during the last three years was 1200 dollars per annum.
The squad- 
ron (under the command of Lieutenant Wilkes) on its way out touched at Madeira, 
the whole of which we scoured.
I ascended the Peak of Ruivc (0246 feet high) almosL 
652 
to its very summit.
It is covered with dense forests of Erica arborea and Mediterra- 
nea (which some travellers have called Pine trees).
Several of these heath trees are 
forty feet high, and at eighteen inches from the ground their stems are two feet in di- 
ameter, â€” E.
Mediterranea always the largest.
At the very summit is a small species 
(perhaps new), in habit like Mr. M'Nab's E.
ramulosa.
The Madeira mahogany 
{Laurus Indica andfcetans) is in great abundance, and as large as English oaks.
In 
five days we collected 460 species of plants on the island.
At the Cape de Verds, Ru- 
biaceous annuals and grasses were the principal plants found.
But Brazil, at which 
we next touched, may be denominated the head-quarters of Flora.
I went about 150 
miles inland, in a N.E. direction, from Rio de Janeiro, travelling most of the way 
through forests of flowering trees, fantastically adorned with innumerable parasitical 
and epiphytal plants.
These trees were often propped up by aerial roots, which re- 
minded one of the rigging or stays of a ship.
The undergrowth in such places consists 
of palms, arborescent and many other ferns, with a goodly number of Solanaceous and 
Rubiaceous shrubs.
The Organ Mountains, seventy miles from Rio, after all that 
]\Ir. Gardner and others have done, abound in thousands of fine plants not yet known.
I spent about eight days on these mountains, and found plants so varied and attrac- 
tive that I did not know well which to select.
On rocks there are Gesnerias, Gloxi- 
nias, Cacti, Tillandsias and Orchideee in the greatest profusion.
I calculate that more 
than one half of the plants of Brazil are still unknown to botanists.
Insects, birds 
and quadrupeds are as varied, in proportion, as the vegetable kingdom.
We spent 
about two mouths on Tierra del Fuego.
Here was a contrast to Brazilian vegetation: 
stunted birches, with Misodendrums in tufts like birds' nests on their tops â€” scrubby 
barberries â€” winter bark â€” and Embothrium (a splendid Proteaceous shrub), were the 
characteristic features.
The face of the hills is covered with spongy, mossy turf, in 
which we found a Primula (like Scotica), Drosera, Pinguicula, several species of Per- 
uetlia, a Myrtus, and the charming Calixenia; with many nice things which I thought 
well adapted for your alpine frame.
" We reached Chili in the dry season, so that we did not find much in flower till 
we arrived at the mountains.
Behind Santiago, on the Andes, at the region of perpe- 
tual snow, we found an immense number of alpine plants belonging to genera and 
tribes new to us.
Figure to yourself ten or twelve kinds of Umbelliferous plants, with 
heath-like leaves, and fruit as large as that of Heracleum, and yet none of them over 
an inch in height.
In Peru, behind Lima, we crossed the Andes at the height of 
16,000 feet, and descended a considerable way on the opposite side, along one of the 
branches of the Amazon.
This was a rich journey for us in plants, â€” fine Rhododen- 
drons at the height of 13,000 feet.
At the base of the snow was a dense sward of 
plants, none of them over an inch high, principally composed of Saxifrages, Compo- 
sitJB, Gentianas, and curious Calceolarias.
At 14,000 feet we found vast patches of an 
Echinocactus, so wrapped up in its own wool, that at a distance we took the patches 
for sheep.
The scenery here was of the grandest kind.
We saw some splendid Cacti, 
Alstrcemerias and Tropaeolums, and on our way down, fields of T.
tuberosum and Ox- 
alis crenata.
Very little rain falls in the vicinity of Lima, so that to raise fruit and 
vegetables recourse must be had to irrigation.
The Cherimolia (Annona tripelala) is 
here the finest of all fruits I ever tasted.
"You will, no doubt, have heard of our discovering an Antarctic continent, (Ross 
says 'tis only a batch of islands).
Of this I can't speak, having been left at Sydney 
with the other scientific gentlemen.
Here we chartered a schooner, and v.ent to New 
653 
Zealand, where we spent eight weeks.
This same New Zeahxud is not the fine coun- 
try that the English government and land speculators crack it up to be.
The climate 
is very wet, and the soil cold and poor â€” consisting principally of a stiff yellow loam, 
on great part of which nothing grows but a species of Pteris, whose roots form the prin- 
cipal food of the natives.
The surface of the country round the Bay of Islands is ve- 
ry irregular, â€” high ridges and valleys succeeding each other in rapid succession.
In 
some of these valleys, from eight to ten species of Coniferous trees are found â€” among 
them the Courie pine {Agathis Australis) 120 feet high.
" Leaving New Zealand, we touched at Tongataboo on our way down to the Fiji 
Islands â€” 260 in number â€” all which we surveyed.
In doing this, two of our officers 
were brutally murdered by the natives.
We had also a proof of these islanders being 
cannibals, as they brought in a canoe, alongside of our ship, part of a human body, 
which they were eating.
We discovered several new islands on the line in passing to 
the Sandwich Isles.
The grandest sight seen during our cruize, was the volcano on 
the Island of Hawaii.
After spending six months on the north-west coast of America, 
our voyage lay again by the Sandwich Isles ; and searching for a near passage to the 
China Sea, we were led among the Sooloo Isles and Straits of Balabac, then down to 
Singapore, which is a very flourishing place.
Here 1 met a cousin of Sir Walter 
Scott's, who looks very much like what the old man was.
"During this voyage we collected and dried upwards of 10,000 species of plants; 
sending also a great many live ones and seeds to the National Institute at Washing- 
ton, to which I am at present attached.
To me the most interesting of these plants is 
a species of Nepenthes from Singapore, bearing pitchers much larger every way than 
those of the N.
distillatoria, and, when perfect, capable of holding a pint of watei*.
There are two other species at Singapore, one with many small pitchers in bunches, on 
a woody stem, found in pools of water, while the other covers a low sandy island in 
the Strait, about three miles oif the road-stead.
At Manilla there is a species distinct 
from any I have seen elsewhere." 
Professor Graham exhibited some very beautiful and interesting exotics, recently 
brought into flower in the greenhouses and stoves; and afterwards accompanied the 
members over the garden, which presented a most charming appearance.
Every sea- 
son it is becoming more and more developed ; and the late alterations reflect much 
credit on the learned Professor, and his able coadjutor, Mr. M'Nab.
June S, 1843.
â€” Professor Graham in the chair.
Donations were presented to the 
library from C.
C. Babington, Esq., Cambridge, (his 'Manual of British Botany'); 
from Dr. J.
K. Maly of Gratz ; L.
W. Dillwyn, Esq., and others.
Mr. James M'Nab exhibited specimens of Laburnum, presenting some remarkable 
anomalies.
He stated that several years ago, a tree was sent from the Epsom nursery 
to the Royal Botanic Garden here, as a curiosity, bearing three distinct varieties of 
laburnum on the same root, without any further engrafting than that of working the 
red laburnum on the yellow.
This tree is now to be seen in flower, the yellow and red 
flowers being predominant.
Last spring he observed a tree of the red laburnum in the 
Horticultural Garden, bearing several large tufts of Cytisus purpureus, with one small 
shoot of the yellow.
The same tree, this year, has ten distinct shoots of the yellow, 
and a quantity of those of C.
purpureus.
On Monday last, at Dysart house, he observed two trees, one bearing Cytisus pur- 
pureus and C.
Laburnum coccineum, the other C.
Laburnum and C.
Laburnum coc- 
cincum ; but neither of ihem having more than two varieties.
This afternoon he ex- 
654 
amined plants of the red labunmra in Messrs.
Lawson's nursery, three years grafted^ 
and found several of them producing shoots of the yelloiv, but only one of them hav- 
ino- C.
purpureus ; and in the nursery of Messrs.
J. Dickson and Sons, several of the 
plants, two years grafted, have shoots of the yellow but none of i\ie purple.
The red laburnum first appeared at Paris in 1828, in the nursery of Mr. Adam, 
and was a hybrid between the common laburnum and Cytisus purpureus.
Dr. Graham observed that it was difficult to explain the cause of this phenome- 
non, namely, of mules reproducing the different forms on one plant.
It had occurred 
also in plants of the Cactus tribe, but had no parallel in the animal kingdom --there 
the general form and habit merely are affected by crossing.
He considered the sub- 
ject to be one of much interest, as the phenomenon was at variance with the existing 
theories.
Mr. M'Nab exhibited recent specimens, in flower, of Orchis ustulata and Ophrys 
fucifera from Kent, which had been kindly procured by Lady Harvey for the meeting.
Dr. Douglas Maclagan presented to the Society, from Mr, John Scott, F.B.S., 
Greenock, a series of specimens of the more important kinds of timber in use for the 
purposes of ship-building.
The author mentioned, among others, the following kinds 
of timber.
: â€” Yellow pine {Pinm variabilis) from North America.
Pitch pine (P.
ri- 
gida) from Carolina.
Red pine (P.
resinosa) from Quebec.
These kinds are chiefly 
applicable to making deck-planks, or for light spars.
The American or rock elm {Ulmus Americana) and the black birch {Betula lento), 
were likewise noticed along with beechwood, as being the kinds best adapted for keels, 
bottom planks, and other parts of ships which are submersed in water.
British and American oak, and East Indian or Malabar teak {Tectona grandis), 
were mentioned as being of very general applicability to the purposes of the ship- 
wright, as also the African teak, or, as it is often called, African oak â€” the tree yielding 
which is still unknown to botanists.
Two varieties of hard and heavy woods were 
pointed out as being occasionally imported among African teak, and having similar 
qualities, but which are unknown to botanists or wood-merchants.
Of timbers imported from the West Indies, two deserve remark.
The first is the 
Mora or Morra timber Mora excelsa, Schomb.), which is a large and valuable timber, 
now introduced in considerable quantity from British Guiana : it has a foetid odour 
when scraped.
The other is the green-heart timber, produced by an unknown tree of 
British Guiana, a heavy, hard, and valuable timber, well adapted for ship-building, 
and now extensively used in the Clyde.
Dr. Maclagan had sent specimens of the 
fruit of this tree to Dr. Lindley and Sir W.
Hooker, both of whom considered it as 
Lauraceous, but had been unable to refer it to any known genus.
He stated to the 
Society that this tree was known in Demerara by the Indian name of Eebeeru, and 
also by the Dutch name Sipeeri ; and that the bark of it had been found, by Mr. Ro- 
die, to contain a vegetable alkaline matter, which possessed the power of curing agues.
Recent experiments of his own had shown that there were two distinct alkalies present 
in the bark and seeds of this tree.
Previous to the reading of these papers.
Professor Graham, accompanied by a large 
party, visited the greenhouses, where he pointed out some of the more rare and inte- 
resting plants, with which they are now literally crowded.
It was pleasing to see so 
many specimens, brought together from every climate and region, in the most thriving 
and luxuriant state, with scarcely an exception.

â€” John Reynolds, Esq., Treasurer, in the chair.
Donations to the library 
were announced from the Academy of Natural Sciences, Philadelphia, and Dr. Tilley.
Mr. W.
Andrews, Secretary of the Natural-History Society of Dublin, presented an 
interesting collection of Irish plants, comprising specimens of Arundo lapponica, Are- 
naria ciliata, Lathyrus maritimus, Trichomanes speciosum, several varieties of Saxi- 
fraga Geum, &c., many of them being from new localities.
Specimens of Anemone 
ranunculoides, found wild in a wood near Worksop, Nottinghamshire, were presented 
by Mrs. Margaret Stovin.
Mr. F.
Bainbridge presented a specimen of Lecidea Wah- 
lenbergii, Acharius, a lichen new to the British Flora.* 
Read, the continuation of a paper commenced at the last meeting, â€” "On the 
Groups into which the British Fruticose Rubi are divisible,'' by Mr. Edwin Lees, 
F.L.S., &c.
Before the Rubi can be adequately understood so as to be reduced into 
groups, their mode of growth must be fully investigated; and it will then perhaps be- 
come evident what points, from their greater permanency, are to be relied upon for 
general as well as specific characters.
The author had already traced the mode of growth of the British fruticose Rubi, 
in a paper read before the Botanical Society of Edinburgh.
The general idea of the 
biennial continuance of the Rubi is incorrect; all are triennial by the renewed growth 
of smaller flowering branches from the barren stems, or the bases of the withered pa- 
nicles of the second year, or by the barren stems shooting forlh a second crop of barren 
stems, which flower the third year; and that often the existence of an individual bram- 
ble, independently of fresh shoots from the root, is protracted to the fourth or fifth year.
The consequence of this is, that no specific distinction whatever can be drawn from 
the inflorescence, which may be long the second year, and is much shorter the third ; 
while it often happens that when a barren stem becomes prostrate, the panicles of flow- 
ers rising from the extreme end, are twice or thrice as long as those nearest the main 
shrub.
This fact of the extended growth of the Rubi has been lost sight of, and hence 
puzzling productions have been considered as new species, just as the R.
fastigiatus of 
Weihe and Nees is but a form of R.
plicatus, as is now admitted by Essenbeck him- 
self, from its exhibiting a smaller growth of third year's flowers.
Undoubtedly the barren stem off'ers the best, if not the only plan of discrimination 
in subdividing the Rubi into groups, especially if we take into consideration, in com- 
bination with it, the erect or arched mode of growth and continuance of vitality.
The 
leaves are so exceedingly variable, in shape, size and hoariness, as to be almost useless 
in this respect.
A table was appended to the paper, by which was seen at a glance 
what the difl'erences really were by which groups could be defined ; and it would ap- 
pear, in fact, that these resolve themselves almost entirely into the perfect smoothness, 
glaucosity, or more or less of hairiness and glandulosity of the barren stems.
Commencing then with Rubus caesius and ending with R.
Idaeus, it will appear 
that seven groups are easily separable from each other, and passing from one into the 
other, in a very natural manner.
These, at all events, may be considered the smallest 
number of species into which the Rubi can be classed, without confounding really dif- 
ferent things, while if we proceed further into minuter distinctions, these typical forms 
will become groups, under which the various varieties, species, or sub-species of each, 
will be referable.

Nees, R.

â€” Barren stem round, downy, covered with innumerable, small, dilated 
prickles, erect.
R. Tdaus and varieties.
There is, however, it must be admitted, an anomaly in the first group, which can 
only be got over by subdividing it into two (as done in the tabular view), for the ex- 
cessively glandulose assurgent stem of Rubus dumetorum has a very different aspect 
from the prostrate bloomy one of R.
csesius ; and yet it is demonstrable that the former 
is really derivable from the latter: so that although the blue berries of the dewberry 
would at first sight appear so discriminative, varieties arise with fruit altogether of a 
different aspect.
It must be borne in mind, however, that this is in a great degree in 
accordance with the well-known laws of cultivation.
Rubus dumetorum is R.
cassius 
excessively developed in leaves and flowers y'hnt the fruit is mostly abortive or imper- 
fect, while R.
csesius, in its normal prostrate form, with thin foliage and small flowers, 
produces on the humid ground the finest fruit of any of the fruticose Rubi.
The first group â€” Cassii â€” must therefore be necessarily divided into two-, but the 
other groups will be found to maintain the characters assigned them pretty correctly, 
and may therefore be depended on.
It is true that occasionally some of the Villicau- 
lae will exhibit a few glands on their stems or panicles, under circumstances of great 
luxuriance of growth or exposure, but nothing to be compared with the excessive de- 
gree of glandulosity of the Glandulosas.
Then it is true that the barren stem of the 
second group of Caesii is nearly as glandular as in the Glandulosae, but the former will 
show their aflanity with R.
csesius by the calyx being involute on the fruit, not reflex as 
in the latter.
The Fruticosi always preserve an independent marked character ; and the Nitidi, 
if, in one of their forms â€” R.
affinis â€” coming near to the Suberecti, may yet be always 
well distinguished by the arching barren stem, which, when exposed, is very stiff and 
rigid in the latter, almost as much so as in R.
Idseus.
This is well observable in the 
barren moors of North Wales.
Sketches of the barren stems of the different groups were exhibited.
That the 
forms of each group sport into each other according to situation and exposure, without 
much limitation, is highly probable, but Mr. Lees had met with no decided cases of 
hybridity.
Specimens of various species accompanied the paper, and are deposited in 
the Society's herbarium.

Cellular body as seen after the time of fecundation, with the hair-like projection (e), magnified 
about 300 times.
In Lindley's Natural System, edition 2, there is an interesting ac- 
count of the ovulum of Plumbagineae, which however is not quite ac- 
curate.
Instead of the ovulum in Statice Armeria having its foramen 
3l 
658 
covered by the strap-like funiculus previous to fecundation, and the 
funiculus subsequently pushed aside by the protrusion of a cellular 
body proceeding from the base of the styles, I find that previous to 
the expansion of the flower this cellular body is intimately united to 
the apex of the secundine of the ovulum, and remains thus attached 
until fecundation is effected, (see fig.
1 and 2) : consequently the fu- 
niculus, in every stage, occupies a lateral position.
At the exact pe- 
riod of fecundation there is reason to believe that the cellular body 
penetrates the apex of the nucleus by a very minute aperture ; because 
when the embryo just becomes visible within the nucleus at its apex 
(suspended from a mass of spongy cellular tissue), there is sometimes 
to be seen a hair-like process terminating the cellular body (now dis- 
united from the secundine, and by its shrinking, at some distance 
above it) as though a pollen- tube had passed down from above into 
the nucleus.
Those who hold the views of Schleiden will find the 
appearances extremely plausible, (see iig.
5).
The cellular body, as 
it appears at the time of fecundation (see fig.
4) is such as to induce 
the supposition that the vesicular body {d) may be the origin of the 
embryo, and may also perhaps be the bulbed extremity of a pollen- 
tube ; but this is at variance with all that I have yet witnessed in other 
tribes.
The part markedy (magnified about 300 times) appears to be 
the truncated extremity of a tube which may have been continued 
into the nucleus, the apex of which consists of loose cellular tissue, 
and may have a very minute aperture ; but this, as well as the aper- 
ture of the secundine, can be very imperfectly made out by actual 
observation.
That the hair-like process of the cellular body (fig.
5) 
has in some way penetrated into the nucleus is almost certain, and 
need not be disputed.
At fig.
3, the embryo is shown as it appears shortly after fecunda- 
tion.
The upper body within the nucleus is a mass of spongy cellu- 
lar tissue, and the roundish body below is the embryo, with its two 
wide-spreading lobes (not seen in the figure from its position), which 
form the cotyledons when the embryo has filled up the cavity of the 
nucleus.
Previous to fecundation the nucleus has no trace whatever 
either of the embryo or of the cellular tissue from which it is suspend- 
ed.
It constitutes the albumen of the perfect seed, and is much thick- 
ened towards the lower part.
Plants belonging to the order Plumbagineae are remarkable for hav- 
ing five styles or pollen-ducts and only one ovulum.
Assuming that 
the embryo is formed by the extremity of a pollen-tube, what is to pre- 
vent the occasional presence of two or more embryos in the ovulum ?

Wan-ington, July 7, 1843.
[We give below Dr. Givaud's article from the ' Proceedings of the Linnean Socie- 
ty,' where it originally appeared.
â€” Ed.'] 
" After referring to the researches of MM.
Schleiden, Wydlev, Mirbel and Spach, 
and A.
St. Hilaire, on this important point, Dr. Giraud states that he was induced to 
select Tropseolum as the subject of his own observations, on account of its solitary 
ovula, and their comparatively large size, which render the individuals of this family, 
as well as the allied Geraniaceas, peculiarly fitted for the purpose.
He arranges his 
observations under seven general heads, coiTesponding with as many progressive pe- 
riods in the growth of the female organs, and extending from the completion of the 
anatropous development of the ovule to the perfect formation of the embryo ; or from 
the commencement of the expansion of the bud to the complete formation of the 
fruit.
The results are collected from a great number of dissections.
" In the Jirst period, or just before the expansion of the bud, a longitudinal sec- 
tion of the carpellum from its dorsum towards the axis of the pistillum, dividing the 
ovule, shows the latter to have completed its anatropous development.
A portion of 
rather firm and dense cellular tissue, enclosing a bundle of vessels, descends from the 
placenta and in apposition with it to form the raphe, and terminates in the base of the 
ovule.
The nucleus has only one integument, at the apex of which is the exostome 
or micropyle, opening close by and to the outside of the point of attachment ; and 
the conducting tissue of the style may be traced into the carpellary cavity as far as 
the exostome.
" In the second period, during which the expansion of the bud and the dehiscence 
of the anthers commence, and therefore, before impregnation, a small elliptical cavity 
makes its appearance near the apex of the nucleus, having a delicate lining membrane 
formed by the walls of the surrounding cells : this cavity is the embryo-sac, and a mi- 
nute canal may be traced leading from it to the exostome.
The apex of the embryo- 
sac encloses at this period a quantity of organizable mucilage, containing many mi- 
nute bodies, having the appearance and character of cytoblasts.
" In the third period, the apex of the nucleus and of its integument, becomes 
slightly inclined towards the placenta.
The embryo-sac is much enlarged and length- 
ened ; its mucilage has disappeared and given place to an elongated diaphanous 
utricle {utricule primordiale, Mirbel ; vesicule embrijonnaire, Meyen ; extrhnite mite- 
rieure du boyau pollinirjue, Schleiden) containing a quantity of globular matter or 
cytoblasts.
This primary utricle is developed wholly within the embryo-sac, from 
which it is obviously distinct.
" The fourth period occurs after impregnation.
The pollen tubes do not extend 
into the carpellary cavity ; but the fovilla, with its granules, is found abundantly in 
the passage leading from the style to the exostome.
With the increased development 
of the embryo-sac, the primary utricle elongates and becomes distinctly cellular, by 
the development of minute cells in its interior, while at the extremity next the base 
3 L 2 
660 
of tlie luicleus it is terminated by a splierical mass consisting of globular cells.
The 
primary utricle at this period assumes the character of the suspensor (Mirbel), and its 
spherical extremity constitutes the first trace of the embryo.
" In \he fifth period, the apex of the nucleus and of its integument becomes more 
inclined towards the placenta ; the spherical extremity of the suspensor enlarges, and 
it becomes more evident that it constitutes the rudimental embryo.
In the mean time 
the suspensor has become lengthened by an increase in the number of its cells ; and 
its upper extremity is found to be protruded through the apex of the embryo-sac, the 
apex of the nucleus and the micropyle.
From this extremity there is a considerable 
development of cells, many of which hang loosely in the passage leading to the con- 
ducting tissue of the style, while the rest unite in forming a process which passes 
down the outer side of the ovulum within the carpellary cavity.
This process is com- 
posed of from nine to twelve rows of cells, and its extremity resembles in appearance 
and in the anatomical condition of its cells the spongiole of a root.
By a slight trac- 
tion of this cellular process, the suspensor with the embryo may be withdrawn from the 
embryo-sac through the exostome, thus proving the continuity of the process with the 
suspensor, and through it with the embryo itself.
" During the sixth period the suspensor becomes more attenuated ; and the cellular 
process has reached the base of the ovulum, the cells of its extremity abounding with 
cytoblasts, which prove that it is still progressing in development.
The embryo also 
increases in size, and two lateral processes are observed, which evidently fonn the 
first traces of the cotyledons.
" In the seventh period, all distinction between the nucleus and its integument 
ceases, and they form a single envelope enclosing the embryo-sac ; the cellular pro- 
cess has become so much developed, that its extremity has passed round the base of 
the ovulum and is directed towards the placenta ; and the lateral processes of the em- 
bryo have become distinct fleshy cotyledons, enclosing both the radicle and plumule 
in corresponding depressions of their opposed surfaces.
The subsequent changes 
consist chiefly in the great development of the cotyledons, which ultimately occupy 
the entire cavity of the nucleus, filling the space usually taken up by albumen.
" From these observations Dr. Giraud deduces the following inferences.
" The formation of the embryo-sac, and the development of cytoblasts within it, 
having been shown to take place at a period prior to impregnation, and even the pri- 
mary utricle itself making its appearance before the emission of the pollen from the 
anther, and before the expansion of the stigma, the origin of the primary utricle can- 
not be referred to the influence of impregnation, nor can it have been derived from 
the pollen tube pressing before it a fold of the embryo-sac.
" The primary utricle at its first formation being quite distinct from the embryo- 
sac, even at its apex (although brought into contact with it at a subsequent period, 
and ultimately penetrating it), cannot result from a depression or involution of the 
embryo-sac, as is maintained by M.
Brongniart.
" The pollen tubes (which after impregnation may be traced in the conducting 
tissue of the style) never reaching the micropyle, but pollen granules being found in 
abundance in the channel leading to it, and being doubtless brought into contact with 
the outer surface of the embryo-sac through the exostome ; and the first trace of the 
embryo appearing at this time in the formation of the spherical body at the inferior 
extremity of the primary utricle â€” Dr. Giraud is led to conclude that the origin of this 
simple spherical body results from a peculiar process of nutrition, determined by the 
661 
material or dynamic influence of the fovilla, conveyed through the medium of the 
primary utricle or suspensor.
" The paper was accompanied by a series of drawings representing the ovulum of 
Tropseolum in the several stages of development described.'' â€” ^Proceedings of the Lin- 
nean Society,^ February 1, 1842: p.

â€” List of the Cryptogamic Plants of Oxfordshire.^ 
By Ph. B.
Ayres, Esq., M.D.
Tharae, May 18, 1843.
Sir, 
I inclose you a list of the Cryptogamic Flora of Oxford- 
shire, as far as it has been at present examined, compiled from a ma- 
nuscript list of Mr. Baxter's, with such additions as I have been able 
to make.
It will be seen that very little has been done towards form- 
ing a complete list for the county, as most of the localities given are 
in the immediate neighbourhood of Oxford, and the country towards 
the northern extremity has had little attention paid to it.
I have no 
doubt that that part of the county would repay the investigation, since 
in my own neighbourhood I have found two species, which Mr.
Berkeley has determined to be new to the British Flora.
I am.
Sir, 
Your obedient Servant,

â€” Notice of ' A Visit to the Australian Colonies.
By 
James Backhouse.' London: Hamilton, Adams & Co. 1843.
(Continued from p.
608).
Wellington Valley appears to be the most inland point reached 
by our observant traveller.
At the end of September 1835 he set out 
on his return to Sydney, which place he reached on the 30th of the 
following month.
But few botanical observations appear to have been 
made by the way : we extract the following.
" In the lower altitudes of the mountains the advance of spring was more striking.
Telopea speciosissima, forming low bushes, with heads of flowers as large as small pae- 
onies, was in full blossom.
The Blue-Mountain parrot, partly blue, and with a breast 
of crimson, as brilliant as the flowers, was drinking nectar out of the blossoms of this 
splendid shrub ; and a brown honey-eater was darting its tongue, like a slender pencil 
of hair, into the elegant pink flowers of Grevillea linearis.
Gompholobium grandiflo- 
rum, a large, yellow, pea-flowered shrub, of great beauty, and several species of Platy- 
lobium, Daviesia, Boronia and Eriostemon, enlivened the solitude and beguiled the 
walk, of thirty-one miles, through this dreary forest, which we accomplished in ten 
hours."~p.
336.
After a visit of some months to Van Diemen's Land, J.
Backhouse 
returned to Sydney on the 22nd of February, 1836; and in company 
with Mr. MacLeay and other gentlemen, visited a collection of vines, 
amounting to three hundred varieties, among which, under French 
names, are most of those cultivated for the table in England.
He 
speaks of the Sydney botanic garden as a fine institution, and furnish- 
ed with a good collection of native and foreign plants.
Remaining 
but a short time at Sydney, he sailed in the Isabella for Moreton Bay, 
between six and seven degrees further north, that is, in latitude about 
27Â° 20' S.
On the 29th of March, while walking a few miles down 
665 
the Brisbane river towards a brook called Breakfast Creek, the waters 
of which are generally brackish at high tide, several remarkable plants 
were observed.
" On the margins of the brook, Acrostichum fraxinifolium, a large ash-leaved fern, 
was growing, along with Crinuin pedunculatum, a great bulbous-rooted plant, with 
white, tubular, lily-like flowers.
Hellenia caerulea, a reedy-lookiug plant, with broad 
leaves and blue berries, and a species of Phytolacca, with pretty pink blossoms, were 
among the brush-wood.
By the sides of fresh-water ditches there were a Jussiaea, re- 
sembling an evening primrose, with small yellow blossoms, and a blue-flowered plant, 
in figure like a Pentstemon.
On the grassy slope of the hills, near the river.
Hibiscus 
Fraseri, with yellow blossoms, like those of the hollyhock, but having a deep purple 
eye, was in flower.'' â€” p.
359.
And again, a forest, called Three-mile Scrub, visited on the 2nd of 
April, seems to have been found replete with interest.
" Some of the trees far exceed 100 feet in height, a few may be 150.
Among the 
lofty ones may be enumerated some Eucalypti, called iron-bark, forest-mahogany, &c.
and three species of fig, with leaves resembling those of laurel or Magnolia.
One of 
these, Ficus macrophylla, was forty feet in circumference at the greatest height that I 
could reach : its roots formed wall-like abutments, extending from the tree, over an 
area thirty feet across.
These fig-trees are very remarkable in their growth : they of- 
ten spring from seeds, deposited by birds in cavities of other trees, at elevations of, per- 
haps, fifty feet or more.
From these situations they send roots down to the ground, which, 
in their course, adhere to the tree ; these again emit transverse or diagonal roots, that 
fix themselves to others, in their course downward.
Those that reach the ground 
thicken rapidly, still spreading themselves upon the face of the foster tree, which, at 
length, is completely encased.
These gigantic parasites rear their towering heads 
above all the other trees of the forest, sending out vast limbs, and spreading their own 
roots in the earth, from which also they sometimes grow, without the aid of other trees 
to sustain them.
" The trunks and limbs of these, and other trees, support several species of fem, 
and some epiphytes of the Orchis tribe, with fleshy leaves, and singular stems and 
flowers.
Numerous climbing plants, with stems varying in thickness, from that of 
packthread to that of a man's body, ascend into their tops, and send down their branch- 
es in graceful festoons.
Among the slenderer climbers were two species of passion- 
flower and one of jasmine.
The most gigantic climber, which might properly be called 
a climbing tree, belonged to a race of plants called Apocyneae : it had rugged bark, 
and sometimes formed a few serpent-like wreaths upon the ground before ascending, 
and spreading itself among the tops of the other trees.
There were also three species 
of Cissus ; one of them with simple, and the other two with trifoliate leaves : these are 
kinds of vine, bearing grapes, about equal in size to English sloes, but sweeter.
The 
fruit of the figs is rather dry, but it is eaten by the native blacks and by numerous birds.
The Moreton Bay chesnut, CastanospeiTnum australe, is a fine tree, with a profusion 
of flame-coloured blossom, and with leaves like those of the European walnut.
Some 
of its pods are ten inches long and eight round ; they contain several seeds, in size and 
colour resembling horse-chesnuts, but, in flavour, between a Spanish chesnut and a 
fiesh-ripened bean, with a slight degree of bitterness.
The blacks roast them, and soak 
666 
them in water, to prepare them for food.
Acrostichum grande, one of the ferns that 
grow on the trees, is as large as a full-grown Scotch cabbage, and is remarkably beau- 
tiful.
Caladium glycirrhizon, a plant allied to the Arum, and one of the race called 
Tara, the roots of which afford food to the islanders of the Pacific, abounds in these 
woods.
The root is beaten and roasted by the aborigines, till it is deprived of its acri- 
mony ; it is then eaten, and is said to be pleasant to the taste.
In the margins of the 
woods, and on the banks of the rivers, the climbers are also numerous, and very beau- 
tiful.
Among them are Tecoma jasminoides, a large, white trumpet-flower, with a ro- 
sy pink tube, and Ipomoea pendula, before noticed as bearing elegant, pink, convolvu- 
lus-like blossoms.
In the grass of the open ground is a remarkable climbing nettle, 
and in the forests, the giant nettle, Urtica gigas, forms a large tree.
Many of the hills 
in this neighbourhood are dry, and covered with quartzose gravel.
On these, the trees 
are chiefly of the genera Eucalyptus, Tristania, Casuarina and Acacia.
In the basal- 
tic soils Altingia Cunninghamii, the Moreton Bay pine, is interspersed ; and in some 
places, further into the interior, it forms large woods." â€” p.
361.
On the 4th of April our traveller visited Eagle Farm, a settlement 
six miles from Brisbane Town towards the mouth of the river of the 
same name.
On the way he noticed a beautiful Pavonia, with a rosy 
purple blossom, shaded deeply towards the centre ; also a splendid 
Loranthus, with foliage like that of a lemon, and clusters of crimson 
tubular flowers tipped with yellow.
The beautiful blue Ipomoea he- 
deracea was also in blossom.
" In a wood, on the margin of the river, a few miles above Brisbane Town, I met 
with a species of lime.
Citrus, having small diversified leaves, and fruit the size of a 
walnut ; it formed a tree fifteen feet high.
Flindersia australis, Oxleya zanthoxyla, 
and Cedrella Toona ?
trees of the same tribe as the mahogany, attain to a large size 
in these forests.
Oxleya zanthoxyla is the yellow wood of Moreton Bay: one I mea- 
sured, was forty feet round at about five feet up : it was supposed to be one hundred 
feet high.
The Cedrella is the cedar of N.
S. Wales ; the wood of which resembles 
mahogany, but is not so heavy.
The silk oak, Grevillea robusta, also forms a large 
tree : its foliage is divided, like that of some Umbelliferous plants ; its flowers are 
somewhat like branched combs, of crooked yellow wire, shaded into orange, and are 
very handsome.
Hoya Brownii, and Jasminum gracile?
were abundant on the bank of 
the river, along with Tecoma jasminoides, and many other curious and beautiful 
climbing shrubs.
Eleven epiphytes, of the Orchis tribe, were growing on the trunks 
of the trees in the forest.
Most of these were of the genera Dendrobium, Cymbidium 
and Gunnia.
Some bananas, which had been washed from a place in the limestone 
country above, where sheep, for the provision of the settlement, are kept, had establish- 
ed themselves on the borders of a creek.
Pumpkins were growing among the brush- 
wood, in great luxuriance.
The last were observed, with evident pleasure, by my boat's 
crew of prisoners, who anticipated making a meal of them, at a future day.
They are 
much used as a table vegetable, in New South Wales, and are certainly to be valued 
as such, in this climate ; they keep well, and are a good substitute for potatoes, or for 
turnips, by land or by sea." â€” p.
364.
The forest about the Pilot's station, situated at the north point of 
Stradbroke Island, consists of Eucalyptus, Melaleuca and Banksia, 
667 
mixed with the cypress pine, Callitris arenosa ; and the sand on the 
shore was bound together by maritime grasses, the large yellow-flow- 
ered Hibbertia volubilis, and Ipomcea maritima, with its large, pink, 
convolvulus-like flowers, and curious two-lobed leaves.
On the mud- 
dy land within the reach of high tides, were a species of mangrove 
and a Bruguiera.
*' The mangrove resembles a thick-leaved laurel, and has roots from its stem above 
ground, like the stays of the mast of a ship : its fruit is about an inch in diameter, and 
it vegetates as it hangs on the bush, and sends out a green radicle, about a foot long, 
and swollen toward the pointed base; this, bearing the germ on its top, drops from the 
fruit, and either sticks in the mud and vegetates, or floats in the sea, till landed on 
some congenial spot, or till it perishes.
The Bruguiera forms a fine bush, eight or 
ten feet high, and has the bell-shaped cup to its evanescent petals in substance resem- 
bling red morocco leather, and cut into ten narrow segments.
Its mode of propagation 
is similar to the former, but its radicle is shorter, and not swollen towards the base.
These gay, red-leather-like flowers, and long, green, spindle-like radicles, were washed 
up abundantly on the shore, and till I saw them growing, they puzzled me not a lit- 
tle."â€” p.

On Moreton Island the same plants occurred, together with a Scae- 
vola, with brilliant blue flowers and black berries.
In the sandy pla- 
ces more inland, " Pandanus pedunculatus, a species of screw pine, 
forms a singular tree, fifteen feet high.
Its leaves resemble those of 
the pine-apple ; its fruit is as large as a child's head, yellow, and com- 
posed of clustered oblong nuts, fleshy at the base, which separate in 
attached groups when ripe.
The fleshy part is eaten by the blacks ; but 
it has an unpleasant smell, and though sweetish, is rather acrid.
The 
trunk is supported securely by roots, that descend from various parts of 
it, into the sand, and are as thick and straight as broom-sticks ; they 
look rather like the stays of a ship." Some steep sand hills "were over- 
grown by Myrtus tenuifolia, a myrtle of low stature, with naiTow 
leaves, and sweet, aromatic, white berries, spotted with purple.
These 
are the most agreeable native finiit I have tasted in Australia ; they 
are produced so abundantly as to aff'ord an important article of food 
to the aborigines." Near the east coast was a yellow Crotalaria, and 
three species of ferns, Lygodium microphyllum, Pteris esculenta and 
Blechnum cartilagineum.
At Newcastle, where he appears in the first instance to have been 
driven by stress of weather, on his return to Sydney from Moreton 
Bay, our traveller observed that many open places in the forests 
abounded with gigantic lily, from ten to twenty feet in height.
The 
stems of this plant, at a foot and a half high, are thicker than a man's 
arm ; they are roasted and eaten by the natives.
The roots of this 
668 
lily are also roasted, made into a sort of cake, and eaten cold by the 
natives : " tliey likewise roast and pound the seeds of Zamia spiralis, 
and then place the mass for two or three weeks in water, to take out 
the bitter principle, after which it is eaten." At Maitland, forty miles 
from Newcastle, by the Hunter river, some of the trees were clothed 
with shaggy lichens, and supported the golden mistletoe : and " the 
elk's-horn fern, Acrostichum alcicorne, which in Port Jackson gene- 
rally grows on decomposing sandstone rocks, forms here protuberant 
girdles round the trunks of trees, among the branches of which Ipo- 
moea pendula and Marsdenia fragrans are striking climbers," Still 
further up the Hunter River, Kennedia ovata, a species of Tecoma, 
Sicyos australis, Nicotiana undulata, a species of Cannabis, and seve- 
ral other striking plants were growing on the banks.
In the adjacent 
woods, called cedar- brushes, from the occurrence of Melia Azederach 
or the white cedar, Eugenia myrtifolia and Ficus Muntia were observ- 
ed.
" The former resembles a large broad-leaved myrtle, and attains 
to twenty feet in height ; its fruit, which is now ripe, is about the size 
of a cherry, but oblong and purple, with a mixture of sweet and acid.
Ficus Muntia is a spreading fig, growing as large as an apple-tree.
Where its branches touch the ground, they root, and send up erect 
shoots, forming a succession of trees.
The insipid fruit, which is 
about the size of a gooseberry, is sometimes produced from the bare 
trunk and boughs, as well as from the leafy branches, giving the tree 
a very unusual appearance.
These cedar-brushes are also thick with 
climbers, such as Cissus antarctica, the kangaroo vine, Eupomatia 
laurinee, a briary bush allied to the custard- apple, but with inferior 
fruit, and several Apocynese." 
Near Raymond's Terrace, where there is a manufactory of earthen- 
ware, â€” 
" Sarcostemma australe, a remarkable leafless shrub, with green, succulent, climb- 
ing stems, as thick as a quill, and bearing clusters of white flowers, resembling those 
of a Hoya, was growing on some rough conglomerate rocks.
In the more fertile spots, 
by the sides of brooks, there was a species of yam, the root of which is eaten by the 
aborigines, as well as Eugenia trinervis, and another shrub of the myrtle tribe, and 
Logania floribunda, a privet-like bush, with small, white, fragrant blossoms.
The 
country toward Port Stephens, whither we next proceeded, was decorated with Acacia 
longifolia, and some others of that genus, with lively yellow flowers, and with Bursa- 
ria spinosa, which is fragrant and white, Lambertia formosa, a stifi" bush, with beautiful 
deep criinson flowers, and Dillwynia parvifolia, with pretty orange blossoms." â€” p.
399.
At Port Stephens, Swainsonia galegifolia, a low suffruticose bush, 
with white or pink pea-flowers, was remarkably pretty.
A little fur- 
thev to the north, on the Wilson river, near Port MacquarrLe, the 
brushes are very magnificent.
" The trees, some of which are of gigantic size, are overrun with climbing, ever- 
green shrubs, twisted about them in fanciful coils, or wreathed around them like huge 
serpents, or hanging from them like ropes ; their leafy tops being enlivened by gay 
and fragrant blossoms, and often hanging pendent to the ground, which is covered 
thickly with beautiful shrubs, ferns, and flowering plants, nourished by the moisture 
of the rich alluvial soil, and kept from the parching influence of the sun by the exu- 
berant foliage.
Mosses, epiphytes of the Orchis tribe, and splendid ferns, as well as 
various species of fig-tree, support themselves on the trunks and branches of the larger 
timber, and add greatly to the richness of this kind of forest scenery ; among which, 
gay parrots, cockatoos, and other birds, unlike those of our native land, sport and chat- 
ter in harmony with the rest of the surrounding objects, which are strongly calculated 
to remind an Englishman that he is far from home, even though he may have made this 
his adopted country," â€” p.

The neighbourhood of Port Macquarie is rich in the diversity of its 
vegetation, and the vt'hole of the following passage is so replete with 
interest, that we feel confident it will prove acceptable to our readers.
" The vegetation here is very striking.
On our return to Port Macquarie, we no- 
ticed a shrubby, white-flowered Helichrysum, two species of Cassia, Tasmania insipida, 
Ficus microphylla, ferrugiiiea, and another species, Hibiscus splendens, with blossoms 
six to nine inches across, Hibiscus heterophyllus, and a shrub with white flowers, al- 
lied to Sida, but of a distinct genus, having five red glands at the base of the common 
filament, also a singular climbing plant belonging to the Aroideae, adhering to the 
trees, along with Dischidia nummularia, Polypodium quercifoliura and attenuatum, 
Dendrobium tetragouum, linguiforme, eemulum and calamifolium.
In some places 
the country is undulating and grassy.
It is adapted for horned cattle, and suff'ers less 
from drought than many other parts of N.
S. Wales.
" 9th.
I took a walk into the wood, on Tacking Point, on the coast south of Port 
Macquarie.
The road from Lake Cottage lay through the Catlii Marsh, part of which 
was crossed by a long and imperfect bridge of logs.
Blandfordia grandiflora deco- 
rated some of the open forest, in which several of the gum-trees were supporting a va- 
riety of parasitical figs.
A grass-tree swamp intervened between the bridge and the 
shore.
On the borders of the swamp, where the ground was sandy, with a small mix- 
ture of vegetable matter, several species of Boronia, Epacris, and Euphrasia, were in 
flower, along with Sowerbsea juncea, a handsome Comesperma, a species of Sprenge- 
lia, &c.
On the drier sand hills there were Banksia serrata and spinulosa, Platylo- 
bium foiTOosum, Roeperia pinifolia, a species of Pultenaea which formed dense patches, 
and Kennedia ovata and rubicunda, ^c.
Close upon the coast, Pandanus peduncu- 
latus was of inferior growth to that at Moreton Bay. In a marsh at Tacking Point, 
chiefly occupied by Melaleuca paludosa, and bordered by a large, silver-flowered, wil- 
low-leaved Helichrysum, Todaea africana?
had become arborescent, and formed a 
beautiful tree-fern, with fronds six feet long, on a trunk three feet high.
It was grow- 
ing with an Alsophila, the trunk of which was much slenderer than that of the A.
aus- 
tralis of V.
D. Land, and with a large Crinum and Caladium glycirrhizon.
In the 
forest, there were many noble trees, similar to those in the neighbouring woods, but 
670 
liere they were intermingled with abundance of Seaforthia elegans, a noble, feather- 
leaved palm, forty feet in height.
The small palm already noticed was also here, and 
a tall Cyperaceous ?
plant, growing into the trees, and again bending toward the 
ground, with a stem as thick as a ratan.
One of the parasitical figs had sent a root 
down from a lofty bough, remote from the trunk, and the root, which must have swung 
like a rope, had a diagonal direction, and was adhering at its lower extremity to the 
foster tree !
Some Casuarinae were encircled by masses of Acrostichum alcicorne.
This fern retains much moisture in its dead sterile fronds, which fonn large scales, ris- 
ing one over another, it generally grows on the upper portion of the trunks of the Ca- 
suarinae, and in stormy weather, they are sometimes thrown down by the weight of 
water and vegetable matter, thus accumulated about them.
Many thus circumstanced 
were lying in the forest, having a profusion also of Davallia pyxidata growing out of 
the masses of Acrostichum alcicorne.
Other trees, ferns, and flowering plants, were 
here in great variety.
"Whilst admiring the rich profusion of the vegetable productions, and conversing 
with some wood-cutters, I insensibly got turned round, and toward evening, on refer- 
ring to my compass, found myself making rapid progress in a direction opposite to the 
one I ought to have pursued.
What gave to this place the name of Tacking Point I 
know not, but its name harmonized with my present circumstances ; and to use a sea 
phrase, I ' tacked ' without delay, being desirous to escape from the dense forest before 
sun-set.
" I had become hungry, and looked longingly to the tops of the majestic palms, 
without the hope of reaching one of them ; but at length, I came to one, which, from 
some accident, had turned its head downward, so that it seemed to be put exactly into 
my path.
I cut it off", stripped away the base of the leaves, to the tender heart, and 
went along, enjoying my grateful meal, thankful to Him who had brought me and 
the crooked palm, as by accident, into contact.
The supply was so ample, that when 
I reached my friends at the Lake Cottage, after a toilsome journey through the marsh, 
in the dark, I had a piece, as thick as my wrist, and a foot and a half long, under my 
arm, reserved for supper, in case I should have found it impracticable to reach my 
quarters, and have been under the necessity of remaining under the bushes of the sand 
hills, on the coast, during the night.
" Among the sedgy plants in the margin of Lake Innis, there is a large species of 
Eriocaulon.
Several other species of this genus occur in N.
S. Wales, and one in the 
west of Scotland,* but its maximum is in America.
Plants are subject to a remarka- 
ble geographical distribution, which it is very interesting to trace out.
The remark- 
able section of the genus Acrostichum, which includes A.
grande and A.
alcicorne, has 
at least one species in India, and another in Western Africa.
A. grande grows to a 
large size, on trees bordering on Lake Innis.
One measured, had the upper or barren 
fronds three feet across, and as much in height.
There were two mature barren fronds, 
that had strong black nerves, and the same number of fertile ones.
From the opposite 
extremities of the appendages of the latter, the measurement was seven feet.
Some 
of these appendages were of ten ribbon-like divisions, many of which were bifid.
The 
central portion might be compared to a jockey's saddle, attached by the pummel.
* Eriocaulon septangulare, found in the lakes and pools of Skye and some of the 
neighbouring islands ; and in Cunnamara, Ireland.
â€” Ed.
671 
From tbis point to the extreme margin, was a foot and a half, and this portion was two 
feet across.
The fructification formed a half-moon shaped patch, under the exterior 
portion, that extended one foot from the margin, toward the point of the attachment, 
and was a foot and a half across.
A young, white, barren frond, almost circular, was 
placed in front of the two older ones, to which it was closely pressed.
Behind these, 
there were several dead, spongy, old fronds, that retained much moisture, and were pe- 
netrated by numerous spongy roots, such as were also spread behind them, on the bark 
of the tree that supported this remarkable fern, the colour of which was bluish green, 
covered with a whitish powder.'' â€” ^p.

Aaplenium viride and Ham Bridge.
I had long noted Ham 
Bridge as a spot worthy of a visit, on account of its producing a fern 
alien to the whole district in which it is situated, (Phytol.
46) ; so I 
resolved to make it an object of pilgrimage.
1 was on foot, and 
wended my way from Sapey Brook (rendered illustrious by the disco- 
veries of Jabez Allies, Esq.), along the rich valley of the Teme, through 
meadows clothed with luxuriant herbage, and among cattle fatting for 
the Smithfield show.
As I approached the bridge, the red bricks of 
which it is built, and the dry and dusty road which passed over it, 
seemed in no degree to increase the chance of my success : yet on 
that bridge, facing the road- way and covered with dust, was the iden- 
tical plant I sought â€” small indeed, but the species not to be mista- 
ken.
The parapet wall of the bridge is unusually high, but by some 
exertion I contrived to overcome this difficulty, and succeeded in ob- 
taining piecemeal a good view over both the sides.
The bridge ap- 
pears to be of some antiquity, and is robed in many places with ample 
plants of Parietaria ; in a few spots, Asplenium Trichomanes and A.
Ruta-muraria have established themselves.
I saw two or three small 
plants of Polypodium vulgare, and about as many of Asplenium vi- 
ride.
Having resolved not to exterminate the latter plant, and yet 
being desirous of convincing the most sceptical of my success, I took 
some little specimens which faced the roadway, leaving others to reward 
the labours of future pilgrims.

Cystopferis montana a British Fern.
This beautiful fern, 
which seems to occur in nearly all the alpine regions of Europe, was 
discovered by Mr. Wilson in Scotland in 1836.
It has generally been 
672 
described as an Aspidium, but a glance at Schkuhr's figure of the 
fi-uctification will show that Presl is right in referring it to the genus 
Cystopteris montana.

Note on the preservation of Colour in specimens of Plants by 
immersing them in Boiling Water.
In the Report of Proceedings of 
the Botanical Society of Edinburgh (Phytol.
189), Mr. Evans is said 
to have preserved the colour of Lathraea squamaria, Asperula odorata, 
&c., by immersing them in boiling water for a short time.
Mr.
Sidebotham tells us (Id. 233) that he has tried the experiment, as 
described by Mr. Evans, and that with him hot water turned Lathrsea 
squamaria blacker than when prepared in the usual way.
Since Mr.
Sidebotham expresses surprise at the experiment failing in his hands, 
it would be well to know if the waters at Melville Castle be the same 
as the water in the neighbourhood of Manchester ; and if all water at 
a boiling heat would act in the same way on vegetables, so far as the 
colouring matter is concerned.
For before we can come to any con- 
673 
elusion as to the benefit to be derived from the use of hot water in the 
preparation of botanical specimens, it would be well to know what 
kind of water we are making use of; for if Mr. Evans or Mr. Sidebo- 
tham were to try the experiment with water highly charged with iron, 
and again, with the same kind of plants, make use of water which 
is highly charged with lime, perhaps they would not see the same ef- 
fect produced.
Mr. Evans tells us that plants, after being immersed 
in boiling water, will dry in nearly one half the time required to dry 
them in the usual way.
It is not stated if the specimens were sub- 
jected to the same kind of treatment after their immersion in boiling 
water, as when they are dried in the usual way.
I have tried this 
experiment, that is, I have gathered specimens at the same time, and 
at the same place, and put part of them in boiling water for a few se- 
conds, and then placed them in paper to dry.
I then placed some in 
the same state in which I gathered them in the same kind of paper, 
and changed them at the same time, and in short gave them the same 
kind of treatment throughout.
The result of this experiment was, 
that the plants which had been immersed in the boiling water, took 
three times the length of time to dry that those required which had 
not been in the boiling water.
The plant which I tried the experi- 
ment on was Galeobdolon luteum.
I now enclose three specimens of 
Asperula odorata : the one marked No. 1, I dried in the usual way â€” 
you will observe it is of a very dark colour : No. 2, I immersed in boil- 
ing water, and then dried it â€” that you will observe is much paler in 
colour than the plant is in a living state.
No. 3, I put in a sheet of 
paper in the state in which I gathered it, and then placed it on the top 
of a steam-engine boiler.
I let it remain there fifteen minutes, with- 
out changing the paper ; in this short time I found it to be quite dry : 
this, you will observe, has by far the best colour of the three.
I also 
enclose two specimens of Galeobdolon luteum : the one marked A, I 
immersed in boiling m ater for four seconds, and then dried it in the 
usual way ; the other, marked B, I dried as the Asperula No. 3, only 
it took more time â€” thirty instead of fifteen minutes : the colour of 
both is very well preserved, but you will see that the one marked B 
is much the better of the two.
A few days ago Dr. Harvey sent me 
a few specimens of Pinguicula grandiflora in a living state ; and as I had 
not seen good specimens of that plant, I resolved to try what 1 could 
do in drying them.
The first thing I did was to remove as much of 
the moisture as possible from the leaves.
I then took one of the spe- 
cimens, and placed it on a sheet of soft paper ; then I carefully spread 
each flower, putting on them a piece of common blotting paper.
I 
3m 
674 
next folded up the specimen and placed it in other sheets of paper : 
all the specimens T put up in the same manner.
I then exposed them 
to a gentle heat for thirty-six hours, and in that time I changed the 
papers three times ; they were then taken out, and found to be quite 
dry, with the colour of both leaves and flowers most beautifully pre- 
served.
Much might be said on the subject of drying botanical spe- 
cimens, but structure is what I always wish to see preserved ; and as 
for colour, I would say that white paper is decidedly the worst that 
can be used, either for drying plants or keeping them in after they are 
dried, owing to the extensive use of chlorine in the manufacture of it.
The enclosed specimen of Barbarea stricta was dried by artificial heat 
in four minutes, and its colour, you will observe, is not in the least in- 
jured.
But as I am now taking up too much of your valuable space, 
I will conclude by saying that Mr. Shepherd, of Mill House, near 
Halifax, has a method of preserving plants, perhaps known only to 
himself, which is decidedly the best I have ever seen, so far as colour 
is concerned.
The plan which he adopts is the fixing of their colours 
by some chemical process, either before or during the progress of dry- 
ing ; and I hope, before long, to prevail on him to give us the result 
of his experiments on this subject.
The following plants, dried by 
Mr. Shepherd in the year 1838, are now enclosed ; they will serve to 
show the merit of his plan in preserving the colours of plants : â€” ^Ana- 
gallis arvensis, Epilobium angustifolium, Listera ovata.
Orchis latifo- 
lia, Sagittaria Sagittifolia and Myosotis sylvatica.
â€” Samuel Gibson ; 
Hehden Bridge, June 12, 1843.
[Of Mr. Gibson's specimens, tliose dried quickly, by means of artificial heat, are 
by far the most beautiful as regards colour and general appearance ; the foliage of the 
Asperula No. 3 and of Barbarea stricta, has a perfectly natural hue, and their flowers 
appear to be not at all injured for examination.
The specimens which had been im- 
mersed in hot water, have the least natural appearance of the whole number, and their 
flowers seem lo be much injured.
The specimens preserved by Mr. Shepherd, which 
Mr. Gibson has had the kindness to forward, have the colours of their flowers most 
beautifully preserved, but, with the exception of Sagittaria Sagittifolia, they do not 
look quite natural.
This may perhaps arise, in some measure, from their being gum- 
med down to the papers on which they are placed, whereby the petals may have been 
injured.
The Sagittaria and Epilobium are decidedly the most beautiful of the whole, 
and Orchis latifolia the least so, its flowers being apparently much injured.
In a late 
number of the ' Annals and Magazine of Natural History,' is an article on drying 
plants by means of paper saturated with a solution of chloride of lime ; this being a 
deliquescent salt, the moisture of the plants is said to combine with it, and while the 
paper thus becomes wet, the plants themselves are dried in a short time.
After all, 
the only secrets in the art of preserving specimens of plants for the herbarium, are, to 
use plenty of paper, and to dry the specimens as quickly as possible, either by means 
of artificial heat or otherwise, with the aplication of only just so much pressure as will 
(575 
prevent their shrivelling.
The best specimens of Ophrys apifera we have ever seen, 
were placed in a hook, where they remained, in a warm room, unnoticed and forgotten, 
until chance again brought them to light, perfectly dry, and with the delicate pink hue 
of the perianth beautifully preserved.

Note on the Formation of a Herbarium.
I observed your 
correspondent's enquiry, regarding the formation of a herbarium, on 
the wrapper of the March Phytologist, and Mr. King's mode in reply 
to it in the May number (Phytol.
585).
The principal objection which is 
attached to the latter, in my opinion, is, that it does not present suffi- 
cient facilities for the progressive enlargement of the collection ; for 
if it is not completed before the arrangement is commenced, blank pa- 
ges of the " guard book " must be left in different places for such ad- 
ditions; and these cannot be calculated with any degree of certainty, 
provided the collector aims at anything like an extensive herbarium, 
besides having an unfinished appearance, and so many blank leaves 
being very inconvenient for reference.
Mr. K.'s method is an excel- 
lent one when arranging a herbarium to which no additions are to be 
made, as in local herbaria, &c.
The plan which I have adopted in 
arranging a rather extensive collection is the following.
In all the 
best herbaria the specimens are glned to the paper ; that this is far 
preferable to securing them by slips or threads, as practised by some, 
does not, I think, admit of a doubt ; besides making the specimens 
more easy of reference, by facilitating their turning over, it is more 
expeditiously accomplished, and the constant breaking up of the 
slips is obviated ; besides, there are many plants which cannot be 
well attached by that means, such as the leaves of Atropa Belladonna, 
the very compound ones of many Umbelliferae, &c., where, if the 
slips are applied in sufficient number to fasten the specimen fairly to 
the paper, both the beauty and character of it are greatly diminished j 
then again the fruit of grasses, Carices, Compositae, the petals of ro- 
ses, and other species bearing fugacious flowers, are almost sure to 
be eventually lost.
Under all these circumstances, I think it will be 
evident that fastening them in this manner is much superior to the 
other method â€” by slips of paper : thin ylue should always be used ; 
never gum or paste, as these are apt to turn mouldy, and also, after a 
time, to give way ; it should be carefully ajjplied with a pretty large 
and soft brush, and immediately committed to the press and paper 
used for drying plants, to remain there until thoroughly dry : the 
paper T use is large printing paper, thick and strong, about seventeen 
by nine and a half inches : I have some of the half sheets cut in two, 
and others in four ; the folio size being intended for such plants as 
the Rumices, most ferns, grasses, Carices, &c.
; the quarto for those 
676 
of the size of Sedum Telephium, GeraniumSj &c.
; and the octavo 
for all such small species as the Arenarias, Saxifrages and Sedums : 
in this way only one specimen is put upon each piece of paper.
I 
have then a sheet of coarse stiflf cartridge paper for each species, about 
a fourth of an inch larger every way than the other sheets : within 
this is laid the specimen or specimens glued to the other paper, with 
the station, date, or any other particulars, written on the latter ; then 
on the lower left hand comer of the sheet I write the name of the spe- 
cies, and include all belonging to the same genus in another rather 
larger sheet, on which are written the name of the genus, class, order &c.
The genera may be arranged according to the system adopted by the 
collector, and made up in tolerably small bundles, according to Mr.
King's plan, but not hound at the back, but secured instead by strings, 
or straps and buckles, at each side : this mode of arranging a herba- 
rium I find to be the most convenient for reference and enlargement, 
as well as the most economical, and the collection admits of being 
laid much smoother and flatter than if the leaves of paper were all 
of one size.
It is desirable sometimes to have specimens loose for 
examination ; indeed this is almost the only recommendation urged 
in favour of having them only partially fastened to the paper : in all 
doubtful or interesting plants it is very necessary to have at least the 
most essential parts loose ; and a piece of paper, folded somewhat like 
a letter-envelope, and fastened by a wafer or a little gum to any part 
of the inside of the species-sheet , should always contain the flowers 
and fruit of the Umbelliferse, Carices, Cruciferae, &c.
&c.

Note on drying Plants for the JHerbarium.
As I am on the 
subject of herbaria, allow me a few words on the drying of plants ; 
however simple the operation, it is one by no means well understood.
I shall mention the way which in my hands seems to take up least 
time and trouble, and to dry plants more perfectly than any other I 
have made trial of.
It appears to me that one cause of our seeing so 
many imperfectly and clumsily dried specimens, is from botanists not 
using enough paper between the layers of specimens, and fi'om not 
applying sufficient pressure at first.
I never employ less than twelve 
sheets of thick absorbent paper for any plants, twenty-four for strong 
or succulent species, and a board between every layer or two of spe- 
cimens ; the weight at first ought generally to be not less than two 
cwt.
This pressure very speedily expels the moisture from the plant, 
without giving it time to shrivel up or change colour : the specimens 
Jie in this way one, or perhaps two, days, and are then taken out and 
677 
all the paper changed, and half the weight or less applied for two or 
three days : no more changing is necessary, and in a week at most 
from the time of gathering the plants will be found to be perfectly 
dry.
If any one would import the thick coarse paper used by Ger- 
man botanists for drying plants, and which we here never see unless 
coming with plants from that country, it would be conferring a great 
boon on British botanists, for the great superiority of the German 
specimens is evidently greatly owing to the superior paper for drying 
which they possess.
I made a trial of this paper among some experi- 
ments instituted on the drying of plants last summer, and I found they 
dried in half the time required for those preserved with the common 
kind of paper.
In conclusion, I would beg to caution inexperienced 
botanists against using hot water in the preparation of Sedums, Agra- 
phis, and other siicculent plants, or indeed for any specimens what- 
ever, for, however well they may look, they are entirely useless as 
specimens, for the hot water utterly spoils the character of the plant, 
it being impossible to dissect and analyse them, and, unless pasting 
plants on the walls of rooms comes into fashion, I am quite at a loss 
to conceive the use of it : by proper care and attention to having the 
plants quite dry before committing them to press, specimens may be 
preserved frilly as beautifully, and infinitely more usefully than by the 
hot-water cure.

Note on Cerastium latifoUum. I am sorry to find that Mr.
Watson (Phytoh 586) does not agree with my views of the Ce- 
rastium described by me, (Id. 495), I am also sorry to find Mr. W.
confining his remarks to the least important point characterized, viz.
the form of the leaves, and the sum of the proof seems to be brought 
from a garden specimen : all the characters derived from the length 
of the peduncles, the bractese, sepals, capsule, pubescence, &c., are 
dismissed without comment ; Mr. W.
merely saying " that the other 
characters appear as little constant as those taken from the leaves." 
Now having examined such a multitude of specimens from different 
stations, collected at different times, I feel convinced I am correct in 
saying that the characters I have given are really constant : they are 
such as are employed, without a doubt, in distinguishing other species 
of Cerastium, and better will rarely be got among the Caryophyllese.
The main point urged by Mr. W.
is, that cultivated specimens of the 
Scotch " C.
alpinum and C.
latifolium bear leaves equally short, broad 
and obtuse," as those I have figured belonging to my C.
latifolium.
Now every botanist knows that plants removed from their native 
juountains to a garden, can never be depended on for retaining their 
678 
characteristics.
1 have seen in the Edinburgh Botanic Garden, and 
elsewhere, plants of Cerastium alpinum raised from roots from Clova, 
in which the leaves were linear-lanceolate, and hardly to be distin- 
guished from those of some narrow varieties of C.
triviale or atro- 
virens ; yet no one would for a moment dream of considering this a 
normal form.
I cannot help thinking that Mr. Watson is misled, 
partly by the garden plants he alludes to, and partly by seeing some 
variations in the form of the leaves of the Scotch plants : thus he 
says that in "a specimen of C.
latifolium (of British authors), ga- 
thered on Ben Lawers, there are lanceolate-ovate or almost orbicular 
leaves from the same root." I have seen considerable difference in 
the breadth of leaves of C.
alpinum, but the nearest approximation 
to " orbicular " I have ever met with was somewhat broadly-ovate, 
and the character "ovate or ovato -lanceolate" includes all the vari- 
eties I have seen in wild specimens.
My C.
latifolium has come up 
in the old station, within a few hundred yards of my residence, by 
thousands, this year ; and in examining numerous individuals some 
days ago, for the purpose of making a drawing and description of it 
for the ' Supplement to English Botany,' I am more than ever struck 
with the great difference in colour, habit, &c., as well as more important 
points and differences.
I shall be happy to supply any of your cor- 
respondents with specimens of this interesting plant.

Unusual habitat of Limosella aquatica.
In the few localities 
in which I had gathered the Limosella previously to the present 
month, the plant was growing either wholly in water, or on the sides 
of pools and ditches which had recently been under water.
Yester- 
day I found about a dozen specimens of this plant, just coming into 
flower, on the surface of my kitchen garden, intermingled with young 
plants of Veronica Buxbaumii ; the seeds of the latter having been 
sown by myself, on the same spot, in the month of May, at which 
time no plants of the Limosella were observed, nor had I ever before 
seen this species in my garden.
The ground has been used as a 
kitchen garden for the last eight years, and was several years in cul- 
tivation as arable land before its conversion into a garden.
It was 
originally marshy, but was drained and enclosed many years ago, and 
is now so little disposed to retain its former character, that my gar- 
dener usually finds it necessary to water his crops copiously in spring 
and early summer.
In the present year, however, abundant and al- 
most daily rains through a part of May and June, kept the ground 
more humid than was desired ; and apparently the seeds of the Li- 
mosella had germinated during those weeks of wet weather.
How 
679 
these seeds reached the spot on which the plants were found I am 
quite unable to say, but would deem it not improbable that tliey had 
been carried to the garden in water from a neighbouring pond, in 
which I have never seen the Limosella, but to which its seeds may 
have been borne by a flood- stream two years ago, from a more distant 
pond, within which the plant has been repeatedly observed.
The 
alternative conjecture, that the seeds had remained dormant in the 
soil of the garden foi- twenty or thirty years, seems less likely to be 
the true explanation.
But by whatever way the seeds contrived to 
be on the spot in question, the fact of the Lim6sella being found as 
a weed on cultivated ground is worthy of record, as a marked instance 
of change from the ordinary habitat of an " aquatic " plant.

Note on Symphytum asperrimum.
One fine evening last month 
during a stroll along the banks of the river Tame, in Cheshire, I fell 
in with a quantity of Symphytum asperrimum, apparently wild, grow- 
ing in a meadow.
There is no garden in the vicinity, from which it 
could have escaped, indeed I have never seen it cultivated in the gar- 
dens about here, though I am aware it is occasionally to be met with.
Perhaps some of your correspondents may know something about the 
plant, and on whose authority it was placed in the Supplement to 
Francis's Catalogue.

New habitat for Lepidimn Draha.
This plant is of such rare 
occurrence, and so local, as very seldom to be brought within the reach 
of the collecting botanist ; indeed, unless recent research has multi- 
plied localities, I know but of two spots where the plant may be cer- 
tainly found in Britain.
Hence I was much pleased at discovering a 
new colony of the Lepidium Draba, a few weeks since, and the an- 
nouncement may perhaps gratify other botanists.
What is most re- 
markable in the matter is, that I feel certain the plant was never there 
until the present season, as I have doubtless passed the spot it now 
occupies almost a thousand and one times within the last few years, 
although this season thirty or forty plants have suddenly sprung up 
in one particular place.
I am almost afraid to indicate the exact 
locality, lest a file of men from the Worcestershire Natural-History 
Society should reduce the whole colony to mummies ; but suffice it to 
say that it grows on the glacis of the embankment of the new road 
made about seven years since, to the iron bridge over the Teme at 
Powick, and not near any habitation or ploughed field.
It also grows 
mixed up with the quick of the hedge planted since the road was 
formed, in company with a rank growth of Malva sylvestris, Sisym- 
680 
brium officinale, &c., and therefore I think the agency of Nature only 
has located the plant there, however that may have been exercised.
I am the more induced to mention this, as I did not discover this Le- 
pidium in time to include it in my Malvern Plants,* which 1 should 
otherwise have done, since its habitat is on the western side of the 
Teme, within a little more than five miles of Great Malvern.
As I 
have often poured forth maledictions on road-surveyors for eradicat- 
ing plants, it is but fair to set down this occurrence as per Contra, Cr.
in their favour ; and I dare say the embankments of railways will in 
time produce some good things.
I beg leave to say that I have in 
fairness left between twenty and thirty plants of the Lepidium, if not 
more, to perfect their seeds, so that if the locality should become 
unproductive in future, it will not be my fault.

[The parallel case of Lavatera Olbia springing up on the embankment of a new 
road in Epping Forest, has been recorded by Mr. H.
Doubleday, (Phytol.

is, however, this difference, that we are not aware of any other British station for the 
Lavatera being on record, while Lepidium Draba has previously occurred in Glamor- 
ganshire (Phytol.

Enquiry respecting Equisetum arvense and E.
Drummondii.
Perhaps you will allow me, through the medium of your periodical, to 
enquire of your readers whether Equisetum arvense or E.
Drummon- 
dii be the more glaucous of the two ; as I never had the pleasure of 
seeing E.
Drummondii in a living state.
My reason for making this 
enquiry is, that Sir W.
J. Hooker tells us (in ' British Flora,' 1st and 
5th editions) that Drummondii " is greener and less glaucous " [than 
at'vense].
Francis, speaking of E.
Drummondii, says, "this plant 
differs from Equisetum arvense in its more glaucous, greener colour." 
I hope to be excused for making this enquiry, for surely, such books 
as those I have quoted were written for the purpose of being under- 
stood.
I think it can be no printer's error in the ' British Flora,' or 
it would have been corrected before it had got through five editions,

While on the subject of 
enquiries, perhaps I might be allowed to ask, what is to be under-

As this is a new term among 
the Carices, I hope to be excused for making the enquiry.

have taken this for an error of the press, had I not found the same

Notes on Epipactis latifolia, Sfc. I am sorry that I omitted, 
in the last Phytologist, to call the attention of botanists to Epipactis 
latifolia, and its closely allied species, or varieties, or whatever they 
may be ; but it is not now too late to institute an enquiry, and I ear- 
nestly hope that all botanists who have an opportunity of studying 
the plants in a living state, will avail themselves of that opportunity, 
and favour the public with the result of their investigations.
Those 
who have seen an extensive series of specimens of the plant known as 
Epipactis latifolia, are well aware of the great variety of form and 
habit which it assumes, even without including the forms of the less 
variable but still inconstant E.
purpurata : but if these are combined 
with the plant usually known as E.
latifolia and its acknowledged va- 
rieties, the transition from the one extreme to the other becomes more 
gradual, and the difficulty of distinguishing between the intermediate 
forms is consequently greatly increased.
Ray seems to have doubted if 
there might not be more than one species confounded under his Hel- 
leborine latifolia montana, since he remarks that he has observed this 
plant to bear green flowers, but that Dr. Plot and the Oxford botanists 
find one, the flowers of which are of a still deeper purple than those of 
Helleborine flore atro-rubente (Smith's Epipactis latifolia fl.), adding, 
*' whence it is either a striking variety, differing in the colour of the 
flower, or the two plants are distinct species." Smith also says that 
*'the reputed varieties of E, latifolia perhaps require more scientific 
examination than they have hitherto received." In Leighton's ' Flo- 
ra of Shropshire,' under Epipactis latifolia, Mr. Babington has given 
the characters of two plants : â€” 1.
E. latifolia, All. and Eng. Bot.
269, 
the nonnal E.
latifolia, with very broad leaves, and green flowers with 
a purple lip ; and, 2.
E. viridiflora, Reich.., with only the lowest leaves 
broad, and the flowers "green, tinged with purple." The latter plant 
is referred by Fries, as a variety, to his E.
media ; with the remark that if 
attention be paid only to the colour of the flowers, it must necessarily 
be confounded with E.
latifolia, from which it may always be known 
by being more slender in all its parts ; the leaves are also gradually 
nanowed to the apex, not abruptly acuminate, as in E.
latifolia.
Mr.
Babington has studied the plants referrible to E.
latifolia, with great 
care, but without being able to satisfy himself as to their identity or 
distinctness.
In his * Manual,' under E.
latifolia, All.,\iG observes that 
3n 
682 
" there are four very different plants included under this species, one 
or more of which is probably distinct ; " and gives the foUovt^ing cha- 
racters : â€” 
" a.

Of the above four forms, a.
appears to be the most common ; of this 
I possess specimens from Reigate Hill, Surrey ; East Harden, Sus- 
sex; and from near Geneva; and believe the same form to occur ve- 
ry frequently in some parts of Epping Forest and on the weald clay of 
Sussex.
I have a single specimen of what Mr. Babington considers 
to be the second form, b.
from near Chipstead, Siu-rey.
The third, c.
is not unfrequent in the woods on the chalk hills of Surrey ; I possess 
it from near Reigate, and have seen it in the copses below Crawley, 
Sussex ; these are identical with Mr. Forbes's Woburn plants, as fi- 
gured in Eng. Bot.
Suppl., although I have some doubt of their being 
the same as Sir J.
E. Smith's specimen, described as his E.
pin-pu- 
rata.
Of d.
I know nothing, except from a specimen from Giggles- 
683 
wick, near Settle, kindly presented by Mr. Babington, and another 
from Gordale, near Settle, labelled " Epipactis latifolia, var.
^." It 
may here be remarked that the plants must be studied in a recent state.
Mr. Babington observes, " The points that require attention in these 
plants are the shape of the terminal lobe of the lip, with the character 
of its upper surface, â€” shape of the petals and sepals, and the charac- 
ter and form of the sheaths on the stem ; " these points cannot be 
properly investigated in dried specimens.

Note on the Gravesend locality of PcBonia corallina.
We arc 
so accustomed to consider that Master Gerarde was actuated by en- 
tire good faith in making known his discoveries, that it is perhaps hardly 
fair to publish anything in disparagement of his fair fame ; wherefore 
in mentioning the following naughty trick, with the doing of which he 
is charged by his emaculator, Johnson, it is more for the purpose of 
soliciting information as to the present state of the Gravesend locality 
of his " Male Peionie," than for any other purpose : at all events the 
passages are amusing.
Gerarde says â€” " The Male Peionie groweth 
wild vpon a conny beiTy in Betsome, being in the parish of Southfleet 
in Kent, two miles from Grauesend, and in the ground sometimes be- 
longing to a farmer there called lohn Bradley^ To this Johnson 
adds, â€” " X I haue beene told that our author himselfe planted that 
Peionie there, and afterwards seemed to finde it there by accident ; 
and I doe beleeue it was so, because none before or since haue euer 
scene or hard of it growing wilde in any part of this kingdome.

Mr. MurcotVs Plan for drying Plants.
The following is the 
mode of drying plants by means of a deliquescent salt, before alluded 
to, (Phytol.
674).
" The plants to be dried are placed between sheets of paper containing chloride of 
calcium, contact with the salt being prevented by an intervening cushion on one side, 
and a layer of fine calico on the other.
Two thin boards support the apparatus, and 
are held together by a couple of buckled tapes ; the whole is enveloped in oil cloth to 
exclude atmospheric moisture.
The packet need not be opened till the plants are dry 
enough to be removed, or fresh plants require to be introduced.
The time and trou- 
ble of frequently removing drying plants into fresh papers, as in the ordinary method, 
are both saved ; for though the packet be full of plants, it need not be opened even for 
several months.
Plants in general dry much faster than in blotting paper, and their 
colours are much more frequently preserved : the use of the pad prevents injury to the 
soft parts of plants, and hinders their corollas from shrivelling up in drying, without 
applying so much pressure as would unfit any part for subsequent examination.
" Brown paper, so thick as to prevent the transmission of light, with a smooth 
surface, and not much sized, is better fitted to hold the salt than blotting-paper, which 
084 
it greatly siiri)asscs in durability and tenacity in a damp state.
The paper is impreg- 
nated with the salt by dipping it (a sheet at a time) in a solution formed by dissolving 
13i oz.
of the crystallized chloride of calcium in one (imperial) pint of water.
Where 
the chloride is expensive, or difficult to be procured, it may be prepared by saturating 
hydrochloric acid with fragments of marble, or even with common chalk : the acid 
may be of commercial strength or slightly diluted with water ; but the vessel contain- 
ing it should be capable of holding seveml times the quantity, on account of ebulli- 
tion.
After saturation the liquid should be filtered, and diluted with water till its 
specific gravity falls to 1"188 ; this may be ascertained most readily by a glass bead of 
that number.
The sheets as they are dipped (a large tea-ti'ay is very convenient to 
hold the liquid) should be carefully laid one upon another, and at length so much li- 
quid pressed out that they will not drip when held before a fire to dry.
I diy them 
before a fire, but a friend suggests that much time and trouble would be saved by dry- 
ing them in a baker's oven.
A solution of this strength will communicate as much of 
the salt as the paper can retain without showing an exudation on its surface when ap- 
plied to use and its complement of moisture absorbed, while the excessive brittleness 
occasioned, if the liquid be much more concentrated, soon splits the back of every 
sheet ; and the drops of liquid that appear as the paper grows very damp might deter 
a beginner from following the method.
â€¢ 
"In applying the paper to use, I place about three sheets between every lot of 
plants : the plants do not touch the paper, but lie on a cushion of cotton wool, and 
are covered with a piece of ' glazed lining ' calico, or similar material ; or they are 
placed between two pieces of flannel ; of course the same surface of the cotton or 
flannel should always be applied to the paper, to prevent communication of the salt 
to the plants.
I have prepared some sheets of paper on one side only, but have not 
yet given them a trial.
The pads do not much afiiect the quick drying, but they pre- 
serve soft parts from injury, and render a very slight pressure sufiicient.
When I wish 
to preserve the corolla of a plant in the best possible manner, I place iinder and above 
it a little finely opened cotton wool.
When very watery plants are to be dried, such 
as Hotionia palustris, I would place an extra cushion of cotton wool over them.
Plants seem to dry best at a temperature of about 100" Fah. When the papers have 
taken up as much moisture as they can absorb, they may be re-dried before a fire, if 
the method suggested by a friend (drying at a baker's oven) should not be accessible.
Orchidaccw and Scroplmlariacece are bad driers, even with the aid of chloride of cal- 
cium ; but I find that Listera ovata, and probably some others, may have their colour 
perfectly preserved if immersed for a few seconds in a nearly boiling but very weak 
solution of carbonate of soda, then wiped and placed between the papers.
This re- 
mark may perhaps induce some one with more leisure than myself to experiment on 
various ways of drying plants of these natural orders.
" The disadvantages of the method are, in my opinion, inconsiderable when com- 
pared with the saving of time and trouble, and the much better preservation of the 
specimens.
Brown paper is not expensive.
Crystals of chloride of cdcium may be 
bought of the Liverpool Apothecaries' Company, and perhaps elsewhere, at od.
per ib., 
or if prepared at home, the expense will be about the same.
The cotton-wool cush- 
ions cost Id. or Isd. each ; flannel is more durable, but more expensive.
The cushions 
render the apparatus bulky, but this is only an inconvenience iu travelling, and then 
the far greater inconvenience of drying papers^ at inns in the summer mouths is ex- 
perienced about once in three weeks instead of once a day, or every other day.
Such 
685 
at least is the result of my experience ; I have employed the salt in the manner de- 
scribed for two years and part of a third, for I commenced with it in 1840.
The 
gi-eat dryness and consequent brittleness of the plants unfit them for the immediate 
examination of concealed parts, but exposure to a moist air for a short time would di- 
minish their fragility in a sufficient degree.'' â€” Ann. and Mag. Nat.

taining the herbarium, in order that the collection may be preserved

Mr. E.
Queketfs Observations ofi the Ergot of Grasses.
We 
gave the title of tliis paper in our report of the Proceedings of the Lin- 
nean Society, (Phytol.
559) ; the following is an extract from the re- 
cently published number of the Society's ' Proceedings.' 
" In March, 1840, twelve healthy grains of rye, of wheat and of barley, were 
placed in a shallow glass vessel containing a sufficient quantity of distilled water to 
moisten them, and covered with a glass shade.
When germination commenced, an 
ergot of wheat of the preceding year was immersed in the water, the sporidia on its 
surface were detached, and the ergot itself was then removed.
The same experiment 
was performed with sporidia obtained from an ergot of Elymus sahulosus.
Several 
days afterwards, when the leaves had attained a length of three or four inches, the 
young plants were conveyed into the country and planted side by side in a garden.
At the period of harvest there remained alive only four plants of the rye (one of which 
had been infected from the ergot of Elymus, and the remaining three from that of 
wheat), three of the barley, and four of the wheat.
Of the rye scarcely a single ear 
produced healthy grains, the paleos being generally quite empty ; but nine of the cars 
contained ergots, some furnishing only a single specimen, and others as many as six.
The ears of the barley were filled with healthy grains, and only one apparently diseased 
grain was detected ; while in the wheat the ears were full and without disease.
" As in these experiments no grains from the same sample were sown which had 
not been subjected to the influence of the sporidia of the fungus, Mr. Quekett made 
in the following autumn another experiment with the view of supplying this defi- 
ciency.
Twelve grains of rye, of wheat and of barley, were again made to germinate 
under similar circumstances to the last, and the sporidia obtained from the surface of 
one of the ergots of rye produced in the first experiment were difl"used in the water in 
which they grew.
These were planted in October on the same estate, but not within 
half a mile of the former spot ; and twelve healthy grains of each kind, which had 
been carefully kept apart from the others, were planted in the same locality.
Very few 
of the plants arrived at maturity, and in August last there remained of the infected 
plants only two of rye, two of wheat, and one of barley ; and of the uninfected plants 
one of each kind.
On each of the plants of rye which had been subjected to the in- 
fluence of the sporidia an ergot was discovered, and the ears, as before, were almost 
entirely devoid of healthy grains ; while the plants of wheat and barley subjected to 
the same influence produced perfect ears and healthy grains.
The three plants of rye, 
wheat and barley, planted at the same time, without exposure to the sporidia of the 
fungus, presented no unhealthy appearance.
" Mr. Quekett argues that all the grains of rye subjected during germination to 
the influence of the sporidia of the fungus, in both sets of experiments, having pro- 
686 
duced plants infected with ergot, while the plants derived from grains not so subjected 
escaped disease, a convincing proof is aflforded that their infection could not have been 
the effect of chance, but must have resulted from the artificial introduction of the 
sporidia ; and that the infection of the rye only, while the wheat and barley escaped, 
is to be attributed to the greater susceptibility of the rye to infection, as proved by 
the much greater frequency of the production of ergots in that species of grain." â€” Eel

BOTANICAL SOCIETY OF EDINBURGH.
This Society held its last meeting for the season, on Thursday, July 13, at the Bo- 
tanic Garden : the President, Dr. Neill, in the chair.
After a delightful walk through the gardens, during which Prof.
Graham pointed 
out the objects most worthy of notice, the meeting assembled in the class-room for bu- 
siness.
Donations to the library were presented from Edwin Lees, Esq., Worcester, 
and Professor Forbes, of London : and several valuable parcels of British and foreign 
plants were announced.
The papers read, which were mostly of a technical character, were : â€” 
1. On the genera Gomphonema and Meridion.
By Mr. John Ralfs, Penzance.
2. On four new species of British Jungermanniae.
By Thomas Taylor, M.D., 
Dunkerron.
3. On a species of Fungus found imbedded in peat, near Stirling.
Communicated 
by Mr. Peter Mackenzie, West Plean.
The attention of botanists has recently been directed to the importance of studying 
the vegetable remains imbedded in peat-mosses, as calculated to throw light on the 
early vegetation of the country, and the successive changes it has undergone.
For 
this object, communications like that from INIr. Mackenzie are much to be desired.
A letter was also read from Dr. Joseph Dickson, St. Helier's, Jersey, mentioning 
some interesting additions to the Flora of that island, which he had lately discovered ; 
and remarking, that he felt convinced it contains many other species still unknown to 
botanists.

Read, 'Observations on Dicranum Dillenii, Taylor, MS.,' by Dr. Thomas Taylor.
As Dillenius is the first author who directed the attention of botanists, seventy-five 
years ago, by a separate figure, to the present moss, his name has been ascribed to it ; 
and yet it is evident that Dillenius, as well as all subsequent muscologists, have con- 
founded it with Dicranum scoparium, Linn.
Nor is this without excuse, when we 
consider the strong resemblance in the habit of both, their being nearly equal in size, 
their very general occurrence in Europe, as well as the northern parts of America, and 
particularly their frequently growing together in the same woods, or on the sarne banks, 
in more open and mountainous situations.
Besides, the present plant varies consider- 
ably in appearance, so that the one state, well figured in ' English Botany,' t.
354, as 
Dicranum scoparium, would scarcely be supposed to belong to the same species as 
another state, equally well represented by Schwaegrichen in his Supplement, t.
42, under 
the same name.
It is the wide limits within which its aspect changes that probably 
weighed with the editors of ' Muscologia Britannica,' to give both species, well-repre- 
sented, as varieties only of Dicranum scoparium.
Submitted however to a rigid scrutiny, Dr. T.
apprehended that the following dis- 
tinctive marks would be found to be constant, and if so, they would appear to be suf- 
ficiently numerous and sufficiently grave to establish the present species.
1. Dicranum Dillenii, though frequently difi'ering in size, is usually the smaller moss.
2. Its leaves are not constantly, and but slightly, turned to one side, while in Di- 
cranum scoparium they are more loosely set, and uniformly falcato-secund.
3. In the present species the pedicels are solitary, in the other aggregated within 
the same perichEetium.
4. In the former the pedicels are opaque, even immediately below the capsule, at 
the period of full maturity ; they are also reddish below and brownish above : while in 
the latter, even when full grown, they are somewhat pellucid, and of a pale straw 
colour.
5. In the former, the capsule is erect below and slightly curved above, is nearly 
equal, has no projecting struma, yet with an apophysis, pale brown when ripe : in the 
latter, the capsule is curved, even long before the fall of the calyptra, is very unequal, 
has a projecting struma, and is green when just ripe.
6. In the former, the operculum is gradually acuminated, and falls after the ca- 
lyptra ; while in the latter, the operculum, with a broad base, is suddenly acuminated, 
and usually falls in and with the calyptra.
7. In Dicranum Dillenii the teeth of the peristome are narrower and more opaque.
8. The stem is often interruptedly leafy.
9. The leaves are shorter, and have their points less curved.
10.
The parts of fructification are larger in proportion to the size of the plant.
In the Museum of the Society occurs a Dicranum from Newfoundland, from the 
late Mr. Lambert's collection, which, being barren, and consequently not admitting of 
a comparison of the parts of fructification, Dr. T.
would not venture to separate from 
Dicranum Dillenii ; and yet its densely aggregated and shorter stems, its shining lus- 
tre, and its less patent leaves, would demand the greatest attention, and would indi- 
cate it as at least a very remarkable variety ; but when it is considered that its leaves 
are shorter, wider in the lower half, with their points more canaliculate, and the nerve 
serrated at the back, it must be confessed that its claims for separation are very strong.

WATER EQUISETUM.
Equisetum FLUViATiLE, Linneus.
Eqiiisetum limosum^ Smith, Hooker, Babington.
3o 
690 
This species is by far too generally distributed to allow of my giving 
a list of habitats : it occurs very commonly in ponds and ditches, 
and occasionally in running streams, the roots and a portion of the 
stem being immersed in water.
Concerning the nomenclature of this plant Sir J.
E. Smith has led 
us into an error, which, in a late number of ' The Phytologist,' I took 
some trouble to point out ; and although I believe no one who has 
investigated the subject entertains the slightest doubt as to the fact 
that the species now figured on the preceding page is the E.
fluviatile 
of Linneus, yet several eminent botanists prefer adopting Sir J.
E. 
Smith's nomenclature to that of Linneus, on the ground that the for- 
mer is now established by usage.
The medicinal properties of this plant have been so variously stated 
that they appear to contradict each other.
With regard to its econo- 
mical uses Linneus gives us, in his ' Flora Suecica,' a very definite 
statement that in Sweden it is cut up as food for cattle, in order that 
the cows may give more milk ; * and in his ' Lachesis Lapponica ' 
he abserves that " the rein-deer feed with avidity on the great water 
horse-tail {Equisetum Jlumatile), which the Laplanders call Aske, 
though it was in a dry state, and though they will not eat common 
hay.
How unaccountably negligent" he continues, "are the Lap- 
landers not to collect in the course of summer a stock of this plant, 
and of the rein-deer moss [Lichen rangiferinus)^ for winter fodder !
They would then have some provision for the herd when the country 
is covered with an impenetrable crust of frozen snow, and not hazard 
the loss of all they are worth in the world."t There seems to be 
very contradictory evidence even within the range of our more imme- 
diate observation, as to its being eaten by horses, cows and sheep.
I have seen it growing luxuriantly in ponds in Herefordshire, in situ- 
tions accessible to cattle, but I never could perceive that a stem had 
been eaten ; but more recently, in the ditches which intersect the rich

pasture land in the Isle of Dogs, I observed that nearly every stem 
within reach from the bank had been cropped at a nearly uniform 
height : horses, horned cattle and sheep, are constantly feeding in 
these meadows.
The roots of the water Equisetum are numerous, black, fibrous and 
sinuous : they spring from the bases of the submerged sheaths in a 
manner precisely similar to that of the branches, and those which ori- 
ginate near the surface of the water not unfrequently ascend for a 
time in the same way.
The rhizoma is creeping, and extends hori- 
zontally in every dii*ection, forming a matted mass in the mud of 
ponds and ditches where the plant occurs : it is of a brown colour, 
with jet black sheaths, which are rather more approximate than in 
ascending stems, but in other respects scarcely different.
In winter, 
when the exposed portion of the stem of the preceding year is dead, 
the remaining portion becomes prostrate on the mud, still however 
retaining some of those lower branches which may be seen in the sum- 
mer in a state of incipient development : these, together with others 
in a still younger state, fonn the ascending stems of the ensuing year.
The engraving at page 689 represents a moderately sized stem of 
the water Equisetum, of its natural size and proportions : a much 
larger might have been selected, but its representation would have 
been more difficult.
The stem is perfectly erect, and about twenty- 
five inches in height, of which seventeen inches were above water and 
the remainder submerged.
The submerged portion is smooth, the 
apical portion slightly striated (the striae are much more distinct in 
immature and barren stems) ; its average diameter is a quarter of an 
inch : it is divided by transverse septa into thirty compartments, thir- 
teen of which were above, and the remainder below the surface of the 
water : the internodes above water vary from three quarters of an inch 
to an inch and three quarters in length ; those submerged are very ob- 
viously shorter.
The sheaths are about a quarter of an inch in length ; 
they are green, concolorous with the stem, and of nearly equal diame- 
ter, so that they clasp it very tightly : the teeth are sixteen to twenty 
in number, sharp-pointed, always distinctly separated, black or dark 
brown, and not unfrequently furnished with a very slender white mem- 
branous edge.
There are six whorls of ascending branches : these 
rise from the base of the sheaths from the second to the seventh in- 
ternode inclusive.
The branches in each whorl vary from five to 
seventeen in number : they are divided into joints, varying from five 
to ten in number, and have from five to eight striae with correspond- 
ing ridges, which terminate in sheaths having the same number of 
3o2 
092 
brown-tipped teetli : the internodes of these branches are extremely 
variable in length, the first and last being the shortest : the branches 
also vary greatly in length.
The catkin is short, ovate, gibbous and terminal ; and the stalk on 
which it stands is short, scarcely exceeding in length the sheath which 
encloses it.
I can discover no apiculus, the extreme summit being 
composed of scales similar to the rest : these are generally more than 
a hundred in number ; exteriorly they are quite black, but as they 
separate about Midsummer, by the ripening of the catkin, a common 
recej)tacle of ivory whiteness is disclosed.
This species is extremely subject to variation, so much so that the 
preceding description will only suffice to give a general idea of a fer- 
tile stem.
Some are entirely unbranched, others sparingly branched, 
and others again more numerously branched : the site of the branches 
also varies, commencing variously at the second, third, fourth, fifth, 
.sixth or seventh sheath, and forming two, three, four, five, six, seven 
or eight whorls.
When quite unbranched, whether fertile or barren, 
I have no doubt that it is the 'Equisetum nudum laevius nostras' of 
E,ay,* the habitat, figm-e, &c., closely corresponding ; this form is also 
the E.
limosum of Linneus, who, in his 'Systema Vegetabilium,' 
quotes E-ay's description and figure ; but it should also be observed 
that subsequently, in his ' Flora Lapponica,' he omits all notice what- 
ever of this unbranched form, evidently not considering it worthy of 
a place even as a variety.
The fertile stem occasionally becomes pro- 
liferous, as in the preceding species, but much more rarely.
Mr.
Luxford possesses a specimen of this kind, found in a mill-pool, by 
the Bristol-road, Birmingham ; and in Sir J.
E. Smith's herbarium is 
a Swiss specimen from Mr. Davall, as recorded in the ' English 
nora,'t where the author remarks that he has seen no such variety in 
England.
The baiTen stem is much longer than the fertile, and varies in an 
infinity of ways : among a few which I have lately gathered in the 
ditches of the Isle of Dogs, where this plant abounds, but can scarcely 
be said to flourish, 1 select the following as instances of variation.
A â€” is forty-three inches in length, and has thirty-seven joints, with- 
out a single branch.
B â€” is forty-five inches in length, and has forty joints: from the 
first to the nineteenth inclusive these are branchless, the twentieth has 
one branch, the twenty-first two branches, the twenty-second two, and 
the twenty-third to the fortieth inclusive one branch each.

693 
C â€” is forty-five inches in length, and has forty joints ; these, from 
the first to the fifteenth inchisive, are branchless, the sixteenth has one 
branch, the seventeenth has two branches, the eighteenth has thirteen, 
the nineteenth eleven, the twentieth nine, the twenty-first nine, the 
twenty-second ten, the twenty-third ten, the twenty-fourth seven, the 
twenty-fifth eight, the twenty-sixth two, the twenty-seventh two, the 
twenty-eighth two, the twenty-ninth one, the thirtieth three, the thir- 
ty-first none, the thirty-second two, the thirty-third none, the thirty- 
fourth one, the thirty-fifth and thirty-sixth none, the thirty-seventh 
two, the thirty-eighth two, and the thirty-ninth and fortieth none.
D â€” is forty inches in length, and has thirty joints : from the first to 
the sixteenth inclusive, and also the eighteenth, twenty-fourth, twenty- 
seventh, twenty-ninth, thirty-first, thirty-third, thirty-fifth, thirty-sixth 
and thirty-eighth are branchless ; the seventeenth, nineteenth, twenty- 
first, twenty-third, twenty-fifth, twenty-sixth, twenty-eighth, thirtieth, 
thirty-second, thirty-fourth and thirty-seventh, have one branch each, 
the twentieth has two branches, and the twenty-second three branches.
It should also be observed that stems, which at first are perfectly 
unbranched, often throw out a few scattered branches as the season 
advances, so that it is almost impossible to lay down any formula of 
branching that shall be at all constant.
In barren stems the apical joints appear to be invariably branchless 
and very much attenuated, while the median and lower joints are ge- 
nerally more or less branched : the inferior branches, especially when 
their insertion is submerged, are much stouter than the superior ones, 
and are often furnished with whorls of branches, like the main stems.
THE WOOD EQUISETUM.
Equisetdm sylvaticum, Linneus.
This plant, although local, is very widely distributed, occurring in 
moist shady woods throughout the kingdom.
In the vicinity of Lon- 
don it grows in several woods in the Hampstead and Highgate dis- 
trict : at the latter place it was observed as long since as the time of 
Lobel, who records the habitat in his ' Illustrationes Stirpium,' * pub- 
lished in 1655, disguising the English appellation of * Highgate,' un- 
der the scientific term of 'Alice Portce.^ The other English habitats 
with which I have been furnished through the kindness of correspon- 
dents are so numerous that a mere list of them would exceed the space 
* lUus. Stirp.
141).
694 
I can afford for localities.
In Scotland I observed it growing with 
peculiar luxuriance in the vicinity of Loch Fyne, in a little fir-wood 
on a hill side.
The fiuctification had entirely disappeared, and each 
stem had attained its full development, and every pendulous branch 
its full length and elegance.
Altogether I could have fancied it a 
magic scene, created by the fairies for their especial use and pleasure, 
Eqtiisclum sylvaiicum, (barren stem).
and sacred to the solemnization of their moon-lit revels.
It was a fo- 
rest in miniature, and a forest of surpassing beauty.
It is impossible 
to give any adequate idea of such a scene, either by language or illus- 
tration.
In Wales it occurs at Hafod and near the Devil's Bridge, in 
deep shaded ravines, occasionally straggling into open and exposed 
places, but then partially divested of its characteristic elegance.
695 
The figures of this plant are for the most part characteristic, al- 
though some of the older ones might have been more satisfactory.
It 
is so distinct in its appearance and characters that one can hardly fail 
of recognizing it if drawn with even a moderate degree of accuracy.
For the same reason all authors appear to agree in its name, and we 
thus escape the trouble of investigating a confused synonymy.
The roots of the Wood Equisetum are fewer in number and some- 
what smaller than those of the species I have described : they are 
brown, tortuous, occasionally branched, and generally clothed with fi- 
brillse : the rhizoma is horizontally extended, branched and striated; 
in many places it is clothed with fibrillae like those of the roots : it is 
throughout of a dark brown colour.
The stems are of two kinds, fertile and barren : both, when mature, 
are furnished with compound branches.
The fertile stems rise from 
the ground perfectly naked, but most of them soon exhibit incipient 
branches just at the base of the upper sheaths; these quickly elon- 
gate into compound branches, forming several whorls, as represented 
on the next page.
The number of whorls varies from two to 
eight ; I have rarely met with the latter number, and never with more.
Long after the catkin has decayed, these whorls of branches continue 
vigorous, and combine in giving a blunt or flat-topped appearance to 
the entire frond.
They are of a dull, sickly, green colour, succulent 
and striated : the striaj are about twelve or fourteen in number, and 
the ridges between them are armed with minute siliceous points, but 
these are insufficient to communicate any roughness or harshness to 
the plant.
The sheaths are very long and loose, terminating superi- 
orly in three or four large conical lobes, containing on an average three 
striae in each ; the inferior portion of these sheaths is concolorous with 
the stem, the superior or apical portion is of a bright russet brown 
colour.
The catkin is elongate, somewhat pointed, and of a pale brown co-- 
lour; it stands on a slender stalk, of rather more than its own length.
The scales of the catkin are eighty and upwards in number.
The 
catkin is ripe in April.
The barren stems make their appearance almost simultaneously with 
the fertile ones, but are more slender, and the sheaths are much small- 
er, although similarly formed and coloured.
The whorls of branches are 
from ten to twenty in number, and the branches composing each whorl 
gradually decrease in number and length towards the ajiex, M'hicli is 
extremely slender, so much so, that unable to bear its own weight, it 
droops on one side, and is not readily to be distinguished from the 
690 
surrounding branches.
The stria; are more distinct than in the fertile 
stem ; three or four of the ridges run into each of the lobes of the 
sheaths, and unite in its apex.
The branches are very slender, long, and drooping ; they are com- 
monly divided into twelve or fourteen joints, of which the first and 
Equisetiim sylvaticum (fertile stem).
last are the shortest, and the second, third and fourth the longest, and 
emit from near their extremities other slender, long, and drooping 
branches.
This second series of branches is of no uncommon occur- 
rence in Equisetum Telmateja and E.
arvense, but in these species it 
697 
may be regarded as casual, while in the present it is a constant cha- 
racter of the plant.
The ultimate branches are generally triangular, 
each joint terminating in three long pointed teeth.
THE SHADY EQUISETUM.
Equisetum umbrosum, Willdenow.
Equisetum Drummondii, Hooker.
" For this addition to the [British] species of Equisetum we are 
indebted to Mr. Thomas Dmmmond, who found it on the banks of the 
Isla and Esk, in Forfarshire, extending up the valleys almost to the 
698 
sources of those rivers."* Dr. Greville, who has obligingly supplied 
me with specimens, has since discovered it in woods near Forfar ; 
and Dr. Balfour, to whom I am also indebted for specimens, has sup- 
plied me with the following list of Scotch localities : â€” " Woodcock- 
dale wood, near Linlithgow ; in woods at Castle Campbell, near 
Dollar ; in a wood at Carlochar Glen ; head of Glen Isla ; in Camp- 
sie Glen and Finglen, near Glasgow ; in woods near Corra Lin, Lan- 
arkshire ; in woods near Dunfermline ; and in woods at i^uchindenny, 
near Edinburgh." 
This species has also been found in Ireland.
Mr. Moore, of the 
Glasneviu Botanic Garden, says, " I suppose this species is not un- 
frequent in the county Antrim, on the sides of mountain glens where 
the geological formation is similar to that at Wolf Hill, viz.
lias mixed 
with hardened chalk, but of this I am not exactly sure : the only 
place where I have collected specimens was a deep mountain glen 
near Cushendall, called Glendoon : I took it for a variety of E.
syl- 
vaticum, not being then acquainted with the species ; but on compa- 
ring the specimens with those picked at Wolf Hill," the residence of 
William Thompson, Esq., and the original Irish locality, " I found 
them identical, and it strikes me forcibly that I have passed it over in 
several other glens." 
I am not aware of its having yet been recorded as inhabiting Eng- 
land or Wales.
This species is described by Willdenow, Decandolle, Vaucher, 
Diedrich, and other authors, as E.
umbrosum, and by Sir William 
Hooker and Mr. Babington as E.
Drummondii.
It is well figured by 
Vaucherf in all its states ; the figure in ' English Botany ' % repre- 
sents the fertile and barren stems correctly, but neither in the figure 
nor description do I observe any reference to the combination of 
fruit and branches on the same stem.
Diedrich's figure Â§ has fruit 
and branches on one stem, but neither separate.
The roots and rhizoma precisely resemble those of the preceding 
species, the former being small, fibrous, sinuous, often divided, and 
black ; the latter dark brown and striated, and extending horizontally.
The stems are of three kinds â€” Jirst, bearing fructification only ; 
secondly, bearing fructification and branches ; and thirdly , bearing 
branches only.
The fertile stems are four to six inches in height,

slightly striated when living, more evidently so when dried ; they are 
of a pale whitish-green colour : the sheaths are very large and loose, 
and nearly white, in some specimens almost of an ivory whiteness, 
with a brown ring at the base of the teeth, which are from fifteen to 
twenty in number, long, almost seliform, very slightly flexuous, pale 
browTi, and furnished with dilated, membranous, almost transparent, 
whitish edges.
The catkin is terminal, oval, and of a very pale brown 
colour ; at first it appears sessile, but when mature its footstalk is 
very obvious : the scales are forty or fifty in number ; in figure they 
are somewhat hexagonal, and have a conspicuous central depression, 
surrounded by six or seven nearly circular and slightly convex de- 
partments.
The catkin is ripe in April.
When the stem bears both fructification and branches, a character 
overlooked by British botanists in their descriptions, but one of com- 
mon though not constant occurrence, the branches are disposed in 
whorls four to six in number, the first being placed at the base of the 
uppermost sheath, and the others following in succession : the sheaths 
are smaller than in those stems which are fertile only, and larger than 
in the barren stems.
I am indebted to Mr. Cameron, of the Birming- 
ham Botanic Garden, for specimeus in this state, gathered while the 
catkin was still in perfection.
The barren differs from the exclusively fertile stem in having the 
sheaths much smaller and more distant ; the teeth also are shorter, 
fewer in number, and less pointed.
The barren stem is usually divi- 
ded into about twenty joints, of which the four or five lower ones are 
branchless, but each of the others is furnished with a whorl of branches 
varying in number from ten to sixteen in each whorl.
These branches 
at first are somewhat recurved and drooping, as in E.
sylvaticum, but 
they afterwards become spreading and slightly ascending ; they are 
simple, and composed of eight or ten joints, of which the basal one 
is the shortest, being a mere sheath ; the second is sinuous : they are 
usually triangular, and the loose sheath which accompanies each joint 
terminates in three obtuse teeth, which have the extreme tips brown.
The ridges of the stem and branches are beset with minute flinty par- 
ticles, which give the plant a rougher feel than the preceding.
Sir W.
J. Hooker observes â€” " Its nearest affinity is doubtless with 
E. arvense, but it is abundantly distinct.
Its colour is greener and 
less glaucous ; its stem rougher, with closely-set raised points ; its an- 
gles and branches much more numerous ; and the whole barren fi-ond 
is singularly blunt in its outline or circumscription at the extremity, 
by which it may be at once known from E.
arvense.
The sheaths, 
700 
though paler at the base, have blacker and more prominent ribs up- 
wards, and they are so close as almost to imbricate each other.
The 
teeth are also more numerous, when they separate into their proper 
number."* I quite agree with this profound botanist in considering 
the present species abundantly distinct from E.
arvense ; indeed the 
similarity to that plant does not appear to me particularly obvious : 
my idea of what would be termed "its affinities" will perhaps be 
sufficiently expressed by my placing it between E.
sylvaticum and 
E. Telmateja.

â€” Notes on an old volume of Coloured Im2}ressions of 
Plants.
By W.
G. Perry, Esq., F.B.S.E., &c.
A CURIOUS old collection of impressions of plants, slightly coloured, 
lately came into my possession.
Although it is roughly executed, the 
character of the plants is well preserved.
There are about five hun- 
dred and sixty species, contained in a foolscap folio volume of 370 
pages.
The names appended to the plants are evidently copied from 
the second edition of Ray's Synopsis ; which, from the circumstance 
of its being published in 1696, and the third edition in 1724, shows 
that the collection was made in the early part of the last century.
It appears from the localities named that the book belonged to some 
one living in the neighbourhood of Knutsford, in Cheshire.
If any 
Cheshire botanist can affi)rd information respecting the original owner 
of the volume, it would affi^rd me considerable gratification.
I flatter myself that the following localities, transcribed (without 
correction of errors) from this old Cheshire herbal, may not be unac- 
ceptable to some of your readers.

Counties of Worcester, Hereford, and Gloucester; with the 
Precise Stations of the Rarer Plants, and Introductory Obser-

of the District.
By Edwin Lees, F.L.S., &c.
&c.
London : 
Tilt and Bogue, Fleet Street; and H.
Lamb, Malvern.
1843.
Mr. Lees has been so long and so well known as an ardent botani- 
cal explorer, as well as for his persevering efforts to popularize his 
favourite science, that to our readers any other introduction than the 
mere mention of his name would be quite superfluous.
' The Botany of 
the Malvern Hills,' as may be learned from its title, is strictly a local 
Flora of that rich district, and presents a record of the harvest yielded 
to the author's personal researches during a residence of several years 
in the neighbourhood.
The following passage will explain the pains 
taken to render this as correct and complete as possible.
" Althougb the present work is scarcely more than a catalogue, it has taken the 
lahour of years to survey and resurvey the ground minutely, and a multitude of studi- 
ous hours have been spent in determining the less obvious and dubious plants.
I think 
therefore, I may safely say, that there is no mistake in the Phanerogamous ])roductions, 
most of which have again and again passed under my review, and I have excluded 
several species because evidently introduced, my object being to show the really indi- 
genous Flora of the hills.
It is true I have admitted a few agrarians, but these are 
perhaps as old as the introduction of corn, and therefore not undeserving attention.
All the plants are to be understood as having been gathered hif myself, except in the 
few instances where I rely upon the authority of friends who have sent me specimens.
" The Cryptogamic productions of the hills are so varied and curious, that I have 
taken especial note of them, and I much regret that the limits necessarily assigned to 
the present publication, have precluded my entering into the details respecting them I 
desired to do.
I can hardly assert that in this intricate department I have been in every 
case correct in my designations, but I have consulted all the aids in my power.
I have 
deposited specimens of all, or nearly all, the plants I gathered in the herbarium of the 
Botanical Society of London, so that botanists may easily refer to any of them, in case 
a doubt should arise to render it necessary." â€” Preface, p.
vii.
The full reports of a paper by Mr. Lees* on the Botany of this dis- 
trict, which have already appeared in our pages, render it unnecessary 
for us to follow the author through his " Introductory Remarks ; " we 
must, however, give the following extract.
" A good relieving artistical feature is given to the hills at all times by the fallen 
stones in the ravines, for though these are shapeless enough close at hand, and with

small pretensions to beauty, yet in tbe distance they assume a deep purple hue, which 
contrasts well with, aud breaks the uniformity of the green turf.
In the summer, the 
immense quantities of foxglove give a rich pink hue to the rocky slopes they cover, of- 
ten mixed with the tall golden torches of the great mullein ; while in other spots a 
purple mantle is created by the flowering of the wild thyme.
As autumn slowly ap- 
proaches, the gorsy patches sparkle most refulgently, though their golden splendour is 
somewhat chastened by the burnt umber of the withered brakes extending far and wide, 
and scorched by the blaze of August.
In May, the hawthorns and mountain ashes 
wave on the sides of many of the ravines in milk-white purity, while in autumn their 
pendant coral berries give another phase of beauty to the inspiring and diversified 
scene." â€” p.
3. 
We observe from the Enumeration given by Mr. Lees, that since 
his paper was read before the Botanical Society, he has added to the 
Malvern list 34 species of flowering plants and 112 species of Cryp- 
togamia, thus raising the entire number from 1438 to 1584.
The plants are distributed in the three grand divisions of Exogens, 
Endogens and Acrogens ; and under each of these primary divisions 
they are arranged according to the Linneean system, of which Mr.
Lees has always been the champion.
We are also glad to see that 
the artificial system of the illustrious Swede is not without advocates 
among others who hold high rank in the science of Botany ; aud that 
there are still some left, who would regret to see that system con- 
signed to unmerited oblivion, because it has not effected what it was 
never intended for, and consequently what we had no right to expect 
from it.
Let it not be supposed that we are advocating the Linnaean 
system in consequence of being so prejudiced in its favour as to be 
blind to the merits and the excellences of other methods â€” this would 
be falling into the very error we are deprecating ; we only ask for fair 
play â€” we claim for the Linnsean system a fair and unprejudiced exa- 
mination, conducted in a spirit of candour, and with an especial refe- 
rence to the end proposed by Linnaeus in framing it, not forgetting 
that we are most undoubtedly indebted for the present advanced state 
of botanical knowledge, to the invention and operation of this system 
at a period when hardly any other means would have answered the 
same end.
This examination we claim for the Linnaean system ; for 
we cannot help suspecting that perhaps nine-tenths of those who so 
loudly and so clamorously decry it, are entirely ignorant both of the 
system itself, of its practical working, and of the debt of gratitude due 
to its illustrious author, from the present and all succeeding genera- 
tions of botanists- A passage on this subject from the pen of Mr.
Babington has already graced our pages, (Phytol.
642) ; aud we think 
we could not select a fitter place than this, for giving an extract on 
707 
the same subject, from Professor Forbes's admirable ' Inaugural Lec- 
ture on Botany.'* 
" The history of Botany, from the time it first assumed a scientific character to its 
pahny state in the present century, is more instructive than that of any of the other 
Natural-history sciences, though later in its development ; for among the ancients, its 
most eminent votaries, Theophrastus and Dioscorides, were rather herborists than bo- 
tanists, and originated no grand generalizations like those which gave the first impulse 
to zoological science, nursed by the giant mind and indefatigable research of Aristo- 
tle.
But though Zoology started with the speed of the hare.
Botany, like the slow 
tortoise, at length overtook it in the race, and the heavy volumes of Bauhin, Gerarde 
and Caesalpinus, were all so many steps on the way.
It first quickened its speed as a 
science of observation.
Ardent naturalists went forth into foreign climes, and collect- 
ed their vegetable products with indefatigable industry, noting carefully their living 
forms and hues.
Others, tied down by the trammels of home-occupation, gathered the 
plants of their native coimtries and recorded their variations.
Confused ideas of na- 
tural affinities clouded their early arrangements, but from the material so accumulated 
truer notions were in time generated.
The good and kind-hearted, rather than the 
strong-minded, were the first votaries of the science.
The gentleness of the pursuit 
was adapted to the kindliness of their natures.
Their earnest unbiassed studies, origi- 
nating in the admiration of the wonders and beauties of creation, and deej) reverence 
for the great Origin of all things, were the corner-stones of botanical science, and on 
such a sound and firm foundation the superstructure could not fail to be nobly and 
speedily raised.
In time the building was commenced ; Ray, Touruefort, and a host of 
lovers of nature laid the first stones.
Linnaeus and Jussieu were the chosen architects.
" The great Swede, whose many-sided mind made all the science of his time con- 
tribute to his grand purpose of developing the system of Nature, saw at a glance, that 
though there was much material collected, more must be continually gathering, and 
that to make good and rapid use of what had been drawn together, machinery was 
wanting.
" ' Instrumentis et ausiliis res perficietur: quibus opus est nihilominus ad intellectiim quam ad rnanum.'t 
" Linnaeus invented the required instruments and aids.
Whilst he taught that the 
grand aim of Botany should be the discovery of the true arrangement of plants in Na- 
ture, and boldly sketched his idea of what he conceived that arrangement would prove 
to be, â€” in order that such great end might be the more speedily attained, he devised 
two ingenious artificial schemes, which, as he foresaw, led to the desired results.
These 
were the binomial nomenclature, and the classification of plants according to the num- 
ber or arrangement of their sexual organs.
" The first of these inventions, the simplicity of which is that characteristic of all 
the creations of genius, became the greatest means of furthering the progress of Na- 
tural History.
It was endowing it with a universal language, in which all its follow- 
ers might converse with perfect mutual understanding.

and tongue were abolished hy this admirable scheme, the universal and simultaneous 
adoption of which at once proclaimed its own excellence and that of its author.
" The second was, as it were, the mating of an index to a great section of the book 
of Nature.
Those who slightingly think of the Linnsean system, as it is termed, for- 
get in the present to look back fully and fairly on the past.
They should remind them- 
selves of the state in which Botany was when Linneeus undertook to make its treasures 
consultable.
The understanding of things depends greatly on the perception of their 
order and relations.
AVhen that order and those relations require deep study ere we 
can comprehend them clearly, the man who gives us a clew, however insignificant it 
may be in its own nature, is not only confeniug on us an invaluable benefit, but en- 
dowing the despised instrument with golden value.
Such a clew did Linnaeus give 
when he put forth the sexual system.
The scientific systematist, surrounded by the 
stores of his herbarium, should not forget that those treasures were often amassed in 
the first instance by adrenlurous and earnest men, rendering good service by their 
hands and energy, as good in its humble way as that which he gives by his head and 
philosophy.
It was not to be expected of such men that in the field they should oc- 
cupy themselves with thoughts of arrangement or affinity ; their part was to observe 
and select, and the guide to their observation and selection was no other than the 
Liunsean system.
In the scientific hive as in the apiary, there must be working-bees 
and neuters as well as queens and drones : it is necessary for the economy of the com- 
monwealth.
An easy means of acquiring and arranging information is a great help 
to the workman of science, and no department has gained more thereby than Botany, 
which, through the facilities afi"orded by the artificial method devised by Linnsus, has 
had its facts amassed in enormous quantity for the use of its more philosophic vota- 
ries, and owes its present advanced state in a great measure to such humble means.
" The clew to the labyrinth, then, having served such noble purpose, becomes a 
consecrated object, and should rather be hung up in the temple than thrown aside with 
ignominy.
The traveller returning from his adventurous and perillous journey of dis- 
covery, hangs up his knapsack with affection on the walls of his study.
But travellers 
must return to the fields, if more is to be done ; and so must botanists, and each must 
have recourse again and again to those helps which aided them so well in their earliest 
journeys.
" In saying these few words in favour of the Linntean system, I know I am plead- 
ing an unpopular cause : but I speak out freely, partly because T mean to proceed on 
a diff'erent basis in conducting the botanical studies here, and partly because, after the 
once over-enthusiastic attachment to the Linnaeau method which prevailed so long in 
Britain, and which was carried so far as to impede the progress of Botany, a reaction 
has taken place which threatens to blind the eyes of the younger botanists to the me- 
rits of a device which was, and ever will be, a most valuable auxiliary of the science.'' 
â€”p.

We have with great pleasure followed the learned Professor through 
the above able and candid defence of the Linnaean system.
This de- 
fence is doubly valuable, both as emanating from so high a quarter 
and as being perfectly disinterested on the part of the Professor ; from 
these circumstances we consider the defence to derive additional im- 
portance, and to be entitled to additional respect and consideration.
The time is past when the mere facility of finding out the name of a 
700 
plant and referring it to its proper station in a system is to be looked 
upon as the sole end and aim of botanical research ; but why should 
we not use the easiest means of acquiring the true end ?
The vota- 
ries of the so-called natural method are confessedly obliged to have 
recourse to artificial schemes, in order to determine the names and 
stations of the comparatively small number of species indigenous to 
Britain.
We would by no means be understood to wish that Botany 
should be taught exclusively by the Liunaean method j but so long as 
artificial systems are required, and it seems that in Britain at least we 
are not yet able to do without them, we would ask, why not avail 
ourselves of that which is unquestionably the best of all hitherto 
devised ?
The object of all artificial systems of Botany we appre- 
hend to be the same, namely, the enabling the student to ascertain 
with ease and certainty the name of any plant he may meet with ; this 
step gained, the student is in possession of a clew which will enable 
him to follow out the subject in its remotest bearings.
The Linntean 
system, used, as its author intended it should be used, as "an index 
to a great section of the book of Nature," appears to us superior in 
the grand requisites of applicability and certainty tt) any other artifi- 
cial scheme with which we are acquainted ; and thus used, the Liu- 
naean system, as Professor Forbes has well said, will ever be " a most 
useful auxiliary to the science." After thus stating the true aim and 
end of the Liunaean system, the Professor continues.
â€” 
" The aim of Jussieu was of a different kind.
Gifted with a highly philosophic 
mind, he concentrated its powers mainly on one subject.
His devotion produced <ireat 
results.
He placed the study of the natural affinities of plants on a practical basis, 
and originated those views afterwards more fully developed by DeCandolle and other 
distinguished men.
The spirit of Jussieu has presided over the greatest botanical 
works down to the present day, and his influence is as powerful now as when he firet 
expounded to his delighted pupils just views of the vegetable kingdom.
" The genius aud doctrines of Linnaeus and Jussieu having placed Botany on a sure 
scientific basis, hosts of labourers crowded to the field, and the enthusiastic pupils and ad- 
mirers of those great men went forth observing and collecting over every discovered land.
The facts they added demanded new research and modified arrangements.
Still the 
great stage of classijicathm had been attained, aud the science was to enter on the third 
lera of its existence, that oi philosophical investigation.
In that aera we now live.
Its 
characters are â€” the observation of facts, not so much for their own sakes as for the il- 
lustrations they afford of the laws of the science; careful experimental inquiries into 
the phenomena of vegetation, not undertaken as isolated researches, but with a view 
to their comparison with vital phenomena throughout animated nature ; minute ana- 
tomical investigation under the microscope, not conducted merely to display new 
forms of structure, but in the hope of solving, if possible, the problem of the ultimate 
structure of tissues ; the construction of local floras and publication of local catalogues, 
not with the limited view of assisting the inhabitants of a province to a knowledge of 
710 
tbeiv vegetable compatriots, or with the pardonable vanity of showing how many fine 
plants grow in the author's country, but in order that the great laws of the distribu- 
tion of organized beings on the surface of our globe may be discovered and developed ; 
and the construction of systematic arrangements, not framed solely for the ascertain- 
ing of the natural alliances of families, important as such object is, but also with the 
view of discovering the great laws which doubtless regulate those alliances equally in 
the animal and vegetable kingdoms/' â€” p.
19.
It has always appeared to us that those who are the loudest in their 
outcries against the Linnaean system, must be unacquainted with, or 
to say the least, forgetful of, what Professor Forbes has not omitted to 
notice, namely, the well-estabhshed fact, that while Linnaeus was en- 
deavouring to perfect his artificial system, as a means whereby a chao- 
tic mass of materials might be reduced to order, he was no less assi- 
duously labouring to discover the true laws of a natural arrangement, 
and this, he ever insisted, ought to be the grand aim of the researches 
of every botanist.
Thus, in his ' Philosophia Botanica,' after enume- 
rating the different systems and methods of his predecessors and con- 
temporaries, as well as his own sexual system, and another method 
founded on the caly^, he observes : â€” " The fragments of a natural 
method are studiously to be sought for.
This should be the grand 
desideratum with every botanist : " the necessity for endeavouring to 
attain this desideratum being enforced in other parts of the same work.
He then proposes what he modestly calls the fragments of a natural 
method : these exhibit all the genera known to the author arranged in 
sixty-eight orders.
There is, moreover, abundant evidence on record 
to prove that Linnaeus himself was the founder of that system which 
has since been so much improved by the eminent botanists who have 
turned their attention to this branch of the science : such was the ex- 
pressed opinion of the late Sir Joseph Banks ; and Bernard de Jussieu, 
with all the candour of a great mind, says, in a letter to Linnaeus, â€” 
" You may now devote yourself entirely to the service of Flora, and 
lay open more completely the path you have pointed out, so as at 
length to bring to perfection a natural method of classification, which 
is what all lovers of Botany wish and expect." 
We find that we have been strangely led away from the immediate 
subject of the present notice by this discussion ; but we trust the di- 
gression needs no apology.
In conclusion, we can honestly say that 
we heartily recommend Mr. Lees's very neat little book, to all who 
feel an interest in the subject of the geographical distribution of Bri- 
tish plants, and more especially to the botanical visitants of Malvern.

Note on Linaria Cymhalaria.
On the 28th of May, 1841, 
my father called my attention to a curious circumstance respecting 
the ivy-leaved toad-flax, or Aaron's beard {Linaria Cymhalaria).
â€” 
Having a plant in his study, dependant from a suspended flower-pot, 
he observed that all the flowers invariably turned towards the win- 
dow, which faced the south.
Immediately after the blossoms had 
fallen off", and the seeds began to perfect, the stems on which they 
were placed gradually turned round away from the light, to the back 
of the plant.
Conjecturing the cause of this latter motion, he sup- 
poses they revert for the purpose of depositing the seeds.
In order 
to understand this, we must recollect that the toad-flax is procumbent 
and pendulous, growing on old walls in its native state.
Consequent- 
ly it is necessary that the inflorescence, which uniformly projects from 
the wall, should after the fall of the corolla turn towards the back of 
the plant, in order to deposit the seeds on the ^^â– all, otherwise they 
would fall to the ground and perish.
â€” Robert Dick Duncan ; Vale 
of Almond, Mid Calder, Edinbtirg It shire, June 10, 1843.
[The experience of our readers will suggest many other examples of this pheno- 
menon : the Cyclamen offers a curious and interesting instance; and the common pim- 
pernel, being a trailing plant, is analogous to the case above mentioned.
In Lindley's 
' Introduction to Botany ' in the chapter on " The Directions taken by the Organs of 
Plants," is the following passage on this subject : â€” "The ovaria often take a different 
direction after the fall of the corolla than they had before.
Thus, during flowering, 
the ovarium of Digitalis purpurea was nodding like the flower, the direction of which 
it was compelled to follow.
Immediately after the fall of the corolla, it turns upwards 
towards the light, to which it is attracted by its green colour.
A contraiy phenome- 
non is presented by the ovarium of Convolvulus arveusis.
The flower is turned to- 
wards the .sky : as soon as it has foUen, the ovarium takes a direction towards the earth, 
bending down the peduncle.
This cannot be due to the weight of the ovarium, which 
is much lighter than its peduncle, but must depend upon its disposition to avoid the 
light, on account of its pallid hue, which is nearly the same as that of the root.
In 
Convolvulus sepium, on the contrary, in which the ovarium is equally pale, its erect 
position is maintained, and the influence of decoloration counteracted by the greater 
affinity to the light of two large green bracteae in which it is enveloped." â€” p.

Note on Cystopteris alpina at Low Layton.
Having heard, 
about four or five years ago, that this interesting fern â€” all trace of 
which had been long obliterated by the reparation of the ancient wall 
on which it once grew luxuriant and plentiful â€” had again made its 
appearance in the original station, and that a specimen then recently 
obtained from thence had been exhibited at one of the Linnean meet- 
ings ; 1 was induced to extend my wanderings as i'ar as Low Layton 
712 
for the express purpose of endeavouring to obtain a sight of a plant; 
the identity of which had given rise to much difference of opinion 
among several of our most distinguished botanists, although I was en- 
tirely ignorant of the precise locality said to afford the little rarity.
Numerous were my enquiries, and long and wearying my researches 
about "old walls;" and after hours of exertion I well nigh feared that 
my excursion would prove fruitless, when I was fortunately directed to 
an individual in the neighbourhood who knew the station well, and 
had recollection of the visits of metropolitan botanists in search of the 
plant, but who himself doubted its existence there at that time.
How- 
ever, on my proceeding thither by his direction, judge my great de- 
light at beholding, without much trouble in searching for them, from 
tliirty to forty specimens, some beautifully fruited, and all in a thriv- 
ing state.
Several others, I dare say, might have been detected on a 
more minute inspection.
I contented myself with bringing away three 
or four plants only, one of which E have preserved in my herbarium, 
leaving the rest to repay the pains-taking of such others of the lovers 
of our ferns as might chance to bend their steps that way.
Since the 
date above alluded to, I learn from a friend that the wall has again 
been repaired and beautified, and the plant apparently " destroyed " 
a second time ; so that it may not perhaps just now be met with, al- 
though so well established does it seem to have been in that famed 
spot, and such the known tenacity of its existence, that we may well 
suppose it far from impossible that some future patient investigator 
may yet have the pleasure of recording its re-appearance at a remote 
day.
My recollection of the circumstance of finding this fern has 
been refreshed by reading Mr. Newman's charming little note of his 
visit to Ham-bridge, in search of Asplenium viride, as recorded in the 
August number, (Phytol.
671).
That gentleman, however, does not 
tell us he supposes that that plant, being alien to the entire Worces- 
tershire district, is "probably only an escape from a garden," although 
in his elegant ' History of British Ferns ' he mentions the like as his 
belief respecting the somewhat parallel case of the Cystopteris at 
Lay ton.
Are the plants published under the names of C.
regia and 
C. alpina in the Lancashire fem-list (Phytol.
477) identical with the 
Layton plant ?

Cotyledon lutea.
Among several miscellaneous matters of 
botanical prints and tracts picked up at a sale some years ago, some 
part at least of which, I was told, had formerly been in the possession 
of the late Dr. Dyer, there occurred an odd number of the original 
713 
edition of ' English Botany,' which contained the plate of Cotyledon 
liitea, and at the foot of Sowerby's figure was written a memorandum 
in ink, â€” " Specimens on Ashtead Park-wall near Epsom â€” indig : vi- 
de Hist.
Epsom Appendx.
1824." As this species is still retained in 
our catalogues, altliough very dubious habitats only are given for it, 
and, as far as I am aware, the one just named is not among them, I 
should feel gratified, and so, doubtless, would other readers of ' The 
Phytologist,' to hear tidings of the plant or of the Epsom locality.
Possibly some one of the readers of that useful journal may know the 
spot, or possess and could reler to the ' History of Epsom ' alluded to, 
a work with which I am unacquainted.
â€” Id.
[We also should feel great pleasure in learning the history of the specimens of Co- 
tyledon lutea " on Ashtead Park wall near Epsom," though we fear there is no chance 
of establishing their claim to be " indigenous " there.
Our esteemed correspondent, 
Mr. G.
S. Gibson, has kindly favoured us with some extracts from a note received by 
hira from a friend residing in Somersetshire, which, although not amouuling to posi- 
tive evidence that the plant is really to be found in that county, yet carry with them 
such an air of probability, that we feel great pleasure in laying them before our read- 
ers.
Mr. Gibson has not seen the specimen alluded to ; but he informs us that the 
locality is " Blackdown Hill, three miles from Wellington, Somerset : " his correspon- 
dent says, â€” " The specimen that I have was gathered about six years since, and so 
completely answers the description and plate given of it in Smith and Sowerby's Bo- 
tany, that I think we cannot be mistaken ; it was a bright yellow, with a spike of flow- 
ers, but as they were not expanded, it is imperfect.
At the time it was gathered there 
appeared to be only one root ; since that time we have searched for it, but have always 
been unsuccessful." This information is exceedingly interesting, since it points out 
a particular locality, to which especial attention should be paid by those who have the 
opportunity.
Our information respecting the stations of this plant has hitherto been 
very vague, amounting to no more than that it was " Seen by Mr. Hudson, in the gar- 
den of a Mr Clement, who received it from Somersetshire.
Roots, given by Mr. Hud- 
son to the Chelsea garden, have loug flourished there, and from thence the figure in 
Eng. Bot.
was drawn." * In Turner and Dillwyn's ' Botanist's Guide ' it is said to 
grow on " walls and rocks in the West Riding " of Yorkshire, on the authority of Mr.
Tofield ; and in a foot-note Mr. Turner says, â€” " Mr. Fairbairn informed me that the 
stock of this plant, now in the Chelsea garden, originated from a Yorkshire root intro- 
duced by Mr. Hudson."!
The above seems to be the sum of all that is known about 
this beautiful plant, as a British species ; we should be truly glad to have its claims 
to that rank fully established.

With re- 
gard to the Gravesend locality (Phytol.

endeavoured to obtain information of Betsam country-folk â€” no bad 
authorities in the case of a plant so well known as the pseony is to 
most persons ; but my enquiries have not elicited that it has ever been 
seen within memory in a wild state anywhere in that neighbourhood.
Of course, at this distance of time it is impossible to trace old Ge- 
rarde's " conny-beny," or the grounds of farmer Bradley.

Note on drying Plants for the herbarium.
Much of the dis- 
cussion on the subject of immersing plants in hot water previously to 
drying them for the herbarium, appears to have arisen from the indi- 
viduals who have practised it considering the principle intended for 
general application.
Now four fifths of our native plants require no- 
thing but care in changing the papers, to preserve both colour and 
form in the greatest perfection.
And of these I have no doubt that 
the greatest part would be injured, rather than improved, by the hot 
water; G aleobdolon luteum for instance, (Phytol.
673) : consequently 
they do not afford a fair test of the principle.
It is with plants which 
defy the ordinary methods, such for example as several of the Rhinan- 
thacese, that we must have recourse to something more than simply 
changing the papers ; and the experience of myself and friends shows 
hot water to be that resource.
Mr. Gibson's plan of applying artifi- 
cial heat (Phytol.
1. c.) is by far the best and speediest method yet 
made known for drying the generality of plants ; but it will not do 
for certain species, especially succulent ones, any more than hot wa- 
ter is required for Asperula or Barbarea, which indeed suffer from its 
application.
Experiment alone will indicate for what particular spe- 
cies the hot bath is necessary.
In reference the remark on p.
677, 1 
must beg to enquire what is the use of selecting the finest and most 
perfect specimens for drying, if we are subsequently to dissect and 
mutilate them, and so have all our work to do over again ?
Even if 
our intention in forming a herbarium were future dissection of the 
specimens, the hot water cure cannot interfere with their utility for that 
purpose, because with ordinary care the parts of fructification need 
not be wetted.
In my own herbarium I preserve a perfect specimen 
to show the plant, and an inferior one, or some fragments, to cut up 
when I have occasion.
Ophrys apifera, which is the only Orchis I 
have yet dried on the hot water principle, is perfect both in form and 
colour: the flowers were not immersed.
Lathrasa squamaria has de- 
715 
fied every method I have had the opportunity of trying.

Note on Epimediuni alpinum.
On the 19th of June last I vi- 
sited Bingley, for the purpose of making myself better acquainted 
with the Carices &c.
which grow in that neighbourhood, and more 
particularly Epimedium alpinum, as in Mr. Watson's New Guide (at 
p. 275) there is the following reference to that plant: â€” ^^ Epimedium 
alpinum.
Bingley woods, B.
G. (is it still there ?)" In reply to this 
question I would say that the plant, to my knowlege, has been in the 
neighbourhood of Bingley for more than twenty years, as I gathered 
specimens in that locality on the 7th of May, 1821, and again in 1834.
In the fifth edition of Withering's ' Systematic Arrangement ' (ii.
258), 
I find the following reference to Bingley woods: â€” "Mr. Hailstone, 
in Whitaker's Craven, observes that it certainly is not now to be found 
in Bingley woods." There is also something said on this plant in the 
* Yorkshire Flora,' and in the second part of Watson's Guide, but as I 
have not these books at hand, and do not now recollect what is said, 
I will refer the reader to look for himself.
How the Epimedium may 
have got into the neighbourhood of Bingley, I know not ; but certain 
it is that that plant is and has been in that neighbourhood for a great 
length of time, and not confined to one particular place, since I have 
found it on both sides of the river.
On the 19th of June last, Mr.
Ainley showed me the plant growing on the left hand side of the river 
going from Bingley towards Leeds.
When I gathered the plant in 
1821 and 1834, I got it on the other side of the river, and much fur- 
ther from the town.
I do not here make any attempt to prove that 
Epimedium alpinum is a true British plant, but merely to say, in an- 
swer to Mr. Watson's question, that the plant is still to be found in 
the neighbourhood of Bingley.

Note on an apparently undescribed Biitish Carex.
Perhaps 
you will allow me to trespass a little more on your pages, as I have a 
few remarks to offer on a Carex, which appears not to be described in 
any of our works on British plants.
The plant I wish to notice is one 
that is mentioned by Mr. Lees, at p.
48 of his ' Botany of the Malvern 
Hills.' It is now some time since Mr. Lees sent me a speciuien of 
his Malvern plant, and wished to have my opinion as to its specific 
identity.
The specimen sent at that time was in a very young state, 
and I imagined it to be the same as my Carex ovalis, var.
bracteata ; 
however, Mr. Lees has sent me specimens of more complete growth, 
which prove it to be very different from that plant.
A few days ago 
71(5 
I showed the specimens to Mr. Babington, who told me that he be- 
lieved the plant was described by continental writers, and he thought 
he had seen continental specimens.
To this plant I have given the 
provisional name of Carex Malvernensis, which will serve until we 
can make out whether the plant has been previously named or not.
It 
differs from C.
ovalis in having a leafy bractea, which is much longer 
than the spike ; it also differs from that species in its fruit being 
somewhat different in form, and only half the size of that of ovalis.

Note on Ranunculus Mrsutiis.
This appears to be a jjlant 
far from plentifully distributed.
When diligently sought for on the 
authority of various local lists, it has uniformly eluded me ; in fact, 
for some years I have ceased to search for it, and stumbled upon it at 
length only by accident, while driving the other day in the lanes be- 
tween Thorpe-le-Soken and Great Holland, in the county of Essex, 
where it forms gay patches wherever the turf is pared away.
In the 
salt marshes in the same neighbom'hood the most conspicuous plants 
are Statice Armeria and Limonium, Plantago maritima, Scirpus mari- 
timus, Triglochin maritimum, Arenaria marina, Atriplex portulacoides.
The way-side plants next worth mentioning, after Ranunculus hirsu- 
tus, are Onopordon Acanthium, Inula pulicaria (a far less common 
plant than I.
dysenterica), Veronica polita and Erysimum cheiranthoi- 
des.

Note on Epilohium roseum.
This plant is, I fancy, frequently 
overlooked by herborisers.
My acquaintance with it commenced, I 
suspect, many years ago, by the side of a brook running into the Trent, 
near Barton-under-Needwood, in Staffordshire, though it was not till 
yesterday that I satisfactorily determined the species, upon again no- 
ticing the same plant growing with its congeners, E.
hirsutum and 
E. parviflorum, along the banks of a stream called the Pincey, not far 
from its junction with the Stort, near Harlow, Essex.
It may be de- 
tected at some distance, by the thin and delicate character of the leaves, 
the reddish hue of the lower part of the stem, and, above all, by the rosy, 
drooping, half-closed flowers.
As plants of the same neighbourhood 
I may specify Bupleurum rotundifoliura, Trifolium ochroleucum.
Cam-

Note on a new locality for Isnardia palustris, and on the 
small White Water-lily.
Having occasion to pass through the New 
Forest last week, and bearing in mind Mr. Pamplin's " Enquiry re- 
specting ' Nymphsea alba minor,'" in the March No.
(Phytol.
525), I 
717 
made a point of visiting the stream and pools at the entrance of the 
village of Brockenhurst from Lyndhurst.
I found the Nymphsea alba 
there, in abundance, and in full flower, but not varying more than 
usual in size.
I had, however, the satisfaction of seeing in one of the 
pools, and in a neighbouring bog, the rare Isnardia palustris, of which 
this is, T believe, the third known British station.
I may add that I 
gathered a very small white water-lily, in the year 1810, in shallow 
water on the margin of Loch Ard near Aberfoil, in which, the size ex- 
cepted, T could find no difference from the common N.
alba.

Note on the Cerastium latifolium of the Linnean herbarium.
In 'The Phytologist' for the present month (Phytol.
677), Mr. Ed- 
monston disputes the correctness of an idea expressed by myself in a 
former number (Td. 586), to the effect that the Cerastium latifolium of 
Smith and British botanists in general, is truly the species so named 
by Linnaeus ; and further, that the Shetland plant described and fi- 
gured by Mr. E.
(Id. 495) is only another form of the same species.
My own copy of ' The Phytologist,' up to May last, being at present 
in the hands of a binder, I am unable to refer back to the exact words 
of either Mr. Edmonston or myself; but can state that the accuracy 
of my own opinion, as formerly expressed, was afterwards fully con- 
firmed by a reference to the Linnaean herbarium.
There are three 
specimens in that herbarium, labelled " latifolium " in the handwriting 
of Linnaeus.
One of these corresponds tolerably well with the figure 
and description of the Shetland plant, except that the leaves are el- 
liptic varying to ovate (not orbicular, as their length is double their 
breadth), and that the peduncles vary from equal with the flower to 
twice or three times the length of the latter.
The other two specimens 
depart more widely from Mr. Edmonston's Shetland plant, and arc 
quite as well represented by that gentleman's figures of E.
alpinum, 
as by his figure of the Shetland E.
latifolium.
These two specimens 
being single flowering branches, without root or capsule, do not show 
all the characters of the species, but they correspond very closely with 
my flowering specimens from Perth and Sutherland.
Their leaves 
vary from lanceolate acute to elliptic obtuse.
Their bracts are alike 
in size and form, being smaller and more acute than the leaves ; but 
on one of the specimens the bracts have a broad membranous margin, 
while on the other specimen they are herbaceous.
The peduncles are 
rather longer than the solitary flowers.
In all three specimens there 
is a well-defined membranous margin to the sepals ; but this margin 
is not broader in these specimens of C.
latifolium, than is the mem- 
718 
bvanous margin of the sepals in the single specimen of C.
alpinum 
which is preserved in the same herbarium, and also labelled in the 
handwriting of Linnaeus.
The specimen of C.
alpinum appears quite 
glabrous to the naked eye, and has obtuse leaves, like some of my 
Highland and cultivated specimens of the same species.
Mr. Ed- 
monston is doubtless correct in supposing his Shetland plant to be 
the C.
latifolium of Linnaeus, but these specimens in the Linnaean her- 
barium show that he is quite wrong in the specific characters by which 
he proposes to distinguish C.
alpinum and C.
latifolium.
Probably 
the best character will be found in the seeds ; those of C.
latifolium 
(from Perthshire and Sutherland) being muricate, while those of C.
alpinum (from Perthshire) are simply rugose.
C, alpinum has larger 
and paler seeds, with an oblique orifice to its cylindrical capsule.
In 
C. latifolium, the ovate capsule has the orifice scarcely or not at all 
oblique ; though T cannot assert that these characters (drawn from 
the form and orifice of the capsule) are constant in the living plants, 
and they are often lost in the process of drying the specimens.
I 
write of the Linnsean specimens as they appeared to the unassisted 
eye, not having any magnifier at hand when inspecting them.

In May, 
1842, while walking through Tilgate forest, Sussex, I was fortunate 
enough to gather Jungermannia Turneri, a species I believe found by 
no one previously, except by the original discoverer, the late Miss 
Hutchins, in Ireland.

Surrey localities for Schistostega pennata.
In June, when at 
Farnham, Surrey, I had the good fortune to discover Schistostega 
pennata, in great abundance, in Mother Ludland's cave, in all its va- 
ried and beautiful colours.
St Catherine's Hill, Guildford, being of 
similar sandstone, I was induced to search for it there, and found it 
in the sand-martins' holes.

A word on Lastrcea spinulosa.
Mr. Babington, in his excel- 
lent * Manual,' has the following remarks on the plant usually known 
by this name.
â€” 
'â– 'â–  ^.linearis; frond mostly erect scarcely more than twice pinnate often very narrow 
719 
its sides nearly parallel in the lower part, lobes nearly flat with a ivavy midrib, indusi- 
um ^entire.' A.
spinulosum (Sm.).
Small forms of this are often called A.
dumetorum.
I am in doubt if these plants are distinct species or varieties, but require a more per- 
fect knowledge of them than I now possess.
It appears that the A.
spinulosum (Willd.) 
is a different plant, having ' glandulose bristles ' on its indusium ; if therefore Smith's 
plant proves distinct it will require a new name, and I would suggest Smilhii as high- 
ly appropriate." â€” p.
386.
It appears to me that this view of the case is untenable, and I am the 
more inclined to dissent from it, because Mr. Babington has, I fear, 
been misled by some previously published observations of mine.
â€” 
Smith emphatically states that the frond of his Aspidium spinulosum 
is " triangular or deltoid;" it is thus figured in the 'English Botany,' 
(t.
1460); the authentic specimen in his herbarium has this form; and 
all the evidence arising from Smith's description, figure and specimen, 
convince me that a small frond of the plant we call Lastraea dilatata, 
was and is Smith's Aspidium spinulosum.
Mr. Babington's linearis 
appears to me to be the Polypodium spinulosum of Withering, found 
in " bogs on Birmingham heath ; " it is also the plant described by 
myself as "the linear type, erect, rigid, pale sickly green, lateral mar- 
gins of the frond nearly linear, &c." This term (linear), apparently 
adopted by Mr. Babington [linearis), is I believe the only distinguish- 
ing epithet the plant ever received.
Sir J.
E. Smith's part in the trans- 
action appears to have been to misunderstand Withering, and that, 
surely, does not entitle him to the proposed honour.
Had Mr. Babing- 
ton proposed to call the plant Lastraea Witheringii, as a compliment to 
the original describer, no objection could have been raised ; but in 
the present instance the proposed honour appears to me to be misap- 
plied, and I hope Mr. Babington will allow the plant, if raised to the 
rank of a species, to bear the name of linearis, as it certainly has no 
claim to that oi Smithii, or even to that oi spinulosa.

President, in the chair.
Read, " Observarions on a variety of Rosa sarmentacea, Woods (found near Bridge- 
water by Mr. Clarke)," by Edwin Lees, Esq., F.L.S.
Mr. L.
had known this variety for some years ; and though there is considerable 
difference in the more or less deeply cut serratures of the foliage, he had always found 
the calyx to be fringed with stalked glands, as well as the flower-stalks.
The tube is 
generally but sparingly so, or even naked.
It is abundantly covered with glands in 
this variety.
In some manuscript observations on the species, made in 1836, Mr. L.
720 
liad recorded, â€” " Califx pinnate, rather densely covered with glandular bristles, which 
united to a purplish bloom on the segments, as well as on the tube, gives the rose a pe- 
culiar and very elegant appearance.'' The petioles are always more or less glandular, 
without prickles, differing in this respect materially from Rosa canina, as well as in 
the particulars mentioned above.
There is another point, too, which deserves atten- 
tion.
Mr. L.
had often observed that the young foliage of this species has a faint but 
very perceptible cowslip-like scent, but he had never observed this in the leaves of R.
canina.
Mr. L.
contended that Rosa scabriuscula was a good species, though it must 
be observed that the calyx-tube varies in being more or less covered with stalked 
glands, and that therefore Smith is wrong, in the ' English Flora,' in saying with re- 
gard to it, " quite smooth and naked.'' 
The character of this plant, as differing from Rosa canina, consists in the glandu- 
losity of the pinnate calyx and of the peduncle, and in the petioles being slightly glan- 
dular, without prickles, or with very weak ones.
This rose, as far as Mr. Lees had observed, is not very abundantly distributed, be- 
ing somewhat local, and plentiful only in particular spots.

The President drew the attention of the Society to an abnormal form of Ophrys 
apifera, which had been sent to him by a lady, from Dorking.
The two lower flowers 
of the spike had two distinct united columns, the upper normal one being rather the 
longest, and overlapping the other; the upper flowers had three columns united into a 
singlar triangular mass ; the upper petals of each of the flowers were rather reduced ; 
the lips of the two lower flowers were small, and retained in part the usual character 
of the flower, but the lip of the upper flower was lilac, and exactly resembled the sepals 
in form and colour.
The three sepals of the middle flower were united together nearly 
to the lip, as was the case also with two sepals of the terminal flower.
The ovaries of 
all the flowers were of the normal structure.
The President stated that the Rev. Gerard E.
Smith had figured an Ophrys with 
a similar triple column, but his specimen was quite destitute of a lip.
He also ob- 
served that it might be worth while to examine if this excessive development of the 
column is always coexistent with the reduced development of the lip ; and that this 
structure was quite distinct from the monstrosity of this plant described by Mr. His, 
where each of the three petals was transformed iiitoapolleniferous column.â€” G.E.D.

This beautiful species occurs in almost every county of England, 
but more abundantly in the neighbourhood of London than in other 
localities.
Hampstead Heath and the neighbouring woods afford se- 
veral well-known stations ; it occurs also in Scotland and Wales, and 
Mr. Mackay observes that it is frequent in Ireland.
It is apparently 
common on the continent of Europe, but does not reach the extreme 
north, not being mentioned by Linneus or Wahlenberg as inhabiting 
Lapland or Sweden.
Although so common a plant, much difference of opinion appears 
to prevail respecting the degree of moisture required for its nutriment, 
as will be seen by a reference to the following pages of ' The Phyto- 
logist;'â€” 588, 618, 621, 648 and 649.
The more I investigate the subject, the more do I feel strengthened 
in my original vievr of the case, confessing, however, that my oppor- 
tunities of judging are confined to two or three localities, of which I 
select that at Norwood, recorded by Mr. Ilott (Phytol.
295).
The site 
is the brow of the hill, on the road towards Dulwich, below ' The 
Woodman ' public-house at Norwood ; the ground is partially waste, 
having apparently been excavated for brick-earth, and is sufficiently 
moist for little pools of water to collect in the hollows ; partially, how- 
ever, it is cultivated, there being now (August, 1843), a fine crop of 
wheat ready for the sickle.
The Equisetum is abundantly mixed with 
the wheat in every direction as far as I could see, but its growth is not 
luxuriant, few of its stems attaining half the height of the wheat, and 
many falling very far short of even that stature.
While this fact, how- 
ever, proves that it will grow in soil sufficiently dry to produce good 
wheat, its diminished size affords little evidence on either side, for 
the constant disturbing of the roots in arable land produces an equal- 
ly diminishing effect on E.
arvense, the stems of which in the hedges, 
where the roots remain untouched, often attain a magnitude four times 
as great as those in the adjacent fields.
On the uncultivated land the 
most luxuriant growth, measuring four feet and a half or five feet in 
height, was on the banks where all parts of the plant are comparative- 
ly free from being disturbed, and the soil loose, loamy and crumbling; 
but the approach to the little pools, as well as to exposed, dry, and 
trodden parts, was marked by a gradual decrease in the size of the 
plants, until, in the immediate vicinity of the water and trodden paths, 
the stems were perfect pigmies, scarcely four inches in height, thus 
inducing the conclusion that, in this locality, water is prejudicial, if 
not fatal, to the existence of the plant, and that closeness an 1 com- 
723 
pactness of soil is also unfavorable ; a more extensive record of obser- 
vation is still to be desired.
It is hinted by Haller that the Roman people ate this plant, but the 
passage is so brief as to throw little light on the subject.* 
Considerable difference of opinion appears to prevail on the subject 
of its being eaten by animals.
Mr. Watson, in one of the passages 
above referred to, states that horses graze on it, (Phytol.
588).
Mr.
Gibson says that horses will not eat the plant at all, if they can get 
anything else, (Id. 618).
On the occasion of my first visit to the Nor- 
wood station, there were three half-starved cadger's horses upon the 
waste ground where the Equisetum is growing ; they devoured eager- 
ly the coarse sour herbage growing about the pond, and almost every 
green blade they could find ; indeed it seemed as though they seldom 
had an opportunity of making a meal, but they pertinaciously refused 
to touch the Equisetum.
The representations of this plant generally fail to give a correct idea 
of its figure, from the circumstance that the summit only of the stem 
is given ; in other respects those in ' English Botany ,'t Bolton's Fili- 
ces'l and Dietrich's 'Cryptogamia of Germany ,'Â§ are tolerably correct.
It has already been shown that the nomenclature of this species is 
somewhat confused, but I trust that botanists generally will agree with 
me in restoring the earliest (binominal) name.
There is little doubt 
of its being the Equisetum maj us of Rayll and of Gerarde,1[ but not

it to be Ehrhart's E.
Telmateia ; and, finally, the Equisetum fluviatile 
of Smith, Hooker, and Babington, and of many continental botanists.
It also appears clear that it was totally unknown to Linneus, and, con- 
sequently, neither named nor alluded to in any of his works.
The 
names given by Ray, Gerarde, and other authors antecedent to Lin- 
neus, are dropped by universal consent : that the plant in question is 
a variety of E.
arvense will not now be maintained; so that we una- 
voidably arrive at Ehrhart's name of Telmateia, published fifty-five 
years ago.
Ehrhart's names were never, 1 believe, intended by their 
author as specific names, and, moreover, have been rejected as fanci- 
ful by many of our later botanists ; but the latter objection scarcely

holds good in any instance, and certainly not in the present, for the 
Greek word rsXfjiarBios, signifying * growing in mud,' is less fanciful, as 
applied to the present species, than the Latin w ord Jltwiatile, or 'grow- 
ing in rivers.' Moreover, the former objection is oveiTuled in the pre- 
sent instance, by Ehrhart's name having been employed in the ' Flora 
Danica,'* a work of acknowledged authority, and recently by Dietrich, 
as quoted above.
I may also add that it is received as authority by 
Wahlenberg, than whom we have no more careful or pains-taking 
nomenclaturist.
Fertile stem of Equisetum Telmateiai.
The roots and rhizoma present no peculiar characters ; the latter is

725 
generally of an ebony blackness, and seems to spread with considera- 
ble rapidity, so that when once introduced a large patch is soon formed.
The stems are of three kinds, as in the preceding species ; firsts 
bearing fructification only ; secondly, bearing both fructification and 
branches ; and thirdly, bearing branches only.
The exclusively fer- 
tile stems come up in March, shed their seed in April, and disappear 
in May : the figure on the opposite page represents a fertile stem 
of the natural size and proportions, but divided for more conveni- 
ent representation : it is nine inches in length, and has six joints, se- 
veral shorter and subterranean ones having served to unite it with the 
rhizoma.
I have, in some instances, found the total number of joints 
to be fifteen ; the stem, scarcely observable, owing to the great length 
of the sheaths, is pale brown, smooth and succulent.
The sheaths are 
very large, loose and spreading towards the summit, distinctly stri- 
ated, and terminate in from thirty to forty long, slightly flexuous, se- 
tiform teeth ; the sheaths at the base are pale brown, but are much 
darker towards the summit.
The catkin is about two inches and a 
half in length, and at length an inch and a half in circumference : the 
scales are very numerous, often reaching four hundred in number ; 
they are arranged in whorls, of which the lower ones are always suf- 
ficiently obvious.
When the stem bears both fructification and branches, it is seldom 
in perfection until the month of August : such stems are far less nu- 
merous than in either of the preceding species, and bear but a small 
proportion to those which are exclusively fertile or exclusively bar- 
ren : the catkin is much smaller than under ordinary circumstances : 
the stem also is smaller, although having longer joints ; the sheaths 
are shorter, less spreading, and of a pale green colour ; the branches 
are placed on the second to the ninth or tenth joint, counting from 
the catkin ; in all the specimens I have seen they are ascending.
The barren stem is much larger than in any other species of Equi- 
setum with which I am acquainted : it occasionally attains a height 
of seven feet, and a circumference of more than two inches ; its out- 
line and proportions are shown, on a very reduced scale, at page 721, 
fig.
a, and one of the internodes, with its accompanying sheaths, is 
represented of the natural size at fig.
h. 
The following is the description of a living stem now before me, of 
the average size.
The entire length above ground, and including the 
ascending branches, is fifty-four inches ; the circumference, at twelve 
inches from the ground, is an inch and a half, but decreases upwards 
until it becomes extremely slender, terminating almost in a point.
726 
The surface of the stem is perfectly without ridges or furrows ; the 
number of joints is forty : the colour of the internodes is white, with 
the slightest tinge of green, but those on the lower part of the stem 
often change to intense black: the black makes its first appearance in 
spots or blotches, giving the stem a singularly variegated appearance, 
but it rapidly spreads, and finally entirely occupies all the lower in- 
ternodes.
The sheaths, at the stouter part of the stem, are fully half 
an inch in length, and the teeth are as much more : the former have 
about thirty-two deep and distinct striae, which are furnished w^ith rows 
of siliceous particles at their edges : the spaces between the strioB have 
broad shallow furrows.
The teeth are slender, setiform, closely ap- 
pressed to the stem, frequently adhering at the summit in twos and 
threes, and furnished with dilated, semi-membranous, somewhat rag- 
ged edges at the base.
The sheaths are pale green, with a distinct 
blackish ring at the summit ; the teeth are black, with the membra- 
nous edges brown, and, in the lower sheaths, often clothed with a 
brown, byssoid pubescence.
Each of the joints, with the exception 
of five forming a slender apiculus at the summit, and six nearest the 
ground, is furnished at the base of its accompanying sheath with a 
whorl of slender branches : those of the lower sheaths are short and 
recurved, while those near the summit are nine inches in length, and 
nearly erect : the varied direction of the branches is shown at fig.
a. 
The number of branches in a whorl is very various : the respective 
numbers, counting from the summit, are these : â€” five, six, seven, 
eight, nine, ten, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen, eighteen, twenty, 
twenty-five, twenty-nine, thirty-three â€” repeated eleven times, thirty, 
twenty-eight, and sixteen, making a total of six hundred and seventy- 
eight.
The colour of the branches is a delicate green, so beautiful as 
to attract the eye at a considerable distance.
Each of these branches 
is composed of about eight or nine longish joints, and each joint ter- 
minates in a loose sheath : the branches have either eight or ten ribs, 
imited in pairs, and rough with siliceous particles : the sheaths termi- 
nate in four or five teeth, each furnished at the extremity with a slen- 
der black bristle : a pair of ribs ascends into each of the teeth, and 
each rib is furnished, near its termination, with a series of rather long 
siliceous points, which give it a pectinated appearance.
Such may be 
received as the descrijDtion of a stem of normal size and characters, 
and the variations are very unimportant, chiefly consisting in size and 
number of branches, but rarely interfering with the figure of the frond, 
unless caused by circumstances, either of wet or drought, both appa- 
rently uncongenial to i<s perfect development.
One character, how- 
727 
ever, must not be passed over in silence, and that is, the liability of 
the branches to emit two, three, four, or even five, secondary branch- 
es, from the summit of the second joint : these branches are usually 
slender, and when present, they give the plant a beautifully compound 
and feathery appearance.
The stem presents a transverse section very different from that of 
any other species (fig.
d).

THE CORN-FIELD EQUISETU^T.
Equisetum arvense, Linneits.
728 
This is, beyond all comparison, the most abundant of our British 
Equisetums ; indeed it is a serious nuisance to the farmer and gar- 
dener, whose utmost efforts to eradicate it frequently prove ineffectual.
It appears to have little choice of locality, being equally common in 
dry and moist situations.
The name of this species is now universally received, and I am 
not aware that any doubt exists as to its being the Equisetum arvense 
of Linneus, although there is some confusion in the nomenclature of 
the specimens in the Linnean herbarium, as already shown.
The 
barren stem of this plant is without doubt the 'Equisetum arvense 
longioribus setis ' of Ray's ' Synopsis,'* and it also seems to me that 
the ' Equisetum pratense longioribus setis,' of the same work, although 
added by the careful Dillenius, is the same plant.
Still this latter 
has sometimes been considered distinct as a species, and identical 
with the continental E.
pratense, which is so carefully described by 
Roth,t and previously, although not so fully, by Ehrhart-I Roth, 
however, admits that he had never seen the catkin, and the circum- 
stance of this being found on a branch-bearing stem forms the chief 
diagnostic of the species.
Willdenow, who describes the species,Â§ 
confesses he has not seen it at all, and almost every other author 
omits it altogether : thus it appears not improbable that some form 
of E.
arvense was the plant originally intended.
The 'Equisetum 
nudum minus basilieuse ' of Ray can be none other than the fertile 
stem of E.
arvense, as I think is sufficiently proved by the following 
passage.
â€” " This was first shew'd to Mr. Lawson at Great Salkeld, 
but grows in so great plenty there and everywhere on the banks of 
the River Eden, that he could not but wonder that this was the first 
time of its being observ'd in England.
'Tis an early and quickly 
fading Vernal Plant, which might probably be the Occasion of its 
not being hitherto taken notice of by those curious Gentlemen, who 
commonly began their Circuits too late in the Year for such a Dis- 
covery ."|| The ' Equisetum nudum minus variegatum basiliense ' of 
Bauhin,1[ is quoted by Smith as synonymous with his E.
variegatum, 
and by Linneus as synonymous with his E.
hyemale, which plants 
widely differ from the early disappearing plant described by Mr.
Robinson in the passage above cited.

The figures of this very common plant are so different, that it seems 
impossible to reconcile the discrepancy otherwise than by a reference 
to the protean character of the original : that in Curtis's ' Flora Lon- 
dinensis ' * may perhaps be cited as the best.
The corn-field Equisetum is supposed to be very injurious to cat- 
tle ; it is, however, most probable that they will not touch it, unless 
compelled by extreme hunger.
This seems to be the only British species in which the fertile and 
barren stems are perfectly and constantly distinct, and of a different 
structure, the former having generally completely vanished long be- 
fore the latter have acquired their full development.
In those species 
which are constantly simple, i.
e., without whorls of branches, it ap- 
pears the character of each stem to produce a terminal catkin, conse- 
quently, there is no observable difference in the structure of the fertile 
and barren stems : in the following species, E.
palustre and E.
fluvi- 
atile, the same general character obtains, the grand distinction being 
in the almost constant presence of whorls of branches: in E.
sylvati- 
cum a marked difference is observable, for not only are a portion of 
the stems exclusively fertile and rapidly evanescent, but the mixed 
stems â€” those which bear both catkin and branches â€” are decidedly 
different to the exclusively barren ones, being more succulent, and 
having larger and looser sheaths : in E.
umbrosum the discrepancy 
between fertile and barren stems is so great, that the combination of 
the two, although common, has not been noticed by our British au- 
thors : in E.
Telmateia these mixed stems are comparatively rare ex- 
ceptions, and have almost been regarded as unnatural or monstrous, 
so that we arrive, by a nearly imperceptible transition, at E.
arvense, 
in which the two kinds of stem are perfectly and constantly distinct.
The figure at p.
727 represents two stems of the corn-field Equise- 
tum, of the natural size, a a being the fertile, h h the barren stem : 
they are drawn from living specimens, and show the immature barren 
stem synchronous with the perfectly ripe fertile one, both stems as- 
cending from the same rhizoma; and I may here remark that the ap- 
pearance of the barren stem at this early period, is very similar in E.
sylvaticum, umbrosum, Telmateia and arvense, so that the figure re- 
ferred to gives a good idea of them all.
The fertile stem selected for 
the figure, as one of average size and proportions, may be thus de- 
scribed : it is about nine inches in length, and is divided into eight 
joints, which decrease in length from the catkin downwards: the stem

is extremely succulent, of a pale brown colour, smooth, and entirely 
without furrows : the sheaths are loose, somewhat gibbous, and dis- 
tinctly ribbed : they are of a pale yellowish brown colour at the base, 
and have about ten dark brown long-pointed teeth : these occasion- 
ally adhere at the points, in twos and threes.
The catkin is an inch and a quarter in length, rather slender, blunt 
and rounded at the apex, and stands on a distinct foot-stalk, usually 
about equal to half its own length ; it is of a pale delicate brown co- 
lour, occasionally tinged with rosy red ; the scales are very variable 
in number, being sometimes scarcely a hundred, at others reaching 
two hundred and fifty.
The catkin is mature in May, and sheds abun- 
dance of seed, of a beautiful green colour.
The following is a description of a barren stem.
Length twenty- 
eight inches; very slender at the summit, and increasing to the size 
of a goose-quill at the base : the colour is glaucous green towards the 
summit, and pale green towards the base : the stem has from ten to 
sixteen distinct but not very deep furrows, and the same number of 
equally distinct ribs, which are furnished with very minute siliceous 
points; the number of joints is twenty-one: the length of the inter- 
nodes varies from half an inch at the summit to two inches at the base : 
the sheaths, including the teeth, are scarcely more than a quarter of 
an inch in length ; they are but little larger than the stem, not, how- 
ever, clasping it tightly, as in E.
fluviatile ; they are furrowed in the 
same manner as the intemodes, but the ribs are double : the teeth are 
ten to sixteen in number, wedge-shaped, acute, and dark brown or 
black ; they are commonly, but not constantly, furnished with a nar- 
row, brown, marginal membrane : I have never seen the teeth of this 
species with the distinct, white, semi-hyaline membrane, which ap- 
pears constant in E.
palustre, E.
umbrosum, and some other species.
There is a whorl of branches on each of the thirteen upper joints, the 
eight lower ones being branchless : the number of branches in a whorl 
varies from four to thirteen.
The branches are eight or ten inches in 
length, rather stout, spreading, slightly ascending, four-ribbed, and 
composed of ten or twelve joints, of which the apical ones are shortest; 
the basal joint is shorter than the three which follow it, but is much 
longer than in E.
palustre, and still more so than in E.
umbrosum : 
the short sheath at the base of each branch usually terminates in ob- 
tuse brown segments : the other sheaths are loose, and terminate in 
four long acute teeth, which are generally concolorous throughout ; 
and a single rib invariably ascends undivided to the extreme point of 
each tooth.
731 
The variations of the hanen stem of this plant appear almost infi- 
nite ; perhaps its normal character may be defined as nearly erect, 
with spreading and slightly drooping branches : the following is an 
enumeration of the more strongly marked varieties.
A. â€” Stem erect ; branches simple, very rigid, erect and densely 
crowded.
B. â€” Stem erect; branches simple, less rigid, spreading, slightly 
ascending.
C. â€” Stem erect ; branches simple, gracefully drooping.
D. â€” Stem erect ; branches compound in the same manner as in E.
sylvaticum, and gracefully pendulous.
E. â€” Stem almost prostrate, with semi-erect, very long, compound, 
feeble branches.
F. â€” Stem prostrate, with scattered, simple, irregular, seraiprostrate 
branches.

Wilson, Esq.
(Continued from page 659).
Having had opportunities, during a recent visit to North Wales, 
for extending my observations on the embryo of Juniperus communis, 
I now resume this subject, after a very careful examination, as one of 
considerable importance in the present enquiry.
On reference to my 
former observations (Phytol.
625, fig.
3, 4), it will be seen that the 
naked ovule consists at first of a wide-mouthed sac, at the bottom of 
which is seated a roundish nucleus, somewhat flattened at the top.
The nucleus, at this early stage, is composed of a simple mass of cel- 
lular tissue, without any tunic.
The upper part of the ovules (of 
which there are three in each flower) projects beyond the floral inte- 
gument, and there is thus offered every facility for direct communica- 
tion between the pollen and the nucule ; so much so, that the grains 
of pollen might probably gain immediate access to the interior with- 
out the intervention of pollen tubes.
Indeed, if the views of Schlei- 
den were well founded, and if the upper part of the ovule be denied 
the function of a stigma, we might expect that this plant would clear- 
ly and readily exhibit proof of such access.
If we fail to trace the 
pollen-tubes into the nucleus, where all the parts are so much exposed 
to view, the integuments so few, and the whole structure so much sim- 
plified, â€” in vain shall we hope to verify the statements of those who 
maintain this doctrine ; and for this reason I strongly recommend 
732 
those who are interested in the enquiry, to lend their aid in the inves- 
tigation of this plant at the proper season.
From the period when the 
flowers expanded to the middle of August, I had no means of study- 
ing the subject; and it will be seen by what follows, that the ovule, 
during this interval, has undergone a most remarkable change.
To 
illustrate my remarks, I have judged it best to present the annexed 
diagram (fig.
1), representing a longitudinal section of the ovule in the 
third month after the expansion of the flower.

embryo.

Fig. 3.
â€” The bundle of vessels in a younger stage, partly separated, to show the structure.
The outer portion of the ovule (Â«) has become much enlarged in all 
parts except at the summit, where there still exists a minute orifice, 
and the substance, once soft and cellular, is now altered into a hard 
bony shell, lined on the inside with a thin membrane, which may be 
detached when the berry is fiilly ripe.
The next integument [b) is 
the secundine, white, and somewhat leathery in texture, attached by 
its base to the bottom of a.
It corresponds with the nucleus figured 
at p.
625 : all the contained parts have been subsequently developed.
733 
The tercine (c) is suspended from the top of h, and constitutes the al- 
bumen in the mature seed.
It is already white and amylaceous in- 
ternally, and is surrounded by a yellowish skin.
The upper part of 
the tercine or albumen contains a cavity (the embryo-sac) which gra- 
dually narrows to the top, where there is no visible orifice.
Within 
this cavity is suspended, from the apex of the tercine, a bundle of fi- 
bres [d], composed of large, elongated, crooked cellules, enlarging as 
they descend, each fibre slightly cohering to those which are in con- 
tact with it.
Three or four of the terminal cells of the bundle, are 
tipped each with a roundish mass of opaque granular matter, one of 
which at length grows larger than the rest ; and this it is, which, after 
much pains devoted to the enquiry, I am led to consider as the rudi- 
mentary embryo.* It is shown in the drawing at fig.
2, where a re- 
presents a longitudinal section of the albumen, the upper part of which 
is lacerated by art, in order to display the contained parts, namely, 
the rudimentary embryo (5) suspended by the lax and tortuous bun- 
dle of vessels already described, and which in an earlier stage is seen 
at fig.
3. 
In a few instances the immature or green berries of the present sea- 
son had the embryo completely formed, extending from one end of 
the albumen to the other, as in the fully ripe berries of the former year, 
still remaining on the same plants.
In these the umbilical cord {d) 
is pushed up and crumpled into a narrow space at the top, and by its 
presence at that stage has materially assisted me in ascertaining that 
the body c is not itself the embryo, but the nidus in which the embryo 
is elaborated, long after the usual period of fecundation.
From the foregoing account it seems very improbable that so many 
newly developed parts should derive their existence fiom a pollen - 
tube, while the embryo itself is still in a rudimentary state j and the 
idea of the formation of a vesicule emhryonnaire {utricule primordi- 
ale, Mirbel), such as Brongniart describes it, appears to be utterly in- 
admissible in the present case.
Questions of this intricate nature are 
however to be disposed of only after rigorous investigation ; and it is 
hoped that some of the readers of ' The Phytologist ' will be able to 
supply the hnks which are wanting to complete the present enquiry.
As an appendix to my remarks on Statice Armeria (Phytol.
657), I 
wish to state that during my absence from home two other species, â€” 
* It may possibly be the utricule primordiale of Mirbel and Spacli, " whose special 
office it is to form the embryo, (dont roflSce special est de commencer rembryoii,)'' 
S. Limonium and S.
spathulata, â€” were cai'efully examined and com- 
pared with the one already described.
In S.
Limonium, the cellular 
body within the ovarium proceeding from the styles, is attached to the 
apex of the ovule, but so slightly, that I have not succeeded in dis- 
secting away the surrounding parts without breaking the connexion.
The secundine has no conical cavity at its apex, like that seen in S.
Armeria, and there is no appearance of penetration : on the contrary, 
the suspensor merely covers the apex of the ovule, like a pentagonal 
cap.
A similar structure is observable in S.
spathulata, only that the 
suspensor is crooked, and obliquely attached to the ovule.
In both 
these cases, the connexion exists previously to the expansion of the 
flower-bud.
Having paid some attention to Tropaeolum majus since the essay 
on that plant was republished (Phytol.
659), candour obliges me to 
confess that I have not been able to verify some of the statements con- 
tained in Dr. Giraud's paper ; and I am compelled either to question 
the aptitude of his observations, or to admit my own inability to fol- 
low him in the path which he has trod.
I do not deny that his con- 
clusions are just, but they seem to me to be founded upon data less 
cogent than actual demonstration.
I am not even satisfied that he is 
correct in saying that the ovule is anatropous : if it be so, the change 
must take place at a much earlier period than the one which he indi- 
cates.
But admitting, for the present, that his remarks are accurate, 
I would observe that the ovule of Tropaeolum is by no means, as 
Schleiden himself confesses, an easy subject for investigation ; and 
that whoever succeeds with that, may calculate on still greater suc- 
cess in the examination of those which I have endeavoured to illus- 
trate: and to such an one I would very willingly resign the task, as 
much more competent than myself to explore these secrets of Nature.
It is remarkable enough that Tropaeolum majus has been selected by 
Schleiden as one of the examples in support of his doctrine, and he 
has given figures which exhibit the pollen-tube in actual communi- 
cation with the ovule, introduced within the micropyle.
It is to be 
feared that Schleiden is not the only person chargeable with having 
imagined rather than actually seen some things connected with this 
intricate subject ; and the "necessity of adopting a good method of 
oft-repeated, scrupulous and patient observation" cannot be too much 
insisted upon.
In no case can the microscope be safely trusted, un- 
less the parts can be separated and displayed by careful manipulation.
Much of the knowledge that is acquired while engaged in dissecting 
objects under the microscope, is otherwise unattainable ; and many 
735 
optical illusions are dispelled by calling in the organ of touch to aid 
and correct the eye in these subtile disquisitions.

Several plants peculiar to the neighbourhood of the sea, but not 
uncommon near it, such as Silene maritima, Arenaria marina and pe- 
ploides, Statice Armeria, &c., I have purposely omitted.
The following, which are stated in the ' Botanist's Guide ' to grow- 
near Weymouth, I have searched fRr unsuccessfully ; namely, Vicia 
bithynica, Lathyrus Nissolia, Polycarpon tetraphyllum, Amaranthus 
737 
Blilum, Cladium Mariscus, Calamagrostis Epigejos and lanceolala, 
and Agrostis setacea ; and am ready to fear that most of them have 
become extinct.
Salicornia radicans, too, does not appear to grow at 
Weymouth, and probably S.
herbacea, which is very fine and abun- 
dant, has been mistaken for it.
I explored all the localities given for Vicia la3vigata, without suc- 
cess: these localities are, in the * Botanist's Guide,' Portland Island, 
Chesil bank, and Lodmoor near Weymouth ; in the ' English Flora,' 
a field half way between Weymouth and Portland ferry, near the sea.
At Portland island and the Chesil bank I could discover nothing at 
all similar to it, though the latter was examined for several miles ; at 
Lodmoor the stony beach produces Vicia lutea abundantly, as also 
does a green declivity of the cliff, about half way between Weymouth 
and the ferry, probably the field referred to in the ' English Flora; ' 
but in neither place could I see any trace of V.
laevigata.
Perhaps 
some of your correspondents may be able to state whether it has re- 
cently been found near Weymouth, or whether there is now any au- 
thentic locality for this very rare plant.

(Concluded from p.
60S).
On the route from Appin to lUawarra, over a sandstone country, 
elevated about 2000 feet above the level of the sea, four species of 
Grevillea were observed, one of them having brilliant scarlet blossoms, 
and a gay Mirbellia, with bluish purple flowers, besides several spe- 
cies of Dillwynia, Pultenaea and Boronia, and the gigantic lily, Do- 
ryanthes excelsa.
In descending, the sides of a rough track, called 
the Bulli Road, were ornamented with a gay Prostanthera, Pimelia 
hypericifolia, Pittospermum undulatum and another fragrant species 
of this genus, and a handsome white Clematis.
In a forest in the vicinity of Wollongong â€” 
" Some large species of fig are met with, as well as large gum-trees, and species of 
Tristania ; also Metrosideros capitata, called here turpentine-tree, which attains a 
large stature, and Sterculia acerifolia, which has large clusters of small flame-colour- 
ed flowers, that produce a striking appearance in spring.
The cabbage palm, Cory- 
pha australis, abounds by the sides of water-courses.
Great numbers of this palm, 
which has elegant, fan- like foliage, and hard, purple seeds, the size of a marble, arc 
3 R 
738 
tlcstroycd for tlie sake of their trunks and leaves.
The trunks, which are sometimes 
eighty feet high, and are rough with scars where the leaves have fallen off, are occa- 
.sionally split, and converted into posts for fencing ; they are also used for slabs in tem- 
porary buildings.
The inside being rather sweet, and not hard, though fibrous, is eaten 
by pigs.
The mature leaves are used for thatching, those just beginning to expand, 
for making hats, and the heart, or cabbage, of the young, unexpanded leaves, is eaten 
either raw or cooked.
A heart-leaved species of pepper climbs like ivy among the lof- 
ty trees, and hangs in festoons from their branches, almost to the ground.
Ferns and 
orchidaceous plants abound on the trunks and limbs of many of the trees.
One of 
tlie latter, Sarcochilus falcatus, with blossoms nearly as white as snowdrops, is now in 
Hower.
In these forests, there are many epiphytes of the Orchis tribe, the habits of 
which are worthy of notice, both as exhibited here, and in other parts of the Colony.
Dendrobium speciosum generally grows in fissures of the sandstone rocks, among the 
loose fragments, mixed with vegetable matter, but I once met with it, of extraordinary 
size, in the cleft of an old fig-tree, among vegetable remains.
D. linguiforme gene- 
rally creeps on grit rocks, rarely on the living bark of figs and Casuarinse.
The other 
species of Dendrobium, with the genera Sarcochilus and Gunnia, grow on the bark of 
living trees.
Once T saw Dendrobium calamifolium on a rock ; but both this and the 
other species growing on living trees, begin to languish when the trees to which they 
are attached, die, probably from the portion of their roots adhering to the bark becom- 
ing dried ; a circumstance that is prevented, when they are cultivated in England, 
by the moist atmosphere of an orchideous-house.
The Australian species of Cymbi- 
dium universally strike their roots into the decaying portions of trees, in which they 
may sometimes be traced many feet.
Once only, I met with one growing from among 
the paper-like lamina; of the bark of Melaleuca viridiflora, and it looked sickly." â€” 
p. 426.
On the way to Shoal Haven, Seaforthia elegans is plentiful in shady 
])laces, and many parts of the forest are gay with a species of Goodia, 
which forms a large shrub, covered with racemes of yellow, pea-like 
blossoms, tinged with orange.
A species of indigo, with rosy pink 
flowers, and tree-nettles, one of which was sixteen feet in circum- 
ference, attracted our traveller's attention.
Asplenium Nidus and 
Acrostichum alcicorne were growing on the limbs of enormous fig- 
trees, and even some of the lofty cabbage-palms were encircled by 
the latter, while ferns of less magnitude â€” Polypodium tenellum and 
cptercifolium, and Niphobolus rupestris â€” were climbing the trunks of 
trees like ivy, and others â€” as Adiantum formosum and assimile, Doo- 
dia aspera and Lomaria Patersonii â€” were scattered about the surface 
of the ground, intermiugled with tree-ferns of the genus Alsophila, 
besides Calanthe veratrifolia, and several other terrestrial Orchideae.
In a subsequent walk, the rock-lily, Dendrobium speciosum, was in 
]jk)Ssom on a rock, with a spike of white flowers, fading into yellow.
Other s])ecimens of the tree-nettle were measured, and found to be 
eighteen, twenty, and twenty-one feet in circumference.
These are 
739 
pi'obably the largest and most severe nettles in the world ; our author 
found the sting as painful as that of a wasp : the leaves are heart- 
shaped, and some of them six inches across : the stinging hairs are 
not the most numerous, and are readily distinguishable when held to 
the light bj^ the vesicule of poison at their base.
On the ascent of 
the Cambevvarra mountains, Dendrobium ruscifolium was observed 
in flower on the trees, and two smaller epiphytes on mossy logs 
nearer the top of the mountain.
In the neighbourhood of Goulburn are certain plants allied to 
those of England â€” such, for instance, as some species of Potamoge- 
ton and Villarsia â€” while others â€” as Typha latifolia and Myriophyllum 
verticillatum â€” are thought to be actually identical.
At Arthurslee, 
white clover, trefoil, a spinous-seeded medic, rib-grass, rye-grass, 
shepherd's purse, Erodium cicutarum and moschatum, and some other 
English jjlants, had established themselves, as is the case in many 
other parts of the colony ; they spread and thrive often more vigo- 
rously than in their native soil.
This fact leads us to the often mooted 
question of interchanging the productions of distant climes.
Where- 
fore should not we gladly receive the beautiful products of otlier re- 
gions, and adopt them as our own .?
More than a hundred of our 
British plants are perfectly naturalized in Australia, and we may 
fairly anticipate the day when Australia shall contribute her quota 
towards the Flora of Great Britain.
The mode of introduction mat- 
ters but little : at first it may be intentionally introduced into gardens 
with care and pains-taking, but in a few generations the plant may 
escape its destined boundary, the seeds may be conveyed by birds or 
scattered by the wind, and the produce may become so established 
that our endeavours to eradicate it would prove wholly fruitless.
After a voyage to Hobart Town, our traveller visited Port Adelaide, 
on the 30th of November, 1837 ; and we have the following sketches 
of its botanical productions.
"We walked about seven miles to Port Adelaide.
The way was over two level plains, 
separated Tjy a slight, sandy rise, covered with wood.
The soil of the plains was a 
reddish loam, having a slight admixture of sand and calcareous matter.
They were 
covered with tufted grass and small herhs.
Among the latter was a species of Eryn- 
gium, a foot high, the leaves of which are eaten with avidity by cattle, and some small 
yellow-flowered everlastings.
Near Port Adelaide, the land becomes saline, and pro- 
duces crimson Mesembryanthemums, of three species, along with numerous maritime 
shrubs.
On a sand-bank separating the plain from the salt marsh, which bo/ders the 
creek or inlet that forms the harbour, there are trees of a species of Callitris, resem- 
bling cypress.
These are here called pines, and have trunks about 40 feet higli, 
which are used for piles.
Casuarina quadrivalvis and Banksia australis likewise grow 
740 
lieve.
On this bank there vvas an Orobanche, very like Orobanche minor of England.
* * The salt marsh vvas covered with two species of Salicomia, one of which was 
shrubby ; interspersed among these were two species of Frankenia, one of which was 
bushy, about a foot high, and besprinkled with rosy, pink blossoms, the size of a sil- 
ver penny.
The creek was margined with mangrove, Avicennia tomentosa." â€” p.
510.
" A white-flowered Morna, a downy, drooping-flowered Pimelea, a broad and a 
narrow-leaved Xanthorrhoea, and several other striking plants, were growing in the 
forest on the red sandstone.
On the argillaceous hills, there was a shrub belonging 
to the GentiansE, with leaves resembling those of the greater periwinkle, and a Poma- 
derris, with pale leaves next to the heads of flowers.
Todea africana, Grammitis ru- 
toefolius, and some other ferns, were also here.
Upon the limestone hills were a broad- 
leaved Goodenia, an Orobanche, and Lobelia gibbosa : this last is a singular annual, 
flowering after its leaves have faded.
A considerable number of curious insects were 
feeding in a thicket on the blossoms of a Leptospermum." â€” p.
520.
Near Albany, in King George's Sound, several remarkable plants 
attracted our traveller's attention.
" Among these may be enumerated Kingia australis, which resembles a grass-tree, 
of about eight feet high, but difi'ers in its flower-stems and blossoms ; Sollya hetero- 
phylla, which produces elegant blue flowers, on a privet-like, half-climbing bush ; 
Anthocercis viscida, which fonns a large, bushy plant, with striking, white flowers, 
and grows close upon the beach ; and Cephalodea foUicularis, which has small, whitish 
flowers, on a stalk a foot and a half high, and which produces pitcher-like vessels 
among its leaves, at the base of the flower-stem : the pitchers have lids, are an inch 
deep, contain water, and often drowned insects, and are of very singular structure." 
p. 627.
On the route to Freeman tie, on New Year's Day, 1838, the Nuyt- 
sia floribunda is described as attaining a height of forty feet, and a 
circumference of six feet ; its top was crowned with a mass of golden, 
orange or yellow flowers : other beautiful flowers were in blossom, a 
yellow Calothrix, a yellow and red and a sky-blue Leschenaultia, a 
crimson linear-leaved Callistemon, a scarlet Melaleuca, a crimson Calo- 
thamnus, and several species of Jacksonia.
And here we must take our leave of ibis highly interesting volume.
Our quotations have been more copious, and our notice has extended 
to a greater length than we originally intended, but we trust that our 
readers will not object to it on these accounts, since we have presented 
them with a more complete sketch of the vegetation of these regions 
than has ever been given in so condensed a form.
With regard to 
the localities, we fear there may be some difficulty in following them 
without a map, since many of the names are but of yesterday, and 
none of them can lay claim to much antiquity.
In the present day, 
however, maps of these colonies are daily becoming more numerous 
and more correct, and these will furnish the means of tracing our 
traveller ihvonghout his arduous and philanthropic pilgrimage.

New locality for Saxifraga Hirculus.
I have taken the liber- 
ty of sending you a few specimens of the rare Saxifraga Hirculus from 
a new locality, which I discovered in September, 1840, on the West- 
moreland mountains.
The place where I found it growing very plen- 
tifully, is a marshy piece of ground about three and a half miles S.E.
from Crossfell mountain, about five miles N.W. from Caldron Snout, 
a waterfall already mentioned in your pages (Phytol.
74 and 113), and 
about a mile and a quarter S.W. from a shooting-box erected last year 
by the Earl of Thanet, at a place called Netherhearth.
The speci- 
mens enclosed were gathered in August, 1842, when I paid a second 
visit to the spot : at the same time, and about 200 or 250 yards to the 
north of it, I discovered Polemonium caeruleum growing upon a lime- 
stone rock.
I was very much surprised at meeting with the latter 
plant in such a wild and elevated situation, never having heard of its 
being found growing wild, even in more sheltered places, in this part 
of the country, but there cannot be the slightest doubt of its being in- 
digenous.

New locality for Melittis grandijlora.
The readers of your 
valuable periodical may be pleased to know that Melittis grandiflora 
has been found in a wood on the Cotswolds, four miles from Chelten- 
ham : this, I believe, is the most northern habitat yet known for this 
handsome plant.
It was found last year for the first time, in a wood 
called Puckham Scrubs, by Mr. Gordon, of this town : it occurs in 
several spots in the same wood.
In a boggy meadow near this, hun- 
dreds of the beautiful Parnassia palustris are now in bloom.

Note on an apparently utidescrihed Hieracium.
The plant 
I now enclose is not described by any writer on British plants.
I 
have it under the MS.
name of Hieracium Hypochoeroides.
The 
plant grows at Malham Cove, and other places in the neighbourhood 
of Settle (in Yorkshire).
You will find the plant mentioned by Smith 
742 
in ' English Flora,' (iii.
375), as Hypochoeris maculata : you will also 
find the same plant referred to the H.
maculata by the following 
authors, viz..
Withering, in his fifth edition, page 852 ; Watson, in 
his ' New Guide,' page 285 ; and Baines, in his ' Yorkshire Flora,' 
page 64.
It is now fourteen years since I examined this plant, and 
found it to belong to the genus Hieracium ; and as it is now upwards 
of thirty years since this error crept into our books on British plants, 
I should think it quite time for it to be corrected : there is no doubt 
of its being a species of Hieracium, and a plant which is not de- 
scribed by any writer on British Botany.
It may be described by 
continental botanists, and if it be, the name I have given to it will 
of course have to be given up, and the one adopted which had 
been given to it before.
The enclosed specimen is one of its most 
common forms : you will observe it is two-flowered ; it is rarely found 
with one flower.
At the first glance the plant has certainly a great 
resemblance to Hypochoeris maculata, but when subjected to a more 
minute examination it will be seen not to belong to that genus, â€” Saml.

Note on Plants apparently indigenous.
Since Sir William 
Jackson Hooker tells us (in the fifth edition of his ' British Flora,' 
Introduction, page viii.) that the " Martagon Lily and the American 
Touch-me-not can have no claim to be considered British plants," I 
^ould just ask Sir William seeing he has in that edition of ' British 
Flora,' inserted the Italian Rye-Grass without the asterisk to denote 
its being naturalized, or any of your readers, what claim that plant 
can have to a place in our Flora, since it has ^ot yet gone beyond 
the bounds of cultivation, and it is but a very short time since it was 
brought to this country ?
If I had found the Mimulus luteus on our 
list, I should not have been half so much surprised as I was to find 
that the Italian Rye-Grass had found its way into our Flora, for in- 
deed the Mimulus luteus has often been found where it might have 
been considered truly wild, had we not known from whence it came.
The following is an extract from a letter which I received from Mr.
John Gilbertson, of Preston, dated September 2, 1843.
"Perhaps 
you will be kind enough to inform me whether the monkey-plant, so 
much cultivated in our gardens, is a native of this country, at least 
if it is known to be so ?
I had the pleasure of finding it in gi-eat 
abundance a few weeks ago." We might mention a great many plants 
which has quite as much claim to a place in our Flora as the above 
Lolium can have.

Note on Cystopteris regia and C.
alpina.
At page 712 of 
743 
' The Phytologist,' I find the following question â€” " Are the plants 
published under the name of C.
regia and C.
alpina, in the Lanca- 
shire fera list (Phytol.
477), identical with the Lay ton plants ?
" In 
reply to this question, I would say that our plants, so far as my ob- 
servations have gone, are referrible to one species : if I were to 
consider them more than one species, the C.
regia of Smith and the 
Layton plant would not be the same, nor would either of them be the 
true C.
alpina : the C.
regia of Smith and the Layton plant are as 
distinct as any two forms 1 have seen.
I cannot at present give your 
correspondent any particulars concerning my Cystopteris, as most of 
them are now in the hands of Mr. Newman ; but if looked over 
there will be found a few specimens of the Layton plant, and one of 
Sir James Edward Smith's C.
regia, winch is from his own hands, 
and likewise a specimen of the Snowdon plant, which is from one of 
the parties mentioned by Smith ; and I think that if Mr. Newman 
looks over my Cystopteris (those from Broadbank and Cliviger) he 
will find amongst them plants that are not very unlike Smith's C.
regia, and others which are somewhat like the Layton plant, and 
perhaps a few others which are quite as distinct as any of the forms 
pointed out by Smith and others.

Note on Vaucheria terrestris, Protonema muscicola, S^c.
Having observed the Vaucheria terrestris, DC, to be almost con- 
stantly accompanied by the young state of some moss â€” probably 
Tortula unguiculata â€” 1 am inclined to think that this Alga is merely 
a young state of the moss, previous to the development of the stem 
and leaves.
This is confirmed by a remark of Hooker, in his fifth 
vol.
of the ' English Flora,' who says that Byssus velutina, L., must be 
excluded from the list of cryptogamic plants, as it has been observed 
to be a young state of one of the Polytricha.
This Byssus velutina 
is quoted by Vaucher, in his work on Confervas, as a synonyme of his 
Ectosperma terrestris, and this again is a synonyme of Vaucheria 
terrestris.
This would seem to prove that the genus Vaucheria is 
nothing more than a rudimentary state of various mosses.
Hedwig 
states that the sporules of mosses, in germinating, produce ramified, 
cylindrical, primordial leaves, of indeterminate number, and that 
these leaves are more permanent in Phascum serratum, &c., than in 
most mosses.
But the vaiious species of Vaucheria are said to bear 
fruit, and that they are reproduced by the ovoid vesicles observed in 
their ramifications.
1 do not think there will be any great difficulty 
in explaining this away, for we observe many cryptogamic plants 
which, when })artially developed, put on a totally dilferent appearance 
744 
from that of their full development, which only takes place under fa- 
vorable circumstances, and yet these partially developed states have a 
power of reproduction.
I imagine then that the Vaucherias are the 
rudimentary states of the mosses, and that the ovoid vesicles are ana- 
logous to granules, and reproduce the primordial state of the moss, 
which only developes perfect leaves and fruit under favorable circum- 
stances.
Again, I have never found Protonema muscicola, which is 
common on old stumps, unaccompanied by a Jungermannia ; and I 
have thought, from careful examination, that I could detect a connex- 
ion of the filaments, of which this Alga consists, within the base of 
the stem of the Jungermannia : if so, this Protonema will be the ana- 
logue of Vaucheria among mosses.
Protonema cryptarum is suspected 
by Agardh to be the young state of a Phascum.
There is a curious 
species which grows on the stems of Orthotrichi, â€” P.
Orthotrichi.
I 
suspect this to consist of aerial roots of the moss, which are some- 
times much more produced than at others.
I should like to have the 
opinions of more experienced cryptogamic botanists than myself on 
these points.
Before I close this note I would wish to remark that 
Thelephora cserulea, Schrad., among the Fuugi, and Mycinema phos- 
phoreum,y4^., among the Algae, of Hooker's 'English Flora,' are the 
same plant, and are both referred to Auricularia phosphorea.

Short Account of an Excursion to Tilgate Forest and the West 
Hoathly Rocks.
On Monday, August 21st, 1843, accompanied by 
three botanical friends, I made an excursion to the rocks at West 
Hoathly, and from thence to Tilgate Forest, starting from the Three 
Bridges station on the Brighton railway : our attention was first 
attracted to a large pool, by the side of the railway, and near the 
station, and although so recently excavated, it furnished us with 
many plants of interest ; among them were Centunculus minimus, 
Erythrsea pulchella, Scirpus setaceus, Juncus lampocarpus, Typha 
latifolia, Alisma Plantago, with several other aquatic plants : a short 
distance up the lane towards Worth, and near the pool, we collected 
Hypericum Androssemum, Blechnum boreale, Aspidium spinulosum, 
Rubus Koehleri and R.
macrophyllus.
We then proceeded to Turner's 
hill, distant about three miles : the lane through which we passed 
was very sandy ; the common hedge-plants here were Erythrsea 
Centaurea, Solidago Virgaurea, Aspidium Filix-mas, Calluna vulgaris, 
Erica cinerea, &c.
On the left hand bank, near Turner's Hill Gate, 
some very fine specimens of Asplenium Trichomanes were collected.
The rocks, which are about one mile from this spot (direct south), 
745 
are situate in a wood on the left hand side of the road, and form al- 
most a semicircle, terminating very abruptly, and being consj^icuous 
objects wherever they are freed from the thick underwood : upon 
these rocks flourishes, in great luxuriance, the beautiful Hjmeno- 
phyllum Tunbridgense, covering, in some instances, the entire face of 
the rock, but growing most vigorously in the crevices where the sun 
never penetrates.
After enjoying the delightful view from the summit 
of the highest rocks, where we observed Vaccinium Myrtillus and 
Convallaria majalis, in large patches, but not in flower, we turned 
our steps towards Tilgate Forest.
On reaching Turaer's Hill Gate, 
we took the left-hand road, which, after about three miles' ride, and 
finding Linum angustifolium in great plenty on a bank in the lane, 
brought us to " Starve- Mouse Plain," a swamp lying between Pease 
Pottage and the Brighton railway, where we commenced our re- 
searches, Exacum filiforme being the chief attraction, which we soon 
found, growing in the greatest profusion and of extraordinary size, 
some specimens measuring five inches in height and much branched : 
we also collected Lycopodium Selago, inundatura and clavatum, Nar- 
thecium ossifragrum, Eleocharis multicaulis, Hypericum elodes and 
humifusum, Scutellaria minor, Radiola Millegrana, Melica caerulea, 
Erica Tetralix with white flowers, and the elegant Campanula hede- 
racea, which abounds in this locality.
We then returned home, well 
pleased with our day's excursion and success, and not without the 
hope of revisiting the same spot another year, when we trust that 
others of our friends will join us, and participate in the enjoyment 
of such a delightful ramble.

Note on Lastrica spinulosa.
You are quite correct in what 
30U say (Phytol.
719) that Aspidium spinulosum of ' English Botany ' 
is only a young weak state of dilatatum : Mr. Mackay, who supplied 
the very specimen there figured, assured me so years ago.

Another word on Lastrcea spinulosa.
I hasten to correct an 
error in my former communication (Phytol.
719), wherein I expressed 
a belief that linearis is " the only distinguishing epithet the plant 
has ever received." I have since found that Roth was well acquainted 
with our plant, and described it very carefully under the name of Po- 
lystichum spinosum : our Lastraea dilatata is also most elaborately 
described SiS Polystichum mnltijlorum of the same author : the no- 
menclature of the species will therefore require careful investigation.

The names dilatata and spinulosa are apparently synonymous, and

Mr. Gihson^s query on Carex distans.
As no one has yet 
given a reply, I beg to make some remarks, in order that a question 
which the editor has thought worth insertion ( Phytol.
680 ) may 
not be altogether ban'en and unprofitable.
It certainly was not 
to be expected that a botanist who, by his frequent contributions to 
this journal, would be regarded as an adept in Carices, should find 
himself at fault in reference to the subject of his enquiry.
Perhaps 
the fact of his not having yet received an answer may be regarded by 
some as a proof of the great obscurity of the passage alluded to ; I, 
however, have formed a different conclusion.
Whenever the honest 
desire to acquire useful knowledge is the motive for putting a ques- 
tion, and then only, I think it the duty of every one who is able to 
do it to fiimish the desired information.
The querist, however, should 
endeavour to ask those who are most lil^ely to afford it.
In this case, 
I think the person who has remodelled the specific characters of C.
distans and the allied species, in the ' British Flora,' is most compe- 
tent to clear up the difficulty.
If Mr. Gibson cannot do it himself, 
and if he will assure me in the next Phytologist that he does not know 
the meaning of the writer in the passage alluded to, I will undertake 
to procure the desired information for him from the fountain head.
Of course my own conjectures on the subject, were I to express them, 
would be open to further question ; and remembering what Seneca 
says, " Many would attain knowledge if they did not fancy that they 
already had it," I shall make no pretensions to superior skill in a 
matter which seems so dark and difficult to the enquirer.

Note on Lathyrns Aphaca and other Plants in the vicinity 
of Halstead, Essex.
The rare and curious Lathyrus Aphaca occurs 
in several places in this immediate neighbourhood.
I have lately no- 
ticed it in what I imagine to be an unusual situation, viz.
near the 
edge of a pool in an old marl-pit, where it appeared to thrive remark- 
ably well, and is now ripening its seeds copiously.
A short distance 
from the same spot L.
Nissolia occurs, and is by no means an un- 
common plant here, confining itself however entirely to calcareous 
soils, and associating with such jilants as Trifolium ochroleucum and 
Senecio tenuifolius.
As interesting plants of this locality, in addition 
to the above, 1 may mention the following as having come under my 
own observation : â€” Ranuncidus hirsutus and parviflorus, Thlas])i ar- 
747 
vensc, Cardamine amara, Dianthus Armeria, Hypericum AndrosEemuni, 
Epilobium roseiim, Myriophyllum verticillatum, Sedum dasyphyllum, 
Chrysospleniuni alternilblium, Tragopogon porrifolius, Anthemis ar- 
vensis, Linaria spuria, A^eronica scutellata and Buxbaumii, Ophrys 
apifera, Carex vesicaria, and Alopecurus fulvus.

Localities for Villarsia Nymphceoides.
This rare plant, con- 
fined to a few spots of our island, occurs pretty abundantly in the 
river Thames, in the neighbourhood of Hampton Court and Hamp- 
ton, Middlesex.
The first locality that 1 shall mention is at the en- 
trance to the village of Sunbury, where the river is open to the road 
between that place and Hampton.
It occurs again in another spot, a 
field or two lower down the river ; and a third time near Hampton 
Court, where the river is open to the Hampton road.
A fourth loca- 
lity is a little above Kingston Bridge.
All of them are on the Mid- 
dlesex side of the Thames, and the plant, especially in the first three 
covers a considerable surface of the water.
The locality above King- 
ston bridge 1 have been acquainted with since the autumn of 1837- 
the others I discovered a few days since.
T have not had an oppor- 
tunity of verifying the locality at Walton, as mentioned in Smith's 
' English Flora.' â€” Jas. E.

Note on the Habits and mode of Growth of Villarsia Nym- 
phceoides, in the above localities.
The main root of the plant seems 
to be firmly fixed in the muddy bottom of the river, from whence it 
sends out numerous creeping stems of considerable length, from 
which arise the floating leaves, placed singly at considerable intervals, 
and furnished with a tuft of radicles at their point of junction.
When 
fully developed they are slightly sinuated, and wavy at their margins.
The flower stems, placed at irregular intervals along the creeping 
stem above-mentioned, are from one to three feet long, mostly desti- 
tute of leaves, excepting at the top, where they are collected into a 
kind of tuft, from which arise the flower buds in considerable num- 
bers.
The flowers, which float just above the surface of the water 
are extremely fugacious, the petals being thin and delicate, and only 
opening fully in the sunshine.
The plant, in all these localities, 
grows in quiet nooks of the river, where it floats, undisturbed by the 
current, and sheltered from the wind.

Note on Equisetum umbrosum.
As I read your article on 
Equisetum umbrosum (E.
Drummondii of British botanists) a few 
evenings since, within little more than a hundred yards of where the 
species grows, 1 resolved by the next post to send you some fresh- 
748 
gathered spechnens : this was done, and I hope they reached you in 
safety.
They are from the locality (Wolf-hill) in which the plant was 
first found in Ireland, by Mr. Thomas Drummond, for in this country, 
as well as in Scotland, he was the first botanist to notice it.
This he 
did when spending a day with me in botanizing the Belfast mountains, 
at the time that he was curator of our botanic garden.
For the bet- 
ter understanding of this interesting and little known species, I would 
suggest, if such be not already your intention, that another figure be 
given in ' The Phytologist.' The figures already published are very 
good, but the greater number of readers will, I apprehend, judging 
from them only, carry away the impression that the E.
umbrosum is a 
sparingly branched species compared with E.
sylvaticum, represented 
in a preceding page of ' The Phytologist, whereas, on the contrary, 
its foliage is still more dense and drooping.
True, in your descrip- 
tion of the barren stem, something like this is stated, but your figure, 
though admirably representing the plant when it begins to shoot in 
spring, gives no idea of it in its matured state.
On the steep banks 
of a mountain-stream, about a mile southward of the similar locality 
at Wolf-hill, I this summer remarked a few plants of E.
umbrosum.
In both places the plant grows almost exclusively on the side of the 
glen facing the north.
The first English name applied to this spe- 
cies â€” the blunt-topped â€” is expressive, as distinguishing it from the 
comparatively spiral E.
sylvaticum, the only British Equisetum to 
which it seems to me to bear even a general resemblance.

Note on Osmunda regalis, near Swansea, Glamorganshire.
I may just adduce, as illustrating the changes caused by cultivation, 
and showing that even within the bounds of a garden, plants may yet 
continue wild in their prison till they are semi-domesticated, and that 
therefore the vicinity, even if a garden, may not be always good 
ground for doubt that a plant is indigenous there, â€” the fact of Os- 
munda regalis now growing within a nursery garden at Cwm Gwynne, 
about a mile and a half from Swansea, towards Gower.
I went, in 
company with my friend Mr. James Buckraan, of Cheltenham, to see 
a nursery garden, some acres in extent, at Cwm Gwynne, which had 
been enclosed from the waste about five years, and is now in a high 
state of cultivation, with all the usual stock of a nurseryman and mar- 
ket gardener.
It was remarked to us by the lessee of the ground, that 
there was a boggy spot in the centre of the nursery, probably the best 
land, but which he had not yet brought under the spade.
Happen- 
ing to cross this place in our peregrinations, I thought I saw a variety 
749 
of Lastraea Filix-mas, not so common as many other ferns hereabouts, 
but when on the point of gathering it, to our surprise it proved to be 
the barren frond of Osmuuda regalis.
In the same boggy ground we 
noticed Pedicularis palustris, Viola palustris, &c.
Now, of course, 
the existence of the Osmunda here will depend upon the piece of 
boggy ground being drained or not.
Should it be neglected, as is not 
improbable, there being abundance of ground, the Osmunda and other 
bog-plants may remain for half a century, surrounded by cabbages, 
kidney -beans and onions.
I should say that the fronds of Osmunda 
were all barren.

' On tlie 
Influence of Light on the Growth of Plants,' by Mr. E.
Hunt.
â€” The peculiar influ- 
ence exerted upon the germination of seeds and the growth of the young plants by co- 
loured light, has been for some years the subject of the author's investigations.
The 
results show the surprising powers exerted by the more luminous rays in preventing 
germination, and in destroying the healthful vigour of the young plant.
Plants, when 
made to grow under the influence of the red rays, bend from the light as something 
to be avoided ; while the blue or chemical rays are efiicaceous in quickening the growth 
of plants.
Since the publication of the last Report, the author has tried plants of a 
great variety of kinds, and the same efi'ects have been produced.
It has, however, been 
found, that although blue light accelerates germination, and gives a healthful vigour 
to the young plant, its stimulating influences are too great to ensure a perfect growth.
The strength of the plant appears to be expended in the production of a beautiful deep 
green foliage ; and it is only by checking this tendency, by the substitution of a yel- 
low for a blue light, that the plant can be brought into its flowering and seeding state.
The etiolating influence of the green rays was observed upon, as well as the power 
which plants possessed of sending out shoots of a great length in search of that light 
which is essential to their vigour.
Section D.
â€” Zoology and Botany.
Dr. Lankester read a paper from Mr. Robert 
Milliken, on a supposed anomaly in the fructification of the violet.
Mr. Babinglon said that the author of the paper had described the appearances 
correctly, but had come to a wrong conclusion.
The fact was, that in Viola some 
flowers were later than others in appearing, and that the later ones were generally 
imperfect, not having any corolla.
The later flowers appearing without petals had 
misled Mr. Milliken to the supposition that these produced their fruit as the result of 
the flowering of the first flowers.
Prof.
E. Forbes stated that the absence of petals 
was a permanent state of some of the species of violet.
Mr. Mackay exhibited specimens of the Irish Saxifrages.
He called attention to 
the species resembling the London Pride {Saxifraga umhrosa), and with the specimens 
of the species he also exhibited several varieties of S.
Geum, S.
hirsuta, S.
h. polita, 
&c.
Mr. Babington remarked that Saxifraga was a difiicult genus to study.
TherÂ« 
were many specimens on the table, which, if they came from diff'erent countries, would 
750 
be naturally described as species, but which, as they were all gathered in Ireland, he 
had no hesitation in calling varieties.
It was no proof that a plant was a species be- 
cause it remained the same in cultivation for a great length of time, for many varieties 
did that.
He had paid great attention to the Saxifrages, and of those belonging to the 
London Pride tribe, he believed that only S.
umbrosa, elegans, Gemn, and hirsuta, were 
species.
The variety, S.
u. of Mr. Mackay, was not the London Pride of the Eng- 
lish gardens, which was identical with the London Pride of the Pyrenees.
Prof.
Forbes said, that the difference between botanists, with regard to species and varieties, 
could only be reconciled by ascertaining from each writer an estimate of the value he 
attached to particular characters.
For the want of this there was much confusion even 
in Botany, but the evil was much greater in Zoology.
The vague manner in which 
the characters of animals were drawn up by Britisb zoologists, was a constant cause 
of complaint among continental naturalists.
The Kev. W.
Hincks then called attention to two living specimens of Neottia gem- 
mipara of Smith.
This very rare plant had been discovered by Mr. J.
Drummond in a 
salt marsh near Castleton, Bearhaven, in the county of Cork, in 1810.
From an im- 
perfect specimen, Sir J.
E. Smith had described and figured it, and it had not been 
seen again till 1841, when it was re-found by Dr. Sharkey.
Only one specimen was 
again obtained, and it was with difficulty identified with the original specimen in the 
Linnean Herbarium in London.
Dr. Wood and Dr. Harvey had, during the past 
week, both gathered living specimens, which were now on the table.
The original 
plant was not a Neottia, as had been supposed by Smith, but was now referred to Spi- 
ranthes.
Mr. Babington stated, that he had carefully examined the plant on the ta- 
ble, and believed that is was a genuine Spiranthes.
It was a matter of great interest, 
as probably this plant was one of the rarest in the world.
There was no record of its 
having been found anywhere but in the locality from whence these specimens were 
brought.
Mr. Hincks stated, that among some Californian plants received in Lon- 
don, had been found what appeared to be a Spiranthes gemmipara.
Dr. Allman exhibited specimens of a Linaria which he had gathered in Ireland.
He believed it to be a new species, and had described it at a meeting of the Royal 
Irish Academy.
It had been supposed to be the Linaria Italica of Treviranus, which 
had also been found in England, but this plant differed in many respects from L.
Ita- 
lica.
Mr. Babington thought the plant of Dr. Allman differed from the English L.
Italica.
Should this Linaria be a new species, it will probably be new to the Europe- 
an Flora.
Dr. Allman stated that botanists in London had pronounced his plant a 
hybrid, and Mr. Mackay concurred in this opinion.
Dr. Allman then exhibited spe- 
cimens of the very rare Trichomanes speciosum, and also of one discovered by Mr.
Andrews of Dublin, which differed from it in many points, and which might probably 
turn out a new species.
The principal features of difference that this fern presented 
were, the possession of bipinnate fronds, long bristles, and the triangular form of its 
fronds : in all these points it differed from T.
speciosum.
Mr. Mackay had cultivated 
the plant in question since Mr. Andrews discovered it, and it was his conviction that 
it was a new species.

Dr. Pickells read a paper ' On 
the deleterious effects of (Enanthe Crocata.' â€” This plant, he observed, was known to 
be one of the [most] virulent poisons of the indigenous British Flora, but was stated 
to be veiy rare in Great Britain by Dr. Smith, in the letter-press of Sowerby's ' Eng- 
lish Botany ; ' this was by no means true as regarded Ireland, particularly in Cork, 
751 
and other southern counties, in which it grows in great abundance.
Dr. Pickells col- 
lected nearly thirty cases of death by eating the root, the quantity in one instance not 
exceeding " the top of the finger ; " he described the symptoms as exhibited in those 
cases, â€” insensibility, convulsions, locked jaw, delirium and insanity; and pointed out 
the proper mode of treating such cases, by detailing several which were cured by the 
exhibition of strong emetics, diffusible stimulants, enemata, &c.
He concluded by 
making some observations on the poisons used by the ancients in judicial executions; 
he thought this might have been the plant used to destroy Socrates, and not the Co- 
nium maculatum of modern Botany ; and from the symptom of insanity, he thought 
that this was the plant designated as the " iusane root'' by the poet.
This plant Dr.
Pickells stated to be equally injurious to black cattle and horses, as to man; he be- 
lieved there was no direct antidote known ; melted butter was given in some of the 
cases which recovered, and is popularly deemed a preservative against its effects.
The 
root is frequently used as a discutient external application to tumours, and many of 
the accidents have occurred by eating it, when gathered for this purpose.

Read, â€” "Observations on some Varieties of Hypna, and on a new species of Li- 
chen," by Dr. Thomas Taylor.
Local collections of Cryptogamic plants are instruc- 
tive in two ways, by contributing to our knowledge of the geographical distribution of 
the species, and by pointing out the directions which the characters of the varieties take 
when acted on by diversity of circumstances of external agencies.
The cryptogamic 
collection of Dr. G.
Watson, from the vicinity of Philadelphia, presented to the Bota- 
nical Society of London, elucidate in some particulars the foregoing remark ; not how- 
ever to a great extent, as the collector seems to have satisfied himself with gathering 
the largest and most prominent species, and to have omitted or overlooked the minuter 
and more inconspicuous kinds.
Yet what has been collected is far from being desti- 
tute of interest and value.
Thus he has remitted to liOndon a great profusion of Neckeracladorrhizans {Hed.) 
Now this moss was first described from Swiss specimens by Hedwig ; afterwards it was 
sent to this country from Nepal by Dr. Wallich, and from New York by Dr. Torrey ; 
finally we have it in the present collection from Philadelphia.
In Great Britain or Ireland, so fertile in mosses, it is totally unknown.
We may 
therefore conclude that this species is altogether continental ; although for the pre- 
sent we are unacquainted with those laws that deny to it an insular locality.
We have Hypnum salebrosum {Hoffm.) by its smaller size imposing upon us the 
form of a new species ; but although the branches are more compressed and shorter, 
* See p.
760.
752 â–  
the leaves soTnewhat narrower, the pedicels more slender, and the capsules soon turn- 
ing blaclc, yet in all essential characters it entirely agrees with our British species.
Hypnutn plumosum, (L.), with us assumes diversified forms, among which a re- 
markable one collected by the late Miss Hutchins, at GlengarifT, has all the leaves de- 
cidedly secund.
The variety gathered by Dr. Watson, has the upper leaves alone 
heteromallous ; but then its more erect and longer capsules, and the less concave but 
substriated leaves, claim the adjustment of the balance between species and variety by 
a practised hand.
Dr. Taylor considered it less hazardous for the present, to leave it 
in the latter rank.
But the impatient may say, when then are we to expect the means 
of exactly deciding ?
The answer is, perhaps not until some muscologist enjoys the 
privilege of seeing both growing in their native localities.
For there is much value 
in the character taken from the habit of a plant.
Many modem elevations of varieties 
to the rank of species have been first suggested by the silent appeal of the look of the 
growing individuals.
In Dr. Watson's state of Hypnum rutabulum (L.), a mark hi- 
therto considered essential to the species seems to be vanishing ; the pedicels exhibit 
scarcely any appearance of roughness immediately below the capsules : in all other 
particulars the Philadelphian and European mosses coincide.
But Mr. Wilson, whose 
observations on this tribe are always as original as acute, had long since taught Dr. T.
that the scabrous state of the pedicel in this species is liable to great variation ; inso- 
much that he seems disposed to doubt whether Hypnum vagans of Hooker, in Drum- 
mond's ' Musci Americana,' separated principally on account of the smoothness of the 
fruitstalks, be really distinct from Hypnum rutabulum, (L.) 
Among the very few lichens sent by Dr. Watson, is a species of Coenomyce, which 
may be considered new, and is called Coenomyce foliacea.
Its specific character may 
be thus given.
â€” " Podetia two inches high, loosely caespitose, dichotomously branched, 
the ultimate branches subulate, and tipped with brown ; the buds in flattened granu- 
lar pale green elevations of the cuticle, soon expanding into flat lobes, which are sub- 
pinnately branched and crenate, pale glaucous above, snow-white beneath, unaltered 
by moisture.
There are no apothecia present.'' 
The generic name is that of Acharius, which perhaps should not be abandoned but 
upon the clearest necessity.
The modern subdivision of the genus into Cladonia and 
Scyphophorus appears attended with no advantage, while the species of these two tribes 
are, by the confession of the adopters themselves, joined by links that appear insepara- 
ble from either set.
Indeed, on this question, the present plant is quite in point, hav- 
ing all the habit of Coenomyce Sparassa (Ach.), (Scyphophorus of Fee and DeCand.), 
with the attenuated and subulate branches of Cladonia of the same authors.
The buds of lichens have not received the consideration from botanists which their 
importance merits.
Hitherto the characters have been drawn from the thallus or from 
the apothecia alone : but the buds by which, for the most part, these plants are multi- 
plied, and which, if watched during development, present most remarkable features, 
should be hailed as a new and welcome element for specific distinctions.
In Coenomyce Sparassa {Ach.) the buds originate in coarse white granules, thickly 
set, and rising at once above the surface of the podetia ; in our plant they are flat, 
scarcely eminent above the cuticle of the podetia, pale glaucous green from the begin- 
ning, and not so densely crowded, nor do they expand into lobes so linear.
Another 
character may be taken from the branches of the podetia, which in the former are near- 
ly parallel and of equal thickness, except at the very summit, while in Coenomyce fo- 
liacea they are more gradually acuminated and divaricated above.

Having heard from ray friend Mr. Hanson, that the new Cuscuta 
was growing upon clover in this neighbourhood, I visited the field, 
and found several patches of it, varying from a few feet to between 
two and three yards in diameter.
Its general appearance cannot be 
better described than in the words of Professor Henslow.
It looks 
3t 
754 
like " fine closely- tangled wet cat-gut carelessly thrown down on the 
clover ; " it is of a pale reddish-brown or yellow colour, of a more ro- 
bust habit than Cuscuta Epithymum, but not so strong as C.
europaja 
and with fewer heads of flowers ; these are bracteated, sessile, white, 
with a spreading limb to the corolla, and give out a faint, fragrant 
odour; the stems upon which they are placed are frequently long, 
round and filiform, occasionally giving off lateral branches, the axils 
of which contain a few flower-buds, these ultimately increase and 
form heads.
The destruction caused by this plant is very great.
All the plants 
around which it clings are dead or dying ; pieces of clover, quite 
black and withered, as if scorched, may be obtained with the Cuscu- 
ta upon them in a flourishing condition.
It does not confine itself to 
clover, but seems to attack indiscriminately all the plants in its neigh- 
bourhood.
I have found it upon Prunella vulgaris, Triticum repens.
Polygonum aviculare, Plantago lanceolata, Sherardia arvensis, and 
even on Orobanche minor, thus affording an example of one parasite 
living upon another.
It seems especially to luxuriate upon Prunella 
vulgaris ; at least I have generally found several heads of flowers on 
that, when there have been scarcely any on the other plants, or on the 
clover in its neighbourhood, completely strangled by the Dodder.
The characters, drawn from the examination of numerous speci- 
mens, appear to me to be the following : â€” 
Clusters of flowers bracteated, sessile, approaching a globular form, 
the flowers in each cluster varying in number from two to twenty, the 
average number being about fifteen : tube of the corolla at first cy- 
lindrical, afterward,s becoming somewhat ventricose, scales palmate- 
ly cut, converging : calyx nearly or quite as long as the tube of the 
corolla, sepals white,* ovate-lanceolate, acute.
Being a true parasite, the Cuscuta derives its nourishment from the 
plants to which it clings, as soon as it has inserted its suckers ; and 
the mode in which this is accomplished is very interesting.
The 
stem has a degree of viscidity readily detected by plunging the hand 
among a quantity of it ; on withdrawing the hand, it will be found 
that the stems have a tendency to adhere to it, and probably it is thi& 
viscidity which at first enables the Cuscuta to attach itself to the clo- 
ver &c., until it has twined itself round the stem of other plants ; this 
it does by coiling itself round once or twice from left to right, or more 
frequently it makes several turns and then passes off to another stem, 
* Occasionally tinged with purple.
â€” Ed, 
755 
or to a leaf, for I have seen it send its suckers into the leaves of Tri- 
ticum repens and Plantago lanceolata, as well as those of the clover.
If we tear a small piece of the Cuscuta from off the stem of the clover 
to which it has attached itself, we shall observe some elliptical open- 
ings through which the teeth or processes [spongioles] of the Cuscuta 
have penetrated the structure of the ]:)lant, as in fig.
1, c.
If we make 
an exceedingly thin transverse section of the clover (fig.
2), with the 
dodder {h) uj^on it, and place it under the microscope, we shall then 
observe the dodder sending wedge-shaped processes (c in figs.
2, 3, 
and 4) into the stem of the clover ; these processes sometimes pene- 
trate through the layer of woody fibre [d) to the medullary sheath (e), 
at other times they can only be traced into the woody fibre, and very 
often they only enter the cellular tissue.
If we examine the long, 
unattached portions of the stem of the Cuscuta, we may see some of 
the wedge-shaped processes which have not penetrated any plant ; 
these consist of a number of oblong cells, arranged in the wedge form, 
their long axis being placed at right angles to that of the dodder, and 
uncovered by cuticle ; they are therefore admirably adapted both to 
penetrate and to absorb nourishment from the plants they attack.
I think it probable that the Cuscuta is chiefly nourished by the de- 
scending or elaborated sap, having met with many specimens of clo- 
ver which were more withered below than above ; if such be the case, 
the tight embrace of the dodder would act like a ligature, and thus, 
by retarding the flow of the descending sap, enable the dodder to ob- 
tain a greater supply of nourishment.
I believe there is little doubt that the clover from which I obtained 
my specimens was raised from foreign seed, therefore there is every 
probability that the Cuscuta was imported : it is most probably the 
plant alluded to by Mr. Babington in his ' Manual,' as the var.

Trifolii of Cuscuta Ej^ithymum.

Reigate, September 22, 1843.
[Mr. Wlieeler's interesting paper was accompanied by recent specimens of the Cus- 
cuta ; tliese are identical with others previously received from Mr. G.
S. Gibson, of 
Saffron Walden, who last year favoured us with a notice of the appearance of this de- 
structive parasite in that neighbourhood, (Phytol.
466).
Mr. Gibson has since obli- 
gingly forwarded recent specimens : the note which accompanied them will be found 
among our Varieties.
During the past summer a Cuscuta, with a very slender, white 
stem, made its appearance on young plants of a Cytisus, in the propagating-house of 
a Nurseryman and Florist, at St. John's Wood : the species could not be ascer- 
tained, as the parasite did not flower, but perished after destroying the Cytisus.
The 
following account of the habits and economy of these singular plants, we quote from 
a provincial paper, â€” Ed.l 
3t2 
756 
" New Agricultural Pest.
â€” Professor Henslow last week called attention to the si- 
lent but dangerous progress that is making by a new agricultural pest, the clover dod- 
der, which threatens to destroy the clover crop altogether in some places.
" The dodders are a singular race of true parasites, inhabiting all the temperate 
and warmer parts of the globe, distinguished by botanists into numerous species, but 
all having the same manner of growth and multiplication.
They are leafless annual 
plants, allied to the bindweeds [Convolvulaceae], and, like them, strangling whatever 
they lay hold of.
Their flowers, which are small, appear in balls on the stems, spee- 
dily form fruit, and end in producing each four seeds, about the size of a grain of mus- 
tard, within which is coiled up an embryo plant, looking like a miniature snake.
As 
the number of flowers in each ball is, in our common species, on an average, about fif- 
teen, it follows that every ball will furnish about sixty young plants â€” whence the ra- 
pid spread of such pests may be easily understood.
" As soon as the seed of the Dodder is ripe, it falls to the ground, and usually 
seems to lie dormant till the succeeding year ; sometimes, however, it is said to ger- 
minate immediately.
When the spring returns, the embryo sends one end down into 
the earth to form a root, while the other rises upwards, like a small white thread or 
worm.
At this time it is not a parasite, but seems to derive its food from the soil, like 
ordinary plants.
It cannot, however, do so long, but withers and perishes, unless it 
touches some living branch or stem.
If it succeed in doing so, it immediately seizes 
the live stem by means of a sucker, which is protruded from the point of contact; and 
then twining from left to right, and forming more suckers as it twines, it establishes 
itself on its victim, and ceases to have any further connexion with the soil.
From 
that time forward it is a true parasite, feeding on the juices of the plant it has seized 
upon.
After making a few turns round the branch, and securing itself firmly in its 
new position, it again lengthens, and catches hold of some other branch, when more 
suckers are protruded ; and thus it goes on â€” branching, and twining, and sucking, 
and branching again â€” until it forms that appearance which Prof.
Henslow well de- 
scribes as resembling ' fine, closely-entangled, wet catgut.' Now the dodder has a new 
and independent seat of life wherever it has twined round a branch ; and as it is in- 
cessantly twining and separating, and twining again, a single plant is speedily in the 
condition of a polype â€” so that if it be cut into a thousand pieces, each piece will imme- 
diately go on growing, as if nothing had happened to it.
Tearing the dodder in pieces 
then, so far from extirpating it, only multiplies the mischief, instead of an-estiug it.
" This short statement will show that it is a formidable enemy that has thus been 
unfortunately introduced to our fields ; and, as these things are not very nice in their 
food, it is not impossible that the clover dodder may next take a fancy to our wheat- 
fields, unless we can speedily put an end to its presence.
It is of little use to cut it in 
pieceg â€” it is of no use whatever to do so, if the fragments are left where they can catch 
hold of anything else.
" As it is only an annual, it would be killed if we could prevent its flowering; but 
that is difficult, because of its hiding itself among the lower branches of plants, where 
it cannot be seen : and a few heads of flowers will soon renew it in a succeeding year.
The right plan would be to dig up the clover where the dodder appears, so as to form 
a circle considerably beyond the patch apparently formed by it, and then to burn it in 
heaps; or, in cases where the entire field is infected by it, to sacrifice the whole crop, 
and burn it.
This may appear a violent remedy, but it is the only one likely to be ef- 
fectual ; and even tliis will fiiil, if (which is not yet the case, but soon will be) the dod- 
75' 
der is allowed to form its seeds : for they will fall on the grouiul, lie hid in the crevices, 
and reappear with the next crop, â€” when all the labour will have to be done over 
again." â€” The Ten Towns' Messenger, and General Advertiser : Saturday, September 
23, 1843.

â€” Rarer Plants observed at Westousuper-Mare.
By G.

I SEND a list of some of the rarer plants noticed at Weston-super- 
Mare, during a day's visit to that place in the summer of 1843.
Weston is a small but increasing bathing-place, pleasantly situated 
on the Bristol Channel, about eighteen miles from that city; and pos- 
sessing considerable diversity of soil and situation, is a locality fa- 
vourable to the growth of a variety of plants, some of which are pecu- 
liar to the vicinity of the sea, and others to hilly or woody districts.
Doubtless, in a longer stay, this list might have been considerebly 
enlarged.

â€” Remarks on Botanical Classification.
By Thomas Edmonston, Esq., jun.
Baltasound, Shetland Islands, 
September 25, 1843.
Sir, 
The subject of the best mode of botanical classifica- 
tioA is undoubtedly one not only of much interest, but of vital impor- 
tance to the science; and having for some time entertained the opinion 
that the present system of entirely dispensing with an introductory 
or " artificial " scheme, is not only wrong in theory, and opposed to 
* The differences existing between these plants seem to me too slight to constitute 
them separate species.
They both grow in considerable abundance at St. Lawrence, 
and I could discover very little distinction between specimens of each.
May not the 
trifling distinctions arise from differeuce of situation and other attendant circumstances ?

the principles of philosophical classification, but almost impracticable 
in practice ; â€” I have thrown together a few notes on this important 
topic, in the hope that some botanist will either demonstrate the fal- 
lacy of my opinions, or be led to reflect on the incompetence of the 
"natural" oy fashionable system to perform all that it promises.
With 
this view the insertion of the following remarks in your valuable jour- 
nal will oblige, Mr. Editor, 
Yours respectfully, 
Thos.
Edmonston, jun.
To the Editor of ' The Phytologist.' 
It has of late years become a favorite subject with naturalists, and 
especially with botanists, to cry down as unphilosophical and as un- 
adapted for the extended knowledge and comparatively mature obser- 
vations of the age, any system of classification which does not include 
in the definitions of its divisions a great mass of characters, but which 
assorts the objects of which it treats in groups distinguished from each 
other by one, or at least by few characteristics.
This seems to be the 
simple difference between the two kinds of classification, the " natu- 
ral " and the " artificial." 
The object of the present remarks is not so much to enter into the 
more general principles of classification, as to endeavour to demon- 
strate and illustrate the proposition, â€” That a simple arlificial scheme 
is absolutely necessary as an easy introduction to the study of the sci- 
ence, by which a sufficient knowledge of species may be gained to ena- 
ble the student to turn to the more complicated generalizations of the 
other system.
With this view it will tend to give my remarks more precision and 
individuality, if I take the two best systems constructed according to 
the principles of the two methods, namely, the Linnaean, almost uni- 
versally allowed to be the best artificial system, and the modification 
of Decandolle's system adopted by Professor Lindley in his ' Synop- 
sis,' which appears to be the best and most consistent of the natural 
methods, and the one in which its principles are seen to the greatest 
advantage, â€” as representatives of the respective modes of classifica- 
tion favoured by their authors.
It is a well-known fact, and one often quoted by the advocates of a 
natural scheme, that Linnaeus never intended his sexual system to su- 
persede a natural one, provided that should ever be discovered.
But 
as in the state of the science at the time he lived, and the compara- 
tively limited knowledge of vegetable structure he possessed, it was 
761 
not only impossible he could frame such a system, but also impossi- 
ble, had it been done, that the state of botanical knowledge would 
have allowed of its practical utility ; â€” the object of Linnaeus in pi'o- 
pounding his artificial system was to furnish botanists with a method 
of classification, simple and easily acquired, and which would be the 
great help to gaining the knowledge necessary for constructing and 
using a natural system : and what was then necessary for the state of 
botanical knowledge generally^ is, I contend, still indispensible to 
students individually.
To establish this position, it will be well to look first at a few of the 
general principles and uses of classification as applied to the two 
rival systems, and then glance at the advantages and imperfections 
of both- 
In the first place, then, as Nature creates only species, and as 
classes, orders, sections, genera, or by whatever names other group- 
ings than specific identity are termed, are merely contrivances for the 
greater facility of distinguishing and knowing species, I am at a loss 
to conceive the applicability of the term " natural," as applied to the 
systems of Jussieu, Decandolle, Lindley, &c.
; the appropriation of 
the term must be either without meaning, or it must proceed upon 
two hypotheses, both of which, I apprehend, it will be found some- 
what difiicult to establish, namely, that plants have been created upon 
a certain plan, and thrown by Nature into classes, orders, genera and 
species; and secondly, that this scheme of Nature is the same as some 
one or other of the natural systems : though these hypotheses may 
doubtless find supporters, I conceive it would be a waste of time to 
dispute them.
Let us hear Dr. Lindley on the affinities of plants.
In his very able 
* Key to Botany' (p.
40), he says, â€” " What we call the characters of 
plants are merely the signs by which we judge of affinity, and all the 
groups into which plants are thrown are in one sense artificial, inas- 
much as Nature recognises no such groups.''' I What then is a natu- 
ral system ?
If no system exists in nature, whence this misnomer ?
That no such system exists, is abundantly evident, and by Dr. Lind- 
ley's own showing too, yet botanists speak of it as a settled thing ; 
and, strange to say, every time such a system is propounded, it is always 
perfect, â€” no link is wanting to bind its parts into a harmonious whole, 
till some new facts or plants are discovered that derange the fair edi- 
fice, which has now to be reconstructed only again to be destroyed.
The first thing an unassisted student of Botany does, after gaining a 
knowledge of the rudiments of the science, such as the terminology &c..
762 
is, to endeavour, by means of descriptions, to ascertain the names 
of as many plants as possible ; I do not mean to say that the name is 
all he searches for, but that is and must be the first step â€” it is the 
root of his knowledge, and without it he cannot proceed one step fur- 
ther.
Here he finds the great benefit of classification ; instead of 
having the descriptions jumbled together in a promiscuous heap, he 
can, by the aid of a good system, soon comparatively isolate the plant 
he wishes to name, and eventually identify it with some one or other 
of the species.
By this means he begins to know plants, and puts 
in practice the technical knowledge he was before acquiring.
A fi- 
nished botanist has little or no need of classification.
Suppose a 
botanist knows at once all the plants of Britain, and c-an tell their 
distinctions, history and uses ; when he arrives at this point the utility 
of classification ceases ; he knows species as species â€” as separate 
individuals, and unconnected with their congeners ; and though sys- 
tem has been the great means of conducting him to this point, it is no 
longer of any use to him.
And were it possible that in like manner 
one could be familiar with all the plants on our planet, in the same 
way would the aids of system be dispensed with ; but as this pitch of 
perfection cannot be attained, and as we are always students â€” always 
have more to learn, so we can never lay aside the assistance of clas- 
sification.
Thus it evidently appears that the main use of classifica- 
tion is to assist us in the knowledge of species ; classification is the 
means of acquiring a science, â€” not the science itself.
Let us, by the 
means of system, learn the name of a plant, we have then many means 
of gaining the additional information, without which the mere name 
would be worth nothing.
This is, I think, only confining system 
within its proper limits, without in the least narrowing the sphere of 
its usefulness.
Without enlarging more on this head, which a little 
reflection will convince any one is and must be correct, let us now 
glance at the comparative merits of the two systems, as constituting 
an easy introduction to the knowledge of species.
There never has been a system which is not liable to exceptions ; 
and when species are classified in more than one set of groups, this 
would be nearly impossible, as the different sets of characters used to 
distinguish the various divisions cannot always be accordant.
A sys- 
tem in which the distinguishing characters are limited, is peculiarly 
liable to this objection ; yet notwithstanding the latitude of definition 
and the vagueness of distinction too common in the characters of na- 
tural groups, how many exceptions stare us in the face at the first 
glance !
We should imagine, considering the great outcry which has 
763 
been raised against the Linnsean system for this imperfection, that 
Nature's own system would be free from it : â€” no such thing !
We 
have three grand groups â€” Dicotyledons, Monocotyledons and Aco- 
tyledons â€” principally characterized, as their names indicate, by hav- 
ing respectively two, one, or no cotyledons ; but we have Acotyledo- 
nous plants among the Dicotyledons, as Cuscuta and Utricularia : 
Myrtaceae is an order of the same class, but some of the species have 
but one cotyledon.
Ceratophyllum and some Cruciferge and Boragi- 
neae have several seed-leaves, and some Gramineae, an order of Mo- 
nocotyledons, have two.
This shows that even the primary divisions 
of the natural system are liable to this objection.
Then how many 
anomalous genera are there shuffled and shifted about from this to 
that order, until, perchance, there must be a new creation of orders 
for their reception.
Again, look at the precision of the characters of 
the orders.
Let us take as an example of this quality the order Ra- 
nunculaceo!, as it is the first in the list, and quote (what are termed) 
its distinguishing characters, as they are given in Lindley's ' Synopsis.' 
" Sepals 3 â€” 6, sometimes confounded with the petals.
" Petals 5 â€” 15, hypogynous, distinct, occasionally deformed.
" Stamens indefinite, hypogynous ; anthers usually turned outwards.
" Carpels numerous, seated on a torus, one-celled, or partially united into a single 
many-celled pistil, one or more seeded.
" Fruit either consisting of dry achenia; or berries with one or more seeds; or fol- 
licles; or capsules.
" Seeds albuminous.
Embnjo minute.
Albumen corneous.
" Herbs or very rarely shrubs.
Leaves alternate or opposite â€” generally divided, 
with the petiole dilated and forming a sheath half clasping the stem.
Inflorescence 
variable." â€” Synopsis of the British Flora, ed.
2, p.
7. 
Is there a single definite character here ?
In the first place there 
may be either a perigone or the calyx and corolla blended together, 
as in Anemone, or a distinct calyx and corolla, as in Ranunculus ; 
nay, in some species of Clematis the corolla is altogether wanting.
The corolla may be regular or irregular, as in Ranunculus and Aco- 
nitum.
The stamens are indefinite ; the anthers introrse in Actaea 
and Paeonia, extrorse in the rest of the genera.
The carpels may be 
distinct, as in Ranunculus &c., or form a compound pistil, as in Ac- 
taea.
The seeds may be solitary or numerous; the fruit may be almost 
anything â€” pseudospermous, baccate, follicular or capsular.
Finally, 
concerning external characters and general appearance, the plants 
belonging to this order may be herbaceous or suffruticose ; the leaves 
may be simple or compound ; and the inflorescence is like almost all 
the rest â€” " variable." 
764 
These characters are something like those employed by the French 
ornithologist, M.
Vieillot, in defining his order Grallatores.
"Feet 
moderate or long, robust, or slender.
Legs half bare ; toes slit or 
webbed, sometimes margined, two before only â€” three before only â€” or 
three before and one behind ; pollex raised from the ground, or rest- 
ing upon it only by the tip, or reposing upon it in its whole length ; 
claws of various forms, not retractile ; bill of various shapes." !!
So 
much for a definite arrangement in Ornithology ; this is also termed 
a "natural" system.
My object in bringing forward these instances is neither to under- 
value the ability of the eminent authors of these systems, nor the uti- 
lity of well-constructed natural systems in their proper place ; but 
merely to show the very vague definitions which have crept into our 
modern classification, and the strange passages sometimes written 
when authors are determined to see nothing but some shadowy ab- 
straction, which cannot be reduced to practice.
I cannot understand what is sometimes meant by the term, a " na- 
tural group." It is said to be a group whose individuals agree in the 
greatest number of points ; and moreover, botanists will tell us that 
there is always a general resemblance among the members of a natu- 
ral group (as indeed there must be if they are alike in the majority of 
their characteristics) ; now Myosurus has but little resemblance to 
Ranunculus or Aconitum, and yet they all belong to Ranunculaceae : 
nor is Adoxa much like the ivy, yet both are classed in Araliaceae.
And if we examine the characters in detail, we shall find them as dis- 
similar as the general appearance ; in fact, "natural" resemblances 
have often no existence but in fancy.
In such divisions as Compo- 
sitee, CrucifersB, Graminese, MalvaceEe, Leguminosse, Labiatae, &c., 
the species of which are very nearly allied, the general resemblance is 
doubtless striking ; but let us not forget that these most generally 
belong to Linnsean classes, only differing in name from those of the 
natural scheme.
Notwithstanding Decandolle's advocacy of the Linnaean axiom â€” 
".Genus dabit characterem, sed non character genus," â€” it is chiefly 
his losing sight of this principle, which, though it may sometimes be 
canied too far, is generally an admirable rule, that has occasioned 
the introduction into his system of so many vague and useless cha- 
racters.
What Linnseus applies to genera, is equally applicable to 
natural orders ; but instead of endeavouring to find a common cha- 
racter or characters for the group to be established, it would almost 
sucm, in some instances, as if a description were written, a number 
765 
of plants thrown together under it, and when some of them did not 
agree with the definition, exception after exception were interlined, 
until a great part of it looks something very like nonsense.
It appears to me impossible that when the same characters are em- 
ployed to designate classes, orders, genera and species, that a distinct 
definition can ever be established.
It is undeniable that certain cha- 
racters are of ordinal, others of generic, and others again only of spe- 
cific importance ; and characters which in some plants may be used 
for the primary divisions, in others can only be employed for species.
Experience alone is the test of this ; and in consequence of this fluc- 
tuating importance of characteristic marks, it is impossible strictly to 
set apart such and such characters for such and such divisions ; de- 
spite this fact, however, it is well known that there may be certain 
rules laid down which may very generally be followed, subject to 
some exceptions.
And the tendency towards always employing the 
same marks of distinction for all groups, most inevitably leads to con- 
fusion and anarchy in any science.
When it is borne in mind that 
all the divisions are in every case arbitrary, and when one character 
cannot be obtained another must be sought for â€” the cause of this dif- 
ference of importance will be at once apparent.
Enough however on 
this head.
As it has been proved that all the divisions of botanists, 
under the names of classes, groups, alliances, orders, genera, sections 
&c.
have no existence in nature, it of course follows that any system 
has for its only ground of utility the facilitating of the knowledge of 
species ; thus in one view all systems are alike artificial, and the only 
test whereby to know which is the best, is to be found in their practi- 
cal utility.
I object to the " natural " system as the best means of acquiring a 
knowledge of species, for the following out of many reasons: â€” 
1. Because in this kind of system the principle of contrast or diag- 
nosis is not sufficiently kept in view.
A definition or specific charac- 
ter ought to embrace nothing but those points which distinguish the 
group it is defining from all others : instead of this being the case, 
the natural school substitutes cumbersome descriptions, containing 
little definite matter, in which differential characteristics are buried.
2. These differential characters themselves are often injudiciously 
chosen.
This is especially apparent when some rather obscure and 
not easily discernible characters, derived from the structure of the 
ovules and seed, are employed to distinguish principal groupings.
It 
is a rule that the characters of primary divisions ought always, when 
practicable, to be taken from some parts of the plant easily seen.) or 
766 
at least not requiring such delicate microscopical investigation as the 
natural system often requires.
The seed is, in my opinion, altogether 
too much used in the definitions of the natural school ; all the ana- 
lyses of natural orders are founded on the structure of this organ, and 
a student must be not only intimately acquainted with the variations 
of the seed â€” in itself a difficult branch â€” but must also have the faci- 
lities and knowledge necessary for extensive microscopic investigation, 
almost before he can cross the external boundaries.
Has every stu- 
dent the apparatus necessary for this object ?
And is not the neces- 
sity for it likely to perplex and disgn.st the student ?
3. The divisions are too much multiplied, and the differences be- 
tween them often too nice.
Many instances of this might be brought 
forward, for which we have not space at present.
At all events a too 
great multiplicity of subordinate divisions must perplex the beginner, 
and throw unnecessary difficulties in his way.
These are some of the reasons which induce me to think that the 
*' natural " system is not the one suited for initiating beginners into 
the science ; and I shall now shortly mention a few of the principal 
reasons why the Linnaean system appears to me preferable for this 
object.
No one attempts to deny the facility with which the Linnaean sys- 
tem is acquired, and the great simplicity of its structure as compared 
â€¢with the other method ; and the only controversy between the advo- 
cates of it and those of the natural scheme, is as to which is the^easi- 
est and most profitable in practice.
The points in which the Linnaean seems to me to surpass the'natural 
method, are the following : â€” 
There is nothing superfluous in the characters of the main groups : 
a distinct definition is established, and no diffuse details are allowed 
to interfere with the precision of this definition.
By reason of this 
we at once come to the essential part of the character, and have no 
trouble to hunt it out from among a number of common characters.
Again, these characters are drawn from parts of the plant very impor- 
tant in themselves, not liable to vary, and easily and at once recog- 
nized ; the primary divisions are comparatively few in number, and 
for the most part, in the same ratio the difficulty of ascertaining any 
plant we wish to know is diminished.
And finally, a very great de- 
cree of precision is unquestionably attained, by the employment of 
diffei-ent characteristics to define different groups.
The objections sometimes urged against the Linnaean system, ap- 
pear to me strangely unfounded.
On this head Dr. Lindley has the 
767 
following remarks.
" The student must be acquainted with the 
meaning of many technical terms ; he must have his plant in differ- 
ent states of growth ; he must i^rocure the fruit ; he must examine 
the interior of that part : in short he must go through a long and care- 
ful examination, which is entirely independent of the sexual system," 
Now if the sexual system set out with teaching Botany by intuition, 
so to speak, and dispensing with either the knowledge of technical 
terms or the examination of the parts of the plant, this criticism might 
be just ; but as it does not lay claim to these properties, I am at a loss 
to conceive its applicability.
At the same time with the above.
Dr.
Lindley goes on to say, " Now I distinctly assert that there is no dif- 
ficulty in determining the natural orders of plants greater than that 
of making out the genera by the Linnsean system ; in fact it is the 
very same thing, only with a different result : in the one case it leads 
to the mere discovery of a name, in the other to the knowledge of a 
great number of useful and interesting facts, independent of the name." 
Now if it be the case that the student must go through the same pro- 
cess â€” examine the same jjarts â€” in the one as in the other system, it 
will be singular if the amount of knowledge gained is not equal.
In 
fact the examination necessary for the knowing the genus and species 
of a plant, after you have got at its class and order by the Linnajan 
system, gives as great an amount of information concerning the plant 
itself, as if this end were attained by the natural system, with this dif- 
ference, that the information is far more easily acquired, and the pro- 
cess not nearly so complicated.
Botanists of the natural school thus blame the Linnaean system for 
compelling the student to examine the plant, which examination is 
the means of his gaining the great amount of information the natural 
system undertakes to teach, and then assert that the Linnaean student 
gains nothing but a name !
! It is a favourite theme of animadversion on 
the illustrious Swede and his followers, that their system teaches no- 
thing but names, and deals more in dry distinctions than in facts 
which lead to our more perfect knowledge of the subject: we will 
not retort on such critics that useless verbosities and aimless specu- 
lations constitute the main foundations of their system.
That the 
beautiful precision introduced into a previously chaotic science by the 
master mind of Linnaeus, had, when it fell into the hands of men of 
contracted minds, the effect of limiting the science more to the study 
of distinctions and of names than of facts and history, is not to be 
denied : but this is not the legitimate result of the Linnaean system ; 
768 
and its perversion, by men incapable of appreciating or using it, 
does not militate against the scheme itself.
In opposition to the experience of Professor Lindley, who " was 
driven to seek refuge in the natural system from the difficulties 
and inconsistencies of the Linnsean," we could proudly point to names 
the greatest in the annals of the science, who trode in the steps of the 
Upsal Professor, â€” to Thunberg and Solander, to Banks and Wood- 
ward, to Smith and Hooker, and hundreds of others, both in this and 
every other country, who, under the banner of Linnaeus, have been 
the principal means of raising Botany to her present station among 
the sciences.
The above are a few brief and meager notes on a very important 
and fruitful theme, and one on which I could have wished to enlarge 
more than my limits would permit.
I hope, at no very distant pe.riod, 
again to recur to it in another form, when my reasons for entertaining 
the views here expressed will be more fully illustrated ; but in the 
mean time if these remarks can only induce botanists to examine the 
merits of the two systems carefully and impartially for themselves, I 
am persuaded they will, in most instances, come to the same conclu- 
sion that I have done.

â€” Noiice of a vew British Calamintha, discovered 
in, the Isle of Wight.
By Wm. Arnold Bromfield, Esq., M.D.
I HAVE great pleasure in announcing, through your pages, the dis- 
covery by myself, on the 29th of August last, of a Calamintha, which 
will probably prove to be the true C.
officinalis of the continental bo- 
tanists, and is now in full flower.
It is in a beautiful and pictu- 
resquely wooded valley between Apes down and Rowledge, about 
three miles and a half from Newport towards Yarmouth in this island, 
that this fine addition to the Labiatae of Britain grows in the greatest 
profusion and luxuriance, and I have no doubt as truly indigenous as 
the common Origanum vulgare and Clinopodium that accompany it, 
and which it even surpasses in abundance.
Leaving Newport by the 
lower or southern A^armouth road through Carisbrooke and Calbourne, 
and a little before arriving at Swainston, the seat of my friend Sir Ri- 
chard Simeon, Bart., on whose estate the plant grows, you come to a 
farm house (Apes down) by the road side, and situated at the north- 
ern termination of the valley alluded to.
Nearly opposite this farm, 
709 
on the other side of the road, is a low meadow, in which Cyperus lon- 
gus may be found growing pretty plentifully, and flowering at the 
close of August and throughout September, if spared by the scythe, 
but it is neither so luxuriant nor so abundant as in another station 
near Niton, at the back of the island.
Passing through the farm-yard 
at Apes down, a road conducts to Rowledge, at the upper end of the 
valley, the sloping sides of which are clothed with thick woods inter- 
rupted by bands or strips of down, whilst the centre is occupied by 
corn-fields ; the soil is of a chalky nature, and full of loose angular 
stones.
In these woods, on the right or western side of the valley, 
ascending from Apes down, the Calamintha may be found, growing 
amongst the long herbage and under the shade of the bushes, in vast 
quantity, for a great part of the way towards the head of the vale, 
scattered over the hill-side copses wherever there is shade and shel- 
ter sufficient, but, unlike our common species of Calamintha, always 
avoiding open and exposed situations, or where there is not plenty of 
herbage and undergrowth, in which respects it resembles Melittis Me- 
lissophyllum, a plant which, though frequent immediately on crossing 
the Solent to the main land of Hampshire, I have hitherto been una- 
ble to detect in the Isle of Wight.
Our Calamintha is a highly beautiful plant, with flowers of a fine 
pale rose colour, spotted with purple or even blood-red : the corolla 
is nearly an inch long, and three times the length of the calyx.
Be- 
sides the vastly larger size of the flowers and leaves, which last are of 
a brighter green (pointed and much more closely and acutely serrated) 
than in the usual form of C.
officinalis ; the whole plant is taller, more 
slender and much less branched : the stems are lax, ascending or reclin- 
ing : the cymes (c^'mose verticils) fewer flowered ; the calyx coloured 
(purple), the teeth of the upper lip strongly recurved : the lower lip of 
the corolla is very broad, its lobes rounded, the middle one but little 
exceeding the two lateral ones in length, and separated from them by 
a very narrow and shallow emargination, hence appearing almost as 
one undivided lobe.
Calamintha officinalis is well known as a na- 
tive of rocky and shady subalpine woods in Switzerland, Camiola, 
and other parts of the South of Europe, and may well be found with 
us at a less considerable elevation, being probably one of those plants 
that, like Tamus communis, Briza minor, Gastridium lendigermn, and 
other species common here, have a tendency to migrate in a north- 
westerly direction towards their vanishing point.* No one who has 
* This is remarkably the case with the Irish Ericaceae â€” Arhutus Unedo, Erica 
3u 
seen our Calaminllia in the sequestered woods about Rowledge, can, 
I think, hesitate to pronounce it truly wild with us ; and I trust this 
notice of its discovery in the Isle of Wight, will, ere long, lead to its 
detection in other parts of the kingdom.
The flowering period, like 
that of our commoner species (likewise found in this island), appears 
to be August and September, perhaps continued into October.
Care must be taken, as I have before mentioned (Phytol.
131), not 
to confound Apes down with Apse farm and Apse castle, between 
Shanklin and Newchurch ; the latter probably had its designation 
from aspen trees, which in Vectian vernacular language are called apse.

Note on the new Cuscuta.
I enclose some specimens of the 
Cuscuta, gathered yesterday in a field of Sir J.
M. Adam's near Thax- 
ted, where it has destroyed a considerable quantity of clover, growing 
in circular patches of from four to twelve feet in diameter, killing the 
clover in the centre, and then spreading round to an indefinite extent.
It does not appear quite to agree with Babington's description, the 
limb of the corolla being spreading, as in C.
Epithymum, of which, 
perhaps, it will only prove a variety.

Note on Isnardia palustris.
I may mention that 1 collected, 
the last week in August, Isnardia palustris in reasonable abundance, 
in Mr. Borrer's new station at Brockenhurst, though not in flower : 
the locality brings this rare species within a iqw miles of our Isle of 
Wight shores.

The least troublesome method of drying Plants for the Her- 
barium.
That the art of drying plants is very little understood by 
the eollecting botanists of this country, is but too well shown by the 
wretched specimens sent to the Botanical Societies for distribution.
Yet nothing is more easy than the making of good specimens, by bo- 
tanists who have the opportunity of drying plants at home, or at any 
fixed locality.
I have tried various processes, in order to ascertain 
mediterranea and Menziesia polifolia, wLose chief seat is in the Pyrenees and moun- 
tains of the Asturias in Spain.
I find that Calamintha grandiflora occurs in Belgium, 
according to Lejoune, Fl. de Sp. 2me part.
p. 3.3.
771 
which is the least troublesome, consistently wilh a good condition of 
the specimens when dried, and have at last settled into the custom of 
putting an ample quantity of porous paper between the layers of spe- 
cimens, and not changing it until the specimens have become suffi- 
ciently dry to he taken out of press.
Frequent changing of paper, 
artificial application of heat, previous immersion in boiling water, and 
other recommended processes, ma}- be very useful in the preservation 
of particular species ; but they must unavoidably increase the perso- 
nal trouble, and consume the time of the botanist ; and that, too, 
without equivalent advantage in the case of at least ninety in the hun- 
dred of our native species.
Some practice is requisite to apportion 
the pressure to the resistance of the paper and plants, and on the suc- 
cess of this will materially depend the beauty of the specimens.
If 
too little pressure be applied, the specimens shrivel, and remain in- 
conveniently brittle.
If too much pressure Be used, the structure of 
parts is rendered less fit for after examination, and the colours are de- 
stroyed.
The quantity of paper to be introduced between the layers 
of specimens, will vary according to the nature of the plants and the 
thickness of the paper, itself.
In my own practice it ranges from 
half a quire to many quires of demy grey, common blotting-paper, or 
thick filtering-paper : grasses and ferns, for example, requiring much 
less paper than do the lilies and Chenopodiums.
The more common 
faults wdth botanists, are those of giving too little pressure, and using 
too small a quantity of paper; so that their specimens are both fra- 
gile and bad-coloured.
Heavier pressure would prevent fragility, â€” - 
more paper would preserve the colours.
I do not recommend my 
own custom as being productive of superexcellent specimens, but as 
productive of sufficiently good specimens at the smallest cost of time 
and trouble to the botanist.
And I cannot hesitate to add, after see- 
ing the specimens of scores of other botanists, that those dried by my 
simple and time-saving process, are considerably above the average 
in quality, as regards both the preservation of colour, and fitness for 
fastening on white paper.
In illustration, I have used the freedom to 
address to the Editor, a packet of specimens dried in 1841 and 1843 
without any change of papers.
They will show that the colours of 
the Orchis, primrose, cowslip, many blue flowers, and other plants 
which usually fail in this respect, may be well enough preserved with- 
out any greater trouble than that of putting the plants into paper when 
fresh, and taking them out when dried.

[The beautiful condition of the plants kindly forwarded by Mr. Watson, fully 
proves, what indeed we never doubted, the perfect adaptation of his plan to the pre- 
servation of botanical specimens.
Unfortunately, hovifever, it is only when stationary, 
either at home or in some fixed locality, that the botanist can avail himself of this 
method, unless he travel with a horse and cart, and a shop-full of paper, as we believe 
some of the Edinburgh parties are in the habit of doing in their summer excursions.
The poor pedestrian, with his comparatively scanty stock of paper strapped over his 
shoulders, must dry it whenever he can find an opportunity of doing so ; and these 
opportunities, as we have known to our sorrow, are often " few and far between," and 
sometimes do not occur until the plants collected on previous days are, so far as their 
beauty is concerned, completely spoiled.
Among the specimens sent by Mr. Watson, 
the whole of which are excellent, we were particularly pleased with the following : â€” 
Linum angustifolium, Cerasus avium and austera.
Orchis mascula.
Euphorbia amyg- 
daloides (a splendid specimen), and several Primulas, with the colour of the flower in 
all, except the Bardfield P.
elatior, most beautifully preserved.
Many of the plants 
sent were raised from seeds collected in the Azores ; several of these, as Arthrolobium 
ebracteatum, Polycarpon tetraphyllum and Lotus angustissimus, appear to be identical 
with British species.
We can specify no more than the above very small number of 
the (/ood things contained in Mr. Watson's packet, for which we beg him to accept 
our best thanks.

Shetland locality for Cynosurus echinatus.
It will perhaps 
interest the readers of ' The Phytologist,' to know that I have this 
year re-fonnd Cynosurus echinatus in Bressa, Shetland, about a hun- 
dred yards from where I found it in 1840.
I obtained only three 
rather small specimens ; but this fact proves the perseverance of the 
plant in the locality, and shows the propriety of reckoning it in the 
Scottish Flora.
If such a request be not considered presumptuous, 
might 1 mention, through the medium of your pages, that if any of 
your correspondents could furnish me with even the loan of a South 
of England specimen of C.
echinatus, it would be conferring a great 
obligation on me.
The Shetland specimens, both those collected at 
first and also now, differ much from my foreign specimens ; the latter 
are admirably and characteristically figured in Parnell's beautiful 
* Grasses of Scotland.' They differ from the Shetland form in having 
a much more dense roundish spike, which is covered with a somewhat 
hoary pubescence, totally absent from the Shetland specimens.
I 
should much like to see an English specimen of this interesting grass, 
to ascertain which form my plant agrees with.

ston's request ; we also should be much gratified by the receipt of a specimen from 
each of the localities discovered by these gentlemen.

Plants observed in the Vale of Calder.
Yesterday afternoon 
I had a ramble in the vale of the Calder, between Brighouse and Sow- 
erby bridge, a distance of about five miles.
The following is a list of 
the rarer plants which I gathered; if you think it will be interesting 
to any of your readers, it is at your service.
Lolium temulentum, ar- 
vense and multiflorum; â€” the last plant I found witli from two to six- 
teen flowers.
Bromus secalinus, var.
stricta ; the spikelets of this 
plant are always upright, not drooping, as in the common state.
Bro- 
mus arvensis ; this I found in three different places ; it appears to be 
not very uncommon in that part.
Cynosurus echinatus, Myosotis 
collina, Erysimum cheiranthoides, and Asperula arvensis.

Description of Aspidium recurvum.* The announcement of 
a new edition of your ' British Ferns ' induces me to trouble you with 
a remark, for which you may perhaps find room in ' The Phytologist.' 
In the 4th vol.
of the ' Magazine of Natural History,' under the head 
of " List of Rare Plants found in the neighbourhood of Penzance " 
(p.
162), I mentioned, among other things, Aspidium dilatatum, var.
recurvwn, not knowing how else to designate what I believed to be 
an undescribed British fern ; and in a note at the foot of the page I 
expressed an opinion to that effect.
Since the publication of that 
list, the fern has been noticed by several botanists, and recorded by 
yourself as a variety of dilatatum.
I am perfectly aware that dilata- 
tum is a most variable species, assuming as it does very different ap- 
pearances according to soil, situation, shade, moisture, &c.
Recur- 
vum is equally given (if!
may so say) to "ring the changes" on variety, 
but to a practised eye it is in all its forms readily distinguishable from 
every form of dilatatum.
And I now beg to say, that after close ob- 
servation of the fern in the neighbourhood of Penzance in the year 
1817, and on the Irish mountains some years previously, as well as 
from an intimate acquaintance with the plant in a cultivated state from 
that time to the present, I am confirmed in my original opinion, that 
the fern in question is a species distinct from dilatatum ; and as such 
I hope to see it noticed in your forthcoming new edition of ' British 
Ferns.' I may add, that in the above opinion I am borne out by that 
of the late Mr. James Dickson â€” no mean authority on such a subject 
â€” and by that of Mr. Drummond, formerly curator of the Cork gar- 
den.
1 believe this curled fern is sometimes known among botanists 
by the name of Aspidium spinulosura ; and, for all 1 know to the con- 
* In a ktlcr lo E.
Newman.
774 
trary, it may be identical with the spinulosum of continental writers ; 
but on that point I do not mean to express any opinion, being quite 
ignorant what the A.
spinulosum of the continent is.
But the fact is 
worth recording, and it may save botanists some trouble and perplex- 
ity to state, that the application of the specific name of spinulosum 
to a British fern â€” (first adopted, 1 believe, by Smith and Sowerby in 
'English Botany') originated in error; the fern so named and figured 
in 'English Botany' being nothing more than a young or starved spe- 
cimen of A.
dilatatum, as I was informed many years ago by Mr. Mac- 
kay, who supplied the very specimen described and figured in that 
work.
The fern called spinulosum by the late James Dickson, is 
quite different from recurvum, and is, I believe, generally considered 
as a small variety of dilatatum, although from the large form of the 
latter species it appears, at first sight, to be abundantly distinct, 
and ought, I think, to be so regarded.
I admit, however, that there 
do occur intermediate forms or varieties â€” "connecting links" they 
may be called â€” which, if dilatatum and spinulosum (Dickson) are 
regarded as two species, render it extremely difficult to draw the line 
of demarcation between them, and to say where the one ends and the 
other begins.

Locality for Epimedium alpimwi near Bristol.
About four- 
teen years ago, when in company with other gentlemen on a botaniz- 
ing excursion, I gathered Epimedium alpinum in Leigh wood, near 
Bristol.
At the time I made no note of the exact spot where the 
plant grew, and circumstances removed me from Bristol soon after- 
wards, when the pursuit of the science was interrupted for a long in- 
terval; but it was in the northern division of the wood, belonging to 
P. J.
Miles, Esq., that the plants were found.
Leigh w^ood is there 
coppice, which is cut in portions in rotation ; and it is probable ex- 
posure to sun and air may have destroyed the Epimedium for a time, 
and that it will re-appear as the coppice again grows and affords suit- 
able shade.
Since the period before mentioned I have not gathered 
a single specimen, but as the wood is a large tract, I may not have 
investigated the spot where the plant was originally found.
A speci- 
men gathered by myself is extant in the herbarium of G.
Rogers, Esq., 
of Bristol.
I cannot guess how the Epimedium was introduced into 
Leigh wood, which is natural coppice ; yet Mr. Babington considers 
the plant to have but slender claims to be ranked as a native.
Be 
this as it may, the present is the most southern habitat for this inte- 
resting plant, which has, up to this time, been considered as entirely 
775 
confined to the northern counties.

Note on the Weymouth locality of Vicia Icevigaia.
In refer- 
ence to Mr. G.
S. Gibson's list of the rarer plants observed by him 
at Weymouth during the present year (Phytol.
735), 1 beg leave to 
state that I was staying at Weymouth for a month in the autumn of 
the year 1837, and that I then most carefully examined the coast and 
Chesil bank for miles, in search of Vicia laevigata, but was wholly un- 
successful.
I am perfectly satisfied that it does not now exist in that 
locality.
I found most of the plants mentioned in Mr. Gibson's list, 
and also Vicia bithynica in hedges on the east side of the Backwater, 
but sparingly.

Surrey localities for Linaria spartea and Senebiera didyma.
About a month ago I observed numerous plants of Linaria spartea 
extending over a space of four hundred square yards, in a stubble 
field opposite the Walton station-house, on the south-western railway.
Though the plants had been cut down with the corn, many of them 
still produced flowering-branches from the lower part of the stems, 
and five hundred specimens might have been collected.
This ground 
was part of Walton heath before the formation of the railway, but has 
since been inclosed and brought under cultivation.
I had not previ- 
ously been on the exact spot where the Linaria was found, although 
I had crossed the heath on different occasions while the railway was 
in progress, without having observed any specimens of the plant; and 
T should deem it highly probable that the seeds had been introduced 
by some means within the last three or four years.
Senebiera didyma 
was found at West end, near Esher, by the side of the road which 
runs from Esher bridge to the Portsmouth road, on Winter downs ; 
there were a score or two plants of it, on a spot where I had seen gar- 
den refuse thrown a few years ago, and where I feel very confident 
the plant in question did not grow before the year 1840.
Both these 
species are likely enough to maintain their ground by seed, and on 
this account it appears desirable to put on record their appearance 
(probably quite recent) in these localities.
Three plants of the gar- 
den form of Hyoscyamus niger (?) with a clear yellow flower, destitute 
of black lines, were growing with the Senebiera.
I should add that 
the Linaria is the ornamental plant cultivated in gardens under the 
name of Antirrhinum sparteum ; but whether or not it is also identical 
with A.
junceura, I cannot say with certainty.

Succession Buds in the axilla of a single leaf.
In making a 
reference to a late No. of 'The Phytologist,' my eye rested acciden- 
tally upon Mr. W.
Wilson's note on the axillary buds of the common 
locust-tree (Phytol.
613).
There is no express statement in that note 
whether it was the plurality or the concealment of the buds that was 
deemed deserving of particular record ; but the language and note of 
admiration (" when lo !
instead of a solitaiy bud, no less than three 
were contained in the hollow base of each petiole ") would seem to 
imply the former.
Several garden plants produce a succession of 
buds from the axilla of the same leaf.
Some of the Fuchsias, for ex- 
ample, first produce a flower-bud from the axilla, and afterwards a 
leaf-bud developes into a shoot immediately above the peduncle of a 
flower; and above the base of this young shoot, in turn, the rudiment 
of another branch or leaf-bud may be observed.
So, also, two buds 
are produced for successive development into branches, at the axilla 
of a single leaf of Lophospermum erubescens.
In the vine, two buds 
are produced, side by side, in the axilla of a leaf ; one of them being 
commonly, though not invariably, developed into a shoot the first year.
As in the case of the locust-tree, the vine also rapidly produces a se- 
cond shoot from the same part of the stem, after its first shoots have 
been killed by spring frosts ; but perhaps this occurs only at those 
places where both the buds have remained dormant until the second 
year.â€” /(Z.; October 17, 1843.

Leaf -buds 'produced from Roots.
While on the subject of 
buds, I may add a note on a statement made in Dr. Lindley's ' Intro- 
duction to Botany,' p.
51.
It is curious to find, in a work so general- 
ly accurate, the statement of "roots being essentially characterized by 
the absence of buds." Yet it is a very common occurrence for shoots 
or suckers to be produced from the roots of trees, many yards distant 
from their stems, and connected with the stems only through the roots 
from which they grow.
In the roots of poplars, common horse-radish, 
and many other trees and herbs, the tendency to produce suckers is 
so strong, that they may be rapidly multiplied by cutting their roots 
into short lengths, which produce suckers and become distinct plants.
No doubt suckers are frequently nothing but shoots fr'om the base of 
the stem, which run some distance underground ; but in the cases 
above mentioned, the sucker grows directly from the true root.
Such 
suckers are buds developed into shoots under ground.
I should, 
however, observe that in another part of the same work, the author in 
some degree contradicts his first statement, while repeating it ; name- 
ly, " a root has no leaf-buds, unless indeed, as is sometimes the case, 
777 
it has the power of forming adventitious ones." It seem?
^o me, that 
we might just as correctly apply the term " adventitious " to the run- 
ners of a strawberry, as to the suckers from the roots of a poplar : the 
runner and the sucker are ordinary and natural modes of propagation.

Note on Car ex distans.
I trust you will allow me to assure 
Mr. Wilson, that when T make any enquiry, it is for the fur pose of 
gaining information, (Phytol.
746).
I do know that the stalk [scapus) 
is that part of a plant which elevates and supports the flower ; and I 
should expect that by the words " barren stalk " is meant that part of 
the stem which lies between the uppermost fertile spike and the bot- 
tom of the barren one; but after allowing this, I am at a loss to know 
what is to be understood by the sheathing bracteas of these stalks.
I am also at a loss to know the meaning of remodelling the specific 
characters of our Carices ; for if they have been once accurately de- 
scribed, I see no occasion for their characters being remodelled : but 
it appears to me that Mr. Wilson has always found himself at fault in 
making out the diflerence between Carex distans and C.
binervis (see 
* British Flora,' ed.
1, p.
396, and ed.
5, p.
430).
I do not pretend to 
have any superior skill .in discriminating our Carices, but I will- say 
that Carex distans may always be known from C.
binervis by the foi'm 
of the nut ; as see Mr. Leighton's very correct outline figures of that 
part.
If I were to remodel the description of C.
distans, it would 
stand as follows.
I should first place it in a section with C.
flava and 
pulla.
I make this arrangement, because the stigmas in these three 
plants are so variable, C.
pulla having from two to three, flava from 
two to four, and distans from three to five.
Carex distans.
I. â€” Bar- 
ren spike solitary, with obtiise scales.
Fertile spikes from two to four 
(rarely five), erect, with the peduncles inclosed about half way up by 
the sheathing bases of the foliaceous bracteas ; ligula opposite the 
leaves, blunt.
Perigynium oval, suddenly contracted and forming a 
narrow bifid beak, which is often toothed on its edges, ribbed, ribs 
equal, seven on each side, two on the margins: nut oblong, elliptical, 
equally attenuated at each end, the number of angles is from three to 
five, depending on the number of stigmas.
This will be found some- 
what at variance with Mr. Babington's description of C.
distans, the 
reason of which is that Mr. Babington has referred a plant to that 
species which I consider distinct.
It differs from C.
distans in hav- 
ing its perigynium much larger and much less distinctly ribbed, and 
not suddenly contracted, but regularly tapering to the bifid point.
The glumes of the fertile spikes in this plant are only about half the 
3 X 
778 
length of the perigynium : the fertile spikes are much shorter than in 
C. distans, and their peduncles quite inclosed in the sheaths of their 
bracteas.
This form grows inland on dry ground, as at Jackdaw 
crags, near Tadcaster, &c.
Perhaps it will be said by some that the 
occurrence of four stigmas in Carex distans is accidental ; in reply to 
this I would say that to me it appears not to be accidental, since I 
have the plant from several localities, in three different counties, and 
all the specimens have more or less of the perigynia in every one of 
the fertile spikes possessing four stigmas ; though it has been stated 
by a person who thinks himself no tyro among the Carices, that such 
a thing could not be in nature, as a Carex with four stigmas and a 
four-angled nut.
The specimen I now inclose is from Wallazey pool, 
Cheshire ; perhaps you will tell your readers how many stigmas it 
has.* I will conclude this note by saying, in reply to Mr. Wilson, 
that the passage alluded to (Phytol.
680) is somewhat obscure to me; 
and as I know nothing of any fountain-head, I shall feel obliged by 
an explanation.

392, Note on a new British Carex.
While on the subject of Cari- 
ces, perhaps I may be allowed to offer some remarks on a few other 
species of that genus.
The first I wish to notice is the plant which 
I mentioned some time ago (Phytol.
366), as a form of C.
teretiuscula, 
with fruit as in paniculata.
In August, 1842, this plant was given to 
me for Carex teretiuscula; in June, 1843, I had the same plant sent 
from Manchester under the name of C.
paradoxa : since that time I 
have examined the plant with great care, and my opinion now is that 
it is not a state of either of those species.
For my oAvn convenience 
I propose the following name : â€” Caeex Pseudo- paradoxa.
Spikes 
panicled, branches approximate : perigynium ovale, gibbous, acumi- 
nated into a serrulate bidentate beak, more or less plano-convex, with 
seven nerves on the convex side (three very slender in the middle and 
two strong ones on each side of them), the outer nerves, or those 
nearest the margins, being very short ; nut rhomboidal, narrowing 
from below the middle ; style enlarged at the base : stem three-an- 
gled, angles rough on the upper part : leaves narrow, rough on their 
edges.
This plant differs from C.
teretiuscula in having its spike 
more distinctly panicled, in its nut being narrowed upwards from be- 
* On examination of tlie specimen above alluded to, we find that many of the fer- 
tile florets have four stigmas, as Mr. Gibson has correctly -observed.
We have taken 
the liberty of omitting some remarks on the fifth edition of the ' British Flora,' since 
they are scarcely relevant to the question under consideration.
â€”Ed.
779 
low the middle, and in its style being thickened at the base : in C.
teretiuscula the style is not thickened at the base, and the nut is py- 
riform, naiTowing downwards from above the middle.
This plant 
grows in the neighbourhood of Manchester, but I am sorry to say T 
cannot give the exact locality, as that is a secret.
The same plant 
grows plentifully by the sides of Malham tarn, near Settle, in York- 
shire.
It is nearly allied to C.
paradoxa, which grows in Islington 
fields, near York, and is accurately described by Mr. Babington in 
his 'Manual,' (p.
337).
C. paradoxa may at once be distinguished 
from this plant by its perigynium, which is more gibbous, and has 
about nine nerves on the convex side and seven on the other.

Note on Carex hoenningliausiana and C.
axillaris.
The next 
I would notice are Carex axillaris and C.
boenninghausiana ; see 
Babington's 'Manual' (p.
339), Mr. Luxford's note (Phytol.
650), and 
Mr. Edmonston's list of Edinburgh plants (Id. 407 and 522).
This 
will, I think, be some excuse for my enquiry (Phytol.
263) ; and per- 
haps, after all, C.
axillaris may turn out to be a much rarer plant than 
was suspected.
The following short description I drew up from one 
of the specimens referred to by Mr. Luxford, while in my possession ; 
since that time Mr. Luxford has been kind enough to give me one of 
those specimens.
Carex ?
Spike three inches long ; spikelets 
ten in number, the two lowest compound and about an inch asunder, 
the remaining eight regularly decreasing in distance : lower bractea 
with a narrow ligula passing round the stem : leaves flat, about one- 
eighth of an inch in breadth, sheathing the stem at their base : stem 
eighteen inches high, with three rough angles : perigynium ovate, 
acuminate, serrulate nearly to the base, and very slightly bifid at the 
point: calyx-scales brown, with one strong nervure, more or less dis- 
continued below the point, which has broadly membranaceous edges.
The specimen is from Crichton castle, near Edinburgh, one of the 
stations given by Sir Wm. Hooker for C.
axillaris.
I have other spe- 
cimens of the same plant from Borthwick castle, near Edinburgh, ga- 
thered by Mr. Ainley of Bingley ; and others from the same locality.
I have also two fine specimens of this plant, which were given to me 
in 1834, without any name, but marked " Putney, near London;" 
this also is one of the stations given for C.
axillaris.
Perhaps many 
of the stations that are given for C.
axillaris would turn out to belong 
to this plant, if carefully examined.
The true C.
axillaris I have from 
the Edinburgh Botanic Garden, and from Southampton, and others 
from Over in Cheshire.
â€” Id.
394.
Note on Carex muricata.
The last Carex I shall notice at 
780 
present is C.
muvicata, as we have two very different plants passing 
under this name.
One of them grows in bogs and other like places, 
and has a fruit like Mr. Leighton's figure, marked Pentland hills ; 
the other form grows on dry ground, and is a much more slender 
plant, with narrower leaves, and a fruit more like Leighton's fig.
&. 
As these two forms do not well agree, it would perhaps be more con- 
venient to separate them, the smaller form being the same as the Ca- 
rex Hookeriana of the American botanists.
I think this step the 
more advisable, as this form will just stand between the larger or true 
muricata and divulsa.
The first or larger form grows at Weston bog, 
near Otley, and many other places in Yorkshire.
The second or 
smaller form I have from Reigate, given to me by Mr. Luxford ; and 
from Bingley, by Mr. Ainley.
I have other specimens from Scotland 
and many of the English counties ; my American specimens are from 
Mr. Nuttal.
Much might be said on the nomenclature of some others 
of our Carices, such as the distans of Withering, which is the speiro- 
stachya of Smith, and now the fulva of Hooker and others.

Birch Wine.
I have often drank a beautiful wine in this 
neighbourhood, sparkling like champagne, which is made without su- 
gar, water or spirit, being merely the sap of the birch-tree, boiled with 
honey and fermented with a little yeast.
The birch grows abundant- 
ly about Bucklebury near here, so that on the advance of spring these 
trees are tapped, and a hollow tube inserted into the hole, through 
which the sparkling sap flows drop by drop into a vessel placed be- 
low.
Fine weather is, of course, best for this operation.

List of Mosses found near Castle- Howard, Yorkshire.
I send 
for insertion in your valuable journal, a catalogue of mosses found 
within three miles of Castle-Howard.
To be more explicit, however 
with regard to the boundaries of the district, 1 may state that I have 
confined my observations entirely to those species found on the Earl 
of Carlisle's estate, the extreme points of which rarely extend beyond 
the distance specified above.
The same remarks will apply to my 
list of flowering plants (Phytol.
577), where I omitted to mention this 
important circumstance.
The list annexed below is the result of se- 
veral years' careful investigation, and I think will not only be consi- 
dered an interesting but a comprehensive one, in proportion to other 
districts of similar extent.
The extensive woods, many varieties of 
soil, &c.
may however, with some degree of probability, be taken into 
consideration, as circumstances favourable for the growth of this order

Note on the Second Flowering of a Horsechesnut Tree.
There 
is a fine horsechesnut tree standing in a garden at the corner of the 
.Lyndhurst road, in Peckham.
This tree is remarkable for a propen- 
sity to blossom early in the spring ; it is invariably the earliest in the 
neighbourhood, both as regards leaves and flowers, and is an object 
of admiration to our residents, as well as to the gentle race of citizens 
w'ho disport themselves in our atmosphere on Sundays, This year its 
leafy and flowery honours were nipped by an untimely frost ; they 
became brown and shrivelled, and the tree remained throughout the 
summer months a most unsightly object, while its more prudent neigh- 
bours were quite uninjured.
In September new buds made their ap- 
pearance, sent forth new leaves, and new spikes of beautiful flowers.
On the 1st of October the tree was clothed in a robe of bloom, and 
since then J have daily walked through the fallen flowers which strew 
the footway beneath its branches.

Read, a paper by Edwin J.
Quekett, Esq., on " An Instance of Monstrosity in a 
Moss." After some observations on the well-known fact that the several organs which 
constitute the flower and fruit of a plant are only modifications of leaves, and also on 
the formation of double flowers by the conversion of the parts of reproduction into 
petals, Mr. Quekett stated that although instances of these changes were extremely 
common m flowering plants, they are but rarely met with among those which arefloiv- 
erless ; still, however, they do occur sufiiciently often in the latter, to prove that the 
same law which operates in the former instances, u' taius aho in some of the higher 
784 
orders of flowerless plants, as in the case of certain ferns, in which minute leaves oc- 
casionally occupy the position of the sorus, or part appropriated to the organs of repro- 
duction.
Professor Liudley, in speaking of the mosses, suggests that the calyptra, the 
operculum, and peristomium may be nothing more than modifications of leaves ; and 
that even the theca itself may also be the distended apex of the stem.
No specimens 
of mosses, however, illustrating this identity of the organs of reproduction with those 
of nutrition, appear to have been observed, until Mr. Quekett discovered some which 
go far to prove that these minute organs are capable, under certain circumstances, of 
being converted into leaves, thus leaving but little doubt that modifications of leaves 
are here employed as in ferns and in the higher orders of plants, to constitute the parts 
concerned in the duty of reproduction.
The specimens were produced in the following manner.
Having placed some 
mosses, with the fructification in difTerent stages of development, in one of the close- 
glazed cases introduced by Mr. Ward, the author found that one of them (Tortula 
fallax), which, when it was placed in the box, exhibited every tendency to produce 
fruit, after a time lost every appearance of fruit advancing to maturation, a small tuft 
of leaves appearing in its place.
Upon examining the plant under the microscope, it 
was evident that it was furnished with the usual leaves at the base.
The seta existed 
of the usual brown colour, quite destitute of leaves; but in the place of the capsule, 
there was a continued elongation of the seta, of a green colour, bearing several leaves, 
which were also green, and varying in number from twelve to sixteen ; and the author 
considers it probable, that the elements of the modified leaves, which otherwise would 
have formed the capsule and peristome, had been so influenced and changed by the 
heat and moisture of the situation in which they had been placed, as to bring them in- 
to a state fitted apparently for the purposes of nutrition only, and not of reproduction.
This change he supposes to have been effected by the elongation of the columella, and 
the consequent carrying up of those leaves whose apices would, in the natural state, 
have formed the peiistome.
This variation from the ordinaiy structure of the parts of 
reproduction in a moss, appears, in his opinion, fully to bear out the observations of 
Professor Lindley before referred to, as to the identity of the calyptra, the operculum 
and the peristome with ordinary leaves : but it is not so clear that the theca is to be 
considered as the hollowed out apex of the stem.
On the contrary, Mr. Quekett's 
opinion was, that it is formed by the united edges of the carpellary leaves ; and he 
concluded by adducing some instances in other plants in corroboration of this sup- 
position.
Mr. Varley exhibited and described a new form of microscope, which was said to 
possess all the contrivances found requisite for any instrument ; and that many of the 
defects of other forms had been more or less obviated.
The principal novelty in this 
microscope was a stage composed of one plate, being made to move on the surface of 
a fixed plate by means of a lever : this arrangement being admirably adapted to watch 
the movements of living creatures when submitted to magnifying powers.
To effect 
this object, Mr. Varley had the moveable plate connected with the fixed one by guides 
furnished with ball and socket joints, which allowed it a perfect freedom of motion in 
all directions, of a smooth and uniform character.
Considerable ingenuity was dis- 
played in the several contrivances of this microscope, which was capable of having Mr.
Varley's Graphic Telescope applied, for the drawing of objects in the field of the mi- 
croscope.

â€” Notes of a Botanical Excursion in France, in the 
Summer of 1843.
By Joseph Woods, Esq., F.L.S.
My friend Mr. Janson and myself crossed from Brighton to Dieppe 
on the 13th of May, 1843.
On the following day we walked to Arques, 
about four miles distant, where there are the ruins of a noble old cas- 
tle, and a fine fragment of a church.
We walked along the valley 
and returned over the hills, without much botanical success.
Mespi- 
lus germanicaand Chaerophyllum sativum occur near houses, and are 
perhaps neither of them truly wild.
Arenaria tenuifolia, Erodium 
moschatum (in the village of Arques), Sambucus Kbulus and Fedia 
carinata, were the only plants that would be considered at all rare in 
England.
The latter is much more common on this side of the water 
than olitoria, which perhaps is a little later in its time of flowering.
The chalk peeps out here and there on the slopes of the hills, but is 
generally covered with a thick layer of clay and flint, or with some 
of the beds of the plastic clay.* 
In the ' Flore do la Normandie ' Pisum maritimum, Sedum dasy- 
phyllum and Veronica verua, are said to grow at Dieppe; I saw none 
of them.
Nothing is given at Arques, but the forest, abounding in 
beech trees, stretches a long way on the crest of the hills opposite to 
the castle, and ought to furnish something to the botanist.
I would 
hardly recommend him, however, to spend his time at Dieppe, if he 
meditate a more extensive excursion.
* On returning to Dieppe at the end of August, I crossed the river at Dieppe, and 
walked by St. Martin to the forest of Arques, returning through Arques.
This length- 
ens the walk, but gives a pleasing variety.
We coast at first a salt marsh, but I saw 
there no rarity.
Cirsium oleraceum grows at St. Martin.
On the chalky banks at the 
edge of the forest, and also at Arques, I observed, very unexpectedly, Parnassia palus- 
tris.
A Gentian, which I at first took for a large-flowered variety of Gentiana Ama- 
rella, but which I now believe is G.
geniianica, grows on the chalk, G.
campestris on 
the plastic clay.
Daucus hispidus of DeCandolle is common, but it is the same plant 
which we find on the chalky coasts of Kent and Sussex.
The vegetation about Dieppe 
is very like that of the opposite coast, and has noue of the plants which give so marked 
a difference to the Botany of the neighbourhood of Paris.

On the IStli we proceeded to Rouen by a diligence, which took us 
there in four hours and a half: some years ago this journey occupied 
seven hours.
The rain almost confined us to the city for that and the 
two following days.
Bromus tectorum and Linaria supina are com- 
mon on the walls, and on the slopes of the hills there is abundance 
of Sesleria cserulea.
It is curious to see a plant which is common on 
the limestone of the north of England, but which does not occur on 
our chalk hills, so plentiful in such a situation.
Barkhausia taraxa- 
cifolia is plentiful on the hill meadows.
Two forms of Polygala oc- 
cur on these hills ; one, which is the P.
amara of the ' Flore de la 
Normandie,' P.
amarella of Cosson et Germain, ^Plantes Critiques des 
Environs de Paris,' forms a rosette of larger leaves at the base of the 
flowering branch.
This rosette, however, consists only in an approx- 
imation of a certain number of the leaves, and takes place in a greater 
or less degree, so that we sometimes find it difficult to decide whether 
it exists or not.
On the 18th Mr. Janson was obliged to leave me, and I walked, af- 
ter his departure, to the woods and chalky banks beyond Canteleu.
The forest of Roumare here stretches over the wide summit of a range 
of hills, generally on a soil of flint and clay ; and offered to me Mes- 
pilus germanica, Monotropa Hypopitys, Colchicum officinale, Melittis 
Melissophyllum, Convallaria multiflora and Viola lactea.
On the im- 
mediate crest of the hills, where the soil is almost wholly composed 
of flints, I observed Cornus mascula, Prunus Mahaleb, Aquilegia vul- 
garis, Helleborus fcEtidus and Convallaria Polygonatum.
Upon the 
rough chalky banks below the wood, grow Verbascum Blattaria, Teu- 
crium Chamaedrys and Veronica Teucrium, whose compact masses of 
bright blue flowers render it a much more conspicuous plant than V.
Chamaedrys.
Here also we meet with Anemone Pulsatilla, Euphorbia 
Gerardiana, Globularia communis, Satyrium hircinum and Orchis fus- 
ca.
I had expected to find several of the Orchises allied to this latter 
species in the neighbourhood of Rouen, and I was desirous of observ- 
ing the variations in the form of the lip; in this walk, however, I met 
only with O.
fusca, and that but in one spot.
They ajipear to grow 
in patches of small extent, which are scattered here and there in or 
below the woods, and a botanist who does not hit exactly upon the 
place, may be within a hundred yards of a considerable number of 
them without being aware of it.
I have given (Phytol 789) an outline 
of the three principal forms which occurred to me, in the lip of Orchis 
fusca ; the narrowest I believe to be the O.
militaris, and O.
galeata 
787 
of the Parisian botanists; Koch's O.
militaris is probably the same as 
that of the ' Suppl.
to Eng. Bot.' t.
2675.
O. variegata has been said 
to have been found near Rouen, but this appears to be erroneous.
Other plants which I observed in this walk were Lithospermum pur- 
pureo-caeruleum, in a lane below the church at Canteleu ; Fedia ca- 
rinata, Linaria supina, Bromus tectorum and Geranium rotundifolium, 
almost everywhere.
Sedum album was not unfrequent on the walls, 
and Aristolochia Clematitis by the side of the lower road from Rouen 
to Canteleu.
In all this walk the scenery is delightful, commanding 
the valley of the Seine, and a rich variety of wood and cultivation, â€” 
fertile plains, and steep and broken banks, and the Seine winding 
among them and giving life and spirit to the whole.
On the 19th I went in an omnibus to Damethal, a manufacturing 
town about a league from Rouen.
These omnibuses, or gondoles as 
they are here called, run every half hour.
Two valleys unite at the 
lower part of the town ; I took that to the right, and then ascended 
the hills on the left, where, on some rough uncultivated ground below 
the woods, I had on a former occasion, in company with my friend T.
Corbyn Janson, found abundance of Orchis odoratissima.
It is a late 
Orchis, closely resembling O.
conopsea in its general appearance, and 
this time I failed to identify it.
Hereabouts, too, I think we found 
Stachys alpina : Anemone Pulsatilla and Stachys recta are very abun- 
dant.
Tilia parvifolia, Pyrus torminalis and Mespilus germanica are 
found in the woods, but the two latter seem rather shy of flowerino-.
Luzula Forsteri grows here, almost to the exclusion of L.
pilosa ; Phy- 
teuma spicatum and Convallaria majalis are in considerable abundance.
Passing through these woods, and a cultivated tract through which 
runs the road to Gournay, I again entered the forests, and, in a hollow 
found a large plot of intermixed Orchis fusca and O.
militaris.
When I 
speak of O.
militaris, I mean a plant with pale purplish-grey acumi- 
nate sepals, like those of O.
Simia, but with a broader lip, which is 
always rough with little tufts of short purple hairs.
I have sketched 
(fig.
4, 5, 6, p.
789) some of the lips of the O.
militaris here found, one 
of which is very remarkable, as the two upper lobes, the arms of the 
monkey, are entirely wanting.
On the same bank grew Euphorbia 
dulcis and Cineraria integrifolia, which here, drawn up in the woods 
has an appearance very different from that which it assumes upon the 
downs of Sussex.
On the recommendation of M.
Pouchet, Professor of Botany, I went 
on Saturday to the hills rising from the Seine above Rouen.
I did 
not go far enough to reach the Rocks of St. Adrien, which are chalk 
3y2 
788 
cliffs, and the station of some very rare plants.
The steep slopes in 
this direction seem to be the driest of any about Rouen, and they are 
everywhere open and accessible.
T here added to my list Iberis ama- 
ra, Eryngimn campestre, Caacalis daucoides, Ophrys apifera and ara- 
nifera.
Orchis viridis and Epipactis grandiflora.
In a little wood on the right hand side of the ascent to Belboeuf, 
there was a considerable quantity of Orchis fusca.
Digitalis lutea I 
had seen in the walk at Canteleu, but till I here saw some of the dead 
flower-stalks of last year, I did not comprehend what it was.
Rosa 
sepium is common on the chalky banks : it is very glandular and fra- 
grant, but I could not find any mixture of setae among the prickles.
Helianthemum marifolium makes some of the driest banks quite splen- 
did with its brilliant flowers.
This is at least the H.
marifolium of 
the 'Flore de la Normandie,' but I give it on the authority of Mr. Gay 
that the French species described under that name is universally H.
canum, H.
marifolium being a Spanish plant, which is not found in 
France, nor perhaps in Italy.
Calendula arvensis grows on some of 
the driest slopes â€” a hint perhaps that the vine would succeed there, 
as they are almost inseparable companions.
On the 22nd I went to Maromme, but I ought to have proceeded 
to Malonnaise, where there are some promising banks and woods, and 
to which place there is an omnibus every morning at 7.
The clerks 
and employes at the manufactories about Rouen reverse the London 
practice, and after spending the day in the surrounding villages, re- 
turn to the city to sleep.
These omnibuses are numerous at Rouen, 
and besides a steam-packet for Havre, there is a spacious one for La 
Bouille, a few leagues down the Seine, and a smaller one up the ri- 
ver to Paris.
We may now add the rail-road, on which the botanist 
might go to Tourville, and return on foot by the banks and woods of 
St. Adrien as far as Mivoie, where at 5 o'clock he would find a gon- 
dole for Rouen.
There are two or three places down the Seine where there are turf- 
bogs, and a considerable one near Jumiege is said to be rich in plants ; 
but a wet May is not tempting for bog Botany.
After my walk to Maromme I got on to the railroad at 3 o'clock, 
and arrived at Mantes at half-past 5.* The hills here are less high 
* Vernon would be a better place to stop at, but I did not know tbis at tbe time.
On my return I did stop there, but I was still lame from tbe effects of a fall in tbe fo- 
rest of Fontainebleau, and could not walk far.
However, I managed to ascend tbe 
hill of St. Catherine, on the north side of tbe Seine, where I observed Teucrium mon- 
tanuur, Ononis Columnfe and Astragalus monspeliensis.
789 
and less bold than at Ronen, and the little patches of varied cnltiva- 
tion on their slopes look like strips of carpet.
The hills to the north 
of the river are said to yield the best Botany ; I unfortunately took a 
different direction.
I noticed Melampyrum arvense and cristatura, 
both now in flower ; Ajuga Chama^pitys and genevensis, Astragalus 
glycyphyllos, Hypericum montanura, Alyssura calycinum, Camelina 
sativa and Quercus pubescens (the segments of the leaves are narrower 
and deeper than in Q.
sessiliflora).
Verbascum pulverulentuiu and 
Salvia pratensis become now exceedingly common.
Muscari como- 
sum is also abundant, but M.
racemosum seems to be already over.
Fumaria V^aillantii, Iberis araara, Herniaria glabra, Thlaspi perfolia- 
tum, Tiiticum Nardus, Poa bulbosa, Potentilla verna, Orchis fusca, 
Ophrys apifera, and Prunus Mahaleb also occur.
In the Bois de la 
Butte verde, besides many plants usually found in a sandy soil, I 
noticed Tillaea muscosa; and in a clayey bottom, hardly more than a

league from Mantes, Orchis militaris (fig.

Simia (fig.

Fig. 7 seems to approach the nearest to the figure in ' English Bota- 
ny,' (t.
2675) ; O.
tephrosanthos of that work (t.
1873, the O.
niacra of 
Lindley), I should say is most like fig.
11 hereafter to be noticed, but 
790 
which I am disposed to consider a variety of O.
Simia.
I may here 
observe that Bicheno refers this figure to O.
militaris, and not to his 
tephrosanthos.
In the specimens of O.
Simia the lip was in general 
quite smooth, but in some there were a few small tufts of red hairs at 
the base.
I should characterise the three species thus : â€” 
O.fiisca.
Sepals rather obtuse, connivent, united at the base.
Lip 
pinnately 4-lobed, with an intermediate point, rough with tufts 
of red hairs ; lower lobes broader and shorter than the upper.
Bracts minute.
O. militaris.
Sepals acuminate, connivent, united at the base.
Lip 
pinnately 4-lobed, with an intermediate point, rough with tufts 
of red hairs ; lower lobes broader and shorter than the upper.
Bracts minute.
O. Simia.
Sepals acuminate, connivent, united at the base.
Lip 
pinnately 4-lobed, with an intermediate point, generally quite 
smooth ; all the lobes linear and similar.
Bracts minute.
Lindley, and after him Hooker and Babington, say that the English 
plant is not the O.
tephrosanthos of Villars.
Villars says of his plant 
that it is more like Ophrys anthropophora than like an Orchis, I sup- 
pose he means in this comparison to except the spur.
I know of no 
plant to which such an observation would apply, nor can I under- 
stand his Orchis militaris, where the " thighs " are longer as well as 
broader than the arms.
The three other species of this division of 
the genus â€” O.
longibracteata, O.
undulatifolia and O.
variegata, have 
bracts longer than the germen.
I went from Mantes to Houdan, in hopes of getting a ramble in 
the forest of Rambouillet, which advances to within a league of that 
place ; but the rain, if it did not absolutely hinder, very much limited 
my exertions.
One does not like to wade mid-leg in the water merely 
to see whether a place looks promising, though one would not mind 
doing it for a rare plant in view : even the wet bushes appal us when 
in a state of uncertainty.
My plants were Knappia minima, Agrostis 
setacea, Alopecurus bulbosus, Hypochoeris glabra, Mentha rotundifo- 
lia, Hieracium Auricula, Tragopogon pratense, with the rays nearly 
twice as long as the calyx ; Seseli montanum, Adonis aestivalis, Ge- 
nista pilosa, Scorzonera humilis, Myosurus minimus, Veronica verna 
and Cirsium anglicum of DeCandolle; how far C.
bulbosum and C.
pratensis of the same author are distinct from this plant, may admit 
of question.
791 
The accommodations at Houdan (les Trois Fils d'Amon) are not very 
good, but the greatest defect was the want of attention.
I had on 
my arrival a long while to wait in the kitchen before I could even get 
an answer to a question, and still longer before I could get ray lug- 
gage taken up stairs : and when T came away, the servant was, with 
great difficulty, induced to bring my trunk down stairs, but left it at 
bottom, with " Voila votre malle, Monsieur," and would not bring it 
any further.
I had been assured at Mantes that I should find at Houdan con- 
veyances for Rambouillet and for Chartres : I found neither, and there- 
fore took my place in the evening for Dreux.
The best hotel â€” the 
Paradis â€” was full, and I took up my quarters at the Saumon, which 
is not bad.
The next day, May 25, I walked to the forest of Dreux, 
which offers some fine chalky banks tow^ards the Eure, but internally 
is an unproductive plateau.
Here again I saw Orchis fusca, which 
is evidently the most common of the tribe ; O.
hircina was abundant.
The other plants were : â€” 
Anchusa italica Peuceclanum Oreoselinum Sileue nutans 
Pulmonaria anguslifolia P.
parisiense Holosteum umliellatuni 
Salvia Sclarea Isatis tinctoria Sambncus Ebulus 
Orobanche cruenta Sisymbrium Iiio Gnaphalium arvense 
Crepis biennis 
Helianthemum pulverulentum was abundant and in great beauty : 
this seems to me hardly distinct from H.
apenninum, nor do I know 
how to separate it from H.
polifolium, at least my specimens of H.
polifolium from Brean down seem in all respects the same plant.
After my walk I went to look at the new chapel which the King is now 
building as a mausoleum for himself and his family.
With some 
beautiful bits of Gothic and a splendid general effect, it is neverthe- 
less the strangest thing which can be imagined, and much more 
whimsical than beautiful.
At 6 o'clock the next morning I set out for Chartres.
Nothing can 
be more interesting than the magnificent cathedral of that city, or less 
so than the country about it, especially as I saw it under the influ- 
ence of a continued mizzling rain.
At half past 2 I started for An- 
gerville, where I had to wait at the station nearly two hours for the 
arrival of the train from Paris, with rain so incessant, and a road so 
deep in clay that I did not venture into the village.
The country all 
the way from Chartres to Orleans is as dull and monotonous as pos- 
sible : we traverse for some distance the forest of Orleans.
On the 29th I walked to Ingre and the forest beyond it.
The hill 
792 
on which Ingie stands is sandy at the base and clayey at top ; the 
stratum of clay contains, in other places, beds of a soft calcareous 
stone.
Orchis hircina here grows upon the sand, being less particular, 
in a warmer climate, in its choice of soil than it is with us or in Nor- 
mandy.
Thlaspi perfoliatum, Holosteum umbellatum and Bromus 
tectorum are no longer confined to walls and dry banks, but descend 
into the cultivated land.
The other plants were : â€” 
Cavuui BHlbocastaninii Fumaria pavviflora Hypochasris maculata 
Bupleurum rotimdifoliuin Campanula Speculum Artemisia campestris 
Neslia pauiculata Diautlius prolifer Oruithogalum umbellatuui 
Erysimum orieutale Silene conica Veronica triphyllos 
On the 30th I called by appointment, at 7 o'clock, on M.
Jullien, 
and we set off, accompanied by the premier gargon of the botanic 
garden and a lad with him, to St. Cyr en Yal. We did not reach the 
village till near 12, although only about six miles from Orleans ; but 
my companions were not well acquainted with the grasses and Cari- 
ces, and found fully as much to do as myself.
Beyond St. Cyr is a 
little valley, if so slight a depression may deserve the name, at first 
presenting barren banks and pieees of woodland, and becoming after- 
wards boggy ; and we passed over heaths and through w^oods on our 
return, the country being everywhere nearly flat.
Our plants were: â€” 
Madia sativa, the relic of Scutellaria liastata Vicia lutea 
cultivation Anarrliinum bellidifolium Trifolium ochroleucum 
Cliondrillajuncea Linaria Pelisseriana Vicia latliyroides 
Hieracium Auricula Piuguicula lusitanica Liipinus tenuifolius 
Litliospermum arvense, flo.
Veronica acinifolia Latliyrus augulatus 
Stacliys germanica [roseo Scleranthus perennis Aristolocliia Clematitis 
Brassica Cbeirautlius Lobelia urens Orcbis laxiflora 
Turritis olabra Astrocarpus sesamoides Carex ericetorum 
Herniaria birsuta Heliantbemum umbellatum C.
Scbreberi 
Before returning to Orleans we visited the source of the Loiret ; it 
is a nearly circular basin at the foot of a woody bank, in which the 
spring boils up with considerable force, and forms at once a river, 
which, after a quiet course of a few miles, joins the Loire.
It is a 
charming spot, well shaded ^ntli fine trees, and breathing sweetness 
and repose.
In this walk (which exceeded twenty miles) the want of 
ferns in situations apparently very favourable to them, was very strik- 
ing.
Wo saw only two or three of the most common species, and not 
many plants of those.
This, I apprehend, is tlie most eastern habitat 
known for Piuguicula lusitanica.
793 
The next day we had a ramble in the forest of Orleans, but besides 
that we had anticipated many of the plants, the ground in this direc- 
tion is not so favourable for Botany.
We examined a large shallow 
pond, where the gardener Aubin thought he had found Carex hordei- 
stichos, the year before but we sought for it in vain.
A curious variety 
of Cirsium anglicum, if it be not rather a species, grows here, the stem 
being much more leafy than in the usual state of the plant.
Cirsium anglicum is the Cnicus pratensis of our British botanists, 
the latter generic name having been taken from Linnaeus, the for- 
mer from Tournefort; and the name Cnicus being thus at liberty, De 
Candolle has appropriated it to the Centaurea benedicta, which was 
called Cnicus by Vaillant, and by Linnaeus in the first edition of the 
* Species Plantarum.' With regard to the trivial name the matter is 
more intricate.
Linnteus has a Carduus dissectus growing in France 
and England, which is lost if it be not this, plant.
Hudson conse- 
quently called it at first C.
dissectus, but afterwards adopted the name 
of C.
pratensis.
Cirsium anglicum is a name of Ray, adopted by La- 
marck.
1 will not here attempt to trace the limits or the synonymy 
of this species, tuberosum, bulbosum and pratcnse of DeCandoUe, ob- 
serving, however, that if tuberosum and bulbosum be the same plant, 
the former name is to be preferred, as the root is strictly tuberous, 
and not bulbous.
Smith says that the root is creeping in C.
tubero- 
sus, and not in pratensis.
It is certainly creeping in the plant before 
us, but I suspect that it is so, more or less, in his C.
pratensis.
We 
noticed Euphorbia dulcis, which I had not seen since I left Rouen, 
and one or two specimens of E.
Lathyris ; also Erica scoparia, Me- 
lampyrum cristatum.
Arnica montana.
Inula salicina and Festuca 
heterophylla : I have not made up my mind as to whether this F.
he- 
terophylla be the same as our F.
duriuscula.
I have never seen it 
except in woods, and the slender culms, and numerous, very long, ca- 
pillary root-leaves give it a very different appearance.
F. duriuscula 
of the French botanists is a variety of F.
ovina.
From Orleans I proceeded in a steam-boat down the Loire to Blois, 
and on Friday morning, in company with one of my companions in the 
packet, visited the Chateau de Charabord, a magnificent and very cu- 
rious palace of Francis I.
There are four large round towers at the 
angles of the principal building, which rather promise some fine apart- 
ments within, but they are cut up into little rooms.
Heavy rains af- 
terwards prevented all but a short walk to a place on the south side 
of the Loire, which sometimes receives its overfiowings.
Glaucium 
luteum has here established itself; aiul 1 noticed Mcdicago nnnima, 
794 
Senecio viscosus, Scrophularia canina, Cynoglossum pictum and 
Triticum Poa.
On the 3rd of Jnne I visited the forest of Blois, but with little suc- 
cess ; it seems to be of a clayey soil, with some mixture of flint, oc- 
cupying an extended and nearly level hill-top ; yet some of the little 
streams appeared to be permanent, though greatly swelled by the heavy 
rains.
The large variety of Monotropa grows here among the roots 
of the hornbeam.
We also find Euphorbia stricta and esula, Lina- 
ria striata, Crepis pulchra and Lamium maculatum, between the forest 
and the river.
The botanists of Orleans contend that the latter plant 
is a distinct species, and call it L.
hybridum : it has larger flowers 
than the common form, and is altogether a handsomer plant, but I see 
no specific difference.
Orchis laxiflora and hircina are not uncom- 
mon about Blois.
Just by Blois, in ascending the Loire, is a steep 
bushy bank, which is rich in plants, and from the charming views over 
the valley, would afford a delightful lounge in fine weather.
The 
plants I there observed were : â€” 
Orobanche caerulea Potentilla verna Ornithogalum pyrenaicum 
O. epithyraum Micropus erectus Muscari racemosum 
O. amethystea Valeriana rubra Ophrys aranifera 
Linum tenuifolium Centropliyllum lanatum Orchis hircina 
Prunella laciniata Medicago orbicularis Phleum Boehmeri 
Stachys recta Bupleuriim aristatum Celerach officinarum 
I was told at Orleans that I should find a rich harvest in the neigh- 
bourhood of Vendome ; â€” that the ground was ttes accidenie, and 
abounded in favourable situations.
To Vendome therefore I went, in 
one of tho diligences which run every day between that town and 
Blois ; and after breakfasting at the Hotel de St. Louis, which is an 
excellent one, set off' to find the botanic garden.
I was positively as- 
sured at the inn that there was neither garden nor Professor ; â€” there 
are both.
The garden, however, is only a little piece of ground at 
the back of the college, and the Professor â€” M.
Julliard â€” was unfor- 
tunately at Blois.
I did not regret this much at the time : the Pro- 
fessors at these smaller establishments in France, are often men who 
attend to little beyond the circuit of lectures they have to give, or at 
any rate who interest themselves but little in the Botany of the neigh- 
bourhood; but 1 afterwards learned that M.
Julliard is a good and 
zealous botanist, and well acquainted with the plants of the country, 
â€” a kind of knowledge particularly valuable to a stranger.
From the 
college I set out to find the gardener, who works at other places as 
well as at the botanic garden ; and not finding him at home, left word 
for him to call on me, either at his dinner-hour (2 o'clock), or in the 
795 
evening, and meanwhile I walked about the castle, where I observed 
Salvia Sclarea (not in flower), Medicago apiculata and Ophrys apifera, 
and afterwards to a piece of wood and barren ground, which I had 
noticed from the road, which yielded only Cirsium anglicum, Globu- 
laria vulgaris and Ornithogalum pyrenaicum.
In the evening my man 
did not make his appearance ; but as he had been recommended to 
me for his knowledge of localities, and was the only person to whom 
I could apply, I returned to seek him.
I found him in bed, his wife 
said he was ill, but he only acknowledged to being tired.
He was, 
however, quite willing to talk and to display his own knowledge, and 
began to catechise me about mine.
He boasted of his acquaintance 
with the grasses and Cyperaceae, and gave me to understand that he 
had no small knowledge of mosses.
We made however our arrange- 
ments for the next day.
I hired a cabriolet for six francs, and we set off at about half past 7.
There is a diligence for Montoire at half past 12, but I thought it 
would not do to lose so much time.
We breakfasted at Montoire and 
looked over the old castle, and then rambled among hanging woods, 
steep banks and chalk-like rocks, as far as Lavardin, where there are 
the picturesque ruins of another old and extensive castle.
I seldom 
have traversed a more promising tract, but the performance was by no 
means equal to the promise.
Of the Orchideae I observed Ophrys 
muscifera, apifera and aranifera, Orchis fusca pretty abundant, O.
Si- 
mia was also plentiful near Lavardin, but it is to be observed that 
though the form was completely that of Simia, the labellum was in- 
variably rough.
There were also Phyteuma spicatum (blue flowered), 
Stachys alpina, Lithospermum purpureo-caeruleum, Orobus niger and 
Hieracium murorum.
Before leaving these banks a heavy rain came on, and we afterwards 
lost our way in the marshy meadows.
Trifolium parisiense was here 
abundant, but nothing else which 1 have not already noticed.
We 
then passed to Les Roches, where there are some broken chalky clifis 
rising from the Loire, but the continued rain made the banks so slip- 
pery that we could hardly keep our feet.
Campanula persicifolia and 
Isatis tinctoria were the rarest plants ; Orchis hircina is very abun- 
dant.
My guide knew generally that the banks between Montoire 
and Lavardin, and the rocks at Les Roches, were the places in which 
the plants were mostly to be sought, and this any botanist would see 
at once from the aspect of the country, but beyond this he was totally 
ignorant, and his boasted knowledge of plants gradually dwindled 
away into very insignificant limits.
796 
On the 7tli I walked towards Colomraiers on the recommendation 
of my guide of the day before, as the best ground in the neighbour- 
hood of Vendome ; and the ground is good, consisting of slopes on 
the margin of a wood in a calcareous soil, but I did not add anything.
I was told at Vendome that a M.
Monin, a physician at Blois, was a 
very good botanist; to Blois therefore I returned, and soon made ac- 
quaintance with him.
We went together the next day to the wood 
of Russy, chiefly to look after Isopyrum thalictroides, A steep bank 
of small elevation descends from the wood towards the meadows, 
which, like most of those occupying the valleys in France, are quite 
flat and somewhat marshy.
In moist places at the foot of this slope 
was the station of the Isopyrum, but a new road has been made ^ot 
yet finished) along this very bank, and has cut away one half of it, 
and covered up the other with the rubbish, and the Isopyrum was 
not to be found.
Erica scoparia, Ranunculus nemorum, Scorzonera 
humilis and Centaurea Jacea were the fruits of our walk, and 1 found 
a curious irregular specimen of Orchis militaris (or of Simia), with 
the limbs variously united to the body, (fig.
11, p.
789).
On the 9th I set out alone, the rain having delayed M.
Monin, and 
went to a windmill which he had pointed out to me near St. Gervais.
I botanized there in spite of the frequent and heavy showers, and 
noticed Globularia vulgaris, Cynanchum vincetoxicum.
Geranium lu- 
cidum, Helianthemum apenninum ?
and H.
pulverulentum.
H. Fu- 
mana is said also to grow there, but I did not observe it.
There is a 
little wood close by, which seems rich in the usual calcareous plants 
of the country.
On the 10th I engaged a place in the voiture which goes from Blois 
to Romorantin, and was to have met M.
Monin at a place called Les 
Granges, but my driver knew nothing of Les Granges, though he had 
professed to be acquainted with it, and carried me beyond it, so that 
we missed each other.
The country of this day's excursion is called 
Sologne, and is a curious feature in the surface of France.
The 
ground seems to descend gradually all the way from Normandy to a 
considerable distance south of the Loire, so that the hills, which about 
Rouen are 500 or 600 feet high, become less and less, till a height of 
30 or 40 feet forms a marked eminence.
The whole surface in So- 
logne is sandy and gently undulating, and, from its low position, is 
generally moist in the bottoms.
Sedum villosum grows among the 
corn, and Illecebrum verticillatum on the road-sides.
It seems to be 
well worth visiting from its peculiarity, and from its botanical produc- 
tions, as it offers many rare ])lants, and I should have done well to 
707 
have gone to Romorantin, and to liavc spent two ov three days there 
and at Salbris, in the very depths of Sologne.
The maps mark a mul- 
titude of triangular pools, and in the winter, and even at the time I 
was there, these exist.
A dam is made across one of these hardly- 
inarked valleys, and the water collects there, but in summer you may 
traverse most of them in any direction without getting wet.
Aspho- 
delus albus is said to be abundant in some parts, and this is about its 
most northern station ; it is also probably about the most southern 
station, independent of mountains, for INIyrica Gale.
The plants that 
I observed were not numerous ; besides the two already mentioned, 
Sedum and Illecebrum, they were : â€” 
Astvocarpon sesanioides Arenaiia segetalis Lathyrus angulatus 
Tillaea muscosa Astrolobium ebracteatum Vicia lutea 
Trifoliura subterraneuin Avena tenuis ?
Juncus capitatus 
Scirpus maritimus Speigula subulata 
After these excursions I returned to Orleans, whence T made an 
unproductive trip to the Pont de Segris.
Our principal object was 
to get an Anchusa, which M.
Jullien supposed to be the altissima of 
Desfontaines : they had a plant of it in the garden.
1 suspect it 
will prove a variety of A.
italica, but we found only the common form 
of A.
italica in this station.
The almost continued rain was, however, 
very discouraging.
From Orleans I proceeded to Paris.
To keep the form of a jouraal in the various walks and little trips 
that I made during a residence of six weeks in Paris and in its neigh- 
bourhood, would occasion a number of useless repetitions : 1 shall 
therefore begin by giving a list of those plants which are marked with 
a C {comi)iun) variously modified in the Catalogue published by Cos- 
son, Germain and Weddel, but which are rare or unknown in Eng- 
land, and therefore interesting to an English botanist ; and thence 
proceed to state, as far as my experience goes, what more may be ex- 
pected in various excursions in the neighbourhood.

My first excursion was to Charenton, on the 17tli of June, and I 
visited that place again on the 23rd of July, in company with M.
de 
Jussieu and his party, but in the latter case it was very wet weather.
Taking the voiture for Charenton, the botanist will get out at the 
bridge, and crossing it, will proceed to that over the Seine, whicli he 
will not cross.
A little above this, on the right bank of the Seine, I 
gathered Sisymbrium supinum, a plant which was much more plenti- 
ful formerly than it is at present, the efforts of Parisian botanists hav- 
ing nearly succeeded in destroying it.
He will then return and cross 
the Marne in a boat, just above the bridge, to one of the islands, and 
ascend the river : here, however, I obtained nothing but luula britau- 
nica.
On leaving the shore, the bank on the left of the road furnished 
Anchusa italica and Orobanche amethystea; but before this the great- 
er part of the company were driven back by the rain.
I proceeded 
800 
in company with M.
Germain and two others, to the plain of La Va- 
renne, a sandy flat forming the extremity of the peninsula of St. Maur, 
partly woody or waste and partly cultivated.
Here we got Polycne- 
mum arvense and Trigonella monspeliaca.
Thence proceeding to St.
Maur and entering the Bois de Vincennes, we find on the road to the 
gate of Nogent, abundance of Carduus acanthoides of the French bo- 
tanists, growing amongst a quantity of C.
nutans and C.
crispus (the 
acanthoides of Smith), between which it seems to be a hybrid.
In 
the same neighbourhood, on the side of a road a little more to the 
right, grow Brassica Cheiranthus, Malva Alcea and Verbascum Blat- 
taria, and, a little further on, Lathyrus tuberosus.
This part of the 
w^ood is very beautiful, commanding views over the valley of the 
Marne ; and it is the only part which is so.
Thence, crossing the 
wood to the gate of Fontenay, we take the road nearest to the w^all of 
the wood leading to Vincennes, where we shall meet with Scutellaria 
Columnae in abundance, Silene catholica, Cucubalus baccifer and 
Tordylium maximum.
The two first are supposed to have been sown 
in this locality at some unknown period ; and there are two or three 
other plants which I did not see, believed to be in the same predica- 
ment.
Here also I observed a plant of Ranunculus nemorum, but 
whether there is more of it I do not know, for having gathered the 
plant lately in a much better state at Blois, I did not pay much atten- 
tion to it.
This walk, if not very productive of rare plants which are 
genuine natives, has the advantage of exhibiting a large portion of 
those which are more common in the vicinity of Paris.
The water- 
side about Charenton, the dry slopes beyond, the sandy plain of La 
Varennes, and the wood of Vincennes, furnishing all the usual varie- 
ties of soil and situation.
The botanist will meet with Senecio palu- 
dosus.
Delphinium Consolida, Nigella arvensis, Filago arvensis &c., 
and later in the year w^ith Digitariae, Setariae &c.
It seems hardly necessary to say anything of my Paris life, yet a 
few words may not be useless to a brother botanist who visits that 
city for the first time.
I took up my lodgings at the Hotel des Etran- 
gers, Rue Vivienne, where I paid three francs a-day for my room.
This I believe is the usual price for a single well-furnished room on 
the second story or on the entresol, at the respectable inns in Paris.
You pay besides for a wax candle, one of which lasted me for a fort- 
night ; and would have to pay for a fire if you wanted one, and you 
are charged ten sous a-day for the servants.
There are no other ex- 
tras to make up a bill connected with the chamber, and the chambers 
in Paris are always fitted up as sitting-rooms ; the bed occupying one 
801 
corner, or sometimes across.
If you eat and drink in the hotel, you 
hav^e a list of prices hung up in your room, so that you may know dis- 
tinctly all your expenses.
The servants usually expect, at least from 
Englishmen, a small additional present, but I found them well con- 
tented when 1 formed my calculation for this at five sous per day.
There is a table d'hote at half past 5, at four francs ; but being not 
overburthened with money, I did not frequent it, since I could get a 
dinner which pleased me as well or better for half that sum.
I usu- 
ally went for my breakfast to the Cafe de la Place des Victoires, where 
I had one large cup, or perhaps rather basin, of coffee and milk, with 
bread and butter : this cost me one franc, including two sous to the 
waiter.
I prefer this coffee-house, because they give the coffee in a 
larger cup than usual, without making it overflow.
Those who wish 
for a more solid breakfast, will find it at the restaurateur's, for twenty- 
five sous.
My dinner cost me two francs, a price for which you get 
a very good one at a great many of the Paris restaurateurs.
I tried 
several, but the one I preferred was Tavernier's, in the Palais Royal.
You have soup, or rather broth, wine, three dishes and a dessert, for 
your money, I added four sous for the waiters, which I believe is 
the highest sum usually given.
There is a restaurateur at the west 
side of the Palais Royal (Moureau's), where they give you four dishes 
for the same price, but I think the food is hardly so good as at Ta- 
vernier's.
In all these you dine in a handsome saloon, with every- - 
thing clean and in good order ; you are invariably presented with a 
clean napkin, and all those little comforts in which the cheaper Lon- 
don eating-houses are so deficient.
At Tavernier's they give you ice 
to cool your wine in hot weather.
There are other places still cheap- 
er, which at least make a respectable appearance.
In the evening you 
may have tea at any of the coffee-houses ; but my experience is not 
in its favour, and I sometimes had an ice, sometimes an orgeat, and 
sometimes contented myself with eau sucree, which has the merit of 
being the most economical of the three.

â€” Notes on the Hieracium nigrescens (Willd) of 
BabingtorCs ''Manual^ and Mr. Gihson^s Hieracium hypochoe- 
roides.
By Hewett C.
Watson, Esq., F.L.S.
Both these Hieracia have been long known to English botanists, 
though never clearly understood.
They occur in many localities, and 
specimens are doubtless preserved in many herbaria.
It is not my 
3 z 
802 
wish here to interfere with the good observers who have taken them 
under examination for the determination of their right names and cha- 
racters ; but only to supply a few circumstances of their history, by 
which other botanists will be enabled to identify the specimens of 
them in collections.
In 1830, the " Hieracium nigrescens" was pointed out to me, then 
a very young botanist, by Professor Graham, on the Clova mountains, 
as a species which he believed to be distinct from H.
alpinum, and I 
still possess specimens then collected.
About the same date, per- 
haps in 1831, Sir W.
J. Hooker gave me other specimens from the 
Caimgorum mountains, as a form of H.
alpinum.
In 1840, Mr. Gar- 
diner, of Dundee, collected many good specimens of the plant for the 
Botanical Society of London, which were distributed to the members, 
labelled " Hieracium Halleri, Fe7/." in the writing of Mr. Gardiner.
In 1841, I brought living plants to^my garden from Ben Aulder, in 
Inverness-shire ; and still feeling at fault about the true place and 
name of the plant, I requested the opinion of Mr. Babington, who 
suggested that it was the H.
nigrescens of Willdenow.
Afterwards, 
on a living plant being shown to Mr. Borrer, that gentleman also de- 
signated it by the same name.
On the continent it has been named 
as variously as in Britain.
In my garden, the seeds falling about the 
plants (in 1842) produced young plants (in 1843) with leaves exactly 
like those on the original roots from Ben Aulder, but they have not 
yet flowered.
The plant differs from^H.
alpinum, by its very broad 
leaves with a few strong teeth, and the black involucres.
It is alto- 
gether a much more rigid plant.
The stems are simple or branched, 
leafy or leafless.
Mr. Gibson's note on his " Hieracium hypochoeroides " (Phytol.
741), is valuable in its tendency to explain a remarkable blunder, as 
it now appears to be, which j.has been copied into several botanical 
works ; and in the diffusion of which I have been a party concerned, 
although not exactly in the manner stated by Mr. Gibson.
The 
neighbourhood of Settle, in Yorkshire, has been long recorded as a 
habitat for Hypochceris maculata ; though not recently proved.
Mr.
Gibson has now confirmed a suspicion which occurred to me from 
other evidence, that a common Hieracium had been misnamed Hy- 
pochceris maculata, by some of the older botanists, who looked only 
at its spotted leaves.
Hence the introduction of false localities for 
the latter plant into our books.
In the original 'Botanist's Guide,' published in 1805, the localities 
stand thus : â€” " About Malham Cove, Z>r.
Smith.
Near Otterraine 
803 
Cove, Settle, Mr. Caley.^' I presume " Dr. Smith " to intend the au- 
thor of the ' British Flora ; ' yet, in ' English Flora,' Smith gives no 
habitat on his own authority.
In the New Guide, published in 1835, 
the localities are reprinted from Turner and Dillwyn's work, with an 
addition of " Rocks in Gordale," copied from MSS.
lent to me by the 
late Mr. Winch, and in which that locality is inserted on the autho- 
rity of Mr. Windsor.
Mr. Gibson is therefore not quite accurate in 
saying that I refer the " plant " to Hypochceris maculata : my only 
participation in the matter was that of printing the localities expressly 
on the authority of other persons.
It was not until the winter of 1840-41, that I saw a specimen under 
the name of Hypochceris maculata, from the neighbourhood of Settle.
In that winter Mr. Tatham sent specimens to the Botanical Society 
of London, so labelled : â€” an error that any one might have fallen 
into under the circumstances.
Before those specimens were distri- 
buted by the Botanical Society, the labels were altered to " Hieraci- 
um pulmonarium," and probably with a note of interrogation after the 
specific name ; some doubt, I recollect, being felt, as to whether that 
name or H.
maculatum (of Smith) should be given to the specimens 
in question.
Several years ago the late Mr. J.
E. Bowman communicated speci- 
mens to my herbarium, under the name of" H.
murorum," â€” ^and that 
I still consider to be the proper specific name of this spotted Hiera- 
cium.
Mr. Bowman had collected the specimens about Castle Dinas 
Bran, near Llangollin, in North Wales ; and I also gathered the plant 
in the same locality, in 1832.
Early in that year, I found a few very 
young plants of it, by the falls of the Ogwen, in Caernarvonshire ; a 
locality for H.
pictum, according to Mr. C.
C. Babington, in the New 
Guide.
In 1836, Mr. James Ward gave me specimens collected near West 
Burton, in Bishopdale, Yorkshire ; and which were labelled " Hiera- 
cium pulmonarium," and the locality published under that name, in 
the Supplement to the New Guide.
There were likewise examples 
of the same plant among Mr. Gardiner's collections for the Botanical 
Society, in 1 840 ; and these also were labelled " H.
pulmonarium, 
Sm.^'' and distributed to various members of the Society.
Lastly, I 
have collected this plant on the mountains of Forfar, Aberdeen, In- 
verness, and probably Perth shires.
The Scottish specimens have 
usually two or three leaves on the stem, those of Wales and England 
one or none.
The heads of flowers vary from one to three.
Not having seen Mr. Gibson's plant, I cannot confidently say that 
3z 2 
804 
it is the s;inio as tlio s]ioci)nons from these diffbrciit localities ; though 
his own briel' account of it, and the s])ccimeiis sent to London by Mr.
Tathani, as hcfove mentioned, k\ive small room for doubt on this head.
Mr. Gibson bi>ldly assumes that his llieracium is the very plant for- 
merly mistaken for Hypochoiris maculata ; and there appears great 
probability of the truth of this assumption, although no direct proof is 
adduced.
Thus far I write in the conntr}', with only my own herbarium to i*e- 
fer to.
In passing through London tomorrow on a journey ni>rth\vard, 
1 hope to look into Smith's herbarium for any additional inibrmation.
The Nos. of ' The Phytologist ' for October and November reached 
niv hands togetlier, on the 3rd; so that I have only just seen the note 
bv Mr. S.
Gibson.
It now nuist excite suspicion against the correct- 
ness of other northern localities for Ilypochceris maculata, in Lanca- 
shire, Westmoreland and Forfarshire.
Thames Ditton, November (>, 1813.
r.S. â€” Nov. 7.
On reference to'Smith's herbarium, I find two spe- 
cimens labelled " llieracium macnlatum." One of these is a garden 
specimen, the roots of which were brought from Westmoreland, by 
Mr. Crowe ; and it corresponds well with the various specimens men- 
tioned above, as probably identical with INIr. S.
Gibson's plant.
The 
exceptions to this correspondence are seen in its more leal'y stem, 
bearing numerous tlowers â€” the Tisual etl'eet of cultivation in gardens.
The second specimen in the herbarium I should rather have joined 
with a Sicilian plant labelled "â– llieracium pulmonarium :" it is locat- 
ed tioni Breiddin hill, and was collected, by Mr. J.
E. Bowman.
Ap- 
parentlv, the " llieracium glaucnm," from the Clova mountains, is 
still the same plant as the " II.
macnlatunr' troni Westmoreland.
Of llieracium nigi'escens, there are garden specimens in Smith's 
herbarium, labelled " II.
pulmonarium .?
" The roots were found on 
Ben V Gloe, by Mr. Mackay, and on the Clova mountains, by Mr. G.
Don. A specimen labelled " H.
pulmonarium '' (without question), 
and mentioned to have been collected Iw Mr. Borrer, at the " River 
Nivis, near the bridge.
Scotland," docs not greatly ditler from the 
other two ; but has narrower leaves.
Smith's specimens of Hypochceris maculata are all from Suft'olk.
This circumstance tends to corroborate Mr. Gibson's conjecture, that 
a species oi' llieracium was mistaken for the lIypocha?ris in Wn-kshire.
My own conjecture is, that the llieracium in question is merely the 
wild form of the garden II.
nuiculatum, figured in 'English Botimy ' 
805 
under tliat nauK!, but only a vari(;ty of II.
mnrorinn.

Note on Inula Heleuiiim and Ulex nanus.
Not knowing 
where to address Mr. Habington at this time, 1 send the enclosed to 
you, that it may meet his eye through tlie medium of * The Piiytolo- 
gist,' if you deem it worthy a place in that journal.
In conformity 
with the concluding ])aragra])h of the Preface to Mr. Babington's 
' Manual of British Botany,' 1 have to mention that during the late 
suunner I found Inula llelenium growing abundantly in a moist m(;a- 
dow upon Newtown farm, in the neighbourhood of Lymiugton, Hants.
Sir W.
J. Hooker, in the last edition of his * British Flora,' descrilnjs 
the flower as " larger, terminal, solitary." In the Manual it is said, 
"heads few together or solitary." The plants found h>y me had gene- 
rally four heads, and were consequently very unlike the figure in 
' English Botany : ' only one had so few as three.
Whether any of 
the heads proved abortive I cannot say, the cattle having trodden 
them down before more than one blossom had opened.
While upon 
Beaulieu heath in September, which is covered with furze and differ- 
ent species of heath, the former caught my attention from the circum- 
stance that in very few spots only blossoms appeared ; these I was 
disposed to refer to Ulex nanus, as they bore a striking reseinblance 
to the figure of that species in ' English liotany.' On further obser- 
vation, however, the flowers were found only upon the trailing shoots 
of such plants as had been cut down the ])receding winter, rarely did 
a single .shoot present a more erect position.
The old entire buslies 
had not the least appearance of flowers upon them.
Upon my return 
to Bath about the end of the month, I found the open part of the fo- 
rest, on the Salisbury side of Lyndhurst, covered with furze every- 
where in blossom, being so high and erect in many places as to re- 
present Mr. Babington's var.
&. major of Ulex nanus, the blossonis 
being twice as large as those upon Beaulieu heath.
1 had no oj)por- 
tunity of minutely examining the calyx, bracts or spines in either 
case.
These facts, and Mr. Babington's not ado]jting specific cha- 
racters from the teeth of the calyx, as Sir James Suiith has done in 
' English Botany,' and Sir W.
J. Hooker in his ' British Flora,' but 
rather from the more or less shaggy surface of that organ, the ovate.
806 
lax or very minute adpressed state of the bracts, or the relative situ- 
ation of the flowers and spines, induce me to think that none of these 
appearances may be so constant as to afford specific characters.
If 
so, why is not the var.
$. major of Ulex nanus raised to the rank of a 
species ?
Its superior size, erect form, large flowers, and long and 
strong deflexed spines, seem, equally with U.
nanus, to entitle it to 
this distinction.
If they be distinct species however, why do the au- 
tumnal flowers of Beaulieu heath appear only upon the young shoots 
of those plants which have been cut down in the preceding autumn 
or winter ?
If only one species, why is the season of flowering dif- 
ferent ?
Do the Beaulieu plants, which, in the adult state, seem to 
belong to U.
europaeus, flowering in the spring, throw out flowering 
shoots in the autumn, having the appearance of U.
nanus, in conse- 
quence of their not having had branches capable of bearing blossoms 
in the spring ?

JS/oie on Symphytum asperrimum.
In answer to Mr. Sidebo- 
tham (Phytol.

of Symphytum asperrimum from my 'Flora Bathoniensis,' p.
32, where 
it is mentioned as a naturalized plant near Bath.

Urtica pilulifera in the Isle of Wight.
In your November 
No.
(Phytol.
758), is a list by Mr. G.
S. Gibson, of the rarer plants 
found by him near Ventnor, during a week's stay at that place last 
summer, amongst which is a notice of Urtica pilulifera, near Luc- 
combe chine.
I presume Mr. G.'s specimens were found in a field 
between the lodge and white gate near Chine-cottage, and the bank 
towards Rose-cliff and East end, on which Epilobium angustifolium 
grows, as othei^wise I should esteem it a favour to be informed of a se- 
cond locality ; but since I have little doubt of my first supposition 
being correct, I would just beg to ask Mr. Gibson whether on exami- 
nation he will not find his plant to be Urtica Dodartii ?
â€” in which 
case I can assure him he has neither made a discovery, nor secured 
an acquisition to his herbarium, the seeds of that species having been 
scattered by myself on the spot (till lately occupied by some ruinous 
cottages, now cleared away) two years ago, and I imagined the plants 
had become extinct.
I gladly seize this opportunity, much as it tells 
against myself, of this unexpected exemplification of its injurious ten- 
dency, to condemn the practice of attempting to assist or direct Nature 
in the dissemination of plants, by artificially sowing their seeds in 
places where it is likely the plants produced may be taken for or con- 
founded with the genuine natives of the soil ; a practice which, if not 
807 
morally wrong, is, in a scientific point of view, highly reprehensible, 
as creating confusion in Vegetable Geography, by registering false 
stations, and cruelly misleading the working botanist by inducing a 
belief of his having found that which, unless spontaneously presenting 
itself to his observation, is, to say the least, utterly worthless as an 
object for examination and record.
Having committed this misde- 
meanour, I feel bound to make the only reparation the act admits of, 
in a voluntary confession of guilt, and to assure Mr. Gibson that with 
this single exception, all the remaining, and to me most familiar loca- 
lities, mentioned in his list, are, to the best of my belief, truly the ap- 
pointment of Nature, â€” at all events, I can honestly declare they are 
none of my making.

A few words more on the Habitats of Equisetum Telmateia.
Probably I have one blunder to answer for here, in common with the 
other parties who have sent notes on the subject to the pages of 'The 
Phytologist,' â€” namely, that of overlooking the proper inference from 
certain facts which conflict, perhaps, only while not clearly under- 
stood.
Mr. Newman appears to have given the true explanation, in 
saying that " closeness and compactness of soil " are unfavourable.
The watery situations in which 1 have seen the plant growing, were 
most (if not all) of them loosely muddy.
The avoided watery situa- 
tions, as described, were apparently of an opposite character.
Seve- 
ral of the dry situations in which it is stated to grow, are upon loose 
earth or rubbish-heaps.
Some of the habitats are in woods ; and the 
soil in woods is often made very loose and porous by the decay of ve- 
getable matter, the boring of worms attracted by the dead leaves, and 
the digging of moles in pursuit of worms.
I beg, however, to add, 
that the tendency of my own remark on the subject, was to show that 
the plant did not shun water.
My own opportunities had led me to 
agree with the desciiptions of watery localities in many local Floras, 
and with the ideas suggested by the specific names given to the plant.
But I may freely confess now, that the reports of various botanists in 
' The Phytologist,' have fully satisfied me about the plant growing 
808 
away from water, more frequently and more flourishingly than I had 
previously supposed to be the case.

Reply to Mr. Gibson on Carex distans.
Mr. Gibson's enquiry 
(Phytol.
777), specially addressed to me, proves (what I was previ- 
ously unwilling to believe) that he is not aware that the specific cha- 
racters of Carex distans, and of the two allied species, as given in the 
4th and 5th editions of the ' British Flora,' have been drawn up by 
Dr. Boott, and not by Sir W.
J. Hooker.
To Dr. Boott, as to the 
"fountain-head" for information on this particular subject, Mr. Gib- 
son should apply ; no other person can pretend to give an infallible 
decision on this point.
There is no method yet discovered of know- 
ing the ideas of others, but through the medium of language ; and Mr.
Gibson may have learned by experience how easily an inadvertent 
expression may be turned against the writer to his discredit, either 
with or without a note of interrogation, by one addicted to such pur- 
suits of literature.
Mr. G.
may see no occasion for the characters of 
C. binervis and C.
distans being remodelled, because I have always 
found myself " at fault in making out the difference between them ; " 
â€” (if that is not his reason for mentioning this interesting discovery, 
why does he make it a matter of such importance here ?) Admitting, 
for the sake of argument, that my doubts were about something more 
than the value of these differences, as a foundation for specific cha- 
racters, does it follow that I must still labour in the dark, and have 
no help from such able and enlightened men as Dr. Boott ?
I agree 
with Mr. G.
that a perfect specific character ought not to be remo- 
delled, and that every change must be for the worse; but he evidently 
confounds the idea of a description with that of a specific character.
A description may be perfect, while the specific character extracted 
from it may be ill-constructed.
The legitimate object of a specific 
character is, as I take it, to express, as clearly and as briefly as pos- 
sible, wherein one plant &c.
differs from all other known plants of the 
same family.
For it is impossible to construct the specific character 
of each, so that it shall answer this end with regard to unknown spe- 
cies ; and continual changes and remodellings are, in the very nature 
of things, indispensable, until a Flora is complete.
The sanction for 
altering the specific characters of Carex binervis and C.
distans, con- 
sists in the recent admission of a third species â€” C.
punctata â€” previ- 
ously unknown as British, with which each of the two had to be con- 
trasted.
It is evident that Sir W.
J. Hooker did not think so highly 
of his own specific characters, or he would not have changed them 
809 
for others.
But it seems that even the description of C.
distans is 
not so perfect as that Mr. G.
cannot remodel and improve it.

Note on Mr* Gibsons Carex 'pseudo-'paradoxa.
I observed 
with some surprise in your last number, a paragraph by Mr. Gibson, 
headed " Note on a new British Carex," (Phytol.
778) ; and consi- 
dering myself in some degree obligated to maintain the correctness of 
the Flora of this neighbourhood, I feel that I ought to afford to the 
readers of your valuable journal, what little information I possess as 
relating to this supposed " new species," in order that they may be 
put in possession of the opinions and facts in connexion with it here.
At the present moment I will not stop to describe the exact topogra- 
phical situation of this interesting plant, "as that is a secret;" but 
proceed to explain the nature of the circumstances under which the 
plant grows.
All or most of your readers are doubtless aware that 
Carex teretiuscula has always been described as having an isolated 
and detached mode of growth ; being, in this respect, strikingly con- 
trasted with C.
paniculata, which, until recently, was its only known 
British ally.
In this, the roots form larger or smaller dense and ele- 
vated ccBspites, or, as they are sometimes emphatically named, " stool- 
tufts." This featm-e has been in general use of late as an excellent 
means of diagnosis between the two plants when seen growing, and I 
may mention that I have had an opportunity of contrasting them on 
the same spot of gi'ound, and so far as my observations extend, this 
difference in the formation of the roots is pennanent.
In the situa- 
tion where Mr. Gibson's " Carex pseudo-paradoxa" is found, the 
plant has not the opportunity of displaying its characteristic property 
of isolation, and is compelled to increase by a regular approximation 
and aggregation of its roots : the place is a swamp, of a very small 
extent, situated in a rather deep hollow, the site of an old marl-pit, 
which originally was entirely filled with water.
It is bounded on 
three sides by sloping banks covered with various shrubs, and on the 
other by the remains of the pit or pond ; thus confined, the plant has 
assumed a singular and unusual habit : the roots are so closely inter- 
woven with each other, as almost entirely to prevent the existence of 
any other plant, the herbage being constituted of the foliage of this 
plant, so as to appear like one immense and unbroken root ; as we 
approach the water, however, it begins to separate itself into masses 
of various sizes, and is more isolated, and in this manner assumes a 
pseudo-caespitose appearance : this circumstance, in connexion with 
its elongate and slender stems, and its more racemose mode of inflo- 
810 
rescence, led me, and the friend who was with me, to suspect that it 
might possibly be something new to us, and if so, probably Carex pa- 
radoxa, Schkuhr.
I therefore instituted a very careful examination 
into all its characters, being solely desirous to learn the truth respect- 
ing it, whatever that might be ; and after spending a considerable 
amount of time and patience in the enquiry, and carefully considering 
all the facts, particularly in reference to its fruit, which hardly, if at 
all, differs from that of Carex teretiuscula in its ordinary state, I was 
obliged, though very unwillingly, to conclude that it was nothing but 
a form of that plant, putting on a different aspect and habit from 
the adventitious circumstances under whose influence it happened to 
grow.
Schkuhr's admirable figure of C.
paradoxa, combined with his 
description, conclusively determined that it was not that plant ; feel- 
ing however very diffident of my own ability to form a correct and 
positive opinion, and wishing to avoid even the appearance of error 
or hastiness of conclusion, I procured a considerable supply of recent 
specimens, and took them with me to my valued friend Mr. Wilson.
We again jointly renewed the examination, which was conducted with 
all the care and ability we could bestow, both of us being anxious to 
add another species to our Flora, if we could do so consistently ; but 
after all our pains, the facts were too clear, and the evidence too con- 
clusive, to allow us to consider it as anything else than a modified form 
of C.
teretiuscula.
With this decision I feel quite satisfied, and I 
have no doubt Mr. Wilson will bear me out in the statements I have 
made.
I may here also mention that the plant was submitted to Dr.
Boott, the prince of our caricologists, and the fountain-head from 
whence alone indisputable opinions on this genus are to be expected, 
and I am proud to add the weight of his great authority in confirma- 
tion of our opinion.
How Mr. Gibson could possibly assert, with 
anything like an appearance of truth, that the plant was " a form of 
C. teretiuscula with ihe fruit of C.
paniculata^'' I am utterly at a loss 
to conceive ; the thing itself is an absurdity.
If the plant Juis the 
fruit of Carex paniculata, I opine that all will agree, save Mr. Gibson, 
that it must be that plant, or some state of it, and cannot by possibi- 
lity be either C.
teretiuscula, or what Mr. G.
pleases to name " C.
pseudo-paradoxa." An apple-tree does not generally produce pears, 
nor, for the same reason, does one species of Carex often assume the 
fruit characteristic of an entirely different one : the result of your cor- 
respondent's observations, however, on this natural law, appear to be 
at variance with those universally adopted by others.
But as Mr.
Gibson seems desirous, when anxious to strengthen and confirm his 
811 
own opinions, to have the able assistance of yourself, I feel that I 
cannot do better than submit the merits of this question to your de- 
cision.
For this purpose I have sent perfect specimens of Carex pa- 
niculata and C.
teretiuscula, as well as of C.
pseudo-paradoxa {Glhson)^ 
and I shall be greatly indebted to you, and so, I have no doubt, your 
readers will also, if you will give them your most careful attention, and 
favour us with the results in the next number of * The Phytologist.' 
You will perhaps have the goodness, especially to record on that oc- 
casion, the degree of similarity which you may observe between the 
fruit of C.
paniculata and the " new species," as the decision of this 
point is a matter of some importance.
I must not forget to notice the 
rather invidious assertion of your correspondent as to the secrecy 
which he says is maintained respecting the habitat of this very pseu- 
do-paradoxical plant.
No such thing as secrecy has been shown at 
all ; â€” there was nothing to keep secret, and Mr. Gibson was never re- 
fused to have the place made known to him, the individual to whom 
he applied for that purpose merely declining to accompany him there, 
because he could not leave his business on a market-day, without 
great loss and inconvenience : to no one else did Mr. G.
apply.
â€” J.
B. Wood; Broughton, November Qjld)^'^.
[After the decision arrived at by the eminent botanists above cited, it seems to be 
a work of supererogation for iis to say a word on the subject; at least we cannot 
suppose that our opinion will add much weight to either side of the question : but 
since Dr. Wood has done us the honour thus publicly to appeal to our decision, it 
would savour somewhat of affectation were we to withhold the result of a very careful 
examination and comparison of the beautiful specimens forwarded by him, as well 
as of others previously received.
Premising then that as we have never seen the 
plant named Carex paradoxa, and know nothing of it except from the short descrip- 
tion in Mr. Babingtou's ' Manual,' and Schkuhr's figure, we are quite unable to say 
from actual comparison of specimens how far the disputed Manchester plant agrees or 
disagrees with that species.
We must also state that as we have not enjoyed the op- 
portunity of observing the disputed Carex in a growing state, our remarks must of ne- 
cessity be confined to the dried specimens now before us.
The first thing which struck 
us in the Manchester plant, as indicating a difference between it and the usual state 
of Carex teretiuscula, was the more elongated spike â€” panicle we cannot call it â€” of 
the former.
This occurred some months ago, and since that time we have had an op- 
portunity of seeing a tolerably extensive series of specimens, including those now sent 
by Dr. Wood, which show that the plant usually known as C.
teretiuscula, is by no 
means constant in this respect, and that a regular gradation may be traced from the 
most dense spike of the one plant to the most elongated form of the other, but we have 
hitherto met with no approach to the mode of inflorescence of C.
paniculata.
A com- 
parison of the roots, stem and herbage, equally fails to indicate any identity in the 
disputed plant with C.
paniculata, while it goes far to establish a very close connexion 
with C.
teretiuscula.
Since then this plant has undoubtedly " the form of C.
tereti- 
812 
uscula," let us see how far the possession of " the fruit of paniculata" will hold good.
We have now before us, under the microscope, the fruit of the disputed plant, of C.
teretiuscula and of C.
paniculata, all in a mature and perfect state.
No one who has 
examined and compared them will deny that there is a striking difference between the 
fruit of C.
paniculata and that of C.
teretiuscula.
The former has a rather deeply 
cloven beat, laterally margined with a thickly fringed whitish membrane and furnish- 
ed with a small wing on its convex side ; the ribs are also tolerably prominent, and 
most of them extend from the base of the perigynium far into the beak : on the other 
hand, the fruit of C.
teretiuscula has a scarcely cloven beak, with rather narrow, green, 
and sparingly serrated lateral membranes, and a prominent dorsal wing : the ribs are 
much more obscure than in C.
paniculata, and several of them cease a short distance 
above the base of the perigynium, which appears more regular in its outline in the 
latter plant than in C.
teretiuscula, and its deeply cloven beak is very striking.
In 
these particulars the fruit of the disputed plant bears a close correspondence with that 
of C.
teretiuscula, and consequently differs as widely from that of C.
paniculata.
In 
the nut, bracts and glumes we observe nearly the same degree of resemblance between 
the two plants, and an equal degree of discrepancy between them and C.
paniculata.
Takino- therefore all these circumstances into consideration, whatever may have been 
our former opinion, which was founded on the examination of an insutBcient number 
of specimens, we are bound to state that we can now come to no other conclusion 
than that the disputed plant is neither C.
paradoxa, nor a form of C.
paniculata, but 
C. teretiuscula, somewhat modified and changed in habit by the circumstances under 
which it occurs.

Note on Statice rarifiora.
The plant alluded to in my pre- 
vious notes (Pliytol.
429 and 492), and a specimen of which, presented 
to the Botanical Society of London, was figured in your pages (Id.
561), having at length been determined, I beg to offer an observation 
or two on it.
At the time when the above-mentioned notices appear- 
ed, I was unable to give any further information respecting it, not 
having met with it until past flowering ; and not then suspecting it to 
be a new species, I neglected to secure more specimens than those 
which I subsequently transmitted to the Botanical Society.
This 
year, however, I have diligently examined the whole of the neigh- 
bouring salt-marshes, and am now able to state that the plant in ques- 
tion occurs in profusion in the neighbourhood of this town.
I have 
sent specimens of it to many botanical friends, and in particular to 
Messrs.
Babington and Watson.
These gentlemen have kindly fa- 
voured me with their opinions on it, and both agree in referring it to 
Drejer's Statice rariflora.
They consider it as identical with the Scot- 
tish plant.
The chief distinguishing characteristics, as I have observ- 
ed it in this neighbourhood, are as follows : â€” Scape 8 to 24 inches 
high, erect, much branched, generally below the middle ; branches 
spreading : flowers distant, fole blue ; petals emarginate : calyx very 
hairy, with a long tube, and five acute, somewhat lacerate teeth, also 
813 
very frequently with intermediate teeth : leaves ovato-spathulate when 
full grown, lanceolate when young.
Perennial : flowering in August 
and September, about a fortnight later than S.
Limonium.
It grows 
in large tufts, as many as twelve or even more flowering stems fre- 
quently rising from a single plant.
S. Limonium is common in com- 
pany with it, but I have not seen any specimens which could truly be 
said to present intermediate grades.
Whether small, or in the great- 
est luxuriance, S.
rariflora preserves most completely its prima facie 
distinction â€” the inflorescence.
In no instance have I seen the flow- 
ers at all crowded towards the ends of the branches, as they always 
are, even in the fewest-flowered specimens of S.
Limonium.
Having 
a few specimens still left, I shall feel pleasure in supplying any of 
your correspondents who may wish for one, as far as my duplicates 
will go.

On the plurality of Buds in the axilla of a single leaf Not 
having particularly examined the instances pointed out by Mr. Wat- 
son (Phytol.
776), I am not prepared to say whether they are com- 
pletely in accordance with that which I have observed in the locust- 
tree.
None of the Fuchsias, which I have now the opportunity of 
inspecting, exhibit the character which he mentions ; and the buds 
of the vine are essentially different from those of the locust-tree, of 
which I enclose a specimen, showing two young contiguous branches 
of the present year, gathered in June last, along with several other si- 
milar proofs.
In that which accompanies this note, it will be seen 
that the lower shoot is the most vigorous ; but this circumstance is 
comparatively rare.
If the two buds of the vine develope into branch- 
es in the same season, there is no mutual interference ; but in the 
case of the locust-tree, it is quite otherwise, and if both were to con- 
tinue to grow for a few years, they would be incorjjorated together.
The succession bud of Fuchsia may be nothing more than an axillary 
shoot from the base of the axillary flowering branch ; or if otherwise, 
may not be visible (that is, not in existence as a bud) at the time when 
the bud of the flowering branch first becomes apparent.
Lateral buds 
are not confined to the axillae of leaves, and there may be successive 
formation as well as successive development of axillary buds : but 
whenever this takes place, it may be expected to occur above rather 
than below the first-formed bud ; quite the reverse of what happens in 
the locust-tree, where the second and third buds below the first or 
principal bud, are in a condition to replace immediately the one which 
is first developed, in the event of its failure.

Note on Villarsia nymph ceoides.
Having seen in ' The Phy- 
tologist,' several stations for Villarsia nympliEeoides in Middlesex 
(Phytol.

I have seen it grow- 
ing plentifully near Isleworth ferry, in the ditch between the park and 
the Thames.

409- Note on Impatiens fulva.
In addition to the several stations 
mentioned for Impatiens fulva (Phytol.
63), I may name three others, 
where I have seen it growing this season.
The first is near Barnes, 
in a marsh between the road and the Thames, but it is not plentiful.
The second is near Isleworth, on the right hand side of the road to 
Twickenham, in a ditch that runs across the field, where it is abun- 
dant.
The third is near Hounslow, where it grows about the sides of 
some ponds near the mills.

Note on Fritillaria Meleagris.
It may be interesting to some 
of your readers, especially Mr. Edwards (Phytol.
580), to know that 
this pretty plant and early ornament of our meadows, produced its 
drooping flowers in abundance last April, in the locality mentioned 
by Mr. E., half way between Mortlake and Kew bridge; but I am 
sorry to say that too many of the radical botanists visited this station 
during the time it was in flower; such hands prove more destructive 
than the Mortlake children, even supposing they do pull off the flow- 
ers to ornament their May-garlands.

Note on Aspidium spinulosum.
I am sorry to differ from Mr.
Bree in respect to his observations on Aspidium spinulosum (Phytol.
773), more particularly his remark " that the application of the speci- 
fic name of spinulosum to a British fern (first adopted, I believe, by 
Smith and Sowerby in * English Botany') originated in error." The 
error will, I think, rest with the continental botanists, beginning with 
Willdenow, who applied this name to a plant differing from the species 
so named by Muller in ' Flora Danica.' This author first introduced 
our plant in his ' Flora Fridichsdalina,' published in 1767, as a vari- 
ety of Polypodium Filix-femina : becoming editor of the ' Flora Da- 
nica,' he figured it in that work.
No. 707, under the name of Polypo- 
dium spinulosum.
Withering was the first English author who 
noticed it : my excellent friend, the late James Dickson, refenred to 
by Mr. Bree, was, I believe, acquainted with the plant, but has no- 
where published it.
Withering was followed by Hull and Symons ; 
Smith, changing the generic name to Aspidium, described it in 1804, 
in his 'Flora Britannica' (vol.
iii.), well observing, â€” ^^ Distinct a 
species a CL Witheringio bene elucidata^ By this it will appear 
815 
evident that Smith and Sowerby did not Jirst adopt it in ' English 
Botany,' but that in 1805 they figured a fern sent them by Mackay, 
of which he has stated, in ' Flora Hibernica,' that after cultivation it 
assumed the character of A.
dilatatum.
Had it not come from a ca- 
vern where A.
spinulosura was not likely to grow, I should have 
thought it might be an indifferent figure of a bad specimen of that 
species, the pinnulae being equal ; as Mr. Mackay unites the two 
plants, it is not easy to ascertain what character of A.
dilatatum he 
means to say it assumed.
It is evident the A.
spinulosum of Willde- 
now is a different species, and I wish Mr. Bree's supposition that it 
is his A.
recui*vum, may prove correct.
I gathered this plant in Corn- 
wall, I think in 1791, certainly not later than 1802, for I have not 
been in that county since^ â€” Edward Forster ; Woodford, November 
9, 1843.

Note on Sonchus oleraceus and S.
asper.
Mr. G.
S. Gibson 
has kindly pointed out to me an error concerning these plants in my 
* Manual,' which is of so much consequence that I hasten to publish 
it.
It is Sonchus oleraceus that has the fruit transversely rugose 
combitied with arrow-shaped auricles to the leaves.
In S.
asper the 
fruit is longitudinally ribbed but smooth, not transversely rugose.
Allow me to express a hope that if other errors are obseved by those 
who may make use of my book, they will favour me by communicat- 
ing them, â€” Charles C.

Note on Cynosurus echinatus.
In reference to Mr. Edmon- 
ston's note on Cynosurus echinatus (Phytol.
772), I beg to say that I 
found only three roots of that plant in the Vale of the Calder.
I met 
with them about half a mile from Sowerby bridge ; two of them were 
beautifully in flower, these I took up to make specimens of; the other 
was in a young state, this I took up also, and have it now living : one 
of the others I have given away.
A single plant of Cynosurus echi- 
natus has been found this season at Ash-grove, about four miles from 
the place where I found those alluded to above.
I have a specimen 
of this grass from the south of England, and another from the conti- 
nent ; these two specimens are identical, and both have a very dense 
ovate spike, which is covered with a very fine white silvery substance.
The Ash-grove plant (which is now in my possession) is far more ro- 
bust than the specimen from the south of England, its spike being 
two and a half inches long and about one and a quarter in breadth, 
and is somewhat interrupted in its lower part : it also differs in hav- 
ing only about half the number of glumes on its outer spikelets, and 
816 
in the absence of the silvery substance which is so conspicuous in the 
other two.
By this it would appear that we have two distinct plants 
under this name ; but on turning to my Sowerby-bridge specimen, I 
iind it to correspond with the Ash-grove plapt in its long and some- 
what interrupted spike, and with my south of England specimen in 
having the silvery-looking substance, but in a less degree.
Since I find 
such different forms in the few specimens which I possess, I shall risk 
no opinion as to their specific identity, but if Mr. Edmonston would 
wish to see any of (or all) the specimens I have alluded to, I shall take 
pleasure in giving him the loan of them for a short time.
In addi- 
tion to the above I might say that on looking over the grasses in the 
collection of Samuel Hailstone, Esq., I observe some south of Er^- 
land specimens of Cynosurus echinatus, which are identical with my 
own from that part.

Note on Poa maritima.
Whilst on the subject of grasses I 
would just say that if any of your correspondents could furnish me 
with a specimen of the Poa maritima which has " the branches of the 
panicle smooth," as stated Phytol.
294, they would bestow a favour 
on me.

The following papers were read : â€” " On the Botany of

The Chairman presented a series of specimens of the common birch, in order to 
show that the forms described by different authors, under the names of Betula alba, 
pendula, glutinosa and pubescens, are only varieties of one single species â€” the origi- 
nal Betula alba of Linnaeus.
Mr. Watson stated that he had repeatedly found upon 
different branches of the same tree, the various forms of leaf and other characters which 
were given as the distinctions between these supposed species ; and that the leaves of 
Betula glutinosa or pubescens were produced usually (if not always) on the seedling 
plants of Betula alba or pendula.
Specimens of Primula elatior from the Bardfield station were presented by Mr. E.
Doubleday.
These specimens were remarkable for the wide variation in the relative 
length of the calyx and corolla, and also in the forin of the leaves ; some specimens 
resembling the primrose in their tapering leaves, while others had the abruptly con- 
tracted leaves similar to those of the cowslip.
Specimens of Barkhausia setosa were exhibited, one of which was presented by Mr.
Cumming in 1841, collected by him at Audley End, Essex, the other was presented 
by Mr. G.

â€” Notice of a Visit to Black Notletj, Essex, the 
birth-place and residence of John Ray. By Joshua Clarke 
and G.
S. Gibson, Esqs.
It was on a hazy morning in July that we started from Saffron 
Walden on a botanical excursion, undertaken chiefly with the view 
to visit the tomb of John Ray, and to explore the village which de- 
rives its interest and celebrity from having been the birth-place of 
that illustrious man, and his residence during a considerable portion 
of his life.
The first object of Natural History to be mentioned on the jour- 
ney is, that at a short distance from the village of Sampford we ob- 
served the Cuscuta which has lately been so destructive to clover 
(Phytol.
753), committing great ravages in a field of that plant ; and 
we have since been informed that it has destroyed about one fourth 
of the crop.
There is no doubt of its having been introduced with 
foreign clover-seed, but whether it be a variety of C.
Epithymum or 
a distinct species, does not appear to be fully ascertained.
It is a 
plant of more vigorous growth, spreading itself in circular patches, 
from four to ten feet in diameter.
The village of Sampford is an excellent locality for Liliura Marta- 
gon, where it now appears to be truly wild, both in a hedge and wood 
in the neighbourhood.
Seeing some fine ones in blossom in a cottage 
garden, we asked the owner where he procured them ; and the reply 
given was that he dug them up from a hedge in the lane, where they 
grew plentifully.
He further stated that they had been there ever 
since he was a boy, probably about forty years.
Up this lane, which 
is bounded by high banks and old copse-like hedges, we gathered up- 
wards of a dozen specimens in flower, and left as many remaining.
Near the same village we likewise saw Ranunculus parviflorus, Petro- 
selinum segetum, Scirpus sylvaticus, and other plants.
Pursuing our 
journey, we noticed in the hedges near Dunmow, Ulmus major, whose 
reflexed branches, winged with corky excrescences, can scarcely fail 
to attract attention.
On a common by this town we gathered Anagal- 
lis tenella, Slum inundatum, Veronica scutellata, Mentha Pulegium, 
4 A 
818 
Peplis Portula, Nardus stricta, Agiostis puraila, Festuca bromoides 
&c., and further on the road GEnanthe Phellandrium.
In the centre 
of the pretty village of Saling stands a remarkably fine tree of Ulmus 
montana, var.
)S.
pendula, whose elegant form and gracefully pendu- 
lous branches lead one to express a regret that more of this fine tree 
are not planted instead of the commoner and inferior ones.
Doroni- 
cum plantagineum and Vinca minor grow near the village, and as we 
approached the town of Braintree, we gathered Dipsacus pilosus.
The village of Black Notley is situated about two miles from Brain- 
tree; it is a small, scattered, purely Essex village; as we approached 
it, the occasional gleams of the sun foretold a fine day, and added 
beauty and freshness to the quiet scene.
Although the village affords 
but one very poor inn, we sat down to a hearty breakfast, not prepared 
to quarrel with our provision or accommodation.
This over, we 
started forth to see and hear all we could regarding the illustrious 
Ray. Washington Irving remarks that " Genius seems to delight in 
hatching her offspring in bye corners." Ray was an exemplification 
of this ; he was born here in 1628, and is said to have been the son 
of a blacksmith, but of this we found no traditional evidence, neither 
could we learn where the original blacksmith's shop had stood ; the 
inhabitants speak of him as a very wonderful man who knew every- 
thing, and had travelled all over the world.
The church is an old plain tiled building, with rather a picturesque 
wooden spire, and stands in a delightfully rural situation.
The 
church-yard is a good-sized enclosure, planted with horse-chesnut 
and elm : in this retired spot, on the south side of the church, rest 
the mortal remains of the greatest of British naturalists.
The tomb 
is neat and handsome, of a pyramidical form, from ten to twelve feet 
high, and bearing an elaborate and appropriate Latin inscription.
This monument was erected by Compton, Bishop of London, one of 
Ray's cotemporaries, and about fifty years since was restored by Sir 
Thomas Gery Cullum, and is now in excellent preservation.
The house in which Ray is said to have lived, stands on a hill about 
half a mile from the church, and is now used as a farm-house, but the 
present inhabitants could give us no information, and seemed not at 
all aware that they were treading the same boards as were trodden by 
the great Ray, or looking on the same fields and trees as he once ad- 
mired.
Adjoining the meadow below the house is a garden, which 
still bears the name of " Ray's Orchard." It is now held by an octo- 
genarian market-gardener, who appeared to possess much of the an- 
cient simple but genuine hospitality, and who was much pleased to 
819 
point out to us an old pear-tree, which tradition says was planted by 
Ray ; its hollow trunk bears evident marks of great age, but the tree 
still retains considerable vigour, and yields an abundant crop.
As the day proved delightfully fine, we rambled about to notice the 
Natural History of the village ; and although we did not find any- 
thing very rare, yet every object seemed to derive additional interest 
from its locality.
A quiet little stream glides noiselessly through the 
meadows below the church, and on the opposite side of it is a pictur- 
esque wood.
Near the former we observed the willow-wren [Sylvia 
Trochilus), the lesser whitethroat [S.
Curruca)^ the blackcap iS.
atri- 
capilla) and the nightingale [S.
Luscinia).
The banks of the stream 
abound with several species of Libellula.
In the meadows and ad- 
joining wood we saw the speckled wood butterfly {Hipparchia Mge- 
ria), Argynnis Paphia, Vanessa Polychloros, V.
16, Polyommatus 
Alexis, Pamphila sylvanus, &c.
Among the plants noticed were Ranunculus arvensis, Reseda Lute- 
ola, Scleranthus annuus, Cerastium aquaticum, Malva moschata, Eu- 
onymus europaeus.
Genista tinctoria, Trifolium ochroleucum, Pyrus 
communis, Sison Amomum, Torilis infesta.
Viburnum Opulus, Peta- 
sites vulgaris, Pyrethrum Parthenium, Campanula hybrida, Lycopus 
europaeus, Mentha sylvestris, Chenopodium polyspermum, Tamus 
communis, Carex pendula.
Milium effusum, Melica uniflora, Festuca 
loliacea, Polystichum aculeatum, &c.
After having finished our ramble, and having partaken of such pro- 
vision as the inn afforded, we set out on our return home, thus con- 
cluding a very agreeable and interesting excursion to a spot, which 
must be deemed by every naturalist to possess something of a sacred 
character.
And although the labours of Ray are little known in his 
native village, it is pleasing to reflect that by the public generally his 
works are increasingly valued.
We cannot perhaps better conclude this notice of our excursion 
than with the following brief sketch of the life and works of John Ray.
Ray was born in 1628; and although his father was in so low a sta- 
tion of life, he contrived to give him a liberal education.
He was sent 
when young to the grammar-school at Braintree, and afterwards en- 
tered Trinity College, Cambridge, where, in 1649, he obtained a fel- 
lowship, and took the degree of Master of Arts.
In 1651 he was 
appointed Greek Lecturer, and in 1667 was elected Member of the 
Royal Society.
The work by which he is best known to the public, 
is his ' Wisdom of God in Creation,' an original and extraordinary 
work in its day, and one replete with philosophical detail, which 
820 
breathes in no ordinary degree the spirit of Christian piety ; and it is 
gratifying to see how, as knowledge has increased, his ideas of Natu- 
ral Theology, in connexion with Natural History, have been carried 
out, first by Derham in 1720, then by Paley, and in the present day 
by the Bridgwater Treatises, MacCulloch, and others.
His works on Botany are numerous and extensive.
He was un- 
questionably the first who reduced that science to system, and thus 
paved the way for the immortal Swede ; he found Nature a trackless 
wilderness, but his genius and perseverance reduced it to order, me- 
thod, and systematic arrangement.
Linnaeus truly characterises his 
' Hiatoria Plantarum,' as "opus immensi laboris." Sir J.
E. Smith 
observes, â€” "Of all the systematical and practical Floras of any coun- 
try, Ray's ' Synopsis ' is the most perfect that has ever come under 
our observation.
He examined every plant recorded in this work, 
and even gathered most of them himself.
He investigated their sy-- 
nonymes with consummate accuracy, and if the clearness and preci- 
sion of other authors had equalled his, he would scarcely have com- 
mitted an error." His publications on the various departments of 
Zoology have established his high reputation as a philosophical natu- 
ralist.
His ' History of Insects,' Mr. Haworth observes, is a master- 
piece of clearness and precision.
He was an intimate friend of Wil- 
lughby, with whom he travelled through the Low Countries, Germany, 
Italy, &c., and subsequently assisted him to arrange his collections 
in all the various branches of Natural History.
After the premature 
death of his friend, Ray acted as tutor to his children, with whom he 
resided for some time.
But this excellent and admirable man appears 
to have spent many of his last years in his secluded native village, 
retaining his intellect to the last, and dying in 1705, at the age of se- 
venty-seven.
Ray was a man whose whole life is to be admired.
Even amid the 
ardour with which he prosecuted his scientific studies, he appears al- 
ways to have kept in view this noble object, the advancement of the

â€” On the Varieties of Betula alba of Linneeus, de- 
scribed as distinct Species by some authors.* By Hewett C.
Watson, Esq., F.L.S.
There is, perhaps, in the present day, scarcely any circumstance 
more calculated to impede the progress of botanical science, and 
to throw difficulties in the path of the younger botanist, than the 
growing fondness for changing names, and for inventing species in 
books which have really no distinct existence in natm'e.
I believe 
that it would be no exaggeration of the number of these spurious spe- 
cies now enumerated in the descriptive Floras of Britain, if I were to 
estimate them at about two hundred.
But in the present paper my 
remarks will be restricted to those imaginary species which have been 
carved out of our common birch, the Betula alba of Linnaeus.
When the last volume of Smith's ' English Flora ' was published, 
in the year 1828, this tree was described as a single species under the 
name of Betula alba.
But the author of that still valuable work did 
slightly mention a pendulous variety, which had been published in 
Germany, as a distinct species, under the name of Betula pendula.
And in the various editions of the ' British Flora,' we find the autho- 
rity of Sir W.
J. Hooker added to that of Sir J.
E. Smith ; since the 
latter work still describes the birch-ti*ee as one species only, though 
stating, in the last edition (1842), that the name of B.
glutinosa 
appeared in the ' Edinburgh Catalogue,' as if belonging to a distinct 
species.
In Lindley's ' Synopsis of the British Flora,' which followed shortly 
upon the completion of the ' English Flora,' we find the pendulous 
form described as a distinct species, under the name of Betula pen- 
dula.
Both.
In the second edition of the Catalogue published by the Botanical 
Society of Edinburgh, in 1841, the views of Dr. Lindley are not re- 
cognized ; his species, Betula pendula, being enumerated only as a 
variety of B.
alba.
To compensate this reduction of one pretended 
species from the number, another was found, and introduced into the 
Catalogue under the name of B.
glutinosa, Wallr.
In that capital work, the recently published ' Manual of British 
Botany,' by Mr. C.
C. Babington, Dr. Lindley's B.
pendula is at last 
utterly cashiered, being not even given as a variety.
But to make up 
* Read before the Botanical Society of London, November 3, 1843 ; communicated 
1)V the author.
822 
for the omission of this variety (allowed by the same author, two years 
before, in the ' Edinburgh Catalogue') we now find in the ' Manual ' 
another variety, not of B.
alba, but of B.
glutinosa, introduced under 
the name of " pubescens." 
Thus, taking the Floras together, we have three species of birch- 
tree â€” B.
alba, B.
pendula and B.
glutinosa ; the last of these three 
being subdivided into the typical (usually glabrous) form and the va- 
riety pubescens.
In this medley of contradictory views, I hold that 
Smith and Hooker are correct, in describing only one species ; and 
that Lindley's B.
pendula, and Babington's B.
glutinosa, are merely 
forms of that one species, the Betula alba of Linnaeus.
Dr. Lindley's name stands very high among botanists, and deserv- 
edly so, but his botanical reputation has never been considered to rest 
on any skill in the discrimination and determination of species ; and 
since both Hooker and Babington have thought fit to reject B.
pen- 
dula, we may safely pass it over at present, as a mere book-species.
Betula glutinosa and its variety pubescens, still remain open for in- 
vestigation.
In the Manual, we are told that B.
alba is readily dis- 
tinguished from B.
glutinosa " by its leaves, but more certainly by its 
fruit." The difference between the leaves of the two is thus stated: â€” 
B. alha.
â€” " Leaves rhomboid-triangular douWy serrate acuminate." 
B. glutinosa.
â€” " Leaves cordate-ovate unequally serrate acute." 
This reads very satisfactory on paper, and may appear equally sa 
in small specimens for the herbarium.
Unfortunately, however, for 
this ready distinction of the species, while old trees, with pendulous 
branches, are clothed with leaves exactly corresponding with this de- 
scription of the leaves of Betula alba, the seedling plants which spring 
up underneath them, produce cordate and pubescent leaves.
The old 
trees are thus B.
alba, while their young progeny are B.
glutinosa 
variety pubescens.
Moreover, I have repeatedly seen, on the same 
single tree, that the upper and drooping branches bore the rhomboid 
leaves of B.
alba, while the lower ascending or nearly horizontal 
branches were clothed with the cordate-ovate leaves said to be cha- 
racteristic of B.
glutinosa.
And still, on the same trees, I have occa- 
sionally observed completely cordate and pubescent leaves, like those 
of the seedling plants, produced on suckers from the root, on soft 
shoots near the base of the old trunk, on late autumnal branchlets, 
and on those fast-growing shoots which push out where branches 
have been lopped.
The serratures of the leaves are equally variable as their forms, and 
doubly serrate leaves may be seen growing on the same tree with un- 
823 
equally serrate leaves.
And I fear that the fruit is not a whit more 
constant to the characters given for these supposed species.
In the 
Manual, we have the characters of the fruit described thus : â€” 
B.alba.
â€” " Fruit obovate-elliptical shorter than the rounded memhranous margin." 
B.glutinosa.
â€” " Fruit broadly obovate as long as the rounded membranous margin." 
The difference of form between "obovate-elliptical" and "broadly 
obovate " is not great; and I have seen still wider differences in form, 
even on the very same tree ; and such differences may readily be found 
in the fruit of trees whose leaves are undistinguishable in their form 
and serratures.
I have also seen the fruit of B.
glutinosa (namely, of 
trees with cordate-ovate leaves) shorter than its membranous margin, 
and that of B.
alba (namely, of trees with rhomboid leaves), equalling 
or longer than the margin.
In conclusion, therefore, I boldly assert, in contradiction to the 
belief of Mr. Babington, that Betula alba and B.
glutinosa are not 
only one single species, but are often undistinguishable as varieties, 
since both forms may appear on different branches of the same single 
tree.

Art. CLXXXVIâ€” ^ Few Days in Suffolk.
By W.
L. Notcutt, Esq.
Having read with much interest the various details of botanical 
excursions which have from time to time appeared in 'The Phytolo- 
gist,' it has occurred to me that a few particulars respecting the results 
of a short visit which I paid to Ipswich and the neighbourhood dur- 
ing a part of the month of June last, might not be unacceptable, es- 
pecially as the floral riches of the county of Suffolk are by no means 
despicable.
I reached Ipswich on the 1 3th of June, and on the fol- 
lowing day wended my way by the side of the Gipping, with the view 
of ascertaining what it might afford in the way of Botany.
The first 
plants worth notice which caught my eye were Thalictrum flavum 
Lythrum Salicaria and Angelica sylvestris, growing most luxuriantlv 
by the sides of the neighbouring ditches, but none of them as yet in 
blossom.
A little further on were a few specimens of Hippuris vul- 
garis growing near the side of the river, while, nearer the centre of the 
stream, some fine plants of Nuphar lutea were displaying their beau- 
tiful flowers.
On crossing a grass-field, a broad stagnant ditch af- 
forded me Hydrocharis Morsus-ranae, Lemna polyrhiza (the purple 
underside of which contrasts beautifully with the pale green of the 
824 
upper surface), Hotionia palustris and Nuphar lutea again.
In re- 
turning to Ipswich but little worthy of note offered.
The sides of the 
ditches were richly bedecked with the common, though not on that 
account the less beautiful, Myosotis palustris, while Anthriscus vul- 
garis and Silybum Marianum were plentiful by road-sides.
On a 
wall in the London road was formerly a habitat (I believe the only 
one in the neighbourhood) for Geranium lucidum ; but though anx- 
iously looked for, not a single specimen was this year to be found.
On the 15th the beautiful morning tempted me to direct my steps 
to Freston tower, a picturesque spot about four miles down the Orwell.
At Bowen-bridge, two miles from Ipswich, Beta maritima and Statice 
Limonium were growing sparingly.
A little on the hedge-banks be- 
yond the Ostrich, the rare Turritis glabra was growing in moderate 
quantity : this is, I believe, its only locality near Ipswich.
On the 
opposite side of the road was plenty of Festuca bromoides, while at a 
little distance, the salt marsh at the side of the river was carpeted with 
a rich display of the beautiful blossoms of Armeria maritima.
On as- 
cending the hill leading to the tower, a fine specimen or two of Po- 
tentilla [argentea ?] presented themselves, while in the neighbouring 
corn-fields the beautiful though evanescent blossoms of Erodium 
cicutarium, which was growing in great luxuriance and abundance, 
could not fail to strike the eye : I had also the pleasure of gathering 
on this spot some good specimens of Thlaspi arvense.
I remember 
hearing an experienced botanist remark, with regard to this plant, 
that he had never found it for two successive years in the same place; 
even when he had met with it in some abundance, it was probably not 
to be seen in the same place again for some time afterwards.
I have 
had but two opportunities of watching the plant, and so far as my ob- 
servation goes, the above remark holds good.
If it is correct, it is a 
curious fact ; what is the cause of it ?
In a meadow below the tower 
I have formerly gathered Orchis Morio in plenty; and in Freston 
wood, Lysimachia nemorum and the two Chrysosplenia used to be 
found, but I was too late for them this year.
" Portman's walks " and its neighbourhood, close to Ipswich, af- 
ford several interesting plants.
In the ditches were fine specimens 
of Butomus umbellalus, which is a rare plant about Ipswich, though 
it grows in several spots.
In the farther part of the walks Thlaspi 
arvense used to grow, and here I have formerly gathered the finest 
specimens I ever saw ; this year not a vestige of it was to be seen.
The same may be said of Leonurus Cardiaca and Delphinium Conso- 
lida, the latter of which, I recollect, ten or eleven years ago, used to 
825 
grow in splendid profusion at the top of the hedge-banks.
Saponaria 
officinalis still grows here in plenty, but has double flowers.
Turn- 
ing from the walks towards the salt river, Samolus Valerandi makes 
its appearance in the ditches, while by their sides gi'ows Thalictrum 
flavum in abundance.
A little further on is Lepidium latifolium in 
profusion by the side of the " Shoulder-of-mutton pond." Returning 
to Stoke bridge, I looked along the new embankment formed by the 
side of the wet dock, thinking that perhaps among the newly-exposed 
gravel, something of interest might have sprung up, and was much 
pleased in gathering Lepidium ruderale, a plant I had never met with 
before within twelve miles of Ipswich.
On the 17th a stroll to the race-ground and the decoy-ponds af- 
forded me Arenaria rubra, Anthemis arvensis, Aira caryophyllea, Ca- 
rex ovalis, Juncus squarrosus, Ornithopus perpusillus and Festuca 
myurus ; had time permitted, I have no doubt that many more inte- 
resting plants would have rewarded my researches.
On the 19th I left Ipswich for Felixtow, a small village on the Suf- 
folk coast, which presents many interesting features to the botanist.
It is about twelve miles from Ipswich, and the neighbourhood will 
amply repay an industrious search, I sj^ent part of two or three days 
in investigating that part of the coast which lies between Felixtow 
and Landguard fort, at the entrance of the Orwell, and just opposite 
Harwich.
The first plant which attracts attention is Ammophila are- 
naria, which abounds on the sandy ground in front of the hotel, and 
amongst it is Schlerochloa maritima, and fine specimens of Convol- 
vulus Soldanella in profusion.
About a mile from Felixtow, Festuca 
uniglumis and Carex arenaria appear in the sand; while on the sandy 
plain at the back of the beach, Phleum arenarium abounds, and asso- 
ciated with it is Valerianella dentata, var.
/3.
mixta, though but spar- 
ingly.
Close at hand is a Martello tower, and here we begin to meet 
with Trifolium suffocatum, Medicago minima, Geranium pusillum, 
Trifolium scabrum, and the beautiful white-flowered variety of Erodi- 
um cicutarium.
From this place to Landguard fort, the two former 
plants are so abundant, that many parts of the green sward are com- 
posed of scarcely anything else ; and should they be desiderata with 
any of your correspondents, I shall be happy, if my life is spared, to 
supply any of them with specimens next season, if they will intimate 
their wishes to me in time.
On the right of the town is a salt marsh, 
nearly covered with Halimus portulacoides, and in front lies Land- 
guard fort.
On the sandy point to the left of the fort we meet with 
Euphorbia Favali^^s, Glaucium luteum, Adenarium peploidos, Silene 
826 
maritima and Eryngium maritimuin ; and Landguard fort itself is one 
of the reputed stations for Tamarix anglica, although I must confess 
that there is no appearance of its being truly wild.
It is very abun- 
dant, for there are whole hedges of it on the grounds of the fort, and 
within the fortifications there are some very fine and aged tamarisk 
trees, the branches of which are supported by props.
One of the lar- 
gest trees 1 measured, and found its circumference to be six feet three 
inches.
On that part of the coast which lies between Felixtow and 
Bawdsey-ferry, at the entrance of the river Deben, I was surprised to 
find that the encroachments of the sea had swept away most of the 
plants which 1 used to find there, such as Salsola Kali, Cakile mari- 
tima, Atriplex laciniata, &c.
Near Sir S.
Fludyer's were some fine 
plants of Koniga maritima, which, however, had doubtless escaped 
from the garden.
Here likewise are abundance of tamarisk trees, but 
all are planted, and have been raised from those at Landguard fort.
On the sandy common forming the corner of the land at Bawdsey- 
feny, Medicago minima, Trifolium suffocatum and T.
scabrum are 
again plentiful ; and, growing among them, the pretty Sedum angli- 
cum is fi-equent.
Within the enclosure of a sunken bastion.
Salvia 
verbenaca and Trifolium ornithopodioides were growing, as was Car- 
duus tenuiflorus on the common.
On the opposite side of the Deben 
we gathered Eryngium maritimum, Koeleria cristata, Salsola Kali, 
Atriplex laciniata and Carex divisa.
Returning to Felixtow by 
the fields, I had an active search for Agrostis Spica-venti, which I 
formerly found in a corn-field close to the terrace, but I was much 
disappointed in not meeting with a single specimen.
However, I 
was somewhat rewarded for the vexation by finding in a hedge not far 
ofi", some most luxuriant plants of Fumaria capreolata, the cream-co- 
loured blossoms of which, with their dark purple tips, were remarka- 
bly attractive and beautiful.
My paper has already extended to such 
a length, that I must only remark that a walk to Walton-ferry afforded 
me Lathyrus Nissolia in profusion.
Geranium pyrenaicum, Hyoscya- 
mus niger.
Ranunculus sceleratus and Vicia sativa, var.
^. angustifo- 
lia.
Thus ended my Suffolk trip, and I should be very happy if the 
detail of my researches should afford your readers a tithe of the plea- 
sure in the perusal which the recollections and associations it brings 
to mind while writing it give to me.

the Summer of 1843.
By Joseph Woods, Esq., F.L.S.
(Continued from page 801).
On the 19th I went to Fontainebleau, on what turned out to be a 
thoroughly wet day.
I left the diligence at Chailly, following the di- 
rections given to me by M.
de Jussieu.
The landlady there charged 
me four francs for my breakfast, under the pretence that she had 
given me a bottle of old Burgundy.
In general I find the people very 
honest and moderate in their charges in the French villages and small 
towns â€” this was an exception.
829 
I left the high road on the right, and after crossing some corn-fields 
and a small wood, followed the direction of a sharp brow in the forest 
where the sandstone is much quarried, to the Belle Croix, sometimes 
dipping into the valley beneath, to see if any plants were to be found 
differing from those above.
The crest is rocky, the valley, or at least 
the lower part of the slope, is of loose sand, but the best Botany is 
on the crest.
The position of some of the plants the most peculiar to 
Fontainebleau, is very curious.
The forest exhibits a remarkable de- 
velopment of a tertiary sandstone, of which the harder parts form a 
rocky crest to the hills.
On the top of these rocks are hollows often 
containing water.
These pools do not perhaps occupy a fourth part 
of the surface which drains into them, but it is a surface of rock either 
naked, or very slightly covered with a dark heathy soil, and there is 
no drainage from the general surface of the hill.
I think the best pools, 
some of them perhaps hardly a yard square, are where the supplying 
surface has not sufficient soil to support anything but a few mosses 
and lichens, or where a gi'eat part of it is naked.
It will easily be 
conceived that in such circumstances the water, in fine weather, be- 
comes very warm.
In summer a great deal of this dries up, but there 
still remain deep hollows, whose area, instead of occupying a fourth, 
is reduced to a twentieth of the receiving surface, and here the plants 
find a refuge.
In these little pools we find great abundance of Bul- 
liarda Vaillantii and Ranunculus nodiflorus, two plants which are 
hardly found, or are extremely rare elsewhere.
Delphinium Consoli- 
da, which is common in the corn through great part of France, was 
coming into flower, and Medicago apiculata had sufficiently formed 
its very characteristic legumes.
Veronica spicata begins to exhibit 
its spikes ; V.
verna is pretty well over.
Festuca uniglumis is abun- 
dant in the loose sandy parts, Cynanchum Vincetoxicum everywhere; 
and so is Asperula tinctoria in this part of the forest, although it is a 
plant generally rare.
Fedia carinata and olitoria have made way for 
F. auricula, which is now the predominant species.
The other plants 
were : â€” 
Trifolium rubens Phalangium ramosum Galium Iseve 
Genista sagiltalis [there Sedum villosum Inula hirta 
Orchis ustulata, here and Tillfea niuscosa Gypsophila muralis 
Phyteuma orbiculare Helianthemum umhellatum Lychnis viscaria 
Campanula persicifolia out of flower Phalangium Liliago 
Geranium sanguineum Orohus niger Ranunculus Chsrophyllus 
Glohularia vulgaris Vicia lutea Thesium intermedium ?
Epipactis Nidus-avis Trifolium striotum Dianthus carthusianorum 
In the latter part of ray walk I met with Sesleria carulea.
â€” 
830 
This plant is abundant on the limestones of the North of England, 
but does not occur, so far as I know, on those of South Wales or of the 
West of England.
It is not met with on our chalk hills, but is abun- 
dant on those about Rouen.
At Dreux, still on the chalk hills, it is 
scarce.
The station at Fontainebleau belongs, I think, to the calca- 
reous beds overlying the sandstone.
The * Flore du centre de la 
France^ by A.
Boreau, gives habitats still more to the south.
The 20th was fair, though cloudy ; but the rain of yesterday, fol- 
low^ed by a wet night, had left both grass and woods full of water.
Still following the advice of M.
de Jussieu, I set out through the gar- 
dens of the chateau to reach the Mail de Henri Quatre.
T went up a 
ridge of baiTen hills on the left, which I erroneously supposed to be 
connected with the Mail, but found nothing on them.
Afterwards, 
not understanding what was meant by the word Mail, I crossed it 
without knowing, still supposing the term to belong to a crest of rocks 
beyond me.
However, I gathered in crossing it most of the plants 
which are said to be found on the Mail, viz., Ononis Columnae, Are- 
naria triflora (a variety of A.
grandiflora according to Duby), Helian- 
themum apenninum and Fumana (or procumbens), and Teucrium 
montanum.
On leaving the Mail and crossing to the opposite crest, I found 
there abundance of those small mares or pools, but the only rare 
plant in them was Ranunculus tripartitus.
Some tufts of this species 
growing quite out of the water, although this was high from the late 
rains, producing hardly any but the capillary leaves, and completely 
covered with flowers, were very beautiful.
On a later occasion, the 
5th of August, I met with abundance of Elatine hexandra in these 
pools.
Thence I descended into a large barren plain â€” Plaine du 
Chene BruU â€” which is crossed by the road to Lyon, where I added 
Ranunculus gramineus and Scorzonera austriaca to my collections, 
but unfortunately both completely out of flower, and almost losing 
their seeds.
Here also grow Trifolium montanum, Alyssum monta- 
num, Epilobiura angustifolium, Lactuca perennis and Teucrium mon- 
tanum.
Other plants in this part, which are generally diffused in the 
forest, are the following.
Trinia glaberrima Viola canina, var.

Ruhus plicatus Helianthemum guttatum plant with us 
Veronica Teucrium Plantago areuaria Arenaria setacea 
Genista pilosa Linum tenuifolium 
The Orobanches were very abundant and in good condition, but I 
831 
was not able to do much in determining the species.
Koch, and af- 
ter him Babington, depend much upon the nerves of the sepals, but 
of the species described by the former writer, as having only one or 
two nerves, I know nothing ; and all our difficulties lie with the ma- 
ny-nerved species.
Babington indeed gives to O.
rubra only a single 
nerve, but he cites, though with a mark of doubt, Koch's O.
epithy- 
mum ; and Koch cites, under = O.
epithymum, the figure of O.
rubra 
in ' English Botany,' but with the addition â€” pessima, in which every- 
body will agree with him.
As far, however, as it is possible to judge 
from such a figure, I should say that O.
rubra and O.
epithymum can- 
not be the same.
In the O.
epithymum of Fontainebleau, the nerva- 
ture of the calyx is the same as in its allied species, that is, a distinct 
nerve to each division, and smaller lateral nerves or veins ; I may say 
the same of a specimen of O.
rubra from Staffa, given to me, I be- 
lieve, by Mr. J.
Hooker, now Dr. Hooker.
I can make little more of 
the insertion of the stamens, which is always near and never at the 
base of the corolla.
The hairiness or villosity (without glands) at 
the inner base of the filaments, may serve to separate O.
major fi'om 
other species, and O.
concolor has only scattered hairs.
In amethys- 
tea these hairs are very short and close, and limited in their extent.
All the species seem subject to have glandular hairs upon the upper 
part of the anthers and of the styles, which, in the latter part, some- 
times extend on to the germen.
The yellow stigma is perhaps of 
importance, but unfortunately we lose this in drying.
I have given 
on the next page a few forms of corolla, which perhaps are as useful 
as most points in determining the species.
1. O.
major.
Fontainebleau, on broom.
Stigmas yellow.
2. O.
cruenta.
Dreux, on Hippocrepis comosa.
3. O.
caryophyllea.
Fontainebleau.
Flowers nearly pink : stig- 
mas purple.
4. O.
caryophyllea f Orleans, growing among grass and bushes.
It had the clove smell, but this is occasionally met with in se- 
veral species.
5. O.
epithymum.
Fontainebleau, on Thymus Serpyllum.
Stig- 
mas purple.
I could always readily distinguish this by the 
strong venation of the petals, but the veins were marked in co- 
lour rather than in substance, and have disappeared in drying.
The upper lip was sometimes cloven, sometimes entire, and 
even now and then trifid.
6. O.
minor.
From near Guildford.
7. O.
amethystea.
Blois, on Eryngium campestre.
Stigmas purple.
832 
A beautiful plant, easily known by its dense spikes and the long 
points of its bracteas and calyces.
8. O.
Jeucrii.
Fontainebleau, on Teucrium montanum and Cha- 
maedrys.
Snuff-coloured, nearly veinless.
The insertion of the 
stamens is higher than in O.
epithymum, and the lips of the co- 
rolla are more separate.
The botanists of Paris seem disposed 
to unite these species.
9. O.
concolor.
Fontainebleau.
Corolla and stigmas yellow.
I 
saw only two specimens, and could not ascertain to what plant 
they were attached.
They agreed perfectly with Boreau's de- 
scription, â€” 'Flore du Centre de la France,' p.
344.
1. Orobanche major.
2. O.
cruenta, 3, 0.
caryophyllea.
4. 0.
caryophyllea?
5. 0.
epithymum 
6. 0.
minor.
7. O.
amethystea.
8. O.
Teucrii.
9. O.

From this plain I again ascended a hill on the right of the road to 
Reclose, where I found abundance of Coronilla coronata and Linura 
tenuifolium : and passing that road and the hollow in which it runs, 
ascended the Rocher des Putaines, now more delicately called the 
Mocker des Demoiselles, on the top of which again are some mares, 
which were not productive.
Among these rocks, and in other similar 
places, I noticed Pyrus Aria, but did not fall in with any trees of P.
latifolia, which is said to occur in the forest, but which, however, from 
specimens in the French herbarium of the Jardin des Plantes, appears 
to be the same as P.
hybrida of the ' Flora Britannica,' 534.
On the 21st I set out on the road to Melun, and turning to the right 
examined a detached ridge, which, as usual where there are no mares 
833 
was unproductive ; and then descended towards the river.
The 
lower strata seem here to be chalky, and the Orchideae were abun- 
dant, chiefly about and beyond a little pool, where a by-road tmuis up 
from the river towards Samois.
They were Epipactis rubra in great 
beauty, E.
atropurpurea, Ophrys arachnites, O.
apifera, Listera ovata, 
Aceras anthropophora and Orchis pyramidalis, all growing together 
and abundant.
On a little hill descending from this pool, the banks 
were covered with Equisetum hyemale.
I did not find Euphorbia Lathyris, which is said to grow at Valvins.
In my way back I met with Althaea hirsuta.
Afterwards I climbed 
up a sandy ridge, the point de vue of Queen Amelia, and a very beau- 
tiful one it is, commanding a variety of rock and wood, of barren 
slopes and of the cultivated valley beneath.
The other more common 
plants of the walk were : â€” 
Monotropa Hypopitys Vicia lutea Sedura Cepaea 
Poa compressa Ajuga Chamaepitys Ornithogaluni pyrenaicum 
Festuca uniglumis Crepis tectorum Campanula persicifolia 
Rubus affinis Astragalus glycyphyllos Orobanche epithymuni 
Liuurn tenuifulium Gentiana cruciata, not in fl.
Plantago arenaria 
These were the three walks at Fontainebleau recommended by M.
de Jussieu, except that, omitting my earlier aberrations, T ought to 
have returned, after finding the Orchises, to the new bridge at La 
Madelaine, and crossed the Seine to the Bois de Champagne.
There 
is, however, a fourth walk to be made, which is very interesting: this 
is to Franchard, which I visited on the 22nd.
The multitude of rocks 
in this direction is very great, and they are so like each other, and so 
broken and irregular, that it is a perfect labyrinth, from which it is dif- 
ficult for a person unacquainted with the forest to extricate himself.
The directions, which are very numerous, often serve to increase the 
perplexity.
One finds, on coming into a beaten track, a post, on 
which is written, "Route allant a Fontainebleau," but nothing to mark 
in which direction Fontainebleau lies.
It is true that the post, in 
such a case, is usually put on that side of the cross road which is 
nearest the place specified, but it is not always so, and a person trust- 
ing to this rule might be sometimes wofully deceived.
Then we have 
" Route allant a la Route rond," which " route rond " forms a circle 
of considerable diameter, and one part might lie just in our way, and 
another very much out of it.
The best Botany on the road is, in 
general, not among the rocks, but on some dry and barren banks where 
the sandstone seems to be capped with a calcareous deposit.
Here 
grow : â€” 
4b 
834 
Trinia glalierrima Hypochaeris maculata Arenaria setacea 
Teucrinm montanum Epipactis rubra H elianthemum apenninum 
Ononis Columnae Euphorbia Esula H.
Fumana 
Inula birta 
About Franchard are numerous mares, as usual upon the top of the 
hill.
Tn one of these, beyond the Rocher qui pleure, I met with an 
abundance of Bulliarda: Ranunculus nodiflorus and Juncus pygmse- 
us also occur, and in the same neighbourhood likewise grows Elatine 
hexandra.
On a former occasion I recollect to have observed Pilula- 
ria.
In this part also, in the largest mare, and at a very short dis- 
tance from Franchard, Airopsis agrostidea is found, but I was too 
early to hope for it at this time, and on a later occasion (August 4th) 
I was equally unsuccessful.
The Rocher qui pleure is a rock hol- 
lowed out beneath, from which a few drops of water continually pro- 
ceed for the greater part of the year.
It is not easy to determine 
whence this water proceeds, as there seems but little extent at top 
from which it could receive supplies, and the small pools which ex- 
isted when I was there, would be dried up in a few days of fine wea- 
ther.
Opposite to this, on some rocks which are perhaps kept moist 
by some infiltration from the great mare, is Asplenium lanceolatum.
I was told, on what seemed competent authority, that the voiture 
(these small-stage carriages are not called diligences) set out for Male- 
sherbes at 5, at half-past 5 and at 6.
We started at ten minutes before 
6, (no proof that 6 was not the appointed hour), and reached Male- 
sherbes at 9.
and I found myself very comfortable at a little inn called 
I'Etoile, at the entrance of the town.

Art. CXCâ€” Notice of TJie Naturalists' Pocket Almanack for 1844.' 
London : John Van Voorst, Paternoster Row.
For the information of such of our readers as may not have formed 
an acquaintance with this useful little almanack during the first year 
4b 3 
836 
of its appearance, we may briefly state that in addition to the calen- 
dar, length of day, and the rising and setting of the sun and moon, 
the days and hours of meeting of the various scientific societies 
of the metropolis are regularly specified, together with short notices 
of the arrival and departure of birds, the flowering of plants, the ap- 
pearance of insects, and other interesting remarks relating to Natural 
History.
But the principal feature in the present year's almanack is 
the best and most compendious descriptive list of the British ferns and 
their allies that w^e have yet met with.
In the nomenclature of this 
list we observe several departures from that adopted by Mr. Babing- 
ton in his ' Manual of British Botany.' For instance, in the Equise- 
tums the nomenclature and arrangement proposed by Mr. Newman in 
our own pages are followed.
In the ferns we find some striking no- 
velties.
Among these is a full description of the involucre of Pteris : 
we quote the entire character of that genus.
"Pteris, Linnem.
â€” Mid-vein distinct, lateral veins anastomosing at margin 
-forming a marginal vein.
Involucre attached to inner side of marginal vein, linear, 
its margin split into capillary segments ; capsules attached in a linear series to margi- 
nal vein, exterior to involucre; epidermis prolonged bleached reflexed split into capil- 
lary segments and covering capsules in the manner of an involucre." â€” p.
11.
The second point to be noticed appears at first sight to be a daring 
innovation; on reflection, however, we feel inclined to admit it as be- 
ing a more natural arrangement than the old one.
We allude to the 
removal from the genus Polypodium of the species Dryopteris, calca- 
reum and Phegopteris, thus leaving Polypodium vulgare as the only 
British representative of its genus.
The three rejected species, toge- 
ther with Oreopteris and Thelypteris, form in the list the first division 
of Bory's genus, Lastrsea, characterized by having the " Clusters of 
capsules on all branches of lateral veins," not on the anterior branch 
only, as in Polypodium and Lastraea proper.
The next thing we 
shall notice is that the three plants Lastrsea spinosa, dilatata and re- 
curva are raised to the rank of species, and as such now described for 
the first time in an English work.
We quote the descriptions.
" 9.
X. spinosa (Roth).
Lastrcea dilatata linear type Newm 61 fig.
Bab 386.
Rhi- 
zoma very stout, slowly but extensively creeping ; stem as long as frond, clothed spar- 
ingly except at the base with broad rounded pale brotvn diaphanous scales; frond nearly 
erect, elongate linear pinnate, pinna rather distant (1 â€” 8 pairs of equal length, the 
lower pair neither longer nor shorter than the rest) winged pinnate ; pinnules at the base 
of pinnae separated from the midrib by a deep notch, toward the apex of pinnae decur- 
rent all lobed, the lobes serrated and spined ; divisions at apex of frond narrow, their 
terminations acute, all divisions of frond fiat ; involucre nearly circular, its margins 
waved not torn nor furnished u'ith teeth or stalked glands ; clusters of capsules circular 
837 
crowded, sometimes confluent, confined to the upper portion of the frond.
This com- 
mon fern was included by Linneus under his Polypodium cristatum, and by Muller in 
the ' Flora Danica ' under his P.
spinulosum, but the first intelligible description as a 
separate species is in Roth's ' Flora Germanica ; ' it is not the Aspidium spinulosum of 
Willdenow, Schkuhr, Decandolle, Smith, Hooker or Mackay, all of which are proba- 
bly referrible to the next species.
Common, marshes and woods ; in moist woods it 
is more luxuriant, only semierect, and has a somewhat different aspect.
Mature in 
September.
" 10.
L. dilatata (Hoffmann).
Newm 58 fig.
Bab 386, Aspidium spinulosum, dila- 
tatum and durrwtorum Sm iv 279, Aspid.
spinulosum Hook 440, Mack .340.
Rhizoma 
tufted ; stem very stout, nearly as long as frond, densely clothed with long pointed 
scales which are dark hroivn along the middle hut pale at the edges ; frond glandular very 
large deep green drooping ovate-lanceolate pinnate, lowest pair of pinnee shorter than 
2nd 3rd 4th or 5th, pinnae pinnate ; pinnules pinnate or pinnatifid, ultimate divisions 
serrated spined, all divisions of frond convex ; involucre nearly circular fringed with 
stalked glands ; clusters of capsules circular distinct covering every part of frond : ma- 
ture in September.
Common everywhere.
"11.
L. recurva (Bree).
L. dilatata concave type, Newm 61.
Rhizoma tufted; 
stem as long as frond woody clothed with long narrow laciniate scales ; frond triangu- 
lar drooping elegant pale green pinnate, lower pair of pinnae longest stalked, all pin- 
nate ; pinnules pinnate or pinnatifid, all divisions of frond concave ; involucre nearly 
circular ^a^^erf at its margin without stalked glands ; clusters of capsules round crowd- 
ed, covering every part of frond : mature in September.
Abundant in Ireland and 
Cornwall ; occurs in Cumberland, Devonshire, Sussex, &c." â€” p.
23.
In the genus Athyrium, the convex form of A.
Filix-femina appears 
as a species under the name of A.
rhaeticum of Roth, and, with a mark 
of doubt, as the Polypodium rhaeticum of Linnaeus ; a new species of 
Athyrium â€” the A.
molle of Hoffmann â€” is also introduced, of which 
the following is the description.
" f 3.
A. molle (Hofifmann).
Stalk still shorter [than in rhseticum], its scales broad 
and shorter ; frond semi-erect bright green ovate-lanceolate pinnate, pinnae pinnate, 
their midrib winged, lower pair very distant short deltoid deflexed; pinnules ^ai united 
by iving of midrib lobed, lobes 2 â€” 3 toothed ; clusters of capsules distinct 5 â€” 7 j^airs : 
mature in September.
Common in damp places." â€” p.
26.
The new British Cystopteris, the C.
montana of Link and Presl, 
has already been described and figured in our pages, (Phytol.
671).
The above are the principal points of interest which have struck us 
in going through this useful list ; if naturalists approve of the plan, it 
is to be followed in subsequent years by similar lists of British quad- 
rupeds, butterflies, Orchideas, &c.

Those plants marked with an asterisk, I have not found growing, 
but have seen specimens which are stated to have been gathered in

Whether the CEnanthe found in fresh- water marshes will prove a new 
species distinct from pirapinelloides, is at present uncertain ; but the 
specific differences between it and the salt-marsh plant appear slight.
Chenopodium rubrum and Salix Hoffmanniana, which are marked 
in the former list with a note of interrogation (Phytol.
413), have since 
been seen ; the first at Sawston, the other at Audley End.
Tragopogon pratensis (Id. 411), should have been entered as T.
minor, and Habenaria bifolia (Id. 414) as H.
chlorantha.
Cuscuta 
europaea has not been found here ; the specimen on the authority of 
which it was inserted, was gathered some years ago, and proves on 
examination to be C.
Trifolii.
I also feel some doubt as to whether Luzula Forsteri has been found 
here ; and of a pennanent locality for Mentha viridis.

Correction of an error in the description of Equisetum Tel- 
mateia.
In my description of this species (Phytol.
723) I have made 
this observation : â€” " Mr. Watson, in one of the passages above refer- 
red to, states that horses graze on it (Phytol.
588)." By a reference 
to this passage it will be seen that Mr. Watson remarks that " it is a 
notion among the rustics of Cheshire that horses get bogged by their 
endeavours to graze on this plant," &c.
I beg to offer my thanks to 
Mr. Watson, for calling my attention to this inaccuracy.

What is the Polypodium fragrans of Linneus ?
This fern is 
absent from nearly all our descriptive lists.
Wahlenberg, Roth, De- 
840 
candolle, Sadler, Smith, Hooker, Dietrich, Babington, and many 
others, appear to take no notice of it.
It seems highly probably that 
the fern did exist formerly, and scarcely probable that it has become 
extinct : it will be recollected also that our two fragrant ferns, Las- 
trffia rigida and L.
Oreopteris, are absent from those works in which 
P.fragrans is described, so that it may possibly be one of these.
I 
have endeavoured to collect all the evidence within my reach, as to 
the claims of rigida or Oreopteris to the title of fragrans ; and before 
immolating a well-established name on the altar of priority, I shall 
feel extremely obliged to any botanist who can give me information 
as to the present existence of the Linnean Polypodium fragrans.

On assisting Nature in the dissemination of Plants.
Although 
I concur in Dr. Bromfield's observation that this practice is " highly 
reprehensible " (Phytol.
806), and admit such to be the rule, yet I 
cannot help pleading somewhat earnestly for what I consider the ex- 
ception.
The rule appears to me to bear on all those cases in which 
the act is committed for purposes of deception, and the exception on 
those cases in which exotic plants are avowedly introduced to beau- 
tify our woods and wilds.
I have, I believe, succeeded in establish- 
ing three beautiful North-American ferns â€” Sitolobium pubescens, 
Onoclea sensibilis and Cystopteris bulbifera, and I think he were a 
slender botanist who fell into the error of supposing them natives of 
Britain.

Note on Oxalis corniculata.
As Devonshire is, I believe, con- 
sidered the strong hold for Oxalis corniculata, as an English plant, 
the following notice of it may not be quite devoid of interest to your 
readers.
Though I have never found it truly wild, that is, in such 
places as its more elegant congener loves to inhabit, yet in several si- 
tuations where ground has been recently ploughed or dug up, it has 
made its appearance.
Here (Lympstone) it has sprung up spontane- 
ously in a garden where it was unknown before the spade brought the 
seeds to the surface ; this also happened in a recently ploughed field 
adjoining: and in the rich earth procured for a melon-bed, it grows 
most luxuriantly, in fact it is a troublesome weed; this I have also 
known to occur in a garden at Teignmouth.
That the seeds of plants 
may lie dormant for a long time, and yet, when some accidental cir- 
cumstance favours their growth, may burst their covering and appear 
where we should least expect them, is well known, and has been be- 
fore proved in the pages of ' The Phytologist ; ' but the fact of these 
seeds being there to germinate, proves one of these two things, â€” that 
the plant in question was either formerly much cultivated in South 
Devon, and so natuialized, or that it is one of the indigenous products 
841 
of our soil ; which of the two deductions is the right one, I do not feel 
myself competent to determine, though as regards the first, I can say- 
that if it was formerly a common plant in gardens, it is not so now by 
any means, and I have not once seen it in a state of cultivation in the 
neighbourhood.

Note on Mr. Gibson's Hieracium hypochoeroides.
My former 
remarks upon this plant (Phytol.
801) are fully confirmed by the au- 
thentic specimen, for the inspection of which I am indebted to the 
editor of ' The Phylologist.' It is an identical species with the speci- 
mens of Mr. Ward, Mr. Tatham, Mr. Gardiner, and others mentioned 
in my former communication.
In his parcels of the present year, Mr.
Gardiner labels the plant " Hieracium murorum, Z., /3.
pulmonarium, 
SmT I fully concur with Mr. Gardiner in looking upon it as a form 
of H.
murorum, though not the H.
pulmonarium of Smith.
The H.
maculatum of ' English Botany ' scarcely differs, except by its more 
numerous flowers and stem-leaves, and by the stronger teeth of the 
leaves.
These characters are variable in the other forms of H.
muro- 
rum, in their wild states, and are commonly increased by cultivation.
In regarding H, maculatum as a luxuriant state of H.
murorum, rather 
than joining it with H.
sylvaticum, I am probably almost alone.

Mr. Bowman on the specific identity of Hieracium murorutn 
and H.
maculatum.
Believing this union to be conect, although in 
opposition to the views of Hooker and Babington, I crave a corner in 
' The Phytologist ' for the following unpublished note, furnished to 
me by the late Mr. J.
E. Bowman.
It was only this day that I met 
with the note, in a list of localities sent for the ' New Botanist's Guide,' 
about the year 1834 ; but being written under the head of " H.
mu- 
rorum" (a species too common for introduction into the Guide), it 
had been passed over, and quite forgotten if ever read.
" After long 
and repeated observations on numerous Welsh specimens from vari- 
ous localities, 1 am satisfied, notwithstanding what is said in 'English 
Flora,' that this species and H.
maculatum cannot be separated.
Nei- 
ther the shape of their leaves, nor their spots, nor the solitary leaf on 
the stem, can be relied on.
I have specimens that precisely agree 
with Smith's H.
murorum, only the leaves are spotted ; and others 
that correspond with his H.
maculatum, except that the stem is solid 
and has only a single leaf.
* * I have some specimens [of a 
Hieracium] from the Breidden, which it is next to impossible to iden- 
tify, and I have sometimes thought they may be a new species." So 
entirely had this note escaped proper attention at the time, that I took 
842 
the locality of Breidden Hill, from the ' English Flora,' and printed it 
for " H.
sylvaticura, maculatum." â€” Id. November 27.

Note on Carex paradoxa.
Having observed in your last num- 
ber an allusion to the existence of Carex paradoxa near York (Phytol.
779), I am induced to send you a short account of its discovery.
It 
was first found by myself in Heslington fields, in April, 1841, and a 
few weeks afterwards in Ascham bogs, an immense marsh about three 
miles S.
of York ; in both which localities it grows in the greatest 
abundance.
At that time I referred it, though doubtfully, to C.
tere- 
tiuscula ; but from this I observed that it differed in its mode of 
growth (forming compact tufts or stools like those of C.
paniculata), 
in its larger panicle, more numerously striated fruit, &c., and I thought 
it not improbable that it might prove to be the C.
paradoxa alluded to 
in Hooker's Flora under C.
paniculata.
I possessed, however, neither 
specimen nor description of that species with which to compare my 
plant, and my attention has been since then so completely engrossed 
by other departments of Botany, that I neglected to take the opinion 
of any of my friends capable of deciding on such a subject.
Mr. Bor- 
rer, whom I had the pleasure of seeing in York in the early part of 
September last, first informed me that my plant was identical with 
the Irish Carex paradoxa ; and more lately I have received similar 
testimony from Mr. Wilson, who was, I believe, the first to make out 
Mr. D.
Moore's specimens.
In Heslington fields, Carex paradoxa is 
accompanied by C.
caespitosa {true), C.
acuta, C.
fulva, C.
dioica &c.
In some parts of Ascham bogs the vegetation is almost entirely com- 
posed of C.
paradoxa and cgespitosa, but in the intervals between the 
tufts it is not uncommon to find a few scattered plants of C.
filiformis, 
a plant which grows abundantly in bogs on some of our moors in the 
Vale of York.
Carex paniculata grows also in Ascham bogs, and at- 
tains an enormous size, but I do not recollect having seen it growing 
side by side with C.
paradoxa.
I believe the latter matures its fi"uit 
two or three weeks earlier than the former.
We have not the true C.
teretiuscula nearer than Terrington Carr, which is fifteen miles N.
of 
York.

Note on Carex axillaris.
This plant does not grow in Hes- 
lington fields, as has been supposed (Phytol.
199), but it occurs in 
considerable quantity at the margins of brick-ponds on Hob-moor, 
near this city, where my attention was first directed to it by my fiiend 
Mr. O.
A. Moore, in June, 1842f.
The Carices growing along with it 
are C.
remota, vulpina, Pseudo-Cyperus, &c.; of these, C vulpina is 
by far the most like C.
axillaris in habit, but the concave surfaces, and 
843 
consequently very acute angles of the stem, will always suffice to dis- 
tinguish the former, without any other characters.
I am not at all 
surprised that C.
axillaris and divulsa have sometimes been confound- 
ed, which might very easily happen if the botanist were guided solely 
by the very meager descriptions in Hooker's Flora ; and the two spe- 
cies really differ very little in external aspect.
Mr. Borrer tells me 
that our C.
axillaris, at least, is not C.
boenninghausiana.

Note on Veronica triphyllos.
This interesting little plant was 
discovered in the spring of 1842, by Mr. Weatherill of this city, near 
the village of Nether Poppleton, and it is perhaps generally distributed 
over the sandy district which extends to a considerable distance west- 
ward of York, as 1 have observed it during the past spring and sum- 
mer in three or four stations some miles distant from each other.
Near 
Poppleton it grew abundantly in a stubble-field, as well as in an ad- 
joining sandy lane amongst Allium oleraceum ; but the place where I 
have seen it in the greatest luxuriance, is in the lane leading from 
Acombe to Ascham, where a quantity of brambles and briers had been 
cut away.
Alyssum calycinum has also been discovered by the same 
gentleman, growing with the Veronica, but in very small quantity.
â€” Id.
424.
Veronica Buxhamnii has been found in several places near 
York during the last three years, but only by two or three plants at a 
time, and as I have not heard of its being observed in the same sta- 
tion for two consecutive seasons, I conclude that it is an introduced 
plant.

Note on the Manchester Carex.
I am led to believe from the 
following circumstances, that the statement of Mr. Gibson, wherein 
he regrets that the locality of his Carex pseudo-paradoxa is a secret 
(Phytol.
778), has reference to a conversation between Mr. Gibson and 
myself; may I therefore be allowed, through the medium of your va- 
luable journal, to vindicate myself from such an imputation ?
Mr.
Gibson called on me to enquire if I would go w^ith him to gather the 
plant ; but at the time I was so engaged in business that it was not 
in my power to do so.
He then asked of me the locality, and if I 
could give him particular directions ?
Now, as he was a stranger to 
that part of the country, and the plant by no means easily to be found, 
I said I feared I could not, and told him the reason ; but said I could 
give him a number of specimens, as I had gathered it largely.
After 
some conversation on the subject, he said if I had given him the lo- 
cality, so that he could have found the plant, it was his intention to 
have cut it all down, if possible.
On this ground I felt myself justi- 
fied in withholding all further information ; for although no locality 
844 
ought to be kept secret, when the knowledge of it might prove of ad- 
vantage to science, or contribute to the pleasure of a fellow-student, 
yet after such a threat, was I not justified in retaining the information ?

Note on the Botany of France.
I have been highly pleased 
with Mr. Woods' paper on the Botany of France (Phytol.
785).
There 
is no place to which an English botanist is so likely to go, and even 
to fire-side travellers it must be pleasant to compare the Flora of an 
opposite shore with our own.
I will just mention, that on Mont St.
Katherine near Rouen, I found, two years ago, plenty of Bupleurum 
falcatum.
The two plants that most attracted my eye between Havre 
and Paris were Mercurialis annua and Eryngium campestre.

Note on Potass and Soda produced by the ashes of Plants.
It has been for a long time the general opinion, that the ashes of in- 
land plants produce potass, of maritime plants soda.
Whether mari- 
time plants removed inland would continue to secrete soda, is an in- 
teresting enquiry, and is a point on which Sir James Smith and Prof.
Liebig, although they do not absolutely contradict each other, can 
scarcely be said to agree.
While things are in this uncertain condi- 
tion, I have been much astonished at perusing Hartwig's analysis of 
the ashes of inland plants, and observing the large proportion of soda 
which he professes to have found in them ; for example : â€”

Note on Agarics.
I have eaten, this season, Agaricus perso- 
natus and nebularis.
The former, which is occasionally eaten, is not 
very pleasant; but the latter I can highly recommend.
I have scarce- 
ly found a single specimen of Agaricus deliciosus this season.
Those 
of vour readers who have paid no attention to Fungi, may be interested 
in knowing that by taking an Agaric not quite full grown, cutting the 
stalk off, and placing the top on a sheet of white paper, the gills down- 
ward, they will obtain a copious supply of sporules.
As in most Aga- 
rics these are white, coloured paper is the most appropriate.
The 
existence of ammonia in ketchup may be shown by adding quicklime 
to it.
The ammonia may be recognized by its smell, or by holding 
845 
over it a piece of litmus paper which has been partially redclened by 
an acid.

Note on Aspidium spinulosum.
I feel obliged to your coiTe- 
spondent Mr. Forster (Phytol.
814), for correcting an error which I 
inadvertently fell into (Id. 774) in stating that " the application of the 
specific name of spinulosiim to a British fern (first adopted, I believe, 
by Smith and Sowerby in ' English Botany ') originated in error," â€” 
a blunder this, on ray part, the more strange, as it is distinctly stated 
in the letter-press of ' English Botany,' that " Dr. Withering first made 
it known as a British plant." In my own defence, however, I must 
observe, that it is not recorded in Withering's second edition, printed 
in 1792, to which alone I had access.
My principal object in the 
remarks I made, was to warn botanists not to take up their notions 
about Aspidium spinulosum from the figure and account in ' English 
Botany,' where an error certainly is committed, Mr. Mackay having 
avowed to me that the plant there represented turned out to be only a 
young or starved specimen of A, dilatatum.
I am quite aware that 
Mr. Dickson " nowhere published A.
spinulosum ; " but I know that 
he was well acquainted with the fern, as well as with what I have 
called recurvum, and that he maintained them to be distinct species, 
and each of them distinct from dilatatum.
For distinction's sake I 
have been in the habit of calling this much-disputed species ^^ Dick- 
soti's spinulosum," because at the period when I conversed with him 
on the subject, he was the only botanist with whom I was personally 
acquainted, who appeared to me to have an accurate knowledge of the 
plant in question.

New locality for Saxifraga crenata^ Bab. C.
C.Babington, in 
his ' Manual of British Botany,' considers this plant a doubtful native 
at Hezleden Gill ; but when he was here this autumn, and visited the 
place, he was convinced of its being indigenous.
C. C.
Babingtonand 
your readers in general will be glad to learn that since then the Rev.
John Howson has found the same plant at Lynn Gill, but not in such 
profusion as at Hezleden Gill.
Lynn Gill is about four and a half 
miles from Hezleden Gill, and about thirteen miles from Settle ; the 
plant is found on the north-east side of the valley, about twenty yards 
above the waterfall; the high range of hills, part of the Penine chain 
which passes through Yorkshire, separates the two locahties.

Observations on the dissemination of Seeds of Plants.
As a 
question has been raised by Dr. Bromfield, whether it be right to 
" assist nature in the dissemination of plants " (Phytol.
806), and this 
being a question on which it seems desirable that botanists should 
make up their minds, I think it may not be amiss to discuss it at great- 
er length than has been done by that gentleman, especially as he has 
taken the negative side.
The main reason given by Dr. Bromfield 
for entertaining this opinion, is the confusion which would be created 
in Vegetable Geography, if botanists yvexe to take upon themselves to 
scatter seeds.
It is true that another reason is glanced at, but in re- 
ference to this perhaps I may be allowed to say, that I cannot see any 
greater moral iniquity in sowing seeds to gratify the eye, than in sow- 
ing them to gratify the palate.
With respect to Vegetable Geography, 
the most interesting part is that which treats of the affinity of certain 
plants for certain soils ; and it appears to me that this is not only 
Qiot endangered by the course which Dr. Bromfield denounces, but 
that it is assisted rather than otherwise.
Thus, the seeds of a plant 
found usually on a gravelly or sandy soil, are perhaps sown by the 
botanist on a chalky soil, where, if they germinate and flourish, an 
error maybe corrected by its being shown that such a plant is not so 
peculiar to a sandy or gravelly soil, as that it will not flourish upon a 
chalky one ; on the other hand, if the seeds perish, or if the plants 
produced from them do not flourish, there is at least strong presump- 
tive evidence that the chalky soil is not adapted for their growth.
In 
either case, it is not likely that a botanist will be led into an eiTor in 
this respect.
As to the geographical distribution of plants, a study 
which, when separated from the other branch of the subject, is a mat- 
ter of much less interest, it can never, I think, be endangered by the 
occasional assistance afforded by botanists in the production of plants, 
especially if they make known (as they should do) the fact of their 
having given such assistance ; but even if this information were with- 
held, the fact of such assistance having been rendered would in most 
cases be apparent, especially if the plants disseminated are known to be 
otherwise peculiar to other countries.
There is another objection stated 
by Dr. Bromfield, namely, that the working botanist is misled and dis- 
appointed, in finding that he has in reality only discovered an artifi- 
cial station, when he had flattered himself he had met with a new 
natural one.
It is true, that in such a case, the botanist will in all 
probability undergo some disappointment, and that this disappoint- 
847 
ment will most likely exceed the pleasure of finding the plant, and 
seeing it growing there, before and after he knows this.
To prevent 
such disappointment as much as possible, care should be taken to 
make known the fact of the station's being an artificial one.
Against 
the disappointment of the botanists of the day, however, is there not 
to be placed a large amount of pleasure to be derived by future bota- 
nists, from the possession of the naturalized plant, when the artificial 
station shall have become a natural one ?
Examples may easily be 
adduced of the pleasure derived by ourselves from such a source.
Impatiens fulva, for instance, as is well known, grows in the greatest 
luxuriance along the banks of the river Wey, from considerably above 
Guildford down to the Thames at Weybridge, and even as low as 
Barnes (Phytol.
814).
Now it is not probable that Vegetable Geogra- 
phy will ever be endangered by this fact, the plant being known to be 
of American origin : on the other hand, what a pleasure is it to the 
botanist to see this beautiful plant luxuriating in this country, and to 
possess in his herbarium specimens of it gathered with his own hand !
There may even be instances in which error as to the distribution 
of a plant might arise by not assisting Nature.
For example: the 
only spot in Britain where Cyperus fuscus has been found, is a little 
marshy meadow surrounded by houses, near Walham-green, Middle- 
sex.
There can be no manner of doubt that at some time hence, per- 
haps even in one year, this meadow will be drained, and either built 
upon or ploughed up ; and then, if no one has taken the precaution 
of removing some of the plants of Cyperus elsewhere, there will be a 
species lost to Britain.
Are we to look on quietly aud see our species 
become extinct before our very eyes, and not move a finger to save 
them ?
In such cases at least, may not every objection be made 
against not meddling, which is raised by Dr. Bromfield against the 
doing so ?
Indeed it is only just to future botanists to take care that 
we do not deprive them of pleasure in gratifying ourselves.
It is, of 
course, not desirable that botanists should make a practice of scatter- 
ing the seeds of any but the rarer plants ; but I think we should never 
run the risk of allowing any species to become extinct.
Neither do 
I think it would be advisable to naturalise many foreign plants : it is 
more interesting for each country to have its own species; and as far 
as the geographical distribution of plants is concerned, it might be- 
come difficult to register them, and to remember that such species 
were only naturalized, if this were done to any great extent.
I can 
however see nothing to blame in a botanist's sowing (as has been done 
by Dr. Bromfield in the case of Urtica Dodartii) the seeds of a plant 
848 
which is found in but two or three places in a country, because there 
is no fear, even if this should ever be rendered a common plant, that 
a sufficient number of others will not remain rare, especially since it 
is likely that as the study of Botany extends, there will be a greater 
demand for rare plants.
On the contrary, I think we have every 
reason to thank a botanist for his kindness in propagating a rare 
plant, not so much for the pleasure we ourselves are to derive from 
it, as for the pleasure it will in all probability afford to the bota- 
nists who are to succeed us.

Mr. A.
White read a paper describing the application of a lever movement to the 
stage of a microscope.
It consists of a lever, to the shorter arm of which a ball is 
firmly screwed, moving in a socket formed by the upper plate of the stage, and a cup, 
which is a brass plate secured by two screws to that plate.
This lever passes through 
a perforated ball, moving in a socket formed by an arm attached to an immoveable 
part of the microscope, and a cup formed and secured upon the arm, as in the former 
instance.
This lever is about five inches long, having the longer arm equal to three 
and the shorter to one.
This proportion however varies according to position, and 
hence the necessity of a perforation in the second ball to allow for it.
This construc- 
tion affords great facility of motion in every direction, and the range in the instrument 
exhibited was three quarters of an inch.
Mr. Jackson read a paper describing an improvement in the mode of applying a 
divided glass micrometer to the measurement of objects under examination, described 
by him in a former paper read September 3, 1841.
The micrometer is mounted in a 
thin brass frame, which slides easily (under a spring) through slits in the opposite 
sides of the eye-piece, which slits, when not in use, are closed by a quarter revolution 
of an internal tube having similar slits.
Its divisions are ^ of an inch apart, with one 
of the spaces divided into five by finer lines, which, as they may be readily brought by 
the sliding of the micrometer into contact with the magnified edge of the object to be 
examined, aff'ovd great facility of measurement.
Mr. Jackson concluded with some 
observations relative to the mode of using this instrument, and of finding the value of 
its divisions under the various circumstances in which it may be employed.

By W.
Wilson, Esq.
(Continued from p.
73.5).
The introversion of the embryo-sac, although insisted upon as an 
established fact, is still not an essential part of the theory of Schlei- 
den.
It is possible that the apex of the sac might have a minute aper- 
ture immediately below the micropyle ; or the pollen-tube might, by 
perforating the membrane, gain admission to the interior, instead of 
propelling the upper half of the sac, as it is stated to do, into the lower 
half of the membrane to form a double wrapper for the nascent em- 
bryo.
And although it is considered that sufficient proof has been 
obtained that no such introversion takes place, and that thus the en- 
tire theory, so far as it rests on the authority of Schleiden, is consider- 
ably weakened if not altogether set aside ; it is not so easy to dispose 
of the question whether or not the pollen-tube enters the micropyle : 
to deny it would be to contravene the statements of some of the most 
able physiologists of the time, while the most diligent investigations 
of my own have failed to supply the smallest reason for adopting 
their views.
Wydler says : â€” " On doit a M.
R. Brown la connaissance de la 
route que suit le boyau pollinique depuis le stigmate, â€” j usque dans 
I'ovule meme, en y entrant par son micropyle ; mais c'est la que s'ar- 
reterent les observations de I'illustre Anglais, Cette route indiquee 
par lui, fut constatee par les recherches de M, Brongniart fils, corarae 
par celles de M.
Corda."* It also appears that even Mirbel and 
Spach entertain a similar opinion.
For my own part, I have not suc- 
ceeded in tracing the pollen-tubes very much below the stigma ; and 
perhaps the pains bestowed in this method of investigation might 
have well been spared, because in most cases the micropyle is so si- 
tuated with respect to the placenta, that a void space must be traversed 
by the pollen-tube in its progress thither; or at least the pollen-tube 
must glide along the surface of the ovule after leaving the placenta, 
before it can enter the micropyle ; and thus, without any very minute 
* Annales cles Sciences Nat. tome xi.
p. 144.
4c 
850 
dissection, it should not be difficult to descry the lowest portion of 
the pollen-tube inserted into the micropyle, at the period immediately 
succeeding the fecundation of the ovule.
An argument which has been used with far more limited applica- 
tion by Mirbel and Spach, may not be iri'elevant here.
"Pour defen- 
dre avec succes [cet] opinion, il faudrait prouver non seulement que 
le boyau pollinique acquiert [souvent] une longueur demesuree, mais 
encore qiCil est done dhm sens particuUer, a la faveur duquel il se 
dirige^ * On the latter point, at least, it may be also said, without 
danger of contradicting those high authorities, â€” " Jusqu'a ce jour, 
cette prenve n'a pas ete produite : " and when it is considered that in 
numberless cases the micropyle is not directed towards the placenta, 
but turned away from it, and thus placed in the most difficult and un- 
likely position for access on the part of an organ not endowed with 
intelligence, it might not be absolutely presumptuous to doubt whe- 
ther these great observers may not, for once, have been misled by il- 
lusory appearances ; or at least it may not be unpardonable to ask for 
additional evidence in support of the statement, to establish it as a 
general rule.

Myosotis palustris.
â€” At the time of fecundation the ovule is of a 
globular form, with a bent cylindrical neck, at whose extremity is the 
micropyle, (see fig.
1 and 2, p.
850).
It has some resemblance to a 
chemical retort, and its neck being turned to the base of the style, the 
micropyle is placed apparently in immediate contact with the con- 
ducting tissue.
As the ovule advances towards maturity, the micro- 
pyle is gradually withdrawn and elevated, until it is ultimately found 
near the summit of the ovule, (fig.
3, c).
The embryo {d) has not been 
observed in its earliest stage, and it would be scarcely possible to 
trace the pollen-tube, on account of its excessive tenuity, into a mi- 
cropyle thus situated : the pollen-grains of this plant are unusually 
diminutive.
Nuphar lutea.
â€” In this plant the embryo-sac is remarkable for its 
great length, compared with that of the fully-developed embryo, which 
occupies only a small space at the top of the ripe seed, while the em- 
bryo-sac extends throughout its whole length.
There is also a con- 
siderable thickness of the tissue of the nucleus interposed between 
the summit of the embryo-sac and the micropyle, at the time of fecun- 
dation, (see fig.
4) ; tending to show that fecundation may take place 
along the vascular tissue of the funiculus, and through the base of the 
ovule.
It seems at least probable that the nutriment of the embryo 
is conveyed by that channel, (see fig.
5).
At fig.
7 is shown an actual 
dissection of the embryo-sac, with the primary utricle [c) in a very 
early stage ; and another, more advanced, is exhibited at fig.
8. In 
this the embryo [d) appears in its earliest intelligible state : when 
fully developed, it occupies the whole of the dilated head of the em- 
bryo-sac (c), and also assumes the same shape.
The true structure 
of the embryo has been a subject of debate, but the section at fig.
9, 
leaves very little room to doubt that it is dicotyledonous.
Nymphcea alha.
â€” In this the parts are quite analogous to the last, 
but with several modifications.
Here the secundine projects very 
much beyond the primine, and the nucleus is likewise attenuated at 
the apex, so as almost to project beyond the micropyle.
The funi- 
culus also expands into an arillus, completely investing the ripe seed, 
(see fig.
10 and 11).

â€” Notes of a Boianical Excursion in France, in the 
Summer of 1843.
By Joseph Woods, Esq., F.L.S.
(Concluded from page 834).
I did not pursue any systematic course at Malesherbes, but made 
short trips as it suited M.
Barnard to accompany me, to point out the 
localities.
But I will present the results of my observations in a more 
regular form.
I will suppose the botanist, therefore, to begin by 
crossing the river, and taking a road to the right, examine some rocks 
and sandy banks on the right bank of the valley.
This was in fact 
the first walk I took with M.
Barnard.
Here he may find Osmuuda 
regalis, a remarkable station, as the rocks in general are very dry ; 
Asplenium viride, Tragus racemosus, and in the neighbourhood of a 
little spring on the upper part of the slope, Helosciadium repens, 
Botrychium Lunaria, and Schoenus compressus.
The Helosciadium 
is different from any English specimens which I have seen.
It has 
properly no stem, but throws out runners, which produce at the same 
points roots, leaves and umbels ; yet 1 would not be very positive 
that it is specifically distinct from H.
nodiflorum.
On the top of the 
sand rocks a little beyond this spring grows Juncus capitatus ; and a 
little higher up, on the stony ground, abundance of Epipactis atro- 
rubens.
The habit of the plant, as well as its smaller leaves and dark 
purple flowers, and earlier time of flowering (June), strongly indicate 
a specific diflerence from E.
latifolia, of which there is abundance in 
the same place, but not opening its flowers until the other is quite 
over.
We also find here Helianthemum pulverulentum, and T think 
apenninum, the latter of which is perhaps a white-flowered variety of 
H. vulgare.
H. polifolium, as figured in ' English Botany,' differs in 
its sepals, which are rounded at the top.
At this point M.
Barnard 
left me, but we may descend into the marsh and cross it to Ronceval.
The principal rarities, as is often the case with the Botany of bogs 
and marshes in France, consisted of plants more common in England 
than here : here are Carex dioica and pulicaris, and several other spe- 
cies are said to be found, but the marsh was everywhere full of water, 
and though one may go up to one's knees for the certainty of a rare 
plant, yet one does not like to do so for the chance of a species con- 
sidered rare by the French botanists, and the additional chance that 
it would not be so considered by an English one.
All the Carices 
that I did see, were in very bad condition, and it was apparently a 
bad year for them.
Neottia spiralis is found in these marshes at a 
854 
later season ; and on the left hand border Malaxis Loeselii is said to 
grow, but I did not see it.
Chlora perfoliata, which in this part of 
France seems always to prefer a boggy situation, also grows here; 
and in some of the drier parts, elevated a few inches above the gene- 
ral level.
Inula salicina.
There were also : â€” 
Polygala aniara, yar.
austri- Scirpus uniglumis Utricularia minor 
Drosera anglica [aca Schcenus nigricans Ranunculus Lingua 
Aspidium Thelypteris Sparganium natans Epipactis palustris 
Pinguicula vulgaris 
Before we reach Ronceval, to the left of the path through a pine- 
wood, M.
Barnard finds Lavandula vera in abundance, but I missed 
the spot.
Scabiosa ukranica grows on some sandy banks, but not in 
the abundance in which we shall find it in our next walk.
I gathered 
also Silene Otites, Orobanche ramosa, Linaria Pelesseriana and Po- 
lycnemum arvense.
From Ronceval we may again cross the marshes in a new line, and 
pass the Essonne, either at the bridge below the chateau, or at the 
Mill du Tonnemi.
In either case we direct our course to the village 
of Pinson, behind which, on a bank at the edge of the wood, is Medi- 
cago orbicularis.
We then cross the wood by a foot-path, where I 
ought to have found Rhus Toxicodendron.
This is probably one of 
the plants introduced here by M.
de Malesherbes, the generous de- 
fender of Louis XVI., who amused himself with planting trees and 
scattering seeds in the woods about the chateau.
There are, how- 
ever, many plants about Malesherbes, which seem to be naturalized 
rather than genuine natives, but which can hardly be attributed to 
him.
Prunus Mahaleb I should think indigenous ; it abounds in the 
woods, not only here but at Etampes and Pithiviers : and being es- 
teemed a good wood for fuel, it is now planted for that object; but it 
seems more probable that a plant, a native of the country and found 
useful, should be selected, than that a foreign shrub should have been 
sought out for that purpose.
Cytisus Laburnum is almost equally 
common, and is considered also good fuel.
This may have spread 
from the gardens, where it has been early and generally admitted 
throughout Europe, as an ornamental plant ; yet I should rather 
suppose it wild originally, though increased to its present quantity by 
those who have the care of the woods.
Nobody would doubt that 
these plants were in their natural situation if there were only one 
shrub where now there are a hundred ; their very abundance makes 
them suspicious.
Prunus Mahaleb I gathered in a wood near Rouen, 
and it occurs in the forest of Orleans.
For the Laburnum we must go 
855 
much further to find a position in which it is either certainly or doubt- 
fully a native.
Next to these is Syringa vulgaris, which occurs some- 
times in large patches, and sometimes in scattered bushes, just as we 
should expect from a native plant.
Colutea arborea is much less 
widely diffused ; but this, and Rhus coriaria and R.
cotinus, occur at 
Pithiviers as well as here at Malesherbes.
Of Robinia pseud-acacia 
there is not much, except by the road-sides : it is not a good fire- 
wood.
Spiraea hypericifolia occurs in several places, and as it can- 
not be of value for fire-wood, is probably a true native.
Keeping 
still to this wood of Malesherbes, we find, in addition to the preced- 
ing, Cytisus supinus and sessilifolius, Tilia parvifolia and Acer mons- 
pessulanus.
Our next plant is Stachys lanata, at the foot of a flight 
of steps leading towards the chateau: I observed also a plant or two 
of the saane by the village of Pinson.
We go up these steps, and 
leaving the chateau on the left, pass by a long straight avenue to the 
road to Orleans, which we cross, and gather Cytisus supinus, and af- 
ter some distance, find on the left the wood of Chateau Gay, which 
we enter, and gather Buxus sempervirens, Quercus coccifera and 
Taxus baccata : even the latter of these is not thought genuine.
Then on a hill almost detached from the general mass, abundance of 
Phalangium ramosum and Cartharaus mitissimus occur.
Here also, 
in some years.
Orchis odoratissima abounds, but though M.
Barnard 
was with me at this point, we hunted a long time for it in vain.
The 
Orchises of the militaris tribe were over, but O.
hircina was still in 
full flower, Ophrys apifera very plentiful, and O.
arachnites just com- 
ing out (June 24), but when I again visited the point at a later period, 
(July 31), it was in great beauty : Prunella grandiflora also made 
much more show at this later visit.
I do not mention in these walks 
Teucrium montanum.
Ononis Columnae, or Helianthemum Fumana, 
because they are almost everywhere about Malesherbes.
On descend- 
ing from this hill and leaving the wood, we gathered Neslia panicu- 
lata and Lactuca perennis.
Here M.
Barnard again left me, after 
having pointed out my course to the Colline de Justice.
On a bar- 
ren piece of ground on the way, the three species of Adonis were all 
growing together, which gave me an opportunity of comparing them.
They are perfectly distinct, and well characterized by the seeds.
In 
A. autumnalis {a) these are pyramidal, with a terminal style, and 
are rounded at the base.
Those of A.
aestivalis differ by having an 
unequally projecting membrane above the base, giving the appear- 
ance of a tooth to the outline, {b) : while in A.
flammea, the spike is 
more cylindrical, the fruit smaller and less angular, and the style be- 
856 
low the summit, (c) : something of the border above the base is visi- 
ble here also.
These characters are the more valuable, as the flowers 
and seeds are generally found together.
But in the spring (they all 
flower early in June, or perhaps in May), before the seeds are suffi-

ciently advanced, they may be distinguished, â€” A.
autumnalis by its 
somewhat incurved petals of a rich deep crimson, giving rather a glo- 
bular appearance to the flower ; aestivalis by its full, flat, scarlet flow- 
er ; and flammea by its few (3 â€” 5) and narrow petals, forming a flower 
neither conspicuous nor beautiful.
Upon the same piece of barren 
ground grows Linum montanum, here quite prostrate ; while on the 
neighbouring Colline de Justice it is erect.
Other difference I could 
not find, except that the latter form produces its flowers for a short 
period only, while the former keeps throwing out its flowering-stems 
all through the summer.
Ij. montanum and L.
alpinum seem, how- 
ever, hardly marked by any other character : L.
perenne of Smith (L.
anglicum of DeCandolle) is perhaps distinguished by its obtuse sepals.
Here we also meet with Micropus erectus, which I afterwards found 
to be very common at Etampes and Pithiviers, as well as at Male- 
sherbes ; and with Althaea hirsuta.
From this barren piece T mounted the Colline de Justice, where 
again we find abundance of Orchideae, Carthamus mitissimus, and 
Spiraea hypericifolia, together with Rosa cinnamomea, Lavandula ve- 
ra, and one or two plants of Satureja montana.
From this hill I 
crossed the plain to two or three cottages within sight, above Rou- 
villes, which mark the station of Rosa lutea, and where, on the 24th 
of June, I still found one or two straggling flowers.
From thence, 
leaving the chateau, which lies between us and Malesherbes, on the 
left, we follow the line of a hedge till we have wood on the outside of 
the inclosure as well as within, and then crossing the hedge, which is 
everywhere pervious, we find Limodorum abortivum on the descent, 
on the stony soil above the sand.
In all this walk we have been rather circling Malesherbes, than go- 
ing to any distance, and it might be divided into two, or the two last 
portions might be visited in our next walk.
Tn this we again cross the bridge, but afterwards turn to the left 
857 
instead of the right.
On the sandy ground here, as indeed in many 
other places, we find Fumaria parviflora and Vaillantii abundantly.
I 
have not, in this excursion, seen much of the larger forms, but the 
four smaller seem distinctly characterized.
In F.
parviflora the seed 
ends in a blunt acumen, giving a somewhat lengthened form to the

whole fruit ; and though in F.
officinalis and Vaillantii there is some- 
times a sort of umbo, yet this rather occupies a terminal hollow than 
forms of itself a projection.
In F.
officinalis the calyx, on the first 
opening of the flower, is as long as the germen ; in Vaillantii it is 
extremely small and evanescent, so much so that it is often difficult 
to be certain that there is any, even before the flowers are open ; 
in micrantha, on the contrary, it is broad, more than half as long as 
the flower, and exceeding at all times the seed-vessel.
The ca- 
lyx of F.
parviflora is larger than that of Vaillantii, but this, as I have 
already observed, is distinguished from all the others by the fruit.
Our next plant is Verbascum thapsiforme, which is also very com- 
mon, but flowering rather later than many of the plants of our walk.
The large flower and the lengthened lower anthers are the first things 
to be attended to.
Cosson &c.
make the character depend upon the 
greater proportionate length of the filaments, but I do not find this to 
be correct.
The anther is lengthened quite as much in proportion as 
the filament ; and it is to be observed that in V.
Thapsus the two 
lower filaments and anthers are somewhat longer than the others, and 
in all the species of Verbascum where this takes place, the lengthen- 
ed anther is smooth at the top, and sometimes in its whole length.
Another point is in the base of the leaves, which are always so 
858 
decurreut in V.
Thapsus, as to form five wings to the stalk.
I cannot 
assert that this is never the case in V.
thapsiforine, but I believe it 
will not be found to obtain through the whole plant, and the lower 
leaves are sometimes so little decurrent as hardly to furnish two con- 
tinued wings, bringing it near to phlomoides.
It may be a variety of 
V. Thapsus, but it is not a hybrid, as this and Thapsus are rarely 
found together.
We have as yet made very little progress in our walk.
A few steps 
further bring us to a bank of loose sand, profusely covered with Sca- 
biosa ukranica, which however is hardly in a state to oifer good speci- 
mens before the middle of August.
A little further, and higher up on 
the crest of the hill, where we also found most of the plants we 
had observed in similar situations in yesterday's walk, grows Stipa 
pennata.
Abandoning the hills for a moment, we descend into the 
marsh, in one point of which we find Ophrys Loeselii in plenty, and 
Myriophyllum pectinatum, which seems a common form in this part 
of the country.
This is also a station of Carex filiformis, but I did 
not see it.
We then take the road for Nanteau, and directing our 
course to the east end of the village, follow the carriage-road towards 
Bois Minard, near the beginning of which, in the sandy bottom, we 
find Trigonella monspeliaca and Andropogon angustifolium.
The 
botanist may then either continue to Bois Minard, or return through 
Nanteau, and take the road along the valley as far as the Mill of Noi- 
gneau.
1 took the former course, and from Bois Minard descended 
through a woody valley to the Chapelle Nainvault, now a barn, and 
to the said Mill of Noigneau.
This valley will perhaps give nothing 
new, yet it is pleasant to see such a number of plants together, either 
rare or unknown with us.
The steep barren points were splendid 
with : â€” 
Diantlius caryophyllus Ononis Columnae Aira canescens 
D. prolifer Coronilla minima Euphorbia Cyparissias 
Silene Otites Statice plantaginea Ononis natrix, which I 
Veronica spicata Sedum album - ought to have nien- 
Melampyrum cristalum Geranium sanguineum tioned before, as it 
Helianthemum guttatum Stachys recta grows in many pla- 
Teucrium Chamaedrys S.
annua ces.
T. montanum Allium sphaerocephalum 
The white-flowered Helianthemums were over.
In the lower parts 
we had Campanula persicifolia, Coronilla varia, Peucedanum Oreo- 
selinmn, Malva Alcea and Tilia parvifolia.
I missed Scabiosa sua- 
veolens, which is said to grow in this valley.
After passing the mill and the bridge beyond it, we cross the 
859 
marshes by a path to the right, which is not always practicable.
I 
was told that this would take me to St. Val: I do not know whether I 
made some mistake, and kept too much to the left, but I came out at 
Boigneville, the hills behind which descend in a sort of double slope, 
of which the highest is stony and the lower sandy.
Behind the last 
houses of the village, on the upper part of the lower slope, Hyssopus 
officinalis grows in great profusion.
At Boigneville are two respect- 
able public-houses.
I continued my walk to St. Val, behind which 
there is a range of rocky wood, where however I added nothing, and 
I should recommend it and some points above to the examination of 
another day, when the botanist has not spent his time and his labour 
in hunting out plants by the way: he will therefore set his face home- 
wards, and passing the little bridge at Boigneville, ascend the rock 
of St. Gervais by a winding foot-path.
This bridge is over a little 
stream, whose sources are in the marshy ground of the valley above, 
and there are moist places at the foot of the rocky bank a little above 
the level of the marsh, which seemed promising, but I found nothing.
As he emerges from the rocky ascent of St. Gervais, he will find Bu- 
pleurum aristatum, which I believe is the only addition 1 have made 
to the Flora of Paris : and he will enjoy a fine view up the rocky val- 
ley of Prainvault, and down that of the Essonne.
Thence keeping to 
the left on the edge of the hill, he will come to a carriage-road which 
rises from the valley.
Near this he ought to find Ruta graveolens 
and Allium carinatum, but I failed in both, although 1 returned a se- 
cond time to look for them.
After leaving this point I took the by- 
road to Argerville, and turning to the right followed for some distance 
the valley of the Essonne to Touvault, soon after which my road as- 
cended the hills.
I left it at the top and followed the crest, which 
gave me again Limodorum abortivum and Bupleurum aristatum.
From this point we may pass through a little hamlet, and above the 
chateau of Rouville, and gather Rosa lutea and Limodorum aborti- 
vum, if we have not already included them in our collections.
Many other excursions, extending to a greater distance, might 
doubtless be made profitably from Malesherbes, keeping among the 
woods and steep banks which border the valley of the Essonne ; for 
on the flat table-land which extends on each side, there is little to be 
found.
I went on one occasion to Boissy aux Cailles, near which, 
in the early spring, M.
Barnard obtained Scilla bifolia and Corydalis 
fabacea.
I found nothing; but it is curious and very delightful, after 
a long, dull, nearly level walk, to find one's self on the edge of a dee]) 
picturesque hollow, where rocks, woods and sandy banks are mixed 
860 
with villages and cultivation.
This hollow of Boissy aux Cailles 
forms the head of a separate valley, watered lower down by the little 
river I'Ecolle, which falls into the Seine at Ponthievy.
The eye fol- 
lows it as far as Milly, where some pretty high hills, probably calca- 
reous, rise above the sandy banks.
To judge from this view, and 
fi'om the figure it makes on the map, there is no situation about Paris 
which promises a better harvest than Milly, and as we find no habi- 
tats assigned, I conclude that none has been so little visited.
Whatever we may think of the Botany of Malesherbes, the tendency 
it exhibits to admit a foreign vegetation is very curious.
Of the va- 
rious plants which have been sown in different places in our country, 
for amusement, for experiment, or with the fallacious and foolish view 
of swelling out the numbers of a local Flora, we know that very few 
have succeeded ; but here everything seems to take root.
On the 26th of June I found a voiture at Malesherbes, which took 
me to Lardi, whence I went by the rail-road to Etampes.
Our road 
followed the valley of the Essonne (after the first three or four miles) 
as far as Ferte I'Aleps, and the whole is very tempting ; but on anor 
ther occasion (July) I visited Pithiviers, which perhaps is more different 
in its character from Malesherbes than Maisse, la Ferte, or any place 
in the lower valley of the Essonne.
The grit and sand here disappear, 
and we have only a few calcareous rocks and slopes of trifling eleva- 
vation arising from the valley.
Pithiviers would afford two long 
walks, one up and one down the valley, in each case going on one 
side and returning on the other.
Many of the rarities of Malesherbes 
are here plentiful ; as Linum montanum, the erect variety, Teucrium 
montanum.
Ononis Columnse, Micropus erectus and Althaea hirsuta.
Prunus Mahaleb is extremely common, as w^ell as several of the other 
shrubs of doubtful spontaneity already mentioned.
In the park, a 
vast enclosure of fields, gardens, meadows and marshes, M.
Cosson 
and myself gathered Lathyrus palustris.
This park is open on the 
side towards Pithiviers, but has no exit at the further end, and its 
long wall forces one to a disagreeable detour on that side of the town.
Below the park is a considerable marsh, somewhat peaty in places, 
and here also is found Lathyrus palustris, but not so plentifully as in 
the park.
In another direction L.
tuberosus grows among the com.
Towards Bonderoy, Medicago orbicularis is plentiful, and we observ- 
ed Tordylium maximum and Veronica prsecox.
From Etampes the walk I should most recommend is to go to the 
extremity of the Fauxbourg St. Pierre, and turning on the left from 
the road to Pithiviers, ascend a sandy slope by the side of a sand-pit.
861 
Immediately after leaving the houses we find Tragus racemosus, and 
higher up Fedia coronata.
Crossing the ridge, and a cultivated val- 
ley, we reach a second woody bluff where Helianthemum Fumana (or 
procumbens) is exceedingly abundant.
Proceeding in the same man- 
ner we mount a third woody point, after passing in the bottom the 
road to la Ferte, which is characterized by the size and abundance 
of Ononis Columnse, and on the top by the quantity of Micropus 
erectus and of Orchideae, for which however I was too late, except for 
Satyrium hircinum and an Epipactis.
The Micropus is nearly wanting on the two first hills.
The upper 
part of the fourth point offers us Carthamus mitissimus, and on its 
foot, in a sandy wood which descends into the plain, an Orobanche, 
which some of my botanical friends thought to be O.
arenaria.
On 
examining it more at leisure, and comparing it with a specimen of O.
arenaria from Montpellier, it appears to me a variety of O.
caerulea, 
with blunter divisions to the lower lip, and the upper toothed, but 
nearly entire.
1 did not go any further, but there are three other 
points of the same nature well worth an examination, and we might 
then walk to Etrechy, two leagues from Etampes, and return by the 
rail-road.
The only interesting plants I have seen at Etampes, not 
included in this walk, are Teucrium montanum, Linum montanum 
and Trigonella monspeliaca ; and I should think it probable that a 
further investigation would yield these also.
The two first seem to 
prefer a calcareous soil, and would be found in a walk begun by cross- 
ing the marshes of the Juine by a foot-path, and keeping among the 
woods to the right.
I did not go far in this direction, and about Or- 
moy la Riviere, the hills do not appear interesting.
Further up the 
valley they are again more promising.
Just beyond the first hollow, 
opposite to a mill before reaching Ormoy, are some banks which seem 
exceedingly rich in Orchideae ; and if Orchis variegata had got into 
the Norman Flora by anything but a mistake, I should expect to find 
it here.
There are some barren slopes stretching from Briere les Scel- 
lees towards Champigny, which will yield Trigonella monspeliaca, 
and perhaps something else ; at the foot I observed Arnoseris mini- 
ma : I passed along it in the rain.
In the fields at the top I noticed 
the Polycnemum, and above St. Martin de la Roche, Trifolium glome- 
ratum, which is considered a prize by the Parisian botanists.
At St.
Martin is Leonurus Cardiaca, but I did not see the L.
Marrubiastrum, 
said to be found near Etampes.
At St. Hilaire, Carthamus mitissi- 
mus is abundant ; and in the fields on the plain above, Targionia la- 
tifolia.
In a rocky sandy bit of wood in the way, the Trigonella also 
. 862 
occurs, but less abundantly than in the station before noticed : Me- 
dicago orbicularis also occurs in the same place.
Fedia coronata is 
most abundant on a sandy point overhanging the rail-road : Oxalis 
stricta occurs in the lower grounds ; Coronilla minima and Micropus 
erectus are common in this direction.
On the 29th I left Etampes and returned to Paris ; and on the 2nd 
of July accompanied M.
de Jussieu and his friends and pupils in a 
herborization in the forest of Montmorency.
The neighbourhood of Paris affords a number of stations for plea- 
sant and profitable botanical excursions, in the radius of a few miles.
The forests of Marly, St. Germain, Montmorency, Bondy and Senart, 
the woods of Meudon and Versailles, and still nearer, those of Bou- 
logne and Vincennes, afford ample scope for botanical investigations.
Sometimes a larger range is taken, and M.
de Jussieu leads a party, 
once in the season, to Fontainebleau or Rambouillet.
In the weekly 
excursions, the mass of pupils know little about Botany, but even in 
these parties there are generally some sensible men and good bota- 
nists, besides M.
de Jussieu himself, and M.
Decaisne.
M, de Jus- 
sieu's method with his pupils is admirable.
They bring him plants 
to name, and he adds to the name some little note about their cha- 
racters, or the natural class to which they belong, or calls their atten- 
tion to particular points of construction which may tend to elucidate 
these points.
We took the road by the Fontaine, and thus entered the forest, 
keeping afterwards rather to the left.
There is a good deal of springy 
ground, which does not perhaps yield much water even in the spring, 
but which is sufficient to maintain a number of plants which delight 
in moisture, and Osmunda regalis and a variety of Carices are pretty 
widely diffused.
We got Carex Mairii growing plentifully, mixed 
with C.
flava; Poly gala depressa seems also to like wet places.
On 
emerging from this part of the forest we passed the village of Andilly, 
from a point above which we had a noble view over the valley of the 
Seine and the surrounding hills.
On the top of this bluff the stones 
abound in the fossil seeds of Chara medicaginula.
On ascending this 
point we turn to the left, between a corn-field and a branch of the 
forest : the former contains Arenaria segetalis.
Beyond this we again 
find a considerable extent of wet gi'ound, from which we descended 
to a dried-up pool, at the foot of which is the habitat of Stachys al- 
pina.
In this pool, or in one in the same neighbourhood, I recollect 
on a former occasion to have found Teucrium Scorodonia.
We then 
turned up the little valley which forms a station for Asperula odo- 
803 
rata, and one or two other plants more common with us than about 
Paris, and amved at a house famous for its milk, and frontage a la 
creme, which is more like clotted cream than like cream cheese, and 
after passing the foot of another pool, take a path to the right, at a 
little distance above which, on the left, is some boggy ground, the 
station of a curious monstrosity of Erica Tetralix.
The flower is 
small, and much less conspicuous than ordinary, and the style very 
prominent ; but the wonderful part is the apparent conversion of the 
eight anthers into as many cells of a seed-vessel.
It may be supposed I did not neglect the Bois de Boulogne, but I 
hardly know what line to recommend to an English botanist.
The 
wood is nearly flat, on a sandy soil, and for a Parisian botanist con- 
tains few rarities but such as are suspicious.
An English one, how- 
ever, may be gratified, especially if he visits it in May, with finding 
Convallaria Polygonatura and multiflora, Pulmonaria angustifolia, 
Melampyrum cristatum and Herniaria glabra ; or later in the season, 
Coronilla varia and Vei'onica spicata.
Perhaps the best line would 
be to enter by the gate at Passy, near to which, on the rubbish and 
broken ground occasioned by the new fortifications, M.
Bourgeau has 
lately found abundance of Centaurea melitensis.
After passrng the 
fortifications, we may keep northward to a great carrefour, that is, in 
this instance, to a large open circle where a great many roads unite.
A little to the north we find Thalictrum sylvaticum, also a discovery 
of M.
Bourgeau's, and if not a species, it is a variety well worth notice.
It is smaller than T.
minus, and differs from that in the manner in 
which it spreads itself over the ground, forming an almost continued 
and even covering.
We then turn to the west, to the gate of Long- 
champs, near which are Medicago orbicularis, Orobanche amethystea, 
&c., and passing the gate we descend to a gravel-pit, about which are 
Heliotropium europaeum, and several other plants not uncommon in 
such situations about Paris.
We re-enter the wood, and take the 
avenue of Grand Villiers, leading to the gate of Boulogne ; then take 
the first turning to the left, and near the turning, and for some dis- 
tance along the last-mentioned road, we find Potentilla pensylvanica, 
P. recta, Myagrum orientale and Brassica Cheiranthus : there is also 
a large variety of Thalictrum minus.
We go out of the gate of Bou- 
logne, and make our way at a little distance from the wood to the 
Point du jour.
I did not at the time visit this locality, but have a 
recollection of being much interested there some years ago.
On the 10th of July I took the rail-road to Versailles, and walked 
to the Etang du trou Sale.
My chief objects were Potentilla supina.
864 
Elatine alsinastrum, E.
hexandra and Scirpus supinus, but I suc- 
ceeded only with the first.
The Etang du trou Sale is a pool made 
by damming up a trifling valley, and the permanent supply of water 
is very small, if any, yet a number of persons engaged in angling may 
serve as a proof that it is never quite dry.
The sides are very nearly 
level, so that a fall of a few inches exposes a great extent of land 
overflowed in the winter.
In this part grows the Potentilla, this year 
in great abundance, but in some years it is said to be very sparingly 
scattered.
Here also is Gypsophila muralis, and an Alopecurus that 
is called fulvus, but which I think does not differ from A.
bulbosus.
Some of the plants have a decided swelling at the base of the stalk, 
others are as decidedly without it, and between these there is every 
possible step.
A little higher up we find Ly thrum hyssopifolium, and 
on the edge of the water, Littorella lacustris, Limosella aquatica and 
Scirpus acicularis.
For Scirpus supinus I am probably too early, as 
I believe it hardly flowers before September.
On the 14th I again accompanied M.
de Jussieu and his pupils : 
M. Delile and his son, and M.
Maire, were also of the party.
We 
went on the rail-road to Athys, where we crossed the water, traversed 
a cultivated plain, and afterwards followed a little stream to its source 
in the forest of Senart.
There is a good deal of boggy ground in this 
forest, where the face of the country seems to give little expectation 
of such a feature.
Our plants were Exacum CandoUii and filiforme, 
Juncus tenageya, Centunculus minimus and Potamogeton heterophyl- 
lus, all near the Carrefour des Cerfs.
Epipactis palustris and Chlora 
perfoliata, abundant on the boggy ground.
Utricularia minor, Inula 
salicina, Campanula cervicaria, Malva Alcea, Peucedanum parisiense, 
Selinum caruifolium, Stachys germanica, Polycnemum arvense, Stel- 
lera passerina, and Carex intermedia, the latter growing in the water, 
'and putting on an appearance different from that which it has with us.
We concluded our walk at Ris, where we again got on to a rail- 
road train, and reached Paris about 6 o'clock.
On looking back at the course I have held, I must acknowledge 
that my turning south at Mantes before reaching Paris was not well 
planned in point of Botany, though a view of the cathedral at Char- 
tres might be well worth such a deviation.
A better way would be to 
stop at Vernon.
There is a little valley above Vernon where perhaps 
something might be found, but the acknowledged spot of good Bota- 
ny in on the hill of St. Catherine, on the opposite side of the Seine.
From Vernon, descend in the steam-packet to the lesser Andelys, 
where the Rochers de St. Jacques on one side of the town, and Cha- 
865 
teau Gaillard on tlie other, give probably the richest harvest on the 
river from Paris to the sea.
A person who is not nice in his demands 
for accommodation, may be well entertained at the Chaine d'Or, at 
the little Andelys.
The larger would probably afford a larger inn.
From Andelys the botanist may again descend the Seine to the sta- 
tion which commmiicates with Louviers.
He would then have to 
pass twice on the rail-road the distance from that station to Vernon, 
but this would cost less time than to ascend the stream between the 
two places.
If after this he is inclined to stop at Mantes, he will find 
the best Botany on the hills on the north side of the river.

Observations on Hieracium nigrescens and H.
hypochoeroides.
In the last number (Phytol.
801), Mr. H.
Watson has called atten- 
tion to the plant which has been lately considered by English bota- 
nists as the Hieracium nigrescens ( JVilld.), and for my knowledge of 
which as a native of Scotland I am indebted to his kindness.
A spe- 
cimen now before me (gathered by Mr. Watson on Ben Aulder) agrees 
exactly with Bohemian specimens of H.
nigrescens received from Mr.
Tausch under that name; and as specimens from that botanist are ex- 
pressly referred to as representing the plant of Willdenow's herbarium 
by Mr. Froelich (DeCand.
Prod.
vii.
209), the latest general writer on 
the subject, I feel myself at liberty to consider that the Bohemian spe- 
cimens are authentic representations of the plant of Willdenow.
In 
addition to this the Scottish plant agrees well with the descriptions of 
H. nigrescens given by different authors, some of whom consider it as a 
distinct species, and others refer it, as an extreme form, to H.
alpinum.
Having now shown, I trust, sufficient reason for its name, I proceed 
to make a few observations upon its claims to specific distinction.
This is a subject upon which much difference of opinion exists, since 
some forms of H.
alpinum (H.
Halleri) approach very closely to it ; 
and it is only by long-continued cultivation, from seed, of this and H.
Halleri, that we can expect to arrive at a determinate opinion upon 
the subject.
I am unable to add anything to the character pointed out 
by Mr. Watson, as distinguishing this plant from all the forms of H.
alpinum, namely, the much broader and more strongly toothed leaves 
and the dark or nearly black involucre.
The difference of the colour 
4d 
866 
of the involucre seems to depend upon the comparative shortness of 
the hairs with which it is clothed ; they are terminated by a pale por- 
tion as in H.
alpinum, but that part is very short, thus allowing their 
lower part, which is black, to be much more distinctly seen.
These 
peculiar hairs will enable the plant to be distinguished from all forms 
of H.
murorum ; and in those specimens which produce more than 
one flower, the very acute angle between the peduncles is a certain 
character.
I do not venture to give any strong opinion upon the spe- 
cific claims of this plant, but am strongly inclined to think it distinct 
from H.
alpinum.
I hope now to be allowed to say a few words on the 
second plant referred to by Mr. Watson.
During a visit to the West 
Riding of Yorkshire in July last, I was shown by Mr. John Tatham, 
jun., the plant that has for many years been called Hypochoeris ma- 
culata by the botanists of that neighbourhood, growing upon rocks 
near Settle, and had no hesitation in calling it a form of Hieracium 
murorum.
T have now re-examined specimens from that place, and 
am fully confirmed in my opinion.
I consider Mr. S.
Gibson's H.
hypochceroides to be the same plant.
This is far from being an un- 
common plant, and is very often taken for the H.
maculatum {Sm.) or 
H, pulmonarium [Sm.], to which it is very closely allied, or the H.
pictum of authors.
H. maculatum is, according to my view, a much 
larger plant, with several stem-leaves, having a decurrent base to all 
the leaves, thus referring it to H.
sylvaticum.
The plant called H.
pictum from the falls of the Ogwen is the H.
rigidum, 7.
pictum of 
my Manual (p.
186), and quite distinct from all the forms of H.
mu- 
rorum or H, sylvaticum ; I possess it from Wastwater, Cumberland ; 
Falls of the Ogwen, and near Llanberis, Caernarvonshire ; and from 
near Thorngrafton, Northumberland.

434, Note on the Weymouth Stations of Lathyrus Nissolia and Sa- 
licornia radicans.
In reference to Mr. Gibson's remarks on the plants 
of Weymouth (Phytol.
735), and the Rev. A.
Bloxam's note (Id. 775) 
on the same subject, it may be worth mentioning that I was at Wey- 
mouth in 1837, immediately after Mr. Bloxam's visit, when I found 
Lathyrus Nissolia growing abundantly to the west of Portland Ferry, 
and Salicornia radicans, also abundantly, on the ground newly re- 
claimed from the Backwater.

Note on the Hieraciums.
You will perhaps allow me to thank 
Mr. Watson for his information on the subject of the Hieracium (Phy- 
tol.
801), Mr. Watson's remarks are very clear and satisfactory, and 
there is little doubt of the plant sent by Mr. Tatham " to the Botani- 
867 
cal Society of London," being the same as the one 1 alluded to (Phy- 
tol.
741), and there is no doubt of Mr. Tatham's having been led into 
the error by some of the botanical works alluded to by Mr. Watson ; 
but after this I would say that the plant sent by Mr. Tatham to that 
Society, was neither the H.
pulmonarium nor the H.
maculatum of 
Smith ; the latter plant does certainly grow about Malham-cove, and 
in cultivation remains perfectly unchanged; this is the H.
maculatum 
of our gardens, and if it be not a distinct species, it will be a variety 
of H.
sylvaticum, Stnitli.
It differs from the one which has been mis- 
taken for Hypochoeris maculata, in having its stem leafy, and in hav- 
ing more numerous flowers.
In all the specimens which I have seen 
of the other plants, the stems are without leaves, and as I have said 
(Phytol.
741), the plant is not described by any writer on British 
plants.

Note on Carex pseudo-paradoxa.
I am sorry to be so much 
at variance with Dr. Wood, in respect to several of his remarks on my 
Carex pseudo-paradoxa, I do not understand what is meant by his 
saying, " and considering myself in some degree obliged to maintain 
the correctness of the Flora of this neighbourhood," unless he would 
say that I have stated something relating to the Manchester Flora 
which is not correct; and this I have not done, neither do I wish to 
do it.
It appears that the Dr. and myself differ in our opinions as 
to how far Carex teretiuscula and my C.
pseudo-paradoxa may or 
may not be considered distinct as species.
Here I might ask what 
number of parts, and which of them, shall be looked upon as charac- 
teristic ?
But as that question has so often been asked, and no one 
can answer it, I will leave it as it is, and turn to the Dr., who has not 
noticed many particular parts of my C.
pseudo-paradoxa, and those he 
has noticed will go to prove that it is a very different plant from C.
teretiuscula.
I did not notice the roots of my plant in the descrip- 
tion which I gave of it (Phytol.
778), although I had been previously 
informed of its singular mode of growth ; this I declined, as I did not 
wish to describe anything which I had not seen myself.
The roots 
are the first which the Dr. takes notice of; he tells us that C.
tereti- 
uscula has a distinct mode of growth, and on the contrary that C.
pa- 
niculata has roots which form dense and elevated ceespites : he then 
says, " so far as my observations extend, this difference in the roots 
:s permanent." After this he tells us that my C.
pseudo-paradoxa, in 
the place where it is found, " has not the opportunity of displaying 
its characteristic property of isolation, and is compelled to increase 
by a regular approximation and aggregation of its roots." He also 
868 
says that " as we approach the water, however, it begins to separate 
itself into masses of various sizes, and in this manner assumes a pseu- 
do-csespitose appearance." This is, I think, carrying the thing too 
far ; first to tell us that the character of a plant is permanent, and 
then in the very next sentence to tell us how this permanent charac- 
ter can be changed.
Here I must beg of the Dr. to stand on even 
ground, as I shall allow him nothing for supposition, unless he would 
allow me to suppose that the roots of my C.
pseudo-paradoxa might 
be the roots of C.
paniculata, in a modified form.
This calls to me- 
mory the story of the oat being so much modified as to become rye.
The next thing the Dr. takes notice of, is " its elongate and slender 
stems, and its more racemose mode of inflorescence : " this, he says, 
led him and the friend who was with him to suspect it might possibly 
be something new to them.
There is nothing here but what will go 
to prove my plant to be very different from C.
teretiuscula.
The Dr.
says that the plant has a more racemose mode of inflorescence ; our 
editor tells us it has a spike â€” panicle he cannot call it.
Now I will 
see what characters it must have to be a spike, &c.
If it be a spike, 
the sessile or nearly sessile flowers are borne immediately upon an 
axis.
Is our plant so?
â€” No. If it be di panicle, the flowers are borne 
upon peduncles, which are variously branched, and seated upon an 
axis.
Is our plant so?
â€” No. If it be a raceme, the flowers are borne 
upon pedicels, which are generally single-flowered, and these again 
upon an axis.
Is our plant so ?
â€” No. If it be a thyrse, the flowers 
are in a panicle which is very closely compacted, so as to form an 
oval head.
Is our plant so ?
â€” Yes. The specimens now before me 
have their inflorescence composed of about six spikelets, two or three 
of the lower [ones] are again divided into about five or six spicula.
This I called a panicled spike (Phytol.
778), and this perhaps would 
be a better term, as thyrse is not in common use.
The next part of 
the plant which is taken notice of by the Dr. is the fruit.
Here I 
have to enquire what the Dr. means us to understand by the fruit ?
For Sir W.
Hooker, in describing the fruit of our Carices, takes no- 
tice of nothing more than the perigynium.
Sir J.
E, Smith makes a 
distinction between the fruit and the seed ; when he speaks of the pe- 
rigynium he calls it the fruit, when he speaks of the nut, he calls it 
the seed.
When Mr. Babington speaks of the fruit of a Carex, he 
means to be understood as speaking of the perigynium and nut toge- 
ther; and when he speaks of them separately, he expresses it as such.
When I speak of the fruit of a Carex, I speak of the nut only, as I do 
not consider the perigynium any part of the fruit.
If the Dr. is to be 
869 
understood as meaning the perigynium only, he is correct, but if when 
he speaks of the fruit, we are to understand the nut and perigynium 
separately, he is not correct when he says it " hardly, if at all, differs 
from that of Carex teretiuscula," as the nuts in these two Carices are 
very different, and will be found as 1 have described them (Phytol.
778), although the perigynia of the two are much alike, and this I have 
made no attempt to deny.
Here again 1 find the Dr. obliged to ad- 
mit that my plant puts on a different aspect and habit, he says it does 
this under the adventitious circumstances in which it grows.
A little 
lower I find him talking of a modified form : modifications and chan- 
ges will not do.
I must again caution the Dr. to keep in a direct road, 
for if he goes to one side I shall go to the other.
But this I will 
leave, and the next thing I shall notice is a modification of the fol- 
lowing words : " as a form of C.
teretiuscula with fruit as in panicu- 
laia^' (Phytol.
778).
These words I find so much modified as to stand 
as follows : â€” "a form of C.
teretiuscula with the fruit of C.
panicu- 
lataJ" There are two or three other things I might have noticed, but 
as I am now taking up too much of your space, I must beg of you to 
allow me to notice another (and perhaps the most important) point, 
and that is the secrecy.
The Dr. says that "no such thing as secrecy 
has been shown at all," and that I was never refused to have the place 
made known to me.
Here I cannot well make use of names, as the 
parties might not allow it ; but I will tell the Dr., that the individual 
he alludes to, after telling me he was not at liberty to go, did refuse 
to make the place known to me.
The refusal was made on the ground 
of its being nine miles from Manchester (I had been previously told 
it was three miles), and that if I were to go, 1 could not find the place.
The Dr. further says that I did not apply to any one else ; this I will 
say is not the case, as I made application, both by letter and other- 
wise.
I was about two hours with a person who knows where the 
plant grows, and I tried every artifice I could to induce him either to 
go with me to the place, or otherwise to procure me specimens ; but 
this was all to no purpose, and when I found that I could not procure 
them in a straightforward way, I resolved to go a little about for them.
And I will now tell the Dr. that the person whom he employs at times 
to collect plants for him, did receive 5s.
for going to fetch the speci- 
mens which I have now before me.
I should have had to offer a few 
remarks on our Editor's note, but will prefer waiting the result of his 
renewed examination, and for the present leave the subject.

Note on an apparently new British Carex.
I have much 
pleasure in announcing, through the medium of ' The Phytologist ' 
870 
the discovery (by Saml.
Hailstone, Esq., F.L.S., of Horton Hall, near 
Bradford) of a Carex which appears to me not to be described by any 
writer on British plants.
For this Carex I will propose the following 
name, and give a short description of it : but if it prove to be already 
described by continental botanists, under any other name, the one I 
have adopted will, of course, be given up.
Caeex Hailstoni (Mihi).
Stem about 18 inches high, three-angled, angles rough in the upper 
part, smooth below.
Leaves flat, sheathing the base of the stem, ta- 
pering at the point and rough on the edges.
Spike 2|- inches long, 
composed of about five alternate elongated spikelets, the lowermost of 
which is subtended by a bractea, which is somewhat longer than the 
spike : spikelets about an inch long, composed of about nine or ten 
spicula, these again are composed of about nine or ten staminiferous 
flowers : glumes ovate-acuminate, brown, with membranous edges.
The roots and fertile flowers are unknown to me ; perhaps the plant 
will be found to be a dioecious one, as I have not been able to find a 
single fertile flower in any of the specimens.
Locality, " In a bog in the 
meadow on the left hand of Ore lane, proceeding fi-om Hastings.
In 
the spring of the year 1834." This plant is perhaps still to be found 
in the same locality, and would be well worth the trouble of being 
looked for by any botanist who may at any time be in search of plants 
in the neighbourhood of Hastings.
This Carex is a very conspicuous 
one, and would soon be seen by any person who is acquainted with 
the genus.
It is now nine years since Mr. Hailstone discovered the 
plant ; and he says in his letter to me, that he had kept it in his her- 
barium separate and apart, as not being described by any author that 
he was aware of, as an English plant.

Erratum.
Perhaps you will allow me to correct a little error 
which appears in your last (Phytol.

read tieuter spikelets instead of outer spikelets.

Habitat for Cynodon Dactylon.
For the use of the youthful 
botanist resident in or near the great metropolis, to whom information 
of the whereabouts of any of the rarer species is a desideratum, I would 
mention that of Cynodon Dactylon, which I have seen in some abun- 
dance in the month of August, on Kew Green, Surrey.

not omit any part of the above note." We have however taken the liberty to omit an 
entire paragraph, in which no allusion is made to the Carices in question : the remain- 
der of Mr. Gibson's letter is printed verbatim.

Note on the genus Sphagnum.
The genus Sphagnum, which 
occupies such an important position in the economy of Nature, does 
not latterly appear to have received, in this country, the same degree 
of attention which is bestowed on many other genera of mosses.
Per- 
haps Sir W.J. Hooker's remark in the 'English Flora,' has dissuaded 
many persons from attempting to discriminate the species ; " as it is 
certain," he says, " that the limits of the species, if such they may be 
called, cannot be defined." The four species given in that work are 
sufficiently well marked in character, and if no other forms were to 
be met with, would be easily distinguished ; but the fact is, we have 
other forms, apparently quite as distinct, and fully as worthy of a 
name.
If I am correct in this statement â€” and I think no one will 
deny it â€” we must come to the conclusion either, like Linnaeus, to re- 
duce all to but one species, or to add a few to the existing number.
At the present time, when there is so general a disposition to multiply 
species, the former alternative is not very practicable, however rea- 
sonable it might be considered by some ; even if it were attempted, it 
could not stand the test oi facts, seeing that several of the admitted 
species may often be found growing intermixed, one with another, 
without losing their identity.
Nevertheless, to add a few species to 
the present number, is by no means an easy task ; for before that can 
be effected, the genus, in all its forms, must be carefully studied, in 
order to determine whether any characters may be relied on as per- 
manent, and if so, in what they consist.
By way of illustrating my 
views, I enclose for your inspection two specimens ; one, which I be- 
lieve to Sphagnum obtusifolium, var.
y.Jluitans, I found floating in 
water in Bulwell bog, Notts.
The fruit is situated about the middle 
of the stem, which circumstance, if the plant is to be considered a 
variety of S.
obtusifolium, will entirely neutralize any characters that 
might be drawn from lateral and terminal fruit.
The other specimen 
I cannot refer to any species whatever.
I found it abundantly in fruit 
on Oxton bog, Notts., together with S.
cuspidatum and S.
compactum 
{Bridel), the latter as mentioned by Dr. Howitt, in his Flora of the 
county.
Hoping that these remarks may gain for the subject the at- 
tention of persons who will be able to give more definite information 
I conclude with enquiring whether any of your correspondents can 
tell me what is meant by Sphagnum palustre, so often referred to in 
geological books and lectures?

I have noticed Veronica Bux- 
baumii for several years past, growing in great profusion in a hop- 
plantation in this neighbourhood : although it is frequently disturbed 
by the tillage of the soil, it appears to be as firmly established as ever, 
and has now as much the appearance of being a true native as its two 
allies, V.
polita and agrestis.

Note on the late flowering of the Fuchsia.
The extraordi- 
nary mildness of the closing months of last year has been universally 
remarked ; and the daily and weekly papers, in noticing this peculi- 
arity of the season, have more than once called the attention of their 
readers to such wonders as "roses blossoming," "young potatoes of 
the size of marbles," &c.; in addition, I may mention the following 
instance of a Fuchsia having renewed its youth, and strangely bud- 
ded and blossomed about a week ago.
The plant is kept in a flower- 
pot.
During last summer it blossomed in its season, like other plants.
In autumn its foliage withered and fell, and the plant reminded us of 
the approach of winter.
But winter never came; and the Fuchsia, as 
if hopeless of his approach, began to bud and finally to blossom.
At 
present it is clothed with leaves, â€” but leaves, not one of which is a 
third the size of its summer leaves.
Its flowers, too, are curious.
The 
corolla â€” small in any case, in this unnaturally so â€” retains its deep 
purple hue ; but the beautifully developed calyx, instead of being 
bright scarlet, as it ought, is of a pale pink colour â€” almost white.

Note on Polypodium fragrans.
In reference to the question 
respecting Polypodium fragrans (Phytol.
839), perhaps I may venture 
to ask Mr. Newman whether, in " collecting evidence," he has been 
reminded of an observation made by Rousseau, in his ' Lettres sur la 
Botanique.' I have not this work to refer to, but an extract taken 
from it a few years ago, is as follows.
" Je crois me rappeler, par ex- 
emple, qu' il s'y trouve quelques fougeres, entre autres le Polypodium 
fragrans, que j'ai herborisees en Angleterre, et qui ne sont pas com- 
munes partout." There is no reference to the number of the letter, 
but I believe it to be one towards the end of the volume.
Rousseau's 
residence, while in this country, was at Wootton-hall, Staffordshire, a 
neighbourhood in which it is highly probable Lastraea Oreopteris 
would be found : and it was with a view of ascertaining this that the 
extract was made : and my attention was attracted to the subject, by 
a note in the 7th edition of Withering's Botany, in which the editor, 
873 
after describing L.
Oreopteris, says, "the fragrant scent of this species 
is supposed to have induced Hudson to imagine it the P.
fragrans of 
Linnaeus." â€” M.
Beever ; Coiiiston, January 4, 1844.

Note on Poly podium fragrans.
In ' The Phytologist ' for the 
present month (Phytol, 839), Mr. Newman puts the following ques- 
tion, â€” " What is the Polypodium fragrans of Linneus ?
" stating, at 
the same time, that Wahlenberg, Roth, DeCandolle, Sadler, Smith, 
Hooker, Dietrich and Babington appear to take no notice of it.
Re- 
ference to Hooker and Greville's ' Icones Filicum ' will prove that 
Mr. Newman is in error in supposing Sir Wm. Hooker to have omit- 
ted mention of this fern, as in vol.
i. tab.
70, it is represented under 
the name of Nephrodium fragrans (Polypodium fragrans, Linn., being 
given as a synonyme), from specimens collected by Capt.
Parry in the 
Island of Igloolik, during one of his expeditions to the Arctic regions.
I have in my herbarium a specimen presented by Miss A.
E. Griffiths, 
gathered by her brother, William Griffiths, Esq.
(who accompanied 
Capt.
Parry) in Melville Island, which, though not so large, would yet 
be immediately detected as the same species.
It appears also that 
Sir W.
Hooker has described P.
fragrans, L.
in the Appendix to Par- 
ry's Second Voyage, and that Swartz, Willdenow, Sprengel and Rich- 
ardson have noticed it.
The object of Mr. Newman in putting this 
question, appears to be a wish to identify the Polypodium fragrans, 
Lin., with either the Aspidium Oreopteris, Sic, or the Aspidium rigi- 
dum, Schkuhr, and thus to apply the Linnaean name to one of our in- 
digenous species.
It is true that Hudson adopts this name, but not 
having a copy of his work, I cannot quote his characters, and hazard 
an opinion of my own as to their application.
This however is of lit- 
tle consequence, as Sir J.
E. Smith, in his ' English Flora,' gives 
Hudson's P.
fragrans, with a note of interrogation, as a synonyme of 
Asp. Oreopteris, Sw., and says that this latter plant " exhales, more 
or less constantly, a fragrant scent, whence perhaps Mr. Hudson 
might take it for Polypodium fragrans of Linnaeus, which is a very 
distinct North-American species." If we refer to the description of 
P. fragrans, L., as given in the ' Sy sterna Naturae,' we shall find it to 
be as follows.
" P.
frondibus subbipinnatis lanceolatis : foliolis con- 
fertis : lobis obtusis serratis, stipite paleaceo." Aspidium Oreopteris, 
Sw., will most certainly not answer to these characters, it being, ac- 
cording to Mr. Newman in his beautiful work on British Ferns, "pin- 
nate, the pinnae rather distant and pinnatifid, the pinnules rounded 
and slightly crenate ; " so slightly crenate indeed, that the figures re- 
present the pinnulae as scarcely undulate.
The question then becomes 
4e 
874 
nan-owed to the Nephrodium fragrans of Hooker and Greville's ' Ico- 
nes ' and the Lastrsea rigida of English botanists.
Now to the first 
of these the Linna^an description alone strictly applies, both as to the 
form of the frond, ^'' lanceolate,^'' and the heaping together, "confertas," 
of the pinnae.
Svrartz describes the frond of L.
rigida as ovato-lan- 
ceolate, which quite agrees with my specimens of the plant from York- 
shire and Lancashire : the pinnae also are not closer than in the great 
mass of bipinnate Lastrasae.
I would here remark that in the section 
of Polypodium in which P.
fragrans is described in the ' Systema Na- 
turae,' the term " confertae " is not employed, except with reference to 
the pinnae of P.
fragrans.
These comparisons are, in my opinion, suf- 
ficient to prove that Linnaeus applied the specific name of " fragrans " 
to the fern which is figured in the ' I cones Filicum ' as Nephrodium 
fragrans.
It is indeed true that difference of soil and temperature 
might produce such a change, as to cause both an approximation of 
all the pinnae, and a shortening of the lower ones, so as to make the 
fronds of Aspidium rigidum, Sw., correspond to two of the Linnaean 
characters, (as I have observed in Asplenium lanceolatum, Sw,) ; but 
I think we have no right to assume that the great founder of Syste- 
matic Botany took his description from an aberrant form, when we 
have a species whose normal characteristics so well agree with those 
given in the ' Systema Naturae.' That Lastraea rigida and Lastraea 
firagrans are distinct types of the same species, no one who has com- 
pared the plants, side by side, will, I am confident, be inclined to ad- 
mit : â€” the elongated acute triangular pinnae of the former can never 
be converted into the oblong obtuse ones of the latter.
An examina- 
tion of the specimens of Polypodium fragrans, in the Linnaean herba- 
rium would perhaps settle the question ; and I would therefore advise 
Mr. Newman to avail himself of his means of access to the said col- 
lection, in order to obtain as much information as possible upon the 
subject.
If these specimens agree with the Linnaean description, all 
doubt will be removed : if not, we must conclude that through mis- 
take they have found their way into the collection, and we must con- 
sequently revert to the published characters.
I am inclined to agree 
in the spirit of Reichenbach's observation, though not to participate 
in the sneer on the value of the Linngean herbarium, when he says, 
" Opera viri magni mundo communia sunt, herbarium fallax imico pos- 
sessore gaudet." â€” W.

Note on the Polypodium fragrans of Hudson.
The Polypo- 
dium fragrans of Hudson (quaere Linn.) seems to be considered as a 
mere nominis umbra by all modern writers on ferns ; and yet there is 
875 
satisfactory evidence that such a plant did formerly exist.
Sprengel, 
in his work on the Cryptogamia (Koenig's translation) thus character- 
izes the species.
AsiyicUumfragrans.
With bipinnate frond, the pri- 
mary leaflets ovate-lanceolate, the secondary very narrow, sharp- 
toothed, and their lower surface thickly clothed with scales, and with 
the involucres of the spots of the capsules.
The stem about one foot 
long is closely beset with broad chaffy scales.
Now Sprengel was 
acquainted with this species from specimens, which he states he re- 
ceived from Alton, who observed it was a native of England.
A plant 
answering to the description did then exist at the time, and most pro- 
bably in the Kew garden, although it is not introduced into the ' Hor- 
tus Kewensis.' Sprengel could not have confounded this fern with 
Aspidium (Lastraea) rigidum, which he describes in the work from 
which this description is taken, and much less with Aspidium Oreop- 
teris, for he expressly censures Bolton for considering Hudson's P.
fragrans as identical with his (Bolton's) Polypodium Thelypteris (Asp.
Oreopteris).
The last species smells exactly like orange-peel, whilst 
Sprengel's Asp. fragi'ans is stated to smell like raspberries, and to be 
a Siberian as well as British species.

Note on Cystopteris montana.
Cystopteris montana, recently 
described in ' The Phytologist ' as a newly-discovered British plant, 
(Phytol.

Plukenet, who figured it in his ' Phytographia,' tab.
89, fig.
4, but I 
have not seen the figure.

BOTANICAL SOCIETY OF LONDON.
November 17, 1843.
â€” J.
E. Gray, Esq., F.R.S., President, in tlie Chair.
Dr. Broinfield presented a specimen of a species of Calamintha, new to the British 
Flora, discovered by him in the Isle of Wight, (Phytol.
768).
Read " Notes of a Botanical Excursion in Warwickshire, Worcestershire, Wales, 
and Ireland," hy Mr. S.
P. Woodward.
The first week, spent by Mr. Woodward in 
Worcestershire, afforded him very little scope for botanizing, the interest of the coun- 
try being chiefly geological.
The only ferns met with near Birmingham, were Athy- 
rium Filix-femina and Lastraea dilatata, on the borders of Edgbaston pond ; and in 
the vicinity of Kiddeiminster Mr. W.
could not find even these.
On the Clint hills 
Malva moschata and Campanula patula were the only conspicuous flowers in the hedge- 
rows.
These hills are of trap rock, but as they present no escarpments, and have no 
rills or ponds, they are entirely destitute of ferns.
The limestone hills of Dudley-cas- 
tle and the Wren's nest, appear to be in the same predicament, not even the Polypody 
grows there, and on the old castle one solitary bit of Ruta-muraria was all Mr. W.
could discover : Cuicus eriophorus is very abundant about the castle.
Lastraea dila- 
876 
lata grows amongst the furze on the Rubury hill, which is a ridge of altered Caradoc 
sandstone flanking the Bromsgrove Lickey.
The ALberley hills present more variety 
of soil and aspect, and consequently afi"ord better botanizing ground.
At a spring- 
head near Abberley church, Oreopteris and Filix-femina are in tolerable abundance ; 
the brake is plentiful on the hills, and in a hedge near the Hundred-house, Polypodi- 
um vulgare and Polystichmu angulare occur sparingly.
Lastrsea spinulosa grows near 
Great Witley, and Equisetum Tehnateia is plentiful in a quarry within sight of the 
Hundred-house, conspicuous on account of its vertical beds of limestone.
Near Malvern, Lastrisea dilatata and Equisetum sylvaticum abound in the woods, 
and Polystichum angulare on the banks of small ravines in the Wenlock shale.
Pte- 
ris and Lomaria are also on the high ground, and Ceterach on the church.
The 
Malvern hills are a range of trap rock, from 6 to 14,000 feet in height, and on their 
eastern flank which is least exposed to wind and sun and covered in many places with 
a talus of fallen fragments of rock, there is excellent accommodation for ferns.
Po- 
lypodium vulgare, Lastrasa dilatata and Filix-mas, Athyrium Filix-femina, Asplenium 
Trichomanes and Adiantum-nigrum are abundant, some of them very nearly to the 
summit of the hills.
The principal flowers in the thickets were Campanula Trache- 
lium, Vicia sylvatica, Chlora perfoliata, and the betony and foxglove ; and upon the 
stone walls.
Cotyledon and Cardamine Impatiens.
Mr. W.
gathered Asplenium Tri- 
chomanes again on the walls of the Cathedral-precinct at Gloucester, and on the walls 
and bridge near Crickhowell and Brecon, Ruta-muraria and Ceterach are abundant.
Mr. W.
believed these walls to be built with the limestone occurring in the middle of 
the old red sandstone series.
Filix-femina is plentiful on the banks of the Wye and 
Towey.
At Caermarthen Mr. W.
saw Adiantum-nigrum and Trichomanes on many 
of the stone walls, and on the walls of Lord Dynevor's park near Llandeilo, the Poly- 
pody grew so luxuriantly as to make him very desirous of ascertaining whether it could 
be the Cambricum, which he had never seen or heard of growing except in gardens.
Passing over from Pembroke to Waterford, Dungarvan and Youghal, the aspect 
of the country is entirely changed.
Instead of the rivers winding through rich corn- 
valleys and deep woods, one dreary expanse of grey rocks and purple heather is all 
that meets the eye often for many miles.
Occasionally the country is intersected by 
deep glens, but they are seldom wooded; and both in the low boggy ground and ou 
the hills, cultivation seems scarcely to produce any effect in softening the air of deso- 
lation spread all around.
In the stone walls bordering the roads and separating the 
fields Filix-mas and Filix-femina are everywhere seen ; Scolopendrium, Pteris, Lo- 
maria and Lastrsea dilatata are also very general.
In the dry stony fields the brilliant 
spikes of Lythrum Salicaria seemed to have taken the place of the foxglove and nettle- 
bell of our English hedge-rows, and by its abundance and beauty attracted the atten- 
tion and admiration of Mr. Woodward's fellow-travellers.
At Glenbower near Youghal 
HYmenophyllum Tonbridgense grows most luxuriantly, and Trichomanes speciosum 
is also said to have been found.
During his stay in Cork, Dr. Thos.
Power took Mr.
W. to see the habitat of the Trichomanes in the Temple-Michael glen, at the top of 
Glen-mire.
There is very little of the plant, and it is not known to fructify.
In this 
glen there is sometimes a low scanty growth of the " Irish oak," not nearly so conspi- 
cuous however as Euphorbia Hibernica, Bartsia viscosa and Gnaphalium rectum, and 
Carex pulicaris grows in the glen and its vicinity ; and here Mr. W.
first met with 
Lastrtea dumetorum growing along with L.
dilatata, and presenting its usually very 
distinct appearance.
Hymeuophylluui grows scantily in this glen, and from exposure 
877 
is all dried up by the beginning of autumn.
The other ferns noticed near Cork were 
Scolopendrium, Aspleniura Ruta-muraria, Trichomanes and Adiantum-nigruni, Las- 
trÂ£ea Filix-mas, Athyrium Filix-femina, Polypodium vulgare, Lomaria spicant and 
Polystichum aculeatum.
from Cork Mr. W.
took the mail to Bantry, passing through Bandon, about four 
miles from which Trichomanes speciosum grows more strongly than near Cork, but 
still is always barren.
About Bandon and Innishannon the Polypody grows abun- 
dantly on walls, attaining a very large size, and much of it, Mr, W.
believed, would 
turn out to be proliferous.
About the rocky roads and salmon-streams of this neigh- 
bourhood, the common Filix-mas and Filix-femina grew more luxuriantly than Mr.
W. had ever seen elsewhere.
Further on, at Clonakilty, Erica vagans and Mackaii are said to grow.
Between 
Skibbereen and Bantry, and indeed in all the mountainous parts of Cork and Kerry, 
Lomaria spicant is the most abundant of ferns.
At Bantry Mr. W.
took Mr. Newman' Irish Notes in his hand, and strolled out 
to see Lord Bearhaven's seat and park.
The Irish variety of the Polypody was found 
growing as described, on the park-wall ; and on ascending the hill from which Mr. N.
watched the sunset over the bay, with its bright islands and mountain coast, he start- 
led a flock of curlews from their daily resting-place, which is usually occupied at night 
by the rooks and jackdaws.
In a belt of plantation below this hill there is abundance 
of Polystichum angulare, Lastrasa Filix-mas and dilatata, Athyrium Filix-femina and 
Lomaria spicant ; and the hill itself is half covered with Pteris, which does not usual- 
ly abound, or attain its customary luxuriance in the south of Ireland.
Following the 
example of Mr. Newman, Mr. W, took a boat and crossed the bay to GlengarifT; and 
the next day walked on to Kenmare, missing Hungry-hill and the Menziesia polifolia, 
as he was anxious to spend a day with Dr. Taylor at Dunkerran castle.
In GJengariff 
he found both species of Hymenophyllum, a profusion of Osmunda, Lastraea dilatata 
and dumetorum, Lomaria, Filix-femina, Pteris and Polypody, but no Trichomanes, 
although several botanists have tried to introduce it there.
There are fine woods of 
birch, hawthorn.
Arbutus, ^c, around the hotel of GlengarifT; and the hills around 
are covered with peat to their summits, so as to render the new mountain road with its 
tunnel far from unwelcome.
The rocks by the road-side were everywhere covered with 
Polytrichum urnigerum in fructification ; and Saxifrages and Sedums were all out of 
fruit.
Much of the grass on the rocks (Festuca ovina ?) is viviparous; but except the 
blue Jasioue and Erica Tetralix, there were few flowers remaining even in the beoin- 
ning of August.
Mosses, Jungermannias and Lichens abound everywhere.
Dr.
Taylor named the following : â€” 
Trichostomum polyphyllum and fascicu- Hypnum ruscifolium.
Rills and springs, 
lare.
Rocks.
Polytrichum commune, gracile, abides, 
lanuginosum.

and tomentella.
In company with Dr. Taylor, Mr. W.
went to Blackwater-bridge, which is a fa- 
mous cryptogamic garden of Dr. T.'s ; and there he pointed out species innumerable 
of Jungermannia, Marchantia, Sticta, Hypnnm, Hookeria, Pterogonium, Bryum Sec 
878 
The stream runs through a wooded glen, the rocks of which are everywhere overgrown 
with mosses and ferns, Hymenophyllum, Asplenium Trichomanes and Adiantum-ni- 
grum, Lastraea dilatata, Scolopendrium, Filix-femina &c.
Euphorbia Hiberna was 
in fruit, Bartsia viscosa in full flower in the fields, Hieracium Taylori &c., and in the 
hedges round Dr. Taylor's garden, Dunkerron, Lastraea spinulosa was found, the only 
spot in Kerry where Mr. W.
met with it.
On Dunkerron mountain Dr. Taylor finds 
Lastreea dumetorum, and an Equisetum, which is in Mr. Newman's hands to be named.
Every one who has been at Killarney will be rejoiced to escape the infliction of a 
description, and to those who have not yet visited its famous lakes and water-falls and 
the bays of the neighbouring coast, no description would give any adequate idea.
Mr.
W. was not particularly successful in finding ferns, his attention being constantly oc- 
cupied by the novelty and grandeur of the views, and the multitude of other objects 
equally interesting.

ers, Mangarton, Saxifraga umbrosa and stellaris, Orobanche minor, Muckruss abbey, 
Circaea Lutetiana, Lysimachia nemorum, Anagallis tenella, Veronica officinalis, Cha- 
maedrysand serpyllifolia, Lotus corniculatus, Epipactis latifolia, abundant, a few flow- 
ers remaining, Calluna vulgaris with white flowers.
Mr. Woodward afterwards visited Brandon hill, on the Dingle promontory, and ga- 
thered Polystichum Lonchitis and Cystopteris dentata in the clefts of the rocks near 
its summit; also Asplenium Adiantum-nigrum, Trichomanes and marinum, Athyrium 
Filix-femina, Polypodium vulgare, Hymenophyllum Wilsoni, Lastraea dilatata, dume- 
torum and Filix-mas, Osmunda regalis, Lomaria spicant and Pteris aquiliua.
The plants in flower were Carex (Ederi and pilulifera, which form great part of the 
herbage; Juncus squarrosus, Jasione perennis, Tormentilla, Polygala, Utricularia mi- 
nor, the wild thyme, Rbinanthus, Oxyria, Pedicularis palustris, Scabiosa succisa.
Ranunculus Flammiila, Hypericum elodes very abundant, H.

garis, Veronica serpyllifolia, Lythrum Salicaria, Lycopus europaeus, Angelica sylves- 
tris, Silene maritima, Statice Armeria (in flower on the summit of Brandon, 3150 feet 
879 
aliove the sea), and Narthecium ossifragum, a few flowers of which still lingered.
Pin- 
guicula grandiflora, the leaves of which spread out in yellow stars over the ground in 
every part of Kerry, was entirely out of flower.
Mr. W.
was not at the time aware of 
Mr. Moore's discovery of the Trichomanes at Mount Eagle, and was unable to spare 
a day for the search after Adiantum at Cahir Conree or Sihthorpiaat the Conner cliffs.
Passing up the Shannon to Lough Derg, Mr. W.
noticed Ceterach, Trichomanes and 
Euta-muraria on the stone walls and bridges ; after which his botanizing was confined 
to the College and Glasnevin Botanic Gardens at Dublin.
November 29, 1843.
â€” Seventh Anniversary Meeting.
J. Reynolds, Esq., Treasurer, 
in the chair.
From the Report of the Council it appeared that 13 new members had been elect- 
ed since the last anniversary ; and that the Society now consists of 159 members.
The Report of the Herbarium-committee was read, and stated that many inte- 
resting British plants had been presented, including several species of Carices collected 
by the late Mr. G.
Don, which were presented by Mr. S.
P. Woodward.
Specimens 
of Carex paradoxa (Willd.), Borkhausia setosa {DC), Neottia gemmipara, Convalla- 
ria bifolia, Statice rariflora, and other valuable plants, had been received.
Mr. Edwin 
Lees had presented a collection of British Rubi, comprising nearly all the species.
Numerous interesting Irish plants had been received from Mr. W.
Andrews, in- 
cluding many duplicates of Trichomanes speciosum.
Distribution of Duplicates.
â€” The parcels of plants sent to the members in return 
for their contributions had given much satisfaction : and in nearly every instance the 
Committee were enabled to send the return parcel within a fortnight after the receipt 
of the contributor's own parcel.
Since the printing of the Catalogue of British Plants now used by the members in 
marking their desiderata, several new species have been added to the Flora of the 
country, which, of course, do not appear in the catalogue.
As far as these novelties 
can be obtained, the Committee will distribute them through the parcels sent out to 
contributors, together with any other specimens which may aS'ord the opportunity for 
correcting errors of nomenclature, or in any way elucidating the Botany of Britain.
For the common benefit of members it is particularly requested that contributors will 
send as many duplicates as they can of all such novelties.
Among the specimens now ready for distribution are the following.
A few speci- 
mens of Statice rariflora, obtained through the kindness of Mr. Notcutt ; an ample 
supply of the true Crepis biennis, presented by the Rev. A.
Bloxam; the true Primula 
elatior {Jacq.), received from Mr. E.
Doubleday, together with the varieties of P.
vul- 
garis, which are often mistaken for the former.
The true Eriophoron gracile (Koch), 
known to very few English botanists before the summer of 1842.
Linaria spartea, na- 
turalized at Walton, in Surrey.
Bromus commutatus {Schrader), so very frequently 
misnamed B.
arvensis (Linn.) Varieties of Betula alba, which are described as spe- 
cies by several botanical authorities.
Festuca loliacea passing into F.
pratensis ; Lo- 
lium multiflorum, &c.
Label-Book.
â€” The original labels sent with specimens are carefully preserved, and 
those which are not required for introduction into the reference-herbarium along with 
the specimens, will be fastened into a book, as a permanent record of the localities in 
which the specimens have been collected.
Local Herbaria.
â€” Dr. Ayres has sent a portion of the Flora of Thame, Oxfordshire, 
and engaged to complete it ; and a full set of the flowering plants of Eshcr, in Sur- 
880 
rev, has been collected, and will be sent to the Society as soon as they can be glued 
down to paper in the manner prescribed by the Committee.
Other members are collect- 
ing the herbaria of their respective districts, and the Committee hope, next year, to re- 
port the addition of several local herbaria.
Foreign Plants.
â€” The donations of foreign plants received during the past season 
far exceeds that of any fonner year.
The Royal Horticultural Society of Cornwall 
has sent a very large collection of East-Indian plants, comprising specimens collected 
at Madras by Dr. Wight, and at Assam by Major Jenkins.
A very large collection of North-American plants had been received from Dr. Ga- 
vin Watson and Mr. R.
Kilvington; and Mr. E.
Doubleday had presented 300 species 
from Ohio.
A collection of specimens from Western Australia has been presented by 
Mr. Turner ; and Mr. Adam Gerard has sent some valuable plants collected at Sierra

Cryptogamic Collection, {Ferns).
â€” British ferns have been received from various 
members ; and in every instance where specimens have been received from localities 
not hitherto recorded in the collection, the most characteristic have been selected and 
introduced, in accordance with the principle laid down by the Committee, of extend- 
ing the series to every locality that can be obtained for the rare species, and every 
county or district for the more abundant.
It has also been made an object to ascer- 
tain the geological range of each, as well as its geographical distribution.
The abun- 
dant supply of Lastraea cristata, Asplenium lanceolatum, Adiantum Capillus-Veneris, 
and Trichomanes speciosum, has enabled the Committee to distribute them to all 
members who applied for specimens.
Mosses, TAchens, HepaticcB and AlgcB.
â€” The following species of mosses new to the 
British Flora, have been presented by Dr. Thomas Taylor : â€” Trichostomum saxatile 
{Taylor, MS.), and Bryum recurvifolium {Taylor, MS.) ; and the following new spe- 
cies of Hepaticse : â€” Jungermannia reclusa, fragilifera, germana and riparia (all Tay- 
lor, MSS.) : together with authentic specimens of the newly -determined species, â€” 
Dicranum scoparium and D.
Dillenii {Taylor).
Mr. G.

Thwaites has sent a 
large collection of mosses, chiefly collected by him in the neighbourhood of Bristol, 
including many new species.
Dr. Ayres has forwarded specimens of Peziza cautecau- 
lis and Hystericum rubrum discovered by him in Oxfordshire.
In concluding their Report, the Committee called upon the members for renewed 
exertions to make the collection forming by the Society as complete as possible, and to 
render their herbarium a permanent standard for the determination of plants : and 
members and contributors are particularly requested to send monstrosities, and any 
specimens differing from the common form.
The Reports of the Council and Herbarium Committee were unanimously adopted ; 
a ballot then took place for the Council for the ensuing year : when J.

â€” Researches in Embryogeny.
By W.
Wilson, Esq.
(Continued from p.
735).
The following is a summary of what has already been published in 
the ' London Journal of Botany ' for December, and is here added as 
a necessary sequel to what has already appeared in 'The Phytologist.' 
Since the timp when Dr. Giraud's article on Tropaeolum majus was 
partially noticed, I have made that plant the subject of close exami- 
nation ; and the result is that I am compelled to dissent from Dr. Gi- 
raud's account in several particulars.
It is especially objectionable 
because (contrary to the evident design of the writer) it lends undue 
countenance to the theory of Schleiden, in the erroneous statement 
that there exists a traceable mass of " conducting tissue of the style 
into the carpellary cavity as far as the exostome." In researches like 
these, it is seldom that the positive statements of other observers can 
be absolutely disproved ; but here the error admits of demonstration.
Dr. Giraud says concerning the " suspensor," that its upper extremity 
protrudes " through the apex of the nucleus and the micropyle," and 
that from this extremity a number of cells " hang loosely in the pas- 
sage leading to the conducting tissue of the style, while the rest unite 
in forming a process which passes down the outer side of the ovulum 
within the carpellary cavity." Here we have the position of the 
supposed passage distinctly marked, as being above the micropyle ; 
whereas it will be seen that the supposed " loosely hanging cells " 
must belong to a particular portion of the " suspensor" which never 
protrudes beyond the micropyle in the manner that it is stated to do.
The curious structure and development of this part has escaped the 
scrutiny no less of Dr. Giraud than of Schleiden and other observers.
In the following remarks I shall adopt the term suspensor for the body 
extending upwards from the embryo, though I am not satisfied that it is 
quite in accordance with the original views of Mirbel thus to apjjly it.
Schleiden, in his attempt to account for the manner in which the sus- 
pensor gains egress from the coats of the ovulum (for there are really two 
of these surrounding the nucleus), invents a spurious theorj'-, and gravely 
asserts that these coats become " obliterated " or undergo " resorp- 
tion ; " and thus the apex of the suspensor is laid bare ; whereupon 
it assumes the form represented at fig.
3 ; the part a being directed

towards the axis of the flower.
Dr. Ghaud, on the other hand, as po- 
sitively asserts that the suspensor passes out at the micropjle, through 
which " it may be drawn by a slight traction completely out of the 
nucleus, along with the suspended embryo." Both of these accounts 
are quite at variance with the fact.
The swelled knob, J, never ex- 
tends beyond the micropyle, but is in every stage included within the 
coats of the nucleus, and from this knob are sent forth two filamen- 
tous processes, of which only the posterior one [c) has hitherto been 
noticed.
This process does not pass out at the micropyle, but perfo- 
rates the coats of the ovule immediately below it on the outer side.
Fig. 4.
â€” Longitudinal section of the ripe seed : â€” d the micropyle; /the exti'einity of the anterior process 
of the suspensor.
The posterior process is continued from b to g ; e the embryo.
The anterior process (Â«) fii'st pushes its way through the substance of 
the neck of the ovule ; then tlu'ough what may be considered the pla- 
cental tissue.
It then reaches, or forms for itself, in the substance of 
the carpellum, at its inner angle, a canal which lies parallel with and 
very near to the common axis of the three carpella ; and passing along 
this canal the process arrives at the lowest point of attachment of the 
carpellum with the receptacle where there exists a small pore.
The 
carpellary integument would thus seem to constitute an essential part 
4f 2 
884 
of the seed, and its removal before sowing would most likely prevent 
the seed from germinating ; for it seems reasonable to conclude that 
the two processes of the suspensor exercise the function of radicles ; 
and at least one of these would be broken off in the act of removing 
the carpellary coat.
It is a curious circumstance that the ovulum in 
this genus has no free funiculus, and that its coats forming the pri- 
mine and secundine are so blended with the rest of the tissue which 
connects the ovulum with the carpellum, that no positive line of sepa- 
ration can be detected in that part.
Indeed it is only by an attentive 
examination of the micropyle that the existence of two coats can be 
clearly ascertained.
It is proper that I should notice here another somewhat mistaken 
view entertained by Dr. Giraud, who states that there exists before 
impregnation " a small elliptical cavity near the apex of the nucleus, 
having a delicate lining membrane formed by the walls of the sur- 
rounding cells : this cavity is the erabryo-sac, and a minute canal 
may be traced leading from it to the exostome." It would be more 
appropriate to say that the memhranous lijiing of the cavity consti- 
tutes the embryo-sac.
The cavity, however, is not confined to the 
apex of the nucleus : its form and dimensions are represented at fig.
1, which exhibits a longitudinal section of the ovule and the contain- 
ed nucleus.
If the lining of this cavity be, as I suppose, the embryo- 
sac, the contained embryo with its suspensor must have a different 
relation to it from what has been hitherto advanced by either Schlei- 
den or Mirbel ; for about the period of fecundation the embryo forms 
a small elliptical body, very much smaller than the cavity in which it 
is lodged ; it is indeed so minute as to be with great difficulty displayed 
under the microscope.
Its position and relative size are dimly seen at d, 
fig.
1, and more clearly represented in the more highly magnified fig.
2. 
This rudimentary embryo is described in Dr. Giraud's paper as " a 
quantity of organizable mucilage enclosed in the embryo-sac." It is 
true that the whole of the nuclear cavity is lined with a lax delicate 
membrane, easily separable fi'om the nucleus itself; and that at the 
time when the suspensor is about to perforate the coats of the ovule, 
this membrane may be traced from the apex of the suspensor to the 
bottom of the cavity, clearly disproving what Schleiden has asserted 
concerning the introversion of the embryo-sac by the intrusion of a 
pollen-tube.
I am at a loss to understand in what mode Dr. Giraud has been 
able to identify " the fovilla and its granules," which he records as 
having been found abundantly in the passage leading from the style 
to the exostome, at the time indicated by his " fourth period." If the 
885 
process a of fig.
2 be regarded as a kind of finger-post, it would lead 
to the conclusion that he has mistaken for fovilla the particles of 
amylon which are found in abundance in the neck of the ovulum.

â€” Reply to Mr. Edmonstori's * Hemarks on Botanical 
Classijication.' By Ph. B.
Ayres, Esq., M.D.
Thame, Oxon, January 20th, 1844.
Sir, 
I have waited, until now, with the expectation that 
some more able correspondent of your journal would have replied to 
the remarks of Mr. Edmonston on the natural arrangement of plants; 
but as no one has come forward, I shall endeavour to answer his ob- 
jections to that system.
With his first propositions, "that the present system of entirely 
dispensing with an introductory or artificial scheme, is not only wrong- 
in theory and opposed to the principles of philosophical classifica- 
tion, but almost impracticable in practice ; " and, " that a simple ar- 
tificial scheme is absolutely necessary as an easy introduction to the 
study of the science, by which a sufficient knowledge of species may 
be gained to enable the student to turn to the more complicated ge- 
neralizations of the other system ; " â€” I in part agree.
That an arti- 
ficial scheme is necessary to an east/ acquirement of the science, is 
tantamount to saying that an alphabetical arrangement is necessary to 
the finding easily any particular subject in a bulky Encycloposdia, or 
a good index to any other work of reference ; and such is the artificial 
system of Linnisus to the vegetable kingdom.
The assertion of the 
absolute impracticability of learning Botany without the assistance of 
an artificial scheme is absurd ; inasmuch as species may be discovered 
by the natural system, although, I acknowledge, with greater diffi- 
culty.
It is easier, for example, to find a species in any work on 
descriptive Botany, provided the name be known, by turning to the 
index, than to wade through the descriptions of classes, orders and 
genera to arrive at it.
Exactly in the same manner is it easier to turn 
to the Linnsean index, than to wade through the long analyses of na- 
tural orders given in Lindley's 'Introduction to the Natural System.' 
With similar restrictions we may acquiesce in the third proposition, 
" that what was then (in the time of Linnaeus) necessary for the state 
of botanical knowledge generally, is, I contend, still indispensible to 
students individually ; " that is, a good index of plants !
886 
From the next proposition I must entirely dissent ; namely, that 
" Nature creates species ; " for it is easy to perceive that the term spe- 
cies is applied to an assemblage of individuals, which, from their 
great resemblance to each other, and from their capability of propa- 
gating their like, are called species.
Were the creation of species 
allowed, I cannot see any rational objection to the admission that ge- 
nera, orders, classes, &c.
were created ; for what is true of a smaller 
assemblage may be true of a larger one.
On the other hand, I contend 
that Nature simply created individuals capable of propagating their 
kind ; and if we trust to the Mosaic account of the creation, we shall 
see reason to believe that plants as well as animals were individually 
created.
It is evident that the term species applies to one of the pri- 
mary inductions from a comparison of individuals; notthata specieshas 
any absolute existence, but is merely the conception or expression of 
the points of resemblance of a certain number of individuals bearing 
the greatest resemblance to each other.
Another argument against 
Mr. Edmonston's view, is the fact of the existence of varieties ; a still 
lower induction from individuals !
Two other propositions are contained in the same paragraph of Mr.
Edmonston's letter.
1. That it is difficult to establish the hypothesis 
that Nature has created plants upon a certain plan, and thrown them 
into classes, orders, genera and species : and â€” 2.
That this scheme of 
Nature is identical with one or other of the natural systems.
I cannot discover the difficulty that Mr. Edmonston conjures up 
against the proof that Nature has followed a plan in the creation of 
])lants ; for the fact that a plan has been followed in their creation, is 
established by the simple fact, that plants are capable of being ar- 
ranged and distributed into classes, orders, genera and species ; for 
had they been created at random, they would form a chaotic mass, 
and no such regular gradation of affinities could have been establish- 
ed.
The very fact that one great group of plants possesses distinct 
sexual organs, while another is destitute of them ; and that the indi- 
viduals belonging to these two great divisions possess many other 
points in common (as for example the presence of vessels in the sex- 
ual group), and that these are connected by certain oscillatory groups ; 
is sufficient evidence of a plan in the creation of plants.
Unless a 
plan were followed, all attempts at classification would be futile.
By what I have said above I do not mean to infer that what we 
term classes, orders, genera and species were formed by Nature, for 
that would give these abstractions real existence ; they are indeed 
nothing more than creations of the mind of man ; they are the expres- 
sion of the resemblances of plants one to another in a series of ab- 
887 
stractions or inductions.
We cannot then say of any of our arrange- 
ments of plants, that they are natural in the sense that they have been 
created by Nature ; but that they are natural in the sense that they 
bring together those plants that have the strongest analogies.
Now this brings me to the second proposition, " that this scheme 
(or plan) of Nature's is the same as one or other of the natural sys- 
tems." Supposing it has been proved above that Nature has followed 
a plan in the creation of plants, and that consequently plants have 
such analogies to each other as to enable us to arrange them in spe- 
cies, genera, orders and classes ; it is evident that that system will 
approach nearest to the plan of Nature, which exhibits the greatest 
number of analogies in its construction, and that brings together in 
its various groups those plants that bear the greatest resemblance to 
each other.
Your correspondent asks whether any one of the natural 
systems corresponds or is identical with the scheme of Nature } He 
will perhaps think himself triumphant when I answer.
No. But his 
triumph will be short when I in return ask him the following ques- 
tions.
Is our knowledge of Nature perfect, and are the general the- 
ories of any one of the natural sciences incapable of change } Does 
not the history of each science (save the Mathematical) show a series 
of changes in its general propositions ?
Has not all Natural Philoso- 
phy undergone great changes, and is it impossible that it should here- 
after undergo still greater changes ?
If then all sciences have been 
and still are liable to change ; why should not our science undergo 
such changes ?
But I shall be glad to be informed what botanists 
have considered any form of the natural system as a settled and per- 
fect system ; and who does not expect changes in system contempo- 
raneous with the increase of our knowledge of the vegetable world .?
A botanist who thinks that all has been done, that the science is per- 
fect, and should undergo no further alterations, I should think a fit 
inmate for a lunatic asylum !
The quotation from Dr. Lindley's 'Key to Botany' is not suffi- 
ciently ample; Mr. Edmonston should have added the next paragraph, 
when it would read thus : â€” " What we call the characters of plants 
are merely the signs by which we judge of affinity, and all the groups 
into which plants are thrown, are in one sense artificial, inasmuch as 
Nature recognizes no such groups.
Nevertheless, consisting in all 
cases of species very closely allied to each other, they are in another 
sense natural." The addition of the last sentence very much alters 
our notion of Dr. Lindley's expression ; for now he implies that Na- 
ture has not indeed created species, orders, genera, or other groujss as 
such ; but has imprinted such characters and affinities on plants, as 
enable us to throw them mto groups approximating more or less to 
the scheme of Nature, and in that sense natural.
Mr. Edmonston's remarks on the process by which botanical know- 
ledge is or may be most easily acquired, are lor the most part good ; 
still I cannot help considering him mistaken on some points.
For 
example, he says that a finished botanist has no need of classifica- 
tion ; and here I differ from him.
I grant that a botanist who knows 
all the British plants, does not need classification for the purpose of 
distinguishing species, since he knows them and their characters; but 
still he needs it to show their analogies and affinities : and I contend 
that were a man capable of comprehending in one view the whole ve- 
getable kingdom, with all the distinctions and analogies of species, 
the natural tendency of his mind would compel him to throw them 
into groups ; and supposing his knowledge perfect, he would con- 
struct a perfectly natural system.
Hence the natural system will 
become more and more perfect by its progressive changes, and ap- 
proximate more and more to a conformity with Nature.
It appears 
to me that Mr. Edmonston, throughout his letter, lays more stress on 
the distinguishing of species from each other, than combining them 
into a coherent whole.
He would consider Botany as an analytic ra- 
ther than a synthetic science, or both combined.
Descending from the high ground we have hitherto occupied, I 
must be permitted to notice a few of the detailed objections put for- 
ward by Mr. Edmonston against the natural system.
He says that 
there has never been a system which was not liable to exceptions, yet 
he expects that the natural system should be liable to 7ione : and 
commencing with the three primary groups â€” Mono- Di- and Acoty- 
ledons, he discovers a few exceptions, and these he may be permitted 
to make the best of.
But what would Mr. Edmonston say, if the 
same species (Nature only creates species) should be found usually 
with two, but occasionally with three or four cotyledons ?
Would he 
separate the individuals and place them in the two primary divisions, 
although in other respects they perfectly resembled each other ?
Yet 
this would be necessary to produce his idea of uniformity.
Such a 
circumstance has been observed in Sinapis ramosa, and is figured in 
Decandolle's ' Organographie,' plate 53.
It is true that Acotyledo- 
nous plants may be found among Dicotyledons ; indeed we should 
not expect two seed-leaves in a plant entirely destitute of leaves, like 
the Cuscuta, although in all other respects it may be and is accordant 
with our idea of Dicotyledonous structure.
But if Mr. Edmonston 
will cast his eye over the following table, he will perceive that the in- 
889 
dividuals of these primary groups are distinguished in all parts of 
their structure.
ROOT.
STEM.
LEAVES.
PRTS.
OF FLOWER.
SEED.
Endoihizous.
Endogenous.
Reticulate.
Ternary.
Monocotyled.
Exorhizous.
Exogenous.
Parallel Veins.
Quaternary or Dicotyledonous.
Quinary.
Heterorhizous.
Acrogenous.
Forked Veins.
Absent.
Acotyledonous.
Here tlie Monocotyledons are Endorhizous, Endogenous, with 
parallel-veined leaves, and a ternary division of the flowers ; while 
the Dicotyledons are Exorhizous, Exogenous, with reticulate-veined 
leaves, and a quaternary or quinary division, of the flower.
Here is a 
set of characters which will clearly distinguish a Monocotyledonous 
from a Dicotyledonous plant, although some one or other of the cha- 
racters may be departed from in a particular instance.
Moreover, 
Mr, Edmonston forgets that the definition of the Dicotyledonous 
group includes those plants that have two or more opposite cotyle- 
dons ; while that of Monocotyledons admits plants with two cotyle-- 
dons, if they are alternate.
Lindley, in his definition of Dicotyledons 
says, " Embryo with two or more opposite cotyledons ; " and in that 
of Endogense or Monocotyledons, " Embryo with but one cotyledon, 
or if with two, then the accessory one impei'fect and alternate with 
the other." After this explanation, the objection to the terms Mono- 
and Dicotyledons becomes a mere verbal quibble.
What is said above will also answer another objection of Mr. Ed- 
monston's, " that the structure of the seed is too much used in the 
definitions of the natural school," and " that the characters of the pri- 
mary divisions ought always, if practicable, to be taken from parts 
easily seen, or at least not requiring such delicate microscopical in- 
vestigation as the natural system requires ; " for if he finds a plant 
whose germination is exorhizous, whose stem is exogenous, whose 
leaves have reticulated veins, and whose floral organs are quaternary 
or quinary, he may be sure that it is a dicotyledon without an exami- 
nation of the seed ; nay, if he only observe that the stem is exoge- 
nous, the leaves reticulated and the parts of the flower quaternary or 
quinary, he will never be mistaken as to the group to which he ought 
to refer it ; and these parts are, I imagine, sufficiently obvious.
But the examination of the structure of the seeds of plants is more- 
over absolutely necessary in any system where the affinities of plants 
are taken into account.
Linnaeus used the parts of the flower as the 
basis of his artificial system, as being the least variable of the parts of 
plants ; and it must be allowed that the structure of the seed is^even 
890 
less variable than that of the other parts of the flower.
I can assure 
Mr. Edmonston from personal experience, that the dissection of seeds 
is by no means so difficult as he considers it ; that a little practice 
will enable him to dissect most seeds; and that, except in very mi- 
nute ones, a common pocket lens will be sufficient for his purpose.
I 
grant that some patience is requisite to do this well.
We now arrive at a very grave charge against the natui'al system 
â€” the indefiniteness of its groups ; and Mr. Edmonston has chosen 
Ranunculaceae as the subject of his animadversions, finding no cha- 
racter so definite as the one stamen of Linnaeus's Monandria.
Now 
it is curious that the very indefinite characters of Ranunculaceae may 
be included in a definition to which scarcely any (certainly not more 
than in the Linnsean classes) exceptions can be found.
T give this 
definition from Lindley's ' Introduction to the Natural System,' p.
6. 
"Polypetalous dicotyledons with hypogynous stamens, anthers bursting 
by long slits, several distinct simple carpella, exstipulate leaves sheath- 
ing at the base, solid albumen and seeds without arillus." Lindley 
gives the following exceptions or anomalies.
" In Garidella and Ni- 
gella the carpella cohere more or less.
In Thalictrum, some species of 
Clematis and some other genera, there are no petals.
Paeonia has a 
pei'sistent calyx." Now does it not strike Mr. Edmonston as exceed- 
ingly improper that plants possessing a corolla should be placed in 
the same Linnaean genus with those in which it is totally wanting !
! 
We must surely complain of the genus before we find fault with the 
order.
I would suggest the revision of the genus to Mr. Edmonston.
In Garidella and Nigella it is true that the carpels are more or less 
coherent.
I do not happen to have access to detailed descriptions of 
any species of these genera ; but, if I am not mistaken, the degree of 
cohesion of the carpels varies very greatly in different species, so that 
in some they are almost distinct.
In Acteea I find that the carpella 
are reduced to one, and that one has taken a baccate form, exactly as 
some Leguminosse are drupaceous.
Mr. Edmonston has unfortunately fallen into the error of taking the 
detailed descriptions of the natural orders for their distinctive charac- 
ter; and he has found in the former that degree of indefiniteness which 
might be expected in giving a detailed account of the structure of a 
large group of plants.
Mr. Edmonston, in criticising some expres- 
sions of Dr. Lindley, with reference to the two great systems, says, â€” 
" Now if it be the case that the student must go through the same 
process â€” examine the same parts â€” in the one as in the other system, 
it will be singular if the amount of knowledge is not equal.
In fact 
891 
the examination necessary for the knowing the genus and species of 
a plant, after you have got at its class and order by the Linnoean sys- 
tem, gives as great an .amount of information concerning the plant 
itself, as if this end were attained by the natural system, with this dif- 
ference, that the information is far more easily acquired and the pro- 
cess not nearly so complicated." 
Here I submit that Mr. Edmonston labours under a very grave 
error, from his want of appreciation of the objects of the natural sys- 
tem.
It is true that the studeut may gain an equal knowledge of the 
plant itself as by the natural system ; but when he has obtained that 
knowledge, what has he discovered of the relations of the plant to 
other plants, farther than the generic group.
When he rises above 
that group, and comes to the ordei'S and classes, what does he find 
but "combinations of disjointed things" â€” genera associated that dis- 
agree in every particular, excepting that they have the same number 
or arrangement of stamina and pistils, and even then, there are nume- 
rous exceptions to these numbers and arrangements !
! If we consider 
plants in their affinities or properties, we shall find that the Linnaean 
groups are, for the most part, forced and unnatural, while the reverse 
is usually the case with the natural orders.
In saying this, I do not 
mean to deny that there are numerous exceptions to the natural sys- 
tem, but as that system can never be perfect until the whole vegetable 
kingdom is known, these exceptions must still exist while man is less 
than omniscient !
I will conclude with, T fear, a rather long extract from Swainson's 
admirable treatise ' On the Geography and Classification of Animals,' 
which sets forth, in better language and more forcible manner than I 
am able to em])loy, the differences and uses of the two systems ; at 
the same time remarking that Linnaeus himself could not rest content- 
ed with his own admirable artificial scheme, but sketched out a plan 
for a natural one !
" What, then, is the difference between an artificial and a natural system ?
The 
first is for the ready discrimination of species; the latter for the elucidation of those 
resemblances which such species bear to others in all their varied and comjilex rela- 
tions.
The one stops where the other begins.
We mate use of an artificial system to 
become acquainted with the name of a species ; and to learn all that has been written 
on its peculiar structure.
We turn to the natural system, to know the probable station 
of this species in the scale of being, the affinities it possesses to others, and the ana- 
logies by which it is related and represented.
Hence the perfection, as we have fre- 
quently intimated, consists in the clearness and precision of its subdivisions, and the 
facilities which it affords to determine the name of the object we are in scarcli of.
In 
this respect a good artificial system is to be judged by the same rules as those by which 
892 
we should decide on the merits of a copious index to a voluminous publication, for the pur= 
poses of both are the same : both are equally useful, and the merit of both lies in clearly 
directing the reader to the precise point on which he desires information.
A good artifi- 
cial system is, therefore, not only a useful, but even, in some respects, a valuable inven- 
tion, requiring much more skill than is generally supposed ; and it is, perhaps, much 
more adapted for general use than any other.
The most admirable classification of this 
sort ever invented, is that denominated the sexual system of plants, by Linnaeus.
Many 
natural assemblages are preserved without any great violation of the principles on which 
he set out.
This is always a great recommendation to an artificial system, yet it is by no 
means necessary to its formation.
Natural affinities may be overlooked wherever they 
interfere with precision of arrangement, the first are secondary, the latter primary.
We 
open an artificial system to come to the knowledge of a matter of fact ; but if we wish 
to proceed farther, and to know how this fact bears upon other facts, we turn to the na- 
tural system.
Such are the uses of the two methods of classification upon which we 
have been speaking, and such the theoretic distinctions by which they are separated.
Between them, however, is a third sort of system, which, from combining artificial di- 
vision with some regard to natural affinities, are generally termed mixed systems, or 
half-artificial methods, while others (and generally among this number are the authors 
themselves), have pronounced them natural arrangements."

â€” An Account of a Visit to Teesdale in the Summer of IS4S.
By James Backhouse and James Backhouse, jun.* 
As an account of a visit made last summer by my father and myself 
to Teesdale and some adjacent parts, may interest the readers of 'The 
Phytologist,' I send thee some account of it.
We set out on the 28th of 8th month, and proceeded by railway to 
Darlington ; from thence we went to Bishop Auckland, where we left 
the railway, and walked to Shull between Hamsterly and Wolsingham.
There we found Hieracium boreale, Scutellaria minor, Listera cordata, 
Vaccinium Vitis-Idsea, Pyrola media and minor, Lastrsea Oreopteris, 
Polypodium Phegopteris and Dryopteris, and Equisetum sylvaticura.
In the native birch-woods at this place, the broad and narrow leaved 
varieties of Convallaria majalis occur; and a robust, upright and very 
hairy variety of Veronica scutellata ?
is found in ponds.
Dianthus 
Armeria occasionally springs up here, where the ling has been fresh 
burned off.
The day following we walked over the moors, by com-

pass, to the High-force inn, Teesdale, a distance of about seventeen 
miles.
We met with Vaccinium Oxycoccos and Empetrum nigrum, 
especially the latter, in many places.
In a swampy place facing the 
south, about two miles from Shull, we found Malaxis paludosa in full 
flower.
Probably the reason of many persons not findhig this plant, 
when searching for it in known localities, is, that they seek it too early 
in the year.
We also met with Rubus chamsemorus in several places.
When we got within sight of the High-force inn, we descended into the 
valley of the Tees, near Winch-bridge, where we found Hieracium rigi- 
dum, diaphanum, umbellatura.?
boreale and Lapeyrousii, Crepissucci- 
Sffifolia, Galium boreale, Thlaspi alpestre, Pyrus Aria, Melampyrura 
sylvaticum, TrolHus europasus and Equisetum variegatum.
We visited 
also the High-force waterfall that evening, near which we found the 
recently described Poa Parnellii, and saw abundance of Potentilla 
firuticosa, several Hieraciums and Cnicus heterophyllus.
During most 
of the day grouse and curlews were to be seen on the moors.
After a comfortable night's rest at the High-force inn, where there 
is good accommodation, we set out in the direction of Micklefell : wc 
crossed the low end of Widdy-bank, which is the locality of Carex 
capillaris, Eriophorum pubescens, Bartsia alpina, Tofieldia palustris.
Polygonum viviparum, Gentiana veraa, Gyranadenia albida, Saxifraga 
aizoides &c., all of which we had found the year previous.
We then 
ascended the face of Cronckley-fell, where were Allosorus crispus, 
Epilobium angustifolium, Arbutus Uva-ursi, Hieracium Lapeyrousii, 
pulmonarium &c.
Leaving the locality of Dryas octopetala and Jun- 
cus triglumis on our right, we crossed the top of the fell, where we 
found Draba incana, Saxifraga hypnoides, Helianthemum canum, 
Hippocrepis comosa, Lycopodium alpinum and Selago and Gentiana 
verna, the latter in great profusion.
Here we saw a large flock of 
grouse â€” fi'om thirty to forty.
We next ascended Mickle-fell, which 
is the highest mountain in Yorkshire, being 2,600 feet above the level 
of the sea.
Saxifraga stellaris, Sedum villosum and Cochlearia grcen- 
landica were growing in the streamlets which descend from it.
The 
top of Mickle-fell is limestone covered with grass, thickly interspersed 
with Gentiana verna.
In the margins of the springs which emerge 
from under this limestone, Epilobium alsinifolium grows in abun- 
dance.
Descending the west side of this mountain, we crossed Maize- 
beck and the Tees, below Cauldron-snout; near the junction of these 
rivers is a spring, filled with Saxifraga stellaris.
We found three 
small plants of Woodsia Ilvensis on Falcon-clints.
A large bird of 
prey was sailing round the tops of these crags, which we thought was 
894 
an eagle, but it did not come near enough to enable us to determine 
this with certainty.
We then ascended the rocks by Cauldron-snout, 
and returned to our quarters across the back of Widdy-bank-fell, 
where, in a stream fi'om under the limestone, we found Juncus triglu- 
mis, Tofieldia palustris and Kobresia caricina.
The sides of this 
stream were adorned with Bartsia alpina.
Primula farinosa and Saxi- 
fraga aizoides, down to its junction with the Tees.
Festuca vivipara, 
Sesleria caerulea, Thalictrum alpinum, Gnaphalium dioicum, and se- 
veral other interesting plants, also grow near Cauldron-snout.
The 
year previous we found several large tufts of Polystichum Lonchitis 
on Falcon-clints.
Cystopteris fragilis and dentata, Asplenium viride 
and Trichomanes, grow there abundantly, together with a profusion 
of seedling ferns, some of which, at first sight, might be taken for 
Woodsia Ilvensis.
There we have also met with a deeply incised 
variety of Asplenium Trichomanes, but we never saw anything of As- 
plenium fontanum.
The next day, accompanied by our friend Jacob Allison of Cother- 
stone, we again crossed the back of Widdy-bank-fell, passed the head 
of the Weel, and crossed Crook-bourn into Cumberland ; we then 
crossed the Tees into Westmoreland, and traversed the moors in the 
direction of Dun-fell.
When in a straight line between the Green- 
burn lead-mine shaft and Dun-fell hush, we came upon the new loca- 
lity of Saxifraga Hirculus (Phytol.
741), which was plentiful, but 
sparingly in flower.
In a limestone hollow near this place, Asplenium 
viride was growing in profusion in the crevices of the rock, and at the 
bottom, among nettles, we found some large plants of Polemonium 
cgeruleum in flower ; this was new to the Teesdale district.
From 
this place we crossed over the back of Meldon-fell to Highcup-scar,* 
an enormous ravine, about a mile and a half long, and 1000 to 1500 
feet deep, margined by basaltic cliffs, surmounted on each side by 
limestone, topped with sandstone crags.
After having walked about 
twenty miles, mostly over bleak barren moors, without a tree and with 
scarcely a trace of cultivation, the contrast of the scene at this place 
was very striking, as this great gulf opened to our view the rich fer- 
tile vales of the cultivated part of Westmoreland.
Sedum Rhodiola 
and Thlaspi alpestre were growing in abundance in the clefts of the 
basalt, and in a deep gorge we had the pleasure of finding several 
very fine specimens of Saxifraga nivalis, which I believe had not pre- 
viously been found in England.
We then returned towards the High- 
* Highcup-scav is generally named Eagle's chair in maps.
895 
force inn, passing Maize-beck scars, where Potentilla Salisburgensis 
was abundant, and reached our quarters some time after dark, having 
extended our walk to about thirty miles.
The day following, taking Winch-bridge in our way, where we 
found Potentilla Salisburgensis (alpestris) and other plants, we as- 
cended Hoi wick-scars, and crossed over the moors to the old locality 
of Saxifraga Hirculus (which we found in abundance) near the junc- 
tion of the river Baulder and the Black-beck.
We stopped at Co- 
therstone that night and the next day, and the day following rode by 
way of Bowes and Brough to Appleby.
Near Brough we ascended 
Hellbeck-scars, which are limestone, where I found Pupa Juniperi (a 
land shell) in great abundance.
This is the only locality with which 
I am acquainted in the north of England.
Here we also found Epi- 
pactis ovalis, Draba incana, and a large-leaved variety of Hieracium 
murorum.
The following morning, passing Dufton-pike, a curious 
conical mountain near the village of Dufton, we again examined 
Highcup-scar, but did not find anything fresh worthy of notice, except 
Saxifraga nivalis in another basaltic gorge.
The day being clear we had a.
beautiful view of the Cumberland 
mountains, and in the distance those of Dumfriesshire.
That even- 
ing we returned to Brough on our way home.

â€” Notes on Carex teretiuscula, C.
paradoxa, C.
panicu- 
lata, and Mr. Gibson's C.
pseudo-paradoxa.
By George 
LUXFORD, A.L.S., &c.
Since the publication of my brief note on these plants in the De- 
cember number (Phytol.
811), so many opposite opinions have been 
expressed with regard to the one whose specific identity and relations 
are more particularly the objects in dispute, and these opinions have 
emanated from botanists of such high authority, that I must confess 
I feel considerable reluctance to publish any further observations on 
the subject; and it is only in redemption of an express promise, and 
the belief that no harm can possibly arise fi'om a continuance of the 
discussion, that I now venture to print the following remarks.
Before I begin, however, I may perhaps be allowed to give a short 
history of my acquaintance with the plant from the neighbourhood of 
Manchester, which has given rise to the enquiry ; and this I am the 
896 
more anxious to do, since the opinions which I then gave were has- 
tily conceived, as hastily expressed, and drawn from the examination 
of an insufficient number of specimens.
I think it right to mention 
this, because there is a possibility that in more than one instance the 
opinions at that time privately given, may be found to be at variance 
with those subsequently formed.
Last summer I received from Mr. Sidebotham, of Manchester, 
specimens of some Carices on which he requested I would give him 
my opinion.
At that time I happened to be much engaged, and was 
consequently unable to bestow on the specimens the attention which 
the subject required.
Among them were examples of the disputed 
Carex from " Seam on's moss-pits ;"* and these I could refer to no 
other species than Carex teretiuscula,t believing it to be that plant 
with its habit somewhat changed by local or other circumstances, in 
consequence of which the inflorescence had assumed a more elongate 
form than usual.
Believing this, I was somewhat surprised to learn 
from Mr. Sidebotham, that some of his botanical friends, as well as 
himself, considered the plant to be the C.
paradoxa ( Willd.), which 
had then been recently introduced to the notice of botanists in Mr.
Babington's Manual, as an established British species, found in Ire- 
land.
After strenuously endeavouring to discover a correspondence 
between the Manchester specimens and the description of C.
para- 
doxa as given in the Manual, I began to think that the difficulty lay 
with myself solely, and that none was presented to others possessing 
better information on the subject.
This led me, though reluctantly, 
to acquiesce in the opinion that it might be Carex paradoxa.
Soon 
after this I was still more surprised to learn fi'om Mr. Gibson, that 
the plant from Manchester was identical with the one to which he al- 
ludes as having " its fruit agreeing with Leighton's figure of the fruit 
of C.
paniculata" (Phytol.
366), since I was not then aware that Mr.
Gibson restricted the use of the iexra fruit to the mU only, and I had 
always applied the term to the perigynium and its included nut.
â– * I believe tliat this locality has not previously been given in ' The Phytologist,' 
by any of the botanists who have written on the subject.
I now mention it without 
hesitation, since, from the circumstance of the locality being expressly stated on the 
labels accompanying all the specimens of the plant that have come under my notice, 
it appears to me that there has been no attempt to make anything like a secret of the 
matter.
f Certainly not to C "paniculata, as by an extract from one of my letters to Mr.
Sidebotham, it appears I once wrote.
That this was merely a lapsus calami is evident, 
I think, from the context.
I cannot plead guilty to having ever considered this plant 
a variety of C.
paniculata.
â– 897 
At a subsequent period I was much gratified by receiving, in a packet 
of plants which Mr. Sidebotham had the kindness to send me, some 
additional specimen of Carex tereliuscula, and of the plant which 
even then had led to considerable discussion.
The receipt of these 
specimens, which were in fine condition, again brought the subject 
under my consideration ; and a renewed examination alniost confirm- 
ed my first opinion, that it could be no other than a slight variety of 
Carex teretiuscula.
Then came Mr. Gibson's note on this plant un- 
der the name of C.
pseudo-paradoxa, (Phytol.
778).
In that note 
Mr. G.
has mentioned the relationship of the plant with C.
paradoxa 
{ Willd.), and at the same time correctly pointed out its distinctness 
from that species.
This, it will be remembered, was followed by Dr.
Wood's note (Phytol.
809), wherein are minutely described the pecu- 
liar circumstances attending the growth of the plant, and which cir- 
cumstances, in Dr. Wood's opinion, are sufficient to account for the 
various discrepancies between this plant and C.
teretiuscula, which 
he considers the normal form.
The veiy beautiful specimens of the 
two plants obligingly forwarded by Dr. Wood, together with others, 
equally beautiful, of C.
paniculata, in addition to specimens of all 
the three previously in my possession, formed a valuable store of 
materials, both for examination and comparison.
The note appended 
to Dr. Wood's communication (Phytol.
811) contained the result of 
a careful examination of the materials then at my command; and I 
regret that I have since been prevented from recurring to the subject.
Want of space even now compels me to defer the conclusion of my 
notes to another number; when the remarks I may have to make on 
these Carices, will be illustrated by figures, which have been most 
obligingly placed at my disposal by Mr. Wilson.
T may in this place, 
however, be allowed to state, that my opinion as to the specific iden- 
tity of C.
teretiuscula and Mr. Gibson's C.
pseudo-paradoxa remains 
unshaken, nay, it is rather strengthened than otherwise by recent 
investigations.
Before T conclude I would express my thanks to Mr. R.
Spruce of 
York, for beautiful specimens of Carex paradoxa, from Heslington 
fields, near that city ; and to Mr. Wilson and the Botanical Society 
of London, for the loan of others collected at Westmeath, Ireland, by 
Mr. D.
Moore.

â€” Two Botanical Visits to the Reeky Linn and Den of 
Airley, in April and June, 1842.* By William Gardiner, 
JUN.
Esq.
My first visit to the Reeky Linn was on the 13th of April.
I left 
Dundee with the earliest railway train for Newtyle, and from thence 
walked the remainder of the way, crossing the hills behind Alyth, and 
coming down upon the Isla at the bridge of Craig.
The only plant 
of interest noticed in my route was Bryum albicans, which grew abun- 
dantly on a wet bank between Newtyle and Meigle.
In the same 
locality I found it again plentifully in May, with ripe capsules, and 
associated with Dicranum varium.
I took up my abode in Mrs. Ro- 
bertson's "public," which is conveniently situated within a quarter 
of a mile of the Linn, and after dinner went out to botanize.
The 
Reeky Linn is a beautiful and picturesque waterfall on the Isla, at the 
head of the Den of Airly, and about four miles above the castle.
The 
water takes three distinct leaps, and throughout its progress foams 
like a boiling cauldron, and meeting at the base of the rocks with a 
jutting cliff which obstructs its fury, a quantity of it is dissipated in 
vapour, which, rising in the air, seems like a mist or smoke {Scottice 
" reek "), hence the name that has been bestowed upon the fall.
The 
vicinity of such a place, from abounding in moist rocks, is always rich 
in vegetation, and here, though too early for most flowers, I reaped a 
luxuriant cryptogamic harvest.
Sticta sylvatica covered the rocks in 
many places, and large patches of the elegant Jungermannia pubes- 
cens were intermingled with J.
platyphylla and var.
0. major, Hypnum 
myosuroides, commutatum and praelongum, Anomodon viticulosum 
and curtipendulum, Bartramia Halleriana and pomiformis, var.
/3.
ma- 
jor, and the lovely Neckera crispa.
Here and there tufts of Didy- 
modon Bruntoni showed themselves profusely in fructification, and, 
peeping from among them, the delicate calyptrse and bright tawny 
capsules of Encalypta ciliata, and the graceful little Hypnum pulchel- 
lum.
The beautiful Hymenophyllum Wilsoni was here, as elsewhere, 
associated with Jungermannia spinulosa.
On the banks, chiefly grow- 
ing on sandy deposits, were Bryum punctatum, rostratum, margina- 
tum, turbinatum, ventricosum and hornum, Hypnum palustre and 
uncinatum, Tiichostomura aciculare, Dicranum flavescens and adian- 
toides, Orthotrichum rupincola and Didymodon rigidulus.
Still closer 
to the water, in shady nooks, dwelt Marchantia (Fegatella) conica and

899 
hemisphaericaand Jungermannia epiphylla; and, bathing in its liquid 
freshness, floated the dark branches of CincHdotus fontinaloides, and 
Grimmia rivularis, [Brid.).
Tufts of the elegant Didymodon capilla- 
ceus looked out here and there from the crevices of the rocks, with, 
more sparingly, Bryum androgynum and Hedwigia aestiva.
Some of 
the rocks were encrusted with Lecanora tartarea ; Squamaria hypno- 
rum appeared in several places, and various CollemaB, particularly C.
nigrescens and lacerum, attached themselves to the exuberant mosses.
The trees were adorned with a profusion of Orthotrichum crispum, 
Jungerraannia complanata and dilatata, Ramalina fastigiata and frax- 
inea.
On the moist rocky banks that margined the stream, various 
Juugermanniae were abundant, and I culled, among others, J.
Lyoni, 
furcata, excisa, multifida, albicans, nemorosa, undulata, and, more in- 
teresting than all, J.
Blasia in fructification , a rarity amply rewarding 
my day's exertions.
I next morning breakfasted early, and hastened again to the Linn.
Crossing the Isla by the bridge of Craig T went down the north side 
of the stream, and viewed the waterfall from a variety of points, from 
all of which the eye feasted on pictures of varied grandeur.
The sha- 
dows of night had departed, and all was now distinct.
The sunlight 
sparkled on the foamy Linn, and seemed to penetrate the deep pool 
beneath, while the wild cavern on the southern side opened its dark 
jaws, and displayed a confused mass of the wrecks of fence and wood- 
land which it had gorged in flood and storm.
In the upper air now 
floated the lark's sweet melody, and the thrush, from the yet almost 
leafless trees poured its matin song.
Wood anemonies and primroses 
were profusely scattered over the rocky and wooded banks ; and the 
thickly springing verdure on every side gave promise of a summer 
luxuriance of vegetation.
And as I thus revelled in the beauty and 
magnificence around me, and thought of the bright and sunny future, 
I felt with the poet, that â€” 
" From Nature and her changes flow 
An everlasting tide of joy." 
My walk down the den of Airly, from there being no regular foot- 
path, was rather fatiguing, but the rich succession of wild and rugged 
scenery, varying at every step, proved a more than sufficient equiva- 
lent.
And I also added to my former stores, Anomodon viticulosum 
in fructification, Hypnum curvatum, triquetrum and velutinura, Ver- 
rucaria gemmata and Adoxa moschatellina.
The vicinity of the cas- 
tle was reached by noon, and at the base of the rock on which it stands 
Hypnum atro-virens was picked, and a specimen or two of Equisetura 
900 
Mackaii ?
close to the water ; but E.
hyemale, which grows here abun- 
dantly, was all cropped.
Further down the Den, among overhanghig 
rocks, Bryum androgynum was plentiful with little heads of gemmae, 
and Tetraphis pellucida bearing gemmiferous cups, and at its foot, on 
a marshy bank, Chrysosplenium alternifolium displayed its curious 
flowers.
Well loaded, I for this time bade adieu to Airly, and after a 
long smart walk reached Newtyle in good time for the last train.
My second visit to the Linn was on June 24th, when summer was 
glowing in all her loveliness.
I followed the same route as formerly, 
and in shallow pools on the " market-moor " of Alyth collected fine 
specimens of Pilularia globulifera.
The hedge-rows between Meigle 
and Alyth were bright with wild roses that perfumed the air, and abun- 
dance of Galium cruciatum shot up through their verdure: and upon 
the hills beyond Alyth, Gymnadenia conopsea and Polygonum vivi- 
parum were in luxuriance.
The " public " was reached in time for 
tea, and I botanized about the Linn till nearly 10 o'clock.
The same 
roar of rushing waters greeted my ear as before ; but instead of the 
leafless trees, I now walked under a green umbrageous canopy, through 
which swelled at intervals the deep-toned music of the ebon bird of 
evening.
My spring hope was now realized, for every crack and cre- 
vice of the rocks, every nook and crannie, bank and brae, was loaded 
with herbage and flowers.
Galium boreale was abundant, and Meum 
Athamanticum I never gathered in finer condition.
Solidago Virgau- 
rea, Crepis paludosa and Hieracium murorum var.
y. Lawsoni^ reared 
their golden blossoms from many a fissure in the clifi"s, and the sil- 
very foliage of Alchemilla alpina adorned the rocks.
Geranium pra- 
tense was plentiful, and with Carduus heterophyllus, and the glowing 
flowers of Lychnis diurna, gave a flush of beauty and brightness to 
many a spot.
Valeriana sylvestris, Stellaria holostea, and a host of 
other common though beautiful things, crowded on the attention from 
every side.
The cryptogamic tribes were almost smothered by the 
proud ambition of the higher orders of vegetation, but I still was ena- 
bled to add several to my former list, among which the more interest- 
ing were Peltidea venosa, Nephroma resupinata and Trichostomum 
polyphyllum.
On the succeeding morning I gathered on the northern banks a 
profusion of Orobus sylvaticus and Melampyrum sylvaticum, and fur- 
ther down the Den, Melica nutans and uniflora, Carduus heterophyllus 
&c.
But the stormy threatenings of the morning were soon followed 
by a heavy rain, which continued almost without intermission during 
the remainder of the day, and a thorough drenching to the skin tend- 
901 
ed in some degree to cool down my botanical enthusiasm.
I search- 
ed about, as well as I could under the circumstances, for Orobus 
niger, but without success, and in vain looked for the "wet rocks above 
the castle," where the Timmia grows.
In fact, by the time the foot 
of the Den was reached, I was as wet as if I had come down the Reeky 
Linn and swam the Isla all the way.
But my vasculum had been 
well filled, and moreover I had the consolation of having chivalrously 
suffered in a noble cause, â€” even in the cause of the bright and beau- 
tiful Lady Flora.

Method of arranging the Cryptogamia in a Herbarium.
Many excellent methods of collecting and arranging herbaria have 
appeared in the pages of ' The Phytologist,' but as these all relate to 
the Phaenogamous plants, I trust the following hints respecting the 
Cryptogamic tribes â€” Musci, Hepaticas and Lichenes, may prove in- 
teresting to some of your readers.
The more general mode of forming 
and arranging herbaria for mosses &c.
seems to be that of glueing the 
specimens to the paper, taking care that this shall be of a sufficient 
transparency and whiteness, that the plant may be examined on hold- 
ing it up to the light.
Now this method is attended with much in- 
convenience ; the different parts of these tribes are extremely minute, 
and require very careful investigation, the previous application of wa- 
ter is also absolutely necessary to most or all species.
Can this be 
done to a specimen fastened on the paper, without detriment to its 
texture ; and supposing water to be applied, may not the microscope 
disclose perhaps the most essential parts buried in a mass of glue ?
The remedy is very simple.
Take half a sheet of stout foolscaj), and 
divide this into quarters, which will be suited for the larger mosses.
Again, these quarters halved will form another very convenient size.
The half sheets divided into thirds, and these halved, will constitute a 
most useful size for the genera Hypnum, Bryum, &c.
Other forms 
may be made according to the taste and wants of the collector.
Now 
fold each of these divisions lengthways, so that the under side shall 
appear three-eighths of an inch beyond the upper : turn this border 
upon the upper edge, and do likewise with the two ends of the folded 
paper, you will then have a case somewhat similar to those in which 
a nurseryman encloses seeds for sale.
These cases are to be glued to 
902 
paper formed by quartering half a sheet of foolscap, and on each 
quarter can be laid three or more of the cases (except those of the 
largest size, two of which will fill the paper).
The species may now 
be distributed according to their respective sizes, and one paper will 
be allotted to each species, thus leaving a reserve for varieties, and 
specimens from different localities.
The names will be written on 
each of the cases, and the whole formed into fasciculi, with the gene- 
ric names outside ; two or more fasciculi may be allowed for the more 
numerous genera.
A herbarium formed according to this method is 
always neat, and easily referred to ; the specimens may be taken out 
of the packets, examined and replaced without incurring any risk of 
injury.
Extra papers can always be added when required.
Very lit- 
tle trouble is necessary for drying mosses, Hepaticae, &c.
Specimens 
should generally be moistened previous to the application of pressure.
Old books will be found a convenient substitute for loose paper: the 
specimens should be placed between the leaves and left untouched 
till thoroughly dry, nor need they be removed except when required.
As directions are always much more easily written than understood, 
and fearing this might be applicable to the above, I gave them to a 
lady, requesting that she would put them in practice ; and in a very 
short time, to my great satisfaction, I beheld many papers arranged 
exactly, though perhaps with greater neatness, like those in my own 
herbarium.

Notice of a Carduus found near Saffron Walden, Essecc.
The following is a brief description of a curious variety of Carduus 
(arvensis?) found in the autumn of 1843, about four miles from Saffron 
Walden ; it was growing by the road-side, on a poor clay soil, in the 
neighbourhood of a wood.
Only two plants of it were in flower, one 
of which was spreading and much branched, the other small, but pre- 
senting similar characteristics.
Near them C.
arvensis, acaulis and 
lanceolatus were growing abundantly.
Root creeping : stems much 
branched, about two feet high, leafy and woolly : leaves nearly simi- 
lar to those of C.
arvensis : flowers numerous, on separate stalks, as 
large as those of C.
acaulis, and very similar in colour ; calyx-scales 
mostly green ; pappus rather short.
In general habit it agrees most 
nearly with C.
arvensis, but differs in its spreading, woolly stem, in 
its flowers being thrice the size, and of a crimson colour; in the 
calyx-scales being less coloured, and in the shortness of the pappus.
From C.
acaulis it differs in its size, bushy character, and in its leaves; 
also in its numerous flowers ; but agrees in the colour and size of its 
903 
flowers and its woolly stem.
Specimens of it have been shown to se- 
veral eminent botanists, who have expressed very different sentiments 
respecting it, but most of them have considered it an interesting plant, 
and a form which they had never before seen.
One is of opinion that 
it is an instance of Carduus arvensis being dioecious, this plant hav- 
ing the stamens more largely developed, which might account for the 
difference in the length of the pappus.
Another considers that it has 
nothing to do with C.
arvensis, but is C.
acaulis, B.
duhius of Willde- 
now's ' Species Plantarum,' and C.
caulescens of Persoon.
A third 
would give it the name of acaulis, had not the stems been of such a 
height, although he thinks the leaves more like arvensis.
A fourth is 
ready to suppose, that it must be a hybrid between C.
acaulis and ar- 
vensis, the flowers and hairiness of the stem bringing it exactly to the 
former, and the leaves and size agreeing mth the latter.
Several 
others have expressed opinions similar to one or other of those given 
above: and when such a difference exists among the most competent 
judges, I feel unwilling to hazard a sentiment, but the first explana- 
tion does not appear by any means to account for the whole of the 
very striking differences between this plant and C.
arvensis ; with the 
second 1 do not feel able to unite, because although C.
acaulis has 
been frequently found caulescent in this neighbourhood, and I have a 
specimen of it gathered last autumn, with a stem thirteen inches in 
height, yet it always preserves, as far as T have seen, its general dis- 
tinctive characters, and presents a very different appearance to the 
plant under consideration.
I fear that there are not sufficient dis- 
tinctive peculiarities to constitute it a separate species, and therefore 
the only other alternative seems to be to consider it a hybrid between 
C. arvensis and acaulis, which, though an uncommon occurrence in 
nature, is by no means an impossible one.
Perhaps some of your 
correspondents may have seen a similar plant, and be able to decide 
the question, or some clearer light may be obtained after closer ob- 
servation of it next season.

On the dispersion of the Seeds of Oxalis Acetosella.
I think 
it is not generally known that Oxalis Acetosella has the power of 
projecting its ripe seeds to a considerable distance from the plant.
Many of our native plants possess a similar power, such as Impatiens, 
Cardamine, Ervum, Ulex, and other Leguminosse : in all these the 
expulsion of the seeds is effected by the rapid opening and curling up 
of the valves of the capsule ; in the Leguminosae the two valves be- 
come spirally twisted, in Cardamine they form a flat coil.
In Oxalis, 
904 
however, the seeds are ejected, not by any movement of the outer 
valves of the capsule, but by a curious mternal bag in which each seed 
is enveloped.
The capsule consists of five cells, each containing one 
seed, and having an opening at the side.
Each seed is enclosed in a 
closely fitting semitransparent skin; w^henripe this little skin acquires 
the projecting power, having a strong inclination to turn inside out- 
wards, which, continually increasing, ultimately causes a small fissure 
at the top, and immediately this is effected, the bag rapidly inverts it- 
self, and the seed is thrown out with a crack through the opening 
provided for it ; and sometimes the bag itself is thrown out by the 
violence of the movement, but generally it remains in the mouth of 
the cell.

Note on Veronica triphyllos.
While examining lately one or 
two very fine specimens of Veronica triphyllos, from the neighbour- 
hood of York, with which I was favoured by my friend Sylvanus 
Thompson, Esq., I was struck with the great discrepancy between 
Hooker's description and these specimens.
Hooker arranges this 
plant in the last section of the genus, having the " flowers axillary â€” 
solitary," whereas my specimens have the flowers in terminal racemes^ 
exactly as in V.
alpina, serpyllifolia, and others of the first division 
of the genus.
Hooker indeed says of V.
triphyllos, â€” " flowers sub- 
racemose," so that its being placed in a section having axillary soli- 
tary flowers, may arise from inadvertence.
I may remark that the 
only other specimen of V.
triphyllos in my collection, and which I 
owe to the kindness of Sir W.
Hooker himself, shows exactly the 
same mode of inflorescence as in the Yorkshire specimens above al- 
luded to.
I quote the third edition of the ' British Flora,' perhaps 
the error may be corrected in a subsequent edition, to which at pre- 
sent I have no access.

Villarsia nymphceoides.
As I am not acquainted with any 
recorded Scotch habitats of this beautiful plant, it may perhaps inte- 
rest your readers to know that I gathered it in August, 1840, in a 
large mill-pond near Glasgow, where it was first observed by Mr. W.
R. Murray of Edinburgh.
The plant grows in great abundance in 
this station, intermixed with Potamogeton, Myriophyllum, and other 
aquatic plants.
I regret I cannot give a more explicit description of 
this station, from my ignorance of the localities round Glasgow, and 
it was so dark when we gathered the plant, that we both took only a 
specimen a-piece as Nuphar lutea ; and thus we did not pay that at- 
tention to the station that we should otherwise have done.
The plant 
905 
has ev'ery appearance of being as indigenous as any of the plants 
among which it grows.
I ratlier think the pond in which it grows 
was to the westward of the town ; it was large and deep, and the Vil- 
larsia could only be reached in a boat.

Carex hoemiinghausiana.
I inclose you a specimen of the 
Crichton-castle Carex alluded to in my List of additional Edinburgh 
Plants (Phytol.
407), and 1 think you will agree with me in consider- 
ing it C.
remota.
Since reading the remarks by Mr. Luxford (Id.
650) and Mr. Gibson (Id. 779), I have carefully examined my nu- 
merous specimens from Crichton-castle, gathered at different times, 
and feel quite convinced of the correctness of my former opinion, 
that all I had met with in that station were C.
remota, and none agree- 
ing with the description of C.
boenninghausiana : some of the Edin- 
burgh botanists were indeed of opinion that my specimens were really 
C. axillaris, and I was inclined to think the same, or rather, that C.
remota and C.
axillaris were undistinguishable ; for I could perceive 
little difference between the Crichton-castle plants and what I con- 
ceived to be authentic specimens of C.
axillaris in my herbarium.
Shortly afterwards, however, I became acquainted with the true C.
axillaris, specimens of which I owe to the kindness of my valued cor- 
respondent.
Dr. Wood, when I at once perceived that they were dif- 
ferent both from the Crichton-castle and all other specimens called 
C. axillaris in my collection; and consequently, specimens from eight 
stations had, to my great disappointment, to be handed over to the C.
remota sheet.
Thus Dr. Wood's specimens stand in my herbarium 
as the sole representatives of C.
axillaris, and to these I trusted in 
comparing my Edinburgh specimens, and in referring them to C.
re- 
mota.
I only know C.
boenninghausiana by Mr. Luxford's and Mr.
Gibson's notices, as no work I have access to at present contains a 
description of it.
I would therefore be much obliged if you would 
examine the specimens now sent, and report.
I make these remarks 
as I think C.
boenninghausiana must be very rare in the Crichton- 
castle station, for I very carefully examined all the Carices I could 
find near the place in hunting after C.
axillaris, but never found any- 
thing nearer it than the plant now sent.

Note on Cetraria sepincola.
A few days ago I found some 
specimens of Cetraria sepincola near the west side of the island (Unst).
I had not previously seen it in Shetland, and indeed it is not, I be- 
lieve, a common plant anywhere in Britain.
The specimens were 
rather small and without apothecia : they were accompanied by Ra- 
4h 
906 
malina scopulovum and favinacea and other lichens.
Hooker, in his 
British Flora, says that he has never found Cetraria sepincola but on 
wood, but these specimens were found on a block of mica-slate.

Remarks on Dr. Ayres' opinion of the Vaucheria.
Allow me 
a few words on the Yaucherise.
Your correspondent Dr. Ayres (Phy- 
tol.
743) seems to wish to annihilate the genus, principally, it would 
appear, because Vaucher refers his Ectosperma (Vaucheria) terrestris 
to Protonema velutinum [Agdh.), and which latter is now believed to 
be a rudimentary moss.
I am afraid our Algologists will scarcely 
consent to this summary mode of dealing with the genus Vaucheria, 
and I think Dr. Ayres can scarcely be acquainted with the V.
terres- 
tris of our botanists, or he would not follow Vaucher in confounding 
it with Protonema velutinum.
That the whole genus Protonema is 
composed of the commencement of other Cryptogamia, chiefly mosses, 
is, I think, generally agreed on by botanists ; but that " the Vauche- 
riae are the rudimentary states of the mosses, and that the ovoid ves- 
icles are analogous to granules, and reproduce the primordial state of 
the moss," is surely an untenable position.
What a splendid moss 
must it be, whose byssoid commencement is one or two feet long, and 
as stout as a Chara !
â€” yet if Dr. Ayres' views are correct, such is V.
dichotoma : and where have the salt-water mosses come from to pro- 
duce V.
marina and V.
velutina ?
If Vaucheria is denied a place as 
a separate genus, so I suppose must Bryopsis and Codium, for these 
genera are very closely allied to Vaucheria, indeed it is very difficult 
to separate the latter most singular genus from it by a definite cha- 
racter.
As I am on the subject of these Cryptogamia, permit me a 
word on the plants associated with the supposed genus Protonema in 
the group Byssoidese of the Confervoideae, â€” Hooker 8fc.
(Chlorosper- 
mese, Harvey) ; these consist of the genera Byssocladium, Mycinema, 
Chroolepus, Trentepohlia, Protonema, Hygrocrocis and Leptomitus.
The whole genus Mycinema appears evidently to be altogether com- 
posed of imperfect Fungi, probably Thelephorse, and Dr. Ayres and 
others refer M.
phosphoreum to a not uncommon state of Auricularia 
(Thelephora) cserulea.
If Chroolepus be retained in the Algae, Mo- 
nilia, Helmisporium and many other genera must be removed thither 
from the Fungi ; surely however their structure is completely that of 
the latter tribe, and Arnott, Carmichael, Hooker, and other eminent 
Cryptogamists, are of this opinion.
It seems to me likely that the 
Lichen heterophyllus of Smith (Eng. Bot.
2246), a plant which has 
occasioned considerable peiplexity, and which is doubtfully referred 
in the ' British Flora' to Cornicularia {Ach.), is a species of Chroole- 
907 
pus or an allied genus.
Hygvocrocis and Byssocladium should surely 
be classed near the Mucors : Leptomitus clavatus cannot, by its ha- 
bitat (dead animals), be an Alga, (Br. Fl.
385) : L.
minutissimus is 
stated to be the fibrillae so often found besetting the apices of the 
Polysiphonse, (Brit.
Flor.) : L.
lacteus (Conferva lactea, Dillwyn) 
seems a doubtful plant, but if an Alga, would surely rank better with 
the Gloiocladae, perhaps near Chaitophora or Rivularia.
How Tren- 
tepohlia is arranged in this tribe, 1 cannot understand ; its affinity is 
surely with Calithamnion, Griffithsia, &c.
among the Ceramieae, in- 
deed I cannot distinguish authentic specimens of T.
purpurea from 
Calithamnion Rothii ; and Hooker says " I am almost inclined to 
think it may be that species altered by growing in situations where 
it is only occasionally wet with salt water." I have thrown out these 
hints in the hope of eliciting some opinion from better Cryptogamists 
than I can pretend to be.

Note on Equisetum umhrosum.
With respect to your corre- 
spondent Mr. Gibson's enquiry (Phytol.
680), whether Equisetum 
umbrosum or E.
arvense "be the more glaucous of the two," I may 
remark, having gathered both plants, that Francis is correct in saying 
that the former is the more glaucous plant.
The passage referred to 
in the ' British Flora ' seems likely to be an error of the press, for the 
light green glaucous coloin* of E.
umbrosum is a very apparent and 
remarkable character, and which distinguishes it, even at a distance, 
Irom any other British Equisetum that I am acquainted with.
â€” Id.

Note on Hieracium hypocJiceroides, in reference to Mr. IVat- 
son''s Notes.* I now give the following descriptions of Hieracium inu- 
rorum, pulmonarium and maculatum, from Smith's ' English Flora.' 
" H.
murorum.
Stem corymbose, with a solitary leaf.
Leaves ovate-heart-shaped, 
wavy, with radiating teeth chiefly at the base." â€” Eng. Flora, iii.
359.
" H.
pulmonarium.
Stem somewhat corymbose, solid, slightly leafy.
Leaves lan- 
ceolate, deeply and unequally toothed throughout; teeth pointing forward.'' â€” Id. 360.
" H.
maculatum.
Stem cymose, many-leaved, tubular.
Leaves ovate-lanceolate, 
strongly toothed ; teeth pointing forward." â€” Id. 362.
It will be evident on examination that the descriptions above quoted 
do present characteristics sufficiently distinct to justify the adoption 
of three species, and I will now see how far my plant will agree with 
those descriptions.
On examination I find my plant to differ from 
the description of H.
murorum, in the stem being only one- or two- 
Jiowered (Mr. Watson says it has from one to three) ; this cannot be 
* The former part of Mr. Gibson's communication is merely a repetition of what 
Mr. Watson has written at pp.
801 and 841, to which we beg to refer the reader.
Ed.
908 
considered a corymbose stem : it also differs in having the teeth of its 
leaves pointing forward, and therefore cannot be said to have radiant 
teeth.
The want of a corymbus and lanceolate leaves will serve to 
distinguish it from H.
palmonarium.
Its naked and solid stem will 
serve to distinguish it from every form of H.
maculatum.
Many other 
characters might have been pointed out to distinguish the above plants, 
but as Mr. Watson only refers to Smith, 1 will seek no other authorit y 
and will now conclude with saying that I am much surprised to find 
that Mr. Watson, after he has paid so much attention to Botany, 
should consider the absence or presence of medulla in the stems of 
plants, to be of no value as a character whereby to distinguish them 
as species.
It is to be regretted that such valuable characters are not 
duly appreciated ; but it is an indisputable fact, that unless we sub- 
mit to a careful investigation, the greatest errors may be committed.

Enquiry respecting Phascum multicapsulare, Smith.
Permit 
me to enquire, through the medium of ' The Phytologist,' whether 
anything is known concerning this moss, which is in all probability 
distinct from every other described British species.
It has usually 
been regarded as a variety of P.
crispum, (see Hooker and Taylor's 
' Muscologia Britannica' &c.) ; but it appears from the account given 
of it in Bridel's ' Bryologia Universa,' i.
48, that Dr. Mohr, having 
received specimens from Mr. Turner, saw reason to abandon such an 
opinion ; and accordingly, in Weber and Mohr's Bot. Tasch.
p. 477, 
it is separated from Phascum crispum, on the ground that it has the 
leaves evidently serrulate ; and Smith (Flor.
Brit.
1152) describes it 
as differing from P.
crispum in having its perichsetial leaves straight, 
and never crisped when dry ; also of a more dusky hue.
The place 
of growth is stated to be in cart-ruts in Clapham-park wood, near 
Clapham-ford end, and other places near Bedford, (Rev. Dr.
Abbott).
It is, however, figured under the name of Phascum crispum in * Eng- 
lish Botany,' t.
618, and at that time Smith entertained no doubt of 
its being the true Hedvvigian species so called.
A subsequent change 
of opinion on the part of Smith, is a strong argument in favour of the 
moss being distinct ; and it is hoped that some one residing in Bed- 
fordshire will endeavour to serve the cause of science in instituting a 
search for this moss.
The numerous capsules on each stem will 
serve to indicate the plant.

Note on the production of Shoots of Cytisus Laburnum and 
C. purpureus from grafts of C.
Laburnum coccineum.
In Mr. Young's 
909 
nursery-ground at Milford, near Godalming, there are several trees of 
Cytisus Laburnum coccineum, similar to that in the Royal Botanic 
Garden at Edinburgh, of which specimens were exhibited at the meet- 
ing of the Botanical Society of Edinburgh, on the 8th of Jime, 1843 
(Phytol.
653), in which, from the giafting of the French hybrid â€” the 
C. Laburnum coccineum, on the C.
Laburnum, the result has been 
the production of shoots of three varieties, â€” C.
Laburnum coccineum, 
C. Laburnum and C.
purpureus.
I observed these trees in blossom 
last year, when, as in the Edinburgh tree, the yellow and red flowers 
were predominant.
Even in their present leafless condition they pre- 
sent a singular appearance : the cherry-tree-like branches of C.
La- 
burnum coccineum being very distinct from those of C.
Laburnum, 
which retain their decayed seed-vessels, while the pendulous tufts of 
C. purpureus appear, at a short distance, like bunches of mistletoe.
Mr. Young states that it is about six years since he first noticed the 
tendency of the mule laburnum to reproduce the forms of the parent 
plants.

The allied species was found in 1832, in Glen Phee, Clova, by the 
party accompanying Dr. Graham on his annual botanical excursion 
to the Highlands, and was considered a form of C.
saxatilis, L.
; but 
Dr. Boott's attention having been called to it by Mr. W, Wilson, 
he has been led to regard it as a distinct species, and has named it 
C. Grahami.
The following characters are given : â€” 
Carex Grahami.
Spikes 4 â€” 5, cylindrical, ferruginous; barren spikes 2 (rarely 1), 
slender, acute ; fertile spikes 2 â€” 3, rather remote, stout, obtuse, the lower ones pe- 
dunculated, without sheaths, somewhat nodding: stigmas 2: perigynium oblong-ovate, 
inflated, nerved, somewhat erect, ferruginous (rarely straw-coloured), pale at the base, 
twice the length of the glume, beak bifurcate ; glumes ovate, acute, brown, white at 
the apex, with a pale nerve.
Carex saxatilis.
Spikes 2 â€” 3 blackish purple; barren spike 1 (rarely 2), cylindri- 
cal, pedunculated ; fertile spikes 1 â€” 2, rounded or ovate, the lower one more or less 
pedunculated, bracteated, without a sheath, erect: stigmas 2 â€” 3: perigynium some- 
what globose or ovate, with a notched beak, stipitate, spreading, nerveless, blackish 
purple, paler at the base, longer than the glume ; glumes ovate, rather obtuse, black- 
ish purple, white at the apex, nerve concolorous.

the C.
pulla of Goodenough to be identical with C.
saxatilis, X.; he 
also points out the origin of the confusion of the latter with C.
rigida.
Good.
The characters distinguishing C.
Grahami and C.
saxatilis are 
then more minutely examined, and the author adds that he should not 
doubt their specific distinctness, but for the observations of Drejer, 
who, in his ' Revisio critica Caricum Borealium,' under the name of 
C. pulla, ^.fuscay describes specimens from Iceland and Greenland 
closely agreeing with C.
Grahami, except that no mention is made of 
the nerves of the perigynium, and remarks that the Greenland speci- 
mens arc so very variable that they would scarcely be thought to be- 
911 
long to the same species.
In the absence of precise information on 
the subject, Dr. Boott is incHned to refer to Presl's C.
physocarpa (a 
native of Nootka Sound), both the larger Greenland specimens, and 
others from the Rocky Mountains described by him as C.
saxatilis in 
Hooker's ' Flora Boreali-Americana.' The author, while he repeats 
that both himself and Mr. Wilson consider C.
Grahami entitled to 
rank as a species, yet leaves it to future observers to determine the va- 
lue of the character given for it, and whether it is to be retained as 
distinct, referred back to C.
saxatilis (i.), or transferred to C.
physo- 
carpa (Presl.)

BOTANICAL SOCIETY OF LONDON.
February 2, 1844.
â€” A.
Gerard, Esq., in the chair.
Various donations to the library and herbarium were announced, 
including 44 new species of mosses, collected at Swan River by Mr.
James Drummond.
Read the commencement of a paper by Edwin Lees, Esq., F.L.S., 
being * A Synoptical View of the British Fruticose Rubi, an-anged in 
Groups, with explanatory remarks.' The groups into which Mr. Lees 
unites the species have been already reported (Phytol.
655).
The 
list of species will shortly be published in a new Catalogue of British 
Plants, now in the press for the Botanical Society of London.
The following explanations, in the words of the author, will suffi- 
ciently show that this arrangement has not been founded upon any 
brief or superficial study of his subject.
*' Having previously designated the general groups into which the 
British Fruticose Rubi are divisible, I now proceed to attempt the 
more difficult task of describing the species in each group, and tra- 
cing them in succession in a synoptical form.
In doing this, as I 
must necessarily propose some alterations, it is advisable that the 
candid and enquiring botanist should be informed as to the principles 
I have kept in view.
" In the first place, then, I have desired to make no innovation but 
what seemed imperatively required for correct elucidation, and have 
therefore made every effort to profit by the labours of preceding emi- 
912 
nent botanists, who have particularly studied the Rubi, as Sir J.
E. 
Smith, Drs. Weihe and Nees ab Essenbeck, Mr. Borrer and Professor 
Lindley.
But secondly, I have observed with the eye of an original 
explorer, tracing every form that appeared to me different, without 
reference to the ideas of other botanists.
And thirdly, having observ- 
ed the same plants in a living state for several successive years, I have 
collated and revised my original observations, sketched every appa- 
rent species, and compared them again and again with the figures, 
descriptions and named specimens of botanists of authority.
Thus I 
have been enabled in a great degree to understand the forms to which 
particular names have been assigned, and to test their propriety by my 
own experience.
I trust, therefore, that I shall not be considered 
guilty of assumption when I may differ from others, being only anx- 
ious for the nearest approximation to correctness.
" It is unnecessary for me to go into the question as to what con- 
stitutes a species in this genus ; for, as I have before hinted, it is not 
unlikely that the forms in every group may be really only varieties, 
sporting from a normal form and into each other.
But if Botany be 
a science of discrimination, it is at any rate convenient to name every 
remarkable continuing form as a species or sub-species, since other- 
wise minor variations can scarcely be distinguished, or must be placed 
in the same rank with more important deviations of structure.
Indeed 
Nees Von Essenbeck, one of the authors of the elaborate * Rubi Ger- 
manici,' has well remarked in a letter to the Rev. Mr.
Leighton, in 
the Shropshire Flora, â€” ' I am not of opinion that all the forms pro- 
posed by my friend Mr. Weihe as species, are to be considered as 
such, but in my opinion it is absolutely necessary to look for the great- 
est number of forms which present themselves in the genus, before 
attempting to judge of species and fixing their limits.
I can scarcely 
tell which is most perplexing in the path of our science, whether, with 
Mr. Weihe, to distinguish as species every form of bramble that pre- 
sents itself to our view, or, with Mr. Koch, to consider all as modifi- 
cations of one only.
In this case I do not doubt that these are mat- 
ters purely of observation, and that the faithful observer of Nature 
will find that the truth really is between these two extremes.'" G.

â€” Notes on Botanical Classijication.
By Edward Forstek, Esq., V.P.L.S., &c.
Woodford, March 13, 1844.
Sir, 
On reading the ' Remarks on Botanical Classification,' by 
Mr. Thomas Edmonston, jun.
(Phytol.
759), in which there is so much 
good sense and clear understanding, I felt incHued to express my gra- 
tification ; but on reflection it appeared to me that his observations 
wanted no additional strength.
The case is now altered by the Arti- 
cle 199, in No. 34, called a Reply, (Phytol.
885), which arouses an 
old botanist to stand forth in defence of one who has so well pointed 
out the use of a simple artificial scheme.
It may not be amiss first 
to remark that a misvmderstanding has long been prevalent with re- 
gard to the words artificial and natural, as applied to botanical sys- 
tems ; the original meaning was, that in one, the evident affinity is 
not so apparent as in the other ; it surely cannot be denied that the 
sexual system of Linnaeus is really as natural as those of Ray, Jussieu, 
DeCandolle &c., which are founded on other characters.
I fear Lin- 
naeus himself was the author of the misnomer.
On looking carefully at the first paragraph in p.
886, I am well 
convinced that Mr. Edmonston and Dr. Ayres differ only in words, 
the latter using species in a sense not usual.
He begins by entirely 
dissenting frOm Mr. Edmonston's assertion that " Nature creates spe- 
cies;"* then follows, "for it is easy to perceive that the term species 
is applied to an assemblage of individuals, which, from their great re- 
semblance to each other and their capability of propagating their kind, 
are called species." A little further on we have, "I contend that Na- 
ture simply created individuals capable of propagating their kind.
And 
if we trust the Mosaic account of the creation, we shall see reason to 
believe that plants as well as animals were individually created." This 
is all we want, â€” our term species meaning the progeny of the first- 
created individuals.
Certainly, the capability of thus propagating their 
kind is a very strong presumptive proof that they are so.
The passage 
* A misquotation : the passage is, " Nature creates only species.
4i 
914 
goes on, " It is evident that the term species applies to one of the pri- 
mary inductions from a comparison of individuals ; not that a species 
has any absolute existence, but is merely the conception or expression 
of the points of resemblance of a certain number of individuals bearing 
the greatest resemblance to each other.
Another argument against Mr.
Edmonston's view is the fact of the existence of varieties; a still low- 
er induction from individuals." Whatever is meant by this scholastic 
induction, it would rather seem to contradict the writer's own words 
quoted above, but I am doubtful if I understand it.
The fact of the ex- 
istence of varieties is surely no argument against Mr. Edmonston's view.
Again, " The quotation from Dr. Lindley's Key to Botany is not 
sufficiently ample, Mr. Edmonston should have added the next para- 
graph." "'What we call the characters of plants are merely the signs 
by which we judge of affinity, and all the groups into which plants 
are thrown, are in one sense artificial, inasmuch as Nature recognizes 
no such groups.
Nevertheless, consisting in all cases of species very 
closely allied to each other, they are in another sense natural .
' The 
addition of the last sentence very much alters our notion of Dr. Lind- 
ley's expression ; for now he implies that Nature has not created spe- 
cies, orders, genera, or other groups as such." This quotation from 
Lindley surely very much confirms Mr. Edmonston's argument.
It 
is quite clear that Lindley uses the word species exactly as I have 
endeavoured to show is the true meaning.
If the passage be read 
with attention, it will be seen that he refers to groups of species, and 
by no means implies that Nature has not created species, which word 
is introduced by Dr. Ayres in his inference ; Lindley's meaning being 
that the arrangement of species into genera is the work of man, found- 
ed on natural affinities.
It might perhaps have been rather more accurate if Mr. Edmonston 
had said, Nature created species, instead of using the present tense ; 
by Nature no man in his senses can suppose that he means any other 
than Divine power.
Having, I trust, shown that Mr. Edmonston and Dr. Ayres, both of 
whom are unknown to me, except by their writings in ' The Phytolo- 
gist' do not differ except in the use of words, I am led to lament, that 
fashionable botanists of the present day are in the constant habit of 
using words in a new sense.
We can scarcely meet one, in whose 
conversation the word form is not introduced by hook or by crook, 
for species, genus, group or anything else.
Our language does not 
want it, but for variety it is not improper.
I am ready to allow that 
were it not for the indecent want of reverence in attributing to Na- 
915 
ture, the working by carpenter's rule, the term normal form is quite 
as melodious as type of the species hitherto adopted for the usual and 
regular habit or forin of a plant from which the specific distinctive 
characters ought to be taken ; and is equally inaccurate.
Normal as 
applied by legislators to model prisons and schools, has Latin autho- 
rity ; in the case of plants model will hardly do.
I hope the above explanation of the word species may tend to 
check young men from talking of " making species," or boasting of 
" exalting varieties to the rank of species," neither of which is in the 
]X)wer of mortal man.
T will now conclude with saying, far be it from 
the most ardent admirers of the great Linnasus, or the zealous defend- 
ers of his sexual, commonly called artificial system, to disparage any 
others, founded on analogy; much less to discourage the beautiful 
study of Physiology, without the knowledge of which no man can be- 
come a thoroughly scientific botanist.
I am, Sir.
Yours sincerely, 
Edward Forster.

â€” List of a few of the Botanical Rarities collected in 
Scotland in 1843.
By William Gardiner, Esq.
Lychnis viscaria, L.
Gathered in a new station, in July, namely, 
wooded banks of the Ericht near Craighall, about two miles above 
Blairgowrie, Perthshire.
Only two or three specimens in flower.
Lychnis alpina, L.
This very interesting and rare species I col- 
lected on the summit of Culrannoch, one of the Clova mountains, 
about 3200 feet high, in the midst of a terrific hail-storm in July.
It 
grew on wet stony ground, associated with Armeria maritima, /3, alpina.
Linncea horealis, Gronov.
Plentiful among the mossy rocks at the 
base of Craig Maid, in Glen Dole, Clova, July 28, bearing abundant- 
ly its graceful snowy and rose-tinted blossoms, loading the summer 
air with their rich perfume.
Sonchus alpinus, L.
This was culled from two stations in Glen 
Dole in July and August, carefully leaving the roots, and observed in 
several other places about the rocks of Craig Maid but inaccessible.
Erigeron alpinus, L.
In Caulochen and in Glen Dole, high on the 
rocks, but in small quantity.
Moneses grandijlora, Salisb.
Moist shady woods, Scone, Perth- 
shire, flowering in June, but very deficient in size this season.
4x2 
010

at a good elevation, associated with P.
secunda, but neither of them 
in plenty.
Asperugo procumhens, L.
Found in June on a bank near Aucmi- 
thie, coast of Forfarshire.
Vero7}ica alpina, L.
This was found abundantly in Caulochen- 
glen in July, and more sparingly in Glen Dole, both in flower and fruit.
It loves to grow about the sides of rills, and on the moist rocky banks 
of old watercourses.
Veronica sa.vatilis, L.
This brilliant-flowered species adorned the 
rocks of Caulochen in great profusion, and occurred also on the rocks 
in Glen Dole, and in the corrie of Ben Red.
Salix amhigua, Ehrh., jS".
arenaria, L., ^S*.
Mrta, Sm., iS*.
nigricans, 
Sm., S.
Forsteriana, Sm., S.
Davalliana, Sm., and ^S*.
Imiata, L., 
were found in Glen Dole and Glen Clova ; S.
petraa, And., S.
Myr- 
sinites, L., ^S*.
procumhens, Forbes, and S.
lanata, L., in Caulochen.
Scheuchzeria palustris, L.
In a marsh near Methven, Perthshire.
Potamogeto7i zosterapfolins, Schum.
Rather plentiful in Rescobie- 
lake, Forfarshire, bearing flower-spikes in August.
Juncus Balticus, Willd.
Very abundant on the sands of Barrie.
Alopecurus alpinus, Sm. This occurred in various localities about 
Clova, but in greatest quantity and in finest condition on the wet rocks 
about the waterfalls of Craig Wharral, above the loch.
Phleum alpinum, L.
Was gathered on the moist grassy banks of 
the Feula-burn, above the falls ; upon the bank of the Glashie-burn, 
which runs into the glen of Caness ; and very fine about a small wa- 
terfall not far from Loch Brandy, called " the wash of the coirie of 
Clova." 
Car ex aquatills, Wahl.?
Abundant on the moist banks of Feula- 
burn, Clova, and near the head of Caness, rarely attaining the height 
of a foot, but growing on the margin of the Esk in Glen Clova, to more 
than double that size.
Care.v rarijlora, Sm. For this rare species I discovered a new sta- 
tion in the Clova district, namely a bog at the head of Caness, where 
it occurred in fully greater plenty than in the bog at the head of Glen 
Dole.
Equisetum variegaium, Schleich.
Sands of Barrie, in fi'uit from 
April to October.
Splachnmn vasculosum, Hedw.
On the marshy banks of Feula- 
burn above, the falls, this moss occurred in fine fructification in July; 
and in August 1 detected it in a similai* spot on the banks of Loch 
917 
Brandy stream, also bearing capsules, rendered conspicuous by their 
large dark brown apophyses, nestling among the broad and ample 
foliage.
Weissia iiigrUa, Hedvv.
On the sands of Barrie, bearing fruit in 
September.
I also found it with capsules in January, 1844, as well 
as Didymodon inclinatus, Sm., with which it grows associated.
Grimntia Doniana, Sm. Growing in small tufts, principally in the 
hollows of rocks and stones, on the Sidlaw-hills, near their summits ; 
plentifully in fruit in April.
Didymodon Bruntoni, Arn. Rocks on the Sidlaw-hills, and about 
the Reeky Linn, in April and May.
Dicranum polycarpon, Ehrh.
Plentiful on rocks in Glen Dole and 
on Carlovvrie mountain, Clova.
Dicranum fulvell um, Sm. On moist rocks in Glen Dole, but rare.
Orthotrichum Drummondii, Hedw.
Abundant on the few scattered 
old trees in Glen Dole.
Bryum trichodes, L.
Among the rocks of Caulochen, and more 
abundantly in moist places on the sands of Barrie.
Capsules mature 
in the latter place in June, in the former in July.
Bartr<imia gracilis, Fltirkc.
This was gathered in Glen Dole, Cau- 
lochen, and Craighall, in July, and bearing profusion of capsules, al- 
though these are esteemed rare.
Biixhaumia aphylla, L.
On the northern declivity of one of the 
Sidlaw-hills, where I have gathered it for several successive seasons.
It grows in small earthy hollows among the heath, probably where 
snow has lain late in the spring.
Hypiium molle, Dicks.
In Loch Brandy stream, and also in a ri- 
vulet in Glen Dole.
Hypnnm Crista-castrensis, L.
This grows abundantly among the 
loose rocks at the base of Craig Maid, Glen Dole, a short distance 
below the falls of the White-water, but only a specimen or two were 
found with mature capsules, although there appeared to be plenty in a 
young state.
Jungermannia Taylori, Hook.
Plentiful on wet rocks in Glen Dole, 
along with J, julacea.
Jungermannia setijbrmis, Ehrh.
This fine species 1 collected in 
Glen Dole, Caulochen, Ben Red &c., growing upon the rocks in broad 
tufts or cushions.
Cetraria juniper inuy Ach. A single specimen found in Decrhill 
wood, about eight miles north from Dundee, in April.
Cetraria sepincola, Ach. This is abundant in the same wood, in- 
918 
vesting trunks and branches of fir-trees, along with C.
glauca, but al- 
though apothecia are frequent on the latter, only one specimen of the 
former has as yet been found possessed of them.
C. Islandica is scat- 
tered plentifully over all the Clova mountains, and occurs sparingly 
on the Sidlaw-hills.
C. nivalis, in the Clova district, is confined to 
the summit of the Bassies.
Usnea harhata, Ach. Several specimens of this were found with 
apothecia in the Deerhill wood.
Alectoria juhata, Ach. A specimen or two of this were gathered in 
the same wood in April, with apothecia, which are different from what 
has been previously figured as such, and which Sir W.
J. Hooker and 
Mr. Borrer pronounce to be the true fructification.
As this lichen is 
very abundant in Deerhill wood, I have good hopes of being able to 
supply each subscriber to my botanical distribution of 1844, with a 
fructified specimen.

â€” Notes on Career teretiuscula, C.
paradoxa, C.
pani- 
culata, and Mr. Gibson's C.
pseudo-paradoxa.
By George 
LUXFORD, A.L.S., &c.
(Concluded from p.
897).
The three recognized species of Carex, the names of which stand 
at the head of these notes, fully exemplify the absolute necessity of 
studying numerous specimens of plants, from different localities, be- 
fore we can arrive at anything like a connect estimate of the extent of 
their variations in habit, or discover the permanent character peculiar 
to the species to which they respectively belong.* These three spe- 
cies, together with Carex vulpina and Mr. Gibson's C.
pseudo-para- 
doxa, form a small but natural group of British Carices, which agree 
generally in their compound inflorescence, but more particularly in 
their perigynia being cordate at the base and stipitate, with the style 
more or less enlarged in the lower part.
The inflorescence of Carex 
* By the word -permanent, as used above, must not be understood an unvarying ad- 
herence to size, form, colour or proportions, but such a degree of general resemblance 
among themselves, often more readily seen than described, as w^ill enable the student 
to refer the objects of his investigation to a certain determinate standard, usually de- 
nominated the normal form or type of the species.
The limits of possible variation 
from this staudard are frequently very wide.
A reference to our domestic animals, 
and our cultivated plants and fruits, will explain my meaning.
919 
vulpina is tolerably constant; but in C.
paniculata it is so exceed- 
ingly variable, that the only part on which we can depend as afford- 
ing a permanent specific character is the fruit.* The fruit indeed is 
now generally referred to by botanists in their characters and descrip- 
tions of the numerous species of Carex, but its value will be peculiarly 
apparent in a plant, the habit of which is so liable to variation as that 
of C.
paniculata.
No dependance can be placed on the inflorescence, 
for in my specimens this varies from a nearly simple elongated spike, 
through different gradations, up to a regular panicle with branches 
between three and four inches long â€” a variation pointed out by Mr.
Babington and other botanists.
A good character would seem to be 
afforded by the tendency of the root to form large tufts ; but as this 
appears also to be the case with the root of the new Carex paradoxa, 
as well as, although in a less degree, with that of C.
teretiuscula ; we 
are obliged, especially for home study, to have recourse to the fruit 
for a character, and a most satisfactory one is afforded by it.

base of its style.
The following is Mr. Moore's description of the fruit 
of this species, as contrasted with that of C.
paradoxa, in the ' London 
Jom-nal of Botany' for March, 1843, " Fruit plano-convex, between 
deltoid and triangular, with a broad serrated margin extending from 
the middle to the bidentate beak, broad and subcordate at the base, 
stipitate, striated on both surfaces; striae scarcely extending down the 
slender stipitate point of attachment." 
The above remarks on the variable nature 
of the inflorescence of Carex paniculata, are 
equally ajaplicable to that of C.
paradoxa.
The specimens kindly sent me by Mr. Spruce 
are truly panicled, the branches of the pani- 
cle varying in length from a quarter of an 
inch to about an inch and a half.
A speci- 
men from Westmeath, collected by Mr. D.
Moore, and kindly forwarded by Mr. W.
Wilson, has the branches of the panicle very 
short, with its spikelets densely aggregated ; 
and in other specimens from the Irish loca- 
lity, also from Mr. D.
Moore, in the posses- 
sion of the Botanical Society of London, the 
perigynium and nut of c.
paradoxa.
panicle is rcduccd to a compouud spike, with 
the spikelets sessile upon the common axis.
The panicle of this species, when in fruit, has a peculiarly neat ap- 
pearance, reminding one of that of Juncus coenosus ; in its stem and 
foliage it resembles Carex teretiuscula.
Being intermediate between 
C. paniculata and C.
teretiuscula, as mentioned by Sir W.
J. Hooker, 
and nearly allied to both species, it is desirable to find some permanent 
character whereby it may be distinguished from them ; this character 
is here also admirably furnished by the fruit, which is perfectly iden- 
tical in all the specimens above mentioned, agreeing, except in one 
particular, with Mr. Moore's description quoted below from the 'Lon- 
don Journal of Botany.' " Fruit ovate-subrotund, gibbous on the in- 
ner face, with a long slender beak, slightly cloven, and edged with a 
narrow serrulated margin,* base graduallyf lengthened out into a 
* The serrulated margin of tlie beak could not be shown in the figure, from the po- 
sition of the perigynium, which is represented as lying on its side.
f The base of the perigynium can scarcely be said to be gradually lengthened out 
into the stipes.
In this respect, as mentioned by Mr. Wilson, Schkuhr's figure is un- 
satisfactory, since it represents the base of the perigynium as tapering down into the 
stipes, instead of cordate, as it really is.
921 
strong stipitate point of attachment, which is a continuation of the 
convex surface, with strong nerves all round, which extend down the 
stipe." The figure of the perigynium given above, is a profile view 
from a sketch by Mr. Wilson.
The sketch was made from a fruit 
of Mr. Moore's Irish plant in the possession of Mr. Wilson.
The difference in the outline of the nuts of the two species is suffi- 
ciently shown by the figures ; there is considerable resemblance be- 
tween the perigynia of the two when viewed in front, the most obvious 
difference consisting in the broadly winged and cloven beak of the 
one and the serrulated emarginate beak of the other.
When however 
the perigynia are viewed in profile, a most striking dissimilarity is ob- 
servable : in C.
paradoxa the lower part being inflated with the inner 
face gibbous, while in C.
paniculata the inner face is nearly flat.
It 
will be seen that the nut scarcely differs in outline from that of C.
tere- 
tiuscula.
For an account of the discovery of this beautiful Carex in 
Yorkshire, and a notice of its mode of growth in that locality, I beg to 
refer to Mr. Spruce's note, (Phytol.
842).
Seeing then that these two species are so subject to variation in the 
character of their inflorescence, we surely cannot feel surprized if we 
find that their natural ally, C.
teretiuscula, is also variable in this re- 
spect, as indeed it is, although in a less degree.
Some specimens 
now before me have their spikelets densely aggregated into a short 
roundish head ; in others the compound spike is more or less elon- 
gated, even to above an an inch in length : but amid all these varia- 
tions in the inflorescence, this species is well distinguished from its 
ally, C.
paniculata, both by the fruit and the form of the stem, which, 
in the latter, has three acute angles with the interstices flat, while the 
angles of the stem in C.
teretiuscula are obtuse, with a projecting line 
in the centre of two of the sides : thus a transverse section of the one 
presents an acutely triangular outline, while in the other the outline 
is roundish.
In the form of the stem and general habit C.
paradoxa 
bears a considerable resemblance to C.
teretiuscula, but the two are 
strikingly distinguished by the very different forms of their fruit.
And 
here perhaps it may not be out of place to mention that while they re- 
tain their general specific characters, I have found both the perigy- 
nium and nut of C.
teretiuscula to be subject to greater variations of 
form and outline than those of either of the two species named above.
These variations I am inclined to think may be attributed to the fruit 
being examined in different stages of maturity.
The nut, in what is 
generally considered its normal form, has a turbinate outline, as re- 
presented in Mr. Leigh ton's figure ; but I have as often found it to 
922 
correspond with Mr. Wilson's figure {d, p.
919), and even with greater 
breadth in proportion to its length than that figure exhibits.
There 
is, however, one part in which I have never observed any variation ; 
and I have taken great pains to verify my observations on this point, 
because they are at variance with the figure given by Mr. Leighton, 
and the descriptions of most botanists ; I allude to the enlarged base 
of the style, which is quite as constant, though not so conspicuous, 
in this species as in either C.
vulpina or C.
paniculata; but there is 
no constriction in the lower part of the enlargement, as there is in the 
two species last mentioned.
In stating that the base of the style of 
C. teretiuscula is always enlarged, I am happy to be supported by the 
valuable testimony of Mr. Wilson, in whose figure d is shown the 
style with its enlarged base.
Schkuhr also has accurately figured 
the nut of this species {I, in tab.
D, 19), both in its outline and the 
swollen base of the style.
The figure of the perigynium of C.
teretiuscula in Leighton's ' Flo- 
ra of Shropshire' represents that part more cordate at the base than 
Mr. Wilson's sketch, [c.
Phytol.
919).
In this respect also I have 
observed considerable variations from what may be looked upon as 
the normal form, which variations, as I have before stated, I am in- 
clined to attribute to a difference in the state of maturity.
The num- 
ber of ribs on the outer side is also variable in a certain degree.
The 
beak is scarcely notched, never deeply cloven, and its marginal wings 
are narrow, green and serrulate.
With respect to the root of this species there appears to be a slight 
diversity of opinion among botanists.
For while Smith and Leighton 
agree in calling the root " slightly creeping," and the former author 
says it is "not densely tufted," and the latter that it is "slightly creep- 
ing into scattered simple not dense tufts," â€” Mr. Babington describes 
it as "forming scattered simple tufts, not truly creeping." From this 
it is, I think, evident that the root, like the inflorescence, is liable to 
be modified by local and other circumstances ; and it appears to me 
not at all wonderful that these circumstances should also occasionally 
produce such changes in the habit and general appearance of this 
species, as well as of others belonging to the same group, as would 
cause considerable perplexity to a botanist, and lead him to conclude 
that he had found something new on seeing the plant for the first time 
in its modified form.
Such circumstances, I doubt not, have operat- 
ed on the plant named Carex pseudo-paradoxa by Mr. Gibson, and 
caused the deviations from what I believe to be the normal form, that 
have led that botanist to describe the plant as a new species.
The 
923 
]ieculiarites in the locality and manner of growth of this plant have 
already been explained by Dr. Wood, (Phytol.
809) ; and it appears 
from the evidence before me, that the root has been acted on in that 
locality more than any other part of the plant.
For in my numerous 
specimens from that spot I find the inflorescence undergoing precise- 
ly the same changes as 1 have before stated to be common in the true 
C. teretiuscula.
The perigynium is equally variable in its form and 
markings with that of C.
teretiuscula, â€” the number of ribs varying 
from four to six or seven, and the breadth at the base being more or 
less great in proportion to its length ; but the perigynia of the two 
agree precisely in their general outline, their cordate base, and their 
scarcely notched beak with its serrulated margins Fig. e (p.
919) 
represents a perigynium of the disputed plant ; it is the broadest form 
I have met with, but there are regular gradations from it to the nar- 
row form figured at c, and the same form I have not unfrequently met 
with in the normal state of the species.
The nut, too (/), so fiir as I 
can see, is perfectly identical in the two plants.
There are the same 
variations in outline, and, what is of perhaps greater importance, the 
base of the style in the two plants is enlarged in precisely the same 
manner.
Figs, d and /"show almost the extreme forms, and these, 
like the perigynia, I find to be connected by very regular grades.
Tn addition to the above characters I may remark that the culms, 
foliage, bracts and other parts, together with the general habit of the 
two plants, are all strongly indicative of the closest afiinity, nay, even 
of specific identity.
In the ' London Catalogue of British Plants,' by the Botanical So- 
ciety, published since the above notes were written, the disputed Ca- 
rex stands as var.
h. pseudo-paradoxa, under C.
teretiuscula.
This is 
doubtless its true place, if allowed to retain an existence separate from 
the normal form : for as a distinct species it certainly appears to have 
no claim to a station in our Flora.
Before I conclude I may perhaps be allowed to point out the very 
slight resemblance between the fruit of this plant and that of Carex 
paniculata (Phytol.
778, &c.) The comparison was certainly rather 
unfortunate, except so far as relates to the sectional likeness between 
the two; for a comparison of fig.
y with 6, will at once show a marvel- 
lous difference in the outline of the nut of Carex paniculata and that 
of the disputed plant, a diff'erence, indeed, as great as that existing 
between the two perigynia represented by a and c.
The discrepan- 
cies are so striking, that, coupled as they are with other marks of dis- 
tinction equally if not still more obvious, we cannot but wonder that 
924 
the one should be said to have the fruit as in the other, as much as 
that the normal form of C.
teretiuscula should ever have been consi- 
dered a mere variety of the truly distinct C.
paniculata.
In conclusion I beg to return my best thanks to Mr. Wilson for 
the loan of his sketches and dissections ; as well as to those gentle- 
men who have kindly furnished me with the numerous and beautiful 
specimens which have been used in my investigations, and without 
which my researches could not have been carried out.
As my only 
object in undertaking the task was the hope of eliciting truth, I shall 
be happy to see in the pages of ' The Phytologist ' a record of the 
results of similar researches prosecuted by other enquirers, and that, 
too, whether such results may tend to establish or overthrow my pre- 
sent conviction that the new plant is merely a variety of the species 
usually known as C.
teretiuscula, Good.

â€” Note on the supposed idetitity of Carex fulva, Good- 
enough, with C.
speirostachya, Wahlenberg.* By Fra.ncis 
BooTT, Esq., M.D., F.L.S., &c.
I HAVE been looking at Carex fulva of Goodenough, with a view to 
the opinions of Sir James Smith and the continental botanists, who 
make two species out of the plant originally described by Goodenough 
in the second volume of the Linnean Transactions, 1792 : viz.
â€” 
1. C.
fulva.
Good., and 
2. C.
speirostachya, Wahl.
C. Hornschuchiana, Hoppe, 8fc.
C. Hosteana, Dec. 8fc.
Host, Wahlenberg, Swartz, Smith, Hoppe, Reichenbach, Koch, 
Sprengel, Degland, Decandolle, Brebisson, Boreau, Desporte, Tuc- 
kerman, Don, Macreight, admit two species.
Goodenough, Schkuhr, Willdenow, Gaudin and Mutel notice only 
C. fulva.
CossoB and Germain, Delastre, and Sir W.
J. Hooker make the 
one a variety of the other.
Kunth quotes Hoppe's plant, but was not acquainted with it.
* Communicated by Edw. Forster, Esq., V.F.L.S., and published with Dr. Boott's 
permission.
We trust our readers will endeavour to aid Dr. Boott in this enquiry by 
collecting and transmitting to him any specimens they may meet with.

Winch e cl.
Swartz.
Wahlenberg's name of C.
speirostacliya has the priority over that 
of Decaiidolle and Hoppe.
A Swedish specimen so named by Swartz 
is in Smith's herbarium, and it was adopted in the ' English Flora.' 
Wahlenberg, in the ' Act. Holm.' and the ' Flora Suecica,' mistook 
the plant for C.
binervis, Smith, and a Swedish specimen from Swartz 
so named is in Mr. Winch's herbarium.
The question is, whether the two plants are to be considered as 
species or varieties.
It will be seen by the authorities quoted, that 
by far the most of them make the two specifically distinct.
Cosson 
and Germain, from the circumstance of C.
Hornschuchiana being the 
most common form, take that as the type, and reduce the C.
fulva, 
Good., to the var.
/3., and they are followed by Delastre.
I do not find any British specimens of C.
fulva in Smith's herbari- 
um.
On the sheet holding his specimens marked " C.
fulva," there 
are three from Sweden, from Swartz, which answer to the description 
and figure of Goodenough ; and with these are four from " Prof.
Beattie, Aberdeen, 1799," â€” and three others from ^^ Mack ay, moist 
moorish ground, Scotland, 1796," all of which I think are clearly 
referrible to C.
speirostachya, having the mouth of the perigynium 
026 
deeply cleft and membranous at the margin, one of the chief charac- 
ters which Smith insists upon for that species, but which Hoppe 
neither expresses in his figure nor notices in his description, and it is 
equally passed over by Koch and Reichenbach, and indeed by all the 
authorities J though Wahlenberg, as early as 1803, said "ore bilobo 
hyalino?'' 
The essential difference of C.
speirostachya is a stoloniferous root, 
a more slender smooth culm, narrower and shorter leaves and bracts 
(the last never reaching to the male spike), female spikes often three, 
the lower one subcylindrical (and sometimes compound), perigynium 
greenish, with a narrower, often smooth, cylindrical rostrum, the ori- 
fice of which is two-lobed, and membranous at the margins, the scales 
dark brown.
C. fulva has a csespitose root, grows in denser tufts, so as, Hoppe 
says, to be easily distinguished at a distance, the leaves of a bright 
green and with the bracts broader and longer (the last reaching to the 
male spike), the female spikes commonly two and ovate; the culm 
stouter, with three acute rough angles ; perigynium yellowish with a 
broader conical rougher beak, which is bifid at the orifice, the scales 
of a cinnamon colour.
It would not be difficult to select specimens of each, having more 
or less of these characters well marked, but I think there are inter- 
mediate forms which it would be embarrassing to determine upon.
Cosson and Germain deny that the root of C.
Hornschuchiana is sto- 
loniferous.
Smith describes the root of C.
fulva and of C.
speirosta- 
chya as creeping.
The roughness and smoothness of the culms vary.
The orifice of the perigynium in the specimens of C.
fulva of Swartz 
from Sweden, certainly is slightly membranous at the margin, and this 
character perhaps more or less depends on age.
The colour of the 
perigynium in Swiss specimens of C.
speirostachya from Davall, in 
Smith's herbarium, is yellowish, and Desportes has a variety, ^.Jia- 
vcscens, with " yellowish perigynium and scales," an example of which 
I observe in Winch's herbarium from Swartz, sent as C.
speirostachya.
I suspect the stouter and rougher culm, the broader 8nd longer 
bracts and the rougher rostrum of C.
fulva, would be found, in a large 
suite of specimens, to be unsatisfactory characters.
I find in C.
spei- 
rostachya the number of female spikes to vary from one to three, and 
in Davall's Swiss specimens, in one of those from Swartz from Sweden 
in Smith's herbarium, and in one from Germany from Baron Romer 
ill my own herbarium, they are from five to six, the upper ones crowd- 
927 
cd near the male spike ; while some are barren at the base and others 
at top.
C. speirostachya would seem to be more common in this comitry 
than C.
fulva.
The only habitats for the last that I know of, are Ca- 
toHy near Shrewsbury, quoted by Goodenough.
Kent, sent to me by 
Mr. Peete ; and the Northern Mountains of Ireland, found by Mac- 
reight and given to Mr. Forster.
I cannot satisfactorily quote other 
places.
C. speirostachya I have from Scotland, Wales, Yorkshire 
and Somersetshire.
I shall endeavour to interest British botanists in 
the subject, to fix the localities of the two plants, and to collect spe- 
cimens with ihe roots and mature fruit, that the question maybe 
more satisfactorily settled as to specific difference between them.
Mr. Babington, if I mistake not, leaves the question of specific dif- 
ference undetermined : his book is not by me.

â€” Notice of ' Tlie London Journal of Botany,^ No. 27, 
March, 1844.
By Sir W.
J. Hooker, K.H., LL.D., F.R.A.
and L.S., Vice-President of the Linnean Society, and Director 
of the Royal Botanical Gardens of Kew. London : H.
Bailli- 
ere, 219, Regent Street.
In the present number of this Journal there is much interesting 
matter under the head of " Botanical Information ; " but as this for 
the most part consists of notices of new works on Botany, we can do 
little more than give a sort of running summary of the article.
In Mr. Fielding's ' Sertum Plantarum ' a work similar to Hooker's 
' Icones Plantarum' in its plan, but containing different subjects, will 
928 
be given lithographic figures of " entirely new or very little known 
plants " contained in the author's herbarium.
He will be assisted in 
the work by Mr. Gardner, Superintendent of the Royal Botanic Gar- 
dens, Calcutta.
The first fasciculus is published.
Another work, similar in character, is the ' Sertum Exoticum ' of 
Miguel, author of ' Observationes de Piperaceis et Melastomaceis.' 
The reprint, and translation, of Johnson's 'Iter Plantarum,' has 
already been announced in our pages (Phytol.
908), The original 
of this work is exceedingly rare, the copy in the Banksian library 
now in the British Museum appearing to be the only one in exist- 
ence.
The new edition will be so printed that the English transla- 
tion will occupy the page opposite the Latin text.
The tract contains 
a journal of probably the earliest botanical excursion undertaken by 
the Apothecaries' Company.
The following localities, among others, 
were visited by the author : â€” Erith, Dartford, Gravesend, Rochester, 
Sheppey, Faversham, Canterbury, Margate, Sandwich and Deal, in 
Kent : and in Middlesex, Kentish-town, Highgate and Hampstead, 
including Hampstead-heath and Caen-wood.
By way of comparison 
of the present with the former botanical state of this district, Mr. Ir- 
ving's List of Hampstead-heath Plants will be appended : facsimiles 
of the curious illustrations will also be given.
The eighth volume of DeCandolle's ' Prodromus Syst.
Nat. Regni 
Vegetabilis ' was announced for last November, but had not been re- 
ceived when this No. of the Journal went to press.
This great work 
has been continued by the son of the lamented author, and the assist- 
ance of some of the most eminent botanists of the day has been se- 
cured.
The eighth volume includes the following families : â€” Lenti- 
bularinge, Primulaceae, Myrsinese, iEgiceraceae, Theophrasteae, Sapo- 
tacesB, Ebenacese, Styracese, Oleacese, Jasminese, Apocyneae, and 
Asclepiadese.
In Walper's ' Repertorium Botanices Systematicse ' the arrangement 
of Decandolle's Prodromus has been followed, and it may be consi- 
dered a Supplement to that work.
The second volume concludes with 
the Monotropese.
Three supplementary numbers to Endlicher's ' Genera Planta- 
rum ' have appeared ; they contain new genera, as well as corrections 
of those previously published : the third number includes an arrange- 
ment of the Algse, with their generic characters, a catalogue of species 
and a list of algological writers.
Schnizlein's ' Iconographia Familiarum Naturalium Regni Vegeta- 
bilis' may be considered as supplying the place of Endlicher's ' Ico- 
929 
nographia Generum Plantarum,' which was discontinued at the end 
of the first volume.
Two parts are out : " the cryptogamic plates are 
very beautiful." 
Of Jaubert and Spach's * Illustrationes Plantarum Orientalium ' 
eight livraisons are published.
Lindenberg's ' Monographia Hepaticarum Generis Plagiochilae ' is 
a work illustrative of a group of Jungermannise having for its type our 
J. asplenioides.
The hair-splitting system seems to have been carried 
to a great length ; for the Editor observes that " the slightest change 
in the fonn of the leaf, the presence or absence or size of a tooth, di- 
rection of the foliage and of the branches, the presence or absence of 
surculi, &c.
&c., all and each are considered tokens of specific dis- 
tinction, without taking into account the influence of soil, exposure 
and climate ; " and by these means the number of species of Plagio- 
chila is increased to ninety-six !
The work is however spoken of in 
terms of praise for the beauty of its figures and the manner in which 
the characters and descriptions are drawn up.
The first volume of Grisebach's 'Spicilegium Florae Rumelicae et 
Bithynicae ' is spoken of as " a most valuable addition to our know- 
ledge of Eastern Botany." A letter fi-om the author explains the plan 
and object of the work.
The first volume of Ledebour's ' Flora Rossica ' is out and extends 
to the end of the Legurainosae.
A notice is given of the plates to the botanical part of the antarctic 
expedition of the Astrolabe and the Zelee, in 1837 â€” 40, under Admi- 
ral d'Urville.
They are highly spoken of.
Kiinze's ' Fairnkrauter ' is a supplement to Schkuhr's admirable 
work bearing the same title.
Six fasciculi are published, and con- 
tain sixty coloured plates of new Ferns, or such as were not figured 
by Schkuhr.
Kiinze's ' Riedgraser ' is in like manner a supplement 
to Schkuhr's work on the Carices.
Three parts contain thirty plates, 
with specific characters and descriptions.
Mr. Bateman's ' Orchidaceae of Guatemala and Mexico,' and Dr.
Lindley's ' Sertum Orchidaceum,' are deservedly spoken of in terms 
of high commendation.
The first No. of Mr. Benthara's ' Botany of the Voyage of H.
M. S.
Sulphur,' has just appeared : it contains ten plates of new species, 
from drawings on stone by Miss Drake.
It " extends as far as Paro- 
nychiaceae of the Californian plants ; " and six quarterly parts will 
probably complete the Botany.
Under the notice of the first part of Sir W.
J. Hooker's ' Species 
4 K 
930 
Filicum,' appear the following remarks on the value of the venation 
in Ferns, which will be interesting to our readers.
"The introduction of the venation into our systematic characters, by no one insisted 
on with more force and truth than by Mr. Brown, is of the utmost importance in sys- 
tematic arrangement, and constitutes a new era in the study of this family of plants ; 
but we are not thence to infer that the slightest variation in the direction, or union, or 
some other circumstance in the veins, is therefore to constitute a mark of generic dis- 
tinction.
The generic importance of the venation is indeed a matter of great difficul- 
ty, and I am far from having the vanity to suppose that T have hit upon the correct 
medium between the placing too little or too much dependence upon the ramification 
of the veins.
In proportion, however, as we advance in our knowledge of the ferns, 
we shall be able to set a more just estimate upon the importance of venation.
The 
subject is yet in its infancy," 
The second part of the work is nearly ready for publication, and 
will contain the continuation of the Dicksonieae, including the beau- 
tiful and delicate genera, Hymenophyllum and Trichomanes.
The first part of the seventh volume of Hooker's ' Genera Planta- 
rum ' contains plates 601 â€” 650, with their descriptions.
It " is rich 
in species from Australia and New Zealand ; and there are many re- 
markable forms among them." 
The forthcoming work on the British Fresh-water Algae, by Mr. A.
H. Hassall is to form one vol.
8vo., with seventy lithographic plates 
executed by the author, being magnified views of all the species of 
" Confervaceae and Diatomaceae hitherto discovered inhabiting the 
soft waters of the British Isles," with an account of the " modes of re- 
production, growth, vitality, distribution, uses, classification and spe- 
cies of this extensive and interesting group of plants." Of the draw- 
ings it is remarked " that they are eminently adapted to illustrate, in 
the most satisfactory manner, the structure and mode of reproduction 
of these curious aquatics." 
On the 8th of February letters arrived from Mr. Drummond, who is 
still engaged in his botanical researches at the Swan River.
The let- 
ter contained " some singular mosses, allied to the Phasca of Europe 
in appearance." The plants which were brought in the same ship 
with the letters had not come to hand when the notice was written.
Mr. Gardner, who left England for Ceylon in September last, has 
been appointed to the charge of the Botanic Gardens at Kandy, va- 
cant by the recent decease of Mr. Normansell.
Mr. Wm.
Gardiner's intention of investigating the botanical trea- 
sures of Braemar was briefly noticed in our last.
Three botanists â€” Mr. C.
A. Geyer, Mr. Liiders and Dr. Lindheimer 
â€” are about to engage in exploring the most interesting portions of 
031 
North-west America ; their collections will be offered to subscribers 
in sets as they come to hand.
Mr. Geyer was undecided as to his 
course and the particular field of his researches when he left St. Louis.
Mr. Liiders expects to spend next winter and perhaps the following 
summer at a Roman-Catholic missionary station on the upper waters 
of Great Snake river.
And Dr. Lindheimer will devote a few years 
to the exploration of Texas.
The former collections of these bota- 
nists are stated by Dr. Gray to be " well selected, very complete and 
finely prepared." 
The second article in the number is a " Description and Figure 
of a new Species of Oxalis from Columbia, by W.
J. H." This new 
species, named O.
Lindsoesefolia, was gathered by Mr. Wm.
Lobb.
It 
is said to be allied to O.
(Biophytum) sensitiva, X., but distinct from 
any hitherto published.
" Description, with a Figure, of Hyobanclie sanguinea, Thunb., hy 
W. H.
Harvey, Esq." This is a curious, fleshy, parasitical plant, the 
only species of the genus, and found on roots of various plants in the 
flats at the Cape of Good Hope, in September and October.
The 
author's figure and description were taken from recent examples.
He 
observes that " the genus is usually placed in Orobanchese, but the 
structure of the ovary is so completely analogous to that of Harveya, 
which Sir W.
J. Hooker has referred to the Scrophularina?, that 1 do 
not see how they can be separated." The author further remarks that 
though the placentas, strictly speaking, are formed from the introflex- 
ed margins of the valves, yet they meet in the centre of the capsule, 
and are there firmly united into a central piece, a line at right angles 
with the dissepiment showing where the surfaces coalesce.
The dis- 
tinctions between parietal and central placentae appear but trifling, 
since, theoretically, all have the same origin ; a central differing from 
a parietal placenta only in the greater degree of inflexion of the mar- 
gins of the carpel.
In the explanation of the plate the plant is called 
H. coccinea.
" Description, with a Figure, of a new species o/" Thuja, the Alerse 
of Chili, by W.
J. H." The tree producing the timber imported from 
the south of Chili, in the form of shingles or planks, under the name 
of Alerse or Alerze, appears to have been hitherto unknown to bota- 
nists.
The author has in his herbarium "a specimen of a Thuja with 
immature fruit, gathered by Captain King in the Straits of Magel- 
haens." On this being shown to Mr. Bridges after his return from 
Chiloe, that gentleman pronounced it to be the true Alerse ; and sub- 
sequently forwarded to the author a barren specimen of the same 
932 
plant, which he had gathered in the mountains near the Bay of Val- 
divia.
Being an apparently undescribed species, the author has nam- 
ed it Thuja tetragona, and has given the character and description in 
the paper under notice.
Captain King has given a full and interest- 
ing account of the Alerse, and its valuable properties as a timber, in 
his ' Voyage of the Adventure and Beagle,' (i.
282) ; which, together 
with the notices added by Captain Fitzroy, are quoted at length in 
the article.
The tree appears to be one of great height and diameter, 
for Captain King states that " spars eighty or ninety feet long may 
be procured, and from eight hundred to one thousand boards are fre- 
quently obtained from a single tree ; I was told even so many as one 
thousand five hundred out of one trunk." The planks are " seven or 
eight feet long, two inches thick, and nine or ten inches wide." The 
straightness of grain enables the natives to split the tree so as to make 
it appear as if " dressed with an adze, or even with a plane," but the 
axe is the only instrument used.
The wood is used chiefly for " the 
floors, partitions and weather-boards of houses, and also for shingling 
the roof," and for the latter purpose it is said to be very durable : it 
neither shrinks nor warps, is close-grained and well adapted for fur- 
niture : staves for casks are also made from it by the country people.
The bark serves to caulk the seams of vessels, and the spars have 
been found peculiarly strong and valuable for the masts.
Captain Fitzroy's account of the mode of obtaining the Merse is 
very interesting.
The natives work in family parties, at what are 
termed Astilleros, where the trees are felled.
Here they work for 
four or five weeks, and then return home to attend to their potato- 
grounds and other domestic affairs, " till their feet heal, and a para- 
lytic motion of the legs, acquired in the Astillero, has ceased," when 
" they return for another cargo, and work till their feet and limbs can 
stand it no longer." To this laborious life children are inured from a 
very early age.
" Enumeration of the Mosses and Hepaticce, collected in Brazil 
hy George Gardner, Esq., drawn up hy Sir W.
J. Hooker, and W.
Wilson, Esq." This list contains one hundred and twenty-six moss- 
es (fourteen of which are described as new species), fourteen Hepaticae 
and nine lichens.

â€” Notice of ' The London Catalogue of British Plants.
Published under the direction of the Botanical Society of Lon- 
don.
Adapted for an Index Catalogue to British Herbaria ; 
933 
for marking Desiderata in Exchanges of Specimens ; for indi- 
cating the Species of local districts ; and for a guide to bota- 
nical collectors, by showing the comparative rarity or frequency 
of the several species.
London : William Paraplin, 46, Frith- 
street, Soho.
1844.
The title of this Catalogue, which we have given at full length, 
will sufficiently explain the objects proposed by the compilers.
It 
may be had either as a large broadside, like the earlier edition of the 
Edinburgh Society's list, or as an 8vo.
pamphlet.
The arrangement 
adopted is that of the natural system ; and the nomenclature, in ge- 
neral, that of the fifth edition of Hooker's ' British Flora.' The spe- 
cies are numbered continuously from 1 to 1428; "that being deemed 
the most convenient method in a Catalogue, designed to be used as 
an Index to herbaria and duplicate stores." For an index to herba- 
ria we have always had a predilection for the plan of numbering the 
genera continuously, and giving a new set of numbers â€” beginning 
with 1 â€” to the species under each genus : but this may be merely a 
matter of opinion.
The list of Salices has been drawn up by the Rev.
J. B.
Leefe ; and the arrangement of the Rubi was entrusted to Mr.
Edwin Lees.
The two gentlemen who have undertaken the arrange- 
ment of the species of these difficult and ill-understood genera, are 
well known to have devoted their attention to this particular subject 
for many years past.
A list of about a hundred species is given, be- 
ing such as are considered " either scai'cely naturalised, or not re- 
cently found in the localities indicated for them : " and the names of 
"introduced species, now more or less naturalised, are printed mita- 
lics." The number of species &c.
is thus summed up : â€” 
Indigenous Species, 1305 
Naturalized Species, 132

From the numerous enquiries which have been addressed to us re- 
specting a list of plants arranged on the natural system, we have but 
little doubt that the London Catalogue will attain a wide circulation 
among British botanists, without at all interfering with any of its pre- 
decessors, which may have been arranged on a different plan.

Note on Hieraciiim maculatum.
In your last number (Phy- 
tol.
804) Mr. Watson alludes to the luxuriant specimens of Hieracium 
maculatum in Smith's herbarium as being the effect of cultivation ; I 
have several specimens of the plant collected from the top of the wall 
of our yard, which are equal to the largest size mentioned in 'English 
Flora.' There has been a good crop of them every summer, and the 
general height is from two to three feet.
I have not seen any under 
that size when full grown, except some plants that have vegetated in 
the joints of the stones on the face of the wall, where there was not 
enough soil to nourish them, and consequently their smaller size may 
be easily ascribed to starvation.
I gathered some specimens from the 
joints full two feet high ; they had in general from five to seven leaves 
on the stem before they branched ; the flowers numbered from about 
eighteen or twenty to nearly forty in some of the largest plants, be- 
sides numbers of buds not much larger than large pin-heads.
The 
soil in which they grew consisted chiefly of decayed mortar.
The 
wall in question is exposed to the full force of the summer's sun for 
the whole day, so that the plant must be able to grow in extremely 
dry situations, since it grew so luxuriantly there.
I think that a great 
many discrepancies in statements of the mode of flowering, and also 
of the number of flowers, arise fi-om not taking notice at what period 
the specimens described are gathered.
I think if the state of the cen- 
tral flower w^ere mentioned, in connexion with the number of flowers, 
it would be much more exact.
I have generally found that when the 
central flower was fully expanded, the flowers and buds were gene- 
rally about twenty in number ; when the central flower had its seeds 
about ripe, as shown by the white down being conspicuous, there 
were from twenty-four to thirty; when the central flower had dispersed 
its seeds, they ranged nearer forty.
The radical leaves were all de- 
cayed at the time the plant was in flower ; but though withered, they 
were easily seen to accord with the description in ' English Flora.' 
The only discrepancy exhibited was in the arrangement of the floral 
branches.
Smith says " stem cymose^'' " flower-stalks â€” form an ir- 
reo-ular, sometimes compound, cymose panicle ; " in the specimens I 
examined there was not one truly cymose, as explained in his ' Intro- 
duction,' where he defines a cyme â€” " its common stalks all spring 
from one centre," â€” but rather according with his description of H.
935 
pnlmonaiium, â€” " the first partial stalk remaining always much lower 
than the rest," the central flower above mentioned being always over- 
topped by the upper floral branches.
Another character Smith does 
not allude to, is the gradual change of the leaves from the " radical 
ones on long hairy footstalks," to the " scattered linear hairy brac- 
teas." I have called those leaves stem-leaves below the first floral 
branch, but some of those at the base of other floral branches may al- 
so be called stem-leaves, not having departed from the dentated out- 
line of the lower leaves, although much narrower.
As to the question 
of its being a species distinct from H.
sylvaticum, with which it is 
united in the Edinburgh Catalogue, I do not consider myself compe- 
tent to offer an opinion.

Note on OrnitJwpus perpusillus?
I was puzzled in the sum- 
mer of 1842, wdth a small leguminous plant that I found on the top of 
one of our mountains, and which I could not then make out.
It was 
not above an inch high in the highest part of it, and all its flowers and 
legumes were in pairs.
I brought a sod of it home, containing about 
half-a-dozen plants.
I earnestly watched them (until they were kill- 
ed by the frosts of winter) both blossoming and seeding, but they did 
not deviate from their former size and appearance.
The above plant 
[Ornithopus perpusillus] was the nearest I could find whose descrip- 
tion partially agreed with my humble protege.
This past suunner I 
determined to test it again; I accordingly sowed some of the seeds in 
February, March and April, in some old flower-pots.
One of the 
seeds vegetated in about three weeks, the others were from six to ten 
weeks before they threw up their husks.
Some of them had not pro- 
duced any flowers when they fell under the harshness of the weather 
in the present week.
Some of the smallest had leaves and stems 
about an inch and a half high ; others had the leaves three inches 
and stems from three to six inches long: one plant in particular threw 
up a single stem nearly fifteen inches long : but they all produced 
flowers and legumes in pairs, except two heads, one of which had 
three flowers and the other five, but they were both unfiuitful not pro- 
ducing one legume in either head.
From the luxuriant growth ol 
some of the plants, I now suspect that it is a variety of O.
perpusillus.

Note on Campanulas.
During the two last summers having 
gathered a few plants of some of the few-flowered species when nearly 
flowering, and transplanted them into some flower-pots for the pur- 
pose of observing whether the spreading or closing of the sepals was 
constant in the same plant j â€” I observed the following peculiarity in 
936 
their flowering, but do not know whether it has been previously no- 
ticed or not.
After the flower opens, and before the pollen is ripe, the 
position of the flower changes from pendant or drooping to nearly up- 
right, or so much so as to permit the sun's rays to penetrate to the 
bottom of the flower : when the pollen is ripe and ready to be scat- 
tered, the flower then resumes its original position.
Whether this is 
efliected by the twisting of the peduncle, or by reversing the natural 
curve, I did not observe.
The upper part of the peduncle during that 
period always presented a sigmoid flexure.
With regard to the prin- 
cipal object of my attention, the spreading or closing of the calyx- 
segments, I think they ought to be observed more than they have hi- 
therto been, as I suspect the spreading of their segments may be of 
use in determining nearly-allied species, as I have observed a con- 
slant difierence in the whole contour of the flower accompanying the 
different position of the sepals.

Note on the Equiseta.
I am very much pleased to find that 
Mr. Newman has paid attention to the different appearances of the 
section of the different species ; as I have always suspected that if 
fully pursued through all our species, they would very much assist in 
their discrimination.
The descriptions would have been more pei'fect 
had it been stated how the tubular passages increase in number from 
the root upwards.
In E.
Telmateia particularly they increase from 
about six or eight in the lowest internodes, regularly with every joint, 
they become too numerous and too minute to be counted with the un- 
assisted eye.
As they increase in number they decrease in size, while 
the stem does not decrease.

Note on the effects of the late mild winter.
On Christmas- 
eve and Christmas-day I heard both the thrush and robin singing â€” 
one proof out of the many afforded of the unusual mildness of the sea- 
son, which continued indeed until the end of January; since then we 
have had a long visit from the three winter graces â€” frost, snow and 
ice.
In the Christmas week I saw a Fuchsia in full blossom in a gar- 
den eighteen miles North-east of York : it was unprotected from the 
weather, but was on the south side of the house.
In my own garden, 
twelve miles North-east of York, I had strawberries in blossom, but 
for want, I suppose, of the warmer rays of the sun they were of a din- 
gy yellow colour, instead of white.
In a garden at York I saw a lilac- 
tree fast bursting into leaf; and in all parts of the country the same 
mild season seems to have prevailed to a degree unexampled in the 
memory of that exceedingly long-lived person â€” "the oldest inhabi- 
tant." â€” F.

On Jungermannia Francisci and J.
byssacea.
At the sugges- 
tion of a correspondent, whom I have been the means of leading into 
error concerning these two species, I willingly acknowledge that I 
have not properly understood them, until my friend Mr. Spruce sup- 
plied me with genuine examples of J.
Francisci, a species which I 
have never gathered.
I must therefore request all my correspondents 
who have received from me specimens named "J.
Francisci," to sub- 
stitlite the name "J.
byssacea." In extenuation of the mistake which 
I have thus committed, let me remark that in the monograph by Sir 
W. J.
Hooker, J.
bifida of Schmidel is twice cited, once under J.
bys- 
sacea, t.
12, and again, doubtfully, under J.
Francisci, t.
49, where will 
be found also the following observation: â€” "In habit J.
Francisci cer- 
tainly approaches J.
byssacea, but the uj)right growth of the surculi, 
and the more concave and less deeply notched leaves are of them- 
selves sufiicient marks of discrimination ; and when the presence of 
the stipules is taken into consideration, no difficulty in distinguishing 
them will be found to occur." Now the fact is, that although J.
bys- 
sacea does sometimes present itself with stipules so very obscure as 
to escape the ordinary means of detection (in which state I have never 
failed to recognise it as J.
byssacea), there are numerous cases where 
the stipules are quite obvious (as in specimens gathered by Mr.
Cruickshank near Dumfries, and in my own specimens gathered on 
Delamere-forest and elsewhere), so that there can be no doubt that J.
byssacea ought to be placed in that section of the genus which is 
possessed of stipules.
I have long suspected the stipule-bearing plant 
was not essentially distinct from .J. byssacea, but while I was ignorant 
of the true J.
Francisci, I naturally referred it to that species.
It now 
remains to ascertain whether our J.
byssacea is the species so called 
by Roth.
On Delamere-forest, Cheshire, I have seen it growing on 
blocks of sandstone, in small, compact, rounded tufts, the surculi be- 
ing of course erect, and bearing very evident stipules.

On the parasitism of Orobanche.
While in Wales last sum- 
mer, I obtained very satisfactory evidence of the parasitical habit of 
Orobanche major and O.
barbata.
As regards the latter species, there 
is already a correct representation (as far as it goes) given at tab.
2859 
of the ' Supplement to English Botany;' but as nothing is stated in 
the description beyond the mere fact of parasitism, I may be pardoned 
for presenting the readers of ' The Phytologist ' with the result of my 
own observations, which were made independently of what had been 
4 L 
938 
done by others.
Of all cases of parasitism by means of roots, none 
are more striking than those which occur in Orobanche, inasmuch as 
the parasite does not attach itself laterally, but at the very extremity 
of a root of the nutrient plant ; O.
barbata seizing upon the roots of 
ivy, while O.
major attaches itself to the roots of Ulex europseus.
In 
the latter case, the root of Ulex becomes very much swelled at the 
point of contact j a longitudinal section of it and of the scaly rhizoma 
of the Orobanche, presented the appearance of such complete union 
of the cellular tissue of both plants, that the exact line of junction 
could not be absolutely determined; and it seemed as if even the vas- 
cular tissue of the two plants had become intimately blended ; the 
base of the rhizoma of the Orobanche being continuous with the root 
of the Ulex, It is difficult to comprehend in what way the seeds of 
Orobanche are brought into contact with the roots of its prey, unless 
it be by the agency of earthworms or slugs.
Perhaps some one who has 
facilities for the purpose, will undertake to study the germination of 
these plants, for the benefit of the readers of ' The Phytologist.' â€” Id.

Note on Villarsia nymph<Boides^ (Phytol.
904).* The Villar- 
sia nymphajoides is met with in an old deserted bed of the Clyde below 
Govan, on the north side of the river, and in the dam very abundant- 
ly between Partrick and Govan-ferry, immediately west of York-hill, 
where it has been abundantly found in both places for more than 
twenty years; but I remember well its introduction.
At a time when 
we were cleaning out the pond in the old Botanic Garden, I filled my 
specimen-box with it, and going at the time to the Highlands, I emp- 
tied it out in both these places before going on board the steam-boat 
at Govan-ferry.
I also put in some of the Stratiotes and Nuphar lu- 
tea, both of which continue to exist, although they have not spread 
like the other.
Thirty-five years ago the Rev. Mr.
M'Ritchie, of the 
parish of Cluney (Perthshire), introduced the Villarsia into the Loch 
of Cluney, and it has spread over several acres of its surface.
We 
put a good many plants into the Kelvin three years ago ; and last 
summer it made some appearance opposite the garden.

Effect of cultivation on Hyacinthus non-scriptus, Linn.
When 
this plant is taken from its native woods, and planted in an ordinary 
flower-bed, I have reason to believe that the following changes take 
place in its habit and characters; namely, the inflorescence ceases to 
be either secund or drooping, and the flowers become more widely 
* Communicated by Professor Balfour.

campanulate.
I have nowhere read any notice of this change, nor am 
I aware either of the length of time required to produce it, or if it be 
a uniform result.
The observations on which my remarks are found- 
ed, having been made many years since, and not being in all points 
perfectly conclusive, I am now on the point of renewing them, and 
my reason for bringing the subject before the readers of ' The Phyto- 
logist' at this time, instead of waiting until T have made the experi- 
ment, is, that others may try it as well as myself My own intention 
is to obtain some of the roots from a wood some time during the next 
fortnight, and plant them in various aspects of my garden, and in soils 
of different kind; and 1 should recommend others who make the ex- 
periment, to vary it in the same manner.
I should also advise their 
obtaining the bulbs immediately on reading this note, as it will very 
soon be too late for removing the roots in time for this year's flower- 
ing.â€” T.

Note on the arrangement of Mosses for the Herharium.
The 
plan mentioned by Mr. Townsend in your last number (Phvtol.
901) 
of arranging mosses by glueing all the specimens to the paper, is verv 
little used 1 think by any one who attempts to studij tliat tribe of 
plants ; for no modern muscologist would be satisfied with the exa- 
mination of a moss when so fastened down, however white and trans- 
parent the paper may be ; nor am I aware of any one who aims at 
investigating them by putting his herbarium-sheets under the micro- 
scope.
The plan of keeping mosses loose in cases or pockets, is cer- 
tainly a step in advance of the above ; but the most desirable method 
is perhaps found in combining the two : this is productive of a greater 
degree of neatness, and offers better facilities for reference.
Speci- 
mens in various stages of growth, and from different localities, may be 
glued down so as to present at a glance the general outline and pro- 
minent characters of a species ; while two small cases or pockets 
should also be attached to the paper, one containing loose specimens 
for minute examination, the other dissections of the peristome &c.
mounted between layers of talc for the microscope.
It is very useful 
to have a small book containing a specimen or two of each species, 
either glued down or enclosed in similar cases, to carry in the pocket 
for reference, when the principal collection may not be at hand.

Alectoria jiibata.
I have much pleasure in communicating 
that my hope is already realized of being able to supply my subscrib- 
ers to this season's botanical distribution, with specimens of Alectoria 
jubata bearing true fructification, (Phytol.
918).
This interesting 
940 
rarity I collected in Deerhill-wood, on the 5th of March, whilst wad- 
ing above knee-deep in snow !
The day was fair and frosty, and the 
hard surface of the snow on the roads tempted me to the enjoyment of 
the walk ; and being desirous of a peep into the woods, to mark the 
difference of their wintry aspect from that of the genial summer, when 
every tree is loaded with verdure, and alive with the music of birds, I 
prolonged my walk to the base of the Sidlaws, and entered the wood- 
lands.
The scene was bleak and cheerless.
The young leaves were 
yet cradled in their buds.
The breeze indeed was there, but its soft- 
ness was wanting, and no breath of sweet flowers nor song of happy 
birds, did it diffuse around, as it sullenly moaned through the dark 
pines.
Even the mossy carpet was wanting, as snow covered the 
ground to the depth of several feet, which, being here quite soft, ren- 
dered it necessary to wade instead of walk, and consequently made 
one's progress slow and fatiguing.
Yet even here, in the midst of win- 
ter's sterility, the lover of Flora could enjoy a rich banquet, for the 
trees are in many places profusely decorated with Lichens.
Besides 
the Alectoria I have here collected the following species, all in fruc- 
tification, although on some of them the apothecia were but sparingly 
developed.
Usnea barbata, U.
florida, Cetraria glauca, C.
sepincola, 
Borrera furfuracea, Parmelia physodes, Evernia prunastri and Rama- 
lina fastigiata.

F.L.S., Z.S., &c.
London : Van Voorst, 1844.
Lomaria spicant.
We scarcely know a paragraph more replete with truth than that 
selected by the author for his motto.
" Monographers, come from 
whence they may, have, I think, fair pretence to challenge some re- 
gard and approbation fi-om the lovers of Natural History ; for as no 
man can alone investigate all the works of Nature, these partial writers 
may, each in their department, be more accurate in their discoveries, 
and freer from errors than more general writers, and so by degrees 
4 M 
946 
may pave the way to an universal correct Natural History."* If this be 
true (and who shall gainsay it ?) how true also is the converse of the 
proposition !
â€” General writers, come from whence they may, have 
slight pretence to challenge regard and approbation from the lovers of 
Natural History : for as no man can alone investigate all the works 
of Nature, these general writers must be less accurate in their disco- 
veries, and less free from errors than more partial writers, and so by 
degrees they introduce manifold eiTors into Natural History.
With- 
out making any attempt to criticise the works of our masters in the 
science, and confining our attention entirely to living authors, we 
may, without hesitation, give the unqualified precedence to mono- 
graphers.
We may safely assert that we know of no botanist who 
combines writing much with writing well.
In the field the author has chosen for his labours, he may be said 
to have no competitor ; it is true, there are two other works treating 
precisely on the same subject, but one of these, Bolton's ' Filices,' 
has long been out of print, and the other, Francis' ' Analysis,' rather 
brings into one point of view our knowledge of ferns as derived fi'om 
Sir J.
E. Smith, Sir W.
J. Hooker, and Mr. Mackay, than supplies 
us with a well digested history of that beautiful tribe.
The classification of ferns has lately received great assistance fi-om 
the application of a character either overlooked or neglected by all 
the older botanical writers ; we allude to the venation.
Presl on the 
continent, and Mr. John Smith in this country, have taken the lead 
in bringing this valuable character into notice ; and the result of its 
application seems rather to illustrate the value of the Linnean group- 
ing of these plants, than detract fi*om its utility or interfere with its 
detail, while, at the same time, it must be acknowledged, it decidedly 
discomposes the labours of Sir J.
E. Smith, and induces a smile at 
the very complacent manner in which he congratulates himself on the 
perfection of his own performances.f 
In classification, our author is decidedly a pupil of the modern 
school, without, however, being a servile follower of its able found- 
ers.
He works with their characters, but does not always attain the 
same results.
Consequently, his nomenclature is toto coelo at vari- 
ance with that so long in general use.
On the first promulgation of 
his views on this subject, in 1839-40, there was a general denuncia- 
* Gilbert White, 
f See the introductory ohservations to the Cryptogamia Filices in the 4th volume 
of the ' English Flora.' 
947 
tion of changes so radical and complete ; but Mr. John Smith's paper 
on the same subject, read almost immediately afterwards at the Lin- 
nean Society, and perhaps the most profound and useful treatise 
ever presented to that body, obtained a hearing and a respect which 
was denied to Mr. Newman as an unknown botanist.
We believe this 
is always the case ; great changes, to ensure prompt attention and re- 
spect must be introduced by great men, by men of established repu- 
tation ; or they fail of the desired object.
Such was very decidedly 
the case as regards our author ; and botanists, who one month pro- 
claimed the absurdity of Mr. Newman's innovations, were seen the 
following month bending the supple knee to the same innovations, 
when sanctioned by the European reputation of Mr. Smith.
Soon 
after this confirmation of Mr. Newman's views.
Dr. Balfour and JNIr.
Babington, the authors of the Edinburgh Catalogue, adopted the al- 
terations, and were the means of disseminating them from John o' 
Groat's to the Laud's End. But, in the midst of its successful career, 
the new nomenclature met a most decided check in the publication of 
the fifth edition of Sir W.
Hooker s ' British Flora,' wherein we were 
astonished to find the changes introduced by Mr. Newman, not only 
fathered upon the authors of the Edinburgh Catalogue, but the new 
names given as synonymes, and the old nomenclature restored in all 
its glory.
The ' British Flora ' was almost immediately followed by 
Mr. Babington's Manual, and very recently by the list of the Botani- 
cal Society of London, principally from the pen of that accomplished 
botanist, Mr. Watson; and both these authors adopt Mr. Newman's 
nomenclature.
It would be idle for us to deny the weight and autho- 
rity of a name like Sir W.
Hooker's, and we do not hesitate to express 
our belief that it will have great influence in retarding the adoption 
of the altered nomenclature of ferns ; but only of retarding it : the 
time has now arrived when each successive author enquires for him- 
self, when he takes little or nothing for granted, and without pinning 
his faith on the sleeve of an individual write)-, ventures to con- 
sult the works of Ray, * Schkuhr, Kunze, Svvartz, Weiss, Presl, 
Schott, Dietrich, Decandolle, Roth, Wahlenberg, Weber, Hoffmann, 
&c., and to form a judgment of his own.
This being the case, we are 
willing to abide the issue ; and confidently hope eventually to see 
that nomenclature adopted which possesses the greatest intrinsic 
*No man can form a just estimate of what is due to each classification of ferns, 
without going back even to Ray, whose ' Methodus Plantarum ' contains the draft of 
the system, which, under Sir J.
E. Smith, Swartz and Willdenow, subsequently be- 
came so famous.

merit, combined with the claim of priority, without reference to the 
reputation of one author or the obscurity of another.
In the synopsis with which the author commences his ' History,' 
there is evinced a total disregard of established notions ; but in the 
History itself, this disregard is kept more under control, and large 
concessions are made to what the author evidently regards as received 
errors.
Thus, the artificial genus Polypodium is preserved in the 
History, but the species are separated in the synopsis : the names of 
Polypodium calcareum and Hymenophyllum Wilsoni are given in the 
History, the prior and original names of Polypodium robertianum 
[Hoffmann) and Hymenophyllum unilaterale [Willdenow) in the sy- 
nopsis.
These and numerous other instances of attempted concilia- 
tion, of noticing without reforming the manifold errors which have so 
long been perpetuated through the most gross carelessness and inat- 
tention, were, in our opinion, uncalled for ; and we think the author 
would have done better to revert at once to what he considered the 
correct nomenclature, even though every name employed by Sir J.
E. 
Smith had been thereby obliterated from the catalogue of British 
ferns.
The number of errors into which Sir J.
E. Smith has fallen, 
exceeds all belief ; and some of them appear inexplicable.
Knowing 
how intimately Sir James was acquainted with the works of Roth and 
Hoffmann, seeing how constantly he quotes them throughout his de- 
scriptions of the ferns, it seems scarcely credible that in two instan- 
ces at least he should have renamed ferns which they had carefully 
described, and have given them to the world as altogether new ; and 
that in another instance he should have described one fern under three 
names, dwelling on differences which had no existence.
The axiom, 
de mortuis nil nisi honum, was doubtless conceived in love, and is 
worthy of general acceptation ; but we deny that the grave should be 
made thus to consecrate error, thereby conferring an injury both on 
the dead and the living, robbing those who are departed of their just 
reputation, and diverting the living student from the paths of truth.
The arrangement adopted in Mr. Newman's ' History,' is not cha- 
racterised by much novelty.
The divisions are these.
1. Equisetacecd.
2. AdianiacecB, including Adiantum, Lomaria and Pteris.
3. PolypodiacecB, including Allosorus, Polypodium and Woodsia.
4. Aspidiacece, including Cystopteris, Polystichum and Lastra^a.
5. AspleniacecB, including Athyrium, Asplenium, Scolopendrium 
and Ceterach.
0. HijmenophyUacea;, including Trichomanes and Hymenophyllum.
949 
7. Osmundacece, Osmunda only.
8. OphioglossacecB, including Botrychium and Ophioglossuni.
9. LycopodiacecE, including Lycopodium and Isoctes.
10.
MarsiliacecBy Pilularia only.
Woodsia alpiiia 
It were almost an insult to the understandings of our fellow-labour- 
ers in the field of botanical science, to consider it necessary to point 
out to them that these divisions, by whatever name they may be call- 
ed, are of very unequal value.
Thus, while the line between the Po- 
lypodiacesB and Aspidiaceae is almost incapable of definition, that 
between Equisetaceae and all the rest is so manifest, as to have led 
some modern botanists to disconnect them fi-om the cryptogamous 
and place them among phaenogamous plants.
These discrepancies 
might furnish the hypercritic with a fruitful theme, and the introduc- 
tory synopsis might even be employed as aff"ording the weaj^ons of 
attack.

1. Equisetacea.
These have been so recently described in the pa- 
ges of ' The Phytologist,' that there has been Httle time or opportu- 
nity for alteration or addition ; but we may notice that a further guide 
to the detection of species is afforded in the careful figures of trans- 
verse sections of the stem of each.
2. AdiantacecB.
In this group we invite attention to the detailed 
description of the fructification of Pteris.
It seems rather extraordi- 
nary that although Mr. Newman's views upon this subject have been 
four years before the public, that they have been allowed to pass un- 
noticed by Sir W.
Hooker and Mr. Babington, both of whom, in their 
subsequently published works, revert to the old, and, as we consider, 
totally erroneous description.
This question remains an open one ; 
but we are unable to resist the conviction, that Mr. Newman's solu- 
tion, backed as we find it by the careful observations of Mr. Wilson 
and Mr. Jenner, is the correct one : the passage is too long to trans- 
fer to our pages, and we have already cited (Phytol.
836) a compressed 
description of the genus fi'om the ' Naturalists' Almanack.' 
3. PolypodiacecB, In this group we have to mention the restoration 
of Bolton's original name of alpina to the Woodsia hyperborea of 
Swartz.
On the preceding page we have introduced Mr. Newman's 
portraiture of this pretty little fern.
4. AspidiacecB.
Under this division the dilatata question is gravely 
discussed, and, as we think, satisfactorily settled.
The author begins 
with this candid admission of his former erroneous opinions.
" On looking more carefully into those similarities which I supposed of sufficient 
importance to warrant the association of many forms under the specific nam-e of dila- 
tata 1 find them invariably the concomitants of youth rather than the characteristics 
of perfection, and they become by degrees more and more obliterated, as the plants 
year by year advance towards maturity.
The differences, on the other hand, so equi- 
vocally developed in seedling or starved individuals, become distinctly pronounced in 
the adult and vigorous ; and a comparison of these, leaves me no choice but to cancel 
my former observations as erroneous, and to consider the names dilatata and spinulosa 
as having been applied to a family rather than to a species.
Admitting this, it be- 
comes a task of great delicacy to select an individual which shall bear alone all the 
honors of either patronymic.
Fully appreciating the difficulty of the case, I have 
omitted both these names, and employed others which were originally, as now, restrict- 
ed to one species." â€” p.
208.
Three species are then carefully and fully described, under the 
names of Lastrsea spinosa, L.
multiflora and L.
recurva ; the descrip- 
tions occupying twenty-seven pages, and being accompanied by nu- 
merous figures illustrating the circumscription of frond, the form of 
involucre, and the character of the scales.
All the three appear to 
951 
be most abundant species ; together they constitute the Polypodium 
cristatum of Hudson, the Aspidium dilatatura of Smith and Babing- 
ton, and the Aspidium spinulosum of Hooker.
It will doubtless be 
objected, by some of our readers, that the old names should have 
been retained in preference to those with which we are comparatively 
unacquainted.
On this point we are disposed to join issue : we sub- 
mit that it is impossible to decide, from a Latin description of two or 
three lines, which of these species was the spinulosum of Mliller or 
the dilatatum of Hoffmann; and we think Mr. Newman has done per- 
fectly right in adopting for each the earliest name which combines the 
two postulates of being accompanied by an intelligible description, 
and of being confined to a single species.
This practice is some- 
what stringent perhaps, but it is certainly wholesome.
On the two 
next pages we introduce figures of Lastraea multiflora and L.
recurva 
as the two species which possess the greatest claim to be considered 
additions to the British Flora.
Circumscription of frond is a point 
strenuously insisted on by the author, as separating these species ; 
since, however it may approach in young specimens, it recedes in those 
which are mature : but add to this that the involucres, the scales, the 
glands, the scent, the venation, the form of pinnules (in one convex 
in the other concave), are all widely and unvaryingly different, he in- 
deed were a bold man who, after going into such a mass of evidence, 
shall utterly reject the inferences, and again blend these two species 
with the third (L.
spinosa) under a single name.
We must not, how- 
ever, be understood as expressing any decided opinion that Mr. New- 
man's species will be generally or rapidly adopted.
We are too well 
acquainted with the disinclination there is to adopt the views of a 
new man (the pun is quite unintentional) â€” to enter on the difficult task 
of careful collation and examination, except under the banner of au- 
thority : it is only by degrees, and through the exercise of the most 
perfect candour, that conviction will reach the mind of the enquiring 
botanist.
With regard to the species which we hold as the most important 
addition to our Flora â€” Lastraea recurva â€” Mr. Newman has already 
strong opponents, as will appear from the following paragraph.
" When I first saw this beautiful fern in the North of Ireland, I was in company 
with Mr. William Bennett, and I instantly pronounced it a species new to Britain.
I 
traced it in many of the Irish counties with the same feeling of certainty ; and it was 
only in deference to the judgment of three distinguished botanists, the late Professor 
Don, Mr. Moore of Dublin, and Mr. Babington of Cambridge, that I at last aban- 
doned ray opinion, and consented to give the species as a variety of dilatata.
Profes- 
952 
Xastrsea multiflora.
sor Don, althougli he had frequent opportunities of consulting my somewhat ample 
materials on the subject, never in any degree wavered from his first opinion ; and Mr.
Moore and Mr. Babington, who have enjoyed the best possible opportunities of form- 
ing an accurate decision, having seen it growing in all states and in an infinite variety 
953 
Lastraea recurva.
of Stations, still consider it a mere form of Last, dilatata.
The testimony of Sir W.
Hooker I have already adduced.
In adding another species to our list of British ferns, 
I think it but a matter of justice to my readers to show that I stand opposed to four of 
our most distinguished botanists.
On the other hand, it is no little consolation that I 
954 
am able to announce tlie judgment of Messrs.
Bree, Borrer and Jenner, as correspond- 
ing with my own." â€” p.
233.
The characters by which these ferns are to be distinguished, have 
ah-eady appeared in the pages of ' The Phytologist,' in our notice of 
the ' Naturalist's Almanack,' (Phytol.
837) ; the only alteration to 
which we have to invite the attention of botanists, is the substitution 
of the name oi multijlora for that of dilatata.
5. Aspleniacea.
Under Athyrium Filix-femina, the author com- 
prehends five of Roth's species, without expressing any very decided 
opinion on the subject of their value.
His views may be gathered 
from the following passage.
" By retaining all these forms under the name of Filix-femina, in accordance with 
the views of Decandolle, Sadler, Hooker and Babington, I rather bow to the views of 
these eminent botanists than follow any of my own.
It seems to me that three at least 
of the forms described by Roth, those adopted in the ' Naturalists' Almanack,' have 
the habit and appearance of species ; but at the same time I cannot say that the grounds 
of separation adduced by Roth appear to me satisfactory : neither the scales, involu- 
cres, nor position of the clusters of capsules, are adduced as evidence ; and surely, 
before adopting the species, we must learn whether these are dissimilar or identical.
Roth is entitled to great praise for what he has done, but it is left for others to earn 
still greater praise by adducing real diagnostics to corroborate his views." â€” p.
247.
The question is perhaps one of the most difficult in the study of our 
British ferns.
It appears that two of the most acute discriminators of 
specific diff'erences insist on these plants being entitled to the rank of 
species ; while others, whose names stand equally high, dismiss them 
as totally unworthy of mention, even as varieties : the latter view is 
adopted by British botanists, and seems to us uncourteous in the ex- 
treme.
How can we in fairness object to the course occasionally pur- 
sued on the continent, of neglecting names imposed in Great Britain, 
in order that later continental names may be substituted, while we are 
deliberately and designedly neglecting the labours of a man like Roth, 
whose extreme carefulness is a pattern to us all .?
After Athyrium Filix-femina, Asplenium fontanum, or perhaps more 
correctly, A.
Halleri, should have followed in course, but the author 
omits it altogether, and passes on to A.
lanceolatum.
It is, perhaps, 
not generally known to what chance we are indebted for this fern in 
the list of British plants ; the following particulars may interest some 
of our readers.
Hudson, in his ' Flora Anglica,' gives Polijpodium 
fontanum with the following habitat : " Habitat in muris antiquis et 
rupibus.
supra Hammersham Church, D.
Bradney ; in locis saxosis 
prope Wybourn in Westmorlandia." Now if we study Hudson's 
955 
mode of giving habitats, and his general accuracy as to counties, we 
may translate the passage thus : Habitat old walls and rocks above 
Hammersham Church, (authority) Mr. Bradney ; and stony places 
about Wyboum, both in Westmoreland." The word both of course 
is not in the Latin, but the plan of Hudson's work warrants its inser- 
tion.
Withering translates the passage fairly and literally, but other 
authors do not deserve the like praise.
Sir J.
E. Smith gives it thus, 
" On Amersham or, Agraondesham, church, Bucks, found by a Mr.
Bradney, according to Hudson." This translation, it will be seen, is 
totally at variance with the original.
We do not consider ourselves 
called on to pursue the subject further than to say that we cordially 
approve of the omission of Asplenium fontanum from the catalogue of 
British ferns.
Asplenium Adiantum-nigrum affords an instance of three conti- 
nental being blended in one British species ; and we again have to 
censure the unfairness or carelessness which has been instrumental to 
the result.
We do not urge the adoption of all the species, but we 
urge the necessity of a dispassionate enquiry, and the expression of a 
candid opinion as to their value.
We cite the descriptions from Sadler, 
as quoted in Mr. Newman's Appendix.

Trichomanes speciosum.
Although four years 
have now elapsed, it will be fresh in the recollection of many of our 
readers, how strenuously the author urged the adoption of the name 
speciosum in preference to that of hrevisetum ; how the world of Bri- 
tish botanists was almost to a man arrayed against him ; how it was 
held to be impossible either that a tropical plant should exist in Ire- 
land, or that, so existing, Robert Brown should have overlooked the 
fact.
It has come within the compass of our knowledge, that the dar- 
ing alteration was repeatedly pointed out as a proof of our author's 
want of information and want of ability to grapple with the subject of 
nomenclature.
What has now become of the name brevisetum ?
There is but one instance of its being retained ; we allude to the 5th 
edition of Hooker's ' British Flora : ' and here we find the name bre- 
visetum restored, and that of speciosum degraded to the rank of a sy- 
nonyme ; not as the speciosum of Willdenow â€” not as the speciosum 
of Mr. Newman, who pointed out its identity with Willdenow's plant, 
but of the Edinburgh Catalogue; and yet the authors of that Catalogue 
merely adopt Mr. Newman's views, as is candidly admitted by Mr.
Babington himself.
We turn to a pleasanter subject, the discovery of a new form, if not 
species, of Trichomanes ; one so distinct that Mr. Smith supposes it 
to be the Trich.
radicans of Swartz.
Mr. Mackay's specimens now be- 
fore us, are so labelled on Mr. Smith's authority ; but surely this has 
been done somewhat too hastily, for in all the specimens of T.
radi- 
cans we have seen, the frond is perfectly sessile, whereas in all the 
Irish specimens it is distinctly stipitate.
Mr. Newman has, we think, 
exercised a sound discretion in keeping the name of radicans quite 
out of view.
Whether or not the new plant could by possibility be 
the true T.
radicans; whether the Killarney plant was really distinct, 
and whether, if not distinct, Swartz's name should not be applied to 
both ; are questions which were agitated for months without any sa- 
tisfactory result.
The author, after citing the published notices of 
this interesting plant, thus continues.
" Mr. Andrews has obligingly furnished me with the following characters of the 
two plants.
The first I will call Trichomanes speciosum, var.
Andrewsii.
" ' Trichomanes ?

Rachis winged,

Receptacles two or three times longer than the involucra.
Root thick densely 
tomentose.
Habitat, Turk, Killarney ; Glouin Caragh ; Mount Eagle, Kerry.' 
" Mr. Andrews further observes, that ' the striking character of the Glouin Caragh 
plant is the amazing length of the receptacles, which, in the growing state of the plant, 
turn up from the involucra in a curved manner [see figure a on the preceding page] show- 
ing a most bristly appearance over the entire frond : all the fronds presented the lan- 
ceolate character, the lower pinnae being distant and short ; the ultimate segments of 
all the pinnae are serrated, the pinnules being decurrent and running to a point ; the 
entire length of the frond was sixteen inches, and from the base of the lowest pinnae to 
the apex of the frond eleven inches.' 
" In opposition to the views expressed by these three eminent botanists, I will cite 
that of Mr. Moore, who says, ' I think the new Trichomanes to be nothing more than 
the old plant fully developed, and more attenuated in all its parts, and that this is 
caused by the dark warm habitat in which it grew.
In order to prove whether the old 
plant could not be altered by being subjected to a different kind of treatment, I had a 
good healthy pot placed under the stage of a green-house, where it got very little light, 
and over the glass a piece of old carpet was thrown which was kept constantly satu- 
rated with water, so that I considered the plant placed nearly in a similar position to 
that in which the new plant was found, I soon found that the fronds might be length- 
ened to an almost incredible extent, and that they became more simple in their 
appearance ; in both these respects well agreeing with the plant discovered by Mr.
Andrews.' No fruit has been produced, so that it remains a question whether the re- 
ceptacle also can be elongated by this treatment.
Mr. Ogilby, of Dublin, whose name 
I have before mentioned as a kind contributor of specimens, seems quite to coincide 
in Mr. Moore's view of the case.
" In accordance with the views previously urged, when describing Cystopteris fra- 
gilis and Lastraea multiflora, I have endeavoured to compare the most mature and per- 
fect fronds from each locality, and the result appears to be 1st, â€” that the specimens 
from Glouin Caragh are far more mature and fruitful than those from Killarney : it is 
a rare thing to obtain specimens from the latter station in a thoroughly mature state ; 
I think I may say that not one frond in fifty exhibits involucres, and not one in many 
hundreds attains the perfect development and fruitfulness displayed by the Glouin 
Caragh plant: but 2ndly â€” I find that the most mature of the Killarney specimens 
most recede from the Glouin Caragh specimens, a circumstance rather opposed to the 
supposition that the two are identical, since in general we find ferns developing their 
specific diflferences more strikingly as they approach perfection.
Srdly â€” The length 
of receptacle is another test of perfection : the Killarney plant, grown at Killarney, 
has a receptacle of very different length ; in the most perfect specimens it is at least 
four times as long as the involucre, in the least perfect it scarcely protrudes beyond 
the involucre, and under cultivation it is seldom to be seen at all, thus evidently pro- 
claiming that its length in some measure depends on health, maturity, and a conge- 
nial situation.
Willdenow, in the passage cited, describes the receptacle as four times 
the length of the involucre ; and I cannot assert either that its frequent departure from 
this character at Killarney proves anything more than that such departure is a testi- 
mony of imperfection, or its attaining this character at Glouin Caragh is to be attri- 
buted to any other causes than congenial situation.
The form of frond may be capa- 
ble, as Mr. Moore asserts, of great elongation, but there is no evidence that the rela- 
959 
live length of the pinnae is also altered : it appears to be a fundamental character of a 
deltoid frond, that the lowest pair of pinnae shall be longer than the second pair, the 
second longer than the third, and so on ; and, as far as I am aware, this character is 
constant in cultivation ; at least I can safely assert that it is so in Asplenium Adian- 
tum-nigrum, Lastraea recurva, &c.
The apex of the frond is often lengthened very 
remarkably, but the lower pinnae almost invariably partake of a similar elongation.
In lanceolate fronds, the lowest pair of pinnae are usually shorter than the second pair, 
the second shorter than the third; and this character in Asplenium lanceolatum, Las- 
traea multiflora &c., remains unaltered under any condition.
Now the two Trichoma- 
nes, although less decidedly deltoid or lanceolate than the ferns I have cited, follow 
the same law, each preserving respectively its deltoid or lanceolate tendency under 
cultivation.
Again, there is a decided differ- 
ence, as far as I can learn from my 
limited materials, in the involucres 
of the two plants.
In the Killarney 
plant the involucre stands out dis- 
tinctly from the membranous frond, 
and appears almost stalked, while in 
all my specimens of the Glouin Ca- 
ragh plant it is more or less united 
with the frond by a continuous mar- 
gin or wing ; this will perhaps be- 
come more evident from an inspec- 
tion of the figures in the margin, 
which fairly express the differences 
observable in my specimens from a h c d , 
each station.
Supposing that the a.
luvolucre of the Killamey plant in its usual state.
deltoid and lanceolate fronds are 6â€” f, Different states of involucre of GlouinCaragh plant.
constant in each plant, and that the exserted and partially embedded involucres are 
also constant, I think there can be little doubt that Mr. Andrews's plant claims the 
rank of a species ; the extraordinary length of the receptacle, the less divided state of 
frond, and the less tomentose rhizoma, so ably pointed out by the Irish botanists, will 
furnish additional support of such a decision, although I scarcely like to take either of 
these as a specific character.
Still I hesitate to add a species to our British Ferns un- 
less possessed of more ample means for forming an opinion ; and I give to the plant 
the name of Andrewsii as a variety only, respectfully begging of subsequent describers, 
that should their views coincide with mine, they will still allow the plant to bear the 
name of a naturalists to whose ardour and intelligence the science of Botany is under 
so many and such important obligations." â€” p.
315.
We are desirous of recording our opinion that Trichomanes An- 
drewsii will hereafter rank as a distinct species ; its descrepancies with 
speciosum are fully as great as those of Hymenophyllum tunbridgense 
and H.
unilaterale ; and there seems a general disposition to consider 
these permanently distinct.
Concerning the remaining tribes we have little to add.
The de- 
960 
scription and figure of the young frond of Botrychium Lunaria, a year 
prior to its appearance above ground, are new and interesting.
The 
monograph of Lycopodiacese is already before the readers of * The 
Phytologist,' and to this there is no material addition, except a list of 
habitats ; and under Isoetes lacustris an interesting detail of its mode 
of increase, which accounts very clearly for the crowded and elon- 
gated state in which it is frequently found.
The reprints comprised 
in the Appendix will be acceptable to botanists.
It may perhaps be expected that we should oiFer a more decided 
opinion as to the merits of this work ; but let those who think so, re- 
collect the identity of the author of the ' History ' and the proprietor 
of 'The Phytologist,' and we think it will be allowed that a mere 
commentary on the contents, and an exhibition of a very few of the 
illustrations â€” six out of one hundred and forty, â€” is all that decency 
allows, although not less than our position as faithful chroniclers 
seems to require.

â€” Further remarks on Botanical Classification.
By Philip B.
Ayres, Esq., M.D.
Thame, April 18, 1844.
Sir, 
When I penned my remarks on Mr. Edmonston's views, 
I certainly did not expect that they would have called forth as his 
champion a gentleman occupying so high a station in the scientific 
world as the Vice-President of the Linnean Society.
Notwithstanding 
the great respect I feel for one so distinguished, and fully aware as I 
am, of the difficulty a raw recruit, like myself, must encounter in op- 
posing a veteran, I must crave your permission to offer a few notes 
upon the notes of Mr. Forster ; and this I shall do with all proper 
courtesy and deference.
I find his notes to consist : â€” 
1. Of remarks upon the terms artificial and natural.
'2.
On the meaning of the term species.
3. On some innovations of fashionable modern and juvenile botanists.
In the first place, with respect to the artificial and natural systems, 
I find Mr. Forster affirming that the term natural is equally applicable 
to the systems of Linneeus, of Jussieu, of Decandolle, &c.
; but that 
the system of Linnaeus, preeminently the artificial system, does not 
show the evident affinity so clearly as the others.
961 
1 have been accustomed to consider a system as more natural in 
proportion as it brings together those beings or substances that bear 
the greatest resemblance to each other in all their parts, and vice ver- 
sa, as less natural in proportion as these "evident affinities" are dis- 
regarded.
Whether I am right in my opinion is another question ; 
but until the above statement is proved to be incorrect, I shall feel 
myself bound to adhere to it.
Tried by the above rule, it is easily 
shown that the modern so-called natural system deserves that name, 
while the term " artificial " is justly applied to that of Linnaeus, in 
which so many incongruous forms are united under the same order 
and class.
Secondly.
â€” I have always thought that " species " was understood 
by naturalists as'a collective term, including all individuals possess- 
ing similar characters, and not applicahle to any one individual.
Thus it is improper, in my opinion, to say that a plant, for example, 
of Mentha viridis, is a species ; but rather, that it belongs to the spe- 
cies viridis of the genus Mentha, the species being a collective term, 
under which any number of individuals may be ranged.
If each in- 
dividual be a species, it is evident that there are as many species as 
individuals, which is absurd.
The characters of individuals cannot 
be the individuals themselves.
Moreover, species being a collective 
term, cannot exist in external Nature, but becomes an intellectual 
conception or idea existing in the mind of man alone ; in short, as I 
have called it in my former communication, an induction.
I shall 
now endeavour to show proofs of this opinion.
The term species, it must be remembered, is applicable to all natu- 
ral substances and beings ; to animals, to plants, to minerals.
It sig- 
nifies, according to its etymology, a sort or kind.
How then does the 
mind of man arrive at this term } Obviously the only method is by 
comparison and abstraction.
Man sees around him a vast multitude 
of substances and beings ; prompted by his natural curiosity, he ex- 
amines these objects, and finds that certain individuals agree or dis- 
agree in their form, their sensible qualities and habits.
Placing before 
his mind a number of individuals, he finds them to agree in all their 
more important characters, giving to them a kind of identity : and he 
thence draws the deduction or induction that they belong to the same 
kind or species.
It follows that the species is neither an individual 
nor any number of individuals, but a collective term including all in- 
dividuals that have existed, do, or may exist, possessing similar cha- 
racters ; and hence the species is entirely ideal.
Proceeding in the 
same manner by comparison and abstraction, he arrives at the higher 
4 N 
962 
inductions of genus, order, class, &c.
Having thus formed an intel- 
lectual ladder, he can ascend or descend by it at pleasure ; he can 
follow the original ascending series, or, starting from the higher divi- 
sions, he can descend to the individual.
The former is done in the 
construction of species, genera, classes &c.
; the latter, when posses- 
sing these deductions, he wishes to arrive at particulars.
The one is 
the ascent from particular to general ; the other, the descent from the 
general to the particular.
Thus species, like genus, order and class, being shown to be a 
purely intellectual conception capable of being expressed by certain 
characters, it follows that all substances possessing these characters 
will necessarily belong to, or be included under the species.
As the term species is applicable to minerals, to which the power 
of genesis, in the usual sense of the word, is denied, it follows that 
the power of generating their like is an accidental, though important, 
adjunct to the idea of species when applied to organized beings.
The power of genesis is then one only of the characters of the species.
Thus we are again reduced to the creation of individual plants and 
animals, having as one of their most important characters the power 
of reproducing similar individuals.
The foregoing exposition of my views relating to species will ex- 
plain why I consider that the evidence of varieties is opposed to Mr.
Edmonston's opinions, since varieties will be equally intellectual con- 
ceptions, differing simply from the primary idea of the species in some 
unimportant character ; â€” a minor induction.
Varieties are of two 
kinds ; those trivial variations that give the peculiar character to the 
individual, and those more important variations which are con- 
stantly found in a certain number of individuals, and are often propa- 
gated for several generations.
I shall be glad to be informed how the 
latter are to be distinguished from species, according to the views of 
my opponents !
The very difficulty of distinguishing varieties from 
species ; the alternate exaltation of varieties into species and depres- 
sion of former species to varieties which abound in all works on sys- 
tematic Botany, show that they are inductions from a smaller number 
of characters.
With reference to the quotation from Dr. Lindley's ' Key to Bota- 
ny,' I have to apologise for the oversight I have inadvertently made, in 
including the term species among the groups to which he refers in the 
passage quoted by Mr. Edmonston ; but if the previous argument be 
correct, the lapsus will be of little consequence, since the quotation 
will be as applicable to species as to any other group.

Thirdly.
â€” I am sorry to see the term "fashionable " so constantly 
applied by the advocates of the Linnaean school to those who follow 
what they consider a better system, as a term of reproach and ridicule.
Fashion implies change, and is used in that sense by the opponents 
of the natural system ; referring, I suppose, to the changes that sys- 
tem has undergone : but surely it must be allowed that progression 
towards perfection is better than to remain in the same immoveable 
unimprovable state.
The method of Linnaeus itself was a progressive 
change on the older and more imperfect systems that preceded it, as, 
I think, the system of Jussieu, DeCandolle &c., is a progression from 
the more imperfect system of Linnaeus.
Let us expect, then, that in 
proportion as our knowledge of Nature increases, changes of system 
must follow as necessary and beneficial results.
As to Nature's working by " carpenter's rule," I can only remark 
that did not Nature work by rule, the earth would be a chaotic mass; 
those nice dependencies of beings and substances on each other, and 
the order which even a superficial study of natural objects positively 
obtrudes upon us, would neither be discoverable, nor indeed would 
exist.
Any one who observes the variations by which allied plants 
placed under different species approach each other, will see that there 
must be a type or model on which the species must be based ; the 
general derived fi'om the individual.
If my interpretation of the term species be correct, it will follow 
that man does make species, as well as genera and other groups, and 
consequently that the expression " exalting varieties to the rank of 
species " &c., may be correctly used.
Whoever will compare the various catalogues of British plants, for 
example, will see that what were formerly termed species are either 
divided into two or more modern species, or, on the other hand, de- 
pressed to the rank of varieties !
And how are these divisions, these 
exaltations and depressions, brought about ?
By observation of their 
rej)roduction by seed ?
No : but by the variation of the value of dif- 
ferent characters in the minds of different botanists !
What is the 
value of the term species if it be liable to such mutations ?
I have now, Sir, expressed, as clearly as I am able, my notions on 
the subjects contained in the letters of Mr. Edmonston and Mr. Fors- 
ter.
I shall hail with pleasure the proof that they are incorrect, but 
at the same time 1 must express my gratification that while Mr. Fors- 
ter has attacked my opinions on a few minor points, he has left un- 
touched the great question of the comparative beauty and utility of 
the two rival systems.
964 
I hope, Sir, that these observations will be considered, by yourself 
and readers, as worthy of being " called a reply " to the animadver- 
sions of Mr. Forster.
And beg to subscribe myself.

473, Note on the Meetings of the Botanical Society of Edinburgh.
The Edinburgh Botanical Society does continue its meetings, and has 
had a constant supply of valuable papers.
The 3rd part of the Trans- 
actions is now printing at Edinburgh, and will conclude the first vo- 
lume.
The commencement of Vol. 2 is also in the press, and will be 
published in a kw months.
It will contain papers fully equal to those 
contained in the former parts.

[An apology is due to Mr. Babington for the omission of the above note from our 
April No.

having been mislaid.
The note refers to an observation on the wrapper of the March 
No., and is satisfactory inasmuch as it shows that the meetings of the Edinburgh Soci- 
ety are still held ; but it does not explain why we have not been favoured with the re- 
ports of proceedings at any of the meetings held during the present session.

A Word on Worcestershire Botany.
I observe reported in 
the February No.
(Phytol.
875), a notice of a botanical excursion by 
Mr. S.
P. Woodward, in Warwickshire, Worcestershire, &c., which 
seems to call for a few remarks.
I have nothing to say against the 
Irish observations, where, sensibly enough, Mr. W.
says he " took Mr.
Newman's 'Irish Notes' in his hand," and had Dr. Taylor as a guide.
Now if he had acted on the same principle throughout his journey, 
surely his botanical notes would not have been so meager respecting 
Worcestershire, more especially as he was near good sporting-covers, 
had he but known it.
If a botanist, professedly travelling for scien- 
tific purposes, will make no enquiries, and take no note as to what 
has been previously done in the district he is reviewing, how can he 
expect that his nose only will guide him to the most favourable loca- 
lities ?
I mention this as a hint to all collecting botanists, and not 
only to Mr. W.
This gentleman states that he spent a week in Wor- 
cestershire, but it " afforded him very little scope for botanizing, the 
interest of the country being chiefly geological." He mentions being 
at Kidderminster, where the returns were nil ; but why not have pro- 
4 O 
970 
gressed to Bewdley forest, only five or six miles from thence, where 
the curious Pyrus domestica grows, and where Geranium sylvaticum 
and Epipactis ensifolia occur in profusion ?
Here also he might have 
met with Rubus suberectus and R.
saxatilis, to say nothing of many 
ferns.
The Clent Hills between Kidderminster and Stourbridge, Mr.
W. says " have no rills or ponds,'''' and " are entirely destitute of 
ferns." Surely this is much too sweeping an observation.
I have 
not been very lately to the Clent hills, so cannot say whether or not 
every fern has now disappeared ; but I happen to have by me a writ- 
ten note, made on the spot, as to the existence of water there : and I 
would not mind undertaking to produce at least half a dozen species 
of ferns from the same vicinity, if the onus were laid upon me to do 
so.
My note says, â€” "The Clent hills consist of several green undu- 
lating eminences, now all enclosed, stretching from N.E. by N.
to 
S.E. by S., insulated from each other by longitudinal valleys winding 
from west to east.
The two principal hills are Clent proper and 
Walton, the latter of which, being the highest, I found by barometri- 
cal observation to be 875 feet in altitude.
The principal valley is 
that between Clent and Walton hills.
A stream gushes along it, pass- 
ing out to the w^est near Clent church, and finally emptying itself in- 
to the Stour," But oddly enough, \imy testimony is insufficient, the 
' Saxon Chronicle ' tells us that at " Cowdale in Clent," a spring of 
water gushed out of the ground at the spot where Prince Kenelm, 
only son of Kenulph, King of Mercia, was basely murdered in 819, at 
the instigation of his villanous sister Quendrida, whose " ugly mug," 
with horrible grinning teeth, yet appears on the wall of St. Kenelm's 
chapel, a short distance eastw^ard of Clent hill.
A spring of water 
actually now arises on the east side of this chapel, forming a small 
stream that descends into a woody dingle, where I recollect observ- 
ing in profusion Adoxa moschatellina and Chrysosplenium alternifo- 
lium, so often companions of each other.
But not to forget St. Kenelm 
and the miraculous spring of water, so strangely lost sight of by Mr.
W. One might have rested satisfied that the spring now rising in St.
Kenelm's chapel-yard, was the identical holy spring of the Saxon 
Chi'onicle ; but fortunately for our present purpose, we get another 
draught of cold water by the aid of Mr. Scott's ' History of Stour- 
bridge,' who, at p.
292, tells us that at the distance of less than a mile 
southward of the chapel, " a most beautiful chrystal fountain arises," 
which, he kindly suggests, is the " real original " miraculous fountain 
owing its rise to poor Prince Kenelm's murder !
However this may 
be, I trust I have obtained a trifling sprinkling at least for the arid 
971 
Clent hills, which future botanical ramblers will do well to avail them- 
selves of.
Mr. W.
mentions the Rubery-hill, " flanking the Broms- 
grove Lickey ; " but if he had stepped on two miles farther, to the 
Bromsgrove Lickey itself, he might have perceived one of the most 
interesting localities for Worcestershire plants, and almost the only 
spot in the county whose Botany has anything of a subalpine charac- 
ter â€” gloomy hills black to their very summits with bushy plants of 
Calluna vulgaris, interspersed with Erica cinerea and Tetralix, woods 
filled to repletion with Vaccinium Myrtillus, and bogs containing 
Narthecium ossifragum, Vaccinium Oxycoccos, Melica caerulea and 
the Eriophori.
Rubus hirtus and affinis also form bushes upon the 
summit of the Beacon-hill, and Juncus squarrosus is abundant, while 
most of these plants are absent from the Malvern range.
There is 
surely no want of water here, and Lastraea dilatata grows most mag- 
nificently in the damp ravines, with a bilobated variety of Grammitis 
Ceterach, Athyrium Filix-femina, and other fenis.
I could easily 
mention several other favourable boggy localities near Kidderminster 
and Stourport, where various Carices and rare plants grow.
But I 
have no wish to repress the energies of any enquirer, and only think 
it right to hint to young botanists, that due enquiry should be first 
made before it is too confidently set down that ferns and water are en- 
tirely absent firom any ranges of hills, though at the time perhaps both 
may be within a stone's throw of the observer, had his local knowledge 
enabled him to reach them.

Note on some localities in Mr. W.
Gardiner^s List, (Phytol.
915).
In the last number of ' The Phytologist' Mr. Gardiner of Dun- 
dee, a very zealous and enthusiastic botanist, gives some localities for 
rare Scotch plants which he collected in 1843.
Among these he no- 
tices what he calls new stations for Lychnis viscaria and Carex rari- 
flora.
The localities however have been known for some time.
I 
gathered the former in Craighall woods in August, 1829, and gave 
specimens to Dr. Graham and other botanists in Edinburgh.
In' 
another part of the same woods, I picked Convallaria verticillata 
and Neottia Nidus-avis.
Carex rariflora was seen by Dr. Greville 
Mr. Brand and myself, in a bog above Caness, in August, 1837.
â€” 
Along the sides of the stream running into Caness, we gathered 
at the same time profusion of Phleum alpinum, Alopecurus alpinus 
and Carex aquatilis.
I think the station was noticed in Dr. Greville's 
report of the excursion, read before the Botanical Society of Edin- 
burgh ; at all events, specimens were distributed from this locality.
972 
I have no doubt however that Mr. Gardiner gathered the plants in 
these localities, without any knowledge of what had been done by 
others, and he deserves credit for the careful manner in which he has 
examined our alpine Flora.
The other phanerogamous plants men- 
tioned in Mr. G.'s list were picked in stations well known to all those 
who have botanized in the rich districts of Clova and Glen Isla, more 
especially to such as have accompanied Prof.
Graham in his delight- 
ful excursions.
A notice of most of them will be seen in the reports 
published by Dr. Graham in the ' Edinburgh Philosophical Journal.' 
I am glad to see that Mr. Gardiner found Alopecurus alpinus in pro-

Corrections of some errors in Mr. Gardiner''s List of Plants.
My friend Professor Balfour has pointed out to me my mistake in sup- 
posing the stations for Lychnis viscaria and Carex rariflora (Phytol.
915-16) to be new, and I therefore gladly embrace the earliest oppor- 
tunity of correcting it.
I was perfectly unaware of these stations 
being previously known, and shall always be exceedingly thankful for 
any such corrections.

Remarks on the London List of British Plants.
In the new 
London Catalogue of British Plants, we have what has been long 
wanted, a list arranged according to the natural system, and gratitude 
is due from all botanists to the gentlemen who have been instrumen- 
tal in publishing it.
But how is it, that after having the nomenclature 
of our native plants completely revolutionized by the Edinburgh So- 
ciety's list, which was to make our names agree with the continental 
ones, and set all errors to rights, â€” how is it, I ask, that we now have 
so curious a compromise between the new and the old nomenclatures ?
For while (to students of Smith and Hooker) Equisetum fluviatile ap- 
pears under the name of E.
Telmateia, Carex caespitosa under that of 
Goodenovii, and Orobus sylvaticus of Vicia Orobus ; Arrhenatherum 
avenaceum, on the other hand, returns to Avena elatior ; the genus 
973 
Arundo is restored vice Calamagi'ostis and Phragmites ; Alsine and 
Mcehringia degenerate into Arenaria ; and sundry species of Erucas- 
trum, Brassica and Diplotaxis revert to venerable Sinapis.
These are 
only two or three instances taken at random to illustrate the " resto- 
ration." In the next place it appears that after all the wise ones were 
wrong in making species of Erythraea latifolia, pulchellaand littoralis; 
of Carex irrigua ; of Cochlearia anglica, danica and groenlandica ; of 
Senecio aquaticus, Habenaria chlorantha, sundry Atriplices, and a 
host of other plants, exalted only to be abased : for all these appear 
in the London Catalogue as varieties.
Surely Carex Q^deri is a good 
species !
Surely Prunus insititia and domestica are something more 
than varieties of P.
spinosa !
And wherein have failed Stachys ambi- 
gua, Juncus conglomeratus and effusus, Avena alpina and planiculmis, 
that they should have no claim to numbers ?
Their claim to specific 
distinction seems to have been transferred to Fedia eriocai*pa, Ranun- 
culus circinatus &c., and Ajuga alpina is gone altogether.
Would it 
not have been an improvement if a few synonymes had been introdu- 
ced ?
Is Carex glauca of the list what we have latterly called C.
re- 
curva ?
Is Glyceria loliacea the plant which has at different times 
borne the generic names of Triticum and Sclerochloa ?
Without a 
good library we shall have to use plenty of guess-work in checking off 
our possessions.
In the next place I am anxious to know how long 
a residence in this country is necessary before a plant becomes " suf- 
ficiently naturalized"?
Mimulus luteus, Eranthis hiemalis, Lilium 
Martagon &c.
are admitted, while Oxalis stricta.
Erica carnea, Lina- 
ria purpurea &c.
are excluded.
The distinction between the two 
species of Impatiens is nicely discriminated; Noli-me-tangere is held 
to be truly wild because included in three Floras, fulva is introduced 
because not found in one of the twenty.
Moreover, if the doubtfully 
native plants are to be marked at all, why not have made the list of 
them perfect, instead of leaving it incomplete, as avowed at p.
15 ?
The result is, that we are very little wiser than before, as it is impos- 
sible to know which of the remainder " ought to have been" marked 
by the compilers.
We are told that Viola odorata, Cheiranthus Cheiri, 
Crocus nudiflorus and the Vincas are not wild, but are professedly 
left in the dark as to Sisymbrium Irio, Chelidonium majus, and other 
introduced species.
And when plants have been found only once or 
twice, or the known habitat is destroyed, is that a reason why they 
should afterwards be excluded from our lists, as is done in the Lon- 
don Catalogue with Eriophorum alpinum, Carex Davalliana, Poten- 
tilla alba, Bromus arvensis, &c.
? On the same principle surely Con- 
974 
vallaria bifolia, Cypripedium Calceolus, Cyclamen hederilbliuni, &c.
should have been expelled to the cover.
If such a plan is persevered 
in, we shall never know what to consider as our really native though 
very rare plants.
â€” Joseph Sidehotham ; Manchester, April 19, 1844.
[We gladly give insertion to the above remarks of Mr. Sidehotham, not because 
they are strictures on the extensive changes in nomenclature introduced into the Cata- 
logue of the London Botanical Society, but because they refer to a subject of vital 
importance to the science of Botany.
Every botanist must see how greatly to be de- 
sired is a uniform nomenclature ; and to this desirable end should the efforts of all 
cultivators of the science be strenuously and unanimously directed.
But this object 
can never be attained so long as those who ought to be considered authorities follow 
each their own path.
Some of the changes complained of by Mr. Sidehotham, did not, 
however, originate with the London Botanical Society ; their adoption of some of these 
changes we entirely approve of, nor can we help wishing that in some things they had 
gone a little further.
For instance, the substitution of Equisetum Telmateia for flu- 
viatile was proposed by Mr. Newman in our own pages (Phytol.
721), and this change 
has been adopted by the compilers of the London Catalogue; but why did they not 
restore the rejected name fluviatile to what we consider its legitimate position, as the 
appellation of the species still standing in the list as E.
limosum ?
Carex glauca agaiu 
is merely a restoration of a prior name to the plant named recurva by Hudson, and is 
adopted from Mr. Babington's Manual.
Restorations of this nature, where the right 
of priority can be determined and is adhered to, we can never quarrel with.
The com- 
pilers of the Edinburgh Catalogue thought it necessary to explain certain changes in- 
troduced into their list; perhaps the compilers of the London Catalogue may think it 
rio'ht to adopt the same course : if so,, we shall be happy to admit their explanations 
into our pages.
We shall also be glad to receive communications from our correspon- 
dents on the subject of nomenclature.
By the way, we may take this opportunity of 
observing that we are convinced there is still room for a catalogue of British plants, 
with all their synonymes from the time of LinuEeus, on the plan of Steudel's excellent 
'Nomenclator,' which indeed should form the basis of the new British catalogue : 
this, if properly executed, would be a boon to our working botanists.

Note on Primula elatior.
On the 17th instant I accompanied 
Mr. Borrer to Great Bardfield, Essex, to gather the true Primula ela- 
tior, where it was found by Mr. Henry Doubleday, (Phytol.
204).
â€” 
On our way from the railway-station, Mr. Borrer fortunately espied it 
in a wet hilly pasture on the left of the road from Bishop's Stortford 
to Takeley, between the two- mile-stone and Thremhale Priory.
We 
alighted of course, and entering the field, we observed it in greater 
abundance than in the meadow near the bridge over the Pant at Great 
Bardfield, although not quite so luxuriant.
This plant has been fre- 
quently overlooked or confounded with Primula vulgaris, /3.
{Smith), 
Mr. Babington's /3.
umhsllata, which is beautifully figured in Hook- 
er s continuation of Curtis's ' Flora Londinensis ' under the name of 
Primula elatior.
Sir J.
E. Smith was evidently acquainted with both, 
975 
and lias well distinguished them; the accui'ate figure in 'English Bo- 
tany' of Primula elatior, was communicated by the Rev. Mr.
Hemsted, 
from whence does not appear.
Mr. Hewett C.
Watson (Phytol.
232) 
is decidedly right in saying that the Bardfield plant is the sjoecies in- 
tended to be figured in 'English Botany' (513), and is identical with 
Swiss and German specimens ; I have a plant growing, and now in 
full flower, which was received from Belgium, exactly corresponding.
It is probable that Ray did not distinguish the two plants, and that 
his " in sylvis & ad sepes non admodum infrequens " belongs to P.
vulgaris, 0., and " interdum & in pascua descendit " to P.
elatior.
His synonyme " Paralysis altera odorata flore pallido polyanthos," â€” 
" The Primrose Cowslip," Parkinson's Paradise, 244, I think belongs 
to P.
elatior.
I suppose both are called Oxlips in most counties : in 
Essex I know they are indiscriminately cowslips, the Primula veris 
being invariably pagils.

Note on the Bardfield Oxlip.
Thinking it might interest you 
to see a few of the oxlips which I have raised from seed collected at 
Bardfield in 1842, I send some in a box.
I am quite convinced it is 
a really distinct species, as out of at least five hundred that have flow- 
ered, there is no variation from the old plants, nothing like a primrose 
or cowslip amongst them.
They all droop.
â€” Henry Douhleday ; Ep- 
ping, April 25, 1844.
[True indeed to their parental type are the beautiful descendants of the Bardfield 
oxlip which we have just received from our kind correspondent Mr. H.
Doubleday.
We have long felt convinced that the Bardfield plants belong to a perfectly distinct 
species â€” the Primula elatior of Jacquin ; and now, had a doubt remained, it must 
have been dispelled by the specimens j ust received, for which we tender our best thanks 
to Mr. Doubleday.
It is not a little strange that this plant should be confined, as it 
apparently is, to a few localities in Essex.

Note on Cerastium semidecandrum and tetrandrum.
En- 
closed are some specimens of Cerastium semidecandrum and tetran- 
drum.
They grow together plentifully on the drier parts of our denes, 
and equally abundantly.
The tetrandrous plants may be readily dis- 
tinguished at a passing glance among the patches in which they grow, 
by a more robust appearance and larger flowers ; but as to the speci- 
fic characters given in ' British Flora,' 3rd edition, I have not access 
to a later), I think you will find in C.
semidecandrum the calyx more 
taper-pointed, the petals not more deeply cloven, but the calyx margins 
perhaps more membranaceous than in the tetrandrous plant.

On the Ascent and Circulation of the Sap in Plants.
At a 
recent meeting of the Royal Society were read, " Some further Obser- 
976 
vations and Experiments illustrative of the Cause of the Ascent and 
continued Motion of the Sap,' in continuation of a paper presented 
November 1842, by G.
Rainey, Esq. â€” - The author here gives an ac- 
count of some experiments which he has lately made, tending, in his 
opinion, to corroborate the opinions he advanced in his former paper ; 
namely, that the ascending sap is situate in the intercellular and in- 
tervascular spaces of the plant, and that its passage into the cells is 
effected by the action of endosmose, which the intervening membranes 
whether living, or deprived of vitality, exert upon that fluid.
He found 
that portions of many plants, such as Anthriscus vulgaris and the Lap- 
sana communis, absorb a much larger quantity of fluid when they are 
immersed in pure water, than when similarly immersed in a solution 
of gum-arabic : and that, in the latter case, the remaining portion of 
the solution is of the same specific gravity as before any part has been 
absorbed by the plant.
By a similar process the author conceives the 
fluid which is derived from the earth, and has passed into the inter- 
cellular spaces of the cotyledons, are imbibed by its cells by endos- 
mose ; while at the same time a fluid containing sugar is passing, by 
exosmose, out of these cells into the intercellular and intervascular 
tissue, and thence into the corresponding tissue of the peduncle and 
young stem ; it there meets with, and is diluted by the water ascend- 
ing in the same tissue from the roots, and the mixture is afterwards 
distributed over every part of the plant."â€” J^/tew<BMm, Ap7'il 10, 1844.

â€” Further Remarks on Botanical Classification.
By Thomas Edmonston, jun., Esq.
Aberdeen, April, 1844.
Sir, 
I beg to trouble you with a few remarks on Dr. Ayres's 
letter (Phytol.
885), replying to my former paper, (Id. 759).
Dr. A.
seems, in the first instance, to have quite misunderstood my 
meaning in objecting to the abandonment of the Linnaean system ; if 
he keeps in view my primary proposition, that an artificial scheme is 
necessary to the beginner, he will find that much of his reasoning is 
thrown away, and that not seldom he is arguing in parallel lines with 
myself.
I never objected to the " natui'atl " system as a part of the 
study of Botany, and my arguments were mainly intended to show 
how improper a system it is for a student.
Bearing this in mind, I 
shall shortly examine the value of some of Dr. Ayres's vindications.
In the first place, I confess I can see little analogy between the 
Linnaean system and an " index," to which Dr. A.
is pleased to liken 
it.
By an index we ascertain indeed the name of any article we are 
wishing to find in a bulky encyclopoedia or other book, but nothing 
more.
Will Dr. Ay res say that after we have, by the aid of the Lin- 
naean system, acquired the knowledge of the name of a plant, we still 
know nothing of that plant } Must we not first ascertain the number 
and position of its stamens, then the character of its calyx, corolla, 
fruit &c., next of its root, leaves, inflorescence, &c.
; and all this be- 
fore we can know the name ?
And from the first step, the ascertain- 
ing of its class, we are continuing to acquire information regarding the 
structure of the plant.
The "natural" botanists wish to be in a great 
hurry, teaching the student all about the plant at the outset, and 
making him learn at first what he would far better become acquainted 
with at a later stage of his progress ; in short, in homely phrase, " put- 
ting the cart before the horse." If a Linnean botanist were to say to 
the student, " You must find out the number and position of the sta- 
mens and pistils of that plant, but do'nt stir a step further, as you re- 
verence the memory of him of Upsala ; all you have to do is to know 
that such a plant belongs to Pentandria, Monogynia, you have no 
4 p 
978 
concern with anything else :" â€” then indeed "stale and unprofitable" 
would be the information gained ; but can we disconnect the know- 
ing the class and order from knowing the genus and species ?
The 
one is a means to the other, and is valueless by itself.
The simple 
difference between the modus operandi of the two systems is this ; by 
the Linnsean you are conducted by easy stages to the knowledge of 
the species, by the other you are immediately, or nearly so, brought 
into contact with what should have been your last step.
Dr. Ayres seems to ground his defence of the natural system on a 
most extraordinary hypothesis, viz., the assumption that all the ab- 
stractions we term classes, orders, genera, &c., have as much a " local 
habitation and a name " as the abstraction we term species, and he 
doubtless thinks himself triumphant in naming them all " inductions 
from individuals ; " Dr. Ayres at the same time, however, makes men- 
tion of the particular point in which species differ from every other 
" induction," namely, their " capability of propagating their like." Is 
not this an essential difference from all other inductions ?
Do genera, 
or classes, or orders, " propagate their like ?
" What sort of a hybrid 
would the two abstractions Kanunculacese and Cruciferag produce ?
Yet if they are all alike inductions from a beginning, then they must 
all have analogous properties, and two genera, or two orders, must 
produce hybrids, and " propagate their like " in the same way as two 
species.
It is obvious to every unprejudiced mind, that Nature has 
created individuals having certain common peculiarities which no 
other induction from individuals possesses, and to these we give the 
name of species.
Where the line is drawn we cannot often tell, and 
wofully shall we find philology to fail us in endeavouring to thi-ead 
the mysterious mazes of Nature's labyrinth.
We must be content to 
descend from the high pinnacle of metaphysics, and take the more 
homely guidance of experience and analogy, in viewing with our 
finite and imperfect vision the infinite and perfect works of the Eter- 
nal.
But a more unfortunate line of argument could scarcely be 
pitched on for the feasibility of a natural system, than that which al- 
leges that all our groupings have actually an existence in the scheme 
of Nature.
It assumes that every plant has its proper niche, and that 
there is a regular gradation of affinity between the highest and the 
lowest forms of vegetable life.
Now we are perhaps acquainted with 
two thirds of the plants on the globe, say three fourths, and in all pro- 
bability not more are known to science.
What a faint and indistinct 
glimmering of the true System of Nature must we have !
How many 
gaps to be filled up !
How many erroneous affinities to be corrected !
979 
What a " combination of disjointed things " â€” nay, not only " dis- 
jointed," but a system affected with fragilitas ossium, where every 
bone is broken, and nothing to be seen but here a fragment and there 
a fragment, a Httle of everything and nothing complete!
Can such a 
dismembered system, such a collection of debris, be of any real prac- 
tical use ?
I should say no !
Dr. Ayres considers my quotation from Dr. Lindley as "not suffi- 
ciently ample." I confess I do not well understand the two senses in 
which a group may be " natural." Dr. A.
says " he (Dr. Lindley) im- 
plies that Nature has not indeed created species, orders, genera, or 
other groups, as such, but has imprinted such characters and affinities 
on plants as enables us to throw them into groups approximating 
more or less to the scheme of Nature, and in that sense natural." Now 
this distinction is somewhat too nice for my organs of discrimination : 
if Nature has indeed formed such a chain of characters and affinities, 
then we must say that she has formed the groups which are the tan- 
gible representatives of these characters.
We cannot say that Nature 
has created a name, as a genus or an order, but if she has created the 
thing we represent and understand by the name, where is the differ- 
ence ?
The word species implies a congeries of individuals having 
certain common peculiarities and distinctions; and when we say "Na- 
ture creates species," we mean that she creates individuals having the 
properties which we attribute to the abstraction â€” species.
Dr. Ayres wishes to establish the existence of a plan of Nature by 
asserting that plants possess certain " gradations of affinity," and are 
connected with each other by " oscillatory groups." It has not been 
my good fortune to fall in with these regular " gradations of affini- 
ties ; " and as to " oscillatory groups," the system generally seems af- 
fected with a continual "oscillation," and to be never at rest ; for, says 
Dr. Lindley, "the natural orders seldom follow in the same manner in 
the arrangements of two different botanists." The existence of regu- 
lar and connected " gradations of affinity " is just the point I dispute, 
for I conceive they have, in most instances, their behig rather in ima- 
gination than in fact, and a group is dubbed " natural," and its " affi- 
nities " and " transitions " marked out with unerring accuracy forth- 
with, in which state it remains for perhaps six months, till some other 
botanist conceives its position " unnatural," and transfers it to some 
other place, from thence, in turn, to be removed.
If the high-flown 
pretensions of the natural school were realized, and every genus and 
every species, from the highest to the lowest type of vegetable life had 
its true place in the scale of being assigned to it, then indeed we 
4p2 
980 
should lay aside the Linnsean system, the " last loved echoes " of 
Monandria and Diandria would soon die away, and the faint glim- 
mering light of the Swedish botanist be eclipsed by the noon-tide 
splendour of the "System of Nature." As, however, unfortunately, 
this pitch of perfection has not been reached, nor in my opinion ever 
will, nor ever can he, I must take leave to dispute the existence of 
these "regular gradations of affinity," and count all systems hitherto 
propounded as alike remote from the System of Nature.
Which must 
necessarily be the case, for I maintain no such system exists, save in 
the heated imaginations of some over-enthusiastic followers of this 
visionary school.
Allow me to ask Dr. Ayres, if one group of plants is defined ac- 
cording to the character of its stamens, and another according to the 
character of its seeds, are they not both equally " artificial " ?
We 
shall find that the latter condition is frequently the case in many " na- 
tural " orders, for when their definitions are disencumbered of super- 
fluous matter, their essential characters are as limited as those of the 
Linnsean system.* 
We shall take our former example, Ranunculaceae, and after reject- 
ing the characters which are either inconsistent, and therefore impro- 
per to be introduced into Nature's own system, or common to other 
groups, we shall see what a multitude of points the plants referred to 
agree in.
The definition given by Dr. Ayres from Lindley, is, " Po- 
lypetalous dicotyledons with hypogynous stamens, anthers bursting 
by long slits, several distinct simple carpella, exstipulate leaves 
sheathing at the base, solid albumen and seeds without arillus." Now 
all the species are not " polypetalous," inasmuch as some are apeta- 
lous^'' neither have all the species " several distinct simple carpella," 
for in some species the carpels are coherent, â€” partially in Nigella and 
wholly in Actaea.
Other orders are, equally with Ranunculaceee, " di- 
cotyledonous with hypogynous stamens, anthers bursting by long slits, 
exstipulate leaves sheathing at the base." Thus the characters drawn 
from the seeds are the only unexceptionable ones, and the group is 
manifestly as artificial as if it were characterized fi'om the stamens or 
any other single part.
* A remarkable instance of this occurs in Detarium, a genus of Leguminosse, which 
has the icosandrous stamens and drupaceous fruit of Amygdalese, and only differs from 
that order hy having compound leaves ; so that the latter character is the only distinc- 
tive one between the two groups Leguminosse and Amygdaleae, however unlike the ty- 
pical species may be.
981 
Let us take two British plants referred to this order, and glance at 
their points of similarity.
The two species may be Ranunculus Fica- 
ria, and Actaea spicata.
In the former, the leaves are simple, the stem 
single-flowered, the sepals three, the petals nine or ten, and nectarife- 
rous at the base, the carpella distinct and ultimately forming single- 
seeded caryopsides.
In Actaea the leaves are compound, the stem is 
many-flowered, the sepals and petals four in number, the latter with- 
out nectarium, the carpels single, and the fruit a many-seeded berry.
These two plants are exactly opposite in the character of their 
leaves, inflorescence, calyx and corolla, and fruit, yet this is a " natu- 
ral" group !
â€” Its members have such a general and at once apparent 
resemblance, that they may be immediately recognized ; they do not 
agree in one character only, in a multitude of points are they alike ; 
there is no assemblage of "disjointed things" here, all is the harmony 
of Nature, the system of Creation !!!
We are far from that point, I 
fear, and botanists will soon perceive what an ignis fatiius they are 
pursuing, and seeing the fallacy of the specious theories and bold pre- 
tensions of the natural school, return to the simple and philosophical 
method of acquiring knowledge in the easiest manner, and without 
troubling their heads about hunting out " affinities " which have no 
existence, and " transitions " and " oscillatory groups " which have 
yet to be formed.
Let it be borne in mind that by these remarks 1 do 
not mean to say that the " natural " system is or ought to be thrown 
aside ; let it be studied in its proper place, and it will be productive 
of much and lasting benefit.
It can scarcely be otherwise, since it 
bears the impress of the great minds of a Jussieu, a Brown, a Decan- 
dolle, and a Lindley ; but let it not be foisted forward where it can 
only disgust and perplex.
What would be thought of a teacher of 
Algebra, who should put the binomial theorem into the hands of his 
pupil, while he was yet ignorant of the signs ?
Yet this is exactly 
what is recommended by those botanists who wish the natural to su- 
persede the artificial system ; they would teach the student compli- 
cated theories before he has any knowledge of the plants from a com- 
parison of which these theories are formed : and because certain tribes 
of plants occur in which truenoXxaxaX resemblances exist, they hastily 
assume that such is universally the case : and overlooking the legiti- 
mate ends of classification, spend needlessly much time and reason- 
ing in attempting to prove the " thing which is not." Let the artifi- 
cial and the natural systems proceed pari passu ; they will never be 
found to come into contact, but to work in sisterly harmony, each 
confined to its proper sphere, towards the great end of an increased 
982 
knowledge of the boundless and wondrous variety of vegetable life and 
structure.
The " artificial " will not quarrel with the " natural " be- 
cause it is not and never can be the System of Nature; and the natu- 
ral will tolerate some sacrifices of evident affinity made to precision 
and clearness of definition by the artificial.
Let botanists also occu- 
py themselves in endeavouring to improve the Linnsean system, so as 
to adapt it to our more extended knowledge, and then 1 have no he- 
sitation in sajdng that it will never be laid on the shelf, but will be 
immortal as the science, or as the memorj'^ of the giant mind that 
fi-amed it.
I remain.
Sir, 
Your obedient Servant, 
Thomas Edmonston, jun.
To the Editor of ' The Phytologist.' 
p g_ â€” Since the above remarks were penned, I have received the 
April and May numbers of ' The Phytologist,' in which I am glad to 
find so able and justly distinguished a supporter as Mr. Forster, as it 
proves that even among those who hold a high rank as botanists, there 
are still some who do not consider it imperative on them to " follow 
the fashion" (as I must still beg leave to call the "natural" system, 
notwithstanding Dr. Ayres' animadversions on the term).
I am un- 
willing to trespass too largely on your space, and will merely offer 
one brief remark on Dr. Ayres' second paper.
The foregoing will, I 
trust, explain to him my ideas of the nature of species, of which, as it 
appears to me, he has taken a far too transcendental view.
It is 
needless repeating what has already been said; but if Dr. A.
will par- 
don me, I would beg to suggest the getting rid, as speedily as possi- 
ble, of these ultra-metaphysical views as applied to Botany, for I am 
sure a little reflection will convince him of the impossibility of apply- 
ing the strict rules of logical induction to the boundless and ever-va- 
rying phenomena of Nature.
With this brief remark I trust that Dr.
A. will feel satisfied that the preceding remarks do not leave " un- 
touched the great question of the comparative beauty and utility of 
the two rival systems." T.

â€” List of Flowering Plants found in the neighbour- 
hood of Great Marlow^ Bucks, in the early part of the Summer 
of 1843.
By G.
G. Mill, Esq.
The country about Marlow, in Buckinghamshire, is scarcely if at 
all known to the botanist ; indeed it is very little known to any ex- 
cept those in the immediate neighbourhood, and to a few anglers who 
visit it from its proximity to the Thames.
After passing three summer months there, and being well repaid, 
as far as botanical researches went, I think it will probably be interest- 
ing to the readers of * The Phytologist ' to have some account of the 
plants of that neighbourhood.
The plants which grow there are either those of a chalk country, or 
such as are fond of the banks of rivers and the neighbouring alluvial 
soil, with the swamps and deep ditches which usually attend it; there 
are also the plants of wet woods, of which there is no lack in the 
country, it being composed for the most part of low ranges of thickly- 
wooded hills.
The plants of which there is a deficiency are such as grow on a 
sandy or dry gravelly soil, on open heaths, or on wet spongy com- 
mons, as will be seen by the following list.

This extremely beautiful little plant grows in all 
the woods round Marlow- common; I have also seen it growing in 
woods to the right of the Wycombe road.
There can be no doubt 
that it grows in most of the woods in this neighbourhood, for it must 
undoubtedly be the same as the Pyrola of the Stokenchurch woods,

media, and which was 
found, under the same name, by Mr. W.
Pamplin, near Henley-on-

Note on the Primula elatior.
I am glad to find that the Pri- 
mula elatior has, this season, claimed the attention of some of our 
eminent English botanists, and that the result of their examination 
quite coincides with the opinion I have formed respecting this plant.
It grows very abundantly in many of the woods in this neighbourhood, 
while P.
vulgaris is rather uncommon, and is never met with, so far 
as my observation has extended, in the same woods as P.
elatior ; in 
a few places P.
veris and vulgaris are found intermixed, and among 
them is occasionally scattered a plant which I take to be a hybrid 
between them, partaking of the characters of each, but it is quite dif- 
ferent from the real P.
elatior, both in the colour and form of the 
flower, in the calyx, &c.
; but in these situations there are only a few 
scattered among the two parent stocks, while in those places where 
P. elatior grows, neither P.
vulgaris nor P.
veris is met with, which, 
were the former only a hybrid between them, must be considered a 
very remarkable and inexplicable circumstance.
I have had a plant 
of it in my garden for several years, where it retains in all respects its 
specific characters.- -G.

Proposal as to the Nomenclature of the Bardfield Oxlip.
Botanists appear more and more to incline to the opinion that Mr.
Doubleday's Bardfield oxlip is distinct as a species ; and I believe 
they generally coincide also in the opinion that it is not the plant 
termed elatior by Linneus and the majority of subsequent authors : 
it may further be stated as the opinion of competent judges, that Mr.
Doubleday's plant is the Primula elatior of Jacquin.
Sir William 
Hooker, in the recently published edition of his ' British Flora,' gives 
Primula elatior of Jacquin as synonymous with Primula veris &.
ela- 
tior of Linneus, without any allusion to the Bardfield plant, and Mr.
Babington gives the Bardfield plant as a distinct species, without any 
allusion to the Linnean plant.
We are thus compelled, in order to 
avoid confusion, to speak of Mr. Doubleday's discovery as the Bard- 
field oxlip, or JacquiiTbS elatior, or to devise some other unscientific 
term in order to make ourselves understood.
This does not seem in 
accordance with the usage of science.
It is quite evident that the 
name of elatior is preserved out of respect to Linneus, but it is a tri- 
bute of respect we have no right to pay.
Were Linneus himself living, 
would he not unite with us in opinion as to the non-identity of the 
two elatiors ?
Would he not say, " I object, gentlemen, to your 
997 
giving one of my names to a species with which I was unacquainted ; 
I still believe my elatior to be nothing more than a hybrid, or a ca- 
sual variety, yours is a distinct species, and must not be confounded 
with mine.'''' I suggest therefore that it should bear the name of Jac- 
quin, if that author was the first to point out its distinctness as a spe- 
cies, and that it should henceforth be called Primula Jacquinii.

Note on Liinularia vulgaris fruiting under glass.
About this 
time last year I received from J.
Ralfs, of Penzance, some living spe- 
cimens of Lunularia vulgaris, with young female receptacles covered 
by the indusium, being informed by him that they never attain to 
greater perfection in that neighbourhood.
I placed them in a box 
under glass, with other Hepaticee, and in two or three months had 
the pleasure of seeing the peduncle gradually rise, and the fruit fully 
matured, with its cruciform tubulose processes.
As the circumstance 
of Lunularia fruiting under glass is mentioned in ' Flora Hibernica,' 1 
thought it might be interesting to some of the readers of 'The Phyto- 
logist.' â€” Isaac Broivn ; Hitcliin, I5th 5th Mo. 1844.

New locality for Barkhausia setosa.
On carefully examining 
some plants which I gathered last summer in a clover-field, on a chalk 
soil, near Hitchin, I find that they perfectly agree with the descrip- 
tion of Barkhausia setosa in Koch's Spiopsis, and have no doubt that 
they were introduced with the clover-seed.
This makes the third sta- 
tion, if I mistake not, for this plant.

Note on Agaricus macrorhizus.
Since I sent you the list of 
Agarics found in the neighbourhood of Hitchin (Phytol.

Brown met with a fine crop of Agaricus macrorhizus, growing plen- 
tifully in a cucumber-bed, some having a pileus an inch and a half 
broad, and a root five or six inches long.
Agaricus domesticus was 
also found growing on damp wood in a wash-house.

List of Mosses found near Penzance.
A list of Algae, many 
of them peculiar to this district, from the pen of Mr. Ralfs (Phytol.
193), and one of the Hepaticae of Penzance by Mr. Curnow (Id. 609) 
having already appeared in the pages of ' The Phytologist,' I venture 
to add also a list of the mosses of the neighbourhood, presuming it will 
not be altogether devoid of interest, as it contains several rather rare 
species.
Although many additions have been made during the last 
winter, and the list at present is by no means a short one, still I be- 
lieve that much remains to be done in investigating the mosses of this 
western limit of England, the greater portion of the north, and some 
998 
portion of the southern coast, still remaining unexplored ; a line of 
country, which, especially where some rivulet dashes down the cliffs, 
must be peculiarly adapted to the growth of many cryptogamic plants.
It may be as well to observe that all the species mentioned here grow 
within four miles of Penzance, except those which are stated to occur 
only at Hayle, St. Ives, the North Coast, or the Land's End, which 
would be about eight miles distant.

Note on Anthyllis vulneraria.
Upon examining various spe- 
cimens of this plant, gathered near Mousehole, I was surprised to find 
that the stamens were not monadelphous, as stated in all the Floras 
to which I have access, but truly diadelphous, or nine united and one 
free.
May I enquire, through the medium of 'The Phytologist,' whe- 
ther this variety be of frequent occurrence ; for a variety I suppose it 
must be, as, had it been the usual state of the plant, botanists would 
surely never have placed it in the monadelphous group.

Note on the Bardfield and Claygate OxUps. The correspon- 
dents of 'The Phytologist' appear to be still feeling an interest in the 
subject of the oxlips.
I am induced therefore to point out a charac- 
1002 
ter of the Bardfield plant (Primula elatior, Jacq.) which will probably 
afford a certain distinction between the latter and the spurious oxlips.
In the cowslip and primrose, and all their varieties, a circle of scale-like 
glands surrounds the orifice of the tube of the corolla.
These glands 
are absent from the Primula elatior.
It is diflScult to specify any other 
sufficient character, as I have seen exceptional instances to all the 
characters (taken singly) by which this plant is distinguished from 
the other two species in Mr. Babington's Manual ; the specific cha- 
racter drawn out by that author being quite accurate, but not invari- 
ably applicable.
While alluding to the oxlips, I take advantage of 
the opportunity of also again mentioning a peculiar variety of the 
primrose, spoken of in the first No.
(Phytol.
9), although at the time 
I was not aware that I was writing a letter to be printed verbatim.
The plant has remained in my garden since the spring of 1841, flow- 
ering freely, but without a single young plant appearing about it: this 
apparently countenanced the idea of its hybrid origin.
To obtain 
better proof, I collected the seeds last year, and sowed them this 
spring in a flower-pot, kept well watered : the result is now seen in 
dozens of young plants, which so far tends to negative the supposi- 
tion of hybridity.
These young plants will not flower before next 
year.

Note on Oystopteris alpina and regia.
The long- mooted 
question respecting the distinction between Cystopteris alpina and 
regia appears to be in almost as unsatisfactory a state as it ever was.
Francis treats it in a very summary manner (see his note, foot of p.
24).
His conclusion, that we " are bound to conclude that when the 
the plant was vigorous, it took one character, and now that it is but 
struggling for existence, it assumes the other," seems extremely un- 
satisfactory.
Last winter, some specimens came into my hands from 
Mr. Shepherd, of the Liverpool Botanic Garden, a gentleman whose 
long celebrity in the cultivation of ferns, renders his opinion of some 
weight.
One was marked " Cystea alpina.
Hook.
Br. Fl.
Switzer- 
land ;" the other, " Cystea regia, Bernh.
Settle, Yorkshire.
1816." 
The extreme dissimilarity between the specimens striking me at first 
sight; and on further examining them with a glass, it being still more 
apparent, I was induced to enquire further of that gentleman re- 
specting them.
He said that he had gathered C.
regia himself at Set- 
tle, twenty-eight years ago ; he had brought live specimens with him 
from Settle, which plants he had cultivated ever since that time, but 
they remained in every way (through so long a period of cultivation) 
the same as those he had gathered in a wild state.
The specimen he 
1003 
sent me was a wild one, and agreed in every way with Sir J.
E. Smith's 
description in ' English Flora.' Its larger, stouter, and every way 
fuller habit, being apparent at the first glance.
C. alpina, Mr. Shep- 
herd said was a Swiss specimen: it had been cultivated for some years 
by him from plants sent him by Mr. Otto.
Now though alpina was a 
cultivated specimen, and had had full chance of becoming "vigorous" 
in the gardens, and although regia was wild â€” " struggling," " we are 
bound to suppose," for existence â€” in a place where it is most proba- 
ble it is now extinct ; yet the latter is by a very great deal the stouter 
of the two.
Being but a novice in botanical research, and incapable 
of forming an opinion on so difficult a matter, I have been induced to 
refer the matter to you, hoping that after you have examined the en- 
closed specimens, you will let me know the result in ' The Phytolo-

C. Babington, 
Esq., M.A., F.L.S., G.S., &c.
Two specimens of this very rare plant 
were first found by Mr. James Drummond, in or about the year 1810, 
near Castletown, Bearhaven, in the county of Cork, " opposite the 
western redoubt, growing in a salt-marsh near the shore." One of 
these was communicated to Sir J.
E. Smith, who published it in his 
' English Flora' under the name of Neottia gemmipara, with a de- 
scription furnished by Mr. Drummond.
Within these few years the 
plant has been again discovered near to, but probably not in exactly 
the original spot, by Dr. P.
A. Armstrong, who, on the 30th of Sep- 
tember, 1843, conducted Mr. Babington and Mr. E.
Winterbottom to 
the station, where they saw about twelve specimens, several of which 
had been destroyed by cattle, and all were in a rather advanced state 
of flowering.
Mr. Babington has given a detailed description of the 
plant from the specimens then collected, and has subsequently iden- 
tified it with specimens of Reichenbach's Spiranthes cernua, from N.
America, in Sir W.
J. Hooker's herbarium.
It differs in some parti- 
culars from the other European species ; the most remarkable discre- 
1004 
pancy consisting in the connexion of all the sepals with the two lateral 
petals.
The difference inhabit is considerable from the great density 
of the spike, and the arrangement of the flowers in three spiral lines.

The following papers were read : â€” 
1. On four genera of Desmidiesae, by Mr. Ralfs, Penzance.
In 
these papers, which were illustrated by beautifully executed sketches, 
fourteen species of this group are described, nine of which belong to 
Euastrum, two each to Tetmemorus and Micrasterias, and one to 
Berkeleya.
Regarding the former of these, Mr. Ralfs makes the fol- 
lowing remarks, which are worthy of attention from such botanists as 
may wish to study this minute though interesting family : â€” " The 
species of Euastrum are not well defined ; plants of this genus vary 
greatly in form, and it is not unlikely that young fronds have been 
described as distinct.
Whenever it is practicable, the frond should 
be examined in four different directions, namely, in the front or usual 
position, at the side, at the end, and by a transverse oy junction view, 
after the segments have been separated." And again, in describing 
E. gemmatum, he says, â€” " Whilst engaged in examining this species 
I was first struck with the advantage to be derived from the figure of 
the transverse view in the discrimination of nearly allied species.
I 
have since obtained Meneghini's Synopsis of this family, and find that 
he has extensively availed himself of it in forming his specific cha- 
racters of this genus." 
2. Note on a Monstrosity of the Pistil of Primula vulgaris.
By Mr.
C. C.
Babington, M.A., &c., Cambridge.
The curious monstrosity 
described in this paper was sent to the author by Mr. J.
H. Walton, 
of St. Bees College, in Cumberland.
Flowers of the usual form and 
structure were found on the same root, with two flowers possessing 
the anomalous organ, which Mr. Babington describes as follows : â€” 
" Within the base of the corolla is situated a small fleshy cup, from 
the centre of which springs a cylindrical stem, capped with another 
shallow fleshy cup, having a wavy margin.
An exposed conical pla- 
centa, covered with peltate ovules, is seated in the centre of the lat- 
ter cup.
Thus the true ovary is converted into a cup-sliaped body, 
and the capitate stigma has become an open fleshy ovary." The 
1005 
description of this cimous structure gave rise to some discussion, in 
which the President and Dr. Greville took a part.

mainder of the olive-coloured Algae, hitherto observed on the Aber- 
deenshire coast, are enumerated), the author discusses at considerable 
length the characters which have been assigned to various species by 
different writers on Algae, and states his own view^s respecting them.
He also notices the comparative paucity of the marine Flora of Aber- 
deenshire, ascribing the absence of the more delicate species, partly 
to the unsheltered nature of the coast, and partly to the influence of 
temperature; and says, â€” "Scarcely one half of the Melanospermous 
Algae, enumerated in Harvey's Manual as occurring in Britain, are 
found here â€” the proportions being as 34 to 80." 
4. On some British species of the genus QCnanthe.
By John Ball, 
B.A., &c., Dublin.
In this paper three species of OEnanthe are de- 
scribed as natives of Britain ; viz., QL.
pimpinelloides, Lmn., (^.
si- 
laifolia, Bieb.
(peucedanifolia, Sm.), and Q^.
Lachenalii, Gmel.
The 
first is stated to be very rare, the author having only seen one speci- 
men wanting fruit, which was gathered near Forthampton, in Glou- 
cestershire, by Mr. E.
Lees.
He is, however, fully of opinion, that it 
is the true pimpinelloides of Linnaeus and the continental botanists, 
and proposes that the plant should resume its place as a species in 
the English Flora ; the last is stated to be the commonest of the 
group â€” he having received it from several parts of England, from the 
coast of Galloway, and from near Dunbar in Scotland.
The paper 
concludes w4th the following remarks on the value of the characters 
of these species : â€” " The position and size of the tubers of the root 
are, I suspect, of doubtful constancy.
Observation must determine 
its importance.
The general disposition and proportions of the leaves 
are probably much to be depended on here, and throughout the whole 
order.
The hoUowness or solidity of the stem depends, I believe, 
almost wholly on the place of growth, and is of no moment.
The 
petals vary somewhat in size, but scarcely in form, those of the outer 
sterile florets being always compared with each other.
The form of 
the fruit seems not so constant as might be expected.
The presence 
or absence of the incrassated summit of the pedicel I never have seen 
to vary."

The following papers were read : â€”

1. On the Difference between the Robertsonian Saxifrages of Ire- 
land, and those of the Pyrenees.
By Mr. C.
C. Babington, M.A., 
F.L.S., &c.
In this paper the author pointed out the differences 
which he had obseiTed between the Irish species of Saxifraga refer- 
rible to Ha worth's genus Robertsonia, and the corresponding plants 
of the Pyrenees.
In a paper contained in the ' Annals of Natural 
History,' he had already shown that the Pyrenean S.
umbrosa, the ty- 
pical plant of the group, differs from the Irish form ; but was not then 
aware that precisely the same differences existed between the S.
Geum 
and S.
hirsuta of these two countries.
" The differences referred to," 
observes Mr. Babington, "are found in the form of the margin of the 
leaves, which may be correctly denominated ' crenate ' in the Pyre- 
nean plants, but to which the terms ^acutely crenate^ 'â– serrate^ or 
'â– dentate^ must be applied when the Irish specimens are described." 
The paper was accompanied by drawings of the leaves of the spe- 
cies under consideration.
2. Contributions to British Jungermanniae.
By Dr. Taylor, Dun- 
kerron.
Communicated by Mr. W.
Gourlie, jun.
Glasgow.
In this 
paper six species of Jungermannia, new to the British Flora, are de- 
scribed, viz., J.
nimbosa, Taylor, MS., J.
curta, Marthis, J.
Thuja, 
Dicks., J.
rivularis, Nees, J.
Dillenii and J.
Aquilegia, Taylor, MSS., 
with a minute diagnosis of each species.
3. On the genus Staurastrum, (Desmidieae).
By Mr. John Ralfs, 
Penzance.
In this paper, which is a continuation of a series on the 
Desmidieae, fourteen species are described, with an analysis of the 
genus, and drawings exhibiting the appearance of the frond in each 
species described, both in a front and end view.
4. A second paper by Mr. Babington was read â€” " On some British 
species of the genus CEnanthe." This communication was drawn up 
after the perusal of Mr. Ball's paper on the same subject, read before 
the Society at last meeting.
The author agrees with that gentleman 
in believing that the true GE.
pimpinelloides of Linnaeus is indigenous 
to England, he having received specimens of a plant nearly agreeing 
with Mr. Ball's description, from the Rev. W.
L. P.
Garnons, which 
were gathered in a " marsh between Weymouth and Portland Island." 
In reference to the other species, viz., CE.
peucedanifolia, Smith, and 
CE.
silaifolia, Bieh., there seems still to exist considerable difficulty, 
which the author has not yet been able satisfactorily to explain, from 
the want of authentic specimens of Bieberstein's plant.
5. An additional note on the monstrosity of the Pistil in Primula 
vulgaris.
By Mr. C.
C. Babington.
In the account given of this 
1007 
curious monstrosity at the last meeting of the Society, no mention was 
made of the state of the male organs or the floral envelopes.
Mr. Ba- 
bington has supplied this desideratum in the present notice.
The 
stamens were of the usual form, and in the usual position; and he now 
supposes that the two cups alluded to in the former notice, as occu- 
pying the place of the capsule, are formed by two whorls of carpellary 
leaves, and that the development of two in place of one, has deprived 
each of the power of becoming a perfect capsule, or of producing a 
style in the usual manner.
A donation to the library was presented from F.
S. Cordier, M.D., 
Paris, being his ' Histoire et Description des Champignons.' David

dent Fellow of the Society.

A specimen of Barkhausia setosa was presented by G.

corn-fields, at Withington, near Manchester.
A specimen of Primula vulgaris, bearing three flowers upon a long, 
slender scape, was exhibited from Mr. D.
Stock, of Bungay, as an 
example of the plant usually (though incorrectly) called Primula ela- 
tior by the botanists of that part of England.
Having been enclosed 
in a post letter before drying, it was too much shrivelled to admit of 
its being assigned quite certainly to the variety caulescens of the Lon- 
don Catalogue.
The variety intermedia of the same Catalogue usu- 
ally bears ten or twenty flowers on a scape, and approximates to the 
cowslip in its deep colour and short pubescence.
A monstrosity of Primula vulgaris was also presented by Mr. D.
Stock.
In this specimen, a short peduncle terminated in a funnel- 
shaped calyx, formed by the adhesion of fifteen sepals, and enclosing 
two distinct corollas; the limb of one corolla being divided into eight 
lobes, that of the other into seven.

Bell, Esq., F.R.S., &c.
President, in the chair.
Mr. Bowerbank called the attention of the Society to a minute spe- 
cies of Conferva growing between the lenses of an achromatic object- 
1008 
glass, which he described as being chiefly composed of branching 
elongated tubes, containing molecular spherules at irregular distances, 
and accompanied with the appearance of moisture adhering to the 
tubes.
Another form was that of a series of molecular spherules touch- 
ing each other, and presenting amoniliform appearance, this he attri- 
buted to the escape of those bodies from the tubes, and suggested the 
probability that this mode of arrangement might be due to an exten- 
sion of the principle of polarization.
He also produced some objects 
mounted on glass, under talc, in which the paper covering them had 
been pasted down, and in which a Conferva of an exactly similar ap- 
pearance was seen branching over the objects, and greatly obscuring 
them.
Mr, Bowerbank also exhibited au aquatic larva, very com- 
monly found in the water with which London is supplied, in which 
the circulation is seen in a very beautiful manner, as well as a pecu- 
liar contraction of the muscles of the limbs, which, in some instances, 
appear to be composed of a single fasciculus, and in contracting are 
simply bent at intervals, without exhibiting an appreciable swelling 
of the fasciculus of ultimate fibres.
Mr. J.
Quekett made some observations on the cause of the irides- 
cent surface of glass which has been for some years either exposed to 
the atmosphere or buried in the earth.
This was clearly shown to be 
the result of a decomposition of the surface of the glass, which is thus 
split up into a vast number of exceedingly fine and close lines, inter- 
secting each other in every direction, and thus producing the effect 
described.
Some observations were made by Mr. E.
Quekett, on the crystals 
contained in the cells of plants.
He stated that in most cases the 
position of these bodies is accidental or uncertain, but in some in- 
stances, as in the cells of the covering of the seed of the elm, the crys- 
tals are regularly disposed in all specimens, and appear to be adherent 
only to the walls of the cells that touch each other in the horizontal 
plane.
Mr. Q.
made further observations on the supposed use of these 
bodies in the vegetable kingdom, and was of opinion, as Professor 
Bailey of West Point, New York, had stated, that these bodies con- 
tributed by the decay of the plant, as well as the vegetable matter, to 
furnish materials for the support of future plants.
The enormous 
quantity (sometimes 80 per cent, in the dried plant), and their com- 
position, which is oxalate of lime in most cases, seemed adapted, by 
the decomposition of the oxalate into carbon and oxygen, to furnish 
two important elements of vegetable structure.

â€” FmiJier Remarks on Botanical Classification.
By Philip B.
Ayres, Esq., M.D.
Thame, June 19, 1844.
Sir, 
I am fearful that both your readers and yourself will 
desire that our discussion on botanical classification, and the relative 
merits of the systems now in use, should come to an early termina- 
tion ; and in this desire I, for one, heartily concur : not, however, 
that T am afraid of my opponents, or ashamed of the line of argument 
I have employed ; but that I think the pages of your journal might 
perhaps be more profitably filled.
Nevertheless, should Mr. Edmon- 
ston or Mr. Forster prolong the controversy, I may promise them to 
be found at my post.
The last letter from Mr. Edmonston (Phytol.
977) was unfortu- 
nately written before he had seen my communication in reply to Mr.
Forster (Id. 960) ; and having been so, the main argument of my last 
letter on the nature of species was left untouched, or at the most but 
slightly glanced at as a transcendental or ultra-metaphysical notion 
or set of notions.
But whether it be transcendental and ultra-meta- 
physical or not, is a matter of little importance, since to answer the 
purpose of Mr. Edmonston, it must be disproved.
Much therefore of 
Mr. Edmonston's renewed disquisition on the nature of species, must 
fall to the ground, since he has taken no notice of the species of mi- 
nerals, to which the term is fully as applicable as to plants and ani- 
mals.
Even LinnsBus himself applied the term to minerals in his 
' Systema Naturae,' and I suppose Mr. Edmonston will not call his 
authority in question !
Now if species be applicable to minerals, the power of generating 
their like is, as I have before shown, merely one of the characters on 
which the induction is founded; and the attempt to reduce my argu- 
ment to absurdity, by bringing forward hybrids between genera, orders 
and classes, becomes completely nugatory, for the absurdity of sup- 
posing hybrids between species of minerals, is most palpable !!!
But further, if Mr. Edmonston will give the matter a moment's con- 
4 p 
1010 
sideration, he must see that the production of hybrids between indi- 
viduals of different genera, orders and classes, is rendered impossible 
by the difference of the structure of such plants preventing fecunda- 
tion ; only those plants and animals that most nearly approach each 
other in structure, being capable of engendering together.
But it is 
stated on high authority, that hybrids have been procured between 
individuals of different genera.
Thus Treviranus describes a hybrid 
between Campanula divergens and Phyteuma betonicsefolia ; Gaert- 
ner, one from Convolvulus sepium fecundated by Ipomcea purpurea, 
from Datura Isevis and Metel fecundated by the henbanes and tobac- 
co, from Glaucium luteum fecundated by the poppies, &c.
; Wieg- 
mann also obtained hybrids from Vicia faba fecundated by Ervum 
lens, and from Pisum arvense by Vicia sativa ; lastly.
Knight fecun- 
dated the almond with the pollen of the peach.* 
Mr. Edmonston has admitted, in his former communication, that 
genera, orders and classes are pure abstractions, for he has said that 
Nature only creates species ; but we have here two of these abstrac- 
tions (in a certain sense) copulating and bringing forth hybrids.
What has now become of his argument derived from hybridity ?
But Mr. Edmonston further says ; " It is obvious to every unpre- 
judiced mind, that Nature has created individuals having certain com- 
mon peculiarities which no other induction from individuals possesses, 
and to these we give the name of species." I am afraid that this is 
as unintelligible to me, as my statement of the two senses in which 
groups are natural appears to be to Mr. Edmonston; but coupling it 
with the following sentence from Mr. E.'s letter, we shall find that 
even he allows, after all, that " species " is an induction or abstraction, 
for the terms are synonymous.
'' The word species implies a conge- 
ries of individuals having certain common peculiarities and distinc- 
tions ; and when we say that Nature creates species, we mean that she 
creates individuals having the properties which we attribute to the 
abstraction â€” species." This settles the question as regards species 
between Mr. Edmonston and myself; and unless Mr. Forster has 
something more to bring forward on the subject, the matter must be 
considered as finally adjusted, for Mr. Edmonston has fully, but pro- 
bably unintentionally, admitted all that I could desire.
I certainly 
did not expect to proselytize him so quickly, and I congratulate him 
on arriving at the only sense in which the term is applicable to the 
three kingdoms of Nature.

Mr. Edmonston has surely mistaken my meaning when he puts in 
my mouth the statement that "all our groupings have actually an ex- 
istence in the scheme of Nature." 1 have merely affirmed that the 
capability of being thrown into such groups, is a powerful argument 
for the existence of a plan or scheme in the Divine Mind anterior to 
the creation of natural objects, and that our groups are nothing more 
than an attempt to approximate to the Divine plan or order, " Order 
is Heaven's first law," says Pope, in the double character of philoso- 
pher and poet.
The groups in all systems are metaphysical ; they are creations of 
the mind of man, but they are natural in proportion as they place in 
immediate proximity those objects that most closely resemble each 
other, or, in other words, have the strongest affinity.
But from what 
I have said above, it is impossible that these groups should have a 
positive existence in external nature; we can have no personification 
of any one group ; classes, orders, genera, species, are entirely men- 
tal.
If indeed they are mental, if no personification of them can be 
shown (and such cannot), then are they entirely metaphysical, and 
being metaphysical, why taunt me with being "ultra-metaphysical," 
when the subject-matter of our discourse comes within the domain of 
that science, and of that alone ?
From what has been said above, I would undoubtedly answer Mr.
Edmonston, that inasmuch as the groups of both systems are crea- 
tions of man's mind, they are both artificial, but that, as throwing to- 
gether those plants that bear the greatest resemblance to each other, 
the natural system approximates most nearly to the plan which I have 
supposed to exist in the Divine Mind.
Mr. Edmonston's analysis of Ranunculacew does much more than 
he intended, for it totally destroys the characters of the order.
He 
has rejected all the characters except those derived from the seed, 
and J complete the work of destruction, by stating that there are nu- 
merous orders that possess solid albumen and seeds without arillus, 
in common with Ranunculaceae.
I am afraid that even the veriest 
sticklers for the old system will not go so far as Mr. Edmonston, and 
pronounce Ranunculaceae a nonentity !
But I object to Mr. E.'s plan 
of examining the characters of natural orders, in toto.
I maintain 
that the whole of the characters must be retained, and that the excep- 
tions must not be made the rule.
There are a very few genera in 
which exceptions to those characters occur, and these, approximating 
to other orders in their characters, form those oscillatory groups that 
1012 
Mr. Edmonstou professes himself unable to discover.
Now as to 
these oscillatory groups, it is a curious circumstance that Mr. Edmon- 
ston has kindly furnished me with an excellent illustration of an oscil- 
latory group, in the succeeding page to that in which he declares he 
has never been able to find one!
The genus Detarinm has, it ap- 
pears, the icosandrous stamens and drupaceous fi'uit of Amygdalaceae, 
with the compound leaves of Leguminaceae, and is hence interme- 
mediate between the two orders, partaking the characters of each, 
and intimately connecting them.
Both these orders are extremely 
natural, so much so, that a person completely ignorant of the princi- 
ples of Botany would be able to group the species composing them 
together, as bearing the greatest possible resemblance to each other.
Now the genus Detarium forms the oscillatory group connecting 
Amygdalaceae with Leguminaceae ; belonging strictly to neither, but 
common to both : and hence this genus may be placed by one bota- 
nist under Amygdalaceae, by another under Leguminaceae, according 
as certain characters are valued by each.
But because Detarium re- 
sembles Amygdalaceae in every particular save its compound leaves, 
compound leaves form the only distinctive character between Amyg- 
dalaceae and Leguminaceae.
This, I submit, is an example of false 
loo-ic of the drawing forth a general rule from an exception ; the 
making the exception the rule'.!!
Every one is capable of classing the common leguminous plants of 
our gardens and fields into one group; of seeing that the pea and 
bean and vetch are closely related to each other.
Now the fact that 
the veriest ignoramus is capable of such classification shows that such 
relationship exists.
Now on turning to Withering s Arrangement, I 
find all the leguminous plants very snugly ensconced under the shel- 
tering wings of Diadelphia Decandria ; but turning to the descrip- 
tions of the genera, I find that Genista, Ulex, Ononis, Anthyllis &c.
are really monadelphous, while Pisum, Orobus, Lathyrus and others 
are as truly diadelphous.
Again, any moderately intelligent person 
v.'ould select the grasses from any confused heap of specimens, because 
their resemblance is most striking ; but on the Linnaean system this 
most natural order must be broken up.
Anthoxanthum is in the same 
work placed in Diandria, while the remainder form part of Triandria.
But in truth the grasses form part of the following Linnaean classes ; 
Monandria, Diandria, Triandria, Tetrandria, Hexandria, Moncecia 
and Polvgamia.
This, then, is the exactitude and certainty of the 
Limiaian system !!!
Has it really so great facilities for the detection 
of species ?
Suppose a person, who is simply acquainted with 
1013 
the characters of the Linnsean classes and orders, were to find a mon- 
oecious or polygamous grass, would he find it ranged under MonoBcia 
or Polygamia ?
Two examples have thus been given of natural or- 
ders founded by Linnaeus himself, obvious to every sagacious mind, 
which under this arbitrary artificial scheme are distributed through 
some half-dozen classes !I Let no more be said of the certainty and 
infallibility of the artificial scheme !
Speaking of the natural system, Mr. Edmonston gives us the two 
following passages in his last letter, to a comparison of which 1 wish 
to draw the attention of your readers.
" What a combination of dis- 
jointed things â€” nay, not only disjointed, but a system affected with 
fragilitas ossium, where every bone is broken, and nothing to be seen 
but hei'e a fragment and there a fragment, a little of everything and 
nothing complete !
Can such a dismembered system, such a collec- 
tion of debris, be of any real practical use } I should say.
No !
" 
But now turn over a leaf, and the following passage, so admirably in 
unison with the above, meets your view.
" Let it be borne in mind 
that by these remarks I do not mean to say that the natural system is 
or ought to be thrown aside ; let it be studied in its proper place, and 
it will be productive of much and lasting benefit.
It can scarcely be 
otherwise, since it bears the impress of the great minds of a Jussieu, 
a Brown, a DeCandolle and a Lindley, [and I would add, which Mr.
Edmonston forgets, a Linnaeus] ; but let it not be foisted forward 
where it can only disgust and perplex." What !
â€” a combination of 
disjointed things, a system affected w\\h fragilitas ossium, a fragmen- 
tary mass, a little of everything and nothing complete â€” of much and 
lasting benefit, and bearing the impress of so many and great names !!!
Surely there must be some mistake here ; such fragmentary systems 
are not usually the productions of great minds !!
Did Linnaeus pro- 
ject a fragmentary system, after and in preference to his own primary 
and more perfect system ?
Mr. Edmonston has forgotten himself 
A few words on a point I have left unnoticed at the commencement 
of Mr. Edmonston's letter, and I have done.
I have called the Lin- 
naean system a mere index (but a valuable one) to plants, and this 
seems to have given great offence to the followers of that school.
In 
examining this question, we must bear in mind that the species and 
genera are common to all classifications ; these are agreed upon by 
all ; the difference between the rival systems exists in the higher 
groups alone â€” the classes and orders.
Now if we confine ourselves 
to these higher groups, what do we learn of a plant by the Linnsean 
system ?
Simply the number and position of the stamens and pistils 
1014 
â€” no reference being necessarily made to other parts of the plant.
Now this seems to me very like the A, B, C of an index.
But in the 
natural system, the whole plant must be examined before a decision 
can be pronounced as to the order to which the plant belongs, and 
thus passing in review the whole structure of the plant, much more 
knowledge of it must be gained than by merely examining the sta- 
mens and pistils.
It is true, that in descending to the genera and 
species, the whole plant will be examined, but this has no reference 
to the particular system.
In what I have hitherto said, I have not depreciated the Linnsean 
system below its proper level.
I have admitted its great utility in 
furthering our primary studies of plants ; but I deny that it is an ar- 
rangement that will satisfy a philosophical mind.
If it could have 
done so, how was it that Linnaeus himself propounded a " natural 
system " ?
1 must admit that there is considerable difficulty in comprehend- 
ing the natural system without assistance ; but those who have heard 
Professor Lindley's lucid demonstrations of that system, will acknow- 
ledge that it is of all systems the most philosophical.
I fear that in this and the foregoing communications, I have used 
many repetitions, but I have endeavoui'ed to avoid them as much as 
was consistent with the full elucidation of the subject.
I am.

â€” ExplanaUons of the ^London Catalogue of British 
Plants.'' By G.
E. Dennes, Esq., F.L.S., Secretary of the 
Botanical Society of London.
The editorial note appended to Mr. Sidebotham's letter (Phytol.
478), renders it expedient to offer some explanations about the 'Lon- 
don Catalogue of British Plants.' The comments of Mr. Sidebotham 
are mostly founded on misapprehension of facts.
For instance, Mr. S.
asserts that Tmpatiens fulva is held to be an introduced species, "be- 
cause not found in one of the twenty " local Floras consulted.
The 
fact is not so.
The number of local Floras in which the several spe- 
cies occur, is given only in indication of their comparative frequency 
and diffusion ; and without reference to the distinction made between 
1015 
native and naturalised species.
Impatiens fulva was originally intro- 
duced to this country from America, as any botanist would have 
informed Mr. Sidebotham.
All will concur with the editorial wishes for uniformity of nomencla- 
clature, so far as it can now be obtained.
The names in works alrea- 
dy printed cannot be changed; and just so far as new works introduce 
new names, so far is the departure from unifomiity increased.
The 
sparing adoption of newly invented names, is a characteristic feature 
of the London Catalogue ; and there is only one instance, in the 
whole Catalogue, of a change in the name of a species, to wit, Glyce- 
ria loliacea, which shall presently be accounted for.
In every other 
instance, (one or two errors of the press or pen excepted), the autho- 
rity is given for the species, which shows the name to be one previ- 
ously in use.
The London Society, thus, cannot truly be accused of 
making extensive changes in nomenclature.
All that was done, con- 
sisted in the selection of one from among the various names already 
applied to the same species by different authors.
Individual bota- 
nists may think that they could have made a better selection of names ; 
but this is a matter of individual opinion or self-complacency.
In selecting the names, the leading rule was that of taking the best 
known name , although, in several instances, this rule was allowed to 
yield to other considerations.
Thus, it was a question whether pre- 
ference should be given to Carex recurva, as the name best known to 
English botanists, or to Carex glauca, as the name best known to the 
botanical world in general ; and the latter was adopted, because pri- 
ority was in its favour, and not much confusion was likely to arise 
from its use.
On the other hand, while Carex Goodenovii was cor- 
rectly substituted for Carex ca3spitosa, this latter name was not sub- 
stituted for that of Carex stricta ; because, to take a familiar name 
from one species, and then give the same name to a different species, 
seemed the most certain mode of causing error and confusion.
A si- 
milar reason operated againsj, the name of Equisetum fluviatile ; al- 
though, it is allowed, that Mr. Newman was correct (according to 
strict rule) in making this transfer of the name from one species to 
another.
But the rule of priority is valuable only in its tendency to 
prevent confusion, and where strict adherence to it would increase 
confusion, there seemed sufficient reason for the departure from it.
Glyceria loliacea is a troublesome sort of plant, which comes near 
Triticum in technical character, while it agrees better with a section 
of the Linnasan genus Poa, in general habit.
In Steudel's Nomen- 
clator nine different names are recorded for it, and others could be 
1016 
added.
Hudson united it with tlie other Poas, under the name of 
Poa loliacea ; and Glyceria being a section of the genus Poa, the 
plant in question is called G.
loliacea in the London Catalogue.
In 
the Edinburgh Catalogue, further subdivisions of the old genus Poa 
were adopted, and this plant was associated with other species of Poa 
or Glyceria {S7?iith) under the name of Sclerochloa.
Thus, putting 
the two Catalogues in contrast, the increase of generic names was 
here made by the Edinburgh, not by the London Catalogue.
Without entering more into explanations relative to species singly, 
it may fairly be assumed, that the proper test of a publication like the 
London Catalogue, is to be found in its adaptation to the end for which 
it is published.
This Catalogue is expressly stated to have " been 
prepared chiefly with the object of giving increased facility in the 
exchanges of specimens, regularly carried on between the Botanical 
Society of London and its individual members." Some probability 
that it is adapted to such object, is implied in the fact of its distinc- 
tive peculiarities having been suggested by a botanist, who has had 
many years' experience in the exchange of specimens, both at home 
and abroad, and who was the first to bring such printed lists into use 
for the purposes of these exchanges, many years ago.
The most im- 
portant of the peculiarities which distinguish the London Catalogue 
from all its predecessors, is the attempt to show the comparative scar- 
city of each species, by means of the local Floras; and it is supposed 
that few persons will deny some usefulness in this innovation.
Secondly ; a distinction is made between species which probably 
can be obtained for exchange, and species which probably cannot be 
obtained ; and he must be a botanist of small experience who has not 
found the inconvenience of a list which includes (without distinction) 
the names of many species of which it is impossible to obtain British 
specimens.
Foreign botanists almost invariably ask for those species, 
and are disappointed when they receive a parcel without any of them.
Thirdly, the native and naturalized species are also distinguished ; 
the usefulness of such a distinction being practically admitted by the 
authors of our descriptive Floras, who latterly have done the same.
Useful though this be, every good botanist knows well that the dis- 
tinction cannot always be made with confidence.
Thus, Babington 
describes Chelidonium majus and Impatiens Noli-me-tangere as na- 
tive species ; yet Hooker marks the latter as a non -indigenous plant, 
and Henslow marks the former " possibly introduced by the agency 
of man." If Mr. Sidebotham can accomplish a task, only attempted 
by Smith, Hooker, Henslow, Babington, Watson and others, by all 
1017 
means let him perform the same, and make a " perfect " list of natu- 
ralized plants.
The continuous numbering of the specific names has been objected 
to, (Phytol.
933).
For an index to herbaria, in which each genus on- 
ly had a separate cover, the editorial preference for generic numbers 
would be judicious.
In a duplicate store on a large scale, it is found 
practically more convenient to have a separate cover for each species, 
with the numbers marked outside, for convenience of ready reference 
and arrangement ; since botanists apply for species and varieties, not 
tor genera.
The London Catalogue, like its predecessors, has faults, both ty- 
pographical and authorial ; and it has not the novelty which Mr.
Sidebotham would seem to give it credit for.
A well compiled (but 
anonymous) Catalogue of British Plants, in the natural arrangement, 
and with synonymes, was published some six or eight years ago ; 
which is still in print.

Tlie Nomenclature of Ferns in the ' British Flora ' and the 
' London Catalogue of British Plants.^ In your present number 
(Phytol.
497) a passage occurs, which is calculated to eenvey a wrong 
impression respecting the extent of dissimilarity between the names 
of ferns in the Flora and Catalogue.
The Filices and Pteroides (an 
abbreviation of Pteridioides â€” Fern-like) are grouped under twenty- 
two generic names in the Catalogue, twenty of which are identical 
with those in the ' British Flora.' Two other generic names are ne- 
cessarily added to the twenty, in consequence of two genera in the 
Flora being subdivided into four genera in the Catalogue.
Among 
fifty-seven specific names of the same plants in the Catalogue, forty- 
eight correspond Avith those of the British Flora.
Of the other nine 
specific names, five belong to additional species (or varieties " raised 
to the rank of species ") adopted from Mr. Newman and ' The Phyto- 
logist ; ' four only being changed names â€” Trichomanes speciosum, 
Lastraea spinosa, Equisetum Telraateia and E.
umbrosum.
The first 
of these four was adopted on the authority of Madeira specimens, 
collected and labelled by Dr. C.
Lemann, which appear connected 
with both forms of the Irish plant (speciosum and Andrewsii) through 
other specimens collected in the Azores.
The remaining three names 
were taken up on the faith of Mr. Newman's investigations, first pub- 
4(=i 
1018 
lishecl by that author, as I think, after the ' British Flora ' was out.
Though I do not know upon what authority the reviewer {loc.
cit.) 
has "fathered" the London Catalogue upon my "pen," it would now 
he useless to disavow any connexion between them.

BenlalVs Drying-paper.
I have tried the new paper manu- 
factured by Messrs.
Bentall of Halstead, for drying plants, by placing 
specimens of several kinds into it, and not again examining them un- 
til they became dry, and find that it is well deserving of commenda- 
tion.
The colours of the flowers and leaves are well preserved.
I 
placed eight thicknesses of paper between each layer of specimens.
This paper is fully as good as, if not better than, the "chalk-paper^'' 
employed here, which is so much esteemed as to have been sent to 
distant parts of the kingdom, and even to S.
America and Australia.

Note on Primula elatior.
I must request permission to enter 
a strong protest against Mr. Newman's endeavour (Phytol.
996) to 
give a new name to this plant ; not from any objection to paying the 
honour due to Jacquin for discriminating a true species amongst these 
variable plants ; but in order to prevent the addition of an unneces- 
sary synonym, and also because Jacquin is undoubtedly the first bo- 
tanist in modern times (that is since the time of Linnasus) who distin- 
guished the plant specifically, and had therefore a right to give it a 
name.
The P.
veris i3.
elatior (Linn.) may have been intended to in- 
clude Jacquin's plant, as well as the umbellate plants which connect 
the cowslip and primrose ; but as Linnaeus only employed the name 
to designate a variety, there was nothing to prevent Jacquin from giv- 
ing it to a species.
The question is not affected by Jacquin's belief 
or otherwise in the identity of his species and the Linnsean variety, 
for that is only an error in determining a synonym.
The confusion 
of which Mr. Newman justly complains, is not caused by the name 
of elatior being used specifically ; but by many British botanists ap- 
plying it to the " spurious oxlips " so often found in this country, and 
fancying that they are the species thus named.
It therefore becomes 
necessary to call it " Jacquin's oxlip," or that of " Bardfield," until 
English botanists learn to distinguish the true plant from the spurious 
one.
I trust to hear no more of P.
Jacqiiinii, Newman.
It may be 
as well to add that Professor Henslow finds the P.
elatior [Jacq.) in 
his parish of Hitcham, in Suffolk, from whence I possess specimens, 
by his kindness.

Note on Anthyllls viilneraria.
Mr. Greenwood's note (Phytol.
1000) has led me to examine the flowers of this plant, and I find that 
on the Cambridgeshire examples they are monadelphous.
One fila- 
ment is free at the base and summit, but quite joined to the other 
nine tliroughout most of its length, I hope Mr. Greenwood will care- 
fully re-examine his plant, and if it is really diadelphous, that he will 
allow me to examine a specimen of it.

Note on Botrydium graniilosmn, Grev.
Most of the shallower 
ponds in this neighbourhood have become dry from the long want of 
rain to replenish them, and this circumstance has brought to view the 
above curious little algoid plant, which I have often looked out for, 
but could never before meet with.
Walking with a friend from War- 
wickshire along the Henwick road near Worcester, the bed of a little 
pond opposite Henwick farm attracted our notice, as it appeared al- 
most as if covered with hoar frost, though on the morning of the 3rd 
of June, and as we trod on it, our ears were surprized with a crackling 
as if of icy particles.
On stooping down, however, I found that the 
whole bed of the pond was occupied by an aggregated growth of Bo- 
trydium granulosum, Grev., the rupture of whose globules caused the 
noise we heard, and the frosty appearance presented to view I found 
was occasioned by innumerable yar/wo^e granules that densely cover- 
ed the exterior of the green spheroidal vesicles forming the plant.
These exterior granules seem not to have been noticed by observers, 
though very conspicuous, unless Sir W.
J. Hooker alludes to them in 
his account of the Botrydium, where he says that " the membranous 
coat has internally a number of small granules," (Brit.
Flor.
ii.
321).
When the vesicles collapse and become cup-shaped, they then indeed 
appear superficially internal, but they cover all sides of the globule 
before the fluid within it is spent.
The size of the green spherical 
vesicles is subject to great diversity, as in all globular structures, be- 
ing very minute where they are crowded in their growth by pressing 
upon each other, averaging generally the size of a mustard-seed ; but 
when standing singly, nearly double that size, or as large as a cur- 
rant.
The}^ have rather a tough skin, for it requires some degree of 
pressure to burst them by the hand, though of course breaking, with 
a crackling noise, beneath the tread.
In general, the vesicles col- 
lapse without bursting, though when forced to do so, or when pricked 
with a needle, the included fluid is diffused externally, the skin sinks 
down, and the plant presents the appearance of a Peziza, or where 
there are many together, like the cells of a wasp's nest upon a small 
scale.
Having at the time only a pamphlet to put my specimens in.
1020 
they were rather pressed before I returned home, and by the next 
morning, all the globules bad collapsed, and their contents having 
dried up, the residuum appeared in the form of a green powder dif- 
fused upon the paper â€” doubtless the fructifying sporules of the Bo- 
trydium.
This reproductive economy seems not to agree very well 
with the filamentose Vaucherise with which the present plant is asso- 
ciated, but rather suggests a closer relation to the Fungi, or at least 
the Nostochinese, Its appearance probably depends on meteoric cir- 
cumstances, in consequence of which it is seldom to be met with, and 
its existence even under favourable coincidences is but of short du- 
ration.
The exposed bottoms of ditches in the present dry summer 
may possibly reveal the Botrydium in various localities to the Cryp- 
togamic botanist ; and having been thus enabled to note it, and as, 
according to Hooker, " few localities are published," I have thought 
it might be interesting to bring it forward again under the eye of the 
observer.

Note on the habitat of (Enanthe pimpinelloides.
In the re- 
port of the proceedings of the Edinburgh Botanical Society (Phytol.
1005), I notice a statement by Mr, Ball, enumerating three British 
species of GEnanthe, and remarking, that Oil. pimpinelloides is very 
rare, the author having seen only one specimen, gathered by me at 
Fortharapton, Gloucestershire.
I should rather say the plant was of 
uncertain occurrence than very rare ; as for three years that I resided 
at Forthampton, it was so plentiful in the two orchards adjoining 
Forthampton cottage, as to form no inconsiderable portion of the hay 
of those pastures, which are on rising ground, ascending towards 
some of the highest land in the parish, and the soil a dry, hard, red 
marl.
I have not had an opportunity of inspecting the spot this year.
Last season, the plant was very abundant in several meadows at Po- 
wick, whei-e I am now unable to find a single specimen.
These mea- 
dows were dry and hilly.
I know nothing about OE.
Lachenalii, 
v/hich Mr. Babington describes, though omitting QE.
pimpinelloides ; 
but there is some discrepancy which requires correction, as to the 
habitat of the latter.
This is stated by Sir W.
J. Hooker, Smith, and 
I believe most if not all authorities, to grow in " salt marshes," while 
CE.
peucedanifolia is said to be found in " fresh water." This is cer- 
tainly a mistake.
I have never observed CE.
pimpinelloides except 
in inland places, on hilly, and often the nery driest ground of the 
neighbourhood ; while as constantly do T find CE.
peucedanifolia in 
marshy places, whether of fresh or salt water.
Last year, when on 
the coasts of Devon and South Wales, I was very attentive to this cir- 
1021 
cumstance ; but the species growing in the Httoral marshes there in- 
variably proved to be QL.
peiicedanifoha.
The latter I also found, 
this spring, growing plentifully in a wet part of the island pasture 
called the Severn Ham, at Tewkesbury, Gloucestershire.
The sphe- 
rical knobs on the roots of CE.
pimpinelloides, extending some dis- 
tance from the plant, are very characteristic when contrasted with the 
elliptical sessile knobs of (E, peucedanifolia, and I have found them 
pleasantly edible.
They are not represented iu the 'English Botany' 
figure.
It is indispensible to examine the roots, for the radical leaves 
of CE.
pimpinelloides soon wither, and then the plant, without very 
close investigation, can scarcely be distinguished from CK.
peuceda- 
nifolia.

Note on Carex paradoxa ?
While consulting Hooker's ' Com- 
panion to the Botanical Magazine' on another subject, a few days 
ago, I met with the following passage in Mr. Woods' interesting ac- 
count of a ' Botanical Excursion in the North of England,' in 1835.
As it relates to plants which have recently caused a good deal of dis- 
cussion, I think it entitled to a place in ' The Phytologist.' Mr.
Woods says : â€” " Rosa Doniana grows at the top of a woody bank a 
little above Croft, on the Yorkshire side of the river [Tees] ; and near 
Halnaby, on the same side, there is a small strip of boggy ground, 
mostly covered with brush-wood, on the left hand of the road from 
Croft, which affords Ranunculus Lingua, and a Carex, which is per- 
haps a small variety of C.
paniculata, but not forming dense tufts, and 
therefore in some degree approaching to C.
teretiuscula.
The beak 
also is not abrupt, as described in C.
paniculata, but tapers gradually 
from the fruit.
Hooker (Brit.
Fl. ed.
3. p.
395) mentions a continen- 
tal species, C.
paradoxa, which is intermediate between these two.
That species, however, is described as forming very large and dense 
tufts (see Gaudin, Fl. Helv.
6. 43), and therefore can have nothing to 
do with this plant.
Some difficulty has arisen from the figure of C.
teretiuscula in ' English Botany,' where the scales are altogether 
brown, whereas, according to Gaudin, /.
c. the scales of C.
teretiuscu- 
la in a young state have uniformly a whitish border.
In my plant 
they have a pretty wide scariose margin." Which of the two plants 
can this be â€” C.
paradoxa, which is now known to grow in another 
part of Yorkshire, or the variety of C.
teretiuscula?
Will Mr. Woods 
kindly examine his specimens, and favour the readers of ' The Phy- 
tologist ' with the resvdt.
Or the plant may be still growing in the 
locality where Mr. Woods met with it, and may perhaps be found by 
1022 
other botanists.

Mr. Edmonston has been so long and so honourably known as

â€” Notice of ' The London Journal of Botany,'' By 
Sir W.
J. Hooker, K.H., LL.D., F.R.A.
& L.S., &c.
No. 30, 
June, 1844.
London : Bailliere, Regent St.
In a notice of the ' London Catalogue of British Plants,' in the 
June number of the ' London Journal of Botany,' we find some ob- 
servations on the review of Mr. Newman's ' History of British Ferns ' 
which lately appeared in our pages (Phytol.
945).
These observa- 
tions appear to require from us something in the shape of explana- 
tion ; we shall therefore, in the first place, lay before our readers the 
whole of the observations referred to, and then, in all due courtesy, 
proceed to offer a few remarks upon such parts as seem to be not en- 
tirely consistent with facts.* 
Speaking of the ' Edinburgh Catalogue of British Plants,' the edi- 
of the Journal proceeds : â€” 
" Nevertheless, as being the fullest ' Catalogue of British Plants ' extant at the 
time of the publication of the 5th edition of the ' British Flora,' the author of that 
work deemed it entitled to quotation among the synonymes, ' as one in which especial 
pains appear to have been taken to form a complete list of the native flowering plants 
and ferns of Great Britain.' This little compliment, paid to to the labours of those 
v^rho compiled the Catalogue, has been strangely made the subject of censure in a re- 
cent number of the ' Phytologist,' (a work not always distinguished by courtesy of 
style) ; where, after speaking of the * Nomenclature ' of Mr. Edward Newman, as em- 
ployed in the first edition of his ' History of British Ferns,' and promulgated in 1839- 
40, â€” the reviewer assures us, ' there was a general denunciation of changes so radical 
and so complete;' but, after the appearance of Mr. John Smith's paper on the same 
subject, ' Botanists, who one month proclaimed the absurdity of Mr. Newman's inno- 
* The editor thinks it right to state that he is not the author of the review com- 
mented upon in the ' London Journal of Botany." It was written and sent for inser- 
tion by a correspondent, who has paid great attention to the British Ferns.
1023 
valions, were seen the following month bending the supple knee to the same innova- 
tions ; ' and ' Dr. Balfour and Mr. Bahington, by adopting the alterations, were the 
means of disseminating them from John o'Groats to the Land's End.' It seems tlie 
author of the British Flora did not bend the supple knee to tlie innovations, and the 
reviewer proceeds : ' But in the midst of its successful career, the new nomenclature 
met a most decided check in the publication of the fifth edition of Sir W.
J. Hooker's 
British Flora, wherein we were astonished to find the changes introduced by Mr. New- 
man, not on\j fathered upon the authors of the ' Edinburgh Catalogue,^ but the new 
names given as synonymes, and the old nomenclature restored in all its glori/." â€” p.
290.
To the above passage is appended the following long foot-note.
" It is far from being our general intention to notice remarks made in reviews of 
Books : but the Editor of this Journal, as the Author of the ' British Flora,'' must in 
justice to himself declare that he is not aware that he has in any way acted unfairly 
by Mr. Newman.
He presumes by the expression of ' fathering the changes introdu- 
ced by Mr. Newman upon the authors of the Edinburgh Catalogue,' it is meant to 
imply that he has given to those gentlemen a credit for names (' a nomenclature ') 
which is due to Mr. Newman alone.
But surely no one will consider that to be the 
case, who has seen the little explanation in the preftice to the British Flora, (ed.
5, p.
viii.).
It was never meant to imply that the Editors of the Catalogue were the 
authors of those names : and really upon looking at the places among the Ferns where 
the ' Edinb.
Cat.' is quoted, the difference of names is so trifling that it is marvellous 
how such a charge could, in fairness, any way be made.
One would suppose that by 
' the old nomenclature being restored in all its glory,' that the author had gone back 
to the days of Dillenius and Ray ; but, so far at least as the Edinburgh Catalogue is 
concerned, the difference of names, ' fathered ' upon the Edinb.
Cat., which Mr. New- 
man's reviewer claims for hin), and in the British Flora, amounts to these.
In the 
latter work, the genus Aspidium of Swartz is divided into two sections ; 1st.
those spe- 
cies with orbicular involucres, fixed by the centre {Aspidium, Br.), and 2ndly.
those 
with reniform involucres, fixed by the sinus, {Nephrodium, Rich, Br.) The first are 
called Polystichum in the Edinburgh Catalogue, while the latter are called Lastraa ; 
and in the genus Asplenium, as defined in British Flora, 2 species {A.
Filix fcemina, 
and A.
fontanum), are, in the Edinb.
Cat., called Athyrium,.
Cryptogramma of Brown 
and Hook, is called Allosorus in the Ed. Cat.
; Blechnum boreale, Sw., is called Lo- 
maria Spicant, and Trichomanes brevisetum, Br. and Hook, is the T.
speciosum in Ed.
Cat. Now the whole of these changes (we are not discussing the merits or correct- 
ness of the names) no more originated with Mr. Newman, they are no more his origi- 
nal ' nomenclature,' which is declared ' to be toto ccelo at variance with that so long in 
use,' than they did with the authors of the Edinburgh Catalogue.
The genus Poly, 
stichum was invented by Roth in the year 1800, and is absolutely identical with Aspi- 
dium, as it stands in the British Flora ; including both Polystichum and Lastraa of 
the Edinburgh Catalogue.
Lustra originated in M.
Bory de St. Vincent in 1824, and 
was formed to include the Polypodia !
Oreopteris, Thelypteris and unitum.
Presl in 
1836 altered the character, to make it comprise certain Aspidiaceous plants, banished 
all Bory's species, and was the author of the names of the Lastrcea as they stand in the 
Edinb.
Cat. Athyrium also is a genus of Roth (1800), adopted (in part by Presl), and 
the species above mentioned are of the same antiquity.
We are well aware that Cryp- 
togramma crispa, Br. is the Allosorus of Bernhardi, (1806) ; but the Cheilanthes odora.
1024 
Sw. is the plant which Bemhardi seems to have had in view in constituting that ge- 
nus ; and Presl has not improved the genus by the heterogeneous species he has mix- 
ed up with it, and which have little in common with the plant in question.
So long 
ago as 1810, Mr. Brown expressed his opinion that Blechnum boreale might perhaps 
he referred to his Stegania (Lomaria, Willd.) ; and in 1811, Desvaux named it Loma- 
ria Spicant.
Our view of the fructification differs from that of these authors, aud we 
have not preserved the name of Swartz without stating reasons for it, and giving a fi- 
gure, which in our mind, at least, confirms those views, (see Brit.
Fl. ed.
5, Tab. X.
f. 10.) With regard to Mr. Brown's name of Tricliomanes brevisetum, we may here 
extract what is hut just printed respecting it in the ' Species Filicujn,' p.
126, where 
the author expresses his regret that he was under the necessity of occupying so much 
space in his attempt to unravel the difficulties which have always attended the synon- 
ymy of this plant, and respecting which Sir Jas. E.
Smith (whose writings on the 
Ferns the reviewer, in the ' Fhytologist,' treats with marked contempt), said, nearly 
thirty years ago, that ' few plants of almost any country have caused more enquiry, or 
more diversity of opinion, than this Fern.' Unquestionably the T.
speciosum of Willd.
is the same species as our T.
brevisetum, though a native of Teueriffe ; and, as such, 
the name has the right of priority over that of Mr. Brown ; but after a most careful 
investigation of other specimens of Trichomanes, and especially the T.
radicans of 
Swartz, from Jamaica, we must declare ourselves at issue with the reviewer in ques- 
tion, who, notwithstanding that * Mr. J.
Smith had labelled a var.
of the Irish T.
spe- 
ciosum, lately discovered by Mr. Andrews, as T.
radicans, Sw.
; ' nevertheless ' thinks 
Mr. Newman has exercised a sound discretion in keejjing the name of T.
radicans 
quite out of view.' The author of the ' Species Filicum ' has come to a difi'erent con- 
clusion, and having satisfied himself of their identity, ventures to retain the name of 
radicans.
It might be supposed that the reviewer was of the same mind when he says, 
(Phytol.
p. 956), ' it was held to be impossible that a tropical plant should exist in 
Ireland.' He surely does not take Teneriife and Madeira, the recorded habitats of 
T. speciosum, to be within the tropics.
Let it be observed that Mr. Newman gives no 
authority for the genera Polystichum and Lastrcea in his Synoptical Table of British 
Ferns, p.
6, but he informs us (p.
8) that these ' have not been employed by any pre- 
vious writer on the British Ferns.' 
" One word on another remarkable passage of the reviewer, who pronounces Mr. J.
Smith's Arrangement of the genera of Ferns as ' perhaps the most profound and use- 
ful treatise ever presented to the Linneean Society.' Knowing, as the Editor of this 
Journal does, the character of Mr. J.
Smith, and his love of truth, he hesitates not to 
say that such an overstrained compliment will be far from gratifying to him.
Of the 
merits of his Memoir, the Editor entertains a very high opinion, and of his judgment 
in discriminating types of genera or subgenera, and it has been held a privilege to af- 
ford publicity to that very paper in the pages of this work; and further, to give figures 
of Mr. Smith's new genera (see ' Genera Filicum,^ passim) : but great as is his merit 
in the 'Arrangement,' now mentioned, it rises much higher in our esteem on account 
of the candour with which he speaks of his predecessor in the same line ; and it de- 
tracts nothing from Mr. Smith's merit that Presl was his predecessor in these innova- 
tions, for the two writers worked wholly independently of eacn other.
" I had nearly,'' 
says Mr. J.
Smith, " completed my arrangement, when I received a copy of Presl's 
' Tentamen Pteridigraphias,' a work published at Prague in 1836, but not seen by me 
till 1838.
That author's opinions so nearly coincided with mine, that it might seem 
1025 
as if a communication of ideas had passed between us ; but, after allowing liim due 
credit for his labours, I must still continue to differ from him in a number of impor- 
tant points; yet in order to avoid adding synonymous generic names, I have revised 
my original ones, and in all cases, where Presl's character of his genera are conform- 
able to my view, I have adopted his names.' " 
In the following remarks we shall confine ourselves as much as 
possible lo the plain factfi of the case, without in general attempting 
any explanation of the review^er's opinions.
We will also endeavour 
to follow the order of the editor's strictures.
First, then, with regard to the "little compliment" said to be made 
the subject of the reviewer's censure.
We do not clearly perceive in 
what way the simple statement of a fact can be construed into cen- 
sure.
That the payment of this " /////e compliment" has been in 
some degree censured in preceding pages of ' The Phytologist,' we 
are willing to admit ; but in the passage alluded to we must confess 
ourselves unable to discover the censure complained of.
When the 
5th edition of the 'British Flora,' was announced, the botanists of this 
country naturally looked forward to its appearance with a hope that 
the author would gladly embrace the favourable opportunity of rais- 
ing the Botany of Britain to something like a level with the state of 
the science on the continent.
This, the author of the 'British Flora,' 
from his eminent attainments in the science, his almost unequalled 
store of materials, and his exalted station, was certainly well qualified 
to accomplish, and was no more than the botanists of Britain had a 
right to expect fi-om him.
His labour, too, would have been rendered 
less onerous, from the publication of the ' Edinburgh Catalogue of 
British Plants,' " in which especial pains had been taken," not only 
" to form a complete list of the native flowering plants and ferns of 
Great Britain," but also (and this surely is a point of equal impor- 
tance), " as far as possible to make the nomenclature of British plants 
correspond with that adopted by the best continental authors." And 
in endeavouring to effect this object, the compilers of the Catalogue 
were " guided in their amendments chiefly by the works of DeCan- 
dolle, Koch, Nees von Eseubeck, Kunth and Leighton." However, 
when the 5th edition of the ' British Flora ' appeared, great was the 
disappointment of our botanists to find that very little more had been 
done in its preparation, than to prefix a Linnaean index or key, to 
adopt the natural arrangement for the body of the work, in place of 
that of the Linnaean artificial system which had been used in the pre- 
ceding editions, and to add a few explanatory plates at the end : 
4 R 
1026 
while, so far as nomenclature and characters were concerned, the work 
remained almost in statu quo.
In the Edinburgh Catalogue, when the name of a genus or species 
was changed, the compilers paid the author of the ' British Flora ' 
the compliment of giving a reference to the name under which it ap- 
peared in the fourth edition of that work.
In a mere Catalogue of 
names no more than this could be looked for.
But, in a standard 
work like the ' British Flora,' if the author saw reason not to adopt 
the changes proposed in the Edinburgh Catalogue, we have always 
held the opinion, and in this we are not alone, that if he thought fit 
to notice the Catalogue at all, he was bound to pay the compilers a 
higher compliment than the somewhat equivocal one of merely deem- 
ing it " entitled to quotation among the synonyms," and that, too, 
simply on the ground of especial pains appearing to have been taken 
to render it a complete list of British plants.
The compilers of the 
Catalogue, having endeavoured to place the nomenclature of British 
plants on a sounder basis than before, we consider that the least that 
could have been expected, if their changes were not adopted, was that 
the reasons for their rejection should have been stated; and such rea- 
sons, coming from the author of the ' British Flora,' would have been 
received with all the deference and respect to which, emanating from 
such a quarter, they were fairly entitled.
The rejection of these pro- 
posed changes without such reasons being adduced, has been the on- 
ly ground for censure on this subject, which may at any time have 
been expressed in our pages.
But, it may be asked, what has all this to do with the question at 
issue between the editor of the ' London Journal of Botany ' and the 
reviewer of Newman's ' History of British Ferns.' ?
We answer, â€” 
Much every way !
â€” inasmuch as among the rejected changes in no- 
menclature were several relating to British ferns, which, having pre- 
viously been proposed and introduced by Mr. Newman, were thought 
worthy of adoption by the compilers of the Edinburgh Catalogue.
We advisedly say, introduced by Mr. Newman â€” not invented; for 
nowhere in his ' History of British Ferns,' does he claim for himself 
the merit of having invented a single name.
And in blaming the 
reviewer for claiming for Mr. Newman the merit of having originated 
or invented " a nomenclature," we cannot help thinking that the 
editor has been fighting with a shadow of his own raising.
We now pass on to the editor's declaration, that he is not aware of 
having in any way acted unfairly by Mr. Newman.
Previously, per- 
haps not ; but in the foot-note above quoted, and in one paragraph 
1027 
more especially, we fancy we discover such symptoms of unfair deal- 
ing, that we cannot let slip this opportunity of endeavouring to place 
the matter in its true light.
After enumerating the discrepancies between the Edinb.
Catalogue 
and the 5th edition of the ' British Flora,' the editor continues : â€” 
" Now the whole of these changes, * * no more originated 
with Mr. Newman, they are no more his original " nomenclature," 
* * than they did with the authors of the Edinburgh Cata- 
logue.* Now upon an impartial examination of the review, we cannot 
perceive that the reviewer anywhere claims for Mr. Newman the me- 
rit of having originated this " nomenclature," and certainly Mr. New- 
man nowhere claims it for himself, as we think we shall presently be 
able to prove, from the evidence kindly laid before us by the editor 
himself.
With a few exceptions, the editor might have found nearly all that 
he has said on the authorship of certain genera, in the ' History of 
British Ferns ' itself.
For instance, he says that " The genus Po- 
ly stichnm was invented by Roth in the year 1800, and is absolutely 
identical with Aspidium, as it stands in the British Flora !
including 
both Polystichum and Lastraa of the Edinburgh Catalogue." So far 
the editor; now for Mr. Newman.
At p.
36 (ed.
1) of his History, 
under Polystichum aculeatum, he says, " This genus was established 
by Koth, and has been adopted by DeCandolle and Schott ; " and 
the following passage occurs at p.
11, 2nd edition, " Genus Polysti- 
chum, Roth.
Involucre attached by its centre.
This genus includes 
all the species I have placed under Lastraja ; it was first restricted 
by Schott to the congeners of Roth's typical species â€” Lonchitis." If 
now we turn to p.
1(36 of the 2nd edition of the History, we find a 
passage bearing a remarkable family likeness to the above quotation 
from the editor's foot-note.
" The genus Polystichum was establish- 
ed by Roth in his ' Flora Germanica,' in 1800, and is so far synony- 
mous with Swartz's genus Aspidium, published in the same year, that 
both included a long list of the same species." 
The editor proceeds : â€” " Lastrrea originated in M.
Bory de St.
Vincent in 1824, and was formed to include the Polypodia!
Oreopte- 
ris, Thclypteris and unitum.
Presl in 1836 altered the character, to 
make it comprise certain Aspidiaceous plants, banished all Bory's 
species, and was the author of the names of the Lastraea as they stand 
* It will be seen on a reference to tbe original, that the sense and bearing- of tlio 
passages here quoted are in no wise a fleeted by the omissions.
1028 
in the Edinb.
Cat.'" With reference to this passage we would ask, if 
Presl " banished all Bory's species," how it happens that Oreopteris 
and Thelypteris are retained, not only in the Edinburgh Catalogue, 
but also in Presl's own Tentamen ?
For in the latter, we find The- 
lypteris and Oreopteris holding the second and third places in his 
Â§.
2, Thelypteris.
In his Synopsis, ed.
2, Mr. Newman gives Bory 
as the authority for the genus: while at p.
185 of his History, ed.
2, 
under L.
Thelypteris, he states that " Botanists seem scarcely agreed 
as to the genus to which this fern should be referred.
Presl places it 
in Bory's genus Lastrsea ; Schott constitutes a genus (Thelypteris) pur- 
posely to receive it, and gives to the species the name of palustris; and 
Sir W.
J. Hooker, in the fifth edition of his ' British Flora,' makes it 
an Aspidium : thus we have three of the highest, as well as most re- 
cent authorities, completely at issue on the question." 
Next with regard to Athyrium.
The editor's words are these : â€” 
"Athyrium also is a genus of Roth, (1800), (adopted in part by Presl), 
and the species above mentioned [.?
A. Filix femina and fontanum] are 
of the same antiquity." At p.
61, Mr. Newman says: â€” " In opposi- 
tion to the views of many eminent botanists, I feel inclined to return 
the Lady fern to the genus Athyrium of Roth, which I think must al- 
so include the Allantodia australis of Brown, I doubt whether I can 
agree with Presl in placing Aspleuium Halleri and fontanum in the 
same group." 
With respect to Allosorus, the editor observes, " We are well aware 
that Crjptogramma crispa Br. is the Allosorus of Bernhardi, (1806) ; 
but the Cheilanlhes odora, Sw. is the plant which Bernhardi seems 
to have had in view in constituting the genus ; " Mr. Newman, " It 
[A.
crispus] has by three eminent botanists been made the type of a 
new genus ; viz.
by Bernhardi, under the name Allosorus ; by Des- 
veux, under the name Phorobolus ; and by Brown, imder the name 
Cryptogramma The name I have adopted has the claim of priority." 
â€”p.
17.
. And lastly, with regard to Lomaria : the editor says " So long ago 
as 1810, Mr. Brown expressed his opinion that Blechnum boreale 
might perhaps be referred to his Stegania (Lomaria, Willd.) ;" and 
in his Synopsis Mr. Newman says of Stegania, " Apparently identical 
with Lomaria." 
We have been thus particular in quoting parallel passages, in or- 
der to show that Mr. Newman was careful to give the authorities for 
the generic names employed by him.
To this we shall presently 
return .
1029 
As we do not feel disposed to lengthen this article by entering up- 
on the discussion of the question of identity of Trichomanes specio- 
sum, &c., we will now proceed to analyze what we cannot but look 
upon as an unfair attempt on the part of the editor, to fix upon Mr.
Newman the intention of appropriating the authorship of genera to 
which he had no claim.
At the end of the first paragraph of the foot- 
note quoted above, and so far removed fi'om any obseiTations to 
which it could with propriety belong, as to have the appearance of 
an afterthought â€” a capital hit, too good to be lost, â€” will be found the 
following passage.
" Let it be observed that Mr. Newman gives no 
authority for the genera Polystichum and Lastrgea in his Synoptical 
Table of British Ferns, p.
6, but he informs us (p.
8) that these " have 
not been employed by any previous writer on the British Ferns." â€” 
Now, looking on this passage as it stands here, we ask, would not any 
one understand it as implying that Mr. Newman thereby intended to 
appropriate to himself the honour of founding these two genera } On 
turning however to the page indicated (in the 1st edition, though not 
so stated by the editor) we were grieved to find a most paljDable in- 
stance of suppressio vert â€” of stating the truth, but not the tvhole 
truth â€” which we must consider somewhat uncandid, to say the least 
of it.
The whole passage, fairly quoted, is this.
" The name follow- 
ing the genus is that of a British [so in the original] author who has 
employed it.
The genera, for which no authority is given, have not 
been employed by any previous writer on the British Ferns.
The 
works in which the genera will be found are these," &c., followed by 
the names of the British authors referred to with the titles of their 
works.
It will be seen that the omission of the first sentence by the 
editor, materially alters the sense ; and, coupled as this is with his 
own remarks, so emphatically introduced by " Let it be observed " !
we must suppose that the editor wished it to be understood as every 
person would be sure to understand it, without referring to the ' His- 
tory of British Ferns' for the key.
We cannot, however, comprehend 
why Pohstichum and Lastrcea alone should have been selected as ex- 
amples of Mr. Newman's aptitude for genus-making, seeing that Cys- 
topteris â€” the genus immediately preceding the chosen ones â€” is in 
the same category, being, like them, without any authority in the Sy- 
noptical Table.
We could easily extend these remarks to a much greater length, 
but by this time our readers must be heartily tired of the subject.
Claiming indulgence therefore for a few observations on the last pa- 
ragraph of the footnote, we will afterwards conclude.
1030 
Every one who has the pleasure of being acquainted with Mr. J.
Smith, must entertain the highest regard for that gentleman, both on 
account of his extensive knowledge of Botany, the modesty by which 
his attainments are veiled, and his readiness to impart information.
Mr. Smith's candour, too, in speaking of his predecessor's labours, is 
well known.
Why, therefore, the word candour should have been 
printed in ominous italics, we cannot divine, unless, indeed it be in- 
tended to imply that there has been a want of candour on the part of 
some other party " in the same line." Now, coupling this with the 
preceding remarks on Mr. Newman, w^e must suppose that the inten- 
tion of the editor has been to charge that gentleman with a want of 
candour in speaking of the labours of his predecessors.
We fearless- 
ly invite any unprejudiced individual to examine Mr. Newman's His- 
tory of British Ferns, either the 1st or 2nd edition, and point out, if 
he can, a single instance in which Mr. N.
has omitted to speak with 
candour of his predecessors " in the same line," or neglected to ac- 
knowledge the source from which any portion of his information has 
been derived.
More than this, we again assert that Mr. Newman has 
in no case claimed the merit of having invented the generic names 
used by him in his History ; and as a proof of his candour, we will 
conclude the subject by quoting from the ' History of British Ferns,' 
a parallel passage to that given by the editor from the writings of Mr.
J. Smith.
" Mr. Smith, of the Royal Botanic Garden at Kew, has paid great 
attention to the venation of Ferns ; he has prepared an essay on this 
subject, which 1 trust we shall shortly see in print.
* * 
Mr. Smith having, in the most unreserved manner, communicated to 
me his own ideas on the subject of arrangement and nomenclature, I 
was delighted to find, that, with very few exceptions, our views were 
similar : in one or two instances I was obviously wrong, and in these 
instances I was too glad to have the opportunity of rectifying my er- 
rors by the aid of his superior knowledge of exotic genera.
In a few 
instances we still differ, and in announcing this, I fear I shall be con- 
sidered as pronouncing my own condemnation : still I venture to pur- 
sue my way, and ' by an earlier appearance in the literary horizon, 
give myself the chance of what the astronomers call an Heliacal ris- 
ing, before the luminary in whose light I am to be lost shall appear.' 
" In making out my list of genera I have followed no other rule 
than that of priority ; and if, in any instance, I have departed from 
this rule, the departure has been entirely unintentional, and I shall 
1031 
be glad to be informed, in order that I may take an early opportunity 
of correcting my error." â€” p.
3, 1st edition.
Surely there is no want of candour here ; whatever instances of it 
the editor may fancy he has perceived in other parts of Mr. Newman's 
writings !
In concluding these remarks, penned " more in sorrow than in an- 
ger," we must express our regret that the editor of the 'London Jour- 
nal of Botany ' should have taken a step which we cannot but look 
upon as one unworthy the position he holds among botanists.
We 
considered it due to the editor of the Journal to give insertion in our 
pages to the whole of his strictures, and no less due to our readers 
and to ourselves, to make an attempt to clear up certain passages in 
the extracts, which might tend to convey erroneous impressions; and 
having done this, we bid farewell to an unpleasant task.

â€” Proceedings of Societies.
BOTANICAL SOCIETY OF LONDON.
June 7, 1844.
â€” J.
Reynolds, Esq., Treasurer, in the chair.
Specimens of Qilnanthe peucedanifolia and CE.
pimpinelloides were 
exhibited, accompanied by notices of their distinctive characters and 
habitats ; by Edwin Lees, Esq., F.L.S. Much uncertainty and con- 
fusion having prevailed among British authors and distributors, in 
regard to the distinctions between these species, the views of Mr. L,, 
founded on good opportunities for observation, are deserving of parti- 
cular attention.
The following condensed abstract will explain the 
conclusions formed by this botanist.
First.~QE.
peucedanifolia always grows in wet places, and is found 
both by salt and fresh water ; while OS.
pimpinelloides is found in 
dry ground only.
Secondly.
â€” The characters derived from the form of the radical 
leaves, and the presence or absence of an involucrum, will not prove 
sufficient to prevent confusion ; but the rounded tubercles upon the 
roots of GE.
pimpinelloides, will readily serve to distinguish that spe- 
cies from QE.
peucedanifolia, in which the tubercles are elongate and 
sessile.
Thirdly.
â€” There is some difference in the fruit of the two species, 
though the materials in the possession of Mr. L.
are not sufficient to 
state this with precision and certainty.
1032 
Mr. L.
thus attaches the first importance to the form of the root, 
as a distinctive character, and the circumstance should instruct col- 
lectors to be mindful of the value of the root.
Specimens collected by Mr. L.
afforded the principal reason for re- 
taining CE.
pimpinelloides as a British species, in the London Cata- 
logue, in preference to the adoption of Mr. Babington's change to CE.
Lachenalii ; and one of the same specimens communicated to Mr.
Ball, induced that excellent botanist to admit CE.
pimpinelloides as 
well as CE.
Lachenalii among the indigenous species, (Phytol.
1005).
Three species, not two only, should therefore now be looked for, and 
the confusion and uncertainty may thus be removed.
Most of the specimens hitherto sent to the Society have proved 
quite useless through the absence of roots and fruit, but it is earnest- 
ly requested by the Council, that contributors will collect specimens, 
with root and fruits from as many localities as possible.
Some highly interesting examples of the Irish Saxifrages, belong- 
ing to Haworth's genus Robertsonia, were exhibited from Mr. An- 
drews, w^ho had obligingly sent living plants as well as dried speci- 
mens.
Two of the specimens were sent in record of the fact, lately 
doubted or denied by the accurate Mr. C.
C. Babington, that the Py- 
renean forms of S.
umbrosa and S.
Geum (with crenate leaves), are 
certainly native in Ireland ; the specimen of S.
Geum, indeed, being 
considered " even more obtusely crenate than Mr. Babington's figure 
(No. 8) from the Pyrenean plant." These specimens were collected 
" this year, from the mountains to the south of Brandon mountain, 
County of Kerry." 
S. hirsuta is considered by Mr. Andrews to be a hybrid form be- 
tween S.
Geum and S.
umbrosa, " as many of the varieties present 
characters leaning either more or less to the one species or the other." 
S. elegans is deemed by Mr. A.
to be simply a variety of S.
umbrosa.
And after careful examination of the forms of S.
hypnoides, he is now 
" satisfied that S.
affinis, incurvifolia, hirta and palmata are all mere 
varieties, or indeed, barely deserving the name of varieties."

Bartramia calcarea., Bruch & Schimper.
For two or three years past additions have been made to our Mus- 
cology, with a rapidity truly surprizing, when we consider how tho- 
4 S 
1034 
roughly our mosses were believed to have been explored by the many 
eminent cultivators of that branch of Botany, in this country.
That 
several of these so called new species will turn out merely varieties of 
well known plants, there can, I fear, be little doubt ; but that a very 
considerable proportion are really and bona fide good species, I am 
equally convinced.
Those two eminent botanists, Drs. Hooker and Taylor, the authors 
of the well known ' Muscologia Britannica,' a work which is deserv- 
edly held in high repute, differed so widely, and in many cases so 
judiciously, from the great majority of continental botanists, espe- 
cially Bridel and Schwsegrichen, regarding the limits of species and 
the value to be attached to distinctive marks, that for the most part 
British muscologists were content to take the species as they found 
them in the 'Muscologia,' without at all referring to continental 
works, in which, apparently, so many spurious species existed.
Lately, however, the splendid ' Bryologia Europsea ' of two German 
botanists â€” Bruch and Schimper, has been much consulted by our 
muscologists, and I fear we are likely to go just as far into the oppo- 
site extreme of hair-splitting.
Undoubtedly, many of the plants 
described as distinct in the Bryologia, are mere forms of others, and 
occasionally the variations are so slight, that we cannot help regret- 
ting that such trivial characters are employed in so valuable a work.
Yet still, in my opinion, and in that of many far better botanists, the 
authors of the work in question are entitled to great praise for their 
acuteness and discrimination in distinguishing many species undoubt- 
edly distinct, but which had been hitherto confounded.
The species 
above figured is one of these.
It was, I believe, first clearly describ- 
ed as British by Mr. Spruce, in a very interesting paper on the mosses 
of Teesdale, in the 'Annals of Natural History,' xiii.
197.
Having 
lately gathered most beautiful specimens of this splendid moss, on the 
banks of the Findhorn, near Darnaway, about three miles from Forres, 
Morayshire, where it grows plentifully associated with Bryum ventri- 
cosum, Marchantia hemisphserica, and Asplenium viride, â€” I have 
been led to examine it more particularly, and the result is, that I 
think it a very distinct plant, and constant to its characters, which 
are abundantly sufficient to keep it separate from Bartramia fontana, 
with which it has hitherto been confounded.
And 1 am induced to 
trouble the readers of ' The Phytologist ' with a sketch and short de- 
scription of it.
Bartramia calcarea, Bruch & Schimper.
Stems four to six inches 
or more in height, densely caespitose, copiously branched with inno- 
1035 
vations, and bearing the setae, and frequently the withered capsules, 
of one or two preceding years, remaining upon the lower part of the 
stem.
Leaves all falcato - secvmd, lanceolate - acuminate, sharply 
toothed in their upper half; nerve strong, reaching to the summit of 
the leaf.
Seta fi-equently, but not invariably, lateral from the inno- 
vations.
Capsule slightly inclined, globose (narrower and nioi'e curved 
after the plant has been dried) ; lid conical.
The capsules on my specimens, though fully grown, were too young 
to afford a satisfactory analysis of the peristome ; neither was I so for- 
tunate as to find the male flowers.
In both the peristome and the 
leaves of the perichsetia of the male flowers, characters are said to be 
found.
I found the latter in fine state on B.
fontana [true], and can 
verify Mr. Spruce's observations, as to the inner leaves of the perigo- 
nia in that plant being " obtuse, with an abbreviated or obsolete 
nerve;" the nerve in fact is scarcely discernible.
In B.
calcarea the 
leaves are said to be " all acuminate and nerved throughout." 
The most apparent points of difference between this plant and the 
true B.
fontana, are to be found in the leaves being broader (ovato- 
acuminate) and erecto-patent, imbricated on all sides (not at all se- 
cund); the capsule in B.
calcarea is also more decidedly globose, and 
scarcely so inclined ; it is also less deeply furrowed, and the whole 
plant is larger.
These characters, and a glance at the figures, will, I 
think, convince the most sceptical of the great difference between the 
two plants.
This difference is fully greater than between B.
pomi- 
formis and Halleriana or ithyphylla ; and if the characters are not 
deemed suflScient to allow the plant to rank as a species, I am at a 
loss to conceive how Andrsea nivalis is to be distinguished fi-om A.
Rothii, or Dicranum falcatum from D.
Starkii.
Is Bartramia falcata of " Hooker in Linn.
Trans, ix.
317," (referred 
to in the *Muscologia Britannica') the same as this ?
I have not the 
work at hand to refer to, but if it be the same, I suppose the name 
will have to be changed.
Polytrichum juniperinum .
I am induced to send you the accompanying sketch {fig./, p.
1033) 
of a specimen of Polytrichum juniperinum, which I found a few days 
ago.
It presents the curious appearance of two calyptrae being joined 
together, so as to have the external appearance of one ; inter nail}/ how- 
ever, as is shown at </, the calyptra appears distinctly two-celled, each 
cell containing a theca ; so that there is not the least adhesion be- 
4s2 
1036 
tween either the setae, or the capsules inclosed in this double calyp- 
tva, and the appearance is evidently occasioned by the two calyptrse 
growing together at an early stage.
The capsules in this specimen 
were quite young.

â€” Sketch of a Botanical Ramble to Twll dii, June 
19, 1844.
By Joseph Sidebotham, Esq.
During a short stay at Beaumaris in June, I made an excursion 
among the Caernarvonshire mountains, taking the route through Ban- 
gor, along the Capel Curig road, through the Penryn slate- quarries to 
Twll du, thence crossing the mountains to Llanberis, and the follow- 
ing day making the ascent of Snowdon, returning by the lakes and 
through the Llanberis quarries.
Having been unsuccessful in one of the objects of my journey, viz., 
to procure Lloydia serotina, from its inaccessible situation, I deter- 
mined on a second excursion.
A friend from Bangor accompanied 
me.
We took a conveyance as far as the Penryn quan'ies, having 
previously agreed with one of the workmen to accompany us, and to 
bring a rope.
The morning was not one of the most promising for a 
botanical expedition, the mountains being completely hidden by a 
thick mist, while occasionally there fell a little rain.
Nothing parti- 
cular occurred during our walk along the road.
Allosorus crispus 
was very plentiful on the walls, and we saw plenty of Saxifraga stel- 
laris on the wet, rocks.
Twll du is situated to the right of the road, just at the commence- 
ment of Llyn Ogwen, a large lake which borders the pathway on the 
left hand.
Here commenced our ascent, which lay over fragments of 
rock and heathy ground, abounding in Lycopodium Selago and alpi- 
num.
In a short time we reached Llyn Idwel, a lake of considerable 
extent, the shore of which was lined with fragments of Isoetes lacus- 
tris, and the bottom is in some parts covered with it, growing inter- 
mixed with Lobelia Dortmanna.
Subularia aquatica also grows here 
in plenty ; but we did not find any in flower, being a little too early 
in the season.
1037 
On the neighbouring rocks was abundance of Andraja Rothii, in 
fruit, with A.
alpina in smaller quantity; also Grimmia ovata, Anic- 
tangium ciliatum, and several species of Trichostomuin : scattered 
here and there were Carex dioica and Splachnum sphsericum.
We 
did not stay long in this place, as the rain began to descend rather 
heavily, but made the best of our way along the shore of the lake, and 
up the rugged side of the mountain to Twll du.
On the occasion of my previous visit, I ascended the course of a 
mountain stream, and gathered the following mosses upon the rocks 
which bordered it.
Gymnostomum fasciculare, Weissia acuta, Gly- 
phomitron Daviesii, Bryum crudura, B.
julaceum, B.
ventricosum and 
B. Zierii, with many others of less note.
The rocks on our way up 
the mountain side were covered with the beautiful Silene acaulis, 
Saxifraga hypnoides, stellaris and oppositifolia, in fruit, Oxyria reni- 
formis and Asplenium viride.
Twll du is an immense chasm or cleft 
in the mountain, the sides of which are perpendicular.
It appears to 
have been formed by the long-continued action of a stream, which 
runs from a small lake above, called Llyn y cwn.
At my first visit, I 
penetrated this cleft till 1 reached an immense block of stone, which 
completely chokes the passage, rendering further progress next to 
impossible.
As our present object was to gain the top as soon as pos- 
sible, we turned to the left on reaching the chasm, and so ascended, 
keeping close to the wall of rocks.
On these rocks we gathered Trollius europseus, Thalictrum alpi- 
num, Rhodiola rosea, Arenaria verna, Gnaphalium dioicum, and a 
Saxifrage which I suppose to be S.
caespitosa ; Hypnum Crista-cas- 
tensis and Neckera crispa grew at the base, but we found no fruit.
On reaching the summit, our friend the quarryman took off his load 
of rope, to reconnoitre the place.
I had to act as guide, being the 
only one of the party who had visited the place before.
We first went 
to the channel where the little stream leaps over the rocks into the 
profound abyss.
From this place we could see plenty of the Lloydia 
serotina growing on the face of the precipice, above the large block of 
stone.
There was one specimen bearing two flowers, a yard or two 
from the waterfall, ahnost within reach.
I had seen the same speci- 
men before, and wished much to gather it, but the attempt would have 
been very dangerous, from the friable nature of the rock.
Fortunately 
I saw another, vt'hich, after a little climbing, I managed to obtain.
We then returned to the rocks immediately above the precipice, where 
the quarryman fastened the rope round his body, and began the de- 
scent, having first given us strict injunctions not to let go our hold.
1038 
He returned however almost immediately, with the unwelcome news 
that the rope only reached a few feet over the brink of the precipice ; 
it should have been at least ten yards longer.
This was mortifying : 
but ne cede malls, thought I ; so after a short consultation, we agreed 
to attempt a footing lower and nearer the precipice, and presently fix- 
ed on a small ledge of rock at the brink, where it was possible, by a 
little clearing from debris to place our feet.
From this point we low- 
ered our friend John, who soon reappeared with some specimens of 
of the precious plant in his mouth, and a few others in his hat.
The mist had now cleared away from the mountains, and we went 
to Glyder Vawr to search for Woodsia Ilvensis ; in this we were un- 
successful, although possessing plans of the district, with which my 
friend Mr. Roberts of Bangor had favoured me, embracing even the 
actual rock upon which he and Mr. Borrer had gathered it in plenty.
Nothing else occurred particularly worthy of note, but I may observe 
that there was plenty of Juniperus nanus coming into flower, and a lit- 
tle Splachnum mnioides about Llyn y cwn.

â€” Further Remarks on Carices.
By S.
Gibson, Esq.
The object of this note is to prove that my Carex pseudo-paradoxa 
does not really belong to C.
teretiuscula, as has been advocated by 
Dr. Wood and other botanists.
Controversy is of great value in Botany as well as in the other sci- 
ences, as it has always a tendency to lead to further researches, and 
the facts which result from them often tend to the development of 
truth.
Had my former remarks upon these plants been generally ad- 
mitted, I should probably have remained satisfied; but the objections 
and doubts that have been raised against it, have led me to a very de- 
tailed investigation of the plants in question ; and the result is that 
my former opinion on the subject is still unshaken.
But here I may observe in regard to the term, that it is a matter of 
no moment with me whether they be called species or varieties, since 
I know that it is not in the power of man to tell what a species is.
All that I shall here attempt to prove is that such characters as I 
have pointed out do really exist in the plants.
And before I make any attempt to do this, I will just say that my 
remarks will (unless otherwise expressed) be limited to those speci- 
1039 
mens which were sent to Mr. Babington* by Dr. Wood, marked 
" Seaman's Moss-pits, Cheshire,"t and those referred to by our editor 
(Phytol.
811), as he tells us he received them from the Dr. I confine 
myself to these specimens, because Mr. Luxford's history of the plants 
in question is a very unsatisfactory one, inasmuch as it alludes to his 
having received the plants from persons who have not been very par- 
ticular in sending the disputed plant when they have been asked for it.
Mr. King, of Lane-house, near Halifax, asked Mr. Sidebotham (one 
of the parties referred to) for my C.
pseudo-paradoxa, and he sent him 
specimens under that name.
Mr. King, on receiving them, finding 
them not to agree with the description I had given of it (Phytol.
778), 
came and desired me to show him my specimens ; this 1 did with 
pleasure, and he, the moment I opened the paper, pronounced them 
very different from those he had received from Mr. Sidebotham.
Ano- 
ther instance of this gentleman's negligence will be exemplified by 
the following quotation, which is from one of his letters to me, dated 
January 11, 1844 : â€” " Mr. Babington wrote to me for ripe fruit of the 
Carex, and I sent him some of the teretiuscula by mistake." 
I will now turn to our editor's note, (Phytol.
811); and the first 
thing I shall notice is the following passage.
" We have now before 
us under the microscope, the fruit of the disputed plant, of C.
tereti- 
uscula, and of C.
paniculata, all in a mature state." By this and what 
follows, I understand the reference to be to the perigynium only.
Al- 
lowing then that there is a striking difference in the fruit (perigynium) 
of these two plants, I hope that I shall not be thought presumptuous 
if I just see how these differences have been pointed out by persons 
who have written on the subject, and attempted to describe them.
Sir 
W. J.
Hooker (British Flora, ed.
5), speaks of the fruit of these two 
plants as having their beaks bidentate, he says nothing of the one be- 
ing more so than the other.
He also says, on the authority of Dr.
Boott, that the winged margins of the fruit of the teretiuscula are ser- 
rulate, and that those of the paniculata are serrated; and he speaks 
of them hotli as having a central, and sometimes winged line along 
their beaks, on the convex side of the perigynia.
Our editor tells us 
(Phytol.
812) that the paniculata has a fringed membrane upon the 
* At my request, that gentleman favoured me with the specimens now alluded to ; 
and I now lake this opportunity of thanking him for the kindness.
f If there he " no such thing as secresy " in the case, I now say with candour, that 
I should take it as one of the greatest of favours if some of the parties who are acquaint- 
ed with the locality, would give in 'The Phytologist' such a direction as would enable 
a stranger in that neighbourhood to find the above mentioned place.
1040 
beak of its fruit, and on the other hand, that the teretiuscula has a 
SERRATED membrane.
Mr. Luxford says (Phytol.
922), when speak- 
ing of the teretiuscula, that it has a serrulate wing.
Smith describes 
them both as having serrated beaks.
These two plants are spoken 
of indiscriminately as having their fruit hi/id or notched at the beak.
The two are also spoken of as having a dorsal wing upon the convex 
side of their perigynia.
By 'this it will appear that the difference of 
the fruit of these plants is either very inconsiderable, or that the par- 
ties who have attempted to describe them have never examined them.
I have now given the ideas of some of our most eminent writers up- 
on these plants, in nearly their own words, lest it should be said that 
I have misapplied their meaning.
I shall now impartially give the 
results of my own observations on this subject; and by an exact exa- 
mination of the plants themselves, will endeavour to find out which of 
the above accounts, so diametrically opposed to each other, are the 
most consonant to matter of fact.
But before I commence I must lay down this general principle, 
which I hope will not be denied, namely, that Nature is uniform in 
all her operations, and does not recede from the rule laid down by the 
Wise Disposer of all things, by making the same thing often two dif- 
ferent methods.
Therefore, if I were to find a central or winged line 
on the convex side of the fruit of these plants, or find them with ser- 
rated, CILIATED, or SERRULATED lateral margins in one instance, I 
should expect to find them so in all.
And now -I must say that if any 
person will take the trouble of examining the perigyniums of these 
plants, he will find there is neither a central wing nor central line on 
their convex side ; but there is an opening on that side which extends 
downwards to the very bottom of the beak, and in some instances to 
the base of the perigynium itself.
The curious nature of this opening 
may perhaps have given rise to the various opinions as to its having a 
wing or winged line.
This opening may be seen by passing a knife 
in a longitudinal direction along the outer or convex side of the beak, 
which will be found to consist of two thin membranes, which overlap 
each other, and thus form what a mechanic would call a spliced joint.
This is a description of a perigynium in its ordinary form ; but in some 
we find one or both of these membranes that is not laid close down, 
and thus may have given rise to the supposed central wing; in others 
we find these membranes turned inwards, and in that state may have 
o-iven rise to the supposed central line.
When the beak is opened 
out and laid flat, it will be found that what was the inner or concave 
side is very thin in the middle, particularly so towards the point, and 
1041 
this part being split by the least accident, causes it to be more or less 
notched or bifid.
This character is common to C.
teretinscula, pani- 
culata, paradoxa, and to my pseudo-paradoxa, but on examination it 
will be the least distinct in paradoxa and most distinct in my pseu- 
do-paradoxa.
Carex paniculata is spoken of as having the beak of 
its perigynium more deeply bifid ; with a broader and deeper fringed 
margin.
In this I find no difference between paniculata and its allies, 
as they are all equally variable in this respect.
I have the perigyni- 
uras of paniculata with their margins as narrow and as indistinctly 
fringed as any I ever saw in teretinscula; and I have often met with 
paniculata with the beaks of its perigyniums quite entire, that is to 
say, neither bifid nor notched.
To speak of the beaks or lateral mar- 
gins of these perigyniums being more or less white or green, would 
only be losing time, as any person who has paid the least attention to 
the subject will know how far we can depend on such a character, as 
all of them will (T think) be found green when in a young state, and 
more or less white with age.
Having now .spoken at some length on the beaks of the perigyniums 
of these plants, I now come to notice their lower parts : and on exa- 
mination I find these parts (in all the four forms) to be equally varia- 
ble, that is, in being convex on one side, and flat or concave on the 
other, or in being more or less convex on both sides.
I have seen C.
paniculata with its perigyniums even concave on both sides ; and at 
other times I have met with it ha^dng its perigyniums as much inflat- 
ed and quite as gibbous on their inner faces as ever I saw those parts 
in C.
paradoxa; and on the other hand, I have seen paradoxa with 
the inner faces of its perigyniums flat, and in some instances concave 
on that side.
In short, I always consider the perigynium as the most 
variable part in all Carices, the shape depending much on their being 
more or less densely placed on the rachis.
Thus, a spike or spikelet 
(of the same species) having four, six or eight rows, would have them 
of various shapes, and when placed very close one above the other, so 
as to press the beaks outwards, they will be found more convex upon 
their inner faces than when they are more distantly placed.
My reasons for not considering the perigynium of Carices as being 
part of their fruit, are as follows.
First; because I often find them 
with pistils which remain abortive : secondly, with stamens only: third- 
ly, with both stamens and pistils : fourthly, proliferous, that is, with 
the peduncle of one perigynium passing through the beak of the next 
below, and thus rising one above the other for four or five heights ; in 
this state they are sometimes abortive, and at other times produce per- 
1042 
feet nuts : and, fifthly, I find them with the peduncle of a fertile spike 
jDassing through the beak of one or more of their perigyniums ; this 
character is common in the different forms of what is called C.
Good- 
enovii.
When in this state I find the perigyniums insensibly passing 
into what are called scales or glumes ; and on the other hand, I find 
the glumes insensibly passing into what are called the bracteas ; and 
again, I find these bracteas in the same insensible manner passing in- 
to what are called the leaves.
Thus we have perigyniums, glumes, 
bracteas and leaves, so closely connected that it is impossible to tell 
where to strike the line of distinction.
I now turn to Mr. Luxford's note (Phytol.
918), and as I only study 
plants &c.
in their natural habits, I do not know what Mr. L.
means 
us to understand by his reference " to our domesticated animals and 
our cultivated plants and fruits." But I must say that I am somewhat 
surprised at Mr. Luxford's notion of a natural group of Carices, when 
I find that he has put Carex vulpina alongside of C.
paniculata &c.
: 
and I am also surprised to find him saying that " the inflorescence of 
Carex vulpina is tolerably constant," as I do not know of any Carex 
that is more inconstant in its mode of inflorescence.
And so far as 
its natural affinities are concerned, I think that it would have been 
better placed with such species as muricata, divulsa, &c.
And as / do not study figures, I will pass over those of Mr. Wilson 
and the others which have been " copied from Leighton's ' Flora of 
Shropshire,' " by just saying that I have never seen the mature nut of 
a Carex that has any resemblance to Mr. Wilson's fig.
d ; but on the 
contrary, I say that no figure could be made more correctly to repre- 
sent the MATURE nut of C.
teretiuscula than that of Mr. Leighton.
As one who studies plants, I would advise such persons as are in 
the habit of making figures that should represent such characters as 
the swollen base of the style of a Carex, while standing on the nut, 
just to make some mark whereby we may distinguish the style from 
the nut itself; or perhaps we might mistake the whole of the nut for 
part of the style.
For an account of the discovery of Carex paradoxa in Yorkshire, 
Mr. Luxford refers us to a note by Mr. Spruce, (Phytol.
842).
So far 
as regards the discovery of this plant, it is a matter of little or no im- 
portance, but what has been said on the subject would, I think, have 
been much better, if it had been correct.
Mr. Spruce says, " it was 
first found by myself in Heslington fields, in April, 1841, and a few 
weeks after in Ascham bogs." Here I could inform Mr. Spruce when 
and by whom this plant had been found in Yorkshire long before the 
1043 
time that he has mentioned ; but for the correctness of his statement, 
I will only refer the reader to Baines's ' Flora of Yorkshire,' for there 
he will find Ascham-bogs given as a station for the plant in question; 
and as this book was published in the year 1840, it will serve to show 
that this plant must have been discovered previous to 1841.
Mr. Luxford tells us that the stem of C.
paniculata has three acute 
angles, with the interstices flat ; while the angles of teretiuscula are 
obtuse, with projecting lines on the sides.
He also tells us that the 
stems of the paradoxa resemble the latter.
In this Mr. L.
agrees with 
most of our writers on the British Carices; and indeed we are told in 
'English Botany,' that C.
teretiuscula takes its name from the circum- 
stance of its having a stem of a peculiar form.
I shall not say here 
how far the form of the stems of Carices may be taken into account 
as characters whereby to distinguish them as species ; neither shall I 
say how far these forms are constant.
But this I will say, that my 
Carex pseudo-paradoxa {those specimens that were sent by Dr. Wood 
to Mr. Bahington) has a stem that has three acute angles, with the 
interstices Jiat, or, if I were to speak with exactness, I might say the 
interstices are concave.
Mr. L.
tells us that these characters indicate 
specific identity.
As regards the perigyuia and nuts of the Carices in question, I 
might say, taking the rule and leaving out the exceptions, that the pe- 
rigynia of C.
paniculata and paradoxa are nearly the same, so far as 
the ribs are concerned, and their greater or less proportion of convex- 
ity is variable in both ; in my pseudo-paradoxa and the teretiuscula 
the ribs are the same, but the former has a perigynium that is much 
broader at the base.
If we take a series of the nuts (that is to say what belongs to one 
specimen) of C.
paniculata, paradoxa and my pseudo-paradoxa, it will 
be found that their resemblance is so close that it is not possible to 
distinguish them with certainty ; and if, on the contrary, we take a se- 
ries of the nuts of C.
teretiuscula, we shall find their outline to be very 
different from the other three, the prevailing number will be found to 
resemble Mr. Leighton's figure of the nut of that species.
It must be understood that I here speak of the fruit of these Carices 
in a state of maturity : this I say with so much certainty, that I shall 
not have to retract the words by saying that "I am inclined to think" 
otherwise, as nothing is more easy than to know when the fruit of a 
Carex is mature.
As Mr. Luxford takes the ' London Catalogue of British Plants ' as 
some authority in this disputed point, I hope that he will allow me to 
1044 
say, that the plant which I have called Carex pseudo-paradoxa is nei- 
ther more nor less a species for being placed under C.
teretiuscula as 
var.
b. of that plant.
I wonder that the compilers of that Catalogue 
did not do by these four Carices as they have done by some of our 
Saiices, that is, to make a, b, c and d of them, and then tell us that 
their " proper typical form " is to be found in some foreign land !!
I am truly sorry to say that Mr, Luxford's note is of no value in set- 
tling the disputed point, since he tells us that he does not know whe- 
ther the differences he has taken so much pains in pointing out, may 
not be attributed to the plants being examined in different states of 
maturity.
My Carex pseudo-paradoxa, differs from C.
teretiuscula (when ma- 
ture) in its nut being narrowed from below the middle, and in the 
perigynium being broader and truncate at the base ; it also differs 
from that plant in its stem having three acute angles, with their inter- 
stices^a^.
From C.
paniculata it differs in its perigynium being dif- 
ferently ribbed and less distinctly bifid at the point, and in having 
narrower leaves.
From C.
paradoxa it will be found to differ in its 
perigynium being less distinctly ribbed on its inner side, and also in 
the form of its stem.
And from all the other three it differs in its mode 
of inflorescence.* Saml.

â€” Notice of PresVs ' Hymenophyllace(R?-\ 
In all and everything relating to ferns, the name of Presl is a gua- 
rantee for excellence.
In saying this, we by no means assert that he 
is infallible : we could with little trouble lay our finger on several im- 
portant errors into which he has fallen ; one of the most inexcusable 
of these is his version of the venation of Ceterach : but we do assert 
that there is throughout his works a constant exhibition of the most 
comprehensive knowledge, of the most admirable power of seizing- 
characters, of the most acute judgment and capability of generaliz- 
ing, and of the most perfect fairness in citing all the authorities with 
which he is acquainted.
* Thus far we liave given Mr. Gibson's letter entire, but we Lope to be excused for 
omitting his concluding paragraph, as not bearing on the subject in dispute.
â€” Ed.
\ Hymenophyllaceas.
Eine Botanische Abhandlung, von Puof.
Dr. Karl B.
Presi,.
Prag.
[Pamplin, Frith Street, London].
1015 
The work by which Presl first attained his reputation was published 
at Prague in 1836, under the well known title of ' Tentamen Pterido- 
graphiae.' He there divides the ferns into five orders : â€” Filicacea?, 
Hymenophyllacese, Marattiaceae, Osmundaceae and OphioglossaccEe ; 
of these the FilicaceaB alone are analyzed, the Hymenophyllacege be- 
ing announced as the subjects of a future memoir, while the remaining 
orders are left for other botanists to elaborate.
" Should it please Al- 
mighty God the Hymenophyllaceae shall be discussed in a separate 
memoir: but 1 purpose leaving the remaining orders to the skilful 
hands of other historians." The memoir thus promised in 1836, was 
completed in 1842 ; and we consider it so excellent, that we trust no 
apology is necessary for giving verhatim a large portion of its contents.
Comparing this treatise with that upon the Filicaceae, it is deci- 
dedly superior.
In the earlier work there are combinations, both as 
sections, genera and subgenera, which will not bear the test of critical 
examination : but in the present work the groups are described with 
the utmost care, and perhaps are indebted for some portion of their 
greater value to the fact that they depend almost solely on the fructi- 
fication.
Presl was the first to systematize the venation of ferns, and 
carried away by the beauty, the novelty, and indeed by the intrinsic 
utility of this guide, he perhaps, in some instances, gave it too great 
an importance, and allowed it to take precedence of the characters of 
fructification.
In the Hymenophyllaceae he finds the venation more 
uniform, and is therefore driven back on the fructification; and the 
result of the application of his great analytical powers to so safe and 
certain a guide, is the institution of genera more definite and tangible 
than any previously promulged in any section of the filicoid plants.
We have already seen that the author considers the Hymenophyl- 
laceae a group as distinct from the other annulate ferns as are the 
Osmundaceae.
To this opinion we are scarcely prepared to subscribe.
The capsule in these plants possesses a most distinct articulated ring, 
as in the true Polypodies : yet generally differs in being attached to 
the receptacle by a portion of its diameter, the ring not unfrequently 
passing transversely round the capsule, like a belt ; whereas, in the 
Filicaceae of Presl, it is almost invariably stipitate, its stipes generally 
appearing continuous with the ring.
The receptacle in the Hymeno- 
phyllaceae is free ; while in the Filicaceae it is almost invariably im- 
bedded.
And here it may be as well to observe, that every part of 
the vein in ferns seems liable to become a receptacle by the presence 
of capsules.
In the Fihcaceae we find a distinct and apparently in- 
dependent involucre ; it does not appear to us to be the cuticle of the 
1046 
frond separated from the parenchyma by the pressure of the growing 
capsules, although the great similarity of its structure to that of the 
epidermis has been so often pointed out; but rather a separate and 
distinct part, as much so as the veins, the capsules or the scales : in 
the Hymenophyllacege the bivalved involucre is quite another affair ; 
it is perfectly continuous with the edge of the frond, and is very evi- 
dently formed of its tvro cuticles.
The office of the involucre in the 
Polypodies has not, we believe, been demonstrated with precision, 
and it is quite possible that the involucre in the Hymen ophyllacese 
may perform exactly similar functions ; but the parts are not identical, 
and the involucre of Hymenophyllum appears to us rather the ana- 
logue of the inflected margins of an Adiantum, or an Allosorus, than 
of the peltate involucre of a Polystichum.
The texture of the frond 
in the Filicacese is generally somewhat coriaceous or slightly fleshy, 
and the transparent veins, when viewed from above, appear to be sunk 
in its substance : in the Hymenophyllacese the reverse is the case, the 
frond being very thin and membranous, and the veins stout, winged, 
prominent and opaque.
Thus the structure of these interesting plants 
seems to lead us to the conclusion that they form a part of the Filica- 
ceee or true ferns, while the points in which they difi"er from the rest 
are so numerous, that we are compelled to consider them the most 
distinct and detached division of that extensive and diversified order.
We are fully aware that exceptions occur to all these characters : 
for instance, Robert Brown's Loxsoma seems to have something of a 
fleshy or leathery frond, with free, setiforra involucres and stipitate 
capsules; and other instances of departure from typical character 
might without difficulty be pointed out.
The Hymenophyllacese are divided by Presl into nineteen genera, 
composing two tribes, Trichomanoideae and Hymenophylloideae ; the 
first of these is again divided into two sections, Trichomanese and 
Didymoglosseae.
The genera of Trichomanese are these : Feea and 
Hymenostachys of Bory, Didymoglossum of Desvaux, and Lecanium, 
Cardiomanes, Trichomanes (restricted), Ragatelus, Cephalomanes, 
Neurophyllum, Microgonium, Abrodictyum, Meringium and Hemi- 
phlebium of Presl.
The genera of Hymenophylloideae are Leptocio- 
nium, Myrmecostylum, Ptycophyllum, Hymenophyllum (restricted), 
Sphserocionium and Hymenoglossum of Presl.
The characters given to the Trichomanoideae are these.* 
* We prefer giving the quotations untranslated, believing that all botanists who 
may honour us with a perusal of these pages, will prefer the original to any version 
which it is in our power to make.

It will be observed that the main distinction between the two tribes 
is found in the tubular involucre of the Trichomanoideae, the tube be- 
ing invariably entire, and its limb either entire or bipartite, the former 
character distinguishing the Trichomanese, the latter the Didymoglos- 
seae.
In this definition we feel scarcely inclined fully to concur, since 
in the first group we almost invariably find the limb of the involucre 
bipartite, or at least emarginate on each side, at its junction with the 
wing or margo.

The author then recapitulates the characters of the genus Tricho- 
manes, as they are given by Linneus, Swartz, Bernhardi, Willde- 
now, Robert Brown, Kaulfuss, Sprengel and Endlicher, showing how 
completely they contradict each other, and how inadequate they are 
to the correct definition of a genus.
He divides the restricted genus 
Trichomanes into three named sections, as under.

For this beautiful and remarkable fern we are indebted to Mr.
Cuming.
It was distributed under the numbers 208 and 358.
The 
description of the genus includes that of the species.
Genus, Didymoglossum, Desvaux.
This very distinct and beautiful genus was established seventeen 
years ago by Desvaux, and strange to say, has been neglected by all 
subsequent filicologists with whose works we are acquainted.
It ex- 
hibits in an eminent degree the full development of the bifid structure 
of the limb of the involucre, a character which we believe common to 
the whole of the Hymenophyllaceae.
We find no trace of this struc- 
ture in Presl's figure of Cephalomanes (the plant itself we have not 
1057 
examined), but we see no reason for supposing it a departure from a 
rule that seems little subject to exception.

Note on CEnanthe pimpinelloides.
Allow me to make a few 
observations upon the notice of this plant (Phytol.
1020 and 1031), in 
which mj name is brought prominently forward ; and first, to state 
that Mr. Ball's paper, which is there referred to, is contained in the 
last number of the ' Annals of Natural History,' and that a paper of 
mine, upon the same subject, is already printed off for the next num- 
ber of that journal.
To these I must refer Mr. Lees for the detailed 
reasons which have led Mr. Ball and myself now to consider that we 
possess three CEnanthes in this country, to which the names of CE.
pimpinelloides, CE.
Lachenalii, and possibly QE.
peucedanifolia, may 
be applied.
In common with Mr. Ball, 1 consider the first to be "very 
rare," since we only know of its existence in Gloucestershire and Wor- 
cestershire, from Mr. Lees' observations, and near Weymouth, from 
specimens gathered by Mr. Garnons.
A " very rare " plant is often 
abundant in a few places.
The observation that this species inhabits 
dry places is highly interesting, and I believe new, as in all the books 
to which I have, at this time, the opportunity of turning, the true CE.
pimpinelloides (not that of Smith) is stated to inhabit damp places.
CE.
pimpinelloides {Linn.) was quite unknown to me as a British na- 
tive, until I received information concerning it from my friend Ball, 
and specimens from Mr. Garnons ; and as I had indisputable proof 
that the plant so called by Smith, is the CE.
Lachenalii, I had no other 
course to pursue in the Manual, than that of omitting the former and 
introducing the latter name.
CE.
Lachenalii always, as I believe, in- 
habits salt marshes, or at least, marshes near the sea, a situation in 
which the plant called CE.
peucedanifolia by English botanists has 
not, to my knowledge, ever been found.
I have so often seen (E.
La- 
chenalii misnamed as CE.
peucedanifolia, that I am led to suspect 
that even Mr. Lees may have fallen into this error, especially as he 
speaks of the "elliptical sessile knobs" of CE.
peucedanifolia, in which 
the knobs are really of an oblong-clavate form, whilst in CE.
Lache- 
nalii, they scarcely deserve the name of knobs, but are rather to be 
described as long, fleshy, knotted fibres.
On this subject however I 
must refer to the papers already mentioned.
It is not necessary to 
occupy space here with an attempt to determine the plant to which 
the name of CE.
peucedanifolia really belongs, as I have entered fully 
into the discussion of that very difiicult question in the same paper.
From the above it will be seen that I venture to differ from one of the 
conclusions arrived at by Mr. Lees, and put into the form of an ab- 
stract by the reporter of the London Botanical Society's meeting, viz., 
1061 
doubting if the CE.
peucedanifolia of British authors is found in salt 
marshes, and believing that it is QL.
Lacheualii that inhabits them.
It is also not a little singular that so acute an observer and excellent 
a botanist as the compiler of the London Catalogue, having, as we 
now learn, specimens of both GE.
pimpinelloides and CE.
Lachenalii 
before him, should have excluded from his list that which he will pro- 
bably now allow to be the more common plant, and inserted one which 
is very local in its distribution.

Professor Graham, President, in the chair.
After a delightful walk through the garden and plant houses, ac- 
companied by the learned President, who pointed out many of the 
beautiful specimens which they contain, the meeting re-assembled in 
the class-room, when the following papers were read.
I. On four genera of Desmidieae ; by Mr. John Ralfs, Penzance.
The genera are Cosmarium, Pediastrum, Xanthidium and Scenedes- 
mus, and the descriptions of them, which were accompanied by illus- 
trative drawings, will shortly appear in the ' Annals and Magazine of 
Natural History.' 
II.
Continuation of Mr. James M'Nab's Journal of a Tour through 
part of the United States and the Canadas.
In the previous part of 
this journal, Mr. M'Nab gave a brief outline of the principal botanical 
and horticultural features observed in the neighbourhood of New York.
The part now read, embraced chiefly the appearance of the country 
around Albany, with an account of the most interesting plants seen 
during the journey thither.
Among these the most remarkable were 
several species of Lycopodium, with which the peaty soils on the road 
sides around Albany were covered, consisting of L.
complanatum, 
clavatum and dendroides, the latter resembling at a distance young 
spruce fir-trees â€” being similarly shaped and of a lively green colour.
In damp situations in the close forests, Adiantum pedatum and other 
ferns covered large tracts, while Pyrola elliptica and rotundifolia, with 
Chemophylla raaculata and umbellata were in full flower along the 
drier parts.
Satyrium herbiola and Neottia tortilis were also observ- 
ed â€” the latter growing chiefly in pairs.
The principal plants noticed 
in the meadows or open grounds were Lilium Philadelphicum and 
Canadense, Mimulus ringens, Verbena hastata and Urticae folia, and 
1062 
Asclepias obtiisifolia and variegata.
Proceeding towards Troy, on 
.the banks of the Hudson, great quantities of Kalmia angustifolia, Cor- 
nus florida, Lupinus perennis, Andromedas, Vacciniums &c., occur- 
red.
In an extensive forest, chiefly composed of small trees, and 
much entangled with Smilax, or green brier, through which the party 
proceeded with great difficulty, Cypripedium spectabile covered large 
patches, with Arum triphyllum, the latter in full flower.
Mr. M'Nab 
concluded the present part of his journal with an account of some 
large trees of the hemlock spruce, Abies canadensis, being the first of 
this tree which the party had observed in natural situations : â€” the 
largest specimens were about 10 feet in circumference, and 80 feet in 
height.
The Honorable G.
C. Cunningham, Mauritius, and F.
S. Cordier, 
M.D., Paris, were elected foreign members ; and Alfred Greenwood, 
Esq., Chelmsford, Essex, a non-resident Fellow of the Society.
BOTANICAL SOCIETY OF LONDON.
July 5, 1844.
â€” Dr. Francis Bossy in the chair.
Specimens of the following plants were exhibited, sent to the Soci- 
ety by Mr. Hewett Watson.
Carex elongata {Liuii.), found abundantly in Weybridge marshes.
This locality is interesting to the metropolitan botanist ; the nearest 
habitat previously on record being in the county of Salop.
A pubescent-flowered vaiiety of Bromus commutatus {Schrad.), 
found plentifully, along with the more abundant glabrous form, in a 
meadow by the river Mole, between Esher and West Moulsey, Surrey.
This variety affords another instance to prove the little importance 
which can be given to the character of smooth or downy flowers, as a 
specific distinction in this genus.
It will form an addition to the 
' London Catalogue of British Plants ' (b.
iJuhens), to be entered un- 
der " Bromus (1355) commutatus." 
A specimen of Lolium multiflorum, the root of which was dug up, 
when in flower, in a sown field last year, and the plant is now copi- 
ously flowering in Mr. Watson's garden ; thus proving its perennial 
existence, although the alleged annual root of L.
multiflorum has been 
considered the best distinction between this supposed species and L.
perenne.
The other alleged differences are equally invalid.
Garden specimens of Festuca pratensis {Huds.) and F.
arundina- 
cea {Schreb.), to show the strongly marked differences between them ; 
the latter being three times the size, extremely harsh to the touch, and 
very dissimilar in its flowers and mode of inflorescence.
In F.
pra- 
1063 
lensis the branches of the panicle are erect after flowering, the paleae 
or glumes obtuse and awnless, and the sheaths of the leaves nearly 
smooth : in F.
arundinacea, the branches of the panicle are horizon- 
tal or reflexed, the glumes acute and awned, and the sheaths and 
leaves very rough.
Mr. W.
admitted Festuca loliacea and pratensis to be forms of one 
species ; indeed he had shown this to the Edinburgh botanists, just 
after they had printed their Catalogue, in which F.
loliacea is kept as 
a distinct species, while F.
pratensis is united with F.
elatior {Linn.) 
But he was not yet prepared to combine all three, and F.
arundinacea 
likewise, under the one name of F.
elatior, as is done by Mr. Babing- 
ton.
Mr. W.'s plant of F.
arundinacea was originally brought to his 
garden from the Isle of Wight, and is now a large sheaf, with hun- 
dreds of flowering stems, five to seven feet high, and the root-leaves 
half a yard long.
A specimen of CEnanthe pirapinelloides {Linn.), to show the cylin- 
drical form of the fruit, which exactly corresponds with that of the 
Sardinian plant (admitted to be the true species), except in having 
two callosities at the base.
This was taken from a plant in Mr. W.'s 
garden, the parent of which had been brought thither from a hedge- 
bank in the Isle of Wight.
Mr. W.
recognized a second species in 
Britain, often sent to him under the name of CE.
peucedanifolia, and 
readily distinguished by its turbinate or elli^jtic fruit, upon extremely 
short pedicels, and more resembling Q^.
globulosa than QC.
pimpinel- 
loides.
The peculiar form of the root to some other specimens, re- 
sembling that of a Dahlia in miniature, induces a supposition that 
there may be a third species, although Mr. Watson has satisfied him- 
self that the roots vary greatly with age and situation, and do not af- 
ford such certain characters for distinction as may be found in the 
fruit.
The (^.
Lachenalii (of Babington's Manual) is apparently the 
species frequently sent under the name of QE.
peucedanifolia, though 
occasionally named QE.
pimpinelloides by English botanists.
Mr, 
W. would illustrate this subject more fully on another occasion.
Specimens of the garden fennel, to show the little importance to be 
attached to the difference of the stems being fistulose or filled with 
pith.
These specimens were sections of stems arising from a single 
root, of different dimensions, but of nearly equal age and stage of de- 
velopment.
Some of them (the thicker) were hollow, others filled with 
pith.
A question respecting a distinction of species, between the wild 
and garden fennels, has been raised in consequence of one author de- 
scribing the stems as fistulose, while another finds them solid ; but 
1064 
since both conditions can exist on one root, at the same time, such a 
distinction would be quite inadmissible for a specific character.
A stem of Hieracium Lawsoni, which had borne twenty flowers in 
Mr. W.'s garden, this spring ; and others had flowered more numer- 
ously than this one.
In the wild state, on the Grampians (the locality 
from which the plants were brought three years ago), this species has 
usually two, three, or four flowers only.
He had seen a wild Irish 
specimen with six or eight flowers.
No care had been bestowed upon 
the plants in his garden, except occasional watering in dry weather, 
and removal of weeds from about them.
Mr. W.
sent the specimen 
merely as an example of the little dependence to be placed upon the 
number of flowers on the Hieracia; indeed among the Compositae ge- 
nerally.
A wild plant, growing free from the interference of other 
plants about it, might also increase its flowers five or ten fold, as prac- 
tical botanists must be well aware, from observation.

Dr. J.
S. Goodfellow in the chair.
A paper was read by Edwin J.
Quekett, Esq., On an apparently 
new form of vegetable discharged from the human stomach, belong- 
ing to the class Algae.
Mr. Quekett, after noticing numerous instan- 
ces where parasitical plants have been found on the exteiior of man, 
as well as of the lower animals, where they constitute diseases which 
often cause the death of the creature so aflected, proceeded to describe 
several instances where vegetation evidently existed in the interior of 
the body, and in the stomach especially.
In the case alluded to, con- 
tinued sickness prevailed in a constitution much debilitated by dis- 
ease of the liver, the matter ejected putting on the appearance of cof- 
fee-coloured flakes in a transparent gelatinous fluid.
On submitting 
the flakes to the microscope, they appeared to consist solely of vesi- 
cles of about the -j^Vo^ part of an inch in diameter, adhering to each 
other in a beaded manner, seldom however extending beyond three or 
four, or otherwise in a tetrahedral form.
The vesicles appear to con- 
tain granular matter, much resemblance existing between them and 
the yeast-plant, Torula Cerevisiae, but not identical with each other.
After some discussion as to the real nature of these bodies, the So- 
ciety adjourned until October next.

â€” Notes of a Botanical Ramble in Yorkshire, 8fc.
in the Summer of 1844.
Communicated by James Backhouse, 
JUN.
On the 28th of 6th Month (June), our party, consisting of John 
Tatham jun., of Settle, James Backhouse, James Backhouse jun., and 
Silvanus Thompson, of York, and G.
S. Gibson, of Saffron Walden, 
left York for Darlington ; and thence proceeded by way of Bishop 
Auckland, to Crook, where we left the railway, and took the road for 
Wolsiugham, distant about six miles, up the valley of the Wear.
On 
the wooded banks of the river we found Rosa villosa, Myrrhis odorata, 
Arenaria venia, Geranium sylvaticum, Salix nitens and Stellaria ne- 
morum.
These plants, with the exception of the two latter, were 
frequently met with in subsequent parts of our excursion ; and they 
may be considered common plants in this district.
We were struck 
with the large quantity of Myrrhis odorata ; and we found it so often 
in places remote from cultivation, that we could not doubt its being 
indigenous, though supposed by many botanists to be an introduced 
plant.
Leaving the main river, we turned up one of its southern branches, 
the Bollihope, in order to visit Bishopley Crags, a series of limestone 
cliffs between which the river forces its way.
Here we saw Hiera- 
cium murorum {Bahington), Crepis paludosa.
Campanula latifolia, 
Asplenium viride, Myosotis sylvatica, Festuca calamaria, &c.
; these 
also, with the exception of the last, are not uncommon plants in 
Teesdale.
On the moor above the Bollihope, we observed Festuca rubra, F.
oviua, y.
tenuifolia, Viola lutea var.
amoena, Empetrum nigrum, My- 
osotis repens &c.
; and on Middleton Fell, Saxifraga stellaris, Rubus 
Chamaemorus, Carex intermedia, Eriophorum vaginatum, &c.
By 
keeping too far to the south of the ridge separating Weai-dale from 
Teesdale, we had to ascend several steep hills covered with ling, and 
cross the intervening valleys, which, at the end of a long day's jour- 
ney, was very fatiguing.
After a walk of about twenty-seven miles, 
we arrived late in the evening at the High Force Inn. The country 
4u 
1066 
through which we passed, presented considerable diversity of wood 
and bleak trackless moors, the latter of which are generally unfavour- 
able for botanizing.
The next morning we set out for Widdy-bank Fell, Cauldron Snout 
and Falcon Glints ; which comprehend a district probably the richest 
in Teesdale for a botanist.
Passing along the Alston road for about 
two miles, we gathered Trollius europseus, Cnicus heterophyllus.
Polygonum viviparum and Primula farinosa, which we saw in most 
of the moist meadows.
Leaving the road, we crossed Langdon foot- 
bridge, and followed the course of a mountain stream, now much di- 
minished in consequence of the long drought.
Along its margin we 
found Sedum villosum, Tofieldia palustris, Saxifraga aizoides, Bartsia 
alpina, Kobresia caricina, Potamogeton plantagineus, Cochlearia 
groenlandica ?
Armeria marilima, ^.
alpina^ &c.
; and on the top of 
the Fell, Gentiana vema, Thalictrum alpinum, Lycopodium alpinum, 
Selago and selaginoides, Juncus triglumis, Carex capillaris, curta, 
dioica and ampullacea.
Rub us Chamgemorus, Arabis hirsuta, Gna- 
phalium dioicum, Plantago maritima, &c.
Here we found a small 
plant resembling a Spergula ; but being unable to identify it with any 
described British species, we transmitted a specimen to Sir W.
J. 
Hooker, and soon received from him the gratifying intelligence that 
it was Spergula stricta, a plant not previously found in the British 
islands.
It occurred very sparingly, and from its growing among 
Arenaria verna, which, when out of flower, bears considerable resem- 
blance to it, it was difficult to detect.
We saw no trace of it in any 
subsequent part of our excursion, although we searched carefully in 
many likely localities.
We next visited Cauldron Snout, a cataract of the Tees where the 
river is precipitated in a broken fall of about two hundred feet down 
a dark basaltic gorge.
In consequence of the small quantity of water, 
this, as well as most of the other falls, was less striking than usual ; 
from the foot-bridge across the fall, a fine view of it is obtained, and 
the beauty of the scene is increased by a range of lofty basaltic crags, 
called Falcon Glints, which commence here, and extend along the 
side of the river for about a mile and a half.
We scrambled over the 
debris at the foot of these crags, carefully examining the face of the 
scar for Woodsia ilvensis : we succeeded in finding three small plants 
of it, growing in the fissures of the basalt.
When first gathered by 
James Backhouse, twenty-three years ago, it was considerably more 
abundant and luxuriant than at present.
We noticed also upon the rocks and among the debris, many com- 
1067 
moner ferns, such as Allosorus* crispus, Asplenium viride, Poly- 
podium Phegopteris, P.
Dryopteris, &c.
At one place, where the 
limestone appears, we gathered Polystichum Lonchitis, more than 
fifteen inches in length, but in very small quantity.
We also saw 
Epilobium alsinifolium, Hieracium diaphanum and Lawsoni, Viola 
flavicomis, and a single plant of Saxifraga umbrosa, var.
crenata.
In a marshy spot near the junction of Maizebeck with the Tees, we 
gathered Saxifraga stellaris in great profusion, and remarkably large.
Returning by Whetstone Sill, we noticed Habenaria albida, Salix 
arenaria, Equisetum variegatum, Carex capillaris and Bartsia alpina, 
the two last nearly a foot in height.
We returned to the inn to tea, 
and afterwards went down to the High Force ; the rocks here are of 
basalt overlaying limestone, down which the river pours in an almost 
unbroken fall of sixty-nine feet in height, into a dark basin, and runs 
along a deep ravine among high perpendicular rocks.
Several rare plants are found here, among others, Hieracium rigi- 
dum and Lawsoni, Crepis succisgefolia, Sesleria caerulea, Poa Par- 
nellii, Melica nutans, Potentilla fruticosa, Solidago Virgaurea, &.
cambrica, Carex rigida ?
Geum rivale &c.
; and on the scars beyond, 
we gathered Arbutus Uva-ursi.
This has hitherto been considered 
the only locality for Poa Pamellii, which we found growing abun- 
dantly on the rocks, but scarcely come to perfection.
On the 1st of 7th Month we started early for High-cup Scar, tak- 
ing Falcon Glints on the road, the upper series of which we partially 
explored, but found little fresh.
On the way thither we gathered a 
few specimens of the rare Hieracium Lapeyrousii, and near Cauldron 
Snout discovered a fresh locality for Poa Parnellii.
Leaving Cauldron Snout to the right, we followed Maizebeck from 
its junction with the Tees ; along its banks we gathered Botrychium 
Lunaria, Myosotis repens, Saxifraga stellaris, &c.
Taking a branch 
of Maizebeck to the left, and following it almost to its source, we 
crossed over Scordale Head, and visited Gaskill tarn on its summit, 
a body of water of considerable extent, but affoiding no plants wor- 
thy of notice.
Hence we descended towards the head of High- cup 
Scar, an enormous opening \^ the mountains of about one thousand 
feet in depth, nearly surrounded by perpendicular basaltic crags, and 
resembling in shape the hull of a large vessel : the lower part is chiefly 
covered with debris interspersed with patches of short grass; it is up- 
* In this, and a few other instances, we have, with permission, altered the nomen- 
clature of the ferns.
â€” Ed.
1068 
wards of a mile and a half in length, and half a mile across in the 
widest part.
The great depth of the valley below, and the dark shade 
of the rocks, entirely destitute of trees, give the whole a very striking 
aspect.
The view of it from the upper extremity, with the fertile vale 
of the Eden in the distance, bounded by Helvellyn and many of the 
Cumberland mountains, is very grand and imposing.
There are several gorges in the sides of the Scar, formed by the de- 
scent of mountain streams ; and in two of these Saxifraga nivalis is 
found in tolerable abundance (Phytol.
894).
We obtained several spe- 
cimens, though it flowered but sparingly, probably on account of the 
dryness of the season.
Much of it grows in inaccessible places, con- 
sequently there is little danger of its being exterminated, although it 
appears to be confined to a small locality.
In these gorges we also 
noticed a peculiar variety of Chaerophyllum sylvestre, with deeply in- 
cised, shining, dark leaves, and a nearly smooth stem, which we were 
at first inclined to think a new species, but not being able to discover 
sufficiently distinctive characters, we were compelled to consider it 
merely a mountain variety.
We also found a third locality for Poa 
Parnellii, which appears to be generally confined to basaltic rocks.
Rhodiola rosea grows in this Scar in great profusion ; Saxifraga hyp- 
noides and platypetala, Draba incana and Thlaspi alpestre occur 
more sparingly.
After a difficult descent to the bottom, we ascended the opposite 
side, and found Epilobium alsinifolium near the source of a small 
stream.
We then followed a track which led to Dufton, a small min- 
ing village, where there are two small inns, to one of which we bent 
our steps.
The next day we explored some other portions of High-cup Scar, 
but without any great success ; we noticed however Polypodium cal- 
careum, Hieracium Lawsoni and murorum, Melampyrum pratense, /3.
inontanum &c.
Returning along Maizebeck we gathered one or two 
specimens of Potentilla alpestris upon the rocks ; then crossing the 
moors, and following the course of the Tees, we came to the foot of 
Cronckley Fell, a craggy basaltic mountain, about eighteen hundred 
feet in height.
Ascending it on the western side, we again met with 
Epilobium alsinifolium ; and on the rocks above, saw Arbutus Uva- 
ursi in great abundance, and remarkably full of fruit : it was formerly 
collected in the neighbourhood for medicinal purposes.
On a grassy 
slope near the summit we gathered Dryas octopetala, Hippocrepis 
comosa, Helianthemum canum, Gentiana verna, Juncus triglumis, 
Carex capillaris (in its usual form, about an inch and a half in height), 
1069 
Tofieldia paliistris, Saxifraga hypiioides &c.
Descending by a min- 
er's path, we crossed the Tees and returned to our old quarters.
As there were several localities in the vicinity of the High Force 
which we wished to explore, we concluded to devote the following 
day to this object, and therefore set out for Winch Bridge, a mile and 
a half distant.
On the road-side we gathered a tetragonous Epilo- 
bium, which we took to be E.
virgatum of Babington; we also noticed 
it in several other places in the course of our journey : observation 
upon it in its different localities, leads us to doubt its specific distinc- 
ness from E.
tetragonum.
Winch Bridge, is a small suspension bridge for foot-passengers 
across the high rocks, which here overhang the Tees ; it is prettily 
situated among extensive plantations, and its beauty is much enhan- 
ced by the foaming of the river, as it rushes over the rocks beneath.
Here we found Hieracium Lapeyrousii, rigidum, a.
and $.
(?), muro- 
rum, umbellatum and Lawsoni, Crepis succisaefolia, Thlaspi alpestre, 
Potentilla alpestris, Melarapyrum sylvaticum, Carex rigida ?
Galium 
boreale, Bartsia alpina, Rumex aquaticus, Rubus saxatilis, Equisetum 
variegatum and sylvaticum.
We also discovered a fourth locality for 
Poa Pamellii, and another single plant of Saxifraga umbrosa, /3.
cre- 
nata.
We also observed an Equisetum, evidently different from the 
common species, which proved to be E.
umbrosum.
Though too 
late for the fertile stems, the habit of the plant readily distinguished 
it.
It somewhat resembles small plants of E.
fluviatile [Smith not 
Linn.^, but is paler in colour, and has a deeply furrowed scabrous 
stem, almost destitute of branches on the lower half.
It grew in pro- 
fusion on the Yorkshire side of the river.
After having spent a con- 
siderable time here, we proceeded northward towards a farm-house 
called Moor Riggs, and on the way thither met with Salix laurina and 
amygdalina : Pyrola minor was also gathered sparingly.
In a moist 
meadow near a cottage on the top of a neighbouring hill, we redisco- 
vered Vaccinium uliginosum, which had been gathered there thirty 
years previously, by the late Dr. Oliver and James Backhouse : it is 
confined to a small space, and we could see no traces of either flower 
or fiuit.
Being desirous of examining more completely the various 
Hieracia which abound on the banks of the Tees, we devoted the re- 
mainder of the day to this object, although they were scarcely far 
enough advanced to admit of our doing this satisfactorily.
(To be continued).

â€” Notice of ' Essays on Natural History, chiefly 
Ornithology.^ By Charles Waterton, Esq. Author of 'Wan- 
derings in South America.' Second Series.
London : Long- 
mans, 1844.
The greater portion of this delightful little volume, as may be ga- 
thered from its title, is devoted to Mr. Waterton's favourite science.
Ornithology ; still, it contains quite enough of botanical matter, and 
that, too, of the most pleasing character, to render it a legitimate sub- 
ject for a notice in our pages.
Even were it otherwise, we should 
deem it but a partial discharge of the debt of gratitude due to the 
memory of one, who laboured long and ardently in the cause of sci- 
ence, to aid by our humble efforts the kindly motive which has led 
to the appearance of the present volume of Essays.
The author informs us, in his brief Preface, that when the late Mr.
Loudon requested him to write a few papers which might be formed 
into " a little book of Essays," he had awful fears, lest, in disregard- 
ing the wholesome truth conveyed in the Spanish adage, â€” â€¢ " Happy 
is the man who has written no more than one book," â€” he should lose 
the reputation he had formerly gained by the 'Wanderings.' "Great 
then indeed," continues Mr. Waterton," must be my anxiety on the 
present occasion, when I am rash enough to deviate another time from 
the Spanish line of certitude, into the mazes of chance and danger ; 
where the track which I am to pursue is ill defined and flinty, and 
may possibly lead me and my new little book into some quagmire or 
other ; there to perish without assistance ; the scorn of the critics, 
and the pity of disappointed friends.
However, be this as it may, 
my die is cast, my steam is on, and I am already at the opposite bank 
of the Rubicon." 
In a subsequent paragraph, the author playfully defies the attacks 
of the critics ; telling them that he again offers them half a day of 
occupation, for which they ought to be thankful, " at a season when 
work is not always to be obtained." But what critic could dip his 
pen in gall and therewith record a philippic against a work called in- 
to being by one of the holiest impulses that can direct human actions ?
Who could direct an envenomed shaft against this second volume of 
Essays, after reading the following passage ?
" The volume which I now present to an indulgent public, is an unsolicited dona- 
tion to the widow of my poor departed friend Mr. Loudon, whose vast labours in the 
cause of science have insured to him an imperishable reputation.
If this trifling pre- 
sent on my part shall be the medium of conveying one single drop of balm to the 
1071 
wound, which it has lately pleased Heaven to inflict on the heart of that excellent lady, 
ray time will have been well employed, and my endeavours amply requited." â€” p.
iv.
To those who are acquainted with Mr. Waterton's writings, we 
scarcely need say that from almost every page of the present volume, 
beams forth the same enthusiastic love of Nature and Nature's works 
as gave life and animation to the previous productions of his pen.
And it is pleasant to think that the mind which could conceive and 
the hand that could trace the living pictures of the ' Wanderings,' can 
still, after the wear and tear of sixty years, present us with such de- 
lightful sketches as the following !
Sure we are that the heart of 
every one, who knows aught of the charms of a country life, will ac- 
knowledge its truthfulness.
" To me, whom kind Providence has destined to spend the best part of my time in 
the open air, the song of birds is soothing beyond expression ; and whilst I am admir- 
ing the beauty of the rising flowers around me, I know no greater addition to my gra- 
tification than that of listening to it.
How enchanting is it to inspect the early snow- 
drops, those " fair maids of February," whilst the stormcock is pouring forth his newly 
acquired notes from the top of a neighbouring elm !
and how delightful it is to hear 
cock-robin's carol on the thorn that affords a shelter to the humble primrose !
The 
lily of the valley, too, sweet, lovely, lowly daughter of May, how I gaze in ecstacy ou 
its virgin whiteness, whilst the stranger cuckoo's note sounds through the dell, and in- 
sures me the return of warmer weather [ The chafiinch, too, and the whitethroat, and 
the thrush, and the blackbird, with pretty jenny-wreu, and the hedge-sparrow, all add 
charms inexpressible, by their sweet notes, to the rising flowers of the dale." â€” p.
3. 
Like most country gentlemen, Mr. Waterton, as is well known, has 
certain predilections, or, as some would call them, prejudices, both 
political and religious ; but the Wanderer is too amiable ever to allow 
them to interfere with the charities of private life.
And if, sometimes, 
they will make their appearance in an Essay on Natural History, there 
is always such a redeeming air of pleasantry about them, and a some- 
thing so droll in the union of the two subjects, that it is quite im- 
possible to suppress a smile, even at the most biting of the author's 
sarcasms.
Witness the following Essay on 
" The Powers of Vegetation.
" In those good days of old, when there were no corn-factors in England to coun- 
teract that part of our Eedeemer's prayer, " Give us this day our daily bread," by 
hoarding up vast stores of grain, until mouldiness and vermin have rendered it unfit 
for the use of man, there stood at Walton Hall a water-mill, for the interest of the pro- 
prietor and the good of the country round.
Time, the great annihilator of all human 
inventions, saving taxation and the national debt, laid this fabric low in ruins some 
sixty years ago ; and nothing now remains to show the place where it once stood ex- 
cept a massive millstone, which measures full 17 ft.
in circumference.
The ground 
where the mill stood having been converted into meadow, this stone lay there unno- 
1072 
ticed and unknown (save by the passing hay-maker) from the period of the mill's dis- 
solution to the autumn of the year 1813, when one of our nut-eating wild animals, 
probably by way of a winter store, deposited a few nuts under its protecting cover.
In 
the course of the following summer, a single nut having escaped the teeth of the de- 
stroyer, sent up its verdant shoot through the hole in the centre of the procumbent 
millstone.
" One day I pointed out this rising tree to a gentleman who was standing by ; and 
I said, ' If this young plant escape destruction, some time or other it will support the 
millstone, and raise it from the ground.' He seemed to doubt this.
"In order, however, that the plant might have a fair chance of success, I directed 
that it should be defended from accident and harm by means of a wooden paling.
Year after year it increased in size and beauty ; and when its expansion had entirely 
filled the hole in the centre of the millstone, it gradually began to raise up the mill- 
stone itself from the seat of its long repose.
This huge mass of stone is now 8 inches 
above the ground, and is entirely supported by the stem of the nut-tree, which has ri- 
sen to the height of 25 ft.
and bears excellent fruit.
" Strangers often inspect this original curiosity.
When I meet a visitor whose 
mild physiognomy informs me that his soul is proof against the stormy winds of poli- 
tics, which now-a-days set all the world in a ferment, I venture a small attempt at 
pleasantry, and say, that I never pass this tree and millstone without thinking of poor 
old Mr. Bull, with a weight of eight hundred millions of pounds about his neck." â€” 22.
Kindly afFectioned as he is towards all things that live, yet is Mr.
Waterton's love poured out in its fullest measure upon the feathered 
race.
And in proportion as the tenants of air are protected or perse- 
cuted, defended or injured by other tribes, so are the latter esteemed 
or contemned by the kind-hearted Wanderer.
These feelings are even 
extended to the vegetable kingdom; and among trees and shrubs, 
such as afford to his winged favourites the greatest amount of food 
and shelter, enjoy the largest share of Mr. Waterton's regard.
Of 
these the holly, the yew and the ivy, have each an Essay devoted to 
them, all of which claim our attention.
And standing first in order, 
as the tree apparently does in Mr. Waterton's esteem, we begin with 
a few extracts from the Essay on 
The Holly.
" I am very partial to the holly, the yew, and the ivy.
They give both food and 
shelter to the birds ; whilst their charming green foliage makes us almost forget that 
winter has set in.
The holly claims my preference ; for, in addition to food and shel- 
ter, it affords an impenetrable retreat to those birds which take up their quarters on its 
branches for the night.
" Our ancestors knew and felt the value of the holly hedge, when the wintry blast 
whistled through the naked hawthorn.
Hence they raised it as a barrier against the 
north ; and, on the breaking of the clouds at noon, they would resort to the protection 
which it oflFered, and there enjoy the sun's delightful presence.
But modern innova- 
tion, which, in nine times out of ten, does more harm than good, seems to have con- 
demned the holly hedge as a thing of stiff unsightly form, and in its vacant place has 
1073 
introduced a scanty sprinkling of isolated plants.
I own that I am for the warm ar- 
boreous plan of ancient days; and thus I never pass a garden where yew and holly 
hedges grow, without stopping to admire them, and then I proceed onwards with fa- 
vourahle notions of the owner's taste.
" But, to the holly in particular.
I am so convinced of its utility both to men and 
birds, that I have spared no pains in rearing it as a shelter from the cold, when Boreas 
sure harbinger of storms, sweeps over the dreary waste.
***** 
" I consider a regularly formed clump of hollies to be the perfection of beauty, in 
grouped arboreal design.
One single tree of mountain ash in the centre of this would 
add another charm to it, and would be of use to the ornithologist at the close of sum- 
mer.
When the holly trees are in full bearing, and the berries ripe, we may roam a 
long while through the whole extent of British Botany, before we find a sioht more 
charming to the eye than the intermixture of bright red and green which this lovely 
plant produces.
" I have a fine circular clump of hollies here, under which the pheasants are fed â€¢ 
and to which, throughout the whole of the winter, a vast number of sparrows, green 
linnets, buntings, blackbirds, and some starlings resort, to take their nocturnal repose 
in peace and quiet.
The holly sheds a large proportion of its leaves after the summer 
has set in.
These remain on the ground in thick profusion.
So formidable are their 
hard and pointed spikes to the feet of prowling quadrupeds, that neither the cat nor 
the weasel, nor the foumart, nor the fox, nor even the ever-hungry Hanoverian rat 
dare invade the well-defended territory.
Hence the birds, which in yew-trees and ivv 
would be exposed to inevitable destruction from the attacks of these merciless foes 
are safe from danger in the holly bush," â€” p.
32.
The author feelingly laments over the destruction of the hollj-trees, 
occasianed by a vile practice of " strolling vagabonds," who strip off 
the bart and sell it to the makers of bird-lime.
He says that "so 
common has this act of depredation been in this vicinity, that I should 
be at a loss to find a single holly tree, in any hedge outside of the 
park wall, that has escaped the knife of these unthinking spoilers." 
An instance is adduced of a magnificent variegated holly, which an- 
nually bore a large crop of berries.
One morning the bole of this 
tree was found stripped of its bark for full two feet in length.
The 
tree survived the injury until the third year, when it died.
The Yeiv Tree.
" I am extremely partial to the yew-tree.
It has already repaid me for the pains 
which I have taken in its cultivation ; and when I resort to my usual evening stand 
in order to watch the flocks of sparrows, finches, and starlings, whilst they are dropping 
in upon the neighbouring hollies, I feel not the wintry blast ; as the yew trees, which 
are close at hand, are to me a shield against its fury ; and, in fact, they offer me a 
protection little inferior to that of the house itself.
***** 
" Charming is the appearance of the yew tree after the sun has passed the autum- 
nal equinox.
The delicate crimson of its fruit, with the dark green leaves behind it 
4x 
1074 
pvoiliices an effect so pleasing to the view, that it can scarcely he surpassed by any- 
tliing which the southern forests present to the lover of Botany, as he wanders through 
their mazes.
" The hole of this tree possesses the power of effectually reproducing a supply of 
main branches, after the original ones have been severed from it by the axe of the 
woodman.
At Lupset Hall, the residence of our former honest member for Wake- 
field, Daniel Gaskell, Esq., there stands a lordly yew, by far the most gigantic of any 
in this neighbourhood.
At some period of time, now long gone by, all its larger 
branches have been cut away from the stem.
Others now supply their place ; and by 
the present healthy aspect of the tree, we may conclude that, at some future day, this 
second series of main branches will have attained a growth and vigour equal to what 
the original ones would have presented to us, had they been allowed to remain on the 
tree."â€” p.
60.
Speaking of the yew-trees growing near our old churches, Mr.
Waterton is of opinion that they were planted in such situations for 
"the facility of obtaining sprigs and branches to be used during the 
processions." We must confess this explanation appears to us much 
more feasible than that which attributes the presence of the tree near 
the church to the necessity of keeping up " a good supply of bows in 
case of war." 
In the Essay on the Ivy, the Wanderer's character as the champion 
of calumniated innocence is pleasingly exhibited.
The Essay contains 
a masterly defence of this plant, which has frequently been wrong- 
fully accused of injuring the tree upon which it grows, both by deriv- 
ing nutriment from the supporting plant, like the dodder and other 
parasites, and by so closely entwining the branches as to prevent 
their growth.
Mr. Waterton shows that it does neither the one nor 
the other.
" We live to learn.
I was not sufficiently aware of the value of ivy for the protec- 
tion of the feathered race, until I had seen the pheasant-preserve of the Grand Duke 
of Tuscany, in the year 1817.
It is called the Cascini, and it is a kind of Hyde Park 
for the inhabitants of Florence in their evening recreations.
" At the grove of the Cascini, you see the ivy growing in all its lofty pride and 
beauty.
As I gazed on its astonishing luxuriance, 1 could not help entertaining a 
high opinion of the person, be he alive or dead, through whose care and foresight such 
an effectual protection had been afforded to the wild birds of heaven, in the very midst 
of the ' busy haunts of men.' The trees in this ornamented grove are loaded with a 
profusion of ivy, from their lowest to their topmost branches ; and although crowds of 
fashionable carriages were rolling along the road which surrounds this preserve, I saw 
our common pheasant roving through its walks, with a confidence little inferior to that 
of our own domestic poultry.
As the evening closed in upon us, I observed multi- 
tudes of the smaller birds resorting to the ' ivy-mantled ' trees, in order to enjoy the 
proffered convenience of nocturnal rest and safety.
" I have profited by what I saw in Tuscany, â€” for, on my return to my native 
place, I began the cultivation of ivy with an unsparing hand.
1075 
" There are two sorts of this ever-verdant plant.
The one is denominated Eng- 
lish, the other Irish ivy.
Both are exceedingly graceful in their foliage ; but the first 
is by far the better bearer of fruit.
They will grow on any soil, save that of swamp.
Whilst the plant is on the ground, you have only to cover its long runners with a lit- 
tle earth at intervals of four or five inches, and you will soon have an abundant suj>- 
ply of ivy for ornament ; and for use, as far as the birds are concerned.
This is a 
surer way of obtaining plants, than by cutting them at once from the climbing ivy.
" Ivy can only attain its greatest perfection through the intervention of foreign bo- 
dies.
It travels onward in a lowly state upon the ground, until it reaches some inclin- 
ed or perpendicular object, up which it ascends.
In due time it then puts out lateral 
branches, and obtains a bole, as though it were a forest tree itself.
Ivy derives no 
nutriment from the timber tree to which it adheres.
It merely makes use of a tree or 
wall, as we ourselves do of a walking-stick, when old age or infirmities tell us that we 
cannot do without it.
Should an ancient wall and ivy come in contact, they are of 
great assistance to each other.
Dyer observed this on Grongar hill : â€” 
' Whose aged walls the ivy creeps.
And with her arms from falling keeps : 
So, both a safety from the wind 
In mutual dependence find.' 
There can be no doubt as to the real source from whence ivy draws life and vigour : 
from the ground alone its maintenance proceeds.
To be convinced of this, we have 
only to inspect it narrowly on a living tree, and then pay the same attention to it up- 
on a dead one, or upon any stump deprived of vitality.
Be our eye as keen as that of 
the lynx, we shall not be able to perceive that the one plant is more healthy, more vi- 
gorous, or more verdant than the other ; and if we cut through the stock of the ivy in 
either situation, we shall see that its upper parts will wither and die, down to the place 
through which the knife has passed.
" Some few years ago, a tall sycamore tree stood on this island, in a row with four 
others.
A remnant of its once fine bole still occupies the place which the tree adorn- 
ed in the days of its prosperity.
An unexpected appearance of fungus showed that all 
was not right within ; and, ere long, a gale of wind cut the tree nearly in two, sending 
its head and all its branches (saving one), with a colony of young jackdaws, down into 
the lake below.
The remaining portion of the tree, spared by the gale, put out new 
shoots from every part of its circumference.
But scarcely had these vegetated for four 
succeeding summers, when another immense fungus made its appearance about two 
yards from the truncated top, and all vegetation ceased that year, down to the part 
where the fungus had come out.
Below this, the trunk was still alive; but another 
fungus, of equal dimensions with the last, showed itself about five feet from the ground, 
and deprived the bole of all vegetation upwards.
" At length this sickly remnant of the sycamore tree received its final doom ; for, 
last summer, a vast profusion of fungus pushed up its circular cakes even from below 
the surface of the ground ; and on their coming to maturity all the living powers with- 
in this ill-treated tree expired.
The bole now stands a dead and unproductive stump.
Any day, a north-west wind, sweeping across the water, may lay it low for ever.
Did 
the ivy, which I had planted at the base many years ago, depend upon this bole for 
succour, it would now be dead and withered ; but, on the contrary, that remaining 
part of it, free from mutilation when the different portions of the tree fell down, is now 
in verdure, and in primest vigour ; but as it has no longer an opportunity fif creeping 
4x2 
1076 
upwards, on account of the misfortunes wliicb have befallen the tree, it has assumed 
llie form of a hush, with dense and widely spreading foliage." â€” p.
68.
Mr. Waterton planted ivy at the foot of many trees, " and refused 
it to others in the immediate vicinity, and on the same soil," but a 
minute inspection shows no difference in the appearance of the trees, 
all being equally healthy and flourishing.
He continues : â€” 
" Neither is this to be wondered at when we reflect that the ivy has its roots in the 
ground itself, and that it does not ascend in spiral progress round the bole and branch- 
es of the tree ; its leading shoot is perpendicular.
Hence it is not in a condition to 
compress injuriously the expansive powers of the tree, proportionally stronger than its 
own.
Thus we find that the ivy gradually gives way before them ; so that on remov- 
ing the network (if it may be so called) which the ivy has formed on the bole of the 
tree, we find no indentations there.
" But woodbine acts the reverse of this.
Its process is spiral, and it becomes, as it 
were, an immovable hoop on the plant which it has embraced.
As the woodbine, by its 
circumambient position cannot give way, the plant must consequently protrude wher- 
ever it is not compressed, till at last the woodbine becomes nearly buried in it.
Thus 
we account for the fantastic form of walking-sticks, which are often to be seen at the 
shop doors of curious venders.
The spiral hollows in these sticks are always formed 
by the woodbine, never by the ivy." â€” p.
73.
Before we conclude we must direct our readers' attention to one 
thing which the author has much at heart.
Mr. Waterton is exceed- 
ingly anxious that trial should be made of the Wourali poison, in 
cases of that dreadful and hitherto incurable malady â€” hydropJiohia.
He observes, that it is right to give the sufferer a chance of saving 
his life by the application of an untried agent of great power, which, 
even if it do not save life, would at least "render death calm and free 
from pain." In cases of hydrophobia Mr. Waterton wishes that early 
aplication should be made, either to himself, at Walton Hall, Wake- 
field, Yorkshire ; or to Mr. Sibson, at the General Hospital, Notting- 
ham.
Such application " will be most punctually attended to." 
The few choice extracts we have culled from this delightful book, 
will, we trust, have the effect of inducing our readers to aid the be- 
nevolent design of the amiable Wanderer, by purchasing the volume 
itself.
To its pages we would refer for much pleasing matter relative 
to the culture of the holly, the yew and the ivy; gigantic raspberries, 
wild and cultivated, fourteen feet high ; quadrupeds, birds, scenery, 
adventures by sea and land, both pleasant and perillous ; â€” all these 
subjects, and numerous others, are graphically treated in the Essays, 
and in the ' Continuation of the Autobiography of the Author ' there- 
unto prefixed.
And further, we would express a hearty hope, that the 
accomplished author may be led to reconsider his determination, and 
so favour us, at no distant period, with more of his delightful Essays;

Note on Anthyllis vulneraria.
In reply to Mr. C.
C. Babing- 
ton's enquiry (Phytol.
1019) respecting my diadelphous state of An- 
thyllis vulneraria, I regret to state that all the specimens I have by 
me are monadelphous, or, as Mr. Babington observes, with one fila- 
ment free at the base and summit.
What became of the identical 
plants I examined in the fresh state, I know not.
Mr. Ralfs, to whom 
1 shovred my plant before I sent the note for insertion in your pages 
(Phytol.
1000), desires me to say that on my mentioning the subject 
to him, he supposed me to be in error, or to have separated one fila- 
ment by violence in dissection ; but on examining a flower in my spe- 
cimen, found it decidedly diadelphous.

A few more words on the London Catalogue.
For reasons 
best known to himself, your respected correspondent, the attempted 
vindicator of the London Catalogue (Phytol.
1014), has carefully left 
untouched the main points of Mr. Sidebotham's letter or critique in 
the May No.
(Id. 972).
He may say, perhaps, that the details of the 
letter occupied no place in his attention while penning the defence : 
in fact he tells us at the outset, that he writes merely at the suggestion 
of the "editorial note" appended thereto.
But standing forth as does 
Mr. Dennes, the champion of the new list, especially too as he con- 
descends to notice some part of the letter, it was certainly to be 
expected that he would hare entered at greater length upon its more 
important portions.
To this, again, he may reply by repeating that 
Mr. Sidebotham's strictures were mostly founded on misapprehension, 
and therefore did not call for special answer.
If it is a misapprehen- 
sion that Viola odorata is marked in the list as an introduced plant, 
and that the numerous changes specified by Mr. Sidebotham, are 
meant to be literally intei^preted, of course there is no need for expla- 
nation.
But there can be no mistaking the facts which he has cited ; 
and as the letter was simply one of enquiry, â€” as Mr. Sidebotham 
evidently had no other object in view than ascertaining the reasons 
for certain changes, [ do hope next month's ' Phytologist' will be a 
satisfactory one in the matter of reply.
To come however to particu- 
lars.
Mr. Sidebotham never " accused " the London Society of mak- 
ing " extensive changes in nomenclature." He merely enquired why 
the new nomenclature introduced by the Edinburgh Catalogue and 
other publications, with good stated reasons, was not adhered to, in- 
stead of older names being in great measure restored.
This circum- 
stance is the more remarkable from the interest which the London list 
professes to take in the convenience of foreign botanists: inasmuch 
1078 
as it rejects the very means which the Edinburgh Catalogue tells us 
is best calculated to promote it, namely, similarity of names !
By the 
way, when dethroning the usurper, Carex irrigua, and restoring the 
rightful appellation of glauca, why not carry out the principle, and 
print humilis instead of clandestina ?
A far more important feature 
in the London Catalogue, is the change of rank forced upon certain 
species and varieties.
Mr. Dennes does not even touch upon this : 
because the cases quoted by Mr. Sidebotham were " misapprehen- 
sions " I presume.
I may be falling into the same error myself, ne- 
vertheless, I beg to enquire for information's sake, why Ranunculus 
fluitans is only a variety, while circinatus is a species ?
Why is Lo- 
tus major a species, and hispidus a variety ?
Why are Scirpus pun- 
gens, Rumex aquaticus, Juncus difFusus and Prunus avium varieties 
only ?
Why is Senecio aquaticus only a variety of Jacobsea ?
Why 
is Scrophularia Ehrharti a var.
of nodosa ?
Why are Potamogeton 
filiformis and zosteraceus varieties, if oblongus and plantagineus are 
species ?
Why separate Lamium album and maculatum, and combine 
amplexicaule and intermedium, the two former being more nearly al- 
lied than the two latter ?
If Glyceria Borreri is to be referred to dis- 
tans, why not both to maritima ?
And lastly, if Carex irrigua is a 
variety, why not also rariflora?
Then again, we have several novelties 
in genera, which it would be desirable to have explained.
For in- 
stance : â€” Why is Armoracia adopted, and not Erucastrum ?
Why 
Schoberia and not Halimus ?
Why are Sinapis Monensis and S.
Cheiranthus placed in that genus, and not in Brassica, whilst nigra, 
incana, muralis and tenuifolia are also there ?
As to the distinction 
of native and naturalized species, it appears to me that nothing could 
be more straightforward that Mr. Sidebotham's enquiries.
He did 
not so much seek to ascertain the motive for including or excluding 
certain species, as to elicit the principle or plan which had been fol- 
lowed in estimating our Flora, as elsewhere in re-adjusting nomencla- 
ture and relative rank.
What is there in his letter that can be said 
to justify or even to call for Mr. Dennes' ironical challenge ; espe- 
cially when it so overflows with " misconceptions " ?
May I ask why 
Ononis reclinata is not, while Veronica Buxbaumii is, a true native ?
What difference is there between the claims of Fedia auricula and F.
carinata and dentata ?
Why give Bupleurum falcatum, Salvia pra- 
tensis and Achillea tomentosa as naturalized ?
Has Narcissus Pseu- 
do-narcissus any better right to be called wild than Galanthus ?
It 
would be easy to ask fifty more such questions with reference to the 
London Catalogue.
For the present I will leave it.
Should we be 
favoured with another vindicatory lettei', I do hope it will bear upon 
1079 
the points at issue rather than those minor features of the list, which, 
as no one would object to them, require no further remark.

Note on Anthyllis Vulneraria.
The observations in the two 
last numbers (Phytol.
1000 and 1019), have induced me to examine 
more closely the position of the stamens in Anthyllis Vulneraria.
The 
plant grows close at hand in this neighbourhood, and in great abun- 
dance upon the cliffs and broken land ; I have thus been enabled to 
consult numerous specimens.
But as the result of my enquiries does 
not appear to agree with the remarks either of Mr. Greenwood or Mr.
Babington, I give it in full, hoping some light may thereby be thrown 
on the subject.
One stamen is perfectly free at the base and extre- 
mity, as in Diadelphia ; and, in the young state of the plant is united 
to the other nine, as Mr. Babington observes, throughout most of its 
length : but generally [separates] first from the base, meeting and 
joining the left hand united filaments ; and at the summit separating 
last firom the filaments on the same side.
I have found it adhering to 
the filaments on the right hand.
This is the state of the stamens be- 
fore the bursting of the anthers; after they have performed their func- 
tion, the central stamen gradually separates from the right hand united 
filaments, continuing more or less adherent to those on the left.
In 
some instances I have found the separation so decided that the single 
stamen could be removed without difficulty.
When the seed is ma- 
tured it forces its way through the slit, but owing to the shrinking and 
contraction of the stamens at their summit, a curious appearance is 
presented, the threadlike style being still confined at its extremity.

Note on Iris foetidissima with double flowers.
I beg to en- 
close you a double blossom of Iris foetidissima, which I found to-day 
growing near this town.
I do not know whether it is sufficiently rare 
to merit a notice in a botanical journal ; but never having seen a dou- 
ble Iris, either among cultivated or wild plants, I thought it might 
prove interesting to you.
The plant was growing in a ditch, among 
some tufts of common ones, and had three or four bunches of flowers 
as double as those I now send ; while upon the other plants the seed 
was nearly ripe.

Crepis biennis a Kentish Plant.
As I believe considerable 
doubt has been entertained with reference to the occurrence of Crepis 
biennis in Kent, the very different and distinct Barkhausia taraxaci- 
folia having been repeatedly mistaken for it; I have much pleasure 
in communicating to the pages of 'The Phytologist,' a recently verified 
habitat for the true plant ; my specimens of which, several of them 
1080 
full four feel, high, I had the good fortune to meet with in June last, 
at the hamlet of Bush by Cuxton, growing near the copse or shaw by 
the foot-path, just beyond and leading from the street of Bush, over 
the meadows and cornfields, towards Hailing on the Medway.
My 
plant is identical with authentic specimens collected near Cambridge 
a few seasons ago ; and likewise with others from near Twycross, Lei- 
cestershire, kindly contributed to my herbarium by the Rev. Andrew 
Bloxam.

Silene Armeria.
Of this interesting plant, formerly noticed 
" on the banks of the Dee near Chester, and by the Ribble beyond 
Settle, Yorkshire," but now no longer to be recognized in those loca- 
lities, I obtained several good specimens last year from a veiy wild 
station near the Medway, towards Yalding, far from house or garden ; 
and a few others this season, from the same spot, although (probably 
from the excessive drought with which we were so long visited), of 
dwarfish growth.

Dianthus Armeria.
Mr. Babington marks this species as 
" rare," (Manual, 40).
It occurs in many places near here.
It affects 
chalky and gravelly wastes and banks.
I have noticed it in abun- 
dance this season at Crocking-hill, between St. Mary Cray and Fara- 
ingham ; at Stone, beyond Dartford ; and in numberless other localities 
in the cross-country lanes between Farningham and Gravesend.

Plants at Erith, 1844.
To the town-immured student, whose 
opportunities for botanical strolls, being few and far between, render 
of value the merest hint as to the locality of an interesting plant, â€” I 
beg to observe that I have noticed this season at Erith, growing about 
the marshes and wastes, within the shortest distance from the newly- 
erected pier, among numberless more common species, â€” Polypogon 
MonspeliensiSj Apera Spica-venti, Barkhausia taraxacifolia (very abun- 
dant), Petroseliuum segetum, Onopordum Acanthium, Sisymbrium 
Sophia and Carduus tenuiflorus ; the three last named most plentiful 
and luxuriant.

Plants at EltJiam, 1844.
Hutchinsia petrrea still retains its 
old haunts about the walls of the church-yard.
I gathered fine spe- 
cimens from thence in April last.
This is the only recorded station 
for Hutchinsia near the metropolis ; which, if the plant be truly indi- 
genous here, is a very interesting fact.
Misgivings have arisen among 
botanists as to the possible introduction of its near neighbour, Cen- 
tranthus calcitrapa, which has located itself on the same and adjoining 
walls ; but I am not aware that the truthfulness of this station for 
Hutchinsia has ever been questioned.
Ceutranthus calcitrapa also 
1081 
appeared this year, but certainly not in abundance (Phytol.
617).
The 
old walls of Sherard's garden have been lately repaired, and the inter- 
stices cemented and otherwise fdled up, to the probable eventual de- 
struction of our plant.
Linaria pui^jurea will doubtless in time be 
well established at Eltham : I could have collected upwards of a 
wheelbarrow load in July, all self sown about walls and wastes.

Note on Asplenium fontanum.
I was rather disappointed to 
find that the author of the ' History of the British Ferns' has not no- 
ticed Asplenium fontanum in the new edition of his work.
On the 
19th of last month I had the pleasure of receiving from Henry Shep- 
herd, of the Liverpool Botanic Gardens, a single frond of a wild spe- 
cimen, found by himself in the year 1826, on the rocks above Matlock.

Note on Mr. Gibnoti's Paper on Carices.
Although I fully 
agree with Mr. Gibson's observation on the value of scientific contro- 
versy (Phytol.
1038), when conducted in a proper spirit, and solely 
with a view to elicit truth, yet, as I see no utility in prolonging the 
discussion on the disputed Carices, unless some new facts could be 
advanced on either side of the question, 1 have not the slightest in- 
tention of replying to that gentleman's criticisms.
But as 1 have 
been unfortunate enough to call forth some severe observations rela- 
tive to the share which two of my esteemed correspondents have had 
in the matter under discussion, I deem it my duty to take up the cud- 
gels in their behalf, and in one instance to expose something very like 
a mistake, to give it no harsher name, into which Mr. G.
appears to 
have fallen.
In the first place, in justice to Mr. Sidebotham, I must 
beg to state, that all the specimens of the di.sputed Carex which 1 
have received from that gentleman, perfectly agree with those subse- 
quently forwarded by Dr. Wood.
And further, that in the course of 
my correspondence with Mr. S., I have not once had occasion to ac- 
cuse him of carelessness or negligence in naming the specimens of 
plants with which he has favoured me.
The mistake which he can- 
didly confessed to Mr. Gibson, is one which any of us might have run 
into ; and having been acknowledged in the confidence of a private 
letter, that confidence certainly ought not to have been violated.
In 
the second place, with regard to the discovery of Carex paradoxa in 
Yorkshire, quoting Mr. Gibson's own word.s, I may remark, that what 
he has " said on the subject, would, 1 think, have been much better 
if it had been correct." Wishing to see when and by whom Mr.
1082 
Spruce had been anticipated in his discovery of that plant in York- 
shire, I carefully looked through Baines's ' Flora of Yorkshire ' (to 
which Mr. Gibson refers us for this information), aye, examined it 
" from title-page to colophon," Addenda and all, but not a word could 
I find about Carex paradoxa.
The only Carices named as growing in 
Ascham bogs, are C.
teretiuscula and C.
Pseudo-cyperus ; and neither 
under these species, nor in any other part of the book, so far at least 
as I can see, is there anything to invalidate the claim of Mr. Spruce 
to the honor of having been the first to discover C.
paradoxa in York- 
shire, and consequently in England.

Note on Mr. Gihsofi's Remarks on Carices.
On receiving the 
last number of * The Phytologist,' I was a little surprized to find that 
Mr. Gibson, in the exercise of his combative propensities, has thought 
fit to make an unprovoked attack upon me.
As it is just possible that 
some one may be misled by it, I trouble you with a word of explana- 
tion.
Mr. G.
speaks of my sending the fruit of Carex teretiuscula to 
Mr. Babington, by mistake, instead of that of the supposed C.
pseu- 
do-paradoxa.
The mistake was speedily discovered and as speedily 
corrected.
Did Mr. Gibson never make a mistake ?
He says that 
Carex paradoxa was published in Baines's * Flora of Yorkshire,' 
(Phytol.
1043) ; has any one else seen it there ?
He complains that 
I have sent different plants to several individuals as his Carex pseu- 
do-paradoxa.
The fact is, a somewhat variable plant grows at Sea- 
man's Moss-pits ; this plant Mr. Gibson says is a new one, and he 
calls it his Carex pseudo-paradoxa.
The specimens sent by me to 
Mr. Luxford and Mr. King, and to which he alludes, were all collected 
there.
If the plants will not square exactly with Mr. Gibson's de- 
scription, it is their fault, not mine; of course, Mr. Gibson cannot 
be under a mistake.
Mr. G.
has no occasion to visit Seaman's Moss- 
pits to obtain his plant ; it grows in several places in the immediate 
vicinity of Manchester, presenting variable appearances, which differ 
almost as much from each other, as from the normal state of Carex 
teretiuscula.

Note on Coronopus didyma.
It may not be uninteresting to 
the London readers of ' The Phytologist,' to know that the West of 
England plant, Coronopus didyma, occurs rather plentifully in Kew 
church-yard.
I found it in that locality yesterday.
It is probably a 
derivative from the Royal gardens, but it seems to have made itself 
quite at home, and promises to become a permanent addition to our 
Flora, if collectors will but show it a little indulgence.

Excursion of the Linnean Club.
The Linnean Club made its 
first excursion for the season, on Wednesday, the 3rd of July.
Black 
Nottley church-yard, the burial place of the immortal Ray, being fixed 
on as the terminus of their pilgrimage, the members of the club left 
London by an early train, and arrived at the Witham station of the 
Eastern Counties railway about 10 o'clock; thence repairing to the 
White Hart at Witham, they sate down to a most substantial break- 
fast, which completely fortified them for their journey to Black Nott- 
ley, a distance of five miles, safely accomplished in a variety of car- 
riages.
Arrived at Black Nottley, they were met by Mr. Patterson, 
the present resident in the house once occupied by the illustrious na- 
turalist in whose honour the excursion was projected.
Mr. Patterson 
invited them to call on him, and gave them a very cordial reception, 
having provided an elegant and bountiful luncheon.
When the mem- 
bers of the club felt sufficiently recruited by partaking of Mr. Patter- 
son's good fare, they re-entered their carriages and returned to dine at 
the White Hart, at Witham, Mr. Forster, V.P.L.S., presiding.
The 
dinner passed off with the utmost unanimity and good feeling ; and 
the party returned to London by the half-past 6 o'clock train, and ar- 
rived at Shoreditch about 8, highly delighted with the day's occupa- 
tions, and unanimously regretting that, owing to the arrangement of 
the trains, they could not have prolonged their stay to a later hour.
There were present, the Lord Bishop of Norwich, P.L.S.
(who was 
obliged to return to London in the early part of the day).
Dr. Robert 
Brown, V.P.L.S., Edward Forster, Esq., V.P.L.S., Dr. Lankester, and

Note on the British Species of CEnanthe.
While at home for 
only two or three days, I have seen Mr. Babington's note on these 
plants (Phytol.
1060), and I trust that some words of comment upon it 
may be in time for a hint to collectors in September.
Mr. B.
says 
that he knows of localities for QE.
pimpinelloides only in three coun- 
ties.
I possess imperfect specimens from other localities than those 
named, and have gathered the same species on a hedge-bank in the 
Isle of Wight.
But not having obtained any series sufficient to show 
both root and fruit from the same locality, I was unable to speak with 
confidence about them, before seeing the specimens from Mr. Lees ; 
because, the other characters (taken from the leaves and involucres) 
were inadequate to sepai'ate my specimens of QE.
pimpinelloides from 
those received as CE.
peucedanifolia.
On comparing the specimens 
1084 
from Mr. Lees with my cultivated plant, which I knew to be the spe- 
cies, thus named from the Unio Itineraria, the existence of the same 
species in Britain seemed sufficiently certain ; and I presume it likely 
to be found scattered through great part of England.
I cannot say 
that I yet know exactly what Mr. Babington means by CE.
Lachena- 
lii, and should not be surprised to find it identical, as a species, with 
the Q^.
peucedanifolia of the same author.
At all events, I have ne- 
ver seen British specimens with roots such as are described for the 
QL.
Lachenalii.
But I have already explained, in the London Jour- 
nal of Botany,' (Feb. 1844), that the roots of GE.
pimpinelloides, and 
probably also those of " CE.
peucedanifolia" (so usually named by 
collectors) vary very much with age ; appearing absolutely without 
tubercles or other enlargements at one season of the year, if the wi- 
thered remains of those of the preceding summer be overlooked, I 
can now add that I have seen long, fusiform, fleshy, sessile roots (much 
like those of the Dahlia in miniature) on the true GE.
pimpinelloides, 
although the roots of that plant are usually slender, with an oval tu- 
bercle on each, an inch or two below the base of the flowering stem.
I would here request collectors to obtain materials for determining 
whether really there are two other species in this country, in addition 
to CE.
pimpinelloides, which is quite clear and certain.
Not having 
yet seen the papers of Mr. Ball and Mr. Babington, in the Annals, I 
am still unaware what evidence they adduce to establish the two other 
alleged species.
The CE.
peucedanifolia of the London Catalogue 
includes both these two species, if two such exist.
Until reading the 
note of Mr. Babington, I was fully under the impression that I had 
sent him, last winter, specimens of CE.
pimpinelloides, to illustrate 
the changes in the character of its root, with advancing age ; at the 
same time informing him that the specimens were descendants from a 
plant collected in the Isle of Wight.

Yorkshire Locality for Asplenium fontanum.
Allow me to 
add to the already few habitats for that rare fern, Asplenium fonta- 
num.
Smith, three fronds of which I collected in Wharncliffe wood, 
Yorkshire, in the year 18.38, and which I now enclose for your in- 
spection.
I shall feel obliged by your returning them at your leisure, 
as they are all the wild specimens in my herbarium.
I have this year, 
July, 1844, examined the locality, but have not been successful, not 
beino- able to find the precise spot where I gathered the enclosed.

Yorksliire Locality for Lastraa Thelypteris.
In July of the 
present year, I found two imperfect fronds of Lastraea Thelypteris, 
Presl, in a damp place in Wharncliflfe wood, a locality which Mr.
Newman has not named, either in his County List of Yorkshire ferns 
(Phytol.
449), or in his late edition of the Ferns.
I left the root, not 
wishing to destroy the habitat, and could not discover more than two 
fronds.
A single plant of Neottia Nidus-avis grew near it.

Reply to the Enquiry about Bartramia falcata, Hook., Linn.
Trans.
&c.
(Phytol.
1035), I have examined the original specimen, 
and consider it to be as distinct from Bartramia calcarea, Br. Sf Sch.y 
as that species is from B.
fontana.
B. uncinata {Schwcegr., Suppl.
t. 
57) may be a small variety of B, calcarea, but the locality (Guade- 
loupe and Martinique) renders this inference somewhat hazardous.
B. calcarea grows on Hale Moss, near Altrinchara, Cheshire, with 
both kinds of inflorescence, but without fruit : I have never seen it 
elsewhere.
On the subject of B.
calcarea, I must beg leave to say, 
that the unilateral direction of the leaves is not, in every species of 
moss, perhaps not even in this, a character to be safely depended up- 
on.
The seta in Bartramia, as in all acrocarpous genera, is essen- 
tially terminal.
Andraea nivalis and A.
Rothii are abuiadantly distinct 
species, but 1 cannot say as much for Dicranum falcatum and D.
Starkii, wdiich, on the Clova mountains, present many intermediate 
forms.
The true calyptra of Polytrichum is the small scariose inte- 
gument immediately in contact with the operculum.
I have myself 
met with similar instances to that described by Mr. Edraonston.
The 
apparent unity of the two calyptrae arises simply from mutual adhe- 
sion of the hairlike fibres which cover the true calyptra, and are in- 
serted near its apex.
Such an appearance may be expected whenever 
two perfect and contiguous archegonia are developed.
I have a spe- 
cimen of a Bryum, where two setae, in similar circumstances, have be- 
come incorporated in their lower half, presenting the appearance of a 
forked fruit-stalk.
With regard to the validity of the species retained 
or proposed as such by Bruch and Schimper, every one will form his 
own judgment ; but I would suggest the propriety of studying the 
subject with diligence and attention, before any condemnation be 
passed upon their positions.
This is the least mark of deference due 
to authors, who have the merit of having abolished so many spurious 
species, and of having reduced them to their proper rank of varieties.
Whatever praise they are entitled to as discriminators, they have ac- 
quired it in consequence of having systematically applied those very 
characters which Mr, E.
terms trivial.
Perhaps these may find more 
1086 
favour in his eyes on further acquaintance, or he will see it necessaiy 
to modify still more his encomium.
Though I do not agree with Br.
and Sch. on every point, I should hesitate to pronounce any such cen- 
sure as that contained in Mr. E.'s remarks.
Their work deserves to 
be studied, and should not be lightly criticised.

The Treasurer read a paper on three genera of Desmidieee, by Mr.
John Ralfs, Penzance, viz-, Desmidium, Glseoprium and Schistochilum.
Mr. James M'Nab read a portion of his Journal of a Tour in the 
United States and Canadas.
In the last notice, Mr. M'Nab gave an 
account of the excursion from Albany to Troy, and thence to Still- 
water, with notices of the most interesting plants observed during the 
journey thither; the present portion is chiefly confined to observa- 
tions on the Botany of the same district.
July 15.
â€” In the early part 
of the day a severe thunder storm, accompanied with much rain, pre- 
vented the party from going abroad, but afforded an opportunity for 
arranging the specimens already collected.
The storm having abated 
towards the afternoon, they were enabled to make a short excursion 
along the banks of the Hudson ; few species, however, rewarded their 
exertions, the greater portion being out of flower ; of those gathered, 
the most attractive were Lobelia cardinalis and Habenaria fimbriata, 
both in great abundance, the rich spikes of scarlet flowers of the for- 
mer being admirably contrasted with the delicate purple blossoms of 
the latter : these two species formed the bulk of the flowering plants.
Mixed with them, but more sparingly, Habenaria lacera and Neottia 
cernua occurred, with Apocymum androseemifolium, the latter being 
the most abundant, and covered with a beautiful Coleopterous insect, 
which appeared to be peculiar to it.
On the sloping banks of the 
1087 
river, in thickets of sumachs, hazels, willows, &c., a gigantic species 
of Solomon's seal, Polygonatum latifolium, was observed ; some of the 
specimens measured seven feet nine inches in height, with roots four 
inches in circumference.
In several places the ground was so matted 
over with the stems of the poison oak, Rhus toxicodendron, that the 
hands of the party were much blistered in endeavouring to extiicate 
themselves.
July 16.
â€” Having procured a canoe, the party proceeded 
about two miles down the river ; during this short voyage they ob- 
served vast quantities of the shells of the fresh-water muscle, covering 
the little sandy hills by the river's edge, which had been collected by 
the musk-rats, with which the banks everywhere abound.
At this 
place the rapidity of the stream, which had hitherto prevented the 
growth of aquatic plants, became much diminished, and they now ob- 
ser\^ed large portions of its surface covered with Nuphar Kalmiana 
and advena, together with Nymphaea rosea, all beautifully in flower, 
and growing from a depth of eight feet.
Overhanging the banks on 
both sides of the river, Salix petiolaris was in fine condition, its broad, 
lunate stipules adding much to the beauty and singularity of its ap- 
pearance ; here also, some fine specimens of the Virginian poplar 
{Populus monilifera) were seen, the largest stems measured were nine 
feet in circumference, and about seventy feet in height.
Leaving Stillwater, the party proceeded by canal to Whitehall.
On 
the banks of the canal, and extending over the neglected fields, such 
quantities of the great mullein ( Verhascum Thapsus) were observed, 
as to give the idea of its having been sown for a crop.
The fact of 
its growing on the soil which had recently been thrown out of the ca- 
nal, as well as on the sloping banks, convinced them that the seed 
must have lain buried in the earth, probably for a long series of years, 
and that, therefore, it is not likely, as has been generally supposed, 
that this plant has been introduced by the emigrants, but rather that 
it is indigenous to the country.
The common St. John's wort [Hyperi- 
cum perforatum) was also extremely abundant in this district, although 
sparingly seen before, and is described by Mr. M'Nab as one of the 
greatest evils the American farmer has to contend with, being sup- 
posed to be highly injurious to cattle, especially horses, causing blind- 
ness, which prevailed in many parts to a fearful extent.
On reaching Whitehall, situated at the southern extremity of Lake 
Champlain, two remarkable species of ferns were observed for the first 
time ; namely, Asplenium rhizophyllum and Aspidiura bulbiferum : 
the former growing on the surfaces of moist rocks, where it throws out 
its fronds, which take root at their extremities ; while the latter bears 
1088 
a number of small bulbs along the rachis, wbich, when mature^ fall 
off and vegetate in the crevices of the rocks.
Many other interesting 
plants were observed, but few of them in flower, with the exception of 
Rubus spectabilis, Desmodium acuminatum and canadense, and a few 
others.
Mr. M'Nab afterwards exhibited several specimens of gooseberries 
and currants, which had been kept for the last two years in glasses, 
containing water only, in which they had now matured their fruit for 
the second time ; and it was remarkable that the gooseberries {^yellow 
amber), and the red and white currants, were as highly flavoured as 
the same sorts under ordinary treatment.
Mr. Trevelyan exhibited specimens of some remarkable varieties of 
Taraxacum ofiicinale, found on the sandy beach near Arbroath, and 
a curious variety of Aspidium Filix-femina from Braemar, having the 
fr'ond branched at the extremity.
The specimens were afterwards 
presented to the Society.

â€” Notes of a Botanical Ramble in YorksJiire S^c.
in the Summer of 1844.
Communicated by James Backhouse, 
Jun.
(Continued from p.
1069).
On the 4tli of 7th Month we finally quitted our quarters at the High 
Force, and sending our luggage round by the turnpike road, we 
crossed the moors separating Teesdale from the valley of the Lune.
Crossing the foot-bridge below the fall, we took a southerly direction.
Near a farm house just above the bridge, we gathered a few specimens 
of Peucedanum Ostruthium.
For several miles we walked over high 
moor-land, presenting little variety : we noticed Sedum villosum, Cal- 
tha palustris, |3.
minor, and Potamogeton plantagineus.
In the bed 
of a stream near the head of Lunedale, we found Galium pusillum, 
which we have not yet noticed in Teesdale.
On reaching the road 
from Middleton to Brough, we followed it for several miles, till we 
came to the head of Swindale, a precipitous glen beautifully wooded 
on both sides.
Having heard that Asarum europium had been found 
in this neighbourhood, several years ago, we were very desirous of 
meeting with it, but our time was so limited, and the woods were so 
extensive, that we soon saw there was little probability of our finding 
it.
We made our way along the bottom, over the rough rocky bed of 
a mountain torrent, and were repaid for our toil by discovering ano- 
ther locality for Equisetum umbrosum, the more interesting as it was 
in another county (Westmoreland).
We also noticed Hieraciura mu- 
rorum and Lawsoni, and in the lower part of the glen we gathered 
Equisetum hyemale and Epilobium an gusti folium, both of which were 
very abundant.
Regaining the high road we passed through the lit- 
tle town of Brough, which is situated near the foot of a ragged lime- 
stone scar, and took the road for Kirkby Stephen, where we stopped 
that night.
The following morning we took the Hawes road, and entered the 
deep glen of Mallerstang, which is bounded on each side by lofty hills 
attaining to 2330 feet in height.
Soon after leaving Kirkby Stephen, 
we found Stachys ambigua in small quantity.
From the length of the 
journey before us, we had not time to examine the craggy sides of the 
4 Y 
1090 
hills round Mallerstang, but we have little doubt that a botanist who 
could devote a few days to this district would be well repaid.
At the 
upper end of the valley, the river (here forming the boundary between 
Yorkshire and Westmoreland) flows through a narrow limestone gorge 
occasionally not more than three or four feet wide, yet in some places 
nearly a hundred feet in depth.
This gorge, from its depth and dark- 
ness, has acquired the name of Hell-gill.
Turning towards the west, 
we ascended the southern ridge of Wild-boar Fell.
It was covered 
in most places with ling, and we saw only Vaccinium Oxycoccus in 
addition to the plants previously noticed as occurring on hills of a si- 
milar character.
The view from the summit was fine, embracing the 
greater part of Howgill Fells, the valley of the Lune, and Morecambe 
Bay in the distance.
Descending the side of Swarthfell, we followed 
a mountain path for some time, and after passing over the foot of 
Bowfell, we came into the main road, about three miles from Sedbergh.
The following morning we set off" to visit Cautley Spout, a water- 
fall on Howgill Fells about six miles from Sedbergh.
On the wooded 
banks of the river we gathered Stellaria nemorum and Circaea alpina, 
/3.
intermedia.
In the hedges we noticed Rosa inodora and Mentha 
rubra.
Leaving the main road, we took a path which led to the foot 
of Cautley Spout, and commenced ascending the rocks by its side.
This fall is composed of a series of beautiful cascades, which pour 
over the dark slate rocks from a considerable elevation.
Howgill 
Fells are a cluster of round-topped slate mountains, covered in some 
parts with debris and short grass.
Among the loose stones we no- 
ticed patches of Allosorus crispus, of greater size and luxuriance than 
any we had met with previously.
On the rocks by the side of the fall 
we found Alchemilla alpina growing in great abundance ; and higher 
up the mountain we were struck with the great profusion of Lycopo- 
dium Selago and alpinum, especially of the former.
Here our party 
agreed to separate ; two of them descended the eastern side, and on 
their way to Sedbergh gathered CEnanthe crocata, which was plen- 
tiful in a moist meadow.
The others ascended to the summit, and 
were amply repaid by the magnificent prospect.
In one direction, 
the southern part of Westmoreland, and the north of Lancashire lay 
like a map beneath, with the Cumberland mountains and Morecambe 
Bay in the back ground ; while, in the extreme distance, the Isle of 
Man stretched like a line in the Irish sea.
The lofty hills of the 
north-west of Yorkshire, with the beautiful vale of the Eden, termi- 
nated the view in another direction ; and the grandeur of the whole 
was much increased by the heavy clouds which hung about the tops 
1091 
of the adjacent mountains.
On the descent of the Fells near Sed- 
bergh, Anclmsa sempervirens was growing abundantly.
The follomng evening we visited the ruins of Firbank chapel, a 
place of much interest to our party ; and thence proceeded to Kirkby 
Lonsdale, where we arrived late.
The next morning we carefully ex- 
amined the rocks in the neighbourhood of the bridge for Salix tenui- 
folia, which we soon discovered ; we also noticed Sapouaria officinalis 
and Catabrosa aquatica.
Passing along the road towards Casterton, 
we gathered Geum intermedium ; and in a lane beyond, we found 
Quercus sessiliflora.
On the mossy rocks overhanging Whelprig 
brook, we gathered Hymenophyllum Wilsoni, sparingly.
We then 
crossed the moors in a southerly direction for some miles ; but little 
was noticed till we reached the Ingleton road at Leek, where we found 
Meconopsis Cambrica.
Shortly afterwards we had a fine view of In- 
gleborough, though its top was enveloped in mist.
Nothing worthy 
of particular notice was seen, till we arrived at the Bridge Inn, near 
Ingleton, with the exception of a solitary plant of Ceterach oflicina- 
rum.
After an hour's refreshment we again set out to explore Helks 
wood, which was formerly known as one of the localities for Cypripe- 
dium Calceolus ; it seems to have been exterminated here, as in most 
of its other localities.
Epipactis ensifolia has also been almost ex- 
terminated in this wood.
We think it well to remark here, that in 
almost every instance, our British Orchideae are damaged, if not de- 
stroyed, by gathering the stem when in flower, with the whole of the 
leaves on, even though the root be left perfectly uninjured.
Helks-wood extends for upwards of a mile along the steep and 
often precipitous sides of Thornton-beck.
Here we gathered Rosa 
Doniana, Convallaria majalis, Polypodium calcareum, and a Salix 
closely resembling S.
tenuifolia.
Near the end of the wood is a pretty 
waterfall called Thornton Force.
Returning through Ingleton, we no- 
ticed Senecio Saracenicus and Mentha citrata ; the former occupied 
a considerable space near the centre of the village.
The next day we started early for Weathercote-cave, between four 
and five miles distant.
Saxifraga aizoides adorned the edges of many 
of the rills by the road-side, with its bright golden flowers.
A rapid 
descent over masses of rock brings you to the bottom of this remark- 
able opening, which has rugged precipitous sides.
From a dark fis- 
sure near the top, a body of water pours down and instantly disappears 
among the tumbled stones at the bottom, producing a very curious 
and striking effect.
Near the entrance of this cave we noticed Stella- 
ria nemorum, Allium carinatum, Meconopsis Cambrica and Saxifraga 
4 Y 2 
1092 
Geum ; the last appears to have been originally jjlanted there, but 
is now completely naturalized.
After taking some refreshment at an 
inn in the vicinity, we commenced the ascent of Ingleborough, We 
crossed several extensive "limestone pavements," in the deep crevices 
of which we found Actsea spicata, Lastraea rigida, and some of the 
commoner ferns : on the grassy slope we noticed Aira cristata.
The 
ascent of the mountain was steep but not difficult, and we were soon 
able to enjoy the fine bracing air and the extensive prospect from the 
summit.
On the limestone rocks near the top we gathered Saxifraga 
oppositifolia, and below, on the millstone-grit, we saw Sedum Rhodiola 
in abundance, and after some search discovered Poa alpina in consi- 
derable quantity, though frequently growing in places scarcely acces- 
sible.
H. C.
Watson, in his ' Botanist's Guide,' remarks that he fears 
there is some error in the statement of this plant having been found on 
Ingleborough ; but it will no longer be a matter of doubt, and we were 
gratified in being able thus to confirm the correctness of this locality.
Here we also found a Poa, somewhat resembling the Teesdale Poa 
Parnellii, and which we at first took to be that species, but more mi- 
nute investigation leads us to believe that it is P.
nemoralis, var.
glauca.
Kapidly descending the easy slope of the mountain on the east side, 
we passed a deep circular chasm of curious character, called " Gaping 
Gill Hole" A mountain stream pours into this chasm, falling to an 
unknown depth.
A stone thrown in, after rebounding from side to 
side for a considerable space of time, sounds at last as though it was 
hurled into a spacious subterranean cavern.
The stream again emer- 
ges at a place about a mile distant, and probably several hundred feet 
below the level of the entrance.
On reaching the village of Clapham, 
we found a chaise waiting to convey us to Settle, where we soon ar- 
rived, and were kindly entertained for some days at the residence of 
our friend and fellow-traveller, John Tatham, jun.
The day following 
was very much one of rest, as regards bodily exercise : we however 
visited the beautifully wooded rock called Castlebar, at the foot of 
which the town is situated.
Here we saw abundance of Allium cari- 
natum.
Though the evening proved stormy and somewhat wet, we 
visited Attermire crags, about two miles distant.
The fog on the hills 
made it difficult to see our way, as well as to distinguish plants.
Hav- 
ing however a good guide, we soon came to the place where Lastraea 
rigida grows abundantly ; we also noticed Cardamine impatiens, Hie- 
racium rigidura and Lawsoni, and a single plant of Polystiehum Lon- 
chitis.
This fern is very scarce here, only a few plants having been 
yet discovered among the tumbled limestone rocks.
We were fully 
1093 
occupied till late in the evening with pressing and changing our spe- 
cimens (which now amounted to a considerable number), preparatory 
to starting, as we proposed, the next morning, for Malham-cove, Gor- 
dale and Arncliffe ; the account of which, with the remainder of our 
tour, we shall reserve for a concluding paper.
(To be continued).

â€” Descriptions of New Mosses and Lichens from 
the Australian Colonies.
Written for the Botanical Society of 
London, by Thomas Taylor, Esq., M.D.* 
The bundle of Musci and Lichenes, from a large miscellaneous col- 
lection of the late Allan Cunningham, and placed at my disposal by 
the liberality of Mr. Hewett Watson,t contained several duplicates 
and but few species, and of these a very limited number that were 
new.
I proceed to notice and describe the most interesting.
Hyp- 
num arcuatum of Hedwig, to be found in very few collections, occur- 
red growing on the bark of trees, at Norfolk Island.
From New 
Zealand was received Hypnum flexile of Hooker, which has not been 
sufficiently distinguished from Leskea flexilis of Hedwig.
From the 
same place was sent Leskea concinna.
Hooker, a variety, however, 
much smaller than that figured either in the ' Musci Exotici ' or in 
Schwaigrichen's Supplement ; the capsules, too, were not erect, but 
drooping from the bending of the upper part of the seta.
From Nor- 
folk Island came Leptostomum erectum of Brown, in the same spe- 
cimens varying singularly in the size of the capsules.
It was most 
pleasing to find gathered in New Zealand, Dicranum vaginatum of 
Hooker, described in the ' Musci Exotici ' as coming from the elevat- 
ed valleys of the Andes.
Our common Usnea plicata, Ach., occurred 
in New Zealand, and Sticta crocata, Ach., with fine apothecia, so rare 
in Europe, was collected in an expedition to the interior of New South 
Wales, under Major Mitchell.
I proceed to describe the new species.
Dicranum Menziesii, Tayl.
Caule csespitoso, erecto, subramoso : 
foliis undique imbricatis, erecto-patentibus, strictis, ex ovali basi 
longius tenuiterque setaceis, apice subserrulatis, uninerviis : capsula 
* Read before the Society September 6, 1844.
f " The collection (consisting chiefly of vascular plants) was purchased at public 
auction, after the death of Mr. Cunningham ; and it is very probable that some of the 
specimens had been mingled together, though from different localities." â€” H.
C. W.
1094 
lineari-oblonga, apophysata, ex basi erecta apice curvata ; operculo 
inclinato, longius rostrato.
Norfolk Island, Allan Cunningham.
I had received the same from 
Mr. Menzies from New Zealand, and named it after him, in 1814.
Tufts wide, pale yellowish-olive above, darker below.
Stems \^ 
inch high, crowded, parallel, erect, branching principally near the base 
and then very sparingly.
The leaves disposed to be heteromallous, 
but never circinate ; the fruit scarcely exceeds the stems in height ; 
in front of the capsule and at the base there is a projecting struma.
The peristome is dark brown, the teeth strongly barred, unequally di- 
vided, the larger segment of one tooth always adjacent to the larger 
segment of the adjoining, which is not unusual in the genus.
The 
calyptra is dimidiate, from a narrow base swelling considerably and 
then becoming subulate.
The figure of Dicranum fasciatum in Hedwig's Species, t.
28, is not 
unlike the present, differing, however, if we may judge from the de- 
scription and plate, by the creeping stems, the nerveless leaves, whose 
summits are wider and shorter, the pedicels for the most part gemi- 
nate and scarcely exserted, and the want of any struma to the capsule.
Bryum leptothecium, Tayl.
Caule laxe csespitoso, erecto, subra- 
moso : foliis obovatis oblique cuspidatis, marginatis, dentatis, in ro- 
sulam congestis : capsula curvata, lineari-oblonga ; operculo conico, 
acuminulato.
Norfolk Island, Allan Cunningham.
I had received this species 
from Mr. Menzies in 1814, collected in the same place.
Stems nearly I inch high, sending up from near the base of the pe- 
richgetium a pair of annotinous shoots.
The lower part of the stem is 
nearly naked, at the top and nearly at one point the leaves are clus- 
tered, and when moistened recurved and stellate ; they are concave, 
carinate, somewhat oblique, with a sufficiently obvious margination ; 
when dry each leaf is somewhat twisted in itself.
The top of the pe- 
dicel and capsule both tend to form one curve ; the capsule is usually 
remarkably slender.
The inner peristome is split down for only about 
one fourth of its length, and has two filiform processes between each 
pair of perforated laciniae.
In Bryum Billardierii, Schwceg., the leaves are immarginate and the 
capsule pendulous and oblong.
From the Swan River Bryum cam- 
pylothecium, Tayl.
MS., the present is distinct, by the want of long 
ex current nerves to the leaves, and the slender capsules, which gra- 
dually increase in width towards the top.
1095 
Bartramia tenuis, Tayl.
Caule caespitoso, erecto, subsimplici, gra- 
cili : foliis laxis, erecto-patentibus, ex lata ovata basi lanceolato-sub- 
ulatis, serrulatis, flexuosis, subsecundis : capsula rotuudato-oblonga, 
cui-vato-ceniua, striata, basi hinc gibba; operculo convexo, umbonato.
Norfolk Island, Allan Cunningham.
I had received this, collected 
in 1 826 by Richard Cunningham, in New Zealand.
Tufts wide, pale yellowish-green.
Stems scarcely 1 inch high, very 
slender, reddish-brown.
Leaves rather distant, with fine acuminated 
tops, variously bent.
The capsule under a lens shows a reddish- 
brown reticulation on the surface, with cells rather large.
Under each 
dark brown, lanceolate, transversely barred tooth of the outer peri- 
stome, lies a pale yellowish tooth of the inner peristome, which is 
bifid, but with segments unequal in size.
The present ranks near some of the smaller varieties of Bartramia 
foutana, Swartz, but then the leaves are longer, narrower, and with 
the denticulations less prominent.
Hypnum excavatum, Tayl.
Caule decumbente, surculis erectis, 
fastigiatim ramosis : foliis imbricatis, patentibus, concavissimis, rotun- 
datis, breviter apiculatis, integerrimis, basi binerviis : capsula ovata, 
inclinata ; operculo conico, rostellato.
Five Islands, coast of New South Wales, Allan Cunningham.
I 
had the same, collected in "Australia, 1823," by Fraser, through the 
kindness of Dr. R.
K. Greville.
Tufts loose, very ]>ale green.
Stems either decumbent, with short 
branches ; or the shoots erect, dendroid, with branches fascicled above.
Leaves very round, in the dry state pitted in, when moistened, all 
equally tumid ; they are set horizontally ; they are shining from their 
great convexity.
The capsules have a slight struma, are unequal in 
their sides, ovate, bent to one side.
The pedicels are smooth : the 
perichgetial leaves differing widely from the cauline in their lanceola- 
to-acuminate shape.
The present may be readily known from its allied congener, Hyp- 
num Arbuscula, Hooker, by the smaller size of all its parts, its more 
decumbent habit, and above all, by its more considerable although 
more slender pedicels.
Usnea scabrida, Tayl.
Thallo erecto, scaberrimo, pallide cinereo- 
flavescenti, fibrillis confertissimis, patenti-curvato-adscendentibus, 
subramosis : apotheciis demum planiusculis, ciliis confertis radianti- 
bus margine dorsoque tectis ; disco stramineo-albido, pulverulento.
1096 
Interior of New South Wales, Allan Cunningham.
I had received 
the same from Mr. James Drummond, from Swan River.
Thallus from 1 to 2 inches high, fastigiate, very rough ; apothecia 
larger than in any of the congeners.
The fibrils of the thallus and 
the cilise of the apothecia are quite analogous, and are buds, which 
may be observed expanding into new thallus.
The Vsneajiorida of Acharius is known from the present, by its 
greater size and by the backs of its apothecia being quite smooth.
Parmelia tuhularis, Tayl.
Thallo orbiculari, stellato, albido, lobis 
subpinnatifidis, linearibus, planiusculis, subtus inflatis, impresso-cor- 
rugatis, aterrimis, glabris : gemmis marginalibus, elongato-granulatis 
demum linearibus : apotheciis substipitatis, concavis, disco castaneo 
laevi, mavgine subintegerrimis.
Interior of New South Wales, Allan Cunningham.
I had the same 
from Van Diemen's Land, by favour of Dr. Balfour.
Thallus from 1 to 2 inches in diameter, white, with black edges ; 
the linear lobes are sometimes convex.
The apothecia sometimes in 
old age are half an inch in diameter, and then jagged at the edges and 
nearly plane at the disk.
This is one of a small tribe of the Parmeliae with inflated lobes.
It 
is easily known from the European P.
diatrype and P.
physodes both 
of Acharius, by the deeper division of the thallus into linear lobes to 
the very centre, while the lobes themselves are far more distinct.

â€” List of Plants observed in the dried-up bed of a 
Wear on Luddenden-hrook, in July, 1844.
By S.
King, Esq.
The following is a list of plants observed during the month of July, 
1844, growing upon what is in this neighbourhood called damstones 
(a wear), situate in Luddenden-brook.
It is a sort of novelty, many 
of the plants contained in it being strangers in the neighbourhood ; 
and will at least show the dryness of the season, and the scarcity of 
water, in permitting the seeds to vegetate in such a place, which con- 
tains little more than a hundred yards of surface.
It will also show, 
in some degree, the means whereby plants are frequently dispersed 
abroad to places foreign to them, as there is not the least doubt that 
many of them have escaped from the sweepings of the corn-mill which 
stands upon the stream a few hundred yards above, whither they had 
1097 
been conveyed among the grain.
Those marked thns * were not pre- 
viously knovi'n to grow in this district.
The list comprehends the 
species that grew on the fence-wall adjoining, though none but what 
a person standing in the water- course might reach.
I have no doubt 
that the number of species would have greatly increased, had not a 
change taken place in the weather and brought on a flood, which quite 
obliterated my prolific bit of botanizing ground.

â€” Notes on some Queries about the ' London Catalogue 
of British Plants."" Communicated by G.
E. Dennes, Esq., 
Hon. Sec.
Bot. Soc.
London.
In ' The Phytologist' for the current month (Phytol.
1077), a letter 
appears from the pen of Mr. Grindon, in which many queries are pro- 
posed to me, touching the reasons why certain names are used in the 
London Catalogue, for species which are designated by other names 
in the Edinburgh Catalogue, â€” why certain plants are entered as spe- 
cies and others as varieties, â€” why some are marked indigenous and 
others introduced ?
In reply to the letter, I can only say that it is 
manifestly impossible to answer such questions in detail, without 
writing enough to fill whole Nos. of ' The Phytologist.' The many 
pages written about the names and distinctions of GEnanthe pimpi- 
nelloides, Carex paradoxa.
Primula elatior, Hieracium sylvaticum, 
and their respectively allied species or varieties, afford satisfactory 
proofs that reasons for names and distinctions are rather too lengthy 
affairs to be entered upon by scores at once.
It has already been stated (Phytol.
1015) that, almost without ex- 
ception, the names employed in the London Catalogue are adopted 
from writers of authority ; and, in most instances, they are names 
which have been very generally in use among botanical writers.
Those 
who require reasons for such names, ought to seek them in the pub- 
lished works of the authors from whom they are taken.
Those who 
object to the names so sanctioned, ought to show reasons against 
them, instead of idly calling for reasons why other parties have not 
rejected them.
Both Mr. Sidebotham and Mr. Grindon seem to have written under 
a strange fancy, that the compilers of the London Catalogue were in 
some way bound to have adopted exactly the same names as were 
employed by the compilers of the Edinburgh Catalogue.
But if the 
names of this latter Catalogue had been implicitly adopted, other ob- 
jectors would just as reasonably have asked, why a mere list of names 
1099 
was followed, in preference to the best descriptive works on British 
Botany, such as those of Smith, Hooker, or Babington ?
Not only- 
do the Floras of Smith and Hooker (the highest authorities who have 
written Floras of Britain) differ from the Edinburgh Catalogue in ma- 
ny names, â€” but even, in several instances, the names of the Edin- 
burgh Catalogue are again changed and made different in Mr. Babing- 
ton's ' Manual of British Botany.' When we thus find the same au- 
thor using one set of names in 1841 (Edinb.
Cat), and other names in 
1843 (Manual), there can be no great ground for surprize or censure 
in the circumstance of two different Societies being still less uniform 
in their nomenclature.
Mutatis mutandis, similar observations may be extended to the 
distinctions between species and vai'ieties, between native and natu- 
ralized plants.
In very many instances they can be only the opinions 
of individuals, drawn from imperfect evidence.
It is mere mis-use of 
terms to represent Mr. Sidebotham as endeavouring to " elicit the 
principle or plan " which was followed in distinguishing native and 
naturalized plants.
There could be no " principle " â€” that is, general 
rule : each case must be decided by itself, on the best attainable evi- 
dence.
One species (say, for example, Impatiens fulva) is excluded 
because known to have been introduced from a distant country ; ano- 
ther (Corydalis lutea) because its localities are all near houses, or in 
spots to which the plant is likely to have been carried by the hand of 
man ; another (Linura usitatissimum) as being a species long in ordi- 
nary cultivation, and not permanent in its localities.
Thus, there is 
no common test applicable â€” no general rule â€” no " principle " to be 
followed.
Indeed, it was one of Mr. Sidebotham's own errors to as- 
sume (not ask for) a principle, when he stated the number of local 
Floras as the test between native and naturalized species.
It is to be regretted that writers who seek controversy, are so prone 
to assume and assert things without the warranty of fact in support.
It was wrong in Mr. Sidebotham to make the incorrect statement just 
adverted to.
It is equally wrong in Mr. Grindon to connect the words 
" extensive changes in nomenclature " with the name of Mr. Sidebo- 
tham.
Those words occurred in the editorial note (Phytol.
974), but 
not in Mr. Sidebotham's letter ; and they were repeated by myself 
only in a paragraph which expressly related to the " editorial wishes 
for uniformity of nomenclature," (Phytol.
1015).
By connecting these 
words with Mr. Sidebotham's name, Mr. Grindon is enabled to give a 
point blank contradiction to a charge never made !
Thus far I have replied to such portions of Mr. Grindon's letter as 
1100 
can be supposed to possess any general bearing or interest.
I do this 
in my capacity of Secretary to the Botanical Society ; though I can- 
not go so far as to allow that any office-bearer of the Society should 
feel called on to answer queries like this : â€” "if Carex irrigua is a va- 
riety, why not also rariflora ?
" 
I have now only to add further, that any competent botanist, en- 
gaged in writing on the plants of Britain, will find no difficulty in 
obtaining such information as can be affijrded, about any species or 
variety included in the London Catalogue, â€” provided his inquiries be 
addressed to me through the post-office.
There seems no good rea- 
son for such questions being addressed to the readers of ' The Phyto- 
logist ' generally : it looks too like mere display or notoriety-seeking.

â€” Notice of PresPs ' Hymenophyllacecs.^ 
(Continued from p.
1059).
The characters given to the Hymenophylloideae are these.
" Sorus in dentibus aut laciniis frondis apicalis immersus vel his consumtis subla- 
teralis exsertus.
Indusium e duabus laminis frondis divisis et alteratis constructum ; 
hae in varia altitudiue marginibus connatee indusium ad medium usque ad basim bi- 
fidum efformant.
Eeceptaculum indusio longius vel aequilongum vel brevius, aut fili- 
forme in parte superiore capsuliferum inferne nudum, aut apice globoso-incrassatum 
ibidem capsuliferum inferneque nudum, aut cylindricura aut obovalo- vel lineari- cla- 
vatum undique capsuliferum.'' â€” p.
26.
It has already been pointed out (Phytol.
1047), that the main dis- 
tinction between the Trichomanoideae and Hymenophylloideae, is 
founded on the structure of the involucre ; this part, in the latter tribe, 
being for the most part composed of two distinct valves, which are se- 
parated nearly to the base.
A perusal of the characters above cited 
will show that the receptacle affi)rds litte or no assistance, since it is 
occasionally longer and occasionally shorter than the involucre, and 
that its form is as variable as its length.
Indeed the author seems ra- 
ther to have adopted this dichotomous division in compliment to his 
numerous predecessors, who, following Sir J.
E. Smith, have treated 
the groups as genera, than to be impressed with any idea of its value 
or importance.
Passages clearly evincing his views on this subject, 
are of frequent occurrence ; for instance, in describing Leptocionium, 
he observes, " It is a genus intermediate between the Trichonianoidese 
and HymcnophylloideaD, possessing the receptacle of the former and 
1101 
the involucre of the latter." We can scarcely avoid feeling regret 
that an author entertaining such views should hesitate to carry them 
out, and should bow to mere authority.
We consider it impossible 
for any one, whatever his skill, to define for the satisfaction of others 
the genera or tribes known as Trichomanes and Hymenophyllum ; 
and we hold it needful either to adhere, with Linnaeus, to the genus 
Trichomanes, or to adopt the generic subdivisions to their fullest ex- 
tent.
For if we divide the Hymenophyllaceae into sections of any 
kind, more than two such sections will be required; the Didymoglos- 
seae, for instance, wull occupy a rank at least equal to the Hymeno- 
phylloideae.
A modern writer on Ferns has an apposite passage on 
this subject ; and it seems not a little remarkable, that a work, so ex- 
actly supplying the desideratum there pointed out, should be so soon 
afterwards in the hands of botanists.*

Transactions, and the name has been adopted by nearly all subsequent botanists, a 
strong proof of the weight of Smith's authority, for even now, when generic subdivi- 
sion has extended to so great a length, we have no new genera founded on such ima- 
ginary differences as those which separate Hymenophyllum from Trichomanes.
In 
my endeavours to draw a line between these genera, I have been totally unsuccessful : 
if we regard the exserted receptacle of the one, or the bivalved involucre of the other, 
the only conclusion at which we can arrive is this â€” that those species with the longest 
receptacles at present stand in Trichomanes, those with the most distinctly bivalved 
involucres in Hymenophyllum.
These, however, are mere questions of degree, and are 
quite insufficient to guide the botanist who â€” without a prior knowledge of a plant â€” 
seeks, by means of books, to ascertain its generic and specific names.
It must not, 
however, be understood that I object to the subdivision of the Linnean genus Tricho- 
manes ; so far from this, I trust the time is not far distant when some competent bota- 
nist shall rearrange the entire group, pointing out characters that admit of no dispute, 
and leading us on to a far more accurate knowledge of these beautiful plants, than we 
can hope to glean from any works yet before the public." â€” Newman's British Ferns, 
p. 323.

Art. CCXLIl. â€” Additional Notes on Suffolk Botany.
By W.
L. NoTCUTT, Esq.
Having on a former occasion communicated some particulars of an 
excursion I made in Suffolk last year (Pliytol.
823), and having, this 
summer, revisited that part of the country, perhaps a few additional 
observations may not be altogether unacceptable.
My visit, however, 
was paid at a period which, though one of the most pleasant in all the 
year, is not the most fertile for the botanist ; namely, the latter part of 
May. I again observed most of the plants noticed in my last com- 
munication, though many of them were not in flower.
In addition to 
these, I saw in the meadows bordering the I'iver Gipping, a great 
abundance of Orchis latifolia and Saxifraga granulata, the former be- 
ing especially luxuriant ; while in the river itself was Potamogeton 
lucens, and at its sides and in the adjoining ditches, plenty of Cicuta 
virosa.
In a pond in the meadows between the Gipping and the 
Bramford road, was a large patch of Acorus Calamus, just coming into 
flower.
Qinanthe fistulosa grows in the neighbouring ditches, and 
Menyanthes trifoliata in the boggy parts of the meadow.
Turritis glabra I found in two other localities besides the one men- 
tioned in my former paper.
On the Belstead road I found it, though 
sparingly, from Stoke-hills to the place where the Belsted-brook 
crosses the road : at this latter spot Galium cruciatum abounds, and 
Malva moschata grows in small quantity.
In the fields beyond, Se- 
dura Telephium adorns the hedge-bank, and in a hedge a little fur- 
ther on, I found a tree of Quercus Cerris, most likely planted.
I 
met with Turritis glabra again in a cornfield on the way to Downham- 
reach woods : it was just at the top of the hill above Greenwich-farm, 
at the bottom of which, on the river side, is Hog-island, a locality for 
Statice rariflora.
This is a remarkably pleasant walk, and by no means 
devoid of botanical interest In the neighbouring cornfields we meet 
with Papaver Argemone, and at the end of them emerge into Gainsbo- 
rough's lane, so named after the celebrated Suflblk painter, Gainsbo- 
rough.
Some of the views in this lane afford the most beautiful com- 
bination of river and wood scenery imaginable.
At its termination 
are Downham-reach woods, which deserve, and I doubt not would 
richly repay, a close and careful investigation.
Here was Orchis mas- 
cula in profusion, and just in its prime, and such magnificent speci- 
mens I certainly never beheld before.
By the side of one of the 
ditches on the edge of the wood, I found, after a little search, plenty 
1108 
of Chrysosplenium oppositifolium ; and by another near it, Cardamine 
amara.
At the back of Brook's hall, near Ipswich, is a hilly broom-field : 
here I found Orobanche major, which has maintained this station for 
a great number of years ; it was, however, in very small quantity this 
year.
I have not seen it elsewhere near Ipswich, though the broom, 
on which it commonly fixes its roots, is very abundant on Stoke-hill, 
near Greenwich-farm, Cauldwell-hall, &c.
In the meadow behind 
Brook's hall grows Epilobium palustre, and in the pond in its front I 
used to find a Ceratophyllum, I suppose demersum, but this year it 
was not to be seen.
Near this spot is a lane which leads by the Suf- 
folk hospital and back of the barracks to the top of Globe-lane and in 
which I found Geranium pyrenaicum and Smyrnium Olusatrum in 
great abundance.
Gagea lutea, a very rare plant in this part of Eng- 
land, I believe, may be found in Waller's grove, a copse on the left 
hand side of the London road, about a mile from Ipswich, on that side 
of the copse which faces Stoke-hills.
Botany being only a secondary object with me in this trip, I was 
unable to devote so much time to it as I could have wished, and could 
only spare one day to a search for plants at Felixtow and its neigh- 
bourhood.
I found nothing more than I have recorded in my last 
account, excepting a Poa, which was growing in moderate plenty on 
the sands which form the point of Harwich-harbour by Landguard- 
fort ; it appears to me to be P.
bulbosa, though it diifers in one or two 
points.
During my stay at Ipswich, I had the opportunity of looking over 
the herbarium of a friend and relative, Mr. John Notcutt, now de- 
ceased.
He had resided for a long time in Ipswich ; and being an 
ardent lover of Botany, had formed an intimate acquaintance with the 
plants of the neighbourhood, of which his collection consisted, for 
there appeared to be scarcely a specimen from any other place.
Thinking a notice of some of the localities might be interesting, I 
transcribe those of a few specimens which were given me by the gen- 
tleman in whose hands the collection now is.
With the exception of 
the two last, they are all in the immediate vicinity of Ipswich.
Pulmonaria angustifolia.
Between Whitton and Bramford.
I 
carefully examined this station without being able to detect the plant; 
but as the distance between the two villages is a mile or a mile and a

Note on a Surrey locality for Ceterach ofjicinarum.
I believe 
that at present there is no habitat recorded for Ceterach officinarum 
in the county of Surrey ; I may therefore perhaps be allowed to point 
out to your readers "a local habitation" for this fern within the county.
On looking over a collection of ferns, made by a young lady in this 
neighbourhood, I was much gratified by seeing a frond of Ceterach, 
which was stated to have been taken from a wall at Haslemere.
Feel- 
ing a desire to verify the habitat, I mentioned the circumstance to my 
friend Mr. Salmon; and a few days afterwards (April 18, 1844), we 
together visited the spot â€” an old wall on the south side of Cow-street 
â€” where we found from thirty to forty plants.
Of these we contented 
ourselves with a very few specimens.
Mr. Salmon sent a notice of 
this habitat to Mr. Newman, hoping it might appear in the second 
edition of the British Ferns ; his note, however, arrived too late, the 
last pai't of the British Ferns being published a very few days subse- 
quently.

Notes on the change of Colour in the Flowers of the Hydran- 
gea.
Having paid particular attention to the common Hydrangea {H.
hortensis) for several years, and during that time having made a varie- 
ty of experiments with a view of ascertaining the probable cause of 
the frequent variation of colour so prevalent in that species, I offer 
the following remarks as the result of my observations.
They will, I 
think, show the fallacy of the statements which have been recorded in 
various periodicals &c., of changing the large pink heads of blossoms 
into the fine blue colour, either by growing the plant in a particular 
soil (some persons say peat or bog soil), or by the addition of chemi- 
cal agents to the soil : as well as that the blue colour is by no means 
permanent.
When my attention was first drawn to the subject some 
1111 
years ago, where I was then living, several very large Hydrangeas 
were growing in the open borders of a flower-garden, the soil being 
of various kinds.
One plant, growing in a border of stiff tenacious 
clay, produced beautiful heads of a bright pink colour, while another 
by its side had every head of blossoms of a fine blue ; and in the same 
border was a plant bearing blossoms of pink and blue intermixed, and 
of as fine a shade of colour as on the separate plants.
The other bor- 
der was a deep surface-soil of peat or bog-earth.
The plants were of 
the same character in this as in the before-named border, and produ- 
ced the same results, the blossoms being wholly pink, wholly blue, 
and mixed as before.
I have plants here which are growing in clay ; 
and last summer (1843) they bloomed pink and blue heads distinctly 
on the same plant.
In the autumn of 1842 I took cuttings from plants, 
the pink and blue separately; in the following spring, when they flow- 
ered, every head of blossom was pink ; the soil varied from peat to a 
stiff loam.
In the autumn of 184.3 I repeated my experiment, taking 
my cuttings again distinct, and potting some of them in pure loam, 
others in peat soil, others in equal parts of loam and leaf soil, others 
again in equal parts of loam and peat.
No difference was percepti- 
ble this summer in the blossoms of those cuttings taken from plants 
with pink or blue flowers, with one exception, which was that one 
of the cuttings from the blue, produced pale blue flowers ; the soil it 
was grown in was pure loam.
A slight tinge of blue appeared in a 
few of the flowers on other plants, on cuttings taken from the pink 
kind as well as the other.
Such has been the result of careful expe- 
riments, and I feel satisfied, as a practical cultivator, that the differ- 
ence of colour in these plants is of a thoroughly sportive character, 
and will always be attended with uncertain results.
For I would ask, 
if the soil causes the change of colour, why should it appear on the 
same plant, as well as on a plant when growing in soil of a decidedly 
opposite nature ?
I should be happy to hear of experiments on these 
plants made by some other conespondents.

Note on Anagallis c<Brulea.
I beg likewise to mention hav- 
ing succeeded in raising Anagallis caerulea a second time from seeds 
of A.
arvensis.
The first time was in 1838, when, wishing to test the 
two plants as to their being distinct species, I had sown seeds of A.
arvensis in a border, from which was produced one plant of caerulea.
And again, in the present season, having sown some seed, I have ob- 
tained the same result ; and I now think with Mr. Grindon (Phytol.
130), that A.
caerulea is nothing more than a variety of A.
arvensis.

Note on the Bulbs of Achimenes pedunculata.
In the autumn 
of 1843, I observed a singular phenomenon displayed by the small 
bulbs attached to the stem of Achimenes pedunculata; they are form- 
ed principally in the axils of the leaves.
I had gathered a number of 
the bulbs into a small pan, and having occasion to move them after- 
wards, I was surprized at the apparently spontaneous irritability exhi- 
bited by the bulbs, which continued for some seconds expanding and 
collapsing with great rapidity.
I enclose a small quantity of the bulbs 
for your inspection, and should be happy to supply any of your cor- 
respondents on application.
â€” Id.
[On opening the box containing tLe bulbs (which resemble mulberries in minia- 
ture) when first received from Mr. Henness, we were very much surprized at the lively 
movement pervading the whole mass into which the bulbs had been compressed in 
their journey by post.
They resembled a host of small beetles suddenly released from 
confinement in a small space, and bent on making the most of their newly acquired li- 
berty.â€” J/c?,]

Note on Equisetum Telmateia.
Having seen a discussion in 
some former numbers (Phytol.
588, 618, 621, 648 and 649), respect- 
ing Equisetum Telmateia, as to the degree of moisture of the spot 
it usually grows in, I thought it might interest some to state that I 
have observed it growing commonly in corn-fields in the neighbour- 
hood of Stock and Galleywood common near here.
I was surprized 
to find the plant in a locality so generally occupied by E .
arvense ; 
probably the fields required landitching, though I could not perceive 
that they were particularly wet ; they certainly were not low in situa- 
tion.
I have never seen this Equisetum growing in the water, but 
two other stations for it near here are much wetter than the preceding.

â€” On the British Species of Sphagnum.
By W.
Wilson, Esq, 
The investigation of this difficult genus is more properly a task for 
one who has uninterrupted leisure : but since the subject has recently 
come under my special notice, I am induced to present the result of 
my enquiries to your readers, reserving the details for the ^Manual of 
British Bryology,' wliich it is ray intention ere long to publish.
Mr. Valentine has long ago pointed out, in the ' Muscologia Not- 
tinghamiensis,' a good diagnostic for S.
cymbifolium.
Dill.
(S.
obtusi- 
folium, Hook.
Sf Tayl.), residing in the cellules which constitute the 
cortical layer of the ramulus.
If these are carefully examined with 
a good lens, they will be found to have a very curious lining of spiral 
fibres coating the whole interior surface, except where the circular 
pores are found.
This lining, and the circular pores, are analogous 
to those of the cellules which compose the leaves.
S. compactum (Biidel), found in Oxton-bog by Mr. Valentine, has 
the cellules of the ramulus quite destitute of spiral lining.
The leaves 
are different in shape from those of S.
cymbifolium, ovaie-ohlong, the 
upper portion almost subulate, and the apex always prcem or so-den- 
tate.
The leaves of S.
cymbifolium vary in shape from roundish to 
elliptical, generally boat-shaped, sometimes recurved in the upper 
half, when they greatly resemble those of S.
squarrosum, but may al- 
way be known by their very concave and entire apices, and by the 
prominent cells at the back of the leaf, just below the apex.
S. com- 
pactum and S.
cymbifolium are the only species known to me which 
have the margin of the leaf minutely denticulate (especially towards 
the apex) : all the other species have the margin entire and cartilagi- 
nous, most evidently so in S.
cuspidatum, Ehrh.
S. squarrosum (Pers.), has the leaves recurved and very acute at 
the apex : it can only be confounded with the squarrose variety of S.
cymbifolium.
S. contortum (Schultz) is a difficult species, as I judge from the 
circumstance of its having been described in the * Bryologia Gerraa- 
nica,' " foliis ovato-acuminatis falcato-stihsecundis nitidis, ramulis 
recurvato-contortis." The name itself seems to be unhappy ; since it 
5 A 
1114 
is applicable only to one, and that not a general form of the species.
Indeed it is only by means of specimens apparently authentic in Mou- 
geot and Nestler's ' Stirpes Crypt.
Voges.
Rhen.
No. 807,' that I am 
enabled to identify this moss.
If I am right in my conclusions, the 
more general state of this species is one which does not present any 
appearance of contorted and recurved ramuli, nor any unilateral or 
falcate direction of the leaves.
It often assumes a large size, with 
very large leaves, when growing in water, and in this state has been 
called S.
laxifolium by Mr. Valentine (though he ultimately regarded 
it as only a variety of S.
acutifolium), and has not long ago been re- 
ported as a new species gathered in Devonshire by the Rev. C.
A. 
Johns.
S. contortum is readily known from S.
cymbifolium and S.
compactum, by the ovate-acute leaves, which are nevertheless prae- 
morse at the apex.
An excellent additional character is found in the 
cellules of the main stem being disposed in only one layer, in which 
respect it differs from all known species, except S.
subsecundum.
Found in Cheshire and Nottinghamshire.
S. subsecundum (Nees ab Esenb.), has not yet been found in Bri- 
tain, but I think it right to mention it here, and the more so, because 
in the collection of Mougeot and Nestler, it has been confounded with 
S. contortum.
The leaves of S.
subsecundum are somewhat unilate- 
ral, ovate, acute, not prcemorse at the apex, very concave, but other- 
wise not readily distinguishable from S.
contortum, with which they 
agree in their very small cellules.
It may be that S.
subsecundum is 
only a variety of S.
contortum, and if I mistake not, S acutifolium is 
equally variable in reference to the apex of the leaf, or otherwise two 
species are confounded under that name.
S. molluscum (Bridel), is a beautiful little soft species, found about 
Warrington and in Wales, many years ago, by myself; more recently 
by Mr. Spruce in Yorkshire, and by Mr. Sidebotham in Oxton-bog.
This has small, ovate, concave, acute leaves, scarcely prsemorse at 
the apex, and the cellules large, if compared with S.
subsecundum 
and S.
contortum.
It is beautifully characterised by the peculiar 
shape of the cellules of the ramuli ; each of these cells (unlike the cy- 
lindrical ones of the other species) is curved at top so as to stand out 
from the ramulus, and the circular orifice at the extremity is thus ren- 
dered very conspicuous: 
aS".
acutifolium (Ehrh.), is known by the ovate-lanceolate acute 
leaves, which, when dry, have the margins unchanged.
The leaves in 
one variety are very regularly packed in five rows.
It is very common.
1115 
S. cuspidatum (Ehrh.) has the cartilaginous margins of the leaves 
reflexed and wavy when dry ; the shape of the leaf is narrower than 
in S.
acutifolium ; often very long and tapering in the aquatic state 
named S.
plumosum.
A less common species than the last.
Besides these characters, by which the species may be known, 
there are others consisting in the different form of the perichaetial 
leaves, whereby S.
squarrosum, cymbifolium and acutifolium are very 
obviously separated from each other : the others I have but partially 
examined.
Differential characters are found also in the texture of 
the walls of the capsule.
It is hoped that these hints may seiTC as a satisfactory reply to Mr.
Sidebotham's request for information upon the subject, (Phytol.
871).
I shall feel obliged by the communication of specimens of any Sphag- 
num which cannot be recognized as belonging to the species here 
enumerated as British.
It is highly probable that additional species 
will be discovered, especially S.
tenellum, Pers., now that the subject 
is rendered accessible to the readers of ' The Phytologist.'

The present Monograph places in a striking point of view the obli- 
gations conferred on Botany by the enthusiastic and almost unparal- 
leled labours of our countryman, Mr. Cuming.
Our readers cannot 
but observe how large a proportion of the new species are derived 
from this source, and it is truly gratifying to find that British industry 
1119 
has accomplished so much, and that our countryman's labours are so 
highly valued and so honorably mentioned by the author, who of all 
living men is the most capable of appreciating them.
The work is beautifully illustrated with copper-plate engravings, a 
glance at which will be sufficient to convince a botanist of the value 
of the genera which the author has proposed, and at the same time 
will show the great importance of the fruit in distinguishing these in- 
teresting plants.

â€” Correspondence relative to Carex parudoxa, 8fc.
As the following communications relate to subjects which have 
lately been discussed in our pages, we have thought it better to in- 
clude them all under one general head.
Hebden-bridge, September 9, 1844.
Sir, 
I now beg of you to favour me with the insertion in 
' The Phytologist,' of the following remarks on Mr. Luxford's note 
(Phytol.
1081).
Mr. Luxford says that he deems it his duty to take 
up the cudgels, in behalf of two of his correspondents, and in one in- 
stance to expose something which appears to him like a mistake 
which I have made.
I shall not say here that 1 do not vert/ often make mistakes, but I 
shall say that I have made no mistake about the discovery of Carex 
paradoxa in Ascham bogs.
If Mr. Luxford will just refer to Mr.
Spruce's note (Phytol.
842), he will find that that gentleman, in April, 
1841, only discovered this plant as it had been discovered before, 
that is, as Carex teretiuscula.
Mr. Spruce tells us that he at that 
time referred it, "though doubtfully, to C.
teretiuscula." This may 
be correct ; â€” Mr. Spruce might have some doubts as to the specific 
identity of the plant; â€” but when he sent it to his friends in 1841, he 
sent it under the name of C.
teretiuscula, without expressing such a 
doubt.
In June, 1828, I gathered this plant (Carex paradoxa) in As- 
cham bogs ; but at that time having no description of C.
paradoxa, I 
was, the same as Mr. Baines and Mr. Spruce, under the necessity of 
referring it to C.
teretiuscula.
And as Mr. Spruce concludes his note 
by telling us that C.
teretiuscula does not grow nearer to York than 
Terrington Car, which is fifteen miles distant, and Ascham bogs being 
only three miles distant from York, it leaves no doubt of the plant 
1120 
whicli I gathered iu Aschara bogs in the year 1828, and the one pub- 
lished in Baines's Flora under the name of Carex teretiuscula iu 1840, 
being identical with the one that Mr. Spruce discovered in the year 
1841.
T^nimt honor Mr, Spruce or any other person can possibly have 
iu being the discoverer of a new plant, I am totally at a loss to com- 
prehend, knowing as I do that such an occurrence is merely a matter 
of chance.
And as far as regards Mr. Sidebotham's misiakes, I will just tell 
Mr. Luxford (as it appears he has forgotten), that the subject of these 
Carices was no^ private one, and that when Mr. Sidebotham was asked 
for the plant, it was not for the pui-pose of perfecting a series, but 
purely wifli the intention of coming at the truth of a puhlic dispute.
And as Mr. Sidebotham knew this, he would have done much better 
if he had acknowledged his inability ) comply witli Mr. Babington's 
wish, than to have sent him something that would tend to lead him 
into error.
Such a request as Mr. Babington's ought not to have been 
attended to iu a careless manner ; but on the contrary, a little more 
than ordinaiy care should have been bestowed.
Mr. Luxford may 
think that the mistake should have been set right by a piivate letter; 
but I will now tell him that this was no private affair.
When I re- 
ceived the letter in question, as I had been previously called on to 
show whj' Mr. Sidebotham's specimens did not agree with the de- 
scription which I had given of my Carex pseudo-paradoxa.
And fur- 
ther, Mr. Luxford must recollect that Mr. Sidebotham's mistake was 
between Mr. Babington and himself, and although I was deeply inte- 
rested, I had no part in it.
Yom's respectfully, 
Saml.
Gibson.
To the Editor of ' The Pliytologist.' 
York, 3rd of 9th Month, 1844.
I have a specimen of Carex paradoxa in my herbarium, which was 
gathered at Ascham bog, by my father, in 1818.
The C.
teretiuscula 
of Baines's ' Flora of Yorkshire ' refers to this specimen ; thinking it 
most resembled C.
teretiuscula, my father named it accordingly.
The 
specimen has since been shown to R.
Spruce, who pronounces it to 
be C.
paradoxa.
I believe C.
teretiuscula is not found at all in As- 
cham bogs.

Welburn, Yorkshire, Sept 17, 1844.
Note on Carex paradoxa.
â€” As a companion to Mr. Luxford's note 
(Phjtol.
1021), allow me to call the attention of your readers to a re- 
mark by Mr. Teesdale, in his ' Supplement to the Plantse Eboracen- 
ces,' read before the Linnean Society, Dec. 4.
1798, and published in 
the 5th vol.
of their Transactions.
Under Carex paniculata is the 
following : â€” " Ohs. We have in the marshes a variety of this, witli a 
small compact panicle, which never forms itself into large tufts, as tlie 
C. paniculata does.
It probably may be a distinct species." I should 
conclude at once that the plant here alluded to was C.
paradoxa, 
were it not that the tufts formed by that species are precisely like 
those of C.
paniculata, so far asc/ have ever observed.
The former, 
it is true, is the smaller plant, and the stools are consequently small- 
er, though equally dense ; and if Mr. Teesdale's words can be under- 
stood to imply that his Carex does form tufts, though scarcely so large 
as those of C.
paniculata, I think no doubt will remain of his alluding 
to C.
paradoxa.
It is not improbable that C.
paradoxa may have 
been gathered many times in Yorkshire for C.
teretiuscula, and I have 
lately seen it under this name in the collection of Mr. Backhouse, 
who gathered it in Ascham-bogs some twenty years ago.
As to Mr.
Gibson's complimentary mention of me (Phytol.
1042), I look upon it 
as a sort of "note of thanks" for some fine specimens of Carex para- 
doxa he had from me, and which I have reason to believe were the 
first he had ever seen of the species, as I have not since heard from 
him in any shape.
I did not think it worth while to notice Mr. G.'s 
misrepresentation, for to him "it is a matter of little importance" to 
he correct ; and I suppose I need not remind him that something 
more is necessary to entitle a person to the name of a " discoverer," 
than merely being the first to gather a plant ; he ought also to be able 
to distinguish it from every other species known to exist in the same 
country, and (if practicable) to make it known under its true name : 
otherwise might the " natives " of Teesdale be considered the disco- 
verers of Gentiana vema, because they have been, from time imme- 
morial, accustomed to decorate their hats and bonnets with its beau- 
tiful blossoms.

1122 
Lane House, Luddenden, 
Near Halifax, Sept.
13, 1844.
Sir, 
While I have my pen in my fingers, just allow me 
to contradict a misstatement in Mr. Gibson's paper (Phytol.
1039), 
where he says that I " asked Mr. Sidebotham for my Carex pseudo- 
paradoxa, and he sent him specimens under that name." This is not 
correct ; nor did I ever tell Mr. G.
so.
Once, when I was in com- 
pany with Mr. Sidebotham, he gave me a single specimen (the only 
one I ever possessed) of that plant, which he chanced to have by him.
Soon after which, I had the opportunity of seeing Mr. G.'s specimens, 
when I said to him that they looked different from the one which Mr.
S. had given me, little thinking that he would betray me in the way 
he has done, as I did not consider myself a competent judge, and any 
one knows the difficulty of judging from a single specimen, especially 
when that specimen is in an imperfect state.
I have asked Mr. G.
for a specimen of the plant, but he never would give me one.
As Mr. Gibson upbraids Mr. Sidebotham with making mistakes, I 
would caution him to beware of making them ; for I have a specimen 
of Carex paniculata in my herbarium, which he gave me under the 
name of C.
teretiuscula, labelled with his own hand.
This was 
either a mistake, or something worse.
At that time both the above 
species were strangers to me.
Samuel King.
[Although the above communications scarcely require a comment, yet we cannot 
refrain from saying in reference to the first part of Mr. Gibson's note, that we hardly 
comprehend how a botanist, in consulting Baines's Flora, could possibly know that 
Carex paradoxa was intended by the Carex teretiuscula recorded in that work, seeing 
that the name of the plant is unaccompanied by any note, or mark of doubt, expres- 
sive of its imperfect accordance with the descriptions.
We may also embrace this op- 
portunity of stating, that having hitherto printed Mr. Gibson's contributions in so full 
a manner as they certainly would not have commanded, had not a cry of unfair deal- 
ing been raised by some of that gentleman's admirers ; and having thus manifested 
our desire to afford Mr. G.
ample opportunity of defending himself from attacks which, 
we are sorry to say, he has, in most cases, provoked ; â€” we must now consult the 
wishes of the majority of the readers of 'The Phytologist,' by reducing within reason- 
able limits, any future contributions with which we may be favoured by Mr. Gib- 
son.

â€” Additional Plants found about Saffron Walden, 
during the Summer of 1844 ; with Remarks on some of the 
Species.
By G.
S. Gibson, Esq.
Papaver somniferum.
Ditch-banks, &c., rare ; an outcast from 
gardens.
Hypericum maculatum.
Woods and moist hedge-banks in several 
places.
It appears clearly distinct from either H.
perforatum or H.
quadrangulum, for which it is probably often overlooked ; but I can- 
not think it more than a slight variety of H, dubium, having the broad, 
obtuse, reflexed sepals mucronated instead of entire, and the petals 
slightly streaked with purple.
Probably it is not an uncommon plant 
in most parts of England.
Ruhus Koehleri.
Hedges on the Ashdon-road.
R. villicaulis.
How-wood, Littlebury.
This genus is so intricate, and such a remarkable diversity of opin- 
ion exists as to the distinction of the species, and also as to which 
species many of the variable forms are to be referred ; that I feel some 
hesitation in giving names to them : yet those who have paid atten- 
tion to the subject, must feel satisfied that there are a considerable 
number of really separate species, and I cannot doubt that these two 
are among the number.
They agree with authentic specimens so 
named by E.
Lees, the great authority for this genus, which I have 
received from the Botanical Society of London.
I wish the attention 
of botanists were more drawn to this tribe of plants, which requires 
much further examination, but is too often passed by, either as unde- 
serving of notice, or so intricate as to render the investigation of it a 
hopeless task.
But surely it deserves equal attention with other ge- 
nera ; and the only way to clear up the difficulties connected with it, 
can be by patient observation in various localities.
Rosa systyla.
Hedges, rare.
R. inodora and micrantha f Not common.
Introduced here on 
the authority of Joshua Clarke.
Galium Vaillantii.
This plant, which I believe has not been hi- 
therto noticed in Britain, was discovered by myself last month, in a 
field adjoining this town ; it grew in tolerable abundance, and was 
intermixed with G.
Aparine.
The crop on one part of the field was 
barley, on the other, clover, grown from English seed.
It was found 
among both, and therefore could not have been recently introduced 
with the seed ; independently of which, it is the opinion of the grow- 
1124 
ers of clover, that the process through which it passes would not per- 
mit seed of this size to remain among it uninjured ; moreover, in a 
field sown with the same seed, I was unable to find any trace of this 
plant: if, therefore, originally introduced, it must have been years ago, 
and may now be considered completely naturalized.
A doubt exists among several eminent continental as well as Eng- 
lish botanists, as to the claim of this plant to rank as a species ; and 
they are inclined to consider it a variety of G.
Aparine, while many 
others believe it to be really distinct.
From pretty close observation 
upon it in this locality, I cannot but think that the latter will prove 
the correct view of the subject.
A considerable difference of senti- 
ment doubtless exists, as to the definition and limits of species ; but 
if it be correct to consider clear and constant differences, which do 
not generally admit of intermediate forms, sufficient to constitute spe- 
cies, surely this must be entitled to rank as such.
These are, 1.
The 
minute size of the flower, and its greenish colour; never white, as in 
G. Aparine.
2. The remarkably branched dichotomous character of 
the inflorescence, which is most striking in an advanced stage of 
growth.
3. The invariably small size of the fruit, which is not half 
the size of that of G.
Aparine, and is usually more shining in appear- 
ance.
The habit of the plant, too, is somewhat different, being gene- 
rally less branched, and of a lighter green colour, but they are nearly 
alike in size.
I have not been able to find intermediate forms be- 
tween the two plants, so that though growing often entwined together, 
they are at all stages of growth readily distinguishable, even by super- 
ficial observers; therefore it appears that these characters are constant, 
and the fact of the plants being thus intermixed, renders it impossible 
to accoimt for their variations by difference of soil or situation.
Though hitherto only noticed in one spot, I think it very likely to 
be found in other localities throughout the kingdom, having probably 
been overlooked as Galium Aparine.
If such be the case, its claim 
to be considered a native plant will be strengthened.
Tragopogon pratensis.
Meadow at Walden.
I am unable to dis- 
cover in the descriptions or specimens of this species, any clear dis- 
tinction between this plant and T.
minor, except the length of the 
florets ; but this character is a variable one, as I have gathered spe- 
cimens this year, in the same field, some with the florets equal to, or 
rather exceeding, the calyx in length, some with the calyx twice the 
length of the florets, with intermediate varieties.
Can this, therefore, 
be considered sufficient to constitute it a distinct species, although the 
extreme forms certainly present a very dissimilar appearance ?
1126 
Crepis biennis (the true plant).
Chalky banks near Littlebuiy, rare.
Hypochoeris maculata.
Open hills near Hilclersham.
Mentha viridis and piperita.
Ditch-banks near Old Sampford.
M. gentilis ?
Road-side near Walden.
Cuscuta Epilinum.
Very destructive to the crop of flax in a field 
near Thaxted.
C. Trifolii has not been noticed here this year on clover, but I 
found it on a bank in the field where it was first discovered, growing 
on Centaurea Scabiosa, Achillaea Millefolium, Convolvulus arvensis, 
and other plants within its reach, indiscriminately.
There has been 
no clover in the field for two years, so that it does not seem to confine 
its attacks to that plant, or to require its presence.
Symphytum asperrimum.
Duck-street, between Audley End and 
Littlebury.
It has grown there for several years, but probably may 
have been originally introduced with rubbish from some garden.
Chenopodium urhicum.
Rubbish-heaps, rare.
Atriplex deltoidea.
Ditch-banks in the Park, sparingly.
Rumex pratensis.
Ditches near the Thaxted road.
This plant, if 
rightly named, and I have the authority of an eminent botanist for be- 
lieving it to be so, I cannot think other than a variety of R.
obtusifo- 
lius, as the form of the enlarged petals is very variable, even on the 
same plant; and there are gradations from the long, ligulate form of 
R. obtusifolius, to the small, triangular one of R.
pratensis : the 
breadth of the leaves is also uncertain.* 
Populus canescens.
Near Chesterford-common.
Allium ursinum.
Nun's wood, Walden.
Carex strigosa.
Ditto, raie.
C. losvigata.
Burton-wood, near Chesterford.
PJdeum Boehmeri.
Dry hills among sand, at Hildersham, but now 
very scarce, the land being mostly enclosed and cultivated.
Can any 
of your correspondents point out any other good localities for this 
grass in other parts of England, or is it confined to a small district in 
Cambridgeshire ?
* It is curious to notice the differences in the descriptions of R.
obtusifolius, given 
by Hooker and Babington.
The former says that the whorls are " rather close, some- 
what leafy ^'' the latter that they are " distant, leafless ; '' such a discrepancy is remark- 
able, but the fact is, that specimens maij be found agreeing with either of these de- 
scriptions.
As far as my observation has extended, the whorls are generally more or 
less leafy, but vary extremely in distance.
Surely then such variable characters should 
not be introduced as distinctive peculiarities of the species, as they must tend to per- 
plex rather than assist the young observer.
1126 
Barkhausia setosa has not reappeared, being doubtless, as before 
suggested, introduced with clover-seed from abroad ; it may however 
be expected as an occasional visitant.
A species of Phlox, which I noticed this summer at Darlington and 
elsewhere, has been found at Sampford ; and Lepidium sativum is of- 
ten seen by road-sides &c.
It is not unlikely that both these plants 
may ere long find their way into the list of naturalized species.
It is probable that a few other plants will occasionally be disco- 
vered in this neighbourhood, as it is many years before even a limited 
locality is thoroughly explored, and there will always remain some 
fields, woods and hedges unexamined, which may produce a rare or 
local plant, confined to one spot in the district.

â€” Notes of a Botanical Ramhle in Yorkshire 8^c.
in 
the Summer of 1844.
Communicated by James Backhouse, Jun.
(Concluded from p.
1093).
On the 11th of 7th Month our party again set out from Settle, and 
crossed the hills toward Malham.
On these we saw Thlaspi alpestre 
in abundance, especially on the rubbish at the mouth of the lead- 
mines.
We gathered fine specimens of Polemonium cseruleum in the 
fissures of some limestone rocks, near Malham-cove, where a valley 
is suddenly closed in by a huge cliff, from under which a small stream 
emerges.
Here we noticed Draba incana.
Geranium sanguineura, 
Pyrus Aria, and the remains of Draba muralis, which, as well as Hut- 
chinsia petrgea, was now dried up.
Leaving this place, we crossed a 
ridge of hills to Gordale-scar, a deep cavernous ravine in the lime- 
stone, where the overhanging cliffs present a striking and fearful as- 
pect.
At the further end of this opening we ascended the tumbled 
rocks of a waterfall, which pours from under a natural arch into the 
chasm beneath.
Near this place we saw Hieracium Lawsoni, Hip- 
pocrepis comosa, Epipactis ovalis, Equisetum variegatum, Potentilla 
alpestris, Ribes petrasum, and a remarkable form of Khinanthus 
Crista-galli, which however passed into the common one.
In a boggy 
piece of ground near Malham Tarn, we gathered Bartsia alpina, and 
on the adjacent crag, Polypodium calcareum, Ceterach officinarum, 
and a few specimens of Hieracium hypochoeroides.
A high wind ruf- 
fled the waters of the tarn, and brought considerable quantities of Po- 
tamogeton lucens, perfoliatus and prselongus to the shore.
1127 
On Arncliffe Clowder we found abundance of Dry as octopetala ?
but owing to the lateness of the season, it was chiefly out of flower.
This plant is strikingly different from that found in Teesdale, and 
may possibly prove a distinct species.
We passed the night at a 
comfortable little inn at Arncliffe, and the next morning bent our 
steps towards Hesletine Gill, where we gathered Potentilla alpestris, 
Avena alpina, Myrrhis odorata, Actaea spicata and Saxifraga umbrosa 
Tar. crenata, the latter in great abundance.
On the rocks near the 
head of the Gill, we saw Hieracium Lawsoni, and a Poa, probably P.
nemoralis, var.
glauca, and on the slope above, Crepis succissefolia, 
Hieracium prenanthoides and rigidum ?
We next ascended Penny- 
ghent, from the summit of which we had a fine and extensive view, 
though much the same as that from Ingleborough.
We descended 
the mountain on its western side, which is steep, and in some places 
precipitous.
On the millstone-grit rocks we noticed Salix herbacea 
and Sedum Rhodiola in profusion, and on the limestone, Saxifraga 
oppositifolia.
The violence of the wind prevented our exploring this 
part completely, and we consequently passed on towards the village 
of Horton, where, by the side of a brook, we found Mimulus luteus 
and Mentha citrata.
Near this place we visited a remarkable bog, 
called Helwith-moss, on which we noticed Habenaria bifolia and 
chlorantha, growing together, but still retaining their distinctive cha- 
racters; also Vaccinium Oxycoccos, Carex curta and Andromeda po- 
lifolia.
In this neighbourhood, Rumex aquaticus, Trollius europaeus.
Polygonum viviparum, Potamogeton pusillus and Hippuris vulgaris 
were plentiful.
After a fatiguing walk of sixteen miles, we again 
reached our comfortable quarters at Settle.
On the following day we visited the celebrated cave near Clapham; 
it is situated about a mile from the village, and near the extremity of 
a picturesque valley.
This magnificent cavern is about 1000 yards in 
length, and from its noble stalactites is probably not equalled by any 
other cave in the British islands.
Far removed from the light of day 
within its deep recesses, we noticed a plant of the Fungus tribe, pro- 
bably Rhizomorpha subterranea, spreading its root-like branches on 
a dripping mass of petrifaction.
Leaving the cavern, we attempted 
to cross the moors, in order to visit some localities for rare plants on 
the way to Settle ; but in consequence of dense fog, with rain and 
wind, we missed our way, and came upon one of the extensive " lime- 
stone pavements " with which this neighbourhood abounds, and after 
wandering for some time, found ourselves two miles further from the 
point of our destination than the place from which we started.
1128 
On the 13th of 7th Month, after parting from our kind friend, J.
Tatham, we left Settle by coach, and reached York that evening, hav- 
ing greatly enjoyed our excursion in the "mountain country." 
On the 18th, two of ou^ party again proceeded into Teesdale, in 
order to examine more fully the locality of Alsine (or Spergula) stricta.
We noticed Linaria purpurea on the cliflF below the ruins of Barnard- 
castle.
We reached Widdy-bank Fell about 6 o'clock that evening, and 
after a long and careful search succeeded in finding the plant.
Being- 
out of flower, it was with difficulty detected, and this difficulty was 
much increased by its growing with Arenaria verna, which was also 
out of flower.
With the exception of one solitary piece, we only 
found it in the limited locality where it was first discovered, though 
we searched many other likely places on the mountain very carefully.
Some authors have referred this plant to Spergula, some to Alsine, 
and others to Arenaria ; it has however a decidedly three-valved cap- 
sule, which necessarily places it in the genus Alsine.
We discovered another fine plant of Woodsia ilvensis on a part of 
Falcon Glints, far distant from the old locality ; likewise another soli- 
tary plant of Saxifraga umbrosa, var.
crenata.
On the way we col- 
lected some more specimens of Hieracium Lapeyrousii, which was 
just opening its flowers.

By Hewett C.
Watson, Esq.
Some correspondents of 'The Phytologist' (Phytol.
972, 1077) have 
been inditing censures, in the disguise of queries, on the nomencla- 
ture of the ' London Catalogue of British Plants,' compared with that 
of Edinburgh.
An importance is given to those censures, which they 
would not in themselves possess, by an editorial note (Id. 974) being 
attached to one of the letters.
And since ' The Phytologist ' has thus 
spread abroad, and given weight to, censures which are not in accord- 
ance with facts, I beg leave to say a few words upon the subject ; al- 
although I cannot, like my friend Mr. Dennes, call myself an office- 
bearer in the Society.
It is virtually stated by Mr. Sidebotham, though put as a query 
(Id. 972), that the Edinburgh Catalogue makes the names of British 
plants correspond with those in use on the continent, by correcting 
errors in other lists and works.
Mr. Sidebotham does not specify any 
1129 
continental authority ; nor, probably, was he able to do so.
But the 
editorial note more expressly refers to Steudel's ' Nomenclator Bota- 
nicus,' as an authority which should form the basis of a new Catalogue 
of names and synonymes.
That work is, indeed, a most valuable and 
important one ; and it is constantly in requisition with botanists, as a 
work of reference which is indispensible to every writer on plants, 
when names and synonymes have to be ascertained.
Under these circumstances, a comparison between the Edinburgh 
Catalogue and Steudels' work may fairly be instituted, to show how 
close is the correspondence between the Catalogue and the great con- 
tinental authority for names.
They both bear the date of 1841, but 
of course the Nomenclator was much longer in printing.
Now, I find 
that as the names of species stand in the Edinburgh Catalogue, nearly 
two hundred of them are given by Steudel as synonymes only.
They 
are thus not the names which this continental authority deems most 
properly applied to the plants.
If we add, further, some score or 
more of names in the Edinburgh Catalogue, which have no place at 
all in the work of Steudel (Atriplex deltoidea, Cerastium atrovirens, 
&c.), we may say that upwards of two hundred names in the Cata- 
logue differ fi'om those applied to the plants by Steudel.
This is a 
very large proportion, exceeding one in every eight names.
The 
Edinburgh Catalogue includes nearly 1600 reputed species.
After this example of alleged correspondence, let us now look at 
the contrary example of alleged difference.
The plan of the London 
Catalogue, rejecting dubious species and many very dubious natives, 
necessarily reduces the sum total.
The list of indigenous and intro- 
duced species, including the sub-species of Rubus, amounts to 1464 ; 
but as nearly thirty of these are additional species, not in the Edin- 
burgh Catalogue, the proper comparison must be made on the other 
1435.
It is troublesome to compare an arranged with an alphabeti- 
cal list very minutely ; but on going over the two, I find only about 
eighty species in the London Catalogue whose names differ from those 
in the Edinburgh Catalogue.
This is a proportion of about one name 
in every eighteen.
There is something amusing, truly, in such a result.
The Cata- 
logue which is praised for corresponding with continental authorities, 
actually differs from the great continental authority for nomenclature, 
to the extent of one-eighth of the whole.
But the Catalogue which 
is blamed for not corresponding with that of Edinburgh, actually dif- 
fers from it only to the extent of one-eighteenth t 
1 have not leisure to pursue the comparison further, but am dis- 
5c 
1130 
posed to believe, that the eighty names of the London Catalogue, 
which differ from those of the Edinburgh Catalogue, would be found 
more frequently in use in continental works, than are the correspond- 
ing names or synonymes of the Edinburgh Catalogue: not in each in- 
dividual instance, probably, but on the average of the whole.
More- 
over, so many of the plants which appear as species in the Edinburgh 
Catalogue, are enumerated as varieties only by Steudel, that it seems 
likely enough the London Catalogue may be nearer to the Nomen- 
clator in this respect, although I cannot say so with certainty.
The 
truth is, that continental authors of influence and reputation differ 
among themselves fully as much as (and probably more than) our Bri- 
tish authors.
Particular foreign authors might be selected, with 
whose works the Edinburgh Catalogue is in closer correspondence ; 
but my own supposition is, that the names of the London Catalogue, 
on an average, correspond better with those in the greater number of 
continental publications.
Let it be observed, the differences in the 
two Catalogues are seldom on questions of right or priority ; but turn 
more frequently on the greater or less subdivisions (and consequently 
re-naming) of old established genera.
Thus, the Linnaean genus Poa 
appears under two names in the London Catalogue, but under three 
in that of Edinburgh.
The Linnaean genus Scirpus is retained in the 
London Catalogue, but subdivided into Scirpus, Isolepis and Eleo- 
charis in that of Edinburgh; yet so little natural is this subdivision, 
that we find S.
multicaulis and pauciflorus â€” species so like as to be 
constantly confounded â€” put into different genera.

[There appears to be some slight misapprehension on the part of both Mr. Dennes 
and Mr. Watson, with regard to certain portions of Mr. Sidebotham's note, and of the 
editorial note appended thereto.
1. We do not find that Mr. Sidebothara anywhere 
praises the Edinburgh Catalogue for " corresponding with continental authorities," he 
says that it " was to make our names agree with the continental ones," not that it 
had done so.
2. The tendency of the editorial note is, on the whole, approval of the 
London Catalogue, mingled however with regret that uniformity of nomenclature has 
not hitherto been attained, and inviting correspondence on the subject.
This, indeed, 
is expressly stated at the outset of the note; and the omission or alteration of a single 
word â€” a mere lapsus calami â€” would take away even the appearance of censure.

Art. CCLl. â€” Note on Yew Trees.
By W.
Wilson, Esq.
Yew-tree in Bowden Church-yard, Cheshire.
An account of a tree within a tree has lately appeared in the news- 
papers ; and it is worthy of remark that there is a curious old yew- 
tree in Bowden church-yard, Cheshire, which presents an analogous 
appearance.
The rude sketch now sent was taken on the spot.
The 
tree is about 5 feet in diameter in the thinnest part of the trunk, hol- 
low and decayed on the east side.
Within the hollow, about 6 feet 
from the ground, a thick, forked, root-like stem, apparently connected 
with one of the principal branches, has at some distant period, but 
subsequent to the decay of the trunk, commenced its downward 
growth, and is now of considerable thickness.
It is covered with its 
own cortical layers.
Behind this there is a smaller separate root, 
about an inch in diameter, proceeding in a slanting direction from the 
right to the left.
1132 
About eight years ago, when passing the celebrated yew of Fortin- 
gal, in Perthshire, I was induced to examine its remains, then sur- 
rounded by a walled inclosure ; and from what I saw, my impression 
was that the entire circumference marked by the remains, had not been 
that of a solitary tree, but of several trees which had grown in a cir- 
cle.
May not this appearance have been produced by the same pro- 
cess, but on a larger scale, as that now going forward in the Bow den 
yew ?
It would thus appear that the branches of the tree make an 
effort to put forth internally, roots of their own, when the trunk ceases 
to convey the requisite nourishment from the ground.

â€” Three Days' Botanizing at Selhorne.
By T.
Bell Salter, M.D., F.L S.
Towards the latter end of last month, I paid a short visit to the 
village, which has been rendered so surpassingly interesting by the 
observations of that true lover of Nature, Gilbert White ; whose place 
and residence are now come into the possession of my much loved 
and excellent relative, Professor Bell.
It was during a short visit to 
the residence of White, and in the company of Bell, that the follow- 
ing observations were made, â€” association and associate to inspire 
great things.
Speaking of association, tempts me to add what I know 
must be gratifying to every naturalist, which is this ; â€” that the pre- 
sent owner of Selborne Park pi-eserves with the most sacred care all 
the local reminiscences of his illustrious predecessor â€” reminiscences, 
which are neither few in number, nor devoid of interest, but which it 
would be out of place further to allude to here.
With the habits of many of our birds the name of Selborne has long 
been, and will long continue to be, associated, from the circumstance 
of the originality and truthfulness of White's observations, and from 
the very remarkable fact, that notwithstanding the time which has 
elapsed, better observations have not since been made.
The graphic 
descriptions of this good man have also associated with the name of 
Selborne an idea â€” I had almost said a feeling â€” of all that is pictur- 
esque in Nature, and rustic and primitive in the manners of its sim- 
ple-minded habitants.
So numerous are the observations first made 
in this sequestered place, that one can imagine it to be the favoured 
resort of the feathered tribes : â€” and so may it well be ; for it is truly 
1133 
gratifying to find that no amount of early impressions are likely to 
carry one's fancy beyond the reality of its native charms.
For my 
own part, there was no anticipation which was not surpassed ; and 
what was the more gratifying to myself as a botanist, was to see very 
clear indications that the district is likely to prove not less rich to the 
botanist than to the zoologist.
It was too late in the season to expect to do very much in botaniz- 
ing, but I soon observed sufficient to be aware that not only might a 
very rich collection be obtained here, but that also very many most 
interesting observations might be made in this district, as respects 
geological Botany,* My time was not sufficient to make extended 
observations, nor am I myself a geologist, but I was so much struck 
with some of the peculiarities of this situation, that I cannot refrain 
from mentioning them.
Selborne is situated at the junction of the upper green sand and 
chalk formations, and the general fact of the fertility of the soil at the 
junction of any limestone and sandstone series, holds good here to a 
remarkable degree.
The well known beech Hanger^ which is on the 
west side of Selborne, is on the chalk, which is also the case with the 
beautifully wooded Nore Hill, two miles to the south of Selborne.
The general aspect of the landscape is decidedly hilly ,t and nearly all 
the hills slope gently to the west, and precipitously on the east side, 
which sides are very generally overgrown with wood, and designated 
hangers.
Passing to the east from Selborne, the level is diversified 
as above mentioned, but its general tendency is that of a declivity, 
until, at a distance of about three miles, you anive at a large sandy 
flat, which is composed of the lower green sand.
The intermediate 
part consists of the chalk marl and upper green sand, comprising, 
I am informed, some very remarkable modifications of these, which 
are highly interesting in a geological point of view.
In its unbroken 
state, the soil of this district is stratified rock or free stone, varying in 
* In speaking of geological Botany, I believe I am guilty of coining a new terra ; 
but I have often observed that the relations between the vegetation of different parts 
of a district, and its Geology, are most interesting, and would furnish a field for ob- 
servation, not less interesting than the geographical distribution of plants, or rather, T 
should say, form a most interesting subsection of this branch of Natural History.
In 
an agricultural point of view, such observations might be rendered of great benefit, as 
by them it might be judged, from the Botany of the fallows, what kinds of manure 
were required.
f Though very hilbj, I cannot accord with White in applying the word mountain- 
ous to this district.
1134 
its proportions of lime and sand.
This is seen in the beautiful rocky 
lanes or hollow ways, so graphically described by White, and which 
yield well in the spring and summer.
In the fields we have soils of 
sand and lime in the most varied proportions ; and it is this feature 
which renders the botanical distribution so striking.
One is surprised 
at the sudden transition, in many cases, from a Botany which is that 
of the limestone or chalk, to one which is essentially that of a sand 
district ; and in other instances by the mixture of both.
In addition to the hangers and rocky lanes, I must mention one or 
two other features or localities.
Tn the first place there is the Lith, 
a beautifully wooded vale, running east from Selbome, through which 
a very pretty stream takes its meandering course.
Wolmer forest is well described by White.
The total desolation 
of the scene and the sterility of the soil, are still just as he describes 
them.
But I cannot refrain from noticing the strange resemblance of 
the shore of Wolmer pond, to that of a creek of the sea.
There are 
the same loose white sand ^\^thout mould, and here and there the bar- 
ren black mud so usual in marine places : and even the vegetation 
increases the resemblance ; â€” the turf of innumerable plants of Lit- 
torella lacustris, so much resembling both Plantago maritima and 
Armeria maritima ; and the stunted oak and starved willow have the 
aspect of those which have suffered from the salt sea gales.
Short-heath, which is to the north-east of Selborne contains more 
depth of soil, and furnishes some good bog ground, abounding with 
Droserae, Anagallis tenella, Lycopodium inundatum and Polygonum 
minus.
Such a diversity of soil and situation promises much, and I think 
the following list, being one of only three short days' botanizing, and 
these late in the month of September, gives promise of many good 
things to those who can give more time to this locality, and at a more 
auspicious season.

I have not mentioned in this Hst so common a plant as Calluna vul- 
garis, but it worth noticing that the greater part of this plant, which 
abounds at Wolmer, is of the most hairy form.
We did not at Wolmer see any of the Vaccinium Oxycoccos, men- 
tioned by White as growing there, but it must be tolerably abimdant 
in some parts, as we met a poor woman with a handkerchief full, 
which she had collected for tarts.
The Epilobium angustifolium mentioned above must, a little earlier 
in the season, be a very great ornament, as it grows very tall, and in 
great profusion.
Epilobium roseum was growing in a rather unusual 
kind of locality.
I had never before seen it except in cultivated 
ground, and, with the exception of one garden at Salisbury, never far 
from London.
In the present instances it was growing in loose sand, 
by the side of running water, in very considerable abundance.
The 
flowers were unusually pale and little expanded, and what was fur- 
ther noticeable, it was always growing with E.
parviflorum, of intense 
colour.
The Sambucus Ebulus growing in the park, could not have been 
growing there in White's time, as he mentions the plant in his cata- 
logue, but not as growing so near him.
It might possibly have been 
planted by him.
White speaks of the lanes as abounding in ferns ; my impression 
was decidedly the reverse.
It is remarkable that Polystichum acule- 
atum and P.
angulare were generally growing together, but both in 
1136 
their most pronounced forms, the former being ahnost of the moun- 
tain or lobatum form.
A large yew-tree growing in the church-yard deserves notice.
We 
measured the trunk, at what appears the point of its greatest circum- 
ference, which was about four feet from the ground, and found it to 
be at that part twenty-four feet and eight inches ; but the Rev.
Parsons, the present incumbent, informs me that at one part it mea- 
sures twenty-seven feet.
The maples growing in the park deserve some notice.
From a large 
knotted mass of wood, rise from six to eight stout trunks, averaging a 
circumference of about three feet each.
These all ascend, slightly 
diverging, and forming as it were a compound trunk.
At the height 
of about fifteen feet they break into one magnificent head, not inferior 
to a very respectable sycamore.
There are in the park many such 
groups, or rather compound trees.
I have omitted all mention of the Rubi from the above list, not be- 
cause there were few forms, or that they were devoid of interest, for 
it was quite otherwise, but because they are still suh judice.

â€” Remarks on some Species of Clienopodium.
By Geo. Fitt, Esq.
Having lately paid some attention to the undermentioned species, 
with the view of satisfying myself that they are all really distinct, I 
send you the result of my observations.
Chenopodium intermedium.
Leaves triangular, slightly attenuated 
at the base, inclining to hastate, deeply and irregularly toothed, teeth 
acute, dull green, not shining, vnealy beneath, somewhat leathery in 
texture ; leaves on the spikes toothed, seldom entire, those of young 
plants blunt, hastate, and but slightly toothed.
Spikes long, some- 
what leafy, clusters distant ; seeds flattened, as large as rape-seed, 
rough ; calyx 5-cleft.
Stem angular, strong, erect.
Smell of the whole plant rank, especially the calyces.
C rubrum.
Leaves nearly rhomboid, seldom triangular, deeply 
and irregularly toothed, teeth blunt, shining, fleshy, upper ones 
scarcely toothed, those of the spikes generally entire, rhomboidal or 
1137 
ovate : in some plants the large leaves of the stem are nearly triangu- 
lar, slightly attenuated at the base, resembling those of intermedium, 
and in others they are almost tlu'ee-lobed.
Stems angular, generally 
erect, occasionally procumbent and with leaves not fully developed, 
when the plant somewhat resembles C.
botryodes.
Spikes compound 
very leafy, and the clusters much crowded.
Seeds one fourth the size 
of those of C.
intermedium, rather rough and flattened.
Calyx in 
three deep segments, edges membranaceous.
Smell scarcely unpleasant.
C. botryodes.
Leaves triangular, inclined to hastate, shortly atten- 
uate at the base, slightly toothed, the teeth acute, lower leaves very 
blunt, almost rounded and etith-e ; small upper leaves, and those of 
the spikes sometimes rhomboid : in luxuriant specimens, a few leaves 
are sometimes deeply and acutely toothed, hastate and pointed : in 
their general form they resemble those of C.
Bonus-Henricus, with 
the addition of the teeth, but in texture they are like those of C.
ru- 
brum and C.
intermedium ; in the figure in Smith's 'English Botany,' 
they are made too pointed and lengthened, the figure is otherwise cha- 
racteristic : tinged with crimson, especially beneath.
Stems weak, 
procumbent, of a deep crimson colour.
Spikes rather leafy, resem- 
bling those of C.
intermedium, the clusters even less crowded.
Seeds 
as small as those of C.
rubrum, in a loose skin, vertical.
Calyx 
closed over the fruit so as to appear entire, and bursting in three short 
segments.
When fresh-gathered, the smell is like that of the pods of green peas.
I omitted to examine the flowers when in season.
On the end of 
the spike of this species there is generally a central 5-cleft calyx.
I have always found C.
intermedium constant to the above charac- 
ters ; and by its very rank smell, larger seeds, and the uniformity of 
its leaves, it may be readily known from C.
rubrum.
C. botryodes, in general appearance and habit, is more distinct 
from C.
rubrum than the above.
It is by no means a variable plant, 
its lower leaves are always the same in form and texture.
During the 
last two years I have observed the growth of some hundreds of plants; 
and I have now before me a score of good ones, besides dried speci- 
mens ; and yet I have not, that I recollect, met with one about the 
identity of which I have had the least doubt.
It often grows side by 
side with C.
rubrum, although they do not usually inhabit the same 
soil, and in this juxta-position each maintains its distinctiveness.
The 
5 D 
1138 
fact is, C.
rubrum is a very variable plant, and some peculiar form of 
it may be mistaken for C.
botryodes by those who have not had the 
opportunity of seeing living specimens of the latter; and thus they 
have been thought not distinct.
It would not be easy to decide the 
question from preserved specimens, as they lose much of their charac- 
ter in the process of drying.
One fact connected with C.
botryodes will, I think, be interesting 
to botanists.
It grows in the greatest profusion and beauty (for it is 
a handsome plant) where mud has been thrown out of ditches during 
the summer, and where grass has not had time to grow.
Four or five 
days since, I found a considerable number of specimens in a marsh, 
where it had not appeared before for several years, as I have visited 
the spot constantly in my botanical walks.
This place is two miles 
distant from where I usually find the plant, and two rivers intervene.
I can only account for its sudden appearance, by supposing that the 
seeds lie dormant at the bottom of the ditches, preserving their vege- 
tative power, until a favourable opportunity offers for them to grow, 
when cast out with the mnd.
The plant does not grow on the same 
spot on the following year after its appearance in this manner, except 
in small quantity, as it will not thrive among grass.
I went to one 
station last year, to gather specimens for Dr. Wood, and found to my 
dismay, that the spot was buried beneath heaps of mud.
In three 
weeks after, an abundant crop of C.
botryodes was the result.
Scarce- 
ly a specimen growls there this season, although thousands of seeds 
must have fallen on the soil, now nearly covered with grass and.Atri- 
plex patula.
In proof that the seeds in these cases were in the mud, 
wherever the latter was scattered about the marsh, as it was in several 
places, there grew C.
botryodes in profusion.
I should feel greatly obliged to any botanist who would furnish me 
with a specimen of C.
ficifolium in flower and in fruit; and I should 
be happy to give him, in return, good specimens of C.
botryodes.
They might be sent by post.

Note on the Spotted Hieracia.
Discordant opinions have 
been given respecting the correct specific names of our hawkweeds 
which bear leaves stained with black or purple, (Phytol.
741, 801, 
1139 
841, 865).
Too much stress has been laid on the stained character 
of the leaves.
Smith says of H.
murorum, that " the leaves are never 
stained with black." The same author describes the leaves of H.
maculatum as " dark green above, more or less speckled with black 
or dark purple." Of H.
sylvaticum he writes, " Herb hairy, of a pale, 
unspotted, grass green." The leaves of H.
pulmonarium he describes 
as "bright green" and "clouded with faint blotches of purplish 
brown." No mention is made in ' English Flora,' of stains upon the 
leaves of H.
Lawsoni.
It would thus seem that Smith referred all the 
spotted-leaved plants which he had seen, either to his maculatum or 
pulmonarium ; and succeeding botanists have doubtless been misled 
by Smith's error.
Having had the opportunity of examining many 
plants with spotted leaves, in the Eastern Highlands, this year, I 
venture to offer the following conclusions, derived from these and the 
specimens previously in my hands, 1.
H. murorum, more frequently 
than other reputed species, varies with spotted leaves ; and in this 
state it has been usually labelled maculatum or pulmonarium.
It is 
this which Mr. Gibson denominated hypochoeroides (Phytol.
741), on 
account of the plant having been formerly mistaken for Hypochoeris 
maculata.
2. H.
Lawsoni also varies with stained leaves.
I saw 
numerous examples of this in Aberdeenshire, the present year ; and it 
has appeared in my garden, among the descendants of unstained wild 
plants, brought from Perthshire, some few years ago.
The stains on 
this species are streaks rather than spots.
3. T have never seen a 
wild specimen of H.
sylvaticum (certainly so) with these marks on 
the leaves ; but a plant in Kew Gardens, which may be correctly as- 
signed to this species, has its leaves much clouded with dark purple.
This plant (equally with others, with dark green and unstained leaves, 
in my own garden) differs from the descriptions of H.
sylvaticum, by 
having numerous radical and few stem leaves ; but I suppose the dif- 
ference in the number and colour of the radical leaves to arise from 
the garden locality.
As to the stem-leaves, the wild plants of H.
syl- 
vaticum have often only one or two, besides those at the very base.
4. Among a number of young plants, brought to my garden from Can- 
lochen Glen, on account of their spotted leaves, some apparently will 
prove to be H.
nigrescens and others H.
murorum.
This is an addi- 
tional circumstance (Phytol.
804) towards showing the identity of H.
pulmonarium [Smith) and H.
nigrescens [Willd) At all events, the 
plant of Smith appears to me to have small resemblance to Lawsoni, 
with which Mr. Babington unites it under the name of diaphanum.
5. There is the variety pictum of H.
rigidum (Bab. Man.) for another 
1140 
stained-leaved Hieracium ; but I possess no specimen of it, nor do I 
clearly understand what is intended under the name of rigidum.
Thus, we have varieties " maculatum " of H.
murorum, Lawsoni, pul- 
monarium, sylvaticum, rigidum, and, probably, nigrescens â€” if this 
latter is not the same as pulrnonarium.
In Decandolle's Prodromus, 
there is only a single "maculatum" recognized byname; and that 
one is placed as a variety under H.
murorum.

You

notice of the discovery of Leersia oryzoides as a British plant.

Note on Jimcus diffusus f A plant which I had supposed 
might be Juncus diffusus, grows plentifully within the sand-hills, on 
the east side of Huntston, between Lynn and Wells, Norfolk.
It 
forms spreading patches of large size, mixing with J.
maritimus.
I 
thinlc the same plant grows also near the river, above Lynn, but what 
I took for it there was much injured by cattle.
Juncus effusus is no- 
ticed as Biitish, in Babington's Manual, "on the authority of W.
Son- 
der, of Hamburgh, who possesses Scottish specimens." It may be 
distinguished from J.
glaucus by having solid pith ; that of J.
glaucus 
being cellular : it is also a greener plant, and has mucronate fruit.
This notice may perhaps lead to further enquiry.

Note on Cuscuta europcea, 8fc.
I lately noticed Statice spa- 
thulata, growing in company with S.
Limonium and S.
reticulata, near 
Wells, in the opening opposite Holkham ; and Cuscuta europsea, on 
nettles, in the Bulwark-road, Earith, Huntingdonshire.
C. europaea 
is of frequent occurrence in the adjacent parts of Cambridgeshire, 
where it is called " scald ; " it may be presumed, on account of the 
scalded appearance which it gives to the bean- crops, to which it is 
often injurious.
Burning the bean-chaff, and keeping the hedges free 
from nettles, have removed this pest to the farmer from some places 
where it formerly abounded.

Note on Carex teretiuscula.
Your correspondent Mr, Lux- 
ford (Phytol.
1021) has appealed to me for further information as to 
the Carex found near Halnaby, and which I conceived at the time 
might be a small variety of C.
paniculata, A further examination has 
1141 
convinced me that it is C.
teretiuscula ; and for this I have also the 
authority of Dr. Boott.

Note on Athyrium Filix-foemina as a Tree-fern.
In a small 
bog very near Ryde, are some plants of Athyrium Filix-fcemina, which 
must be of very considerable age, the rhizomata being raised to the 
height, in several instances, of a foot and a half to two feet, thus con- 
stituting the plant, in some degree, a tree fern.
The rhizomata how- 
ever do not stand free as proper stems, but the old fronds, decayed 
and overgrown with Sphagnum, form slender conical tumuli, filled 
with fibres from the rhizomata, by which the plant assimilates to itself 
again the decayed materials of its former fronds.
Many of the rhizo- 
mata are much branched, the whole length of the branches however 
being contained in the sphagnous mould.
The rhizomata and branch- 
es, though contained in this mass of decayed vegetable matter, do not 
themselves decay, but may be traced throughout, some of the leading 
ramifications being more than a foot in length.
Carex paniculata is 
growing in the same little bog, and the tumuli formed by the fern bear 
a very strong resemblance to those of this Carex, so well known when, 
under favourable circumstances, it attains a considerable age.

Note on Stipa pennata.
The long feathery awn by which the 
persistent palea of this grass is surmounted, is well known ; but one 
interesting part of its structure appears to have escaped observation.
Below the feathery portion, the awn is spirally twisted, and the seed 
has a sharp point, which is oblique exactly in the axis of the spire of 
the awn.
By means of this contrivance, when the seed falls to the 
ground it becomes buried to some little depth.
This structure is in 
accordance with the constitution of the seed, for I find those which 
are thus imbedded seldom fail to vegetate, while those which become 
dry are apt to lose their vegetative power.
â€” John Lawrence ; St.
John's, near Ryde, October, 1844.
[In the generic description of Stipa, Smith says " Cor. of 2 valves, nearly equal in 
length ; the outer elliptic-lanceolate, involute, slightly keeled, with a very long, termi- 
nal, twisting awn, jointed, and finally separable, at the base.
* * Seed 
cylindrical, pointed, loose, closely enveloped in the hardened outer valve of the corolla, 
which is very sharp, and barbed with bristles, at the base, so as to penetrate and fix 
itself in the earth." And again : â€” '^Flowers erect, slender, with long aims, bent just 
above the twisting part ; then straight; either feathery or naked." â€” Eng. Flor.
i. 161.
Hooker also observes : â€” 'â– 'â– Cor. cartilaginous, involute, terminated with a very long 
twisted awn, jointed at the base, and finally separating at the joint.
* * A 
great ornament to our gardens in the summer, and to our rooms in the winter, for if 
gathered before the seed is ripe, <hc long feathery awns remain, and a tuft of them is 
1142 
almost as beautiful as the famed tail of the Bird of Paradise." â€” Brit.

Such of the CompositSB as have their fniit crowned with a pappus, whether stipitate or 
sessile, present a somewhat analogous provision for ensuring both the dispersion and 
the subsequent germination of the seed.
The thistles offer a familiar illustration.
When the seed, separated from its pai'ent plant, and borne to a distance by its beauti- 
ful balloon, has met with a spot suitable for germination, it becomes, as it were, screwed 
into the ground ; the pappus then separates from the seed by an articulation at the 
apex of the latter, and buoyantly floats away.
If the thistle-down with which the air 
is filled in autumn, be examined, very few will be found with the seed attached, but 
the rays of the pappus will be seen to proceed from a central elastic ring.
At this 
ring the pappus was articulated with the seed.

Note on Asplenium fontanum.
" Eveiy man has his bubbly 
Jock," and Asplenium fontanum appears to be mine.
I might per- 
haps deny the existence of such a fern, and treat it merely as a name 
unrepresented by a reality ; but T decline availing myself of this plea, 
and acknowledge that there are three European species of Asplenium 
successfully cultivated by our nurserymen under this name, and freely 
distributed to those inclined to purchase.
I therefore admit the ex- 
istence of such a fern, and merely dispute its having been found wild 
in Britain.
My correspondence on this subject would fill several 
numbers of ' The Phytologist,' but I have no idea of dragging it before 
the public.
Still, Mr. Redhead and Mr. Thompson, by cdXimg public 
attention to supposed discoveries, seem to invite a public reply.
Of 
all the recorded British habitats of Asplenium fontanum, Mr. Red- 
head's appears to me decidedly the best and most worthy of reception 
(Phytol.
1084).
In the first place, the specimens are actually in exist- 
ence ; are decidedly referrible to Asplenium Halleri, one of the spe- 
cies cultivated under the name of fontanum ; and finally, they came 
into ray hands directly from the discoverer ; who unequivocally de- 
clares that at a certain date, and at a certain place, he gathered them 
with his own hand.
This, one would suppose sufficient for the most 
sceptical ; but I will venture to ask Mr. Redhead a few questions, 
which, if he will kindly and satisfactorily answer, I will instantly apo- 
logize for having expressed the slightest doubt on the subject.
1. 
Will Mr. Redhead inform the readers of ' The Phytologist,' whether 
he was more than eight years of age when he discovered Asplenium 
fontanum in WharnclifFe wood, in the year 1838 ; and if older than I 
suppose, will he please to say how much older ?
2. Will Mr. Red- 
head inform the readers of ' The Phytologist,' whether he had any 
knowledge whatever of Botany at the peiiod of this discovery ; that 
is, whether he believes that in 1838, he would have known a fern from 
a thistle ?
3. Will Mr. Redhead inform the readers of ' The Phyto- 
1143 
logist,' whether he labelled the specimens found by him in 1838, with 
date, locality, &c., at the time of finding them ; and if not, by what 
means he traces the specimens sent to London to the date and loca- 
lity mentioned ?
If Mr. Redhead succeeds in demonstrating to the 
readers of ' The Phytologist,' that in 1838 he had arrived at years of 
discretion and judgment ; that he possessed a tolerable acquaintance 
with British plants ; that he was then in the habit of collecting and 
labelling plants ; that he recognized this fern as a rarity, or exhibited 
it to any botanist who told him its name and value ; then I shall be 
inclined to enter into the subject more at length.
But if it turns out 
as I suspect, that Mr. Redhead was a mere child, neither possessing 
nor pretending to possess the slightest knowledge of Botany, neither 
labelling nor even collecting plants; â€” why then 1 think the question 
may be considered as decided.
In reply to Mr. Thompson's com- 
munication (Phytol.
1081), it may be well to state that Mr. Shepherd's 
supposed discovery was thoroughly sifted prior to the publication of 
my British Ferns, and this, not only by myself, but by a botanist 
whose judgment is received with universal respect ; and he fully unit- 
ed with me in considering the evidence unsatisfactory.
I may add, 
that during the past week, a dealer in British ferns called at the print- 
ing-office, and in the presence of a valued contributor to ' The Phy- 
tologist ' (G.
S. Gibson), stated that he knew of three British localities 
for Asplenium fontanum.
He sells these rarities daily at the eastern 
entrance of the Bank of England ; or, if the metropolitan market 
appear to be glutted for a season, he tours the provinces, supplying 
country botanists on very liberal terms.
His supply is inexhaustible.
