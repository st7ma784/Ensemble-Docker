characters of which groupe is '' pappus 
fragillimus;" while Don says of this Ge- 
nus " pappus mollis." To us the pappus 
appears to be certainly neither rigid nor 
fragile, although it is more so than in the 
Lactucew, from which, moreover, it dif- 
fers in the brown, not white, colour.
In

states the leaves to be entire.
The pap- 
pus is paleaceo-setaceous, its rays sprink- 
led with short hairs or longish teeth, so 
that they may either be termed slightly 
plumose with Lagasca, or dentato-cili- 
ated with Don. We prefer the latter from 
their affinity with P.

rays are only serrulate.

Parker, Esq. â€” Closely as 
this is allied to the C.
procumbens in its 
habit and foliage, it is unquestionably a 
distinct species, judging at least from all 
that I have received from the more 
northern states, from Pennsylvania (Mr.
Schweiniiz, Mr, Townsend), and from 
Kent\ic]iy(I)r,Shoria.ndMr,Greiswold.) 
Their plant has the fruit oblong, whereas 
our Mississippi plant has it decidedly 
acuminated into a kind of beak ; so that 
were it not for the distinct ridges, I should 
refer it to Anthriscus.
The fruit is some- 
times rather densely pubescent, at other 
times glabrous and even shining.
The 
styles, though short, are longer than in 
C, procumbens, and much more distinct

compressed, and with a very short but 
decided beak, not cristate as described 
by Lessing.
The numbers of rows of 
female florets are very inconstant; thus in 
our specimen fjom Buenos Ayres, they 
are all female, with the exception of a 
few bisexual ones in the centre : among 
those from Valparaiso, we have found 
one with two scapes or rather almost 
sessile capitula, in one of which there 
are several rows of ligulate florets, the 
inner ones being reduced almost to mere 
styles, from the nearly total abortion of 
the hgula ; in the other, there are but 
two rows, one decidedly ligulate, the 
other with an abortive ligula.
In other 
specimens also, from Chili, we find the 
second or inner series so ill defined, as 
to have induced us, at one time, to sup- 
pose^ that there was but a single row, â€” 
Lessing's generic character ought there- 
fore to^be slightly modified, thus: Ache-

which we possess from Chili, from Cum-

proving one and the same species.
Cum- 
ing's are only in bud, but from them we 
tave added the description of the style 
(which is perfectly glabrous), and of the 
pappus : the leaflets of the involucre are 
broadly ovate, with a rather long mucro; 
we have not been able to ascertain the 
structure of the caudoe at the base of the 
anthers.
forwarded to us an enlarged generic cha- 
racter, which we add, though we can 
point out no difference between it and 
Gochnatia, except the longer branches 
of the style :

ven thousand vegetables were known, and 
that this great botanist estimated the total 
number of plants on the surface of the 
earth, as not amounting to more than ten

DESCRIPTION OF MALAYAN PLANTS.
265 
I can only add the particulars which the For the natural affinities and a more de- 
tailed account of the method of procuring 
the Camphor,!
I may refer to the able paper 
examination of flowering specimens has 
enabled me to supply.
The flowers are 
terminal and axillary, forming a kind of 
panicle at the extremity of the branches.
The corolla is five-petaled^ longer than the 
calyx, the petals ovate-lanceolate, and in 
some degree adnate or connected together 
at the base.
The stamina are numerous, 
and have their filaments united into a ring, 
in which particular it differs from the ge- 
nera most nearly related to it.
The an- 
thers are nearly sessile on the tube of the 
filaments, conniving into a conical head 
round the style, and terminating in acute, 
membranaceous points.
The ovary is 
three-celled, containing two ovula in each llTr^Tordir Cam^^^^^^^^^ 
cell.
The style is longei' than the stamina, being supposed to be the first stage of the latter's 
forming, and is consequently fouad in joanger trees- 
The natives have no certain means of ascertaining the 
tree which produces either the one or the other; al- 
* The foHowing particulars concerning the extrac- 
tion of tlie Camphor, were communicated by Mr.
Prince, Resident at Tapanoolyy to Dr. Roxburgh, and 
are extracted from the 12tb vol, of the Asiatic Re- 
searches above referred to: 
" This tree grows sjiontaneously in the forests ; and 
is to be found in abuiidaGce from the back of Ayer 
Bongey, as far north as Bacongaut n distance of two 
hundred and fifty miles.
It may be classed among 
the tallest and largest trees tliat grow on this coast; 
several within daily view measuring six or seven feet 
diameter.
Before it acquires such dimensions, its 
ap^e is conjectured to be very considerable ; but it will 
produce Cainphor at a much earlier period, when the 
tree does not exceed two and two feet and a half in 
diameter.
The same tree which yields the Oil would 
diately to the North of the Equator, They 
are also found in Borneo in nearly the same 
and crowned by a capitate stigma.
In Sumatra the Camphor-trees are con- 
fined to the country of the Battas, which though there are some men, styled Toongoo Xyr bap- 
extends abo.ut a decree and a half imme- poor, who pretend to that knowledge; but they cannot 
give any reasons for their judgment, beyond favoura- 
ble dreams, which superstition has rendered infallible: 
and it must be admitted that the success of this de- 
parallel of latitude, and I have reason to scription of people, in discovering and procuring, is 
believe that there are some in the nei2:h- greater than the majority of those who go in search of 
the Camphor; the distinction may have arisen from 
the peculiar favour of fortune to some individuals over 
others, as in most other circumstances of life, from 
whence they have acquired a celebrity, otherwise they 
could give some rational explanation of their snperior 
success.
Both Oil and Camphor are found in the heart 
bourhood of Singapore and Johore.
This 
valuable tree is not known to exist in any 
other part of the world, and on this account, 
as the difficulty of obtaining its

r of the tree, occupying a vacuum wtiicn, m otners is 
exorbitant price.
It is all carried to China, 
^'here it sells for about twelve times as 
much as that of Japan.
Ihis Camphor is found in a concrete 
state, occupying cavities and fissures in the 
heart of the tree.
In order to obtain it, 
the tree is felled and split into lengths, to 
allow of the extraction of the crystallized 
masses.
The same trees yield both the 
concrete substance and an oil, which is 
supposed to be the first stage of the form- 
lotion of the Camphor.
The Sumatran 
Camphor is little known in Europe, and it 
would perhaps deserve examination to as- 
certain how far its properties differ from 
those of the common kind.
It appears to 
te less volatile, and its odour is not so dif- 
fusive.
A quantity of it has been recently 
forwarded to Sir E.
Home, for the purpose

frequently fiHed with pitch ; but it does not extend to 
the whole length ; on the coutrarj, thej are found in 
small portions, of a foot, and a foot and a half long, at 
certain distances.
The method of extracting the Oil 
is merely by making a deep incision with a billiong or 
Malay axe, In the tree, aboat fourteen or eighteen feet 
from the ground, till near the heart, where a deeper 
incision is made with a small aperture; and the Oil, 
if any iu the tree, immediately gushes out, and is re- 
ceived in bamboos, or any olher utensil better approved 
of; in this manner, a party proceeds through the woods 
wounding the Camphor-trees till they attain their ob- 
ject.
Tlie Camphor is procured in pretty nearly the 
same way.
The trees are cut to the heart aboat the 
same height from the ground as in the former instance, 
till the Camphor is seen ; hundreds may be thus muti- 
lated before the sought-for tree is discovered; wben 
attained, it is felled, and cut in junks of a fathom 
long, which are again split, and the Camphor is found 
in the heart, occupying a space in circumference of 
the thickness of a man\s arm.
The produce of a 
middling-sized tree is about eight Ch'ma catties, or 
nearly eleven pounds, and of a large one, doable that 
quantity.
The Camphor thus found is called Se Tan- 
long.
It is often the case that the trees which have

ACCOUNT OF THE ARAUCARIA 
IMBRICATA OF CHILL 
From Dr.Poeppig's Travels in South America.
The Araucaria, a tree that affords to 
the Indians of the Patagonian Andes a 
great part of their food, will not grow on 
the low lands, and it also preserves an 
accurately defined boundary with respect 
to its northern limits.
When transplanted 
into many parts of the Province of Con- 
cepcion, it exhibits a sickly and deteriorated 
appearance; and vegetates so reluctantly
