PREFACE.
THE Flora of a single parish, even though an extensive 
one, can only justify its separate existence by being some- 
thing more than a mere list of species.
If its treatment of 
the local problems of plant distribution is not sufficiently 
ample to afford material for wider investigations, it can at the 
best appeal to but a narrow circle, and remain parochial both 
in name and in fact.
It is hoped that no such reproach can 
be attached to the present work.
Nor is this hope grounded 
simply on the fact that every group of plants is enumerated, 
with some approach to completeness, in itself a somewhat 
exceptional feature ; but rather on the detailed consideration 
of each species and the application of Watson's principles, 
supplemented by a description of the characteristic plant 
communities.
In this respect, perhaps, the Flora marks an 
advance in methods, and by describing the salient features of 
the vegetation of the Parish, is more likely to be of service 
both to residents within its borders and to botanists concerned 
with geographical distribution.
Since the chapter on plant-associations was written the 
methods there adopted have been winning their way, and some 
of the " neglected problems " have already been ably investi- 
gated.
But at the time the only guide available was the first 
paper by Robert Smith, on " Plant Associations of the Tay 
Basin." In attempting to apply these methods locally I was 
greatly assisted by Mr. C.
E. Moss.
The types both of wood- 
land and moorland presented features differing in many ways 
from those described by Smith, and the benefit of discussion 
with some one who viewed the vegetation of the parish from 
the same standpoint, proved invaluable in determining the 
various plant communities that form the Flora, and the mem- 
bers and the conditions of existence of each.
It is a pleasure 
to see that a botanical survey, begun in this way, has already

where : and, indeed, the first fruits of it, the ' ; Botanical Map

Smith, Ph.D.,

Sc., provides the one feature necessary 
to round off the enquiry, and removes the necessity of in- 
cluding a similar map of the parish in this work.
The publication of the Flora was commenced as long ago 
as [896.
By issuing it as a separately-paged supplement to 
the Halifax Naturalist, of which it was the raison d'etre, the 
financial difficult) was solved, and at the same time the lengthy 
period of production permitted attention to be concentrated 
on one portion at a time, with the hope of eventually 
including the cryptogamic flora.
This has happily been 
realised, and as was anticipated, the whole responsibility for 
the latter has been undertaken by Mr. Crossland.
His con- 
tribution far exceeds mine in number of species, and is evidence 
of the thoroughness with which the lower forms of vegetation 
have been recorded in recent years in a parish inseparably 
associated with some of the earliest work in this branch.
The 
list of Fungi in particular is quite without a parallel for any 
equal area, and it incorporates many species previously un- 
recorded in any British, or even any Flora.
My only share in 
the Flora, from the Mosses onwards, has been in seeing it 
through the press.
So leisurely a production required care 
in adopting from the beginning a scheme which could be fol- 
lowed throughout.
Of necessity abbreviations have been 
more freely employed in the latter part, but there is no 
material deviation from the original plan, and the treatment 
remains practically uniform.
Apart from assistance received from the Botanical Section 
of the Scientific Society and its individual members, and other 
obligations acknowledged elsewhere, I am indebted for the 
determination of critical species and other information to 
Messrs.

INTRODUCTION.
CHAPTER I.
The Parish of Halifax.
T 
HE Parish of Halifax, situated in the West Riding of 
Yorkshire, is a natural geographical division, lying on 
the eastern slopes of the Pennine Chain, and drained by the 
river Calder and its tributaries.
Its extreme length from west 
to east is sixteen miles, its breadth fourteen and a half 
miles, and its circumference fifty-four miles.
It is one of 
the largest of the ancient parishes of England, and though 
it is no longer an ecclesiastical unit, and is divided into 
many and varying civil areas, its popular use has never been 
superseded, and the life of the parish still centres in the county 
borough of Halifax.
It contains 129 square miles, so that it 
approaches Rutland, or the Isle of Wight in size.
But in 
elevation and configuration it is entirely different.
It is 
essentially a moorland plateau, descending eastwards, from 
1500 to 500 feet in fifteen miles.
As, however, it is inter- 
sected its whole length by the Calder, the moors also slope 
downwards to the south or the north, according as they lie 
north or south of the central valley.
Hence the boundary 
of the parish forms, with certain slight exceptions, the 
watershed of the upper Calder.
t 
The western boundary for its whole length of twenty miles 
is coincident with the county division of Lancashire and 
Yorkshire and with the summit ridge of the 
Boundaries.
Pennine Chain.
Consequently it never des- 
cends below 1200 feet, except where it meets 
the gap caused by the Calder, which it follows from Cornholme 
to Todmorden.
The recognised source of the Calder at Calder 
Head, lies a mile and a half west of the parish boundary, and 
the streams descending from Summit and Walsden Moor and 
- joining the main river at Todmorden also lie without the 
in parish ; but this is perhaps due to the Calder having at some 
><r-r period cut its way back beyond its natural watershed and 
C**- captured the head waters of the Lancashire streams.
However 
X. THE FLORA OF HALIFAX.
this may be, the fact that the valley at Todmorden is only 400 
feet above the sea level, and at Calder Head only 750 feet, has 
caused it to become a natural artery for the flow of traffic 
between south Lancashire and the West Riding, and has 
largely influenced the history of the parish.
This pass differs 
very much from the only other, but more extensive, break in 
the Pennine Chain, between Skipton and Settle.
The valley 
of the Calder down to Hebden Bridge is almost a gorge, in 
places wholly occupied by the railway, road, river and canal, 
which penetrate through it.
Still richly wooded, it must have 
been at one time, before the river was defiled and the valley 
blocked by mills, highly picturesque.
The more ancient route 
across this boundary is, however, the famous pass over Black- 
stone Edge (1277 feet), which maintained its supremacy from 
Roman times to the advent of railways.
Eastward from Waystone Edge(i55o feet) the boundary is 
not quite so natural ; the upper part of Blackburn Valley, 
known as Dean Head, is excluded, whilst a portion of Fixby 
Park, which is included in the parish, is in the basin of the 
Colne.
The eastern boundary, from Shelf (800 feet) to Brighouse 
is formed by Royds Hall Beck and Clifton Beck, and for a 
short distance the Calder, which finally leaves the parish at 
Rastrick, 170 feet above sea level.
The northern boundary from Jackson's Ridge to Queens- 
bury descends gradually from 1500 to 1100 feet, and is almost 
wholly the true water parting of the Calder and Aire.
Perhaps 
the only exception is on the northern slope of Swill Hill, 
which is partly included in the parish ; but the area in question 
is only a few acres.
To understand the form of the surface of the land 
within the parish, it is necessary to go deeper and enquire 
what the rocks are, and how they are arranged.
Geological From a botanical point of view, the geology of 
Features.
the district is comparatively simple, and a 
short survey will suffice.
Further explanation 
and details will be found in the papers on the Physiograph- 
ical Features and the Strata of the Parish, by Wm. Simpson, 
F.G.S., in the first volume of the Halifax Naturalist.
The upheaval of the Carboniferous system, which produced 
the Pennine anticlinal, and the subsequent denudation cause 
all the strata of the parish to dip in a south-easterly direction, 
and the oldest rocks of the series to appear at the surface in 
THE PARISH OF HALIFAX.

the extreme west of the parish, and successively to pass under 
the outcrop of the newer and overlying members in proceed- 
ing eastwards.
The dip is considerable, about one in twenty, 
and is accurately represented by the slope on which the greater 
part of Halifax is built.
For in fact the eastward slope of 
nearly all the moors is the actual dip of the strata.
As soon 
as the western boundary is passed, as it practically coincides 
with the axis of the anticlinal, the strata dip rapidly to the 
west, so much so that the Lower Coal Measures, which are 
nine miles to the east of Blackstone Edge or Widdop, reappear 
in Lancashire within a mile or two.
Perhaps the chief 
botanical interest of this lies in the consequence that this 
western encarpment is fully exposed to the prevailing winds, 
which are now-a-days laden with the smoke from the south 
Lancashire coalfield .
This has probably caused the extinction 
of two or three rare plants which will be mentioned later.
The river Calder, especially if we consider the Hebden and 
Gorple to be the main source above Hebden Bridge, 
instead of the stream passing through 
Consequent Todmorden, flows in the direction of the dip,

being consequent upon the uplift of the strata.
It has carved out its valley by erosion, aided by 
the weathering of the sides, so that above Hebden Bridge it has 
cut into and exposed the Yoredale rocks underlying the rocks at 
the surface.
Its fall from Todmorden to Brighouse is tolerably 
uniform, and equal to not more than twelve feet per mile.
This, 
of course, is very much less than the actual dip of the rocks, so 
that as it flows east it successively passes over the newer rocks.
At any point in its valley, however, the strata on either side 
are identical, the cross section being symmetrical.
Some of the tributaries of the Calder have the same 
characters, flowing in the direction of the dip.
This is notably 
the case with the Red Beck in Shibden, though its course is 
more southerly, as is the dip there.
The upper courses of the 
Ryburn, the middle portions of Luddenden Brook and of the 
Hebble flow eastwards along the dip.
But in most cases the tributaries run at right angles to the 
main stream, originating subsequently along the strike of the 
strata.
It follows therefore that a cross section

on the western side, possessing a gentle slope,

This is best seen in the 
Xll. THE FLORA OF HALIFAX.
Hebble valley at Halifax, where the grit rock forming the slope 
from King Cross to the brook then passes out of sight under 
the steep face of the coal measures of which Beacon Hill is 
composed.
The rocks all belong to the Carboniferous system, and are 
classified as Yoredale Rocks, Millstone Grits and Lower Coal 
Measures.
The Yoredale beds composed of 
Yoredale sandstones and shales, with thin bands of

impure limestone, occupy the Calder valley 
from Todmorden to beyondHebden Bridge, and 
the lower portions of Colden Clough, Hardcastle Crags, and 
Crimsworth Dean.
They only rise above the valley from 
Todmorden to Eastwood, where they stretch across from 
Bridestones Moor to Langfield Edge, and then with a slight 
interruption, round the head of Withens Clough ; there is also 
a small outcrop in the depression at Gorple.
The only 
noticeable effect of the presence of these beds on the flora is on 
Langfield Moor, where, over the shales of which they are 
largely composed, heather and the heaths are entirely absent.
The crumbling shales in the cloughs also favour the moisture- 
loving species ; but it is very questionable whether there is 
sufficient calcareous soil below Heptonstall Eaves to connect 
with it the presence of Melica nutans, which used to grow 
there.
The rest of the parish, west of Ogden, Halifax and 
Stainland is composed entirely of the successive beds of Mill- 
stone Grit.
The lowest of these, the Kinder- 
Millstone scout Grit, forms the western escarpment and

caps the moors to Hebden Bridge.
The crags 
on the edge of the moors at Widdop, Gorple 
Stones, Bride Stones, Chiseley Stones and Heptonstall Eaves 
are of this coarse grit rock, and have been the only localities 
where the rare bearberry, Arctostaphylos Uva-ursi, has been 
found.
Midgley, Warley, Sowerby and Soyland moors are com- 
posed of the beds classed as Middle Grits, mainly sandstones, 
with shales and small bands of coal, fine clay and galliard 
appearing at the outcrop in the valleys.
Hathershelf Scout is 
the only prominent scar.
Eastwards the Middle Grits are 
succeeded by the uppermost bed, the Rough Rock, forming the 
slopes of Halifax, Norland and Greetland Moor, and Ovenden 
Township.

along the Ogden and Hebble streams to Elland, 
and by the Ainleys to Stainland in the south.
As these measures are capped by the sandstone known as 
Elland Flag, they produce but little botanical difference, though 
the shales are somewhat prominent on the valley slopes, as in 
Shibden, Sun Wood and Elland Park Wood.
The entire absence of igneous, slate or limestone rocks in 
the area at once limits the number of plants, and simplifies any 
examination of their distribution.
As far as the rocks themselves 
have any influence, there is hardly anything to prevent a species 
from occurring in one part of the parish rather than another.
As will be shown later the altitude has much greater effect.
The 
grit rock is absorbent and porous but retains moisture.
The 
shales and clays are impervious and wet ; so that the whole 
flora is composed of moisture-loving plants, or such as are in- 
different.
This is exemplified in the wealth of ferns and 
mosses in the cloughs ; but at present the environment of the 
plants, rather than the flora itself is under consideration.
The soils, naturally therefore, do not offer greater variety 
than the rocks.
The prevailing type is a dark, sandy, heavy 
soil, always shallow, and holding a large amount

of moisture.
Over the shales, chiefly on the 
Yoredale and Coal Measures, it becomes more 
argillaceous, and therefore wetter and colder, but the shales 
are more friable than clay, and there is very little stiff clay 
soil.
There is also only a small extent of alluvial soil : small 
tracts of holme land occur near Mytholmroyd and Copley, but 
the river only forms a flat valley bottom of any width in the 
last mile or two between Elland and Brighouse, sufficient to 
admit of a couple of crooks in its course.
A light porous, sandy 
soil is formed in small patches near the moors, or in the neigh- 
bourhood of bare ground where the rain w r ashes together the 
particles of sand crumbling from the exposed faces of rock.
There remains the peat, which attains its highest development 
over grit rock, so much so that it is almost restricted to this 
formation.
Hence a large portion of the parish is covered with 
peat to a varying depth.
As deficient in organic constituents

hills lack ruggedness of outline and contour.
'I' hey form gentle shelving slopes, often des- 
cending in terraces, 'caused by the alternation of sandstone and 
shale.
The streams, at first, only make a gentle depression in 
the contour : so long as they remain on the moors the valleys 
are not cut deep, though the gradient may be considerable ; 
but when the stream has descended to about 1,000 or 8ooft., the 
valley alters in character and becomes what is called a clough, 
or, less frequently, a dean.
The stream is here cutting down 
through the strata, which hem it in on both sides, so that it 
has the appearance of having cleft the rocks.
This portion of 
the valley is generally densely wooded, the woods clothing the 
steep sides, but stopping short above where they take a more 
gentle slope, occupied by pastures and farms up to the moor 
edge.
From 500 feet downwards the gradient becomes less and 
the valley broadens out somewhat, and admits of a hamlet or 
village, though it hardly loses its clough-like character, as the 
moors follow it in parallel lines to the main valley.
There is 
no case of a tributary entering the Calder above its level and 
so forming a cascade, nor are there any noticeable waterfalls 
except at Walshaw, and Lumb Fall in Crimsworth Dean, 
where the stream first meets the Yoredale rocks.
Though the 
western doughs have been mainly considered so far, the 
general features of Cragg Vale, Ryburn valley, Blackburn 
valley, Luckkiulen Dean and the Hebble valley are similar.
But tin- valley of the Red Beck flowing through Shibden to 
Brookfoot, and of Clifton Beck, both on the Coal Measures, 
are not so steep and narrow, on account of the more rapid 
weathering of the softer rocks out of which they are carved.
There is no natural sheet of water in the parish, and hardly 
a pond, so that beyond the streams and moorland bogs, the 
botanist is dependent upon artificial habitats

for the occurrence of aquatic plants.
Of these 
there are three : reservoirs, mill-dams and the 
canal.
The reservoirs are numerous, but being kept clear of 
vegetation, they are of no importance botanically, except in so

far as their presence is affecting the drainage of the moors.
But the mill-dams in the valleys, below 500 feet, as at Rish- 
worth, Luddenden Foot, Barkisland and West Vale, shelter a 
group of aquatic plants which are found solely in them and the 
canal.
The latter, in spite of its dirty state, is even more 
productive.
The aquatic reeds, grasses and pond weeds, which 
flourish in stagnant or slowly moving water, are chiefly found 
in the reach of the Calder and Hebble Navigation, from 
Halifax to Salterhebble Docks, and Elland Park Wood ; in 
Tag Lock, which is an abandoned portion between Elland and 
Rastrick now stocked with fish ; and in the old cut at Norland, 
which was intended to be the course of the canal, but was 
abandoned for the present route, and now ends in the mill-dam 
at the stearine works.
The banks of the Rochdale Canal from 
SoWerby Bridge to Todmorden are lined with similar vegeta- 
tion.
In view of the recent arrival and restricted area of this 
class of aquatics, it is worth while to record that the act to 
extend the navigation of the Calder to Salterhebble and 
Sowerby Bridge was obtained in 1758 ; the Rochdale Canal to 
Sowerby Bridge was opened in 1798, and the extension of the 
Calder and Hebble Navigation from Salterhebble Bridge to 
Bailey Hall, near to the town of Halifax was completed in 
1828.
Though both Bolton in 1775, Leyland in 1830, and 
other botanists record species from the canal at Salterhebble, 
the number now found, and entered in the present work, is much 
larger.
Their names are given in the next chapter, where 
aquatic plants are considered.
Though it is difficult to present any tangible facts, it is quite 
evident that the surface of the land, and consequently the flora, 
is undergoing a gradual change, owing to the 
Moors.
operations of man, quite apart from the growth 
of the towns.
The remains of tree trunks and 
roots imbedded in the peat point to the conclusion that at some 
remote period, what is now moorland was once woodland.
But coming to more recent times, it is clear that the moors are 
not now so extensive as they were.
At present, almost all the 
the surface above a thousand feet, probably a third of the 
whole area, is moorland.
But around Halifax former moor- 
land has been drained and enclosed.
Swales Moor, Illingworth 
Moor, Highroad Well Moor, Skircoat Moor are now only 
names, and the last has become Savile Park.
Greenwood's 
map of Yorkshire, 1817, shows a Forest Dean Moor in the 
Blackburn Valley, south of Stainland between Firth House and

THE FLORA OF HALIFAX.
Outlane.
This has all been brought under cultivation, except a 
patch of Outlane Moor, and with it has gone Anagallis tenella, 
the Bog Pimpernel, which grew in Stainland Dean from 1775 
to 1820, or somewhat later.
But all the moors west of the 
Hebble and Ryburn brooks are now preserved for grouse, and 
it is extremely probable that the practice of firing the moors 
periodically to encourage the growth of fresh shoots of heather 
and bilberry must have a detrimental influence on rarer plants 
associated with them.
The club mosses have certainly dimin- 
ished, and probably the lesser tway-blade, owing to this 
cultivation of heather.
But the presence of reservoirs is prob- 
ably the cause of the disappearance of those that affect boggy 
ground, for the reservoirs have certainly improved the drainage 
of the moors.
The land under cultivation is almost entirely pasture and 
meadow.
Hardly any arable land is seen, except in the 
neighbourhood of Copley, West Vale, Elland 
Cultivated and Lightcliffe, where barley, oats and roots

are grown to a small extent ; so the corn-field 
weeds take a very small place in the flora.
The 
farms are small, and mainly dairy for the supply of the towns.
In 
the neighbourhood of Queensbury and Swill Hill they ascend 
to 1 100 and even 1200 feet, but elsewhere not higher than 1000 
feet.
The pastures on these moorland farms are very rough, but 
productive of a considerable number of plants, which are driven 
out of the richer fields in the valleys.
The fields are invariably 
divided by dry stone walls, in place of hedgerows.
Park land only figures to a very small extent, chiefly in the 
neighbourhood of Lightcliffe (Crow Nest), Fixby, Skircoat to 
Warley Town (Pye Nest and Willow Hall), Sowerby (Brock- 
well) and Barkisland.
The woods are numerous, but somewhat small.
Every 
valley contains some, bordering the stream or on the steeper 
slopes, and the western valleys around Hebden 
Woods.
Bridge are richly wooded.
In almost every 
case these woods appear to be the much 
reduced remnants of the original forest that occupied the 
valleys, perhaps six or eight hundred years ago.
Looking 
down the length of the Calder valley, we find narrow strips of 
wood appearing on one or other side, and frequently on both 
together, on the steep slopes, all the way from Calder Head to 
Brighouse.
Their distance from the river increases as we de- 
scend, and the valley broadens, but their situation is invariable.

The only interruption is between Luddenden Foot and Norland, 
where the valley slopes are largely occupied by Sowerby 
Bridge, and Allen Wood formerly occupied the site of the 
station there.
Whilst the valley bottom has long ago been 
deforested, these woods have been retained because their sites 
were worthless for any other purpose, as will be recognised by 
anyone familiar with Long Wood or Woodhouse Scar in 
Skircoat, North Dean Wood, or Hathershelf Scout Wood.
Further, the numerous " royds " of the parish are almost all 
situated on these same hill slopes, and are the places where the 
ground was cleared to make a habitation ; and frequently the 
woods still remain surrounding the clearance, or royd as at 
Akroyd, Mayroyd, Fallingroyd, Binnroyd, &c.
Other ancient 
place-names like Woodhouse and Shaw originate in the ad 
joining woods, and the Calder itself is the " wooded water." 
The soil is too shallow and the ground too rocky to admit 
of a valuable growth of timber.
The trees that attain the 
greatest dimensions appear to be the beech, ash and sycamore.
The oak is very common in many woods, as North Dean and 
Elland Park, and though, perhaps, it offers the most prolonged 
resistance to unfavourable circumstances, it nowhere reaches a 
great size.
Birch woods may be found in Luddenden Dean 
and Broadhead Clough, near Mytholmroyd; and pines and 
firs have been planted freely in the Hebden valley and Crims- 
worth Dean.
It would seem, from the absence of early 
botanical records from them, that the woods around Hardcastle 
Crags were not formerly as accessible to the public as they 
are to-day.
For not only does the parish possess, for a thickly 
populated manufacturing district, an unusual wealth of wood- 
land scenery, but the public are free to enter almost all the 
woods, and facilities are generally granted on application in the 
few cases where there is no right of way.

parish introduce local modifications, chiefly in 
the form of a lower average temperature and 
a greater rainfall.

Those of earlier

Well Head during the years [866 to [873 inclusive," by John

The later read- 
ings are by Mr. J.
Whiteley, the librarian at Belle Vue, where 
the corporation has maintained a meteorological station since 
1892.
As in neither case have the observations been continued 
for a sufficiently long period to arrive at a true average, it is 
desirable to make use of both ; and as the stations differ some- 
what in altitude, and yield different averages, it is undesirable 
to combine the readings.

The yearly average for places in Yorkshire near the sea level 
is 48 or 4.8 .5, and the local observations are in close accord- 
ance with the generally accepted conclusion of Dalton, that the 
mean temperature falls one degree for every hundred yards 
ascent above sea-level.
As the elevation of the parish ranges 
from 200 ft.
to 1500 ft., there is probably a difference of five 
degrees in the mean temperature of the valley bottom and the 
moors.
If records were available they would probably show 
THE PARISH OF HALIFAX.

a greater difference, for the narrow valleys and cloughs are 
sheltered, often wooded, and may be inclined to the south, and 
so gain a distinct advantage by receiving the sun's rays at a less 
inclination.
On the other hand, the moors are exposed to the 
full sweep of the wind, and their slope is almost horizontal.
There is, therefore, no cause for wonder that the vegetation in 
Elland Park Wood, which combines a south aspect with a low 
altitude, is always considerably in advance of that of other and 
less favoured parts of the parish.
But more than this, the 
variation of five degrees is quite sufficient to produce an entire 
transformation of the flora : the plants that can maintain a 
footing at the higher elevations are not only much fewer in 
number but are almost all different species from those at low 
levels.
A change of altitude affects both the mean temperature 
and the flora much more rapidly than does a change of latitude.
Hence the parish possesses, thinly scattered on the highest 
moors, a few plants, like Trientalis and Rubus Chamaemovus, 
which the botanist will find in great profusion at low levels in 
Norway.
The rainfall is more variable, both from year to year and 
place to place, but its chief characteristic is its high average, 
owing to the elevation of the parish.
The 
Rainfall.
annual fall at Halifax exceeds that at Wake- 
field or Leeds by about ten inches, but is less, 
by fifteen inches, than the fall on the high moorlands of the 
parish.
Combined with the nature of the soil, and the 
relatively high humidity of the air, this leads to a prevalence of 
moisture-loving plants in the flora, such as the sedges, ferns, 
and mosses ; although it should not be overlooked that though 
the moorland plants may be alomst water-logged for consider- 
able periods of the year, they have in the summer to withstand a 
much severer drought than other plants which are less exposed 
to the sun and wind.
The ease with which a moor is fired is 
an obvious consequence and demonstration of this fact.
The details in the table below, derived from the same 
sources as the previous one, illustrate the distribution of the 
rainfall throughout the year.
The Well Head readings extend 
over a period of forty-five years, a sufficient period to afford a 
reliable average.
From these it is clearly shown that the 
spring months (February to May) are the driest, whilst the 
rest show but little difference from each other, except October, 
which is decidedly the wettest month of the year.

As elsewhere, the prevailing winds throughout the year come 
from the south-west and west ; but the smaller rainfall of April 
and May is caused by the prevalence of north-east and east 
winds.
This is especially the case in May, which is the only 
month when the wind is more frequently in the east than in 
the west, hence the vegetation is frequently retarded and the 
foliage liable to be damaged.

Lying on the millstone grit rocks which intervene between 
the coal fields of the West Riding and South Lancashire, the 
parish of Halifax does not possess the density 
Population.
of population of either area.
The western 
townships (except near Todmorden) are very 
thinly populated, but the central valley is occupied by a success- 
ion of boroughs, towns and overgrown manufacturing villages.
It seems but a question of time for the main road traversing it 
to become a continous street, lined with buildings.
The mills 
and hamlets have also followed the courses of the tributaries of 
the Calder, and one in particular, the Hebble, has become almost 
wholly urban in character.
The population of the whole parish 
is approximately a quarter of a million, of which the Borough of 
Halifax claims a hundred thousand.
This has its effect on the 
Flora, mainly in the direction of extermination, but to a less 
extent in the introduction of alien and casual plants.
The 
seeds of these are brought in wool, corn and other merchandise, 
and plants alien to the British Flora spring up on the refuse 
and tippings in the neighbourhood of mills, malt kilns, corn 
mills, &c.
In very few cases, perhaps in none, do these aliens 
naturalise themselves and become permanent, just as very 
few garden plants are able to hold their own in competition 
with the indigenous flora.
Similar plants may originate in the 
goods' yards at the railway stations, and may flourish for a few 
years on the railway banks.
An embankment not only furn- 
ishes an interesting object lesson in the succession of plants 
that occupy it for some years after it has been made, but also 
offers a permanent home of a peculiar character, exactly 
adapted to the requirements of those that eventually win the 
day.
So it both shelters a few plants that are rare elsewhere, 
and allows others to spread in continuous sheets in a manner 
they cannot do off it.
In the same way certain native plants 
grow rampant about the ruins of disused mills in the cloughs.
CHAPTER II.
Plant Distribution and Associations.
5EFORE passing to the consideration of the distribution 
of plants within the limits of the parish, it is desirable to 
enquire shortly where they come from, and to show that they 
have not all the same history, nor geographical range.
To 
begin with, all our native plants occur not only elsewhere in 
England, but also on the continent; and it is from Europe, 
almost exclusively, that this country has received both its flora 
and fauna by successive immigrations, which, however, have 
not necessarily originated in the same quarter.
Every species 
occupies a definite area, which may be almost world-wide, or 
may be a single small island.
It may at any time be gradually 
gaining or losing ground ; and it is usually most abundant at 
the centre, and diminishes towards the boundaries of this area.
These plant areas overlap without coinciding, and produce 
endless combinations of species from place to place, the kaleido- 
scopic effect of which, in any district, is reflected in its local 
Flora ; but it is also the function of such a work to analyse the 
elements of the picture, and determine the local combina- 
tions.
On examining the range of our plants outside Britain, it is 
possible to discover wide differences in the areas they 
occupy, and to group together plants of similar 
Continental range, whereby they are reduced to a small 
Range.
number of classes, the members of each class 
having, undoubtedly, had a somewhat similar 
history and origin.
The classes here adopted as the most 
convenient are as follows : â€” 
(i.) Cosmopolitan species, which are found nearly all over 
the world, or at least, in all the continents.
It is a very small 
class, of which the dandelion, yarrow, silver-weed, bracken, 
convolvulus and duck- weed will serve as examples.
In part it

is composed of weeds, like the dandelion and chickweed, which 
have followed in the track of civilisation ; but if the review is 
limited to temperate regions, a considerable number of aquatic 
plants should also be added, for these are, undoubtedly, the 
most cosmopolitan in their nature, owing to their environment 
being the least affected by climate.
On comparing the flowering 
plants of Halifax with those of Minnesota, U.S.A., not more 
than sixty or seventy are common to the two floras, and of 
these more than half are aquatic plants, or hydrophytes, a pro- 
portion which is greatly in excess of their relative numbers in 
either flora.
(2.) Germanic, or Asiatic species.
The general British 
Flora, embracing a majority of the whole, ranges more or less 
over Europe and Asia, and to a less extent northern Africa.
Such plants have arrived here at different times, and by differ- 
ent routes, from the east, but this western migration originated 
not in Germany, as the older name seems to imply, but in 
western Asia.
The following cases will illustrate the varied 
regions now occupied by members of this family, of which the 
cosmopolitan species are also really members, with an excep- 
tionally wide distribution.
The Lesser Celandine is found 
throughout Europe and western x\sia ; Ivy in western and 
southern Europe, northern Africa, western Asia and Japan ; 
Primrose in south and central Europe and northern Africa, 
but is absent in north-eastern Europe and Siberia ; Heather 
(Galium) in northern and central Europe, western Siberia, 
Azores, Greenland, and very rarely in north-eastern America.
(3.) Western and Atlantic species, Our two heaths, 
however, have a much more restricted range than the heather, 
and whatever their past history has been, they are now limited 
to western Europe, attaining their maximum development 
along the Atlantic coast.
Other British heaths are found only 
in the south-west of England and in Ireland, and in the south- 
west of Europe.
Though these are not present in this district, 
a few members of this very remarkable group are* notably the 
filmy fern (now in all probability extinct) ; the ivy-leaved hair 
bell (Wahlenbergia) ; the blue-bell, the earthnut, and the 
autumn Crocus, though its origin in England is problematical.
Some of these certainly belong to a type which has reached 
the British Isles from the south, viz.
the Iberian peninsula ; 
and they exhibit such a preference for the Atlantic border, 
that they are much more strongly developed in Ireland, and do 
not occur in the east of England at all.
XXIV THE FLORA OF HALIFAX.
(4.) Arctic and Alpine species.
On the contrary, about 
thirty-five plants of the parish have reached it from the north.
Without entering into the the exact distinction between arctic 
and alpine plants, or their relation to the glacial epoch, it is 
sufficiently clear that all such plants in Britain have originated 
in a migration from Scandinavia, and as.
such species exist only 
at higher levels in more southern latitudes, they are commonly 
known as alpine or sub-alpine plants.
The presence of these 
here is the chief positive difference between the Halifax Flora 
and that of the south of England.
A few of them, as the bird- 
cherry, crowberry (Empetvum), cowberry (V.
Viiis-Idcea), 
wood stitchwort and Crepis paludosa, are not uncommon in the 
parish ; but others are the rarest gems of the flora, and attract- 
ed the attention of the earliest botanists.
The bearberry 
(Arctostaphylos Uva-ursi), was first discovered in Britain in 1666 
on Heptonstall Moor ; the cloudberry is only found here above 
1500 feet, and only extends further south to the Peak and the 
Welsh mountains in Britain, and northern Germany in 
Europe ; Trientalis is not found in Britain, south of Halifax.
These four classes serve to indicate the relationship of 
British plants to those of other parts of the world.
But w T hen 
we come to enquire to what extent the plants 
Range in of a particular locality are correlated with the 
Britain.
flora of all Britain, a somewhat different 
system is more convenient, and the classifica- 
tion proposed by H.
C. Watson, which has become generally 
accepted, has been adopted in the body of the Flora.
Wat- 
son's names indicate in which part of the country each species 
is most prevalent.
Plants that are found throughout the 
length and breadth of Britain are said to belong to the ' British 
type ' ; those which are most abundant in the south of England, 
and which become scarce, or are absent north of the Midlands, 
are of the ' English type'.
Plants of the ' Intermediate type ' 
are mainly confined to the north of England ; ' Scottish ' plants 
have their headquarters in North Britain, and the ' Highland 
type ' in the Highlands of Scotland.
The k Atlantic type ' shows 
a marked preference for the western coast of Britain, and the 
' Germanic type ' is found in the eastern counties of England ; 
whilst a few species are too local to classify otherwise.
Wat- 
son's Scottish and Highland plants correspond to the Arctic 
species of the previous classification ; the Atlantic are common 
to both ; but not only the Watsonian ' Germanic ' type, but the 
British and English are Asiatic in origin.
PLANT DISTRIBUTION AND ASSOCIATIONS.

In ascertaining to what extent each of these types is repre- 
sented in the Halifax Flora, it is undesirable to deal with the 
whole body of plants enumerated for the parish, 
Halifax but to attempt to eliminate erroneous and 
Flora.
doubtful records, alien and casual plants, and 
various others, by which process the list is 
reduced from some 760 species to about 560, the difference 
being mainly due to plants which are only of casual occurrence 
in this district, though most of them are more truly native 
elsewhere in England.
The residue represents much more 
truly the proper flora of the parish, though in addition to 
native plants, it includes denizens and colonists, as well as a 
small number, possibly or certainly, now extinct.
The follow- 
ing table presents a summary of this reduced flora, analysed 
according to Watson's classification, and compared with that of 
Great Britain.
The numbers make no claim to exactitude ; 
there are too many dubious points to admit of a rigid compari- 
son, but without laying too great a stress on the precise figures 
arrived at, the conclusions to be drawn from them are 
unaffected thereby, and are of considerable importance.

* According to J.
G. Baker in " Flora of the English Lake District." 
This analysis shows us that the Halifax flora contains four- 
fifths of the plants of British type, that are found generally 
distributed in Britain in suitable localities, and this class is so 
dominant as to form three-quarters of the local flora.
On the 
other hand, only one-fifth of the plants of English type are 
found here, and though they numerically rank second, it is 
longo intervallo, and they are relatively not so well represented 
as the Scottish plants.
The weakness of the English type is 
XX vi.
THE FLORA OF HALIFAX.
due much more to the elevation of the parish, rather than to its 
latitude, and many of this type are confined here to the lowest 
part of the parish, as is shown later.
Nor is the tenure of a 
considerable proportion of them secure, even there.
For not 
only are they liable to be disturbed by the growth of the towns, 
but many of them, the weeds of cultivated and waste ground, 
are sometimes hardly to be distinguished from casual introduc- 
tions.
This is borne out by the fact that the list of casuals, so 
far excluded from consideration, is exceptionally rich in plants 
of English type, the aggregate being half as large again as the 
number admitted into the table.
The plants of Scottish type rank third in number, but 
occupy a much more important position than in the flora of 
Britain as a whole.
Excluding from consideration such High- 
land plants as are confined to the lofty mountains of Scotland, 
the flora of Halifax, in the relative strength of species of 
Intermediate, Scottish and Highland type, shows a much 
greater resemblance to that of North Britain than of the South 
of England.
This might be expected from the situation of the 
parish on a chain of hills, practically continuous into Scotland, 
but disappearing southwards in Derbyshire.
The Germanic type may be said to be conspicuous by its 
absence, though casuals of this type are sometimes introduced 
with grain.
But the moist, sheltered doughs in the western 
part of the parish are certainly suitable habitats for plants of 
the Atlantic type, as shown by the presence of Cotyledon (per- 
haps introduced), Hymenophyllum (extinct), and Wahlenbergia, 
and emphasised by the discovery, by Mr. Needham in 1896, of 
a typical Atlantic-type hepatic, Jubala Hutchinsice, near Hard- 
castle Crags.
The last deduction to be drawn from this analysis of the 
types of plants represented here, and it is only derived from an 
examination of the individuals composing the classes, is that 
whatever plants have become, or are in danger of becoming, 
extinct, do not belong to the British type, but rather to the 
others.
This is perhaps due to the fact that the plants of the 
other types are frequently not present in large numbers individ- 
ually, though of course, in many cases they are abundant 
enough.
And though some of these rarest ones still grow in 
the exact localities from which they were first recorded, such 
changes as have taken place are in the direction of the diminu- 
tion of every one of the other types, (unless it be the Interme- 
diate,) and the supremacy of the British type.
PLANT DISTRIBUTION AND ASSOCIATIONS.
XXV11.
Having now sketched the external relationships of the 
plants of the parish, it remains to consider their internal dis- 
tribution and to distinguish the plant societies 
Lowland which are most characteristic of the district.
Division.
It has already been stated that altitude is the 
most important factor in the problem, and the 
500 feet contour line, perhaps, makes the most natural division 
between the lowland area in the east of the parish and the 
much more extensive upland area.
Though it is not conveni- 
ent to adhere closely to this division, its existence cannot fail 
to strike anyone who is familar with the flora of the parish.
The lowland division can claim three plant societies, which, as 
such are entirely absent in the higher area, though a few of the 
individuals may rise above 500 feet.
These are the still- water 
aquatic plants : the colonists, denizens and casuals of arable 
and waste ground, which include most of the species of annual 
duration only ; and a group of woodland and hedgerow plants, 
viz.
: Ranunculus auricomus, Sisymbrium A Maria, Acer campestre, 
Rosa arvensis, Galium Cruciata, Convolvulus sepium, Solarium Dulc- 
amara, Linaria vulgaris, Siachys Betonica, Lamium Galeobdolon, 
Tamus communis, Arum maculatum and Carex pendula.
The plant 
associations of the woods and cloughs are so interwoven, that 
it will be better to put them by themselves, especially so, as 
they form the transition from the lowlands to the uplands, and 
appertain to both, and lead us naturally to the flora of the hill- 
side pasture, and to the various types of moorland.
The mill-dams and the canal (including Tag Lock and the 
Old Cut at Norland) are the only stagnant, or slowly-moving 
waters in the parish, in which all the principal

Using 
the word ' pond ' for these areas as it suggests 
the exact conditions that prevail, the pond vegetation forms a 
number of communities, distributed in irregular zones in ref-

Proceeding from the deeper water to the 
edge we meet in turn : 
A. â€” Free Floating Plants.
In addition to the Algae and 
Desmids, which are excluded from our enquiry, the only 
phanerogam that maintains itself without any attachment to 
the soil, and is a prominent feature in the " pond," is the duck- 
weed, Lemna minor ; but L.

occur in the canal at Salterhebble.

These are rooted to 
the bottom of the pond, often in deep water, and grow up to 
the surface, but hardly rise above it.
All the species enumer- 
ated are in the canal between Halifax and Salterhebble ; the 
Canadian pond weed and one or two species of Potamogeton are 
found in the other localities, but the water starwort has a very 
much wider range as a mud or swamp plant.

Considerable areas of

The arrowhead, Sagittar a sagittifolia, 
is found in the canal.
But the floating grass, Glyccvia fluitans, 
though it has its place in this group, differs in being more 
widely diffused, and in being more characteristic of the margin.

depth of water may vary considerably from time to time, occur 
a number of tall, reed-like, or strap-shaped plants.
Their 
social character is strongly marked, owing to their creeping 
root-stocks, and from the same cause they fringe the shore, and 
by retaining the mud, they largely contribute to the silting up 
of the " pond," and, at the same time, push out further into it.
By no means all of them grow together in the same locality : 
in one dam it may be bur- reed and flag; in another, reedmace 
and water plantain ; or a fringe of tall grasses along the canal 
bank ; but each in its turn occupies the position characteristic 
of the group, the members of which are : 
Iris Pseudacorus, Acorns Calamus, 
Typha latifolia, Alisma Plautago, 
Spavganium vamosum, Phalaris arundiuacca, 
S. simplex, Glyccvia aquatica.
E. â€” Marginal Plants.
There are several points of 
interest in connection with all the preceding hydrophytes.
The hrst is that, with a few exceptions, they have entered into 
the flora of the parish only since the making of the canal, as 
mentioned on p.
xv.
Nor do they appear to have displaced 
other water-loving species.
The only such that have become 
extinct are Hippuvis vulgaris and Typha angustifolia.
Further,

But on the margin of these " ponds," on the land side of the 
reed-swamp, in the wet places between it and the rising bank, 
is a society nf moisture-loving plants which are by no means 
exclusively confined to this particular habitat, but are many of 
them found in the cloughs and elsewhere.
However, those

When 
due allowance has been made for these influences, though, 
perhaps, fifty colonists might pass muster, very few of them 
are of frequent occurrence.
Amongst them should be placed

banks deserves more lengthy notice.
The 
older embankments, on w T hich by the lapse of 
years the vegetation has reached a stage of equilibrium, present 
an aspect tolerably like that of the surrounding country.
They 
differ chiefly in the obtrusive abundance of the dominant species.
Whilst an old, undisturbed pasture is distinguished by the 
variety and number of its species, the older embankment 
exhibits the supremacy of a few, which differ entirely from 
those present at an earlier stage in its history.
The grasses of 
the older banks are mainly Deschampsia flexuosa and Holcus mollis, 
and the Hawkweed Hieracium boveale is particularly abundant.
Willow, broom, brambles, wood-sage and Heracleum are con- 
spicuous, and a number of other species contribute in a less 
degree.
Two concrete examples will illustrate the history of 
the earlier stages.
The first, the embankment adjoining Wyke 
Station, which w 7 as examined by Mr. C.
E. Moss this 
summer (1900), has evidently been made a number of years, 
but has not quite attained the last stage described above, beyond 
which there is, as yet, no progress.
The second, a level stretch of 
newly made embankment mostly formed within the last year or 
two for sidings at Hipperholme station, was gone over by the two 
of us jointly.
At Wyke thirty species were noticed.
In the 
following list of them, those that also occured at Hipperholme 
are distinguished by an asterisk.

The larger and newer embankment at Hipperholme yielded 
seventy species, only one or two of which were aliens.
The 
most abundant were Linana vulgaris and Matricaria inodora ; 
Hieracium vulgatum and Chrysanthemum Leucanthemum were most 
conspicuous on the slopes and older ground ; Leontodon autum- 
nalis, Tussilago, and Polygonum Persicaria were also well to the 
front.
It is certain that at least five of these species will never 
maintain their dominant position after a year or two.
The second group, of plants present in fair quantity well 
distributed, was made up of eight common grasses, three 
clovers, two chick weeds, groundsel, Rumex Acetosella, Plantago

Heracleum, Plantago major, Capsclla, Ranunculus acris, Teucvium 
Scorodonia (on the older ground only), Hieracium boreale, Poly- 
uum lapatlufolium, and Cnicus lanceolatus formed the third group 
of plants not generally distributed.
The plants of the fourth group, of which either only one or 
very few individuals w r ere noted, included a young willow

Festuca rigida and Eqaisetum arvense.
The number of species, the character of the dominant ones, 
the subordinate position of the grasses, though over a dozen 
were present, all illustrate the immaturity of the flora of this 
railway bank.
A few seedlings of willow and a small specimen 
of furze were the only representatives of shrubby vegetation, 
but there were brambles, with bracken, at the foot of the slope.

ation of it is better postponed for the present.
But as there is very little meadow land above 900 feet, it is 
more appropriately included as a feature of the lowland area.
The commonest and most abundant grasses met with in 
these " mow r ing fields " are : â€” 
Anthoxanlhum odoratum (Sweet Vernal), Poa pratensis, 
Alopecurus pratcusis (Foxtail), Festuca duriuscula, 
( ynosnrns cristatus (Dogstail), Bromus mollis,

borders, and couch grass is more frequent than it should be.
The herbage of any meadow is sure to be made up of at 
least a dozen species in addition to the grasses.

Ranunculus acris (Buttercup), Bellis perennis (Daisy), 
Anthriscus sylvestris, Taraxacum (Dandelion),

hardly be considered apart from the other.
If the woods are first examined by themselves, 
the remaining plant associations of the cloughs will naturally 
follow and lead up to the moors.
Though the oak is the chief 
factor in the composition of nearly all our woods, there are two 
distinct types to be distinguished, each of which is usually seen 
in the' ascent of a clough.
(i) Mixed Deciduous Woods occupy the lower and moister 
situations, and are characterised by the presence of a great 
variety both of trees, underwood, and herbaceous vegetation.
Beech woods may be considered a variety of this type.
(ii) Dry Oak Woods occupy more elevated, rocky ground, 
and are characterised by the absence of other forest trees, and 
the dominance of bilberry, heather, bracken, and moorland 
grasses.
The Birch is always present and sometimes takes the 
lead, so that the Oak Wood may pass into a Birch Wood.
Coniferous Woods, in which Scots Pine, Austrian Pine, Larchj 
&c, are planted either by themselves, or mixed with oak, are 
here hardly more than a variety of this type, as the other con- 
ditions are all very similar.
The oak wood in a damp situation admits so varied a flora, 
that it is better to confine the name oak wood to dry wood 
where the oak is much more predominant, and 
Mixed to call the type under consideration now either 
Deciduous a mixed deciduous wood, or a damp wood.
Woods.
Elland Park Wood and Sun Wood may be 
taken as examples of this type, but even in their 
case, the transition to the dry oak wood in the upper part may 
be observed; a change which is of frequent occurrence in the 
wooded cloughs in passing from the bottom to the head of the 
clough, or up its slopes.
XXXIV.
THE FLORA OF HALIFAX.
The damp wood is characterised not only by the large 
number of species present, but also equally well by the com- 
plete absence of heather and the subordinate position of bilberry 
The timber is varied, largely of course from purely artificial 
causes, and being but thinly planted it admits of a consider- 
able and varied undergrowth of brushwood, and beneath this 
again a rich assembly of herbaceous plants and carpet vegeta- 
tion.
The oak is the most abundant tree, and often exceeds in 
number all the others ; the sycamore is second, and is followed 
by the wych-elm.
The other forest-trees, ash, beech, birch 
are relatively subordinate.
Of the smaller trees and bushes 
holly, hawthorn, elder, hazel, willow and mountain ash are all 
of frequent occurrence, and guelder-rose, maple, cherry (various 
species) and crab apple are thinly scattered.
The most abun- 
dant of the smaller shrubs are the bramble, honeysuckle, ivy 
and roses (especially R.
arvensis), with raspberry, sloe, bilberry, 
gorse and broom in less quantity.
The herbaceous vegetation comprises a number of social 
species, either carpeting the length and breadth of the wood, 
or forming smaller societies where the conditions are favourable ; 
and in addition, other species found rather as individuals than 
in societies.
The social species do not enter into excessive 
competition with one another, for though they occupy the same 
ground, their times of appearance are widely different.
The 
earliest in the procession accomplish their flowering before they 
are thrown into shade by the foliage overhead, owing to the 
reserve material stowed away in bulbs, tubers, rhizomes, etc.
Coltsfoot, butterbur, perennial mercury, lesser celandine, and 
wood anemone give place to the sheets of bluebells or wild 
hyacinths, which are accompanied by stitchwort, garlic, violet, 
Lychnis dioica, wood-rushes, etc.
In turn the bluebell disappears 
almost as completely as the lesser celandine or anemone, hidden 
in the extensive tracts of bracken â€” the most social of ferns â€” or 
beneath the still taller wood millet grass and Heracleum Sphon- 
dylium, or in the wildernesses of bramble and trailing rose.
The remaining flora of the mixed deciduous woods is given 
below in three lists.
The first completes the tale of such as 
are frequently met with, either as individuals or small societies, 
and it includes quite a number of shade-loving plants ; the 
second enumerates the rarer species, found either very sparingly 
or in but few localities ; and the third contains the marsh 
plants of the wood.
Some of these are to be found in marshy 
ground outside the woodland area, but an attempt has been

As the beech affords much greater shade than the oak, 
wherever a beech plantation is met with in the heart of a mixed 
wood, a corresponding effect may be noticed on 
Beech the vegetation beneath.
Not only is the corn- 
Woods, petition of the beeches sufficient to exclude 
other forest trees and shrubby undergrowth, 
but the herbaceous vegetation becomes much more limited.
The conditions are dense shade, except in the early spring, and 
a moist soil enriched with the humus of the decayed leaves.
If 
the trees are close set, hardly anything will be found beneath 
the carpet of withered leaves, except a few mosses.
Such an 
extreme case is not found here, but the small areas of beech 
wood in Sun Wood, North Dean Wood, or High Green Wood 
show the same principle.
Such shade-loving or early flowering 
plants as perennial mercury, wood-rufF, wood-sorrel, anemone, 
lesser celandine, and blue-bell are generally present, though in 
greatly reduced numbers ; moisture-loving plants like garlic, 
valerian, Luzula sylvatica and Stachys sylvatica, may be present.
Hevacleum Sphondylinm wins an entrance from the neighbouring 
wood but is only a shadow of its real self.
The common moss 
Milium hornum seems most at home of anything, and spreads 
very freely on the ground, the competition of other plants being 
so greatly reduced.
Of the grasses, Melica uniflora and Milium 
effusiim are both adapted to the shade, but if the wood is more 
open Holcus mollis gains a footing along with the common ferns, 
Lastvcea dilatata perhaps taking the lead.
The only shrubs 
present are ivy, raspberry and blackberry, the last of which is 
generally confined to the edges.
At the other extremity of the scale, there comes in the dry 
oak, or oak and birch, wood.
Situated on a rocky, dry, elevated 
slope, moisture is lacking, and there is much more light pene- 
trating through the thinner foliage.

or the upper part of Luddenden Dean, and many others are of 
this type, or, like Rough Hey Wood, Triangle, approach it more 
or less nearly.
Either the oak is the dominant tree, or the oak 
and birch almost equally numerous, or occasionally the birch 
is dominant, but no other deciduous trees are at all prominent.
The underwood is insignificant, holly, willow, mountain-ash, 
being the chief representatives.
Brambles aie prominent, and 
ivy, honeysuckle, dog rose, raspberry, and sloe frequently 
present, but the most important shrubs are bilberry and 
heather.
Bilberry almost always covers extensive areas, and 
often occupies the surface of the rocks, and heather is subord- 
inate ; but whenever the wood becomes more open their 
positions are reversed, so that on the edges and open banks 
heather is dominant.
But these two shrubs do not occupy the 
whole ground, they share it with bracken and with certain 
grasses, so that each in turn is dominant and excludes the 
others.
The grass which is most obtrusive is Deschampsia 
flexuosa, and associated with it are Festuca ovina, Navdus stvicta, 
and Agvostis vulgaris.
Often Holcus mollis forms an extensive 
stretch of itself.
Bracken is the only fern to occupy much 
ground, but lady-fern, male-fern and Lastvaa dilatata are by no 
means absent.
The bluebell nearly holds its own in these 
woods at times, but the other herbaceous plants are very much 
diminished in number and quantity.
The most characteristic 
are Pontentilla Tovmentilla, Galium saxatile and cow-wheat, 
Melampyvum pvatense.
Such composites as Solid ago Vivgauvea 
and HypochcBvis vadicata occur on open banks with hair bell, 
(Campanula votundi folia), and woodsage.
Cavex piliilifeva is the 
most frequent sedge, and a number of mosses are frequently 
met with.
The wintergreens, Pyvola media and minor also 
appear to belong to this association, but both are rare.
Occasionally the oak gives place to an almost pure growth 
of birch, which admits more light, and therefore gives greater 
encouragement to xerophilous societies like heather, bracken, 
&c.
But, naturally, whether it be oak or birch, the wood is 
sure to furnish marshy places, along the course of some small 
stream, where the moisture-loving species already mentioned 
will be found.
The woods above Hebden Bridge, where Scots Pine and 
Austian Pine, and to a smaller extent Larch and Spruce 
Fir have been planted, conform generally to the type of oak 
wood on a dry rocky slope, and what has been said of that 
type applies equally well to them, whether they are, as usual,

The mixed woods lie below 500 feet, and the dry oak 
woods generally run out below 800 or 900ft.
Any extension 
above them takes the form of an irregular line 
dough of trees and shrubs bordering the stream- 
Vegetation, course, or of scrub on the uncultivated rough 
slopes.
The most characteristic trees along 
the stream-banks are oak, mountain-ash, birch, and alder, 
with bushes of hawthorn, hazel, willow, holly, roses, and 
brambles.
Closely associated with them are the foxglove, 
hair-bell, wood-sage, the common ferns already named and 
also the hard-fern, Lomavia Spicant, the sweet mountain-fern, 
the rare bladder-fern, and other herbaceous plants mentioned 
below.
The rough, undrained slopes towards the clough head, 
ranging between 600 and 1,000ft.
furnish ground for a varied 
and rich flora, on account of their never being disturbed, so 
that moor and heath plants share the drier ground with the 
shrubs and dwarf trees that form a characteristic scrub, 
whilst the numerous rivulets form steep, dripping banks, or 
wide-spreading swamps, where marsh-plants abound.

This association differs very much from the previous lists of

It should not be 
overlooked tha in addition to Sphagnum, many mosses and 
hepatics are members of the society.
It only remains to glance at the uppermost portion of its 
course, where it exists as a moorland rill, to complete our 
survey of the stream we have been working up.
The associa-

bracken may be looked upon as a clough plant which follows 
the stream up as long as the slopes of the dwindling valley 
afford it any shelter.
Its upward limit is about 1200 feet, and 
its presence may easily be recognised at a distance, by the 
strong contrast the bracken-clad slopes make with the heather 
or other adjoining moorland societies, as is well seen on ap- 
proaching Gorple Water, or the upper part of Walshaw Dean.
Though the two heaths (Erica) also stop short at about 1,250 
feet, their case is not similar, for they are also found on the flat 
moor top, as well as on the slopes, whereas bracken is not.
The hard-fern also follows the stream up to this stage, and the 
rushes, Sphagnum, Polytvichum commune and other mosses are 
found on its banks.
Veronica scutellata seems to belong to this 
association exclusively, but there is no recent record of it.

Two-thirds of this is 
probably permanent pasture and almost all the rest meadow, 
for it lies above the wheat area, and the 
Hill amount of arable land devoted to oats or 
Pastures.
other crop is quite insignificant.
These hill 
pastures present a more varied association of 
plants than do the fields at a lower level, for the turf is very 
rarely turned by the plough, many of them are ill-drained, and 
others are running back to moorland.
In addition to the more 
ubiquitous of the meadow grasses, which form a part of the 
herbage, the upland pastures contain others which are more 
characteristic, viz.
: â€” 
Agrostis vulgaris Briza media 
Deschampsia flexuosa Festuca ovina 
Sieglingia decumbens Nardus stricta.
The general flora of the pastures is much larger than that 
of the meadows.
All the species already mentioned as 
occurring in meadows may be looked for, with the exception 
of Anthriscus sylvestris and Polygonum Bistorta, which are almost, 
if not entirely, absent.
The additional species of permanent 
pasture may be divided into two classes according as they are 
(i) common to all types of pasture, or (ii) confined to the more 
elevated or hill pastures.
The first includes : â€” 
Trifolium dubium Hypocharis radicata 
Lotus coruiculatus Leontodon hispidus 
Lathyrus montanus L.
autuiniialis 
Potentilla silvestvis Campanula votundifolia 
Galium saxatilc Veronica Chamcudrys 
Senecio Jacobcza Prunella vulgaris 
Cnicus lanceolatus Ajuga veptans 
Centaur ea nigra Rumex Acetosella

Ophioglossum vulgatuin.
The less cultivated pastures on the edge of the moors may 
also yield :â€” 
Viola lutea Erythraa Centaurium 
Poly gala sevpyllacea Gentiana Amarella 
Hypericum pulchrum Euphrasia officinalis 
Linum catharticum Thymus Serpylluni

These are representative of a dry but undrained pasture ; 
in wet ground many of the clough-swamp plants take their 
places.
Frequently these upland pastures are reverting to 
moorland, and are more or less overgrown with heather and 
bilberry (though both are small and inconspicuous) ; and 
clumps of bracken, and such shrubs as hawthorn, bramble, 
rose, gorse (U.
Gallii), broom, and willows are scattered about.
The orchids also chiefly occur in these pastures, such as the 
twayblade, frog, butterfly, and fragrant orchids, nor do the 
plants mentioned exhaust the list.
The plant associations of the moors present a number of 
difficult and very much neglected problems.
The origin of the 
peat itself is still obscure, and whilst its relation to the vegeta- 
tion which it supports has been elucidated to some extent in 
recent years, a faithful representation of the botanical features 
of a moor has hardly been attempted in England, though 
the late Robert Smith has shewn the way in his " Botanical 
Survey of Scotland."* But the popular belief that a moor is 
a rolling stretch of heather is still supported by scientific 
writers, in spite of the fact that on many extensive moors, 
heather is conspicuous only by its absence.
This is pre- 
eminently the case in the parish of Halifax, where the 
heather-clad moors are very much less in extent than the 
cotton-grass moors.
This comparative neglect of the study 
of the peat-vegetation is the more surprising inasmuch as the 
disturbing influence of man enters less into the problem than 
anywhere else ; though it is probably due to the monotonous 
character and the poverty of the moorland flora.
To a certain extent, however, the moors are under cultiva- 
tion, and round the edges especially, drainage and the 
disappearance of peat from one cause or 
Grassy another, lead to the production of a type of 
floors.
unenclosed moor where grasses are pre- 
dominant.
The hill-pastures already described 
are largely what is shown on the ordnance maps as land 
brought under cultivation and enclosed, that is to say, they 
have been ploughed at least once, at any rate where they are 
not too steep.
But in many respects the plant associations of 
these hill-pastures are not distinguishable from those of the 
grassy moor.
The latter may be composed almost exclusively

of grasses like Festuca ovina or Navdus stvicta, mingled with 
Deschampsia flexuosa, Potentilla silvestris, Galium saxatile, and 
similar turf-forming plants ; or heather may also be present in 
varying amounts, though occupying a subordinate position, 
and accompanied by bilberry and other peat plants ; or again, 
on ill-drained level stretches like Erringden Moor the blue 
moor- grass Molinia vavia may prevail, and along with it Erica 
Tetralix, Juncus squarvosus, effusus, and conglomerate.
Where 
the grassy moor is contiguous to a heather moor, it naturally 
approaches it also in the character of the vegetation ; so also 
where it leads up to a cotton-grass moor, Eriophorum and 
Empetvum naturally enter into the association.
So much so 
that the moor along Langfield Edge, where Festuca ovina is 
dominant, is considered later as a variation of the cotton- 
grass moor.
The constant association of heather and bilberry and the 
extreme latitude of their range, is one of the most marked 
features in the flora of the parish.

or less, up to 
the top of Boulsworth Hill (1700ft.) beyond the 
western border.
No other plant is so widely distributed except 
the grass Deschampsia flexuosa, which almost invariably 
accompanies them.
Yet their relative positions are always 
changing under the combined influence of light, moisture, and 
soil, and no association would better repay a careful examina- 
tion of the conditions which are more favourable to one member 
than the other.
Their place in the oak woods has been already 
discussed ; on the slopes of the cloughs above the woods it 
seems impossible to say which is likely to be the more abun- 
dant ; on the lower moor, however, the heather has a decided 
advantage, which is lost again on the summits and highest 
ridges.
The heather moor then is one of moderate elevation, 
and also of moderate humidity, and it may be added of 
moderate extent.
It is either a detached or isolated moorland, 
or forms the outer ring bordering the wetter higher " mosses," 
where cotton-grass alone prevails.
Norland Moor and Ogden 
Moor are the most familiar examples of it, but though parts of 
Midgley, Heptonstall, Stansfield, and Rishworth moors are 
heather-clad they are rather the out-lying spurs.

Other associates of heather on peat, such as 
Andromeda, Arctostaphylos, Pyrola, and Listeva covdata, are either 
now extinct or too limited in distribution to include in the

The associates of heather on such moors are :

west, west, and north-west.
These appear to 
correspond to the " Sphagnum-moor " or " peat-bog," in 
which the peat attains its maximum development, but as the 
dominant plant over the whole of this area is undoubtedly the 
cotton-grass, Eviophovum vaginatum, the name Cotton-grass 
Moor, or Eriophorum Moor â€” as suggested by Mr. C.
E. 
Moss, who lias been the first to call attention to this char- 
acteristic featureâ€” will be used to designate it, though 
it is as well to mention that cotton-grass is not a grass 
at all, but a sedge.
The aspect of these " mosses " differs 
very much from that of the heather-moors.
Wiry, creeping

afford the only safe footing amid the channels of black peat 
and the treacherous patches of bright-green bog-moss.
Instead of the purple haze of autumn, they furnish a dazzling 
snow white harvest in spring, and in winter the sombre ling is 
readily distinguished in the landscape from the green, yellow, 
and red hues which denote the cotton-grass.
A pure Cotton-grass moor as on Boulsworth Hill and 
Jackson's Ridge is composed of Eviophorum vaginatum almost 
exclusively.
The other cotton-grass, E.
angustifolium, occasion- 
ally becomes prominent, but as a rule it is as limited in 
amount as bilberry, crowberry, and heather.
On the slopes 
however, and on rocky ground, these latter enter more largely 
into' the association, and in places there may be a good deal 
of them.
The following table shows the relative abundance 
of the species present : â€” (i) North of Widdop Reservoir, and

zero attached to such as are absent.
At the same time the

It is also possible that Erica Tetvalix occurs in small 
quantity ; it certainly is not far off at rather lower levels.
The strong development of the crowberry is a noticeable 
feature of this association, as is also the presence of the tufts 
of blue moor-grass.

moor may be traced on Langfield Edge, where the slopes are

It extends from 
Stoodley Pike along Langneld Edge, past Gadden reservoirs 
nearly to Todmorden and rises to about 1250ft.
Heather 
is entirely absent, and only one small patch of the cross-leaved 
heath (E.
Tetvalix) was noted, near the reservoirs.
Nor does 
bilberry occur in anything more than small patches, but crow- 
berry {Empetvum) is much more plentiful.
Sheep's Fescue 
grass, Festuca ovina, is the dominant species on the slopes, and 
the two cotton-grasses are found freely with it and more so on 
the edge.
Deschampsia flexuosa and J uncus squavvosus are also 
common.
Cranberry and other marsh plants are present in 
the Sphagnum swamps.
As soon as the top is reached and 
the Yoredale left behind, the moor to the south become more 
like the prevailing type.
There remains one more feature to note before finishing 
with the moors, and that is the greater development of bilberry 
on the very summits, so that along the ridges

Ridge.
This may be seen on VVaystones Edge, where 
Rubus Chamcemonis and Empetvum nigrum are 
associated with it, on Gorple Stones, Dovestones, and other 
heights, but it is most marked on the top of Boulsworth, 
which is some two hundred feet higher.
As the top is approach- 
ed the cotton-grass becomes less prominent, and the summit is 
occupied by bilberry.
There is a good deal of J uncus squavvosus 
growing with it there, and the inseparable heather and 
Deschampsia flexuosa, though only in small quantity, also Festuca 
ovina.
The interest of this lies in the way it just brings our 
moors into line with many of the Scotch mountains, on which 
from 2000 to 3000ft., the bilberry or blaeberry becomes in the 
same way the dominant species.
Blackstone Edge, though somewhat lower and therefore 
allowing the presence of more members in the association, 
clearly comes within the area where bilberry is dominant.
The crowberry is also well to the front, and heather much 
more prominent than on Boulsworth.
CHAPTER III.
Historical and FJiographical Sl<?tch.
ANY records of Halifax plants that have been handed down 
from pre-Linnean times are exceedingly scanty ; but 
since the middle of the eighteenth century the parish has 
possessed an unbroken succession of resident botanists, whose 
publications and collections taken conjointly, embody a mass 
of information on the local flora, which has been invaluable in 
preparing the present work, though some portions of it are 
unrepresented.
The second part of Turner's Herball published in 1562, 
contains the first specific notice of a Halifax plant â€” " It was 
told me by a learned man, a frende of myne, 
Early that in the year of our lorde, mdlvii., that 
Records.
there was a great plentye of galles found upon 
oke leves in the North countre of England and 
namely about Hallyfax." A century later the Pinax of 
Christopher Merrett, 1666, enumerates four, each of excep- 
tional interest, viz : â€” the club-moss, Lycopodium alpiiium, near 
the mile cross, west from Halifax ; Lycopodium Selago, at Dove- 
stones ; Pyrola votundifolia (= media), "at North Bridge, half- 
a-mile from Halifax, plentifully " ; and the bearberry, 
Arctostaphylos Uva-ursi, on a great stone by the river Gorple.
This last constitutes the first British record of the plant, as 
possibly do the first and second also.
What a commentary 
on the changes the last two hundred and fifty years have 
brought about is afforded by these prosaic details !
Gorple 
Stones and Dovestones are still much as they were, though 
the bearberry has probably gone, but for the others to grow in 
what is now the heart of Halifax, shows that the Hebble 
valley and the slopes on which the town is built were then 
more secluded than Norland Clough and Moor are to-day.
The winter green (Pyrola) also attracted the attention of the 
famous John Ray, who records it in 1670 on the road to 
Keighley, and again in 1690 as growing ' on the moors south 
of Heptenstall on the way to Burnley, in great plenty for near 
a mile's riding.' 
In 1724 Ray's Synopsis of British Plants was revised by 
Dillenius, the first Professor of Botany at Oxford, who was 
indebted to Dr. Richardson for most of the plants mentioned 
from this locality.
Dr. Richardson, though not resident in the

parish, lived only three miles across the border at Bierley 
Hall, near Bradford, so that it is natural that some of his 
material should be drawn from it.
One, Senecio saracenius, has 
never been reported again, being a denizen which has gone 
out of use, another, Mcum Atliamanticum, has become extinct 
in recent years, but the others, Mountain Pansy, Wood-sorrel, 
Tooth wort, Daffodil, and Andromeda Poll folia still remain, the 
daffodils in particular nourishing in the same station â€” Coley 
Hall â€” as in 1724.
Golden-rod, a typical Halifax plant, also 
finds a place in this list though on a different authority.
The 
lists of rarer plants at the end of T.
Martyn's Planta 
Cantabrigienses (1763) also include a few from Halifax, but the 
only additional one is Bistort.
So far, therefore, in the course 
of two centuries only fourteen plants have been enumerated, 
and these chiefly on account of their rarity, the commoner 
wood-sorrel only being mentioned to call attention to its being 
found with purple flowers.
But we now reach the period of 
local activity inaugurated by James Bolton, " of Stannary 
near Halifax." 
Apart from his botanical work very little is known about 
James Bolton.
The period of his activity is usually stated 
to range from 1775 to 1795, but as he himself 
James states that he knew of and saw the Killarney 
Bolton.
Fern at Bingley as early as 1758, it is evident 
that he must have turned his attention to 
botany some thirty years before he published a work under his 
own name.
A fortunate incident has enabled me to ascertain 
the date of his death, though at present his age, his birth- 
place, and his grave all remain unknown.
One of the 
predecessors of the Rev. Fr.
E. Millson at Northgate End 
Chapel, Halifax, was the Rev. John Ralph, and a small 
house-keeping book of Mrs. Ralph, used by her as a kind of 
diary, and now belonging to her descendant Mrs. Millson, 
contains the following entry in January, 1799 : â€” 
" On Monday the 7th inst., died of a rapid decline the self- 
taught Painter and Naturalist, Mr. James Bolton, much 
regretted by all who knew his modest worth, and particularly 
by those of his friends who had the most frequent opportunities 
of enjoying his conversation and were best acquainted with his 
merit.
His kind notice of my Sophia and wish to improve her 
in drawing I shall never forget, and the valuable paintings 
given to me by him, I shall ever value and keep as Memorials 
of him." 
HISTORICAL AND BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.

The " History and Antiquities of the Parish of Halifax," 
written by the Rev. John Watson, and published in 1775, 
contains on pp.
729-764, " A Catalogue of 
" Catalogue Plants growing in the Parish of Halifax ; the 
of Plants." Description from Car. Linnaei Species Plant- 
arum, Holmiae 1753, and Gulielmi Hudsoni 
Flora Anglica, London 1762." There is no clue whatever in 
the History itself to the authorship of this Catalogue, but it 
has been generally attributed to James Bolton.* From this 
there is no reason to dissent, and the records reproduced in 
this Flora from the Catalogue are accordingly entered " 1775 
. .
. /.-B.," or "/.
Bolton"; but I had hoped to have 
traced the original acknowledgment, or to have obtained more 
direct proof than I have gleaned.
For such evidence as is 
forthcoming I am indebted to Dr. F.
Arnold Lees, who wrote 
in 1895, " I have seen the acknowledgment in Bolton s own hand, 
but I was using the late Rev. W.
W. Newbould's copy of 
Watson's History .
. .
What became of N's copy 
after his death I know not " ; and again in the Naturalist for 
August, 1900, " The manuscript was seen by my late friend 
the Rev. W.
W. Newbould, and he said it was in Bolton's old 
style hand, and agreed with notes, etc., to the Original Draw- 
ings of the ' History of Ferns."' Apart from the fact that 
there is no one else to whom to assign the authorship, the 
internal evidence of the Catalogue and its close resemblance to 
Bolton's subsequent publications justify the general assump- 
tion.
The similarity of style may be noted on comparing the 
duplicate entries of the ferns, and the same holds good with 
regard to the mosses and fungi of the Catalogue and of the 
later wofiks.
Occasional references by other botanists are also 
confirmatory, as may be seen on turning to Geranium pyrenaicum 
(pp.
21-22).
The author of the Catalogue, though careful to 
record the success of the experiment of introducing seed from 
Bingley (which Bolton visited more than once), leaves it to 
King to say who was the sower.
Again the Catalogue con- 
tains the first local record of Campanula hederacea, and Hudson 
three years later in the second edition of his Flora makes 
mention of it growing " prope Halifax" on the authority of 
Bolton.
So the hepatic Blasia pusilla, specially localised in the 
Catalogue as being ' rare and curious ' appears in Hudson

As the main features of the Catalogue, as far as it relates 
to flowering plants have been discussed in a paper on the 
" Changes in the Halifax Flora during the last Century and a 
Quarter,'' by C.
E. Moss, B.
Sc.
(Naturalist, June, 1900, 
pp.
165-172), and attempted explanations of the difficulties have 
been given both there and under the various species in the body of 
this work, it is unnecessary to go over the ground again.
The 
principle of selection is the first difficulty ; perhaps the most 
probable explanation is that Bolton sought to enumerate all 
the rarer plants known to him, and ignored most of the 
common onesâ€” a plan adopted in many guide books and 
county histories.
The localities are uniformly given in the 
case of the Flowering Plants and Ferns, which are numbered 
consecutively from 1 to 197, but include three others incident- 
ally.
Thereafter " to avoid being tedious " they are omitted, 
" but the more curious Botanic Reader, by application to the 
Publisher, may be informed where he may receive ample 
information." The Musci are numbered from 198 to 289 ; 
Algae (i'e., Hepatics) from 290 to 315 , Lichen, numbers 
316 â€” 433 ; and Fungi, numbers 434 â€” 489.
The first work signed by James Bolton appeared in 
Relhan's Flora Cantabrigiensis, 1785, and consisted of seven 
plates of plants drawn or painted by him, and 
Bolton's engraved by James Sowerby.
In the same 
*' Ferns." year he published the first English monograph 
on the Ferns.

copper plates, and the introduction, which is dated August

are performed wholly by my own hands, from a close and 
careful inspection of the plants ...
I chose to undertake 
it myself, though I had never before practised the art of 
etching." It was completed by the issue in 1790 of a second 
volume, chiefly devoted to the horse-tails, and containing 
fifteen plates.

and coloured, and as the criticisms in Newman's ' History of

" Etched on the Copper immediately from the Plant, Septem- 
ber the 26, A.D., 1790.

Halifax." The work appears to contain the first description 
of Polypodium Robertianum, as a variety of P.
Dryopteris and of 
Woodsia hyperborea under the name of Acvostichum alpinum (tab.
42).
Bolton was a correspondent of various British botanists 
at this time, such as Edward Robson of Darlington, and James 
Dickson the cryptogamist.
Thus, in his concluding paragraph 
he says â€” " Specimens of Polypodium rhceticum and Acros- 
tichum thelypteris were sent me by my friend Dickson, author 
of the Plantarum Cryptogamicarum Britannia." The latter plant 
is the one figured on plate 43, and the following letter is of 
interest as bearing upon it.
It should be remembered in 
connection with it that Bolton's Polypodium Phelyptevis in the 
first volume (tab.
22) was in reality P.
or Lastroea Oreopteris, 
and that plate 43 in Vol. II.
represents the true Lastrcea (or 
Acvostichum) Thelypteris, as there named.

presentation copy to Dickson,* is in the Free Library, Todmor-

Ferns, but extended into four volumes 
though it was restricted to those growing about Halifax.
The 
introduction to the first volume of " An History of Fungusses 
growing about Halifax " is dated January ist, 1788, and that 
of the Appendix or Supplement " by which the work is 
compleated in four volumes ; containing 182 copper plates on 
which are engraved 231 species of Fungusses, exhibited in 
about 900 figures," December 31st, 1791.
As before, there 
were two styles of issue, that with coloured plates costing 
eight guineas.
The work is dedicated to the Earl of Gains- 
borough, who received the original drawings.
" I am happy, 
my Lord, to embrace the Opportunity of acknowledging, that 
it is your Lordship's Generous Encouragement, together 
with that of your late Noble Relative, the Good Duchess 
Dowager of Portland, that the Work in a great Measure 
owes its Existence" Henry, the sixth Earl of Gainsborough, 
was an Honorary Member of the Linnean Society and a well- 
known botanist, and doubtless helped Bolton considerably in 
the production of such a costly work.
Some other drawings 
which he received from Bolton are now in the British Museum 
of Natural History, but it is doubtful whether the originals 
for the History of Fungusses are still in existence.
They 
were probably destroyed by fire when the old Hall at Exton 
(the family seat) was burnt in 18 10.
The next glimpse we get of Bolton shows him in a different 
light.
Having got his Fungusses out of hand he turns his 
attention to the birds, and begins the prepara-

You must know, John, that I have been so long tilted between roses 
and toadstools, and back again from toadstools to roses, that I am wearied 
out with both for the present, and wish (by way of recreation only) to turn 
for awhile to some other page in the great volume.
I have not painted a 
bird this nine or ten years, and yet have so much of this ugly self- 
sufficiency about me, that I think I can do it tolerably, after a few days' 
practice.
Birds for drawing should not be much ruffled, and the colour 
of their eyes should be noted while living or as soon as dead.

Mr. Home, who sold the "Fifty Flowers' to the British 
Museum, says that it was presented by Bolton to his patron, 
the Earl of Gainsborough.
The medium employed for the 
drawings he thinks is sepia.
Mr. Horne still retains a set of 
sixteen water-colour drawings of flowers, both cultivated and 
wild, and there are, I believe, a few others in existence.
Such is the tale of Bolton's life work, pieced together from 
many sources.
Self-taught, versatile, a marvel of industry and 
patience ; his work stands well the test of time, unmarred by 
haste or inaccuracy : not absolutely free from error â€” how 
could it be ?

reap what he has sown.
The memory of Roberts Leyland is preserved by his 
Herbarium of British Plants, now deposited in the Belle Vue 
Museum, Halifax.
The son of William 
Roberts Leyland, he was born in 1784, and from his 
Leyland.
boyhood he was deeply interested in botany, 
and was an enthusiastic collector.
He was a 
member of a respected Halifax family, and of the firm of 
Leyland & Son, Printers.

HISTORICAL AND BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.

Leyland, Junr., were distinguished, the one as a sculptor, the 
other as a local historian and antiquarian.
To his grandson, 
Mr. John Leyland, I am indebted for information not other- 
wise obtainable.
The Halifax Literary and Philosophical Society was 
founded in 1830, one of its chief objects being the formation of 
a Natural History Museum.
Roberts Leyland was one of the 
original members, a trustee, and Curator of Botany, until 
his death on November 15th, 1847.
He was closely con- 
cerned in the growth of the Society and its Museum, having 
charge also of the shells, and forming collections of his own in 
conchology, mineralogy, and ornithology.
Many of these 
went to the Museum at Akroydon, which Colonel Akroyd was 
instrumental in founding.
Some relics are still in the possess- 
of his grandson, Mr. John Leyland, who also retains some 
volumes of letters written to him by the botanists with whom 
he corresponded.
He was much interested in the production 
of Baines' Yorkshire Flora, to which he lent considerable help 
and which was printed by Leyland & Son. His name also 
appears, as the authority for various Halifax plants, in the 
Topographical Botany of H.
C. Watson, with whom he made 
exchanges.
But it was not till long after Leyland's death that the 
Museum in Harrison Road became possessed of a good 
botanical collection.
In 1877 King presented his Herbarium, 
and the next year Col. Akroyd gave the Society the Herbarium 
formed by Roberts Leyland, and this was supplemented by 
the gift from F.
A. Leyland of many more plants which had 
originally belonged to his father's collection.
The duty of 
arranging these large collections fell to William Craven, who 
had been an original member of the Society and had 
succeeded Leyland in the Curatorship of Botany.
This duty 
was completed by 1881, and the Curator was able to report to 
the Council of the Literary and Philosophical Society that the 
Leyland Herbarium contained 2,269 British Flowering Plants 
and Ferns presented by Col. Akroyd, and 675 by F.
A. 
Leyland ; also 150 British Lichens and 226 British Mosses 
from Col. Akroyd.
Many of the plants are of course 
duplicates, " which have been retained in the Herbarium on 
account of the localities from which they are known to have 
been obtained." The Curator arranged them according to the 
Natural System, adopting the order of Hooker and Arnott's 
British Flora, the Herbarium containing specimens of almost 
lvi.
THE FLORA OF HALIFAX.
the whole of the British plants mentioned therein.
The 
report for 1885, after Mr. Craven's death, speaks highly of the 
care and attention he bestowed on the arrangement of the 
specimens, " and the careful and methodical way in which they 
were catalogued, repaired and relabelled." 
In 1896 all the collections in the Museum were presented 
by the Society to the town, and the Natural History specimens 
were transferred to Belle Vue, where Leyland's and the other 
Herbaria are placed in cabinets in the botanical room of the 
Museum.
Though the largest of the three herbaria, it is 
exceeded in the number of local species by King's.
Still there 
are about 270 flowering plants and ferns from the parish in 
Leyland's with the locality specified on the label, and a good 
many others merely stated to be 'frequent,' but clearly of his 
own gathering and not exchanges.
These latter, however, 
have not been incorporated in this Flora, so that sometimes a 
very common plant is apparently unrecorded until recent 
years.
Many of the specimens are also undated, but the 
majority are furnished with dates, the earliest being 18 14 and 
the latest 1843.
The plants are still in a good state of 
preservation, and some of them are no longer to be found 
growing within the parish.
A group of ' working-men naturalists ' next claims 
attention, of whom Samuel Gibson, of Hebden Bridge, was 
perhaps the most notable and was somewhat the earliest, 
though they were all contemporaneous.
As 
Samuel the details of his life and pursuits have been 
Gibson.
previously printed, there is more information 
available, but less necessity to repeat it all here.
The son of a whitesmith at Hebden Bridge, Samuel Gibson 
was born in 1789 or 1790, and was soon put to his father's 
trade, receiving no education except at a Sunday School.
He 
married at 19, brought up a family of nine, and in later years 
had to give up his occupation as he was disabled by a fall.
So for a time he established himself in a small inn at Mytholm- 
royd and fitted up a room as a Museum.
But this failed to 
support him and he spent his last years in a cottage near the 
station, having to part with most of his natural history collec- 
tions to keep his wife and himself.
He died on May 21st, 
1849, at the age of 59.
His enthusiasm for all branches of natural history is made 
evident in the chapter devoted to him in " Where there's a 
Will there's a Way : An Account of the Labours of Natural- 
HISTORICAL AND BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.

ists in Humble Life," by James Cash (1873).
Geology, 
entomology, conchology, all claimed his attention as well as 
botany.
He furnished geological material to Prof.
Phillips, 
who named a new species after him Goniatites Gibsoni ; and his 
collection of fossils, which was shown at the Manchester 
meeting of the British Association in 1842, was purchased for 
the Manchester Museum, and is now at Owens College.
His 
collection of insects was sold after his death for ^"45 after being 
snapped up for as many shillings.
In botany he contributed largely to the literature of his 
time, especially on questions relating to the hawkweeds 
sedges, and ferns.
" To Mr. S.
Gibson, of Hebden Bridge," 
writes Baines in the preface to his Flora of Yorkshire, " the 
Catalogue is under great obligations, not only for the free 
communications of his discoveries, especially in Cryptogamic 
Botany, but also for his attention to the general completeness 
of the Work." Edward Newman in his History of British 
Ferns frequently mentions the receipt of varieties from Gibson.
But it is in the first volume of the ' Phytologist,' 
1841-1844, that Gibson is most in evidence, almost 
every number containing some note, enquiry or paper 
by him, or a controversial discussion of his discoveries.
Some 
of his conclusions have not been accepted, but there remain 
his variety spinosa of Sagina pvocumbens, and the variety pvostvata 
(Bab.) of 5.
apetala, both found by him about Halifax.
Gibson 
was also the first to find Hievacium hypochcsvoides, as he named 
it, or what Backhouse called Hievacium Gibsoni, at Malham, 
and a variety of Cavex Goodenowii, which Babington named 
Gibsoni, at Hebden Bridge.
His Cavex pseudo-pavadoxa, which 
involved him in a bitter controversy, is now known as 
C. tevetiuscida, var.
Ehvhavtiana, whilst Newman adopted his 
name nudum for a variety of Equisetum palustve supplied by him.
Gibson left large botanical collections.
Some appear to be 
lost now, but the Royal Museum, Peel Park, Salford, contains 
his collection of seeds and seed-vessels of British and Foreign 
plants, mounted between glass slips for examination under the 
microscope.
His herbarium of British flowering plants, said 
to have been valued at ^"75, was purchased after his death by 
Mr. Mark Philips, M.P. for Manchester.
I was fortunate 
enough a few years ago to trace it to the possession of his 
daughter, Lady Trevelyan, of Welcombe, Stratford-on-Avon, 
and shortly afterwards, Lady Trevelyan, acting on my 
suggestion, presented it to the Halifax Corporation, and it was

deposited in the Belle Vue Museum in 1897.
This has 
enabled me to examine and re-arrange the herbarium, and to 
incorporate all the local records in this Flora.
These represent 
about 230 species, gathered between 1823 and 1848.
The 
specimens as a whole are in a fair state of preservation, but 
are not so well mounted, being merely preserved loose between 
sheets of paper, nor so well labelled as King's and Leyland's.
The sedges are the best section, and the brambles are also 
well represented, but there are no ferns at all.
A " List of 
Desiderata," which Gibson printed for purposes of exchange, 
shows by its shortness that the herbarium was then almost 
complete, and that it included the mosses in its scope as well, 
though none now belong to it.
The third herbarium at Belle Vue was formed by Samuel 
King.
The youngest son of John King, he was born at Lane 
House, Midgley, on June 12th, 1810.
Lane 
Samuel House was then a farm, on the road from Ludden- 
King.
den Foot to Luddenden, and John King also 
carried on there the manufacture of plush cloth by 
hand loom.
Samuel King looked after the farm in his 
younger days, but being passionately fond of flowers and wild 
plants, he made a nursery garden between the house and the 
brook, and used to show herbaceous and alpine plants at the 
flower show at Pye Nest.
At one time he was gardener at 
the Hollins, Warley, when tulips were still in favour, and the 
collection under his care was a valuable one.
The nursery at 
Lane House he handed over to his nephews, William and 
Charles Eastwood, 'in the year i860, as he was becoming 
incapacitated for work through failing eyesight.
Eventually 
he became blind, but in spite of this he remained for many 
years minister at Butts Green Baptist Chapel, Warley.
Shortly after giving up the nursery King went to live at 
Bank Bottom, Luddenden.
In 1865 he was elected a 
pensioner of the Halifax Tradesmen's Benevolent Institution, 
and this ultimately led to his Herbarium being presented by 
him to the Halifax Literary and Philosophical Society.
The 
following letter, signed by him, accompanied the gift, and 
explains the arrangement of the Herbarium.

to be deposited in the Halifax Museum for the benefit of the

Accompanying the Herbarium is an interleaved copy of Baines' 
" Flora of Yorkshire," also a volume of the " Phytologist," in which at 
page 5S5 is a description of the Herbarium, and which description should 
be read by anyone wishing to examine it.
When examining any of the 
Vols, care should be taken to turn over by the blue leaves as the white 
ones are loose.
The six Fascicles placed on the shelf are a fragment of a collection 
intended to be arranged according to the natural arrangement ; not having 
been able to carry out that work the specimens are put in fascicles according 
to the Linnaean system, and numbered to correspond with the Vols, of the 
Herbarium.
To reduce the bulk of Vol. 6 the genus ' Salix ' has been 
removed to fascicle no.

I am, Gentlemen, 
Yours faithfully, 
SAMUEL KING.
According to the report of the Literary and Philosophical 
Society for 1877, the Herbarium contained 1,450 British 
Plants in the six volumes, and 360 duplicates in the fascicles.
The arrangement of it remains undisturbed, and the specimens 
are in an excellent state of preservation.
There are about 500 
entries of local plants, collected between 1829 and 1856, though 
very few were added after 1844.
King contributed to Miall's Flora of the West Riding ; and 
a rose sent by him from Luddenden to Mr. J.
G. Baker in 
1862 was named R.
cvyptopoda, and does not appear to have 
been reported again.
But King's chief contribution to the 
botanical literature of the parish was a paper in the Phytolog- 
ist â€” Â« List of Plants observed in the dried-up bed of a Wear 
on Luddenden-brook, in July, 1844." Some of these he 
explains, were undoubtedly escapes from the sweepings of the 
corn- mill a few hundred yards higher up the stream.
But the 
majority of the hundred or more enumerated are just such as 
might be found there to-day.
The only exceptions are the 
primrose and yellow archangel, whose disappearance is the 
only evidence of any changes brought about in more than half 
a century.

THE FLORA OF HALIFAX.
Samuel King died on January ioth, 1888, and was interred 
at Butts Green Chapel, Warley.
I am indebted to his nephew 
Mr. John King, of Halifax, for many personal details of his life.
Associated with King was his nephew Charles Eastwood.
Born at Halifax in 1839, but brought up with his uncle, he 
soon as a boy took an interest in botany, and 
Charles assisted King in mounting and labelling his 
Eastwood, specimens.
From sixteen to eighteen he was a 
gardener at Stansfield Hall, and became a 
member of the Todmorden Botanical Society.
Then for two 
years he was employed at Kew Gardens, after which he 
returned to Luddenden and took up the Lane House nurseries.
He died on December 21st, 1895.
His name frequently 
appears as the authority for Halifax plants in Miall's Flora.
Going back somewhat, we find a number of active botanists 
at Todmorden, of whom John Nowell was the most eminent.
He was born at Springs, near Harley Wood, in 
John 1802.
At a very early age he was employed as a 
Nowell.
winder, at nine he began to weave, and afterwards 
became a twister-in, and remained such until his 
death.
His love for botany w T as first acquired from Edmund 
Holt, of Lumbutts, the father of the Todmorden School of 
Botanists, and such education as he received w 7 as mostly gained 
from a grammar class at Shore Chapel, taught by the Rev.
John Midgley.
He died October 28th, 1867, at White Hart 
Fold, and was interred at Cross-stone Church.
A 
monument was erected to his memory in the old Church- 
yard at Todmorden by his fellow botanists.
The Manchester 
Guardian for November 5th, 1867, contains an account of 
his labours, and Mr. Abraham Stansfield, jun., devotes a 
chapter " A Lancashire Moss Gatherer " to him in his 
" Essays and Sketches." His portrait has been recently 
hung in the Todmorden Free Library, which also contains his 
collection of mosses numbering 469 species, of which 147 are 
local ones.
The duplicate specimens were, unfortunately, 
destroyed.
Nowell was one of the ablest students of mosses that 
Yorkshire ever produced.
All the Floras of Yorkshire and the 
West Riding bear witness to his industrious and successful 
search for mosses, not only in the productive cloughs between 
Todmorden and Hebden Bridge, but over a much wider field, 
and his early discoveries have been amply confirmed.
In 1836 
he added the rare moss Cinclidium stygium to the British Flora,

finding it near Malham Tarn, when in the company of two 
other Todmorden botanists, John Howarth and William 
Greenwood.
These three, and also Gibson, contributed 
numerous species to the list of mosses in Baines' Flora of 
Yorkshire, and when this was re- written by Mr. J.
G. Baker 
in 1854, Nowell was entrusted with the production of the 
second part of the " Supplement " dealing with the mosses of 
the county.
His help is again acknowledged in the Flora of 
the West Riding (1862), where in the Introduction to the 
Cryptogamia, Dr. Carrington writes : â€” " To my friend, Mr.
J. Nowell, of Todmorden, I owe special thanks.
There are 
few districts of Yorkshire, or the adjacent counties, with the 
varieties of which he has not become acquainted during his 
long and useful life, and I paid my first visit to many of the 
stations recorded below under his guidance." 
Nowell enjoyed the friendship of most of the bryologists of 
his day.
He was visited at Todmorden by Dr. Schimper, of 
Strassburg, and his correspondence with W.
Wilson is 
preserved in the Botanical Department of the British Museum.
The generic name Nowellia w r as chosen in his honour.
The Todmorden Botanical Society was founded in 1852 
mainly by the efforts of John Nowell and Abraham Stansfield, 
the latter being the first President.
Abraham 
Abraham Stansfield was born January 12th, 1802, at 
Stansfield.
Hugeon Croft near Shore, in Stansfield, and 
after a short time spent at a day school in Shore 
he went to weave.
Removing to Stones-bottom he became 
acquainted with Nowell.
Some verses written by him 
attracted the attention of Mr. Ramsbottom of Centre Vale, 
and led to his being appointed gardener at Centre Vale.
In 
1844 he started as a nurseryman on his own account at Vale 
Gardens, Todmorden, and after some years took his sons, 
Thomas and Abraham, into partnership.
The Stansfields 
devoted their attention to varieties of British Ferns, and built 
up both a reputation and a large business in that line.
Judg- 
ing from the many varieties of ferns enumerated by them in 
Miall and Carrington's Flora, their cultivated forms must have 
been largely derived from the varieties to be obtained so 
abundantly in the Vale of Todmorden.
The father contributed 
a chapter on botany to " A History of the Forest of Rossen- 
dale " (1868).
He died on August 15th, 1880, at Todmorden, 
in Cheshire, and there is a memorial notice of him in the 
Gardeners'' Chronicle for 1880, ii.
283, and another account in 
lxii.

for 1882.
In 1896 the Todmorden Botanical Society, of which Mr.
Abraham Stansfield, jun., was then President, presented its 
library and collections to the District Council.
These are now 
housed in the Todmorden Free Library, and include Nowell's 
mosses mentioned above, and a set of ' British Ferns arranged 
by A.
Stansfield.' The latter contains over 200 specimens 
including a great many cultivated varieties.
A portrait of 
Stansfield has also been placed in the Library.
The Working Men's College at Haley Hill, founded by 
Colonel Akroyd, greatly promoted the study of natural history 
in Halifax, thirty or forty years ago.
The 
John Haley Hill Literary and Scientific Society was 
Walker.
an offshoot of the College, founded about i860, 
and the establishment of the Ovenden Natural- 
ists' Society in 1865 may be looked upon as another indication 
of the same eager pursuit of natural history.
The Haley Hill Society circulated a paper amongst its 
members, and when, in 1866, it ventured to print these contri- 
butions, the " Monthly Magazine of Literature, Science and 
Art," which resulted, was named the " Circulator." This was 
published by R.
Leyland & Son, and sold at twopence a 
number, and it continued to appear for about two years.
In 
the "Circulator," commencing with page 101, appeared a 
series of articles under the head of " Botany," which gave 
substantially a list of the flowering plants and ferns found in 
Shibden, with a few others found elsewhere in the parish.
These are only signed "J.
W." until the conclusion, when the 
author signs himself Jno. Walker, Akroydon, and "acknowledges 
with pleasure his obligations to Mr. James Whiteley, of Shib- 
den Head, and to Mr. B.
Barber, of Woodside Lodge, for the 
information which they have kindly rendered concerning some 
of the localities mentioned." 
The author of this list, John Walker, was a native of 
Boothtown, Halifax, and was born June 24th, 1839.
He was 
brought up in the worsted trade, and about 1880 started 
business on his own account as a worsted manufacturer at 
Claremount, residing at Lee House, Shibden.
About ten 
years later he removed to larger premises at Norwood Green, 
and went to live at Coley Mill House, where he died on May 
1 6th, 1895, an d was interred at the Lister Lane Cemetery, 
Halifax.
HISTORICAL AND BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.
lxiii.
The list enumerates rather more than 300 plants, and is 
thoroughly representative.
It contains a few mistakes, some 
of which have been detected by being repeated in a small 
collection of plants, formed by J.
Walker in 1862, which is 
now in the botanical room at Belle Vue Museum.
The Halifax Scientific Society had its origin in 1874, m a 
course of University Extension Lectures on Geology, by Prof.
W. J.
Sollas, F.R.S., and was for a time known as the Halifax 
Geologists' Field Club.
It was not till 1886 or 1887 that a 
Botanical Section was established in connection with the 
Society, and the prime movers in its ioundation still happily 
remain associated with the Natural History Section, as it is 
now called.
But any sketch of deceased Halifax botanists would be 
incomplete which did not make mention of Henry Thomas 
Soppitt, though he was only a member of the 
H. T.
Society for five years, joining it when he took 
Soppitt.
up his residence in Halifax, in 1894.
He had 
then for years been recognised as one of the 
ablest botanists in Yorkshire, and he soon took a keen interest 
in the Halilax Flora, especially in his own branch of the fungi.
Passing by his additions to the list of fungi, and records of 
mosses, some of which are to be found in the annual reports in 
the Halifax Naturalist, he was the first to record in recent years 
Sisymbrium Tlialianum, Epilobium roseum, Ceratophyllum demersum, 
Potamogeton pusillus, P.
pectinatus, and Festuca sylvatica amongst 
the flowering plants.
Other phases of Soppitt's activities, especially his experi- 
mental researches on the microscopic fungi, have been dealt 
with in the obituary notices which appeared in the Gardeners'' 
Chronicle (April 15, 1899, p.
239), the Naturalist for May, 1899, 
and the Halifax Naturalist, Vol. IV., pp.
31-36.
Born at 
Bradford on June 21st, 1858, he died at Halifax on the first of 
April, 1899.
His name has been utilised by Mr. Massee to 
designate a new genus Soppittiella, and a new species Dasyscypha 
Soppittii, and Mr. Crossland has named a species Thielavia 
Soppittii, so that his name will always be associated with the 
parish he came to love so well.
His botanical collections and 
books have been purchased by members of the Yorkshire 
Naturalists' Union for presentation to the Union, to form the 
nucleus of a Soppitt Memorial Library of Mycological 
Literature.

CHAPTER V.
Plan of the Flora.
THE Flora (pages 1-144) is arranged in accordance with 
the ninth edition (1895) Â°* : tne " London Catalogue of 
British Plants." 
i. â€” The botanical name (as given in the Catalogue, with 
one or two exceptions) is placed first in heavy type, and after 
it the authority for the name, in the usual abbreviated form 
(e.g., L.
= Linneus).
When the plant is an alien, its name is 
printed in italics.
Entries of species which are considered to 
be now extinct, or to have been erroneously recorded, are 
placed within square brackets ] .
ii.
â€” The 'census number' that follows each name indicates 
in how many Watsonian vice-counties the plant is found in a 
native or quasi-native state.
In order to arrive at a more 
exact knowledge of the distribution of British plants, H.
C. 
Watson divided Great Britain into 112 botanical areas (vice- 
counties) more uniform in size than the counties.
Yorkshire 
includes five of these vice-counties, and the whole of the 
parish of Halifax lies in No. 63.
The census numbers (revised 
to 1895) therefore show at a glance the comparative frequency 
or rarity of each plant in Great Britain ; the maximum being, 
of course, 112.
iii.
â€” As there were many changes made in the names of 
species in the ninth edition of the Catalogue, it has been 
necessary to add in some cases the more familiar ones employed 
in Hooker's ' Student's Flora.' These synonyms come next, 
and are printed in ordinary type, to avoid confusion with aliens, 
printed in italics.
As this objection does not apply in Mr.
Crossland's section, synonyms are there printed in italics, from 
page 151 onwards.
iv.
â€” The English names that follow are those in common 
use, either by collectors or more generally, and they include a 
few local names.
v. â€” The status of the plants, or their rank of citizenship, is 
given at the commencement of the second line.
To determine 
this is often a problem of the greatest difficulty, and whilst 
PLAN OF THE FLORA.
lx\i 
botanists have accepted the principles set forth in Watson's 
" Cybele Britannica " and the "Compendium." their local 
application is sometimes more a matter of conjecture than of 
certainty.' " The terms, Native, Denizen, Colonist, Alien and 
Casual, serve to express a descending series, from the truly 
wild and pre-historically established species, down to the 
occasional stragglers from cultivation, or the products of seeds 
accidentally imported with merchandise, ship-ballast, or other- 
wise." Mr. Watson proceeds to define these terms as fol- 
lows : â€” 
(a) Native â€” "Apparently an aboriginal British species." 
(b) Denizen â€” "At present maintaining its habitats as if a 
native species, without the direct aid of man, but liable to some 
suspicion of having been originally introduced by human 
agency, whether by design or accident." 
it) Colonist â€” "A weed of cultivated land, by road sides, 
or about houses, and seldom found except in places where the 
ground has been adapted for its production and continuance by 
the operations of man ; with a tendency in some of them to 
appear on the shores, landslips, and in what are called ' waste 
places.' " 
(d) Alien â€” " Presumably introduced by human agency." 
(e) Casual â€” "Chance stragglers from cultivation; those 
occasionally imported and sown with agricultural seeds ; those 
introduced among wool, oil-seeds, or other merchandise; foreign 
plants found on ballast heaps deposited from ships ; and gener- 
ally such alien species as are most uncertain in place and 
persistence." 
These definitions have been strictly adhered to, though the 
application of them may be faulty at times.
In practice the 
classes shade off into one another ; e.g., some species may be 
regarded either as denizens or aliens ; others either as colonists 
or casuals ; again, the term alien or casual may often be used 
indifferently.
The rank assigned to any species here has, of 
course, exclusive reference to its existence in the parish of 
Halifax.
Necessarily it cannot have a higher rank than in 
Britain as a whole, so Watson's decision must be accepted as 
an upward limit ; but it may have a lower rank, and in fact 
cases frequently occur where species truly native elsewhere in 
Britain are not native, but only denizens, casuals, etc., in this 
district.
Occasionally the addition of a note of interrogation 
or an alternative denotes uncertainty at the time of compiling 
the list.
Longer experience would now lead me, in almost 
IXXll THE FLORA OF HALIFAX.
every case, to assign the species the lower rank, and to interpret 
the query as a negation.
In order to distinguish clearly between the more essential 
constituents of the Mora, and the accidental, the names and 
synonyms of all aliens, whether called such, or casuals, garden 
apes, or introductions, are printed in italics.
If a census- 
number follows a name in italics, it shows that the species is 
more tiuly native elsewdiere in Britain.
But if the number is 
wanting, the species is regarded nowhere as more than an alien.
The main list does not include any plants that are not mentioned 
in the London Catalogue, such foreign species as have occurred 
being relegated to the Appendix.
vi.
â€” The next particular, also due to H.
C. Watson, is 
intended to show the distribution of the plants in Britain as a 
whole, or in which part of the island each species is most 
prevalent.
An explanation of these ' types ' has already been 
given in Chapter II., page xxiv.
vii.
â€” The duration of the plant, whether Annual, Biennial, 
or Perennial, is indicated by the abbreviations A, B, and P 
respectively.
The terms Shrub and Tree are also employed.
viii.--The last specific item is a statement of the months 
when the plant is in flower, or otherwise in a suitable state for 
identification.
In the case of at least all the commoner flowers 
the data are based on local observations.
ix.
â€” Then there follows a list, in chronological order, of 
all the published or accessible records of the occurrence 
of each plant within the parish.
The admirable " Flora of the 
West Riding," by F.
Arnold Lees was the quarry which pro- 
vided the foundations of this list.
But as the present work 
also includes many additional records of local botanists during 
the last sixty years, perhaps these contributions to a more 
exact knowdedge of the West Riding Flora will repay the 
indebtedness.
Particulars of every source of information 
will be found in Chapter III ; and the origin of every record 
can be at once traced, if it is not apparent, by reference to the 
corresponding year in the Bibliography (Chapter IV.) When 
the record is based on a herbarium specimen, it is clearly 
indicated ; the date in this case will vary considerably, or may 
be wanting.
The name of the authority for the record is put 
in italics ; in the case of some few oft quoted names initials 
are substituted, or the name abbreviated, but no + invariably.
x. â€” The last paragraph describes our knowledge of the 
occurrence and distribution of the plant at the present day.
PLAN OF THE FLORA.
IXXUI 
No system of artificial divisions of the parish has been adopted* 
but every care has been taken to present concisely as faithful 
a picture as possible of its habitat, range and abundance.
The usual terms employed are : Very common, common, 
infrequent, rare, and very rare, representing a diminishing 
sequence.
' Frequent,' when used, represents a stage between 
' common ' and ' infrequent.' Next the habitat is given, and 
lastly, except in the case of the commonest plants, either all 
the stations in which the species has been observed since 
1885, or a sufficient number of them to indicate its range.
A 
word as to the system of punctuation is necessary.
"Sun 
Wood, Walter Clough, Ogclen, Norland," represent as many 
separate localities.
But where a less known locality is given 
it is often supplemented by the name of the township, &c, 
and then a semicolon is employed to separate the stations, e.g., 
" Tag Lock, Elland ; \\ 'illow Wood, Sowerby ; Broadhead 
Wood, Erringden," enumerates three places only.
The stations in this last paragraph are based on the records 
of the Botanical (now Natural History) Section of the Halifax 
Scientific Society, of which I have been custodian since 1893.
As a rule no personal authority is mentioned for these ; indeed, 
it would be difficult to do so.
Nor have I made use of any 
sign to denote my own personal knowledge of a species or its 
stations, for there are very few cases in which I have not seen 
both.
But I could not omit to mention the names of some of 
the members who have contributed to the common fund, for 
it is only by their sustained interest in the botany of the 
parish that the list attains its completeness.
Messrs.
J. T.
Aspin, U.
Bairstow, J.
H. Bolton, W.
H. Cooke, C.
Crossland, 
and J.
Wms. SutclifTe, have all been closely associated with the 
work of the Section, and Mr. J.
Whiteley links this with the 
last list of plants, that in the Circulator.
Help has also been 
freely rendered by Mr. J.
Needham, of Hebden Bridge, and 
the members of the Ovenden, Elland, and W r est Vale Natur- 
alists' Societies.
To Mr. C.
E. Moss I am especially indebted 
for many suggestions whilst the Flora has been passing through 
the press, in addition to much information with regard to the 
sedges, grasses, &c.
The late Mr. H.
T. Soppitt also took a 
deep interest in the production of the Flora, and brought his 
extensive experience and keen perception to bear upon local 
problems with great success.

In the ' Doubtful ' column are placed Errors, certain or 
probable, Incognita or uncertainties, as well as species the 
stations for which lie or may lie outside the parish boundary, 
and the general residuum which remains incapable of further 
treatment.
Of the species not recently recorded, many are no doubt 
extinct, especially in some classes.
It is equally certain that 
all of them are not.

The numerous records point to the comparative rarity of

dant and widely distributed in the upper Calder valley.
There has been some confusion of this and P.
minor, but 
as regards the North Dean station, not only Bolton's 
statement, but the herbarium specimens prove that both 
existed there, though only P.
minor is now found.
As to the 
other stations it is extinct at North Bridge and Birks

still remain at any of the others.

The above records all refer to C.
nudiflorus, which was also 
first described as Colchicum at Nottingham (1738), and as 
C. sativus at Derby.
It is found more frequently about Halifax 
than in any other district in England, except South Lancashire, 
though the previously published stations are not numerous.
Its probable origin in the district is discussed elsewhere, but 
an acquaintance with its Halifax stations shows conclusively 
( 1) that it cannot be merely a garden escape or outcast ; (2) 
that it is not confined to low-lying river-side meadows.
It is 
now found in the following localities: (i.) Well Head Fields, 
Halifax ; in considerable quantity in the pasture, and several 
patches in the meadow, between Clover Hill and Skircoat 
Road ; also a few bulbs in the adjoining vicarage glebe.
It 
does not appear to remain at Savile Green itself, which is 
entirely occupied by gardens and residences, but the two places 
are practically the same station, (ii.) Coley, Winter Edge 
Farm (1895).
< m -) Ovenden Hall; in considerable quantity 
in two or three fields in Grove Lane, on the side further from 
the Hall, most abundant in the hedge side, (iv.) Watkinson 
Hall Park, Ovenden ; south side of the railway cutting (1893).
(v.) Ovenden Brook, north of Holmfield ; in numerous fields 
near Holdsworth to Lower Scholecroft and Woodlands 
Farms, bordering the railway cutting and the stream for about 
a mile, ascending to about 750 feet.
Only on the right bank 
of the stream, the left is composed of shales and clay of lower 
coal measures.
In some of the fields, which are occasionally 
brought under the plough, it is confined to the edges, where, 
however, it is abundant, (vi.) Spring Gardens, Wheatley ; 
abundant in a meadow below Ramsden Wood, where it has 
been known to residents for more than eighty years.
(= 
Ovenden Wood of 1862).
This station is about a mile west 
of Ovenden Hall and the Hebble Valley, (vii.) Warley

Clough ; sparingly in the small clough above the Burnley 
Road, behind the brewery.
This is identical with Bolton's 
station, " Hill in Warley," now called Fernhill.
(viii.) The 
Hollins, Warley ; in some of the fields, also along the drive, 
and in the plantation, into which it has probably been intro- 
duced from the fields, (ix.) Cold Edge, Warley ; abundant in 
a meadow on the roadside, to the south of Withins Gap Farm 
The station is 1400 feet above sea level, on the ridge of the 
moors dividing Calderdale from Airedale.
According to a 
gamekeeper, it has been there fifty years, and was formerly in 
a corner of the field near the house, but was probably distri- 
buted when the high-road was widened, and the earth spread 
on the field, (x.) High House Farm, Midgley ; very abundant 
in two fields at an altitude of 850 feet, and known to have 
been there forty years.
It has also been found in small 
quantity lower down the Luddenden Valley, near Booth.
(xi.) Shaw Edge Farm, Soyland (700 feet) ; very abundant in 
a meadow between the farm and Sage W 7 ood (1893).
( xn 
Eastwood ; the plant at Great House proves, on examination, 
to be C.
nudiflorus, as suggested in Lees' Flora.

It has 
also been stated to grow between the canal and the Calder, 
on the border of Elland Park Wood (1895), but I have failed 
to find it there.
Just outside the parish, it occurs in con- 
siderable quantity at Biikby, between Fixby and Huddersfield.

The type eu-flova does not occur, but a variety is common 
in the cloughs and moorland pastures.
By the older 
botanists it was called CEdevi ; Dr. Lees in his Flora 
refers it to minor ; to Mr. C.
E. Moss and myself the 
plant we have and the herbarium specimens appear to be 
lepidocarpa.
In the absence of a description of the 
varieties enumerated in the last (9th) edition of the London 
Catalogue, the records of former workers are retained 
unchanged.

To a careless observer, the Halifax cloughs 
may seem to be as rich in ferns as they ever could have 
been, but the irresistible propensity to lift a fern, if it has a 
marketable value, has played havoc in their ranks.

altogether exonerated.
\Lastrcea Thelypteris, Presl.
â€” 43.
Error.
Bolton's Acrostichum thelypteris of 1775, and Polypodium thelyp- 
teris of 1785 are the next species (q.v.) as Newman pointed 
out : â€” " Bolton made a somewhat similar mistake by 
figuring Lastvcea Oveoptevis in its stead ( ' Fil.' tab.
22) ; 
but this he subsequently rectified by repeating the species 
under its proper name {Id. tab.
43)" â€” Brit.
Ferns, 124.
In 
addition to the erroneous figure of L.
Thelypteris in " Eng- 
lish Botany," mentioned by Newman, S.
Goodenough, the 
botanical Bishop of Carlisle, fell into exactly the same 
mistake as Bolton.
In a letter of his in the " Memoir of 
Sir J.
E. Smith " (Vol. I, p.
540) he writes: â€” " I always 
thought we found P.
Thelypteris near Bury ; but by your

Certainly gone long ago from Mile Cross, in Gibbet Lane ; 
and no longer common or frequent on any of the moors.
Probably all the club-mosses have become much rarer 
within the last century, or even half-century ; but with 
so much moorland within the parish it is improbable 
that they have become extinct.
Lack of records is in 
part due to difficulty of free access to the moors, and 
consequent comparative neglect of their more scattered 
plants.
But it also seems likely that the practice of 
firing the moors, in the interests of grouse, has brought 
about the more or less complete disappearance of the 
club-mosses, and some other moorland plants.

THE 1*1055= PLORA.
CHARLES CROSSLAND, F.L.S.
INTRODUCTION.
THE accompanying list of mosses is based very largely 
upon the labours of Bolton, Gibson, Nowell, and other 
early workers in this branch of botany, within the boundaries 
of the parish of Halifax.
The results of their individual efforts 
have been registered in several previously published floras.
All records considered to be of a satisfactory nature have been 
utilised again.
In addition, all existing local herbaria contain- 
ing mosses have been consulted ; these have furnished several 
species, of which no records have hitherto been published.
In 
many instances, when thought necessary, and when the 
material was available, old records have been checked by an 
examination of the specimens.
No records can be satisfactorily traced for this district prior 
to those contained in the Catalogue of Plants, which forms not 
the least interesting or valuable portion of Watson's History 
of Halifax (1775).
This catalogue is now generally accepted 
as being the work of James Bolton.
It contains 89 species 
under the heading of Mosses: their numbers being 201-289.
Of these, 69 have been confirmed by recent gatherings, two 
are now included in the liverworts, one is a synonym and 
two are not traceable.
The remaining fifteen are all known 
British mosses, but have not been again recorded for this district.
Possibly a few of the fifteen may be errors : the list was made 
and published when the study of these minute plants was in its 
infancy, and the descriptions meagre.
Nor had Bolton any 
opportunity of correcting the catalogue when it had once been 
published, though he probably recognised that it contained 
some mistakes, as he continued to work at the Halifax flora 
for many years afterwards.
These unconfirmed records are 
here placed within brackets.
The disappearance of other 
mosses may be accounted for by the great changes wrought in 
the district by the increasing vitiation of the atmosphere and 
I46 THE FLORA OF HALIFAX.
the pollution of streams during the last century and a quarter.
A few are still gradually, but surely, disappearing.
It is to be regretted that Bolton, on reaching this portion 
of his flora, ceased to give his interesting information as to 
habitat, etc., under each species, as had been done with the 
flowering plants and ferns in the earlier part of the catalogue.
He remarks : " To avoid being tedious, the places where the 
mosses and lichens in Halifax parish are to be found will be 
omitted, and their species only enumerated by their trivial 
names, as mentioned in Hudson's Flora Anglica ; but the more 
curious Botanic Reader, by application to the Publisher, may 
be informed where he may receive ample information concern- 
ing any or all of these." We should have preferred him being 
" tedious." He would have preserved to us much valuable 
information concerning the surroundings of Halifax and the 
district generally, as they appeared at the time he sought out 
their botanical treasures.
The next source of information in order of date is the 
herbarium of Roberts Leyland.
It contains about no species 
of mosses, collected within the parish, and many more from the 
doughs just over the borders on the Lancashire side.
The 
majority of the packets are dated 1834 and 1835.
One speci- 
men, Ovthotricum crispum, was collected on trees in Ogden 
Clough, November 14th, 1819, and is still in very good exam- 
inable condition.
Many packets afford evidence that both 
Gibson and Nowell communicated mosses to this herbarium.
It is now at Belle Vue, and the mosses are stored in a series of 
card-board boxes, each with a printed index of its contents.
I am sorry to say the last of the series is missing : this is to be 
regretted, seeing that several interesting Hypnums come at the 
end.
There is another collection of mosses at the same place, 
presented by Colonel Akroyd, but being mostly from other 
districts, these do not afford much local information.
Nowell's portfolio of British mosses, now in the safe custody 
of the librarian at the Free Public Library, Todmorden, has 
been examined.
It is in a good state of preservation, and 
contains, amongst others, 147 species collected within a few 
miles of Todmorden.
The only drawback connected with this 
collection, is, that in many instances, the exact station and 
date when and where the moss was found are not given.
In 
such cases " Near Todmorden " may mean either the Lanca- 
shire or the Yorkshire side of the boundary.
This omission 
THE FLORA OF HALIFAX.
147 
might have been remedied had not a large quantity of Nowell's 
duplicates been burnt as rubbish about the year 1898.
This, 
I am informed, was prior to the effects of the late Todmorden 
Botanical Society (which included Nowell's specimens) being 
handed over to the Todmorden Corporation.
There is a 
probability that the destroyed packets would have revealed the 
information we are now in want of.
That it was Nowell's 
custom to fully label his specimens may be learnt from a glance 
at a few of his packets found in Leyland's herbarium.
A few 
still remain in the Todmorden Library, similarly endorsed with 
all the necessary particulars.
The arrangement of his portfolio 
was probably one of Nowell's latest works, for the names 
attached to some of the mosses are more modern than those 
employed by him in Baines' Flora and the Supplement.
The Floras containing most records for this district, fur- 
nished by Gibson and Nowell, are " Baines' Flora of Yorkshire " 
(1840); "Supplement" to the same (1854); an d "Wilson's 
Bryologia Britannica" (1855).
To these, the information was 
communicated direct: the moss portion of the "Supplement" 
being compiled by Nowell himself.
Evidence of Nowell's 
work also appears in Braithwaite's British Moss Flora.
Now- 
ell's records are handed on in Miall and Carrington's Flora 
of the West Riding (1862), and in Dr. F.
A. Lees' most 
valuable Flora of West Yorkshire (1888).
Dr. Lees' Flora 
also includes much local work in this branch of botany done 
by Messrs.
T. and A.
Stansfield, C.
P. Hobkirk, G.
E. Hunt, 
Wm. West and others.
The present work further incorporates the results of recent 
investigations by James Needham, Hebden Bridge, the late 
H. T.
Soppitt and the writer.
Several new records, and 
numerous additional habitats for the older ones have been 
added.
The classification of the Orders, Genera, and Species, with 
the exception of the Sphagnaceae, is that of H.
N. Dixon's 
"Student's Handbook of British Mosses" (1896).
This very 
helpful handbook, with its supplementary catalogue (1897), is 
the one at present most in use by British bryological students.
It is likely to remain so for some time to come, though further 
changes are pending owing to the results of recent closer 
research into the natural affinities within this race of plants.
In the arrangement and nomenclature of the Sphagnaceae, 
I have been guided by a recently published work on " The 
European Sphagnaceae," by Dr. Warnstorf.
An English 
I.[S THE FLORA OF HALIFAX.
translation by Mr. C.
E. Horrell, F.L.S., appeared in the 
Journal of Botany for 1900.
Dr. Warnstorf's investigation 
into the comparative morphology of this very distinct group of 
plants has extended over a period of 30 years.
His long con- 
tinued researches have led him to formulate a new system of 
classification based largely on the structure, form, and relative 
position of the two kinds of cells, of which the leaves of both 
stem and branch principally consist.
This new system may 
be said to be more natural than the old, in that it goes deeper 
into the structural characters by which nature has separated 
one " species " from another.
There is so much to recommend 
it that it has already been generally adopted by both Contin- 
ental and American bryologists.
If it has a drawback at all, 
it is in the multiplication of what we understand as " species." 
Still, if these can be proved to be distinct from each other, and 
fairly constant in their structure, it is a move in the right 
direction.
Authors' names and synonyms having been more fully 
published in Braithwaite's than in any other British Moss 
Flora, they are given as found there.
In cases where the 
names of the authorities are cited, the one in brackets is the 
original author of the species, while the other is responsible for 
the name of the genus.
Where one author only is given, 
unbracketed, he is understood to be sponsor for both generic 
and specific names.
Though this system often entails the 
citing of two authors, it ensures that the name of the original 
is not lost sight of.
For example : â€” 
Bvyum truncatulum Linneus 
= Gymnostomum truncatulum (Lin.) Hedwig 
= Pottia truncatula (Lin.) Turner.
Synonymy has been carried no further than was necessary to 
enable anyone to compare the list with those of the floras 
quoted.
Common names have been very sparingly bestowed upon 
mosses.
None but a few of the larger, commoner and more 
easily recognised species bear them, viz : Bog-moss, Pack- 
moss (Sphagnum), Feather-moss (Hypnum), and one or two 
others.
The majority are too small and inconspicuous to come 
under general observation as distinct things, hence are com- 
monly included under the one term, "moss." This is not 
sufficient for scientific purposes.
Each must have a generic 
and specific appelative.
Fortunately, in most cases the latter 
THE FLORA OF HALIFAX.
149 
represents some characteristic feature connected with the plant 
itself, or its habitat : â€” Andrea crassi-nevva = thick nerved 
Andrea ; Bryum argenteum = silvery Bryum ; Bryum alpinum 
= Alpine or mountain Bryum, etc.
Most of them are at once 
apparent and suggestive, and answer all purposes.
In works 
where so called popular names are added, they are mere 
translations of the technical terms, so we do not propose to 
encumber the list with them.
Short explanatory or critical notes are added to many of 
the records when deemed necessary, or considered of sufficient 
value or interest.
Observations on local distribution and moss-associations 
are deferred until the completion of the list.
Geographical distribution throughout Britain, has not yet 
been worked out and analysed so elaborately as that of the 
flowering plants and ferns.
This lack of information renders 
it impossible to give a census number under each species to 
indicate whether it is wide spread, or is confined to one, or a 
few limited areas.
Among the mosses there are few, if any, denizens or aliens 
to deal with.
One stranger though has recently appeared.
Last year (1900) Mr. Needham gathered Ulota phyllantha near 
the bobbin-turning works of Messrs.
Roberts and Hirst, Cote 
Hill, Warley.
It was on an ash-tree trunk brought from 
Ireland, and was still living and vigorous.
When any doubt has been felt regarding the identity of any 
species, either old or recently gathered, the specimen has been 
submitted to some experienced bryologist for his opinion.
Occasionally two authorities have been consulted respecting 
the same species.

It varies considerably in habit according to 
situation ; when submerged it becomes very robust with 
tumid, close-set branches ; if given plenty of floating 
room the stems attain to 16 or 20 inches in length, often 
it is very much smaller, the two extreme forms being 
strikingly dissimilar.
It also varies much in colour, and 
may be found light or dark green, or with a tinge of red, 
purple, brown, or even black.

to be little more than a variety of A.
Rothii, with an 
extremely narrow lamina reduced to one or two series of 
cells above, and occasionally disappearing entirely just

Very common in all the moist woods, especially about 
decaying tree-stumps which it often literally clothes.
It 
also flourishes abundantly on the stems of dead ferns, 
drooping over the edges of moist woodland banks.
So 
far as our observations have gone in this district it is 
invariably barren of capsules.
Its method of vegetative 
reproduction is so successful that it has no need to form 
capsules and spores.
There are some specimens in fine 
fruit in Leyland's Herbarium, gathered in Stiperden 
Clough just outside the parish, in 1836.
It may occasion- 
ally fruit still in some out-of-the-way corner of the district, 
and have escaped detection.
Instead of the ordinary moss 
capsule and spores, it produces a cup filled with gemmae 
at the apex of the stem.

Though considered a rare moss in many districts it is very 
abundant along the course of the Calder and tributaries 
above Mytholmroyd.
It gradually decreases in quantity 
as the doughs open out on to the moorlands.
At the foot 
of Paddock Beck, about a mile above the Crimsworth 
Dean Falls, it ceases suddenly, but follows the other fork 
of the stream (Grain Water) a little higher.
It ceases 
in Spa Clough, Booth Dean, at 11 50 feet.
It confines 
itself to stream courses, appropriating the little sand-banks 
on the sides, and is often seen in mid-stream between 
sand-bedded boulders.
It has also been noticed in a 
great sheet on the dam-stones below Wade Wood.
It 
may be known at a good distance by its closely packed, 
I58 THE FLORA OF HALIFAX.
pale green cushions.
It is rather like Milium hornum but 
has a denser habit of growth.
The plants are always male 
or barren.
Mr. Soppitt noticed it near Sterne Mill, in 
in 1895, on the Norland side of the river.
It was discovered as a distinct species in this district by 
Nowell.
In a paper " On Some Rare Mosses at Tod- 
morden " read before the Todmorden Botanical Society, 
March 1866, he says " The little known Atrichum 
laxifolium Wils.
M.S.
= A.
cvispum Sullivant, was first 
brought into notice in this neighbourhood, either as a 
curious form of A .
undulatum, or a new species, but not 
having been found in fruit here, it was not much noticed 
until a Mr. James of New Jersey, North America, sent it 
in fruit unnamed, along with other plants to Mr. Wilson, 
having met with it in fruit in New Jersey.
Mr. Wilson 
made it out to be identical with our plant.
Only the 
male plant has yet been found in Britain.
Dr. Schimper 
says that it is new to Europe.
It is found in nearly all 
the rocky moorland streams in this district, and it has 
also been found in similar places in Saddleworth, but I 
have not heard of its being found further north than here."

Although Braithwaite gives P.

Dixon places strictum as a subspecies of P.

them, though chiefly comparative and insufficient to 
justify giving it specific rank, are fairly stable, and it 
seems to fill its right place as a sub-species."

Barren in both localities.
Possibly barren forms of this species have often been taken 
for P.
commune.
When seen in fruit, it is quite easy to 
distinguish between the two, but, unfortunately neither of 
them fruits freely in this district at present.
The 4- 
angled, pale red-brown capsule of P.
commune is markedly 
different from that of P.
formosum, which is 5-6 angled, 
and fawn colour when ripe.
In barren plants, a trans- 
verse section through the middle of a fully developed leaf 
will clear away any doubt as to which of the two species 
is being dealt with ; in P.
commune the marginal cells of 
the lamellae are bifid, while those of P.
formosum are entire.

This curious little moss differs from all others in the simple 
structure of its capsule, which is very rudimentary in 
comparison with those of all other genera.
There is no 
differentiation of the internal tissue into columella and 
spore-forming cells.
No columella is produced.
The 
spores are formed by the division into four of a limited 
number (3 or 4) of spore mother- cells lying near the base.
These features have induced some bryologists to place 
Archidium in an Order to itself.
" The present is the 
only European species, but there are several closely allied 
species in N.
America" (Dixon).

This moss grows in great profusion and fruits most abun- 
dantly.
It is very conspicuous in April and May, with its 
new crop of capsules borne on purple shining setae.
It 
varies much in general appearance according to age or 
situation, especially when not in fruit.
The micro-char- 
acters of the leaves are, however, constant.
The narrow, 
inclined, slightly furrowed capsule, with conical lid, and 
minute papilla at the base, and purple stalk, are the surest 
features by which it may be recognised in the field.
This 
species is stated to be common " not only throughout 
Britain, but in all parts of the world."

First British record.
Mr. Wheldon has submitted specimens to M.

to be as above.
Mr. Wheldon adds, "It is a frequent plant on 
heathery and grassy places on the W.
Lancashire 
moorlands, and is recorded in the Channel Islands.
1JO THE FLORA OF HALIFAX.
It is near the var.
orthophyllum, Milde., but differs 
in the terminal leaves being much longer and more 
flexuose, concave but not tubular, strongly toothed 
both on margin and back.
It is a plant I have 
frequently gathered here (W.
Lane), and have 
usually regarded it as coming between the type and 
the var.
ovthophyllum.
You had better put it on 
record in your paper, as the Channel Island plant 
was only recorded in a French article."

The fact that this moss is mostly found on dripping limestone 
rocks, and only occasionally on sandstone, provides reason- 
able room for considering that this record may be an error ; 
but seeing that it is "occasionally found on sandstcne," 
and is " not uncommon," it would be unsafe to say point 
blank that it is one.
Unfortunately, Bolton left no local- 
ities for his mosses, or the place might be specially 
searched.

135 (as well as 
his O.
Hutchinsice from the same place) was a variety of 
0. saxatile" ( = 0.
anomalum).
Unfortunately, Gibson's 
High Greenwood specimens, upon which the record was 
based, are now unattainable, so that the record cannot be 
checked by a re-examination of his moss.
I have seen a 
copy of Baines' Supp., in which the record appears in MS.
Leyland's specimens (labelled 0.
Drummondii) were col- 
lected at Gibson Wood, about a mile lower down the 
valley, and there is every reason to believe they were 
collected by Gibson.
These have been carefully exam- 
ined, and also submitted to H.
N. Dixon and M.
B. Slater, 
both of whom considered them to be correctly labelled, 
" and certainly not O.
saxatile." The records are further 
confirmed by an examination of a packet in Herb.
Leyl.
marked " Ortlwtrichum Hutchinsice, Dick-Booth, near Hep- 
tonstall." Of the contents of this Mr. Dixon says : 
" these also may be safely referred to U.
Drummondii.
Mr. Slater's opinion is exactly the same.

Common in the water-runs of Luddenden Dean ; Crims-

Ings ; Binnroyd Clough ; High-lee Clough ; Hollock 
Lea, and numerous other places.
This moss as its name 
indicates, loves spring- heads where it may invariably be 
found.
It follows the rills down the hill-sides and into 
the deans.
Though its home is by the side of the stream- 
let, it will grow freely in the company of Sphagnum, or 
even among grass, in very wet places.
Like most other 
common mosses it is very variable.

A new- 
British record.
This variety was described as a new species in 1893 
by Limpricht under the name of Philonntis laxa, 
founded on specimens collected near Lake Zurich.
By the aid of Dr. C.
Warnstorf of Neu Ruppin, 
Mr. Dixon has compared the Lake Zurich and the 
Crimsworth Dean plants and established their 
identity.
In his " Note on Philonotis laxa, Limp." 
in Journal of Botany, Mr. Dixon has shown that 
the moss must be ranked merely as a variety of 
P. fontanel, and he has named it ampliretis, as the 
name laxa had already been given to another var.
of Philonotis.

HEPATIOE.
INTRODUCTION.
THE greater part of the introduction to the Moss- Flora 
applies equally to the Hepaticae.
Bolton's records form 
the basis of the following list.
He enumerated twenty-nine or 
thirty species, two being included under the mosses.
They 
were mostly first records for the county, and nearly all have 
been recently confirmed.
So far as we know, the next pub- 
lished records are contained in "A List of Musci and Hepaticae 
of Yorkshire," by the late Dr. Spruce, in the " Phytologist,'* 
Vol. ii.
pp.
147-157, (1845).
These were communicated to 
Spruce by J.
Nowell, from the Todmorden district.
Unfor- 
tunately this list was overlooked when the Moss- Flora was 
compiled.
Leyland's Herbarium contains thirty species also 
supplied by Nowell, who continued to add to our knowledge 
of the local and county distribution of these beautiful but 
minute plants.
Subsequent lists are to be found in the West 
Riding Floras of Miall and Carrington, and of F.
A. Lees.
A 
few are recorded in C.
B. Hobkirk's History of Huddersfield, 
1868, and in Pearson's List of Yorkshire Hepaticae, "Nat." 
1876.
The Messrs.
T. & A.
Stansfield, Todmorden, H.
F. 
Parsons, and others, contributed many records for the Calder 
area to Lees' Flora 
204 
THE FLORA OF HALIFAX 
When the latter flora was published the number of Hep- 
atics given for the Riding was 108.
The present list contains 
70 for the parish and includes one new to Yorkshire, three to 
the West Riding, and five to the Calder drainage area.
Prob- 
ably this number will be added to by future investigators.
The district being largely subalpine, with great stretches of 
wet moorland, and many moist, wooded doughs, is very suitable 
for this class of plant.
I have adopted the classification and terminology used by 
W. H.
Pearson in his finely illustrated work "The Hepaticae 
of the British Isles," (Lovell Reeve & Co., 1899- 1902).
This has been done the more readily because Pearson's great 
work is likely to be the standard one, for many years to come, 
in this branch of systematic botany.
Symes M.
Macvicars' 
very useful " Key to the British Hepaticae " is on the same 
lines.
The arrangement differs a little from that of preceding 
floras, and from the London Catalogue of British Mosses and 
Hepaticae, 1881, also from Canon Lett's Hepatics of the 
British Islands, 1902.
My thanks are due to Messrs.
M. B.
Slater, Malton, W.
H. Pearson, Manchester, and S.
M. Macvicar, Invermoidart, 
for kind aid in determining critical species; and to Messrs.
J.

The lobule on the lower side of the leaf in this species in-

create a new genus (Nowellia) for it.
Dr. Spruce, how- 
ever, in his work "On Cephalozia and Allied Genera" 
does not consider this feature, although " not shared by 
any other true Cephalozia," of sufficient value to separate 
it from this genus, especially as it is not absolutely con- 
stant.

LICHENES.
UNDER Lichens Bolton enumerates eighty-three species 
(Nos. 316-398), and remarks, " Beside the foregoing, 
there will be left with the Publisher, for the inspection of the 
Curious, three Prints of non-descript Lichens, containing 
about forty species, most of which are found in the Parish of 
Halifax." Probably these then " non-descripts " would be 
determined in after years by this persevering botanist, but, so 
far as we are aware, no record of them has been kept.
There 
is a solitary example from Bolton's own collection in Herb.
Leyl.
but the specimen (Pavmelia glomulifera Ach.) was 
gathered at Llanberris.
Sixty-six of the eighty-three 
species can be satisfactorily traced, but the identity of 
the remaining seventeen has been obscured in their passage 
through a maze of synonyms.
They are consequently omitted 
from this list.
Many of these early records have been con- 
firmed, mostly in the case of species which are of general, 
frequent, or common occurrence.
But our ever increasingly 
impure atmosphere has been responsible for the extinction of 
many species in this district.
These apparently robust plants, 
which can fasten themselves so tenaciously to bare rocks and 
stones and the bark of trees, are really of a very delicate 
nature, and do not come to perfection in a smoky locality.
Some of the hardiest are still struggling on away from the 
towns, while others do not get beyond a rudimentary stage of 
their existence.
In the eastern part of the parish there are 
practically no lichens.
Leyland's Herbarium contains between thirty and forty 
local species collected by S.
Gibson, J.
Nowell, and others.
There are also upwards of 60 numbered packets containing 
Lichens, in a drawer, but, unfortunately, none of them are 
dated, localised, or named.
They are simply accompanied by 
the following : " Lichens collected chiefly in the neighbourhood 
of Heptonstall by S.
Gibson " ; so that they are useless for the 
present purpose.
A few of the records are by Dr. Carrington, Mr. J.
G. 
Baker, and others, published in Mudd's Manual of British 
Lichens (1861), and Leighton's Lichen Flora.
Mr. T.
Stans- 
field, Todmorden, appears to have laboured diligently at one 
time about Todmorden, and between 30 and 40 species are 
placed to his credit in Lees' Flora.
2l6 THE FLORA OF HALIFAX.
Very little work in this branch has been done during the 
last two decades.
Mr. J.
Needham and the writer have 
collected a few incidentally from time to time.
These have 
been submitted for identification to Mr. Thos.
Hebden, of 
Cullingworth, a most painstaking and reliable authority.
We 
here tender him our thanks for his great kindness.
The classification is that of the Rev. W.
A. Leighton's 
Lichen Flora of Great Britain and the Channel Islands, 3rd 
Ed., 1879.
Only such synonyms are given as are necessary to 
identify the present terminology with that employed in Bolton's 
Catalogue and Leyland's Herbarium.

J.A.M. considers the lichen so common on the trees in 
Pecket and other woods, recorded as L.
vavia on p.
224, to 
be L.
conizczoides, Nyl., and the one on bilberry stems to be 
L. conizaa, Ach. He remarks, "so far as I can see L.
conizceoides hardly deserves separating from L.
conizcea, but 
the thallus is more granular and the margin of the 
apothecia rather different.
It is, as it were, intermediate 
between L.
varia and L.
conizcea." 
Crombie (Lich.
Brit.
1870) places L.
conizcea among the 
varieties of L.
vavia.
In addition to Mr. Hebden's aid in compiling the above 
list of lichens, Mr. J.
A. Martindale, of Staveley, near Kendal, 
was consulted respecting the elucidation of a few of the more 
obscure connections between the names as given in Hudson's 
Flora Anglica, Ed. I.
(1762), Ed. II.
(1778), Bolton's list (1775), 
and the modern synonyms employed in Leighton's Lichen 
Flora.
Unfortunately, this was after pp.
215-216 were in 
print.
Mr. Martindale, at once, kindly undertook an indepen- 
dent revision of the whole of Bolton's list of 83 species.
This 
has enabled us to incorporate 81, along with a few most 
valuable remarks anent certain of them ; and we here give 
him our most hearty thanks.
It is rather remarkable that, of the 85 species contained in 
the first edition of Hudson, Bolton should have met with no 
fewer than 83 in the parish of Halifax.
Doubtless he sent 
Hudson specimens of most, if not all, of the lichens he col- 
lected, and he is thanked, along with five or six other botan- 
ists, by Dr. Hudson, in the preface to both Eds. I and II of 
his Flora, for great assistance rendered in their produc- 
tion.

ALG/E.
THE bulk of the following list of local Algae is compiled 
from the ' Alga-Flora of Yorkshire ' : Transactions of the 
Yorkshire Naturalists' Union, Parts 22, 23, 25, 27, igoo-01, by 
W. West, F.L.S., and G.
S. West, B.A., A.R.C.S.
Messrs.
W T .
West and sons have visited the parish on 
many occasions to collect algae, etc., mostly in Crimsworth 
Dean, Cragg Vale towards Blackstone Edge, Ogden Clough, 
Greetland, and Fixby.
Very little has been done in this branch by resident botan- 
ists.
The late Thos.
Carnell occasionally made collections.
Some years ago the writer made a number of sketches of 
Desmids, Diatoms, etc., collected in the spring-water pond 
near Park Gate Farm, Southowram, and other places ; these 
have been verified by Messrs.
W. West and R.
H. Philip.
When the number of springs in all parts of the parish is 
taken into account, along with the numerous moorland bogs 
and swamps, the Alga-Flora would prove a very rich one if 
thoroughly worked out.
The sign !
denotes that the species has been met with by 
the writer.

records are by the Messrs.

THE PUNGUSFLORA.
CHARLES CROSSLAND, F.L.S.
INTRODUCTION.
THE basis of this branch of the Flora, as of all the others, 
lies in Bolton's Catalogue, which enumerates 55 species, 
Nos. 434-489.
In the case of the Ferns and Fungi, the Cata- 
logue was supplemented by illustrated works ; the one on 
Fungi being limited in scope to this locality.
This (vide the 
General Introduction, p.
lii.) includes 231 species, most of 
which were either new species, or new British records.
Hymenomycetes in the shape of Agarics, Polypores, Clavarias, 
etc., make up 138, the rest were miscellaneous.
In addition, 
there are a number of coloured drawings of fungi (vide I.e.
p. liv.) in the British Museum.
These the writer has had the 
pleasure of examining.
Taken as a whole, Bolton's drawings 
are representative of many and various orders, and are exten- 
sively quoted in the systematic mycological works of Berkeley, 
Fries, Cooke, Stevenson, Rabenhorst, Massee, and others.
Close upon 220 of the 230 or 240 species figured, may safely 
be included in the present list.
We are unable to identify 
definitely a few of the smaller ones ; nor can this be wondered 
at when, even at the present day, it requires in some instances, 
a magnification of 300 to 400 diameters to distinguish, by aid 
of the spores, one species from another.
After Bolton's death no local botanist appears to have 
studied this branch, until the present writer commenced in 
1888, under the wing of the Yorkshire Naturalists' Union.
Dr. F.
H. Parsons, of Goole, and Mr. W.
West recorded a 
few in " The Naturalist," collected during Y.N.U. excursions 
into this district.
The Huddersfield Naturalists' Society 
record in their Circular (1883) several found at Grimscar } 
Fixby, Rastrick, etc.
All these, and many of Bolton's, are 
incorporated in Lees' Flora of West Yorkshire.
238 THE FLORA OF HALIFAX.
Between 1889 and the present year (1903), Mr. Need ham has 
collected an immense amount of material about Hebden 
Bridge.
In 1894 ^ lr - H.
T. Soppitt commenced to take an 
active part in local investigations, and continued until within 
a few weeks of his death, in 1899.
He brought to light 
several most interesting micro-species (Hx. Nat., Vol. IV., 
pp.
31-36).
The Hebden Bridge district has yielded the 
greatest weight of material ; Luddenden Dean, North Dean 
Wood, and Elland Park Wood coming next.
Shibden and 
Wheatley, where Bolton found many of the specimens he 
figured, have been rather neglected in favour of what were 
considered more prolific places.
At present they are lacking 
in moist, shaded woodlands ; and small, open, dry plantations 
are not of much use from a mycological standpoint, though 
such places do occasionally produce rare things.
Special 
efforts have been made to find micro-species, and with marked 
success.
The total number of fungi met with in the parish up to the 
present is 1105.
Since 1889, thirteen species new to science 
have been discovered, and twenty-three new to Britain.
In 
the meantime, 350 have been figured in natural colours.
These drawings are accompanied by copious notes, in some 
cases amounting to a re-description of the species, with many 
hitherto neglected micr scopic characters added.
Mr. Massee, 
of the Royal Herbariuir, Kew, has been afforded opportunities 
of revising and completing the diagnosis of numerous insuffici- 
ently described species from material sent him from this 
district.
A few of Bolton's species, not met with anywhere 
between his time and the present, have been re-discovered, 
notably Coprimes oblectus, Tab. 142 (' Nat.,' Dec. 1902).
Pholiota dura (Bolton) Tab. 67, f.
I., has also been confirmed.
Others of his have not since been found, but it is yet possible 
they may be.
The parish is not by any means exhausted, either 
for the confirmation of old records, or the finding of new 
species ; even while this was being written, Mr. U.
Bairstow 
has brought me a most handsome toadstool, Lentinus squamosus, 
new to Britain, found growing on some wood- work in his 
garden in Halifax.
For various reasons students of fungi are comparatively 
few, but, during the last two or three decades, there has been 
an awakening to the fact that from a biological point of view, 
"the study of fungi cannot be ignored by anyone desirous of 
THE FLORA OF HALIFAX.
239 
becoming acquainted with the various processes of life." In 
comparison with other plants, their systematic study is 
difficult.
Some of them cannot be preserved at all â€” thev 
putresce ; and those that do dry, so shrivel up in the process, 
that little of their original character remains.
Careful draw- 
ing is the best means of dealing with them for systematic 
purposes.
Another difficulty is.
that we are never sure of 
seeing a second time those that we may want.
Some certainly 
reappear, year after year, in the same place, or under similar 
conditions in fresh places, and one can always rely upon find- 
ing them at the proper time, if needed.
Others are very 
inconstant in their appearance : they may be found once and 
not again, perhaps for years, if at all.
Scores we never have 
seen but once, although many of them have been carefully and 
repeatedly sought for in the same and similar places.
This 
applies to macro- and micro-species alike.
Two instances may 
be given.
Pocillum Needhami was found by Mr. J.
T. Aspin 
and myself on fallen oak-leaves in Elland Park Wood, in 
1S94, and proved to be a new species.
All the specimens, 
after drawings and descriptions had been taken, were sent to 
Kew. More were sought for.
The place has been visited times 
out of number, year after year, and thousands of dead oak- 
leaves carefully examined, all to no purpose ; no trace of it has 
since been found either there or anywhere else.
Two speci- 
mens only of another very distinct new species, Lactarius 
glaucescens, were found in Wade Wood, Luddenden Dean, in 
1S99, and one in North Dean Wood the year following, but 
all search for more has been in vain.
Half these specimens 
are at Kew, and half at the British Museum (Natural History).
There is another peculiarity to note in connection with 
fungi.
Species occasionally appear in vast abundance in a 
place for one, two, or three years in succession, then totallv 
disappear, and are seen no more for years, if ever, at that 
place.
Desmazievella acicola, a most beautiful saucer-shaped 
fungus, which grows only on dead pine-needles, was found by 
Mr. Needham in hundreds in Crimsworth Dean in 1897.
They vanished the same year and have not since reappeared.
Fungi seem to have periods of virulence in one locality and 
then die out, or move on to fresh fields of action.
Numerous unknown species, of which only two or three 
specimens were discovered, are laid on one side, along with 
such drawings and descriptions as could be taken at the time, 
24O THE FLORA OF HALIFAX.
awaiting the finding of more ample material to submit to 
acknowledged authorities in special branches.
No species of doubtful determination has been included in 
the list so far as we know.
A host of unreliable names has 
not been our object.
All the recent species here recorded have 
passed through the writer's hands.
His thanks are due and are 
cordially paid to Dr. M.
C. Cooke, A.L.S., Mr. G.
Massee, 
F.L.S., V.M. H., Royal Herbarium, Kew, Mr. Worthington 
G. Smith, British Museum (Nat. Hist.), Prof.
Dr. H.
Rehm, 
Munich, Dr. E.
Boudier, Montmorency, and others for valu- 
able assistance rendered by examining material submitted to 
them.
In a very special sense are they due to Mr. Massee.
The classification adopted is that of Prof.
Saccardo's 
" Sylloge Fungorum," with a few slight exceptions.
Bolton's 
names in many cases vary from those at present in use, but it 
has been thought quite sufficient to give the plate (Tab.) 
number, and thus avoid cumbering the pages with synonyms.

I. Gxcluded Aliens.
SUCH alien species as are not admitted into the London 
Catalogue, but have occurred casually in the district, 
were omitted from the body of the Flora and are now 
brought together.
Ten years ago they were more common 
than now, and one or two localities where they were to be 
found every season have ceased to be productive, as they no 
longer serve the purpose of tips.
Most of the aliens have 
occurred either on woollen waste as at Dapper Mill and Box 
Trees Mill, both in Wheatley valley (collected by Mr. J.
T. 
Aspin principally) ; on corn screenings at Sterne Mill (now no 
longer a corn mill) ; or about the malt-kilns and corn mills on 
the canal side at Elland.
In each case the species has been 
named by the authorities at Kew 7 , to whom our thanks are 
tendered, and in many cases a specimen is in existence.

A specimen from Halifax, along 
with Rubus Channvmovus and Tvientalis, all contributed 
by Beaumont, is preserved in the Motley Herbarium at 
Swansea, date about 1840.
(See article by Rev. H.
J. 
Riddelsdell, in Naturalist for 1902, p.
345).
Beaumont 
also furnished plants from the Lake District and Scar- 
borough, and one can only surmise that the wrong 
locality has been attached, and that in all probability 
the specimen came from Scarborough.] 
30S THE FLORA OF HALIFAX.
Galium Cruciata (p.
51).
A warning is furnished me by Mr.
J. Needham that a bed of this at the side of Lee Mill 
Lane, Hebden Bridge, now three or four feet in extent 
originated accidentally.
In the summer of 1889 he had 
this and other plants sent from Bedale in his vasculum, 
and having emptied the contents over the wall here, in 
order to use it on a ramble, he observed later in the 
season that the crosswort had established itself.
The 
importance of the incident lies in its application to other 
cases where the origin of a species in a particular 
locality is, and must remain, a matter of conjecture.
