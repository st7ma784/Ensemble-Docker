NEW OR NOTEWORTHY FUNGI :— Part II.
By W.
B. Grove, B.A.
(Tabs.
256, 257.) 
This list of new or rare British Fungi is, for the most part, 
identical with a paper read before the Birmingham Natural 
History and Microscopical Society, December 2nd, 1884.
The 
remarks which preceded Part I.
(Journ.
Bot., May 1884), are 
applicable to this also.

crystals.
On dead wood, Bradnock's Marsh (Wk.), July, Mr. Bucknall, 
having seen my specimens, agrees with me that they are identical 
with his.
Hitherto recorded only on leaves or herbaceous stems, 
but he believes that he has also found this species on dead wood.

round or oval, about 300 /x in diam., very convex; epidermis per- 
sistent, dark brown below, hyaline and at length ruptured above ; 
uredo spores oval, obovate, roundish or oblong, surrounded by a 
very thick, warted, colourless membrane, pale yellow with a few 
oily drops, 30-50 /x x 20-24 /a ; paraphyses forming a single ring 
surrounding the sorus, just within the epidermis, dark brown, 
shining, oblong-cylindrical, clavate above, inclining inwards 
towards the spores, 80-100 p.

The sori 
appear very dark below, owing to the paraphyses showing 
through.

compositarum, is distinguished from the (E.
taraxaci K.
et S.
Avhich is stated to be a stage of P.
si/Ivatica Schr., by the very 
numerous peridia, not seated on discoloured spots, " spreading 
over the whole leaf, and generally collected into numerous little 
clusters with single ones scattered between them " (Grev.
L c).
Specimens of both, collected by Mr. H.
T. Soppitt, now lie before 
me.
Mr. Soppitt has experimented with (E.
Grevillei, and ia 
convinced that it is the I.
stage of P.
variabilis.
He generally 
finds them both together, the upper leaves^affected by the (Ecidium, 
the lower ones by the Puccinia ; after laying leaves affected with 
the (Ecidium on a dandelion plant, covered with a bell-glass, in his 
garden, he found the Puccinia appear in about fourteen days.
Mr.
Soppitt's specimens of (Ecidium Grevillei are from Grassington, 
Yorks., August.
Dr. AVinter's view of uniting P.
variabilis with 
his P.
Jiosculosonwi (compositarum) is inexplicable.

as the incomplete description enables me to judge, only in the 
habitat and the larger sporidia, which are stated to be " unusually

NOTES ON THE FLOEA OF CEYLON.
By Henry Trimen, M.B., F.L.S.
The last Part of the late Dr. Thwaites' ' Enumeratio Plant.
Zeylaniffi' was published in 1864, and, besides completing the 
systematic enumeration of the plants of Ceylon to the end of the 
Vascular Cryptogams, contained two appendices (extending to 46 
pages) of Addenda and Corrigenda, thus bringing the earlier 
portions of the book (which began to appear in 1858) up to the 
date of its conclusion.
The numbered series of exsiccata, well known as " C.
P.," had 
been previously made up and widely distributed by Thwaites ; 
their numbers are systematically quoted througliout the book, and 
are, in the supplements above mentioned, carried on up to C, P.
3860 inclusive.
After the completion of the ' Enumeratio ' the C.
P. numera- 
tion was still kept on, as new species or varieties were detected in 
the Island, or as further research showed the necessity of breaking 
up some of the previously recorded ones into two.
In this way 
164 additional C.
P. numbers were given, and the series was 
extended from C.
P. 3861 to 4024, which number is absolutely the 
last.
Many of these additional numbers have been sent out from 
Peradeniya to the public herbaria of Em-ope and Asia and to 
private collections, and not a few have been quoted by authors of 
recent monographs and descriptive treatises.
It will therefore, I 
believe, be of use to give a list of them with their determinations, 
NOTES ON THE FLORA OF CEYLON.
idd 
as represented in the Peradeuiya herbarium, which in any case of 
doubt must be considered as the type series.
I may note tliat very nearly all these additional numbers refer 
to plants collected between 1864 and 1869.
After this latter year 
Dr. Thwaites turned his attention, so far as Botany is concerned, 
almost exclusively to the Lower Cryptogams, and although his 
collectors brought in a few additional Flowering Plants, only two or 
three C.
P. numbers refer to any year after 1869.
In the following determinations I have been often assisted by 
the staff of the herbariums at Kew and at the Natural History 
(British) Museum and have especially to thank Mr. Hemsley of the 
former establishment, and Mr. H.
N. Kidley of the latter, for their 
prompt attention to my enquiries.

NOTES ON THE FLORA OF CEYLON, 141 
In addition to tbe plants in the above list, a considerable 
number of species has been recorded from Ceylon in various 
systematic treatises (and especially in the ' Flora of British India,* 
now in course of publication), which were not included in the 
' Enumeratio.' Of these most were collected by Col. and Mrs.
Walker, in the years 1830-1840, entirely in the south-western and 
southern parts of the Island, and have not been met with by 
subsequent collectors.
Some of their gatherings were garden 
plants however.
The collector was MacEae, who had charge 
of Peradeniya Gardens from 1827 to 1830 ; many of the plants 
sent home by him as natives of Ceylon were evidently gathered in 
the gardens, and are nowhere wild in the colony ; whilst others 
are from N.
W. India, where he also collected for the Horticultural 
Society.
Some of Gardner's plants, collected by him in company 
with Wight in the Nilgiris in 1845, have also been erroneously 
given for Ceylon ; and altogether there is a rather large number of 
names to be deleted in the list of recorded Ceylouese plants.
A 
corrected and revised catalogue of the whole flora is now being 
printed at Colombo for the Asiatic Society's (Ceylon Branch) 
' Proceedings,' in which I have taken care to distinguish all 
doubtful natives and erroneous records.
During the five years I have been in Ceylon, a good many 
species (chiefly Indian) have been detected, especially in the less- 
known portions of the Island, which have not, so far as I know, 
been previously recorded.
The greater part of these have been 
met with in my own excursions through the country, but many 
have been detected by my friend Mr. W.
Ferguson, F.L.S., 
of Colombo, an excellent field botanist, who during the long 
residence of 45 years in the Colony has lost no opportunity 
of acquiring and adding to his extensive acquaintance with its 
vegetation.
Mr. H.
Nevill, of the Ceylon Civil Service, has also 
availed himself of his residence and travels in unfrequented 
districts to collect rare plants, and has thus added several species 
to our flora.
The following is a list with notes of these additions.
The few 
new or undescribed species it contains, as well as those mentioned 
by name in the above list, and a few others, will be described at 
the end of this paper.
Additions to the Floea of Ceylon.
Tinospora malaharica Miers [Menispermum Lam.).
— I can 
scarcely consider this and T.
tomentosa Miers [Menispenmim Koxb.), 
to form distinct species, but regard them rather as varieties of one.
Both are fairly common in the low country of S.W. Ceylon, and 
are not distinguished by the natives, who call them both " Pou- 
kinda," or " Wal-kinda." C.
P. 2804 includes examples of both 
forms.
In the ' Fl. Brit.
Ind.' i., p.
9G, neither are given for 
Ceylon, but in the ' Flora Indica ' of 1855, p.
182, Hooker 
mentions a Ceylon example as probably referable to T.
vudaharica.
T. crisjju Miers [Meniupcniuun L.).
— It is probable that this 
142 NOTES ON THE FLORA OF CEYLON, 
species, which has a great medicinal reputation as a bitter febri- 
fuge among the Malays, has been by them introduced to Ceylon.
It is known as " Titta-kinda," and occurs in an apparently wild 
condition.
In the neighbourhood of Kadawalla, on the Kelani 
Eiver, about ten miles from Colombo, this plant is a striking 
object, wreathing the stems of the Jak trees and Coco nuts with its 
rooted twining stems.
In January it was without flowers or fruit.
This is the Funis pelleiis of Eumph, Herb.
Amboin.
v., p.
82, whose 
figure (t.
44, f.
1 *) of the characteristic stem is very fair.
Scheffer 
has figured as T.
crispa, a plant with male flowers from the 
Buitenzorg Gardens (Obs. Bot.
iii., p.
71, t.
1), which has a longer 
and more ovate leaf than the Ceylon plant.
The localities for this 
species given in the Fl, Brit.
India — Silhet and Assam to Pegu 
and Malacca — are in favour of its nativity in Ceylon also.
It 
drops down very long thread-like roots from great heights, like T.
cordifolia.
Cleome tenella L.
f. — On the dry sandy coast at Puttalam and 
Chilaw, W.
coast, Nov. 1881.
A slender annual which quickly 
dries up and disappears.
It occurs in similar places on the 
Carnatic ; has been found in Nubia and Senegal, and doubtless 
occurs in the intermediate desert regions.
Cerastium glomeratum Thuill.
— This familiar little plant is 
common about Nuwana Eliya, 6200 ft., and may be native, as 
appears to be considered the case in similar cases in India.
Thwaites, however, thought it introduced with grass seed, like so 
many other European weeds in the mountains of Ceylon, and 
omitted it from the body of the ' Enumerafcio.' 
CaJophyUum eJatum Bedd.
? — To this I refer, with some doubt, a 
tree of which the leaves were sent to me in 1882, from the 
Devilane Forest, near Batticalon, by Capt.
Walker, Forester for the 
Eastern Province.
It has been entered imder this name, in 
Mr. Vincent's Keport on the Forests of Ceylon (Part i., pars.
106 
and 147), the native name being given as " Tombu-kata." We 
have the tree also in the gardens at Peradeniya, but I have not 
seen flowers or fruit.
Beddome's species was first named in 
' Trans.
Linn.
Soc.,' xxv.
p. 212, and is described and figured in 
his ' Fl. Sylvatica,' t.
2, and his Forest Keport for 1863-64.
It 
yields the Von spars of commerce.
In the ' Flora Brit.
Ind.' it is 
regarded as a variety of C.
tomentosum Wight, which is a very 
common species in the lower districts of Ceylon, and one of those 
called " Kiua " by the Sinhalese.
The leaves of the Batticalon 
tree are, however, very much longer and narrower, with a rounder 
base and more horizontal secondary nerves.
It may be the 
C. awjustifoliam Roxb., from Penang, of which nothing seems to be 
known.
Vatica (ibsciira Trim., n, sp.
Pavonia glechomifolia A.
Eich.
— This has been recorded for 
* Linnaus has quoted this figured correctly, but has caused confusion by 
accidentally giving the name as Funis quadrangularis, p.
83, which is fig.

the same plate.

Ceylon, I know not on what authority, in ' Fl. Brit.
India ' i., 
p. 330.
I have since found it plentifully about Tissa-maha-rama, 
an ancient place in the S.
Province, formerly of great importance.
The plant has a wide range through the drier parts of India, and 
extends to Arabia and Trop.
Africa.
Triumfetta cnnspicua Trim., n.
sp.
Grewia jMpnHfolin Vahl.
— First sent to me by H.
Nevill, Esq., 
C.C.S., in December 1881, from Puttalara, in fruit; and in that 
state not easily determinable.
I have found it abundantly in the 
Hambantota district in the south-east of the Island, and it is 
doubtless frequent in the dry coast districts.
This is a desert 
shrub, first gathered by Forskal in Arabia.
When the fruit is 
symmetrically and completely developed, which is rarely the case, 
it consists of two separable portions, each of which is didymous, 
and contains two bony pyrenes ; the pyrenes are again 2-celled, 
with a very thick and hard partition and a single seed in each cell.
The fruit is thus normally 8-seeded.
Bahamodendron Berryi Arn.
— Under the Tamil name of " Mul- 
kilivai," this is a well known hedge plant in the Jaffna district of 
the extreme north of the island, and is employed for the same 
purpose along the west coast of Ceylon as far south as Colombo, 
where alone I have seen it.
Mr. W.
Ferguson, F.L.S., to whom 
I am indebted for the above information, also tells me that it is 
obtained from wild plants in the islands of the Gulf of Mannas 
(belonging to Ceylon), especially from that one named Delft by the 
Dutch, and I regret that I have as yet had no opportunity of 
verifying the statement.
In parts of Southern India, however, I 
observed B.
Berri/i in vast abundance ; it is used for miles in 
fencing the railway line about Erode, &c., and attains fully 10 ft.
in height.
I did not see any, however, that looked wild.
At 
Trichinopoly I succeeded in getting some specimens, and Major 
Johnson, of Mettapollium, has since sent better ones from Coim- 
batore.
The Indian plant is very spiny, with thick, horizontally 
divaricate interlaced branchlets (making an almost impervious 
hedge), small rigid 8-foliate leaves with sessile obovate leaflets, — 
the terminal are much the largest, — and little clusters of 2-5 
sessile flowers.
As noticed in ' Medicinal Plants,' sub t.
59, this 
plant must be very closely allied to, if not identical with, B.
Myrrha 
Nees, figured at t.
60 of the same book, but if it afford any gum- 
resin in S.
India it is of a character very different from myrrh." 
As cultivated in Colombo, &c., the plant takes on a very 
different appearance ; the spines are more slender and much less 
numerous, the leaves much larger, usually pinnately 5- or 7-foliolate 
with serrate leaflets, and the infloresence large and compound, in 
divaricate cymes.
So unlike is this slender-growing leafy shrub to 
any Bahamodendron (except some forms of B.
africanum) that I 
* Beddome, who gives a poor figure (Fl. Sylv.
t. 126) of 7?.
Berryi, says that 
it forms a good-sized tree in the dry jungles to the east of the Nilgiris, and that 
a gum resin exudes from it.
He also notes that the Howers are frequently 
destroyed when young by some insect.
I find them generally malformed from 
this cause in Ceylon.
144 NOTES ON THE FLORA OF CEYLON.
was long in doubt as to its identity, and inclined to refer it to 
some Protium.
Prof.
Oliver, however, to whom I submitted 
specimens, was of opinion that the plant was probably merely a 
luxuriant state of B.
Bernji, and I believe him to be perfectly 
correct, the wet climate of Colombo accounting for the change.
Prutium should be combined with Balsa mode ndron, as is done 
by Wight, Marchand, Baillon and Eugler, under various names.
Both genera possess the peculiar lobed arilloid investment of the 
pyrene (" mesocarp ' in Med. Plants, t.
59) ; in B.

Vitis tomentosa Heyne.
— Found in the forest near Anurad- 
hapura, the ancient capital of Ceylon, Oct. 1883.
A rather 
handsome species, with large masses of dark vinous-red crowded 
flowers and tloccose wide-climbing stems ; justice is scarcely done 
it in Wight, Ulust.

On the mainland it is confiued to the

Cardioapermnm canescens Wall.
— This pretty climber is abundant 
and ornamental in the country round about Hambantota, covering 
the scrub with its delicate foliage and milk-white blossoms.
In 
full flower in December.
The pubescence is very minute, and 
barely justifies the specific name.
The species is found in the 
south of peninsular India, also in Burmah and Abyssinia.
Ehyiichosia densi/Ioni DC.

Bauhinia Angaina Koxb.
[B.
scandens li., pro max.

considered other than as an introduction.
I found several large 
masses of it at the foot of Doluwa Kaude, a hill about eight miles 
north of Kurunegala, and it has been reported from one or two 
other spots ; but it has not been found in flower.
A very large 
specimen in the Peradeniya Gardens has long been an object 
of curiosity and interest, but this also has never flowered.
The 
figures in the ' Hort.
Malabaricus,' viii., tt.
29-31, are sufficiently 
characteristic of the " chain-cable "-like stems; the young trailing 
shoots run extensively over the ground and root at the joints ; the 
plant is thus easily propagated either accidentally or by intention.
Acacia ptanifronsW .
& A.
— Good specimens of this characteristic 
species were sent to me in October, 1882, from the Island of 
Mannar, one of the most arid tracts in the colony.
It appears to 
be so abundant there as to be largely cut for firewood, and even 
exported to India (see Vincent's ' Report on Ceylon Forests,' pars.
98 & 121).
The Tamil name is " Odai," and the pods are said to 
be a good cattle-food.
I was greatly struck with the cedar-like 
growth of this acacia in S.
India (as seen from the railway), on the 
low rocky hills near Ayyalur Station, between Trichinopoly and 
Madura ; it is well called •' Umbrella Tree " by the English.
It is 
also frequent at Tuticorin, and plants have occasionally sprung up 
on the shore at Colombo from seeds brought no doubt with ballast 
from that neighbouring port.

THE IDENTITY OF BACTERIUM FCETIDUM Thin 
WITH SOIL COCCI.
By Spencer Le M.
Moore, F.L. S.
In the Royal Society's 'Proceedings' (xxx.
473), Dr. Thin 
described the organism found in association with profuse sweating 
of the soles of the feet to which he gave the name of BacteriutK.
fcetidum.
In the moisture which exudes from the soles, and which, 
on account of its alkaline reaction compared with the acidity of 
perspiration obtained at the same time from the general surface of 
the body.
Dr. Thin considers to be not pure sweat, but a mixture 
of sweat and serous exudation from the blood, Bacterium Jatidum is 
capable of rapid growth, the form assumed bcmg that of spherical 
cocci refracting light brightly and uniformly.
Cultivated in sterilised 
vitreous humour, the cocci were found to develop into a series of 
forms, commencnig with wedge- and canoe-shaped bodies con- 
taining each a bright coccus ; thence into short rods bearing a 
coccus or cocci at the ends or centre : these rods either became 
fragmented, the fragments clhiging together in clusters, or they 
assumed ordinary Bacterium and Bacillus form and spored, the 
150 THE IDENTITY OF BACTERIUM FCETIDUM WITH SOIL COCCI.
spores being in all respects identical with the cocci found upon 
the feet.
While examining the coccus form of Bacterium fostidum and the 
cocci of surface soil ( " corpuscules brillants" of Pasteur), I was 
struck by the great similarity between them, and determined to 
ascertain wliether the identity were real or merely apparent.
That 
there is a real identity the following experiments tend to show.
Morpholotjical proof of the idenlity of Bacterium foetiduin Thin tvith 
soil- cocci.
The method adopted was to cultivate, in imitation of Dr. Thin, 
ferment from soil lying immediately beneath the surface, and the 
Bacterium (obtained by scraping fetid socks after a short soaking 
in distilled water), in test-glasses containing vitreous humour.
As 
in Dr. Thin's experiments, the test-glasses, provided with glass 
caps and covered by a larger glass, were purified by exposure to a 
temperature above 300° Fahr.
for two hours ; the vitreous humour, 
forced through fine muslin, was sterilised by introducing it with 
care into carbolised cotton-wool plugged test-tubes previously puri- 
fied similarly to the glasses, and then kept in boiling water for 
half an hour.
The soil, freed as far as possible from traces of 
organic matter, was sifted through fine muslin before being placed 
in a test-glass.* Dr. Thin satisfied himself that his fluids were 
sterilised by the above treatment, and one of my fluids examined 
after a fortnight showed no trace of organisms.
I, however, made 
some additional experiments, with the same results as were ob- 
tained with fluids treated according to Thin's method — with fluids 
sterilised in test tubes provided with firmly secured corks previously 
soaked in creosote and turpentine, and kept in boiling water for 
several hours on three successive days.
A test-fluid so treated 
remained clear for upwards of two months, and showed no trace of 
organisms when examined.
After cultivating for two or three days in a warm chamber kept, 
by means of a Page's apparatus, at 9G°-99° Fahr., the surface of 
the liquid in Avhich the Bacterium fcetidiim.
was growing, as well as 
of that charged with soil, was covered with a firm resistant scum.
In the scum of the latter, and in the liquid below it, were found 
the series of forms now to be described.
At the first stage bright cocci are seen contained each in a 
darker wedge- or canoe-shaped envelope; their position in the canoe 
is almost always a little to one side of the centre, in the wedge 
at the wider end.
The wedge or canoe may end either sharply or 
bluntly.
Sometimes two cocci are found in association in a double 
semicanoe-shaped envelope, similar to those shown at fig.
3^ of Dr.
Thin's memoir ; but two cocci, oscillating within a single canoe (seen 
* The vitreous humour, the soil and the Bacterium were introduced into 
the purified test-glasses, uncovered, when held iar hack over an open fire and as 
near to the fire as possible.
'Vhe test-tubes were similarly opened to receive the 
vitreous humour.
This method I consider as good as, perhaps preferable to, 
the carbolic-spray method.

once by Thin) were never found in any of the cultures.
There can 
be no doubt that these cocci, similar in size and appearance to the 
" corpuscules brillants," are identical with them ; their average 
diameter is 1-35 /x.
In the next stage a short staff-like rod, 5.0 — 6-0 /x in length and 
1-0 jji.
in width, has appeared in the canoe, and standing out from it 
at its centre or end and distinguished by its greater brilliancy is the 
coccus.
In early stages of rod-formation the boundaries of the 
canoe-shaped envelope can still be traced, but they soon disappear.
Sometimes more cocci are associated with each rod ; they are then 
usually placed either singly at its ends or paired at its centre.
The 
cocci can be traced gradually dwindling away, and finally merging 
with the substance of the rods.
By simple elongation the Bacterium next reaches its Bacillus 
stage.
The Bacilli are of varying length — on an average about 
25'0 /A, but this size is often greatly surpassed, some of them 
measuring as much as 144-0 f*.
Already in cultures only three 
days old their protoplasm is, in some cases, divided into a row of 
spores reaching from end to end of the cell.
These spores — in 
every way resembling the " corpuscules brillants " — are discharged 
in great numbers by the collapse of their investing sheaths.
The other method of the rods' growth described by Dr. Thin, 
viz., their fragmentation to form small clusters, was also observed by 
me, but not frequently.
A series of figures illustrative of the chief forms assumed by the 
soil-ferment in its development were di'awn with the camera for 
comparison with the figures on Dr. Thin's plate.
The resemblance 
in every way between the two series was most striking This plate 
having unfortunately been lost, it would not be possible to replace 
it without repeating the cultures, for which I have no present 
opportunity.
It is necessary to say here that I in no way assert soil-cocci to be 
referable to Bacterium fcctidum, for I quite agree with the remark of 
a great physiologist, that my results would equally prove the non- 
specificity of Dr. Thin's organism as the specificity of the cocci.
The cocci obtained by scraping fetid socks developed the same 
series of forms as did the soil-ferment, thus proving that I really had 
Dr. Thin's organism to work with — a very important matter, as the 
immediate sequel will show.
Chemical proof of the identity of Bacterium fcptidum Thin with the 
cocci of the soil.
This part of the method consisted in testing the chemical 
deportment of soil-ferment, and of the Bacterium, when cultivated 
in various fluids, in the warm chamber at approximately the same 
range of temperature as above mentioned.
The identity is shown 
in three ways — 
(i) Both are capable of reduciiuj nitrates to nitrites.
— Into a test- 
glass containing soil-ferment growing in sterilised vitreous humour 
was introduced, under suitable precautions, a small quantity of a 
20 per cent, solution of potassium nitrate.
After six days' interval 
152 THE IDENTITY OF BACTEEIUM FCETIDUM WITH SOIL COCCI.
the liquid was tested for nitrite, into which it was fouud that part 
of the nitrate had been converted.
Bticlcriuin /(vtiihm, simiLirly 
treated, yielded the same result, but the amount of nitrite liberated 
seems to be less than in the former case, a few minutes elapsuig 
before the starch iodide was fully formed.- 
(ii) Both reduce sulphates tu sulphites, and phosphates to phosphites.
— Small quantities of a 20 per cent, solution of magnesium 
sulphate were introduced into two test-glasses containhig sterilised 
vitreous humour, charged in one case with soil-ferment, in the other 
with the Bacteriwn.
It was ascertained that part of the sulphate in 
either was reduced to sulphite after the lapse of three days.
Some Pasteur's fluid was prepared without sugar ; after growing 
in it both soil-ferment and the Bacterium, for a few days, part of the 
sulpliate (magnesium) in either was found reduced to sulphite, and of 
the I phosphates (calcium and potassium) to phosphites.
Into some filtered perspiration were placed soil and four drops 
of a 10 per cent, solution of magnesium sulphate.
Part of the 
sulphate was soon converted mto sulphite.
Sulphated perspiration 
charged with the Bacterium likewise gave the test for sulphite.
(iii) Both liberate lanje quantities of ammonia from the Jluids in 
ichich theij (/row.
— This was proved by many experiments with 
sterilised vitreous humour, and also with perspiration.
In all cases 
a copious precipitate was obtained with Nessler's test, after a few 
days' groAvth of soil-ferment and the Bacterium in the fluids.
Com- 
parison of these charged fluids with uncharged test-fluids similarly 
treated, showed that all or by far the greater part of the ammonia 
was disengaged by the growth of the soil-ferment and Bacterium, 
and that none resulted from manipulation.
In all cultures of perspiration the initial acidity gave place to 
alkalinity, due doubtless to formation of ammonia in them.
General Considerations.
According to the doctrine here advanced, access of the ferment 
to the sole of the foot must take place by the penetration of fine 
dust containing ferment through the seams of boots.
That this 
does occur is beyond a doubt ; for not only is the ferment of 
universal occurrence in surface soil derived from de230sits belonging 
to all the great geological horizons, but cocci are always to be found 
upon the feet, even under the most cleanly conditions.
Whether the ferment has any relation of causation to an 
abnormal escape of fluid from the soles is a very obscure problem.
In the case of people who perspire copiously, the ferment, silting 
through the boots and not assiduously removed, would find itself 
bathed by a fluid in which it could freely grow.
"We have seen 
that one result of its growth is the liberation of ammonia in con- 
siderable quantities.
But the alkaline reaction of the fluid, being 
doubtless due to the presence of this ammonia, is no evidence to 
* Starch and potassium iodide exposed in the room in which the experiment 
was perfoimed showed not the least trace of blueing until after the lapse of 
some time.
A NEW GENUS OF MYRTACEjE.
153 
the fluid's consisting of serous exudation from the blood as well as 
of sweat ; it may, and perhaps does, consist of perspiration alone.
It is, moreover, uncertain whether there is any increase in the 
amount of fluid escaping from the soles of persons suffering from the 
disease ; and if there is, whether such increase may not be due to 
warm weather.
It is perhaps not impossible, however, that the 
ferment may be the direct cause of an increase of the fluid, the 
immediate agent being the ammonia liberated by the ferment's 
growth and absorbed into the tissues of the soles.
Another matter worthy of note is the greater chemical energy 
of the soil-ferment as compared with that of the Bacterium.
This 
has already been mentioned in speaking of the reduction of nitrates, 
and it was observed in varying degree throughout the experiments.
The reason is, I believe, that the supply of soil-cocci to the test- 
glasses was more lavish than of the Bacterium, on account of the 
greater difficulty of collecting the latter by the method adopted, and 
this rule was borne out by inspection of cultures in their early 
stages.
Dr. Thin failed to find upon the fetid socks anything but 
cocci.
This would seem to show that in perspiration (possibly in a 
mixture of perspiration and serum) the history of the Bacterinm is 
simply a multiplication of cocci.
On account of the difficulties in 
the way of obtaining perspiration in sufficient quantity to allow of 
sterilisation, I have not determined whether this is the case.
For 
the same reason the experiment with perspiration is to be con- 
sidered as inferential merely.

Variation in Ulex europ.eus.
— On February 1st I noticed a 
marked peculiarity in the abundant flowers of a whin-bush on 
Putney Heath.
On looking closely, I found the vexillum of each 
flower, except one or two imperfect ones, had on each side, near the 
top, a small extra lobe, about f of a circle in shape and about ^ in.
across, turned back at right angles to the rest of the petal.
1 do 
not find this variation mentioned in the usual test-books.
Several 
bushes near had slight attempts to follow this one's example, but 
none had the extra lobe on both sides, and seldom more than a 
pinched-up corner to the vexillum.
One bush, 300 yards away, 
had one flower with the peculiarity developed on one side.
The 
point indicated does not seem to be touched by the humble bees.
It makes the bush showy, and if we are to credit plants with 
deliberate intentions now-a-days we may hope the fashion may 
spread.

Saussurea alpina in County Wicklow.
— In the course of a 
week's botanising in the County Wicklow, towards the end of July 
last (1884), it was my good fortune to discover a well-established 
colony of Saussurea alpina, growing in association with Aleheiiiilla 
alpina, in the cliffs above Lough Ouler, on the south slope of 
Tlionalagee Mountain.
This, I believe, is the first and only 
station recorded for Satissarea in eastern Ireland.
Lough Ouler 
lies at an elevation of 1829 feet above sea-level according to the 
Ordnance Survey, and as I found the plant growing at not more 
than 100 feet above the lake, this would give about 1900 feet for 
elevation of the Wicklow habitat.

BOTANICAL NEWS.
We take the following from the last Annual Report (read 
Feb. 17) of the Herts Natural History Society: — "The council 
regrets that your editor has decided to abandon the editorship of the 
late Mr. R.
A, Pryor's ' Flora of Hertfordshire.' He has devoted a 
considerable amount of time and labour upon it, in preparing a 
portion of it for the press, and in the subsequent revision of this 
portion, comprising the orders Futnnncnl(ice(B, Ijerheridacea, NtjmpJuB- 
ace(B, Fumariacecv, and Cnicifera.
The first sixteen pages are com- 
plete, carrying the work to the end of NyvipJueacefc, but, judging 
from the labour involved in achieving this inconsiderable result, 
your editor considers that the limited time at his disposal will be 
better bestowed upon other work for the Society.
The thanks of the 
Society are due to Mrs. Pry or for the donation of £20 towards the 
cost of editing her son's work.
Of this a small amount has been 
expended in the purchase of a few necessary books and the 
ordnance maps of the comity.
The council will endeavour to secure 
the services of a botanist competent to carry on the work, and who 
will bring it out in a manner Avliich will do credit to its author, who 
had an almost unequalled critical knowledge of British plants, 
combined with a most extensive acquaintance with botanical litera- 
ture, British and foreign, from before the time of Linnaeus to the 
present time." We can quite understand and sympathise with Mr.
Hopkinson's difficulties in carrying out a work for which, we 
venture to think, he was not specially qualified ; but none the less 
do we regret that the Society, which owes much to Mr. Pryor's 
generosity, should not see its way to carrying out the work to which 
a great part of his life was devoted.
Mr. G.
C. Druce has issued a prospectus of a ' Flora of Oxford- 
shire,' which he hoj)es to publish towards the end of the year.
He 
has secured the help of several botanists acquamted with the botany 
of the county.
" The 'Flora' is intended to be not only a cata- 
logue of the county species, with their localities, but also a history 
of them, and of the botanists connected with the University and 
County " ; and the prospectus further states that it will contain 
" about 400 species and varieties additional to those given by 
Walker and Sib thorp." The work will be prmted by the Clarendon 
Press.
M. a.
B. Cole is issuing a series of ' Studies in Microscopical 
Science' (Bailliere, King William St.), which demands a Avord 
of notice.
The work is issued in three sections ; that devoted to 
botany, of which only we can speak, is excellently planned and well 
carried out.
Mr. F.
0. Bower, of the Normal School of Science at South 
Kensington, has been appointed Professor of Botany at the Univer- 
sity of Glasgow.

On dead stems of Cavdnus, near Three Shire Oak (St.), April,

In my 
specimens the perithecia were globose-lenticular, scarcely erum- 
pent ; the sporidia 32-43 jj.

each end, 1- then 3-septate, fusiform when young, but when mature 
with the second cell considerably swollen ; the guttse ultimately 
disappearing, but the sporidia always perfectly hyaline ; para- 
physes numerous, filiform, articulate.
On the upper part of the 
same stems were Ophiohoius (tcioii hiatus Duby, and O.
porphi/roffu7ius 
Sacc, both easily recognisable by the conical protruding ostiola.
On the lower part of many, where the woody fibres were laid bare, 
was Leptosplmria cruenta Sacc, from which, however, this species 
appears to be distinct, for the hyaline sporidia were probably 
mature and the habit is different.

The resemblance of the (jrliocladiHm to the Penicil-

chains in my specimens, and the abundant gelatinous secretion of the 
former is a marked feature, which Mr. Plowright informs me he did 
not notice in the conidia of the Hypomyces figured in ' Grevillea '

I could not perceive in my spores the gelatinous coat which

A NEW SPECIES OF CATHARINEA Ehrhart.
By H.
N. Dixon, M.A.
Catharinea Dixoni Braithw.
MS.
Description: — In small tufts; 
dark green.
Ehizome tomentose.
Stems erect, simple, about one 
inch high, naked below.
Leaves lax below, rather crowded above; 
slightly sheathing, concave, keeled ; erecto-patent when moist, 
crisped when dry.
Lowest small, scale-like, ovate, apiculate, entire ; 
the rest increasing in size upwards, at first shorter and spathulato- 
oblong, above narrower and elongato-lanceolate, tapering to a point; 
not undulate.
Nerve reddish, excurrent into a short but decided 
apiculus, toothed at the back above.
Leaves not bordered, with a 
single row of sharp brownish teeth, commencing at about one-third 
from the base ; not spinulose at the back.
Cells larger and more 
regularly quadrate than in (_'.
nndnlata, quadrate below, quadrate- 
hexagonal above and rounded, especially towards the apex and 
margin ; arranged in longitiulinal rows in the disk of the leaf, more 
irregular and smaller towards the margin ; chlorophvllous above, 
hyaline below.
Lamella; numerous, crowded ; varying much in 
number, sometimes as many as 'S'l ; occupying much of the breadth

of the leaf, especially towards the apex ; in section of from three 
to five almost equal cells.
Fructification unknown.
Habitat: — On earth, on and aboiit the roots of elms, near 
Nortliampton.
First found by the writer, April 8rd, 1884.
This moss has been submitted to Dr. Braithwaite, who will 
figure it in a supplementary plate to vol.
i. of the ' British Moss 
Flora,' and who has kindly informed the writer of his intention to 
name it Catharinea Dixoni.
It will be observed from the description that it differs from all 
known species of Catharinea, except Atnchum pniaHelum Mitt.
(Journ.
of Linn.
Soc, vol.
viii.
p. 48, tab.
viii ; Lesquereux, 
' Mosses of North America,' p.
258), in the absence of border to 
the leaves ; and from all known species in the large number 
of lamella).
Whether these two points are sufficient to separate it 
from Catharinea is a question that must be left undecided in absence 
of fruit ; but the habit and general leaf-structure are distinctly 
those of that genus.
For the present Ehrhart's definition must be 
widened with regard to those points, so as to include these two 
species.

The British Museum Herbarium is indebted for this interesting 
plant to Mr. J.
Cosmo Melvill, whose name I have great pleasure 
in associating with it.
It is remarkable for the broadly ovate- 
petiolate leaves, and the very short flower-stem bearing one (or 
two) rather large violet and white flowers, and with a spur more 
than twice the length of the stem.
The dorsal sepal is five-eighths 
of an inch long, the laterals a little longer.
The petals are bifid ; 
the upper lobe about the length of the dorsal sepals ; the lateral 
lobe a little over an inch long, much narrower, and tapering away 
to a fine point.
The lip has a short narrow base, ending in three 
narrow linear lobes ; the two outer ones nearly an inch and a 
quarter long, tapering gradually to a point, the middle one broader, 
shorter, and blunt.
The long upcurvcd anther-processes are nearly 
three-eighths of an inch in length.

Sonneratia alba Sm.
— Mangrove swamps at Chilan, on the west 
coast, November, 1881.
I am indebted to H.
Nevill, Esq., for 
specimens of this interesting addition to our flora.
It grows with 
the common Ceylon species, <S'.
acida L.
f., from which it is readily 
distinguished by the absence of petals, the longitudinally G-ribbed 
calyx-tube, the depresso-tiu'biuate and shortly apiculate fruit, and 
other characters.
This adds another to the numerous Ceylon 
plants which, though found in the Malay Peninsula and Islands, 
do not reach the Peninsula of India.
Blepharispermum petiolarc DC.
— Not uncommon about Tissa- 
maharama, Kirinida, Hambantota, &c.
A remarkable straggling 
shrub, the woody stem attaining an inch in diameter, and climbing 
by its horizontal branches.
It appears to have been first collected 
by Klein in 1796, and his description is quoted by DC.
in Wight's 
' Contrib.,' p.
12, where the species is founded.
Klein's locality is 
given there as " prope Ugandamalej," in Ceylon.
This locality is 
omitted in DC.
Prod.
v. 368, nor until now has anyone since 
recorded the species for this island, I can find no place with a

ever visited Ceylon.
Wight gathered the plant at Courtallum, but 
it appears to be a very scarce species.
Tithonia diversifulia A.
Gray in Proc.
Amer.
Acad, xix., p.
6 
(1883) (Mirasolia Hemsl.).
— This very handsome " sun-flower" from 
Mexico has now become one of the commonest weeds of Ceylon, 
and is always an object of notice by travellers, who of course think 
it a native plant.
It attains 8 or 10 ft.
high, and its large heads, 
4 or 5 in.
in diameter, are of a singularly brilliant yellow.
It often 
lines the roadsides for long distances, and in places rivals Lantana 
in abundance, whilst it has a much wider climatic range in the 
island than that extraordinary weed of hot moist regions.
It is, 
however, a much later introduction here, for Dr. Thwaites told ine 
that he remembered receiving the seed from Dr. Lindley in 1851, 
as then recently obtained from California ; it has no doubt spread 
from Peradeniya.
I see from A.
Gray's memoir, above quoted, 
that it has been collected in Mexico near Orizaba and Cordoba by 
Botteri and Bourgeau, and that it is figured in Godman's ' Biologia 
Cent.
Americana,' Botany, ii.
t. 47, a work I have not seen.
It is 
singular that this familiar Ceylon weed should thus have remained 
unnamed till within the last three or four years.

is well enough distinguished as a variety by the leaves being per- 
fectly glabrous on both surfaces, the branched inflorescence, the

Clarice (' Fl. Brit.

makes L.

but one.
This is usually densely pubescent throughout (except on 
upper surface of leaves), as in Wight's figure, ' Icones,' t.
1172, 
under Moore's name, L.
aromatica.
At high elevations, as at 
Nuwara Eliya, where it is a most abundant plant, the racemes are 
very dense, and the flowers pale dull purplish-pink ; but at lower 
elevations the flowers are more laxly arranged, and the corolla 
nearly white, but these characters are insufiicient for even varietal 
distiu(;tion.

It is especially fond of the roots of Euphorbia 
antviuornvi, an abundant tree in the dry country.
The plant is pale

Maha-weli Kiver in several places near Kandy, growing with the 
other species on the rocks, and flowering when the water is low in 
the dry weather ; first collected February, 1881.
Our plant is 
beautifully and exhaustively illustrated by Warming — from speci- 
mens sent by me to him — in the ' Vidensk.
Belsk.

t. 12 
(1882).
Beddome's species is figured in Trans.

however, doubts complete identity, and thinks our form intermediate

PJucnix pnsilla Gaertn.
[P.
farinifera Eoxb.).
— In the dry forests 
about Anuradhapura occurs a dwarf Phcenix which presents some 
points of difference from the common species of South Ceylon, 
P. zeylanica Trim.
{= P.
sylvestris Thw., non Roxb.).
It forms no 
stem, the leaf-segments are longer and narrower and less markedly 
4-ranked, and the lower spinescent ones longer, slender, and very 
sharp-pointed, the green is brighter and paler, and the radius 
rather glaucous.
In the female flower the calyx is strongly 
3-ribbed, the ribs running out to the end of the strongly-marked 
teeth.
The fruit — which is ripe in April and eaten by the natives 
— is barely half an inch long, smaller than in P.
zeylanica, but 
somewhat broader in proportion to its length, blunt, apiculate, 
and, when fully ripe, dully-shinnig purple-black, having passed 
through bright crimson-scarlet.

locality is given as "India orientalis and Ceylona" (p.

I 
believe I am right in placing P.
far mi/era here, at least as under- 
stood by the Madras botanists.
I saw this wild in Guindy Park, 
near Madras, but not in fruit.
The common yellow-fruited 
P. sylvestris Eoxb., so much cultivated in India, does not grow in 
Ceylon.
Luiienandra inslijnis Trim., n.
sp.
Pandanus Kaiht Kurz.
— To this I refer a Pandanus used abun- 
dantly as a fence plant for paddy-fields at Kanuwana and other 
places near Colombo.
The fruit and foliage agree precisely with 
the excellent old figures of " Kaida " in Eheede, ' Hort.
Malabar,' 
ii.
tt.
2-5, on which Kurz founded his species.
•;= I have only seen 
the female plant, and have never detected any fertilised seed in the 
fruit, so that it is probable that we have only the one sex here, and 
that it was originally brought from the Malabar coast.
All the 
species of Pandanus are used as fences for paddy, and are always 
grown from cuttings or branches ; they go under the name of 
" wetta (= hedge) Kai/iya." The syncarps of P.
Kaida are large, 
resembling those of P.
dabius Kurz, 10 or 11 in.
long by 6 in.
wide, 
dark dull green becoming dull orange, ovoid-oblong and very blunt, 
usually solitary, but occasionally with two or three smaller globular 
lateral ones below ; the drupes are very distinct, the free portion of 
each l^-f in.
high, rounded and rather flat topped (bluntly nipple- 
shaped), with very blunt angles.
AVlien young the female flowers 
are quite separate down to the axis, and each is composed of two 
or three carpels separated by well-marked grooves ; the sessile 
stigmas are flat, 2-lobed, and slightly reniform.
The leaves are 
broad for the genus, bright green with a glaucous " bloom," and 
with very strong white spines pointing forward on the margin, and 
retrorsely hooked on the under surface of the midrib.
Wolffia arrhiza Wimm.
— First detected by Mr. W.
Ferguson in 
a pond near Colombo, October, 1880.
Occurs in the warm regions 
of all parts of the globe.
Cymodocea anstralis Miq.
(sub HaJodidc).
— In abundance, growing 
in the shallow water off the shore at Weligama (Belligam) Bay, on 
the south coast, in December, 1883, along with C.
isoetifolia Asch., 
and Thalassia Hemprichii Asch.
I could not find any plants in

MS.
in the Banksian Herbarium at

It was collected by Mr. W.
Ferguson 
between Puttalam and Anuradhapura in 1882.
This is a Peninsular 
Indian species, and Bentham ('Fl. Austral.' vh.

combine it with the Australian Holcus pan-iflorus Br.
(= Andro- 
poi/ou micrantluts Kunth) under the name of Chrysopogon parvijionis, 
Anthistiria prostrata Willd.
— A common Indian species not 
noticed in Ceylon till collected by Mr. W.
Ferguson near Chilau.
Sporobolus virginicHs Kunth [Agrostis L.).
— This is not an un- 
common grass on our sandy sea- shores.
I have specimens from 
Kalpitiya and the small islands off that pensinula, from Chilau, and 
from Kn-inda ; it is also common south of Colombo, but does not 
flower there.
A widely-spread species over the warm parts of both 
hemispheres.
S. humifusus Kunth {Vilfa H.
B. K.).
— In similar places to the 
last, but less common ; its general range is also much the same.
Very fine and abundant on Karetivo off Kalpitiya.
It is dis- 
tinguished by its narrow pyramidal rather lax panicles, and the 
lowest glume being only one-third the length of the second and 
third.
S. orientalis Kunth [Agrostis tenacissima L.).
— Abundant about 
Kirinda and Bundala, on south-east coast, and also at Kalpitiya.
It 
creeps very widely, and, when not in flower, is very liable to be 
mistaken for Zoysia piingens, which often grows with it.
Common 
in Peninsular India.
S. coromandelinus Kunth (Agrostis Retz.).
— A very pretty little 
grass, abundant on the sandy coast near Kirinda, but not as yet 
seen elsewhere.
Found also in India and Arabia.
Knteropogon meUcoides Nees in Steud.
[IscJmmum Keen.).
— This 
fine species was collected in several places near Kirinda.
Its range 
extends to East Tropical Africa {^= Chloris simplex Schum.
& 
Thorm.), and probably the Mascarene Islands (= / Ctenium 
seycheUense Baker).
Eragrostis [Harpadine) brevifolia Benth.
{Dactylisl{.o&i\.).
— Pro- 
bably common in the dry districts.
I found it copiously about 
Hambantota, Tissa-maha-rama, &c.
There is also an unnamed 
specimen in the herbarium here (C.
P. 3250) labelled " Jaffra ?
Moon." This may represent the PomtnercuUa of Moon's Cat., p.
7, 
a grass which has not been truly found in Ceylon.
Lepturus repens Br.
(L.
acicnlatHs Steud.).
— Sea-shoro south of 
Colombo, January, 1881; first collected by Mr. W.
Ferguson.
The 
plant is abundant in places, and will probably be found, if searched 
for, in other parts of the south coast.
It is the only tropical member 
of the genus.
I find the upper flower of the spikelet frequently per- 
fectly developed ; the lowest glume is very long (over half an inch), 
reaching to the base of the one above on the same side ; during 
176 A SYNOPSIS OF THE GENUS SELAGINELLA.
flowering it stands out at right angles.
At this time the spikes are 
more or less enclosed in the leaf-sheaths, and have no tendency to 
break up into joints.
The ripe grain is free, but enclosed in the 
glumes, and held firmly between the excavation in the rachis and 
the closely adpressed lowest glume ; the rachis now readily dis- 
articulates, at points below the origin of each lowest glume, into 
short joints.
I may add that in the upper flowers the lodicules, 
which are thick, obtuse, or truncate, are evidently attached to the 
sides of the palea, i.e., stipular ; the ovary is very distinctly bifid 
above.
TeinosUichijum f macidatnm Trim., n.
sp.
Adiantum iithiopicum L.
{A.
emarginatum Bory).
— Mr. Ferguson 
detected this widely distributed fern in abundance above Elgin 
Estate, in Upper Dimlula, in a locality apparently native.
But, as 
it was also found growing among the coffee of the same estate, and 
has been for many years a cultivated species in the island, it may 
be well doubted whether the locality is a truly natural one.
Some 
foreign ferns readily establish themselves in the warm, moist rocky 
valleys of the cofi'ee districts, and a form of Gymnogramma p('ruviana 
has become a very abundant plant in many such places with all the 
look of a native plant.
Ophioglossum lusitanicum L.
— I first discovered this as a very 
minute form growing in the crevices of rocks at DambuUa in 
December, 1881, during the north-east monsoon rains.
This de- 
pauperate state is apparently the (>.
gramincion of Willdenow, 
originally sent from Madras.
Specimens lately collected at Uma 
Oya, on the course of the Maha-weli Eiver, have broader barren 
fronds, and approach O.
vulgatam, of which small forms also 
occur here.
The species of this genus seem to have been unduly 
multiplied.
Isoetes coromandelina L.
f. — Collected on Dambulla Hill, 1881.
I have given a full account of this as a Ceylon plant, with a figure, 
in the volume of this Journal for 1881 (pp.

SOME MORE NOTES ON DOVEDALE PLANTS.

The remarks of Messrs.
Baker and Newbould in their interesting 
" Notes on the Flora of Matlock " (Jouni.
Bot., Nov., 1884), as to 
the absence of certain species from Dovedale and the immediate 
neighbourhood, give me the opportunity of making a few comments 
by way of additions to, or in confirmation of, their statements, 
which I might not otherwise have judged it worth while to set 
down ; and whilst doing this I will farther take occasion to record 
such few additions as I have latterly made to the Derbyshire list of 
species, together with some more localities for those already 
recorded.
It was a matter of much regret to me that the stay of Mr. Baker 
and his friends at Matlock, and more especially their visit to 
Dovedale, should have occurred at a time when I was absent from 
home, and that I thus missed the pleasure aiid advantage of 
meeting them.
I can only hope to be more fortunate should their 
visit be repeated, as I trust it may be.
A residence of over fourteen years within a mile and a half of 
the upper end of Dovedale (although actually in Staffordshire) will 
necessarily have given me the opportunity of visiting this celebrated 
Derbyshire Dale at all times of the year and during a succession of 
seasons, some of which have been more favourable than others to 
the appearance of certain plants, and thus of becoming acquainted 
with stations of plants which would scarcely be met with in a 
single visit.
I have not, indeed, recorded all the common species on the 
Derbyshire side of the valley of the Dove with the same care with 
which I have those of the Staffordshire side, on which I am living, 
but I have carfully noted the more uncommon ones as I have found 
them.
The present paper will only have reference to such species 
as seem to call for some comment, or for which the mention of 
additional localities or further statements as to their occurrence 
and conditions of growth seems desirable.
Like Mr. Baker, I have been much struck with the absence of 
many species from Dovedale and its immediate neighbourhood, 
more especially of such as occur freely in the valley of the Wye 
between Buxton and Matlock.
Thalictrum monUmiun, Myasotis 
fidustris, and Geraniuin saiuiuineum are examples.
The scanty clothing of soil on the steep rocky slopes of Dove- 
dale makes it difficult for plants to withstand the effects of 
drought, especially on the more sunny Derbyshire side, which 
,is less clothed with wood or scrub than the Staffordshire side.
To this cause I attribute the absence of some species.
I was 
informed on good authority that I'uhjpodium robertianum, &c., grew 
in some quantity on one of the exposed stony slopes, but that 
it disappeared after the hot dry summers of 1868-70.
Certain 
it is that it has not since been to be found on the Derbyshire 
182 
SOME MORE NOTES ON DOVEDALE PLANTS.
side, altliongli existing in very small quantity on the Staffordshire 
side of the Dale.
The drought of those seasons and then the continued heavy 
rains of a series of subsequent years, by washing away the earth 
from the crevices of the rocks, may have destroyed some other 
species, such as Cotyledon, which, although recorded by the late Mr.
Edwin Brown in Sir 0.
Mosley's Nat. Hist, of Tutbury as growing 
in Dovedale, do not seem now to exist there.
Other species, more 
especially ferns, have been almost absolutely exterminated by the 
ravages of dealers and thoughtless tourists.
Such is the case with 
Ceterach officindrnm, which, I learn on good authority, was at one 
time plentiful.
Of Batracliian Ranunculi, aggregate R.
peltatus seems to be the 
form which occurs in the pools, chiefly artificial, which are scattered 
over the limestone plateau which separates the valleys of the Dove 
and Wye.
— A doubtful form tending towards H.
jiorihundus was 
noticed by Mr. C.
Bailey and myself between Pike Hall and Grange 
Mill.
— R.
Drouettii occurs in great abundance in the ponds and 
reservoirs of the Via Gellia.
I have noticed it for a succession of 
seasons, but I think it was unusually abundant last summer.
— 
R. penicillatus occurs abundantly in the Dove, as has been recorded, 
from Beresford Dale downwards.
I have sought in vain, season 
after season, for even a partially-matured carpel.
— R.
fiuitans, at 
least in the Herefordshire Wye, matures fruit freely.
Coi-i/clalis claviculata still grows on some of the millstone-grit 
rocks near Birchover.
Hutchinsia petraa.
I only notice this to remark that it has 
become much less abundant in Dovedale than it was some ten or 
fifteen years ago.
It is curious that my Herefordshire botanical 
fi-iends have observed the same thing in their district.
Perhaps 
the seasons may have in some way been unfavourable, so that we 
may expect it again to become more abundant.
Canlavdne amara is plentiful in various parts of the Dove.
I have failed to find Arahis perfoliata in the station indicated for 
it in N.
B. 0., namely, between Ashbourne and Okeover ; but it is 
a likely part, from soil and situation.
The absence of TIdaspi virens and its usual ally, Arenaria verna, 
from all the mine-hillocks which I have examined on both sides of 
Dovedale is remarkable, when we consider how freely they occur in 
the neighbourhood of Matlock.
Viola Fieiclienhachiana (first record for the county) occurs plenti- 
fully at Fenny Bentley, extending for perhaps half a mile and then 
giving place to F.
Riviniana.
V. Eeiclienbarhiana begins to flower 
several weeks sooner than V.
Ririniana.
A diflerence in the form 
and texture of the leaves enables the eye to distinguish these, even 
without the aid of the flowers, in the early part of the season ; but 
as summer advances the distinction becomes less obvious, and the 
diflerence in the sepals has to be called in.
V. canina ("Linn") 
Bab. seems to be a scarce plant in Derbyshire.
I have only met 
with a few plants of it in one part of Dovedale ; these Avere of the

mistaken.
— V.
IiUck, which occurs in some plenty on some of the 
limestone hills of the Staffordshire side of Dovedale, seems nearly 
or quite absent from those on the Derbyshire side.
In general it 
shows a preference for sandstone ; and the Ordnance Geological 
Survey Surveyors report that they often obtained help in detecting 
the boundary between the shales and the sandstone by the presence 
of V.
lutea, "a crowded belt of which, perhaps not many yards broad, 
is often seen along the outcrop of a sandstone-bed, whilst not a 
single plant will be found on the shales which come out on either 
side" (Mem. of Geol.
Survey N.
Derbyshire, p.
4).
Alsine tenidfuUa used to occur on one of the rocky banks near 
the path-side in Dovedale.
In the summer of 1879, however, on 
looking for it as usual when I passed, I found that every one of the 
plants which I had noticed not long before had been taken away by 
some ruthless and inconsiderate plant-collector.
Since that time 
it has never reappeared.
It is greatly to be wished that such 
collectors would bear in mind that they not only deprive everyone 
else, but themselves also, of the pleasure of gathering the plant 
again.
I am glad to say that there is another station at Brassing- 
ton, some few miles to the east.
Stellaria media, var.
umhrosa, Opitz.
Hedge-bank at Fenny 
Bentley, and near the railway-station at Ashbourne.
Hypericum montanum occurs, but not in great quantity.
I do not 
think I have ever seen H.
humifusum on limestone, and I suspect 
that a starved state of H.
perforatum was mistaken for it in 
Dovedale.
The Malva growing on Thorpe Cloud is M.
stjli^estris, not M.
rotundi folia, which seems absent from the district.
Tilia / There are one or two scrubby bushes of either T.

elevation of over 1000 ft.
on one of the cliffs of Dovedale.

The country to the south and east of Ashbourne seems 
to possess a fair list of brambles ; but as I have had very few 
opportunities of investigating them, and as one or tAvo of those which 
I have met with are not satisfactorily determined, I refrain from 
mentioning more than those, to whose absence from the lime- 
stone tracts Mr. Baker has called attention, li.

Tissington 
and Dovedale, where this was seen by Mr. Baker, are its chief 
quarters hereabout.
I think I am safe in saying that, from that 
part of the Ashbourne and Buxton road where it was crossed by 
Mr. Baker and his friends on their way to Dovedale, the remaining 
fourteen or more miles of the distance to Buxton would only have 
shown them one other bush of it.
li.
discolor is a late-flowering 
species, and very rarely ripens its fruit hereabout.

SHORT NOTES.
Crocus Korolokowi in Afghanistan.
— This rare Crocus has 
been recently obtained by Mr. W.
Simpson, in his travels in 
Afghanistan.
He collected a few specimens at Bala Murghab, on 
the level ground of the valley, G3'^ E.
long, and between 35° and 
36"" N.
lat., where he found the plant growing in great quantities.
This extends its range further east, as Mr. Maw gives its distribu- 
tion as between 40° and 45° N.
lat.
and 67° and 71° long., mention- 
ing it as the most eastern of the yellow species.
His specimens 
were received from Prof.
Kegel, without any record of date, but 
from their characters he inferred them to be vernal species.
This 
inference is proved correct by Mr. Simpson, who states that the 
specimens sent by him to the British Museum were collected at the 
end of January or beginning of February.
He states that the 
leaves have in the fresh state a row of pale spots along each 
margin, forming a most delicate and beautiful border.
This, 
however, has disappeared in the dried plants.

Unusual form of attempted Conjugation in Spirogyra.
— Early 
in May, while examining some Spiroiji/ra in a vigorous state of growth 
and conjugation, I observed an appearance which is perhaps suffi- 
ciently remarkable to deserve mention.
Two filaments lay parallel, 
and several cells of one were connected with the cells in the other 
opposite to them by the usual processes, but communication was 
not yet established between the two cells.
So far all was regular, but 
the peculiarity occurred in one case.
Let us call one pair of cells 
a and a' ; and let the cell adjoining a in its filament be h, and b' be 
opposite to b in the other filament, and therefore adjacent to a'.
It 
was seen that h' had failed to send out a process, but b had sent out 
two.
One, situated near the end of b remote from a, was short but 
straight : the other protruded from a part of b near to a ; it pro- 
ceeded straight for some distance, and then turned sharply round 
at right angles, until it reached the junction of the two processes 
prom a and a', both of which processes it seemed to touch.
It was 
impossible to feel sure that the contact in both cases was more 
than optical : a triangle was seen, bounded by the walls of the 
three processes.
But it would seem beyond doubt that the process 
from h, disappointed as it were in finding no response from its 
infertile neighbour //, was led to turn aside by the joint or separate 
influence ot a and a'.
I regret that I found it impossible to keep 
the filaments alive.
It would have been interesting to see what 
fructification would have resulted.

Die Pilz thiere oder Sehleimpilze.
Von Dr. W.
Zopf.
[Encyclopnedie 
der Naturwissenschaften.
Breslau, Eduard Trewendt, 1885] .
Owing to the advances made in our knowledge of the Mycetozoa 
since De Bary's remarkable work (1864), and also to the fact that 
Eostafinski's Monograph of the group is written in Polish, and thus 
inaccessible to most botanists, the want has arisen of a treatment 
of these organisms embodying the scattered results of the last 
twenty years' work.
Dr. M.
C. Cooke has given us an extract 
from Eostafinski's Monograph, so far as it has reference to species 
found in Great Britain ; but the student of the group demands 
more than such a glimpse into this comprehensive work, and it is 
to be regretted that the whole Monograph was not then rendered 
into intelligible language.
In De Bary's ' Vergleichende Morphologic und Biologic der 
Pilze, Mycetozoen und Bacterien,' published last year, the group 
received the same treatment as the others in the book, and this 
had the special interest of being furnished by the author of the 
work which first threw light upon the life-histories and relation- 
ships of these extraordinary organisms.
Dr. Zopf has divided his present treatise into three sections ; 
the first dealing with the Morphology and the second with the 
Physiology.
These parts of the subject are thoroughly dealt with, 
and of very special interest.
De Bary's recent discussion (just 
referred to) of the same subject perhaps makes one feel less 
indebted than one should to Dr. Zopf for his painstaking and 
original labour.
The third section, which is perhaps the most 
valuable, is devoted to the systematic grouping of the Mycetozoa.
Dr. Zopf's classification is as follows : —

It will thus be seen that Dr. Zopf has found it necessary to 
modify Kostafinski's classification.
Following the above order the 
author goes over the whole series in detail, giving a short, and as a 
rule very clear, account of each form.
Perhaps it should be known 
that this very comprehensive and well illustrated account of the 
morphology and physiology, and complete systematic treatment of 
a group of organisms as interesting as they are obscure, has been 
produced in handy form at the price of five shillings.

Any contribution to the literature of this subject made by an 
author educated in Botany is pretty sure to be distinguishable at 
once from the work of a pathologist.
The one recognises througli- 
out that the organisms lie treats of are plants more or less like 
certain allies ; while the other apparently regards them as a set of 
objects by themselves, to be classified in peculiar ways and after no 
botanically acceptable fashion.
No doubt our ignorance of the 
188 
NOTICES OF BOOKS.
life-histories of the Schizoinycetes stands in the way of a satisfactory 
botanical classification, but that is decidedly no reason for adopting 
bases of arrangement which have been long discharged from 
service in Botany.
Dr. Zopf has divided his book into four sections, 
dealing with the morphology, physiology, methods of investigation, 
and systematic arrangement respectively.
He divides the group 
thus : —

4. Leptothrix.

The author, who, by the way, accepts the Spirilhim CholercB 
Asiaticce (which is doubtless the defeated comma- shaped Bacillus 
of Koch's researches), deals concisely with the pathological 
literature.
The book is clearly written, and excellently illustrated.
A very useful catalogue of the literature of the subject is to be 
found at the end.

Die Methoden der Bacterien-Forschung.
Von Dr. Ferdinand Hueppe.
(Kreidel.
Wiesbaden, 1885).
Db. Hueppe, who is a pupil of Dr. Koch's, has gathered together 
into a handy form a very useful body of information on the subject 
of the methods of investigating Bacteria.
Much of this information 
has been collected from sources difficult of access, and the whole 
has been judiciously arranged by the autbor, who shows a wide and 
intimate knowledge of the methods in use.
The methods of stain- 
ing and cultivating, the principles of sterilization, the relation of 
Bacteria to decomposition and to disease are very fully discussed, 
as well as the general Biology of the group.
The illustrations of 
apj)aratus, &c., are a useful feature of the book.
The author has 
done excellent service in not only gathering together, but in 
selecting the materials for a book which is sure to be welcome 
among students of the important group of Schiwmijcetes.

the production of it.
The arrangement of the book is a novel one, 
and no doubt this attracted those who are responsible for its 
appearance quite as much as its other merits.
The arrangement is 
as follows : — Part I.
deals with Morphology; the root, stem, leaves 
(flower, fruit, seed), and hairs at considerable length.
Part II.
is 
devoted to Systematic Botany, the higher plants only, (1) Mono- 
cotyledons and (2) Dicotyledons being dealt with in detail.
Part III.
is occupied with an admirable account of fertilisation by wind and 
by insects, and the transport of seeds, &c., by water, wind, and 
animals.
Part IV.
contains Anatomy (the cell and the tissues) and 
Physiology.
In Part V.
we come again to Systematic Botany, 
beginning with the lowest plants (for which the student has been 
prepared by Part IV.
) and ascending to the higher plants again — 
the groups being dealt with very shortly.
It will be obvious that the learner is thus gradually introduced 
to the more difficult branches of the study — and this, I venture to 
think, might have been better done by going steadily down from 
the highest to the lowest plants.
With this exception and the 
farther one, that the reviser might with advantage have taken 
liberties with the classification so as to bring it out of the German 
land of darkness in systematic affairs, the book is wholly to be 
recommended.
It will be specially serviceable to those who study 
Botany at their leisure away from classes of instruction, and the 
regular student will certainly find it a pleasant introduction as well 
as a thorough one to all branches of the science.
In spite of its 
being a translation, it is by far the most readable text-book of its 
kind that we have, and decidedly it is the best-illustrated.
The first part of Messrs.
Bower and Vines' Practical Botany is 
a valuable addition to our literature in these days, when a new 
departure has been taken in the methods of teaching Botany in this 
country.
The book is, as its name sets forth, very practical, and 
very well fitted for its purpose.

A Flora of the Em/Iish Lake District.
By J.
G. Baker, F.K.S.
London : Bell & Sons, 1885.
8vo, pp.
vi.
262.
The English Lake district presents so many features of interest 
to the botanist that it is somewhat strange there should have been 
hitherto no connected account of its Flora.
" A mountainous tract 
with a distinct physical individuality of its own, and with a distinct 
botanical individuality, both in respect of the plants that are present 
and those that are rare or absent," — we quote from Mr. Baker's 
preface, — it does not correspond exactly with Mr. Watson's Lake 
Province, the district included " extending northward and eastward 
to AUonby, Wigton, Penrith, and Tebay," but excluding "the low- 
lying northern half of Cumberland, often called the Plain of Carlisle, 
and the western slope of the Pennine Chain through Cumberland 
and Westmoreland." 
It would be impertinent to attempt a detailed criticism of a flora 
of this kind unless the critic had himself an intimate acquaintance 
with the district to which it pertains ; and such an acquaintance 
190 NOTICES OF BOOKS.
cannot be claimed by one whose visits to the Lake Country have 
been as "few and far between" as those of the present writer.
But it may be well, in drawing attention to this welcome addition 
to our local floras, — which fortunately appears in good time for use 
during the present season, — to point out that it differs materially 
from works of the same kind in its mode of treatment.
Instead of 
the elaborate system of more or less numerous districts and sub- 
districts which have found favour with recent workers, Mr. Baker 
summarises the distribution of each plant in a manner which at 
first sight strikes the reader as somewhat superficial.
But it is 
only at first sight that such a view can be entertained.
Mr. Baker's 
knowledge and experience as a field botanist, a herbarium student, 
and a practised botanical author, have enabled him to condense his 
information in a manner which, we think, few could successfully 
imitate.
His "leading purpose," as Mr. Watson said of his 
' Topographical Botany,' "is to adduce and arrange personal testi- 
mony in a very condensed form " ; and he has succeeded in this 
without losing, as far as we are able to judge, any important 
details.
The generalising faculty here displayed, evident in the 
various monographs with which the author has enriched con- 
temporary botanical literature, has always seemed to us one of 
Mr. Baker's strongest points, the only disadvantage connected 
with it being that those possessed of less intimate acquaintance 
with their district may be led to attempt to generalise from in- 
sufficient data concerning the plants of their neighbourhood.
The Flora of the Lake district is intended by its author as a 
field book, rather than as a volume for the study ; and to this must 
be attributed the comparative absence of such notes on the life- 
history of the plants recorded, which made Mr. Briggs' ' Flora of 
Plymouth ' improving and instructive reading even to those who 
were quite unacquainted with Devonshire botany.
Not that even 
these are altogether wanting ; while the topographical and biblio- 
graphical introduction is excellently done.
This inadequate notice 
will, we hope, draw the attention of our readers to a work which is 
indispensable to the students of English plants.

(Tab. 258.) 
Sparganium NEGLECTUM Beebj (Journ.
Bot. 1885, p.
26).
— Eoot- 
stock soboliferous.
Eoot-leaves 3-5 feet long, triquetrous at their 
base, channeled on the upper side and keeled almost throughout, 
rigid, erect, never flaccid nor floating even in running water, 
exceeding the flower stem.
Stem-leaves, which are somewhat 
channeled in their lower half, and bracts, usually keeled to their 
apex.
Inflorescence a compound spike, each branch bearing 1-3 
female heads with many male heads above them.
Fruit nearly or 
quite sessile, obovate-pointed, sometimes narrowly so, or when two- 
seeded roundly obovate, generally rather more than twice as long 
as broad (excl.
l)eak), not truncate, but narrowed gradually into 
the beak,* which is |— f, commonly -|, the length of the fruit 
itself; slightly obtusangular by compression, with a terete trans- 
verse section, its epicarp of numerous small cells, which continue 
dense and compact in the ripe fruit, and thus conceal the ridges of 
the endocarp.
Female perianth scales linear, with a broad spathu- 
late apex.
Herbage drying a more or less pale green.
The habit is much that of S.
ramosxua Curt., which, however, 
differs from the above conspicuously in the form of the fruit, as 
well as in the structure of its ei^icarp, which is composed of a few 
large loose cells ; in the ripe fruit these collapse somewhat into the 
furrows between the ridges of the endocarp, thus allowing the 
latter to be prominent, and giving to the fruit its angular appear- 
ance and irregular transverse section.
The female perianth scales 
are mostly ligulate, more membranous, and scarcely or not at all 
enlarged at the apex, and the fruit is more frequently two-seeded 
than in S.
ncglectum.
The upper leaves and bracts are less harsh 
and more leathery in texture, the latter usually quite without a 
keel, and drying blackish or olive-green.
No allusion to the fruit is made by Hudson (Fl. Ang.
ii.
p. 401) 
in his description of S.
ramosum, and his plant may perhaps best 
be regarded as an aggregate, including that now described and the 
S. ramosxLin Curtis (Fl. Lond.
f. 5, pi.
342, and description), which 
latter is also the ramosum of Syme (E.
B. iii.), and apparently of 
most authors.
I do not now feel sure which plant is represented 
by Reichenbach's plate (see p.
26, ante).
The description by 
Leighton (Fl. Shropshire), " h'uit ovate-acuminate, angular by 
compression,' and that of Garcke (Fl. Nord und Mittel Deutsch- 
land), " fruit long-beaked," point to the present plant as the one 
actually seen by those authors ; and these are the only references 
I have met with which seem applicable to nci/lectum.
I do not find that S.
nci/lectwii has any characters in common 
with <S.
siiiipJex beyond the pointed apex to the fruit and its 
long beak.
* The term beak is restricted to the persistent style, exclusive of the stigma, 
which is also sometimes persistent.

194 RECENT ADDITIONS TO THE BRITISH LICHEN-FLORA.
Besides from Surrey, where there are many stations, of which 
I may mention New Pond, Merstham, and the boj^gy meadow west 
of Eeigate Heath, I have seen specimens from E.
Sussex (H.
T. 
Mennell) ; and tliere is a plant from Mrs. Eobinson's Herbarium 
at the British Museum, witliout locaUty, named S.
ramoswii by 
Eev. Gr.
E. Smith.
I have seen immature specimens, probably 
referable to this, from S.
Essex, E.
Suffolk, Hunts or Cambs,, 
Worcester, and Salop.
A plant in Hb. Brit.
Mus., collected by Dr.
Trimen at Lowestoft in 1859, and placed by him on a sheet of 
S. simplex, with the remark, " vide length of anthers and beak of 
fruit," is doubtless the early state, with which I am yet scarcely 
acquainted.
The only continental specimens seen, which are certainly 
referable to S.
ne(/lectuin, are the following : — Marais de Gourze, 
Vaud, Switzerland, leg.
Blanchet (in Herb.
Kew) ; Antibes, Alpes 
Marifcimes, France (Herb.
Thuret in Paris Herbarium), and Senart 
(France?), 1822 (Herb.
Brongniart, with the last).
Ripe fruit of 
the two last was kindly sent me from Paris last month by 
Mr. George Nicholson ; it is quite undistinguishable from that of 
the Surrey plant, and Mr. Nicholson tells me that the habit is 
the same.
A plant from Pancorvo, Spain (Hb. Shuttleworth, Brit.
Mus.) 
may belong here ; the fruit, however, is not ripe, and, while not 
rawosion, the possibility of the occurrence of other forms makes it 
unadvisable to speak more definitely.
All the above are under the 
name S.
ramosnm Huds., with the exception of Dr. Trimen's 
Lowestoft plant.
Prof.
Asa Gray writes that specimens sent him were referred to 
Mr. S.
Watson, who reports (December, 1884) that they " do not 
accord with any American form we have." The known distribution 
is therefore confined to the Old World, and to Europe.
I desire to express my indebtedness to the various authorities, 
both British and continental, who have so kindly examined speci- 
mens and reported upon them.
With one exception here, all 
the opinions received are in favour of regarding Spanjunium 
mylectUDi as a distinct species.

SOME MORE NOTES ON DOVEDALE PLANTS.
By the Rev. W.
H. Purchas.
(Concluded from p.
184).
Pyrns nipicola.
Mr. Baker did not see this on the Derbyshire 
side of Dovedale ; had time allowed him to penetrate farther up the 
Dale he would have fallen in with numerous small trees of it.
Many of them grow in maccessible situations, but all which I have 
been able to examine belong to P.
rupicola.
— True P.
Aria exists, 
as Mr. Painter stated on my authority, as a single tree at the edge 
of a plantation near the fifth milestone on the road from Ashbourne 
to Buxton, but it has the appearance of having been planted ; the 
tree is an old one, and flowers freely, but there are no traces of 
young seedlings.
Epilobiniii rosew)!
occurs sparingly at Fenny Bentley.
The late 
Rev. G.
E. Smith told me also that it grew near Osmaston, by 
Ashbourne, but it is a scarce plant in the district.
— E.
ohacurum 
occurs also at Fenny Bentley, in company with E.
montanum.
Some few specimens growing with E.
montanum and E.
obscuriim at 
Fenny Bentley have much the appearance of being hybrid between 
these two, although chiefly akin to E.
montanum.
I have also 
found on the hanks of the Dove a form having characters inter- 
mediate between E.
parcijiorum and E.
obscimnn.
Specimens of 
this were lately sent to the Botanical Exchange Club with other 
intermediates between these two species from this part of Stafford- 
shire.
— E.
palustre, which is common in the Staffordshire moor- 
lands, seems wholly to avoid the limestone.

Fdht's alpinnm.
Plentiful in several parts of Dovedale ; strictly 
dioecious.
The frequency with which this occurs in the old cottage 
gardens, together with the fact that some of the Dovedale localities 
where it occurs most plentifully are near some of these old cottage 
gardens, made me for some time to question its claims to be 
considered native here ; but farther search has shown me colonies 
of strong old bushes of both sexes in nooks and clefts where there 
is little suspicion of human agency.
In Staffordshire it occurs in 
the neighbouring valley of the Manifold (limestone), near Wetton 
Mill.
I haue always been puzzled to account for the frequency of 
this plant in old cottage gardens.
Its fruit is worthless, and even 
the stamiuate plant, which is much more showy than the pistillate, 
is hardly so much so as to make it valued as an ornamental shrub, 
In Herefordshire, where the plant is sometimes seen in hedges, 
I only observed the pistillate form.
Saxifrarja granulata is quite a feature in the pastures in the early 
summer.
Chri/susjilcnium alternifolium.
' Banks of the Dove, in one or two 
spots, but rather scarce ; also on the banks of a brook between 
Ashbourne and Fenny Bentley.
Parnassia.
Dovedale and some of the tributary valleys, but not 
in the abundance in which it occurs near Buxton.

Mr. Baker remarks on the absence of H.
murornm 
and H.
ca'sium.
The plant, however, which Mr. Baker regards as 
H. caimim, var.
Smithii, occurs on the rocks of Dovedale, ascending 
to nearly 1100 ft, and has been recorded by Mr. Painter.
I first 
met with this, some twenty years ago, on the rocks of Middleton 
Dale.
Mr. Baker, to whom I lately sent some Dovedale specimens, 
considers it identical with the plant of the limestone rocks of York- 
shire, and to be truly H.
ccedum, var.
Smithii.
Dr. Boswell, on the 
other hand, as confidently refers it to H.
pallidum.
Between these 
opinions it is not for me to attempt to decide.
I will only say that 
the Derbyshire (and Staffordshire) plant is very glaucous, and that 
the leaves are much more suddenly narrowed at the base than in 
Dr. Boswell's Fifeshire H.
p(dlidum; and with radiating teeth, 
which, as in that, are often half an inch long.
On the other hand, 
the Derbyshire plant differs notably from a Herefordshire plant 
which I have known for many years, and of which examples 
pronounced by Mr. Baker to be iJ.
c^sMtm were sent to the Botanical 
Exchange Club by the Eev. A.
Ley (see Eeport for 1882).
The 
leaves of this plant from the limestone rocks of the Herefordshire 
Wye Valley are broader in outline than those of the Derbyshire 
plant, and, instead of long radiating teeth, have scarcely more than 
denticulations on their margin ; the Derbyshire plant also wants 
the reddish purple so noticeable on the under surface of the leaves 
of the Herefordshire " H.
ccBsium.'' I have met with this Derbyshire 
HieraciuDi. at Linton, N.
Devon, and on rocks near Tenby, from 
which latter place it was recorded by Mr. E.
Lees in the 'Phytolo- 
gist,' 0.
S., 1853, p.
1018.
It is a form which departs from 
H. murorum rather in the direction of H.
amjlicum than of H.
sylvaticum..
— True H.
murorum, seems to be very rare in Derbyshire ; 
I have, however, met with it well marked between Miller's Dale 
and Cressbrook, as also in Ashwood Dale, Buxton, but in small 
quantity only.
I have cultivated this Ashwood Dale plant for 
several seasons side by side with the green typical H.
viurornm from 
the woods of Herefordshire, and I can see no farther difference than 
that the Ashwood Dale plant has just a slight tendency to be 
glaucous.
— The form of H.
vuhjatum, which Dr. Boswell has distri- 
buted under the name of "/i.
rusulatum" from Fifeshire, occurs 
with the type on the rocks of the Dove Valley.
— H.
umhellatum.
On the Yoredale Eocks of the upper part of the Dove Valley, 
I think on both the Derbyshire and tStaflbrdshire sides of the 
stream, which is there very narrow, but ceasing when the limestone 
is reached.
Jasione montana, like the last, occurs freely on the Yoredale 
Eocks of the upper part of the course of the Dove ; but I have 
never seen it on the limestone, and I think there must be some 
mistake as to its having been met with in Dovedale.

Vaccmium MyrtiUus usually avoids the limestone, especially 
when close at the surface, but it appears with some other relics of 
the old moorland vegetation on a part of Allsop Moor, near 
Newhaven.
It may be that the curious sandy deposit which is 
found in various spots on that elevated tract may be there also, 
and may have helped to supply a congenial peaty soil for heathland 
plants.
I hope to pay more attention to this point than I have done.

The head-quarters, however, of this 
species are on the Staffordshire bank of the Dove, just below 
Lode Mill, where there are several old trees about 15 ft.
high, 
and I suspect that the younger bushes have been derived from 
these through branches which have been torn off" by winds or 
floods having been carried down and lodged on the banks, there 
taking root and growing.
In other cases I think they must have 
been planted as cuttings : all are the female plant, I find this 
to be one of the willows most frequently planted near houses 
and gardens hereabout, I suppose for the sake of a supply of 
twigs.

Brassington Eocks and Dovedale.
The form 
which occurs in Dovedale is one which shows a strong preference 
for limestone, and is identical, or very nearly so, with the 
Herefordshire plant from Little Doward Hill, referred by Prof.
Babington to E.
oralis.
This form agrees with the E.
oralis of 
Settle and the Ormshead in general growth, in the somewhat 
sudden passage from leaves to bracts, in the bracts being mostly 
shorter than the flowers, and in the transversely oval outline of the 
label ; but it differs in the surface of the label being smooth, the 
basal "hunches" not being prolonged downward so as to occupy 
the centre of the label with an elevated rugose protuberance, bi;t 
confined to the constriction which separates the two portions of the 
lip.
On account of this difference I have always ventured to doubt 
the identity of the Herefordshire "oval is" with the plant of York- 
shire and the Ormshead ; and now, after having again very 
carefully compared them, I can only say that I still think them 
different ; the differences are indeed but small, but much more 
tangible than any which separate the Herefordshire " oralis " (and 
the Dovedale plant also) from the forms by which it gradually 
passes into the larger and more general plant which Prof.
Babington 
pointed out to me as his E.
luedia, but which better answers to his 
description of E.
latifolia.
The character of the label of the true 
oralis is shown in the enlarged figure on the Eng. Bot.
plate, and 
is confirmed by a careful pencil-sketch made from a fresh Settle 
specimen by the late Kev. G.
E. Smith, and sent to me not very 
long before his death.
A comparison of these with my own 
sketches made from the living Herefordshire plant makes the 
difference clear, and supports my belief that the Herefordshire and 
Derbyshire plants belong rather to E.
latifolia or media than to E.
oralis, but that they constitute a limestone form which, out of many, 
comes nearest to oralis.
I have from time to time during many 
years carefully examined the forms of aggregate E.
latifolia which 
I have met with either in the south-western or in the midland 
counties, but I have never been able to see that the forms existing 
in Nature were adequately recognised in books ; and I still venture 
to think that a more extended study of these plants would lead to the 
adoption of some more varietal forms than at present, and very 
probably also to some rearrangement.
There are drawbacks to the 
study of the forms of Epijiactis in the facts that they are rarely 
found in any quantity so as to allow of the comparison of many 
individuals whilst fresh, and that, unless very unusual care be 
taken in the pressing, there is little to be made out about the 
flowers from dried specimens.
It is best to detach one or two 
flowers, and spread out the label between slips of paper, so as to

exhibit its form.
Mr. Baker tells me that he has met with a 
limestone Epipactis in the Lake district, which he at first thought 
might be oralis, but which he afterwards decided to be latifolia.
It 
seems likely to be identical with the Herefordshire plant.

The Ghjceria which is so abundant in the lower reaches of

— There are two forms of (x.
plicata ; 
one, which I suppose to be the typical plant of Fries, is glaucous, 
with blunt broad leaves, which are folded in vernation ; the other, 
a much taller plant, quite green, like G.Jluitans, and with narrow- 
pointed simply-folded leaves, and with a much larger panicle ; 
both of these, as well as G.
pediceUata, were observed by Mr. C.
Bailey and myself about the upper Eeservoirs of the Via Gellia.
These forms seem to have received little notice from botanists, but 
their diiferences are obvious if a little attention is given to them.
Of G.
pediceUata the fruit seems invariably abortive, if not infested 
with ergot, to which it is peculiarly liable.
I observe that Mr.
Townsend in his original description gave no account of the cary-

puberulous; style a little longer than calyx, with a capitate stigma.
A poor specimen in immature fruit was sent me in 1882 by Mr.
Vincent, with the vernacular name of " Tampale," and is referred 
to in his Report on the Ceylon Forests (par, 106, 147) as " Vatica 
sp.," and described as a fine timber-tree.
I have since received 
good flowering specimens collected in June, 1884, by Capt.
Walker, 
Forester, at Polukanawa in the same district ; and this gentleman 
is endeavouring to obtain also ripe fruit, which it is very desirable 
to examine.
V. ohscura is apparently a near ally of V.
ajjinis Thw., 
a tree of the S.W. of Ceylon, but ripe fruit may show them to be 
more distinct than now appears.
The principal differences consist 
in the narroAver and thinner leaves with twice as many lateral veins, 
the less deeply divided calyx with more obtuse segments, and the 
larger flowers of V.
uhscura.
I was at first inclined to refer the 
latter, from descriptions only, to V.
Umcea/ulia Bl.
{Vatica Hoxh.), 
of East Bengal, but Mr. Thiselton Dyer, to whom I submitted a 
specimen, thinks it certainly not that plant.
All these belong to Wight's Isan.vis, a good genus, but not 
requiring a new name, being the original Vatica of Linnfeus.
V. 
cldnensis L., the type of the genus (figured in J.
E. Smith's Ic. Ined.
t. 36), is clearly the same as V.
Uoxbun/hiana Bl.,* the common 
" Mendora" of Ceylon ; but I suppose this specific name may have 
to be regarded as a "nomen falsum," as the plant does not grow in 
China.
In this genus the calyx-segments are all equally enlarged 
in fruit.
Included also in Vatica by the authors of the ' Genera 
Plantarum' are other species to form a section, unfortunately termed 
Eu-vatica, in which two only of tlie calyx-segments are greatly 
enlarged ; on the principles followed for genera in this family, this 
should rather be considered as distinct; and as it seems to be 
Snna2)tcaj- of Griffith that name may be adopted.
To it belongs 
Vateria {Stcmonoporus) scabrinscida Thw. Enum.
p. 404 [Vatica 
A. DC), the fruit of which has been discovered more recently, and 
probably also F.
disticha Thw.
/. c, of which the fruit is still 
unknown.
The fruiting- calyx of this genus is much like that of 
Hupea (in which, as "Sect.
2," A.
DC.
includes Sunaptea <jrandi- 
Jinra) ; but the segments are free and loose, not twisted and 
imbricated, as in Hopea {i.

There can, however, be little doubt 
that it is allied to S.

shape of the leaves, in the petals, and in the number and form of 
the stamens.
I have not met with this species myself, nor do I know precisely

There is a young tree of this species in the Botanic Gardens, 
but it has not yet flowered; the leaf-specimens (C.

In the absence 
of fruit some doubt may be felt as to the genus ; if a Shorea, as is 
most probable, it is not very closely allied to the other Ceylon species.
Shorea stipulari^ Thw., var.
minor Thw. ms.
— Leaves smaller 
than the type, about 3 in.
long, the apex strongly twisted, very 
finely but densely pubescent beneath ; stipules less persistent, more 
acute and narrower, densely pubescent, as also the young growths.

type the leaves often reach 9-12 in.
in length on petioles of 3-4 in., 
which are much thickened and fleshy.
The flowers of this curious 
species are still unknown, but there are young trees in the Gardens 
which will, it may be hoped, in time supply them.
I collected in 
the Morowe Korle another variety with the leaves almost rotund in 
outline, with a very marked short acumination.
This species is frequently the subject of a curious malformation.
Hard rounded pale green bodies are produced in the leaf-axils, 
consisting of half-fused masses of very short crowded coral-like 
abortive branchlets, the lobulated ends of which form the surface of 
the mass, which is covered with a viscous exudation.
These are 
probably abortive and metamorphosed inflorescences.
Doona oblonga Thw. ms.
— Leaves 3^-4^ in.
long by 1^-1^ in.
broad, narrowly oval-oblong, rounded at base, gradually caudate- 
acuminate ; margin recurved; lateral veins 8-11 on each side, 
parallel, curved, distinct; flowers not seen; fruiting calyx-segments 
not more than 1^ in.
long, oval-oblong, faintly veined.

(no locality).
This is very near D.
congestiflora Thw., but differs in the leaves 
and in the short broad calyx-segments of the fruit.
Vateria nervosa Thw. ms.
— Leaves lanceolate-oblong, 
81-5 in.
long, caudate -acuminate at apex, wedge-shaped at base, 
pale beneath, with few, faint, arched, lateral veins connected by 
reticulation ; the base somewhat 3-nerved ; flowers and fruit 
unknown.
Hab. Hewessee, Pasdun Korle, Sept., 1865.
(C.
P. 3815 in 
Herb.
Perad.).
The material is scarcely sufficient, but Dr. Thwaites seems to 
have been satisfied that he had here a new species.
It apparently 
comes nearest to V.
[Stemonoporus) nitida Thw., var.
lancifolia 
Dyer.
Thwaites' genus Stemonopoms is a very distinct group 
confined to Ceylon, and perhaps on a general revision of the order 
may make good its claim to re -separation from Vateria.
Triumfetta conspicua Trim.
— Semi-shrubby ; stems 3-5 ft.
high, cylindrical, much branched, wiry, rough with stellate hairs ; 
branches elongated, erect, ascending; leaves suborbicular, rather 
broader than long, with a caudate base and acute apex, irregularly 
crenate-dentate and finely 3-lobed, quite glabrous above, pale and 
with a pubescence of stellate hairs beneath ; inflorescence much 
elongated and quite leafless, with rather distant irregular paniculate 
clusters of stalked crowded flowers ; sepals with a rather long 
curved spreading apiculus, densely stellate-pubescent, reddish ; 
petals quite as long as the sepals, broad-spathulate, with long 
claws, spreading, ciliate at base, brilhant yellow ; stamens 20 ; 
fruit globose or nearly so, f in.
long or more with the spines, 
rather densely covered with short stiff simple yellowish hairs and 
with hard spreading hooked red spines, the lower parts of which 
are set with similar hairs.

showy plant.
The whole covering of the plant consists of stellate 
hairs.
1 am nnable to fit this into any of tlie descriptions in the Indian 
books.
I have met with it nowhere else in Ceylon than the above 
spot.
From T.
rhomhoidea Jacq.
it differs in the character of the 
hair, in its rotmidate leaves glabrous above, quite naked inflorescence, 
and larger flowers nearly \ in.
wide.
The flower-buds are elongated 
and cylindrical, hoary, dilated at the apex, where they are covered 
by a star formed of the 5 spreading sepal-appendages.
T. rhomhoidea 
is of course an abundant weed in Ceylon, and varies somewhat in 
amount, but not in character, of pubescence, which is never stellate.
Eugenia (Eu-eugenia) phillyreoides Trim.
— Shrubby, much 
branched ; leaves numerous, crowded, small, stiff and rigid, linear- 
lanceolate, tapering at both ends, especially into the short petiole, 
subobtuse ; midrib prominent ; lateral veins obscure; margin revo- 
lute, glabrous (the youngest only with scanty appressed silky white 
hairs), dark green, paler beneath ; flowers (not seen) always axillary, 
solitary, stalked; fruit the size of a sloe, depresso-globose, with a 
flat top, crowned by the short conical style, wide disk, and 4 enlarged 
persistent spreading rather unequal calyx- segments, 2 obtuse and 
2 acute; seeds 2 or 3, plano-convex.
Hab. Summit of Kalupahane Kande, Lagalla, East Matale, 
May, 1884.
A small dense twiggy bush with numerous erect 
branchlets.
Leaves rarely exceeding 1 in.
with the petioles.
Fruit 
red, pubescent when young, afterwards smooth, on peduncles 
i-f in.
long.
This does not nearly approach any other Ceylon species ; from 
the descriptions given, E.
Jossinia Duth.
[Jossinia indica Wight), of 
South India, must, however, be nearly allied, though quite distinct.
Eugenia (Eu-eugenia) Haeckeliana Trim.
— Branches cylin- 
drical, the young shoots floccose-woolly, with fulvous tomentum ; 
leaves broadly oblong-ovate, more or less cordate at base, subacute, 
thick, the margin somewhat undulated ; midrib thick and prominent 
beneath, the lateral veins (about 12 on either side) conspicuous and 
united by strong arches at some distance £fom the margin, glabrous 
and bright green when mature, densely covered when young with 
close yellow tomentum ; petiole stout, very short ; flowers large, 
solitary, on short stout peduncles coming from the axils of opposite 
leafy bracts on the young shoots below or alternating with the 
ordinary leaves ; bracts a little longer than the peduncles ; calyx- 
tube with two smaller bracts immediately below it, all fulvous- 
woolly ; calyx-lobes 4, broad, acute, slightly recurved in flowering, 
afterwards erect ; petals rather longer than the calyx-lobes ; disk 
broad, square, densely woolly ; fruit (not ripe) spherical, crowned 
by the calyx-lobes.
Hab. Among rocks by the sea-shore at Weligana, South 
Province, Dec, 1882.
A small tree with reddish bark.
Leaves 
4-6 in.
long, with a tendency to be stiffly bent conduplicatcly on 
the arched midrib.
Flowers 1^ in.
wide; petals white, with a 
pink tinge.
This is readily distinguished by the flowers from Pl./idva Thw.,

which much resembles it in foliage.
The large bracts beneath the 
calyx are similar to those of the South Indian E.
J^occosa Bedd., 
near which the present species will stand.
I have named it in 
remembrance of my friend Prof.
Ernst Haeckel, of Jena, who spent 
six weeks in researches in marine zoology at the i)icturesque sea- 
side fishing- village where I collected it.
Sonerila Guneratnei Trim.
— Perfectly glabrous ; stems 
numerous, erect, 12-15 in.
high, slender, subquadrangular or 
nearly cylindrical, fiexuose, smooth and shining, bare below, 
irregularly branched above, branches long ascending or droopmg ; 
leaves apparently whorled, 4 at each node, but in reality in two 
closely inserted decussate pairs, subsessile, strap-shaped, tapering 
below, obtuse at apex, entire below, but with 3 or 4 sharp teeth on 
either side in upper third, thick, with a strong midrib, deepened 
above, very prominent beneath ; flowers few, in short terminal 
unilateral racemes (often reduced to solitary flowers) ; pedicels 
short, straight, deflexed in bud ; calyx-tube 6-ribbed, the upper 
one-third or more free ; teeth fleshy, deciduous ; petals spreading 
horizontally ; stamens as long as petals, all bent upward ; anthers 
long, tapering to slightly curved elongated points ; style curved 
like the anthers ; roof of ovary formed of three erect fleshy processes 
together forming a conical surrounding the base of the style ; 
capsule erect and little longer the stalk into which it tapers, 
cylindrical, truncate, enclosed in strongly 6-ribbed calyx-tube ; 
seeds numerous, muriculate, orange-brown.
Hab. Near Hewessee, Pasdun Korle, first collected in August, 
1868.
(C.
P. 4012 in Hb. Perad.).
A small straggling semi-shrubby perennial, the stems vinous- 
red, slightly thickened at the nodes.
Leaves ^-f in.
long by ^ in.
broad, the basal portion erect, then bent and spreading.
Flowers 
coming in bloom singly in each raceme ; petals f in.
long, bright 
deep pink, with a mauve tinge ; anthers bright sulphur-yellow.
The very narrow leaves, in fours, give this a very diflerent aspect 
from all its Ceylon congeners, and appear to distinguish it from all 
other species.
S. linearis Hk. f., from Moulmein, has apparently 
even narrower leaves, and is evidently nearly allied.
The specific 
name commemorates its discoverer, Don Leman de Silva Guneratue, 
Mohandiram, the native plant-collector to the Botanical Gardens, 
Peradeniya, which post he has held for many years, and under 
successive Superintendents and Directors.
He was the constant 
cumpanion of my predecessors Gardner and Thwaites (as of myself) 
in their excursions, and the former died in his arms in 1849.
He 
possesses a wide knowledge of the Singhalese Flora, and it is 
perhaps not too much to say that nearly the whole of the species 
described by the two botanists mentioned passed through his hands 
as collector ; Dr. Thwaites acknowledges his intelligent co-operation 
in the preface to tlie ' Enumeratio.' 
Hedyotis rhinophylla Thw. ms.
— Glabrous, the young shoots 
finely grey-puberulous ; branches subcylindrical ; leaves scarcely 
stalked, but much tapering to tbe base and apex, narrowly lanceo-

long, the mouth fringed when young with a few stout unequal 
deciduous processes, when old truncate ; Howers in terminal loose 
pyramidal paniculate cymes, on slender pedicels rather longer than 
the calyx ; calyx-limb glabrous, campanulate, veiny, with shallow 
broad-triangular teeth ; capsule small, not protruded beyond the 
enlarged calyx.
Hab. Wattekelle Hill, Kallebokka District, Central Province, 
Sept., 1868.
(C.
P. 3984 in Hb. Perad.).
Apparently a small shrub with ascending slender whitish 
branches.
Leaves 2-3 in.
long, quite glabrous.
Flowers medium- 
size of the genus, white ; corolla-lobes puberulous within.
Seeds 
not seen.
This is a distinct species of the small group allied to the very 
variable H..

SUPPLE MENTAKY LIST OF PHILIPPINE PLANTS.
By B.
a. Eolfe, A.L.S.
In the recently published third or folio edition of Blanco's 
'Flora de Filipinas ' a "Novissima Appendix" is given, the object 
of which is to include all that is known of the Flora of the Islands 
up to the date of publication.
In this Appendix the widely scattered 
references have been carefully brought together, and, so far as 
plants actually known from the Philippines are concerned, it is a 
great convenience to have them collected together in this way.
In 
one respect, however (as I have pointed out in my paper in the 
'Journal of the Linnean Society,' xxi., p.
288), the Appendix is 
especially disappointing.
It is this — that in several orders where 
very little has been published respecting Philippine plants, the 
authors identify nearly all their plants with descriptions of species 
from India or the Malay Archipelago, with the result that large 
numbers are wrongly identified, and the endemic element is almost 
entirely ignored.
This fact especially shows up the difficulty of 
satisfactorily working out a Flora without the material having been 
carefully compared with existing types.
The fact is a most un- 
fortunate one, and can only be remedied gradually as the materials 
come to hand.
The following list consists of plants which have been omitted in 
the above-named Appendix, and under the circumstances it may 
perhaps be worth while to publish it in the present form : —

PELOEIA IN HABENARTA BIFOLIA Br.
By H.
N. Kidley, M.A., F.L.S.
Mr. BouLftER has lately put into my hands a curious monstrosity 
of Hahenaria hi folia Br.
, in which the lip is exactly similar in form, tex- 
ture, and size to the petals, and there is no trace of any spur.
This 
occurs in every flower on the spike.
Although I am not acquainted 
with any similar instance in this genus, it is not unknown in other 
genera, such as Cattleya and Lcdia.
There is a figure of a similar 
monstrosity in Cattleya pumila in the ' Gardeners' Chronicle,' 
May 9th, 1885, p.
597, and it is most probable that Paxtonia rosea 
is a peloriated form of a SpatJiioylottis.
But there is a point of 
greater interest in some of the flowers of the Hahenaria.
From the 
base of the column arise two white foliaceous bodies, ovate, oblong, 
and obtuse, curved up in front of the column.
These are doubtless 
the stigmatic lobes, which are never normally developed into pro- 
cesses in any of our British Orchids ; but in many of the Habenarias 
of tropical countries, such as H.
macroceras of S.
America and West 
Indies, they take the form — as in this monstrosity — of flattened 
foliaceous organs, or of terete arms of greater or shorter length.
This malformation may thus be set down as an uistance of reversion 
to an older type.
The genus Platanthera being now reduced by Mr. Bentham to a 
section of Hahenaria, from which genus, indeed, it is impossible to 
separate it by any definite characters, it becomes necessary to alter 
the generic name Platanthera.
It is customary in such cases to 
preserve the old specific name where possible ; and with respect to 
SHOKT NOTES.
219 
our British species tliis is satisfactory in every case but one, viz., 
PlatiinthL'ra chlorantha Curt.
[Orclm bifolia Richard), O.
virescens 
Gaud., O.
ochroleuca Ten., P.
Wankelii Rchb.
f., P.
montana Rchb.
f., 
Habenaria chlorantha Babington.
Unfortunately the last stands for 
a Mauritius plant with really green flowers, described by Sprengel 
(Syst.
Veget.
iii.
p. 691), so a new name must be imposed; and I 
propose that of Habenaria chloroleuca for the plant, which describes 
the actual colour of the flowers more satisfactorily than clilurantha.
The remaining British plants now included in the genera are —

SHORT NOTES.
Note on the Algo-Lichen Hypothesis.
— In addition to the 
various direct and indirect arguments which have been adduced 
against this theory, another, and in some respects a still more 
convincing proof, has quite recently been brought under notice by 
Dr. Nylander in 'Flora' (1885, p.
313).
In his observations upon 
Gyalecta Lamprospora Nyl., a new species from North America 
collected by Mr. Willey, of which a full diagnosis is given, he 
writes : — •" Each gonidium of this Gyalecta is distinctly seen to 
emit from its thickish cellular wall (as do also the young gonidia) 
a firm medullary filament, and often two such filaments, charac- 
teristic of the nature of lichens.
It is most manifest that these 
licheno-hyphae are productions, and indeed continuations, of the 
cellular wall of the gonidium itself." In the species under notice 
it may be mentioned that the thallus is not corticated, and that the 
gonidia are most frequently chroolepoidly seriated and moderate.
Now this very important discovery of the veteran and distinguished 
Hellenist is, beyond all question, sufficient of itself at once to dis- 
prove Schwendenerism in all its phases.
For if the gonidia thus 
send forth filaments in the manner stated, then the gonidia clearly 
cannot be algals ; and if licheno-hyphae are thus produced by the 
gonidia, then these hyphae as clearly cannot be parasitic fungal 
mycelia.
On these grounds alone (apart from other considerations) 
this plausible hypothesis necessarily collapses, and "symbiosis" is 
seen to be but a mere fable.

— As it is Hot imposslble 
that, if looked for, the plant may be found elsewhere in Britain, it 
seems desirable to lose no time in recording the occurrence of 
Schamus ferruijineus L.
in Perthshire.
The specimens before me 
were collected beside Loch Tummel, in July last, by my friend Mr.
Brebuer ; but it is only now that, in beginning an examination of 
220 
SHOKT NOTES.
the Perthshire Cifperacea,, I have determined the species.
From its 
European distribution — from Scandinavia southwards to S.E.
France, and eastwards to Thrace and Middle Eussia — S.ferruf/ineus 
was a species not unlikely to occur in Britain.
Though bearing a 
certain resemblance to S.
nic/ricans, it is abundantly distinct from 
that species.
As my specimens are not in fruit, I reserve a full 
description till I have an opportunity of visiting the locality where 
Mr. Brebner found the plant.
In the meantime, however, I may 
indicate some of the points of difference between it and S.
nu/Hcans.
In the first place S.ferrugineus is more slender in all its parts than 
S. nu/ricaiis, and as the spike has generally only two spikelets, and 
often only one, it is narrow and oblong rather than obovoid.
In 
the second place the lower bract is only about as long as, or a little 
shorter than, the sjiike, and its subulate point is erect instead of 
oblique.
In the third place the dorsal keel of the glumes is either 
quite smooth or, more rarely, very slightly rough.
The Loch 
Tummel specimens, which much resemble German and Swiss speci- 
mens in my herbarium, are from seven to eleven inches long, and 
have very short leaves.

Ferns new to N.
S. Wales.
— In a collection of ferns made 
recently near Illawarra, S.
Australia, which Mr. Baker has kindly 
named for me, are three species — Xephrodium hispklum Hook., 
Hymenophyllum imdtifidum Sw., and H.
varium Br., not hitherto 
recorded for the colony.

New Anglesey Station for Chamagrostis minima.
— I have just 
received specimens of this grass, collected this month, from a 
station in Anglesey not previously reported, namely, at Khos-neigir, 
m the neighbourhood of Cymmeran Bay. The only other Anglesey 
station for this plant is on the western side of Llyn Coron, a small 
lake about half a mile long, close to the Bodorgon station, on the 
Chester and Holyhead Eailway.
The new locality for this rare 
British grass is about five miles in a north-westerly direction fi-om 
Llyn Coron, and for its discovery we are indebted to Mrs. John 
Plant, the wife of the Curator of the Peel Park Museum, Salford.

Bedfordshire Plants.
— In the excellent list of Bedfordshire 
plants given by Mr. James Saunders in this Journal for 1883, 
Papaver hi/bridiwi.
L. finds no place.
It has grown in the chalky 
corn and clover fields, close to the base of the hills, by the downs 
to the west of Dunstable, and has grown there for many years.
Abbot speaks of the plant as common in Bedfordshire.
Papaver 
Ar(jemone L.
grows with it, and is the more abundant of the two.
CepJiahmthera grandifiora Bab., stated to be rare by Abbot and 
Mr. Saunders, grows in the northern section of the long plantation 
of beeches, firs, and larches bordering the Eoman Eoad on the west 
of Dunstable.
This locality is not given by either of the authors 
mentioned.

The appearance of this long-expected book will be highly 
welcome to every lover of plants.
So classical a work requires no 
recommendation to a botanical public ; but it is worthy of perusal 
by every natural scientist, although he may have no intention of 
making a special study of the Hieracia.
The mass of matter in the book is enormous ; in the course of 
more than twenty years' labour the authors acquired a knowledge 
of such an immense number of forms distinct and constant, of every 
gradation, that in order to prevent its assuming colossal proportions 
they were compelled to discard a certain number : nevertheless 
the number of distinct species amounts to 164 ; to most of them a 
larger or smaller number of subspecies, varieties, and subvarieties 
are attached, so that the grand total of described forms — "kindreds," 
as the author calls them — is 2000.
To have examined this vast 
accumulation of material, to have carefully sifted and arranged it, 
and at last described it all in the clearest manner, so that everyone 
who does not fight shy of serious study may have at hand a sure 
and safe guide into the region of these forms, is the chief merit of 
this mighty work — a true monument of German scientific industry 
at which no one will withhold his astonishment who knows what 
labour of the kind really signifies.
The arrangement of the systematic portion is as follows : — The 
subgenus ViluseUa is in the first instance divided into acmdia and 
ccndigera ; next the acaidia are subdivided into two, and the cauligera 
into seven sections ; in each of these sections are the chief or typical 
species as characteristics ; then follow the intermediates and 
hybrids — those first which are within the section, next those con- 
nected with the preceding one.
The subspecies of the polymorphic

nische Zeitschrift' foi' May last.

kinds are then for perspicuity's sake collected together into groups 
(ffreges).
A systematic conspectus and a determining table at the 
end of the book serve to facilitate the survey and the study of it : 
a separate section determines the characters of the dried specimens 
supplied from various collectors ; the most considerable collection 
is that of Peter himself, consisting of 300 in number.
Thus far we have been occupied with the systematic divisions 
only, of value to the botanist especially ; the other divisions are 
more generally interesting.
First of all the morphology of the 
various groups is treated of, their innovation, relations, and certain 
biological characteristics indicated ; then the various points dis- 
cussed bearing upon their behaviour under cultivation, those which 
are constant distinguished from those which are variable, and so 
forth.
In the section headed "The species and its component 
parts" it is shown that the kindred forms are of unequal systematic 
value, and that the species consists partly of individual kindred 
forms and partly of groups of them ; and an attempt is made to 
explain in graphic demonstrations by means of divers examples the 
phytogenetic origin of the kindred forms through variation and 
divergence, and the influence exercised by the dying-out of them.
With regard to the systematic treatment of the subject, it is 
affirmed that not all the kindred forms connected with each other 
by intermediate links are to be considered as constituting a species, 
because in that case the first and the last members of the series 
would be less related to one another than to many others not con- 
nected by kindred ties in cases where an hiatus occurs from 
accidental circumstances, viz., extinction.
The manifold relations of the series one to another are repre- 
sented by several graphic illustrations.
Further, an attempt has 
been made to settle the manner in which the individual characters 
have philogenetically developed themselves ; which of them are of 
recent, which of earlier origin, thus indicating a pedigree, as it were, 
of the Piloselloids.
The multiplication of forms through hybrids is 
particularly treated of ; and it is pointed out that in this way no 
new phenomena are produced, but only new combinations of 
characters already existent ; and that the kindred form conditions 
are scarcely altered, because of their rare occurrence.
For the 
rest, the hybrids in the work before us are considered as inter- 
mediate forms, and designated individually by name.
The chapter 
on geographical distribution will be read with especial interest, for 
it is not confined to the Piloselloids, but gives us a sketch of the 
origin of the Central European Flora in general.
Particular 
sections are devoted to the means for working at monographs, 
literature, collections, travels, cultivation, method of work, and an 
account of nomenclature.
As the views of systematists with regard 
to the systematic value of the kindred forms distinguished by the 
authors may vacillate, a non-recurrent name has very properly been 
given to every subspecies and important variety.
Of course it is not every systematist who will coincide with the 
ideas of species entertained by the authors.
If the views of the 
authors that the gaps between existhig species arc to be explained 
NOTICES OF BOOKS.
223 
by tlie extinction or dying-out of the intermediate forms — and 
therefore by an accidental occurrence — be correct, then of course 
there would be nothing to object to in their proceedings as regards 
the exclusion of intermediate forms from a series of graduated 
transitions between two species, which would not then be sharply 
defined on either side ; for if the intermediate forms of the species 
now isolated had not died out, they would have to be included with 
the others in the same girdle ; and if, for example, all the forms 
which have ever originated in the genus Hieracium were still in 
existence, the distinction of species generally would be nothing 
more than an arbitrary cutting-up of the network of forms into 
approximately equal-sized portions.
At least the views of the 
authors tend to this conclusion ; for they see in those minute 
variations, as they occur so multifariously in the Hieracia especially, 
the beginnings of species-formation, and believe that these have 
always commenced with small steps of the kind, and that existent 
gaps in the series are explicable simply by the dying-out process.
We are well aware that these views — also entertained by Darwin 
— are prevalent among the majority of enquirers ; nevertheless we 
would remind them that they are, after all, mere speculations to 
which facts cannot always be tacked on without force.
Experience 
indicates rather that species-formation is not always consequent 
upon small gradations, but that at all times and perhaps in certain 
seasons more rapid transformations have taken place ; so that we 
might even, with 0.
Heer, speak of a species mctutnorphosis.
In 
this light the gaps between the isolated species would acquire a 
higher significance, and one could no longer consider these frag- 
ments of a closely woven circle of forms originating in very small 
steps of variation as their equivalents in value.
Want of sjiace un- 
fortunately prevents us from going deeper into these matters, besides 
which such purely theoretical notions have no bearing upon the 
practical value of the book under consideration.
As regards the 
form of it, it may seem rather strange that Latin, sometimes by 
itself and sometimes together with German, is used for the diagnoses 
of the species and of the groups, while for the subspecies and 
varieties only German is employed.
We think the adoption of one 
language would have been more appropriate.
The book is admirably 
got up.

A MONOGRAPH OF THE GENUS fiRTHYLLIS.
By J.
G. Baker, F.R.S.
(Plates 259, 260.) 
The Massonian drawings of GethilUs, which I have just had the 
pleasure of studying at the British Museum, add very materially to 
our knowledge of the genus.
So far as I am personally concerned 
their discovery at this present juncture is most timely and satis- 
factory, as I have been busily engaged this winter in working out 
the Amaryllidacefe for my colleague Mr. Thiselton Dyer's con- 
tinuation of Harvey and Sonder's ' Flora Capensis.' The genus is 
very poorly represented in the London herbaria, and but little 
better in that of Thuuberg, of which, through the kindness of the 
authorities of the Museum at Upsala, I had the loan some time 
ago.
The flowers are very fugitive, and, as they appear at a 
different time of year from the leaves, it is a task of much doubt and 
difficulty to sort out properly the dried specimens.
As this series 
of drawings by Masson contains full sketches of seven out of nine 
species, two of them entirely unknown before and two others 
described from the leaves alone, it advances our knowledge of the 
genus very considerably.

* [These drawings, with others to the number of nearly 100, were presented 
to the Department of Botany by Mr. Charles Lee, son of Mr.
.John Lee 
(inadvertently called James on p.
123 of Journ.

of the James Lee of Hammersmith to whom they were sent by Masson.
My 
own share in the discovery is really confined to the interest which it was 
fortunate enough to excite in the Messrs.
Lee, who were good enough to 
institute a renewed search for the drawings, with gratifying results.

BOTANICAL NOTES ALONG THE RIVERS NORE, 
BLACKWATER, &c.
By Henry Chichester Hart.
The River Nore rises on the northern flanks of the Devil's-bit 
range of mountains in the north-east of Tipperary.
Flowing 
north of east to near the middle of the Queen's County, it then 
turns south and makes its way through the County Kilkenny to 
meet the Barrow near New Ross.
The union of the two rivers 
forms the northern arm of the Waterford Estuary.
On the 5th July, 1884, my friend and I left Templemore, and 
came on the Nore at the base of the hills in which it takes its 
source.
For the first few miles no plant of rarity was gathered.
Bee Orchis was in flower in two or three places, and several gay 
species decorated the hedges and river banks of this rather un- 
interesting country.
These were chiefly Hijpericum Androstpinum, 
Viburnum Opulus, Eupatorium cannahinum, and Orchis pyramidalis.
Elder and twayblade [Sambiicics nigra, Listera ovata), are also 
abundant species.
Juncus glaucus not infrequent.
The river here flows over an ancient oak-forest, its bed being 
full of contorted arms, stems, and roots, in situ ; these lie beneath 
thick beds of turf, through which the water has cut its channel.
Ere long the turf disappears, and we come on rich soil lying on 
rounded glacial gravel deposit, on which the river-bed now lies.
Great beds of Fotamogeton natans usurp the stream, and labourers 
with scythes are at work mowing the pond-weed beneath the 
water.
For a considerable space they have to do this annually.
The fall of the river is so slight that any impediment to the stream 
produces stoppages and a flood.
Near Borris-in-Ossory,.:I^-ia7-^ia hispida, Thrincia hirta, Tragopogon 
pratensis are common in meadows by the stream.
Salix pevtandra, 
a questionable native, is not infrequent, and a little farther very 
large moonwort, Botrgchum Lunaria, nearly a foot in height, with 
Lgsimachia rulgaris, were noted.
On our first night we obtained 
beds at Mountrath.
Below Mountrath (Enanthe Fhellandrium 
sparingly, and the rare Nasturtium sylvestre, were the most
