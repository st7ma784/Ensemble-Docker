Dillenius.
I'erennial.
May, June.
Root spindle-shaped.
Stem 2 feet high, branched, swelled at the 
joints, leafy, round, smooth.
Leaves smooth, very deeply pin- 
natifid, as Prof.
DeCandolle justly obsei-ves, rather than pin- 
nate ; their lobes 2 or 3 pair, with a larger terminal one, all 
rounded, bluntly lobed and notched ; the lateral ones sometimes 
dilated at their lower margin, near the base, almost as if auri- 
cled ; their colour a deep shining green.
Fl. bright yellow, in 
umbels on long, often hairy, stalks.
Calyx tawny, often hairy.
Seeds black and shining, each with a whitish deciduous crest.
Every part is brittle, and, when broken, discharges an orange- 
coloured, fetid juice, with which, as Dioscorides reports.
Swal- 
lows were supposed to restore the sight of their young if blinded ; 
whence the name, formed from the greek appellation of a Swal- 
low.
Dioscorides favours another meaning, which is that the 
plant appears and disappears with those birds.
Its orange juice 
probably caused it to be given in the jaundice.
Our variety /3, characterized by the jagged foliage and petals, first 
mentioned as an English plant, though merely as a variety, by 
Dillenius, not Ray, has recently been made a species by M.
De- 
Candolle and some other botanists.
Appearances are against it, 
though Miller found no alteration in plants raised from seed.

Pod linear, vei-y long, of 2 or 3 linear, 
concave valves, and as many cells.
Seeds numerous, 
convex at the outer side, pitted in regular lines, without 
a crest, disposed irregularly in 2 rows in each cell, being 
sunk in the hollows of a spongy or membranous par- 
tition, connected with the linear marginal receptacles.

which are placed between the edges of the valves, and 
bear the seeds on short stalks.
Jussieu doubted whether the spongy cellular body, in which 
the seeds are sunk, were really a partition ; but the mem- 
branous, likewise cellular, indubitable partitions of G.
vio- 
laceum, prove the true nature of that body, and he was 
too judicious to separate this last-mentioned species ge- 
nericully from the rest.
Prof.
Hooker having examined 
only one species, G.
luteum, was led by Jussieu into a mis- 
take, and found fault with Gaertner's figure of G.
phoeni- 
ceum, which is peculiarly excellent and correct.
Annual or biennial herbs, mostly glaucous, with yellow fetid 
juice.
Leaves more or less pinnatifid and subdivided ; 
the upper ones sessile.
Floxvers solitary, stalked, lateral 
or terminal, yellow, scarlet, or violet, very handsome.

Root slender.
Stem erect, branched, leafy, a foot high, round, 
even, and generally quite smooth ; rarely somewhat hairy.
Leaves dark green, nearly smooth, twice or thrice pinnatifid, witii 
linear, opposite or alternate, bluntish, bristle-pointed segments ; 
the lower ones stalked ; upper sessile.
Fl. on long, lateral, ax- 
illary, or terminal simple stalks, of a brilliant violet blue, very 
splendid, but extremely fugacious, somewhat larger than the 
last.
Pod 2 or 3 inches long, cylindrical, more or less cluthed 
with scattered, ascending, bristly prickles, separating when ripe 
into 3 flattish valves, sometimes 4, as in Morison's figure, with 
as many intermediate linear receptacles of the seeds, each united 
internally with a membranous, undulated or corrugated, pitted 
partition.
These partitions meet in the centre, dividing the 
pod into complete cells, though there is no central column.
Seeds like the other species, but smaller, attached by small stalks 
to the receptacles, and nestling, in a double row, in the hollows 
of the partitions.
Medicus, a writer best known as the " iniquissimiis censor" of Lin- 
naeus and his disciples, has in Usteri's Annalen der Botanick, v.
3. 9 — 19, (in the 2 1st page of which he is stigmatized with the 
above designation,) divided the Linnaean Chclidonium, establish- 
ing Glaucium of Tournefort, and proposing another genus, 
founded on G.
violaceum, by the name of Rameria, after a late 
German botanist.
This genus is admitted by the able Prof.
De- 
Candolle, whence it becomes an object of attention ; for Medi- 
cus and his writings have in general not been found worthy of 
much regard.
My learned friend chiefly depends on the fol- 
lowing characters to distinguish Rcemeria, "a capsule of 3 or 4 
valves, and a single cell, the receptacles, though cellular, or 
pitted, not being combined together." But he describes one 
species with only two valves, which abrogates the former cha- 
racter; and the cellular extension of the receptacles, though not 
spongy, is otherwise exactly analogous to the partitions of the 
bivalve species, constituting, in fact, real and complete parti- 
tions, meeting, though not combined, in the centre of the fruit; 
and they identify the partitions of the bivalve species, which Jus- 
sieu was led, by the analogy of this natural order, to doubt.
Linnaeus has remarked that there are few genera in which some 
part or other of the fructification does not occasionally form an 
exception to the generic character ; and this is no less true of 
natural orders.

The whole herb is glaucous, and generally smooth, though the 
Jlower -stalks now and then bear several rigid, spreading, bristly 
hairs.
Stem 3 or 4 feet high, erect, branched, leafy.
Leaves 
broad, wavy, lobed and bluntly notched, clasping the stem with 
their heart-shaped base.
FL 3 inches broad, blueish white, with 
a broad violet spot at the base of each petal.
Such are all the

In gardens double varieties, of 
every shade of purple, scarlet, crimson, and even green, mixed

The milky juice, when dried, becomes Opium, which, as Haller 
well observes, is far more potent and dangerous in hot countries 
than in our cooler climates.
The capsules boiled afford a gently 
narcotic infusion, and used to be kept in the shops j but the 
foreign Opium is more certain, and more manageable, in proper 
hands, such as alone ought to direct its use.

Caps, elliptic-oblong, of 4 or 5 cells, 
with as many ribs, or receptacles, which elevate the convex, 4-

diate valves at the top, have the appearance of a short style.
By 
this character the present species has been separated from Pa- 
paver, by some able botanists, but I think on insufficient grounds, 
whatever may be the true nature of certain American plants as- 
sociated with it, which I have not sufficiently investigated.
Ex- 
cept the elongation just described, this cap.mle has much of the 
structure of Argemone mexicana, see Gaertner, t.
60, which has 
but slight traces of the dilated receptacles, or imperfect par- 
titions, of Papaver.

Root tuberous, horizontal, sending down numerous long, stout ra- 
dicles, which are fibrous at the extremity.
Letwes floating, a span 
widcj oval-heartshaped, with nearly parallel or close lobes at 
the base, entire, smooth, their radiating veins underiieaLh not 
prominent, in which it differs from the American N.
odnratu.
Footstalks and Jtower-stalks cylindrical.
Flowers 4 or 5 inches 
wide, white, with yellow stamens and pistil, the upper surface of 
the calyx-leaves white, often tinged with pale red, altogether 
very beautiful, though destitute of scent.
They expand in sun- 
shine, and the middle of the day only, closing towards evening, 
when they recline on the surface of the water, or sink beneath 
it.
The bernj gradually decays at the bottom of the water, scat- 
tering its seeds in the mud.
Every part of the herb is highly 
vascular, perspiring rapidly, and, though so succulent, drying 
very soon.
It is perhaps the most magnificent of our native 
flowers.
The sinking of the flowers under water at night having 
been doubted, or at least denied, 1 have been careful to verify 
it in this species.
The same circumstance is recorded of the 
Egyptian N.
Lotus, horn the most remote antiquitv.
The stimulus 
of light, which indeed acts evidently on many other blossoms 
and leaves, expands and raises, with peculiar force, these splen- 
did white flowers, that the pollen may reach the stigma unin- 
jured ; and when that stimulus ceases to act, they close again, 
drooping by their own weight, to a certain depth.
The still m.ore 
ponderous fruit finally sinks to the bottom.

They perhaps communicate 
this flavour by infusion to the cooling liquors, or Siierbets, so 
much used in the Levant.
The seed-vessel, a coated berry, 
when ripe, bursts irregularly, as Prof.
Hooker well observes, 
not dissolving away into a mass of pulp like the Nymphcea.
Linnaeus once considered these plants as monocotyledonous, but he 
afterwards corrected that ill-founded opinion, and the question 
is set at rest by Prof.
Hooker's complete figures.
Yet they indu- 
bitably belong to M.Richard's class of EHrforr/i/'z^e, having an 
internal radicle ; and they afford in fact one, among many 
instances, of this ingenious physiologist's two great classes, En- 
dorrhizce and Exorrhizce, not corresponding uniformly with the 
Monocotyledones and Dicotyledones of other botanists, as it is 
much to be wished they could have done.
All these difficulties 
however, in able hands, must gradually lead to truth.

Timm is no authority for the above name, as he confounded this

writers who have adopted that given by Hoffmann, which, 
though I overlooked it, is prior to mine.
Priority in nomencla- 
ture is a just claim ; but neither that, nor any authority, should 
be allowed in favour of an unscientific, erroneous, or illiterate 
appellation, whether specific or generic.
I have in general si- 
lently rejected such, avoiding controversy, and leaving the de- 
cision to those who may hereafter care about the matter.

This is certainly the Common Lime-tree of the north of Europe, 
which Linnaeus understood by T.
europcea, in his Species Plan- 
tarum, and, I presume, in his Flora Suecica.
The Swedish 
writers quoted by DeCandolle confirm this point, but the plate 
of Fl. Dan.
t. 553 seems to be our parvifolia.
T. europcea is 
cultivated all over England, and in many parts of Scotland, and 
though Ray could not meet with it indubitably wild, no one can 
doubt its being perfectly naturalized.
The French " growing 
tired of the Horse Chesnut," as Du Hamel reports, adopted 
this tree, for ornamental plantations, in the time of Louis 
XIV.
It generally composes the avenues about the residences 
of the French as well as English gentry of that date, and Fene- 
Ion, in conformity to this taste, decorates with "flowery Lime- 
trees" his enchanted isle of Calypso.
The bark of this, and 
perhaps some other species, makes the Russia garden -mats called 
Bast.
Bees collect much honey from the flowers.
The smooth, 
light, delicately white, and uniform wood, useful for some do- 
mestic purposes, served Gibbons for his inimitable carvings of 
flowers, dead game, &c., so often seen in old English houses.
An antient Lime of great magnitude, which grew where the an- 
cestors of Linnaeus had long resided, is said to have given them 
their family name, Linn being Swedish for a Lime-tree.

As tall a tree as the foregoing, with spreading, round hrovinbranches, 
hairy during the first season ; of a shining red in /3, but whether 
that variety be permanent, or whether all our Tilice have not red 
twigs occasionally, as Mr. E.
Forster thinks, appears doubtful.
Leaves as large as in T.
europcea, but less entire at the base, 
less pointed, and with rather longer foot stalks ; their upper 
surface bright green, minutely hairy about the ribs, and more 
or less so at the edges, between the serratures, as noticed by 
the too much neglected Bulliard ; under side rather paler, not 
glaucous, all over finely and softly downy, the ribs and veins 
curiously fringed, particularly just above the origin of each,

where there are, besides, small woolly tufts.

T. grandifolia is the wild Lime-tree of Switzerland and the south 
of Europe, as europcea is of the north.
They are unquestionably 
distinct species, though Ventenat was not aware of this, nor has 
he thrown much light upon the Europsean Tilia, whatever he 
may have done upon those of America.
The specific names of 
Ehrhart are prior to his, and greatly preferable, as being Latin, 
like the generic one.
Even .Ehrhart, usually so fond of hard 
Greek names, seems to have felt the propriety of this principle.
I wish all writers would consider it.
In Rees's Cyclopcedia the 
name of corallina is preferred to grandifolia, for reasons there 
given ; and in the 4th edition of the Compendium I was induced by 
Dillenius to make four British species of Tilia.
But this writer 
has here, I believe, as in other instances, added to Ray's Synop- 
sis a plant which was already described there by another name.
So Mr. E.
Forster thinks.
1 therefore now unite the corallina 
to grandifolia, giving a preference to the latter name, because 
the red twigs seem not to be peculiar to any one species.
The 
above description, except what regards this circumstance, is 
taken from the true grandifolia, nor have I been able to meet with 
iheflowers or fruit of the /3, though my-excellent friends Prof.
Williams and Mr. Aiton have very obligingly made every possible 
inquiry, the former at Oxford, and in the neighbouring country ; 
and the latter at Kew, Osterly andSion, as well as in the Royal 
plantations about Hampton Court and Windsor ; without any 
success.
The red twigs 1 suspect are most visible in the spring, 
and they certainly are sometimes observable in T.
europrea.
Mr. E.
Forster remarks that T.
grandifolia occurs in very old plan- 
tations as frequently as the europcea, but not in modern ones.
There are very large trees of it at Penshurst, and some at Wal- 
tham Abbey, the plantation of which is of very antient date.
Mrs. Beecroft brought a specimen from Blair of Athol, where 
are several old trees near the house.
Some famous old Limes in the church-yard of Sedlitz in Bohemia, 
reported to have miraculously borne hooded leaves, ever since 
the monks of a neighbouring convent were all hanged upon them, 
are our grandifolia.
I have an original specimen.

Tree.
August, a month later than T.
europcea.
Distinguished, at first sight, from both the foregoing species by its 
much smaller leaves, only 2 inches broad, sometimes scarcely 
longer than their slender footstalks, roundish heart-shaped, point- 
ed, sharply serrated, unequal at the base, often lobed towards 
the point } dark green and quite smooth above ; glaucous be- 
neath, with brown hairy tufts at the origin of each of their prin- 
cipal veins, as well as broad hairy blotches scattered over the 
surface j but these last are not invariably present.
Fl. smaller 
than in either of the former, very fragrant like a Honeysuckle, 
placed many together, in double or aggregate umbels or co- 
rymbs.
Bracteas seldom 2 inches long.
Germen depressed, 
densely woolly.
Stigma deeply five-lobed.
Capsules sparingly 
perfected, turbinate, slightly angular, thin and brittle, almost 
smooth, rarely containing more than one seed.
These three naturalized, if not all originally indigenous, species of 
Tilia being now, it is hoped, clearly distinguished, it may be 
worth the while of those who make use of their wood, to observe 
whether there be any difference between them as to its proper- 
ties.
According to the analogy of our Elms, T.
parvifolia should 
have the hardest wood, of the closest grain.
This species being 
planted along with the first and second, in avenues or parks, 
will ensure a longer succession of flowers than any of them 
alone.
The American kinds, with their white-backed leaves, 
make also an agreeable variety, and their/ou.'ers are very sweet- 
scented.

angular, invested with the closed permanent calyx of 5, 
10, or 3 more or less complete, cells, and as many valves ; 
partitions from the centre of each valve, sometimes very 
narrow.
Seeds numerous, small, angular, attached to the 
inner margin of each partition.
Stem shrubb}', or herbaceous.
Leaves simple, opposite or 
alternate, entire, with or without stipitlas, mostly stalked, 
more or less downy or hairy.
Fl. stalked, generally 
aggregate, terminal, yellow, white, or red, inodorous.
Stam.
in some irritable.
Caps, in the Cistus of Tourne- 
fort and his followers, woody, of 5 or 10 cells, but no 
central column ; in their Helianthemum more membra- 
nous, of 1 or 3 cells, the partitions in several species not 
broad enough to meet in the centre.
Linnaeus remarks.
Fund.
Bot. sect.
1 70, that " there rarely 
occurs a genus in which some part of the fructification 
does not wander ; " (prove uncertain in character, or not 
strictly limited).
Such is the case with the seed-vessel, 
and in some measure with the calyx, in Cistus.
The latter 
part always indeed consists of 3 inner and 2 outer leaves, 
but this difference is most observable in the Helianthe- 
mum tribe, whose 2 outer calyx-leaves are much the small- 
est.
The capsule moreover in this tribe has but 3 valves, 
each with a central partition, as in every Cistus ; but in 
some these partitions are not broad enough to make 3 
perfect cells, whence Jussieu proposes a shigle-celled cap- 
sule for the chief character of his Helianthemum ,• but in 
several species the separation is complete, and by this 
rule we might as well subdivide Helianthemum, as sepa- 
rate it from Cistus.
Linnaeus had carefully considered 
the question, and I think him most in the right.

If however the genus were allowed, which is a matter of 
opinion, the name is altogether inadmissible.
It is the 
same as HeliantJms, in meaning and derivation, the ter- 
mination only being varied.

Shrub.
July, August.
Of a more dwarf habit than the last.
Root woody, bearing many 
procumbent, or slightly ascending, round, downy, simple, leafy 
stems, each terminating in a simple downy cluster, of bright 
yellow_^oj/;ers, expanding in sunshine only, when their stamens 
if touched spread slowly, and lie down upon the petals.
Brac- 
teas lanceolate, smooth, fringed, one at the base of each flower- 
stalk.
These partial stalks are slender, hoary, various in direc- 
tion, more reflexed as the fruit advances.
CaZy.r smooth, or 
scarcely at all downy, between the strong bristly ribs of its 3 
larger reddish leaves ; the 2 outer leaves ten times smaller, 
spreading, lanceolate, mostly acute, green, smooth on both sides, 
their edges fringed with numerous bristly hairs.
Germen glo- 
bose, downy.
Capsule with very narrow receptacles, or imper- 
fect partitions.
The leaves of this species vary in breadth, and 
are more or less revolute ; green above, besprinkled with a 
few hairs ; densely downy, white, and hairy beneath.
Their 
usual form is linear-oblong, somewhat elliptical.
Stipulas lan- 
ceolate, acute, fringed, green on both sides, longer than the 
footstalks.
Ray says the flowers are very rarely white ; they are sometimes 
double in gardens.
This is a variable species, but less so than 
authors make it.
Few plants' are more difficult to define than 
the smaller kinds of Cistus.
The roseus and mutabilis of Jacquin 
surely differ from this, and numerous species of the south of Eu- 
rope, and the Alps, require to be studied and compared by a skil- 
ful and patient observer.

Shrub.
July.
A larger plant than the foregoing, with broader leaves, and the 
Jiowers are conspicuous for their size as well as brilliancy.
The 
more pure white, and starry down, of the backs of the leaves, 
the hoariness of the stipulas, and of every part of the calyx, in 
Mr. Don's original specimen, are remarkable ; and the obovate 
obtuse form of the 2 outer calyx-leaves, which are hoary 
all over, and less fringed than in C.
Helianthemum, should seem 
a good specific character.
Ehrhart's specimen is weak, and less 
downy, as if it had been drawn up by the neighbourhood of 
other plants.
His stipulas moreover are green and fringed.
The leaves on young lateral shoots are peculiarly rounded.
When cultivated together, the difference between these two 
plants is striking.
What such great practical observers as Sco- 
poli, G.
Don, and our most acute, justly lamented, Dickson 
have asserted, I would not hastily reject ; nor can \, with my 
worthy friend Prof.
Hooker, think C.
tomentosus " not even a 
well-marked variety." It merits at least some examination in 
its native places of growth.
In gardens it bears the name of 
C. canus ; but the real canus has no stipulas.

Annual.
June, July.
Root simple, slender.
He7b finely downy all over, particularly the 
stem and capsule, so that I am unable to separate the D.pu- 
bescens of DeCandoUe from our plant, though, being a native of 
Greece and other mild climates, it is more luxuriant, as will ap- 
pear by Fl. Gra'c.
t. 504 when published.
The stem in ours is 
1 8 inches or 2 feet high, erect, leafy, with alternate spreading 
branches.
Leaves sessile, in many deep divisions, which are 
three-cleft and subdivided, with narrow, linear, acute segments.
Stipulas none.
Clusters terminal, lax, of but fewjlowcrs, whose 
petals are, in front, of a most vivid and lasting blue ; the back 
of each flower, as well as the nectary, being pale purplish, or 
flesh-coloured.
These colours however vary much in gardens, 
where this species is called the Branching Larkspur, and attains 
the height of 3 or 4 feet.
Bract eas at the base, and in the mid- 
dle, of each partial stalk, simple or divided.
Germen and cap- 
sule solitary, with a short permanent style.
Seeds angular, black, 
very rough.

June, July.
Root tapering.
Stem erect, simple, leafy, clothed with minute 
close hairs, and terminating in a solitary, simple, upright cluster 
of large dark -blue flowers, without scent.
Leaves alternate, on 
short stalks, divided to the base into 5 lobes, cut into numerous, 
linear, acute, somewhat revolute segments ; nearly smooth on 
both sides ; paler beneath ; marked on the upper side with a 
furrow along the course of the mid-rib.
Our plant is certainly 
the original Napellus, from which Prof.
DeCandoUe has sepa- 
rated several formerly-supposed varieties, having broader leaves, 
but of which lie very candidly expresses his doubts, whether they 
are good species.
At any rate I would here retain the old well- 
known specific name, though Linnaeus, who made no distinc- 
tion between these plants, has in his herbarium for Napellus the 
A. neubergense of DeCandolle, which moreover is figured, under 
his inspection, in the Stockholm Transactions for 1/39, t.
2, 
as A.
Napellus, and given as such by Ehrhart in his PL Off".

A. paniculatum of DeCandolle, which is what Storck happened 
to make use of, and to publish, for Napellus, and which is Hal- 
ler's Ti. 1 198, belongs to A.

In deep fen ditches and pools.
Plentiful in the isle of Ely, and in the marshy parts of Lincoln-

and Yorkshire.
Perennial.
July.
A stoloniferous, smooth, floating herb, with numerous radical 
leaves, and a solitary central ^otrer-sm/Zc, no stem.
The parent 
plant sinks to the bottom after flowering, and sends out long 
simple runners, each terminating in a leaf-bud, or young plant, 
which first takes root in the mud, by several long fibres, and in 
the following summer rises to the surface of the water, blossoms, 
and then again subsides to ripen its seeds, and throw out fresh 
runners, each tuft of leaves flowering but once.
The leaves are 
a span long or more, acute, highly vascular, fringed with very 
sharp saw-like teeth.
Flowers white, large and handsome, the 
stalk firm, stout, two-edged, much shorter than the leaves.
The 
anthers are occasionally imperfect in one flower, the stigmas in 
another, whence some curious but superficial observers have 
POLYANDRIA-POLYGYNIA, Anemone.

thought the Jlowers dioecious ; but such casual imperfection in 
those parts is frequent in plants that increase much by root.
The Slratiotes fills our ditches in summer, with a close phalanx 
of sword-like leaves, wiience its name, from g-pocros, an army, 
in Dioscorides, whose description cannot be mistaken, though 
Dr. Sibthorp did not notice this plant in Greece, any more than 
the Sagittaria, which some commentators have mistaken for it.

Gerarde expressly 
informs us that he himself was " moved to name" this the 
Pasque-flower, or Easter-flovs^r, because of the time of its ap- 
pearance.
There is therefore no occasion to seek an explanation 
of this name in the reported use of the flowers, for colouring the 
Paschal eggs of the catholicks, or the Scotch ; especially as these 
flowers are said to yield a green, not a purple dye.

This has never been found in England ; for specimens sent by

a starved and paler autumnalis.

Root fibrous, accompanied with many fleshy, oblong, annual knobs.
Herb smooth, of a bright shining green, rather succulent.
Stems 
either erect or recumbent, from 3 to 1 inches long, branched, 
leafy.
Leaves alternate, stalked, heart-shaped, angular or wavy 
at the margin, sometimes spotted with black.
Footstalks longer 
than the leaves ; dilated, membranous and sheathing at the 
base.
Fl. terminal, solitary, on long stalks.
Cal. of 3, rarely

9, often 8 or 10, of a golden yellow, as if varnished ; turning 
white by the action of light.

Those who retain Ficaria as a genus, should observe that Hud- 
son's name verna, published in 1 762, is prior to ranunculoides, 
and in every respect more eligible ; the latter being a barbarous 
jumble of Latin and Greek, such as too often disgraces our sci- 
ence.
It ought to have been ranunculinus.

April, May.
Root fibrous.
Stem about a foot high, erect, branched, leafy, round, 
the upper part often slightly downy.
Leaves seldom quite 
smooth; often finely downy; radical ones on long stalks, round- 
ed or kidney-shaped, crenate, some of them 3-lobed, or ,5-lobed, 
cut ; those on the stem sessile, in deeper and narrower seg- 
ments ; uppermost in 3 or more linear, quite entire, lobes, 
Fl. terminal, stalked, solitaiy, of a bright golden yellow, of which 
the pale, hairy, never reflexed, cabjx often partakes.
Some-

the aspect of petals, which in that case are wanting.
Nect.

This species, having no acrimony, has been termed dulcis, or Sweet

Perennial.
June, July.
Root somewhat tuberous, with many long simple fibres.
Stem 
2 feet high, erect, round, hollow, leafy, clothed with close- 
pressed hairs, or bristles ; branched above, and many-flowered.
Radical leaves on long upright hairy footstalks, in 3 or 5 deep 
lobes, which are variously subdivided and cut, more or less 
hairy ; stem-leaves nearly sessile, with fewer and narrower seg- 
ments ; uppermost much smaller, in 3 linear entire lobes ; or 
sometimes simple and linear.
Fl. bright yellow, on round even 
stalks, covered with close hairs, and not furrowed.
Cal. hairy,

Nect.

Seeds lenti- 
cular, smooth, with a small, slightly curved, point.
The small variety, with scarcely more than a solitary /ower, found 
on the Highland mountains, and brought by Mr. D.
Turner from 
wet rocks near the summit of Snowdon, is not the montanus of 
Willdenow, but becomes, with one year's culture in a gar- 
den, precisely our common acris.
It has remained so with me 
above 20 years.
The double-flowered variety is common in 
gardens, and not inelegant.
The synonym of Gerarde, quoted 
in Fl. Br.
belongs to R.
polyanthemos, a foreign species, with 
furrowedjlower-stalks, and more finely divided leaves, of which 
the wooden cuts, in old books, are, as Prof.
DeCandolle well 
observes, hard to distinguish from those of the acris.

In corn-fields, not uncommon.
Annual.

Root fibrous.
Herb of a pale shining green, nearly, but not quite, 
smooth.
Stem erect, in a favourable soil much branched, round, 
leafy.
Leaves alternate, the upper ones partly opposite, all 
once or twice divided in a three-fold manner^ with linear-lanceo- 
late, bluntish, mostly entire, rather fleshy segments.
Fl. small,

Cat. spreading, narrow, hairy.
Pet. obovate.
Seeds large, each 
with an upright awl-shaped point, their flat sides densely armed 
with numerous, sharp, prominent prickles.
Very acrid and dangerous to cattle, though they are said to eat it 
greedily.
M. Brugnon, who has given a particular account of 
its qualities, relates that 3 ounces of the juice killed a dog in 
4 minutes.
Several sheep were killed by feeding on this herb 
near Turin, which first led to an investigation of the matter.
Cholic, with inflammation of the stomach, were the symptoms, 
which were best removed by pouring vinegar down the animals' 
throats.
Hence, like most vegetable poisons, this Crowfoot 
seems to act on the nerves, and yet black spots were found in 
the sheep's stomachs.

In ditches and ponds every where.
S in rivers.
Perennial.
May, June.
The natural state of this species is when it mantles the surface of 
still pools or ditches with its lobed floating leaves, and abun- 
dance of white^owers, yellow in the middle, the branched stems 
throwing out long fibrous roots from their lower joints, and the 
leaves which are under water being repeatedly divided, in a 
threefold manner, into narrow, linear, acute segments.
The 
flowers are solitary, on long stalks, opposite to the leaves.
Cal.
smooth, deciduous.
Pet. obovate, twice as long as the calyx, 
with a tubular nectary in the middle of the yellow claw.
Seeds 
numerous, in a round head, obovate, transversely wrinkled ; 
more or less hairy, or minutely bristly, especially in the varie- 
ties.
/3 has all the leaves cut as above mentioned, and im- 
mersed in the water j but any person who throws it out into a 
shallow puddle, early in the summer, will soon, I believe, see 
broad leaves produced, y, from whatever cause, bears smaller, 
neater, rounded, very finely cut leaves.
J, floating in a strong 
or rapid stream, has all its leaves dissected and lengthened out 
by the water, and can but rarely flower.
I agree with Prof.
Hooker that the hairiness of the seeds is no constant mark ; for 
after having long ago thought it such, I have been obliged to 
give up that point.
See Rees's Cyclopcedia.
1 cannot but won- 
der at those otherwise able botanists, who seeing these varieties 
produced under their eyes, with the evident cause of each con- 
tinually acting, can consider them as species.
R.fluviatilis of Dr. Bigelow in his Boston Flora, 139, is indeed a 
totally different species, of much larger dimensions, with all the 
leaves finely and copiously subdivided, bright yellow^owers, and 
minutely wrinkled seeds, terminating in compressed upright 
beaks, as long as themselves.

it, for the decoration of their doors and apartments, as well as 
their persons.

Those 
of the southern hemisphere have, as M.
DeCandolle re- 
marks, permanent petals, or, as he considers it, a per- 
manent calyx : in those of northern climates the same 
part is deciduous.
Two species, C.
asarifolia and lepto- 
petala, have numerous narrow petals, differing from the 
rest as Jlanunculus Ficaria does from other species of 
Ranunculus; but M.
DeCandolle is too judicious to se- 
parate them, on that account, from the rest.

Root thick, and somewhat tuberous, with many simple fibres.
Stem 
12 or 18 inches high, erect, round, hollow, leafy, branched, fur- 
rowed.
Leaves variously heart-shaped, crenate ; the lowermost 
on long, somewhat triangular, footstalks, largest, most rounded, 
and with blunter notches ; upper nearly sessile, alternate, more 
triangular, acutely crenate.
Stipulns membranous, withering.
Fl. several, from 3 to .5, large, bright yellow, on alternate soli-

Pet. 5, an inch long, roundish-oval.
The flower- 
buds pickled serve for Capers, which they resemble, except in 
having numerous germens.
A double variety is frequent in

/3 is in every part but half the size of the common sort ; the stems 
are more reclining, each bearing 1, 2, or SJlowers, whose petals 
are but half an inch long, yet 1 can find no decisive specific cha- 
racter.
Possibly this variety may render the following species 
somewhat doubtful ; but they require careful examination in a 
wild state.

Grammar 99.
A few genera, comprised in Jussieu's first 
section, are excluded from the present class and order of 
the artificial system, as having only 2 stamens, and are 
referred therefore to the second class, Diandria.
Of 
these the only British genera are Lycopus and Salvia.
See vol.
i. 33 — 35.
The following are the characters of the Verticillatce, a de- 
nomination needlessly changed for Lahiatce.
Flo'wers all complete, as well as perfect, having a calyx and 
corolla, with stamens and pistil, in every individual.
Calyx inferior, simple, of one leaf, erect, tubular, often tu- 
mid at the base, on the upper or lower side, permanent ; 
orifice more or less deeply divided into 5 unequal, often 
pointed, spreading segments.
Corolla of 1 petal, erect, tubular, and containing honey, at 
the base, without any particular apparatus ot a nectary ; 
limb almost invariably ringent, or lipped ; ujjper lip either 
upright, or vaulted, rarely very short, or deeply divided ; 
fower in 3 divisions, the middle one almost always broadest.
Stamejis 4 ; Jilaments linear, from the tube of the coj-olla, at 
64 DIDYNAMIA— GYMNOSPERMIA.

the upper side, the 2 intermediate ones being shortest, 
and all of them parallel, rarely longer than the corolla, 
their upper half usually incurved.
Anthers oblong, at- 
tached by the back, converging in pairs, generally shel- 
tered by the upper lip, but sometimes quite exposed.
Germeti superior, 4-lobed; si^le solitary, central, thread- 
shaped, situated between the stamens, and curved in the 
same direction, being of an intermediate length between 
the longer and shorter ones ; stigma usually cloven and 
divaricated, sometimes undivided, or slightly notched.
Seeds 4, lodged in the bottom of the calyx, which is their 
only covering, and serves instead of a seed-vessel.
Each 
seed has a double integument, a testa and a mcmbrana, 
both of them very thin, generally smooth.
See observa- 
tions on the Asperifolia;, vol.
i. 248.
All the plants of the Didynamia Gymnospermia are herba- 
ceous, or slightly shrubby, never arborescent.
Their 
stems are quadrangular, branched, and leafy.
Leaves op- 
posite, entire or serrated, in a few instances much di- 
vided.
Flowers stalked, axillary, either solitary, or in 
dense tufts constituting 'whorls ; their colour reddish, pur- 
plish, blue, white, or yellow.
Qualities aromatic, or bit- 
ter, in every instance harmless.
The powers are rarely 
so fragrant as the herbage, though sometimes exhaling 
a slight odour, peculiar to themselves.
Round pellucid 
spots, in the leaves or calyx more especially, are the seat 
of an aromatic essential oil.
The pubescence of the herb- 
age, in many species, exudes a similar, or more viscid, 
or a bitter secretion.
In growing parts, attacked by in- 
sects for the lodgment of their eggs, these secretions are 
changed to acid or astringent ones.

Scyons long and slender, leafy, wanting in the wooden cut of 
Gerarde and Dodonseus, which is copied after that of Matthio- 
lus.
Leaves obovate, with shallow serratures, veiny ; the lower 
ones tapering into footstalks ; upper se.ssile, diminished, slightly 
coloured, bearing several whorls, of blue and white, sometimes 
entirely white, scentless^owers.
Segments of the calyx hairy, 
as well as the outside of the corolla, the middle lobe of whose 
lower lip is cloven.
The roots are slightly astringent, but the herb has little taste or 
smell, and still less of any healing or vulnerary property.
The 
white variety abounds in the isle of Wight ; and a flesh-colour- 
ed one has sometimes been observed.
In dry mountainous si- 
tuations the plant acquires a considerable degree of hairiness.

This has no creeping scyons.
The leaves are scarcely more hairy

quite entire ; the uppermost of all only slightly tinged with a 
violet colour ; the radical leaves stalked and oblong, not much 
larger than the rest.

I suspect that it is 
often notched, or inversely heart-shaped, in which case the 
plant becomes A.

All the herb-

lodging a copious essential oil, which is pungently aro-

The species are extremely 
variable in general habit, and have long been the oppro- 
brium of British botanists, our country being peculiarly 
rich in Mints, as Dillenius long ago observed.

The situation and direction of the hairs of 
the calyx were first pointed out, by the writer of the pre- 
sent Flora, after a careful investigation of every known 
species and variety, living or dried, as affording, in dif- 
ficult cases, the only certain specific distinctions ; and 
these prove invariable, though even the inflorescence is, in 
some species, inconstant.

serrated, acute, veiny, varying from an ovate-lanceolate to an 
ovate, or almost orbicular, figure ; their upper surface hoary j 
under shaggy veith dense, soft, white hairs.
Spikes several, ter- 
minal, erect, generally acute, forming a sort of panicle, each 
composed of numerous, dense, crowded, bracteated whorls, of 
small, pale purple^ower*.
Bracteas linear-lanceolate, spread- 
ing, the outer pair largest.
Flower-stalks covered with short 
reflexed hairs ; calyx with erect ones.
All the varieties, especially a and S, sometimes acquire a sweet, 
very agreeable, scent ; but I have not met with any such in 
British specimens.
Haller's n.
228 is one of these fragrant va- 
rieties, various in the breadth of its leaves.
It is M.
gratissima 
of Wiggers, Roth, Hoffmann, and Willdenow.
The comparative 
length of the stamens, by which Linnaeus and others have at- 
tempted to distinguish Menthce, is but an uncertain criterion.
If the plant increases much by root, the starnens are shorter and 
less perfect, and the seeds do not ripen.

with a less agreeable scent, than in a, the true garden Spear 
Mint, or Mackarel Mint.
Spikes par.icled, elongated, acute } 
almost all the whorls a little distant from each other, with narrow 
or bristle-shaped bracteas, which are seldom quite smooth even 
in a, and in the varieties are more or less hairy, as well as 
broader.
Flower-stalks always, in every variety, perfectly 
smooth, round and polished.
Cal. narrow-bell-shaped, fur-

The warm camphor-like scent and flavour of this species, suc-

The variety y is less agreeable

England has always been known as the coun- 
try of the true M.
piperita.
What supplies its place in the north 
of Europe, is merely a variety of M.
hirsuta having a similar 
odour; and this is named piperita in the Linnaean herbarium.
Mr. Sole justly criticises the figure in Ray's Synopsis, as having 
the leaves of the true piperita with the iri/lorescence of hirsuta ; 
or rather perhaps of piperita (3.

Whole herb smooth in every part, often red or purple, with a 
powerful, very fragrant scent, like the Bergamot Orange, or 
the herbage of Monarda didyma, on which account it is often 
preserved in gardens.
The stems, about 2 feet high, are bushy, 
copiously branched, and spreading.
Leaves broadly heart- 
shaped, an inch, or inch and half long, serrated, with many 
parallel transverse veins.
Fl. in round, blunt, terminal heads,

The name of Ehrhart, which I had not observed when writing the

The roots creep to a great extent.
Herb very variable, more or less 
hairy ; very seldom almost smooth, except the Jlower-stalks and 
calyx ; but a smooth plant removed to a garden became as hairy 
as any of the varieties, in the following year.
The scent also 
varies from a fetid, marshy, though pungently aromatic, odour, 
which is usual in the whole species, to the camphorated flavour 
of true Pepper Mint, n.
4, for which our variety y serves in the 
north of Europe.
Some varieties acquire a sweet scent, like 
. Basil, but that is transient.
I have specimens gathered in 1 743, 
which still retain the fine odour of Frankincense Thyme.
Stems 
generally erect, and mostly branched, clothed with rather short 
hairs, curved downwards.

hairy, from an inch to 1^ inch long, rarely more or less, except

a dark purplish hue.
Fl. of a light blueish purple, numerous 
and crowded ; in a^ /S and y capitate, with one or more pair of 
stalked axillary whorls below the head ; in S the head becomes a 
spike, with several whorls , more or less remote ; in s the whole 
spike is whorled, and somewhat leafy ; in the rest all the Jlowers 
are whorled and axillary.
Bracteas lanceolate, hairy.
Flower- 
stalks densely covered, for the most part, but especially at the 
summit, with recurved, sometimes close-pressed, white hairs.
Cal. tubular, furrowed, mostly purplish, besprinkled with resi- 
nous dots, and clothed with hairs, various in length, all con- 
stantly curved in a contrary direction from those of the stalks.
Cor. hairy externally.
Stam.

The lower 
whorls are usually stalked.
Botanists have been very unwilling to believe the curious change 
of a capitate Mint to a whorled one ; but this alteration may 
often be traced in the same ditch.
Some copy me for this fact, 
without adverting to its author or seeming conscious of its hav- 
ing ever been disputed.
I have received dried as well as living 
specimens, from the late Mr. Sole, of all his varieties, of this 
and other species, and have cultivated them in a dry garden, as 
well as in a very wet one.
I have observed all the difficult 
ones, year after year, in their wild situations, and have no doubt 
that all these varieties of M.
hirsuta especially, constitute but 
one species.
Occasional examinations, during the course of 25 
years, have not only confirmed this opinion, but have also ascer- 
tained the truth of the essential characters derived from the pu- 
bescence of the calyx and Jlower-stalks, as being decisive with- 
out any exception.
I regret that my friend Mr. Sole took great 
offence at my not following all his names and errors ; but I 
hope I have never corrected them unhandsomely, nor do I mean 
to undervalue his book, which is a valuable record of the several 
varieties of this difficult genus, though no guide at all as to the 
limits or names of the species.
Professor Hooker, in the most 
flattering terms, confirms my account of this Mint ; but the 
hairs on the flower-stalks, in his otherwise excellent plate, are 
not enough deflexed.

recurved.
Its scent is that of most of this genus, especially M.
viridis; but I have a Shropshire specimen from the Rev. E.
Williams, smelling like M.
arvensis hereafter described.
The 
stem is from 4 to 6 feet high^ erect, though more or less wavy, 
supporting itself on bushes, and never quite straight; with few 
and short branches ; leafy, variously tinged with deep red, mostly 
smooth and shining.
Leaves stalked, broadly ovate, strongly 
serrated, of a deep shining green ; paler beneath, copiously be- 
sprinkled with resinous dots ; the upper ones small and short, 
occasionally crisped ; all either quite smooth, or bearing a few 
minute hairs on the ribs and veins, some such being scattered 
over the upper surface.
Whorls numerous, stalked, of many 
large reddish^^owers.
Bracteas linear, fringed, at least towards 
the point; innermost bristle-sliaped.
Flower-stalks round, of a 
shining red or purple, invariably smooth, as is also the lower 
part of the tubular calyx, though its teeth are always hairy, or 
fringed, and the upper part of the tube is occasionally hairy, its 
whole surface bearing resinous dots.
Cor. large, quiie smooth, 
partly in like manner dotted.
Stayn.
various in length on the 
same specimen.
Our earlier British botanists confounded this with the Linnaean M.
sativa, or verticillata, see M.
hirsuta g", p.
79, under the appel- 
lation of C.
Bauhin's M.
crispa verticillata,hut on attentive con- 
sideration of his synonyms, I think the latter writer had not our 
rubra in contemplation.
This is however the plant of Ray, and 
probably of J.
Bauhin.
It is by far the tallest and handsomest of 
our Mints, and cannot be confounded with any other.

The whole herb is of a lighter green than the last, all over more or 
less minutely hairy, and, when planted in a dry situation, 
pleasantly scented ; in wet ground it has the ordinary smell of 
Mint.
Stem erect, bushy, with numerous spreading branches, 
leafy, 12 or 18 inches, in /3 near 3 feet, high; when not quite 
smooth, the hairs are recurved, as usual.
Leaves stalked, uni- 
formly ovate, not much pointed, serrated, dotted, scarcely paler 
beneath ; the upper surface besprinkled with fine small hairs ; 
rib and veins of the under side beset with rather stronger ones ; 
in /3 the leaves are longer and more elliptical ; in y prettily va- 
riegated with yellow, and more fragrant.
Whorls nearly sessile, 
except occasionally from cultivation in y.
Bfacteas lanceolate, 
hairy, varying in size.
Flower-stalks round, purplish, for the 
most part very smooth ; but in y, especially when cultivated in

On wet commons, and about the margins of small brooks.
Perennial.
September.
Much smaller than any of the foregoing species, with a strong, 
acrid, very peculiar smell, resembling Thymus Nepeta.
The 
stems are somewhat procumbent, or quite prostrate, downy, 
bluntly quadrangular, throwing out radicles here and there.
Leaves scarcely half an inch long, often much less, stalked, de- 
fle.xed, ovate, obtuse, with a few shallow unequal serratures.

full of pellucid dots, and a little hairy chiefly beneath.
Whorls 
sessile, numerous, many-flowered, large in proportion to the 
foliage.
Bracteas none.
Flower-stalks purplish, clothed entirely 
with very short, dense, hoary pubescence.
Cal. tubular, slender, 
nearly cylindrical, besprinkled with resinous dots, strongly rib- 
bed and furrowed, covered with very short, dense, prominent 
hairs ; the teeth unequal, sharp-pointed, fringed ; mouth closed 
with converging white hairs, as in Thymus.
Cor. exernally hairy, 
light purple, occasionally white, exactly answering to the cha- 
racter of Mentha, as well as the stamens.
Penny-royal is a popular remedy for many obstructions, as well as 
for debility of the internal organs, being powerfully stimulant 
and tonic, but less grateful than Pepper Mint.

Habit like the preceding, from which however this species is truly 
distinct.
The leaves are marked, either with a white central 
line, or with scattered white spots.
Fl. crimson ; the lip beau- 
tifully speckled ; their lateral teeth slender.
Cal. very unlike 
that of L.
album ; the tube more slender and curved, as long as 
the teeth, which are also recurved and narrow, mostly purplish.
Authors have greatly confounded the synonyms of this Lamium.
Haller took it for the Icevigatum, and Pallas, more iinaccount- 
ably, for the purpureum, of Linnaeus.
Rivinus did not distin- 
guish it, as a species, from album.
At^ to blunders in compiling, 
quoting and copying, they are peculiarly numerous throughout 
its whole history.
The editor of J.
Bauhin's Hist., v.
3. 322, has 
actually given for this plant an old figure of the Almond, from 
Dorstenius, p.
24.
Ours is the plant of Haller and Rivinus, the 
leaves being only slightly dotted.
It scarcely seems specifically 
distinct from that with a white line.

August.
Root creeping extensively, fleshy, throwing out in autumn a num-

difficult of extirpation.
This therefore should be attempted 
in summer, before these knobs are produced, when the flowers 
are just appearing.
The herbage is fetid, greyish and silky.
Stems very erect, rough with defle.xed bristles, bearing many 
pairs of long, narrow, serrated, a'most sessile leaves, somewhat

Leaves 
stalked, an inch or more in length, ovate, or slightly heart-

5 very short, abrupt, veiny, marginal lobes or teeth, each tipped 
with a small spreading bristly point.
Cor. dull purple, in /3

hairs, more or less converging into a pointed tuft ; lower 3-

Our plant is the original B.
nigra of Linnaeus, and of most authors; 
though this great botanist, in the 2d edition of his Sp. PL, as 
well as in the Flora Suecica, has confounded with it another 
.species, indigenous likewise to Sweden, but distinguished by the 
elongated, lanceolate, tapering shape of its calyx- teeth, and the 
more unequal serratures of its leaves.
This latter is given as 
_,, B.

burn, are now little regarded.
Yet hence originated its old ap-

Invohicrum of numerous taper leaves, under the flowers, 
nearly equal to the calyx in length, permanent.
Cal. tu- 
bular, many-ribbed, slightly curved, two-lipped ; upper 
lip broadest, ascending, in 3 deep acute equal segments; 
lower longest, incurved, in 2 deep slender segments ; 
throat closed with converging hairs.
Cor, ringent ; tube 
cylindrical, rather short ; throat longer and wider ; up- 
per lip erect, concave, obtuse, slightly cloven ; lower in 
3 deep segments, the middle one very broad, notched.
Filam.
all directed to the upper lip, cylindrical, converg-

Seeds 4, ovate, in the bottom of 
the closed tumid calyx.
Slightly aromatic herbs, with undivided leaves, and com- 
pound, stalked, hairy, axillary and terminal whorls of 
light-purplish j^ow^r^.
This genus is distinguished from Thymus merely by the 
concavity of the upper lip of the corolla, which is* very 
slight, and by the presence of an involucrum, which is 
not really a part of the fructification.
As the species are 
few, they might perhaps be referred to Thymus.

Leaver deflexed, bright green, entire or 
slightly serrated, minutely fringed, besprinkled with resinous 
dots.
Fl. light purple, in dense, convex tufts, with involucral 
leaves of a darker purple, rather longer than the calyx, which 
last is tubular, smooth, covered with resinous dots, and closed 
at the mouth with dense, prominent, very conspicuous, white 
hairs ; the margin in 5 erect, broadish, nearly equal, coloured 
teeth.
The ca/(/i' differs remarkably in different species of this genus, con- 
sisting in some of an undivided unilateral leaf, without teeth j 
while in others it is, more or less equally, five-toothed, or two-

The iiwolucrum is uniform and constant in all.

In meadows and pastures common.
Perennial.
July, August.
Hoot somewhat creeping.
Stems a span high, erect or ascending, 
leafy, square, downy at the opposite sides with upright hairs ; 
branched chiefly in the lower part.
Leaves stalked, ovate or 
oblong, acute or bluntish, crenate, or wavy, or, in variety /3, 
quite entire ; paler beneath, with downy ribs.
Fl. numerous, 
deep purplish blue, in dense, solitary, erect, cylindrical, whorled 
spikes ; each whorl of 6 flowers, subtended by a pair of broad, 
obtuse, ribbed, partly coloured, bracteas, shorter than the calyx.
The barren branch of the 2 upper stamens is sometimes shorten- 
ed and blunted.
This herb is, in Germany, reckoned salutary for ulcerations of the 
throat and mouth, called in the language of that country die 
Breune, whence, says Ray, came the name of Brunella.
Linnseus 
softened that barbarous appellation into Prunella, without ren- 
dering it more classical.
DIDYNAMIA ANGIOSPERMIA.
This order of the artificial system of Linnaeus consists, except 
Digitalis, of his own natural order o^ Personatce, 40, and 
comprehends two of Jussieu's, Pediculares, 35, and Sc7'0- 
phularice, 40.
To the former belong, more or less exactly, 
all the British genera of our first section, characterized 
by a four-cleft calyx ; as well as Pedicularis, whose calyx 
is five-cleft, and Orohanche, which has a two-lipped, or 
two-leaved, calyx.
To the Scrophularice belong all our 
genera with a five"-cleft calyx, except Pediadaris and Liii- 
ncea, the latter being properly referred to Jussieu's Ca- 
prifolia, 58, the first section of.
which only really consti- 
tutes the order so named.
The Pediculares and true Scro- 
phularice have been united by Mr. Brown, Prodr.
N. 
Holl.
V. 1.
433, under the appellation of Scrophularina:.
Two new orders have nevertheless been recently founded, 
out of these, by M.
Richard, the Melampyracecc and 
Orohancliece.
I presume to think them superfluous, and 
shall offer my reasons under the genera whose names 
they bear.
Mr. Brown thus defines his Scrophularinee.
Calyx divided, permanent.
116 DIDYNAMIA— ANGIOSPERMIA.
Bartsia.
Corolla of 1 petal, inferior, mostly irregular, segments im- 
bricated in the bud, deciduous.
Stamens generally 4, 2 longer and 2 shorter, rarely equal : 
sometimes but 2.
Germen with many seeds, in 2 cells ; style 1 ; stigma 2- 
lobed ; rarely undivided.
Capsule, (very rarely a Berry,) of 2 cells, with 2 or 4 valves, 
which are either undivided or cloven ; the partition either 
double, originating from the inflexed margins of the 
valves ; or simple, either parallel to the valves and undi- 
vided, or contrary to them and separable into 2 parts.
Receptacles central, attached to the partition, sometimes 
separating finally from it.
iSeer/5 numerous, albuminous; the £?«irj/o internal, straight; 
Radicle directed towards the scar.
Herbs, sometimes sJinibs, with for the most part opposite 
leaves.
Iiiflorescence various.
Stipulas none.
Mr. Brown justly reprehends Jussieu for making the di- 
stinction of a parallel or transverse partition in the fruit 
absolute, thus splitting one natural order into two.
It is 
like making a character "give a genus, not a genus a 
character," one of the great causes of so many unnatural 
genei-a in Zoology as well as Botany.
An American 
writer has remarked also that " the recent custom among 
Geologists, of cutting up and subdividing, seems to be 
upon the point of ruining the simplicity of the Wernerian 
arrangement, as the same custom among Botanists has 
already nearly ruined the Linnaean system of vegetables." 
Van Rensselaer'' s Suri>ey of the Erie Canal, ]}.
17.
I hope 
this last remark is not correctly true, and that such in- 
judicious attempts will be resisted by those who possess 
the talent of scientific combination ; which, in Natural 
History, is full as necessary as that of observation and 
discrimination, and much less common.

It occupies the loftiest alps of Switzerland 
and Savoy.
Linnaeus having, very early, dedicated this genus to his highly de- 
serving but unfortunate friend Bartsch ; who died at Surinam, 
in consequence of the neglect, if not persecution, of his slave- 
trading countrymen the Dutch ; could not adopt the name given 
by Halier, but established another very handsome Stcehelina on 
the recommendation of the latter.

the county of Durham, in corn-fields " approaching to peat j" 
sometimes nearly obliterating crops of corn.
Mr. James Back- 
house.
Annual.
July, 2 or 3 weeks later than the former.
Dr. Richardson distinguished this species, from our common R.
Crista galli, by its greater size, copious branches, narrower 
leaves, and smaller^owers with a pui-ple (upper) lip.
Ehrhart 
has characterized it by the incurved tube of the corolla, which in 
the former is straight.
Mr. Backhouse, to whom I am obliged 
for numerous wild specimens, says it may be known at first 
sight by its greater size, being 2 feet high, much branched, and 
bushy ; its much denser spikes ; and its yellowish bracteas, each 
of which terminates in an elongated green point.
The seg- 
ments of the upper lip of the corolla are wedge-shaped, and 
purple.
Germen narrower, and more tumid, than in R.
Crista 
galli.
Style prominent.
Nectary heart-shaped, more spread- 
ing, and greenish.
The seeds are thick at the edge, and not 
quite destitute of a membranous margin, but this is much nar- 
rower than in the former.
Prof.
Afzelius long ago assured 
me that R.
major of Ehrhart differed in its seeds from our com- 
mon Crista galli.
The Alectorolophus n.
314, of Haller, which 
is less branched, with broader leaves, and a hairy calyx, appears 
very distinct from our R.
major, and more allied to R.
Crista 
gain.
I have R.
major gathered by Mr. Davall, on some of the 
loftiest of the mountains of Switzerland.

On heaths, and in mountainous pastures, abundantly.
Annual.
July — September.
An elegant little plant, varying in height from one inch to 4 or 5, 
with a square, downy, leafy stem, either simple or branched.
Leaves ^ or i an inch long, almost entirely opposite, ovate or 
heart-shaped, downy, strongly ribbed and furrowed, with sharp 
tooth-like serratures.
Fl. axillary, solitary, very abundant, in- 
odorous, but remarkable for their brilliant variegated aspect, on 
which account, it seems, the plant became celebrated as good 
for weak eyes.
The corolla varies much in size as well as co- 
lour, being commonly white, with deep purple streaks, and a 
yellowish palate ; the anthers violet.
On the mountains of 
Scotland there is a more slender variety, with smaller but more 
richly tinted blossoms ; on the Alps a dwarf, large-flowered, 
more purple variety is common.
The seeds are few, somewhat 
angular, thin at the edges, strongly striated, or furrowed, at the 
sides.

Branched, spreading, annual, nearly smooth herbs, 12 or 18 
inches high, with bluntly quadrangular stems ; opposite, 
entire leaves ; and handsome bracteated spikes of yellow

ed, and variously coloured.
The seeds are, without doubt, 
naturally 2 in each cell, and resemble grains of wheat.
All the species turn black in drying.
This genus and its nearest allies are admirably distinguish- 
ed by their seeds, and to make a naturalorder of ilf^/a?w- 
pyracece on account of any peculiarity in ihe fruit or seed, 
which is only indicative of a generic distinction, appears 
to me not judicious.

This is one of our most beautiful wild plants.
It will grow from 
fresh seed in a dry garden, and is well worthy of cultivation.
The late Mr. Watts ob'<erved, that whenever the field at Sporle 
was cropped with wheat, but not otherwise, this Melampyrum 
might be found in abundance.
At Costesy it is more constant, 
not only in the fields, but, as Dr. Hooker remarks, "on the 
dry banks which border them." M.

The real root is, I

the subject.
The Marquis of Stafford found one regular salver-shaped Jlower, 
with 6 segments, and as many stamens, 4 of them long, and 2 
short, on a wild specimen, near his castle of Dunrobin in Su- 
therland, North Britain, in 1808.

The capsule of 
those whose nectary is a pouch only, opens with 3 pores 
instead of 2, on which Mr. Brown founds a generic dis- 
tinction for the original Antirrhinum of Tournefort.
But the opening of the capsule in the Linaria of these

authors is so variously valvular, or so irregularly jagged, 
as to show that part to be indeterminate, or unfit to give 
a character, in this genus ; the length of the spurs, be- • 
ing, moreover, but comparative.
I therefore concur with 
those who do not separate Linaria, there being no dis- 
tinction of habit to depend upon, and the name, formed 
out of Linum^ being inadmissible.

Dillenius, after Rivinus, very rightly ob- 
serves that the capsule opens by an oblique deciduous segment 
over each cell, by which they characterize their genus Elatine; 
but which is only one of those slight differences, that confirm a 
too much neglected maxim of Linnseus, " there are few genera 
in which some part or other of the fructification is not subject to 
aberration."' 
I have specimens, found by the late Sir John CuUum, having some 
regu\cir flowers with 5 spurs, and others partly so, with only 2.
Sometimes, Hudson says, there are 3 or 4.

species twice over.
Linnaeus was led into the same error by 
him and Dillenius ; and the latter, by saying he had gathered

A. arvense, a very different plant, " wild," though he does not

Root creeping, somewhat woody.
Herh smooth, bright green, 
scarcely at all glaucous.
Stems 2 feet high, densely clothed, 
vi^ith irregularly set, narrow, acute leaves, and terminating in a 
close upright spike of rich yellow, inodorous, bracteated^oujers; 
the palate downy and orange-coloured ; the spur of each as long

with 4 or 5 lanceolate valves.
T curious variety /3, vvith a five-cleft, regular, five-spurred co- 
rolla, and five equal stamens, made a great noise in Sweden, 
when first discovered, and narrowly escaped being exalted, by 
Linnaeus, into a new genus.
It has however been found on the 
same plant with^owers that are naturally formed, see Engl.

variety.

j3, found by Bobart at Cumner, near Oxford, should seem to be a

S. nodosa, having been taken for the Galeopsis of Dioscorides, 
which is really S.
peregrina, and though celebrated for its use in 
scrofulous disorders, has no tuberous root, it may not be correct 
to suppose this sort of root first recommended our plant to me- 
dical use, or was the origin of the generic name.
If however 
such were the case, it would not be without example in the his- 
tory of medicine.

Root of numerous long and slender fibres.
Stem upright, wand- 
like, leafy, mostly simple, roundish, with several sliglit angles, 
downy, 3' or 4 feet high.
Leaves alternate, ovate- or elliptic-ob- 
long, crenate, downy, rugged and veiny, of a dull green ; taper- 
ing at the base into winged /oo/»/aZA:s,- radical ones largest.
Cluster terminal, erect, simple, of numerous, sometimes 60, 
large, pendulous, scentless, crmson Jlowers ; elegantly marked 
with eye-like spots, as well as hairy, within.
A variety with pure white^oz/;ers, dotted in like manner, but with 
shades of cream-colour or pearl, is kept in gardens, and remains 
tolerably constant from seed, the only means of propagation in 
this instance.
The English name appears to have been derived from Digitalis 
Fuchsii; for that writer is the acknowledged author of the Latin 
one, alluding to the fingers of a glove, which the flowers re- 
semble.
Yet Fo^ PJ'-S'<>F''j as I am told, occurs in Lye's Saxon 
Dictionary, as the appellation of our plant ; which indeed is so 
conspicuous and handsome, that we can hardly suppose our an- 
cestors left it nameless.
The Rev. Hugh Davies records several 
Welch names for the Foxglove, and mentions having seen it 
perfectly white by the road side at Penmynydd, and elsewhere.

Stipulas none.
Flowering' branches axillary, erect, 
about a finger's length, simple, except at the summit, where 
they are cloven, bearing two elegant, pendulous, flesh-coloured 
flowers, said to be very fragrant at night, with the scent of Mea- 
dow-sweet.
A pair of very small leaves stand at the origin of 
the T^a.xt\a\ flower-stalks, and there is often a larger pair or two 
at the lower part of each common stalk, or branch.
Corolla va- 
riegated internally with rose-colour and yellow.
Linnaeus describes 2, or rarely all 3, of the cells of i\\% fruit, as per- 
fecting their seed.
Wahlenberg asserts that one only comes to 
maturity.
Such is the " little northern plant, long overlooked, depressed, 
abject, flowering early," which Linnaeus selected to transmit his 
own name to posterity.
Few could have been better chosen ; 
and the progress of practical botany in Britain seems to be 
marked by the more frequent discovery of the Linncea.

Roots fibrous, certainly perennial, propagating themselves widely, 
for many years, among short wet grass, in the garden of the late 
Mr. Vere at Kensington Gore.
Stems prostrate, creeping ex- 
tensively, branched, entangled, leafy, slender and delicate, mi- 
nutely hairy like the rest of the herbage.
Leaves stalked, hori- 
zontal, orbicular-kidney-shaped, bluntly crenate, rather succu- 
lent, veiny, light green j paler beneath.
Fl. on short, axillary, 
simple stalks, whitish ; their 3 upper segments more or less 
tinged with pale red.
This genus, named by Linnaus in honour of Dr. Humphrey Sib- 
thorp, the successor of Dillenius in the Botanical chair at Ox- 
ford, was most richly deserved by his son, the late Professor, au- 
thor of the Flora Oxoniensis, and the collector of abundant ma- 
terials for the Flora Grceca, which he never lived to describe.
Of the latter splendid work 4 volumes in folio, each containing 
100 coloured plates, have already appeared, and the rest fire in

the latter finally consists of but one cell ; which is the 
case in Verbascum, and more or less with many other 
seed-vessels similarly constructed.
No doubt can remain 
as to the natural order of Limosella ; nor do I perceive 
the propriety of considering it as belonging to the Precipe 
of Linnaeus, the Lysimachice of Jussieu, though those 
great authorities are against me, and some later ones have 
traced an affinity to that tribe in the seed-vessel, which 
is surely altogether that of the Scrophularin<^ of my learn- 
ed friend Mr. Brown, who appears to have taken the most 
correct view of the subject.
This genus consists of a very few herbaceous, creeping, 
marsh plants, with simple, entire, stalked, linear or spa- 
tulate, aggregate leaves, and small, solitary, axillary, pale 
Jlowers, on simple naked stalks.

In bushy places on a barren gravelly soil, growing on the roots of 
Broom or Furze.
Perennial.
June, July.
Root of a few fibres.
Stem about a foot high, erect, dusky, un- 
branched, angular, hollow, fleshy, clothed, like every other part, 
with short, rough, glandular pubescence, and beset with scattered, 
lanceolate, upright scales, in the place of leaves ; the base tu- 
mid, ovate, clothed with smaller, more abundant scales.
Spike 
terminal, simple, rather dense, of from 15 to about 20 flowers, 
of a dull purplish brown, without any scent, and after awhile 
turning entirely brown, dry and membranous.
Bracteas soli- 
tary under each flower, lanceolate, acute, rusty and downy.
Calyx-leaves deeply cloven.
Upper lip of the corolla large, 
sometimes slightly cloven, often entire and rather pointed j lower 
in 3 acute, nearly equal, wavy, sometimes crenate lobes.
Filam.
dilated and channelled, as well as perfectly smooth, in their 
lower half ; glandular and downy at the summit.

Taller, and of a more yellowish hue than the former, with^o!<;er5 
of a lighter purple, more wavy in their margins ; their upper lip 
lobed.
They are commonly three times more numerous in the 
spike than in that species, and of a smaller size.
But their clear- 
est and most essential dift'erence, first remarked by Dr. Sutton, 
consists in the stamens being downy in their lower half, within- 
side, and smooth at the top ; while the germen and style are all 
over perfectly smooth.
The stamens proceed from a higher part 
of the tube than in 0.

Root of numerous rather woody fibres, creeping along the unequal

Dr. Hooker 
observes that this species is entirely confined to basaltic rocks, 
covered with a very thin coat of earth.
The whole plant is of a 
rusty purplish red, the bracteas rather browner.

In the south of Europe the Jlowers are more highly coloured than

The withering, not deciduous, corolla in this genus and Lathrcea, 
p. 1 26, seems scarcely sufficient, as a technical character, to 
establish a separate natural order, nor will analogy permit us 
to take into account, for this purpose, their parasitical mode 
of growth.

This whole class, except the exotic genus Cleome, which 
has been forced into it, constitutes an entirely natural 
order, the Cniciferce of recent authors ; which is indeed 
so natural and distinct, that we can hardly trace the least 
affinity between it and any other tribe.
The artificial sy- 
stem leaves it undisturbed ; not requiring the separation of 
any genus from the rest, nor properly introducing any that 
tloes not belong to them ; for whatever may become of 
Cleome, it ought not to encumber this class, to which it 
has no natural affinity, nor has it even the artificial cha- 
racter, except in a very few species.

Flowers all complete and pei-fect, having a calyx and corolla, 
with stamens and pistil, in every individual.
Calyx inferior, of 4 ovate-oblong, concave, obtuse, usually 
converging leaves, opposite in pairs; prominent at the 
base ; very sleek within ; deciduous.
Corolla what is termed cruciform, Introd.f. 156, 157, con- 
sisting of 4 petals, alternate with the calyx, almost inva- 
riably regular and equal; their claims erect, tapering 
154 
downwards, rather longer than the calyx ; border of each 
spreading almost hoi'izontally, dilated outward, obtuse, 
often oblique.
'Nectary of 2 or 4, opposite, mostly dark-green, glands, at 
the base of the stamens, especially within the 2 shortest, 
which therefore are curved outwards.
Stameyis 6 ; JilamenU awl-shaped, erect, shorter than the 
corolla, in some few instances furnished with a lateral 
tooth, or an interior scale ; 2 shortest opposite, solitary ; 
4 longest in opposite pairs.
Anthers mostly erect, oblong.
Germen superior.
Style short, or wanting.
Stigma obtuse, 
various in structure, often much changed after impreg- 
nation, permanent.
Pod roundish or oblong, of 2 valves, (rarely jointed and not 
bursting,) mostly of 2 cells, with a parallel partition, pro- 
jecting more or less at the summit, the valves separating 
at their base.
Seeds roundish, or flattened, on slender stalks, from both 
sides of the receptacle, which borders the partition.
Al- 
bumen none.
Cotyledons 2, either flat or folded, or spi- 
ral ; either incumbent, lying upon the embryo laterally, 
or accumbent, their edges at one side meeting the embryo 
longitudinally.
These last characters, first noticed by Gsertner, and very 
easy of detection as soon as the skin of the seed is re- 
moved, there being no separate albumen, have been found 
by Mr. Brown to afford the most natural, and indeed 
absolute, primary characters of these plants.
They serve 
to divide the whole into great natural sections, liable, as 
far as I can find, to no exception, the genera under each 
section being easily characterized, and proving much more 
natural, in habit and fructification, than those formed by 
Liimaeus, on the nectariferous glands, or other circum- 
stances.
The crucifercE are for the most part europasan, generally 
herbaceous, or, if shrubby, of humble growth.
Pid)escence 
either simple, woolly, starry, or wanting.
Stem round.
Leaves almost always alternate, simple; undivided, or 
deeply divided, jagged and toothed ; in some few cases 
compound.
Fl. in clusters, or corymbs, almost invariably 
destitute of bracteas, mostly white or yellow, sometimes 
red, seldom blue, or brownish ; often fragrant, especially 
at night.
About 900 species are enumerated by DeCan- 
doUe, but their number might perhaps be greatly re-

Prof.
DeCandoUe follows Mr. Brown's principles, but re- 
fines still more in the generic distinctions, and abolishes 
the Linnaean orders, though he acknowledges them to be 
commodious.
I retain these orders, thinking them liable 
to as few difficulties or ambiguities as almost any syste- 
matical contrivance whatevei*.
They are but two.
1. SILICULOSA.
Those whose seed-vessel is a short, 
roundish pod, denominated a pouch.
In these the seeds 
are sometimes very few,.
or even solitary; the plants are 
of more humble stature, though most inclined to be 
shrubby.
2. SILIQUOSA.
Pod much elongated, linear or cylin- 
drical, with numerous seeds; rarely jointed.

Their partition is er-

Bot. as " contrary to

the seed-vessel.
Dr. Hooker confirms our account of the flowers being always se- 
veral feet under water, where he observed them to be constantly 
expanded, so that the impregnation actually takes place in that 
element.
The pollen has not been examined.
By the excellent 
plate of this author, so great in botanical dissections, it appears 
that the radicle is not closely applied to the cotyledons, but they 
together form a curve, whose two extremities are distant from 
each other.
This I presume is expressed by cotyledones bicrures 
in Mr. Brown's generic definition.

Root slender, somewhat creeping, subdivided at the crown, bearing 
several tufts of copious, spreading, lanceolate, bluntish, flat, 
deep-green leaves ; tapering at the base ; a little wavy, or slightly 
notched, at the margin, fringed with constantly simple bristly 
hairs, such as are scattered, more or less sparingly, over both 
surfaces, where a few forked, not stellated, ones are occasionally 
intermixed.
Stalk solitary, slightly curved or wavy, 2 or 3 inches 
high, round, simply hairy, either quite leafless, or bearing, near 
the bottom, and sometimes under the lowermost flower, a soli- 
tary leaf, like the radical ones, though smaller, and by no means 
dilated, ovate, or strongly serrated.
Fl. small, white, densely 
corymbose.
Cal. somewhat hairy.
Pet. obovate, with a shallow 
notch, erect, twice as long as the calyx.
Pouches in a long, un- 
equal, or inteiTupted, upright cluster, with hairy partial stalks, 
about half their own length; their form elliptic-oblong rather than 
160 TETRADYNAMIA— SILICULOSA.
Diaba.
lanceolate, compressed but not flat, tipped with the very short 
thick style and capitate stigma ; their valves usually rough with 
minute, forked, spreading, rigid, white hairs ; but they are some- 
times quite smooth and naked, as in one of the Linnsean, and 
some of our Scottish specimens.
After a careful re-examination, I cannot but confirm the descrip- 
tions and synonyms of FL Br. and Engl.
Bot. The figure in the 
latter work is correct, if not luxuriant.
No wonder Dr. Wahlen- 
berg could not find in it the characters of his D.
hirta, that be- 
ing, as I presume, a different species, characterized by one, two, 
or three ovate, strongly toothed or serrated leaves on its stalk, 
or stem.
I have such from Lapland, gathered by Dr. Swartz.
The pouches and stalks are, as in the real D.
hirta, either mi- 
nutely hairy or smooth.
I must leave Dr. Hooker's hirta for 
future examination, as he refers to Jacquin's hirta, FL Austr.
t. 432, a totally different species, which is Haller's n.
497, well 
known in Switzerland, but not in Britain.
Bauhin's Bursa pas- 
toris alpina hirsuia, Prodr.
51./, agrees in the stem-leaves with 
Swartz's and Wahlenberg's plant, but the description of its soft 
and hoary radical foliage answers better to Jacquin's.

when cultivated, simple or somewhat branched, copiously leafy, 
its starry pubescence accompanied by, or sometimes in the lower

Radical leaves elliptic- 
lanceolate, forming in the first season a dense rose-like tuft ; 
those of the stem, the following year, very numerous, scattered, 
sessile, ovate, ribbed, variously toothed or cut, seldom, except 
in starved plants, quite entire.

Pet. inversely heart-shaped, twice the length of the calyx, with

Partial ^o?/;er-sto/A:s very hairy, scarcely half the 
length of the pouch, which is about half an inch long, elliptic- 
lanceolate, or oblong, more or less oblique, uneven, or twisted 
half round, flat not tumid, the edges thick, the summit crowned 
with the extremely short thick style, and depressed capitate 
stigma.
The surface of the pouch in British specimens 1 find 
to be always smooth.
Ehrhart's specimens of his D.
incana, or 
Holarges, Phytoph.
75, are not in fruit, but one of the germens 
carefully examined, proved only slightly and partially hairy, and 
could not possibly have produced a hoary pouch.
Yet this sy- 
nonym is applied by Ehrhart to his own D.
confusa, whose pouch 
should be downy, while DeCandoUe refers it, by my specimens, 
to his D.
contorta, my incana.
From all that I have seen, as 
well as from the analogy of the preceding species, I am satisfied 
that the smoothness or roughness of the fruit affords but a trivial 
distinction, and DeCandoUe seems of the same opinion.
The 
figure in Engl.
Bot. taken from a wild seedling, made to blossom 
in a garden, is therefore over luxuriant ; but being very faith- 
ful in every particular does not deserve to be stigmatized as 
" bad."

Herb more or less downy, and of a hoary or glau-

Stem 
erect, leafy, about a foot high ; branched in the upper part, ex- 
cept in weak specimens.
Lowest leaves obovate, soon wither-

and toothed in the most common and downy variety ; in /3 nearly 
smooth, and more entire.
Fl. numerous, small, white, their co-

ish-oblongpoMc/ies, whose flat border, very narrow at the sides, 
is much dilated, and cloven, at the upper edge, the style being 
about equal in length to the lobes.
The surface at both sides 
of the pouch is covered with minute depressed scales, which 
mark this species well, and are sometimes, in y, accompanied 
by a few hairs, when it becomes Thlaspi hirtum of Hudson, but 
not of Linnaeus.
I have always found the seeds solitary in each 
cell.

Co^i/^er/ons incumbent, 
as I have found them on examination, and as there is no room

character of the solitary seeds is thus confirmed, and the true 
genus of these plants perfectly estabUshed.
Ray well knew this 
species, and the old figures, of which those of the two Bauhins 
only are original, answer perfectly to our plant, though Hudson's 
Thlaspi hirtum is but a variety of campestre.

Leaves elegantly pinnate, of numerous pairs of 
elliptic-oblong, entire, smooth leaflets, with a terminal one of 
the same size, their common stalk channelled and bordered, so 
that the whole may be denominated a deeply pinnatifid leaf.
Fl.
white, very minute, corymbose.
Pet. narrow.
Pouches in longish 
clusters, spreading, oval, compressed, at first entire, tipped with 
the sessile stigma, but as they advance to maturity the point of 
each valve becomes slightly elongated or dilated, making a small 
notch to contain the somewhat elevated stigma.
Seeds 2 in 
each cell, one above the other.
I beg leave to repeat that this plant has the pouch of a Lepidium, 
according to the original idea of that genus, being " emarginate 
and many-seeded"; but the cotyledons being accumbent, not 
incumbent, oblige us to take advantage of the seeds not being 
solitary, as in Lepidium better defined, to separate it, along 
with others whose seeds are still more numerous, as a distinct, 
though not very natural, genus.
See Hooker and DeCandolle.
The name commemorates the late Miss Hutchins, a very distin- 
. guished botanist, whose discoveries in the neighbourhood of 
Belfast have often been celebrated, and whose premature death 
is deplored by all who knew her.

In waste, as well as cultivated ground, and by way sides, every

Annual.
March — November.
Root tapering, whitish, with a peculiar smoke-like scent.
Herb 
very variable in luxuriance, rough with prominent hairs.
Stem 
branched, leafy, erect or spreading, from 6 to 12 inches high.
Radical leaves several, more or less deeply pinnatifid, toothed 
or notched, their terminal lobe usually triangular and acute ; 
stem-leaves oblong, acute, toothed, clasping the stem with their 
arrow-shaped base.
Fl. small, corymbose, often tinged with 
purplish brown.
Pet. entire.
Pouches smooth, on long spread- 
ing stalks, forming a long cluster, each nearly triangular, a 
little tumid, abrupt with a broad shallow sinus at the extremity, 
in which the very short style is situated, but the lobes are 
scarcely, if at all, dilated or winged, though in some measure 
compressed at the margin ; partition narrow.
Seeds about 5, 
or more, in each cell.
Prof.
DeCandolie remarks that this herb is much less acrid than 
the rest of its order, and rather glutinous to the taste.
Small 
birds eat the seeds and flowers.
The want of a dilated border 
to the pouch has induced that eminent botanist, and a few 
others, to separate the present species from Thlaspi.
But 
surely the difference, which 1 have long ago noted, is very slight 
and dubious.
1 rather concur with Mr. Brown in not making it 
of generic importance ; and at any rate the name of Thlaspi 
belongs irrefragably to this identical plant, having been given 
byDioscorides, Pliny, and every succeeding writer, though Caes- 
alpinus, book 8, chapter 74 and 76, (not book 2,) mentions 
Capsella as one of the synonyms in Dioscorides, of which I find 
no traces.
The word indeed is bad Latin, synonymous with 
capsula.
The Common Shepherd's Purse occurs in almost every part of the 
globe.
To the various and distant countries mentioned by De- 
Candolie, I can add Nepaul, from whence Dr. Wallich has sent 
specimens.
Their pouches however are much broader and shorter 
than those from the Isle de Bourbon, but there are, in both in- 
stances, 8 or 10 seeds in each cell.

Linnaeus and DeCandoUe have made this a distinct species.
I do 
not venture to assert that it is so, but the late accurate Mr. Don 
was of that opinion, and rightly determined it to be theLinnaean 
plant.
The great size and beauty of ihejiowers are remarkable.
Dr. Richardson and Dillenius found our supposed variety y of C.
officinalis, which some have taken for the groenlandica, to remain 
unaltered from seed in their gardens ; and this report l^in- 
duced me to suspect their plant to have been really the^ron- 
landica, though they would hardly have omitted to notice the 
large flowers.
Culture, under accurate observation, may settle 
the whole difficulty; for opinion here is not sufficient.

The long, cylindrical, white, highly pungent roots, well known for 
their use, on many occasions, at table, run deep into the ground, 
and are e.xtremely difficult of extirpation.
The stems are 2 feet

rowly pinnatifid.
Radical leaves very large, on long stalks, up-

foot or more in length.
Fl. numerous, white, in numerous co-

There has been much controversy respecting the Coronopus 
of antient authors, some taking it for Cochlearia Corono- 
pus of Linnaeus, others for his Plantago Coronopus^ others 
for Myosunis, or for Achillea Ptarmica, while that of 
Pliny seems by his description very different from all 
these, as well as from what Dioscorides intended.
Dr.
Sibthorp, the professed object of whose journey was to 
determine the old Greek names, fixed upon Lotus ornitho- 
podioides as the true xopuvoTrous ; though in his journal, 
printed by the Rev. R.
Walpole, Travels in the East, 
1 02, he speaks of Cochlearia Coronopus as the plant of 
Dioscorides, still called xoupowoTroBi in the isle of Fanno, 
and eaten as a pot herb.
It seems to me that the name 
in question was applied by the antients to various plants, 
whose roots were crowned with radiating depressed 
leaves.
In this obscurity, where nothing can really be 
ascertained, though I had originally followed Gaertner, 
I now cannot but agree with my friend DeCandolle, in 
preferring the name by which he has commemorated a 
most eminent physiological botanist, the Rev. M.
Sene- 
bier of Geneva.
Of his merits there can be no doubt, 
nor can the characters of this genus, as distinct from every 
other of its tribe, ever come in question.

Stem about 2 feet high, wand-like, slightly glau.
cous, leafy, panicled at the top.
Radical leaves numerous, obo- 
vate, crenate and wavy, smooth, except an occasional marginal 
fringe ; the rest sessile, arrow-shaped, entire, smooth, clasping 
the stem.
Panicle of many compound racemose branches, beset 
with diminished lanceolate leaves, like bracteas, all of a yellow 
hue as well as the stalks.
Fl. numerous, small, bright yellow.
Pouches on capillary stalks, pendulous, wedge-shaped, obtuse, 
tipped with the stigma, quite smooth, blackish, a little shining, 
finally bursting in the middle, where the seed is lodged.
As the antient Britons are reported to have painted their bodies 
with the blue colour obtained from this plant, and still used in 
dyeing, the Woad is most probably an original production of 
our island j though what occurs now and then, about cultivated 
fields, is supposed to have escaped from the crops occasionally 
raised, chiefly in the middle part of England.
The naturalized 
plants are less perfectly smooth, and far less luxuriant, than the 
cultivated ones.

We are much obliged to Prof.
DeCandolle, for finding a 
character in the lanceolate j-wrf, and dilated stalks of the

Cardamine, -the habit, magnitude, beauty, and peculiar 
kind of root, marking it so distinctly.
Some of the spe-

Root small, tapering.
Herb erect, slender, pale green, smooth in 
every part, except the stipidas.
Stem 1 ^ or 2 feet high, gene- 
rally a little branched, leafy, angular, hollow, often zigzag.
Leaves of numerous opposite lanceolate leiiflets, with an odd 
one ; all equal, more or less notched, rarely entire ; paler be- 
neath, Stipulas lanceolate, acute, deflexed, clasping the stem, 
all finely fringed, and surely, (notwithstanding the theory of my 
learned friend DeCandolle, who thinks them merely segments 
of a pinnatifid leaf,) as evidently stipulas as in any plant what- 
ever.
Fl. numerous, extremely small, while, occasionally desti- 
tute of peiaZs. Pods erect, very slender, composing long clus- 
ters, and discharging their seeds with a crackling noise, and 
great force, on the slightest touch or concussion, by means of

Root of many white fibres.
Herb variable in size and luxuriance, 
deep green, more or less hairy, rarely quite smooth.
Stem from

lateral branches of various lengths, leafy, angular, often zigzag, 
hollow in the centre, clothed with fine, prominent, scattered 
hairs.
Leaves alternafe, all pinnate, on short stalks, without 
stipulas ; leaflets stalked, sometimes alternate, all for the most 
part somewhat hairy ; those of the radical leaves roundish, or 
heart-shaped, coarsely notched ; those of the lower or middle 
part of the stem more oblong j the upper ones linear-obovate.

or quite linear, obtuse, generally entire, but in this respect, as 
well as in length, they vary.
Fl. small, white, corymbose.
Two 
shorter stamens often wanting.
Pods in long clusters, erect, 
slender, smooth, or occasionally hairy, their valves undulated by 
the projection of the seeds j stigma almost sessile.
Whatever the C.
sijlvatica, umbrosa and parvi/lora of other authors 
may be, the Linnaean parviflora is clearly a distinct species, with 
all its leaflets oblong and nearly entire, the stem bushy ; the 
pods shorter, with a more evident style.
This plant is well re- 
presented in Gmelins Fl. Sibirica, v.
3. t.

I know nothing 
like it in Britain.
We have most assuredly only one species as 
above described, nor have I any other from Switzerland, Haller's 
n. 472 /3, confused in his Nomcnclator with n.
4/3, being truly 
a variety, and by no means the genuine parviflora.
I have his 
4/2 in various states from the Rev. Mr.
DuCros, who remarks 
that flowers with 4, 5, or 6 stamens grow on the same plant.
To account for the strange error in Fl. Dan., where this species is 
named C.
impatiens, we must recollect that after Oeder gave up 
the publication of that work, the editors merely named the plants 
from a view of the drawings, in too hasty and superficial a man- 
ner, calling Mentha hirsuta Origanum vulgare; Cardamine ama- 
ra, 1.
148, (which Haller quotes t.
48,) C.
hirsuta; the true hir- 
suta, not adverting to its obvious wantof stipulas, C.
impatiens-, 
nor are these all the errors of a similar kind that might be 
pointed out ; see Raphanus Raphanistrum.
It is now in much 
better hands.

Common in meadows and moist pastures.
Perennial.
April, May.
Root tuberous, somewhat toothed in the manner of the genus Den- 
taria, to which the affinity of this species is remarkable, see Fl.
Br. and Engl.
Bot., and with which therefore the accurate Mr.
Brown has united the whole genus ; see Dentaria.
Herb variable 
in luxuriance ; generally smooth, of a shining green ; now and 
then a little hairy.
Stem about a foot high, or more, round, leafy, 
simple.
Radical leaves several, on long stalks, each of one or 
more pairs of roundish, or heart-shaped, wavy, angular, or 
toothed leaflets, sometimes viviparous, the terminal one largest ; 
stem-leaves of more numerous, and much narrower, /e«^e<s, which 
are in general linear, entire, and smooth.
Fl. corymbose, nu- 
merous, large and handsome, either light purple, flesh-coloured, 
or white ; sometimes more or less double.
The petals are re- 
markable for a tooth, or notch, on the claw, noticed in Haller, 
but not from his own observation.
Pods not often perfected.
Style more prominent than in some other species.
The Jlowers, recent or dried, have been reported to cure Epilepsy, 
but unhappily do not deserve such credit.
They are agreeably 
pungent, and may be eaten with other herbs in a salad.
They 
come with the Cuckoo, whence one of their English, as well as 
Latin, names ; and they cover the meadows as with linen bleach- 
ing, which is supposed to be the origin of the other, now ex- 
tended to the whole genus.
They are associated with pleasant 
ideas of spring, and join with the White Saxifrage, the Cowslip, 
Primrose, and Hare-bell, to compose many a rustic nosegay.

Root toothed, somewhat creeping.
Stems 1 to 2 feet high, leafy, 
a little zigzag, more or less hairy, their lower part creeping, 
with several radicles, and sometimes a few slender scions.
Leaf- 
lets all dilated ; those of the upper leaves oblong or elliptical, 
deeply and unequally wavy or notched ; those of the radical 
ones more rounded, obtuse and entire.
Fl. the size of the last, 
but always white or cream-coloured, with violet anthers.
Mr.

slender, obliquely elongated, style, and minute stigma, which 
seem to be deciduous, still leaving the pod with a sharp straight 
point.
C. hirsuta of Fl. Dan.
t. 148, which Is any thing rather than real 
hirsuta, is suspected by DeCandolIe to be a variety of amara, 
and so it seems to me.
C. amara, before it flowers, greatly resembles Water Cresses, but 
the taste is bitter and nauseous.
Nasturtium aquaticum of the 
Hortus Eystettensis, with its double variety, evidently belongs not 
to this, but to C.
pratensis.

brium, with which its various species have long been 
thought, by the most experienced botanists, to disagree, 
as much as they agree among themselves.
The accum- 
bent cotyledons decide the question ; and the short, thick, 
turgid pods afford a ready and obvious character.
The name is Latin, and, according to PUny, belonged to 
some stimulating plant, pungent to the nostrils.
The 
only objection to its present adaptation is, that it has been 
applied so variously by botanists to many other herbs ; 
but it well suits our first, or best-known, species.

Water Cresses are well known for their agreeable warmth and fla-

I should have preferred the old established Latin

Mr. Curtis, from his own observations, well determined this spe- 
cies, though he ' did not attempt to settle its synonyms, which 
were, in his time, singularly confused, and that confusion has 
since been augmented.
Neither Linnaeus nor Hudson under- 
stood the present plant, however distinct it appears to us.
Cur- 
tis's name is at least as good as palustre, and indeed more cor- 
rect ; SO that though the latter may be of a prior date, I have 
not thought it wortli adopting.
Haller was one of the few bo- 
tanists, who knew this species well, and his synonyms are justly 
applied.
The annual, not creeping, root, and the copious, short, 
thick pods, at once distinguish it from the foregoing, as well as 
from the following.

In rivers, ditches, and places about their banks, not constantly

Perennial.
June — August.
Roots long and stringy, perpendicular, not creeping, but throwing 
out numerous fibres, such as proceed from the lower parts of 
the trailing or floating, wide-spreading, leafy, striated, not much 
branching, stem.
Leaves generally smooth, but occasionally 
downy when growing in dry situations ; the lowermost on long 
stalks, deeply pectinated under water, otherwise elliptic-lanceo- 
late, cut, or serrated ; upper ones sessile, or clasping, oblong, 
pectinated, serrated, or nearly entire, all varying greatly accord- 
ing to the depth of the water, or strength of the current ; on 
such plants as grow entirely out of the water, the leaves are 
smaller, broader, and merely serrated.
Fl. small, bright yellow, 
plentiful, in aggregate clusters.
Pet. always longer than the 
calyx.
Pods usually small and abortive, roundish, tipped with 
the style often as long as themselves.
This plant is noticed by the celebrated M.
Chateaubriand, in his 
account of England, for its wonderful powers of increase by root.
He observed it in the river near Beccles, where he long resided as 
an emigrant, and his rather florid description has excited wonder 
and curiosity in many, who daily, perhaps, pass over, without 
regard, several no less interesting works of their Creator.

Ra-

lyrate, with a rounded toothed terminal lobe, being much like 
the first species, but of a more neat and regular figure ; the 
stem-leaves are often partly lyrate also, but the upper ones are 
deeply and regularly pinnatifid, with parallel, linear-oblong,

• pods, being perfectly distinct, as it seems to me, from the others, 
nor is there any forked or starry pubescence to be found.
-Leaves 
crowded, stalked, lanceolate, acute, almost invariably entire ; 
the lowermost, if any, slightly serrated ; all deep green, with 
more or less of a minute silvery hoariness, especially at the back.
Fl. corymbose, sweet-scented ; their petah always of a uniform 
bright golden yellow, not stained with brown or blood-red as in 
the garden Cli. Cheiri, though the calyx is purplish.
Pods race- 
mose, erect, 14- or 2 inches long, covered with close hairs chiefly, 
if not altogether, pointing upwards ; each valve marked with an 
elevated central line, often vanishing about half way up, and 
hardlyTdiscemible at all in Mr. Davali's Swiss specimens ; though 
very strong in some French ones, with shorter broader pods, 
which most accord with Dr. Hooker's, the style excepted.
Style, 
in all the specimens I have seen, about a line in length in the 
flower, rather more on the ripe pod, stout, angular, a little 
bristly, crowned with the cloven stigma, whose lobes are finally 
brought close together.
The seeds are flat, with a narrow, mem- 
branous, deciduous border at one side, as well as at the summit, 
of each.
The late Mr. Crowe, whose remarks were always worthy of atten- 
tion, and to whom we owe so much for his unrivalled discrimi- 
nation of Willows, observed that the petals of our wild C//eJran- 
thus merely become recurved as they advance towards decay, 
and do not hang loosely flaccid, like those of the true Ch. Cheiri, 
or Blood Wall-flower of the gardens.
There is indeed a culti- 
vated double variety of Ch.fruticulosus, always with plain yellow 
flowers, and though more luxuriant than the wild plant, still 
unlike the Ch. Cheiri.
Dr. Hooker appears to me quite cor- 
rect in his Fl. Scot., except a slip of the pen, leaves for petals ; 
but I quote his Fl. Lond.
and its luminous dissections, with he- 
sitation, on account of the strongly-ribbed valves of the short 
pods, and the almost total want of a style, such as I have never 
seen in any Wall-flower.
Ch. Cheiri and its supposed varieties 
enumerated by DeCandoUe, require more correct examination 
than they have, as yet, received.
I do not presume to give a 
decisive opinion concerning them, but merely describe what I 
have seen, depending with implicit confidence on my friend 
Hooker for the accuracy of his representations.

Stems erect, 2 or 3 feet high, 
. slightly branched, le£ify, round, solid, clothed, more or less co- 
piously, with very short, deflexed, simple or forked, minute 
hairs.
Leaves scattered, ovate-lanceolate, or slightly heart- 
shaped, taper-pointed, veiny, single-ribbed, bordered with nu- 
merous, unequal, prominent, obtuse, somewhat glandular teeth ; 
all nearly or quite sessile, except some of the lowermost.
Fl.
terminal, corymbose, numerous, rather large and handsome, 
pale purple, or white, perpetually varying from seed in this re- 
spect ; by day they have little or no smell, except in rainy wea- 
ther, but in an evening they are highly and delightfully fragrant.
Cal. tinged with purple, rough with coarse spreading hairs, es- 
pecially in the upper part ; seldom quite naked.
Pet. abrupt, 
• wavy, notched, sometimes having a small terminal tooth.
Pod 
2 inches long, ascending, or erect, a little curved, acute, of a 
slender cylindrical form, usually quite smooth, with 4 simple, 
not bordered, angles, whose somewhat striated interstices are 
equal, except the very irregular swellings and undulations 
c.iused by the numerous seeds, which are elliptical, concave at 
one side, destitute of a border.
Few British plants have been enveloped in more uncertainty than 
this, owing to the epithet inodora, which, as botanists generally 
hunt by daylight, was found applicable to our wild Hesperi'i ; 
while the well-known rich nocturnal fragrance of the garden 
plant, dedicated in its name, for that very reason, to the even- 
ing star, was supposed to render the latter specifically distinct.
This opinion was confirmed in the mind of Linnaeus by a speci- 
men from Jacquin, marked Hesperis tertia Clusii, in which the 
lower teeth of the rather softer leaves are peculiarly dilated, as in 
Jacquin's plate above indicated.
Hence Linnaeus, giving credit 
to the want of scent, plumed himself on establishing a specific 
difference.
But the characters he gives have all long been found 
illusive, and Mr. Brown has justly, in my opinion, united these 
two Linnaean species, without marking either as even a variety.
We therefore retain the original, and least exceptionable, spe- 
cific name.

frequently rough, especially on the upper side, with short, spread-

perfectly lyrate, sometimes merely hastate, rarely only obovate 
and slightly pinnatifid, always tapering at the base into a slender 
footstalk, longer than the leaf.
Stem-leaves scattered, lanceo-

smooth, sometimes hairy; the lower ones having now and then 
a lateral notch, and more or less of a footstalk.
Fl. in terminal,

Cal. smooth, 
slightly spreading, membranous at the margin.
Pet. twice as

Pods spreading, smooth, linear, tipped with the capi- 
-tate, somewhat elevated, stigma-, their valves separating at the 
top and bottom, slightly recurved at each end, but not revolute ; 
in Ehrhart's specimen they have a slender, not very prominent 
keel, which may also be perceived in some of my British ones, 
though not so far advanced.
Seeds disposed in a simple row.
The suggestions of my learned friend DeCandolle have induced me 
to be very particular in my description, and to examine carefully 
how far the real Linnaean Cardamine petrcea differs from our plant.
In theflowers and pods I can find no discriminating character, but 
the leaves of that Cardamine, to which Linnaeus has misapplied 
synonyms of our Arabis, are truly, as he defines them, " oblong 
and toothed," at least the radical ones ; being rather linear-lan- 
ceolate, or partly obovate, with numerous, regular, equal, blunt, 
prominent teeth, and by no means approaching to a lyrate, much 
less a hastate, form; the stem-leaves are linear and entire; 
every part of the plant is perfectly smooth, and seems of a lighter 
green.
Such is the original Swedish specimen, above 6 inches 
high, with which f.386 of F/.
Dan., though not particularly good, 
appears to agree tolerably well.
I have another wild Swedish 
specimen of a smaller size, about 3 inches high, of which all the 
leaves are obovate and nearly entire.
The plate of Dillenius in Hort.
Elth.
is excellent.
That of Loesel, 
Fl. Pruss.
t. 13, represents the true Sisymbrium arenosum.
The 
leaves in Crantz's figure, as well as in Ehrhart's specimen, are 
not so deeply sinuated as in my numerous British ones, but their 
notches are not like the teeth of Cardamine petrcea.

All the difficulty about the genus of this plant, mentioned in E7igl.

is now happily removed on Mr. Brown's principles.
Its 
glands indeed " are those of a Brassica," but the flat accumbent 
cotyledons, and simple row of seeds, settle the point.
The habit 
confirms the generic characters, which are altogether those of an 
Arabis.

Radical leaves abun- 
dant the first season, withering as the stem arises, lyrate, jagged, 
large, dark green, veiny, rough with small sharp bristly hairs ; 
those on the lower part of the stem more simple, smoother,

Most botanists, both British and foreign, have found a difficulty in 
distinguishing this plant from B.
Napus, and the confusion of 
their synonyms is inextricable.
B. campestris is perhaps the most 
certainly wild of all our three species now described, nor can 
there be a doubt concerning it, if the plate in Engl.

Hudson mistook for this a

Glands 4 ; 2 at the inside of the shorter filaments,

Stigma capitate, rather small.
Pod nearly cylindrical, variously beaked, of 2 concave 
undulated valves, and 2 longitudinal cells, besides 1 for 
the most part in the beak, generally barren.
Seeds in a 
single row, nearly globular, with 1 occasionally in the 
beak ; cotyledons folded, incumbent, their doubled edges 
meeting the radicle.
Upright, branching, annual or biennial herbs^ often hairy or 
bristly.
Leaves lyrate, or deeply cut, or toothed.
Fl.
yellow, in corymbose clusters.
Seeds acrid.
The beak 
of the pod, in some, is little else than a permanent unal- 
tered style.
The seeds in those species which constitute 
DeCandolle's Diplotaxis are partially and very imper- 
fectly two-ranked, and their calyx spreads much less than 
it ought to do, this being the chief mai'k of difference 
between Sinapis and Brassica.

the style finally becomes tumid at the base.
Seeds several, 
brown, sufficiently known for their domestic use,-and stimulating 
medical properties.
All the figures of the old authors, J.

§24 TETRADYNAMIA—SILIQUOSA.
Sinapis.
About London, Westminster, Windsor, Chester, Bristol,Yarmouth, 
and other old towns.
Perennial.
June — October.
Root tapering, rather woody.
Herb for the most part entirely- 
smooth, and more or less glaucous all over, fetid when bruised.
Stem bushy, erect, li or 2 feet high, with numerous round leafy 
branches, occasionally besprinkled with a few hairs.
Leaves 
scattered, a little fleshy, of a glaucous green, very smooth, irre- 
gularly lobed and cut ; the lower ones stalked, once or twice 
pinnatifid ; uppermost lanceolate, undivided, and sessile ; the 
margins of all entire, or sparingly notched.
Fl. large and hand- 
some, but unpleasantly scented, light lemon-coloured.
Cal.
spreading considerably from the very base, but not horizontally, 
the tips mostly hairy.
Fods an inch or more in length, linear, 
smooth, compressed, erect, on spreading stalks almost as long j 
valves undulated, slightly keeled, veiny ; beak none, except the 
rather short, tapering, angular, furrowed style, not so tumid at 
the base as even the last, and destitute of any cell, or rudiment 
of a seed.
Seeds in the proper cells of the pod numerous, round, 
disposed so as to form two, more or less complete, rows in each 
cell.
On this last character Prof DeCandolle principally founds 
his genus Diplotaxis and its name.
The want of a distinct 
seed-bearing beak to the pod, in some instances, is likewise 
noted.
But the foregoing species, a genuine Sinapis, has scarcely 
more of a beak than any of them.
The learned author candidly 
allows also that the double row of seeds is by no means constant, 
or without exception ; and indeed their arrangement is at all 
times far less decided than in Turritis, where there can be no 
question about the matter.

Annual.
August, September.
Root tapering, small.
Stem branching from the bottom, about a 
span high, spreading, leafy in the lower part, clothed all over 
with reflexed bristly hairs.
Leaves usually quite smooth, of a 
lightish green, not glaucous, varying much in form, either 
broadly lanceolate inclining to obovate, or imperfectly lyrate j 
deeply serrated, or unequally sinuated ; always acute, not 
rounded, at the extremity, and tapering at the base into afoot- 
stalk.
Fl. lemon-coloured, smaller and paler than the last, in 
dense abrupt coiymbose clusters, greatly elongated after flower- 
ing.
Cal. moderately spreading from the bottom, a little hairy.
Pet. obovate, somewhat spreading.
Pods on distant spi'eading .
stalks of various lengths, much like those of S.
teniiifoUa, but 
less decidedly erect, and the seerfs less accurately double-ranked.
Style and stigma as in that species.
The calyx in both spreads 
less than the character of a Sinapis requires.
I have Gouan's 
plant from himself.
It is not constant enough in the deeper di- 
visions of its leaves to be mai'ked as a variety.

Upright, branched, spreading, smooth or bristly herbs,'

Fl. large, yellow, white, or

Pods internally spongy, very va-

the more decidedly jointed pods, breaking transversely,

Nearly akin to the foregoing, but differing in its larger paler leaf- 
lets, much less deeply cut ; and in the powerful musky fragrance, 
as well as greater viscidity, of the whole herb.
The stipulas are 
large, rounded and wavy, very thin and membranous.
Bracteas 
similar, but smaller.
Pet. rose-coloured, unspotted, smaller 
than the last, all nearly equal.
Mr. Sowerby observed the abor- 
tive filaments to be peculiarly broad ; and the perfect ones to 
have a tooth at each side near the base.
This last mark would 
greatly strengthen the specific character, if it should prove con- 
stant, which in these organs, so various, if not mutable, in this 
natural order, cannot absolutely be relied on, unless confirmed 
by experience.

In gravelly fields and waste ground, very common.
Annual.
June — Sejytember.
Root tapering.
Habit and pubescence much like the last species, 
but the whole plant in general is smaller, especially the Jlowers, 
which have but 5 perfect s<rt?nens, and their blueish petals scarcely 
extend beyond the calyx.
The leaves are mostly opposite, more 
deeply lobed, each lobe oblong-wedge-shaped, and pretty re- 
gularly 3 -cleft.
But the clear and certain specific difference 
rests on the capsules, which are keeled, and quite even, not 
wrinkled as in G.
molle, neither are they smooth as in that, but 
covered with close-pressed, or upright, short hairs.
The seeds 
are, like those of the molle, quite smooth ; not dotted as in G.
rotundifolium.
For the accurate discrimination of these 3 species and the pyre- 
naicum, about which all botanists had been uncertain, I am, like 
Mr. Curtis, indebted to my late friend Mr. Davall.
They can 
never more be mistaken.
The variety j3, examined in the Sherardian herbarium at Oxford, 
differs merely in being much smaller than usual.
Indeed few 
plants vary more in size than the present.

Root tuberous, perennial.
Stems 2 or 3 feet high, upright, leafy,

soft hairs.
Leaves deep green, finely hairy, rather soft to the 
touch ; the lower ones on very long stalks, kidney-shaped, 2 or 
3 inches wide, lobed more or less deeply, the segments notched, 
rounded and bluntish ; upper ones opposite, on shorter stalks, 
with fewer, deeper, more spreading lobes.
Stipulas broad, hairy, 
jagged at the points.
Fl. light purple, much larger than those 
of G.
moUe. Cal.
pointed, downy and somewhat fringed, scarcely 
half the length of the petals, which are inversely heart-shaped, 
with short very hairy claws.
Stam.
all perfect, but the 5 outer 
ones, as Mr. Curtis remarks, soon drop their anthers, whence 
they have been supposed originally imperfect.
Caps, keeled,

becoming smoother.
Seeds with a perfectly even surface.
The flowers are sometimes white.
Linnaeus confounded this with 
his moile originally, and it is also the large-flowered molle of 
Mr. Curtis, found about Chelsea hospital.
His figures of both 
are excellent, and he has conectly described their capsules, 
though he did not contrast them in the specific characters, for 
which these parts alone are all-sufficient.
In one of the Linnsean specimens I find a wrinkle or two at each 
side of the keel, of some of the capsules, not of all, nor do these 
by any means resemble the copiously wrinkled capsules of G.
molle.

Annual.
June, July.
Whole herb peculiarly soft, like velvet, with a considerable de- 
gree of viscidity, noticed by Haller.
In general appearance it 
most resembles the usual state of G.
molle ; but all the leaves, 
even the uppermost, are opposite.
This character has led me to 
transfer to the molle some synonyms of old authors, applied in 
Fl.Br., on the authority of C.
Bauhin and others, to the present 
species ; for the alternate leaves in their figures, not to men- 
tion other characters, when carefully examined, agree better 
with that far more common plant than with this.
The flowers 
of G.
rotundifolium have a viscid calyx, and narrow, undivided, 
light crimson petals.
Caps, turgid, thin, slightly keeled, clothed 
with prominent hairs ; the surface quite even, never wrinkled ; 
the awns are, in like manner, hairy externally.
Seeds oval, not 
so properly dotted, as entirely covered with a curious net-work 
of fine, regular, prominent wrinkles ; which obviously and de- 
cidedly distinguish this from every species with which it could 
be confounded ; especially from molle and pusillum, under all 
their different aspects.
No ambiguity attends this character.
DeCandoUe has understood and adopted it ; Willdenow omits 
it, and Cavanilles says the /rwi^ and seeds oi G.
rotundifolium 
are the same as those of the lucidum; for indeed he paid no 
proper attention to those important parts.
Lightfoot does not 
advert to the seeds of the rotundifolium ; but I have specimens 
from himself correctly named.
We now readily discriminate 
these plants, which Haller found so difficult, and Linnaeus so 
little understood.
No part of o\ir whole Flora is more free 
from obscurity ; nor are the foreign species of Geranium and its 
allies less capable of clear illustration on the same principles.

Perennial.
July — September.
Root stout and woody, knotty, of a dark reddish brown, and an as- 
tringent quality, creeping, as Dr. Hooker observes, considera- 
bly.
Stems several, lax and spreading, 1|^ or 2 feet long, often 
prostrate, as in /3, or pendulous in craggy situations j round, 
branched, leafy j the hairy pubescence horizontally prominent, 
ieai'es opposite, stalked, dark green, roughish, deeply lobed 
and cut ; their outline somewhat orbicular.
Stijmlas short and 
broad, hairy.
Flou:er-stalks very long, solitary and single-flow- 
. ered, though with a joint, and pair of small bracteas, above the 
middle.
Fl. large, above an inch broad, of a fine crimson or 
blood-colour ; in /3 flesh-coloured, with purple veins.
Cal.
awned, generally 5 -ribbed.
Pet. inversely heart-shaped.
Caps.
keeled, even, a little downy, and crowned with several white 
bristles.
Seeds rather kidney-shaped, dark brown, not smooth, 
but all over very curiously and minutely wrinkled and dotted, 
as described in Fl. Br.
; sometimes 2 in each capsule.
The late Mr. Davall sent from Switzerland a variety with 2 flow- 
ers on each stalk, which Haller says is not rare.
We have no 
tidings of any such in Britain.
The maritime varieties with white flowers, so frequent in some of 
this genus, as well as in Erodium, seem to account for the pale 
hue of our variety /3.
This is not always prostrate, and though 
constant in colour when cultivated, presents no good specific 
distinction.

In the grassy borders of fields, and by way sides, on a gravelly 
soil.
Perennial.
July, August.
Root tough and woody.
Herb bright green, more or less rough 
with spreading, simple, not starry, hairs, unaccompanied by 
any short, dense, woolly pubescence, and exhaling a musky 
odour, especially in hot weather, or when drawn lightly through 
the hand.
Stems about 2 feet high, leafy, round, but little 
branched.
Radical leaves on long stalks, smaller, rounder, and 
less deeply lobed than the upper ones, soon withering away ; 
stem-leaves divided to the very base into 5 pinnatifid lobes, all 
whose segments are linear, acute, channelled, and frequently 
undulated, usually in some degree hairy, seldom quite smooth.
Fl. on .
long, axillary, simple stalks, rose-coloured, large and 
handsome.
Cal. paler than the foliage, coarsely hairy or bristly ; 
its 3 outer leaves linear-lanceolate.
Pet. wedge-shaped, slightly 
cloven, jagged.
Caps, clothed with dense silky hairs.
The white-flowered variety, figured by Dr. Sims, is kept for cu- 
riosity in gardens.
It differs in no other respect from the, more 
beautiful, wild plant.
The musky scent undoubtedly proceeds 
from the herbage, as described in Fl. Br.
and Engl.
Bat., not 
from the flowers.
We scarcely ever find our great countryman, Ray, in an error, 
but in this instance he mistook the plant of the Bauhins, whose

Miller indeed, like Hudson, has erred in making both these 
plants natives of England, and many authors have either taken 
them for the same, or confounded their synonyms.
M. Alcea may

Root much branched, running deep into the ground.
Stem from 
6 to 10 feet high, upright, strait, thick, scarred; simple be- 
low ; branching into a leafy head ; the branches besprinkled 
with fine, deflexed, compound, bristly hairs.
Leaves of a grey-

M. DeCandoUe remarks that each prominence, at the base 
of the corolla, contains a nectariferous gland ; and that 
each of the lateral anthers has but one cell, there being 
therefore only 8 cells, or, properly speaking, 4 anthers in 
all.
But it is easier to understand them as 2 double- 
celled, and 4 single-celled, anthers.
The plants are herbaceous, smooth, brittle, with annual or 
perennial roots, in the latter case sometimes tuberous.

botanists, in former times as well as in our days, have 
subdivided the genus by its fruit, and the Linnaean Fu-

Linnaeus considered this as a genus in which one part of

Root of numerous fibres.
Stem erect, a foot high, and, like the 
footstalks, triangular, brittle, juicy, reddish and shining.
Leaves 
thrice ternate, of a bright, rather glaucous, green ; leaflets wedge- 
shaped, with rounded lobes.
Fl. in a solitary, terminal, upright 
cluster, scentless, lemon-coloured, with deep-yellow lips.
Brac- 
teas very small, ovate or awl-shaped, serrated, acute, much 
shorter than the Jlower-stalks.
Calyx-leaves ovate, or lanceolate, 
with blunt points, membranous, soon deciduous.
Spur of the 
corolla rounded, incurved, very much shorter than the stalk, as 
is likewise the rather compressed and quadrangular pod.
Linneeus at first confounded this with his F.
capnoides, but subse- 
quently took great pains to distinguish the lutea and its .syno- 
nyms.
The true capnoides, preserved in his herbarium from the 
Upsal garden, and apparently not known to the learned Prof.
DeCandolle, is certainly distinct, having large, leafy, deeply cut, 
stalked bracteas, paler powers, an awl-shaped spur as long as 
the rest of the corolla, pods twice or thrice as long as the flower- 
stalks, and according to Linnaeus, who cultivated it, an annual 
root, which Willdenow confirms j but the latter misapplies Hal-

Most like F.
officinalis, but larger in every part ; the leaves less 
glaucous J their tendrils twisting round other plants, by which 
the branching stem climbs to the height of 3 or 4 feet ; and the 
Jlowers are on the whole paler, though the tip of each petal is 
deep red • the pods are not abrupt, or inversely heart-shaped, 
but more globose, with a slight depression at each side of the 
place of the style, which is deciduous, like that of all the single- 
seeded Fumarice.
Dr. Withering's figure erroneously represents 
tendrils distinct from the footstalks.
Prof.
DeCandoUe distinguishes our plant from what he esteems the 
real F.
capreolata of Linnaeus, of which, as he understands it, a 
plate is given in his excellent Icones, t.
34, But in this plate all 
the fruit-stalks are peculiarly straight and upright, which is the 
character of his F.
media.
In our capreolata they become more 
or less recurved as the pods ripen, which DeCandoUe gives as a 
mark of his capreolata.
The Linnaean herbarium here lends us 
no assistance, Linnaeus having adopted his F.
capreolata from 
other authors, without possessing a specimen, if he ever saw one.
Our plant however is that of his pupil Ehrhart, and of Jacquin, 
from each of whom I have specimens.
The calyx-leaves in all 
my specimens are nearly as entire as in DeCandolle's figure j 
being much less toothed than in Curtis's.
The synonyms of the various Fumarice in old authors might afford 
materials for an ample dissertation.

Fl. in a simple terminal cluster usually blue, but frequently pink, 
white, or purple ; always marked with green lines ; the perma- 
nent calyx turning green, and remaining long, with its closed 
wings, sheltering the ripening pod.
It is hard to say why this plant obtained the name of Polygala, or 
Milkwort ; and indeed that name has been given by some authors 
to several truly papilionaceous herbs or shrubs, more deserving 
the reputation of yielding good food for cows.
Our Polygala, like 
some other European species of the same genus, is bitter, and 
when given in infusion, promotes expectoration, and is good for 
a catarrhous cough.
Reports have arisen of P.
amara being found in England ; but the 
specimens I have seen were no other than the vulgaris.

base, where the honey is lodged ; its margin in 5 unequal, 
moi'e or less deep, teeth or segments ; the lower tooth 
longest ; 2 upper shortest and most distant.
Corolla papilionaceous, unequal ; petals characterized as 
follows.
Standard single, largest, overshadowing the rest ; its claw 
flattish, inserted into the upper margin of the receptacle ; 
the part beyond the calyx roundish, or obovate, scarcely 
ever divided, marked with a longitudinal central fold or 
keel, and depressed at each side, closely embracing the 
petals beneath, by means of two prominences towards its 
claw, which are hollow at the upper side.
Wings 2, equal, 
lateral, oblong, attached by their claws to the receptacle ; 
their upper margins parallel and converging, each termi- 
nating beliiiid in a tooth or spur.

Keel of 1 petal, or more frequently of 2 combined, with 
a double claw, boat-shaped, compressed, with a tooth or 
prominence, on each side, at the base ; either rounded or 
rectangular in front.
All the petals expand in bright wai'm weather, and close 
in darkness, cold, or damp.
Stamens diadelphous.
Filaments 2, lodged in the keel, both 
membranous and flattened, but usually differing in width, 
rarely equal ; 1 embracing the pistil beneath ; the other 
lying upon its upper edge ; the former keeled, divided at 
the summit into 9 slender awl-shaped parts ; the latter 
awl-shaped, simple, slender.
Anthers small, equal, ob-

narrower.
In some instances there is but a single com- 
pressed ioldied Jilament, terminating in 10 equally-divided 
anther-bearing segments, various in length ; m others the 
2 xmec^adX Jilainents are either united or distinct at the 
base.
" The latter only are strictly diadelphous ; but the 
difference is of little moment, and not easily discernible.
Pistil solitary, superior.
Germen sessile or stalked, oblong 
or roundish, compressed, the length of the undivided part 
of the Xovfer Jilameiit, by which it is embraced.
Style ter-

part of the filaments, or longer.
Stigma downy, tei'mi- 
nal or longitudinal, capitate, or linear, or dilated.
Legume oblong or roundish, compressed or inflated ; either 
of 2 continued valves, and 1, rarely imperfectly divided, 
cell, with a longitudinal suture above and below, the 
former bearing a linear double receptacle ; or consisting 
of 1 or more closed, single-seeded joints.
Seeds sevei-al, rarely solitary, roundish, tumid, pendulous, 
on slender alternate stalks, from the upper suture of the 
legume only, where it splits asunder, having one receptacle 
to each valve.
Separate albumen none.
Cotyledons either 
raised above ground in germination, becoming leafy, or 
subterraneous and decaying.
The habit is either herbaceous or shrubby, annual or per- 
ennial.
Wood hard.
Leaves pinnate ; either abruptly, 
with more or less of a tendril ; or with an odd leaflet ; or 
ternate ; or binate ; rarely simple.

Lamarck has suggested that Spartium of Linnaeus is not 
generically distinct from Genista, and he united them in 
his Flore Fraiifoise 614, only referring a few species of 
each tt) Cytisus.
Jussieu avowedly follows him, not with- 
out some doubts, and a suggestion that the single-seeded 
species might properly form a genus by themselves, after 
the opinion of Tournefort, who restricted the name of 
Spartium to these only.
I would rather take as the type 
of this genus our S.
scoparium, and some other species 
which, along with it, make a very natural genus, in cha- 
racter and habit, and from which Linnaeus drew up his 
generic description.
These are clearly distinct from Ge- 
7iista, whatever may be thought of the rest.
Those who 
have studied this natural order well know the importance 
of the stigma and the legume in their generic distinctions.

This, as Dr. Roth justly observes, is in every part but half the size 
of the last.
The branches are more recumbent ; the flowering 
ones more cylindrical and elongated.
Leaves awl-shaped, hairy.
Fl. scarcely half the size of U.
europceus, paler, with a more 
yellow calyx, and narrower standard.
The most essential cha- 
racters however consist in the more distinct and spreading calyx- 
teeth, and the minute, rounded, close-pressed, often hardly dis- 
cernible bracteas.
These marks are conclusive and constant j 
and this species, which blossoms chiefly in autumn, may readily 
be known at a distance from the more common one, however 
starved, or injured by too frequent cutting, the latter may happen 
to be.

Root woody, tough and strong, whence the English name.
Stems 
annual, thougli often considerably woody or shrubby, various 
in length, erect, reclining, or in y quite prostrate ; all round, 
branched, leafy and hairy, each of their principal, as well as 
short lateral, branches often terminating in a straight sharp 
spine, particularly where the soil is poor, or the roots of long 
standing, and this happens frequently even in the maritime va- 
riety y.
Leaves alternate, stalked, elliptical inclining to wedge- 
shaped, dark green, roughish, strongly marked with straight, 
parallel, oblique, lateral ribs ; entire in their lower part ; ser- 
rated with minute teeth towards the extremity j many of the 
lower ones ternate.
Stipulas variable in size, on luxuriant 
plants rather large, ovate, toothed, combined, clasping the stem.
Fl. axillary, mostly solitary, on short stalks, large and hand- 
some, of a brilliant rose-colour.
Cal. hairy ; its teeth perma- 
nent, enlarging as the fruit ripens.
Standard twice the size 
of the wings and keel.
Legume obliquely rhomboid, partly hairy, 
not so long as the calyx.
Seeds rough with minute points.
The 
foliage and calyx are glutinous, and, in the first or more lux- 
uriant variety, have a strong goat-like smell.

Stems 
numerous, spreading or recumbent, 1 to 2 feet long, somewhat 
branched, leafy, angular, more or less hairy, but in this respect 
the whole plant varies greatly.
Leaves of numerous pairs of 
ovate-lanceolate, acute leaflets, whose common footstalk is 
somewhat elongated, but not so as to form a tendril.
Stipulas 
half-arrow-shaped, single-toothed.
Clusters of numerous^owers, 
about as long as the leaves.
Cal. more hairy than the stalks.
Pet. cream-coloured, streaked and tipped witli purple.
Legume 
ovate-oblong, smooth, compressed, much shorter than usual in 
this genus, and very differently shaped.
Seeds few, from 1 to 3, 
dark brown, smooth, almost globular, with a long linear scar, 
but no crest.
/3 is a truly wonderful variety, found by Mr. Todd, gardener to 
the late Mr. Johnes, on a hill near Hafod, Cardiganshire, bear- 
ing nothing but large, ovate, simple leaves, five times the size 
of the usual leaflets, but like them in texture, veins, &c.
Sti- 
pulas rather smaller than usual.
Rabbits are extremely fond 
of this variety, which, when transplanted into the garden, grew 
luxuriantly, increasing greatly by the roots, but could by no ma- 
nagement be made to blossom.
The stems are much more slender 
than in the common state of the plant,

Herb smaller than any variety of the 
former, of a slender delicate habit, and distinguished by its very 
conspicuous, elegant, crimson powers, white at the keel and 
lower edge of the wings, and rather large in proportion to the 
other parts.
The stems, mostly procumbent, are a span long, 
unbranched, slender, striated, smooth.
Tendrils with 2 or 3 
capillary branches.
Stipulas small, but not always narrow, 
smooth, sometimes toothed, their depressed mark rather pale

Leaflets 6 or 7; those of the lower leaves short, 
inversely heart-shaped ; of the upper ones oblong or linear, ab-

German as well as English botanists have so much confounded the 
synonyms of the present plant, with starved varieties of the F.
sat'wa, and even with the more decidedly distinct V.

that their characters have misled me.
The observations of Mr.

That this Vetch grows on Glastonbury Tor-hill, as well as the fol- 
lowing, has been ascertained by Mr. Turner.
Some of its branches are entirely subterraneous, producing co- 
lourless, apparently imperkct, flower-buds, which nevertheless 
form seeds.

among various exotic species of Ficia and Lathyrus.

Much like the preceding, but ratlier taller and more upright, sus-

Root fibrous, annual, though, as Dillenius in Ray's Sytiopsis re- 
cords, after Mr. Doody, it is sometimes propagated by subterra- 
neous lateral granulations, or knobs, in the manner of a potatoe, 
in which case the seeds are abortive.
Similar knobs occur in 
ricia laihyroides, and other papilionaceous plants.
The stems, 
often numerous, are procumbent, from 3 to 10 or 12 inches long, 
furrowed, downy, leafy.
Leaves alternate, of from 5 to 1 or 12 
pair of small, uniform, elliptical leaflets, hairy, especially at the 
back, with a terminal one about the same size and figure.
Sti- 
pulas very small, the upper ones lanceolate or awl-shaped, 
scarcely visible; lower linear, acute, united laterally to the foot- 
stalks.
Fl. 3 or 4 in each little head, or tuft, closely accompa-

Stems several, recumbent, 2 or 3 feet in 
length, round, furrowed, smooth, leafy, not much branched.
Leaves of many pairs of elliptic-oblong, uniform, pointed, entire 
leaflets ; smooth above j often a little hairy beneath ; the termi- 
nal one like the rest.
Stipulas ovate, pointed, entire.
Flower- 
stalks axillary, ascending, longer than the leaves, each bearing 
a dense tapering spike, rather than a cluster, of handsome, va- 
riegated, crimson ^oj/;e7«, with numerous narrow membranous 
bracteas interspersed.
Legumes erect, semiorbicular, hard, bor- 
dered with sharp flat teeth, hairy at the sides, and strongly reti- 
culated with prominent, partly spinous, ribs or veins.
A well-known object of cultivation, as fodder for cattle, on dry, 
barren, especially chalky or marly, ground, in open situations.
It fails where the soil is damp, or the field overshadowed with 
trees.
Having been first introduced to the farmer from France, 
the plant brought its French name of Saint-foin along with it j 
and Cock's-head, by which it was before known, as a native of 
England, is become obsolete.

Linnaeus found Tiifolium, though a most natural genus,

He 
thought it necessary to admit the inflorescence, as " a little 
umbel, or head, with a common receptacle," into his generic 
character; but this is neither correct in principle, nor in 
fact, and I have ventured to discard it.

It is sometimes cultivated for fodder, and if cut before

The seeds, when mixed with

Melilot is out of use in

Root fibrouSj with many small fleshy knobs, like those of Vicia la- 
thyroides.
Stems several, spreading flat on the ground, smooth, 
leafy, mostly simple.
Leajlets inversely heart-shaped, more or 
less serrated, smooth, their partial stalks all equally short.
Sti- 
pulas ovate with long taper points.
Stalks numerous, axillary, 
solitary, each bearing 2 or 3 long, pale reddish, powers, the 
claws of whose petals are slender, and all distinct.
Calyx-teeth 
also very slender, shorter than the oblong, moderately com- 
pressed, obtuse, transversely furrowed, slightly hairy, legume, 
which usually contains 8, Ray says sometimes 10, oval seeds.
This species has certainly as little the character of Melilotus as of 
Trigonella, to both which it has been referred.
It can scarcely, 
without violence, be retained in Trifolium.
The claws of the 
petals are all distinct ; the legume separates into 2 valves, without 
falling, and the seeds are more numerous than in any other of 
the present genus.
Yet nobody has thought fit to make it a 
distinct one, however plausible might be the reasons for such a 
measure.

Roots fibrous.
Stems prostrate, creeping extensively with nume- 
rous radicles, branched chiefly near their origin, round, smooth, 
leafy, internally solid, by which character all the varieties are es- 
sentially distinguished from T.
hyhridum of Linnaeus.
Leaves on 
long upright/oofsto/Ars; lenjiets on short, equal partial-stalks, in- 
versely heart-shaped, or roundish, finely toothed, smooth, dark 
green, variegated, mostly with a pale, curved, transverse stripe, 
sometimes with dark purple, or blackish stains ; the under side 
often reddish.
Floiver-stalks rising above the leaves, erect, or 
ascending, angular, smooth, each bearing a dense, umbellate, 
fldttish head of numerous white^ow;ers, turning brown as they 
fade, the corolla remaining long in a withered state, enclosing 
the little smooth oblong legume, containing 3 or 4 yellowish 
seeds, till they fall off together.
In a rich moist soil the stems grow more upright, and the whole 
herb is more luxuriant.
Such a shape it usually assumes in low 
ground, newly broken up, where this Trefoil is one of the first 
spontaneous productions.
As a valuable fodder in dry autumnal 
months, it is well known, making an excellent bottom in pas- 
tures.

noticed by English botanists j so that when found in a culti-

thought a new species, but proved on comparison the T.

T. ochroleucum has not been turned to any agricultural use, nor 
does it appear to possess any valuable properties.
The herbage 
is very sparing, and not lasting.
I suspect the plant to be an-

preserve it in his garden.

In general appearance this is very like the last species, but its qua- 
lities are widely different, though for some purposes, according 
to Mr. Sinclair, not inferior.
Mr. Afzelius, in his most elabo- 
rate paper in the Linnsean Transactions, has clearly distinguish- 
ed them.
The root of the present plant is creeping and more 
uniformly perennial in cultivation.
The stems are zigzag, and 
more branched.
Stipulas longer, linear, tapering to a point, 
and stand parallel to each other.
Heads of Jlowers rather larger 
and less dense.
Cal. slightly hairy, except in the mouth ; its 
2 upper teeth shortest ; the rest gradually, but not very strik- 
ingly, longer.
Leaflets elliptical, various in width, a little glau- 
cous underneath, chiefly hairy at the margin.
The best properties of the present kind of Clover, or Trefoil, seem 
to be its power of resisting drought, and its thriving on cold te- 
nacious soils.
Yet Mr. Sinclair reports it to be preferable to 
T. pratense for permanent pasture on light soils.
Its produce 
of nutritious matter however is said to be but half as much as 
that of T.
pratense.

Herb clothed with fine, soft, more or less spread-

Stems spreading, often recumbent, a foot or more

Leaves alternate, except the uppermost pair ; the lower ones on 
long slender /oo^stoZ/cs ; leaflets dark green, of a narrow obovate 
figure J obtuse, or notched, obscurely toothed towards the ex- 
tremity, single-ribbed, hairy on both sides.
Stipulas very long, 
narrow, straight, taper-pointed, hairy.
Spikes terminal, stalk- 
ed, solitary, short, almost globular.
Calyx with 10 strong ribs, 
and deep intermediate furrows, hairy chiefly at the summit of 
the tube ; its sharp teeth at first erect, awl-shaped, a little un- 
equal, shorter than the corolla, becoming after flowering much 
enlarged, leafy, three-ribbed, dark green, spreading, and still 
more unequal, the lower one largest.
Pet. pale red ; standard 
a little the longest.
Legume thin, roundish, in the tube of the 
calyx.
Seed, as far as I have seen, always solitary, roundish, 
brown, protuberant at one edge where the radicle is lodged.
This is one of that tribe of Trefoils distinguished by the teeth of 
the calyx becoming remarkably leafy, and much dilated, as the 
Jlower fades, and the seed ripens.
In this it agrees with the fol- 
lowing, but difl'ers from pratense and its allies, as well as from 
arvense, whose teeth, though permanent and rigid, do not become   
leafy or dilated.
T. maritimum makes a part of the food of cattle 
in its native marshes, but has not been cultivated, or particu- 
larly noticed, by the farmer.

Pet. white, or pale pink, their claws scarcely combined ; 
standard broad, ovate.
Legume minute, membranous, with a

Sometimes very dwarfish, and densely silky, on barren sands near

Having rudiments of 2 seeds in the

prostrate, very slender, 3 or 4 inches long, sometimes 10 
or 12, much branched at the bottom.
Leaflets small, inversely 
heart-shaped, toothed.
Common footstalks very short, scarcely 
a quarter so long as the leaflets ; partial ones still shorter, all 
nearly equal and uniform, that of the middle leaflet not being, 
as in the last species, an apparent continuation or elongation 
of the common stalk.
Sfipulas small, ovate, membranous, some-

finally pendulous.
Teeth of the calyx rather less unequal than 
in T.

Engl.

Legume obovate, scarcely covered 
by the withered corolla, which turns pale in that state, and the 
standard is perfectly even.

This species is clearly and most scientifically distinguished from

Bot. sect.
279, 
prefers to every other part for sound specific difl'erences.
He 
has adverted to the " manifest and distinct" partial flower-stalks 
of T.
filiforme in his Sp. PL, which in fact render the inflores- 
cence of this plant a racemus, not, as in the foregoing, a spica or 
capilulum.
Haller in his Iter Helveticum, sect.
13, highly extols 
Dillenius for ascertaining these two species ; and yet in his 
Historia, under n.
364, he records thatDillenius found the seeds 
of T.^^j/brwie produced n.
363, our procumbens.
This proves too 
much, and oversets all the authority of the relator.
Yet the 
great Oxford Professor is the first who clearly discriminated the 
three species which form our 5th section, and his figures of the 
two latter preclude all doubt as to what he meant.
Linnseus 
seems to have considered our ininus as a variety ol procumbens ; 
his pupil Ehrhart referred it to fifforme.
I have, too heedlessly, 
been led into the latter error in the second volume of FL Br.
; 
but the accurate inquiries of the Rev. Dr.
Beeke, now Dean of 
Bristol, enabled me to correct my mistake, in the third volume.
This gentleman favoured me with specimens of the plants in

minus, with its succulent brittle stem, retained all its diversity of 
habit, and remained constant when propagated by seed.
Still 
there is no positive specific character.
Cattle and sheep are so 
fond of this variety, that it can scarcely be gathered in any 
pastures to which they have access.
I have not heard the result 
of the experiments made upon it for cultivation.

Perennial.' July, August.
Very different from the foregoing .s,pecies in general habit, and now 
technically distinguished by several clear and sufficient charac- 
ters, for most of which I am indebted to the worthy Dean of 
Bristol.
Every botanist had been struck with the aspect of the 
plant, and Scopoli long ago proposed it as a species, but without 
a sufficient specific definition, except that of the shorter separate 
filaments not being, like the longer ones, dilated under their an- 
thers.
The stems are from 1 to 2 or 3 feet high, upright, clothed, 
more or less, with long loosely-spreading hairs, rarely quite 
smooth ; internally hollow, or tubular, with little or no pith in 
any part, which I take to be an important character.
Leaiies 
fringed or clothed with similar hairs.
Fl. fi'om C to 1 2 in each 
head, of a duller orange than the former.
Calyx-teeth stellated 
in an early state ; their mterstices, when fully expanded, acutan- 
gular, not rounded.
Claw of the standard almost linear, though 
vaulted.
Legumes not horizontal, but drooping, slender and 
exactly cylindrical.
Whether there may be any difference in the agricultural qualities of 
these plants, and whether the present might be capable of culti- 
vation in very wet meadows, nobody has hitherto inquired.

A Montpellier specimen of this plant from Sauvages, bearing the 
synonym of C.
Bauhin, is the original authority for L.
angustis- 
simus.
To this Linnseus had pinned a nearly smooth one of tlie 
last species, which Solander in the Banksian herbarium has taken 
for the true angustissimus, calling our present plant L.
diffusus, 
and this great authority misled me.
A scrutiny of the Linnaean 
specimens, and their marks, with the descriptions, synonyms, 
and history of L.
angustissimus, have satisfied me that this is our 
diffusus; and it is never too late to correct a manifest error, 
especially as the original name is much the best.

Lucerne has often been recommended for fodder, or for hay ; its

Root long and woody.
Habit like the preceding, but the nume-

Leaves 
and stipulas much like M.
sativa.
The clusters are usually 
shorter and more dense, but this varies according to exposure 
or luxuriance.
Fl. generally pale yellow, but occasionally vio- 
let, and more frequently green, evidently from a combination of 
these two colours.
Legumes black, downy, sickle-shaped, not 
twisted into a screw, as in the sativa.
Seeds from 4 to 8, kid- 
ney-shaped, yellowish.
The growing germen liberates itself 
with a spring from the keel, by which the pollen is dashed about 
the stigma by the time the rudiments of the seeds are perfected.
This species is perhaps as good fodder as Lucerne, though less 
succulent, and from its position less accessible to the scythe.

The

except at the bottom.
Leaflets roundish-obovate, or rhomboid,

Legumes kid-

of a spiral structure ; finally black, sometimes slightly downy.
Seed kidney-shaped, solitary.
One of the most valuable of artificial grasses, affording excellent 
fodder for sheep.

The references in Ray's Synop-

By the description of

Legumes orbicular, depressed, smaller than a pea, with several

with two rows of long, spreading, slender, weak, partly hooked, 
bristles, the whole, when ripe, brown, not black.

This has been mentioned, but not much recommended, as a fodder

I have specimens gathered by the Rev. Mr.
Bryant at Cley, Nor- 
folk, which may possibly be the variety /3.
They agree exactly 
with the figure of Lobel above cited, but Dillenius in his blind 
account of this plant, taken from Plukenet, does not advert to 
that figure.
The spines of the legvmes are shorter and more 
rigid than in our common M.

In groves, thickets, and hedges, abundantly.

July, August.
Root woody, tufted, somewhat creeping.
Stem taller than the last, 
and much more bushy, in consequence of tlie much greater 
length of its axillary leafy branches ; its form round, with only 
2 opposite ribs or angles, not so acute as those of H.
quadran- 
gulum.
The whole herb is moreover of a darker green, with a 
more powerful scent when rubbed, staining the fingers with 
dark purple, from the greater abundance of coloured essential 
oil, lodged in the herbage and even in the petals.
Leaves very 
numerous, smaller than the last, elliptical or ovate, obtuse, va- 
rious in width.
Fl. bright yellow, dotted and streaked with 
black, or dark purple, numerous, in dense, forked, terminal pa.
nicies.

As this plant was found to bleed at the slightest touch, it was sup- 
posed to have a vulnerary quality, and became the "balm of the 
warriors wound," giving a blood-red colour to every composi- 
tion, whether of a spiritous or oily nature, into which it entered.
The essential oil, the seat of this colour, is aromatic, and pos- 
sibly tonic or stimulating, without much acrimony.

Perennial, June, July.
Root branching at the crown, sending up several erect stems, which 
are about 2 feet high, straight, round, leafy, panicled at the top, 
with or without short axillary branches, and clothed, like the 
foliage and stalks, with short downy hairiness, very soft to the 
touch.
Leaves sessile, ovate, bluntish, furnished with pellucid 
dots, intermixed with a few dark ones ; paler and most downy 
beneath, with many lateral ribs.
Fl. very numerous, of a uni- 
form bright yellow, about the size of H.

Segments 
of the calyx lanceolate, ribbed, smooth, fringed, like the brac- 
teas, with numerous black viscid glands on shortish stalks, such 
as also terminate the petals.
Caps, smooth and even.
The Ascyrum of the old herbalists appears, by their representation 
of the calyx, to be this plant, and notH.quadrangulum, to which 
last some of their synonyms have been referred.
If, instead of 
copying, from Dioscorides and each other, various futile accounts 
which afford no information, they had plainly told us whether 
their plant were smooth or downy, with a round or four-wing- 
' ed stem, all would have been clear and satisfactory.

Leaves firm and rigid, sessile, often deflexed, 
heart-shaped, or ovate, short, convex ; dark green, with a glau- 
cous tinge, above ; paler beneath ; the lower ones soon be- 
coming yellow, or more frequently bright red, which combined 
with the'golden^oujers, tipped externally with scarlet, and the 
red anthers, gives the plant a peculiarly gay aspect, rendering 
it worthy of the appellation of pulchrum, adopted originally by 
the venerable Tragus.
The segments of the calyx are ovate, 
and their black glandular fringes, like those of the petals, add 
also to the beauty of the Jlotvers.
The capsule is ovate, smooth 
and even.

Common Calyx inferior, containing nuiTierous^o;f/5, seated 
on a common receptacle.
It contracts after flowering, but 
becomes reflexed, in general, when the seeds are ripe.
It 
is either simple, consisting of a single row of scales en- 
compassing the florets ; or imbricated, when the nume- 
rous scales lie one over another, the outer ones being 
gradually smaller ; or double, when one row of equal 
scales, united at the base, surrounds the florets, and is 
accompanied bj' a much smaller external set of scales at 
the bottom, often of a very different texture, habit, or 
duration from the inner and larger ones.
Compound Flower consisting of various descriptions oi Jlo- 
rets, each monopetalous, very rarely wanting the corolla 
entirely, but various as to stamens, pistil, or seed.
1. Liigulate Florets, tubular at the base ; ligulate, or strap- 
shaped, and unilateral, in the limb ; furnisheil with both 
stamens and pistil, or only with the latter, in a more or 
less perfect state.
2. Tubular Florets, cylindrical, with a regular equal limb, 
almost invariably S-cleft ; furnished generally with sta- 
mens and pistil, and usually producing perfect seed.
3. Neuter Florets, funnel-shaped, spreading upwards, with- 
out stamens or style, mostly irregular, entirely inefficient.
Nectary altogether wanting, the honey lodged in each flo- 
ret being, apparently, secreted by the tube of its corolla.
Stamens 5, very rarely or accidentally 4 only ; filaments ca- 
pillary, from the mouth of the tube of each floret, equal, 
sometimes irritable.
Anthers vertical, linear-oblong, 
united laterally into a cylinder, very rarely separate, per- 
manent.
Germen, with respect to its floret, inferior, simple, often 
crowned with a partial calyx, which becomes the crown, 
border, or dow)i of the seed.
iS^^/Ze solitary, thread-shaped, 
about the length of the corolla.
Stigma simple, or cloven, 
sometimes thickened, and in that case less perfect, or to- 
tally ineflicient.
Seed-vessel none, the commo7i calyx serving to shelter the 
seeds till ripe, and then spreading widely, especially in 
dry weather, to let them escape.
Seed one to each floret, sometimes a mere rudiment; when 
perfect oblong, or obovate, angular or compressed ; ei- 
ther simple and naked at the summit ; or crowned witJi 
an elevated, entire or lobed, border ; or with seed.-dow?i, 
consisting of simple, usually rough, hairs ; or of feathery

open chiefly in a morning.

54, have 
tubular^ojr/s only, regular when perfect, but sometimes 
neuter and irregular.

and red or purple j?ot»£';-.';.
CorymhifercB, Juss.
65, have 
tubular j?or<?/s in the disk, which is usually yellow, some- 
times white ; and ligulate ones in the radius or circum- 
ference, various in colour.
Leaves in some opposite.
Flo- 
rets variable as to their degree of perfection.
Qualities 
various, but generally not noxious.
For irregularities and exceptions, which are very few, and 
chiefly concern exotic plants, see Grammar.
Some recent botanists of the French school, rejecting the 
idea of a compound Jlower, have given the name of invo- 
lucrum to what has hitherto been denominated by Jus- 
sieu, as well as Linnaeus, a cominon calyx.
I cannot sub- 
scribe to the theory, nor to the alteration founded upon 
it ; nor can I deny these plants a naked seed, any more 
than the umbelliferous tribe, the grasses, or the Didvna- 
mia Gymnospermia.
The student may judge for himself; 
but if he enters prematurely into such speculations, he will 
soon find himself bewildered in a labyrinth of doubts and 
theories.
It will be still worse if, by neglecting the prac- 
tical study of nature, and adopting innovations, which 
are generally long-exploded fancies in a new form, he 
throws away his clue, and follows blindfold, while he 
imagines he is taking the lead.

Mr. G.
Don.
Perennial.
July, August.
Root tuberous and woody, slightly creeping.
Stems upright, a 
yard high, round, simple, leafy, furrowed ; smooth in the lower 
part ; besprinkled above with prominent, brown, glandular, viscid 
hairs.
Leaves smooth, pliant, variou-sly lyrate ; arrow-shaped 
at the base, with a -winged footstalk ; their terminal lobe large, 
triangular, somewhat toothed j their under side a little glaucous.
Fl. large, numerous, and handsome, of a fine blue, composing a 
simple, terminal cluster, whose stalks, as well as the linear brac- 
teas, and the calyx, are clothed with copious, brown, glutinous, 
bristly hairs.

Wallis, by a strange mistake in his History of Northumberland, 
was the cause of this fine alpine plant being reckoned by Hud- 
son a native of Britain ; but what Wallis took for it is the Ci~ 
chorium Intybus.
The Blue Sow-thistle however remains on our 
list, having been discovered in the Highlands by the late Mr.
Don. It abounds on the principal mountains of Europe, from 
Lapland to Switzerland.
Some botanists contend that this is 
the real S.
alpinus of Linnaeus, and the accurate Dr. Wahlen- 
berg declares it to be the Lapland plant so denominated ; what 
is preserved under that name in the Linnaean herbarium, and 
figured in Sm. Plant.
Ic. t.2\, not being known to him as a 
native of Lapland.
This last species however alone answers to 
the character in the Sp. Plantarum, and cannot but remain as 
the real S.
alpinus.
All ambiguity is avoided by retaining the 
old appellation of ceeruleus for our plant.

Perennial.
July, August.
One of our largest herbaceous plants, being from 6 to 8 feet high.
Root fleshy, branching, not creeping, by which, as Mr. Curtis 
very correctly observes^ it differs essentially from the following 
more common species ; the whole herb being moreover twice 
or thrice as large, though ihe^owers are smaller, and usually a 
little paler.
Stem cylindrical, though angular and furrowed, 
scarcely branched, leafy, hollow, with many transverse internal 
partitions.
Leaves large, deeply pinnatifid, smooth, except at 
the edges, where they are fringed with copious, short, rigid, 
bristly hairs ; their lobes narrow, acute, for the most part di- 
rected downwards ; the uppermost leaves simply hastate, ses- 
sile, linear, serrated.
Panicles terminal, umbellate or cymose, 
their stalks rough with black, bristly, glandular hairs, as is like- 
wise the calyx.
Cor. lemon-coloured.
-Seeds furrowed.
Down 
simple, smooth.
Haller only guessed this to be a variety of S.
arvensis, without 
having compared them ; a rather rash mode of judging, calcu- 
lated to mislead all who practise it,

In cultivated and waste ground every where.
Annual.
July — September.
Root tapering, milky and bitter like the whole herb, which as- 
sumes a number of diflFerent but evanescent forms, insomuch 
that the several varieties, depending on richness or poverty of 
soil, can hardly be traced with any certainly.
Ray doubted 
whether any of them were species or not.
Hill persuaded Hal- 
ler that the prickly varieties constituted a distinct species from 
the smooth ones ; but this opinion is not confirmed by obser- 
vation or experience.
The stem in all, except very poor spe- 
cimens, is branched, erect, round, smooth, hollow, leafy, very 
brittle.
Leaves smooth on both sides, variously pinnatifid, or 
runcinate, toothed, sometimes very prickly at the edges, the 
terminal lobe generally large and triangular j in s and g", starved 
varieties, they are undivided.
Flower-stalks cymose, axillary 
and terminal, clothed, more especially near the flowers, with a 
peculiarly soft, white, cottony web, which after a while falls off, 
leaving them smooth and naked.
Bracteas few, lanceolate, partly 
toothed.
Cal. smooth, glaucous.
Cor. pale yellow, closing at 
night, and in bad weather ; reported to be sometimes white, 
but this I have never seen.
Seeds angular, furrowed and finely 
notched.
Down copious, smooth, very white and silky.
Dr. Withering mentions a maritime variety without a stem, found 
on Portland island.
Hares and rabbits are very fond of this herb.

August, September.
Whole herb abounding with an acrid fetid milky juice, having the 
smell and narcotic properties of Opium.
This juice springs out 
suddenly, in large drops, on the slightest touch, from the calyx 
and tender leaves, evincing a considerable degree of irritability 
in the plant.
The root is tap-shaped.
Stem solitary, 2 or 3 feet 
high, erect, round, smooth, sparingly leafy, scarcely branched ; 
panicled at the top ; a little prickly below.
Leaves horizontal, 
nearly smooth, finely toothed ; radical ones numerous, obovate, 
undivided, depressed ; those of the stem smaller, often lobed ; 
arrow-shaped and clasping at their base ; the mid-rib of all more 
or less beset underneath with prominent prickles, such as often 
occur on the margin also.
Fl. numerous, panicled, with abun-

Respect for Ray and Gerarde may lead us to suppose our /3 differs 
in some degree from the plant in its ordinary state, with which 
Ray says it is found, though rarely.
Its scent is reported to be 
milder.
Gerai'de cites the above synonyms of Tragus and Dale- 
champ for this variety ; but neither their figures, nor Petiver's 
f. 1, indicate any thing but the most common appearance of the 
leaves, which are liable, on the same plant, to be wavy or 
slightly lobed ; a difference which cannot be attended with any 
change of quality.
Ray, and Dillenius who merely copies him, 
mention this variety as if it belonged to L.
Scanola; but Gerarde 
certainly takes it for L.
virosa.
C. Bauhin confounds some of 
its synonyms with the following.

Perennial.
April — July.
Root tap-shaped, very milky, externally black, difficult of extirpa- 
tion, ieares numerous, spreading, of a bright shining green, 
quite smooth, tapering downwards, sessile, pinnatifid, witii sharp, 
unequally toothed lobes, pointing downward, or, in botanical 
language, runcinate, of which these leaves are a perfect example.
They may also be called lion-toothed.
Flower-stalks one or 
more, rather longer than the leaves, erect, very smooth, brittle, 
quite naked.
Fl. 1^ inch wide, of a uniform golden yellow, ex- 
panded in the morning and in fine weather only.
Outer scales 
of the calyx several, lineiu-oblong, loosely recurved and wavy.
As the seeds ripen, the inner calyx becomes reflexed close to the 
stalk, leaving the light globe, near 2 inches in diameter, formed 
by their radiating down, quite exposed, lill dispersed by the 
wind.
By culture, and especially by blanching, this herb, though, like the 
garden Lettuce and Endive, originally fullof bitter milk, becomes 
sufficiently mild to be eaten in a salad, nor is its bitterness of a 
disagreeable kind.
It is reported to be powerfully diuretic.
/3 fs much smaller in every part than usual, the segments of the 
leaves being deep and very narrow, but the calyx scales retain 
their due proportion and posit'on.
Some botanists appear to 
confound this variety with the following species, but the latter is 
naturally quite a bog plant; whereas the Common Dandelion 
350 SYNGENESIA— POLYGAMIA-i^QU.

becomes diminutive from drought and starvation only, retaining, 
in every state, the proper character of its calyx.

Rather smaller than the general size of the foregoing, from which 
it is doubtless very distinct.
The leaves are less runcinate than 
in any of its most starved varieties, and are frequently besprin- 
kled, or fringed, with longish hairs ; sometimes however they 
are quite smooth.
Outer calyx constantly and essentially dif- 
ferent from every variety of the last, consisting of ovate, pointed 
scales, regularly imbricated and erect, or close-pressed, the inner 
ones gradually longest, and full half the length of the inner ca- 
lyx.
In seed all the scales are reflexed, like the former.
Cor.
bright yellow ; the external_^ore/s striated or stained underneatli

The Rev. Mr.
Hemsted has found this species undergo no change

The exotic A.

affords a clear distinction.

May — July.
Root rather woody, throwing out many long, creeping, leafy scions.
Leaves spreading, elliptic-oblong, tapering at the base, entire ; 
numerous at the root ; smaller and alternate on the scions ; 
their upper surface green and smooth, besprinkled with long 
coarse hairs, such as are found on every part of the herbage ; 
their backs densely covered with white cottony pubescence.
After drying these hairs become tawny.
Stalks generally soli- 
tary, erect, a finger's length, round, downy and hairy, destitute 
of leaves and bracteas, each bearing a solitary^oioer, of a most 
elegant pale lemon-colour, with a red central stripe at the back 
of each ^ore^ Cal. rough with black hairs, intermixed with white 
' ones ; its inner scales membranous.
Seed-down rough with very 
minute teeth.
The receptacle is clothed with short bristles, a 
slight deviation from the proper generic character, of which there 
are other examples.
Old authors esteem the Pilosella powerfully astringent, and assert 
it to be noxious, on that account, to sheep, while they recom- 
mend it for the cure of wounds, and of internal weaknesses.
We might place some confidence in their prescriptions, if they 
did not at the same time declare that the juice of the herb, used 
for tempering steel, renders it capable of cutting stone and iron, 
such a property, as founded on the astringency of the herb, 
being purely hypothetical, if not evidently incredible.

Larger than the last, but of a similar habit, though the herbage is 
far less hairy, and there is no cottony down about the plant, 
e.xcept a small quantity on the Jlower-stalks.
The leaves are 
glaucous underneath, tapering, and fringed with coarse hairs, at 
the base.
Stalks solitary, beset with scattered glandular hairs, 
and bearing 3 or 4 corymbose, or imperfectly umbellate,^oj«ers, 
whose partial stalks, like the calyx, are downy, with short black 
glandular bristles interspersed.
Cor. smaller than the preceding,

The most uncertain plant perhaps in our whole British catalogue, 
whose place in the English Flora depends on Mr. Hudson's au- 
thority alone, for no other person has met with any thing in 
Britain answering to his description, which is as follows.
"Root abrupt, with numerous simple radicles.
Scions creeping.

leafy.
Stalk radical, erect, naked, somewhat hairy, with scat- 
tered hairs, its height scarcely six inches.
Leaves lanceolate, 
nearly entire, acute, naked.
Fl. panicled, from 3 to 6, yellow.
Calyx-leaves linear, hairy." 
As Mr. Hudson knew, and lias clearly described, H.
chtbium, we 
cannot but presume his H.
Auricula to have been something 
different.
He quotes Haller's n.
52, with synonyms of Columna 
and C.
Bauhin copied from that author, but these do not agree 
so well with the Linnaean plant as the above description, which, 
except the " naked leaves," answers perfectly to the true H.
Au- 
ricula, figured, from foreign dried specimens, in Engl.
Bof. This 
cannot be mistaken if it should ever be met with in Britain.
It 
is a native of very lofty mountains, near the glaciers of Switzer- 
land and Savoy, and is most assuredly no variety of H.
dubium.
The leaves are green on both sides, more or less hairy, truly lan- 
ceolate and acute ; the scio7is short ; flower-stalk clothed with 
white down, intermixed with black glandular hairs ; partiol 
stalks more densely downy, with a few scattered, hairy, awl- 
shaped bracteas.
Cal. more or less clothed with long, black and 
tawny, shaggy hairs.
Cor. full yellow, inclining to orange.

The great difficulty of the subject, and the many errors of the most

time confounded this very distinct species with the preceding or

taller, more erect and straight stem than the last, bearing several 
scattered, nearly sessile, leaves, and more amply and decidedly 
hollow.
The hairy leaves are longer, ovate-lanceolate^ not at all 
heart-shaped, but rather tapering at the base ; their usually 
strong, deep, distinct teeth all pointing forward, not backward j 
their colour dark green above, more or less speckled with black, 
or dark purple ; the under side paler ; radical ones on long 
hairy footstalks.
The Jlower-stalks are numerous, clothed, like 
the calyx, with short, dense, rather cottony, down, intermixed 
with short, black, glandular bristles, and they form an irregular, 
sometimes compound, cymose ]>anicle, bearing several scattered,

Stems one

two, or three sessile oblong leaves, and terminating in from one 
to four bristly and downy, slightly bracteated, alternate, elon- 
gated Jlower-stalks, each supporting a very large and handsome 
lemon-coloured j?o«;er-, whose calyx is clothed with short, tawny, 
as well as blackish, hairs.
The leaves are chiefly radical, on long 
d\\AieA footstalks , elliptical, acute at each end, much extended 
at the base, where they are copiously hairy ; their margins ge-

This is a most distinct species, propagating itself plentifully by

Mr. Davall found this species in Switzerland, but he did not, like 
Willdenow, confound it with Haller's ?i.47,Willdenow's integri- 
folium, under which this author also quotes Haller's 47.
The 
latter is a most distinct species, perfectly smooth, glaucous, well 
compared by Haller to a Bupleurum, and resembling also some 
of the smooth species of Solidago.
The leaves are lanceolate'; 
those of the stem numerous, narrow, taper-pointed, quite en- 
tire, sessile, hardly clasping.
Stem round, strongly furrowed, 
perfectly solid, not tubular, a character too much overlooked by 
authors who have attempted to discriminate the species of Hie- 
racium.
Thejlowers are nearly twice the size of H.

Calyx 
very slightly hairy, cottony at the base, like the summit of each

of the stem, but much smaller.

Stem l^- 
or 2 feet high, erect, stout, cylindrical, with several slight an- 
gles, smooth, or nearly so, quite solid, corymbose, leafy.
Ra- 
dical leaves on long, flat, \evy shaggy footstalks, elliptic-oblong, 
or obovate, from 3 to 5 inches in length, acute, sometimes ob- 
tuse, either nearly entire, or beset with small distant teeth, the 
surface besprinkled with dots, a little like those of Cerinthe, but 
these are often very slight, and the long hairs which accompany 
them are variable in quantity ; stem-leaves sessile, ovate, entire, 
taper-pointed, fringed, gradually diminished to copious leafy 
bracteas on the rough stalks of the panicle.
Fl. rather large, 
pale yellow, on bristly glandular stalks.
Cal. covered with 
shaggy, but short, hairs.
Seeds furrowed, dark brown.

Our plant is certainly that of Linnaeus, and apparently of DeCan- 
doile.
It accords well with Gouan's plate, but not with that of 
Villars, nor with specimens from Dauphiny, which yet may pos- 
sibly be but varieties of the same species.

near 2 inches wide when fully expanded, lemon-coloured.
Leaves 
elliptic-oblong, acute, wavy, with shallow unequal teeth, a little 
glaucous, and, like the stem and calyx, remarkable for their 
clothing of long, shaggy, hoary haii's, which become tawny by 
keeping.
These copious long hairs, and the large lemon-co-

The seeds are chesnut-coloured, more angular 
than striated, with a very smooth surface.

This species, in its usual state, is very distinct, and readily known.
The stents, though annual, have a shrubby aspect, and are far 
more abundantly leafy than any of the preceding.
They are 2 or 
3 feet, or more, in height, erect, wand-like, stout, roundish, fur- 
rovved, obscurely angular, rough to the touch, nearly filled with 
pith, though somewhat tubular in the upper part, which is 
branched and panlcled ; the lower most hairy.
Leaves alternate, 
almost or quite sessile, and partly clasping the stem, 1| or 2 
inches long, ovate or lanceolate, pointed, rough-edged, sharply 
and regularly toothed ; dark green and almost smooth above j 
paler, somewhat glaucous, and hairy or rough, beneath j the 
lower ones elliptical, lengthened out at their base.
Fl. nume- 
rous, full yellow, open in the forenoon only, like most of this 
tribe, on corymbose, hairy or downy, stalks, forming a variously 
compound, often cymose, panicle, accompanied by many small, 
ovate, leafy bracleas.

A

certain evidence, nor can I clearly define it as a species.
It is

Leaves twice the size of the preceding,

rougher than any other part.
Fl. bright yellow, not an inch

Several doubtful or imperfect specimens of Hieracium, sent from 
Scotland by the late indefatigable and sagacious Mr. George 
Don, lead me to concur in the wishes of my friend Dr. Hooker, 
that an accurate examination of this difficult genus, on its native 
mountains, might be undertaken by competent practical bota- 
nists.
One of these specimens leads me to doubt whether it 
may not have been mistaken for H.
amplexicaule, a species which, 
without more information, I scruple here to admit.
Whoever 
wishes to render himself master of this subject should have 
abundant leisure and patience, to investigate each wild species 
in different soils and situations, and to cultivate each under his 
own continual inspection.
They might then, by a good botanist, 
be probably cleared up without much uncertainty.

truly that of a Crepis, the scales composing the outer one small,

acquiring, as the seed ripens, a strong, hard, rounded, prominent 
mid-rib, which last is a peculiar character.
Florets downy ex-

Seed slender, finely striated, beaked.
Down rough, 
sessile on the summit of the beak, and wanting a real stalk; 
but it seems to me that, as the stalk varies in length in several 
species, this part is of less weight in the generic character than 
the calyx, which is so peculiar.
The florets being rather nume- 
rous, in several rows, agree too ill with the essential and very - 
peculiar character of Prenanthes.
The receptacle is small,

Herb milky and bitter, extremely variable in luxuriance, of a bright

Stems numerous, 
hollow, smooth ; the first or central one simple, straight, leaf- 
less, bearing a solitary flower ; the rest rather spreading, or 
partly recumbent, branched, wavy, slightly leafy, from 6 to 12 
or 1 8 inches high.
Leaves numerous at the root, oblong, or 
tongue-shaped, deeply toothed, or slightly sinuated, occasion- 
ally fringed or partially hairy ; those on the stem smaller, alter- 
nate, sessile.
Fl. on terminal stalks, solitary, small, bright yel- 
low, open in the morning only.
Cal. slender, smooth, glaucous 
or purplish ; the scales flat, regularly imbricated, finally re- 
flexed.
Seeds slender, dark brown, finely striated, rough like the 
down and its stalk, which latter part is wanting in those of the 
circumference.
Scales of the receptacle very thin and membra- 
nous, with taper points on a level with the seed-down, deciduous.
Haller long overlooked this species in Switzerland, nor was it at 
all well known to British botanists till Mr. Curtis's excellent 
figure and description appeared.
In the early part of the day, 
turnip fields are visibly bespangled with its bright blossoms ; 
but after they close it is less readily observable.
The synonym 
of Columna, though cited by Ray, has been generally neglected.

In pastures and waste ground every where.
Root brown externally, tapering, running deep into the ground j 
internally white and milky.
Stems several, branched, spread- 
ing, round, smooth, rather glaucous, about a foot high, hollow, 
without leaves, except the small lanceolate scales, solitary un- 
der each branch, might so be called } but they rather resemble 
bracteas, and were it not for the close analogy of the last spe- 
cieSj whose stems are in part truly leafy, the present might be 
thought to have only radical flower-stalks.
The proper leaves 
are numerous at the root, pressed close to the earth, choking 
all plants within their reach, oblong, bluntish, runcinate, rough 
with rigid hairs.
Fl. large, bright yellow, solitary on terminal, 
hollow, swelling stalks, clothed with small, scattered, close, awl-

Stalks several, more or less branched and swelling above ; slen-

hollow, tumid partial-stalks, each bearing a small, bright, yet 
not full yellow,^0M;er.
Cal. smooth ; its scales all linear, point-

Seeds an- 
gular, smooth, each crowned with an elevated border, as ex- 
pressed in Engl.
Bot. and well magnified by Gsertner, though 
less obvious in Dr. Hooker's otherwise excellent plate.
The re.
ceptacle is smooth, slightly cellular.
Dr. Hooker justly adverts to an erroneous passage in Engl.
Bot., 
" seeds crowned with an elevated rim, more rarely with short 
simple down." The first part of this sentence is correct; the 
latter originated in the generic character given by LinnEeus, ap- 
plied by him to the present plant, in consequence of a mistaken 
specimen in his herbarium, whose origin I cannot trace, but 
which he marked minima, affixing it to an authentic one.
The 
description in Fl. Brit, is nevertheless accurate.

FL axillary, either sessile or stalked, generally globose, with 
little or no wooUiness about the calux ; in y encompassed with 
a few small leaves ; in S said to be rather ovate, not larger than 
filberds.
Florets, with their anthers and stigmas, purple.
The 
calyx, when in seed, easily breaks from its stalk, and is well 
known by the name of a Bur, sticking to the coats of animals, 
and the hair or clothing of young rustics, which can hardly be 
cleared of such incumbrances without breaking the scales 
asunder and scattering the seeds.
The surface of the herbage leaves a slightly viscid, very bitter, 
exudation on the fingers.
The plant itself, a very cumbrous 
weed,- is removed, the first year of its growtii, by stubbing, like 
other things comprehended by fiirmers under the name of docks^ 
and paid for accordingly to the weeder.

Seed-down shorter than the Jiorets, bristly, unequal, yellowish,

This plant gives a yellow colour to wool, for which purpose Lin- 
naeus says it is much used in Sweden.
Haller records, on the 
authority of some foreign writers, that the above colour, fixed 
by means of alum, is both beautiful and permanent, and with 
the addition of blue, makes a better green than either Reseda 
Luteola, or Genista tinctoria, for dyeing wool or silk.
The Rev. R.
Bree, Mr. R.
Brown and the late Mr. T.
Smith have 
observed the flowers of this species to be in effect dioecious, 
those on one plant having imperfect anthers, those on another 
abortive stigmas.

being evidently feathery, not merely rough.
Some spe- 
cies are, as in Carduus, imperfectly dioecious, ^ther ac- 
cidentally or constantly.
Perhaps these two genera ought 
to be united, the distinction above mentioned being of 
no more real importance than in Serratula, where it is 
not regarded.
But the great number of species in Car- 
duus and Cnicus makes it commodious to separate them, 
even by an artificial character, which in itself is easy and 
obvious.

Root tapering, not creeping.
Stem 3 or 4 feet high, eredt/leafy, 
angular, furrowed, not winged ; more or less branched and pa- 
nicled at the top.
Leaves rather deeply pinnatifid, with partly 
palmate, spreading lobes, tipped and fringed with rather small 
spines ; the lowermost tapering at the base, and hairy or downy 
on both sides ; those about the middle of the stem decurrent to 
a small extent, cottony beneath ; uppermost gradually smaller 
and narrower, oblong, undivided, heart-shaped and clasping at 
the base.
Fl. 2 or 3 together at the end of each branch, on 
downy stalks, erect, rather larger than the preceding, and of a 
fine deep crimson.
Cal. ovate, beset with a small portion of 
loose deciduous web ; outer scales spinous, with downy edges, 
like the last ; inner tapering to a long, narrow, coloured point.
Seed-down delicately feathery.
The fructification of this plant most accords with that of the two 
last species ; while the herbage and habit approach some of the 
following, or rather the exotic Cnicus rivularis, Willd.
n. 30, 
though very distinct from that, and, as far as I have been able to 
determine, from all other described species of Cnicus or Carduus.
Mr. Forster observes that it increases in his garden by the root, 
veiy sparingly by seeds ; perhaps from some partial imperfec- 
tion in the flowers of the plants he happened to introduce.

The colouring of the whole plant, correctly expressed in Engl.

is peculiarly elegant.
Carduus helenioides of Linnaeus, likewise 
a Cnicus, to which Hudson and his followers referred this species,

Carlina.
Root tap-shaped.
Whole herb covered with white cottony pu- 
bescence, which is easily rubbed off, and according to Gerarde 
is used by the poor to stuff pillows or cushions ; as well as to 
mix with feathers, for the same purpose,by deceitful upholsterers.
But it seems very inadequate in quantity, as well as quality, 
having no elasticity, and shrinking to nothing under the touch.
The stem is 4 or 5 feet high, branched, and when in a growing 
. state, may be peeled and boiled for the table ; but it has little 
flavour except some bitterness, which it loses by being steeped 
in cold water.
Leaves oblong, spreading, lobed, notched and 
spinous, running down into the numerous prickly wings of the 
stem ; radical ones very large.
Fl. solitary at the ends of the 
branches, large, of a blueish rose-colour, the calyx cottony, very 
prickly.
The large brown seeds are eaten by goldfinches ; and the bird- 
catchers about London provide themselves with heads of this 
Thistle and the Carduus viarianus, to entrap these and other 
birds, in bright autumnal mornings.

J?ooi tapering, small.
Stem erect, firm, round, 10 or 12 inches 
high, leafy, downy, somewhat corymbose.
Leaves lanceolate, 
sinuated and wavy, green, veiny, rigid, copiously bordered with 
prickles ; sometimes quite smooth, but more commonly downy 
or woolly beneath.
Fl. terminal, solitary, of a singular aspect, 
and not inelegantly variegated ; the florets red, with yellow an- 
thers and stigmas; the radiating scales of the calyx cream-co- 
loured, polished, hygrometrical, changing their position accord- 
ing to the moisture of the atmosphere.
This genus was named after the Emperor Charlemagne, because, 
according to report, one of its species, C.
acaulis, was pointed 
out to him by an angel, to cure his army of the plague.
Its root 
is pungent, bitter and tonic ; but the large white everlasting 
Jlowcr is perhaps most useful, when nailed upon cottage doors, 
in Germanj', France or Italy, by way of a hygrometer, as it 
closes before rain.
*** Florets all tuhular, crovoded, erect and parallel, level- 
toyped, forming a discoid Jlo-doer., mthoiit a radius of 
any hind, except casually.

Biclens.
Common Cal. erect, of several oblong, nearly equal, parallel 
scales, concave, or channelled, at the back.
Cor. com- 
pound, of several, parallel, level-topped, perfect, tubu- 
lar, regular and ec^aX Jlorets; their limb ovate, with 5 
marginal, spreading segments.
Filam.

capillary, very short.
A^ith.
in a cylindrical tube, 
slightly prominent.
Germ, oblong, compressed, with 2 
or more bristly upright points, about equal to the tube 
of the floret, on its outside.
Style thread-shaped, within 
the tube.
Stigmas oblong, spreading beyond the an- 
thers.
Seed-vessel none but the unaltered close calyx.
Seed compressed, abrupt, angular, rough at the edges, 
and beaked with 2 or more bristles, rough with minute 
reflexed prickles.
Recept.
flat, beset with upright, chaffy, ' 
oblong, deciduous scales as tall as the florets.
Most species are occasionally liable to acquire marginal ra- 
diant fextWe Jlorets, destitute of stamens, which consti- 
tutes the character of Coreopsis.
Such a change is nearly 
analogous to becoming double in the generality ofjlowers, 
and is not, as some have thought, a more perfect state 
of the compound tribe, but rather the contrary.
Herbaceous, mostly annual, upright plants, with opposite, 
simple or compound, lobed or serrated leaves.
Fl. stalk- 
ed, somewhat corymbose, erect or drooping, terminal or 
axillary, the base of the calyx encompassed with a circu- 
lar row of spreading leafy hracteas; disk yellow; the ra- 
dlantjlorets, when they occur, are in some species white.
Willdenow considers the hracteas as an outer calyx, in 
which he may perhaps be correct.

beauty and of fragrance, each surrounded by about 8 spreading, 
lanceolate, serrated or entire bracteas, unequal in size, but all 
extending much beyond the flower.
Seeds with 2 or 3 prickly 
angles, and as many erect bristles, likewise prickly with reflexed 
hooks, by which the seeds stick like burs to any rough surface, 
and are said sometimes to injure fish, by getting into their gills.

Root with many stout fibres.
Herb more erect, and taller, with less

Only one species, a densely cottony, perennial, corymbose

coidjlowers.
It is generally taken for the original an- 
cient Gnaplialium of Dioscorides, being fre(|uent on all 
the shores of the Archipelago ; and Tournefort, who con- 
firms this opinion in his Voyage v.
1. 10, detected, with 
great sagacity, an essential generic character in the 2 
spurs of each Jloret, which form a sort of wings to the 
seed.
Gaertner, Desfontaines, and other able botanists, 
have confirmed this, and I can no longer refuse to ad- 
mit the genus, though its original name is transferred to 
another well-known and very ample one, from which it 
could not, without great inconvenience, be removed.
Diotis, invented by Desfontaines, well expresses the es- 
sential character, of a pair of ears to the seed.
Still I 
cannot but wish that the habit were more distinct from 
Santoli^ia.

Every part is very bitter, with a strong, but not unpleasant, scent.
The qualities are esteemed of a tonic and cordial nature, ex-

The curled variety, /S, first noticed in England, is kept for use 
in gardens, as being more wholesome, or milder, than the wild

This has much of the habit of the preceding, and like that varies in 
the degree of hoariness, and in the breadth of its foliage ; but the 
radical /fiaues are usually more narrovi', almost capillary ; and 
when in bloom the two species differ conspicuously, the^owers 
of the present being more abundant and crowded, partially 
stalked, and all of them upright.
In their sensible qualities

Common Wormwood is a powerful bitter, much extolled by Haller, 
on various authorities, as a stomachic, and recommended by 
him for keeping off fits of the gout, for which it is said to have 
served the Emperor Charles the Fifth.
The plant is thought to 
drive awav insects from clothes and furniture, for which purpose 
it is often laid into drawers and chests in the country.
The ve- 
getable alkali of the shops has been usually procured from this 
herb, and called Salt of Wormwood, though retaining none of 
its peculiar qualities.

This species, weakly aromatic and bitterish, has, from remote an-

Ray says it is much used.
Whatever may be its supposed effi-

rather traditionary than ccrtahi.

In Filago the Jlorets of the disk are 
described by Linnaeus as 4-cleft, with 4 stamens only ; 
but this is rarely, if ever, the case.
There are many 
aberrations, as to \\\e Jlorets being more or less perfect, in 
different species, but nothing can be liable to more va- 
riations than this circumstance.
A vast genus, overburthened with species, among which 
there is great diversity of habit, and the exotic ones,

Frequent in the mountainous counties.
Perennial.
June^ July.
Roots with many long simple fibres.
Stems .solitary, simple, up- 
right, generally from 4 to 6 inches high, cottony, leafy, accom- 
panied at the base by several prostrate leafy runners, by which 
the plant is increased.
Leaves scattered} obovate on the run- 
ners ; lanceolate on the stems ; green, smooth and naked above ; 
very white and cottony beneath.
Fl. 4 or 5, terminal, erect, 
simply corymbose, white, with more or less of a rose-coloured 
tint, everlasting, and very elegant ; those on one root most per- 
fect in their anthers, on another in iheir pistils, so that the plant 
is incompletely dioecious ; but this varies, and the seeds of the 
latter kind are often abortive, as in most vegetables that increase 
much by root.
The calyx-scales have a membranous termina- 
tion, either rounded or acute.
Seed-down partly rough, partly 
414SYNGENESIA-POLYG.-SUPERF.Gnai)haliuni.
feathery and somewhat tufted.
The redder Jlorets in general have 
the most perfect pistil, without even the rudiments of stamens.
A very fine variety, almost twice the size of the common sort, with 
the upper surface of the leaves downy, at least while young, was 
gathered on Breeze hill in the isle of Skye, by the late Mr. J.
Mackay, which some have thought a new species.
But it seems 
a mere variety, becoming still larger in a garden, and having, as 
far as I can make out, no specific mark of distinction.

Perennial.
August.
Root with many long, simple, blackish fibres.
Stem solitary, sim- 
ple, from 3 to 12 inches high, leafy, cottony as well as both 
sides of the leaves, which are lanceolate, acute, tapering at the 
base into short footstalks.
Fl. in a dense leafy spike, an inch 
or two long, at the top of the stem, slightly compound, or sub- 
divided in the lower part ; but its lower branches become mul- 
tiplied by culture, forming stalked axillary spikes, along the 
upper half, or more, of the leafy stem.
Cal. cylindrical, with 
numerous, oblong, round-pointed, naked scales, of a dark shi- 
ning brown, nearly black, in the upper, or exposed, half; straw- 
coloured below.
Florets yellowish : those of the circumference 
numerous, slender, tubular, with a short, undivided, ligulate 
border; of the disk few, regular, 5 -cleft.
Seed-down uniform, 
rough.
Recept.
minutely cellular.
Some very dwarf alpine spe- 
cimens bear solitary ^ouers.
The differences between this plant and the following seem pretty 
constant, in their respective natural situations, and there no 
person can mistake them.
Cultivation renders the present spe- 
cies more luxuriant, with far more numerous and dispersed^oit;- 
ers, than the humble wild specimens of the Highland mountains ; 
but the upper surface of tiie leaves continues equally covered 
SYNGENESIA— POLYG.-SUPERF.Gnaphalium.4l5 
with cottony down ; the calyx remains blacker, and thcjlorets 
more dusky than in G.
rectum.
I concur therefore with the most 
eminent practical botanists, who have kept them distinct.
In a 
wild state, though the stem of G.
sijlvaticum is often drawn up, 
to above the height of a foot, among bushes, ihe spike remains as 
compact, and nearlyas short, as in the most exposed situations.

Perennial.
Jugust.
This may be known from the last by its many.
flowered, panicled, 
generally much taller, stem, but more certainly by the naked 
and very smooth upper side of its leaves, and their silvery under 
surface.
The calyx, though brown, has a blush-coloured rather 
than black hue, and the Jiorets are of a brighter yellow, though 
in structure like those of G.
sylvaticum.
In general G.
rectum 
is li or 2 feet high, copiously branched, with abundance of not 
inelegantj^owers ; though I have dwarf specimens from the Ha- 
fod woods, Cardiganshire, not a foot in height, with the i)i/io- 
rescence as little branched as in G.
sylvaticum.
But the /lowers 
are dispersed among the foliage, having their proper reddisli 
hue, and the upper surface of the leaves is smooth and naked, 
while their backs, like the stem, are beautifully silvery.
These 
specimens, accurately observed, cannot but remove all doubt.

Both are natives of Switzerland, and ap- 
pear to be confounded by Haller under his Filago n.
155 ; though 
the real F.
montana, which is likewise a Gnaphalium, was what 
he principally intended.
Hence he finds fault with Lobel's 
figure, as not well agreeing therewith, being in fact designed 
for a different plant, of which Haller had no suspicion.

Stem upright, angular, leafy, 
2 or 3 feet high, terminating in a corymbose, leafy, many-flow-

FL dull yellow.
Tips of 
the calyx-scales green, leafy, recurved.
The radical leaves bear some resemblance to those of Foxglove, 
but when rubbed, are readily distinguished by their aromatic 
scent.
The name of Flea bane, more properly Fly-bane, has been applied 
to this plant ; but the still more correct synonym of its Latinized 
Greek appellation would be Gnat-bane.
The genus Erigeron is 
however the real Fly-bane, some of its viscid species, dipped in 
milk, being used in the south of Europe to catch the various little 
winged insects, so troublesome in warm climates.

The calyx is uniformly very densely and copiously 
woolly rather than hairy.
Florets of the disk tipped with dark 
purple, or brown ; those of the radius twice the length of the 
calyx or seed-down, more lanceolate than in the former, and 
more upright, their colour white, except the inside of their tu- 
bular part, and the stigmas.
Seeds hairy.
Down rough.
Linnaeus for a long time confounded these two last species, so that 
his accounts of them, his synonyms, and even his figure of the pre- 
sent in Fl. Lapp., made in Holland from a dried specimen, alto- 
gether require correction.
Not having compared them in a living 
state, I trust to Haller, Bertoloni, and other able botanists who 
have, rather than to any theoretical opinion of my own.
Nobody 
who has seen them can fail to distinguish them at first sight, 
whether their differences be permanently specific or not.
Some 
have very unadvisedly confounded E.alpinus, in aluxuriant state, 
with our common E.
acris.
Thejlowers of the latter, always 
numerous, are not half so large, and the blue upright^o?e/s of 
the radius are but the length of the seed-clown.
The near ap- 
proach of these two, and of many foreign species, to each other, 
though certainly distinct, may teach us caution with regard to 
E. uniflonis.

very narrow ; each flower on a simple, round, woolly, radical 
stalk, scaly with numerous, reddish, smooth, scattered bracteas, 
crowded under the flower, like an exterior calyx.
Leaves erect, 
on furrowed channelled footstalks, heart-shp.ped, slightly lobed, 
copiously and sharply toothed j very smooth, of a slightly glau- 
cous green, above ; pure white and densely cottony, with pro- 
minent veins, beneath ; when young they are revolute, and 
thickly enveloped in cottony down.
The cotton, impregnated with salt-petre, makes excellent tinder.
The leaves, either smoked like tobacco, or taken in infusion, are 
reputed good for coughs, whence the generic name.

In moist boggy meadows, about rivulets, and the margins of rivers^ 
common.
/3 occurs in the same places, but very rarely.
Perennial.
April.
Root thick and fleshy, creeping extensively, with many long fibres ; 
its reputed virtues sudorific and antipestilential ; externally ap- 
plied it is recommended for malignant sores and ulcers, and the 
strong aromatic scent, as well as bitter flavour, indicate some 
powerful qualities, however what is so easily obtainable may be 
neglected in modern practice.
The leaves are perhaps the largest 
of any British plant ; when full grown, long after the flower- 
^ ing, they are often a yard in diameter, standing on very thick 
upright footstalks, and of a rounded heart-shaped figure, cut 
away at the base close to the lateral ribs, doubly or unequally 
toothed along the margin ; dark green above ; downy, not very 
white, beneath.
Flower-stalks stout, hollow, clothed with con- 
cave tumid footstalks, bearing rudiments of leaves in their lower 
half, which gradually become lanceolate bracteas above.
Fl.
veiy numerous, in a dense, ovate, or oblong, panicle, consti- 
tuting a true thyrsus, all flosculous or discoid, flesh-coloured, 
always destitute of any radiant or ligulate^oreis ,- their stalks a 
little downy ; bracteas and calyx smooth.
All i\\e florets are 
tubular, regularly 5 -cleft, mostly perfect in structure, except a 
thickness in the stigma, indicative of a defect in that organ, and 
except a few found occasionally towards the centre, whose an- 
thers are imperfect or wanting, find which alone ever produce 
good seeds.
/3 differs in no respect from the common Petasites in its foliage, 
but the panicles and their stalks are twice as tall when in seed.

making a very elegant appearance.
The Jiowers are essentially 
different J ^orefs all tubular, generally with 5 segments, occa- 
sionally with 4 only, most of them destitute ef stamens, but with 
Tperfect germen, style and stigmas,the latter being slender and awl- 
shaped.
Their seeds, crowned with silvery, simple, sessile, rough, 
ish down, are all perfect, at least in appearance.
In the centre 
of the disk are one or two, scarcely more, barren Jlorets, having 
a more conspicuous reddish coroZ/a, with 5 segments, and as many 
stamens, whose anthers are very slightly, if at all, combined, 
and whose stigmas are short and thick, totally inefficient, there 
being only the rudiments of a germen, and no seed.
This plant, 
known by the name of J", hybrida, I ventured to hint in Engl.
Bot. 430, published in 1797, mighc be the true fertile plant of 
T. Fetasites.
It is more correct to term it a variety of the latter, 
in wiiich the fertile, or seed-bearing, organs predominate.
As 
to the actual perfecting of the seed, we know nothing, the But- 
ter-bur being one of those herbs whose immoderately prolific 
roots, like those of Mints, hardly allow them to produce seeds.
We therefore can judge of their apparent perfection only.
I 
did not know that my supposition had been anticipated by the 
ingenious and acute Ehrhart, whose remarks on several species 
of Tussilago, to the same effect, 1 have recently found in his 
Beitrage, vol.
iii.
p. 64 — ^&.
My ideas were thought so bold 
and unauthorised in England, that I have ever since, till now, 
confined them to a mere suggestion.
Tliey have neverthe- 
less been adopted, in their original form, by the late Prof.
Willdenow and by Dr. Hooker, but without reference to me.
Willdenow mentions Ehrhart's name, and cites Hoppe's TaS' 
chenbuch, for the year 1803 ; not having access, as it seems, to 
my English Botany, though he generally, after the Didyna- 
mia class, refers to the Fl. Brit, where he might have found the 
same remark.
The observations and opinions of these excellent 
botanists give the more support to my theory, as being inde- 
pendent of it, and I no longer scruple to reduce T.
hybrida to 
Fetasites, not as its proper fertile, or seed-bearing, individual, 
but as a casual variety.
Several foreign species are in the same 
predicament with regard to others.

Root and herbage so like the last, which is perhaps equally common, 
that the two species have, by most botanists, been confounded.
They are both downy, unpleasantly scented, and agree in their 
upright, wand-like, furrowed stem, clothed with numerous leaves, 
beset with small, short, axillary branches, panicled, corymbose, 
and many-flowered, at the summit, 3 or 4 feet in height.
But 
the leaves of the present are not so remarkably dilated at the 
base, nor so much subdivided.
The Jlowers are similar, except 
that the calyx of S.
sylvaticus has, in all its scales, the black 
withered tips characteristic of the genus, and the outer ones, 
besides that difference, are much shorter, closer, blunter, and 
broader, than in S.
lividus.
The perennial plant, of which Ruppius adopts the definition from 
Ray, is our S.
tenuifolius.

On walls at Oxford.
Very plentiful on almost every wall in and about Oxford, where it 
was first noticed by Sir Joseph Banks.
Dillenius sent seeds to 
Linnaeus, but whether he gathered them from the Oxford garden, 
or from the walls of the town, no memorial appears.
It is not 
improbable that the plant was originally naturalized there from 
the garden, being really a native of Sicily.
Annual.
June — October.
Root fibrous.
Stem erect, branched, leafy, smooth, or a little 
hairy, 1 2 or 18 inches high.
Leaves nearly or quite smooth, 
bright green, either sessile, or somewhat clasping, all variously 
pinnatifid, jagged, and sharply toothed ; the lower ones stalked, 
and less divided ; the upi)er often much dilated and rounded at 
the base ; the under side often acquires a violet hue.
Fl. loosely 
corymbose, terminal, erect, not numerous, accompanied with 
small awl-shaped bracteas on the partial stalks.
Cal. broad, 
almost hemispherical, smooth ; the inner scales pale at the 
point ; outer rather few, small, lax, tipped with black.

the extremity, for the most part spreading, but as they fade they 
become revolute.
Seeds a little silky.
Down roughish.
The 
scent of the herb is like Tansy or Mugwort.
Baron Bivona Bernardi has sent, along with specimens agreeing 
precisely with our Oxford plant, others with perfectly undivided, 
entire or toothed, leaves, always indeed clasping the stem; such 
as are figured in Bonanni's edition of Cupani, <.

Our plant does not 
show any disposition to vary in this extraordinary manner, 
whatever may be the case in Sicily.
The above authority how- 
ever is indisputable, nor are intermediate specimens wanting, 
which strongly confirm it.
The Baron had no means of know- 
ing that his plant was S.
squalidus of Linnaeus, nor does it de- 
serve so opprobrious a name.

In pastures, waste ground, and by road sides, very common.' 
Perennial.
July, August.
Root rather fleshy.
Herb for the most part quite smooth, of a deep 
shining green, sustaining uninjured the greatest drought, and 
most scorching heat, at least of our temperate climate.
Stem 
upright, branched in a corymbose manner, about the height of 
the last, but rather more bushy, striated.
Leaves alternate ; 
lower ones stalked, broad, doubly pinnatifid, with wedge-shaped, 
spreading, notched, toothed segments ; upper less compound, 
sessile, more acute, their lower segments crowded and clasping 
the stem.
Fl. numerous, bright yellow, facing the sun, in ter- 
minal corymbose panicles, whose stalks are more or less cot- 
tony.
Calyx nearly hemispherical, its scales tipped with black.
Disk of many tubular florets ; radius of several linear ligulate 
ones, toothed at the end, rolled back and tawny in decay.
Seeds 
of the disk thickly clothed with short silky hairs ; those of the 
radius smooth.
Down of all rough.
The herbage is fetid when bruised, and generally remains un- 
touched by cattle whilst any thing else is to be had, though often 
devoured entirely by the black- and yellow-ringed caterpillars of 
Phalcena Jacobcea.
It has been recommended as an application 
for cancers, by the name of Swine's Cresses, which it bears in 
Yorkshire.
Sherard observed that the radius is sometimes wanting in sandy 
situations.
The Rev. Mr.
Holme found between Clayhithe and 
Horningsea, Cambridgeshire, a very extraordinary variety, in 
which the calyx-scales and hracteas are multiplied excessively, 
the radius obliterated, and the tumid disk apparently a mass of 
confusion.

Our 
aquaticus, first distinguished and named by Hudson, is generally 
very smooth, rarely, in accidentally dry situations, a little cot- 
tony, of a lighter green than the preceding, and its leaves, 
though very variable, always much less divided ; tlie lower ones 
stalked, ovate, nearly entire ; upper pinnatifid in a lyrate man- 
ner, having a few parallel lobes at the base, and a large, ovate, 
serrated termination.
Fl. few and larger, though of the same 
golden hue, with more elliptical radiant florets.
Seeds of the 
radius, as well as of the disk, destitute of the hairy or silky 
clothing which is nearly universal in the whole genus, and which 
essentially distinguishes the seeds of the disk of S.
Jacobcea from 
the present, whose marginal seeds only have a slight roughness 
at the edges, near the top.
The scales of the outer calyx 
moreover are very few.

can, differing from Asto- in having a yellow, never blue 
radius, whitish in S.
bicolor.
The habit agrees with the 
upright, panicled, oblong-leaved species of ^5ifer, and the 
principal generic distinction rests on the calyx-scales being 
closely imbricated, not spreading.
The ligulate^o;e^s of 
the radius are properly fewer than in Aster, but such a 
chai'acter must be variable.
The receptacle is slightly 
cellular in our solitary species, but I know not whether 
that character runs through the whole genus, and accord- 
ing to Gaertner it exists in some species of Aster.

In groves, thickets, grassy lanes, as well as on heaths, and moun- 
tains, at every degree of elevation.
Perennial.
July — September.
A very variable plant in magnitude, number and size oi Jlowers, 
and serratures of the leaves; nor do these varieties altogether 
depend on situation, except that in alpine specimens the JIow- 
ers are larger and fewer.
The root is woody, with long, stout, 
simple fibres.
Stem usually from 1 to 3 feet high, erect, va- 
riously zigzag, never quite straight, leafy, angular, solid; purple 
below; most downy in the upper part, where it terminates in a 
leafy cluster, either simple or compound, of bright yellow^ow- 
ers.
Lower leaves stalked, elliptic-oblong, more or less acute, 
very rough or harsh at the edges, which are closely serrated, 
rarely altogether entire ; upper smaller, gradually diminishing 
to bracteas, which are downy like thQ Jluwer-slalks.
Calyx-scales

erect, lanceolate, downy, membranous at the edges, and finely 
fringed.
Marginal Jlorets from 6 to 10, elliptic-oblong, un- 
equally 3-toothed, spreading ; in decay becoming revolute and 
tawny ; disk prominent.
Seeds minutely hairy.
Down rough.
When bruised, the whole herb smells like Wild Carrot.
Its qua- 
lities are astringent, perhaps tonic, and it has been recom- 
mended as a vulnerary, botii externally and internally.
What the above variety j6, gathered by Sherard in Ireland, may be, 
I have not precisely ascertained.
Its short description in Ray's 
Synopsis answers very nearly to y, which Hudson and Willde- 
now reckoned a permanent species, but which I could never de- 
termine to be so.
iJ is merely a dwarf variety, growing, accord- 
ing to Dillenius, on barren sandy hillocks, and not much like 
S. minuta of Linnaeus, whose synonyms are greatly confused, 
but which seems, by the original specimen, a variety of S.
Vir- 
gaurea.
Swiss specimens of S.
Virgaurea, in the collections of 
Reynier and Davall, are even more various than those of Bri- 
tain, especially in the size of their flowers.

Stem 
3 feet high, leafy, round, furrowed, solid ; branched, and most

Leaves large, ovate, serrated, veiny ; 
downy and hoary at the back ; radical ones stalked ; the rest

teeth.
Seeds quadrangular, smooth.
Down roughish.
Recept.
reticulated, not quite smooth or naked.
Various preparations of the boiled root, mixed with sugar, have 
been recommended to promote expectoration, and to strengthen 
the stomach.
Some think a spirituous extract contains more of 
its aromatic and tonic properties.
The plant is generally kept 
in rustic gardens, on account of many traditional virtues.

Herb more or less woolly or cottony, glutinous, 
with a peculiar acid aromatic scent, somewhat like the flavour of 
peaches.
Stem 12 or 18 inches high, round, branched, leafy, 
cottony, corymbose at the summit, with many bright yellow 
Jlowers, whose disk is of rather a deeper hue than their numerous 
narrow spreading rays.
Leaves spreading, acute, veiny and 
wrinkled, slightly toothed or serrated, an inch or two long, ses- 
sile, clasping the stem with their heart-shaped, or arrow-shaped, 
base ; the under side cottony.
Calyx-scales numerous, very

Leaves scattered, elliptic-oblong, recurved, acute, nearly or 
quite entire, wavy, haiiy on both sides ; contracted at the base, 
slightly emljracing the stem.
Fl. solitary at the end of each 
branch, soon overtopped by lateral ones, much smaller than the 
last, being scarcely half an inch in diameter, of a dull pale yel- 
low, with very short recurved rays, sometimes entirely wanting.
Calyx-scales linear, acute, hairy, all nearly of equal length.
Seeds 
of all the florets quadrangular, silky, crowned with 5 small 
teeth, besides the same number, or a few more, of rough spread- 
ing bristles, shorter than the calyx.
The anthers are spurred at 
the base, as in the rest of the genus.
Recept.
tuberculated, 
besprinkled with a very few short hairs.
Here is a fine opportunity for the lovers of artificial genera to es- 
tablish one, as unnatural as possible, by a technical character of 
no importance whatever.
Nothing can be more truly an Inula 
than this plant, nor is there any doubt of its being the Linnaean

Root of several long simple fibres.
Herb clothed, more or less,

lanceolate, acute, woolly bracteas at the base of their partial 
stalks.
Radical leaves several, close to the ground, elliptic-ob-

As one of that genus, no 
wonder it could never be determined.
Dr. Lamb of Newbury, 
directed by Gerarde, sought out the plant, in its original place 
of growth, near the Roman camp at Sidmonton, 10 yards south 
of the Decuman Port, and a specimen sent by him, drawn up a

/3 is a still more remarkable plant, thrice the size of the above, 
with numerous broad teeth to some of its radical leaves, from 4 
to G Jlowers in the umbel, nearly twice the size of those on the 
Newmarket heath specimens, and it is altogether so different in 
aspect, that were not the variableness of the present Cineraria, 
and some of its allies, so well known to alpine botanists, any 
body might think this a species.
I cannot however detect a 
specific character.
Mr. Davies points out its particular attach- 
ment to a maritime situation.
Yet some Swiss specimens of 
Haller's n.

March — November.
Root of numerous fibres, branching at the crown and somewhat 
creeping.
Leaves numerous, all radical, depressed, obovate, 
crenate, single-ribbed, deep green, slightly hairy ; tapering at 
the base.
Flower-stalks several, radical, ascending, simple, 
round, hollow, hairy, entirely leafless, each bearing a solitary 
Jlower, most open in bright weather, yellow or orange-coloured 
in the disk, the white rays beautifully tinged with crimson.
The 
receptacle is hollow, and remarkably convex, or pointed.
Seeds 
sometimes fringed at the sides.
Double, as well as proliferous.
Daisies, red, white or speckled, are 
common in gardens, and the proliferous variety is now and then 
found wild.
Domestic cattle scarcely touch this plant.
Not- 
withstanding its beauty, and its celebration by poets, the Daisy 
is thought a blemish or intruder in neat grass-.plats, and can be 
overcome by perpetual stubbing only.

very common.
Annual.
August, September.
Root tapering, rather large.
Herb nearly destitute of scent, at 
least of the peculiar, agreeable or disagreeable, odours of its 
tribe.
Sfem branched, spreading, leafy, angular, smooth.
Leaves 
sessile, pinnate in a lyrate manner ; leaflets in numerous, very 
narrow, smooth, acute segments, each tipped with a minute 
point.
Fl. on long, terminal, naked stalks, large, with a con- 
vex yellow disk, and numerous, large, oblong, abrupt, pure 
white rays.
Calyx-scales smooth, and compared with those of 
a Chrysanthemum, rather acute, as wanting the dilatation, or 
appendage, characteristic of that genus, and having a narrow 
membranous border along the whole margin.
The membranous 
crown of the seed however stamps the genus, and this is entire, 
not lobed, in the present species.
The receptacle is naked, very 
convex, but not acute.
A double variety, having a multiplied radius, and an obliterated 
contracted dish, was found in Norfolk by the late Mr. Crowe.

Perennial.
July, August.
Abundantly distinct from the last, to which Hudson referred it, 
notwithstanding the excellent description and remarks of Dille- 
nins.
The thick, woody, long-enduring root runs deep into the 
ground, producing a number of procumbent, branched, leafy, 
smooth, angular, hollow stems, spreading circularly on the ground, 
often tinged with purple.
Leaves crowded, sessile, of a dark 
shining green, fleshy, doubly pinnate, with short blunt segments, 
destitute of any terminal point, or minute bristle ; they are con- 
vex on both sides, but especially at the back.
Fl. not quite so 
broad as those of P.
inodorum, for though the very convex, yel- 
low or reddish, disk is often broader than in that species, the 
white rays are shorter.
Calyx-scales bordered with a very nar- 
row, brown or blackish membrane ; the outer ones acute ; inner 
rounded, but not dilated, nor furnished with any additional scale.
Seeds crowned with a cup-shaped, deeply four-lobed, cartilagi- 
nous rather than membranous border, especially 2 or 3 rows of 
the outermost, which seem to have belonged to radiant florets, 
the seeds in the middle of the disk having smaller, more unequal, 
borders.
This part is not so well represented in Engl.
Bot. as 
it ought to have been.
The whole herb is slightly aromatic.

Perennial.
August, September.
The roots are strong, with long fibres.
Stems in a wild state pros- 
trate, in gardens more upright, a span long, branched, leafy, 
hollow, round, furrowed, downy.
Leaves doubly pinnate, with 
narrow linear segments, not truly thread-shaped or cylindrical, 
but rather flat or channelled above, convex beneath ; 'all acute, 
often bristle-pointed, a little hairy.
Ft. terminal, solitary, ra- 
ther larger than a Daisy, with a convex yellow disk, and nume- 
rous, white, spreading or reflexed, rays.
The scales of the re- 
ceptacle do not appear till the florets of the disk are turned to 
one side, and the innermost are gradually narrowest ; all thin 
and membranous, not sharp.
Cat. with shining membranous- 
bordered scales, rather downy.

Seeds 
very obscurely bordered at the summit.
Varieties with double^oM^er*, whose yellow tubular florets are, en- 
tirely or partially, transformed into white ligulate ones, are com- 
mon in gardens; the discoid variety, destitute of rays, is more 
rare.
The latter perhaps ought to be preferred for medical use- 
the double white flowers being now acknowledged to be weaker 
than those in a natural state.
Every part of the plant is in- 
tensely bitter, and gratefully aromatic, especially the flowers, 
whose stomachic and tonic powers are justly celebrated.

Cal. downy, its scales 
nearly equal, slightly bordered.
Disk convex, bright yellow ; 
the yellow, sharp, keeled scales of the receptacle visible just 
above the florets, and remaining after they and their seeds are 
gone.
Rays numerous, finally recurved, pure white, elliptical, 
unequally toothed, their length exceeding the diameter of the 
disk, which as the seeds ri})en becomes conical.
Seeds curved, 
striated, abrupt, crowned with a quadrangular border.
The herbage has little or no smell, but thejlowers are pleasantly 
scented.
The synonyms of old writers are with difficulty appli- 
cable to this plant or its allies, the receptacle, whether scaly or 
naked, not being noticed by them.
That of Bauhin is very doubt- 
ful, on account of the authors he quotes, and especially his ob- 
servation, that the present species differs from Chamcemelum 
vulgare, Matricaria Chamomilla, only with respect to the smell.
Few plants of the same tribe differ more essentially and ob- 
viously.
In the regularity of the segments of its leaves, charac- 
teristic of a true Anthemis, this species approaches A.
tinctoria.

Achillea, though different

character ; but the short, broad, rounded^o;r/5 of the

Perennial.
July, August.
Root creeping widely, difficult of extirpation where the soil is 
moist.
Stems upright, about 2 feet high, angular, smooth, hol- 
low, leafy, with small axillary rudiments of branches ; corym- 
bose at the top.
Leaves sessile, linear, or slightly lanceolate, 
acute, closely, very minutely and sharply serrated, with bristly 
teeth J smooth on both sides, of a dark somewhat glaucous 
green.
Fl. milk-white in the disk as well as radius, larger than 
in most of their genus, and with a greater number of ligulate 
florets.
A double variety, whose disk consists entirely of such, 
is frequent in country gardens.
Cal. rather hemispherical.
Seeds 
compressed, dilated at the edges, but not crowned at the top.
The whole plant has a pungent flavour, provoking a flow of saliva, 
and this flavour perhaps renders it acceptable, as Schreber as- 
serts, to sheep, who delight occasionally in saltish food.
The 
.sneezing, caused by the dried and powdered leaves, is rather 
owing to their little sharp marginal prickles.

In meadows and pastures abundantly.
Perennial.
June — August.
Root creeping, with smooth, reddish, subterraneous shoots, which 
are warm and agreeably pungent, partaking of the flavour and 
salivating quality of Anthemis Pyrethrum, or Pellitory of Spain.
Stems erect, a foot high, or more, slightly branched, leafy, fur- 
rowed, downy, corymbose and many-flowered.
Leaves doubly 
pinnatifid, and deeply subdivided, with numerous, linear-wedge- 
shaped, bristle-pointed segments, most hairy beneath.
Fl. nu- 
merous, white, occasionally reddish, or purple, represented with 
much too broad a disk in the plate of Engl.
Bot. The whole 
herb is astringent, and weakly aromatic.
The leaf loosely rolled 
together, and put up the nostrils, causes, by an external blow 
of the finger, a bleeding at the nose, which proves more or less 
copious according to the state of the vessels within.
The cuts 
of old authors in general do not well express the foliage.
Ge- 
rarde's figure of the red-flowered variety is better than what he 
gives for the common kind.

bristly.
A large herbaceous genus, which Jussieu, after Tourne- 
fort, has divided into several, bj the structure, or ter- 
mination, of the calyx-scales.
Linnaeus has kept it en- 
tire, and as DeCandolIe has not disturbed it, I shall 
make no such attempt.
Centaurea is most naturally allied 
to Carduus, Cirsium and Serratula, to one or other of 
which some of its species might be referred, as differing' 
only in the presence of abortive, tubular, dilated, radiant 
Jlorets.
But those with either simple or fringed calyx- 
scales, whether furnished with an abortive radius or not, 
must be kept separate.
The presence of such a radius 
is, in this case, an approach towards a double flower.
The leaves are either undivided, toothed, pinnatifid, or 
pinnate ; not spinous in any genuine species.
Fl. erect, 
terminal, or lateral, solitary, or corymbose ; red, blue,

Leaves 
light green, rough with short hairs j radical ones largest, stalk-

Leaves dark green, 
slightly hairy on both sides, rough-edged, deeply an d very variously 
pinnatifid, the segments acute, unequal, sometimes ovate, some-

Fl. terminal, stalked, solitary, large and handsome,

Ca?^j;-scaZcs green and some- 
what downy in their lower half, black and triangular above, 
fringed with fine parallel teeth, or bristles pale at the ends.
Seeds crowned with many reddish bristles.
The calyx becomes 
reflexed after the seeds are blown away, and is rendered con- 
spicuous by the shining silvery hue of its inside.
A variety was gathered on dry banks, near the sea coast of An- 
gus-shire, by the late Mr. G.
Don, which he thought distinct, 
and took for C.
intyhacea of Lamarck and DeCandoUe. It has 
deeply and narrowly divided foliage, the radical leaves being 
interruptedly pinnate, but has no specific mark.
Another va- 
riety as I presume, on the authority of Dr. Hooker, gathered in 
Scotland by Mr. David Don, has the leaves less deeply divided ; 
the radical'ones very large.
Tiiis was taken by its discoverer 
for C.
