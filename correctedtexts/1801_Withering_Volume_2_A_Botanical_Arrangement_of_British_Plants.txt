This is a digital copy of a book that was preserved for generations on library shelves before it was carefully scanned by Google as part of a project 
to make the world's books discoverable online.
It has survived long enough for the copyright to expire and the book to enter the public domain.
A public domain book is one that was never subject 
to copyright or whose legal copyright term has expired.
Whether a book is in the public domain may vary country to country.
Public domain books 
are our gateways to the past, representing a wealth of history, culture and knowledge that's often difficult to discover.
Marks, notations and other maiginalia present in the original volume will appear in this file - a reminder of this book's long journey from the 
publisher to a library and finally to you.

Stem thread-shaped, but little branched, 6 to 9 inches long, 
flexible.
Lea^ves tnread>shaped, tapering, but just thinner than 
the stem ; in whirls, expanding, mostly as long as the joints of 
the stem, jointed ; the knots with prickles and often fructifica- 
tions on the inside.
Fltywers either hermaphrodite or male, or 
female, on the same, or on difierent plants ; sitting ; both tawny 
and white in the same plant, on the inner side of the leaves 
towards their base, 2 or 3 on a leaf, numerous on the upper 
whirls, distinct.
CaL leagues bristle-shaped, the 2 outer nearly 
twice as long.
^Â«/;&^r projecting as it were from out of the calyx ; 
evidently adhering to the base of the germen, and separable with 
it ; unchanged in its form and none burst, in numbers which I 
examined, from whence some might be induced to suspect it to 
be rather a nectary.
Seed-'vessel tapering and greenish towards ' 
the end, which is crowned with 5 teeth, mostly shorter, but 
sometimes longer than the calyx.
Seeds very numerous, and 
very minute, yellowish or white.
In one male plant I found the 
caly^ the same as in the hermaphrodite flowers.
St. â€” Plant 
green when fresh, and extremely foetid ; glaucous wben dry, and 
very brittle.
Leagues sometimes 10 or 12 in a whirl.
Wood- 
ward.
â€” Leaves from 6 to 12 in a whirl.
The teeth or prickles 
on the upper or inner side of the leaves are near the base, and 
more numerous on the upper than on the lower leaves.
The stem - 
and leaves are studded, liot uniformly incrusted, with a hard 
whitish, gritty substance, which gives them, when fresh and 
magnified, some resemblance to the scaliness of a snake.
The 
stems are much disposed to twist spirally, and are very brittle 
when dry.

Neither prickly, nor incrusted : leaves mostiy forked, flex'ilis* 
Schmldel 14.
Stems 1 to 2 feet long, floating under water, but near the sar.
face, covered not as the rest of this genus, with a crust, but with 
a thin green rind.
Leaves in whirls, which, towards the root, 
are 2 inches and upwards from each other, towards the end from 
1 to 1^ an inch ; of the same structure with the stem, when ftiily 
grown from 1 to if inch long.
Fructifications nakedi on the up- 
per whirls ; on the divided leaves at the fork, and on the simple 
leaves about the same distance from the base.
CaL none, not 
even prickles as in other species.
Anther always single, some- 
times solitary, but mostly with 2 germens : generally between 
them, but where only 1 germen, sometimes on one or the other 
side, or above it, never below, as in the other species ; when first 
appearing, white or straw*coloured, as > it advances pale yellow^ 
becoming of a wax-like substance, when ripe of a reddish safiron 
colour, and at last brown, for the greater part hallow within, not 
divided into cells, but containing some pulp intermixed with very 
tender fibres or membranes, and some mealy grains of a saffron 
cdioor ; never opening spontaneously ; gradually shrivelling, 
rotting and wasting away.
Seed^'Oessel oval, somewhat tapering 
towards the point ; the coat thinish, composed as it were of 5 
segments rolled spirally round and terminating in the 5 summits.
Nucleus covered with a very thin membrane, not marked with 
spiral lines, fjill within of very white transparent globules, some 
spherical, otjiers a little compressed, destructible by pressure, not 
wrinkled i 'whether to be considered as seeds I do not deter,

â€” The general opinion that this and the preceding arc 
distinct species, is confirmed by Haller, who tells us, that 
the C.
alpina when cultivated in a garden does not become 
the C.
lutetiana.
But it has not proved an easy task to point 
out any certain and invariable differences, as appears by the 
many alterations made by Linne and others in their specific 
\ .
characters.
The calyx and the joints being coloured or not ; 
the leaves being hairy or smooth, opake or pellucid, toothed 
or tooth-serrated ; the panicle being one, or more than .
one ; 
the plant being simple or branched, upright, or depressed, are 
circumstances which exist more or less in different specimens 
of both.
Scopoli has justly observed, that the figure of the leaves 
afibrds the only specific distinction.
In C.
lutetiana the leaves 
are egg-spear-shaped ; in C.
alpina, heart-shaped.
The latter is 
also a paler, a more delicate, and a smaller plant, not more than 
from 5 to 10 inches high, whilst the former, though sometimes 
nearly as sniall and as delicate, is generally half a yard high, or 
more.

This plant has hitherto stood in the 3d subdivision of the 
species, next after the V.
agrestis, with the following character 
by Linnaeus ; ** Flowers solitary : leaves heart-shaped, jagged : 
^* longer than the fruit-8talk,"-but it bears its flowers in such a 
spikeplike form, that many Botanists have been deceived in their 
expectations of finding it in the 1st subdivision, and after much 
trouble have at length determined it to be the V, spicata, though 
not quite agreeing with the character* It must be allowed that 
the term spike is often used by Linnaeus himself with a greater 
latitude than its strict definition permits, and very often with 
less propriety than in the present instance.
Leaves hairy ; marked with 3 longitudinal grooves.

The difFerence betwixt this species and the V.
spicata, though 
aifficiently obvious when the plants are compared, is not so from 
a comparison of the specific characters as given by Linnaeus ; but 
the stamens in the V.
spicata being much longer than the blos- 
som, whilst in the serpyllifolia they are generally shorter^ the 
distinction of the two species can no longer occasion any diffi- 
culty ; and if the flowering be past, the 3-fibred leaves of the latter, 
mentioned by Mr. Curtis, will still distinguish them.
Stems 
cylindrical, ascending ; several rising from the same root, but 
frequently each has its own particular root ; and if branched it is 
only so near the root : bearing from 5 to 7 pair of leaves ; mostly 
opposite ; the upper ones intermixed with the flowers.

They are pear-shaped, but rather compressed ; 
with an open border at the small end, from the edges of which 
arise 3 or 4 very slender fibres, which perhaps are the real roots 
of the plant.

* I f the fresh gathered leaves are put into the filtre or strainer through 
which warm milk firam the rein-deer is poured, and the milk is set by m* 
a day or two to become ascescem, it acquires consistence and tenacity $ the 
whey does not separate, nor does the cream : in this state it is an extremely 
grateful food, and as such is used by the inhabitants in the north Of Swe- 
den.
There is no further occasion to have recourse to the leaves, for 
half a spoonful '^ this prepared milk, mixed with fresh warm milk, will 
convert it to its own nature ; and this again will change another quantity 
of fresh milk, and so on without end.

â€” The plant \s generally supposed injurious to sheep ; occasioning a dis- 
ease which the farmers call the rot.
But it may be made a question, 
whether the rot in sheep is so much owing to the vegetables in marshy 
grounds, as to a flat insect called a fluke (Ftuiola bepatica) which is found 
in these wet situations adhering to the stones and plants, and likewise in 
the livers and biliary ducts of sheep that are aftccted with the rot.
â€” From 
experiment's made on purpose, and conducted with accuracy, it appears, 
that neither sheep, cows, horses, goats^ nor swine, will feed upon this 
plant.

â™¦ Mr. Moult, in a letter to Dr. Percival, inserted in the PbiL Trans.
vol.
59, p.
T, describes his method of making Salep.
The best time to 
^ther the roots, he observes, is when the seed is formed, and the stalk 
going to fall ; for then the new bulb, of which Salep is made, is arrived at 
its full size.
The new roots being separated from the stalk, are to be 
washed in water, and the outer thin skin taken off.
They are then to be 
set on a tin plate, in*an oven heated to the degree of a bread oven.
In six, 
eight, or ten minutes, they will have acquired a transparency like horn, 
without being diminished in size.
They are then to be removed into 
another room to dry and harden, which will be done in a few days ; or 
they may be finished in a very slow heat in a few hours.â€” Salep thus 
prepared, may be sold for less than a shilling a pound, and affords a mild 
nutriment, which, in times of scarcity, in cases of Dysentery and Stran.
gury, and on ship-board, may be extremely useful.
See Percival' s 
Essays^ part ii.
p. 37.
â€” Mr. Moult made his experiments upon the roots 
of this species only.
The preceding species is undoubtedly equally pro- 
per for the purpose, and it is highly probable that every species of Orchis 
may be used indiscriminately.
Salep has been hitherto imported from 
Turkey at a considerable price, but it is to be hoped, we shall no longer 
be supplied from foreign markets, with an article that our own country 
can supply us with in almost any quantity.
If ever plantations of it are 
made, the phmts must be propagated by roots, for the seeds seldom come 
to perfection.
Dr. Percival observes, that he got some seeds to all ap.
peaianc^ pcr|ect| but they would not vegetate.

It does not appear to me that these can well be made distinct

The colours are confessedly variable, and in all the 
lower lip may be described 3-cleft ; considering the middle seg.
ment as notched, with a projecting point in the notch ; or as 5- 
cleft, when this little projecting point must be reckoned as one 
of the segments.
The upper petals in all are confluent, and the 
lip dotted.
The greater or lesser breadth of the middle segment 
of the nectary, is tne principal diiSerence.

fiectary ; the side ones more convex on the outside, bowed back 
sidewise at the points, the middlemost rather smaller, more bent 
inwards.
These, which are clearly an extension of the skin 
investing the germen, inclose as a calyx the other parts of firuc^ 
tification, and ar6 of a texture similar to that of the iioral leaves.
Blossom of 3 petals, the 2 upper strap-spear.shaped, concave, 
upright, of a greenish whitish hue, as long as the calyx, inserted 
at the divisions at the base of the upper lip of the third petal.
These are of a different texture from the calyx, as above de.* 
scribed, are situated within it, and exactly resemble the texture 
of petals.
The third petal gapingy with 2 lips, surrounding the 
edge of the germen ; iipper lip roundish, concave, reddish brown, 
as short again as the 2 upper petals, divided within into 2 cells, 
each containing 1 of the stamens, composed of 4 valves, ma^ed 
at the base with a fleshy tooth ; lo^xjer lip oblong, strap-shaped, 
bent back, somewhat longer than the calyx, flat, of a yellowish 
greeni&h hue, the sides and end tinged with brownbh purple, the 
edges bent in at the base, with a longitudinal ridge running 
along the middle, cloven into 3 at the end, the lateral segments 
strap-shaped, bluntish, the middlemost very short, projecting 
underneath at the base into a nectary.
I consider this as a petal, 
from its similarity to that of the Fumariaj and the whole class 
of Personattffj which it exactly resembles.
Nectary roundish,

â€” The Rev. Mr.
Stone, in the 
Phil.
Tram, liii.
p. 195, gives us an account of the great efficacy ai the 
bark of this tree in curing intermitting Fevers.
He gathers the bark in 
summer, when it is full of sap, dries it by a gentle heat, and gives a dram 
of it powdered every four hours between the fits.
In a few obstinate 
cases he mixed it with one fifth part of Peruvian bark.
It is remarkable 
that intermittents are niost prevalent in wet countries ; and, this tree 
grows naturally in such situations.
Whilst the Peruvian bark remained 
at its usual inoderate price, it was hardly worth while to seek for a sub- 
stitute ; but now its price is more than double, and the supply froni^outh 
America hardly equal to the consumption, we may expect to find Kaearer 
and more adulterated every year.
The White Willow Bark is tlierefore 
likely to become an object worth the attention of physicians, and if its 
success upon a more enlarged scale of practice proves equal to MfvStone's 
experiments, the world will be much indebted to that gentleman^for Jiis 
communication.
The bark of 5.
trmndra Sii\d/ragilis have the same prou.
perties.
A set of experiments should therefore be instituted to ascertain 
-which of the species ought to be preferred.â€” This bark will tan leather.
Horses, cows, sheep and goats eat the leaves and young shoots.
The 
different species of it support the following insects : PapUio Antiopay and

The speciei of this genus are very difficult to make out.
Soils of varioas kinds, at mnrshy, sandy, mountainous, and 
warm, have ef&cted such wonderful changes on the species, that 
botanists have been often at a loss lo what species they should 
refer several individual plants.
Add to this, thai ihe descrip.
tionÂ« ate altogether imperfect and unscientific.
Their history, 
therefore, must be begun anew, in which case let the names o( 
the old authors be rejected, lest dubioui synonyms !^hould occa.
sion a confusion among plants in themselves distinct ; and let

side, and of some considerable age, its branches frequently hang down 
â– somewhat in the manner of the weeping willow.
The roots run near the 
Â» surface, and extend themfelves to a great distance, whence it is destructive 
to the herbage of upland pastures, but if planted on the margins of the 
ditches, or low boggy meadows, the roots act as underdrains, and render 
the ground about them firm and hard ; ifhe wood is however in this case 
but of little value.
Mr. Woodward.â€” It will give a good though not

St. â€” The wood hath 
the singular advantage of being nearly as good when young as when old* 
It is hard and tough, and is much used to make the tools employed in

Is used for tanning calf-skin.^ A slight infusion of it appears of a pale 
yellowish colour when viewed between the eye and the light ; but when 
looked down upon or placed between the eye and an opake object, it is 
blue.
This blueness is destroyed by the addition of an acid, and alkalies 
recover it again.*-An infusion of the leaves, from half an ounce to an

There is no doulK of its possessihgahtis^^asmodxc vir- 
tttesin an eminent degree.
It is often prescribed with adirantagein hyste- 
rical case^ ; and instances are not wanting where it appears to have removed 
some obstinate epi^psies.
In addition to these important observations.
I would add the teftimony of Dr. Rutherford, who sajs, **^ Never have I 
seen such beneficial edicts follow from the use of any othet remedy, iii 
cases of Hysteria- Epileptic as from it : indeed I have proved successful 
at last with it, when many other of the most celebrated and most powerful 
antispasmodic ihedicines had failed.
The root should be gathered on dry.
^'^^7> grounds ; what grows on wet or marshy is far inferior in virtue to 
the former.
The bed time for collecting it, is early in the season, either 
before, or just whoq the flower stem begins to push out.
U should be 
thoroughly dried by hanging it up in a well ventilated situation, as soon 
as may be after collection.
When in perfection each root consists of a 
bundle of thick, pliimp, fibres, of a pretty bright brownish yellow colour* 
and very pehetratihg sihell, h6arly approaching to that of newly tanned 
leather.
* I prefer the medicine in powder to any other preparation, and 
give it in doses from a scruple to a dram, three times m the day.
No 
Yciy conspicuous changes are induced, except mitigation of the original 
evil.*' â€” It is much to be regretted that ignorance of, or inattention toÂ» 
these important particulars should so frequently occasion this very va- 
luable medicine to be used unsuccessfully, and laid adde with disgust.
-Â« 
In habitual costivenefs it is an excellent medicine, and frequently loosens 
the bowels when other stronger purgatives have been tried in vain.--^ 
Cows eat the leaves: sheep are not fond of them.
Cats are delighted 
with the roots.
â€” Rats are &aid to be equally fond of them, and that the 
lat-catchers employ them to draw the rats together.

This new species of Crocus is introduced on the authority of 
tl^e E, htt.
m which it appean first to have been clearly ascor^ 
tained by the Rev. Mr.
Bbcher of Southwell^ Nottinghamahire, 
and by whom it was found in great profusion between Notting- 
ham Castle and the river Trent, growing there intermixed with 
the *vernus.
It is distinguished from either of the preceding 
species by the segments of the summit being de^ly subdivided 
into from 7 to 12, generally 9i narrow linear lobes.
The fiowers, 
perfectly destitute of leaves, are in perfection early in October, 
sind fade before the end of that month.
The leaves do not begin 
to appear till some time in December, and are more erect than 
those of the other species, their margins scarcely revolute, colour 
paler,.
and their ends not decayed.

It hath been holden in high repute as a cordial ; bat modem practice 
pays no great attention to it, since it has been found to produce no sen- 
sible effect, even when given in doses greatly larger than those gienersily 
prescribed.

It may be given for this 
purpose in doses of 8o drops, every hour or two ; but the degree of its 
acrimony is so uncertain, ttuit it can hardly ever come into general use.
In 
some cases it proves diuretic.
The fresh roots have been mixed with the 
food of swine bitten by a mad dog, and they escaped the disease, when 
others bitten .by the same dog died raving mad.
The root loses most of 
its acrimony by drying.
Goats eat the leaves when fresh ; but cows.
horses, and swine refuse them : cows will eat them when dry.

This plant likewise agrees with die ScÂ» cetsplmus in the upper

The only remaining difference between them is an observation of 
Mr. Woodward, that the Sc. pauciflorus grows scattered^ never 
forming a turf.
Since writing the above I have been favoured 
with the following remarks from Mr. Woodward, in support of 
his opinion, that the plants in question are really distinct speÂ«.
cies : ** The S.
fauctflorm is very different in its habits from the 
cosspitaws, for besides its growing single and not cespitose, the 
stems generally decline and scatter from each other, instead of 
being uipright and close together ; the stems are also more rigid, 
c^ shorter growth, and the flowers fewer, as the name expresses."

C. hma has the female spikes far asunder, as in this species,' but 
then it has hairy leaves and capsules* Goodenovgh.
When 
there are 2 male spikes the under one is much the smallest, and 
the upper female spike has sometimes stameniferous florets at the 
top.
In a young state the lower spike as well as the others, 
ha,s its fruitstalk entirely enveloped in the sheath.
The distance 
between the female spikes increases considerably after the flower- 
ing commences, so that that part of the character is not striking 
when the plant first commences its inflorescence ; but Dr. Good^ 
enough, who has been so successful in elucidating this heretofore 
obscure tribe of plants, observes to me, that it is sufficient if the 
characters apply when the plant is in its most complete state of 
inflorescence, so complete that the capsule shall have assumed its 
proper shape.
It sometimes bears only 2 female spikes.

some little doubt whether ours be the exact plant 
characterized by Linnseus, as the F.
dactylon ; the first 4 fig.
here 
referred to have long awns, but our plant has' none, and yet these 
. are all copied from the original fig.
of Clusins, to which Linnaeus 
refers us.
But it may be, that in the milder climates of Spain 
and Italy, the plant i& awjicd, though not so with us.
None of 
^ the other figures have awns, and therefore agree better with our 
plant.
But vthe hairs mentioned in the Sp. char, as existing on 
the inside the base of the spikes, are not so evident in our speci- 
mens as to justify such an application, for though oat plants have 
some hairiness there, they nave at least as much on the outside 
the base of the spikes, and still more in Other partsÂ«

â€” Alopecurus pratemii is a grass 
very promising for cultivation.
Lewis Majendie, Esq. Hedingham* Castle, 
Norfolk, has cultivated it on a considerable scale, and finds it to be an ex- 
cellent grass.
There is however one circumstance which will be a great 
impediment to its general cultivation, viz.
the depredations of the larvae 
of a species of Musca which devour the seed so much, that in many spikes 
you will scarcely find one perfect.
These larvoe are the prey of the Cimex 
campestris, whose rostrum seems peculiarly ibrmed tor searching the 
busks of the grasses.

The specific cnaracters affixed by Limnaus to the JgrÂ» alim 
and stoloniferay are so insufficient to distinguish them, tluit other 
botanists have been greatly at a loss how to refer to those species ; 
lie does not cite any figure of either, and his synonyms afiford but 
little assistance.
Thus under AgrÂ» alha^ the reference to PetÂ» 
gram.
118 and 119f only informs us that it is a large grass, and 
that the panicle is either brown or green.
The reference to Ray 
Syu. 404, tells us little more than that it is an awnless grass, and 
grows in tuft^.
Under Agr. stolonifera the most instructive re- 
&rence is to ScbHickcm 128 and 130, but Schbuchzer's descrip* 
tionsare hardly sufiicient to.
remove the difficulty, and we have 
still no figure to assist us.
Mr. Hudson, apparently to get rid of 
difficulties, lumps them altogether under tne comprehensive titl6 
of polymorpha^ including no less than 7 species and varieties, 
amongst wnich we find the capillarisy the pumilay the stolonifera^ 
the Mlhaj and the sjl*vatica of Linn^us, a list not only com* 
prehending all but one of the awned species of Agrostis, then 
known as natives, but also some species which have not yet been 
found with us.
It is sufficient at present to say, that the fi^re 
of Leers referred to above, is a very exact representation of the 
plant now K>oken of, and this Leers calls the Jgr, alba, though 
not without a mark of doubt.

The seed also grows unnaturally long and

The blackness on the main fruit-stalk and at the base of 
many of the florets indicate a state of disease^ but whether it is 
produced by an insect, or a kind of smut, remains to be deter, 
mined, though I think it probably the effect of too much moisture.
In one specimen the calyx was preternaturally long and dark

the blossom.

â€¢of it.
The leaves of this grass are the roughest and coarsest of all the 
grasses growing in pasture or meadow grounds, and therefore cattle will 
seldom touch them, unless forced by hunger.
It produces an abundant 
quantity of leaves, and few flowering straws ; has a very disagreeable ap- 
pearance in meadows, and often occupies much ground which might be 
made to produce better grasses.
To get rid of it, the land should Srst bÂ« 
drained, and then the tufts of this noxious weed should be pared up and 
burnt.
The ashes will be a good manure.

There is great reason to believe that this is the famous Or-

longissimum ; giving as its place of ^irowthy Maddington^ 9 miles 
from Salisbury.
Ray adds, that it is 24 feet long ; that they fiit 
logs with ity and says it also grows in some places in Wales.
Ray Syn, Indtcului.
PL dub, mr.
Swayne informs me that the 
part of the meadow in which he found this grass, is in the parish 
of Maddington, and that Mnddington and Orcheston St. Mary 
are divided only by a small stream.* 
* 
* I requested the favour of Mr. Swaynb to send me speciiheos of 
this celebrated grass, which he was so obliging to do, and also to add the 
following acdount of it, which I transcribe with pleasure, as beingÂ« I be* 
lieve, the best account yet given to the public.â€”** The late worthf Ed- 
mund Rack, first Secretary of tlie Bath Agricultural Society, was sent to 
Orcheston, fas you read ^n one of their volumes,) to investigate dus 
wonderful grass.
After his return, he shewed me some specimens whkh 
he brought back, with him, at the same time informing me; that the mea- 
dow had been mown before he canie there, and that he had picked hii 
specimens from the haymow.
These were so imperfect, that it would 
probably have puzzled a skilful botanist to have determined the species^ 
' much less could I pretend to do this.
I knew, however, enough to 
satisfy myself, that it was some species of Agrostis.
I liad thoughts of 
visiting the place myself for a long time, but the distance of 40 miles 
still made me defer it.
At length, being on a visit to a friend in Somer- 
setshire, he told me he had been to see the famous Orcheston grass, that 
hs had been so lucky as to be there at the time the meadow was mowingt 
had been directed to the real ioÂ»g grass by the farmer and labourers at 
work, and had brought back with him living plants and specimens of the 
fiowers.
When he produced the latter, you may guess my surprize to find 
them specimens of Alopecurus pratensis of very large growth.
I carried 
home with me a plant, and set it in my garden.
It produced, the spring 
following, a very fine tuft of the flowering spikes of Alopecurus pn- 
tensis.
This occurrence at once determined me to visit Orcheston, which 
I did the year following, the first week in June.
When#I arrived, the 
greatest part of the meadow, (or rather meadows, for there are several 
partitions, thouf;h the whole is not more than two or three acres,} indeed 
all, except one comer, about a quarter of an acre, had been mown, ind 
the grass was then lying in small cocks.
The standing part had one uni- 
form appearance, and presented a thick and beautiful assemblage of thB 
flowering panicles of what I take to be Poa tri'vialis palustrlt of Hudson.
A specimen shall be sent for your decision.
I escammed the grass cocks, 
and no other flowers of grass appeared, except herie and there a few spikes 
c^i Alopecurus.

on the ground, and had put forth roots at the knots (geniculi] and began 
to be erect only at the last knot or two.
I was informed that these mea.
dows are mown twice annually, the first time the latter end of May or 
beginning of June, and the second time the latter end of July or beginning 
of August.
It will readily occur to you, that no grasses but those that 
â€¢flower early could be in bloom at the first mowing, and that whatever 
grasses are in blossom at the last mowing must be of the late flowering 
kinds.
Mr. Davies says, in his Wiltshire Report to the Board of Agricul.
lure, that Mr. Sole has determined the Orcheston grass to be the Agrouix 
ttoloniftray and probably that grass may be predominant, perhaps the only 
grass in flower, at the time of the last mowing, but I think it can make 
no part of the first crop." Mr. Swayne.
â€” On the supposition that the 
grass constituting the great crop of this enviable meadow is at length 
ascertained, it follows that its great fertility is not merely owing to the 
kind of grass, for that is not uncommon on the sides of broad wetditches, 
and with us begins to flower the first week in June.
But it has.
been 
observed that the crop in the Orcheston meadow depends much upon the 
flooding of it in the winter.
I will hazard a conjecture, that the advan- 
tages in flooding land, depend less upon any supposed quality of the 
water, than upon its temperature.
That when brought over the turf soon 
after it issues from the spring, as is the case at Orcheston, it enjoys a 
temperature equal to 48 or 49 degrees of Fahrenheit's thermometer, which 
it communicates to the surface of the meadow and to the roots of the 
grass, whilst the temperature of the atmosphere is much lower ; so that 
its action is similar to that of a hot wall upon the branches of fruit-trees.
â€”In Lin. trans, vol.
5, Mr. Maton says he is satisfied that the long grass 
of Orcheston isliot only not a species peculiar to the spot, but that it is 
composed of most of the species which grow in other meadows," and this 
certainly appears the most probable solution of the mystery, especially 
irhen we consider the peculiarly sheltered situation and rich soil of the 
valley, and that vegetation in general there assumes a gigantidc form.
â€” 
ilfff.
Maton assefts, that the space of only two acres and a half ha$ 
yielded as much as ten tons of hay in one year, but that the crops aic 
not now equal to what they were formerly.

Orchard Grass.
A grass rather 
coarse but very productive, especially in leaves, and is not disliked by 
cattle, unless when growing on rank soils.
Mr. Swayne.
+ The leaves of this grass are of the shortest growth of any of the 
pasture grasses ; but they grow very close together in great abundance, 
and are very palatable to cattle, particularly to sheep.
It is, therefore, 
very proper to be sown in fields intended for sheep-walks, but by no 
means as-a meadow or bay -grass.
The straws of this grass are remark- 
ably hard and tough, and as they shoot up at a season when the /eaves of 
all the grasses are very plentiful, they are not cropped by cattle, but are 
suffered for the most part to stand and perfect thoir seeds, which seeds 
afiR)rd a scanty subsistance to pigeons at a season when their food is very 
scarce.

Mr. GouGH informs me that vegetating germs of the vivipa-

moreland, and planted in his garden in the year 17Â£)0, still con- 
tinue viviparous, and were so even in the dry month of July 
17*^4.
He says also that he has found plants in thC' valley with 
vegetating germs on them, and from these circumstances he con- 
cludes that there is either a constitutional difference between the 
F. ovina and the F.
vivipara, or else that the plant is uniformly 
viviparous, which he proposes as a subject of future enquiry.
Linnaeus also calls it a permanent variety, and observes that it 
retains its character when transplanted into a garden.

Such may be its just character in the uncultivated wilds of nature, and 
as it preters a dry soil, its growth is an indubitable indication of the saÂ« 
lubrity of such places for flocks of sheep, but in a more rich and cultivated 
country Mr. Swayns tells me it is of little value as a pasture grass, being 
extremely diminutive, nor will it remain long in the ground if sown^ but

Mr. Curtis tells us that in a cultivated state it is nearly in- 
capable of producing perfect seeds.
On considering this fed, 
together with what is recorded of the F.
loliacea, it is probable 
that this plant is a similar hybrid production ; the F.

â‚¬ur botanists being the original stock, and as Mr. Afzelius

readily be distinguished ; but the differences betwixt the F.
pra- 
tensis, and the F.
elatior are less obvious.
Mr. Curtis observes 
that the panicle in the F.
elatior has twice the number of ^pikets, 
that its branches are more compound, that it droops more at first, 
that it is more equally spread ; that the whole plant is twice as 
high, and the leaves twice as broad ; but he thinks the spikets 
aflFord one of the most obvious distinctions, in the pratensis they 
are somewhat flat, strap-shaped; and blunt ; in the elatior less 
flatted, more ovate, and pointed.

When this is the case the calyx has always 2 valves, 
the deficiency of the inner valve noticed above, is therefore 
probably occasioned by the spiket growing so upright and so 
pressed to the spike stalk as to destroy it whilst yet young and 
tender.f 
â™¦ The seeds are small, but very sweet and nourishing.
They are 
collected in several parts of Germany and Poland, under the name of 
Manna Seeds, and are esteemed a delicacy in soUps and gruels, upon account 
of their nutritious quality, and grateful flavour.
When ground to meal, 
they make bread very little inferior to that in common use from wlieat.
The bran separated in preparing the meal, is given to horses that haivethe 
worms ; but they must be kept from water tor some hours afterwards.
Geese are very fond of the seeds, amd well know where to look for them.
The plant afiords nourishment to the Fhalana Festuca, Horses and swine 
will run risks to get at it.
+ Neither of these varieties produce perfect seeds, which has been no-

It has the habit of a Bromus, the artificial 
characters of a Triticum^ (see Tritic.
canin.) but in its strudtue 
it is truly a Festuca.
St. The straight hairg on the leaves dis* 
constant infertility ; supposing that to be the most certain criterion of aa 
hybrid plant ; and from its resemblance both to F.
elathr var.
pratentts; 
and to Lolium ferenne^ I impute its origin to an intercourse between these 
two plants.
It should seem to be the Festuca lolUcia of Hudson, but 
that I am confident it never originated from the seeds of F.Jluitans.
The 
valves of the calyx are very unequal, the interior one being very^ smallÂ» 
and in some specimens which I have examined, scarcely discernible, so 
that it appears to be nearly allied to Lolium.
Admiring the appearance of 
this grass when it first occurred to me, and thinking it likely to become a 
good grass for cultivation, I transplanted some roots into my garden.
The 
same season I fenced round with hurdles a considerable patch of it, which 
I found growing in a close in my own occupation, with a view to save the 
seed.
But when I came to gather it, I was much disappointed, not find* 
ihg a single seed in any of the spikes.
Supposing tliis might have been 
owing to accident, I increased what I had in my garden till it occupied a 
plat of six feet square.
It grew well and produced a full crop of flower- 
hig spikes.
The stamens were apparently perfect, and shed a large quan- 
tity of pollen, and the pistils were protruded and expanded, as if in a 
atate fit to receive impregnation, but not a single seed was formed.
This 
has been its axuiual process for a number of years.

its habit authorizes us to retain it as an A vena, especially when

tinguished from that var* of Holcus mollis which contains 2 or 3

hardly half that length.
In the Avena the leaves and sheaths 
are free from hairs, tne knots on the joints only are'wodly, but 
in the Holcus almost the whole plant is set with soft hairs.

Mr. S wayne, (a) that there was reason to think that the common cultivated 
Rajf-grass had by frequent sowing degenerated from its natural qualities, 
that it was inferior in many respects to the Ray-grass growing naturally 
in our best meadows ihd pastures.
Mr. Pacey, an enlightened agriculÂ« 
turist in the upper part of this county, has lately raised a variety of Ray- 
grass from seed selected from old pastures, and has now multiplied it to 
â–  that extent as to sell annually a considerable quantity at the price of lOS.
6d.
per bushel.
It has been proved by the most competent judges, to 
be infinitely superior to the cultivated Ray~gtass^ and he has a demand 
for all he raises.
What can have been the cause of the degeneracy of 
the cultivated sort i Has the ttmuUntum had any slure in this mischief ,> 
Mr. SWAYKB,

In its short and

* It isra most troublesome weed in arable lands, and canonljr be de- 
stroyed by fallowing in a dry summer.
At Naples the roots are collected 
in large quantities, and sold in the market to feed horses; they have a 
sweet taste, something approaching to that of liquoiice ; when dried 
and ground to meal, they have been made into bread in years of scarcity.
The juice of them drank liberally is recommended by Boerhaave in ob- 
structions of the viscera; particularly in cases of schirrous liver and 
jaundice.
Cattle are frequently found to have schirrous livers in the 
winter, and they soon get cured when turned out to grass in the spring.
Dogs eat the leaves to excite vomiting.
â€” Horses eat them when young, 
but leave them when fully grown.
Mr. Southwell.
Cows, Sheep, ami 
Goats eat them.
Mr. Pitt observes, that this is the most common kind of 
Squitch in gardens, but that the Squitch so troublesome in arable lands is 
formed by several species of Agrostisy Holcus mollis^ and Avena e/a/Zor.â€” â€¢

If the fig.
of Plukenet, 409, 5, is to be relied upon, the American 
plant wmch Linnxus called Â£Â« decangulare^ wants the sheath on 
the stalk; the proportion of the leaves is also different ; and from 
the character given to it by Llnnseus, the stalk has 10 angles, 
and the male m>wer 4 stamens, so that I am disposed to believe 
that the British plant is really a different species, and have named 
it accordingly.

HikIsqp referred it to the RÂ« peregrina of Linn, but in that the

character of the R.

respects^ as appears firom an accurate drawing and description 
ebUging^y furnished at my request by the Rev. Mr.
Swayne^ who 
obsejcyes that the flowers have no calyx^ that the blossoms have 
constantly 5 divisions^ and 5 stamens.

the root IS perennial^ branched, penetrating deeply into the fisÂ«

The plant in climbing up the rocks and through the shrubs sup.
ports itself by means of the prickles on the angles of the stem 
and under the margins and midribs of the leaves.
It seldom pro- 
duces more than 1 perfect seed, perhaps there are not more than -^ 
2 or 3 insiCaoces on any one plant in which both the seeds attain 
perfection â€¢ The whole superficies of the plant does not die in 
the winter, but some of the old stem remams alive, which puts 
forth fresh shoots in the spring.
The leaves which first appear 
in the spring are rather elliptical, as represented in the figure of 
Pctivcr.
Mr. Swaynb.
The uncertain number of leaves in a 
whirl will hardly permit a specific difference to be founded upon 
that circumstance, but if the R.
tinctorum has 4 $tamens and x 
4welelt petal, whiht this has always 5, the distinction will be 
sufficiently obvious.

This plant does not appear to have been known to Mr. Ray; 
otherwise than as a native of Austria, &c.
nor has it been found 
in England by any of our later botanists, but the above authority 
is so particular, tfaiat I have been induced to insert it as a means 
of exciting to further enquiries.
Its creeping roots enable it to 
multiply apace, and when once in possession of the soil, it is not 
easily eradicated, though if the wood be destroyed where Mr.
RiCHA&DSOM found it so plentifully, it may have disappeared, for 
it seems to require shady and damp situations.
â€” [Since the above 
was written, Mr. Robson has sent me a specimen which was ga.
thered on Skiddaw in July, 179^* Also specimens from the Rev.
T. GfsBORMB, whose plants were discovered in 1787 in a rery

* This plant was formerly in repute as a medicine, but St does not 
eeem to possess any remarkable qualities.
~ It is asserted that the leaves 
strewed m granaries destroy the Corn Weevil.
â€” It contains, I have been 
informed, a considerable quantity of nitre, and that in making an extract 
from it, the mass has taken 'fire.
The Nitraria also contains the same 
salt, and is said not to flourish unless Nitre is mixed with the soil in 
which it grows.
Dr. Stokes.
f The stings are very curious microscopic objects : They consist of 
an exceedingly fine pointed, tapering, hollow substance, with a perfora.
tion at the poiat, and a bag at the base.
When the sting is pressed upon, 
it readily punctures the skin, and the same pressure forces up an acri- 
monioiis fluid from the bag, which instantly squirts into the wound, and 
produces an efled that most have experienced.â€” The stalks may be dressed 
like Flax or Hemp, for making Cloth, or Paper.
â€” The plant has formerly 
been used as an astringent, but is now disregarded.
â€” A leaf put upon the 
tongue, and then pressed against the roof of the mouth, is pretty eÂ£Sca- 
cious in stopping a bleeding at the nose.â€” -Paralytic limbs have been re* 
covered by stinging them with Nettles.â€” The young shoots are gathered 
early in the spring to boil in broth or gruel.
Cows eat the leaves when 
they are a little withered.

Misseltoe Bird, the Fieldfare, and the Thrush eat the berries, the seeds 
of which pass through them unchanged, and along with their excrements 
adhere to the branches of trees, where they vegetate.
Some authors ob.
serving that the roots are always inserted on the under side of th< branches^ 
deny this method of propagation ; but they do not recollect that the rains 
will soon wash them into that situation, though it is highly probable that 
they first fell upon the upper side of the branch.
No art hath yet made 
these plants take root in the earth.
Sheep eat it very greedily, and it is 
frequently cut off* the trees for them in hard weather.
It is said to pre- 
serve them from the rot.
Mr. Hollefear.
If the berries when fully ripe, 
be rubbed on the smooth bark of almost any tree, they will adhere closely 
and produce plants the following winter.

In the province of Smolandia, In

Horses, sheep, and goats eat it.
Swine refuse it.
Cows are not fond of it.
The Rev. S.
Dickenson gives the following 
curious account of its pernicious effects on Cows.
â€” ^^** Being lately on a 
visit at Somerford, Mr. Moncton requested me to examine fhc herbage of 
a meadow near the river Penk, in which he had the misfortune, a few 
years ago, to have five milking Cows die suddenly at once, and several 
more with difficulty recovered.
The symptoms of the disease, which he 
attributed to some noxious plant, were irremediable costiveness and ob* 
structions in the bowels.
Upon examination I found a very unusual 
abundance of Alchemilla vulgaris in every part of the field ; and am in- 
clined to believe this plant the cause of the fatality, as it is known to be 
of a very astringent quality.
It was the aftermath the herd depastured; 
and the survivors, upon being introduced into the same field the Summer 
following, were immediately affected with similar symptoms, but removed 
in time to prevent the fatal consequences ; since which Mr. Moncton bift 
never hazarded the depasturing of it by neat Cattle,*'

The bark gives a red colour, and, with the addition of copperas, a black.
It is also used to dye brown, particularly thread, and for colours to be 
saddened with copperas.
It is' principally used by fishermen to stain 
their nets.
In the Highlands of Scotland near Dundonald, Mr. Pennant 
saysy the boughs cat in the summer, spread over the Belds, and left dur- 
ing the winter to rot are found to answer as a manure.
In March the 
jground is cleared of the undecayed parts, and then ploughed.
The fresh 
gathered leaves are covered with a glutinous liquor ; and some people 
strew them upon their floors to destroy fleas ; the fleas are said to be en- 
tangled in the tenacious liquor, as birds are by bird lime.

If planted in a low meadow the ground surrounding it will be- 
come boggy, whereas, if Ash be planted, the roots of which penetrate a 
great way, and run near the surface, the ground will become firm and dry.
Mr. Woodward.
^ Â« Linnaeus somewhere observes that the plants which chiefly grow 
upon mountains, are hardly found any where else but in marshes.^ Pro- 
bably because the clouds resting upon the tops of the mountains keep the 
air in a moist state as b done by the fogs in meadows and marshes, which 
are nothing but clouds in the lower part of the atmosphere.â€” The Icavef 
dye a finer yellow than that yielded by the Betula alba.
It affords the 
Xiaplander, in the summer when he lives on the mountains, fuel for the 
fires which he is obliged constantly to keep in his hut to defend him from 
the gnats, and covered with the skin of the rein deer, it forms his bed.

This plant is parasitical, without seed-lobes.
The seed itself 
opens and puts forth a little spiral body, which does not seek the 
earth to taKc root, but climbs in a spiral direction from right to

nourishment.
Leames none, except here and there a very small

As foon as the shoots have twined about an adjoining plant, they send out 
from their inner &urface a number of little vesicles or papillae, which 
attach themselves to the bark, or rind of the plant.
By degrees, the 
lofwltudinal vessels of the stalk, which appear to have accompanied the 
vesicles, shoot forth from their extremities, and make their way into the 
ibster plant, by dividing the vessels, and insinuating themselves into the 
tenderest part of the stalk ; and so intimately are they united with it, 
that it is easier to break than to dfsengage them from it.

It has been observed, 1 \hink by Linnaeus, that the lower branches 
within reach of cattle bear thorny leaves, whilst the upper ones, which 
stand in need of no such defence, are without thorns.
Â« The leaves floating upon the surface of the water afford an agreeable 
shade to fish, and are the habitation and food of the PJbaitena Potamogeton.
The roots are a favourite food of swans.
Their love of this plant, so 
troublesome in still pieces of water, is such, that by harassing it in 
search' of its succulent root during winter, a pair of them have almost de- 
stroyed it in the whole extent of nearly five acres of water, which at 
times has been completely matted over with it.

In its long common fruit-stalk it resembles the Cowslip, in its 
scentless flowers and die expanded border of the blossom it agrees 
with the Primrose.

but -I summits.
The examination of two imperfect specimens dF 
this kind erroneously led me to think it a Gentian.
Not being 
able to procure more specimens, and unwilling to cut up the only 
tolerable one I had, this error appeared in the kst edition of the 
arrangement ; but in the summer following Mr. Watt brought 
me a series of specimens from the Isle of Wight from 1 to 10 
inches high, which convinced me of my mistake, and soon after- 
wards Mr. Turner informed me that on barren Limestone Hills 
in Norfolk it grows equally diminutive ; though the blossom as 
be observes, is as large as in the largest specimens, which he has 
sometimes seen above two feet high.

No further evi- 
dence of its being a native appearing, it was omitted in the second editioOa 
but several bushes of it having been found lately in the wood on the S.

side of the pool in Edgbaston Park, its admission into the flora of this island 
cannot longer be disputed.
In the north of Europe it seems a common

Mr. Robson.
' I am indebted to Mr. R(%son, of Darlington, for this curious 
â€¢hybrid plant, together with the following account of it.
- This was the produce of V.
Thapsus and nigrum.
In the 
spring of 1789, I planted a root of V.
nigrum near a plant of the 
V. Tnapsus.
Both species flowered well, and the latter wassuf* 
fered to stand and shed its seed.
In the spring of 179^> several 
plants appeared, different from either, but partaking of both 
species.
If he specimen sent was taken from a plant which has come up 
and .flowered for 5 years successively, but produces no perfect 
seed.
.Whole plant hairy; hairs branched, i^oo/ branched, pe* 
^niiial.
Stem 5 or 6* feet high ; branched from the bottom.
Branches undivided, long, angular, lower part leafy.
Lea*ves 
egg-ol^ng, wrinkled, scolloped : lower ones on leaf-stalks ; 
jttiifdle one sitting ; upper ones decurrent, more acute than the 
lower ; gradually diminishing to floral-leaves, and at length to 
flower-scales.
Spikes terminating the branches, 1 1 to 2 feet lone;, 
composed of many clusters of sitting flowers, about 6 or 7 in each.
Cal. segments spear-shaped.
Bloss, segments inversely heart- 
shaped, nearly equal, yellow.
Filaments yellow, hairy, hairs 
purple, 2 of them hairy only on one side.
Anthers orange.
Germ, woolly.
It is diiSicult to say to which of its parents it is 
most nearly allied.
In V.
Thapsus the leaves are decurrent, in 
nigrum on leafstalks ; in the hybrid the lower leaves have leafl 
.Stalks, the upper ones being decurrent.
V. Thapsus has 3 of its

Stem about 4 feet high, throwing out numerous flowering 
branches which are axillary.
Flowers in bunches of about 
a dozen each, resembline entirely those of V.

stamens purple ahd woofiy.
It evidently perfects no seeds.**

Madness, convulsions, and death, are the general consequence.

opium, where the effects of that medicine are desirable, and costiveness 
is to be avoided.

* The whole plant is poisonous ; and children, allured by the beau<- 
tiful appearance of the berries, have too often experienced their fatal ef- 
fects.
Tumours of the breasts, even of the cancerous kind, are said to 
have been resolved by a topical application of the fresh leaves.
Dr. Gra- 
ham in the Med, Communicat.
vol.
i. f, 419, says, he found great benefit 
from a poultice made of the roots, boiled in milk, and applied to hard ill- 
conditioned tumours and ulcers ; and relates a deplorable case, in which 
this poultice efl^ed a perfect cure.
There is no doubt but their external 
application may be productive of gpod effects in several cases, but the fol- 
lowing instance shews us that their application is dangerous when the 
skin is broken : A lady, who had a small ulcer a little below one of her 
eyes, which was supposed to be of a cancerous nature, put a small bit of 
the green leaf upon it.
In the morning the uvea of that eye was so af- 
fecteid that the pupil would not contract, even in the brightest light ; 
whilst the other eye retained its usual powers.
The leaf being removed, 
the eye was gradually restored to its former state.
This could not be an 
accidental effect, for it was repeated three separate times, and the same 
circumstances attended each application.

It in a hedge not far from Ham in the North of Staffordshire, on 
lime-stone land.
The female flowers produced 5 imperfect sta- 
mens, and form a shorter and more thinly set bunch than the 
male flowers, which have 5 perfect stamens, and 2 sunmiits, but 
no germen.
These dioicous plants have been observed in Ger.

This is not a hybrid plant, for its seeds produced perfect plants.

â€” ** It is well worth observing how truly

dicates a wholesome fruit.
The fruits of the Pentandria Monogyni'm art

Ri&es is an excep-

Now when the hop grows wild in stony 
places and in fissures of rocks, where the moth cannot penetrate to de.
posit its eggs, the hop is never known to sufier from the honey dew.

The flowers of the female plants are very generally infused in wort or boiled 
along with it to prevent the ale or beer growing sour.
The young shoot^ 
are eaten early in the spring as asparagus, and kre sold under the name of 
Hop-tops.
â€” Strong cloth is made in Sweden from the stalks.
For this 
purpose they must be gathered in autumn, soaked in water all winter; and 
in March, after being dried in a stove they are dressed like fiax.-^Horses^

â€” A

â€” The 
tree is beautiful, and well adapted to make shady walks as it does not 
destroy the grass, and its leaves are acceptable to Cows, Horses, Goats* 
Sheep and Swine; for this purpose it should be grafted upon the \J* glabra^ 
and then the roots will not send out suckers, which the commoii elm is 
very apt to do, and give a great deal of trouble to keep the ground clear 
of them.

B. June â€” Aug.* 
* The wild'Carrot has always been marked by Botanists as a biennial 
plant ; but, in our corn-fields, and also when sown in a^ garden, it is an 
annual ; hence some doubt may arise whether it be, as supposed, the 
parent stock of the cultivated or garden Carrot, which is always consi.
dered as a biennial, though I believe heie and there a plant shoots up to 
seed the first year.
The roots of the garden Carrot are white, or yellow, 
or deep red yellow.
Th?
seeds have been sometimes used as diuretics 
aad cannloatives ; and are highly recommended in calculous complaints.

â€” Carrots are a grateful and nutritious fixxi for 
all kinds of cattle, and well worthy of a more general cultivation for the.
purpose of the farmer.
Carriage horses will work upon them nearly as 
well as upon oats, but if given beyond a certain period, the cattio are apt 
to make bloody urine.
â€” Crickets are very fond of them, and are easily 
destroyed by making a paste of powdered arsenic, wheat meal, and 
scraped carrots, which must be placed near their habitations.
A poultice

virulent than was formerly imagined, and though it may not cure Cancers 
it is certainly a very useful medicine when properly prepared.
In the 
Â£rst and second editions of this work, very particular directions were given 
Ibr making the extract, but such is the uncertainty of it, owing to the 
difHculty of prcparmg it, that I have now for some years laid it aside, and 
prescribed only the powder of the dried leaves.
Let the leaves be ga- 
thered about the Qn5i of June, wlien the plant is in flower.
Pick off* the 
little- leaves and throw away the leaf- stalks.
Dry these selected little leaves 
in a hot sun, or on a tin dripping-pan or pewter dish before a fire.
Preserve 
hemin bags made of strong brown paper, or powder them, and keep the 
powder in glass vials, in a drawer, or something that'will exclude the lighi, 
tor the light soon dissipates the beautiful green colour, and with itsi co- 
lour, the medicine loses its efficacy.
From 15 to 25 grains of this powder 
may be taken twice or thrice a-day.
I have found it particularly useful 
in chronic rheumatisms, and also in many of those diseases which are 
usually Supposed to arise from acrimony.
The nature of this book does 
not allow of minute details of the virtues of plants, but I can assure the 
medical practitioner that this is well worth his attention.â€” Dr. Butter 
says, obstinate cases of gonorrhaea virulenta may be safely cured by doses 
of 10 grains of the inspissated juice ; a mode of treatment commuiucated 
to him by Baron Storck.
â€” Mr. Whately, surgeon in London, bears ample 
testimony to the beneficial efieds of the powder given in doses of only 4 or 
5 grains twice a-day^ for promoting a disposition to heal in obstinate 
ulcers on the legs ; and its tendency to heal ulcerations of the lun^s, after 
the infiammatory symptoms have been abated, must be generally allowed.

Ever since the time of Ray this plant seems to have been lost, 
or at least to have eluded the researches of our modem botanists, 
and for a long time only one specimen was known to exist ; and 
some concluded that the species was extinct 5 but a few yean ago, 
Mr. Pennington discovered it in great plenty in a field near Bod- 
min, which had then been ploughed, after having lain fidlovr 
from time immemorial.
Being at Bodmin in June 1793t I ap- 
plied to Mr. Gilbert, the proprietor of the land, who very oblig* 
ingly sent a person to conduct me to the field in which Mr. Feo- 
nington had rediscovered the plant.
This field is more than a 
mile North of Bodmin \ the furze is again growing upon it, bat 
â™¦ It is much valued in the Isle of Sky. The root is reckoned a fooi 
carminative, and an.
infusion of the leaves a good purine for calves.
It i^ 
besides used as food, either as a sallad, or boiled as greens.

not a single plant of the Ligusticum was to be found- Dr. Hall 
favoured me with his company on this occasioni and we searched 
the surrounding fields and nedge rows to no ourpose.
At length, 
in a field about half a mile further from Boamm, on ground slop- 
ing into a valley facing to the west, and nearly at the bottom of 
the slope, we discovered a few plants amongst th^ furae.
It 
therefore appears probable that it will soon be lost again, owing 
to cattle being so fond of it as to eat it down wherever they can 
get at it, for the few plants we found were so protected by 
thorns and briars as to be inaccessible to cattle.
' Mr. Stacks 
house informs me that he has since found it plentifully at Hun* 
gerill, in the parish of Cardynham, near Bodmin, on the sloping 
side of a barren hill.
I do not find (continues Mr. Stackbouse) 
the radical leaves in threes, as rqpresented in Ray's Synopsis, but 
rather twice ternate, as expressed in Smith's Icones pictx, fasc.
ii.
I think the circumstance of hailing leaves of two distinct 
shapes is not that the one are radical and the other not, for both 
arise from the crown of the root.
The spindle-shaped root is 
constant and very distinctive.
In Dr Smith's figure, the left 
hand4eaf in the plate admirably describes the difference o^ the 
radical leaf from the others, as it consits in the form of the lobes, 
and the smaller number of segments, not in a trifoliate-leaf as in 
Ray's figure.
From the woody quality of the root 1 suspect it 
to be perennial.

The plants I got in the Isle of Wight .
respond with the fig.

inch long.
The bulbs of the roots seem to vary their situation 
as the plant grows in more or less water, in a thin or a stiiFmud, 
or in a garden soil, so that their being placed in a bundle at the 
bottom of the stem, or on the fibres of the roots at a greater or

Early in the spring, when it

summer advances, and its scent becomes stronger, they carefully avoid it.
Though a certain and fatal poison to cows, goats devour it greedily and 
with impunity.
â€” Horses and sheep eat it with safety.
-f This plant, from its resemblance to common parsley, has sometimes 
been mistaken for it, and when eaten it occasions sickness, tf the cufled-

All the above varieties are probably occasioned by the dif.
ferent age of the plants and the greater or lesser expansion of its 
foliage according to the soil in which it grows.
It is probable 
^at the first fruit-leaves are the same in allj that is^ simdy 
wingedi the leafits egg-shaped and serrated.
When these dis- 
appear^ the lower leaves have wing-deft, or do'obly winged 
leaves, and the upper leaves become also more compound with 
the rest.
An attentive cultivation is wanted to demonstate 
whether such be the case, or whether some of them be feally dis- 
tinct species.

â€¢ The root in its wild state (when it grows near water, St.) is fetid, 
acrid, and noxious ; but when cultiyated (in dry ground, St.
) it loses these 
Sroperties, and the root and lower part of the leafstalks and stem blanched 
y covering them up with earth, are eaten raw, boiled in soups, or stewed.
In this latter state it is called Cdery, They are said to be hurtful to 
people subject to nervous complaints.
They are certainly good antiscor-

It is not a bad wood to turn in the lathe.â€” The inner green iark 
is purgative, and may be used with advantaieie where acrid purgatives are 
requisite.

If sheep that have the 
rot are placed in a situation where they can get at the bark and the young 
shoots, they will soon cure themselves.

* This valuable plant originally came from those parts of Egypt 
which are exposed to the inundations of the Nile.
The seeds yield, by 
expression only, a large proportion of oil, which is an excellent pectoral, 
as is likewise the mucilaginous infubion- They make an easy and useful 
poultice in cases of external inflammation ; and they are the food of sevml 
small birds.
After the oil is expressed, tiie remaining farinaceous part, 
called Oil Cake, is given to oxen, who soon grow fat upon it.
The Â«'/ 
itself di0ers in several respects from other expressed oils : it does not ceo- 
1^1 in winter, nor does it form a solid soap with fixed alkaline salts ; and 
It acts more powerfully as a menstruum upon sulphureous bodies.
When 
heat is applied during the expression it gets a yellowish colour, and a 
peculiar smell.
In this state it is used by the painters and the varnishers.
The fibres of the stem are manufactured into linen, and thi& liaexi, when 
worn to rags, is made into paper.

mrithsome plant of this kind^ See Russel's nat.
hist, of Aleppo, 
The name, Sundxw, setois to be derived from t very striking circunu 
stance in the appearance of these plants ; the leaves arc fringed with hairs* 
supporting small drops or globules of a pellucid liquor like dew, which 
continue even in the hottest part of the day, and in the fullest exposure to 
the sun.
Perhaps the acrimony of the plant resides ia this secietid 
liquor.
* Few persons can have observed the Drosira in its native bogs, 
without seeing some of the leaves doubled up ; but the oause of this, I 
believe, was first ascertained in this kingdom, by the attention and inge- 
sniity of my friend, Mr. Whately, now a surgeon m London.
In the 
month of August, 1780, that gentleman being upon a visit in Derbyshire, 
and gathering some specimens of the Drosera, examined some of these 
folded leaves, and finding a dead insect in each, was prompted to irriute 
the upper surfece of other leaves, by touching thsm with a pin.
The 
tXSbox wu as he expected, a sudden contraction of the icaf upon the pin.
Ae.commtuiicatedthis curious fact to me; and though the experiment 
bas since failed in my hands, I am satisfied he saw what he described.
His 
fHend, Mr. Gardom, a Derbyshire botaidst, who accompanied him at the 
moment of this discovery, has since written me the following account : 
M (n August, 1780, examining the Drosera in company with M^Â« 
ly, on his.inspecting some of the contracted leaves, we observtd a

small insect to fly very closely imprisoned therein, which occasionecT dome 
astonishment, to me at least, how it happened to get into that confined 
situation.
Afterwards, on Mr. Whately's centrically pressing with a pin 
other leaves, yet in their natural and expanded form^ we observed a re- 
markable sudden and elastic spring of the leaves, so as to become inverted 
upwards, and as it were encircling the pin, which evidently shewed the 
method by which the fly came into its embarrassing situation.
This ex- 
periment was renewed repeatedly, and with the same efiect, so tliat Mr.
Whately and myself are both certain of the fact.
' * 
Two or three years after Mr. Whately had sent me an account of his 
discovery, I was much pleased to find the following account of theDrosen 
in a German author, which, though it ditfers in some respects from the 
observations of Mr. Whately and Mr. Gardom, yet upon the whole it 
tends further to illustrate the singular properties of these curious plants: 
." July, 1779.
Dro\, rotundifoUa and D.
longifoRa, â€” I remarked that 
many leaves were folded together from the point towards the base, and that 
all the hairs were bent like a bow, but there was no apparent change on 
the leaf- stalk.
Upon opening these leaves I found in each a dead insect.
Hence I imagined that this plant, which has some resemblance to the 
Dionsea muscipula, might also have a similar moving power.
*^ With a pair of plyers I placed an ant upon the middle of a leaf of 
the D.
rotundifoUa, but so as not to disturb the plant.
The ant etuiea.
voured to escape, but was held fast by the clammy juice at the points of 
the hairs, which was drawn out by its feet into fine threads.
In some mi- 
nutes the short hairs on the disk of the leaf began to bend, then the long 
hairs, and laid themselves upon the insect.
After a while the leaf be- 
gan to bend, and in some hours the end of the leaf was so bent inwards at 
to touch the base.
The ant died in 15 minutes, which was before all the 
hairs had bent themselves.
On repearing this experiment, I found the 
cfiects to follow sooner or later, according to the state of the weather.
At 
II in the morning, a small fly placed in the centre of a leaf* died sooner 
ihan the ant had done, the hairs bent themselves as before, and at 5 in the 
evening the leaf was bent together, and held the fly shut up.
The same 
experiment being made on the D.
longifolia, the same eflects followed, 
but more, rapidly.
I observed, that in sultry weather, and hot sunshine, 
when the drops of juice upon the points of the hairs are largest, the expe- 
riment succe^ best.
It the insect be a small one, sometimes only one 
edge of the leaf is folded up ; hence it should seem necessary that the in- 
ject should stir all the hairs of the leaf.*'â€” Roth.

These accounts will, I hope, occasion numerous observations to be 
made upon this British fly-trap, which so nearly approaches in its won- 
derful properties to the Dionae muscipula, or Venus Fly-trap, a native of 
the bogs of Carolina.
It^is natural to enquire whether this destruction of 
insects be not necessary to the welfare of the .plant ?
It is obvious that 
1^ experiments should be made upon well-grown vigorous' plants in a fine 
day, as then the drops of adhesive liquor at.
the ends of the hairs are al- 
ways the largest.
It may be useful to leznark, that these plants are not.

Germen at the root

It lies buried 
all winter within the root; in spring it grows up on a fruit-stalk^ 
and ripens about the time of hay narvest.
May not the very 
great length of the styles account in some measure iox the delay 
in the ripehing of the seeds ?
As this plant blossoms late in the 
year, and probably would not have time to ripen its seeds before 
the access of winter, which would destroy them, Providence has 
contrived its structure such, that this important office may be 
performed at a depth in the earth, out of reach of the usual efirccts 
of fro5t> as seeds buried at such a depth, are known not to Vege- 
tate.
A no less admirable provision is made to raise them above 
the surface when they are perfected, and to sow them at a proper 
season.

* This is one of those plants which upon the concurrent testimony oÂ£ 
ages was condemned as poisonous ; but Dr. Storck, of Vienna, hath taught 
us that It is a useful medicine.
The roots have a good deal of acrimony.
An infusion of them in vinegar, fonned into a syrup, by the addition ot 
sugar or honey, is found to be a very useful pectoral and diuretic.
It 
seems in its virtues very much to resemble Squill, but is less nauseous 
and less acrimonious, though more sedative.

This plant has been difcovered in such various and little fre- 
quented parts of the kingdom, that we can no longer hesitate to 
introduce it as British.
Mr. Norris says^ it has established it- 
self, to his knowledge, during five years, if not longer, in a ne- 
glected concavity whence a coarse sand-stone has been formerly ex- 
tracted, in Bowood Park, the seat of the Marquis of Lansdown, 
near Devizes.
The seeds are regularly ripened every year, and 
produce abundantly : the plants in general do not flower before 
the second season, after which the root dies, being bienniaL 
They seem perfectly naturalized and increase in number yearly.
Mr. Norris lately saw more than twenty distinct ones in flower, 
surrounded by a multitude of younger, which will not blossom 
till the succeeding season.
The spot is not near any house nor 
Testiges of such.
About Bath, and some other places, it is said 
to be commonly found on dunghills, &c.
seeming to be in paral- 
lel circumstances with the Datura Stramonium.
It attains the 
Iieight of 5 or 6 feet.
The main stem and larger branches are 
every where beset with minute asperities, terminating in fine 
transparent hairs, feeling not unlike a rough file; Leaves ra* 
tber waved than flat.

p. 303 ; but 
the filaments in Var. 1, are hairy, as well as the germen.
â™¦ It flourishes best in open places and sandy ground : but wiU thrive 
very 'well in richer soil.
It grows quick; is easily transplanted ; bears 
cropping, and the grass flourishes under its shade.
It is said, to grow 
better near the sea than in any other situation, and that a plantation, ^ 
these trees at ^ofetr asunder^ with 3 sea Salloiv -thorns between every 2 of 
them, will make a fence sufficient to defend the herbage of the country 
from the spray of the sea.

The turners form it into bowls, trenchers, &c.
â€” If a hole 
is bored into the body of the tree, when the sap rises in the spring, it dif- 
charges a considerable quantity of a sweetish watery liquor, which is used 
in making wine, and, if inspissated, afibrds a fine white sugar.
â€” The pol-

The poorer inhabiti^ts make walls for their cotuges, with 
alternate layers of heath, and a kind of mortar made of black earth and 
straw, the woody roots of the heath being placed in the centre, the tops

They make their beds of it, by placing the

â€” The considerable and long continued heat and 
irritation that it produces in the throat, when chewed, made me first 
think of giving it in a case of difficulty in swallowing, seemingly occi- 
sioned by a paralytic affection.
The patient was directed to chew a thiA 
slice of the root as often as she could bear to do it ; and, in about two 
months, she recovered her power of swallowing.
This woman bore the 
disagreeable irritation, and the ulceration its acrimony occasioned in her 
mouth, with great resolution ; but she had been reduced to skin and bone, 
and for 3 years before had suffered extremely from hunger, without bei^ 
able to satisfy her appetite : for she swallowed liqiiids very impeifiKtlf, 
and solids not at all.
The complauit came on after lying in.

wood is used for fishing rods, walking sticks, crates, hoops for barrels, ftc.
the shoots for springles to fasten down thatch.
The roots are preferred 
where beautiful wood is required for inlaying or staining.
It is a practice 
in Italy to put the chips of hasel intd turbid wine, to clear it, which it 
does in 24 hours : and in countries where yeast is scarce, they take the 
twigs of Hasel, and twist them together, so as to be full of chinks : these 
they steep in ale during its fermenution : then hang them up to dry, aod 
when they brew again they put them into the wort instead of yeast.â€” 
Painters and engravers prepare coals for delineating their design thus : they 
take pieces of Hasel about as thick as a man's ann, and 4 or c inches long, 
dry and then cleave them into pieces about as thick as one's sngei .
These 
they put into a large pot full of sand, and then cover the top of the pot 
with clay.
This is exposed in a potter's oven, or anv other sufficient de- 
gree of heat, and, when cooled again, the sticks are found converted into 
charcoal, which draws freely, and easily rubs out again.
The nuts ait

The ashes of this plant,

advantage over other semi-caustic preparations of the vegetable Alcali.
Its acrimony rises in distillation, and the distilled water drank to the

Some c^ the figures referred to under the preceding species be^ 
long to this, particularly that of Hunter's Evelyn's Sylva, but in 
general they are so ill drawn, and with so little attention to the 
specific differences, that it is hardly possible to refer them with any 
degree of certainty.
The following remarks also belong to both 
the species.* 
â™¦ The Oak lores hilly better than boggy ground, and thrives besf, 
while young, in large plantations.
Its roots descend deep into the earth* 
and therefore will not bear to be transplanted..
Much lopping destroys 
it.
Crass will hardly grow beneath it.â€” The wood is hard, tough, to-

it is well adapted to almost 
every purpose of the carpenter ; but an attempt to enumerate all the uses 
of this well known wood, would be equally superfluous and difficult.â€” 
Oak saw-dust is the principal indigenous vegetable used in dying fustian.
All the varieties of drabs, and different shades of brown, are made with 
Oak saw-dust, variously managed and compounded.
â€” The balls, or Oak- 
apples, are likewise used in dying, as a substitute for galls.
The black got 
from them, by the addition of copperas, is more beautiful than that from 
l^ls, but not so durable.
â€” The bark is universally used to tan leather.
Its astringent properties may be turned to good account in many medical 
indications.
An infusion of it, with a small quantity of copperas, is used 
by the common people to dye woollen of a purplish blue : the colour, 
though not very bright, is durable.
The balls, or galls upon the leaves, 
are occasioned by a small insect with four wings, called Cynips quern fiTiff 
which deposits an egg in the substance of the leaf, by making a' small per- 
foration on the under surface.
The ball presently begins to grow : and 
the egg in the centre of it changes to a worm ; this worm again changes to 
a nymph, and the nymph to the flying insect with four wings.
Â»Horses, 
cows, sheep, and goats eat the leaves.
Swine and deer fatten on the acorns.

larger branches, contained 145$ feet of timber.

The plant iÂ« much

Haifa dram of 
the powdered leaves given every, or every other day, has been found 
Bseful in calculous cases.
It was first used for this purpose at Montpc- 
lier, and afterwards by Dr. de Haen, at Vienna, who relates several cases, 
in which it proved of the greatest service.
Its success in England has 
been uncertain.
Sometimes the patients found no relief, but thought 
their complaints rather aggravated than alleviated ; whilst, in other cal- 
culous and nephritic cases, the symptoms have been almost entirely reÂ« 
moved.
Perhaps, upon the whole, we shall find it no better than other 
vegetable astringents ; some of which have long been used by the country 
people, in gravelly complaints, and with very great advantage : though 
hitherto unnoticed by the regular practitioners.

2 of these rise from one root.
At other times it bears a number 
of flowers at the top of the stalk, on fruit-stalks, forming an um-

posed of smaller ones as figured in Ray. But m all these states

Bat 
it is evident from Ray's description that the Dover plant is a Si.
lene, and not a Cucabalus, for he particularly mentions the crowa 
at the mouth of the blossom, and the circumstance of the stamens 
protruding from the blossom, and pointing downwards, is so re- 
markable in the C.
italicus, that it could not have escaped the 
observation of our countryman.

same ; but on comparing Ray's plant with the fig.

above was written I have been favoured with a specimen of the

These are the figures which Linnzus refers to 'his S.
conotdea^ 
and with these, as well as with the description of S.
conotdea^ my 
specimens from the London Botanic Garden accord.
Mr. Hud- 
son, indeed, gives to the S.conoidea, the synonyms which Linnasus 
has referred to the L.
couica, but he mentions no place of growth, 
except on the authority of R.
Syn. Dr.
Stokes.
But it can hardly 
be supposed that Ray or Dill, should have been mistaken in this 
case, we must therefore believe the S.

that the S.

This very common plant which grows almost in all situa* 
tions from damp and almost boggy woods to the dryest gravel 
walks in gardens, is consequently subject to great alterations in 
its appearance.
Those who have only seen jyt in its usual state 
as garden Chickweed, would hardly know it again hi woods 
where it sometimes exceeds half a yard in height, and has leaves 
4Hr DECANDRIA.
TRIGYNIA, SteUaruu 
near 2 inches long and more than 1 inch broad resembling in its 
habit the Stellaria nemoruniy or the Cerastiom aquaticain ; dis.
tinguishable however from the latter by the number of pistils, 
and from the former by the woolly or hairy ridge extending 
along the stem.
The great uncertainty in the number of stamens occasions 
some difficulty to the young botanist* In its truly wild state, in 
damp woods and hedge bottoms with a northern aspect, what- 
ever be its size, it has almost always 10.
stamens.
l!n diyer soils 
and more sunny exposures the stamens are usually 5 or 3 ; and 
this is also generally the case in gardens, though scMoetimes 
Sowers are found with only I or 2 stamens.
The calyx in all 
thp&e difierent states is sometimes smooth, sometimes hairy* The 
other parts of the fructification are very constant/and the capsule 
opening with 6 valves, compels us to consider it as a species of 
Stellaria gather than as an Alsine ; its further agreement with 
the fornoer genus will also be evinced by the fblk>wing descrip.

white.â€” This species is a notable mstance of what is 
called the Sleep of Piants-^iot every night the leaves approach in pairs, so 
as to include wijthin their upper surfaces the tender rudiments of the new 
shoots ; and the uppermost pair but one, at the end of the stalk, are fur- 
nished with longer leaf- stalks than the others, so that they can close upon 
the terminating pair, and protect the end of the branch.
Linn.
The 
young shoots and leaves, when boiled, can hardly be distinguished from 
spring spinach, and are equally wholesome.
Swine are extremely fond of 
it ; cows and horses eat it ; sheep are indiflbieBt to it ; and goats refuse it.
It is a grateful food to small birds and to young chickens.
-I- As it appears necessary to introduce the Al&ine media into this gtuus* 
the trivial name affixed to this plant by Du Sibthorpe, could not well be 
retained.

in structure one might have expected to afford a mark of specific 
distinction, but, though generally the two kinds of seeds are 
found on different plants, yet they are sometimes seen in the same 
seed-vessel.

The last 4 species are not easily to be distinguished by the 
tpeoific characters.
The leaves in all are yeiy tlender, the stens 
more or less hirsute, as are also the calyxes;- the calyx leaves 
are ribbed, and they all bear their (lowers in ps^niclea.
The beit 
distinctions may perhaps be taken from the consideration of the 
calyx leaves and petals ; thus : 
In the Aren.

much longer than the petals.
larici/alia, the calyx leaves are strap-spear-shapedi 
and shorter than the petals*

receives iis nourishment principally from the air ; but from aontc accurate 1 
experiments mode by Mr. Coughaf Kendal, and communicated to me, it \ 
appears llial though thclifeof the plant is retained in such a situation fi 
(ome weeks, yet it seems lo be at the cxpence of the juices which il 
â€¢ucculcDl leavei had previously imbibed.
At the end of 3 weeks, IhB J 
plant, luspetxted towards the end of June, beforca window with a noithf T 
^m aspect, had lostabuut half its weight, though it had put out some til ~ 
fibres from the root, and had still life enough to enable it to turn to tl 
light alter having been purposely turned from it.
After being kept i ^

Both these plants correspond in structnre, they both have |

are found with hermaphrodite flowers.
Ray observes that ii 
red-(]owered the stems are weaker and more flaccid than ii 
other, and from iheir not growing intermixed, Mr. Woodwaidt I 
and some other judicious botanists believe them to be distincV I 
species.
In the white-flowered sort the petals of the male plantf' I 
have the limbs divided down to the claws, but in the female theiA j 
are only cloven half way down.

These trivial 
names and his distinction founded on tne shap^ of the capsolei 
are therefore added ta their respective varieties, though I am 
far from thinking that they may not be distinct species.
More lately still Mr. Kobson informs me that, from having 
cultivated both, he is satisfied they are distinct species, though 
th^ are both liable to change the colour of their blossoms to 
flesn colour.

The flowers, fresh gathered, smell like apricots.
* Nothing will thrive under its shade.
â€” The wood is applicable to 
the same uses that oak is.
â€” If the bark is not taken off^ it makes poles for 
espaliers, dead fences and hop yards, and pipes to convey water under 
gcound, which will last longer than elm or oak.
â€” Some of the oldest 
buildings in London are said to be constructed with this wood.â€” -At Tort- 
^vorth, in Gloucestershire, there is a tree 52 feet round.
It is proved to 
have stood there ever since the year 1 150, and was then so remarkable as 
to be called the great Chesnut of Tortworth.
It fixes the boundary of 
the manor, and is probably near 1000 years old.
Gent.
Mag, 1766, p.
321, 
"where there is a drawing of it.
Mr. CoUinson, the author of this ac- 
count, makes no doubt of the Chesnut being a native of England, and 
assigns the great profit that arises from them when cut for hop-poles, as 
the reason why it is so rare to see large trees in the woods.
Mr. Marsham meiasured this tree in the year 1759, at the height of 6 
feet from the ground, where its girth was 46 feet 6 inches.
He calculates 
that it cannot be less, probably much more, than iioo years old, and that 
at was 540 years old when John came to the throne, and would then mea* 
sure II yards in circumference.

The nuts are used for whitening linen cloth, and for making starch.
They are roasted on small stoves in the streets by the fruit-women, and 
in winter form a very agreeable addition to our desserts.
They constitute

rope ; and hogs feeding on them as they run wild in the forests, are reck- 
oned particularly ezctllent.

From the disagreement of our specimens with the Linnaean 
E. verrucosa y I had been led to suppose that there had been a 
mistake in calling our species the ^verrucosa^ and expressing my 
suspicions on this point to Mr. Relhan, who seems to have been 
the first who found the plant since the time of Ray, he very 
obligingly sent me some young plants, but unfortunately they 
did not live.
Dr. Smith now informs us, that our plant is the 
* E.
stricta of Syst, Nat, which Linnaeus afterwards omitted, and 
confounded with the 'verrucosa.

â€¢ The powdered leaves, in doses of 15 to 25 grains, operate as a purge.
'he juice of every species of Spurge is so acrid, that it corrodes and ulce- 
ues the body wherever it is applied , so that physicians have seldom vcn- 
ared to use it internally.
Warts or corns anointed with the juice pre- 
siitly disappear.
A drop of it put into the hollow of a decayed and 
ching tooth, destroys the nerve and consequently removes the pain.
Some 
eople rub it behind the ears, that it may blister, and bv that m-^ans give
