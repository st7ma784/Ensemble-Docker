This is a digital copy of a book that was preserved for generations on library shelves before it was carefully scanned by Google as part of a project 
to make the world's books discoverable online.
It has survived long enough for the copyright to expire and the book to enter the public domain.
A public domain book is one that was never subject

cither sown by design or accident.

rived from this species.

+ The fruit is acid, but so tempered by a sweetness and roughness as 
not to be unpleasant, particularly after it is mellowed by the frosts.
A 
conserve is prepared by mixing the pulp with thrice its weight of sugar.
The bark of the roots and branches is considerably styptic, An infusion 
of the flowers, sweetened with sugar, is a mild purgative, not improper for 
children.
X This is not well adapted to grow in hedges, because it spreads its roots 
wide, and encroaches upon the pasturage \ but it makes a good de^d fence.

They tell you it has no thomss bat that I found to be a mistake : 
it has thomsj like other Hawthorns, but which also on large trees 
are but few.
There is a full-sized tree of this kind in th6 
garden at Piper's Inn. It blossoms twice a-year ; the wintef 
blossoms, which are about the size of a sixpence, appear about 
Christmas, and sooner if the winter be severe.
These produce 
no fruit.
The berries contain only 1 seed, and there seemed to 
have been only 1 pistil, but it was late in the season when I eJU 
amined it.
I was informed that the berries, when sown, pto* 
duce plants nowise differing from the common Hawthorn.
Probably the tree which gave birth to the legend grew within 
the walls of the abbey, and may have died from agCj or been 
destroyed at the time of the reformation.

* 1 1 loves a fertile soil and sloping ground ; but will not thrive well 
in moist' bottoms.
It stands the severest winters, and does not destroy 
the grass.
The wood is light, smooth, and compact ; it is used by tur- 
ners, and to make joiners tools ; and for picture frames, to be stained 
black.
The leaves afford a yellow die, and may be used to ^te a green 
to blued cloths.
The fruit is austere ; but when cultivated highly^rateÂ« 
ful, as is proved by the great variety of excellent pears which the industry 
of mankind has raised, for they all originate from this.
The juice of the 
fruit fermented is called Perry, large quantities of which are raised in 
Worcestershire and Herefordshire for that purpose.
The Squash, tbt 
Oldfield, and the Barland Perry s are reckoned tl^ best, and are little in- 
ferior to wine.

exposures or boggy lands.
Grass and even com will grow beneath it.
It 
js much used as a stock, on which to ingraft the better kind of apples; 
because its roots are neither killed by frost nor eaten by iield mice.
The 
bark affords a yellow dye.
The wood is tolerably hard ; it turns very 
clean, and when made into cogs for wheels obtains a polish, and wears a 
long time.
The acid juice of the fruit is called by the country people 
Verjuice, and is much used in recent sprains, and in other cases, as an 
astringent or repellent.
With a proper addition of sugar, it is probably 
that a very grateful liquor might be made with the juice, but little infeÂ« 
lior to Old Hock.

seems to have been clear that there were 2 sorts of Great Bram^^ 
ble, but he has not well ascertained their differences.
This will 
, probably prove to be a distinct species ; a similar opinion has 
been lately expressed by Dr. Smith, who proposes to illustrate 
it by the name of R.
corylifolius.
It is remarkable that the 
segments of the calyx in this plant are clasped inwards upon the 
fruit, whilst in the R.
caesius they are expanded.
I wish it to 
be determined by examination, if the segments of the calyx of 
the fruit are not always bent inwards and clasping the fruit in 
this plant, always expanding in the R.
caesius, and always re-' 
fleeted back in R.
fruticosus.

â™¦ The berries are not unpleasant, and held to be an excellent anti- 
scorbutic.
The Norwegians pack them up in wooden vessels and send 
them to Stockholm, where they are served up in desserts, or made into 
tarts.
; The Laplanders bury them under the snow, and thus preserve 
them fresh froni one year to another.
They bruise and eat them with 
the milk of the Rein Deer.
In the Highlands of Scotland also they are 
sometimes brought to table with the dessert.
The Papilio RuM, Phalana 
Pai/oniay Rubi^ Fascelina^ and Sambucariay are nourished by the difierent 
species.
+ The berries, cither eaten alone, or with sugar, or with milk, are 
universally esteemed a most delicious fruit.
They are grateful, cooling, 
sub-acid, juicy, and have a delightful smell.
Taken in large quantities 
they seldom disagree.
They promote perspiration, impart a violet scent 
to the urine, and dissolve the tartarous incrustations upon the teeth.
People afflicted with the gout or stone have found great relief by using 
them largely, and Hoifman says, he has known consumptive people cured 
by them.
The bark of the root is astringent.
Sheep and goats eat it.
Cows are not fond of it.

Several highly respectable Botanists have thought that the 
Potentilla and Tormehtilla ought to constitute but one genus, 
the onlydifiertoce consisting in the number of the petals and of 
the clefts of the calyx ; but after mentioning this circumstance^ 
I think their present disposition more favourable for investiga- 
tion.
Unwilling as we are to change a Linnaean name, his epi.
thet erecta (upright) given to the present species, is so very erÂ«

Sent to me by Mr. Atkinson, from Roosebeck, where it

I collected similar speci- 
mens by the sea side at Weymouth in May. All the plants I 
have seen are only about 4 inches high.
If when cultivated in a 
good soil it still continues to bear only a sinde flower, there can 
be no doubt of it being a distinct species.
In reply to my fur- 
ther enquiries, Mr. Atkinson says, ** The Poppy with 1 flower

The bristles on 
the fruit-stalks are laid close as in the latter, but the segments of 
the leaves are very much snipt at the edges.
The calyx is studded 
with large transparent gibbules, with a taper bristle springing 
oat of each.
The capsule is nearly t.wke as long as it is broad,

Mr. WqopwARDt] P.
Juneâ€” Aug,+ 
* In the ^utum the plaints sink to the bottpm of the water, and in 
the Spring from amongst the lea\'es of the old plants arise numerous 
^hick suckers, each bearing a young plant, which arises and Heats on the 
surface, where it grows to maturity.
Sometimes S or lo form a circle on 
the surface, to which the strings were radii, and the olci plant at the hot* 
tom the centre, and in this manner they sometimes rise so thick as en- 
tireiy to fill up the surface of ditches, preventing all other plants from 
growing in it.
I should suppose the mother plant decays, as the floating 
plants shoot out fibres, which, if they do not sooner, on sinking probably 
lay hold of the mud, and these in the Spring, I apprehend, produce tke 
fresh offspring.
Ifsuchbeits mode ot growth, it is an example of a 
biennial of a very singular nature.

Curt.â€” The root and 
the leaves when recent, are so extremely acrid, that it is highly disagree- 
able to taste them.
The root has been employed in medicine as a stimu- 
lant, but when reduced to powder it loses much of its acrimony, and there 
is reason to suppose that the compound powder which takes its name 
from that plant, owes its virtues chiefly to the other ingredients.
There 
is no doubt but this acrid quality may be turned to very useful purposes, 
but we must first learn how to ascertain its dose.
â€” The root, dried and 
powdered, is used by the French to wash their skin with, and is sold at a 
nigh price, under the name of Cypress Powder.
It is undoubtedly a 
gc^, and an innocent cosmeticâ€” -When the acrimony of the i^oots is ex- 
tracted, either by boilipg or baking, they, certainly will aflbrd a very mild 
and wholesome nourishment.
Many nations prepare the only bread they 
l|ave, from plants as acrimonious as this : nrst dissipating the noxious 
qualities by the force of heat.
â€”Starch may be made from the root^.

Its acri- 
mony rises in distillation.
Some years ago a man travelled in several parts 
of England administering vomits, which, like white vitriol, operated the 
instant they were swallowed.
The distilled water of this plant was his 
medicine; and, from the experience I have had of it, I feel myself an* 
thorised to assert, that in the case of poison being swallowed, or other 
circumstances occurring in which it is desirable to make a patient vomit 
instantaneously, it is preferable to any other medicine yet known, and does, 
not excite those painful contractions in the upper part of the stomach 
which the white vitriol sometimes does, thereby defeating the intention 
for which it was given.

The remarkable yellowness of

the English botanist to look for it in this class, though Linnxus 
has placed it in the class Diandria, because the greater number 
of species have only 2 stamens.

Cats are so de- 
lighted with this plant, that they can hardly be kept out of the garden 
wherein it grows.
Mr. Miller says, that cats will not meddle with it if 
it is raised nrom seeds ; and, in support of this opinion, quotes an old say- 
ing, ** If you set itt the cats will eat it ; if you sow it, the cats will not 
know it.

* The flavour of this species being more agreeable than that of the 
tthers, it is generally preferred for culinary and medicinal purposes.
A 
ooBjferve of the leaves is very grateful, and the distilled waters, both sim- 
pie and spirituous, are universally thought pleasant.
The leaves are 
used in spring saliads ; and the juice of them, boiled up with sugar, is 
formed into tablets.
The distilled waters, and the essential oil, are often 
given to stop retchings, and frequently with success.
From the circum- 
stances noticed under M.
arvensis, it has been imagined, that cataplasms 
ami fomentations of Mint, would dissolve coagulations of milk in the 
bfCfists ; but Dr. Lewis says, that the curd of milk, digested in a strong 
infusion of Mint, cpuld not be perceived to be any otherwise affected than 
by common water; however, milk, in which Mint leaves were set to ma- 
cerate di4 not coagulate near so soon as an equal quantity of the same 
milk kept by itself.
Dr. Leviris says, that dry Mint, digested in rectified 
Sjpihts <^ wine, gives out a tincture, which appears, by day.light, of a 
sne dark green, but, by candle-light, of a bright red colour.
The fact 
isy that a tmatl quanthy of this tincture is green, either by day- light or 
bf caiuUe^light, but a large quantity of it seems impervious to common 
^y-light; however, when held between, the eye and a candle, or between 
the eye and the sun, it appears red ; ^o that if put into a fiat bottle it 
appears either green, or rjcd, as it is viewed through the flat side or througii 
the edge of the bottle.

Mr. Woodward.
Mr. Woodward suspecting 
this might be distinct from the L.
purfureum, wished it to be 
cultivated in order to ascertain that point.
Mr. Robson, with 
this view, introduced it into his garden, where it has shed its 
seed, and propagated itself 3 or 4 times, and all the plants have 
been of the same kind.
It flowers and ripens its seeds, and these 
seeds produce others twice in the summer.
He further observes, 
that bosh sorts are common about Darlington, often growing to- 
gether, we may therefore conclude that the difierence is not ow- 
ing to soil and situation.

A general opinion prevails, that 
the flesh of sheep, that feed upon aromatic plants, particularly upon 
Thyme, is much superior in flavour to common mutton ; but Mr. Bowles, 
the ingenious author of the account of the Sheep-walks in Spain, (Gent, 
Mag. 1764,) considers this as a vulgar error.
He says, sheep are not fond 
of aromatic plants ; that they will carefully push aside the Thyme to 
get at the grass growing beneath it ; and that they never touch it, unless 
when walking apace, and then they will catch at any thing.
The attach- 
ment of bees to this and other aromatic plants is well known.

On the authority of Dr. Smith in the English Botany, we 
cannot hesitate to insert this new species of IV^littis, there first 
distinctly separated from the M.
Melissophyllum.
It is one of 
the most beautiful oE the plants natural to this island, and has 
been lately found by Mr. D.
Turner and Mr. Sowerby, in great 
plenty atbout a mile from Ashburton in the road towards Ply.
month, and.
also in Cornwall.
â€” Dr. Smith observes the calyx is 
4-lobed, having on each side two lateral, not vertical lobes^ some- 
times notched, but more generally entire.
The blossom is larger 
than in the more common species, white, with a pale tinge of 
yellow on the upper side, the lower lip marked witn a large un- 
divided purple spot, surrounded by a white margin.
[Cornwall and Devonshire, where it is admitted into gar-

* When the blossom falls off* the cup closes upon the seeds, which, 
when ripe, being still smaller than the cup, could not possibly open its 
mouth, or overcome its elastic force, as the down of the seeds do in the 
compound flowers, and must consequently remain useless without a pos- 
sibility of escaping.
But nature, ever full of resources, finds a method 
to discharge them.

This has been supposed to be the Thiaspi hirtum of Linn,

It is like soft velvet to the touch, 
nor are the pouches properly rough with hairs, (hirsute) they are 
only cottony in a slight degree.
It differs most obviously from 
the T.
campestre, in the root-leaves being entire, and on very 
long leaf-stalks.
It is about 10 or 12 inches high, but the Lin- 
najan Thl. hirtum is not above half so high, and has root-leaves 
inversdy-egg-shaped, and broad at the end, but in our plant they ' 
are strap-spear-shaped.

Dr. Smith observes, that Mr.
Hudson's T.
montanum is certainly the T.
alpestre of Linn, and 
that his T.
alpestre is the T.
pcrfoliatum of Linn.
Adding, 
and justly too, 'that the Botan.
Arr. ed.
ii.
misled by this auÂ« 
thority, had still further increased the confusion.
The present arrangement of these articles has been made 
without any view to Mr. Hudson's opinions, and are founded on 
the indisputable veracity, and well known accuracy of Ray, who, 
in his Synopsis, p.
305, No. 4 and 6', records two species, refer- 
ring to the same figures which Linnasus in theSp. PL has quoted 
to the Thl. montanum, and Thl. alpestre, so that I must believe * 
that Ray had seen both those species.
He also particularly no- 
tices the creeping root of the T.
montanum, a circumstance so 
inapplicable to the T.
alpestre, that Dr. Smith is obliged to sup.
pose this to be a mistake.
I am ready to allow that the Oxfordshire plants of Bobart, 
may be the T.
perfoliatum, but think it highly probable that 
those of Merret and Nicholson must have been the true T.
aU 
pestre, or else Ray and Linnaeus would hardly have agreed in 
quoting the same synonyms.

This plant is a strong instance of the influence of soil and 
situation, for it grows almost every where^ and sometimes is noc 
more than 2 inches high when it flowers and perfects its seeds.; 
whilst in other situations it attains the height of 2 or 3 feet*

The plants of this genus begin to flower lone before they 
have attained their full size, the flowers at first forming a corym*

flowering in January and February, and I never saw it there as- 
snme any otber appearance, so that concluding it to be a Coch.

Correa that it was a species unknown to the Linnacan School.
Soxbe ^eeds sown in my earden at Edgbaston in the Autunm of 
1793, produced plants which flowered in March 1794.

In 
idle inonth of May the petals became entirely white, and much 
smaller than those whicn had flowered in March : the flowers

* Nottrithstanding this is a native of the sea coast, it is cultivated in 
gardens without any sensible alteration of its properties.
It possesses a 
considerable degree of acrimony, and this acrimony seems to reside in a 
very subtile essential oil.
Its eii^cts as an anti- scorbutic are universally 
Itnown ; and it is a powerful remedy in the pituitous asthma, and in what 
Sydenham calls the scorbutic rheumatism.
A distilled water, and a con- 
jerve, are prepared from the leaves, and its juice is prescribed along with 
that of oranges, by the name of anti- scorbutic juices.

* The roots are either eaten raw, boiled, or roasted.
Pepper is com- 
monly used with them.
They relax the bowels, and are supposed to 
sweeten the blood.
They are hurtful to pregnant or hysterical women, 
and to those who are subject to flatulencies.
The fuice, well fermented, 
aftbrds by distillation an ardent spirit.
The rind is acrimonious.
If the 
roots are kept in sand, or in a cellar, during the winter, they send out .
i 
white shoots and yellowish leaves, which being rather svveet and not un- 
pleasant to the palate, are used as sallad, when other esculent plants are 
not to be had.
But the greatest use of Turneps is in feeding oxen and 
sheep in the winter.
+ Early in the spring the sea eabbage is preferred before the cultivated 
kinds ; but, when gathered on the sea coast* it must be boiled in two 
waters, to take away the saltness.
The roots may be eaten like those of 
the preceding species, but they are not so tender.
The diiterent varieties 
of cultivated garden cabbage originate from this, all of which are much 
in use at our tables.
The red cabbage is chiefly used for pickling.
In 
some countries they bury the white cab.bage when full grown in the au- 
tumn, and thus preserve it all winter.
The Germans cut them to pieces, 
and along with some aromatic herbs and salt, press them close down in a 
tub, where they soon ferment, and are then eaten under the name of Sour 
Crout.-^The cabbage, whilst young, is ibod for the Chrysomela saltatorht 
apd afterwards for the Papilio Brassica.
The former may be kept olf 
by strewing the ground witn soot ^ and it is said the latter will not touch 
the plants if they are whipped with the green boughs of elder.
If cab- 
bages are sowed or planted tor several years together in the same soil, the 
heads become smaller and the roots knotty.
This is occasioned by the 
larvae of flies.â€” A horse eat the leaves, but did iiot seem fond of them, St.
Cows grow fat upon them.

â™¦ The seeds, reduced to powder, make the common mustard so much 
in request sit our tables.
They yield a considerable quantity of expressed 
oil, which partakes but little of the acrimony of the; plant.
The seeds, 
when unbruised, impart but little taste to boiling water.
Taken iq- 
wardly, in the quantity of a meat spoonful or more, they gently loosen 
the bowels, and are of service in asthma,.
chronic rheumatism, and palsy.
The powdered seeds curdle milk, and give a strong impregnation to boil- 
ing water.
This infusion, taken in considerable quantity, vomits; in 
smaller doses, it is an useful aperient and diuretic.
Cataplasms, formed 
with crumb of bread, vinegar, and powdered mustard seed, are very com- 
monly applied to the soles of the feet, as stimulants, in fevers that rec^uire 
such treatment ; they are used with advantage, topically applied, in fixed 
rheumatic and sciatic pains.
Upon the whole, wherever we want a strong 
stimulus, that .acts upon the nervous system, without exciting much heat, 
' we kj|ow pone preferable to mustard seed.
Its acrimony consists in Â«in 
essential oil.â€” The Pbalana ful'tginosa lives upon the difierent species.

!â€¢) on Gmelin's authority * 
This plant seems to have been confounded sometimes with 
the molle, and sometimes with the rotyndifolium.
It differs 
from the former in its seed-coat being hairy and not wrinkled ; 
from the latter in its awnless calyx and its notched petals.
I 
have no doubt but it is the G.
pm'tllum of Linnaeus, represented 
in Ray l6.
% (a) and (h) ; though that being a dwarf or 
starved specimen has occasioned an improper trivial name to be 
applied to the species, and which, if continued, would infallibly 
occasion a- repetition of the same doubts and difficulties ^hicti 
have hitherto attended the subject.
I am indebted to Mr. Robson for a full grown specimen of 
this plant, as well as for the following description of it.
The root throws out many cylindrical much branched stems, 
varying in length according to the situation and soil ; procum.
bent when growing alone, but upright when growing among 
ocher plants, and frequently attainmg the height of 2 feet.
Stem 
and braiuhes just sensibly downy, and soft to the touch.
Leagues 
Iddney-shaped, deeply lobed, hairy, especially on the margin, 
jttd voins on the under sur&ce : hairs expanding.
Root and 
lower stem leanjes generally 7 -lobed; upper leaves 5 -lobed, more 
deeply divided, opposite, unequal ; lobes wedge-shaped, 3-cleft, 
Uontish.
FloraLuaves 4, awl-shaped, hairy.
Fruit-stalis al- 
ternate, axillary, upright.
Calyx hairy, awnless.
Petals in- 
versely heart-shaped, bluish purple, notched; claws upright, 
about the length of the calyx.
Stamens distinct at the base, 5 
with and 5 without anthers* Seed-coats even, covered with 
short bristles pointing upwards.
Seeds smooth.
Obs. Varies 
with leaves alternate towards the tops of the stem and branches, 
and with 3 or sometimes 4 flowers on a fruit-stalk.

Woodward.
The various appearances of this plant at different seasons and 
in different soils, and its resemblance in many respects to starved 
specimens of the G.
moschatum, have occasioned many errors.
The spots on the petals are not to be trusted, neither are the in- 
cisions of the leafits.
The musk odour of the G, moschatum, is 
the most obvious distinction.
In the G, c'tcuUirtum the leafits 
are in general more deeply and more finely cut, and shoulder up 
close to the mid-rib with hardly the appearance of a leaf-stalk, 
but in the G.
moschatum the leaf-stalks to some of the leafits are 
sufficiently obvious, and in the larger specimens the edges of the 
leafits are little more than serrated.

are, perhaps, more remarkable, or more strikingly display themselves as

Stem and lea<ves clothed witli 
a thick pile, feeling exactly like velvet.
All the /^<w:;^x obscurely 
lobed, doably serrated ; the lower egg-shaped, somewhat h^aru 
pistil at its base; each seed is covered with a distinct seed- coat peculiar 
to itselfy.
which, after having inclosed the seed, runs out in the form of a 
narrow appendage or tail, to the extremity of the style, to whiclif-,it is 
slightly connected along its whole length, and which has 5 grooves or 
flutes to receive the 5 seeds with their appendages.
Each of these ap- 
pendages has the property of contracting itself into a spiral or screw-like 
form, when dry ; and of again extending itself into a right line, when 
snoist.
In short, it is a spiral spring, which lengthens or contracts itself 
alternately, as often, and in such proportion, as it happens to become wet 
or dry.
This power first exerts itself when the seed and its appendage 
becomes dry, in consequence of arriving at maturity ; when it gradually 
separates the seed from its parent plant.
The seed, thus disengaged, is 
continuaLy contracting and dilating itself, as the weather changes firooi 
wet to dry, and from dry to wet ; and by this means is kept in motion, 
till it is either destroyed by the vicissitudes of the seasons, or meets with 
some crevice in the earth, or some light porous spot, into which it can 
easily insinuate itself, and from thence, in due time, produce a new plant.
The particular minutiae of the mechanical structure and operations of this 
curious seed will be better understood by inspection, than by the most 
accurate and laboured description : and all its manoeuvres may be seen in 
a short space of time, by alternately moistening and drying it : which may 
be readily done, by putting a little water on one edge of a white stone or 
china plate, and removing it by turns from the dry to the moist, and from 
the moist to the dry part of the plate : or the changes may still more 
quickly be produced, by removing it from the wet to a fresh plate, and 
drying it before a fire.
I mention a white plate, because on that, I imaÂ« 
gine, the fine hairs which display themselves from the sides of the tail, as 
that contracts, and which act as fulcra, or feet, to assist and direct the seed 
in its motions, are most easily distinguished.

On bogs or dry mountains it

It is often planted

It is converted into 
Tjows, axle-trees, spoons, cups, cogs for mill-wheels and flood- gates for

* It floUnshes best In a poor sandy soil.
In a grove, the trunk beÂ« 
eomes tall and naked ; in sunny open places, branched.
On rocks or 
bogSt it seldom attains a large size.
In black soil it becomes diseased* 
and in chalky land it dies.
Sometimes it will thrive near running, but 
acfer near stagnant waters.
None but the terminating buds send forth 
temches, therefore it will not bear the least clipping.
The roots spread 
very near to the surface of the earth, all but the central root, which grows 
perpendicularly downwards ; and if this is broken off, or interr-upted ia 
Its passage by roeks, the stem ceases to shoot upwards, and the tree for 
ever remains a dwarfs Upon this account it is apt to su^r by transplant, 
iog.
â€” ^This tree furnishes us with the best red or yellow deal.
It is 
smooth, light, and easily cloven.
The bark will tan leather.
â€” The in- 
habitants of the North of Europe make bread from this tree in the follow- 
ing manner.
They choose a tree whose trunk is even, for these contain 
the least resin, and strip off the bark in the spring when it separates most 
leadily.
This they first dry gently in the steide ; then in a greater heat ; 
and reduce it to powder.
With this powder they mix a small quantity 
ofcom-meal, and with water knead it into bread.
This they eat, not 
only in years of scarcity, but at other times, from an apprehension that 
long disuse might render it disagreeable to them.
Their children are very 
fond of the fresh bark in the spring time, ether shaved with a knife or 
grated with a raspâ€” the young shoots distilled afibrd a fragrant essential 
oil.â€” Sheep and goats are not fond of it ; horses refuse it.

The plantÂ» 
when burnt) affords a tolerably pure alcallne salt.
Dr. Mead relates the 
case df a dropsical patient that was cured by taking half a pint of a de- 
coction of green Broom tops, with a spoonful of whole Mustard seed, 
every morning and evening.
The patient had been tapped three times, 
and tried the usual remedies before, (^onlta et practft, medica, p.
138./ 
An infusion of the seeds, drank freely, has been known to produce similar 
happy effects ; but, whoever expects these effects to follow inevery drop- 
sical case will be greatly deceived.
1 knew them succeed in one case that 
was truly deplorable t but out of a great number of cases, in which tht 
medicine had a fair trial, thi^ proved a single instance.
A strong lixivium 
of the ashes was used in the Swedish army, in the year i759Â» to cure 
dropsies consequential to a catarrhal epidemic fever.
The urine becamis 
plentiful, and the dropsies soon disappeared.

Some use the seeds toasted, so as to make a kind of coffee.
The plant, 
when growing large, merits a place among our flowering shrubs, on ac- 
count of the profusion of its golden coloured blossoms.
Cows, horses, and 
sheep refuse it.
Linn.
The Fbmlana phi feeds upon it.
When the seeds 
are fully ripe and the legumen becomes black, it has the power of discharg- 
ing its contents to a considerable distance around by a peculiar elisti^ 
movement.
+ A yellow colour may be prepared from the flowers, and for wool that 
is to be dyed green, the dyers prefer it to all others.
A dram and a half, 
of the powdered seeds j operates as a mild purgative.
A decoction of the 
plant is sometimes diuretic, and therefore has proved serviceabk ia dropÂ« 
sicÂ«l cases.
Horses, cows, goats, and sheep eat it.

that the U, europaus had a pair of distinct scales at the base of 
the calyx, whidi are pale and deciduous like the leaves ; but th^ 
the U.
nanus has a pair of dark-coloured spots, not deciduous.
These when examined under a glass are really scales, but very 
minute.
The calyx in this species is scarcely at all woolly.
Both species vary muck as to hairiness, as well as in the length 
of their thorns ; but the luxuriant and more upright growth of 
the former is strongly contrasted by the dwarfish and stunted ap- 
pearance of the latter.

* Shoots earlier in the spring than any other plant eaten by cattle, ve.
setates late in the autumn, and'continues green all winter.
But it is dif- 
ficult to collect the seeds, as the pods burst and scatter them about, and 
moreover, hardly a third part of them will vegetate, being made the nidus 
of an insect.
A patch of them sown in drills in a garden was cut ^ 
times in the course of^ the second year, and produced at the rate of 24 
tons per acre of green food, which when dry would weigh near 4f tons.

Mr. Woodward.
It is evident that specific charac-

Uralensis, do not apply well to Mr. Light foot's plant, in which 
the stalks are but little longer than the leaves, and the leafits 
rarely exceed 20 in number.
But it is equally clear that the 
figure of Haller, which Linnaeus refers to, belongs to Lightfoot's 
highland plant, so that whatever mistake exists about it, our bo* 
tanists are not responsible; and indeed the greater number of 
errors into which tney have fallen, seem to have originated with 
Linnaeus himself.
Whether our plant was at all known to him, 
can only be determined by his own herbarium.

" A 
var.
of Trifolium pratense with a yellowish white flower, found 
in a field belonging to Tracy Park, near Bath.
I am confident 
it is a Var. of Tr. pratense, as it exactly resembled that specie^ 
in every thing but colour, and was the only plant of that colour 
in the whole neld ; indeed the only one I have ever seen." 
On comparing the specimens sent by Mr. Swayne with the 
Tr. pratense, and Tr. ochroleucum, I am persuaded that his opi- 
nion is perfectly right.
The structure in all respects corresponds 
with the former, wanting the general hairiness, the long awns to 
the stipulae, and the very long tooth of the calyx so striking in 
the latter*

* Modern writers upon husbandry strongly recommend the cultiva- 
. tton of this plant, for the purpose of feeding cattle, but it is net yet fe- 
sierally adopted, though in the neighbourhood of London people stsaa to 
be aware of its merit.
It requires a deep rich soil, and, in such, Â¥rill 
continue to flourish many years, perhaps forever, if kept free from weeds.
One pound of Lucerne seed contains about 150,000 seeds, so that, sup- 
posing only one seed in three to vegetate and to survive accidents, one 
pound would produce 50,000 plants.
Millar adduces various interesting 
facts relative to its utility^ and we have ascertsdned that half an acre i 
Lucerne, the rows eighteen inches asunder, and the plants nine inches 
apart, will support a pair of chaise-horses, (cut and brought to them in 
the stable,) without any corn or hay, in good.
working condition, fas 
twenty weeks, that is from June to October inclusive, and they prefer it 
to any other kind of tbod.
It should be given cautiously at first, as it 
then proves a powerful diuretic : and too great abundance will in soBoe 
horses occasion the staggers!
Pigs devour it greedily, and cows fatten 
on it.
f In hot, dry, barren sandy places it is well worth the trsiUkfeiBf 
sowing for the purpose of making hay.
A practice long since adopt|MliS 
some parts of Sweden.
Cows, horses, goatsÂ» and sheep eat it.

* This plant has long held a place in the materia medica, but its use 
is very, much undetermined.
The semi-transparent dots on the leaves, 
are the receptacles of an essential oil.
The leaves given in substance, are 
said to destroy worms.
The flowers tinge spirits and oils of a fine purple 
colour, which is probably derived from the little glands upon the anthers, 
and upon the edges of the petals.
Cows, goats, and sheep eat it.
Horses 
and swine refuse it.â€” On the Eve of St. John the Baptist, the i>eople of 
â€¢ North Wales fix sprigs of this plant over their doors, and sometimes over 
their windows, in order to purify their houses, and by that means drive

I found this singular variety on Portland Island in the month

calyxes smooth^ as in the other varieties of the Sonchus oleraceusi 
but the flowers sat dose upon the root.
This circumstance' may 
possibly be the efiect of its maritime situation^ but if not, ft 
may prove to be a new species^ as is not improtxible^ because I 
have observed some other varieties assume their usual habit^ and 
their usual size> when growing near the sea, only sometimes the 
whole plant> except the blossom^ in such situations^ assumes a 
purplish red colour.*

The expressed

Mr. Ray thought this plan^

However this may be, the alpine plant we now speak of most not

. * The leaves and flowers are very bitter ; the roots are warm and aro- 
matic.
A considerable quantity of essential oil rises from it in distilla- 
tion.
This oil is used both externally and internally to destroy worms.
The leaves, put into sour beer, soon destroy the acescency.
They resist 
putrefaction, and are therefore a principal ingredient in antiseptic fomen- 
tations.
An infusion of them is a good stomachic, and with the addition 
of fixed alkaline salt, a powerful diuretic in some dropsical cases.
The 
4$hes afibrd a more pure alkaline salt than most other vegetables, except- 
ing Bean-stalks, Broom, and the larger trees.

p. 160, Linnaeus mentions two cases, wherein an essence prepared from 
this plant, and taken for a considerable' time, prevented the formation of 
stones in the kidneys or bladder ; the patients forbearing the use of wine 
and acids.
It might be suspected that, like other bitters, its long conti- 
liued use must weaken the action of the nervous system, but in these m- 
itances no such eftect took place.
An infusion of it given to a woman 
that suckles, makes her milk bitter.
It gives a bitterness to the fle<Â»h of 
sheep that eat it.
â€” Horses and goats are not fond of it ; cows and swine 
ftfuse it.
LtKN.

Mr. Hollefear.

The plant steeped in boiling water, and repeatedly applied to a bruise, 
will remove the pain in a short time, and prevent the sw^elling and dis- 
coloration of the part.

The thick-headed club-like summit I believe may be

propriety of removing this genus to the order Polygamla necessaria.
How they are propagated, unless by lateral shoots, I do not 
know, but this will not account for its general diflution over the 
island, unless we suppose that, in this country, as well as in 
Switzerland and Sweden, they sometimes produce a few female

â€¢ The leares and flowers have a strong, not ungrateful smell, and t 
bitter nauseous taste.
They afibrd an essential oil.
An infusion of the 
flowers is often used as a stomachic, and as an antispasmodic.
In large 
quantities^ it excites vomiting.
The powdered flowers, in large doses, 
have puied agues, even when the bark had failed.
Both the leaves and 
flowers possess very considerable antiseptic properties, and are therefore 
used in antiseptic fomentations, and poultices.
From their antispasmodic 
powers, they are frequently found to relieve pain, either applied externally, 
or taken intemaily.

* The expressed juice of the petals is a good blue ink : it stains linen 
of a beautiful blue, but the colour is not permanent in the mode it has 
hitherto been applied.
Mr. Boyle says, the juice of the central florets, 
-with the addition of a very small quantity of alum, makes a lasting 
transparent blue not inferior to ultramarine.

â™¦ This is a very common plant in the cornfields and in the vineyards 
in Portugal, and is used as food for milking cows.
The milk yielded by 
the cows which arc fed upon it, is very good.
When we consider the 
constant intercourse kept up between Portugal and Falmouth, it rs not 
improbable that the seeds of the plants I (ound might have been im- 
ported from thence : and in a similar manner have several other exotics 
probably been introduced, and in time become naturalized ; and this con.
^ecture is particularly illustrated by the various other foreign plants now to

We are favoured with the following Curious description, and 
the very accurate drawing, engraved on Plate XXX, p.
621, by 
Jambs Norris, Esq^ " In the month of March 1794^ being 
on a boggy spot of ground near Bromham, where a small stream^ 
by a continued action on the loose soil beneath, had formed a 
deep channel, my attention was soon directed to the roots of an 
Eqoisetum, growing abundantly on the brink of both its per* 
pendicular sides ; which presented them laid bare to view^ and 
oeansed by the passage of the water* The roots which, as in 
all the species of this gentis^ are jointed like the stem, were sur.
rounded at their joints by a Series of 6, 7> or 8 bulbs, arranged 
vert icillately,.
sessile, and about the size of a nutmeg, but shaped 
like a fig, with a prominent umbilicus at the larger end; when 
young of a tawny orown colour and downy, when old black and 
smooth : the pulp within white, and similar in consistence to 
apple or potatoe.
In the succeeding month of April, I had the 
pleasure to observe many of these bodies in a state of vegetation, 
some still attached to the parent root^ others separate.
The 
young plants were then about a finger's length ; issuing from the 
umbilicus at the great end, from whence also radical fibres were 
protruded downwards ; and this accompanied with a propor* 
tionable loss of juice in the sustaining bulb.
These were very 
difiecent in strength, size, and appearance, from the recent shoots 
immediately proceeding out of the parent root.
None of the 
bulbs were found within a foot or more of the horizontal surface 
of the earth.
In the lower figure of the drawing is represented a 
transverse section of the root, encircled by a whirl of bulbs> 
which in number generally correspond with the radial partitions 
of Q* 7$ ^> &c- The upper figure exhibits a portion of the root 
wit4 only two bulbs, to avoid confusion, in a state of vegeta- 
tion :^-^These bulbs differ much in dimensions from the size of 
peas to i of an inch in diapieter.
If the foil grown bulbs be 
detached and placed in a vessel of water, the process of vegeta^ 
tioD may be conveniently attended to ; fi^r the young shoots, in 
a few days, will burst from the umbilical prominence, accompanied 
by their radical filaments.
Smooth HorsetaiL Common in the beds of rivers near the 
banks : also shallow pond9> and ditches in marshes.

This plant, though before not to 
be found for many miles around Birmingham, lately appeared on 
a butt on Mosely Common, artificially made with mud from 
a deep pit, in which the seeds had probably lain for a great length 
of time.
It continued to flourish so long as the butt was perÂ« 
mitted to remain, but has prpbably now again disappeared.
By 
such accidental circumstances may many apparent errors in the 
loci natales of plants often be accounted for.

character of that genus, or is disposed along the edge of the leaf

in the Hlgmands of Scotland ; but though this descriptipn and 
his specific character mention it being doubly winged^ neither his 
own figurey nor the specimens sent out in his Fasciculi of dried

!â€¢ 
p. 3 ; who believes it, on the authority of the Linn, herbarium 
to be the Br. viridulum of Linnaeus, whose synonym, he thinks 
are erroneous, and have misled our botanists.
I am far from 
doubting the well known accuracy of Mr. Dickson, bat it is as 
â€¢ easy to suppose a mistake existing in the Herbarium as in the 
Spi PI.
and I the rather believe this to be the case, because the 
specific char* of the Br. viridulum with *' tiled leaves," does 
not at all apply to Mr. Dickson's plant With- only .3 Or 4 leaves 
placed regularly at the top of the root, though truly descriptive of 
the plant Linn, refers to in his synonyms.
Under the eiusting 
circumstances it seems necessary to give it a new trivial name, 
the Br. Dicksoniy and I exped Br.
'viridulum being allotted to 
other species.
Fortunately the circumstance of its having only 
4 or 5 leaves, allows us to adopt a name unobjectionable^ and ex- 
pressive.

than spear-shapedi but I cannot perceive any good grounds for 
a specific difference.

LlNif.
In the autumn of 1788, some plants of the Sphagnum alpi- 
num which I brought from Showden were placed in a shady cor- 
ner under a water spout ; the result was a conviction that the 
Sphagnum alpinum is only a variety of the Br. flexuosum.
Its 
luxuriant growth in bogs accounts for its want of capsules.
Thus the Polytrich commune, on the quaking bogs of Delamere 
Forest, often grows to the length of | of a yard, but in that state 
it never bears fruit.
Mr. Griffith.
Obs. When the Br. flexuosum is moist, the capsules lie con- 
cealed amongst the leaves by a singular hygromctric quality in 
the fruit-stalk ; but as the moisture exhales, they become nearly 
npright by several spiral revolutions from the right to the left.
la Mn. heteromallum the revolutions of the fruit^stalk are from 
the left to the right.

The fringe is without doubt simple.
The young

Dickson are only produced when the plant is placed in a moist 
and somewhat warm situation, almost entirely secluded from light 
and air,, neither are they peculiar to this species, for I have 
produced them in Mnium purpureum, &c.
&:c.
merely by placing 
it in such situations as I have described : in all cases where 
these are produced, I have further remarked that they invariably 
point in that direction from whence the very small portion of

the experiment was made in it.
