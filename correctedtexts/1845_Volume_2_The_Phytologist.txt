" This constitution of Nature, whereby a mental impulse is required to direct and 
excite muscular action, points to the propriety of teaching the young to observe and 
examine the qualities and arrangements of external objects.
The most pleasing and 
healtliful exercise may thus be secured, and every step be made to add to useful know- 
ledge and individual enjoyment.
The botanist, the geologist and the natural histo- 
rian, experience pleasures in their walks and rambles, of which, from disuse of their 
eyes and observing powers, the multitude is deprived." â€” Coombe.

PREFACE.
^v^^fi^e^^ 
Having received many hints that an annual Index would be accep- 
table to my readers, and an annual tome more convenient than the 
bulky one which was concluded in 1844, I have unhesitatingly com- 
plied, and propose in future to bind each twelve numbers separately, 
although the pages will for some time be continuous.
All the papers 
published prior to the close of 1844 may be referred to, as in Volume 
I., and all since that date, and until further notice, as in Volume II.
I believe botanists throughout the kingdom will bear testimony to 
the increased value of the present Volume.
The ' Phytologist ' has 
now become, what I have always wished it to be, the medium through 
which all our British botanists communicate with the public.
It is 
true a few papers on British Botany still find their way into print 
through other channels, but when this is the case I consider it an 
imperative duty to notice them in these pages, giving an abstract of 
anything that I esteem worthy of preservation, and thus I endeavour 
to make the 'Phytologist' a complete register of the Botany of Britain.
The subject of British Botany is comparatively so limited, that a 
single periodical, of moderate size, trifling cost, and very humble 
appearance and pretensions, is quite sufficient to embrace the whole, 
and while I hope never uncourteously to reject contributions on 
foreign Botany, I wish my contributors to understand, that my desire 
is to give a decided preference to that of our own country.
I beg to acknowledge with gratitude the strenuous support and 
assistance I have received during the year, which is now drawing to 
a close : it has been peculiarly marked by the expression of good 
will towards this undertaking ; and, though I have generally judged 
VI 
it best to erase the complimentary expressions of my friends from 
their various communications, I have not been the less sensible of 
the kindness intended.
With respect to lists of plants my views may be peculiar, but T 
cannot refrain from expressing my satisfaction at the great decrease 
in the number of these transmitted to me for publication.
I am not 
aware of the utility of these lists as generally published.
Were they 
restricted to species of excessive rarity which had not previously been 
detected in the stations pointed out, I can easily conceive an interest 
attaching to such records, more particularly if they extend the geo- 
graphical or geological limits of a species.
Or, on the other hand, 
were such lists complete, as far as regards any precisely defined or 
geographically circumscribed region, a degree of value would certain- 
ly attach to them.
But they rarely possess either of these qualifica- 
tions : a number of the very commonest species and a few rarities 
are usually given, whilst an equal number of equally common species 
are omitted, species, the absence of which would be a most interesting 
fact, and worthy of comment, but which are omitted only through 
want of care in the compilation, and neither on account of their uni- 
versal occurrence, nor on account of their entire absence.
Under 
these circumstances such lists appear to me scarcely truthful.
The 
occurrence of such names as those of groundsel and chickweed leads 
one to suppose that all species have been included, or wherefore these ?
And the absence of these names, while others equally common are 
given, induces the erroneous conclusion that the plants also are 
absent.
1 also find that in many instances, the names of rarities 
have been given without sufficient care, the plants often turning out 
to have been wrongly named or notoriously introduced.
I have again to acknowledge the obligation I am under to Mr. Lux- 
ford for the great care displayed in his editorial superintendence.
I can scarcely conclude these observations without a passing 
notice of the ,vast benefit which has lately been conferred on British 
Vll 
botanists by the Messrs.
Bentall, of Halstead, in the manufacture of a 
paper perfectly adapted to the drying of plants.
This had long been 
our chief desideratum, and it is now thoroughly supplied : there 
will no longer be any excuse for those discoloured, distorted, unin- 
telligible specimens which previously constituted the bulk of all our 
herbaria.
I hope that in thus bearing my humble testimony to the 
merits of Messrs.
Bentalls' paper, botanists will not suspect me of 
mercenary motives.
The small revenue derived from the sale of this 
paper in London would not induce me to recommend it: but justice 
to the inventors demands that the influence of the ' Phy tologist ' 
should be employed in extending as much as possible the utility of 
their labours.

PREFACE.
Another year has closed.
Its botanical events have not been 
without interest : they have been faithfully chronicled in the pages 
of the ' Phy tologist.' 
The most prominent subject has been the failure of the potato : 
and unwilling as I have shown myself to become alarmist on this 
subject, I cannot shut my eyes to the consequences it has produced.
The present deplorable state of Ireland appears mainly, if not entire- 
ly, attributable to this cause.
What is wanted for that wretched 
country is not hypothesis, but food, and he who gives according to 
his ability, to save his wretched fellow-creatures from starvation, will 
surely reap the reward of an approving conscience.
It is in vain for 
us to discuss problems either in politics or Natural History while the 
objects interested in the discussion are perishing around us.
The disease in question, although so greatly aggravated of late, is 
not of that recent date which has been generally imagined.
When 
in the west of Ireland, in 1839, I found that the potato had almost 
entirely failed ; many fields exhibited large, bare patches, where the 
haulm had disappeared, and in other places the haulm was black- 
ened, the leaves presenting an appearance of being scorched or frost- 
bitten.
In the vicinity of Waterford the crop, though not perhaps so 
abundant as in former years, was sufficient to allow a large export 
to the west.
The price at Waterford was 3d.
^ stone of 14 fts., 
while at Clifden it was 7^d., a difference swhich of course led to the 
export of large quantities.
These remarks were printed at the time.
VI 
but excited no kiiitl of interest, and I only allude to them for the 
purpose of showing that the failure of the crop has not been so sud- 
den as it is generally supposed.
Even from the excess of evil may 
arise some good : perhaps this sad lesson may teach the poor Irish- 
man to depend less entirely on the potato and more on the labour of 
his hands as a means of sustenance.
The Rubus fruticosus has obtained an unusual share of regard, and 
Mr. Babington has put forth an ingenious pamphlet on its so-called 
species and varieties.
Admitting the full merit of Mr. Babington's 
essay as a lucid resume of prior publications, accompanied by judi- 
cious original remarks; I still venture to doubt its utility as a contri- 
bution to science, believing that the descriptions apply, in almost 
every instance, to individuals, or to some half-dozen or dozen some- 
what similar individuals, and not to those larger groups of indivi- 
duals which appear under the same constant form in all parts of the 
kingdom, and which perpetuate that form from generation to genera- 
tion.
I think we are quite without proof that any species, subspecies 
or variety of the common bramble transmits its characters to its de- 
scendants : in fact, the few experiments within the range of ray own 
experience go to prove that the forms of brambles are not transmit- 
table by seed, but that the produce of one form exhibits many forms.
I am aware that portions of an individual retain the peculiarities of 
that individual, but this appears very unimportant ; for our apples, 
pears, gooseberries, dahlias, calceolarias and fuchsias do the same.
The three controverted British species of CEnanthe have been 
again discussed, and it has become evident that the perfectly simple 
roots, as compared with others partially incrassated, do not indicate 
specific distinction.
It appears that the roots of all the species are, 
if not invariably, at least generally, perfectly simple at first.
The 
error has arisen from contrasting different states or stages of growth : 
a practice of which I have frequently ventured to disapprove, sug- 
gesting that the objects compared should always be in a correspond- 
ing state as regards their approach towards maturity.
vu 
I have felt greatly interested in Mr. Watson's discovery that our 
beautiflil Lastraja recurva is known and described as a native of 
Madeira ; but, highly as I value that gentleman's judgment, I cannot 
agree in his proposed alteration of the name.
It is quite evident that 
Mr. Lowe's name of Nephrodium fcenesecii var.
alaium is intended 
for the plant in question : it is equally evident that Mr. Bree described 
the same species as Aspidimn dilatatum var.
recurvum : I believe, 
although it appears quite immaterial, that Mr, Bree's name has the 
claim of priority.
Without any knowledge of Mr. Lowe's description, 
I described the fern as a species in 1844, adopting the name under 
which Mr. Bree had previously described it as a variety.
An inspec- 
tion of numerous specimens has convinced me that Mr. Lowe's 
Nephrodium fcenesecii is a mere repetition of the Polypodium crista- 
tum of Linneus, the Aspidilum spinulosum and dilatatum of later 
authors.
Supposing Mr. Watson to be right in his view when he says, 
" I consider Mr. Lowe to have been correct, not in error, when he in- 
cluded a triangular [recurva] and oblong [multiflora] form of frond 
under one specific name," (Phytol.
ii.
568), I then claim the right of 
going back to the oldest name given to the same assemblage of forms : 
supposing Mr. Watson mistaken, then he will not deny me the credit 
of singling out the triangular form, and being the first to describe it as 
a species : Mr. Lowe truly singles it out many years previously, but 
only as a variety^ and in this Mr. Watson says he is " correct^ not in 
error r The matter must now be left for others to decide ; I should 
not have thus called attention to it a second time, had it not been in- 
timated to me that my silence was interpretated as an assent to Mr.
Watson's views.
It seems desirable to give annually a brief outline of additions to 
the British Flora, and as this was omitted from last year's address, the 
subjoined discoveries extend over a longer space of time.
It will be 
recollected by most of oiu* readers that the ' London Catalogue of 
British Plants ' brought down the list of recorded species to the close 
of 1843.
In April, 1846, the Botanical Society of London issued a 
circular (See Phytol.
ii.
542), embracing, amid other information, a 
Vlll 
list of the species and varieties communicated to the Society since the 
publication of the ' Catalogue ' : these were seventeen in number, as a 
list of novelties it might still be considered incomplete, inasmuch as 
the Society had not then received various plants for which a claim to 
be considered British had previously been made.
The subjoined list 
from the pages of the ' Phytologist ' is somewhat more comprehensive 
and complete.

640, by Mr. Williamson, near Epsom, 
Siurrey.
Achillea tanacetifolia, ii.

near Maltock, Derbyshire : this plant is first recorded as 
Achillea serrata, but is subsequently coiTectly named by Mr.
Notcutt, (Phytol.
ii.
724).
It will be observed that the foregoing list contains plants that may 
be arranged under three heads ; Jtrst, European old species newly 
discovered to be natives ; secondly, exotic species introduced by 
accident or design, but not to be regarded as natives ; and thirdly, 
new species created by the division of old ones.
It is not my desire, 
nor do I consider it my duty, to analyze the list and place each plant 
under its respective head : let eveiy botanist weigh the evidence be- 
fore him and draw his own conclusions.
h 
I have further to notice a li:-t entitled " Some of the more recent and 
interesting additions to the British Flora," which has just been pub- 
lished in the 'Naturalist's Almanack' for 1847.
In this meagre 
summary the author has omitted, either by design or through igno- 
rance, the more important additions recorded in the ' Phytologist,' but 
has included the following names, to which I believe the pages of the 
' Phytologist ' have not alluded.
Sedutn purpureum, (Tausch.) This is the well-known Sedum 
Telephium of British authors : the slight variety to which the 
name of pui"]3ureum has been given, is cultivated by Mr.
Cameron in the Botanic Garden at Birmingham : I have 
known it for many years, and have no inclination to admit it 
as a species.
Valeriana samhucifolia, (Mikan).
This was pronounced by De 
Candolle to be identical with our Valeriana officinalis, and I 
believe our best botanists coincide in this view.
Orobanche arenaria, (Bork.) This plant appears to be identical 
with Orobanche casrulea of British authors.
Linaria supiua, (Desf.) A species introduced with foreign grain, 
Carex Persoonil, (Sieber).
A name only, as regards this country, 
and erroneously applied to a dwarf form of Carex cm'ta found 
in the Highlands of Scotland.
Besides these, Carex Grahami (Boott), appears in the list.
This 
plant has been known for so mau}^ years that it can scarcely be re- 
corded as a novelty, although Dr. Boott has only given it a name 
within the last five.
(See Phytol.
i. 910).
It was formerly held to be a 
large variety of C.
puUa or C.
saxatilis ; but it wdl be seen by a refe- 
rence to the ' Phytologist,' that it has there been accepted as a speciej^j 
on the authority of Dr. Boott, whose acquaintance with the genus is I 
believe unrivalled.
Professor Lindley's admirable work, the ' Vegetable Kingdom ' gives 
a lustre to the year in which it was published.
It is by far the most 
valuable contribution to botanical science that this country has pro- 
XI 
duced ; and will at once take precedence of all our other publications 
on the same subject ; nay, more than this, it will occupy in Botany 
the same ground that the lamented Cuvier made so completely his 
own in the sister science of Zoology.
This great work has furnished 
me with the means of testing the applicability of my views of System 
to the Vegetable Kingdom : and there appears to be no shadow of 
doubt, but that, with the kind and active assistance of Mr. Luxford, I 
shall be able to deduce iiTcsistible evidence of their truth, from 
a source to which I had never previously looked for support.
I am not, however, so sanguine as to hope any speedy or general 
adoption of my views, however clearly they may be set forth, â€” however 
iiTCsistible the evidence may appear to the candid enquirer.
There is 
a scientific power in this country far above the reach of truth, â€” a 
power which refuses to acknowledge the worth of all that does not 
emanate from itself.
It is the bane of science ; the great stumbling 
block in the student's path ; the bitter blast that wi'aps energy, 
genius, and originality in its icy embrace.
But for this scientific 
power, this patronising authority, this chilly influence, this machinery 
of mental conservatism, we should have taken the same lead in science 
which has been ours in other matters : we should have long since 
possessed our ' Vegetable Kingdom' : and the 'Animal Kingdom ' too 
might also have been ours !
Aye !
more than this, we should have 
lately had the surpassing honor of calculating a planet into existence.
But alas !
how few in this countiy pause to enquire into worth or truth.
The only query is whether the author belongs to the clique that arro- 
gates to itself the privilege of dispensing scientific reputation.
While 
this intolerant spirit exists, the energetic labourer has only to perse- 
vere ; and let him regard the ' Vegetable Kingdom ' as a bright 
example of the success attending perseverance : throughout his war- 
fare Mr. Lindley has stood alone : he owes nothing but opposition to 
the Fadladeens of Science.
In our endeavours to trace the existence of a System in the Vege- 
table Kingdom, it becomes necessary to institute a rigid comparison 
between the results obtainable in both.
It seems to be a postulate of 
the true System that a natural gioup resolves itself into four others, 
Xll 
whereof one shall be normal or typical, i.
e. possessing the attributes 
of the group in the highest degrees, while the remaining three are dis- 
crepant among themselves, abnormal as regards the whole, and double 
as regards their composition, each dividing into two, and these halves 
being again divisible by four.
In order, therefore, to pursue the en- 
quiry, we must successfully show that the exogens naturally divide 
into four minor groups, whereof one is typical and exhibits the per- 
fection of exogenous stmctme, and this typical group of exogens must 
again submit to a quaternary division, and so must we pursue the sub- 
ject until we finally place a single species on the central throne of the 
vegetable kingdom, with the same certainty we feel in assigning to 
man the same unquestionable superiority in the animal.
The time will 
come when this enquiry will be pushed forward with a vigour and 
assiduity equal to that lately displayed in fixing on a central sim ; and 
the time will also arrive, sooner or later, when the interest felt in the 
enquiry will be at least as great.
The postulates of a central tree may 
be difficult to define ; and in this, as in all questions of the kind, we 
must carefully weigh the evidence on every side, and we must ever 
pay the most profound respect to those opinions of botanists which 
have been expressed irrespective of any intention to advocate 
particular systems : in this matter Mr. Lindley is a safe and able 
guide.
I find that an opinion prevails with some of the contributors to the 
* Phytologist' that details of botanical rambles, &c.
are not acceptable : 
this opinion is erroneous ; some of the best papers in the magazine 
may be classed under this head.
An objection has certainly been 
made to the introduction of puerilities and worn -out truisms into these 
communications ; but I have never received the slightest criticism on 
papers, the object of which was to detail botanical facts or observa- 
tions.
It would of course be a most ungracious task to point out 
papers, or parts of papers, which swerv e from the path of instmction 
and utility, but it is a pleasant one to call attention to a communica- 
tion which may serve as a model for this kind of writing : I allude to 
that by the Rev. W.
S. Hore, entitled " A day's botanizing on the 
XIU 
Lizard," (Phytol.
ii.
235).
In this commumcation there is scarcely 
an irrelevant word, and certainly no sentence of any length that does 
not leave the reader impressed with some fact or suggestion worthy of 
being remembered.
There are many papers of the same kind to 
which I might invite attention, but this strikes me as the best example 
of what the record of a ' botanical ramble ' ought to be : everything 
worthy of publication should be published ; eveiything trite, or com- 
mon-place, or puerile, or personal, suppressed.
Were these observa- 
tions kept in view, I feel confident that no one would ever dissent 
from the opinion, that the record of a botanical ramble is both 
agreeable and useful.
I am the more anxious to reiterate this statement, 
which has already appeared on the wi-apper of a monthly number, fi-om 
the circumstance that the dissemination of the opinion above alluded 
to, has had the effect of deterring several contributors from sending 
their observations, under the fear that these might not appear of suffi- 
cient scientific value in the eyes of the Editor ; and thus, as I am led 
to believe, the ' Phytologist ' has been deprived of many interesting 
and instructive papers which would otherwise have adorned its pages : 
and let me remind my correspondents that this is not the only loss, for 
in consequence of this defalcation, the quantity of matter in each 
monthly number has decreased, a circumstance fully as much at 
variance with my wishes as with those of the kind subscribers who 
have supported the work fi-om its commencement.

P RE F AC E.
During the present year the attention of naturalists has been pub- 
licly invited to the increased and increasing disposition on the part of 
the aristocracy to exclude men of science from their domains ; thus 
the botanist is forbidden to wander over the naked hills of Scotland, 
and the habitats of our rarest plants are closed against his approach.
In days when our nobles, glorying in their shame, thought it un- 
worthy of their rank to be able to read or write, and kept a menial 
for the discharge of all such degrading duties ; when they hanged 
witches and burned heretics, it would have been in keeping to close 
Glen Tilt and Braemar against the collector of herbs, least he should 
bewitch the heathen, or practise some occult art on the red grous or 
deer : but now when even dukes can read and write, when the 
sciences of Botany and Geology are taught in our universities, when 
our aristocracy generally are as well educated as our tradesmen, this 
ostracism of science from their homesteads is an inexplicable return 
to the loathsome practices of that feudalism which marked the most 
degraded era of the human mind.
The deed is rendered still more 
obnoxious from the frivolity of the plea : geologists and botanists are 
proclaimed poachers ; are placed on a level with the midnight deer- 
stealer : the absurdity of the charge is only equalled by the ignorance 
which it discloses.
I rejoice to see the matter taken in hand by our 
journalists, and trust it will not be abandoned until the universal cry 
of " shame " has penetrated the ears of the titled leaders in this 
crusade against science.
The year which is now drawing to a close has been one of conside- 
rable interest to the British botanist, and the *Phytologist' has taken 
its accustomed lead in recording new discoveries and reviewing new 
VI 
publications.
It is by this means that it retains a position in the 
scientific literature of the day, truly gratifying to its proprietor, a posi- 
tion to which his own labours have contributed so little, that he feels 
he may, without any breach of decorum, boast of a success for which 
he is so completely indebted to the assistance of his friends.
The 
utility of a journal which brings its information almost up to the day 
on which the subscriber receives it, cannot be called in question; and 
it is with great pleasure that I perceive on a reference to the dates of 
the papers published during the present year, that thirteen days is 
the average time between writing and publication : if this despatch be 
contrasted with the sluggish movements of publishing Societies or 
more technical periodicals, a reason for the preference given by our 
botanists to the ' Phytologist' is at once disclosed.
A paper is des- 
patched to the ' Phytologist' not merely in the belief, but in the know- 
ledge, that it will appear in the number that next issues from the press.
A striking feature in the present volume is the importance and ad- 
mirable character of the reviews, for most of which I am indebted to 
the kindness of contributors.
1 have always seen the advantage 
that must accrue from obtaining reviews from competent pens, and 
1 have only trusted my own to criticise the labours of others when I 
have felt myself on safe ground.
I wish in this place also to remark 
that the observations on System which occur in the notice of Steele's 
* Hand-book of Field Botany ' are liom the pen of a kind contributor 
whose important services I have often had occasion to notice during 
the progress of this journal.
The botanical, books of the year are : â€” 
Cyhele Britannica, by H.
C. Watson, Phytol.
ii.
782.
This work 
is replete with information on the geographical distribution of British 
plants ; it also contains valuable remarks on species and species- 
making.
Vegetable Physiology, hy Arthnr Henfrey, ii.
804.
A very useful 
book to the student of structural Botany.
Mantial of British Botany, by Charles Cardale Babinyton, second 
Vll 
edition, ii.
843-851.
A work that the British botanist must possess : 
it is essential to a knowledge of the Botany of these Islands.
Hand-book of Field Botany, by W.
E. Steele, ii.
987.
This work 
omits a very great portion of the more useful parts of Hooker's Flora 
and Babington's Manual, and contains no useful additions to make 
amends: it appears ill-adapted for students, the arrangement of matter 
being obscure, and in many instances unintelligible.
Circulation of the Sap, by G.
Rainey, ii.
1027.
A little essay 
showing great patience and research, although I am not fully pre- 
pared to assert that the author's conclusions are satisfactory.
London Catalogue of British Plants, second edition, ii.
1051.
Every botanist must possess it.
The original communications are still more replete with interest 
than the reviews, and T trust that the extracts fiom other sources will 
also be perused with satisfaction.
Having undertaken the publication 
of a periodical like the ' Phytologist,' it appears desirable to collect 
from all sources such information as may be acceptable to my readers.
Although always reluctant to single out contributions for especial 
notice, I cannot refrain from inviting the most studious attention to 
Mr. Wilson's Papers on Embryology : these papers must occupy a 
higher place in the scientific literature of the year than any that have 
appeared during the same period : our country has reason to be proud 
of such researches, and the ' Phytologist ' is honoured in being selected 
as the vehicle for their publication.
The taste for writing on the potato-disease has subsided with the 
disease itself; the writers on this subject have not advanced a step 
towards discovering the cause or suggesting a remedy ; the only result 
of their publications has been by keeping up the alarm to promote 
that speculation in potatoes, wheat and other articles of food, which 
during the present year has been carried to such an insane and reck- 
less extent, that the commerce and credit of the nation has been 
almost completely suspended.
It has however pleased an all-wise and 
beneficent Providence to send us such abundant crops of potatoes and 
Vlll 
grain, that in the present prices of these staple articles of food we 
may hope to find a partial and gradual recompence for the past suf- 
fering, and a return of that spirit of active and energetic though 
prudent enterprise which has so long been the ornament of the British 
Empire.
The records of the present year which appear of most interest to 
British botanists are the following : â€” 
Asparagus officinalis, Phytol.
ii.
726.
The Rev. C.
A. Johns 
records several new stations for this extremely local plant, 
removing all probability of its being exterminated by botanists 
or guides.
Pyrola maritima, ii.
727, is nothing more than P.
rotundifolia; the 
Lancashire plant described by Mr. Kenyon is an old discovery, 
and noticed in the ' New Botanist's Guide,' vol.
i., under 
the head ' Lancashire.' 
Thorea Q-amosissima, ii.
806.
Mr. William M'lvor, of the Kew 
Gardens, has discovered this Alga in the bed of the river 
Thames, above Walton Bridge ; it grows most abundantly, 
and is exposed to view at low water.
Thesium linophyllum, ii.
807.
Mr. Mitten's paper on this plant 
is of great interest : he finds its roots parasitically attached to 
those of Anthyllis vulneraria.
Thymus Serpyllum, Lotus comi- 
culatus, Daucus Carota, Scabiosa succisa, Carex glauca, and 
some grasses.
Luziila nivea, ii.
814.
At a meeting of the Botanical Society of 
Edinburgh, Dr. Balfour announced that this plant, discovered 
last year in a wood near Broomhall, had been planted there 
by a gardener, so that it can have no claim to rank as a 
British plant.
Lycopodium annotinum, ii.
824 and ii.
972.
The Rev. Robert 
Rolleston has found this very local species in Langdale, 
and Mr. H.
Ecroyd Smith on one of the precipitous 
sides of Bow-Fell, Cumberland.
Both specimens are un- 
questionably correctly named.
IX 
Ranunculus ?
ii.
854.
At tlie May meeting of tlie 
London Botanical Society, Mr. Watson exhibited specimens 
of an aqnatic Ranunculus intermediate between R.
aquatilis 
and R.
hederaceus; it stands as 12 d in the second edition 
of the ' London Catalogue.' 
Trifolium strictum, ii.
908.
This species, which as a British plant 
was formerly confined to a single locality in the Channel 
Islands, has been found in Cornwall, by the Rev. C.
A. Johns, 
on a sloping piece of ground near a cove called Cairn William 
or Cathillian, between the Lizard Head and Kynance Cove.
Carex montana, ii.
910.
This extremely rare British species has 
been found by Mr. Purchas, near Ross ; the only other record 
of its occurrence in Britain is by Mr. Mitten (Phytol.
ii.
289).
Simethis bicolor, ii.
926.
Miss Charlotte Wilkins found this 
plant in a fir plantation, about two miles distant from 
Bourne, in July last : it is the Simethis bicolor of Kunth, the 
Anthericum bicolor of the ' Flora Atlantica,' and the Bulbine 
planifolia of Bertolini's ' Flora Italica.' I observe the au- 
thors of the ' London Catalogue ' give it as a true native.
Allium sphcBrocephalum, ii.
922.
Mr. H.
O. Stephens has dis- 
covered this species, previously known as a native of Jersey, 
on St. Vincent's rocks, near Bristol.
Malva veriicillata, ii.
934.
Mr. James Motley has discovered 
this addition to the British Flora in corn-fields, near Lanelly, 
in Glamorganshire, in company with Malva crispa, which he 
concludes had escaped from gardens.
Mr. Motley (Phytol.
ii.
993) corrects a previous error, copied in the ' Phy tologist ' 
from the ' London Journal of Botany,' that only a few speci- 
mens were found : it appears to have been in abundance.
Linaria supina, ii.
939.
Mr. Keys states that this plant was 
found on ballast-heaps, at Catdown, Plymouth ; it is therefore 
a very questionable native of Britain : Mr. Keys however con- 
siders it naturalized in this station : in the last Preface this 
plant is noticed as having been introduced with "foreign 
grain" â€” " with ballast" is the correct definition.
h 
Hieracium heierophylhini, ii.
961.
Mr. Bladon has ventured on 
the very bold task of describing a British species under this 
name : Mr. Bladon does not state in what part of the kingdom 
it is found : neither has he stated in what characters the new 
species differs from H.
umbellatum, as Mr. Backhouse ob- 
serves (Phytol.
ii.
1022), but Mr. Watson, who has seen spe- 
cimens from Mr. Bladon, informs me that he considers the 
two plants quite distinct.
Ph alar is par ado xa^ ii.
961, was found in July last, by Mr. James 
Hussey, in a field near Swanage, Dorsetshire, and by some 
error reported in the September number of the ' London 
Journal of Botany ' as Phalaris utriculata, of Linneus, now 
Alopecurus utriculatus, a very different plant in generic cha- 
racters, although curiously similar in general aspect.
Polygala depressa, ii.
966.
Dr. Bromfield, who introduces this 
plant to the readers of the ' Phytologist ' as found by himself 
on Bleakdown, in the Isle of Wight, has ascertained it to be 
Wenderoth's species, and also to be identical with the P.
ser- 
pyllacea of Weihe ; but he is disposed to regard it as a mere 
variety of Polygala depressa, although a variety not previously 
noticed as British.
Asplenium germanicum^ ii.
974.
Mr. H.
Wilson has found this 
exceedingly rare fern near Lanrwst, in North Wales.
JJdora canadensis?
ii.
1050.
This plant, which has received^ 
multiplicity of names, and of which the nomenclature is still 
unsettled, was discovered in July last, by Miss M.
Kirby, 
growing in great abundance in three reservoirs, by the canal 
in the neighbourhood of Market Harborough, in Leicester- 
shire : when first observed, flower-buds were beginning to 
appear, and throughout August flowers were produced abun- 
dantly, but unfortunately those gathered proved all to be 
females, the plant being dioecious.
The stems are entirely 
submersed, a foot or more in length, growing horizontally and 
branched ; the leaves are three or rarely four in a whorl, ob- 
scurely egg-shaped, embracing the stem, entire ; the flower- 
XI 
stalk is axillary with a small scale at the base, from four to six 
inches in length, enabling it to reach the surface, where, in 
the American species, it is impregnated by the male flowers, 
which are also axillary but sessile, and, becoming de- 
tached, rise to the surface, and there floating, come into 
contact with the female flowers, as in Valisneria, &c.
: calyx 
in three segments, about half the size of the corolla, green ; 
petals three, small, translucent, white ; styles three, stigmas 
fringed, purple.
There appears to be every reason for believing 
this plant a true native ; its habitat is in a thinly peopled 
agricultural district, where it may have bloomed for many 
years unnoticed ; from its abundance and the luxuriance 
of its growth I presume this to have been the case.
Since 
the flowering season, the plant has gradually risen in the 
water, but although seed has been diligently sought for, none 
has yet been found.
For most of these particulars I have to 
acknowledge myself indebted to the kindness of Miss Kirby, 
the discoverer.
The subjoined additional particulars are 
from the pen of the Rev. Andrew Bloxam, of Twycross, 
Leicestershire : â€” " Anacharis Alsinastrum, Bab. In a small 
packet of plants which I received in September last from Miss 
Kirby, of Leicester, was a specimen totally unknown to me, 
and which, as I happened at the time to be writing to Mr.
Babington, I sent to him for investigation.
He considered it 
as a species of Udora [Nuttall), and resembling the U.
ver- 
ticillata {Spreng.) of the Fl. Boreali- Americana, of which there 
are specimens in Sir W.
J. Hooker's herbarium â€” one from 
New Jersey, much resembling the British plant, except that 
its leaves are not so blunt.
There are also in Sir J.
Smith's 
herbarium, at the Linnean Society's rooms, American speci- 
mens from Muhlenberg of a ' Serpicula,' which seems to be 
exactly the Leicestershire plant.
There are two species of 
Udora known in Europe â€” U.
occidentalis (Pursh.
sub Ser- 
picula secund.
Spreng.
Syst.
Veg. 1., p.
171), found in Pome- 
rania, and U.
Lithuanica {Besser), found in Lithuania, These 
xu 
are described in Koch, Fl. Germ.
2ud ed., p.
771, who gives 
the generic character of the plant thus : ' Udora {Nuttall) 
Flores dioici.
Cal. tripart.
Cor. tripetala, Mas. stam.
3. Fem.
styli tres, bifidi, stigmata elongata, plumosa (Flores masculas 
nondum vidi).' I may here state that it has been thought 
better to apply Richard's earlier name of Anacharis to the 
plant instead of Udora.
An allied species similar to that 
found in Leicestershire has been sent by Mr. Mackay to Kew 
Gardens, having been found in the neighbourhood of Dublin.
A similar plant has also been gathered by Mr. Collins, of 
Chichester, from near Havant, pointed out to him by a 
gardener, who has observed it, as Mr. Borrer heard, for seve- 
ral years.
Mr. Babington, however, states in a letter to me, 
that it is in the opinion of a gardener close by, a recent 
arrival : which of the two is correct ?
Mr. Borrer has also 
gathered it, as I hear, in Leigh Park, Hants : this probably 
is the same locality as that near Havant.
It was discovered 
in Leicestershire, by Miss Kirby, of Lubbenham Lodge, in 
the past summer, in some reservoirs adjoining Foxton-locks 
on the canal near Market Harborough.
She was kind enough 
to accompany me to the place in October last, and I found 
the plant in considerable abundance, particularly in the second 
and third reservoirs, growing closely matted together, and the 
upper portion floating on the water.
She had not observed it 
in previous years, and the reservoirs had been cleaned out 
two years ago.
The canal had been made about thirty years, 
and the reservoirs (about a quarter of an acre in size) were then 
formed for collecting the waste water from the upper locks 
and conveying them to the lower ones.
The only conclusion 
I can come to in reference to its discovery in Leicestershire 
and elsewhere is, that the seeds have long lain dormant in 
the localities where it has been found, and that some peculi- 
arity of the two past seasons has caused them to vegetate.
I find in a pond in my own neighbourhood that the Myrio- 
phyllum allernifolium disappears altogether some seasons, and 
XIU 
at other times comes up in abundance and entirely covers the 
pond.
I have seen but few specimens of the plant in flower ; 
of the two which were given to me by Miss Kirby, of Leicester 
(who is a relative of Miss Kirby, of Lubbenham Lodge), I 
sent one to the London Botanical Society, the other to Mr.
Babington : both were female plants, with the stigmas beauti- 
fully plumose or fringed.
Several of the specimens which I 
collected had the peduncles of the flowers still remaining, 
which were shortened or elongated (not in a spiral manner 
like the Valisneria), according to the distance of that portion 
of the stem, from whence they sprang, to the surface of the 
water, but the whole of the germen was gone, and the bifid 
sheaths seen in the flowering specimens were obliterated.
It 
is to be hoped that male flowers may be discovered next year, 
and then it will doubtless be decided whether the plant is al- 
together a new species, or identical with some of the American 
forms." In conclusion, I may state that Reichenbach makes 
two German species of the genus, and that Mr. Watson in- 
forms me Dr. Planchon thinks he has detected three Ame- 
rican species.
The British plant will be likely to prove 
identical with one of the German species.
I have committed 
an error at page 1050 in supposing the genus not Europaean.
Rubus /ruticosus, ^c, ii.
1049.
Rubus still continues to be the 
most fashionable genus of British plants : two accomplished 
botanists, the Rev. Andrew Bloxam and the Rev. W.
A. Leigh- 
ton, have issued fasciculi of specimens in illustration of the 
variations to which these polymorphous plants are liable.
My proposition of raising Rubi from seed, although at first 
treated as irrelevant and chimerical, has obtained the serious 
consideration of a botanist whose labours in the cause of the 
bramble are already well known, and the result of whose 
present experiment will appear in a future number of this 
journal.
XIV 
It seems desirable in this place to notice some inaccuracies which 
occurred in the Preface last year and which require correction.
Carduus setosus, ii.
31, and Cirsium setosutti, ii.
441, are of course 
synonymous : this double record occurred through the list of 
novelties being the work of two pens, the first of which gave 
one name and reference, the second another : the error was 
not discovered until too late to amend it: all botanists con- 
sider the plant a variety of C.
arvensis.
Cnicus oleraceus, ii.
53.
The record of this plant having been 
found by Dr. Brorafield in the Isle of Wight is erroneous : 
the species is not admitted by our botanists as British.
To myself it is always a source of pecular satisfaction to receive 
those simple and unassuming records of which the authors themselves 
often doubt the value, and which would assuredly be rejected from 
more pretending journals : that Trifolium strictum grows at the 
Land's End, Allium spha^rocephalum at Bristol, Lycopodium anno- 
tinum in Cumberland, and therefore all three in England, are facts of 
little importance to mankind generally, but to the British botanist, 
and for him especially this unpretending journal was established, they 
are of greater interest than a hundred Latin descriptions of antipodal 
species, which, should he live far beyond the age wisely allotted us, 
he will never see, and never again hear of or read of.
I earnestly 
solicit my readers never to omit recording facts like those I have cited, 
in the fear that they may be deemed unwelcome or unimportant : I 
earnestly beg of them to transmit the earliest possible notice of such 
facts, and in cases of doubt rather to accompany the communication 
with a specimen for confirmation, than cause delay by endeavouring 
to understand an indifierent description or unravel a confused syno- 
nymy : such specimens shall always be returned if required, the motive 
in making the request being to save the writer and the * Phytologist ' 
from the imputation of error.
Once more I beg to offer my warmest thanks to contributors and 
subscribers, especially to those who have by their kind advocacy in- 
XV 
duced others to subscribe ; and I may add that the paging begins 
anew with the January number, in order to relieve those subscribers 
who commence with 1848 from the necessity of purchasing the back 
numbersj unless they desire to possess them.
I cannot with propriety lay down my pen without adverting to the 
omission of an " Index of Subjects." The difficulty of compiling such 
an index I have found much greater than I anticipated : an index to 
be of any value should contain a reference to every plant mentioned 
in the text, yet if rendered thus voluminous it would in a great 
measure nullify itself; for instance, a name occurred fifty-six times in 
the year 1846, it would therefore require fifty-six references to the 
text, a most bewildering number.
I tried to obviate this objection by 
selecting those names of plants which appeared of more than usual 
interest, but soon found myself lost in the enquiry whether the plant 
were worth indexing or not.
At the close of 1845 I attempted what 
might be termed an " Index of Articles," but I found this perfectly 
useless to myself, when desiring to compile a list of additions to our 
Flora; because these, often occurring in the Reports of Societies, 
escaped all notice in an " Index of Articles." Hence it has seemed 
to me that a complete index would be almost useless and an in- 
complete index quite so, and I have therefore concluded on the present 
occasion to confine myself to an " Index of Contributors," giving at 
length the title of every contribution under the name of its author : 
also a list of the books reviewed and a reference to the reports of So- 
cieties.
I trust that this arrangement will prove satisfactory, at least 
for the present : and I may state that I shall feel extremely indebted 
to any subscriber who will suggest anything better for the future.
1 
will cheerfully and thankfully adopt any suggestion that may tend to 
facilitate a reference to the enormous mass of facts which the pages of 
the ' Phytologist' have rescued from oblivion.

On Arenaria uliginosa, Leersia oryozides and Galium Vaillantii, 
By Edward Forster, Esq., V.P.L.S.
At the first meeting of the present session of the Linnean Society 
(November 3, 1844), specimens were presented of three plants 
hitherto not observed in this country; â€” all of them very interesting, 
being apparently indigenous, not garden escapes, nor likely to 
have been planted by any of those pseudo-botanists who delight in 
being guilty of such malpractices.
Though these have been duly 
noticed in your Phytologist (the announcement of the continuation 
of which useful work gave me great pleasure), you may not object to 
a iew trifling remarks concerning them.
Arenaria uliginosa^ having been described by Sir William Hooker, 
and figured in the 'Supplement to English Botany,' No. 2890, requires 
no observation, except perhaps that it may still be doubted whether 
it ought to be Spergula or Arenaria, if the two genera are kept sepa- 
rate.
It is much to be wished that we might be told who was the ac- 
tual discoverer of this plant, as it would be an act of justice to record 
his name ; and it would be rather awkward and inconvenient to note in 
our herbania, â€” "Found by one of a little band of botanists, Messrs.
J. Tatham, jun., J.
Backhouse, sen.
and jun., Silvanus Thompson, and 
G. S.
Gibson." To the last of these travellers I am indebted for a 
specimen.
Leersia oryzoides, found by Mr. Borrer, in Henfield Levels, where 
it has probably escaped notice from the flowering spike being con- 
cealed in the leaves ; which is not always the case on the Continent, 
from whence I have a specimen, gathered by Mr. Joseph Woods, with 
the spike quite exposed.
This being so well known from foreign 
specimens, and likely to be described by the finder, in ' English Botany,' 
needs no further remark.
Galium Vaillantii, discovered by Mr. G.
S. Gibson, near Saffron 
Walden, in, Essex, has probably been hitherto overlooked from its 
affinity to Galium Aparine, from which it appears sufficiently distinct.
It was well named Galium Vaillantii by De Caudolle, for it is clearly

B 
Vaillant's Aparine vulgaris, semine minori.
'Botanicon Parisiense,' 14, 
t. 4, f.

Aparine).
Smith refers Galium 
spurium to this figure, observing, " Vaillant's beautiful plate repre- 
sents these {seed pods) hairy, which has caused some doubt as to his 
synonym.
They may vary in this respect, like several others of this 
genus." It seems, then, that this eminent botanist never saw the 
Saffron Walden plant.
It is possible that it may belong to G.
spurium, 
as I can see no difference, except in the seeds, from a specimen of 
that Galium, gathered by the late George Don, near Forfar, which I 
possess, in his Herb.
Brit., No. 104.
Yet I still think we have good 
reason to conceive it to be distinct, unless Mr. Gibson should find, 
next year, any specimens with smooth fruit â€” if he does, we may con- 
gratulate him on gathering G.
spurium south of the Tweed.
Sebas- 
tian Vaillant, whose name is given to this species, if it be so, was 
demonstrator of Botany in the Royal Garden at Paris, and Fellow of 
the Academy of Sciences.
He did not live to publish the result of 
his botanical excursions round Paris, and findinghis death approaching, 
he consigned his manuscripts, and the beautiful drawings made for 
him by Claude Aubriet, to the great Boerhaave, who published them, 
with the assistance of William Sherard, to whom all the merit of the 
arrangement is given, stating that he was the only man capable of 
doing so, and that he had worked from morning to night for this pur- 
pose.
After the publication, Boerhaave gave the manuscripts and 
drawings, bound in one volume, to the Academy at Leyden, which he 
observes will serve to prove the exactness with which he has fulfilled 
the work of his deceased friend.

Notes on Epimedium alpiniim and Saxifraga rotundifolia.
By William Borrer, Esq., F.L.S.
Epimedium alpinum.
Havingheard that,subsequently to Mr. Woods' 
vain search, nine years ago, for this plant in Wasdale Screes, it had 
been found, not in the Screes, but by the side of the river, that issues 
fi^-om Wastwater, I made it one of my objects, in two excursions to Cum- 
berland last summer, to visit it in its native place of growth, if possi- 
ble, or if not, to ascertain the degree of authority for regarding it as a 
native of the Lake District.
Plants were shown me in a garden at Kes- 
wick, said to have been brought from the Screes themselves ; and I 
3 
visited that wild scene, accompanied by the person said to have 
brought them â€” the intelligent guide, Mr. Wright.
He did not, 
indeed, express any very sanguine expectation of being able to show 
me the plant wild ; for he had " found but little, and left less, and he 
had heard that parties had since been in search of it : but he could 
show me the very spot where he got it." Accordingly, the spot was 
shown, but empty ; and a search of five hours on that desolate steep 
of broken precipice and loose debris was altogether unsuccessful, 
although we had the statement of another person â€” of no great credit, 
as I learned afterwards, for accuracy of assertion â€” that another part 
of the Screes, so described that I had no doubt we found it, pro- 
duced the desideratum " in cart loads." This visit was made early in 
June.
At the latter end of July I was again in Wasdale, where I 
obtained information that the plant had been looked for in the Screes 
many times, and by various parties, in vain, but that it was to be 
found in a wood by the river half a mile from San ton Bridge, some 
three miles from Nether Wasdale.
There I found it, and wild enough 
in appeai'ance it was : but equally so were Erica vagans, and several 
foreign shrubs not uncommon in our gardens ; and I have not the 
least doubt that it and they were alike introduced by a former pro- 
prietor, the projector of a moss-house there, now in decay, and of 
walks now overgrown.
I then called on a nurseryman in the neigh- 
bourhood, the reported discoverer of our plant in the Screes.
He 
laughed at the idea of his " scrambling after a plant in the Screes, too 
dangerous a place," he said, for him : but his foreman, he told me 
(and the man himself confirmed it), had more than once hunted for it 
there in vain, and so had a neighbouring clergyman.
How the 
notion that it grew there originated, he knew not.
I had heard that 
he had received a prize for it, as the best British plant exhibited, 
from a flower-club, at Whitehaven.
He was not sure whether he had 
or had not : he had gained several prizes there.
I heard reports, but 
too vague for investigation, of two other wild stations of the plant in 
question ; one in Borrowdale, the other near Cockermouth.
I may 
add, that the late Rev. R.
F. Bree was very positive that he had 
gathered it "in Helvellyn, near the summit." He said that he had 
presented the specimens, with the rest of his herbarium, to a society 
at Boulogne.
Saxifraga rotundifolia.
In June, 1844, I obtained from Miss 
Wright, of Keswick, a specimen of this beautiful Saxifrage, " gathered 
by herself, some years since, near the foot of Causey Pike, where it is 
not now to be found." Miss Wright's account encourages a hope that 
the plant may be truly a native of our mountains, although it does not 
establish it as such.
It grew, she says, in one spot only, shaded by 
a rock, among shivers of clay-slate, in a cluster of several plants, very 
near together.
Struck with the beauty of the flower, but not aware 
that it was anything new to our Flora, she collected all that she saw.
The next year she again visited the spot, found a few more specimens, 
and again gathered them all.
In the two years she supposes she col- 
lected from fifteen to twenty specimens.
In several subsequent visits 
she has been unable to find a single one, and she considers herself as 
having completely eradicated her discovery before the place of it was 
buried, as it has since been, by further slipplngs of the shivery rock.
She conducted me to the spot, which is such as to preclude alto- 
gether any suspicion that the plant had escaped from a garden.
Can 
it be that it had been purposely sown ?

On the Falling of the Leaf.
By William Wilson, Esq.
The descent of an apple on the head of a philosopher led to the 
discoveiy of the laws of gravitation ; but hitherto no satisfactory ex- 
planation has been given of the cause of its fall at the period of matu- 
rity,nor of the spontaneous dehiscence of leaves, so light and buoyant, 
that even when unmoored from the tree to which they have minis- 
tered nourishment, they descend with reluctance to mother earth.
So 
soft and noiseless is their fall, that it needs a contemplative mind to 
take due notice of the event.
Though every leaf has its appointed time 
of duration, great diversity prevails in reference to the period in dif- 
ferent species and tribes.
Some, like the poplar and the ash, are 
tardy in making their appearance, and vanish speedily, while the 
approach of winter is as yet scarcely perceptible : those of the oak 
yield only to its more significant frowns: yet all seem to be subject to 
some general law, and it is my present purpose to inquire what is the 
rationale of this spontaneous decadence.
A valued friend has endeavoured to throw some light on the sub- 
ject by remarking, that Nature does nothing by leaps; and therefore it 
is to be expected that those of our British trees which have evergreen 
congeners elsewhere, should exhibit, by their long retention of leaves, 
their participation in the same properties.
This view, perhaps, derives 
some weight from the consideration of such trees as keep the leaves 
even after they are withered, and when, the original function being 
fulfilled, their immediate fall might be considered inevitable.
In a 
less rigorous season, such leaves may, perhaps, remain unchanged for 
a longer period, and then fall before they are actually withered and 
dry ; for we see that if early frost attacks the leaves of any tree, 
while yet discharging their proper functions, they wither without fall- 
ing, and the same happens when excessive drought occasions pre- 
mature decay.
We may derive some illustration of the cause of dehiscence from 
the cryptogamic tribes, especially from the thecal of mosses.
I shall 
select two species of Hypnum for eXj|mples.
On a wall near my resi- 
dence I have had opportunities of watching attentively, for several 
seasons, Hypnum velutinum and H.
populeum, which ripen their 
thecae at the same period (November), but the first loses its operculum 
as early as the middle of February, when the -peristome expands, and 
the seeds are dispersed in myriads: H.
populeum retains the operculum 
till the end of March, and even longer, the seeds being, meanwhile, 
pent up within the theca.
On taking a very thin longitudinal section 
of the ripening theca, it will be seen that H.
velutinum has a large 
well-formed annulus interposed between the edge of the operculum 
and the mouth of the theca, and partly lodged in grooves formed in 
those parts.
The section of the annulus is elliptical, with its longer 
axis nearly upright, but inclined a little inwards, composed of two 
parallel series of highly succulent cells, which, when dry, contract 
very much in dimensions, while the contiguous walls of the operculum 
and the mouth of the mature theca, being formed of small cells of a 
harder texture, do not contract much in drying.
Previous to maturity 
they all seem to be equally succulent and contractile, and no dehis- 
cence of the operculum can be attained from an unripe theca, except 
by positive violence producing a rupture, although the line of dehis- 
cence is at all times easily seen.
The operculum generally falls on 
the return of moist weather, succeeding a period of comparative 
drought ; and it seems correct to infer, that during the dry interval 
the cellules of the annulus, by their contraction, have separated from 
the surrounding parts, in consequence of the refusal of the walls of 
the operculum and theca to yield in the same proportion, and thus, on 
the return of moisture, the annulus, and the teeth of the peristome 
becoming turgid, a species of elasticity is induced sufficient to throw 
off the operculum.
The turgiscence of the moistened annulus, in 
many species of moss, especially in Funaria hygroraetrica, is so great 
as to cause it to bend outwards, the parts becoming quite inverted in 
their relative positions.
6 
A similar section of the theca of H.
populeum exhibits no annukis 
whatever: hence the greater persistency of the operculum is easily 
accounted for, there being no sj^ecial organ in this case designed for 
its removal, or one which is so small and imperfectly developed as to 
elude detection ; yet even here there is a sutural line visible, and 
it may be supposed that it is through some inequality in the contrac- 
tion of the parts adjacent, that dehiscence ultimately occurs.
It is easy for an imaginative mind to form theories on any subject, 
and to support them by plausible arguments, but it seems legitimate 
to apply the preceding facts in explanation of the fall of leaves.
In 
these the petiole is usually* attached to the stem of the plant by an 
articulation, where probably the cellular tissue will be found to be 
more lax than the adjacent parts.
The woody tissue of the petiole is 
obviously less contractile than the parenchymatous tissue ; and as a 
period must arrive when the cells acquire their maximum of indura- 
tion, and cease to act in discharge of their original functions, from 
what may be called a superinduced ossification of parts, previously 
soft and elastic, the moisture of the sap being no longer supplied to 
preserve their pristine bulk, the softer cells contract in drying, sepa- 
rate from the adjoining parts, and the woody tissue being also ren- 
dered fragile by drying, the whole weight of the leaf is made to fall 
upon those parts which have not contracted, and are too weak of them- 
selves to sustain the burden.
If this explanation is founded in Nature, it will be found that leaves 
remain longer upon the trees in seasons of continued moist weather, 
and for a shorter period when the autumn is a dry one.
The return 
of wet weather after drought may hasten the fall of the leaf, by 
adding mechanically to its weight, and so also may wind, by pro- 
ducing lateral fracture of the woody parts of the petiole.
The ques- 
tion must be considered apart from those circumstances.
It is to be hoped that this subject will be discussed by other 
observers ; and if these views shall prove to be erroneous, 1 shall still 
be happy to have supplied a stimulus to some one who shall for- 
tunately arrive at more accurate conclusions.

* In the holly there is no articnlation, and the leaves seem to be pushed off at the 
end of the second year, by the swelling in spring of the bvauch immediately above 
them, rather than to fall off of themselves -.
a similar event occurs in Viscum album, 
at the end of the first year.
Myosurus minimus, not yet found in Ireland.
By David Moore, Esq., xl.L.S.
Since the publication of Mr. Watson's book on the 'Geographical 
Distribution of British Plants,' attention has been more directed to that 
subject than formerly, and through the means of local Floras, along 
with individual contributions, much valuable information has been 
obtained relative to the distribution of species, though at the same time, 
en-ois have crept in through these sources, notwithstanding caution 
has been used to guard against them, of which the following instance 
will afford an example.
In the 4th and 5th editions of Sir W.
Hooker's 'British Flora,' 
Myosurus minimus is inserted as an Irish plant, on the authority of 
my worthy friend Mr. Niven, who, no doubt, sent the plant to Sir 
William, from Ireland, but then he was imposed on by the person 
who brought the specimens to him, which was done by their being first 
taken from the botanic garden to the north, and brought back again 
mixed up with a number of other plants, which were collected on the 
occasion, with a label attached, distinctly stating the locality where 
the Myosurus was picked, in the county Antrim.
The collection 
was submitted to Mr. Niven's inspection, who being thus thrown off 
his guard, entertained no doubts of the correctness of the matter, par- 
ticularly as the person further stated, that a friend was along with him 
who resided near the place where they found the plant, and who on 
being written to could forward more specimens, which was actually 
done, making the fraud complete : anticipating this result, a quantity 
was left for this purpose.
Myosurus minimus is, therefore, so far as I am aware, still a 
desideratum to the Irish Flora.
Nothing could be more culpable 
than such a trick as this, destroying as it does, the most important 
feature of our Floras, namely, the distribution and range of the spe- 
cies ; and none but a silly person who had no further love for the 
science but to gain some selfish object, would be guilty of the like.
No doubt errors may occasionally arise without the slightest aim at 
firaud, for instance.
Ledum palustre was at one time considered an 
Irish plant, on the authority of a gentleman who saw a piece of it 
stuck up in a peasant's hat, when passing through a remote place in 
Connemara, where he supposed it could not have been obtained ex- 
cepting in a wild state; and those best acquainted with the subject 
know, that the most accurate observers make mistakes occasionally 
in the identity of species.

A Visit to Tintern.
By C.
C. Babington, Esq., M.A., F.L.S.
Thinking that the accounts of botanical excursions which occa- 
sionally appear in the ' Phytologist,' are not amongst the least inte- 
resting papers which appear in it, I have ventured to give a short 
notice of a trip made in the early part of July last, to the neighbour- 
hood of Tintern Abbey, in Monmouthshire, not on account of any in- 
teresting results springing from it, but for the purpose of recommend- 
ing that spot to those who may desire to spend two or three days in 
botanizing amongst as beautiful scenery as can be found in the 
southern parts of England.
Indeed the position of Tintern is so cele- 
brated, that it is only necessary to mention its name to excite, even 
in those who have not had the good fortune to visit the banks of the 
Wye, an idea of richness and beauty in its highest perfection : the 
river winding amongst elevated precipitous and wooded hills ; the 
exquisite ruins ; the views, embracing mountain-like summits in 
Monmouthshire, and on the Welch border to the west, and eastward 
the extensive plain of Gloucester, traversed by the Severn, whilst the 
southern distance is chiefly occupied by the wide expanse of the 
Bristol channel ; supply a diversity of beautiful objects that may 
justly excite admiration.
In this district I had the pleasure of spending the 9th, lOth, and 
11th of July, in company with my friend, R, M.
Lingwood, Esq., who 
had come from his residence in Herefordshire to join me; and the 
more I saw of it, the more I became convinced that these extensive 
woods afford a rich field for the exploring botanist.
My time was 
unfortunately limited, or I should gladly have prolonged my visit.
We anived at Tintern in the middle of the day, and after taking up 
our quarters at a nice little rural inn (the Rose and Crown), within a 
few hundred yards of the Abbey, we walked down the western side of 
the river for a considerable distance, and noticed Tragopogon porri- 
folius in a far more decidedly wild condition than it has ever else- 
where occurred to me.
It was growing in considerable quantity at 
some distance above the water, and far from any house, in a part of 
the woods not easily accessible, except by following the banks of the 
river.
Near to the same spot we gathered a very curious monstrosity 
of Cerastium, in which the flower has taken a rose-like form, the 
sepals and petals exactly resembHng whorls of leaves in miniature, 
and the capsule being formed of precisely similar leaves, attached to 
each other by their edges, so as to present a series of deep furrows at 
their junctions, and a prominent ridge at the mid-rib of each.
The 
9 
calyx, corolla, and capsule, were quite green, and covered on both 
sides with hairs, as is the case with the leaves.
The ovules were ele- 
vated upon hairy stalks, and the whole flower affords a most interest- 
ing illustration of the views now advocated by all scientific botanists, 
under the name of Morphology, and which ray friend, Professor 
Edward Forbes, has recently extended to the animal kingdom, by 
showing that the formation of the reproductive organs of some tribes 
of zoophytes, is constructed by a precisely similar modification of the 
ordinary organs of the animal.
This is a discovery of the greatest 
value.
A figure of the monstrous Cerastium was published some 
time since, in the ' Gardener's Chronicle.' 
In the woods which occupy the slopes of the hills on the same side 
of the river, is found in plenty, a species of Euphorbia, different from 
any of those recorded in our lists of native plants, but its name is not 
as yet accurately determined.
It is the E.
stricta, of Reichenbach and 
Koch, but not of Linnaeus and Smith ; the plant of the latter authors, 
which is also known by the name of E.
platyphyllos, is usually found 
in corn-fields, or on other cultivated ground, but the new one inhabits 
woods and thickets, or other wild spots.
The Tintern plant is often 
three or even four feet in length, and has a beautiful appearance, 
owing to the numerous branches with which its stem is furnished for 
some distance below the umbel.
I do not enter into an account of 
its characters, which were pointed out to me by Mr. R.
Kippist, be- 
cause he has long intended to illustrate this plant and its allies, in a 
paper to be communicated to the Linnean Society, and it would be 
most unjust and ungrateful to anticipate him.
Let us hope that he 
will not much longer allow a subject to remain in obscurity, which 
he is so well qualified to illustrate.
The plant is found for three or 
four miles along the valley, growing in the woods, and close to the 
road-side, and in many places on the steep banks of the river.
Writing from recollection alone, I do not endeavour to mention the 
many interesting plants which inhabit these woods, but only the few 
which peculiarly attracted my attention, and impressed themselves 
upon my memory.
Had I contemplated the present notice, careful 
lists of plants would have been prepared, and notes taken upon the 
spot.
This is of but little, if of any, consequence, since a very com- 
plete reference to them, and their stations, will be found in Mr.
Watson's valuable * New Botanist's Guide.' 
The following day was spent on the opposite side of the river, where 
one of the first plants which attracted our attention was the Campa- 
nula latifolia, which I had been accustomed to consider as being con- 
VOL.

fined to the northern counties of England, nor do I find it to be 
recorded as a native of the southern part of our country.
It is very 
plentiful in the woods on the eastern side of the river near Tintern.
By following the ridge of the hill at the upper edge of the woods for 
some distance, a remarkable projecting rock is attained, which, rising 
out of the trees, commands a very extensive and beautiful view, and 
is well worthy of a visit.
It is called the ' Devil's Pulpit.' How re- 
markable it is that the most curious rocks, caves, and other hollows, 
and also some of the grandest works of man's hands, should so uni- 
versally be attributed to the agency of that being by those who do 
not possess the knowledge requisite for referring them to their true 
causes.
The summit of the hills, which form the northern extremity of the 
Forest of Dean, and lie between the Wye and Severn, is occupied by 
sandy tracts of heath, interspersed with woods and thickets, and only 
partially cultivated.
The plants common to such places are found 
upon them, but I do not remember noticing any peculiar species, ex- 
cept a sub-erect Rubus, which I have never noticed elsewhere, and 
suspect to be undescribed.
This genus is so difficult, that I am not 
now prepared to give a more decided opinion concerning it.
Al- 
though but few plants occupied our boxes, we were fully repaid for 
our walk, by the constant change of scene and the ever-varying pros- 
pects afforded to us.
On the third day we visited a lateral valley to the village of Trellech, 
where there is a spring very strongly charged with iron, and three 
enormous monumental stones, from which the place takes its name ; 
but their history is lost in antiquity.
We passed by the way an ex- 
tensive peat-moss, producing the plants usually inhabiting such 
places, and pursued our course by a hilly road to Monmouth.
Should this sketch afibrd any gratification to its readers, or lead 
any of them to visit the district, and explore it for themselves, it will 
have fulfilled one object which I have had in view, the other being 
to show my satisfactionat the prospect of the 'Phytologist' continuing 
to run its useful course.

Some account of the (Enanthe pimpinelloides, and peucedanifolia of 
English Authors.
By Hewett C.
Watson, Esq., F.L.S.
Much confusion and consequent misapplication of names occur in 
the writings of English botanists, previous to the present year of 
1844, in relation to the plants above-mentioned.
Hudson described 
a single species only, under the name of " pimpinelloides ;" having 
either applied this name to the wrong species, or confounded two 
species under the one name.
Smith and succeeding British authors 
kept the same name in their works, usually or always applying it to 
the wrong species also.
But they likewise distinguished a second 
species, to which the name "peucedanifolia" has been universally 
applied until the present year.
Meanwhile, several continental authors were referring the two spe- 
cies figured in * English Botany,' 347 and 348, under the above names, 
the one to Lachenalii of Gmelin, and the other to silaifolia of Bieber- 
stein.
English authors were slow to adopt these names ; and in one 
instance, I think, correctly so.
In the fourth edition of the 'British 
Flora,' 1838 (I have not the earlier editions now by me).
Sir W.
J. 
Hooker still kept to the two names of English Botany, but observed 
of the plants, " they are certainly not the species so called by De 
Candolle, and other continental writers." Notwithstanding this ob- 
servation, the same two names were still repeated in the Edinburgh 
Catalogue, in 1841, and also in the fifth edition of the 'British Flora,' 
in 1842.
1 think that the first decided change in the right direction, was 
made in the ' Manual of British Botany,' in 1843.
Following conti- 
nental botanists, Mr. Babington applied the name of Lachenalii to the 
species described by Smith, and figured in English Botany, under 
the name of pimpinelloides.
At the same time he fell into the very 
excusable error of rejecting the true pimpinelloides wholly.
Yet 
specimens were then to be seen in several English herbaria; although, 
it would seem, unknown to Mr. Babington.
Specimens of the true 
Linnsean pimpinelloides had been sent to the Botanical Society of 
London, correctly labelled by Mr. Edwin Lees, in 1839 and 1840 ; 
but this was " throwing pearls," &c.
I had myself collected the 
same species, in a very young state, in the Isle of Wight, in May of 
1840; and afterwards obtained a full series of specimens by cultivating 
the plant in my garden.
The rejection of pimpinelloides wholly from 
the ' Manual of Botany,' induced me to compare these garden speci- 
mens of a native species with the true pimpinelloides, in the herbarium 
12 
of Sir W.
J. Hooker.
Satisfied by this comparison, that the rejected 
name was nevertheless correct, it was retained in the London Cata- 
logue of British Plants, compiled in the Christmas week of 1843.
In 
doing so, however, I fell into an error parallel with that of Mr.
Babington, namely, rejecting one species, and retaining two only.
The author of the Manual evidently did not understand the peuceda- 
nifolia of Smith.
The Edinburgh botanists were distributing the 
Lachenalii under that name.
And Smith himself had made this ap- 
pear correct, by describing the fruit of a foreign species (which resem- 
bles that of Lachenalii), as the fruit of his peucedanifolia.
Under 
these circumstances, I supposed that the Lachenalii and peucedani- 
folia, of the ' Manual,' might be identical ; even though Smith's pim- 
piuelloides was meant by the former name.
In 1844, the subject came under the attention of Mr. Ball, whose 
practical knowledge of European plants and works enabled him to 
clear away nnich of the obscurity.
In his paper, published in the 
'Annals of Natural History,' (July, 1844), he described three British 
species, namely, pimpinelloides, Lachenalii, and silaifolia â€” intending 
the peucedanifolia of Smith under this latter name.
Mr. Ball's paper 
was forthwith followed (Annals, August, 1844), by some good critical 
remarks, from the pen of Mr. Babington, who concurred with Mr.
Ball in admitting the three species ; although not altogether so in 
regard to their nomenclature.
But it is made pretty evident, by their 
papers in the ' Annals,' that neither of these two accurate botanists 
were in possession of a sufficient series of English specimens.
In 
particular, Mr. Ball gives no description of the fruit of pimpinelloides, 
and describes that of his silaifolia only, from immature specimens, 
which do not suffice.
After examining a number of specimens lately 
sent to the Botanical Society, from various localities, along with 
others in my own herbarium, I think the subject may now be ren- 
dered tolerably clear.
The roots of all three species consist of a cluster of fibres, which 
are enlarged into tubers, through some portion of their length.
The 
forms of these tubers differ much, and afford good characters to sepa- 
rate one species at least from the other two.
Still they vary greatly 
even in the same species ; and single tubers might be taken from 
one species, which would then readily pass for those of another.
In 
all three species the tubers are continued below into thread-like 
roots ; so that no specific distinction can be founded on this change.
The leaves are bipinnate, varying to tripinnate, or pinnate ; their 
leaflets entire, or variously lobed and cleft.
The leaflets and seg- 
13 
ments of the upper leaves are more or less linear ; those of the lower 
leaves broader, and very variable in the same species.
This varia- 
bility renders it difficult to apply definite terms, which shall not be 
contradicted by some of the leaves ; and yet the eye will tolerably 
well distinguish the species by their leaves, when once familiar with 
them.
The uncertainty in the presence (or rather persistence) of the 
involucrum, has led to error and confusion ; too much value having 
been attached to that organ, in framing specific characters.
The 
fruit affords excellent characters, in its different forms, and by the 
presence or absence of a thickened (callous) base, of a pale or yellow- 
ish-brown colour.
This is not to be confounded with the dilated 
summit of the pedicel, which is seen, more or less, in each species.
The callosity is still part of the fruit, after separation from the pedicel.
With these explanations, I trust that the following characters will 
enable any botanist to name his specimens.
I add the localities 
from which I have examined specimens, since little reliance can be 
placed on those published in books.
1. (Efianthe pimpinelloideSf Linn.
Tubers oval or sub-spherical, 
connected to the base of the stem by a slender peduncle, (^'.
e. a por- 
tion of the fibre, which is not enlarged into the tuber).
Leaflets and 
segments very acute or mucronate ; those of the radical leaves much*** 
broader and shorter.
Involucrum many-leaved (about six), usually 
persistent.
Fruit cylindrical, as broad as the calyx, callous at the 
base, distinctly pedicellate, fi^ee in the umbellule.

Botany, 384.
There appears no difficulty about continental syno- 
nymes here.
The specimens in the Linnsean herbarium, wanting root 
and fi-uit, apparently belong here ; and it is no doubt the species of 
De Candolle, and European authors generally.
Near Cruckbarrow 
Hill, and on hilly ground, at Powick, both in Worcestershire ; also 
on dry hilly ground at Forthampton, Gloucestershire : Mr. Edwin 
Lees.
In Hayfields, at Fifehead Neville, Dorset : Mrs. Wyndham, 
and Mr. W.
C. Trevelyan.
On a hedge-bank, near^Shanklin, in the 
Isle of Wight.
The Shanklin plant has longer tubers, and broader 
leaves.
I have not seen mature fruit of plants from the other localities.
The half-grown fruit from Cruckbarrow Hill, is remarkable in having 
the pedicel itself thickened and callous.
2. CEnanthe Lachenalii, Gmel.
Tubers elongate, slender, clavate, 
fusiform, or sub-cylindrical, sessile, (the thickening of the fibre com- 
mencing from its origin at the base of the stem).
Leaflets of the lower 
14 
leaves linear-obovate, or wedge-shaped and trifid, obtuse, raucronate; 
those of the upper leaves sub-acute.
Involucrum many-leaved (about 
six or eight) usually persistent.
Fruit oblong or turbinate, broader 
than the calyx, tapering below, without callosity at the base, shortly 
pedicellate, densely crowded in the umbellule.

This appears to be certainly the species of Gmelin ; De Candolle and 
Duby ; Lejeune and Courtois; Reichenbach ; Koch, &c.
Mr. Ball 
and Mr. Babington rightly state this to be the commonest of the three 
species.
I have it from many places on the coast, â€” from Cornwall 
northward to the firths of Forth and Clyde; as also from places inland.
Among some scores of specimens, the inland plants generally have 
the roots longer and more slender, while their fruits are rather smaller, 
and less narrowed at the base.
But a specimen from Michelfeld, 
near Basle, has a tuber (the only one left attached) as short and thick 
as some of the most elongated tubers on British specimens of the 
next species.
Smith's peucedanifolia.
Judging by the labels which 
have come into my hands, the inland plants are usually called 
pimpinelloides, by English botanists ; while those from the coast are 
labelled as peucedanifolia.
3. (Enanthe Smithii (temporary name).
Tubers rather short, 
thick, clavate, or oblong-fusiform, sessile.
Leaflets and segments of 
the lower stem-leaves linear-lanceolate, acute, scarcely broader than 
those of the upper leaves.
Involucrum usually few-leaved (1-3) very 
deciduous (or wholly absent?).
Fruit subcylindrical, scarcely so 
broad as the calyx, callous at the base, shortly pedicellate, crowded 
in the umbellules.
Branches very fistulose.

I cannot suppose this to be the silaifolia of Bieber- 
stein, which is described with the lower leaves " valde abbreviatis 
atque dilatatis." The lowest leaves which 1 have seen, show no 
approach to this character ; but I have not seen the very lowest, or 
early radical leaves.
Many authors agree that it is not the peuceda- 
nifolia of Pollich.
And if it is neither of these species, I really know 
not how to name it, except as a nameless species, which may appro- 
priately take that of Smith, its early or first describer.
Mr. Babington 
is correct in considering it the silaifolia of Koch's Synopsis, if we 
may judge by his description, particularly of the fruit.

Gloucestershire : Mr. Edwin lices.

Severn, Worcestershire : Mr. Buckman.
In a meadow between the 
Ambien wood, and Sutton wharf, Leicestershire : Rev. A.
Bloxam.
Short clavate tubers prevail in the licicestershire specimens ; those 
from Longdon vary, more or less, to fusiform.
And now, with a few words in notification of past errors, T may 
conclude this notice of the plants.
As far as I am myself concerned, 
the three species were not understood before last month.
The only 
one well known to me (from 1841) was the pimpinelloides (Linn.), 
and with that I was confusing rootless and fruitless specimens of 
Smith's pimpinelloides, which is Babington's Lachenalii ; my fruit- 
bearing specimens of this latter being equally confused with Smith's 
peucedanifolia.
This sort of division of Lachenalii, between the two 
others, pervades all the writers on these plants and their localities, 
before 1843 or 1844.
Mr. Lees was acquainted with pimpinelloides, 
but up to this present year, his labelled specimens show that he con- 
fused the other two together, under the name of peucedanifolia.
When writing his ' Manual,' Mr. Babington must have known 
Lachenalii, but neither of the others sufficiently.
I fear that even 
Mr. Ball has mingled specimens of the peucedanifolia and Lachenalii, 
under the name of silaifolia.
His description of the fruit of his 
silaifolia, " exiguum, clavatum (ad basin ut videtur haud incrassatum), 
infeme quidquam contractum," is far from applicable to my speci- 
mens.
While immature, the fruits of all ai-e contracted downwards ; 
and this contraction is permanent in those of Lachenalii, especially 
in those fruits which are crowded together in the centre of the um- 
bellule, and have scarce room to expand.
The " exiguum," if general 
smallness is implied, cannot suit Smith's peucedanifolia, the fruit of 
which is longer than the fruit of either of the other species : it may 
be rather more slender.
It has certainly the callous base, distinct 
before maturity.
The " cartilaginous and minutely denticulate mar- 
gin" of the leaflets, is to be seen on those of Lachenalii equally as on 
the leaflets of pimpinelloides.
Lastly, the greater or less thickness of 
the tubers, though influenced by agte, is more affected by some other 
circumstance ; since some of the thickest tubers of Lachenalii occur 
in younger specimens ; while some of those advanced in fruit are dis- 
tinguished by their long slender tubers.

Notes on a Botanical Tour in Germany, 
By Joseph Woods, Esq., F.L.S.
I LEFT London on the 16th of May, 1844, but the wet weather for 
some days prevented my botanizing, and urged me on, since I could 
travel in the rain, with less inconvenience than I could walk about in 
it.
On the 21st T ascended the Rhine in a steamer to Coblenz.
The 
steamer was nine hours in ascending from Cologne to Coblenz.
On 
the 22nd I had a botanical walk, under the auspices of Mr. Wertgen.
We crossed the Moselle, and turning to the left, walked to the 
nearest hills above the river.
It was not, perhaps, one of the plea- 
santest walks about Coblenz for scenery ; yet, after reaching the hills, 
the views were often very beautiful, stretching over the lower country 
about Coblenz to the hills beyond the Rhine, and in another direc- 
tion along the more contracted valley of the Moselle.
The eminencies 
on which we were, are dotted over with little bits of wood, left in order 
to supply fuel to the neighbourhood.
I need not mention such 
plants as Salvia pratensis, Euphorbia cyparissias, &c., which are 
found almost everywhere on the Continent, but proceed to those of 
less general occurrence.
In the meadows near the Moselle our first 
prize was Tragopogon orientalis, distinguished by Koch, from T.
pratensis, by the beak of the marginal seeds being only about half as 
long as the seed itself, while in T.
pratensis this beak is as long as the 
seed.
Veronica praecox occurred occasionally among the corn, but 
was almost over ; as was also Holosteum umbellatum.
Some of the 
latter belonged to the hairy variety, which has been called H.
ciliatum.
Arabis arvense is exceedingly abundant.
Euphorbia esula and E.
Gerardi grow on the banks of the river : and here we find also Allium 
schoenoprasum.
This has not the twisted leaves of the Cornish 
plant, which is probably A.
sibiricum.
In the woods, or on their 
borders, we met with Ranunculus polyanthemus, Dentaria bulbifera, 
Genista sagittalis, Vicia tenuifolia, Ribes alpinum, Galium sylvati- 
cum, abundantly, but not showing yet any signs of flower.
Hieracium 
praealtum, Gnaphalium dioicum.
Campanula persicifolia, Pulmonaria 
oflicinalis, Myosotis stricta, and the var.
of M.
palustris with deflex- 
ed hairs on the stem.
Melampyrum arvense, M.
cristatum, Alnus 
incana, Orchis fusca, O.
militaris, and O.
chlorantha, Ornithogalum 
umbellatum, Convallaria majalis, and C; multiflora, Luzula albida, 
Carex tomentosa, and a variety of C.
praecox, which is probably C; 
umbrosa, of Host.
17 
We descended the lulls to a village called Kultz, and crossing the 
river bv a ferry, returned along the right bank to Coblenz.
On the 23rd I botanized with Mr. Wertgen, on the east bank of the 
Rhine.
After crossing the bridge we ascended the hills, and again 
descended into the upper part of the Miihlbach, where there is some 
boggy ground, on which we found what ajDpears to be a variety of 
Eriophorum pubescens, with smooth stalks.
We then kept up the 
hills rather to the left, and again sweeping round to the right, follow- 
ed nearly the ridge of the hills which bound the valley of the Lahn, 
whence we looked down upon Eras.
We gathered Genista germa- 
nica (in some places this, G.
sagittalis and G.
pilosa were all in 
flower together), Trifolium alpestre, Mespilus germanica, Pimpinella 
magna, Carum Carui, Lonicera Xylosteum in fruit, Phyteuma nigrum 
and P.
orbiculare, Pyrola minor, Anthericum Liliago, and Carex 
raontana.
On our return along the valley of the Rhine we got a few 
plants of Barbarea arenata, but the grass of the bank on which it 
gi-ows had just been cut, and the plants carried away.
On the '24th I went in the steam-boat to Bingen, and thence in an 
omnibus to Kreuznach.
Erysimum crepidifolium abounds every- 
where on the road-side.
The scenery appeared tame, but I found 
some of a very different character, when I walked to the Rhein- 
Grafenstein the next day.
There is a singular mixture of wild and 
tame above Kreuznach ; and we come suddenly on cliffs 500 or 600 
feet perpendicular, wondering how they got there.
In my walk I ob- 
served the following plants : â€” 
Anemone Pulsatilla 
Helleborus foetidus 
Tilia grandifolia 
T. parvifolia 
Acer monspessulanum 
Camelina sativa 
Biscutella laevigata 
Alyssum moutanum 
Brassica Cheiranthus 
Erysimum crepidifolium 
Cardamine impatieus 
Sclerantbus perennis 
Dianthus caesius 
Lychnis viscaria 
Trifolium montanum 
T. alpestre 
Cotoneaster vulgaris 
Araelanchier vulgaris 
Sedum rupestre 
Ribes alpinum 
Galium glaucum 
Carum Carui 
C. Bulbocastanum 
Lactuca perennis 
Hieracium Peleterianum 
H. prgemorsum 
Hieracium maculatum, Sm.?
Centaurea montana 
Cineraria campestris?
Lonicera Xylosteum 
Cynanchum Viucetoxicum 
Ajuga genevensis 
Veronica prostrata 
Rumex scutatus 
Anthericum Liliago 
Carex ericetorum 
Melica ciliata 
Asplenium septentrionale 
Lychnis viscaria and Dianthus caesius were in great beauty and 
perfection, and very abundant, and so were, in a more limited space, 
Biscutella laevigata, Anthericum Liliago and Hieracium Peleterianum, 
and another of the family of H.
murorum, with lanceolate leaves, often 
spotted.
It is, I suppose, the H.
maculatum of Smith.
H. Pilosella 
and H.
murorum were plentiful in the same place; and as far as the evi-

dence there found would go, nobody would doubt the two latter being 
perfectly distmct from the former.
On the 26th, 1 made an excursion on a cold and somewhat wet 
afternoon with Mr. Dellman, to get Saxifraga sponhemica and Oxy- 
tropis pilosa.
The first we found in great abundance.
It grows 
just where the little stream of the Ellerbach issues above Sponheim, 
from a rocky gorge.
I would not pronounce it different from S.
hypnoides ; but as this is the original place whence the plant was 
first described, and from whence the name was taken, it was well 
worth an effort.
The petiole is flat, while that of S.
hypnoides, ac- 
cording to Koch, is inflated and semiterete.
In the other we failed.
Mr. Dellman had not himself gathered it, and we probably missed the 
precise spot, for there is sufficient authority to make us believe that 
it exists abundantly somewhere near the Castle of Bockenheim, and 
there is i)lenty of wild, rocky, and broken ground about, which it 
would take almost a day to examine ; and it was nearly 8 o'clock be- 
fore we got there.
The manner in which plants disappear is often 
very curious.
We find a species common in a certain district, which 
seems its natural position.
Leaving this we meet with it in particular 
spots, but not spreading over the country.
These outliers become 
more and more detached, and there is sometimes a distance of 50 or 
even 100 miles from one of them to the nearest point where the plant 
is again found ; yet still it is there abundant, though one sees no 
reason why, growing there, it should not also occur in a hundred 
other places in the same neighbourhood.
Last of all the individuals 
become very scarce, even in these localities.
Oxytropis pilosa is a 
plant of eastern Germany, and is said not to be found elsewhere 
among all the valleys of the Rhine.
Cistus hirsutus has made a 
longer leap than this, not being found between Brittany and Spain ; 
and Ononis reclinata (or mollis) skips over part of France, and the 
whole of England, to fix itself on the Mull of Galloway.
Tragopogon 
orientalis is abundant in the meadows, and Achillea nobilis on walls 
and dry banks.
On the 28th I walked to Roxheim, gathering by the way Veronica 
triphyllos and precox.
From Roxheim I proceeded towards Guten- 
berg, and just as the road begins to descend towards the latter place, 
gathered the Anemone sylvestris, which was the chief object of my 
walk.
It is very abundant, but in a very limited district, and I 
Toamed through the woods on each side without meeting with any 
more of it.
In the same place grew Orchis militaris.
The Hp, in all 
I saw of this plant in Germany, keeps very steadily to one form, while 
19 
in those which I gathered last year in France (Phytol.
i. 789) it was 
continually varying.
Rosa spinosissima is here glandular in the veins 
and on the margin, forming double serratures ; perhaps R.
myriacan- 
tha of De Candolle.
This form seems, however, nearly confined to 
the neighbourhood of Roxheim.
On the 29th I went to the salt-works, where long sheds covering a 
high pile of faggots deform the valley, â€” and ascended the Roth en fells, 
one side of which forms a magnificent precipice of reddish porphyry, 
of I suppose above 600 feet in height.
The gentler slope on the 
north side afforded Potentilla rupestris, and on the upper part abun- 
dance of Orchis sambucina, but almost out of flower.
On the steep 
descent to the south, there was abundance of Dictamnus Fraxinella, 
and I sat down to admire its magnificent tufts before I attempted to 
gather them.
I then crossed the Nahe by a ferry; and after gathering 
SaxifragaAizoon near the river, scrambled up the hollow which sepa- 
rates the Rhein-grafenstein from the Gans.
Here was none of the 
Biscutella laevigata which I had found the day before so abundantly 
in a similar hollow ; and it is remarkable, that Dianthus caesius, 
which is here so abundant, does not grow on the opposite rocks of 
the Rothenfells, while on the other hand, the Dictamnus is not found 
on the Gans, or the Rhein-grafenstein, and the Orchis sambucina 
very sparingly, or not at all.
In such rambles, an Englishman misses 
some plants elsewhere common in his own country, such as the two 
species of Ulex and Scilla nutans, none of which seem to be found 
on the Rhine.
On the 30th I hunted for the Asarum, which, as Mr. Dellman 
assured me, grows about two miles from Kreuznach, on the foot of 
some rocks on the banks of the Ellerbach.
I found it in fruit, but 
the dry permanent nature of the blossoms left me little to regret.
In 
the afternoon T went to Bingen ; and on the 31st, had a walk up and 
round the Reichers Berg, to hunt for Sagina ciliata, which I did not 
find.
My only prize was Potentilla alba, pretty completely out of 
flower.
Podospermum laciniatum, Crepis tectorum, Silene conica, 
and one or two other plants not rare on the Continent, but which I 
had not lately seen, occurred near the chapel.
The walk, however, 
is a beautiful one, with finely varied views on the Rhine, and on the 
Nahe.
The views up the Rhine, in particular, are delightful ; and 
only want the effect of a mixture of larger trees to rival the most per- 
fect river-scenes in Europe.
Afterwards I proceeded to Maintz, 
where I did little.
The immediate neighbourhood is not favourable 
to Botany â€” I know not what it may offer at a greater distance.
The 
20 
immense fortifications occupy a considerable space all round the 
town, and beyond these, all the level spaces seem occupied by corn, 
and the slopes by vineyards.
Euphorbia esula, E.
stricta, and 
E. Gerardiana are abundant, and in some places Anchusa officinalis.
Iris spuria grows in some meadows on the right bank of the Rhine, 
near Gisheim, but I sought for it without success.
At Mannheim, I 
had on a former occasion gathered Trapanatans, but I could not now 
find it.
I had also remarked a sandy tract of low hills, partially 
covered with pine-woods, where I had met with Kochia arenaria and 
Alyssum raontanum.
I thought a further investigation, and at an ear- 
lier season, could not fail to be productive.
I was not disappointed, 
since Pyrola umbellata grows there, but the flowers were not open.
P. 
chlorantha was in great abundance, and in good condition, but unfor- 
tunately, at the time I supposed it to be, Pyrola minor.
This and P.
secunda are also found in this tract ; and one or two specimens of P.
minor and uniflora are said to have been gathered here.
The Mono- 
tropa had just begun to exhibit above ground its curved stem.
Orchis militaris here grows on the sand ; and Crepis tectorum and 
Phleum Boehmeri are plentiful.
The other plants found in my walk, 
were Diplotaxis viminea and Erucastrum Pollichii.
I hunted the 
meadows both on the Nahe and the Rhine, without finding anything 
interesting.
On the evening of the 4th I went to Diirkheim, and botanized 
there on the 5th and 6th.
The best stations are little bushy banks 
here and there found among the vineyards, on a low range of hills on 
the north-east of the town, which are partially calcareous.
Here 
grow Stipa pennata, Inula germanica not yet in flower, Globularia 
vulgaris, Galium glaucum in fruit.
Arenaria Jacquinii is very abundant.
I know not why Koch has rejected the names both of Jacquin and of 
De Candolle, to give one of his own.
Physalis Alkekengi grows in 
one corner of a vineyard ; but these corners and bushy slopes have 
been much abridged, and the plant is all but extirpated.
Mr. Konig 
had showed it me three years ago.
Althaea hirsuta is said to be con- 
fined to one spot, but I happened to light upon it.
There are also 
Linum tenuifolium, Sedum rupestre and Crepis tectorum, with 
Sclera carissa and Dianthus prolifer.
Anthericum ramosum, which 
I had gathered in full flower on the 8th of July, three years ago, did 
not yet show its flowering stems.
A Potentilla, which I suppose to be 
cinerea, but which I confess I cannot with any certainty distinguish 
from P.
verna, is also very abundant.
(To be continued).

Notice of ' The Annals and Magazine of Natural History^ 
No. 93.
December, 1844.
The botanical articles in this number are three : a continuation of 
Mr. Ralfs' paper on the Desmideae, which was read before the 
Botanical Society of Edinburgh, in last June ; an abstract by Mr.
Henfrey, of M.
Gaudichaud's report on M.
Duchartre's memoir ' On 
the Organogeny of the Flower, and particularly of the Ovary, in 
Plants with a free central Placenta;' and a review of Newman's 
' History of British Ferns.' 
Mr. Ralfs' paper describes the genus Cosmarium, of Corda, and 
ten species, several of which appear to be new.
They are 
found, like the other genera and species of this obscure but not unin- 
teresting tribe of plants, in boggy pools ; many of them by the author, 
near Penzance and Dolgelly, others in Sussex, by Mr. Jenner, and in 
various localities by other botanists.
We have experienced much 
pleasure in viewing these minute plants aided by a powerful micro- 
scope ; and sincerely hope that through the labours of Messrs.
Ralfs, 
Jenner, and Hassal, they will, ere long, be introduced more fully to 
the notice of our British botanists.
The paper on Organogeny will be read with some interest by those 
who study this abstruse yet highly important branch of botanical 
science ; but we cannot venture on making a further abridgement, 
and must be content with extracting this brief summary of the 
author's views.
1. All organization commences in the cell.
2. Eveiy so-called appendicular organ of vegetation and fructification results 
from a cell endued with vitality.
3. The organized cell produces a bud of leaves, flowers, or ovules.
4. All pre-exists in eveiy such bud ; no fresh organization is added to it, any more 
than to the cell.
5. The order of succession of the parts in the leaf or flower-buds, as well as in the 
ovules, always takes place from the circumference to the centre.
The review of the ' History of British Ferns,' is very flattering to 
the author of that work, and is evidently written by one who is master 
of the subject.
Commencing with the Equisetacese, we observe the reviewer ad- 
mits the necessity of the somewhat startling changes proposed in their 
nomenclature, as : â€” 
22 
Equisetura Mackaii, Newman, vice elongatum, Hooker, 
fluviatile, Linneus, vice limosura, Smith and Hooker, 
umbrosum, TVilldenow, vice Drummondii, Hooker, 
Telmateia, Ehrhart, vice fliivialile, Smith and Hooker.
This is particularly gratifying, since the Equisetacese were origi- 
nally published in the ' Phytologist,' and several protests have been 
entered against the changes.
It has always apj^eared to us that the 
more nearly we can attain uniformity in botanical nomenclature, the 
more simple and intelligible will the study become ; and since our 
continental neighbours are not likely to adopt little errors which we 
may have accidentally committed in these matters, it is better for us 
to correct them with a good grace as soon as they are made ma- 
nifest.
The reviewer entertains similar views of numerous other 
changes proposed by Mr, Newman.
The vexed question of Lastra^a dilatata is fully discussed by the 
reviewer, and the three species proposed by Mr. Newman freely ad- 
mitted to be such : the reviewer, however, does not assent to the pro- 
posed new nomenclature ; the name of reciirva he considers objec- 
tionable, and to " convey a totally wrong idea of the character of the 
frond" On this point we are somewhat at issue with our contempo- 
rary.
Mr. Newman had no choice in the selection of the name, as it 
is confessedly the only one under which the species had been pre- 
viously described, and we much doubt whether it does convey a wrong 
idea: the edges of the pinnules and divisions are hent backwards, or 
recurved, and form little concavities on the surface of the frond.
In 
PterisAquilina,Mr. Newman, following many of the highest authorities, 
has described the margin of the pinnules as " incurved^'' a descrip- 
tion which we believe has never been criticised ; indeed, the term 
incurved is almost invariably employed to exj)ress this character.
Now the margin in L.recurva being curled back in an exactly opposite 
direction to that in Pteris Aquilina, &c., may, with like propriety, be 
called re-curved.
On many other species there are observations 
quite worth perusing, and we may characterize the entire review as 
penned with fairness and good feeling.
The following note on Elatine Hydropiper will be read with inte- 
rest.
" Mr. W.
O. Newnham, of St. John's College, Cambridge, has 
found this very rare plant in two ponds near Farnham, Surrey, on 
opposite sides of the town, namely, Frensham pond, and Cuck Mills 
pond : in both places it was accompanied by E.
hexandra.
It is a 
most interesting addition to the Flora of the south of England, and 
the young naturalist by whom it has been discovered, deserves great 
23 
credit for accuracy of observation.
The only recorded habitats are in 
AuQ-lesea and Ireland.

Of these papers, the second will be considered the most interesting to 
British botanists ; and thiswesbouldhave entitled somewhat differently, 
since it is a proposed change in the name of the Anglesea Helianthe- 
mum guttatum, rather than a description of a new British species.
M. Planchon thinks the Cistus guttatus of Hudson a distinct plant 
from the Helianthemum guttatum of the south of France ; and he 
proposes to call the former Helianthemum Breweri.
He appears to 
regard the Helianthemum guttatum of English Floras, as composed 
of two plants.
One found in Jersey he believes to be a hispid variety 
of the true H.
guttatum ; the other, first found by Mr. Brewer, and 
subsequently by other botanists, in Anglesea, he considers distinct, 
and assigns it the following characters : â€”

Notice of the Naturalists' Almanack, for 1845.* 
We learn from the advertisements that this useful little Almanack 
for the coming year has been edited by Mr. Henry Doubleday, than 
whom we have no naturalist more competent to the task ; and on the 
present occasion he has accomplished his luidertaking in a manner 
that fully bears out his previous reputation for pains-taking and accu- 
rate observation.
Mr. Doubleday's well-known predilection for birds 
and insects, has, of course, led him to devote a great portion of the 
space to these interesting classes ; but there are valuable notices of 
plants scattered throughout the ' Naturalists' Calendar;' and p.
29 is 
filled with a list of the dates, during four successive years, on which a 
great number of plants came into flower at Epping.
We should pre- 
fer a portion of each year's Almanack being occupied by a complete 
monograph of some small family of British plants or animals, since 
such monographs give the work a far more enduring interest ; and ren- 
der it a desideratum to naturalists, long after the year of its date has 
expired.
We have heard many commendatory observations on the 
Almanack for 1844, on the ground of its containing Mr. Newsman's 
descriptive list of the British Ferns ; and we believe it is still sought 
for on this account, even at a time when its value, as a diary of 
scientific meetings, and the usual almanack matter, has expired.
On the Influence of the Mild Climate of Torquay on Flowering 
Plants.
By J.
A. Walker, Esq., Lieut.
H. P., 34th Regt.
Nov. 1.
I BEG to send a few fragments of bloom which still lingers, in 
my sea-side garden, on the Privet, Dog-rose, and Gum Cistus.
Of the 
first there is a good deal : of the others, only a solitary blossom here 
and there.
In December, 1842, there was, up to the 10th or 12th of 
the month, a Dahlia in very good bloom, within a few feet of the edge

of the rocks, and with no other shelter than a parapet wall just high 
enough to ensure the safety of my younger pupils.
(Aspect S.W.) 
It is one of the marked peculiarities of the Torbay district, that not 
only ordinary trees, but many evergreens, thrive almost within a 
stone's cast of the high-water mark.
I believe the same circumstance 
is observable on some parts of the sea-coast near the town of Wex- 
ford, Ireland.
In noting the distribution of plants, it might be wor- 
thy of inquiry, what varieties marked localities favourable to health, 
and the reverse.
Nov. 26.
I beg to inclose a wild strawberry which was found in a 
wood near Torquay, yesterday, weighing, when pulled, including the 
stalk, rather more than fifteen grains (Troy).
Had it been discovered 
in a cultivated state, and in a sheltered garden, I should not have 
been so much sui"prised.
I add blossoms of the Gum Cistus, wall- 
flower, privet, &c., which I pulled on an open terrace, in my exposed 
sea-side garden this morning, although there was a smart hoar frost 
over-night.
For the strawberry, I am indebted to Mr. W.
Pengelly, 
the very able master of the Pestalozzian day-school, Torquay.

Note on the supposed Equisetum limosum of Linn ens.
By Edward Newman, F.L.S.
I HAVE received several letters respecting this plant, and much 
regret that I am still unable to give any satisfactory information 
respecting it.
Mr. S.
P. Woodward (Phytol.
i. 878) speaks of an 
Irish Equisetum, as "in the hands of Mr. Newman to name;" and 
this perhaps has led some of the readers of the 'Phytologist' to anti- 
cipate seeing, in the pages of that work, a figure and description of 
an additional British species of Equisetum ; but I have no materials 
in my hands that w^ill enable me to decide whether this supposed 
species is really distinct from that already described under the name 
of E.
fluviatile.
The facts of the case are these : when giving a 
good deal of attention to the interesting task of discriminating the 
confused species of Lastrsea, I wrote to Dr. Taylor, hoping that spe- 
cimens from his neighbourhood, and his excellent judgment, might 
throw some light on the subject.
In the letter containing Dr.
Taylor's reply were contained fragments of a large Equisetum, but 
Vol. II.
E 
26 
so shattered that I could make little of them : those who may have 
entrusted well dried Equiseta to the tender care of the post-office, 
may in some measure imagine how they would travel from DunkeiTon 
to London in a thin sheet of letter paper.
When Mr. S.
P. Wood- 
ward was on the botanical tour, an account of which was subse- 
quently published in the ' Phytologist,' he visited Dr. Taylor, and 
procured more perfect specimens of the plant â€” and these he has 
since obligingly shown me.
From an examination of them, I enter- 
tain much doubt whether they are strictly identical with the true E.
fluviatile, so common about London, but as yet I am not in posses- 
sion of characters whereby to separate the two as species.
I learn 
that this Equisetum grows in boggy ground, on the hills, in the 
neighbourhood of Dunkerron, in such vast abundance, as to be cut 
and made into ricks, as winter fodder for cattle.
At the time of Mr.
Woodward's visit to Dunkerron, he saw several of these ricks.
I am 
told that the stem is always simple, i.
e., without branches, and that 
the plant does not grow in the water, which the Equisetum fluviatile 
of Linneus, whether branched or unbranched, certainly does.
I had no knowledge of this Irish plant until after I had printed 
that portion of my ' History of British Ferns,' in which the Equise- 
taceae are described ; yet meagre as was ray information respecting it, 
I could not pass it by when completing the Synopsis, which, although 
placed in the work before the descriptions, was written and printed 
last of all : a notice of the plant was therefore introduced â€” I confess 
a most vague and unsatisfactory one, but it communicated all 1 knew 
then, and all that I know up to the present hour.
I am induced to 
recur to the subject on the present occasion, because in the review of 
my 'History of British Fenis,' which has just appeared in the 
' Annals,' and for which I feel much indebted to the author (whom I 
presume to be Mr. Babington), this Equisetum is again brought 
under notice.
" Before proceeding," says the reviewer, " we may 
state that Fries distinguishes the two Linnaean plants, saying of 
E. limosum, ' ramulis vagis Isevibus vaginis viridi-dentatis ' and of 
E. fluviatile ' vaginis raraul, atris' (H.
Scan, 155) ; he considers both 
of them as more or less constantly branching, nor can we agree with 
Mr. Newman's observation (at page 7), that the limosum (Linn.) 
never branches.
At that page he separates the unbranched form of 
the British E.
limosum from E.
fluviatile, but does not characterize 
it, only stating, we think, incorrectly, that it ' never, under any cir- 
cumstances, becomes branched.'" The state of the case is this, at 
page 51, I figure and describe a very common species of Equisetum, 
27 
which is clearly identical with the Equisetura fliiviatile of Linneus.
This species is generally branched, but it is impossible to examine 
any number of stems without finding a considerable portion un- 
branched.
These unbranched stems I supposed to be the Equisetum 
limosum of Linneus ; but before writing the Synopsis, I met with the 
Irish plant, and the appearance of this was so dissimilar, that I 
thought it might be a species, and perhaps the Linnean sjDecies 
limosum, so I retracted the opinion previously expressed, that the 
Linnean limosum was the unbranched form of the common fluviatile, 
since the new plant answered his description equally well, and had 
much more appearance of being distinct from E.
fluviatile ; from the 
description handed by my correspondents, I was able to say that the 
new plant " appears to grow at a greater elevation, to prefer boggy or 
muddy localities to actual water, and never under any circumstances 
to become branched." The reviewer, in this instance, by altering the 
wording, quite alters my meaning, and makes me ^^^Qdk 'positively of 
a fact of which I had no positive knowledge.
The reviewer, in saying 
that I separate " the unbranched form, &c.," quite mistakes my inten- 
tion : the London ditch plant is either branched or unbranched, both 
kinds of stem growing from one rhizoma : I never thought of sepa- 
rating these.
The Dunkerron plant may also be branched or un- 
branched, but I only see it and hear of it as unbranched ; it is this 
Dunkerron plant that I separate, and not the unbranched form of the 
London plant.
When I supposed that the unbranched form of the 
London plant was the limosum of Linneus, I treated it as a mere 
casualty, and still think 1 was justified in doing so ; but when I 
receive examples of a second plant, differing in habitat and in several 
characters, I think it possible I may have a second species, and do 
not unite it with either the branched or unbranched form of the 
Loudon plant.

November 29, 1844.
â€” Eighth Anniversary Meeting; J.E.Gray, 
Esq., F.R.S., President, in the chair.
From the Report of the Coun- 
cil it appeared that 17 members had been elected since the last An- 
niversary, and that the Society now consisted of 173 members.
The 
28 
Report of the Herbarium Committee for the year ending 29th Nov.
1844, was read.
The Reports were unanimously adopted ; after which a ballot took 
place for the Council for the ensuing year, when the Chairman was 
re-elected President, and he nominated Edward Doubleday, Esq., 
F.L.S., and Dr. Bossey, Vice-Presidents ; Mr. F.
Barham, Dr. Cooke, 
F.L.S., and Mr. S.
P. Woodward, were elected new Members of the 
Council, and Mr. J.
Reynolds, Mr. G.
E. Dennes, and Mr. T.
Sansom, 
were respectively re-elected.
Treasurer, Secretary, and Librarian.
The Report of the Herbarium Committee embodies a general 
sketch of the Society's present condition, in its scientific departments, 
and runs thus : â€” 
In presenting their Report for the present year, the Herbarium 
Committee may congratulate the Society on the favourable progress 
made in those departments which come more immediately under the 
superintendence of the Committee ; and upon which the eflaciency of 
the Society, and its estimation before the public, are so materially 
dependant.
Exchange of British Specimens.
â€” Although other objects were 
contemplated on the first institution of the Society, and some of these 
have been carried into effect as far as practicable, yet it has always 
been considered that the Society's highest utihty would be found in 
the exchange of specimens, and improving the private herbaria of 
members by the distribution of new or local plants.
The attention 
of the Committee has been sedulously devoted to this object ; and 
great assistance has been given by the ready kindness of members, in 
sending supplies of newly discovered, or otherwise interesting, 
plants : the specimens of which have been promptly and regularly 
distributed to the other members who required them.
Varieties even 
of common species, have likewise been distributed, whenever ob- 
tained, since changes fi'om their ordinary characters often bear im- 
portantly on the practical distinction of species.
In addition, several 
current errors in nomenclature have been corrected, by the distribu- 
tion of specimens collected and labelled expressly for this purpose.
These novelties, &c., have been latterly enclosed to members, along 
with the specimens marked as their desiderata in the Edinburgh Cata- 
logue, which could not include them.
But as the London Catalogue 
of British Plants, lately printed for the Society, included all disco- 
veries announced up to the end of 1843, the members will now be 
enabled to apply for past novelties and varieties in the usual manner, 
by drawing a short horizontal mark against the numbers which pre- 
29 
cede theiv names in the new catalogue.
Already, however, additions 
and corrections require to be made to that new catalogue ; examples 
of which will continue to be sent to the members (although not spe- 
cially asked for) as the specimens can be procured.
It unfortunately 
happens that the Society's Anniversary occurs at a period of the year 
which is most incovenient for the Herbarium Committee to make their 
report.
It is precisely the time when fresh parcels are coming in, 
with the results of the summer labours of collectors ; although too 
early for any examination of their contents to have been made.
Still, it may be observed, that the specimens already received, or 
promised, are sufficient to warrant an opinion on the part of the 
Committee, that there will be a very good stock of duplicates for dis- 
tribution early in 1845, including many valuable specimens.
It is 
not deemed necessary to lengthen the present Report, by any detailed 
enumeration of the species ; they will be seen and estimated by the 
members who receive them from the Society.
But the Committee 
feel justified in observing, that the circulation of specimens through 
the Botanical Society, is truly the very best method for making 
known new discoveries, and correcting errors of nomenclature.
By 
this step, the discovery or correction is promptly placed before the 
eyes of numerous active botanists, in the best possible form â€” that of 
actual specimens in proof of its reality or truth.
While the unvarying 
regularity of distribution, which has hitherto so peculiarly and exclu- 
sively distinguished the Botanical Society of London, affords a strong 
additional inducement for making this Society the general centre of 
inter-communication between the botanists of Britain.
The Com- 
mittee are well aware (and would by no means wish to conceal the 
fact), that in the few first years of the Society's existence, from 1836 
to 1840, the system of labelling and distributing the specimens was 
very faulty.
At the present time, with increased experience, and im- 
proved arrangements, in this respect, it is believed that the Society's 
labels and specimens may now be safely appealed to in questions 
of nomenclature ; though liable, no doubt, to the imperfections of 
science, at any single period, as well as to those occasional inad- 
vertencies which may occur in the labelling of many thousand of spe- 
cimens.
Since the last Keport of the Committee, parcels have been 
received from W.

Exchange of Foreign Plants.
â€” The limited finances of the Society 
have hitherto prevented the engagement of a Curator sufficiently con- 
versant with Botany, for the labelling of foreign specimens.
Nor, 
indeed, have more than very few of the members expressed any wish 
to be supplied with exotic plants.
Small packets of specimens from 
the following countries can now be distributed ; namely, Europe, 
Azores (Watson and Hunt), New South Wales (Anderson and others), 
New Zealand (Allan Cunningham), Norfolk Island and New Zealand 
Ferns (A.
Cunningham).
It is expected that sets of North American 
plants (Gavin Watson, and Kelvington), will be ready in the course 
of 1845.
But the Committee will not venture to promise, that the 
tropical plants (East Indies, &c.), can be got ready within the next 
twelve months.
British Herbarium.
â€” Under the active exertions of the Secretary, 
(who promptly solicits examples of new and interesting plants, for 
the use of the Society), the Reference Herbarium of British plants 
has received many valuable additions, which have been, or will be, 
duly announced, in the Reports of the Society's monthly meetings, 
published in the ' Phytologist,' and other periodicals.
Among others, the following may be particularly mentioned : â€” 
Spergula stricta, presented by Mr. G.
S. Gibson ; Carduus setosus, 
by Dr. Dewar ; Teucrium Botrys, by Mr. T.
Ingall ; OEnanthe 
fluviatilis, by Mr. Bentall ; Galium Vaillantii, by Mr. G.
S. Gibson, 
new to England, although another form of the same species was long 
ago reported in Scotland, by G.
Don ; Bromus commutatus, var.
puhens, by Mr. H.
C. Watson.
And in addition to these novelties, 
the Committee have to record their thanks to Mr. Edwin Lees, for a 
nearly complete set of British fruticose Rubi.
Foreign Herbarium.
â€” The progress of a general Herbarium has 
been checked by the same circumstance which has interfered with 
the exchange of foreign plants ; and the Committee feel that the 
formation of a good general Herbarium cannot be expected for the 
present.
At the same time, it may be stated, that some tardiness in 
this respect is the less to be regretted ; since the Committee have 
31 
reason for believing, that a good private collection, already including 
many thousands of species, and still rapidly increasing, will event- 
ually come into the possession of the Society.
Cryptogamic Collections.
â€” Numerous important additions to this 
department of the Society's Herbarium have been made during the 
year, chiefly by the following gentlemen ; namely, Messrs.
Gray, 
Thwaites, Bowerbank, Stephens, Dennes, Fordham, Beezley, Riley, 
Jackson, Gardiner, Merrick, Sidney, Muggridge, Sidebotham, 
Ibbotson, Rollings, Croall, Torry, and Sansom.
To Dr. Ayres, and 
Mr. H.
O. Stephens, the Committee are indebted for many valuable 
specimens of Fungi.
And to Mr. Bowerbank, for a collection of 
Algae, from the African coast, at Algoa Bay.
Local Herbaria.
â€” The Herbarium of Thame, in Oxfordshire, has 
been completed by Dr. Ayres.
A portion of that for Embleton, in 
Northumberland, has been presented by Mr. Embleton.
That of 
Esher, in Surrey, has been collected by Mr. Watson, but is not yet 
fastened to paper.
Mr. Salmon has commenced one for the neigh- 
bourhood of Godalming, in the same county.
The Rev. W.
R. 
Crotch is forming one for the neighbourhood of Taunton, in 
Somersetshire.
December 6, 1844.
â€” J.
Reynolds, Esq., Treasurer, in the chair.
Dr. Dewar presented specimens of Carduus setosus, discovered by 
himself, in July last, three miles from Dumfermline, Fifeshire.
This 
being a plant of Eastern Europe, and apparently hitherto unknown 
on the western coasts, there seems much probability that the seed has 
been accidentally imported from Russia.
Its nearest ally in Britain 
is C.
arvensis.
Mr. Thomas Bentall presented specimens of CEnanthe 
fluviatilis (of Coleman), collected by himself, in the river, near Hal- 
stead, Essex, in July.
The Rev. W.
R. Crotch presented specimens of Helianthemum 
Breweri {Planchon), collected in the long-known locality of Holyhead 
Mountain, Anglesea.
This species has hitherto been confounded with 
H. guttatum, by all British botanists; but is figured as an undescribed 
species in the 'London Journal of Botany,' for November, 1844, 
and explanations given in the succeeding number of the same 
periodical.
The true H.
guttatum, from the south of France, was shown to be 
quite a different plant, by specimens laid before the Society.
Mr. Hewett Watson called the attention of the Society to a series 
of specimens, in illustration of the three species of CEnanthe de- 
scribed by Mr. Ball, in the ' Annals of Natural History,' under the 
32 
names of pimpinelloides, Lachenalii, and silaifolia.
Mr, Watson 
stated that these species had been confused and misnamed by Hud- 
son and Smith, and that most succeeding botanists had in conse- 
quence been misled about them ; the errors and confusion being greatly 
increased by the want of root and fruit, oil specimens collected for 
herbaria.
He considered that Mr. Lees was the first English botanist 
who correctly understood the true pimpinelloides.
Mr. Babington 
next rightly determined the Lachenalii.
And lastly, Mr. Ball, con- 
trasting these two plants with the peucedanifolia of Smith, showed 
clearly enough that three indigenous species had been confused into 
two only, on account of no single botanist being sufficiently ac- 
quainted with all three.
Specimens sent to the Society by the Rev.
A. Bloxam, Mr. Lees, Mr. G.
S. Gibson, and Mr. Thwaites, with 
others collected by Mr. Watson himself, illustrated the three species 
clearly ; except that the early radical leaves, and perfectly mature 
fruit, of Smith's peucedanifolia ; were still wanting.
Mr. Watson, 
however, suspected that Mr. Ball's name of silaifolia was equally 
incorrect as Smith's name of peucedanifolia ; and not knowing any 
other described species to which Smith's plant could be referred, he 
adopted the name of CEnanthe Smithii ; to be temporary or perma- 
nent, as occasion might require.
Having sent a paper to the 
* Phytologist,' on the subject, he would not extend his remarks fur- 
ther before the Society.
The following is an abbreviation of the spe- 
cific characters proposed for the species : â€” 
1. (E.
pinipinelloides,'L\xm.
Tubers oval or sub-spherical, connected 
with the stem by a slender peduncle.
Fruit cylindrical, about as 
broad as the calyx, callous at the base, not contracted.
2. CE.
Lachenalii, Gmel.
Tubers elongated and slender, clavate, 
fusiform, or subcylindrical, gradually enlarging from the base of the 
stem, without any distinct peduncle.
Fruit oblong or turbinate, 
broader than the calyx, contracted and without callosity at base.
3. CE.
Smithii, H.
Wats.
Tubers short and thick, clavate, fusi- 
foim, or oblong, sessile at the base of the stem.
Fruit cylindrical, 
scarcely so broad as the calyx, callous at the base, not contracted.
The Society has specimens of these three species for distribution, 
but those of pimpinelloides and Smithii are, unfortunately, few in 
number, and by no means in good condition.
So long as they will 
last, examples will be introduced into each parcel, sent out in rotation, 
in order to correct errors of nomenclature, which may be expected in 
most British herbaria.

Notes on a Botanical Tour hi Germany.
By Joseph Woods, Esq., F.L.S.
(Continued from page 21).
On the 6th, I again rambled in the woods without adding much to 
my former observations.
Thesium intermedimn of Koch, is very 
common along the Rhine, and is, I believe, what we in England call 
T. linophyllum.
I here added T.
pratense, which differs very dis- 
tinctly both in the calyx of the fruit, and in the root.
Cystea fragilis 
and Polypodium Dryopteris are common, but I was surprised to meet 
wdth P.
Phegopteris on the dry banks.
I followed a little brawling 
stream down to the valley beyond Hardenburg, but it gave me 
nothing.
Such a brook would have had more interest in England.
At Hardenburg there are some very fine ruins of a noble castle.
Tetra- 
gonolobus siliquosus was growing on some boggy ground in another 
place.
I walked on the 7th as far as Maxdorf, a village nearly half 
way to Mannheim : I had been shown, on a former occasion, a mea- 
dow full of Dianthus superbus and Gentiana Pneumonanthe, and I 
was desirous of seeing if it would not yield something at an earlier 
season.
I found there Gentiana utriculosa and Polygala amara.
A 
little nearer to Diirkheim grows Carex hornschuchiana.
Koch, in 
his 'Taschenbuch,' seems to have given up the distinction of the 
roots between this and C.
fulva, and to depend on other characters, 
which, however, are not very satisfactory ; the principal being the 
comparative length of the sheathing leaves.
I did not see on the 
hills at Diirkheim, either Trifolium alpestre or montanum, both of 
which are common hill-plants further down the Rhine, but they both 
appear in this low sandy district, as does also Arnica montana.
After leaving Diirkheim, I botanized at Heidelberg, on the 10th 
and 11th.
The immediate neighbourhood is not rich.
I gathered 
Chaerophyllum aureum and Thesium montanum, under the direction 
of Professor Bischoff.
Spiraea Aruncus is common in the woods, and 
Bromus inermis by the way side.
On the 12th, I had a walk to 
Heilbronn, on the " hunter sandstein," east of the town.
A little cliff 
separates the vineyards from the woodland.
It seems as if some beds 
of a schistose nature formed a useful soil for the vines, and these 
being dug out, have left a perpendicular cliff : all below is vineyard, 
all above thicket.
We havie therefore none of those ambiguous banks 
between the two, which often afford such favourable situations.
I got 
Iris sambucina (plentiful in some places on the banks between the 
F 
34 
vineyards, just below the woods), and Rosa gallica sparingly; Crepis 
praemorsa also occurred, but the variety of plants was small.
West 
of the town, my map says that the hills are of limestone, but the 
forest in that direction is farther off.
On going to Nuremberg, 
Lychnis viscaria shows itself by the road side; and T noticed Berteroa 
incana, which afterwards became very common.
On the 15th, I spent some time with Professor Koch, in the 
botanical garden, which contains a good collection of German plants; 
and in the afternoon, had a botanical walk with the gardener, whom 
Koch sent with me, and with Mr. Schnitzlein, a good botanist, and 
the author of a work with figures to explain the natural orders of 
plants.
Our walk lay chiefly in that part of an extensive forest of 
pines, which lies to the west of the road to Nuremberg, and which 
advances to within a mile of Erlangen, and some adjoining moist 
meadow lands.
The soil is everywhere sand.
In the woods it is also 
the moist parts which are most productive.
The drier parts are 
almost covered with Vaccinium Vitis-idaea, now in flower.
Our 
plants were Polygala amara, Sedum villosum, Trifolium hybridum 
{Koch), Chaerophyllum hirsutum, Hieracium praealtum, var.
fallax, 
Poa sudelica, Carex davalliana and brizoides, and Orchis angustifolia.
Orchis latifolia grows in the same places ; and here the eye readily 
learns to distinguish them : but as I have already observed, their 
forms must be traced in different localities before we can fully decide 
as to their specific distinction.
In some meadows on the other side 
of the little river, the next day I gathered Erysimum strictum, under 
the guidance of Professor Hoffrath Koch, and we saw also plants 
of Chaerophyllum bulbosum, and Ruraex maximus, but neither of 
them approaching to flowering.
Koch's knowledge of species, and 
readiness with their minute characteristics, is wonderful ; he seems to 
have everything of the sort at his finger's ends.
He is now publish- 
ing an enlarged edition of his ' Synopsis,' but I am afraid is rather 
too ready to multiply the number of species.
The sandy hills behind 
Erlangen offered me Dianthus deltoides, Trifolium spadiceum, Vicia 
tenuifolia, V.
villosa, var.
glabra, Lathyrus tuberosus, Pyrola secunda 
and rotundifolia, Caucalis latifolia, Eriophorum vaginatum.
The 
18th and 19th of June were spent in an excursion to Muggendorf, 
and I was very sorry when I saw the place, that I had not dedicated 
to it a longer time.
The country is of the Jura limestone, intersected 
with very narrow rocky valleys, richly adorned with wood, and each 
watered bv its own bright beautiful stream.
35 
The following plants were collected in this locality: â€” 
Anemone sylvesliis 
Actaea spicata 
Draba aizoides 
Alyssum saxatile, by tbe 
Great Miller's Hole; 
but even the seeds had 
for the most part dis- 
appeared 
Erysimum odoratum 
E. crepidifolium 
Polygala amara, on dry 
banks 
Orobus vernus 
Vicia sylvatica 
Fragaria elatior 
Rubus saxalilis 
Rosa rubiginosa, the fruit 
always smooth 
Spiraea Aruncus 
Peucedanum Oreoselinum 
Laserpitium latifolium 
Chferophyllum aureum 
Galium boreale 
Sambucus racemosa 
Leontodon incanum 
Hieracium prsealtum 
Crepis praeraorsa 
Chrysanthemum corymbo- 
sum 
Carduus defloratus 
Pyrola rotundifolia 
P. secunda 
Asarum europsum, com- 
mon 
Physalis Alkekengi, abun- 
dant 
Teucrium Botrys 
Ajuga Chamaepitys 
Orchis militaris 
Ophrys Nidus-Avis 
Cephalanthera pallens 
C, rubra 
Epipactis rubiginosa 
Lilium Martagon 
Sesleria caerulea 
Polypodium calcareum 
Cystopteris fragilis 
Erysimum odoratum and crepidifolium are very nearly allied, and 
as here found, both smell equally sweet.
Even the character depend- 
ed upon by Koch â€” the smooth angles of the pod in the first-named 
species, is not to be taken without some allowance ; and in the last, 
as exhibited at Muggendorf, the angular nerve is sometimes greener 
and less hairy than the flat faces of the pod.
The specimens from 
Kreuznach seem to exhibit this character more absolutely, and I 
should have been inclined to doubt whether all my Muggendorf 
plants did not belong to E.
odoratum, if Koch had not called them 
crepidifolium.
Erlaiigen will shortly be very accessible to the English traveller, as 
the rail-road now in progress from Bamberg to Augsburg passes 
through it.
There are steam-boats from Frankfort to Wiirzberg, so 
that the only part of the journey to be performed in the slow old- 
fashioned plan is from Wiirzberg to Bamberg, and this I think cannot 
continue long.
They talk of a rail-road from Nuremberg to Ratisbon.
There is already a canal.
From Erlangen to Neumarkt the soil is sandy, nearly level, and 
abounding in pine-forests.
Beyond Neumarkt (where there is an ex- 
cellent inn), we got upon hills of the Jura limestone, and there are a 
few beautiful spots, and tempting slopes, which the botanist would 
like to examine ; but on the whole, it is a country of little interest 
till we descend towards the Danube and approach Ratisbon, where 
some very beautiful valleys reminded me of Muggendorf.
Above 
Ratisbon, and on one side also of the Danube, for two or three miles 
below, the valley is bounded by rocky hills of the Jura limestone, on 
36 
which we find Clematis recta, Viola mirabilis, Polygala Chamajbiixus, 
Arenaria fastigiata, Cytisus ratisbonensis and nigricans, Lathyrus 
heterophyllus, Rosa gallica, Rosa cinnamomea, Rubus saxatilis, 
Astrantia major, Chserophyllum bulbosum, Crepis praemorsa and 
alpestris, Lactuca perennis, Centaurea paniculata, Cerinthe minor, 
Orobanche ca^rulescens, Cypripedium Calceolus (unfortunately for 
me) entirely out of flower : Euphorbia verrucosa is common every- 
where ; Alnus incana by the river side, Anthemis austriaca among 
the corn of the valley; Gypsophila saxifraga, on dry banks; Erica 
carnea in the woods ; the only Erica here.
I missed Thesium rostra- 
tum, Potentilla opaca and Hierochloe australis, all of which I ought 
to have found at the Schutz Felsen, so named, I believe, by Hopper, 
on account of the hollows with which the rocks abound, and which 
would give shelter to the botanist in all weathers.
They are limestone 
rocks on the banks of the Danube.
The great extent of the country 
about Ratisbon belongs to the green-sand formation.
Pyrola secunda 
is here very common in the forest; P.
minor, less so; P.
chlorantha, 
scarce.
Below Ratisbon, on the left bank, we come to granitic hills, 
on one of which stands the magnificent Walhalla.
The Walhalla, 
as everybody knows, is a Grecian temple, imitated from the Parthenon, 
and placed on the top of a succession of lofty-terraced walls, which 
at present are rather obtrusive.
The inside is adorned with the 
busts of the great men of Teutonic race, of all ages ; but we look in 
vain among them for that of Luther.
On these hills I gathered 
Cvtisus capitatus, and on the foot of the Walhallaberg, Stenactis 
annua and Physalis Alkekengi.
Great part of the road from Ratisbon to Munich was passed in the 
night, but it seems to be particularly without interest ; only as we 
approached the latter place, the towering ranges of the Alps come into 
view.
The botanical points near Munich are â€” First, the banks of the 
Isar, which brings down with it several mountain plants ; and which, 
above Harlacking, two miles above Munich, begin to be bold and 
rocky.
On the gravel of the river, and the adjoining thickets, we 
find Thalictrum aquilegi folium, ^thionema saxatilis, Polygala amara, 
Gypsophila repens, Myricaria germanica, Astrantia major, Galium 
boreale, Hieracium staticifolium, Gentiana cruciata, G.
Asclepiadea, 
Salix incana and Arundo littorea.
On the gravelly banks above, and 
quite free from any present action of the river, we have Biscutella 
laevigata, Dianthus caesius, Saxifraga mutata, Leontodon incanum, 
Arbutus Uva-ursi, Erica carnea, Orchis odoratissima, Herminium 
monorchis and Tofieldia palustris, a very common plant about 
Munich.
37 
Secondly.
Certain tracts of bog or boggy pasture, only one of which 
I visited ; and here, and on the low ground in the way to it, it is 
curious to observe the union of different plants, which in England we 
are not at all accustomed to see or to expect together.
Tofieldia 
palustris and Primula farinosa do not seem to require bog, but grow 
in close companionship with Dianthus superbus and D.
Carthusiano- 
rum.
Hardly separate from these we find Pinguicula officinalis, and, 
I believe, P.
alpina ; but of course there were neither flowers nor 
seeds.
Polygala amara is also here, Gentiana verna, and cruciata.
In the more complete bog (which is very superficial) we have Primula 
villosa, Pedicularis sceptrum, Gentiana utriculosa, SchcEnus nigri- 
cans and S.
ferrugineus, Utricularia minor.
Salvia verticillata and 
Bromus inermis are common almost everywhere.
I gathered also on 
my way to the bog, at Ludw igs-feld, Arenaria fastigiata and Teucrium 
montanum ; and on the other side of the Isar, Hypochceris helvetica 
and Orchis Coriophora.
Arnica montana and Cirsium bulbosum are 
common in moist places.
It may be supposed that I did not leave Munich without seeing 
some of the wonders of art for which it is now so celebrated.
The 
frescoes, on the whole, disappointed me : those of Hess, now in pro- 
gress in the Basilica, pleased me best ; and here the story is well told, 
and the figures graceful and spirited.
The coloui-ing, too, is often good, 
and the relief perfect.
In architecture, a little chapel attached to the 
palace is a perfect jewel, in what is called here the Byzantine style, 
which is nearly allied to our Norman.
The ground is gold, with figures 
of saints and angels, and the columns of a fine dark marble.
The 
whole effect is exceedingly rich and beautiful, and the chastened 
light (we do not see the windows from the body of the church) shows 
to great advantage a style of finish, which, when seen in the full day- 
light, is apt to be rather glaring.
The liudwig's kirche and the Au 
kirche are also beautiful buildings, and might be taken as types of the 
German gothic at two different periods.
The nineteen painted glass 
windows of the latter, each of which is said to have cost ^1200, are 
very much admired.
The Basilica also is probably a more perfect 
example of its style than any of the ancient ones now existing, and 
promises to be a building of a very high character of beauty.
Sixty- 
six noble columns, each of one piece of marble, adorn the interior.
In the endeavour to imitate classic antiquity, the artists have, I think, 
been less successful.
The Glyptotheca, and Pinacotheca are spacious 
buildings well suited to their purpose, but not possessing any striking 
character.
The library, and some other buildings, are imitations of 
38 
the Florentine style, and not very happy ; but a copy of theLoggie of 
Orcagna, at the end of the Ludwig's strasse, makes a very fine object, 
and altogether, the Ludwig's strasse itself is a magnificent or perhaps 
unrivalled entrance to the city.
The buildings on both sides are on 
a grand scale, and though some of them may individually be open to 
criticism, yet their defects are lost in the impressive magnificence of 
the whole.
From Munich I went to Passau, a very uninteresting ride, and it is 
not till we approach the latter place that the botanist observes any 
spot on which he would like to spend an hour or two, except per- 
haps the Erdinger moss, where we first met with it, at Kirch eim â€” a 
dreary place, where only a botanist could find anything inviting.
At 
Passau we are quite in a different country.
The banks of the Danube 
are steep and rocky, with small valleys opening into the larger.
I 
walked up the banks of the Inn, where Arundo littorea is abundant, 
and where I got also Geranium palustre ; I then turned into 
the forest ; 1 observed what I believe is Arundo stricta, in small 
quantity, and not yet in flower.
Soldanella montana, alas !
out of 
flower, but very abundant.
The next day I crossed the Danube, and 
walked up the sweet valley of the lis, which winds remarkably be- 
tween steep and often rocky banks, as it approaches the Danube.
It 
was rather above this beautiful part, on a side valley, that 1 met with 
some spongy meadows, which furnished, besides many things now too 
familiar to mention, an umbellate plant hardly in flower, which I have 
not yet determined, and Juncus filiformis.
The woods in this direc- 
tion gave me little, and I could not discover a single plant of 
Soldanella montana.
Yet the soil is, I believe, alike granite on both 
sides of the river.
In a boggy spot in the woods I observed Trientalis 
europsea ; Digitalis grandiflora is found in some of the sloping banks 
below the woods.
Carex davalliana occurs occasionally.
Berteroa 
incana and Spiraea Aruncus are very common.
From Passau I descended the Danube to Vienna, the first day in 
a continued rain, the second with intervals of fine weather.
The 
banks are less magnificent and romantic than those of the Rhine, and 
want, in great measure, the charms of the numerous castles which 
adorn the latter river.
But they are more varied and graceful in their 
forms, and with much more and better wood.
Nothing can be finer 
than the way in which the hills are broken in the openings of some 
of the lateral valleys, or more tempting to a botanist.
The staple 
conversation in the steam-boats, is the supei'iority of the Danube to 
the Rhine.
I found that the relation on whose account chiefly 1 had 
39 
prolonged ray journey as far as Vienna, had established himself for 
the present at a village about ten miles distant.
Thither I proceeded.
The place, Kaltenleutgeben, is seated in a small valley among lime- 
stone hills, a very pleasant place, and abounding in good plants.
I 
took the rail-road to a village called Leising, and there hired a sort of 
cart, made of basket work, with a seat upon springs.
On the way we 
found Lepidium Draba, Astragalus onobrychioides, and A.
cicer.
Lathyrus tuberosus, Dipsacus laciniatus, not in flower ; Salvia syl- 
vestris, Verbascum phlomoides, Linaria genistifolia.
And in my walks 
about the place, I added: â€” 
iEtliionema saxatilis 
Poly gala major 
P. Chamaebuxus, in 
fruit 
Gypsophila saxifraga 
Coronilla Emerus, and C.
montana, both in fruit 
Dorycniura fruticosum 
Orobus niger, and O.
ver- 
nus, botb out of flower 
Vicia cassubica 
Potentilla recta 
P. inclinata ?
Knautia sylvatica 
Leontodon incanura 
Anthemis austriaca 
Cirsium pannonicum 
Nonea pulla 
Stachys alpina 
Melampymm nemorosum 
Orobanche cruenta 
Teucrium montanum 
Asamra europEeum, quite 
over 
Cyclamen europseum 
Lysimachia punctata 
Verbascum orientals 
Epipactis raicrophylla 
Cypripedium Calceolus, out 
of flower 
Lilium Martagon 
Veratrum album and V.
ni- 
grum, not yet in flower.
And afterwards, on a 
second visit 
Seseli Hippomarathrum 
Inula ensifolia 
Globularia cordifolia and 
Sideritis montana 
I went twice from Vienna to a place called the Brigittenau, forming 
part of one of the islands of the Danube.
The place is of little interest 
in itself, but is said to be the station of some rare plants.
I was not 
successful, and found nothing but what is common about Vienna, 
except Veronica austriaca, in seed.
Podospermum Jacquinii is abun- 
dant, and so is Atriplex nitens, but not yet in flower, and an Atriplex 
is of little value without the seed.
Viola elatior, Potentilla opaca, 
Corisperraum nitidum.
Euphorbia palustris, Naias minor, Cyperus 
flavescens, Poa fertilis, are among the plants enumerated.
A more 
interesting place is the Turken Schanze, where the Turks are said to 
have pitched their camp, in the memorable siege of Vienna, in 1688.
One does not see why they should have tossed the ground about in 
such an irregular manner.
We enjoy from this place a very fine view 
of Vienna.
The soil is sandy.
I found here, Hieracium echioides, 
Linaria genistifolia, Stipa pennata, Scabiosa suaveolens.
Campanula 
sibirica (out of flower), Euphrasia lutea (not yet in flower).
This 
forms a very small portion of the riches of this locality.
40 
Here are said to grow â€” 
Anemone pratensis Potenlilla cinerea 
Alyssum minimum 
Gypsophila paniculala 
Linum hirsutum 
Cytisus biflorus 
Prunus chameecerasus 
Potentilla Giintheri 
Helichrysum arenarium 
Seiiatula mollis 
Scorzonera austriaca 
Hieiacium bifurcum 
Orobauclie cserulescens 
Salvia austriaca 
Tliesium ramosum 
T. divaricatum 
Gagea pusilla 
Carex steuophylla 
C. schoenoides 
C. supina 
C. nitida 
Besides many other plants interesting to a western botanist.
1 did not botanize on the north of the Danube.
On the south we 
may consider the neighbourhood of Vienna, as to its Botany, under 
four heads.
The first comprises the corn-fields and way-sides ; the 
glacis ; the Tiirken Schanze, and some other little bits of uncultivated 
land separated from the river; and within a mile or two of the 
suburbs.
Here, besides the plants already enumerated on the Tiirken 
Schanze, and many of those on the Brigettenau, grow â€” 
Ceratocephalus falcatus 
C. orthoceras 
Arabis Gerardi 
Sisymbrium Loeselii 
Erysimum repandum 
E. virgatum 
Nasturtium austriacum 
N, anceps 
Syrenia angustifolia 
Farsetia incana 
Lepidium perfoliatum 
Euclidium syriacum 
Myagnim jierfoliatum 
Polygala coraosa 
Potentilla supina 
P. inclinata 
Linum austriacum 
Silene dichotoma 
S. viscosa 
Stellaria viscida 
Hibiscus Trionum 
Vicia: pannonica 
Trigonella Foenumgraecum 
Astragalus sulcatus 
Astragalus asper 
Caucalis intricata 
Saxifraga bulbifera 
Inula britannica 
Echinops sphoerocephalus 
Biyonia alba 
Parietaria erecta 
Gagea arvensis 
Euphorbia diffusa 
Scirpus radicans 
Bromus commutatus 
Lolium italicum 
Parietaria erecta is the only species noted as growing about 
Vienna.
The Lolium italicum is the L.
Boucheanum of the first 
edition of Koch's ' Synopsis,' and is beautifully distinguished from 
L. perenne, by the estivation of the leaves in the barren shoots.
These are simply folded in the latter species, and rolled in, in the 
former.
The number of the flowers, though generally forming a dis- 
tinctive mark, is not quite constant, but the spike seems to be always 
more lax, and the spiculas more spreading.
The second chapter of Vienna Botany, is that of the shores and 
islands of the Danube, including the Prater and the Brigittenau.
Here are to be added : â€” 
Galium pedemontanum 
Valeriana sambucifolia 
Artemisia scoparia 
Cirsium nemorale 
Myosotis sparsiflora 
Statice elongata 
Ornithogalum nutans 
Typha minima 
41 
Clematis integrifulia 
Thalicti'um Jacquinianum 
T. galioides 
Lepidium crassifolium 
Viola stagnina 
V. Ruppii 
Silene multi flora 
Cirsium canum 
SciUellaria haslifolia 
Gladiolus Boucheamis 
Iris spuria 
I. graminea 
Allium acutanguliira 
Scirpus radicans 
The third division is composed of the low lands, often somewhat 
boggy, extending towards the Neusiedler See. The most remarkable 
plants are : â€” 
Lavatera Iburingiaca 
Ononis hircina 
Astragalus austriacus 
Lythrum virgatum 
Bifora radians 
Cirsium Chailletti 
C. tataricum 
The fourth division consists of the range of limestone hills which 
extends from the Alps of Lower Austria quite to the neighbourhood 
of Vienna.
The northern extremity is within the reach of a walk from 
Vienna ; or the botanist may take advantage of one of the omnibuses 
which go to several villages in that direction, or to Nussdorf, the sta- 
tion of the steamers on the Danube.
The Kahlenberg and the Leo- 
poldsberg are the points most visited.
In another direction, the 
Glocknitz railway will carry him to Medling, a post from which he 
may conveniently visit some of the best stations among the hills, and 
extend his rambles over the low country which forms my third divi- 
sion.
The most interesting plants of this district, besides several of 
those already enumerated, are the following: â€” 
Anemone patens 
Adonis vernalis 
Helleborus dumetorum 
H. niger 
Eranthis hyemalis 
Isopyrum tlialictroides

Perhaps for some of them the botanist will find it expedient to stop 
a day or two also at Baden,

On the re-discovery of Raifs Habitat for Malaxis paludosa at 
Tonhridge Wells.
By John Sharp, Esq * 
Tonbridge Wells, September 10, 1844.
Dear Sir, 
It is with feelings of no ordinary kind that T commu- 
nicate to you the rediscovery of a plant supposed by many to be lost 
(if indeed it were ever found) in the neighbourhood of Tonbridge 
Wells.
Last August, as Mr. Woodward and myself rambled in the 
woods near Eridge rocks, till we came out of the grounds into a kind 
of gr?ssy bog.
Mr. Woodward, feeling fatigued by the excessive 
heat of the day, threw^ himself on a dry part, and remarked in a casual 
manner that Neottia spiralis grew there.
As I was botanizing but a 
few yards off, I ran to him, and seeing the plant, shouted with a voice 
of rapture that it was Malaxis paludosa !
To an ardent admiration of Nature 1 have always added a great re- 
spect for those original minds who first gave to her beauties a syste- 
matic form.
Foremost amongst these is Ray, a philosopher who lived 
at a period, certainly not of ignorance, yet still one in which the gross- 
est absurdities were sent forth by men who were called scientific, who 
built their theories in their closets to account for phenomena which 
they never witnessed, and drew inductions from data which existed 
only in their imaginations.
Although perhaps not wholly untouched 
by the speculative manner of the day, Ray became, in the pursuit of 
Natural History, a plain chronicler of facts, and faithfully recorded 
what he witnessed, and no more; thus rendering to science a far more 
important service than all those dreamers whose works now slumber 
in peace on the shelves of the curious.
Thoughts such as these, in- 
describable but full of pleasure, caused my exultation.
There was a 
plant before me, which an old and valued botanist had described as 
growing in this forest, â€” had probably found in this very spot, â€” more 
than a century and a half before, a plant long anxiously though fruit- 
lessly sought after, and which Forster inserts in his ' Flora Tonbri- 
* Addressed to and commuuicated by Edward Jenner, Esq. of Lewes.
43 
gensis' solely on the authority of Ray, having himself sought for it 
in vain.
I cannot conclude my letter without adverting to a subject we have 
frequently discussed, â€” the shameful practice of destroying habitats.
The specimens of Malaxis paludosa were not plentiful, the summer 
being very dry; I question whether they have ever been abundant: 
yet the plant has withstood the changes of a hundred and sixty or 
seventy seasons, a living witness of its great discoverer.
It is painful 
to think that a time may come when rude hands may pluck it, exult- 
ing in the deed of gathering the last of Ray's plant.
This is no ex- 
aggeration ; a wretched doctrine is in force, that plants are better in 
the collections of the scientific, than left to perish on bogs and wastes.
I remain, Dear Sir, 
Yours, &c.
John Sharp.
Notes on some British Specimens, distributed hy the Botanical 
Society of London, in 1844-5.
By Hewett C.
Watson, Esq., 
F.L.S.
Insertion of the following explanatory notes, in reference to vari- 
ous specimens of British plants, distributed by the Botanical Society 
of London, is requested in the ' Phytologist.' As recorded facts, in- 
dependently of the specimens, they will not be without interest or 
usefulness to botanists who are not members of the Society ; besides 
giving to the members those explanations which could not be con- 
veyed by the labels alone.
The Society has of late adopted the practice of including additional 
specimens in the parcels sent out to members, although not expressly 
asked for in lists of desiderata.
This has been done in the case of 
newly discovered species or varieties, the names of which could not 
appear in Catalogues previously printed ; as also in other instances, 
for the correction of errors, or for illustrating any change from the 
normal character of si^ecies.
The Botanical Society of Edinburgh 
.has just announced an intention of adopting one important feature 
from the London Society (although without the candour of acknow- 
ledging whence it has been copied) ; and it would be well for the 
rulers of that Society to take a second leaf out of the London volume, 
by adopting the practice here alluded to also.
The London Catalogue brings down the list of British plants to the 
44 
commencement of 1844 ; so that members can now apply for anything 
recorded as British up to that time, and there can be few actual no- 
velties for the distribution of this winter.
The species discovered in 
the summer of 1844, appear to have been collected very sparingly ; 
and although specimens have been kindly presented to the herbarium 
of the Society, by Mr. Gibson, Mr. Tatham, Dr. Dewar, and other 
active botanists, they could not be supplied in quantity, as duplicates 
for general distribution.
Hence, it will be seen, the additional spe- 
cimens of this year are sent rather to illustrate variations of character, 
and clear away doubts or errors in nomenclature, than under the more 
attractive, though scarcely more important, claims of novelty.
1. ffinanthe Lachenalii [Grnel.), pimpinelloides [Linn.) and peu- 
cedanifolia {Smith).
Ample explanations of these plants have been 
already communicated to the pages of the 'Phytologist,' (Phyt.
ii.
11).
Through the kiudness of the Rev. A.
Bloxam, Mr. G.
S. Gibson and 
Mr. Fitt, an abundant supply of the first species was obtained.
Of 
the other two species, the specimens are few, without mature fruit, 
and the roots of several are broken short or quite absent.
Small 
packets of the fruits of CE> pimpinelloides, taken from a garden plant, 
were added, in order to show its cylindrical form, without contraction 
at the base or summit ; but these having been ripe, even to complete 
desiccation, when gathered, the callosity of the base is scarcely per- 
ceptible.
While alluding to these plants, I may mention a further 
character for distinction between two of them.
In QE.
Lachenalii the 
mucro of the leaflets is short and straight; while in CE.
pimpinelloi- 
des it is longer, more acute, and somewhat curved or hooked.
2. Bromus coramutatus [Schrad.), var.
puhens.
This is simply a 
pubescent state of the species (Phytol.
i. 1002), and maybe expected 
to occur in any part of England.
There has been, and still is, so 
much confusion about this species, that a wide distribution of authen- 
tic specimens is desirable.
By Smith, it was confounded one while 
with B.
arvensis, one while with the non-pubescent state of B.
mollis, 
which is the variety " racemosus " of the liondon Catalogue.
By the 
Edinburgh botanists, and some English ones, it has usually been la- 
belled "B.
arvensis;" but by the greater number of English botanists, 
perhaps, it is labelled " B.
racemosus." Thus, no reliance can be 
placed upon any localities recorded for plants under either of these 
two latter names : usually we may expect to find B.
commutatus.
3. Primula elatior, [Jacq.).
Many specimens of this species were 
distributed in 1848 and 1844; and it was acccordingly omitted from 
parcels made up shortly before Christmas, 18i4.
But a renewed dis- 
45 
tribution becomes desirable, as it appears that the Edinburgh Society- 
are still (December, 1844) sending out the caulescent variety of Pri- 
mula vulgaris, labelled as "P, elatior." It is but justice to the pre- 
sent Curator of that Society, however, to add, that the same and many 
other misnomers which occur in my parcel from Edinburgh, this win- 
ter, are on labels which bear the dates of preceding years : â€” but why 
still sent out uncorrected ?
Formerly, the Edinburgh Society's labels 
were much more accurate than those of the London Society : now, 
the balance seems quite reversed ; though I fear this improvement will 
be only temporary in London, as it depends wholly on a single indi- 
vidual, who may not continue an active member much longer.
4. Helianthemum Breweri, {Planch.) This is the Holyhead plant, 
which has been so long confused with H.
guttatum.
But while it ap- 
pears to be truly distinct from the latter, there seems a geographical 
improbability of a species being exclusively peculiar to a small part 
of Anglesea.
(Phytol.
ii.
23).
5. Lastrtea spinosa, [Newm.) Usually passed over as a form of L.
dilatata, (L.
multiflora, Newm.) The specimens may be deemed au- 
thentic ; two of them having been seen and named by Mr. Newman, 
before the rest were labelled.
6. Scleranthus perennis, [Linn.) This is distributed on the chance 
that some of the specimens may assist in correcting the very frequent 
error of labelling specimens of S.
annuus, which are collected in win- 
ter or spring, with the name of the present species.
About nine or 
ten of the specimens sent to me under the name of S.
perennis, belong 
really to S.
annuus.
7. Linaria spartea, {Hoffmsg.) Distributed last year, but not being 
in the London Catalogue, specimens may still be sent out while they 
last.
In the past autumn (1844) there were many plants in the loca- 
lity at Walton-station, to which it has doubtless been introduced by 
some chance.
I am not able to say with confidence, whether this 
name, or that of L.
juncea [DeC.) should be given to the specimens; 
but it is certainly the plant common in gardens, under the name of 
Antirrhinum sparteum.
8. Polygonum maritimum, [Linn.) Garden specimens, raised from 
foreign seeds, as shown on the labels.
The inducement to send them 
in the parcels, is, that they are so intermediate between P.
maritimum 
and P.
Raii {Bab.), as to throw much doubt on the specific distinct- 
ness of these two species.
It is worthy of note, that these garden 
specimens were referred to P.
Raii b}' a well known Professor of Bo- 
tany, who has had good opportunities for studying the latter in its 
46 
native localities.
I believe that I should have done the same, if un- 
aware that it was the descendant of P.
maritimum, with which it 
agrees in its more nerved ochreaj ; while in general habit, that is, in 
in its long trailing branches and elongated internodes, it has a much 
stronger first-glance resemblance to P.
Raii.
Are a few more or less 
nerves in the ochreae sufficient specific distinctions between plants 
which are otherwise scarcely if at all distinguishable ?
When I can 
procui'e ripe seeds of P.
Raii, I will try how near that (species ?) can 
be brought to P.
maritimum.
9. Melampyrum sylvaticum, [Linn.) Compact bushy specimens, 
with broader leaves than usual ; possibly the consequence of growing 
in drier ground.
At first sight, I fancied that I had discovered a new 
species.
10.
Festuca loliacea {Huds.), pratensis {Hitds.), and arundinacea 
{Schreh.) These are all garden specimens, though the roots were ori- 
ginally wild.
They are the two species and one variety [loliacea) 
intended under these names in the London Catalogue.
I believe it 
would have been proper to have added also F.
elatior [Linn.) to these 
three ; and, for the present, to have placed " arundinacea" as a vari- 
ety of F.
elatior.
By observation of the wild plants and their culti- 
vation in the garden, I am fully persuaded of pratensis and loliacea 
being forms of one species: it will be seen, that the specimens of the 
latter show an evident state of transition from the racemed to the pa- 
nicled inflorescence, and there is scarcely any other distinction be- 
tween them.
The large, reed-like, very harsh arundinacea, would 
seem perfectly distinct from pratensis, were there not the F.
elatior to 
come between them.
By growing it in a small flower-pot, sparingly 
supplied with water, I have reduced the panicle of arundinacea to a 
very dwarf condition, but the branches still spread out quite unlike 
those of pratensis after the flowering stage.
11.
Avena alpina, [Smith).
These also are garden specimens, al- 
though their root was brought from rocks by a waterfall above the 
Pass of Drumochter, in Perthshire.
They seem to my eyes about the 
best representatives of Smith's Avena alpina which I have met with.
On this account the root was brought home, and on this account its 
garden-grown flower-stems are now distributed.
The plants of York- 
shire (reported as Avena alpina) appear rather intermediate links to 
connect it with A.
pratensis ; and the same also is the case with spe- 
cimens of the latter, distributed by the London Society as the nearest 
approach (in wild specimens) to A.
alpina ; but which are labelled as 
" pratensis passing into alpina." 
47 
12.
Hieracium Lawsoni, (Smitlt).
Distributed to show the increas- 
ed number of flowers on plants growing free from the suffocation of 
other species, but not in rich soil, in a garden.
The wild plants have 
commonly from two to five flowers; the garden plants ten to fifty.
Some correspondents of the ' Phytologist ' have appeared to attach 
high importance to the number of flowers, and small differences in the 
form of inflorescence, among the Hieracia.
They are, however, ex- 
tremely variable in both respects.
The specific name of H.
umbel- 
latum expresses its usual inflorescence, of some five to twenty flowers; 
but I have seen this converted into a panicle, with upwards of a hun- 
dred flowers, on wild specimens.
Smith's H.
sabaudum is by no 
means rare with only a dozen, half-a-dozen, or even fewer flowers ; 
yet I have counted very near one thousand on the same stem, or, ex- 
cluding four strong branches near the base, five hundred and ninety 
six.
This large specimen was growing on the south-eastern slope of 
a railway-embankment, made from chalk and sterile sand ; and in the 
dry summer of the present year, 1844.
Its luxuriance probably arose 
fiom the humidity of the preceding summer of 1843, favouring the 
production of a crown of many leaves, and the free space for its roots, 
in the railway mound but sparsely clothed with vegetation.
13.
Veronica officinalis, [Linn.) Few specimens in which the 
young capsules are scarcely emarginate, and in so far approach to the 
character of V.
hirsuta {Hopk.), while the leaves remain clearly those 
of V.
officinalis.
I have, however, seen much better examples, where 
the advanced capsule of V.
hirsuta was produced on luxuriant plants 
of V.
officinalis.
14.
Veronica humifusa, {Dicks.) Garden specimens approximating 
to V.
serpyllifolia.
In the wild state, V.
humifusa has usually a sim- 
ple, or little-branched, stem, of two or three inches in length.
A 
plant of it brought from the Highlands in 1841, grew vigorously in 
the two next years, but produced no flowers.
In 1844, a portion of 
the original plant covered a space of ground five or six feet in cir- 
cumference, and was so much branched as to produce hundreds of 
flowering racemes : it died during the long drought of that autumn.

]>^ote on Coleochate scutata.
By John Ralfs, Esq., A.L.S.
Amongst the numerous additions lately made to our microscopic 
Algae, there is no one more deserving of notice than the Coleochaete 
scutata, Breh.
This minute parasite appears like a mere speck upon 
the leaves of aquatic plants.
It was first discovered by my friend, 
Mr. Sidebothara, in a pond near Manchester ; and has since been ga- 
thered near Aberdeen, by Dr. Dickie, and in Sussex, by Mr. Jenner, 
on the decaying leaves of grasses.
It is also not imcommon near 
Penzance, but is here always found on the under surface of the leaves 
of Potamogeton natans.
This plant is probably common, but over- 
looked from its minuteness.
Coleochajte seems to approximate very closely to the Phylactidium 
of Kutzing, of which genus a species has been lately detected in Ire- 
land by Dr. Allman.
In both genera the frond is circular, and com- 
posed of series of cells radiating from a centre.
If these genera are 
not identical, the only distinction between them depends upon the 
fact that Coleochaete in an advanced state has processes from the dor- 
sum of the joints, each of which is terminated by a long bristle.

Notes on the species of (Enanthe.
By J.
S. Mill, Esq.
The readers of ' The Phytologist,' and all botanists, are much 
indebted to Mr. H.
C. Watson for his careful, and I believe accurate 
investigation, in the January number, of the three species of Qdinanthe, 
hitherto confounded under the names of peucidanifolia and pimpinel- 
loides (Phytol.
ii.
11).
I have long been convinced that there was 
some unknown quantity to be determined among the English species 
of this very interesting genus, which has until lately received very 
little critical investigation in this country.
It is not generally known 
that one of these three species grows abundantly in so familiar and 
much frequented a locality as Battersea fields.
I have observed it 
there for more than twenty years past, in a small patch of grass land, 
which is passed through in crossing the fields diagonally from Nine 
Elms, at an acute angle with the direction of the river.
Valeriana 
dioica and Polygonum Bistorta grow copiously near the spot.
I have 
never yet been able to procure the fruit, as the grass is always cut 
before the plant is out of flower.
But the leaves, the tubers, and the 
49 
bracteae, agree in their characters with Mr. Watson's QPj. Srailhii, and 
quite differ from those of CE.
Lachenalii.
The same plant, or one 
apparently the same, has been seen by me many years ago, as well as 
lately, in meadows adjoining the river Wey, near Weybridge.
Nei- 
ther of these stations appears to be known to Mr. Watson ; to whom I 
can also contribute an authentic station for his CE.
pimpinelloides, 
viz, a maritime bog at the little village of Bishopstone, near Scaford, 
in Sussex, where I gathered unquestionable specimens in July, 1827.
While I am on the subject of this genus, I should be glad if any 
of your correspondents could inform me whether they have ever found 
the CK.
crocata with the yellow acrid juice, which until lately has 
been attributed to it by all botanists.
I have examined numberless 
living specimens of the plant in Surrey, and other counties around 
London, for the express purpose, and have never, in any one single 
instance, discovered the smallest vestige of such a juice.
The asser- 
tion is a curious example of the servile manner in which even scien- 
tific observers copy each other's statements, without verifying them.

Observations on and Description of Calamintha sylvatica, a new 
British Plant.
By W.
A. Bromfield, M.D., F.L.S.
By this name I have judged it expedient, for reasons I shall pre- 
sently give, to designate the species lately detected by me in the Isle 
of Wight, and published in the 'Phytologist' for November, 1843, 
(Phytol.
768).
To that notice I wish to add a few remarks, and cor- 
rect an error or two which occur, or have rather been left standing, 
in the printed account.
When that account was first sent to this 
journal, I conceived our new plant to be the Calamintha grandiflora of 
Mcench (Melissa grandiflora, Linn.), but soon discovering my mistake, 
inserted it subsequently as the C.
officinalis, in all probability, of the 
continental botanists, amongst some of whom it certainly passes cur- 
rent under that name, though not with all, as we shall see hereafter.
But in the foot-note (Id. 769), this my original mistake remains un- 
corrected, and I am there made to call that Calamintha grandiflora, 
which, in the body of the communication, is styled C.
officinalis.
Moreover, the last seven lines of the same page should have been 
erased, as they relate to C.
grandiflora, and do not apply to our C.
sylvatica, which is a plant of the plains or of moderate elevations in 
Vol. ri.
h 
50 
several parts of France and Germany, whereas C.
grandiflora, as there 
stated, is a decidedly mountain species, differing considerably from 
the other in specific characters.
In my memoir just referred to, I have laid down the characters of 
C. sylvatica as distinguishing it from our more common British spe- 
cies, C.
officinalis and C.
Nepeta, and which characters I now repeat, 
as some of your readers may not possess the first volume of the ' Phy- 
tologist.' Those of C.
officinalis are likewise added, for the sake of 
comparison.
Calamintha sylvatica.
Root rather slender, much branched and 
fibrous, sending out one or more underground runners or stolons.
Stem taller than in the next, erect or ascending, lax and slender, with 
few, long, distant, mostly simple and nearly erect branches.
Leaves 
large, 2 â€” 3 inches long, dull green but not hoary, truly ovate, acute 
and sharply serrated, slightly attenuated at base, a few of the lower- 
most bluntish, with distant shallow serratures : when rubbed, the 
leaves emit a strong and pure odour of peppermint.
Cymes (verticil- 
lasters) many-flowered, the lower ones on very long peduncles, which 
are mostly curved upwards.
Calyx coloured (purplish), the upper 
teeth erect or recurved, and rather longer and more slender than in 
C. officinalis.
Corolla large, nearly an inch long, pale lilac or peach- 
blossom, variously spotted on the lip and throat wdth white and crim- 
son, its lower lip in three rounded shallow segments, of which the 
middle one is scarcely larger than the two lateral, and so broad as 
partly to cover the latter or be covered by them, concealing the sinus 
that separates the three divisions, which thus appear united, as they 
do in the wild basil (Clinopodium vulgare, Linn.).
Nuts as in the fol- 
lowing, but rather larger.
Calamintha officinalis.
Root stout, woody, branched and fibrous, 
but without runners.
Stems erect or ascending, much branched and 
bushy, the branches patent or spreading, usually simple.
Leaves 
small, an inch long at most, of a greyish or hoary green, and with a 
bitterish aromatic odour, but not that of peppermint, and far less 
agreeable than in the last ; ovato-deltoid or somewhat rhomboidal, 
occasionally nearly orbicular, broader than long, at least all the lower 
and larger, which approach somewhat in shape to the leaves of the 
Lombardy poplar ; rounded or subtruncate and entire at the base, be- 
yond that distantly and shallowly crenate- serrate, often so faintly as 
to appear as if quite entire throughout ; more or less evidently point- 
61 
ed, but without the least tapering or acumination ; at other times 
rounded at the apex or obtuse.
Cymes many-flowered, the lower on 
much shorter stalks than in the other.
Calyx similar, but scarcely 
coloured, the upper teeth simply porrected or ascending, not, as in 
the last, at all recurved, or even upright.
Corolla scarcely half the 
size of the other's, and paler, with a few spots or blotches of dark red 
on the lower lip, the segments of which are very unequal and distinct, 
the middle one greatly exceeding the two lateral in length, cordate 
and subemarginate, its apical lobes, from their projecting so far be- 
yond the lateral segments, not overlapped by or overlapping these 
last, nor concealing the deep cleft between them.
Nuts minute, pale 
brown, roundish ovoid, thickly dotted with depressed points.
I have only to add, that our new plant is, as it were, a transition 
species between C.
officinalis and C.
Clinopodium (Clinopodium vul- 
gare, Linn.), uniting the lax cymose inflorescence of the former with 
the general habit and structure of corolla of the latter.
The root, al- 
so, is like that of the last, slender and creeping, not as in C.
officina- 
lis, stout and simply branched, or without runners, a most valuable 
distinction, first pointed out by my friend Dr. T.
B. Salter, of this 
town.
In the large, truly ovate and acutely serrated leaves, great size 
of the blossoms, which appear to have a similarly constructed corolla, 
and in the grateful, purely peppermint odour of the herbage, our Isle 
of Wight plant makes an approach to C grandiflora, for which, as I 
have before said, it was at first mistaken by myself.
That species is, 
however, truly distinct in its more coarsely and deeply serrated leaves, 
veiy few-flowered verticillasters, still larger blossoms, and notably by 
the very much larger, most conspicuous calyx.
The specimen of Melissa Calamintha in the Linnaean herbarium, 
which I have consulted expressly to determine, if possible, the syno- 
nyms of our British species, seems rather to be a fragment of M.
Ne- 
peta, diff"ering from another indubitable specimen of the latter, and 
equally authenticated by Linnaeus himself, chiefly in the relative 
length of the common flower- stalks ; almost the only character given 
by Linnaeus in the original edition of the 'Species Plantarum,' for dis- 
tinguishing the two : thus clearly showing an imperfect acquaintance 
with the living plants, neither of which is an inhabitant of Sweden.* 
* I confess myself to have always entertained considerable doubts of the specific 
difference of C.
oflBcinalis and C.
Nepeta, from inability to find any good pennanent 
characters, beyond a certain difference in size and habit between them ; an opinion in 
which I am supported by more than one of our leading botanists.
52 
From the foregoing statement it is evident that by his Melissa Ca- 
lamintha Linnaeus intended either the plant so understood by us in 
England, or the other of our two commoner British species, M.
Ne- 
peta (the Thymus Calamintha and T.
Nepeta of Smith) ; we think the 
former, from the circumstances just detailed.
Be that as it may, the 
Isle of Wight plant is assuredly neither the one nor the other, and 
therefore cannot be the Melissa Calamintha of Linnaeus, or be justly 
designated by any of its supposed synonymes.
If our two old Cala- 
miuts are kept distinct, the greater one may, without much risk of 
creating a misnomer, be considered as the Melissa Calamintha of Lin- 
naeus ; if, on the contrary, experience should demonstrate both to be 
but one species, that name may still be preserved to each variety, or 
be merged in that of the lesser, or M.
Nepeta.
I have ascertained most satisfactorily, from descriptions, plates and 
specimens, that our island plant is the Melissa Calamintha of Ben- 
tham,* Reichenbach, Hoppe, and other distinguished botanists, and 
not less convincingly that the genuine Linnaean species of that name 
is by others as well known and recognised abroad as it universally has 
been in this country, though the nomenclature and synonymes of all 
the three are often strangely confused and misunderstood, for want of 
clear specific characters to each.
Now it being manifestly inadmis- 
sible for two species to retain the same name, I have ventured to be- 
stow a new appellation on the subject of these remarks, and have 
accordingly called it sylvatica, from its place of growth, so different 
from the open sunny situations which the other British species affect, 
but in which this languishes.
So much, indeed, does our plant love 
shelter, that its beauty is best displayed by growing it in pots, and 
keeping it in the greenhouse, where it will amply repaj-^ the trouble of 
the cultivator, in the long raceme-like aggregate of cymose clusters, 
with their large unilateral blossoms of a delicate rose-colour, elegantly 
spotted, and of transparent brilliancy.
It is easily propagated by 
cuttings, which strike readily.

Cnicus oleraceus a British Species.
By W.
A. Bromfield, M.D.
A SPECIMEN of this plant is in the herbarium of Mrs. M.
Stovin, of 
Ashgate, near Chesterfield, gathered by herself in 1816, from a root 
found by Mr. Oldham, nurseryman, at Sheffield, apparently wild, in 
Lincolnshire, and by him transferred from its native locality to his 
garden in Yorkshire.
The specimen I saw when on a visit to that la- 
dy in November last, and from her received the above particulars.
As this species is very widely distributed over the continent of Eu- 
rope, it may be reasonably expected to occur in our own country, and 
the above notice will, we hope, serve as an encouragement to look out 
for it in that part of England.
We are not aware that Cnicus olera- 
ceus is ever cultivated, either for use or ornament, so that it may fairly 
be presumed to have been wild in the place where it was discovered.

Discovery of Bryum roseum in fruit, at Lydford, Devon.
By the Rev. W.
S. Hore, M.A., F.L.S.
The Rev. C.
A. Johns and myself were fortunate enough to find 
this beautiful species of Bryum in fructification about six years since, 
in the woods surrounding the waterfall at Lydford.
At that time we 
were accompanied by some friends, who were not botanists, which 
prevented us from making so thorough a search as we could have 
wished, and were therefore reluctantly compelled to quit the romantic 
valley of the Lyd with only six specimens bearing capsules.
As the 
moss itself, in a barren state, was abundant, we determined on renew- 
ing our search at some future opportunity, in hopes of being enabled 
to enrich the herbaria of our muscological correspondents with speci- 
mens of the plant.
This opportunity, however, did not present itself 
till the present month, when a visit to Plymouth by Mr. Johns ena- 
bled us to carry our good intentions iuto efiect.
The long drought 
of the past summer held out hopes that we should be successful, as, 
from the want of moisture, we anticipated that this moss, like other 
plants having a tendency to increase by their roots in wet seasons, 
would be thrown into a capsuliferous state.
Whether we judged cor- 
rectly or not, I will not say, but we managed, after a close search of 
between three and four hours, to collect about eighty specimens.
Of 
these, one was provided with four setae ; two with three ; one with 
three, two of which were united till within three lines of the summit, 
54 
and presented the appearance of a single seta up to the point of se- 
paration, furnished with two capsules ; about twenty with two setae, 
and the remainder with one only.
The moss in a barren state ap- 
peared to be more abundant than when we first met with it ; but this 
may perhaps have arisen from the more minute search which we made.
It extended far up into the steep woods, flourishing in the greatest 
luxuriance where the ground was kept in a constant state of moisture 
by springs or small streams of water from the higher parts.
In these 
places, however, we did not discover any plants in fruit, although we 
carefully examined them.
Our harvest was gathered on, compara- 
tively speaking, dry ground, â€” on the land near the river, or, I should 
rather say, mountain torrent.
Here the bright red colour of the setae 
enabled us to detect the object of our search, growing in the midst of 
tufts of Hyi^na and other mosses, chiefly around the roots of trees.
Few solitary plants in the desired state were met with ; where we 
discovered one, we always calculated on finding some half dozen 
within a distance of one or two feet : in one instance we collected up- 
wards of twenty in a spot of the above limited size.
Any muscologist visiting this part of Devonshire in December^ 
would be amply rewarded by a day's stroll in Lydford woods, which 
are as beautiful as any in the county.
He would derive gratification 
not only from a vasculum well filled with mosses (Bryum roseum, to 
wit), but from the wild scenery surrounding the rapid Lyd in its course 
to the Tamar.
Either the Rev. C.
A Johns, Grammar School, Helston, or myself, 
will be happy to supply any muscologist, to whom this moss in fruit 
may be a desideratum, with a specimen, as long as our stock of du- 
plicates enables us to do so.

JVistmati's Wood and Anomodon curtipendulum.
By the Rev. C.
A. Johns, M.A., F.L.S., &c.
Wistman's Wood is situated on Dartmoor, about a mile above 
Two Bridges, on the left bank of the river.
Imagine a mountain 
stream, creeping slowly among blocks of moss-stained granite ; on 
either side extends a piece of flat boggy ground, to an inconsiderable 
instance ; and at the extremity of these the hills rise to the height of 
Â¥ 
55 
two or three hundred feet, capped here and there in the distance with 
tors, or rugged summits of granite.
The hill-side is confusedly heap- 
ed with blocks of the same stone ; and it is in the interstices between 
these, that the trees composing Wistman's Wood have chosen to fix 
their habitations â€” a colony of patriarchs in a wilderness.
The wood 
itself forms a ragged and interrupted belt, of about half a mile in 
length, including some straggling trees, separated at long intervals.
The best way of approaching it is from above, for by so doing one 
may, without difficulty, obtain a pretty good view of nearly the whole 
at once, and plunge in among the trees at pleasure.
The trees are all 
oaks {Quercus pedunculata), from ten to fourteen feet high, gnarled, 
knotted and twisted even beyond the usual characteristic of that tree.
The trunks vary from two to five feet in circumference.
One which 
was measured consisted of three trunks, branched just above the base, 
each bole being about three feet in circumference.
But by far the 
strangest peculiarity is, that all the branches, with the exception (and 
this not always) of the extreme spires, are matted with deep beds of 
moss, principally Anomodon curtipendulum in fine fructification.
Some idea of the denseness of this extraordinary integument may be 
formed from the fact, that the moss is, in most cases, fi'om ten to 
twelve inches in thickness, when the diameter of the branch does not 
exceed an inch and a half.
It seems very probable that the superin- 
cumbent weight may operate in producing the depressed character of 
growth : certain it is that a single holly-tree, near the centre of the 
wood, which is free from parasites, has attained the height of twenty 
feet, and towers above his pigmy companions, like some tall pine in a 
wood of ordinary gi'owth.
When first we saw this tree, indeed, hav- 
ing nothing to compare it with of definite size and shape, but the sur- 
rounding oaks, we fancied that it was a fir-tree, and the oaks borrow- 
ed from it, by comparison, a dignity not their own.
On a rough 
guess there are from 300 to 500 veteran trees in the wood, and as we 
were very glad to find, a great number of saplings.

No. 94 contains a continuation of Mr. Ralfs' paper on the British 
Desmidese, describing the genera Xanthidium and Pediastrum, toge- 
56 
ther with three species of the former and four of the latter.
These 
minute beings are found in bogs and boggy pools.
Almost contem- 
poraneous with Mr. Ralfs' observations are those of Mr. White, who, 
in the ' Transactions of the Microscopical Society,' has described and 
figured as animals, certain fossilized spores of these obscure plants.
On Helianthemum guttatum, noticed in our last number, the editor 
gives the following note.
" I possess a specimen of the true H.
gut- 
tatum, gathered by Miss H.
Townsend, at Three-castle Head, near 
Crookhaven, in the county of Cork, one of the extreme south-western 
points of Ireland, and thus restore it to its place in the British Flora, 
of which it has only just been deprived.
The Anglesea plant called 
H. Breweri by Dr. Planchon, has bracteated pedicels and obovate 
lower leaves, but H.
guttatum has no bracts and oblong lanceolate 
leaves.
It is singular that all our botanists should have overlooked 
these very obvious distinctions, but probably the extreme rarity of the 
plants, and the small and usually imperfect state of the specimens 
from Anglesea, may somewhat account for it.

Proceedings of Societies.
BOTANICAL SOCIETY OF EDINBURGH.
December 12, 1844.
â€” The Society this day held its first meeting 
for the session ; Dr. Seller in the chair.
Numerous donations to the library and museum were announced, 
particularly from Dr. Eraser, Algoa Bay, eleven volumes of botanical 
57 
works, and specimens of Cape woods and plants.
From the Rev. J.
E. Leefe, the second fasciculus of his ' Salictum Britannicum Exsic- 
catum.' From Dr. Dcwar, Dunfermline, plants from the river Congo, 
&c.
From Mr. Charles Lawson, jun., plants from the Rocky Moun- 
tains, &c.
The following communications were read : â€” 
1. Notice of the discovery of Alsine stricta, in Teesdale, by Messrs.
G. S.
Gibson, and J.
Tatham, jun.
Specimens of this interesting 
addition to the Flora of Great Britain, kindly communicated by the 
above named gentlemen, were exhibited.
2. On the genus Spirulina, by Mr. Ralfs, Penzance.
One species 
only, the S.
tenuissima of Kutzing, was described.
3. Notice of the discovery of Cirsiura setosum, Bieh., near Culross, 
by Dr. Dewar.
This plant, which is also new to Britain, was disco- 
vered in July last, by Dr. Dewar, Dunfermline, growing on the coast 
of the Frith of Forth, near Culross ; and through the kindness of that 
gentleman, numerous specimens were supplied to the Society.
It is 
a native of Odessa, and has probably been introduced from thence 
among agricultural seeds or ballast.
4. Journal of a Tour through j^art of the United States and the Ca- 
nadas (continued), by Mr. James M'Nab.
In the last part of this paper read before the Society, Mr. M'Nab 
gave an account of the botanical features of the country in the neigh- 
bourhood of Stillwater, and concluded with an examination of the 
woodland grounds in the vicinity of Whitehall ; the present portion 
embraces the journey from the latter place to Montreal.
" Entering another steam-boat at the southern extremity of Lake 
Champlain, the course is winding and narrow, having considerable 
tracts of level ground extended on each side.
The woods for the first 
sixteen miles are very various, the principal trees being the wild cher- 
ry [Primus Virffiniana), elms, walnuts, sugar-maple, with the aspen 
poplar {Populus tremuloides).
The rocky grounds overhanging the 
lake were densely clothed with the Arbor-vitae.
After having fairly 
entered upon the expanse of the lake, the appearance of the lofty 
white or Weymouth pines (Pinus strobus), towering above the deci- 
duous trees, along the rising grounds at the base of the hills, was re- 
markable; most of them being destitute of branches, which gave them 
more the appearance of palms than pines.
About Essex, half way 
along, the lake widens, and all at once the wooded rocky land by the 
water's edge is changed for a rich champaign.
The fields of the dif-

ferent farms being laid off in squares, and each farmstead having a 
large orchard attached to it, render this tract with its natural beauties 
very interesting.
The soil seemed a light-coloured clay, and the wood 
on the lower grounds was not very plentiful ; but the rising grounds 
behind were closely studded with scraggy pines.
" Approaching the northern extremity, the lake begins to contract; 
by this time we had entered upon the lower Canadian territories.
The 
country here presented a totally ditferent appearance, owing to the 
dense dark masses of pines, elms and spruces, which covered a vast 
extent of the country, and having every here and there along the edge 
of the lake, rustic but picturesque log houses, inhabited by French 
Canadians, employed in felling the timber, dressing and carrying it 
to the lake, for the purpose of being floated down to the harbour at 
Lapraire, on the St. Lawrence river, for exportation.
On reaching 
St. John's, the northern extremity of Lake Champlain, the forests pre- 
sented the same appearance as they did when we first entered upon 
the lake, with the addition of the balm of Gilead fir {Abies halsami- 
fera) ; numbers of this tree were seen covering the drier grounds, the 
largest observed did not exceed thirty feet in height and four feet in 
circumference.
On the dry surface of these woods, the spice-root 
{Daliharda repens) formed exceedingly beautifiil tufts, resembling, in 
its ground-clothing propensity, the Epigaea repens, as seen in the 
New Jersey forests.
The sugar-maple [Acer saccharinum) is here 
in greater quantities, and attains a larger size, than hitherto noticed ; 
and notwithstanding the great mutilation to which it is yearly sub- 
jected, in spring, for the sap, which is here extensively used in the 
manufacture of sugar, it appears in the most perfect state of health.
" At St. John's, in the swampy grounds and in the shallow water 
by the edge of the lake, we picked luxuriant flowering specimens of 
the sweet flag [Acorus Calamus), Iris versicolor and Utricularia vul- 
garis.
On the drier grounds, Eupatorium verticillatum was the chief 
plant in flower, and covered a great extent.
" Passing onwards to Lapraire, the only tree observed of any inte- 
rest and deserving of notice, was the canoe-birch [Beiula papyracea).
Several compact masses of these trees, evidently of second growth, 
occupied the lower grounds ; but from their closeness none had at- 
tained a gi'eat size.
Large trees, however, must exist in the neigh- 
bourhood, though we did not fall in with them, as many of the canoes 
in this district were made fi'om the bark of this tree.
The greater 
number, however, were scooped out of the trunks of the fir-tribe.
59 
" On crossing the St. Lawrence to Montreal, we were much sur- 
prised to see the great difference which the Canadian winter produces 
upon the species of ornamental trees which grace the lawns and cities 
of the United States.
As examples may be mentioned the Ailantus 
glandulosa, the trees here being quite small and stunted ; the Osage 
orange [Madura aurantiaca) seemed barely alive ; mulberries were 
small and unhealthy ; weeping willows were almost always killed in 
winter, although in the neighbourhood of New York the stem of this 
tree is seen averaging from eight to fifteen, and sometimes twenty feet 
in circumference.
None of the Catalpa trees and Magnolias, which 
prove so ornamental in the pleasure-grounds both of New York and 
Philadelphia, can be made to thrive, with the exception of Magnolia 
glauca ; and they are in a very unhealthy condition.
The deciduous 
cypress [Ciipressus disticha) is also much dwarfed.
Evergreens, with 
the exception of the fir tribe, were rarely to be seen, unless ]3rotected 
by glass.
On visiting the gardens and nurseries in the neighbour- 
hood, we were much gratified at finding them so well managed, and 
chiefly under the superintendance of Scotch gardeners.
On the gar- 
den walls we observed healthy trees of peaches, apricots and nectar- 
ines, having well ripened wood, and every appearance of affording 
plentiful crops.
Gooseberries and currants were in great abundance, 
with high-flavoured fruit, which is seldom to be met with in the gar- 
dens of the United States ; apples were plentiful, but pears rather 
scarce.
Vines trained on espaliers had a promising appearance.
" In the nursery grounds the fruit and flower departments seem to 
receive the most attention.
Few, however, of the indigenous plants 
are cultivated, although considerable quantities of the genera Cypri- 
pedium, Trillium, Orchis, Habenaria, Goodyera, Calypso, Pagonia 
and Sarracenia, procured from their native habitats when in flower, 
lay stored in boxes for sale and barter with the British merchants.
"We next proceeded to the Montreal mountain, situated to the 
north-west of the town.
A number of fine specimens of the sugar- 
maple were seen, with a great mixture of other shrubbery plants.
The 
lime-trees [Tilia Americana)^ had a singular and beautiful effect, from 
the large size of their foliage â€” some of the leaves measured thirteen 
inches long and eleven broad.* Very few herbaceous plants were 
got in a fresh state, owing to the penetrating rays of the sun having 
scorched everything.
In very shady places, chiefly on the north and 
east side of the mountain, we procured a few good specimens in flower 
* A specimen of a leaf of tlie size here described was exhibited to the meeting.
60 
of Orchis macrophylla, Corallorhiza multiflora, Aralia hispida and ra- 
mosa, Aster acuminata, and Aspidium bulbiferum, which, with the 
Cyperus retrofractus from the most exposed places, formed the most 
interesting part of our collections this day.
After some difficulty we 
reached the summit, and the view as seen around was truly grand.
Here we beheld the St. Lawrence winding its way through a vast ex- 
tent of level country, while in various parts extensive wooded islands 
were seen obstructing its course.
On descending the south side of 
the mountain, which is closely wooded, the thermometer indicated 
80Â° of Fahrenheit.
The exertion caused by ascending and descend- 
ing was overpowering ; and owing to the parched state of the ground, 
and the flaccid vegetables with which it was covered, walking was 
rendered nearly as difficult as over sea-weeds on a rocky shore." 
At this meeting the election of office-bearers for the ensuing year 
took place ; when Dr. Douglas MacLagan was chosen President, and 
Professor Graham, Drs. Lowe, Greville and Seller, Vice-presidents.

Dr. Douglas Maclagan, President, in 
the chair.
The following communications were read : â€” 
L Notice regarding a plant from Ichaboe, supposed to yield Afri- 
can Olibanum, by Dr. D.
Maclagan.
The plant in question had been picked on the coast of Africa, close 
to the Island of Ichaboe.
Nothing was known regarding its botani- 
cal characters, as it was destitute both of foliage and inflorescence : 
its habit, however, was very peculiar.
A short stem, about four inch- 
es long and two thick, terminated above in a round knob, from which 
the principal branches arose, and each of these was ended by a simi- 
lar knob, from which the short, thick, and abrupt branches sprang in 
an irregularly trichotomous manner.
Microscopic examination of 
the wood did not elucidate its history.
On making a section of a 
branch, a soft resinous matter exuded, which by exposure dried up 
and became brittle.
Dr. M.
had succeeded in collecting some of this, 
and found, that like African Olibanum, it consisted of resin, volatile 
oil, and a peculiar matter analogous to, but not identical with, gum ; 
and it was quite possible that this might be the plant yielding the 
African Olibanum, which drug had never yet been traced authenti- 
cally to its source- Dr. Maclagan was confirmed in this belief, by 
finding on a specimen of African Olibanum in his museum, pieces of 
the bark of a tree, exactly agreeing in physical characters with the 
bark of the plant now before the Society.
Dr. Maclagan's object in 
making this communication, was to direct attention to the subject, in 
61 
the hope that some of the many persons now visiting Ichaboe, would 
bring home specimens of the plant, and of the resinous matter, in or- 
der that this question might be properly investigated.
2. On the genus Coleochsete, by Mr. John Ralfs, Penzance.
3. Journal of a Tour through part of the United States and the 
Canadas (continued), by Mr. James M'Nab.
" The extract read before the Botanical Society on the 7th of De- 
cember last, from my American notes, chiefly related to the botanical 
aspect of the country observed from Whitehall, through Lake Cham- 
plain to Montreal ; the present portion embraces the journey from 
Montreal to Kingston.
" Leaving Montreal for the upper province, the traveller experien- 
ces very great delight from the interesting chain of conveyance caused 
by the various rapids and cascades which every here and there pre- 
vent the possibility of a continuous steam-boat communication.
The 
first nine miles to La Chine was by coach, the road running close by 
the bank of the St. Lawrence ; along this district farming appeared to 
be carried on with much spirit, women as well as njen being employ- 
ed in the fields.
In many localities we observed extensive and pro- 
ductive apple-orchards, chiefly of the rennet description.
Several 
varieties of ornamental trees were seen gracing the neighbourhood of 
dwellings ; of these the Lombardy poplar and golden willow formed 
the chief exotics.
The most abundant weeds seen in flower along 
this line of road were succory [Cichorium Intybus), elecampane {Inu- 
la Helenium), mugwort {Artemisia vulgaris), and the gigantic mullein 
{Verhascum Thapsus).
"From La Chine we proceeded to the town of Cascades by steam- 
boat.
The distant lands seen on both sides of the river, appeared 
dark with uninterrupted pine-forests, forming a striking contrast with 
those lively and beautiful residences which every here and there oc- 
cur by the edge of the water.
The river is here somewhat extended, 
assuming the appearance of a lake, and is much intersected with 
islands of various dimensions, also dark with coniferous vegetation.
" At Cascades, coaches were in readiness to convey the passengers 
to Coteau de Lac. This is a very interesting part of the country; the 
varied and picturesque scenery afforded by the river, which every now 
and then met our view, when launching from the various thickets 
through which our course lay.
During the latter part of this line the 
road and adjoining ground was chiefly of deep loose sand, entirely 
destitute of vegetation.
" From Coteau de Lac we visited most of the towns of interest on 
62 
the St. Lawrence ; and although much gratification was experienced 
during its whole course, it was not till reaching Brockville that we 
really felt our presence in a foreign land.
Here the river is extended 
to a lake, and much interspersed with islands ; this portion has there- 
fore been admirably designated the ' Lake of a Thousand Islands.' 
These islands are of sizes varying from a few yards square to many acres 
in extent, mostly wooded and rocky, in many cases rising from five to 
thirty feet above the level of the water ; a few have been partially 
cleared and cultivated, and have neat residences upon them.
During 
our course from Brockville to Kingston, we visited several of the un- 
cultivated islands, and proceeded over their surface with much diffi- 
culty, owing to the numerous large trunks of trees which had been 
blown down at various periods.
Many of these gigantic masses, com- 
posed chiefly of white pines and hemlock spruces, measured from ten 
to fourteen feet in circumference.
Several were so completely de- 
cayed as to have their surface green with Hypnum moss, forming 
seed-beds for young trees of various descriptions.
Arbor-vitass were 
abundant on them, having their tender roots ramifying through the 
decayed mass.
In no instance did we observe a plant of seedling 
pine on any of the stems of the fir tribe.
" The principal tree growing on these islands was the Arbor-vita3 
{Thuja Occident alls), which generally surrounds the rocky places ; 
then came the oaks, ashes, hickories, elms, sugar-maples, with the 
poplar-leaved and black birches [Beivla pojmlifera and lento), and 
generally in the centre were the white pines and hemlock spruces, 
evidently requiring more shade and damp than the deciduous trees ; 
being rarely seen in their natural condition wholly exposed.
Rubus 
spectabilis was in beautiful flower among the rocks, also the Indian 
hemp {Apocynum androacemifolium).
On the surface of the soil un- 
der the trees we observed considei'able quantities of the following 
herbaceous plants ; viz., Scrophularia marylandica, Teucrium cana- 
dense, Cypripedium humile, Fumaria glauca, with Lycopodium com- 
planatum and dendroideum.
" On reaching Kingston, forty-eight miles above Brockville, we 
remained for several days, and made excursions during our stay in 
various directions.
The first was towards the north-east ; proceeding 
from the town, we came upon several extensive portions of level lime- 
stone rocks, nearly destitute of surface soil ; from their size and posi- 
tion they greatly resembled the tombstones in a burying-ground.
In 
the crevices of these rocks many large plants of Juniper were growing; 
this variety diff'ered from the British by being more glaucous in colour.
63 
and bearing much larger fruit.
On entering the woods, the trees were 
of various kinds and sizes ; oaks varied from six to nine feet in cir- 
cumference, elms from eight to ten, white pines from seven to twelve, 
and tapering to one hundred feet of elevation.
In one spot we ob- 
served six fine specimens of the white pine, within twenty feet of each 
other, and each ten feet in circumference, appearing as if they had 
belonged to the original forest.
Amongst the rich vegetable soil on 
the surface of the ground under the deciduous trees, we picked re- 
markably strong specimens of the coral -root [Corallorhiza multijlora), 
and on the dry barren soil under the pine trees, Rudbeckia divarica- 
ta, Aster macrophyllus, Pyrola uniflora, with Monarda fistulosa and 
mollis, were the chief plants in flower.
A considerable extent of the 
rough stony ground presented at this season of the year (29th July) a 
singular appearance, from the quantity of golden rod [SoUdago altis- 
sima) with which it was covered ; mixed with it was the lion's foot 
[Prenanthus serpentaria) ; this plant is very much diffused over the 
country, and generally found in situations most likely to be infested 
with rattlesnakes, and is extensively used by the American Indians as 
an antidote for the bite of these venomous reptiles.
On the surface 
of some exposed neglected lands, the button-wood {Cephalanthns oc- 
cidentalism formed extensive groups.
Astragalus canadensis was also 
plentiful, with large and fine-flowered specimens of Scutellaria gale- 
riculata.
On the damp places Lobelia Kalmii was richly clothed with 
its beautiful blue flowers, in company with Campanula asarina.
In 
the marshes Utricularia vulgaris.
Ranunculus filiformis and Achamera 
rigida were the chief plants in bloom : and here, for the first time, we 
observed the Tuscarora or wild rice [Zizania aquatica), covering a 
considerable portion of clear shallow water ; it stood two feet above 
the surface, and was in fiill flower.
From its quantity, and graceful 
waving in the wind, it greatly resembled a field of oats." â€” Id. Jan.

chair.
Mr. S.
Gibson presented a specimen of Scirpus acicularis 
{Linn.), with much longer stems than ordinary.
The culms formed a 
dense tuft, about fourteen inches high.
Mr. Fitt presented specimens of an Qj^nanthe, commonly consider- 
ed CE.
pimpinelloides by the botanists of Norfolk.
It is the CE.
La- 
chenalii [Gmel.) of Babington's Manual, and the species confused 
64 
with or mistaken for the true pimpinelloides, by most other English 
botanists, since the time of Hudson.
Four of the specimens were se- 
lected from the Society's herbarium, as showing variations from the 
normal character of the root.
Some of the tubers were branched ; 
some approximated to those of Smith's " peucedanifolia," in being 
thicker and shorter than ordinary.
On one specimen, the external 
fruits in the umbellules are very slightly contracted at their base ; the 
ridges being confluent, and forming a ring, much like the callous base 
of the fruit in the true pimpinelloides.
The specimens were located 
from salt ditches near Yarmouth.
The Secretary called the attention of Members to a series of spe- 
cimens of Dryas octopetala {Linn.), which had been sent to the Soci- 
ety some years ago by Mr. Tatbam, from Arncliff Clouder, Yorkshire.
The sepals or lobes of the calyx varied considerably in length and 
breadth ; on one specimen, the length was scarcely twice the breadth, 
while in another, the length was four times the breadth.
The con- 
vexity of the base of the calyx also varied much.
He reminded the 
meeting that Mr. Babington had described a second species of Dryas 
(D.
depressa.
Bah.), found in Ireland, and distinguished from the well 
known D.
octopetala, by exactly the same characters which these 
specimens proved to be within the range of variation of the true D.
octopetala.
He had not seen any example of the D.
depressa de- 
scribed in Babington's Manual, and could not speak with certainty 
about its claims to be held a distinct species ; but the published cha- 
racters by which it was attempted to be distinguished from the better 
known species, were scarcely sufficient, with these examples before 
the Society.
When a series of specimens of D.
octopetala are exa- 
mined, it will be seen that the sepals are usually broader in those 
which are more advanced in the fruiting stage, as compared with 
others just opening into flower.
Of the specimens before the Society, 
the one having the broadest sepals was advanced in fruit.
But it was 
proper also to observe, that on this specimen a single sepal was longer 
than the rest, and had apparently been white and petal-like at its ex- 
tremity ; it might therefore be held an aberration, rather than a heal- 
thy variation, from the normal form.

Notes on a Botanical Tour in Germany.
By Joseph Woods, Esq., F.L.S.
(Continued from page 42).
On the 22nd July I set off in company with Mr. G.
Woods, on an 
expedition to the Schneeberg ; a mountain, I believe not quite 7,000 
feet high, but which always retains a portion of snow in the upper 
hollows, and may be considered as the most easterly of this limestone 
chain of the Alps.
We took the railroad to Felixdorf, where we got 
an Einspanner to Gutenstein, at the edge of the mountain district.
Three or four rocky romantic valleys here unite, and a beautiful little 
park, with very pleasant and easy walks, give us a great variety of 
charming scenery.
The botany is as good as the scenery, and a very 
short walk produced Silene saxifraga, Arenaria grandiflora, Galium 
aristatum, and Moehringia muscosa.
Euphorbia saxatalis, Potentilla caulescens and Seseli glaucum 
also grow on the rocks about.
It is a point where a large portion of 
the plants of the limestone hills already enumerated meet with those 
which descend from the mountains.
The Schneeberg is divided into 
two great parts, the Kuh Schneeberg, which does not rise above the 
region of the spruce fir, and the Great Schneeberg, which is, perhaps, 
nearly 2,000 feet higher.
We directed our course through the woods 
to the hollow between the two, and then keeping to the right, made 
our way to a sort of inn which has lately been erected on the Kuh 
Schneeberg.
The external circuit of this mountain seems to be 
everj'where steep and rocky.
The summit is far from flat, but rises 
into knolls, two or three hundred feet high, with but little of exposed 
rock.
The fir-trees, as they fall, are mostly left to rot upon the 
ground, as not worth the labour of carrying them down, and conse- 
quently the soil is everywhere composed of decaying wood, while the 
trunks and branches, which still retain some solidity, make rambling 
about a work of difficulty.
On the ascent, we observed the leaves of 
Helleborus niger in great abundance ; Pyrola secunda, P.
rotundi- 
folia, and P.
uniflora were also plentiful, but except a stray specimen 
or two, out of flower.
Veratrum album is common among all the 
lower hills.
Senecio subalpinus of Koch grows in the woods.
Ru- 
mex alpinus is in enormous abundance about the cattle-establish- 
ments on the top, and with it grows Cineraria crispa.
Aspidium montanum occurs on the ascent ; and on the rocky crest 
of the mountain, Veronica saxatilis.
We slept in the Kuh Schneeberg.
The night cold and windy ; 
Vol. II.
K 
00 
the morning cloudy ; the clouds hanging on the higher summits.
Our guide wanted to persuade us, that any further ascent was imprac- 
ticable, and that we had better descend at once to another house of 
entertainment, called the Hochbauer, belonging to the same man, at 
the foot of the mountain.
We ascended one of the knolls over the 
fallen trees and rotten stumps, in order to obtain a better view.
The 
mist had disappeared from many of the surrounding summits, and 
even from some which still retained a portion of snow, and though 
still heavy on the great Schneeberg, it was evidently rising.
We 
therefore determined to pursue our scheme, seeing we had always the 
power of returning, should the fog increase.
Our guide was exces- 
sively out of humour at this determination.
He had been flattering 
himself that he should get the reward for his services without incur- 
ring the labour, and moreover, it appeared afterwards that he was 
entirely ignorant of the country between the Schneeberg and Reiche- 
nau, although he had promised to guide us to the latter place.
I 
added Tozzia alpina and Potentilla aurea to the plants I had gathered 
on the Kuhschneeberg, and the ascent of the great one was rewarded 
by Rhododendron hirsutum.
Campanula alpina, Hedysarum obscurum, 
Oxytropis montana, Viola alpina, Soldanella pusilla, Androsace Cha- 
msejasme and A.
lactea, Finns Pumilio, Primula spectabilis and P.
minima.
The weather cleared as we advanced, and we had an extensive view 
of rugged and broken mountains ; not, according to Gilpin's distinc- 
tion, a mountain view.
We stopped at the Baumgarten, where there 
is another public house, and where we had had some thoughts of 
staying the night, but the Botany did not appear to be interesting, 
and to feel that I had been hurried away from the rich harvest of the 
Great Schneeberg to waste four or five hours in a poor little inn, 
which had no advantage of situation to recommend it, was too pro- 
voking ; we therefore continued our walk over another and lower 
division of the mountain to Reichenau.
Most of the latter part of 
the walk is on a Riesen, or Giant, the name here given to the slides 
down the mountain, which are made for the timber.
The descent of 
the wild magnificent rocky ravine is, however, more rapid than that 
of the Giant, which is interrupted two or three times, and the logs of 
timber are precipitated on banks of loose earth and stones, whence 
they have again to be collected, and placed on the next division of 
the Giant.
These slides are only used in the winter, and are watered 
before being used, if Nature have not already furnished them with an 
icy coat.
67 
The day after our descent from the mountain we made an excursion 
lip the HoUen Thai, the most magnificent mountain pass I ever saw.
Towering precipices of limestone rock rise at various heights on both 
sides, from among the sloping woods, with hardly room for the road, 
and the bright rushing stream between them.
The rocks themselves 
are adorned wit^ wood, where earth enough can collect to afford a 
little nourishment to the roots.
Lycopodium helveticum w^as growing 
on the banks of the river, and Peucedanura verticillare in similar 
situations, but not yet in flower.
We left the principal valley to visit 
a hollow called the great Hdllen Thai, where some banks of shiver 
afforded us Arabis vochinensis, Linaria alpina, Lunaria rediviva, An- 
drosace lactea, Silene alpestris, and several other mountain plants ; 
and at the Kaiser brunnen we got Betonica alopecurus, a plant 
which was abundant enough on our next day's walk.
These banks 
of shiver are often very useful to the botanist, bringing down with 
them many of the plants of the mountain tops, which he thus obtains 
without the labour of climbing to them, and they here mostly come 
into flower earlier than in their original position.
We engaged a carriage to Prein on the next day.
The lower part 
of the hill is slaty, but it afforded us, 1 think, nothing new, but 
Galium rotundifolium.
On the pastures above, and among the 
bushes of Pinus Pumilio, we gathered Achillea Clavennae, and A.
Clu- 
siana, Potentilla Clusiana, Gentiana acaulis and G.
gestivalis, which 
is probably a var.
of G.
verna, Arenaria austriaca, Piimula spectabilis 
and Homogyne discolor.
On the 29th I walked to the Tiirken Schanze ; I have already 
given the botanical result.
Most of the plants which grow there are 
early, and I should have done better to have made it one of my first 
walks about Vienna.
On the 30th I walked to the Marxer Linien, 
which is said to be the station of some rare plants, but I did not find 
even a locality which I could suppose to be productive.
The hack- 
ney coaches at Vienna have no fixed prices, and the knowing how 
to bargain with them is a science of itself, in which the people of 
Vienna are said to be very expert : I have offered two zwanzigers 
(one shilling and four pence) for a distance less than a mile, and it 
has been refused.
They are generally unwilling to take short fares.
On the 31st July I left Vienna as I came to it, in the rain, but it 
afterwards cleared, and we had a pleasant voyage, and the night so 
warm, that many of the passengers passed it on the deck.
Had it been 
otherwise, I do not know how we should have managed, as the sleep- 
ing accommodations are very imperfect, and we were over full.
At 
68 
about two the next day we arrived at Lintz, but it set in wet again 
in the evening, and continued so all the next day.
On the third I 
was called at ten minutes past four, in order to start by the railroad 
at six.
The day was beautiful, and a magnificent view of distant 
mountains relieved the monotony of the plain over which our route 
lay.
I was at a loss to account for the quantity of snow on these 
mountains, of which the highest does not exceed 10,000 feet, 
till I learned at Ischl that, even there, what was rain at Lintz, had 
been partly snow.
I left the carriage, to walk to the falls of the 
Trann, a wild scene of roaring waters, but not of any great elevation.
I attempted to follow the stream, but the late rains had swelled the 
waters, and I found it impracticable.
Potentilla caulescens is plen- 
tiful by the river side, and I gathered one plant of Allium fallax in 
the woods above.
The carnages on this railroad are propelled by 
horses, and not by steam ; and the great object is the conveyance of 
salt from the Saltzburg district, of which the company has the ex- 
clusive privilege.
At Lambach a considerable number of our pas- 
sengers left the train to get into diligences, which were waiting to 
convey them to Saltzburg.
Gmunden is beautifully situated at the foot of its charming lake.
In the immediate neighbourhood are meadows, and cultivated ground ; 
a little further on the left, the rugged Traunsteen rises almost perpen- 
dicularly from the water, and still farther, to the right of the lake, 
stretches the wild ridge of the Hollengebirge, spotted with snow.
A 
steam-vessel took me in the morning to Ebensee, at the opposite end 
of the lake, and a " Stell wagen," a sort of diligence, through a mag- 
nificent mountain pass, to Ischl.
Here I dined, and then proceeded 
to Hallstadt, but the rain came on long before I got there.
The lake of Hallstadt is wilder and more magnificent than that of 
Ginunden (the Traunsee), the mountains descending all round, almost 
perpendicularly, into the water.
The little town itself stands partly 
on the flights of steps on the mountain side, and partly in the water.
The next morning the scud was floating on the mountain sides, and 
clouds covered the tops and the sky, so I thought it would hardly do 
for a long mountain walk, but determined to look about me a little, 
and see what sort of a place I had got into.
A flight of steps, leading 
in a zigzag line through the woods, seemed to give me an opportunity 
of ascertaining what these hanging woods would produce, and tempted 
me on to some high meadows.
At the top of these was a sort of 
village, with saw-mills, and marble-quarries ; above these again, 
woods ; and still higher, broken ground, and a slope of fragments.
69 
The change continually urged me forward, till I found myself among 
patches of snow.
There Dentaria enneaphylla, Aposeris foetida, and 
Clematis alpina, totally out of flower in the lower woods, still dis- 
played their blossoms.
I also got Rhododendron Chamaecistus, Pyrus 
Chamaemespilus (in flower), Gentiana pannonica, Carex firma and 
C. tenuis.
Vicia dumetorum was plentiful in the lower woods.
I 
found Laserpitium hirsutum in the meadows ; Heracleum austriacum 
in the upper woods.
There is a waterfall of considerable elevation in Hallstadt itself, 
presenting, in this wet weather, a good stream of water.
About two 
miles up the valley, which opens just above the town, there is one, in 
every way more important.
The first part is nearly perpendicular, 
for, I should suppose, three hundred feet, and the stream dashes 
down among broken masses of rock, for perhaps as much more.
I 
gathered in the way Cynanchum laxum of Koch, and Valeriana 
exaltata, both rather doubtful species.
The first I think 1 have met 
with more than once in France.
It differs in having shorter stalks 
to the individual flowers, and in a disposition in the stem to be spiral, 
as if climbing at the top.
The other has no extended runners to the 
root, but it must be observed here, as in the Carices, the peculiarity 
of the roots is not in their nature, but in degree, the side shoots of 
the roots rising immediately into stem, close to the old one in V.
exaltata, while in V.
officinalis they are extended first to a considera- 
ble length underground.
In returning, I climbed up a bank com- 
posed of rubbish, brought down by a little stream from some of the 
branches of the Dachstein, the highest of the mountains about Hall- 
stadt, and always retaining great masses of snow.
Here, besides 
many other mountain plants, I found abundance of Cerastium ovatum.
In this, as well as in many other Alpine plants found in similar situa- 
tions, the crown of a fusiform root throws out abundance of equal 
slender stems, a mode of growth which seems essentially different 
from that above described as belonging to the Carices, and to Vale- 
riana exaltata.
These stems are covered up by stones and loose 
earth for a considerable distance, and they seem now and then to 
produce another root, which, like the original one, throws out a num- 
ber of threadlike stems.
Cyclamen Europaeum is so abundant in all 
this neighbourhood, that the wood is often quite purple with its 
blossoms.
Helleborus niger also continues very abundant, but, of 
course, at this season, there were only leaves.
I left Hallstadt on the 6th of August, hoping for better weather, 
and more productive mountains, in the neighbourhood of Salzburg, 
70 
and thus left what I might have done, for an uncertainty, and for 
what, in fact, never took place.
I remained at Salzburg and its 
neighbourhood, including an excursion to Mondsee, from the 8th to 
the 17th, partly in hopes that the weather would improve, and permit 
me to visit some of the snowy mountains which I saw about me, and 
partly to obtain my trunk, which, in order to have as little incum- 
brance as possible in my mountain rambles, I had sent from Linz.
I had delivered it to the people at the inn, at Linz, on Friday, the 
2nd of August : it was not ready till past six in the evening, and they 
assured me that the office would be closed, but promised it should be 
sent on in the morning by the diligence, and it was not till my ar- 
rival at Salzburg, that I learnt that the diligence would not take par- 
cels weighing above three pounds, and that consequently my luggage 
would be given to the baggage-wagon (Fiihr wagen), and that this 
baggage-wagon went only once a week, passing through Linz on the 
Friday night : I took one or two walks about Salzburg, and observed 
Laserpitium Siler and latifolium, and Carduus personatus.
Of Cir- 
sium rivulare, which is said to be very abundant in the meadows, 1 
saw only one specimen, and that was near Mondsee.
It is probably 
cut down in mowing the meadows, and does not reappear.
I made 
also a trip to Mondsee, and in company with Mr, Hinterhuber, of 
that place, up to the Chalets on the SchafFberg, but the fog was so 
dense, and so continued, that after passing the night in a hay-loft, we 
could do nothing but walk down again.
At Mondsee I gathered 
Scrophularia Neesii.
This seems, in that neighbourhood, to occupy 
the place of S.
Ehrarti, from which, perhaps, it is not distinct.
The 
S. aquatica of the German botanist, is what in England has received 
the name of S.
Ehrarti, while our aquatica is by them named Bal- 
bisii, and is a much scarcer plant.
Many mountain plants come 
down in the woods quite to the shores of the lake, but of course these 
were completely out of flower ; Aconitum formosum and A.
flexuosum 
of Reichenbach also grow near the lake, and Galeopsis pubescens is 
abundant.
On the SchafTberg grow Lycopodium annotinum, Pyrolas, 
Campanula Scheuchzeri of Koch., Ranunculus lanuginosus, and 
several other mountain plants, which, at the height I reached, were 
out of flower.
Another excursion was to the Kugelraiihl, at the foot 
of the Untersberg.
I went on a fine evening, in hopes of being able 
to spend two days in exploring the mountain, which is said to be 
rich, and being above 6,000 feet high, always retains patches of snow, 
but rain and mist prevented me.
The Kugelrauhlen are merely little 
spinners in the Alpine stream, furnished by the Fiirstenbrunnen, 
71 
where pieces of marble are reduced to a globular form, by being 
placed on a circular slab of marble, upon which turns a solid slab of 
ashwood of the same size.
There is an extensive tract of peaty 
ground by the way, where Andromeda polifolia, Vaccinium oxycoccus, 
and many other bog plants abound.
I left Salzbiu'g on the 17th, despairing of being able to visit the 
mountains, and perhaps was not very soiTy that the wet weather con- 
tinued as long as I remained at Munich.
I was, however, able to 
revisit Harlacking, but found nothing new, and the Saxifraga mutata, 
which, in my former visit, was only just coming into flower, had now 
mostly discharged its seed.
The meadows were full of a Crepis, 
which has the general appearance of C.
virens, while the form of the 
fruit, and the spreading outer calyx seem rather to refer it to C.
biennis.
I was not sufficiently alive to it at the time, passing it over 
as a variety of C.
virens, and neglected to take anything moi'e than 
a single specimen as a memorandum.
At Munich I went to the 
palace, and to the An Kirche, which I had not seen on my former 
visit.
The first contains, certainly, some very fine rooms, but, on the 
whole, I was rather disappointed, both in the rooms and in the paint- 
ings.
The Au Church is a very beautiful edifice of German gothic, 
with the nave and aisles springing at the same height.
This arrange- 
ment gives a very great height to the windows.
The upper part of 
these has an ornamental pattern of coloured glass, admitting a good 
deal of light ; the lower is enriched with paintings of the life of the 
Virgin Mary, to whom the church is dedicated, in rich and deep 
colouring, and very beautiful.
Each window, and there are nineteen 
of them, is said to have cost Â£1,200.
The boggy ground about 
Munich was too full of water to permit me to botanize upon it.
The 
railroad passes through an extensive tract of it.
On the 21st of August I went to Augsburg.
In the time of its 
prosperity, it was the fashion here to paint the outsides of the houses, 
sometimes with historical or allegorical subjects, sometimes with mere 
ornament, and a good many of these painted outsides still remain.
The diminution of the population of Augsburg, during the last cen- 
tury, seems to be nearly equal to the increase of that of Munich.
The 
immediate neighbourhood is flat.
I attempted to reach some hills, 
of no great elevation indeed, but with woody slopes, which bound the 
valley, but I found myself entangled in a strip of boggy ground, which 
stretches along their feet, and had not time to get to them.
In the 
meadows and bogs we find a mixture of our north of England bo- 
tany, with plants of the Alps, and some of a warmer climate : among 
72 
the former were Tofieldia palustris, Paniassia palustris, Primula 
farinosa, Pinguicula vulgaris, Sanguisorba officinalis, Geum rivals ; 
among the latter, Cirsium oleraceum, Centaurea Jacea, Dianthus 
superbus, Schcenus ferruginous, Gentiana utriculosa, Carduus deflo- 
ratns, Polygala amara.
I only slept one night at Augsburg, and set off the following evening 
for Stuttgard, where we arrived before twelve o'clock.
I called on 
Mr. Lechler, and we set off for a walk, but the rain drove us back 
again.
The next morning, however, we had a very interesting one ; 
the slopes immediately about Stuttgard are covered with vines, a 
novel sight for one coming from Bavaria, but beyond these, there is a 
good deal of forest, where Peucedanum officinale and Cervaria are 
very abundant ; we also gathered Selinum Caruifolium, Laserpitium 
prutenicum.
Campanula Cervicaria, Aster Amellus, and Geranium 
palustre.
Cytisus nigricans grow also here, and I apprehend this is 
nearly its most western station.
Sempervivum tectorum grows on the 
walls of the vineyards, not perhaps indigenous, but perfectly natu- 
ralized, which it is not in England.
Sedum fabaria is abundant, 
but I am not much inclined to admit its separation from S.
Telephium, 
called by Koch S.
purpurascens.
Vicia pisiformis we looked for in 
vain, being apparently too late even for the seeds.
On the 25th I proceeded to Carlsruhe, where I found a very com- 
fortable and reasonable hotel in the Darmstadterhof.
Professor Doll 
conducted me to the Galinsogea parviflora and Hieracium Isevigatum, 
but it was too late in the season to procure good specimens of the 
latter, and T could not observe the character insisted on by Koch, of 
the sort of crown formed by the outer scales of the calyx, when in the 
bud.
In the afternoon we went to Durlach, where we got Polycne- 
mum majus and Euphrasia lutea.
On the 27th I went to Baden, and 
on the 28th, to Eslingen, where I got good specimens of Lolium 
italicum : this Lolium is clearly distinguished from L.
perenne, by 
the young leaves, which are rolled up in the former, and folded flat in 
the common species.
The plant is somewhat more slender, and of a 
different shade of colour, and the spicules rather more lax, so that the 
eye soon catches a difference in the general appearance.
I afterwards 
went to Heidelberg, and stopped there at the Restauratiom, close by 
the railway, thinking it more convenient, as I wished to go off again 
early in the morning, and found myself very well pleased with my 
accommodations.
I called on Professor Bischoff, and afterwards took 
a walk on the banks of the Neckar, but I found nothing.
The next morning I returned by the railroad to St. Ilgen, the first 
73 
station ou the way to Carlsruhe, where I met Professor Doll, and we 
proceeded to investigate the productions of the long sandy tract 
which occupies a middle space between the hills of the Odenwald 
and the Rhine.
We passed through Oftersheim and Schwetzingen, 
and hunted in vain for the Corispermum Marschalii.
I think we 
found nothing which I had not already observed, except the Fungi, 
which were very numerous.
Serratula Pollichii still offered tolerable 
specimens, but Pyrola umbellata was quite out of flower.
The richest 
part of the tract seems to me between Friedrichsfeld and Mannheim, 
on the south side of the railway.
The next day I got the Trapa, 
near Mannheim, in a piece of water, which was, perhaps, once, part 
of the bed of the Neckar, near the road from Mannheim to Secken- 
heim, but I found neither flower nor fruit.
Afterwards I hunted in 
the Neckarau Wald, a woody tract near the Rhine, above Mannheim, 
but there was too much water to permit a successful search for the 
Salvinia, which was my principal object.
Stenactis annua has much 
the appearance of having been sown, I know not why, on the bank 
which separates the waters of the Rhine from the marshy land within.
In descending the Rhine, I determined to have one day more at 
Kreuznach.
Aster Amelias, Chrysocoma Linosyris, Peucedanum alsa- 
ticum, and Stipa capillata, were my best things.
After that I again 
had a little walk at Liege : Carduus acanthoides here approaches to 
the English form.
In Austria the heads appear to be always solitary.
On the Rhine they are generally so, while about Liege they are, per- 
haps, full as often clustered.
C. crisp us I did not see at Liege, but 
on the Rhine the heads are usually, but not always, two or three toge- 
ther.
The three points of difference marked out by Koch are, the 
solitary heads of C.
acanthoides, its somewhat more divided and 
more thorny leaves, and the web-like hairs which cover the under 
surface of the leaves in C.
crispus, but which are said never to be 
found in C.
acanthoides.
On returning to Lewes, I find plants both 
with and without covering to the underside of the leaves, but the 
plants were too far decayed to permit me to determine whether it was 
possible to make out the two species of Koch.
The plant which I 
got last year at Paris is not the German C.
acanthoides, but a hybrid 
between C.
nutans and C.
crispus or acanthoides.

On Saxifraga rotundifolia.
By The Rev. W.
T. Brer, M.A., F.L.S.
In the ' Phytologist ' for January (Phytol.
ii.
3) Mr. Borrer states 
the particulars of Saxifraga rotundifolia having been found by Miss 
White, two years in succession, apparently in a wild situation, near 
the foot of Causey Pike ; and he very naturally and justly observes, 
that her " account encourages a hope that the plant may be truly a 
native of our mountains, although it does not establish it as such," 
Pie concludes his remarks by asking the question, " Can it be that it 
[the Saxifrage] had been purposely sown ?
" I should rejoice to 
hear of so interesting an addition being made to our native Flora ; 
but of that, I fear, there is but slight probability.
It may, perhaps, 
throw some light on the subject, if I state that so long ago as the year 
1810, when I first visited the Lakes, I was informed by Mr. and Mrs.
Hutton, of Keswick, that Saxifraga rotundifolia had been found near 
that place ; I think also that they showed me a dried specimen, but 
of this I will not be quite certain; the particular place, too, where 
the plant had been met with, was mentioned, but at this distance of 
time it has entirely escaped my memoiy : indeed I paid the less at- 
tention to the narration altogether, and did not go in search of the 
plant myself, because my informants, at the very time they stated to 
me the above fact, candidly acknowledged that the plant was not 
really a native of that district, but had been planted in the situation 
where the specimens had been gathered.
It was during the same visit to the Lakes, that I was agreeably sur- 
prised by finding a single small specimen of Saxifraga umbrosa on 
the celebrated Bowther Stone, in Borrowdale, which I gathered, and 
at first treasured up as a genuine native plant, until I learned, as I 
very soon did, that a few years before, some one had been ornament- 
ing this singular rock by planting garden flowers thereon ; thus leaving 
me in no doubt whatever, that my starved though cherished specimen 
of London Pride, was but the remnant of such adventitious embel- 
lishments.
One thing, then, I think, may be regarded as certain : that previ- 
ously to the year 1810, botanical frauds (so to call them) had been 
practised in the neighbourhood of Keswick, and that some one or 
other had been in the habit of planting garden species in apparently 
wild situations of that district.
Whether Miss Wright's Saxifi-aga 
rotundifolia be a true native, or merely an exotic introduced to the 
mountains by the hand of man, it would, of course, be presumptuous 
in me to pronounce.
I have, however, very strong suspicions, if the 
75 
truth must be spoken, tliat it is of the latter character.
But at all 
events, botanists will do well to be on the look out for the plant in 
the Lake district.

Note on Lastrcea recurva.
By The Rev. W.
T. Bree, M.A., F.L.S.
While the pen is in my hand, I cannot resist the inclination I feel 
to offer a iew remarks suggested by the perusal of the notice of New- 
man's 'British Ferns,' in the last number (Phytol.
ii.
21), and by that of 
the review of the same work in the ' Annals and Magazine of Natural 
History' for December, (p.
427).
The writer of the last-named arti- 
cle admits that the much disputed fern, Lastrsea recurva, is, he now 
thinks, " a good species." This is so far satisfactory to my mind, as 
I have ever from the first believed it to be distinct, even in spite of 
high authorities to the contrary.
But he objects vehemently to the 
specific name, " recurva," as being quite incorrect, and " conveying a 
totally wrong idea of the character of the frond, the whole and every 
part of which is more or less incurved (the edges turning upwards), 
never recurved or turned downwards." Allow me to ask â€” I would 
not do so arrogantly, but for the sake of information, â€” whether " re- 
curvus " necessarily signifies bent downwards and not upwards ?
If 
so, is it not a rather arbitrary restriction of the meaning of the word ?
The dictionaries give as its signification simply "crooked" or "bent 
back," &c., not confining its sense to an inclination in either direc- 
tion.
A certain bird, well known to naturalists, without any imputa- 
tion (so far as I know) of passing under a misnomer, bears the very 
appropriate appellation of " Recurvirostra," from the singular circum- 
stance of its bill turning upwards in a very unusual manner, and pre- 
cisely in the same direction as do the edges of the pinnules of the 
fern in question.
At all events, I trust that the specific name"dume- 
torum " will not be retained for our Lastraea, as the writer of the article 
in the Annals suggests it should be ; since that would lead to confu- 
sion, the specimens preserved in Smith's herbarium under that deno- 
mination, avowedly, it seems, " not agreeing with it." It may be 
added, too, that the name "dumetorum" is not sufficiently distinctive, 
and might with equal, and even far more propriety, be applied to 
other species.
Should " recurva " be deemed so incorrect as to be 
inadmissible, would the writer of the article in the Annals approve of 
" iucurva " being substituted in its place ?
I confess I should wish 
76 
to see the fern distinguished by a name expressive of the peculiar 
curvature of the frond, which is the obvious and most striking charac- 
ter that first meets the eye of the beholder, whether any choose to 
express this character by the term recurva, incurva, concava, or what 
not.

Allesley Rectory, January 23, 1845.
Notice of the ' Supplement to English Botany^ Nos. 59 â€” 62, inclusive.
We regard the ' English Botany ' as so completely a standard and 
sterling publication, that we always have great pleasure in contribut- 
ing our aid, however inefficient, in the endeavour to increase the sale 
of the Supplement.
No portion of the original work was prepared 
with greater care, or evinced more consummate knowledge of the sub- 
ject; and none of the plates have exhibited greater accuracy or beau- 
ty; â€” than are displayed in the numbers published during the past 
year.
Our limits prevent our giving much more than a list of the spe- 
cies figured.
2879.
Conferva Brownii.
The description is by the Rev. M.
J. 
Berkeley, who informs us that the plant was originally found by Mr.
Brown, in a cave near Dunrea, in the north of Ireland : it has since 
occurred in the county Wicklow ; and Mr. Ralfs has met with it on 
the Cornish coast.
Mr. Harvey (Man. Brit.
Alg. 134) compares it to 
Conferva aegagropila.
2880.
Atriplex rosea.
Mr. Babington, who describes this Linnaean 
species, thinks it has usually been confounded with A, patula by Eng- 
lish botanists.
It is common on the sea-coast throughout Britain.
2881.
Polysiphonia pulvinata.
This is the Conferva pulvinata of 
Roth.
It has been found at Port Stuart by Mr. Moore ; at Milltown 
Malbay by Mr. Harvey ; and on the Devonshire and Coniish coasts 
by Mrs. Griffiths and Mr. Ralfs.
The description is from the pen of 
the Rev. Mr.
Berkeley.
2882.
Polysiphonia thuyoides.
This Conferva was first described 
by Mr. Harvey in the ' Flora Hibernica,' part iii.
p. 205.
The habi- 
tat (Cornish and Devon coasts) is omitted.
The description of this 
species is also contributed by Mr. Berkeley.
2883.
Ruhus glandulosus.
Mr. Borrer we believe to be the contri- 
butor of the excellent and detailed description of this "remarkable 
and beautifiil bramble." It is an old continental species, and com- 
mon in various parts of Europe, but was first discovered as British by 
77 
our able con*espondent, Mr. R.
Spruce, in a plantation on Terrington 
Car, near Castle Howard, Yorkshire, where it grows among rushes on 
a moist peaty soil, covering about a rood of ground, almost to the 
exclusion of every other bramble.

Epipactis ovalis.
This is the E.
latifolia, j3.
of Smith's 
' English Flora,' iv.
41.
Mr. Babington, both in his Manual and in 
the present paper, gives it as E.
ovalis.
It occurs on stony slopes of 
rubbish, at the base of limestone cliffs, on the mountains near Settle, 
in Yorkshire.
2885.
Carex Buxhaumii.
This species, apparently well known on 
the continent, was discovered as British by Mr. Moore, upon a small 
island in Lough Neagh, near Toom Bridge, flowering in June.
Dr.
Boott states that the original Lapland specimens of C.
canescens be- 
long to this species, and therefore that that name should be retained.
The description is by Mr. Babington.
2886.
Eriophorum gracile.
Another well known continental spe- 
cies, first found in Britain near Croft, in Yorkshire, in 1825, by Mr.
Woods ; and subsequently in Surrey, at Whitemoor Pond, half way 
between Guildford and the Woking station of the South-western rail- 
way, we believe by Mr. Borrer, who contributes the detailed and ad- 
mirable description.
2887.
Phascum Floerkeanum.
Found in 1840 by Mr. R.
B. Bow- 
man, of Newcastle, on the Durham coast, in fields about half way 
between Sunderland and South Shields, and subsequently by Mr.
Thomhill, in fields one mile from Ravensworth Castle, Durham.
It 
is an old species, bearing the same name in Weber and Mohr's admi- 
rable little Taschenbuch, p.
70, and in other continental works.
Mr.
Wilson is the describer of this and the following species.
2888.
Grimmia orbicularis, Mr. Wilson first discovered this spe- 
cies as British, on Orme's Head, in 1826.
Mr. Eagle and Mr.
Thwaites subsequently found it on St. Vincent's Rocks, near Bristol.
It much resembles G.
pulvinata, but is really distinct.
2889.
Callithamnion harbatum.
This beautiful little seaweed, pre- 
viously described by Agardh and Harvey, was discovered by Mr. Ralfs 
at Ilfracombe, and on the quay at Penzance, forming densely tufted 
deep red patches on mud.
The Rev. Mr.
Berkeley contributes the 
description.
2890.
Arenaria uliginosa.
The discovery of this little plant in 
Yorkshire has frequently been noticed in our pages, where also its 
various synonymes have been given.
The description is by Sir W.

Note on the rediscovery of Malaxis paludosa at Tonhrklge Wells.
By Mr. Edward Jenner, A.L.S.
May I be allowed to add a few words to Mr. Sharp's paper on this 
subject in your last number, (Phytol.
ii.
42).
Malaxis paludosa must 
be considered as a rare plant in the South of England.
I am ac- 
quainted with only four habitats in Sussex, namely, Chiltington Com- 
mon near Pulborough, where the late Mr. Dickson found it long ago, 
and where it still exists ; two stations on Ashdown Forest ; and the 
one mentioned by Mr. Sharp, where I saw it growing in September 
last.
I have never heard of a single locality in Surrey, or in Kent, 
since the time of Ray, when it is said to have been found in Romney 
Marsh.
To an ardent botanist â€” a true lover of Nature â€” there is doubt- 
less unspeakable pleasure in finding a new station for a rare plant ; 
but how much greater to such a one the pleasure in seeing, season 
after season, a rare or interesting plant in its native habitation !
I am 
therefore by no means surprized at the rapturous exclamation of Mr.
Sharp, at the rediscovery of Ray's habitat for the Malaxis.

1844.
Any detailed notice of this part of the Transactions (which com- 
pletes the 1st vol.) is rendered unnecessary by the ample Reports of 
the Society's Proceedings, which now appear in our pages.
We 
have, however, marked a few particulars, not noticed in the Proceed- 
ings, which we trust will not be uninteresting to our readers.
The first article in the part before us is the paper on the Vegetation 
of the Outer Hebrides, by Prof Balfour and Mr. Babington, previ- 
ously noticed, (Phytol.
i. 135).
The value of this contribution to sci- 
ence will be understood, when it is considered that so little had this 
group been explored with regard to its botanical productions, that 
" not a single reference to them appears in Mr. Watson's ' New Bota- 
nist's Guide.' Indeed, it would seem that a considerable portion of 
the group, is almost a terra incognita, not only to botanists, but to 
80 
tourists generally ; for our party " were quite unable to obtain the 
slightest information concerning the Long Island (as the whole group 
from Barra Head to the Butt of the Lewis is collectively denominat- 
ed), upon the mainland of Scotland, or even in any part of Skye.
No 
person from whom we were able to inquire, and the number was far 
from being small, could inform us if we should find any inns, roads, 
or resident gentlemen in the Long Island, and we were therefore the 
more surprized and gratified by finding comfortable inns at Obb, Tar- 
bet and Stomoway ; to walk along excellent roads in most parts of 
North Uist, Harris and Lewis ; and to be received with kindness and 
the most liberal hospitality by numerous resident gentlemen." â€” p.
135.
Near Ord, in Skye, were seen considerable remains of natural wood, 
consisting chiefly of Betula alba, B.
glutinosa and Alnus glutinosa.
At Camisunary the party gathered " a remarkable variety of Oporinia 
autumnalis, of very large size, and with the peduncles and involu- 
crum densely clothed with slender, greenish-black, crisped hairs.
" 
By the road-side between Sligachan and Bracadale was noticed a 
curious form of Taraxacum, resembling that usually called T.
palustre, 
but with the notches of the leaves reflexed, and the outer bracts lan- 
ceolate-attenuated; the direction of these bracts is not mentioned, but 
we presume they were erect.
This plant could not be referred to any 
of those described by DeCandolle ; the authors however consider that 
nearly all his Taraxaea vera are forms of one variable species.
The following extract relates principally to one of our most inte- 
resting plants, now, we fear, entirely lost to Britain.
" On our way from Tarbet to Stomoway, we visited the Shiant Islands, which are 
remarkable for their grand basaltic columns and lofty cliffs.
It is stated in all our 
later Floras, that the Menziesia caerulea was found on them by the late Mr. G.
Don ; 
and we therefore examined them with great care, in the hope of finding so rare a plant, 
confirming a doubtful station, and proving the present existence of this beautiful 
heath as a native of Scotland.
We say present existence, as it must be well known to 
most of the members of this Society, that, owing to the misconduct of a nurseryman, 
who dug up all the specimens that he could find, amounting, it is said, to nearly a cart 
load, it is supposed to be now quite extinct upon the Sow of Athol.
We were how- 
ever totally unsuccessful, and have every reason to believe that the Menziesia is not 
an inhabitant of the Shiant Isles, but that some mistake has caused it to be reported 
to grow there.
We found Empetrum nigrum on the higher parts of one of the islands; 
and as that plant has once already been mistaken for Menziesia, we may be perhaps 
allowed to suspect a similar error in the present case, more especially as it seems pro- 
bable that Mr. G.
Don never visited the islands, but that he sent information of the 
discovery to Sir J.
E. Smith, upon the authority of Mr. De Ramm, whose name is 
joined with his own in the ' English Flora.' Mr. Kippist, at Mr. Babington's sug- 
gestion, has examined the specimens in the Smithian Herbarium, and reports that the 
81 
only native specimens of Menziesia caerulea in that herbarium, are three little scraps, 
marked in Sir James Smith's handwriting, as from ' the Western Isles of Shiant,' but 
without any mention of the person by whom they were collected.
Smith has left no 
memorandum on the subject, either in his herbarium, or in the interleaved copy of his 
' English Flora.' Professor Don, who has seen the specimens, does not think they 
were sent by his father." â€” p.
141.
In the Shiant Isles, our tourists were much struck with the kixuri- 
ant growth of many of the plants; some specimens of Carex binervis 
" were fiill five feet in length, and had small spikes produced in the 
place of the lower flowers of several of the fertile catkins.
Many of 
the spikes were male in the upper half and female in the lower." 
Juncus balticus was gathered in profusion at Barvas ; where also 
Petasites vulgaris was observed to be very abundant, and its roots are 
given to cattle in the winter months.
On the northern shore of Loch Maree, at Polewe, in Ross-shire, 
Arctostaphylos Uva-ursi was seen in abundance, " descending almost 
to the edge of the water ; and in one place there are the remains of a 
forest of Pinus sylvestris, Quercus Robur and Populus tremula, occu- 
pying the clefts and ledges of lofty and almost perpendicular rocks, 
rising directly from the water.
Many of the noble fir-trees assumed 
the most picturesque forms, spreading their stems, branches and roots 
over the face of the rock, in a truly remarkable manner." 
The next article is a Catalogue of the plants collected in the above 
excursion.
The list, including varieties, consists of 325 flowering 
plants, 23 Filices, Lycopodiacese and Equisetaceae, 50 Mosses, 11 
Jungermanniae, 27 Lichens and 24 Algae.
A great proportion of 
the plants are species looked upon as common by the English bota- 
nist.
By observations made in this excursion, the northern range of 
the following plants, in degrees of latitude, has been ascertained to 
extend beyond that previously recorded.

' Remarks on the Mode of Growth of the British Fruticose Rubi ; 
and the Forms derivable from Rubus cajsius.
By Edwin Lees, F.L.S.
&c.' Mr. Lees states that in the course of his observations on these 
puzzling plants, he has found the term biennial altogether misapplied, 
since, with the exception of Rubus Idaeus, be believes that none are 
limited in their duration to Uvo years, " and even that species, when 
not under cultivation, often exists tJiree years before it dies." 
A fine barren shoot of R.
fruticosus, springing from the hedge of 
Mr. Lees' garden at Forthampton in Gloucestershire, had penetrated a 
mass of ivy against a summer-house, the wood-work of which stopped 
the progress of the bramble-shoot at some distance from the ground.
" A knob of fibrous roots was formed as usual, but being unable to 
enter the earth, they died.
The following season, this barren shoot, 
instead of producing y?o^^'erm^ branches, as I expected, shot forth a 
number of long barren shoots, commencing from the extremity of the 
old barren stem where the roots had died, and so on to its origin with 
the parent stem, which was still in a state of flourishing existence, 
hoymg flowered, and shot forth barren shoots also.
So that here was 
a Rubus of at least three year's growth, still throtving out barren, 
hranchesy The barren shoot, on the following year, produced many 
branches, probably fertile ; but Mr. Lees left the neighbourhood be- 
fore he could ascertain this point.
The author has " since examined 
a multiplicity of brambles, of almost every assumed species," and al- 
most without exception finds their period of growth to be at least tri- 
ennial, while in many instances the original stem lasted four, five, or 
even six years.
The author then explains six modes of growth of the fi-uticose Rubi, 
his observations on which seem to demand the attention of botanists ; 
but as some of them would be scarcely intelligible without the illus- 
trations, we refrain from quoting them, and prefer giving Mr. Lees' 
remarks on the supposed hybridity of some forms of bramble.
" It has been often gratuitously supposed, that the numerous forms 
of fruticose Rubi are due to hybridity ; and at a first glance at the 
subject, this might seem a reasonable supposition: â€” but after an at- 
tentive examination of some years, I have never yet met with a deci- 
ded and unquestionable hybrid bramble, and I believe none exist in 
a state of nature.
I have searched diligently for such in woods abun- 
8a 
dantly stored with R.
Idseus, suberectus and Koehleri, in juxta-posi- 
tion, but could never meet with even a suspicious specimen ; and no 
one has ever noticed any step between R.
Idaeus and other fruticose 
brambles, where the hybrid, if in existence, would be so easily distin- 
guishable.
" I therefore consider that the numerous forms of the fruticose Rubi 
are due to situation, aspect, age, and luxuriance of growth ; so that it 
becomes useful to trace, if possible, the changes that circumstances 
may cause in one species.
With this view I have directed my atten- 
tion to the vitality existing in the stems of brambles, which I find far 
greater than usually supposed, or hitherto recorded, and thus the very 
great difference apparent in specimens of the same species is account- 
ed for, as well as the difficulty that often presents itself in determin- 
ing dried specimens." â€” p.

" In woods and on mountains in the south of Ireland." Differing 
from J.
trilobata [Linn.), in its smaller size, its rufous tinge, its erect 
stems, and its acute, convex and minutely bidentate leaves, which are 
less imbricate and point forwards ; the calyces too are acuminate and 
split into four segments ; the peduncle to the capsule is shorter ; the 
stipules more entire ; the perigonia nearly spherical, and the perigo- 
nial leaves divided half way down.
The following remarks on the Jungermannige are valuable.
" Na- 
ture has distributed her characters to certain genera so that they 
contain but a few species ; to others so, that they embrace a vast mul- 
titude.
Such last appears to be the case with the Jungermanniae, 
whose numbers, however inconvenient, are to be parcelled out into 
new groups with the extremest caution.
We only deceive ourselves 
by an imaginary convenience, if we are satisfied with weak or incon- 
stant characters in forming new genera.
When Nature has linked 
the species, it is perhaps worse than useless to attempt to separate 
them.
Jungermannia exigua has strong claims to be considered allied 
to J.
excisa [Dicks.), on the one hand, and to J, tridenticulata on the 
other, which last it is still held to be by acute botanists.
Again, J.
tridenticulata is still retained as a variety only of J.
spinulosa [Dicks.) 
by Lindenberg, in his great work on the Hepaticas, now publishing.
But how unlike are the extremes of this series of four species !
and 
what advantage can be expected from the separation of these extremes 
into different genera ?
It is not because a genus is large, that there- 
fore it should be partitioned.
Although the frondose Jungermanniae 
seem to have constant characters, by which they may be separated 
from the foliaceous; and, again, a small tribe of these having an irre- 
gular dehiscence of the capsule, may be grouped aside, yet for the 
main body no constant and exact characters of subdivision, though 
long looked for, have as yet been discovered." â€” p.

On the Branch -bearing Leaves of Jtingermannia juniperina, {Sw .) 
By Mr. Richard Spruce, 
Branch-bearing Leaves of Jungermannia juniperina, magnified.
Shortly after my return from an excursion to the South-west of 
Ireland, in the summer of 1842, having occasion to examine some 
fine specimens of Jungermannia juniperina (Sw.), collected in com- 
pany with Dr. Taylor, at Cromaglown, on the 13th of July, I noticed 
that at the summit of one of the stems, the leaves were so closely 
crowded together as to form a sort of coma ; and that from amongst 
these leaves, which were spread out on every side and recurved, there 
proceeded several minute branchlets, some nearly erect, others grace- 
fully pendulous, resembling in miniature the flagelliform ramuli of 
Mnium undulatum, Hedw.
(Bryum ligulatum, Muse.
Brit.).
I imme- 
diately placed the specimen under the microscope, and proceeded to 
dissect it ; but what was my surprise to find that the branchlets issu- 
ing from the coma, instead of being attached to the main stem, actu- 
ally grew on the surface of the leaves, where they had all the appear- 
ance of having been stuck on by art !
Each of the comal leaves bore 
at least one branchlet.
but some of the central ones two, not confined 
to any particular point of the surface of the leaf, except that they ne- 
ver arose from the lobes ; and they were clad with leaves and stipules 
precisely like those of the stem, though of course very much smaller, 
for the whole branchlet rarely exceeded in length the leaf on which 
86 
it grew, and in one instance only have I seen it thrice as long.
The 
base of each branchlet is slightly dilated into a sort of bulb, which is 
affixed to the leaf by a very small surface (covering exactly one cel- 
lule), and when detached by gentle force, it brings away with it the 
upper paries of the cellule.
In no case have I been able to detect 
any radicles proceeding from the base of the ramulus, and connecting 
it with the leaf; and sections that I have carefully made of the leaf 
and ramulus at the point of attachment, have failed to reveal any pe- 
culiarity of structure.
T have kept my sketch and notes of this remarkable monstrosity 
(for such 1 considered it) laid aside for upwards of two years, hoping 
that I might meet with some analogous structure in other species of 
the genus, or in other tribes of plants, which would lead to a correct 
explanation of the mode of its production ; but in this I have hitherto 
been disappointed.
There can be little doubt that the matter from 
which these branchlets are orgaiiized, exists in the cellules from which 
they spring ; and perhaps their formation may be accounted for by re- 
garding them as gemmae, which have developed into distinct plants 
while yet remaining in adhesion to the parent stem.
It is true, that, 
so far as I am aware, this premature growth of gemmae has never been 
observed in the tribe of Jungermanniege, yet there is something very 
similar in the Marchantieae ; and in some genera of Lichens we find 
gemma?
arising from the surface of the thallus, and developing into 
perfect plants, whose connexion with the parent plant is very tardily 
â€” 'Sometimes never â€” dissolved.
It is to be regretted that I was 
unable to meet with a leaf-branch of Jungermannia juniperina just 
bursting from its cell, which would ])robably have afforded a clew 
to the cause of its appearance in such an unusual locality ; but all 
that I have seen were considerably protruded, and, in all that regards 
their structure, fully formed.

On Ceradia furcaia.
By Prof.
Balfour.
You will see in Lindley's Register for February, that the plant from 
Ichaboe, noticed by Dr. Maclagan at the January Meeting of the 
Botanical Society of Edinburgh (Phytol.
ii.

belonging to the natural order Compositse, and section Erechthiteae.
I have lately received a specimen of the plant in a better state than 
that noticed by Dr. Maclagan.

On the Yellow Juice of (Enanihe crocata.
By J.
H. Balfour, M.D.
Professor of Botany in the University of Glasgow.
In the last number of the ' Phytologist,' I observe that there is a 
question put by Mr. Mill, as to the yellow juice of Qinanthe crocata, 
(Phytol.
ii.
48).
It is quite true that on cutting across the roots of Q^nanthe crocata 
in the fresh state, there is no appearance of a yellow juice ; but after 
short exposure to the air and absorption of oxygen, I have frequently 
seen the juice assume a yellowish or brownish tinge.
In this way we 
may probably account for the statements made by different botanists.
As to the acrid nature of the juice, I cannot speak from personal ob- 
servation.
It is curious to remark, in regard to the roots of this plant, that in 
some localities they seem to be innocuous, while in others they are 
decidedly poisonous.
This has been distinctly shown by the experi- 
ments of Prof.
Christison.
The juice of the roots of plants growing 
in the neighbourhood of Edinburgh, had no effect when given in large 
quantities to animals; while that from the roots of plants growing near 
Liverpool, acted as a poison.
Peculiarities of soil or climate would 
appear to modify, in a remarkable degree, the properties of many re- 
puted poisonous plants.
Dr. Christison read an interesting paper on 
this subject before the Royal Society of Edinburgh, and he has illus- 
trated it by reference to CEnanthe crocata, Cicuta virosa, and other 
plants.

Observations on the Genus Ruhiis.
By T.Bell Salter, M.D., F.L.S.
At the close of ray remarks on the Botany of Selborne (Phytol.
i. 
1132), I forebore to make any comments on the Rubi I had obtained, 
not, as I then observed, because they were either few, or wanting in 
interest, but because they were still sub judice.
Since that time I 
have carefully examined them, and under circumstances, as I shall 
presently show, which will enable me to speak of them with some 
considerable degree of confidence.
The genus Rubus had uniformly, and as if by common consent, 
been neglected by the earlier botanists.
With regard to the investi- 
gation of our British species, nothing had been done until Bicheno 
88 
and Forster turned their attention to them, and the result of their la- 
bours, with the earlier efforts of Borrer, and those of the eminent au- 
thor himself, are given by Sir James Smith in his elaborate Flora, 
until the appearance of which no British synopsis contained any at- 
tempt at discriminating them.
To Dr. Lindley we are indebted for a more decided step towards a 
precise knowledge of our native species, than had been taken by any 
of his predecessors.
The clear, characteristic, and concise descrip- 
tions, condensed by him from the work of Weihe and Nees, are at the 
same time not only more precise, and recognizing many common 
forms, not before in our English books, but also were far more avail- 
able, from their very conciseness, than the elaborate descriptions of 
Smith ; and it speaks much for the correct observation of these justly 
celebrated authors, Weihe and Nees, that the circulation amongst Bri- 
tish botanists, of these condensed descriptions of theirs, should, in a 
short space of time, have done more to make us generally acquainted 
with our own species of this genus, than all the previous efforts of 
our own botanists.
It would not be just, however, towards Dr. Lindley, to deny him 
any other praise than for the great service he did us, in making us 
acquainted with these authors ; for although his subsequent engage- 
ments have led him to abandon the study of this genus, on which he 
had worked so successfully, this was not until he had recognized 
some new forms : and though he did not pursue the subject till he had 
attained so accurate a knowledge as some who have followed him, the 
account of them in his Flora was yet the first approaching to much 
precision or completeness that had been published in this country, 
both as regards the enumeration of forms or species, and characteris- 
tic descriptions.
But probably no one individual in this country has devoted so 
much time and successful attention to this subject, as my excellent 
friend Mr. Borrer.
He has done so, however, in a way characteristic 
of himself.
Though he has published nothing, or very little, on this 
subject, yet much that is valuable in the works of others, derives a 
great portion of that value from the labours of Mr. Borrer, who is al- 
ways ready to impart from his ample fund of information, and who, 
more than almost any one, successfully pursues the study of Nature 
without a thought of fame.
In the British Floras of Smith, Hooker, 
and Babington, in the local Flora of Leighton, and in 'English Bo- 
tany,' a large proportion of the information on this subject is from 
Mr. Borrer.
For myself, I am indebted for an act of private libera- 
89 
lity from this gentleman, which fully deserves this public acknow- 
ledgment.
As soon as he knew that I had been collecting and was 
examining Rubi, the whole of his valuable collection was instantly at 
my disposal; â€” a collection containing an immense number of speci- 
mens, and authenticating the opinions of nearly all who have studied 
the subject for many years.
This is one of the circumstances to which 
I alluded at the commencement of this notice, as enabling me to speak 
of my Selborne specimens with some degree of confidence.
Another 
of them is, that I had very lately the advantage of a visit from my 
friend Mr. Babington, who brought with him a large portion of his 
Rubi.
The mutual comparison of specimens which we had thus an 
opportunity of making, is far more satisfactory and precise than end- 
less reference to descriptions, even the very best ; and indeed, better 
and more happy descriptions, given, too, as they are, in iew words, 
and in a genus so difficult, cannot be imagined, than those of Babing- 
ton.
Certainly, no other analysis or description of the British species 
of this genus, approaches those of the Manual, either in comprehen- 
siveness or perspicuity.
Another advantage which I had in looking over specimens with 
Mr. Babington, was, that he is well acquainted with the herbarium of 
Mr. Leighton, the accurate and laborious author of the ' Shropshire 
Flora,' to whom we stand indebted for the immense trouble he took in 
collecting large numbers of specimens, and sending them for authen- 
tication, not only to the most eminent botanists of this country, but to 
those of the continent also.
There were many of these series of spe- 
cimens, with memoranda of their various authentications, in the valu- 
able collection of Mr. Bon'er, kindly lent to me.
I mention the above circumstances, to show how far I have had an 
opportunity, in the remarks which follow, of authenticating and com- 
paring the specimens of which I speak ; and in doing so 1 must men- 
tion two other opportunities, namely, the donations of the Botanical 
Societies of Edinburgh and London.
Those which I received from 
the Edinburgh Society were few in number, but excellent specimens, 
and correctly named : those from the London Society were much 
more numerous, but I cannot compliment either the specimens or the 
accuracy of their names.
I regret not having seen the herbarium of Mr. Edwin Lees, a gen- 
tleman, who, I am aware, has for many years paid great attention to 
the Rubi, and who cannot have laboured so much without arriving at 
some valuable results.
But though I have not had the opportunity of 
knowing his opinions of species, except very imperfectly, from inci- 
VOL.
II.
N 
dental sources, I shall yet have occasion to allude to his very inte- 
resting remarks on the habits of Rubi, which have appeared in the late 
part of the 'Transactions of the Botanical Society of Edinburgh.' 
One of the greatest difficulties in this difficult genus, is the assign- 
ing of the exact limits of species.
There are often forms sufficiently 
marked and constant to require a clear discrimination from others, 
with which, however, they evidently occasionally osculate.
They 
cannot on this account be considered specifically distinct, and yet 
there is an inconvenience in considering them mere varieties, because, 
like true species, these again have variations of form which require to 
be recognized.
In the ' Manual of British Botany ' by my friend Dr.
Macreight, an attempt is made by the late eminent botanist, my la- 
mented friend David Don, who, I am informed by the accomplished 
author himself, supplied this genus for the Manual, â€” to get over this 
difficulty, by distinguishing these forms as sub-species.
This arrange- 
ment has not been accomplished with so much accuracy as I should 
have expected from one in general so accurate ; but it is not of the 
execution of the task I now wish to speak, but of the principle, I 
confess there appears to me something contradictory in the very name 
of a sub-species ; and I would rather recognize those forms which are 
really not species, as varieties ; and when these again contain forms 
requiring notice, I would recognize and designate them as sub-varie- 
ties* This appears far less objectionable, and would not very fre- 
quently require to be made use of.
It is almost universally believed of the Rubi, that they are plants 
with perennial roots, producing biennial wood ; that the stems are, â€” 
to use the words of Lindley, â€” " sterile the first year, bearing flowers 
and fruit the second, and then perishing." f Even those close obser- 
vers of these plants, the illustrious Weihe and Nees von Esenbeck, 
were of this opinion,^ as well as all the authors of our various Floras.
* Somewhat in the manner of Mr. Borrer's analysis of Rosa canina in Hooker's Flora.

" Rubi, cum aliis 
plantis, his similibus, inter veras frutices, quorum caulis perstat, et plantas, perenni 
radice instmctas, (seu caulocarpicas DecandoUii), medium fere locum occupant, cum 
non nisi pars eorum ferat hyemem, omnisve, ut rem acu attingamus, surculus vitam 
biennem expleat ; namque primo, quo surculi enati sunt, anno citissime crescunt, et

I have for some time been aware that this is not always the case in 
Rubns discolor {JV.et N.), and I have several times mentioned to my 
friends, that one variety of this species assumed a mode of gi'owth 
very analogous to that of the genus Rosa; and some few months since 
I had been surprised to observe how much more usual was the bud- 
ding of shrubs, which had previously fruited, than I was at all pre- 
pared to believe.
While making observations on this point, the last 
part of the ' Transactions of the Botanical Society of Edinburgh ' 
came into my hands, containing the interesting paper of Mr. Lees be- 
before alluded to.
To this gentleman is certainly due the credit of 
pointing out a most remarkable and prevalent error respecting the ha- 
bits of this very common genus.
T have myself lately examined a 
large number of brambles, and I am, in common with Mr. Lees, per- 
suaded that the general rule in the fruticose .Rubi, is, that the stems 
are not biennial.
Of Rubus discolor, I have carefully scrutinized a 
great number of plants ; and I find very generally that those which 
have already flowered and borne fruit two years, are preparing to do 
so again ; thus making the age of the shrub not ttvo years, but /our 
at least.
I believe in no instance do buds remain dormant, and sprout 
from wood of more than one year's age, but that each year as long as 
the stem lasts, some barren shoots, as well as flowering shoots, are 
produced, from which the future shoots of both kinds proceed.
The 
larger flowering shoots or panicles are also permanent, and while the 
flowering portion dies in the winter, the lower portion remains, and 
gives rise to other panicles, precisely as do the secondary barren 
shoots.
The following I believe, in fact, to be the ordinary habit of 
Rubus discolor (JV.
et N.), the commonest of our English brambles.
Tlie first years shoot from the root is a very long barren stem, 
which roots at the end : the part nearest the end bears no buds, as a 
general rule, capable of producing shoots, but only of rooting ; for I 
know, from very recent observation, that not only the extreme point, 
but also the buds near it, are capable of rooting, and occasionally do 
so.
Tlie second year, the extreme portion of the stem, that nearest 
the rooted point above mentioned, generally dies ; the buds nearest 
this dead portion produce panicles of flowers, the extreme ones of or- 
dinary size, but those nearer the root â€” the original root â€” are of larger 
size, with much branched inflorescence, and borne on very long stems, 
which, the flowering portion at the end having perished, remain till 
the following year, and produce panicles of ordinary size.
Nearer 
still to the root, not panicles but barren stems are produced ; these, 
though smaller than the original ones from the root, have all the ge- 
neral characters of primary barren shoots, and root at the end.
The 
92 
third year, panicles and barren shoots are produced, but the latter 
are very short, and, I believe, never I'ooting ; â€” to use the words of 
Mr. Lees, " the vital principle seems considerably diminished the third 
year, and so gradually dies out." Beyond the fourth year of duration 
and the third of flowering, I have as yet noticed no conclusive instance, 
but Mr. Lees, whose attention has been longer directed to this point, 
mentions that their duration is sometimes continued to a much longer 
period.
I have chosen this species â€” Rubus discolor â€” from which to de- 
scribe these habits, partly because I have had most opportunity of 
observing it of late, and partly because this kind of growth appears to 
be more developed in this than in some other species ; still, I have 
sufficient opportunity for observing that the greater part at least of the 
ordinary species are by no means biennial only.
Perhaps the one most removed of all from that habit of growth now 
newly described, is Rubus Idaeus, and this, probably almost without 
exception, produces stems which flower the second year, and then 
perish.
I am informed, however, by my friend Mr. John Lawrence, 
the highly intelligent gardener at St. John's, near Ryde, of one point 
in which this species maintains some analogy with the others.
He 
informs me that there is one variety, called the double-fruited rasp- 
berry, which produces flowers and fruit at the extremity of the annual 
shoot ; the part which has flowered perishes, and the lower part per- 
sisting through the winter, produces lateral panicles the following 
year, as in the ordinary state of the plant.
Here then we have an 
analogy to the circumstance of the lower part of a long panicle, for 
such an annual flowering shoot may be fairly considered, remaining 
till another year, and producing secondary ones; but I know of no in- 
stance of the stem of a raspberry producing the second year seconda- 
ry barren shoots, although I have little or no doubt that under certain 
circumstances it would do so.
There are always some buds lower 
than those which produce the flowering branches or panicles ; there 
can be no reason to doubt that these would produce sterile shoots if 
the upper part were prevented from blossoming, and thus prolong the 
lower part of the original shoot till a third year.
I have lately cut off" 
all the blossom-buds of several plants, to ascertain if in this second 
particular also, this species will bear out the analogy with the arch- 
ing forms.
Perhaps some other of the readers of the 'Phytologist' 
would do the same, and thus assist me in ascertaining this point.

On the Cerastium latifolium (Linn.) var.
Edmondsionii (Lond.
Cat.); 
and on the Seeds of Cerastium latifolium and C.
alpinum.
By 
Hewett C.
Watson, Esq., F.L.S., &c.
Mr. EdmondstOn has lately favoured me with two specimens of the 
Shetland plant which was described by that botanist as " a new Bri- 
tish Cerastium," (Phytol.
i. 497) ; and I have also seen others, which 
were sent to the Botanical Society.
These specimens entirely confirm 
me in the opinions which were expressed in the same volume of the 
' Phytologist,' in dissent from those entertained by Mr. Edmondston, 
namely, that the Shetland plant is an identical species with that 
of the Highland mountains, (Id. 586) ; and also that the Highland 
species is truly the C.
latifolium of the Linnean herbarium, (Id, 717); 
anything written by Mr. Bentham or Mr. Babingtoij notwithstanding.
Mr. Edmondston's specimens are distinguishable from my other wild 
specimens, by their shorter capsules and usually (not constantly) 
broader leaves ; which are the only characters to distinguish them, 
even as a mere variety, from the species of the Highland mountains.
These slight differences may have some connexion with the low ele- 
vation at which the Cerastium grows in Shetland, compared with its 
position on the mountains of Scotland.
Some of my garden speci- 
mens, dried the second year after the plants had been removed from 
the Grampians into the county of Surrey, scarcely differ from those of 
Shetland in length of capsule or breadth of leaves.
The seeds of Mr.
Edmondston's specimens con'espond with those of C.
latifolium, as 
described in the next paragraph.
While writing about the Shetland Cerastium, in the former volume 
of the ' Phytologist' (Id. 718), I mentioned incidentally that the seeds 
of these two species differed considerably; those of C.
latifolium be- 
ing smaller, darker and muricate; those of C.
alpinum larger, paler, 
and simply rugose.
On afterwards alluding to these two species, in 
the 'London Journal of Botany' (Feb. 1844), I expressed a suspicion 
that an accidental crossing of their names had occurred on the papers 
in which the seeds were folded.
This suspicion is confirmed by other 
seeds, collected in my garden last summer ; those of C.
alpinum (not 
latifolium) being smaller and muricate, as well as darker in their co- 
lour.
But I am not quite prepared to say that these differences can- 
not depend on the state of ripeness ; the seeds of C.
latifolium being 
less thoroughly ripened, and their skin being loose.
Would this loose 
skin have contracted in such manner as to produce the elevated points 
94 
or tubercles, at the same time lessening the apparent size of the seed?
It is to be wished that botanical tourists would compare the seeds of 
the wild plants.
If constant, the difference in their surfaces will af- 
ford a good character between species whose near resemblance has 
led to many errors.

Synonymes of CEnanihe peucedanifolia of Smith.
By Hewett C.
Watson, Esq., F.L.S., &c.
Since addressing to the ' Phytologist ' (ii.
11) some observations 
upon this and the allied species, I have seen an CEnanthe among 
Hohenacker's Caucasian specimens, in the possession of Dr. Charles 
Lemann, which I take to be identical with Smith's species, and which 
is labelled " silaifolia." Unfortunately, this specimen has only very 
immature fruit, and wants the radical leaves; but its close resemblance 
to the English examples, at an equal stage of growth, leaves little 
doubt of their specific identity.
Thus, if truly the "silaifolia" of Bie- 
berstein, we may believe Mr. Ball quite correct in applying the same 
name to the species described by Smith under that of " peucedanifo- 
lia." That the latter is really the species of Bieberstein, is rendered 
probable from the reference of that author to the figure in ' English 
Botany,' 348 ; although some words in his description of the plant do 
interpose a difficulty.
Moreover, Ledebour's diagnosis of Q5.
silaifo- 
lia, in 'Flora Rossica,' almost exactly identifies the plant of the Crimea 
with our English species â€” taking the fruit as described by myself, not 
as described by Smith (from a wrong species), or by Ball (from speci- 
mens too immature, and possibly belonging to Lachenalii).
It is like- 
ly that Ledebour fell into similar errors with the botanists of this 
country, and confused different species together.
In the first volume 
of the ' Flora Taurico-Caucasica,' he gives one species only, under the 
name of " pimpinelloides ; " though I suspect Lachenalii to be the 
species really intended.
In the Supplement to the same work, he 
added a second species, his silaifolia, referring to the description and 
fio-ure of Smith's peucedanifolia.
And now (1844), in the new ' Flora 
Rossica,' Ledebour describes three species as natives of the same dis- 
trict â€” Lachenalii, silaifolia and pimpinelloides.
I suppose, however, 
that the Caucasian Lachenalii and Taurian pimpinelloides may be 
identical ; as it does not appear that Ledebour had seen any example 
of Bieberstein's " pimpinelloides," and the short character and refe- 
95 
rence (to 'English Botany' 347) for the latter, seem to imply a misno- 
mer of Lachenalii.
I am disposed to believe that the CEnanthe in- 
crassans {Bory and Chauh.) is still only another name for the same 
species.
Assuming these ideas correct, the plant has been named 
successively, pimpinelloides, peucedanifolia, silaifolia, incrassans and 
Smithii, â€” without adding five other synonymes, which are given in 
Steudel's Nomenclator.

Notice of Gardiner'' s ' Botanical Rambles in Braemar in 1844.' 
Wm. Gardiner, Overgate, Dundee, 1845.
We have great pleasure in recommending this little pamphlet to the 
attention of our readers.
Such of them as have participated in Mr.
Gardiner's annual distributions of the gems of the Scottish Flora, will 
find in its pages a store of agreeable observations on the various inte- 
resting localities wherein those treasures have been collected : to such 
as have not hitherto made acquaintance with the author's valuable 
packets of plants, it vi'iW exhibit a pleasing picture of the botanical 
riches of a district abounding in scenery of the most splendid and ro- 
mantic character.
To the natural productions of one rich locality â€” 
the Sands of Barrie â€” Mr. Gardiner would gladly devote a separate 
treatise, provided he could obtain a sufficient number of subscribers 
to defray the expense of printing.
He also contemplates an exami- 
nation, during the coming season, of several localities not visited by 
him last year.
We heartily wish Mr. G.
every success in his literary 
and scientific labours.

BOTANICAL SOCIETY OF LONDON.
February 7, 1845.
Edward Doubleday, Esq., V.P., F.L.S., in the 
chair.
Mr. Edmondston presented specimens of the Shetland Ceras- 
tium, which occasioned some discussion among British botanists in 
the year 1843; Mr. E.
then describing the plant as "a new British 
Cerastium" (Phytol.
i. 497), identical with the Linnaean C.
latifolium, 
but distinct from the Welch and Highland species, described under 
that name in the works of Smith and other English authors.
Although 
differences of opinion were then stated respecting the Highland spe- 
cies, it seemed generally agreed that the Shetland plant was properly 
referred to the C.
latifolium of Linnaeus.
The specimens now pre- 
sented to the Society, howev^er, are labelled " Cerastium nigrescens, 
Edmond.
in Shetland Fl. ined.^'' It would thus seem that Mr. Ed- 
mondston has changed his opinion regarding its specific identity with 
the Linnaean species.
In the London Catalogue the plant is given 
as a variety (Edmondstonii) of Cerastium latifolium, {Linn.) ; but it 
may be doubted whether Mr. Edmondston's specimens can be distin- 
guished from the Highland and Linnaean C.
latifolium, even as a va- 
riety merely : there is certainly nothing in the form of the leaves to 
keep them distinct.
Mr. Edmondston also presented specimens of the Shetland Lathy- 
rus maritimus, which has been considered a different variety (acutifo- 
lius) from the same species found on the coasts of England.
Except 
in the more robust growth of the English specimens, there is little to 
distinguish those of Shetland from others collected in Suffolk by Mr.
D. Stock.
Far wider differences may be seen in the leaves of Orobus 
tuberosus, Vicia sativa, and others of our common Leguminosae.
Mr. Newnham presented specimens of Elatine Hydropiper and 
hexandra, from the lately discovered locality near Farnham, in Surrey.
Specimens of Lastraea spinosa [Newm.) were exhibited, which had 
been selected from a number of others collected by Mr. Jabez M.
Gibson, near Coggeshall, Essex.
Two of the specimens having been 
obligingly examined, and the correctness of the name certified, by 
Mr. Newman, the Herbarium Committee had resolved to send out si- 
milar examples in each parcel during the current year ; as the species 
usually is labelled " L.
dilatata^'' by many botanists.
In the London 
Catalogue, the name of "Roth'' is inadvertently given as the authority 
for Lastraea spinosa, (copied from the ' Phytologist,' i.
836) ; but since 
Roth described the plant under the generic name of Polystichum, Mr.
Newman is probably the first author who has applied Roth's specific 
name '^spinosum,''^ to the other generic name Lastraea.

Observations on the Genus Ruhus ; with a Notice of the Species ob- 
served during three days at Selborne.* By T.
Bell Salter, 
M.D., F.L.S.
(Continued from p.
92).
With that part of Mr. Lees' paper which has reference to the 
habits of Rubi, I fully accord, as the foregoing remarks sufficiently 
testify; but I must express myself as by no means coinciding with 
him in the remarks he makes, as to the extent to which those habits 
interfere with the generally received opinions of specific characters, 
I believe the only caution which becomes needful from this cause, is 
this, namely, not to look to small secondary barren shoots for the pro- 
per characters derived from this part of the plant, either in respect to 
its foliage, or the texture of its clothing, â€” these small shoots approx- 
imating in both particulars to those of the panicles.
Thus they are, 
generally, in those species in which the panicles are tomentose, much 
more hairy than the proper growing shoots, and the leaves are gene- 
rally much more simple.
The older the shrub, and the smaller these 
barren shoots, the more do they in these respects approach in foliage 
and clothing to the characters of the panicle.
And this remark does not apply to the barren shoots of the second 
or succeeding year's growth only, but also, in some degree, to acci- 
dental branching during the first year.
When a shoot meets with an 
accident to arrest its growth, it sends out many branches ; and if, at 
the time of the occurrence, it was in vigorous growth, except that the 
first few leaves are more simple, these branches have all the characters 
of the primary ban-en shoots.
If, however, these branchings take 
place later in the season, when the buds have been more matured, or 
* In the first volume of the ' Phytologist' (i.
1132) I contributed a notice of a visit 
to Selbome, under the title of " Three Days' Botanizing at Selborne," in which I 
made mention of those plants of interest which I there met with, excepting the bram- 
bles, which I was not then prepared to speak of.
The present notice of the Rubi 
found by me at that time, I had desired should have been considered as a continua- 
tion of that communication, and with the same title ; and accordingly I sent the first 
portion of this renewed account of the results of my visit, headed as before, â€” " Three 
Days' Botanizing at Selborne." I had, however, prefaced the remarks on the Sel- 
bome Rubi, with some general observations on the genus, and these attained so great 
a length, that there was not room in that number to come to the consideration of those 
plants from Selbome which had led to my communication.
On this account the Edi- 
tor changed my title to " Observations on the Genus Rubus." As regards that por- 
tion of my paper, this may be a more appropriate heading, but not so to the whole ; 
and therefore in the present and following parts, I restore a portion of my former title.

perhaps in consequence of being from biuls originally intended for 
the next year's flowering, these secondary branches have a different 
habit, and become modified like those mentioned above, though in a 
less degree.
A remarkable instance of this resemblance of habit in a secondary 
barren shoot to some of the characters of the panicle, is represented 
in one of the plates in the work of Weihe and Nees, in which the 
truthfulness of the artist is wonderfully shown, â€” there being no no- 
tice of the circumstance in the text of the work.
The sterile annual 
shoot of Rubus nitidus is bright and shining, but the panicle â€” though 
also with a shining rachis, and glabrous at the lower part â€” is hairy 
towards the summit.
Now when, from any cause, in this species 
there arise small secondary barren shoots, these have precisely the 
same kind of hairiness as that of the panicle, and this is the instance 
in the work oi Weihe and Nees to which I alluded.
In Tab. iv.
are 
represented a part of the vigorous growing shoot, quite glabrous, and 
one of these secondary ones ; and in this latter may be seen, very 
faithfully represented, the character now spoken of.
Important however as I admit Mr. Lees' communication to be, as 
respects the habits of these plants, and involving the necessity of cau- 
tion in the matter I have above mentioned, â€” to his further remarks, 
namely, the great modification of apparent specific character, I must 
take the most decided exception.
The first instance Mr. Lees addu- 
ces, is that of Rubus caesius becoming R.
dumetorum.
He states 
that " if it establish itself in a hedge, its leaves assume a firmer tex- 
ture, its flowers are larger and more showy, but its beautiful fruit be- 
comes of a dull purple, devoid of bloom or altogether abortive.
In 
this state the great German writers on Rubi have given it the name of 
dumetorum, though it is impossible, on strict examination, to avoid 
noticing every state between the creeping csesius and the erect dume- 
torum."* Mr. Lees is very explicit in speaking of the erect habit of 
the form he here calls dumetorum ; but on referring to the work of 
Weihe and Nees, so far from finding them describe dumetorum as 
erect, I find that in this respect the stems of both it and caesius are 
described in precisely the same words, "caule procumbente," yet Mr.
Lees is equally explicit in stating that the dumetorum in question is 
that of the " great German writers." In fact, without at all contest- 
ing the point whether Rubus caesius and R.
dumetorum may not each 
of them, while supported, become more erect, or at all events more

elevated, the latter, though stouter, is essentially as creeping a plant 
as the foitner, running along the ground, and rooting, not only from 
the terminal bud, but from others near it, as I had an opportunity of 
observing not many days since.
Again, in deriving, as Mr. Lees does, the R.
diversifolius of Lindley 
from caesius, there must also be some error.
He says, " it is an erect 
and more exposed form, stouter, and with a greater abundance of 
glandulosity." Mr. Lees is again very explicit in stating that it is the 
diversifolius of Lindley of which he speaks ; but on referring to this 
author's Synopsis, it will be found that so far from being " erect^'' Dr.
Lindley's plant is ^^ arched ;'''' and that so far from there being a 
^^ greater abundance of glandulosity^'' it is not even placed in the same 
section with the glandulose species, nor, in fact, is it at all a glandu- 
lose plant.
To this point, however, I shall have occasion to refer 
again, when speaking more particularly of the plants found at Sel- 
bome.
Of Mr. Lees' third instance I am equally sceptical ; but as I 
shall have occasion to speak of this also in my subsequent remarks on 
particular species, I will not here dwell upon it.
While on these general remarks, I would speak of one or two more 
points.
The effect of shade I believe to be, in general, to make the 
plants more upright.
With regard to hybridity, I believe, with Mr.
Lees, that there is no reason whatever for supposing it to occur.
I have dwelt much longer than I intended on the general habits of 
these plants ; and shall now proceed to refer more particularly to the 
specimens which have led me to make this communication, and once 
more turn my thoughts to the peaceful and picturesque retreats of the 
classic Selborne.
The nature and general aspect of this district I 
have endeavoured to make known, in some degree, in my former com- 
munication; and from what was then said of the nature of the locality, 
it will readily be believed that the forms of Rubi may be numerous.
With respect to my own expectations, they fell far short of my find- 
ings, a detail of which I now propose to offer to my fellow readers of 
the ' Phytologist ; ' and in proceeding to do so, I propose to follow 
the same plan as in my former notice, namely, first to give a list of 
the species, with their localities, and then make such general or spe- 
cial remarks on each, as may suggest themselves.

In the following observations I do not deem it needful to describe 
all the species and forms above enumerated, but shall refer to such 
descriptions in our standard Floras as I have found, on examination, 
to be most correct, pointing out any particulars in which 1 have come 
to a different conclusion, and noticing such prominent characters and 
habits as have appeared to me peculiarly to characterize certain forms.
And, as first on the list, I commence with â€” 
Rubus affinis (W.
& N.) Weihe and Nees von Esenbeck, who first 
described this species, enumerate several varieties, one of which is 
common in this country ; but the specimens which I obtained at Sel- 
borne, appear to come very near to what these authors consider the 
typical form, certainly much more nearly so than any I had previous- 
ly seen.
I have since, in Mr. Babington's collection, seen a very si- 
milar plant, which he had obtained at Jardine Hall, in Dumfriesshire, 
his specimen only differing from mine in being stouter, which was 
accounted for by its growing in a more exposed situation, â€” that at 
Selborne being in a thick shade.
Though this form of the species is rare in this country, one variety, 
namely, the var.
of Weihe and Nees, is an exceedingly common plant, 
a specimen of which, collected by Mr. Leighton, and authenticated 
by Nees von Esenbeck himself, I have seen in the collection of Mr.
Borrer.
It is this which Babington describes under this name in his 
Manual ; while Dr. Lindley's description, in the first edition of his 
Synopsis, condensed from that of Weihe and Nees, applies both to 
the variety now spoken of, and to the more normal form mentioned in 
the above list.
In his second edition.
Dr. Lindley evidently describes 
a wrong species under this name : the description is not very expli- 
cit, but probably refers to R.
plicatus, W.
et N.
101 
Not to attempt any elaborate settling of synonyraes in this notice, 
I may however add that the variety (7.
TV.
Sf N.) above spoken of, is 
evidently the R.
corylifolius of Borrer, and also of Arrhenius, whose 
description under this name differs from that of British authors, in 
describing the barren shoots as smooth instead of hairy.
A not very 
distinct subvariety of this same R.
affinis 7.
{W.
8f N.) is the second 
form of Leighton's R.
rhamnifolius, as 1 have seen by authentic spe- 
cimens in the herbarium of Mr. Babington.
His R.
affinis and " R.
rhamnifolius, second /ortn,^ therefore are only slightly varying forms 
of the same plants.
Presuming that the more common variety may be tolerably familiar, 
and for a description of which I have referred to the Manual of Ba- 
bington, I only add that the more normal form, mentioned in the Sel- 
borne list, differs from the common English form (7.
fV.
et N.) in the 
leaves being more flexible, less cuspidate and waved,* and the lower 
pair not overlapping.
Ruhus nitidus (W.
& N.), would appear, from the very numerous 
specimens 1 have seen in different herbaria, labelled with various 
names, to be both an exceedingly common species, and one very im- 
perfectly understood, or rather very generally misunderstood, being 
most commonly distributed under R.
suberectus, R.
plicatus and R.
rhamnifolius.
The description in the first edition of Lindley's Synop- 
sis is very characteristic ; yet it is very remarkable that Professor 
Lindley himself observes in that edition, that it is only introduced on 
the authority of Smith.
It is yet further remarkable, that though Sir 
James Smith had certainly seen the plant, as 1 have been able to ve- 
rify from Mr. Borrer's collection, his description is evidently drawn 
up from another species â€” R.
cordifolius {W.
8f N.) Notwithstanding 
its extreme frequency, and that attention was so early directed to it, 
it yet neither appears in Hooker's Flora, Babington's nor Macreight's 
Manuals, nor Leighton's Shropshire Flora ; and Professor Lindley, 
who had distinguished it in his first edition, in his second confounds 
it with R.
plicatus, under the misnomer of R.
affinis above mentioned.
As the misunderstanding of this species appears to be so universal, 
I shall make some rather particular observations on its habits, as well 
as mention those points by which it may readily be distinguished 
from the species with which it is apt to be confounded.
* Mr. Babington does not describe the leaves as waved, which however I find in- 
variably to be the case in the variety which he describes, â€” that with the lower leaves 
overlapping.
102 
The plant is remarkable for the bright varnished appearance of its 
angular stem^ which at first is very generally erect, or very nearly so, 
and is arrested in its growth quite early in the season.
When the 
light is deficient, here it pauses, and thus remains as a suberect spe- 
cies ; * but where it has a full exposure, towards autumn it either 
makes secondary branches, or the shoot becomes lengthened, and 
finally roots ; but whether rooting or not, it is always suberect in the 
first instance, and not truly arching, thus holding an intermediate 
habit between the suberect and arching forms.
There are very gene- 
rally a few scattered hairs on the barren shoots, near the attachment 
of the leaves.
These are long and spreading, but so few as not to 
take from the polished appearance of the surface.
The prickles have 
a broad base, are tapering, straight and deflected.
The leaves are 
quinate, remarkably flat, bright green and shining above,t less so but 
not white beneath, with a pubescence of a few long scattered hairs ; 
the leajiels are narrow ovate, pointed, the lower pair small, and al- 
ways much directed backwards, â€” not recurved, but directed back- 
wards in the plane of the leaf.
The panicle is compound and leafy ; 
the rachis polished, but with a pubescence of loose scattered hairs, 
confined to the summit of the panicle.
There are generally present 
some short barren shoots, which are pubescent in the manner de- 
scribed in the observations made above, when speaking on the habits 
of the genus.
In these shoots, and on the panicles, when the leaves 
become ternate, the backward direction of the larger outer lobes of 
the lateral leaflets, â€” â–  answering to the posterior leaflets of the quinate 
leaves, â€” is very remarkable.
This is excellently represented in the 
figure of Weihe and Nees-t 
The names under which, in this country, this species has been con- 
founded, are R.
suberectus, R.
plicatus, R.
rhamnifolius and R.
affinis, 
from all which it may be distinguished by the compound leafy pani- 
cle ; from R.
suberectus [And.) and R.
plicatus [W.
8s N.) by the 
larger size of the prickles, which are very small, and with a slender 
base in both these species ; and also by the leaflets not being sessile 
* Weihe and Nees mention the same variety of habit.
They observe, " Species 
hsBC, quae leliquis suae cognationis semper exilior, ubi nutrimentum deest, fere evecta 
crescit." â€” Rubi Germ.
p. 21.
As mentioned in the text, I have generally observed a 
deficiency of light, rather than of nutriment, to determine this difference.
f I borrow this part of the description from that of Mertens and Koch, which 
agree so accurately with our plant, that there cannot be the shadow of a doubt as to 
its identity with their R.
nitidus.

and overlapping, and by the plant not being always suberect in its 
growth; still further from R.
suberectus, by the red fruit of that spe- 
cies, and from R..
plicatus by the absence of the cuspidate point and 
the plicate folding of the leaflets, and by the long generally simple 
peduncles of the leafless panicle â€” characters so very remarkable in 
that species.
From R.
cordifolius ( W.
8f N.),* by which I under- 
stand the R.
rhamnifolius of Lindley, it is distinguished by that spe- 
cies being arched or prostrate instead of suberect, having large hooked 
prickles, and a long contracted tomentose panicle, in form resembling 
that of R.
leucostachys, {Sm.) Lastly, it is distinguished from R.
affinis {W.
<^ A''.), by the round, arching, or prostrate stem and over- 
lapping leaflets of that species, which also are generally rugose or 
crisped, or both.
The next species in the list is Ruhus discolor (W.
& N.), which, 
although spoken of as not so common at Selborne, is of all British 
natives by far the commonest English species.
It is hitherto most 
familiarly recognized in this country as the R.
fruticosus, this being 
the name by which it is excellently figured in ' English Botany,' and 
by which it is described in (I believe) all our British Floras, except 
the first edition of Lindley 's Synopsis.
The objections to retaining 
the name oi fruticosus to this species, are, that it is perfectly doubt- 
ful to what plant Linnaeus intended the name to be given ; as I am 
informed by my friend Mr. Borrer, who has examined the authentic 
* By R.
cordifolius {W.
^ N.) mentioned above, I observe that I designate the R.
rhamnifolius of Lindley.
I say of Lindley, for really it is diiEcult or impossible to 
ascertain what many of our authors intend by this name.
One thing at least is very 
evident, namely, that it has been much confused, and that not only by different indi- 
viduals applying the name differently, but also in some cases by the same writer evi- 
dently including more than one species.
It is evident that both Smith and Bon'er, if 
not Babington also, include the subject of the text above â€” R.
nitidus â€” under the 
name of R.
rhamnifolius, and that, notwithstanding one of these authors â€” Sir James 
Smith â€” did introduce the name of nitidus into his Flora.
His description under that 
name by no means agrees with the plant itself.
That R.
cordifolius {W.
Sr N.) and R.
rhamnifolius {W.
^ N.), are slightly vary- 
ing forms of one and the same plant, is an opinion I hold very strongly in common 
with Mr. Boner and Mr. Babington, as well as Dr. Lindley.
Instead however of ta- 
king that one of these two names for the species which these authors have chosen, I 
have adopted, in my own herbarium, that of R.
cordifolius, and for the following rea- 
sons.
As regards antiquity, I believe they both have equal claims, while on the one 
hand cordifplius is a name which is very characteristic of the species, and is not con- 
founded with others, and on the other, rhamnifolius is by no means characteristic, and 
has been confusedly applied to so many forms that it ceases to convey any very defi- 
nite idea of what may be intended.
104 
Linnaean specimen, that it was made up of portions of several species, 
one of which is the R.
plicatus ( W.
8^ N.), to which, in the very coun- 
try of Linnaeus, concluding it to be the one intended by the great 
author himself, Arrhenius now applies the name in his excellent Mo- 
nograph of the Rubi of Sweden.
The numbers of other species to 
which the name has been applied, are beyond enumeration ; from 
this circumstance, and the indefinite and inconclusive manner in 
which the very author of it applied the name, it ceases to be one of 
any distinctness or authority whatever.
In applying the name of R.
discolor [W.
Sf N.), by which I now 
enumerate my Selborne specimens, to the R.
fruticosus of ' English 
Botany,' and other British works, I have the concurrence of Mr. Bor- 
rer, and also that of Mr. Babington, notwithstanding that the latter 
gentleman had adopted the name o^ fruticosus in his Manual.
With respect to the character and habit of the ordinary forms of 
this bramble, I need add nothing.
The figure in ' English Botany,' 
and the descriptions in Hooker's and Babington's Floi'as, under the 
name of R.
fruticosus, are abundantly characteristic : and with respect 
to its habit, 1 refer to my observations made above.
When speaking 
of the habits of Rubi, I more particularly took this species as the type.
The variety mentioned in the list as var.
thyrsoideus of this species, 
is distinguished from the ordinary form of R.
discolor, by the absence 
of silkiness on the barren shoot, which is less angular, and frequently 
of very nearly suberect growth, whereby it approaches somewhat to 
R. nitidus in habit, from which, however, it is readily distinguishable 
by the more simple and leafless panicle, and the absence of the loose 
hairs â€” the only hairiness in this being a short slight tomentum to- 
wards the top of the panicle, which is less prickly, and bearing paler 
flowers, than in the ordinary discolor.
This form is retained as a separate species by Weihe and Nees, 
being considered by them to be the Linnaean fruticosus,* under which 
name they describe and figure it.
We find it, too, retained as a spe- 
cies by Arrhenius, in his Monograph, but not as fruticosus, a name 
which he applies to R.
plicatus, but under the name of R.
thyrsoideus 
{Wimrri).
By this latter name T propose to designate it as a variety, 
it being evidently osculant with the ordinary R.
discolor.
It is how- 
* The description in ' English Flora ' admits of the idea that Smith may have in- 
cluded this variety under his /ntiicosjw.

Leighton, in his Shrop- 
shire Flora, describes a fruticosus as well as discolor, which, though evidently a mere 
variety of the latter, is not the one here spoken of.

ever a very pretty variety, with its shrubby terete and vaniished stems, 
seldom growing so large as the common form.
Ruhus leucostachys (Sm.), is one of the commonest species about 
Selborne, and is certainly one of the best fruited of our brambles.
It 
is now so generally and correctly distinguished from its allies, and the 
descriptions in our Floras are now so generally characteristic, that it 
requires few words of notice in this place.
It may be well to men- 
tion however that there appears little doubt of its being the species 
figured and described by Weihe and Nees as R.
pubescens,* the otily 
difference being, that in our British specimens, the leaves are fre- 
quently rather more deeply and sharply serrated.
In other respects, 
both the figure and description of these authors admirably agree with 
our plant, as does also the description of Mertens and Koch,t thus 
still further identifying our R.
leucostachys to be the German R.
pu- 
bescens.
The vernacular German name given to this bramble, viz., 
Weichhaariger Bromheerstrauch X (weak-haired bramble), is peculi- 
arly appropriate.
But though the typical form of this plant need not detain us long, 
there is a certain state of it on which I would make some observations.
It is a form which I have enumerated in the list as the variety vestitus 
of this species, by which I intend to discriminate a most remarkable 
form, respecting which there has been much diversity of opinion.
The form in question is characterized principally by remarkably round 
leaflets, an almost suberect growth,Â§ and a very shaggy clothing of 
soft white hairs.
That this is the form described as diversifolius by 
Lindley, I have had an opportunity of verifying by a specimen in the 
collection of Mr. Borrer, which he had from Dr. Lindley's own plant 
in the Horticultural Society's gardens ; and that it is the vestitus of 
Weihe and Nees is equally clear, from the circumstance that their 
figure and description accurately agree with the description of Lind- 
ley, and with the specimen from his own plant which I had the above 
* Bubi Germanici, p.
42, and tab.

499.
X Ibid, and Deutchen Brombeerstrauche von Weihe und Nees, p.

Â§ The almost suberect growth in this instance may perhaps require some explana- 
tion.
It is in fact a truly arching form, as described by Lindley, but from the effect 
of shade â€” an effect before alluded to, it assumes a higher arch than the exposed form 
of leucostachys.
This approach to a suberect growth is totally different from that 
spoken of under R.
nitidus, which is first suberect, and only roots afterwards by a dis- 
tinct secondary growth.
In the form now treated of, the arch, though high, is per- 
fectly continuous.

mentioned opportunity of examining.
Dr. Lindley's description of 
this plant is so characteristic, that I feel I have no occasion to de- 
scribe it, but would only refer to his Synopsis.
The point respecting 
this form of bramble on which I feel myself called upon to speak par- 
ticularly, is the question as to what is its true position with regard to 
its affinity or distinctness ; and whether it should hold the rank of a 
variety.
On first observing it myself, which was in the Isle of Wight, in 
1843, I not only considered it distinct from any other species I had 
seen before, but imagined I had discovered something altogether new; 
and from memoranda accompanying various other specimens of it 
which I have seen in different herbaria, I find that others â€” no doubt 
struck, like myself, by its very remarkable appearance â€” have had the 
same impression.
It was Mr. Borrer who first suggested to me the 
opinion that it was the R.
diversifolius of Lindley, and only a variety 
of R.
leucostachys.
Dr. Lindley's reply to this opinion is so remark- 
able, that I may be allowed to quote it.
He observes : " Mr. Borrer 
combines this with R.
leucostachys, from which it is surely a hundred 
times more different than leucostachys from fruticosus, the distinct- 
ness of which he admits."* In this opinion I perfectly accord with 
Dr. Lindley, as far as regards the mere point of difference in external 
form, and yet, as to specific identity, I am compelled to accord with 
the opinion of Mr. Borrer.
The form of which we are speaking is essentially dependent on si- 
tuation, being the result of diminished light ; for in the shady wooded 
districts of Selbome, this vaiiety abounds, and in all the sunny expo- 
sures we have the correct or typical leucostachys, while every grada- 
tion may be seen in intermediate situations.
The same fact I have 
seen times innumerable in the Isle of Wight, and even the specimen 
in Mr. Borrer's collection, from Dr. Lindley's authentic plant, was 
already somewhat modified by the change of situation.
With respect to the Rubus vestitus of Weihe and Nees, it is not a 
little remarkable that they should have placed it in the glandulose 
section of the genus, while the artist â€” and I have had occasion before 
to notice the accuracy of the artist, independently of the description 
of the authors â€” does not represent a single gland ; and even the au- 
thors themselves, in describing the number and arrangement of the 
glands on the panicles, a part of the plant on which they are apt to 
occur occasionally, even in the species of the other sections, are com- 
* Lindley's Synopsis, 2nd edition, p.
94.
107 
pelled to admit them to be "rarce.'" A moment's glance at their figure 
is sufficient to show that it has no affinity whatever with those species 
amongst which they have arranged it ; whereas the form and nature 
of the prickles, and the nature of the hairiness, at once associate it 
with their R.
pubescens.
Concluding therefore that the R.
diversifolius of Lindley and R.
vestitus of Weihe and Nees are identical forms, and only a variety of 
R. leucostachys, it remained to choose by which name to designate 
the variety.
I have adopted that of Weihe and Nees, they having 
noticed it anteriorly to Dr. Lindley ; though certainly the epithet of 
rotundifolius, by which I had proposed in my own mind to call the 
then supposed new species, when the variety first came under my no- 
tice, would be a far more characteristic name than either of the above.
I have received two specimens of this variety from the Botanical 
Society of London ; one, collected in Shropshire, under the name of 
R. villicaulis ; and the other from Worcestershire, by that of R.
Ra- 
dula â€” Ruhus Radula without a gland or a seta !
With respect to Mr. Lees' opinion that R.
diversifolius is a form 
deducible from R.
caesius, inasmuch as he mistakes Lindley's plant, 
considering it to be one with "abundance of glandulosity," * whereas 
the author of the (supposed) species describes it as without glands, â€” 
the conclusion of course falls to the ground.
Ruhus carpinifolius (W.
& N.) is one of the most remarkable and 
beautiful of our British Rubi ; varying considerably according to the 
situation in which it grows, and seeming to be generally not very well 
understood : on which account I deem it necessary to give a rather 
particular description of it.
The mode of growth of the barren shoot is very similar to that 
described of R.
nitidus ( W.
8^ N.), being at first suberect, in which 
condition it fi-equently remains, and also, when it does root, it is by 
secondary growth after a temporary pause.
It is therefore not truly 
an arching species, though ranged with them.
The stem is angular 
and hairy, the hairs straight and spreading, and very apt to disappear 
in drying.
The prickles are very long, straight, and slightly deflect- 
ed.
The leaves are quinate ; leajiets narrow, variously serrated, but 
the serratures very acute and remarkably directed forwards.
The 
panicle is variable as to its branching, but narrow and very generally 
leafless ; the rachis is hairy, with a few glands occasionally.
The ascending growth, the angular stem with hairs and no glands,

and the narrow leaflets, with their acute serratures, will generally suf- 
ficiently mark this species.
Weihe and Nees, the authors of this species, describe two varieties, 
one with white flowers and thick leaves, the other with red flowers 
and more flaccid leaves.
The latter is indeed an extremely beautiful 
plant, with bright shining leaves and brilliant red flowers.
It is in 
this variety that a few glands occasionally occur on the panicle.
The 
two forms are, however, evidently osculant, and our Selborne plant 
holds this intermediate station.

On the Theory of'"'' Progressive Development^'' applied in explanation 
of the Origin and Transmutation of Species.
By Hewett C.
Watson, Esq., F.L.S.
British botanists, with some few honourable exceptions, would 
appear to entertain very limited ideas regarding the scope and objects 
of the science to which their attention is directed.
The majority are 
content to acquire a moderate knowledge of plants and their names, 
or of the physical characters of parts (shape, proportion, colour &c.) 
in which their resemblances and differences may be detected.
In it- 
self this is doubtless an agreeable kind of study; and it is one, more- 
over, which so lightly taxes the mind, as to be within the grasp of 
moderate capacities ; for even children can learn Botany thus far.
But scarcely any exercise or stimulus is here given to those higher 
intellectual attributes of man, which are concerned in all trains of rea- 
soning, and which lead to the knowledge of causation and depen- 
dance between the phenomena of creation.
The study of plants, 
simply as physical existences, and of their resemblances and differ- 
ences, on which technical classifications are founded, is an exercise 
of the same mental faculties which give origin to the restless and pry- 
ing curiosity of the monkey.
So far, the botanist is an intellectual 
Simla.
He advances a step further, when he uses names and terms 
to express these existences and their similitudes or distinctions.
And 
he ascends successively still higher in the intellectual scale, as the 
scope of his studies extends over the vital actions of plants â€” the in- 
fluence of external agencies upon their growth and health â€” their 
relations to the rest of creation â€” and the mode, or laws, by which the 
present vegetation of the earth's surface has been substituted in place 
of a past vegetation, which was greatly dissimilar to that now seen 
around us.
109 
In this present communication, it is my wish to make some remarks 
on the last of these subjects.
Public attention has been lately direct- 
ed to that subject, by a volume of considerable merit, published ano- 
nymously, under the title of 'Vestiges of the Natural History of 
Creation.' There is little, very little, of novelty in the book ; yet it 
will probably make the subject more popular, more talked about, and 
even more thought about, than any previously published work has 
done.
The ' Vestiges ' has exactly the character and qualities which 
are required in a really " popular work." The style is remarkably 
good and readable â€” the subject is great and interesting â€” the illustra- 
tions are mostly found in those facts which have been made familiar 
by public lectures and elementary works â€” the leading argument of 
the whole volume, " progressive development," is single, and it is sel- 
dom lost sight of by digressions â€” plausibility is sought, and carried 
even to case-pleading, rather than any critical balancing of pros and 
cons â€” the reasoning is obvious and direct, leaning more to the super- 
ficial than to the profound.
Thus, the reader finds himself interested 
and drawn onward ; his mind is neither wearied by dulness, nor ex- 
hausted by any serious tax on its powers ; he believes that he sees 
the whole argument or theory clearly made out and established ; and 
he is self-flattered by the supposition of having thus easily acquired a 
new and important truth, 
I allude here, of course, to the " general " reader, who is conversant 
with the natural sciences to that limited extent which may now be 
easily attained by attending lectures at a ' Literary, and Scientific In- 
stitution,' or by the perusal of elementary treatises and other books 
expressly written for general readers.
The judgment of those who 
have more thoroughly trained themselves in scientific investigation, 
will not be quite so favourable ; although they may pronounce the 
work to be one of high merit in its class â€” namely, the class of " po- 
pular works." The pretensions to originality, and the success of the 
argument or evidences, will scarcely be acknowledged by parties who 
possess a sufficient knowledge of the natural sciences, to render their 
judgment worthy of much respect.
Still, we may allow that the au- 
thor has embodied an idea, not new in itself, in a more substantial- 
looking form than it had previously assumed ; while he has also given 
a fi-eshness and fulness to his principle, by tracing its application 
through many departments of science, and making each yield illus- 
tration or evidence in support of the theory.
The author's idea is, that in all departments of Nature â€” from the 
origin of a planet or a whole solar system, down to the production of 
110 
a plant or animal, or any part of a plant or animal â€” there are such 
evident signs and proofs of a gradual and progressive development, 
that we may believe this to have been an original principle, or a law 
impressed in the constitution of our universe and of the beings by 
which it is peopled.
He first takes up the condition of the solar sys- 
tem, before the formation of the planets, and traces the change of ne- 
bulous matter into the sun and its planetary satellites ; all vehich, of 
course, is purely hypothetical.
In reading the past history of the earth, as unfolded to us by the 
researches of geologists, we rest upon grounds that are something 
more than hypothetical.
It may be held a truth, inferred from suffi- 
cient premises, that the earth has undergone great changes, in the 
transition from its past to its present condition.
There can be no 
doubt that the earth was formerly inhabited by plants and animals 
widely different from those at present existing upon it.
It is proba- 
ble, almost to certainty, that in the earlier condition of the globe, its 
plants and animals were those of a simpler (" lower ") organization, 
than some of the others which followed them ; although always, even 
to the present times, animals and plants of an equally simple organi- 
zation existed in abundance, along with those of a more complex 
("higher") organization.
Such changes were apparently progressive, 
proceeding generally from the simpler towards the more complex 
types of structure : invertebrate animals preceding the vertebrate ; 
fishes and reptiles preceding birds and beasts ; cryptogamic plants 
preceding phanerogamic.
A question naturally arises in any thoughtful mind, while contem- 
plating these facts in their stony or earthy records, how plants and 
animals were first called into being, and by what means the later spe- 
cies were substituted in room of the earlier species ?
It has been re- 
peatedly suggested, that one or more species may have first emanated 
from inorganic matter, and that succeeding species may have been 
formed by mutation or metamorphose of the preceding species.
This 
hypothesis is plausible, to say the least of it.
If adopted as a true 
theory, it would account for much that is at present obscure or in- 
comprehensible.
It receives strong analogical support in those meta- 
morphoses which are well known to take place during the progressive 
development of individual plants and young animals.
And there are, 
moreover, some facts which bear so decidedly on the subject, as to 
assume almost the character of direct evidence in confirmation of the 
theory.
Ill 
On the other side, it must be admitted, when our attention is limit- 
ed to the plants and animals now existing upon the earth, that much 
more prima facie evidence is found to countenance a belief in the 
permanent distinctness of species ; and that, consequently, the great 
majority of naturalists do steadfastly hold to this belief And we may 
likewise say confidently, that all the clearest, most readily tested facts, 
directly tend to confirm the axiom of " omne ex ovo." 
Against these admissions, it may be fairly contended, that the for- 
mation of a plant or animal, from unorganized matter, could only be 
expected in the case of very small and very simply organized species; 
and that it is precisely in these cases we find the doctrine of " ottme 
ex ovo " to be itself incapable of proof.
And as to the metamorphose 
of one species into another, it must be remembered, that the very de- 
finition of " species " comes in the form of a petitio principii ; since 
the widest change ever seen, in the descendants of any plant or ani- 
mal, would only entitle them to the name of " variety," according to 
recognized usage in the application of these terms.
The author of the Vestiges pleads the case of the minority ; and I 
will now quote his views, as briefly as possible, in his own words ; 
strongly recommending his whole volume to the attentive perusal of 
phytologists.
" The nucleated vesicle, the fundamental form of all organization, 
we must regard as the meeting-point between the inorganic and the 
organic â€” the end of the mineral and beginning of the animal king- 
doms, which thence start in different directions, but in perfect parel- 
lelism and analogy.
We have already seen that this nucleated vesicle 
is itself a type of mature and independent being in the infusory ani- 
malcules, as well as the starting point of the foetal progress of every 
higher individual in creation, both animal and vegetable.
We have 
seen that it is a form of being which electric agency will produce â€” 
though not perhaps usher into full life â€” in albumen, one of those 
compound elements of animal bodies, of which another (urea) has 
been made by artificial means.
Remembering these things, we are 
drawn on to the supposition, that the first step in the creation of life 
upon this planet was a chemico-electric operation ^ hy which simple 
germinal vesicles were produced.
This is so much, but what are the 
next steps ?
Let a common vegetable infusion help us to answer.
There, as we have seen, simple forms are produced at first, but after- 
wards they become more complicated, until at length the life-produ- 
cing powers of the infusion are exhausted.
Are we to presume that, 
in this case, the simple engender the complicated ?
" * * * 
112 
" I suggest, then, as an hyjiothesis already countenanced by raucli 
that is ascertained, and Hkely to be further sanctioned by much that 
remains to be known, that the first [second ?] step was an advance 
under f avow of peculiar conditions^ from the simplest forms of being 
to the next more complicated, and this through the medium of the 
ordinary process of generation.'''' â€” pp.
204, 205.
" The idea, then, that I form of the progress of organic life upon the 
globe, is, that the simplest and most primitive type, under a law to 
which that of like-production is subordinate, gave birth to the type 
next above it, that this again produced the next higher, and so on to 
the very highest, the stages of advance being in all cases very small â€” 
namely, from one species only to another ; so that the phenomenon 
has always been of a simple and modest character." â€” p.
222.
The author of these passages would seem to be slenderly acquaint- 
ed with Zoology, and still less conversant with Botany.
He has thus 
written under considerable disadvantages ; for it is to these sciences 
he must turn in search of facts which bear upon the transmutation of 
one species into another, or the production of one species from ano- 
ther different one.
Our concern is with matters botanical ; and we 
cannot compliment the author, on the value of his botanical eviden- 
ces, which are here copied in his own words.
" It appears that, whenever oats sown at the usual time are kept 
cropped down during summer and autumn, and allowed to remain 
over the winter, a thin crop of rye is the harvest presented at the close 
of the ensuing summer.
This experiment has been tried repeatedly, 
with but one result ; invariably the Secale cereale is the crop reaped 
where the Avena saliva, a recognized different species, was sown." 
* * " Perhaps those curious facts that have been stated with 
regard to forests of one kind of trees, when burnt down, being suc- 
ceeded (without planting) by other kinds, may yet be found most ex- 
plicable, as this is, upon the hypothesis of a progression of species 
which takes place under certain favouring conditions, now apparently 
of rare occurrence." â€” p.
221.
Assuming these to be veritable facts, it may be suggested to the 
author, that they overprove his theory.
The change of the oat into 
rye, is a pretty wide generic leap.
And I am not at all aware that a 
burnt forest is forthwith succeeded by trees nearest allied, in specific 
or generic characters, to those which have been destroyed.
The phe- 
nomena are here scarcely those of " a simple and modest character," 
or an advance " from one species only to another." Had we been 
told that the Avena strigosa could be so converted into the Avena 
113 
sativa, or that a bunit forest of Tilia parvifolia would be succeeded by 
another of Tilia europtea, the changes would have corresponded bet- 
ter with the theory.
In a future communication, I will try whether 
Botany cannot yield some facts more applicable as tests of this the- 
ory.
Meantime we may leave it an " open question," which is not to 
be answered in the negative too hastily.

On the proposed Chatige of Name in Lastraa recurva.
By William Wilson, Esq.
With all deference to those who propose a change in the name of 
Lastraea recvuva, I must say that I see no reason whatever for dis- 
carding it : on the contrary, I think it very apt and expressive, and 
in perfect harmony with the use of the term in other cases.

On the name of Lastrcea recurva.
By Charles C.
Babington, Esq., 
M.A., F.L.S., &c.
As in a recent number of the ' Phytologist ' Mr. Newman has taken 
upon himself to express his belief that I am the author of the review 
of his 'History of British Ferns' in the 'Annals of Natural History,' 
(Phytol.
ii.
26) ; and as, in the point now to be noticed, I fully agree 
in the opinion there expressed ; I take the liberty of replying to the 
article by Mr. Bree in the last ' Phytologist,' (Id. 75).
My idea of the botanical meaning of the word recurvus is derived 
from the uses to which it is applied by the best botanists.
For in- 
stance : Smith sa^'s " recurva or rejlexa, curved backwards," (Intr.
to 
Bot. 118.).
De Candolle, ^^ Recurvus, recurvatus, reflexus, reflechi, 
courbe ou flechi en dehors," (Theor.
Elem.
478).
Bischoff, " recur- 
vatus und recurvus, zuruckgekriimmt, answarts oder ab wartsge- 
kriimmt," (Worterbuch der beschreibenden Botanik,' 170).

^^ recurvatum folium.
A reciu*ved leaf.
Deorsum flexura, ut arcus 
superiora spectet.
[Linn.] Delin.
PL â€” Bent, or rather bowed or 
curved downwards, so that the bow or convexity is upwards," (Lan- 
guage of Botany).
Bertolini, â€” ^^ recurvata, deorsum flexa, curva, ut 
convexitas arcus superiora spectet," (Praelectiones Rei Herbarise, 274).
Q 
114 
1 think it will be allowed that sufficient evidence is produced to 
justify the observations of the reviewer, on the improper use of the 
term recurva, as applied to the plant denominated " Bree's Fern " by 
Newman.
Linnasus, Smith, De Candolle, Bertolini and BischofF 
agree in applying the term to a curvature of which the convexity is 
upwards, not downwards, as is the case in L.
recurva.
It would undoubtedly afford me much satisfaction to get rid of that 
name, but I fear it would now be difficult to do so, as it has been twice 
employed in descriptive works, namely, in the ' Naturalist's Alma- 
nack ' for 1844, and Newman's Ferns.
1 have always protested very 
strongly against this name, and carefully avoided its use when distri- 
buting specimens of the plant several years since, as the var.
conca- 
vum of Aspidiurn dilatatum.
Mr. Newman's observation (Hist.
Ferns, 
235) that 1 assured him that 1 had not proposed the name, is not, 
therefore, exactly correct.
All I stated to him was, that it had not 
been used by me in print, and therefore had no claim to priority over 
any printed name.
I am quite ready to agree with Mr. Bree that the term dumetorum 
is not much better than recurva ; still, it is better, since it does not 
convey an absolutely erroneous impression concerning the form and 
structure of the plant.
It is only as being an older name, even as ap- 
plied by Mackay to this plant, that I am inclined to employ it, in order 
to get rid of a term which seems so objectionable.
Smith's A.
dume- 
torum apparently falls, his specimens being only a diseased or dwarf 
state of L.
multiflora.
L. incurva would undoubtedly be a satisfactory name, if it could 
be generally adopted.
Perhaps the readers of the ' Phytologist ' will 
give their opinions as to its adoption.
I must confess, however, that 
my pet name is con cava, as might perhaps be expected, from my hav- 
ing long made use of it.

The word recurvus, as applied in Entomology.
By Edward Newman.
Mr. Bree has, I think, shown us (Phytol.
ii.
75) that ornitholo- 
gists understand the word recurvus or recurved as implying turned 
outwards and upwards, like the bill of the avocet.
In this he is per- 
fectly correct : but as every sound argument strengthens a good cause, 
I may perhaps be allowed to add support from the sister science of 
Entomology, of which I was once an enamoured student.
The fol- 
115 
lowing authors apply the word recurvus to the points of the antennae, 
the margins of the prothorax, the margins of the elytra, or the extre- 
mity of the abdomen in insects.
Linneus, Fabricius, Gyllenhall, 
Schonherr, Erichson, Dalman, Burmeister, Kirby, MacLeay, â€” all so 
apply it ; and there is no instance within my knowledge of any other 
meaning being intended by these, or by any other entomological 
writers, than the following, â€” curved outwards and upwards, as in 
the margins of the divisions of the frond ifi Lastrcea recurva.
But we need not content ourselves with the universal application 
of the word, although that is strong evidence ; let us turn to its mean- 
ing as explained in the elaborate work of Kirby and Spence.
We 
find at p.
327 of their fourth volume, â€” " Recurved {Recurvce), when 
they curve upwardsy No doubt is expressed : no second meaning 
given.
Indeed, it may be stated, that the application of any other 
meaning to the word recurvus than that in which Mr. Bree has used 
it, would falsify every entomological description in which the word 
occurs.
Having the universal usage of two sciences in his favour, I trust 
Mr. Bree will never think of abandoning the name he has proposed 
for this beautiful fern, the distinguishing of which, at a time when 
ferns were so little known, does him the greatest credit.
It may be shown that in Botany the word has been used in two 
senses, but Prof.
Lindley, our best botanical orismologist, restricts 
its meaning to that intended by Mr. Bree.

On the occurrence of Cnicus oleraceus in Lincolnshire.
By Edward Edwards, Esq.
Having read Dr. Bromfield's communication respecting this thistle, 
as a British species (Phytol.
ii.
53), I beg to mention that I possess a 
specimen of the plant in question, gathered as wild in Lincolnshire 
by the late Mr. Cole, of Bourne, about 1823.
The plant was then to 
be observed by the side of the road between Market Deeping and 
Croyland, a most dreary route among fen levels ; but the direct way 
passed by antiquarian visitors from Deeping, desiring to see the ruins 
of the once famous abbey at Croyland.

Correction of an Error in the ' Notes on the Species of CEnauthe.^ 
By J.
S. Mill, Esq.
Since my note on the species of CEnanthe was printed (Phytol.
ii.
48), my specimens from Battersea, Weybridge and Seaford have had 
the advantage of being examined by Mr. Watson.
That gentleman 
confirms my statement respecting the Battersea and Weybridge 
plants, which he decides to be his GEnanthe Smithii, the peuceda- 
nifolia of Smith.
The plant from Seaford, which I had classed as the 
pimpinelloides, he pronounces to be Qinanthe Lachenalii ; and he 
has fully satisfied me, both by his high authority, and by a compari- 
son of specimens with which he has most courteously supplied me, 
that 1 was previously unacquainted with the true Q^.
pimpinelloides.

On the Yellow Juice of CEnanthe crocata.
By T.
Bell Salter, 
M.D., F.L.S.
In the last number of the ' Phytologist,' my friend Dr. Balfour ob- 
serves, that in cutting across the root of CEnanthe crocata, there is 
no appearance of a yellow juice ; but that after a short exposure to 
the air, it assumes a yellowish or brownish tint (Phytol.
ii.
87).
This 
assertion requires some limitation.
As the plant occurs in the Isle 
of Wight, where it is quite common, the juice can scarcely be said to 
become yellow at all ; while in the specimens which grow about Poole, 
the juice, not only of the root, but of the whole plant, is of a bright 
yellow, the moment it is broken or cut.
It is darker after exposure, 
but is of considerable depth of colour the moment it is exposed.
I have little doubt that this variety with the dark juice is the most 
virulent state of the plant, having a distinct recollection of an acci- 
dent which occurred to a man at Poole about fifteen years since, in 
consequence of taking a decoction of it for some skin-disease.
Death 
was produced, certainly within two hours.

' Description of the Female Flower and Fruit of Rafflesia Anioldi, 
with Remarks on its Affinities ; and an Illustration of the Structure

The principal object of this paper is to complete, as far as possi- 
ble, the author's "history of Rafilesia Arnoldi, the male, flower of 
which is described and figured in the 13th volume of the Society's 
Transactions." In a well-mei'ited tribute to the memory of two emi- 
nent men, the author thus speaks of the exceedingly beautiful struc- 
tural illustrations which accompany this paper.
" The figures of 
Rafilesia and Hydnora, which so admirably illustrate, and form the 
more valuable part of this communication, are among the best speci- 
mens of the unrivalled talent of the two brothers Francis and Ferdi- 
nand Bauer, who, as botanical painters, equally united the minute 
accuracy of the naturalist with the skill of the artist." The Supple- 
ment to this valuable communication contains " the distinguishing 
characters of the order, tribes, genera and species of Rafflesiaceae."

" Root of two thick fleshy cylindrical blunt tubers, of about an inch 
long.
At the top of the tubers a bud is usually to be found (not a hy- 
bernaculum as represented in Eng. Bot.
Suppl.), but it is not remark- 
118 
able or constant enough to require particular notice.
Stalk erect, 5 
or 6 inches high, glandular above, bearing two or three smooth trian- 
gular-lanceolate attenuated sheathing small adpressed leaves.
The 
radical leaves linear-lanceolate, acute, shorter than the stem, about 4 
in number, covering the lower half of the stalk, 2 or 3 inches long ; 
the outermost narrowed considerably below and clasping; the others 
with a long sheathing base, broadest at the top of the sheath.
Spike 
1 to Ig- inch long, oblong, dense, erect ; of from 20 to 30 rather large 
milk-white flowers closely placed in three spirally-twisted rows, and 
each accompanied by a smooth triangular-lanceolate bract, the one 
or two lowermost of which slightly exceed the length of the flowers, 
but the rest scarcely equal them.
Sepals and two upper petals adher- 
ing together and connected through a considerable space from their 
base in front, their tops free, linear, blunt.
Lip spathulate, blunt, 
crenate ; its base very broad, thick, glandular externally, channelled 
by the inflexion of the sides, and almost inclosing the shortly-stalked 
column, equalling the sepals.
Operculum ovate, acute, dark brown, 
springing from within the hollowed extremity of the column.
Ros- 
tellum of the stigma deeply bifid with flattened subulate very acute 
points, having an elongate linear bluntish dark brown appendage 
(proscolla) between and extending beyond them.
There is a slight 
blunt projection between the operculum and the rostellum, which 
seems to represent the intermediate processes which are found in Spi- 
ranthes autumnalis and S.
aestivalis." â€” p.
261.
In speaking of the aflinity of this plant, the author remarks : â€” 
" In his ' Genera and species of Orchideous Plants,' Dr. Lindley 
points out the aflinity of this plant with the Sp. Romanzoffiana, Cham.
from which it is now found to diff"er by its much shorter bracts ; its 
blunt, linear and equally broad sepals ; and its longer spathulate lip.
If, however, we examine another allied species, the Sp. cernua, Rich.
(Ophrys cernua, L.), we find a plant agreeing most exactly with the 
Irish N.
gemmipara ; indeed, after a careful examination of Drum- 
mond's Rocky Mountain specimens of Sp. cernua, I am unable to de- 
tect the slightest difference.
Smith's name must therefore become a 
synonym." 
The figure which accompanies this paper is firom the accurate pen- 
cil of Mr. J.

stage than that figured in ' Engligh Botany.'

It has long been our intention to enter onÂ«, minute and careful 
analysis of this important work ; but we have been deterred by seve- 
ral causes.
In the Jirst place, such an analysis is an undertaking of 
no ordinary labour : secondly, we think it unfair to judge of a great 
work by a portion in which the author does not seem at home, and 
which has subjected him to such cutting criticisms from our German 
contemporaries ; and thirdly, we feel that the work was much want- 
ed, and that, if completed, it will supply a desideratum that has long 
been experienced in botanical literature.
Still, though we lay aside 
the critic's pen, we would, in all good will, recommend the author to 
pay a little more respect to what has been done in this country and 
elsewhere, on the subject on which he is writing: he should just skim 
the contents of other works, and show us that he is at least aware of 
their existence.
Yeai's have elapsed since the writer of this notice 
attempted to prove that the Trichomanes brevisetum of Brown was 
identical with the Trichomanes speciosum of TenerifFe and Madeira : 
he went thoroughly into the question with his lamented friend, David 
Don, who agreed in the conclusions drawn : the same view was enter- 
tained even by the great botanist who gave to this plant the name of 
hrevisetum : the prior name of speciosum was therefore restored to 
the species, and has been subsequently adopted in the publications 
of Balfour, Ward, Babington and Watson : and yet, Sir William 
Hooker, at the present day, writes thus : â€” " Yet even Sir Jas. Smith 
did not suspect that it was a plant already, though imperfectly, de- 
scribed, of South America, and even of TenerifFe and Madeira ; nor 
has any one ventured to publish it as the same to the present day." â€” 
p. 126.
We think Sir W.
Hooker ought to have known that all Bri- 
tish botanists are perfectly aware of the identity of the Irish and Ma- 
deira plants ; for had he examined any herbarium but his own, he 
would have found the name of speciosum restored, and thus he would 
have saved himself from very grave charges which are now made 
against him for want of candour, in instances which in charity we re- 
fer to a want of care.
Again, in describing the species of Trichomanes and Hymenophyl- 
120 
lum, Sir William takes no notice whatever of Presl's masterly work, 
but redescribes that author's species as new, and Â§ives them new 
names : but when his attention is called to Presl's Monograph, we 
find a summary of its contents given in the ' Synopsis Filicum,' as a 
kind of episode to the previous descriptions.
Many other instances could easily be pointed out in which similar 
objections could be raised; but we trust that Sir William Hooker will 
yet endeavour to make his work deserving of that patronage which 
all botanists are anxious to give it, on the faith of the author's repu- 
tation.
No man living possesses such opportunities of making a per- 
fect work on the Species of Ferns, as Sir Wra. Hooker.
His habitual 
use of the pen : his own matchless herbarium ; the living collection 
at Kew, brought to such perfection by Mr. Smith ; and the assistance 
of that great pteridologist â€” that walking Encyclopedia of Fern Sci- 
ence, ever at hand to solve all questions of doubt and difl&culty : â€” 
such a combination of favourable circumstances tend to place our au- 
thor in a situation rarely if ever enjoyed by a botanical monographer.
And sincerely do we trust that the work, when complete, may be alike 
honorable to its author and profitable to the spirited publisher, who, 
we hear, has undertaken it at his own cost and risk, a fact which, con- 
sidered in reference to the notorious want of patronage for scientific 
works, does him, in our estimation, infinite credit.
We must not conclude this brief notice without expressing our ad- 
miration of the excellently drawn plates, twenty in each part, and 
each containing figures of several species.

Notice of the Annals and Magazine of Natural History, No. 97.
March, 1845.
The only original botanical paper in this number is the continuation 
of Mr. Ralfs' descriptions of those debateable beings, the Desmidieae.
In a former number we mentioned that the spores of this obscure 
tribe had recently been described as animals : by a singular coinci- 
dence, Professor Rymer Jones's ' Natural History of Animals ' is pub- 
lished at the same time with this number of the ' Annals,' and these 
two works come to our hands together.
Each contains figures of 
Staurastrum ; Mr. Ralfs treating them as vegetables, Mr. Jones as 
animals.
Botanists appear, for the most part, to side with Mr. Ralfs, 
zoologists with Mr. Jones : surely we may be allowed to doubt.
" Grammatici certant : adhuc sub judice lis est." 
Some of Mr. Ralfs' observations on the mode of reproduction in 
Staurastrum are highly interesting.
" During the past summer I several times observed, scattered 
amongst various Desmidieae, orbicular spinous bodies, the colouring 
matter of which formed a dense green mass, which tested by iodine 
assumed a dark blue colour, showing its vegetable nature.
On care- 
ful examination I found that each of these bodies was usually accom- 
panied by two empty fronds of Staurastrum mucronatum, and was 
placed between them, though not in contact.
Still it appeared so 
unlike any sporangium I was acquainted with, that I arrived at the 
Vol. II.
R 
122 
conviction that it was the reproductive organ of the Staurastrum, only 
after repeated observations and tracing the formation from the com- 
mencement.
" I then transmitted specimens to Mr. Jenner.
He also at first 
doubted the connexion between the fronds and the spinous body, but 
after a minute inspection he confirms my observations in the follow- 
ing words : ' I think I can say positively that I have traced them from 
the first conjugation to the full-formed spinous body, and I now feel 
satisfied that they are the spores or sporangia of the Staurastrum.' 
"The difficulty in detecting the connexion between the empty 
fronds of the Staurastrum and the sporangium depends upon the te- 
nuity of the connecting membrane ; the fronds also are generally at 
a considerable distance, and soon become detached.
"In the conjugated specimens the fronds are always smaller than 
usual ; I have already noticed a similar fact respecting Tetmemorus 
granulatus.
" In Staui'astrum mucronatum the conjugated fronds are at first 
closely connected by the formation of a bag-like receptacle which is 
colourless and very thin, and therefore difficult of detection.
As this 
enlarges the fronds become more remote from each other, their seg- 
ments partially separate at the constriction on the inner side, the en- 
dochrome of both passes out, unites and forms an orbicular body 
between them.
In this state it resembles the sporangium formed in 
some species of Closterium.
At first it is inclosed in an orbicular 
membrane larger than itself, but as it increases in size and density, 
fine hairs make their appearance on the surface and gradually become 
stout spines, the membrane lastly disappears and the sporangium ac- 
quires its perfect state, covered with conspicuous acute spines.
" In this stage the empty fronds of the Staurastrum seem scarcely 
connected with the sporangium ; except that they are on opposite 
sides of it, have an opening towards it, accompany it in its movements, 
and always retain the same relative position.
" The fi'onds of the Staurastrum in an end view had sometimes three 
and sometimes four rays ; in conjugating a four-rayed variety would 
often unite with one having three rays, and occasionally a frond might 
be seen having four rays on one segment and three on the other.
These facts are another proof that the number of rays on a segment 
cannot constitute a generic distinction in these plants.
" It is probable that, under favourable circumstances, conjugation 
takes place in all the Desmidieae.
It is not uncommon in various 
species of Closterium ; I have seen it in this genus and in Tetmemo- 
123 
ms, and Meneghini mentions its occurrence in Desmidium.
That the 
sporangia are not more frequently detected may be partly owing to 
their minuteness, but I believe that once formed they descend to the 
bottom of the pool and become mixed with the mud.
It is well known 
that in the Conjugatfe, when all the sporangia are formed, the plant 
sinks to the bottom ; and I may remark in support of the opinion I 
have advanced, that in a small pool at Dolgelley after a shower I 
could not obtain a single specimen of the Staurastrum in a conjugated 
state, although the day before the sporangia were abundant.
In a 
few days the Staurastrum was again plentiful, but 1 no longer met 
with any conjugated specimens, although I frequently sought for 
them."â€” p.

Secretary of the Botanical Society of London, Honorary Seci'e- 
tary of the Cheltenham Literary and Philosophical Institution,

&c.' Cheltenham : H.
Davies, Montpellier Library ; and 
D. Bogue, London.
1844.
The object of this little work is sufficiently indicated by its title, 
which we have given at full length.
The author has evidently taken 
pains to render it a complete list of the floral productions of the dis- 
trict, of about ten square miles in extent ; and, as a guide to the va- 
rious localities of the plants, we should suppose it will prove useful to 
botanical students visiting Cheltenham : and the more so, as we learn 
from the Preface that this " is the first attempt which has been made 
to tabulate the plants of an undoubtedly interesting locality." The 
botanical portion is introduced by a brief account of the geographical 
and geological features of the district.
As we are nothing if not critical, we may just say that a little more 
care might advantageously have been bestowed in the correction of 
the spelling of the botanical names, many of which now look anything 
but botanical.

Under the above title are comprised three separate and distinct 
local catalogues ; the third â€” the only one which requires any notice 
from us â€” is headed, ' The Botanist's Guide to the County of Cork,' 
and contains a list of the native plants of the county, with their sta- 
tions.
In the arrangement, the Natural System is followed, and the 
nomenclature is that of Babington's Manual.
The number of phaeno- 
gamous plants ascertained to grow in the county is 885 ; of cryptoga- 
mous plants, 935 ; total number of species, 1820.
In his Preface, the compiler gives a concise summary of the works 
in which the Botany of this county have been illustrated.
" Dr. C.
Smith in his History of Cork in 1750 ; Dr. W.
Wade in his Plantae 
Rariores Hiberniae, 1804 ; and Mr. J.
T. Mackay in 1806, noticed a 
few of the rarer native plants of the county of Cork ; but there was no 
attempt at a systematic catalogue of our Flora till 1819-20, when Mr.
James Drummond, Curator of the then existing Cork Botanic Garden, 
and now Colonial Botanist at Swan River, published a list of our 
Flowering Plants in the Munster Farmer's Magazine.
Dr. Scott, of 
Cove, gave a comprehensive catalogue of the native plants of the 
Great Island in 1833 ; and our townsman, Mr. H.
T. Alexander, now 
Surgeon in the Royal Navy, presented to the Cuvierian Society of this 
city, a list embracing the entire Flora of the County (the Fungi ex- 
cepted), for which an honorary prize was awarded by the Society.
" These catalogues, a collection of manuscript botanical notes by 
the Rev. Dr.
Hincks, which he has kindly permitted me the use of, 
and the records of the Cuvierian Society, together with my own ex- 
tensive practical observations, have constituted the chief materials for 
these pages." The compiler also expresses his obligations to various 
botanical friends for their communications, each individual's contri- 
butions being acknowledged under the particular species.
The catalogue appears to have been compiled with great care, and 
the notices attached to many of the species are interesting.

Proceedings of Societies.
BOTANICAL SOCIETY OF EDINBURGH.
February 13, 1845.
â€” Dr. Douglas Maclagan, President, in the chair.
Dr. Herman Hoffmann, Giessen, was elected a foreign member of 
the Society.
Various donations to the library and museum were announced, and 
the following communications were read : â€” 
1. Dr. Seller read a paper, entitled, "Examination of the views 
adopted by Liebig on the Nutrition of Plants." He contrasted Lie- 
big's view of the mineral nature of the food of plants, with that which 
represents their food as organic.
He traced out the consequences 
deducible from this last hypothesis, as affecting not merely the vege- 
table, but the animal kingdom also ; the latter being ultimately sus- 
tained solely by vegetable substances.
He showed that, whereas the 
view adopted by Liebig nowise restricts the duration of the organized 
kingdoms, as long as they remain exempt from the influence of de- 
structive agencies from without, the opposite view involves the con- 
clusion, that the whole of organic nature is hastening rapidly to dis- 
solution from inherent causes, and he affirmed, that were certain data 
somewhat more carefully considered, the period of the final extinction 
of plants and animals, in accordance with this hypothesis, might be 
pretty nearly determined.
He regarded this question as one not 
merely of high interest in itself, but as bearing expressly on the solu- 
tion of the problem, whether the food of plants be organic or mineral.
Dr. S.
calculates the annual conversion of the carbon of organic 
matter into inorganic carbonic acid, at not less than six hundred mil- 
lions of tons ; and infers, on the most favourable aspect of the amount 
of soil over the earth's surface, that such an annual loss could not be 
withstood beyond six thousand years ; and, on a less exaggerated as- 
sumption of its amount, probably very near the truth, that the waste 
would absorb the whole of the existing organic matter of the soil in 
about seven hundred and forty years.
Dr. S.
contends that the truth of these conclusions remains unal- 
tered, even if it be conceded that much of the carbon of plants is 
drawn, not from the organic matter of the soil, but from the inorganic 
carbonic acid of the atmosphere, unless some inorganic source of their 
hydrogen and oxygen be at the same time admitted.
He, therefore, 
regards Liebig's view of the inorganic nature of the food of plants as 
supported, not merely by many special facts â€” for example, by the 
increase of the organic matter of the soil, often observed during the 
growth of plants, â€” but also by the general view of the earth's surface 
126 
just taken, because there is nothing in its aspect to warrant the idea 
that its means of maintaining the organic kingdoms are declining with 
the rapidity indicated in the statements just made.
Dr. Seller next examined Liebig's views of ammonia : â€” 1.
As the 
sole source of the nitrogen of plants, and thereby of animals.
2. As 
having its exclusive origin from the interior of the earth, and never 
from the nitrogen of the atmosphere.
In regard to these statements 
he made it appear, as there is no evidence of ammonia being thrown 
forth from the bowels of the earth at all times, in quantity proportion- 
ed to the waste of it necessarily sustained at the surface by decompo- 
sition, as into uncombined hydrogen and nitrogen, that Liebig's view 
of ammonia infers the same limitation of the existence of the organic 
kingdoms to a few thousand years, as is deduced from the hypothesis 
of organic matter being the food of plants.
Here, therefore, he dis- 
sented from Liebig, contending that ammonia must be produced from 
the nitrogen of the atmosphere, and showing the probability of what 
is taught by Professor Johnson, namely, that the nitrogen of nitrates, 
formed from the atmosphere, is fixed by plants, as well as the nitro- 
gen of ammonia.
In conclusion, he reviewed the evidence of potassa, the phosphates 
and other saline matters, of both organic kingdoms, being derived 
originally from the crumbling of rocks ; and dwelt on the retardation 
of vegetable physiology, by the long scepticism of botanists on this 
head, owing, as he believed, to their distrust in the conclusions of 
chemistry : and went on to show that chemistry must be the ground- 
work of vegetable physiology in its present stage, and that the fre- 
quent changes in the aspect and nomenclature of chemistry, did not 
materially affect the facts which it daily affords for the elucidation of 
vegetable economy.
2. A paper by Mr. Ralfs, Penzance, on the genus Closterium.
3. Mr. M'Nab read a continuation of his Joui-nal of a Tour through 
part of the United States and the Canadas.
The last portion read 
before the Society gave an account of the journey from Montreal to 
Kingston, and concluded with an account of a botanical excursion to 
the eastward of the latter place.
The woods to the westward of Kingston appeared very dense, 
chiefly consisting of stately beeches, growing in rich vegetable soil.
Several very remarkable plants were observed, and among others the 
Monotropa uniflora and M.
Hypopitys : the former, which is abun- 
dant in shady beech-woods throughout the country, and always grow- 
ing from amongst leaves, is known to the inhabitants by the name of 
127 
Indian pipe, or bird's nest ; the latter is not so plentiful, but found in 
similar situations.
Here also Corallorhiza multiflora and Orobanche 
Virginica were found, and at one place, in a dense thicket, the rare 
and curious Pterospora Andromeda.
Near the confines of the woods, in drier situations, the white and 
pink varieties of Phryma leptostachya occurred ; and on the dry lime- 
stone ridges, which prevail in this neighbourhoad, large quantities of 
Triosteum perfoliatum, Gnaphalium raargaritaceum and Botrychium 
obliquum were found ; along the margin of Lake Ontario, Serpicola 
verticillata was noticed, its delicate flowers floating on the surface; 
The beech, sugar-maple and white pine, from their quantity and local 
situation seem to have been the original inhabitants of this district ; 
and mixed with them, but not so much in groups, were noble speci- 
mens of oaks, elms and walnuts.
The sugar-maples bore evident 
marks of having been often pierced for their juices.
Fringing the 
edges of some meadow land in this district, the stag's-horn sumach 
{Rhus elegans) presented a most magnificent appearance from the 
quantity of scarlet fruit which they carried.
He was agreeably surprised to see such a variety of native haw- 
thorns, being convinced of their fitness for forming hedges so very 
much wanted in this country, and which many of the inhabitants ex- 
pressed a great desire to have, instead of the unsightly snake fences 
which at present separate the fields.
But apparently they never 
thought that the indigenous thorns would answer for this purpose, as 
they talked of importing haws and whitethorns from Britain.
Mr.
M'Nab gave instructions to those individuals with whom he had an 
opportunity of conversing upon the subject, so that they might raise 
thorns for themselves, as an abundant supply of seeds may be annu- 
ally procured at no great distance from each settlement.
As these 
instructions may be interesting to others, we here repeat them.
" The fruit should be gathered about the end of October, care be- 
ing taken to keep the seeds of the luxuriant growing sorts from those 
of the dwarfer kinds.
A pit should be prepared about a foot and a 
half deep, into which the fruit is to be put, with a mixture of earth or 
sand.
It should be turned several times during the season, and if dry, 
a little water may be added.
One or two inches of soil being a sufli- 
cient covering to ensure the decomposition of the pulp.
During the 
following October a piece of good ground should be prepared, and 
the seed sown as it is taken from the pit, pretty thick, in drills about 
a foot distant fi'om each other, or in beds three feet wide.
In the suc- 
ceeding spring the plants will begin to appear ; at which time, and 
128 
tbrougliout tlie season, they must be kept clear of weeds.
If proper- 
ly attended to, the seedlings will attain a height of from six to twelve 
inches the first year.
The following spring the strongest plants may 
be either transplanted into drills, or placed where they are intended 
to remain as a permanent fence.
The smaller ones should be left in 
the seed-drills or beds for another year, when they may be treated in 
the same manner.
In forming a live fence, the ground ought to be 
prepared as soon as the snow disappears, by making a trench about 
two feet broad and a spade in depth.
Along the centre of this trench, 
the young plants should be put about about six or eight inches apart, 
and afterwards well watered and firmly trodden in.
Care should be 
taken to protect the young plants from cattle, and clear off the weeds.
" The second year after planting, the thorns should be headed 
down to within six or ten inches of the ground, and each year after- 
wards switched up on both sides to a centre ridge, so as to produce 
the shape generally termed sow-backed.
Hedges trained in this form 
being less liable to be destroyed by snow resting upon them, than 
when cut flat at the top." 
If the method here recommended be properly attended to, Mr.
M'Nab has not the least hesitation in saying that an excellent hedge 
of native thorns may be acquired five or six years after planting.
At 
several places he saw the indigenous thorns employed as a fence ; at 
least they had been planted with that intention, and had attained a 
considerable height; but from want of proper attention to pruning 
and weeding, they were so slender that easy access might be obtained 
between each stem.
From such instances of mismanagement, an er- 
roneous opinion seems generally to prevail, that hedges will not suc- 
ceed in America.
" But," as Mr. M'Nab very properly remarks, " if 
newly planted hedges in Britain were equally neglected, there can be 
no doubt that they would soon degenerate, and become no better than 
those which I observed in the United States and Canadas." â€” Wm.
W. Evans.

Memoranda on Equhetun) iHiriegatnm, E.
Wihoui, and some other 
Plants observed in Ireland.
By David Moore, Esq.
The opportunity which two more years have afforded of observing 
Equisetuni variegatum from Portmarnock, and E.
Wilsoni from the 
Royal Canal, near Dublin, has greatly tended to strengthen my origi- 
nal opinion of those two plants being perfectly distinct species ; al- 
though it is difficult to apply in words characters sufficiently pointed 
to distinguish them.
Under cultivation they remain unalterable, and 
present neaily the same forms as they do in their natural habitats.
The canal plant, after being cultivated four years in the garden, re- 
tains its stout upright habit, and the Portmarnock plant, under the 
same circumstances, its slender decumbent habit, being only one half 
the size of the former in every way.
Besides, the periods of flower- 
ing are different; the canal plant is now (April 17th) in full bloom, 
which is most profusely produced, there being scarcely a stem but 
what is terminated by a catkin : and even in this instance they differ, 
our E.
variegatum producing flowering stems comparatively sparingly, 
whether in a cultivated or natural state, and not flowering generally 
earlier than June, though catkins in some state may be observed on it, 
as well as upon all the other species of British unbranched Equiseta, 
during the whole year.
Mr. Mackay has had the two plants under cultivation for some time, 
and considers them distinct ; and Mr. Ogilby, who observes them ve- 
ry closely, and at all seasons, both in the garden and where they grow 
naturally, is of the same opinion, as well as Mr. Johnstone ; the for- 
mer of whom tells me, the canal plant appears very conspicuous at 
present, among the few things yet in flower.
Teucriiim Scordium.
In the course of a hasty run, last June, to 
Portumna-bridge, for the purpose of searching for Teucrium Scordium 
an^i other plants, I found the Teucrium in great abundance, where 
Mr. Mackay observed it nearly forty years ago, and was able to trace 
it for several miles along the Shannon, both above and below the 
bridge.
Mr. Babington, in his Manual, has stated that the Portumna 
specimen in Smith's herbarium " has the leaves more suddenly atten- 
uated below and the whole plant more glabrous than his foreign spe- 
cimens," which I should say results from situation, as I observed the 
specimens, in different localities, to vary considerably, although no 
doubt the same species.
When growing in deep water, the plant is 
almost quite glabrous, except a few long hairs about the stem, and the 
leaves are cordate-amplexicaul, obtusely crenate and bluntly oblong.
Vol. II.
s 
130 
When on dry ground or in shallow water, but especially when grow- 
ing among the loose stones, where it is only covered with water dur- 
ing winter, or by occasional floods, the whole plant is very hairy, with 
the leaves remarkably attenuated at the base, almost stalked.
Chara latifolia occurred sparingly about a quarter of a mile below 
Portumna-bridge ; thus affording a second habitat for that very dis- 
tinct species.
It may, however, be well to mention, that the Shan- 
non affords an outlet to Sadiston-lake, where I first found the plant.
Lastraa Thelypteris was also observed in a boggy wood in the 
Marquis of Clanricarde's demesne, much finer than I ever saw it else- 
where.
Some of the fronds being eighteen inches long, and well de- 
veloped every way.
Sesleria cccrulea, which has hitherto been considered a scarce grass 
in Ireland, forms the principal portion of the pasture in some parts of 
the Marquis of Clanricarde's demesne, growing to the verge of the 
Shannon.
Mr. M'Nab of Edinburgh, and a party of Scotch botanists, 
who visited Ireland a few years ago, found the Sesleria in a similar 
situation in the Co. Galway, where it appeared to that experienced 
and acute observer, a different-looking plant fi'om that he had been 
in the habit of seeing on the Scottish mountains, as he pointed out to 
me last season, showing that the Irish plant is much more slender 
than the Scotch one, with longer leaves and longer culms, characters 
which do not alter from cultivation.
They are certainly very distinct 
varieties, if not species.
Spiraa Filipendula.
A solitary specimen was found in the Mar- 
quis of Clanricarde's park, which is chiefly interesting on account of 
its being an addition to the Irish Flora.
I had however received the 
roots in very considerable abundance last spring, from the neighbour- 
hood of Gret, Co. Galway, where it must grow abundantly, scarcely 
a sod of Gentiana vema, which it came with, being without roots of 
the Spiraea.
Several other plants, which do not occur generally, were observed 
on this occasion ; and I have no doubt that any botanist who locates 
himself a few days at Portumna, during the month of July, will be 
able to employ his time profitably.

Observations on the Genus Riihiis ; with a Notice of the Species ob- 
served during three days at Selborne.
By T.
Bell Salter, 
M.D., F.L.S.
(Concluded from p.
108).
RvBus Schleicher i (W.
& N.) should have been marked in the list 
with a point of doubt ; for although it is certainly the plant so named 
by Leighton, on the authority of Nees von Esenbeck himself, â€” as I 
have tested by comparing specimens together, â€” yet I cannot feel per- 
fectly satisfied of its being the same that is represented by this name 
in the ' Rubi Germanici.' The first short description in that work 
agrees very tolerably both with Mr. Leighton's plant and that of Sel- 
borne, which is decidedly the same form as his, but neither the more 
lengthened description of those authors, nor their figure,* agree en- 
tirely with the English specimens.
Yet Nees named Leighton's spe- 
cimen very confidently, and adds that it is a good species.f 
There being no description of this plant in any of our general 
Floras, I copy the following excellent one from Leighton's admirable 
local Flora.
" Stem arched " or " prostrate," obsoletely angular, nearly " round, 
with scattered hairs and glandular bristles ; prickles scattered, very 
unequal, diminishing insensibly into setae, straight and horizontal or 
slightly recurved ; leaves quinato-pedate or ternate, lateral leaflets of- 
ten two-lobed, obovato-acuminate, central leaflet roundish, narrower 
and subcordate at the base, acuminate, hairy above, green, soft and 
pubescent beneath ; panicle compound, upper branches single-flow- 
ered, very hairy, glandular, setose and prickly ; jioral leaves ternate, 
central leaflet obovato-acuminate, upper ones simple ; calyx reflexed 
in flower, erect and clasping the fruit, hoary, hairy, glandular and se- 
tose ; fruit nearly globular, grains large, black." 4 
To this description I only add that the barren shoot is slightly 
glaucous, and that the prickles of the panicle are numerous, long, 
straight and deflected.
The nearest affinity appears to be with R.
Koehleri ( W.
8f N.), be- 
tween which and R.
csesius (Z.) this holds a middle rank.
Babington 
accounts it to be a variety of R.
dumetorum {TV.
8f N.), but I much 
more incline to the belief of its being a variety of R.
Koehleri, which, 
in the character of the panicle, it very strongly resembles.

lish plants, whether specifically distinct or not from that from which 
Weihe and Nees' figure was taken, have the barren shoot very much 
less armed.
Of that variable, very striking, and not otherwise than handsome 
species, R.
Koehleri ( IV.
S; N.), the only specimens I found at Sel- 
borne were of the form which I have given in the above list as the var.
fuscus of this species.
No variety or so-called species has yet been 
given by this name, in former enumerations or descriptions of British 
Rubi, but as I designate by it a form which has been long recognized 
and described in our Floras, it is needful that I should make some ex- 
planation on this matter.
Many nearly allied forms, â€” of which the present is one, â€” were 
named and described as species in the 'Rubi Germanici," all of 
which, succeeding observers have agreed, cannot, as species, be kept 
distinct, and of these numerous forms, all have agreed in taking R.
Koehleri as the type, â€” though all have not agreed as to how many of 
the recognized forms, which hold affinity with it, should be united to 
it as varieties, or still be held distinct as species.
One of the forms above mentioned is that found at Selborne, which 
has led to these observations, and is that given by Leighton, in^his 
Shropshire Flora, as the R.
fusco-ater of Weihe and Nees, and very 
distinctly distinguished as a variety of Koehleri by the same name in 
Babington's Manual, and in the new edition of ' English Botany,' â€” 
the authors of all these works supposing it to be the plant distinguish- 
ed as the species R.
fusco-ater by Weihe and Nees.
That it is not 
their fusco-ater, I think I shall be able satisfactorily to prove.
As re- 
gards the opinion contained in the above British works, that this form 
is not specifically distinct from Koehleri, I most fully agree with them.
I am disposed to range as varieties of that species all the forms which 
Weihe and Nees give as species, under the names of R.
apiculatus â€” 
a form found at Beeston Castle by Mr. Borrer, in 1843 ; R.
fuscus â€” 
that now under consideration ; and R.
infestus â€” to which I have re- 
ferred some specimens marked Koehleri in some herbaria, but where 
the specimens had been collected I do not recollect.
It is a matter of 
doubt, too, whether I would not refer the last form spoken of as R.
Schleicheri to Koehleri as a variety.
Of all the forms these authors 
have grouped together as species allied to Koehleri, their R.
fusco-ater 
â€” not that of Babington, which I consider to be their fuscus â€” is the 
only one, I feel convinced, that should be kept distinct.
The overlap- 
ping leaflets of the real fusco-ater [W.
8^ N.), well represented in the 
133 
figure* in Rubi Germanici, the cuspidate and crisped leaflets, the less 
angled stems and the absence of remarkably long prickles in the pa- 
nicle, and, I may add, a decided and obvious difierence in the general 
appearance and habit of the plant, which I have found frequently 
about Poole in Dorsetshire, quite distinguish it both from the Sel- 
bome plant, and all the other forms of R.
Koehleri.
Whether Lindley intended by R.
fusco-ater the plant of Weihe and 
Nees, or Babington's variety of this name, 1 do not certainly know, 
though I have reason to believe he intended the latter.
This, I know, 
by reference to his herbarium, is not the Poole plant above spoken of, 
and which I believe there can be no doubt is identically the same, 
which the authors of the species intended by fusco-ater, but that it is 
the plant given as \a,Y.
fuscus in my list, and to which variety I have 
given this name, because it appears equally evident, both that it is 
the plant which Weihe and Nees intended by their R.
fuscus,t and 
that it cannot properly be held as truly and specifically distinct firom 
R. Koehleri.
It is to be readily distinguished from the true ftisco-ater 
by the narrowness and distinctness of the leaflets, from the normal 
Koehleri, by the absence of the long straight prickles in the panicle, 
and lastly, from the var.
apiculata, to which it most nearly approach- 
es, by the cuspidate leaflets and larger serratures.
E. rosaceus (W.
& N.) is the next name on our list.
Though no 
Rubus by this name has appeared in our British books, yet I cannot 
altogether assert that it is new to our Flora, it being, as I have ascer- 
tained by comparison, identical with the Channel Island plant given 
by Mr. Babington in his Manual as R.
Lejeunii.
As however, his â€” 
the only British â€” description, does not appear quite to characterize 
the plant distinctly, I add the following modification of it.
Stem slender, arched and rooting, angular, hairy, setose, abounding 
with glands ; jrrickles numerous, slender, straight, deflected, very un- 
equal and passing insensibly into setae.
Leaves ternate, or occasion- 
ally quinato-pedate ; leaflets stalked, obovate or obovato-lanceolate, 
acuminate, hairy above, rather downy beneath, coarsely and unequally 
sen'ated.
Panicle with long straight prickles, decompound, with two 
principal branches below, and tapering above.
Calyx long, with a 
foliaceous point, reflected in fi-uit.
Bachis, peduncles and hracteas 
densely covered with red glands.
This is, indeed, a most truly beautifiil plant ; the petals are long,

and of a beautiful, delicately shaded and rather pale pink, and the 
whole shrub of a slender and elegant growth; while the numerous red 
glands which cover and even tint the panicle, give it almost a mossy 
appeai'ance, very like that of some of the roses.
It is not, however, I 
apprehend, on this account, that the name of rosaceus has been given 
to the species, but on account of the foliaceous extremities of the 
calyx, which, when the plant is in bud, give it a somewhat urceolate 
appearance, as in the roses ; the glands on the calyx, however, add 
much to the effect.
In the figure of Weihe and Nees* this appear- 
ance is either somewhat exaggerated, or, what is more likely, the de- 
gree of the foliaceous extremity varies, a circumstance not uncommon 
with foliaceous appendages in general.
In the Selborne specimen, as 
well as that of the Channel Islands, the foliaceous portion is little 
more than rudimentary, still, both as regards the figure and the de- 
scription,t â€” which latter agrees excellently with our plants, â€” there is 
amply sufficient to identify them with that of the Rubi Germanici.
As regards the figure in that work, it is taken at the time which most 
favours the rose-like appearance of the plant, namely, when in bud, 
but as none of the other species are figured in this state, it is objec- 
tionable, as it deprives those who consult the work, of the opportunity 
of comparing the representations under equal circumstances.
In the herbarium of Mr, Borrer, is a specimen of this species, and 
one which perfectly coincides in every character with my own and Mr.
Babington's, which was gathered by Mr. Woods near Verviers, in 
company with M.
Lejeune, and by him authenticated.
This is satis- 
factory, not only as confirming on high authority the opinion of our 
British specimens' being R.
rosaceus, but more particularly so as dis- 
proving them to be R.
Lejeunii according to the first opinion of Mr.
Babington, as it is not likely that Mr. Lejeune would be unacquainted 
with the species named after himself, and the more particularly so, as 
the circumstance of his having had to correct an error^ respecting it, 
must have the more impressed it upon his mind.
Mr. Lejeune also,

+ Weihe and Nees (Rubi Germ.
p. 79), and Meiteus and Koch (Deutsch.
Fl. iii.
p. 605), are in error in referring R.
Lejeunii [W.
^- N.) to the fruticosus of Lejeune in 
the ' Flore de Spa,' p.
233, (not 133, as they give it) ; his fruticosus there mentioned 
being the R.
discolor of Weihe and Nees.
This mistake arises from an error of Le- 
jeune, in his ' Revue de la Flore,' at p.
100, where he himself makes the mistake which 
those authors have copied, but which he afterwards corrects and fully explains in the 
' Additions et Corrections' at pp.
240-41.
135 
in his ' Flore de Spa,' recognizes R.
rosaceus to be a plant of his own 
neighbourhood.* 
It is not a little remarkable that in displacing R.
Lejeimii from our 
Flora, I am immediately able to restore it, having found it within two 
miles of the station of R.
rosaceus, both being in the parish of Sel- 
borne.
We leave further remarks on this bramble till we come to 
speak of it in its proper place â€” except that being one of the allies of 
the one which now occupies us, it may be well to state the characters 
by which they may be distinguished.
R. rosaceus may be known from 
R. Lejeunii, by the far greater abundance of glands in every part, by 
the leaves being ternate instead of quiuato-pedate, by the absence of 
tomentum from the panicle, and by the greater length of the calyx.
The only other species with which it appears needful to draw a 
distinctive comparison, is that one, which of all the genus bears the 
strongest affinity with R.
rosaceus, namely, R.
Bellardi {TV.
8f N.), â€” 
which has recently been added to our Flora by Mr. Richard Spruce, 
who discovered it at Terrington Car, near Castle Howard, in York- 
shire, in 1841, and of which a beautiful figure has been given in a re- 
cent number of the 'Supplement to English Botany,' under the name 
of R.
glandulosus {Bellard), accompanied by an elaborate history of 
the plant, from the able pen of ray friend Mr. Borrer.f Our present 
plant is distinguished from Bellardi, by the longer and more variable 
prickles, by the angled stem, and by the form of the leaflets, which 
are obovate, irregularly and rather coarsely serrated in this species, 
and ovate, regularly and finely serrated in Bellardi.
Our Flora scarcely boasts two more elegant and beautiful plants, 
than these two allied brambles â€” R.
rosaceus and R.
Bellardi.
The next name which appears on the list is that of R.
Lejeunii, 
(W.
& N.) â€” a name which 1 did not insert without some slight degree 
of hesitation, but on further examination for these notes, my doubts 
certainly diminish.
They were however of a two-fold nature, namely, 
* Revue de la Flore, p.
238.

It is, I think, to be regretted, that the name of R.
glandulosus, which is equally applicable to so many species, and which has been so 
much confoimded.
should have been taken in ' English Botany ' instead of R.
Bellar- 
di (W^.
^ N), which is now so generally adopted for this species, and so entirely iden- 
tified with it.
The description and history of the plant here given cannot be too highly 
praised, and the figure is excellent and beautifully executed.
I cannot however avoid 
noticing an anachronism, which the artist has taken the liberty of introducing, name- 
ly, that of representing fruit, flower and bud all on the same panicle.
The colour of 
the parts and clothing of the panicle are almost precisely as iu R.
rosaceus, {W.
^ N.)

first, respecting the point whether it should not be considered as a 
variety of some other species ; and secondly, whether my plant be in 
reality precisely that to which Weihe first gave this name.
With re- 
spect to the first point, in the absence of sufficient proof I shall not 
venture to express any decided opinion, but adopt the distinction and 
nomenclature as they now stand ; and with respect to the second 
point, while the chai-acters of my Selborne plant sufficiently accord 
with the figure and description of Weihe and Nees, to be considered 
as the same species, I shall not hesitate to draw up my description 
from the coincident characters of their and my plant, and afterwards 
mention those points which would probably make mine to be a vari- 
ety of Lejeunii, should this ultimately be retained as a species, or a 
sub-variety, should Lejeunii lapse into a variety, as I suspect, of ano- 
ther species.
The following is a description of the species.
Stem arched, slender, slightly angled, sparingly hairy and glandu- 
lose ; prickles variable, and gradually passing into setae, a few very 
long and deflected.
Leaves quinato-pedate, occasionally ternate ; 
leajiels obovato-lanceolate, acuminate, unequally serrated, bright and 
shining above, paler and pubescent beneath.
Stipul<B linear, hairy 
and very glandulose.
Panicle branched, tomentose, prickly and glan- 
dulose ; peduncles thickly strewed with long white-pointed aciculae 
and glands.
Bracteas numerous, lanceolate, simple or trifid, very 
hairy and glandulose.
Calyx broadly lanceolate, acuminate, densely 
tomentose, reflexed in fruit.
The prickles in this pretty bramble, as mentioned in the above de- 
scription, are very variable; the majority are small, but a few of the 
larger ones have thick bases and are somewhat hooked.
The leaves 
are variable, having three, four or five leaflets, which, however, are all 
pedicellate ; * the lower part of the panicle is leafy, with ternate leaves, 
and armed as the shoot ; the upper part and pedicels are covered with 
a loose tomentum, and thickly strewed with straight fine prickles, red 
at the base and white at the tip.
The flowers are of a very bright 
rose; tint.
The whole plant forms a very beautiful shrub, with much 
the general aspect of the variety B.
of R.
carpinifolius.
The Selborne plant varies from that of Weihe and Nees in having 
the stem less armed, though with the same description of clothing, 
and the arch more ascending.
This may have arisen from its growing 
* The description of the leaf in ' Ruhi Gerraanici ' is so happy and characteristic, 
that I am tempted to transcribe it.

quinata, et tunc quidera pleraque pedatisecta." â€” p.
79.

more in the shade, but the effect ol" the difference is to approximate it 
more nearly to R.
carpinifolius 0.
( W.
Sf N.) From this, however, it 
may be distinguished by the glands and setae on the growing shoot, 
which is also less hairy, and by the abundant glands on the panicle, 
which are only occasionally seen in that species, and I believe never 
but in the variety jS.
The prickles of the panicle are very similar in 
these two species.
The only other form of which I think it necessary to enumerate the 
distinctive differences, is R.
rosaceus, from which it may be distin- 
guished by the quinato-pedate leaves, by the whole plant being very 
much less glandulose, and by the short and tomentose calyx.
Other 
points of distinction were mentioned when speaking of that species.
By the name of R.
rudis I refer to a bramble which I have seen in 
different herbaria, and labelled with many different names.
It is one 
form of a most natural group, distinguished by hispid stems and sharp 
jagged leaves ; and it is a matter yet very undecided, how many of the 
forms of this group should be included as one species, or how far, as 
species, they should be kept distinct.
In the absence of sufficient in- 
formation on this point, I have chosen the name of Weihe and Nees,* 
which I confidently conclude to be intended for the form I refer to by 
this name in the Selborne list, and I have only here to refer to those 
descriptions in our general Floras, which, under different names, ap- 
ply to it.
I trust, at some future time, I may have some further op- 
portunity of seeing more of these forms, and of observing how far they 
are or are not specifically distinct.
The form in question I refer to the R.
Radula of Leighton, R.
Ra- 
dula, var.
y. Hystrix, of Babington, and to R.
rudisf of Lindley (both 
editions).
To the latter two authors, under the names here given, I 
refer for descriptions.
The plant is one of very remarkable appearance; its jagged leaves 
and hispid stem giving it a very peculiar aspect, but one which is cer- 
tainly both elegant and handsome.
The next Rubus which appears on our list is one which I believe 
to be an uudescribed species, an opinion in which my friend Mr. Ba- 
bington coincides with me.
Having carefully examined it with this 
gentleman, I adopt for it the name of Rubus ]3abingtonii, in acknow- 
ledgment, not only of his successful labours in this difficult genus.
*Rubi Gemianici, p.

but also of the great obligation under which I feel all British botanists 
to be to him, for all that he has done to elucidate our Flora.
The 
following is a description of 
Rnhus Bahingtonii.
Stem very long, arched, terete and channel- 
led, slightly glandulose and hairy, hispid with numerous short, thick 
prickles, which pass insensibly into setae.
Leaves ternate, rarely qui- 
nate, green and glabrous on both sides ; leaflets rhomboido-cordate, 
cuspidate, irregularly and doubly crenato-serrate, serratures mucro- 
nate ; 2yetioles and pedicels prickly and setose ; stipules linear, hairy.
Panicle leafy and much branched; primary rachis clothed in the 
lower part as the shoot ; the upper portion, branches and peduncles 
tomentose, prickly and setose ; glands not numerous.
Leaves of the 
panicle ternate or simple, entire at the base, with raucronate crena- 
tures towards the apex.
Bracteas foliaceous to the summit, broadly 
lanceolate, hairy and glandulose.
Calyx broadly lanceolate, cuspi- 
date, hairy.
This species is by far the largest Rubus I have ever seen, but I am 
unable to speak of its exact dimensions, not having measured it.
Its 
hispid stem would place it as a near ally of R.
rudis {W.
Sf N.), while 
its style of inflorescence would associate it with Koehleri or fusco-ater, 
and its tomentose rachis and peduncles with R.
leucostachys and its 
allies.
To see a bramble of this extraordinaiy size with ternate leaves 
is not a little remarkable, and what is still further so is, that the few 
quinate leaves which did exist, were on the smaller and weaker shoots.
The leaves are perfectly free from hairs above, and almost perfectly 
so, and consequently green beneath ; their coarse crenatures too have 
a remarkable aspect, quite different from any other Rubus.
The pa- 
nicle is enormous, being fully two feet in length, and in some instan- 
ces considerably more.
Notwithstanding the enormous size of the 
other parts of the inflorescence, the fruit is very small, and composed 
of minute black drupes.
The stem, though grooved, is not angled, 
the prominences left by the grooves being rounded.
It is certainly 
more hispid than any other Rubus I have seen.
From R.
rudis and its other allies â€” for in this group its hispid stem 
certainly places it â€” it may readily be distinguished by the broad leaf- 
lets, instead of the narrow jagged ones of those species; from R.
Koehleri and its allies by the paucity of hairs and glands ; lastly, from 
R. leucostachys and its congeners, by the presence of glands and 
setae ; and from all these by the ternate leaves, with their crenate 
margins.
139 
Rubus C(Bsius (L.), the last on our list of Selborne Rubi, need not 
detain us long, being so well known.
It is, however, not a little re- 
markable, that, loving damp shade as this plant usually does, and 
abounding as is Selborne in shady streams and woods, the dewberry 
nevertheless appears here always to choose sunny exposures.
It was 
consequently of rather stout habit, but always trailing ; it was, too, 
notwithstanding such exposure, the true casius, and not at all inclin- 
ing to pass into dumetorum, which, according to Mr. Lees' opinion, 
it should have done in such situation.
This remark brings me to speak of my promise (Phytol.
ii.
99) to 
speak of Mr. Lees' third instance of species or supposed species dedu- 
cible from R.
caesius.
This instance is mentioned in the paper before 
quoted, in the ' Transactions of the Botanical Society of Edinburgh' 
(part iii.
p. 177), and refers to a form which Mr. Lees is disposed to 
call aenosus.
If this form be, as is there mentioned, Mr. Leighton's 
" 1-hamnifolius, second form" I think its true affinity will be found, 
not with cceftius, but with affinis, as I have already remarked in this 
paper (Phytol.
ii.
101).
Mr. Lees also speaks of deriving some form or 
forms called " corylifolius " from this species, but this need not detain 
us.
This term is so vague, and has been so variously applied, that it 
is not unlikely forms of caesius, as well as of other species, may often 
have been so called ; and I should gather from the tenor of Mr. Lees' 
remarks, that his experience is the same as mine, when I say that I 
have not met with a specimen labelled with this name, which might 
not rightly be referred to some other species.
Being thus so totally 
ignorant what ought to be intended by E,.
corylifolius, I must leave 
this suggestion of Mr. Lees, only expressing generally the opinion 
that I believe R.
caesius to be one of the most natural of our species, 
though to a considerable extent a variable one.
Doubtless Selborne contains many other forms of Rubi, besides 
those noticed in these remarks, but these are all I observed during my 
" Tliree Days' Botanizing at Selborne,''' â€” three days I am not likely 
soon to forget.

On the Theory of " Progressive Development^'' applied in explana- 
tion of the Origin and Transmutation of Species.
By Hewett 
C. Watson, Esq., F.L.S.
(Continued from p.
113).
My former communication on this subject was intended to have an 
introductory character only.
Two questions arise on the theory of 
progressive development, as set forth in the ' Vestiges ; ' namely, first, 
Can plants originate from unorganized matter .-' â€” secondly.
Can plants 
of one species, in any way, produce individuals of another species ?
To both of these questions the author of the 'Vestiges' seems ready 
to give an affirmative reply.
But his attempt to base this affirmation 
upon the ground-work of facts, unfortunately, must be pronounced a 
thorough failure.
Overlooking the best part of the evidence which 
might be adduced in favour of this hypothesis, he stumbled upon two 
or three pretended facts, which had been published only to be scouted 
as absurdly improbable ; and which, when rightly examined, are 
really not in accordance with the theory which he advocates.
To the former of these two questions, our existing knowledge of 
Biology seems inadequate to afford any satisfactory answer.
We can 
neither assert nor deny that plants do sometimes originate from inor- 
ganic matter.
The pre-existence of a parent appears always neces- 
sary to the production of those species of more complex organization, 
with the propagation of which we are best acquainted.
Yet this con- 
stant fact may not hold true with other species of very simple organi- 
zation.
And it should be conceded to those who advocate the theory 
of progressive development throughout Nature, that only the simplest 
plants could be expected to originate wholly or solely from inorganic 
matter.
In truth, he is more hasty than philosophic in his judgment, 
who can believe himself entitled to assert, that the simplest forms of 
vegetable life (say, for example, a Protococcus) never come into exis- 
tence, unless by the development of germs which have first constituted 
portions of a parent individual similar to themselves.
On this first 
question, however, I do not wish to enlarge here.
It is unsettled, and 
likely long to remain unsettled.
The second question, bearing on the transition of species, may be 
taken under consideration independently of any reference to the origin 
of organic nature.
In this consideration we are not restricted to those 
very simple forms of vegetable life, the diminutive size of which puts 
insuperable difficulties in the way of correct observations.
A pervad- 
141 
ing uniformity is everyvvhei-e seen in the operations of Nature, whicli 
may warrant a presumption that the same rule will hold true here, 
alike in the complex structures and in the more simply organized 
plants â€” whether that rule shall ultimately establish or refute the idea 
of a transition of species.
I use this term " transition," to signify the 
production of one species fi'ora another, whether it be effected by de- 
scent, or in any other mode.
And my purpose here is to point out 
the kind of evidence, upon the validity of which a decision must be 
made, in forming our opinions upon the matter.
This evidence may 
be conveniently arranged under three general heads : â€” 
1. Inferences which have been drawn from the past history of the 
earth, and those changes in the character of its Flora which have been 
brought to light by geological research.
2. The tendency of species to vary ; and hence the production of 
such intermediate and connecting links between different species, as 
would warrant a presumption that no permanently impassable limits 
are assigned to them.
3. Direct facts towards establishing the transition from one species 
into another.
First, then, it will be conceded that many species of plants former- 
ly flourished on the surface of the earth, which were quite distinct 
from those now growing around us in their stead.
Further, there is 
good reason for believing that none of the present species existed in 
those remote periods.
And it seems highly probable, if not certain, 
that past changes in the earth's Flora were effected gradually ; the 
whole Flora of any one period not being destroyed in the aggregate, 
to make room for another entirely different Flora; â€” but that species 
after species disappeared, species after species appeared, singly and 
successively ; no total change occurring at once, unless as a local 
event, which would not implicate the general Flora of the earth.
It is extremely difficult to account for these changes, by natural 
means, unless on the hypothetical assumption that one species pro- 
duced another, under changed conditions of climate or other circum- 
stances.
In rejecting that hypothesis, we are thrown upon the super- 
natural alternative of assuming, quite as gratuitously, a direct and 
oft-repeated exercise of Creative Power.
But this latter assumption is 
not consistent with anything now seen in Nature, where all seems to 
proceed uniformly, in accordance with pre-settled laws.
Still, gratu- 
itous though it is, the supernatural alternative is the one generally 
received by the vulgar, and admitted â€” tacitly, at least â€” by men of 
science.
The author of the ' Vestiges ' found this impediment in his 
142 
way, and he lias accordingly penned some arguments against it, which 
I will quote in preference to stating my own ideas on the subject.
The arguments apply to plants equally as to animals.
" It may now be inquired," he writes, â€” " In what way was the cre- 
ation of animated beings effected?
The ordinary notion may, I think, 
be not unjustly described as this, that the Almighty author produced 
the progenitors of all existing species by some sort of personal or im- 
mediate exertion.
But how does this notion comport with what we 
have seen of the gradual advance of species, from the humblest to the 
highest ?
How can we suppose an immediate exertion of this crea- 
tive power at one time to produce zoophytes, another time to add a 
few marine moUusks, another to bring in one or two conchifers, again 
to produce crustaceous fishes, again perfect fishes, and so on to the 
end ?
This would surely be to take a very mean view of the Creative 
Power â€” to, in short, anthropomorphize it, or reduce it to some such 
character as that borne by the ordinary proceedings of mankind." 
" Some other idea must then be come to with regard to 
the mode in which the Divine Author proceeded in the organic crea- 
tion."â€” p.
1.53.
There is small likelihood that the stone tablets of Geology will ever 
yield an explanation of the " mode " by which the exchange of spe- 
cies was brought about in past eras.
In the absence of real know- 
ledge we take up an hypothesis which best accords with the facts, 
when we seek to explain past events by assuming, hypothetically, that 
one species changed into or produced another.
Secondly, we have to consider whether species are distinguished 
from each other by definite and permanent characters, or whether 
they vary to such a degree as may justify a doubt respecting the ex- 
istence of impassable limits between them.
For the present I must 
write of " species " as commonly understood by botanists, without at- 
tempting any rigorous definition of the term, which may hereafter be 
found to represent only a fiction of the human mind.
Philosophical 
thinkers now regard the larger groupings of systematic Botany, orders 
and genera, in the light of conventional unions only.
But almost all 
botanists believe species to be something real and permanent in Na- 
ture.
The prevailing belief apparently is, that individual plants of 
the same species vary among themselves only within limits compara- 
tively narrow ; that they can be distinguished from those of different 
species by certain peculiarities of structure or form, which are techni- 
cally called " characters ; " that these characters are constantly re- 
143 
peated in their descendants ; and that the distinctive characters of 
one species are never assumed by the progeny of another species.
It must be confessed, however, that there is much difficulty in re- 
conciUng this belief with the familiar fact, that in many genera the 
number and distinctions of the supposed species seem to depend 
pretty much upon the fancy of the botanists who describe them.
Thus, in the genera Salix, Rosa, Rubus, Mentha, Viola, Festuca, Poa, 
Saxifraga, Cerastium, Hieracium, Polygonum, Myosotis and others, 
the number of species may be held optional with botanical authors.
Such a remark may startle some of our great " species-botanists ; " 
and yet, in the short table below, we have something very like a proof 
of its correctness.
The table is intended to show the number of in- 
digenous species in some of these genera, varying according to the 
author who describes and catalogues them.
Hudson (1791), 
Smith (1824â€”8), 
Lindley (1835), 
Hooker (1842), 
Babington (1843), 
London Catalogue (1844), 
Some few of the species were first discovered in this country during 
the present century ; but these novelties will go only a short way to- 
wards making up the wide differences between Hudson and Smith.
The grand cause of the varying numbers arises from discordant views 
about species and varieties ; those forms which by one author are 
described for distinct species, by another are included together as 
varieties only of the same single species.
I select the genera named 
above, as examples of uncertainty in numbers, because their described 
species are numerous.
Equivalent differences will appear in other 
genera, where the species are few.
Thus, Hudson's solitary (or, du-

His 
six species of Viola have been increased to ten, although they are now 
again reduced to six or seven.
From his two species of Betula we 
have seen four made, and a fifth is now threatened under the significant 
sentance of " probably a distinct species." So, on we might go, with 
the species of many other genera.
It will be borne in mind here, that 
the plants of Britain have been long and carefully studied by many 
able botanists ; and it would hence seem impossible for such differen-

ces of opinion still to exist among them, unless the distinctions and 
limits of species were truly very uncertain â€” not to write, arbitrary.
The preceding examples are derived from plants in a state of na- 
ture.
When brought under cultivation, and it becomes the interest 
or amusement of cultivators to increase and extend their variations, 
scarce any limit can be set upon the power of doing so.
Our culti- 
vated species of Pelargonium, Erica, Rosa, Fuchsia and Calceolaria, 
have now become respectively an undistinguishable intermixture of 
cross breeds and varieties.
The changes brought about in long-cul- 
tivated fruits and vegetables seem to prove that varieties of a single 
species may differ quite as widely among themselves, as do other 
plants which are usually accounted distinct species.
We have exam- 
ples in the apple, pear, plum, gooseberry, strawberry and grape, 
among fruits ; in the pea, potato and cabbage, among vegetables.
To these we might add olher examples in florists' flowers ; such as 
the Dahlia and pansy, which have been so greatly run into varieties 
in the course of a few years past.
The numerous and still increasing variations in the species above 
mentioned, afford clear proofs that the progeny is not necessarily a 
copy of the parent, varying only in luxuriance or other slight and 
temporary character.
In the coiu'se of generations some descendants 
differ so widely from their ancestral plants, as to appear like distinct 
species, when they are contrasted against other less changed, or un- 
changed, descendants from the same ancestors â€” or, at least, what are 
supposed to be such.
We find, indeed, a conflict of opinion in some 
cases, whether the wild and the cultivated species have been derived 
from the same common stock, or whether they have been aboriginally 
distinct.
Let us make a short series, in example of this, where the 
uncertainty respecting an original identity of stock will become great- 
er and greater.
It is generally agreed, I believe, that the wild thorny 
pear is the original stock of all our garden pears, various though they 
are.
It is not quite so generally allowed, that the wild thorny crab 
of our hedge-rows is the true stock of the garden apples in their count- 
less varieties.
More doubt attaches to the wild sloe or the bullace (or 
both, as two forms of a single species) in the light of a common stock 
to all our plums of the garden.
And very few botanists seem prepared 
to receive the wild cherry [Prunus Cerasus) as the real stock of the 
garden cherry {Prunus avium).
Some of our Cerealia cannot be re- 
ferred to any known wild stock; whether the original species has 
ceased to exist in a state of nature, or whether the long-cultivated va- 
rieties have lost resemblance to their original stocks, might be made 
145 
a question which would not be likely to iind any speedy solution in 
response.
With such examples before our eyes, we are bound to concede to 
the transitionists, that plants do possess a capability of wide variation 
from any one form which we may choose to select for the normal or 
typical form of a species.
But are these variations sufficiently wide 
to give any probability that one species may pass gradually into ano- 
ther ?
As a reply to this query, I will now cite some few instances of 
admitted species being tied together (so to speak) by a series of inter- 
mediate forms.
According to the usual application of the term, it may be safely 
assumed that Geum urbanum and Geum rivale are two distinct spe- 
cies.
They are easily distinguished by several well defined charac- 
ters ; and I do not recollect that any botanical authority has united 
them under a single specific name.
Yet intermediate forms between 
them have long been familiar to botanical eyes, and which have usu- 
ally been accounted varieties of one or of both the species above 
named.
These intermediate forms have been commonly clubbed to- 
gether, under the single name of "intermedium;" this name meaning 
a third species in the estimation of some few botanists, a variety in 
that of most others, or a series of intermediate varieties in the eyes 
and ideas of another and smaller section of botanists.
The Geum 
intermedium is taken up as a distinct species, by our present great 
adopter and maker of dubious species, who writes, " If this plant is 
not a distinct species I do not know to which of the others it should 
be referred." There is, however, a strong objection against regard- 
ing the plant as a " distinct -species," in the fact, that it is not one 
clearly defined form, with characters intermediate between those of 
two other well marked forms ; but that it is really a group or series of 
intermediate forms, which run into Geum urbanum, at one end of the 
series, while approximating also to Geum rivale at the other extremi- 
ty.
Apparently, both species sport into varieties ; and these varieties 
run so near together as to have been combined into one supposed 
third species.
We obtain another familiar example in the cowslip and primrose.
Though some degree of doubt may have been expressed occasionally, 
the prevailing opinion has clearly been, that Primula veris and Pri- 
mula vulgaris are truly distinct species.
They are so dissimilar that 
every country-bred child can distinguish them with the greatest faci- 
lity.
They are extremely abundant in many places ; and thousands 
or tens of thousands may be examined without any decided example

being found which would indicate the transition from one towards the 
other species.
Notwithstanding this, intermediate forms are occa- 
sionally seen, which exhibit a series of steps from the common prim- 
rose {Primula rulgaris) towards the cowslip [Primula veris), and 
which have usually been mistaken, in this country, for a different spe- 
cies {Primula elatior, of Jacquin).
On the other side, there is a 
variety of the cowslip which makes a considerable step towards the 
primrose, in its larger, paler, and nearly flattened limb of the corolla.
This latter is the Primula veris, var.
major, of the London Catalogue.
It has been sup'posed that those varieties of the primrose which ap- 
proximate nearest to the cowslip, are hybrids or mule-breeds between 
the two received species.
This conjecture may be coiTect, although 
the supposed hybrid wants one of the peculiarities usually expected 
in true mules ; namely, that of sterility.
(See Phytol.
i. 9, 232, 1001).
It would not be difficult to adduce other examples of two reputed 
species apparently passing one into the other by intermediate varie- 
ties.
But in the pages of a monthly periodical I can give only few 
examples in any detail.
In most instances, perhaps, where two al- 
leged species are thus connected by intermediate varieties, the dis- 
tinctness of the two species is called in question for that very reason.
Thus, in the eyes of some botanists, the cases would resolve them- 
selves into examples of variation in single species, rather than instan- 
ces of connecting links between two species.
Teucrium scordioides 
passes into Teucrium Scordium, by a gradual variation of character; 
but the former is rightly deemed a dubious species.
So eJso of Erica 
Mackaiana, a very dubious species, which may be traced, step by step, 
into a form scarce distinguishable in any way from Erica Tetralix.
Betula glutinosa passes into Betula alba ; Veronica humifusa shades 
into Veronica serpyllifolia ; Rumex conglomeratus into Rumex san- 
guineus ; Avena alpina into Avena pratensis ; Festuca loliacea into 
Festuca pratensis ; F.
pratensis into F.
elatior ; F.
elatior into F.
arundinacea ; Viola lactea into Viola flavicornis ; V.
flavicornis into 
V. canina ; &c.
&c.
From such facts as these â€” whether seen in the wilds, produced in 
the gardens, or recorded in books â€” are we not forced to concede to 
the transitionists, that the notion of permanently impassable limits 
between species, whether true or false in itself, wears rather a doubt- 
ful aspect at present ?
Still, we cannot altogether concede that the 
mere existence of wide varieties, or of intermediate forms between 
alleged species, will sufficiently warrant a presumption against the 
reality of such limits.
Moreover, it is to be remembered, that some 
147 
species stand isolated from all others by broad characters of differ- 
ence which cannot well be supposed passable at a leap.
The Linnsea 
and the Adoxa are examples of this among our indigenous plants.
We have still to inquire about direct facts towards establishing the 
transition from one species into another.
This will be a difficult sub- 
ject to treat, because the very definition of the term " species," as 
usually given, involves an assumption of non-transition ; so that any 
case of real transition â€” supposing such a case to be adduced â€” would 
be set down simply as evidence to disprove the duality of the species.
I must reserve this inquiry for another communication, lest it should 
extend the present paper to a length incompatible with the limits of 
the ' Phytologist.' Hewett C.

A List of the Musci and Hepatic(B of Yorkshire.
By Mr. Richard Sprdce, F.B.S.
As I am on the point of setting out on a Botanical expedition to 
the Pyrenees* and the south of Spain, and it is quite uncertain what 
length of time may elapse ere my return, I venture to solicit your in- 
sertion in 'The Phytologist' of the following list of Yorkshire Musci 
and Hepaticse, which includes all the mosses that have been added to 
the Flora of the county since the publication of Mr. Baines's work.
As a mere list oi Yorkshire species, it is as complete as I have it in 
my power to make it, but the pressure of preparation for my intended 
* My object in visiting the Pyrenees is to collect and publish the flowering-plants, 
Mosses, HepaticÂ® and Lichens of those mountains.
I hope to have the Phanero- 
gamic portion of the collection ready for sale in London by the end of autumn ; the 
accurate determination of the species of the Cryptogamia will be a work of time, but 
they will appear as early as possible after the flowers, and I propose to publish them 
in the style of Drummond's ' Musci Americani.' Those of the readers of ' The 
Phytologist' who have been in the habit of receiving specimens from me, will be able 
to form an idea of the manner in which my Pyrenean collections will be got up, and 
I much regret that the confining nature of my profession has prevented me from 
cultivating so extensive a botanical correspondence as I could have wished.
I may 
add, however, that the specimens will be as perfect in every respect as it is possible to 
procure and to render them.
I contemplate, ere my return to England, to devote several months to the exami- 
nation of Andalusia, and especially to the Sierra Nevada, with the same objects in 
view.
The vegetable productions of this rich but imperfectly known country are more 
interesting than even those of the Pyrenees, and I have reason to anticipate the 
discovery of many novelties.
148 
journey has prevented me from giving so many localities as I could 
have wished, and from adding remarks on several of the new and 
little-known species, which would have made it more vahiable and 
interesting.
The nomenchiture is chiefly that of the ' Bryologia Eu- 
ropoea,' with the addition (when necessary) of the synonymes of 
Smith's ' English Flora,' voh v.
part 2, our latest authority on the 
subject of British mosses.
The species not included in Baines's 
' Yorkshire Flora' are marked with one asterisk, and those not de- 
scribed in the 'English Flora' with two.
The Hepaticae are not 
inserted at all in Baines's ' Flora,' and no complete list of the York- 
shire species has been previously published.
The very few localities 
which I have introduced, without having seen a specimen from them, 
are included in inverted commas ; but they are on what I consider 
unexceptionable authority.
The Yorkshire mosses here enumerated 
amount to 297 species, and the Hepaticae to 76.
Perhaps no other 
county can show numbers approaching to these, but it may be said 
that this is sufl5ciently explained by its exceeding every other in 
extent.
However, more than half of it yet remains to be explored, 
and Yorkshire Bryologists are " few and far between." Besides, in 
tracts of country of very limited extent that have been well investi- 
gated, as gi'eat a number of species has been found as anywhere in 
England, within the same space.
For instance, within a circle of one 
mile from the High Force of the Tees, 40 species of Hepaticae have 
been found ; and on Stockton Forest, near York, I have gathered, on 
about an acre of ground, 29 species of the same tribe, all, with a 
solitary exception, in fructification.

f This is the " D.

described in ' Muscologia Britannica ;' but having since had an opportunity of com- 
paring it with the example of D.
strumiferum in Moug.
and Nestler, I am satisfied 
that it is a very different species.
Mr. Wilson refers it to D.
Starkii, and perhaps 
correctly ; it differs, however, from all the specimens of D.
Starkii in my possession 
in the following particulars.
Leaves patent or subsecund, concavo-canaliculate, subu- 
late or subulato-setaceous from a lanceolate base (subulate in the other), of a darker 
colour, the nerve rather stronger, and in the uppermost leaves continued beyond the 
pagina ; those of the perichaetium tapering more suddenly into longer and more rigid 
points.
The male inflorescence consists of gemmae dispersed along the stem, in the 
axils of the leaves, while in D.
Starkii they are seated at the base of the female flower.
Pedicel stouter.
Capsule wider, the outer paries less delicate.
Operculum with a 
longer beak.

Proceedings of Societies.
BOTANICAL SOCIETY OF EDINBURGH.
March 13, 1845.
â€” Dr. Seller, V.P., in the chair.
Robert Balloch, Esq., 177, West Regent St., Glasgow, was elected 
a non-resident Fellow of the Society.
Numerous donations to the library and museum were announced.
The following communications were read : â€” 
1. On the genus Closterium (continued), by Mr. J.
Ralfs, Penzance.
2. On Encyonema prostratura of Klitzing, by the same.
3. Mr. M'Nab read a continuation of his Journal of a Tour through 
the United States and the Canadas.
The last portion of this journal 
read before the Society, chiefly related to the botanical aspect of the 
country immediately to the westward of Kingston ; the indigenous 
thorns and their fitness for forming hedges being particularly describ- 
ed.
Fi'om Kingston, the party crossed Lake Ontario to Rochester, 
situated on the American side, a few miles above the mouth of the 
Genessee river ; considerable tracts of shallow water extend for some 
distance on either side of this river, in which the wild rice grew more 
luxuriantly than had been hitherto observed.
Proceeding upwards, 
the river becomes narrower but deep, having beautifully wooded banks 
rising about a hundred and fifty feet on either side, covered chiefly 
with oaks, elms, hickories, beeches and birches, interspersed with 
hemlock spruces, white pines and Arbor-vitaes of large size.
On the 
north bank, the black snake-root {Actcea ramosa) was abundant, its 
long spikes of white flowers having a singular efiect beneath the shade 
of the trees.
It was not seen on the south bank, but in its place con- 
siderable quantities of Gerardia flava and G, quercifolia were noticed, 
all richly clothed with flowers ; here also several extensive groups of 
buckthorns [Hipijophae canadensis) were observed, each plant form- 
ing a large silvery looking bush, and when backed by the dark ever- 
green trees gave a picturesque effect to the landscape.
Crossing Lake Ontario again to Toronto, on the Canadian side, a 
great difference in the vegetation was remarked.
Here, for the first 
time in Canada, healthy specimens of weeping willows, locust-trees, 
and Canadian and Lombardy poplars, were met with ; and, for the 
first time in the country, a native forest of Pinus resinosa : the trees 
composing this forest were very tall, but none of the stems measured, 
exceeded two feet in diameter.
Many detached specimens of the 
black birch or mountain mahogany [Betula lenta) were also seen ; 
this is described by Mr. M'Nab as a finely shaped tree, with a wide 
spreading top, much resembling the beech-trees of Britain â€” the stems 
159 
averaged about two feet in diameter.
Here also Monarda fistulosa 
and Spiranthes tortilis were found â€” the latter very sparingly and for 
the first time.
They next directed their attention to the Peninsula of Toronto, ly- 
ing about two and a half miles from the city, across an arm of the lake.
The soil is poor and sandy, interspersed with marshes.
Several spe- 
cies of trees of dwarfish growth were scattered about, the most re- 
markable being the rose or cone-gall willow {Salix conifera) ; of this 
many fine specimens were observed, the branches generally terminated 
by silvery, cone-like excrescences, supposed to be occasioned by in- 
sects â€” which, with the silvery whiteness of the foliage, gave the plants 
a remarkable appearance.
Several other species of willows were no- 
ticed on these sandy plains, but none of them appeared to be infested 
with insects, although the appearance here described is not peculiar 
to the above species.
The Arbutus Uva-ursi covered considerable 
tracts : the Canadian plant is larger than the British, and even differs 
slightly from that found in the United States ; it is called by the In- 
dians Sacacotitis, they smoke the leaves, and believe them to possess 
excellent medicinal properties.
Few herbaceous plants were picked 
in bloom, with the exception of Rudbeckia hirta, which was in great 
abundance, although described by American authors as an inhabitant 
of the Southern States.
Dracocephalum virginianum, by no means 
an abundant plant in Canada, Niagara Falls being the station given in 
botanical books, but there Mr. M'Nab failed to find it : its principal 
habitats are the mountain meadows of Virginia and Carolina : Linum 
virginianum, Cyperus flavescens and C.
castaneus, Silene Antirrhina, 
Scutellaria pai^vula and Lathyrus palustris.
On dry loose sand, by 
the edge of the lake, Euphorbia polygonifolia was abundant ; while 
in marshy places Lobelia Kalmii formed the greatest part of the vege- 
tation, and was profusely covered with its rich blue flowers.
Specimens of the most remarkable plants were exhibited to the 
meeting.

MICROSCOPICAL SOCIETY OF LONDON.
March 19, 1845.
â€” Prof.
Bell, F.R.S., &c..
President, in the chair.
Read, a paper by Edwin Lankester, M.D., F.L.S., B.S.E., &c., "On 
some abnormal forms of Fungi, with Remarks on their Morphology." 
The Fungus which led to these remarks, was found by Dr. Lankester 
in the neighbourhood of Cheshunt, in December, 1844.
It was a spe- 
cimen of Agaricus personatus, which was in a decaying state, from 
the effects of a previous frost.
It exhibited in all its parts a normal 
structure, with the exception of the pileus, in the centre of which, im- 
mediately over the insertion of the stipes into the hymenium, a second 
and smaller hymenium was developed.
The gills of this were appa- 
rent, and presented towards the light, and its edges were covered with 
a pileus, which gradually united itself with that of the lower hyme- 
nium.
There was, however, no appearance of any development of a 
stipes.
On making a section of the whole plant, no connexion be- 
tween the lower and upper hymenium was discoverable, so that the 
latter was evidently an independent development.
Although too dry 
to exhibit under the microscope much of the pecuHarity of structure of 
this class of bodies, sufficient was seen to prove that, whatever might 
have been the character of the lower or normal hymenium, the upper 
one was of precisely the same nature.
In accounting for this appear- 
ance, Dr. Lankester considered that in the Fungi, the pileus and sti- 
pes were to be regarded as the representatives of the leaves, or nutri- 
tive organs in the higher plants, and the hymenium as the analogue 
of the flower, or reproductive organs, and consequently, that the influ- 
ence of cold, or of some o*ther external agent, causing an arrest of the 
development in the vegetable tissue of the Fungus, would be attended 
with the development of reproductive tissue, such as we know occurs 
under similar circumstances in the higher forms of plants.
That this 
view of the office of the parts is correct, he considered might be made 
out by passing from the Fungi to the lichens, from these to the Hepa- 
ticae, mosses and ferns, in which the green parts are undoubtedly the 
nutritive tissue of the plant, and the analogues of the leaves.
In the 
Fungi, however, it should appear that the whole body must be looked 
upon as the analogue of the flower in the higher plants, the thallus 
being, in this family, at its minimum of development.
Hence, then, 
just as the calyx and corolla stand in the relation of nutritive organs 
to the more especially reproductive stamens and pistils, so the pileus 
and stipes stand in a similar relation to the hymenium.

On the TJieory of " Progressive Development^'' applied in explana- 
tion of the Origin and Transition of Species.
By Hewett C.
Watson, Esq., F.L.S.
(Continued from p.
147).
In my former remarks on this subject, I left, for a separate commu- 
nication, the " crucial" inquiry about any facts directly in proof of a 
transition of species, one into or from another.
Theoretically, a spe- 
cies comprehends all the individual plants which are descendants (or 
might have been descendants) from a single progenitor, how wide so- 
ever their differences may have become in course of many descents.
Practically, this idea of a species is utterly disregarded by the bota- 
nists who describe and give names to plants ; scarce any of them ever 
trying a single experiment, in order to ascertain whether species A 
can or cannot be raised from the seed of species B.
With botanists 
the practical inquiry is merely a search for some one or more physi- 
cal characters, usually those of shape or proportion, suflBciently obvi- 
ous to be readily seen in dried specimens, and sufficiently uniform to 
become marks whereby to distinguish the plants.
If such characters 
can be found, the plants are described as distinct species ; and this 
is done, even although only " a single specimen, and that none of the 
best," has been seen by the describer.
That potent organ in the brain, 
called by phrenologists the " Love-of- Approbation," or (better name) 
" Love-of-Notoriety," stimulates many of our botanists to seek out 
even the most trifling differences, upon which to found a pretence 
for " making a new species," and giving it a name.
This circum- 
stance, together with the frequent change-naming and cross-naming 
of plants, has rendered it customary of late, to add also the surname 
of the botanist who first applied to any plant the technical name by 
which it is designated.
This addition of the botanist's own name 
should have removed much of the uncertainty occasioned by changes 
and misapplications of names of plants.
Unfortunately, by giving a 
powerful stimulus to the Love-of-Notoriety organ, the custom has 
tended greatly to increase the confusion and uncertainty of plant-no- 
menclature.
The consequence now is, that we have many gradations of species â€” 
so to speak.
Some species are universally admitted distinct by all 
botanical authorities ; as Betula alba and Betula nana.
Other spe- 
cies are received as such by the majority, though questioned by some 
few ; as Primula veris and Primula vulgaris.
With regard to others, 
opinions may be held equally balanced or thereabouts ; as Ranuncu- 
VoL.

162 
lus aquatilis and Ranunculus circinatus.
Many more are deemed va- 
rieties by the majority, while the minority (one, two, three, or more) 
describe them to be species ; as Alchemilla alpina and Alchemilla 
conjuncta.
The step from those plants which are allowed by all to be simply 
varieties, into others which only very few botanists (perhaps only a sin- 
gle botanist) suppose to be distinct species, must be a very small step 
indeed.
And once among these dubious species, we may ascend, step 
by step, from the least to the most generally admitted.
A single step 
more, and we arrive at the universally admitted species.
At which, 
of all these little steps, are we to find the impassable barrier between 
varieties and species ?
Where does the possibility of transition cease, 
and the impossibility succeed ?
Notwithstanding a mere theoretical definition, never really applied 
by way of test to one species in a thousand, the assumed difference 
between species and varieties, the capability or incapability of transi- 
tion, is simply conjectural â€” an unproved idea of the mind â€” a.petitio 
principii.
The assumption is so far a safe one, that it never can be 
disproved, never can be put to a test which would be conceded by its 
believers.
Could any one raise a beech tree from the acorn of an oak, 
the botanists might fall back on their theoretical definition, and argue 
that the fact only proved the beech and oak to be varieties of one sin- 
gle species.
While the transitionist, on the other hand, would feel 
himself entitled to put forward the fact as a confirmation of his views; 
namely, that one species could give origin to another different species.
No doubt so wide a transition as that of an oak into a beech, were 
it possible, would shake the faith even of the most unreasoning bota- 
nist.
But it is equally an arbitrary assumption on the part of botanists, 
to say that a cowslip and primrose are proved varieties of a single 
species, if one can be raised from the seeds of the other.
The dis- 
tinction is one of degree only ; the oak and beech being more dissi- 
milar, the cowslip and primrose less dissimilar.
Still, the tendency of like to produce like, is so evident and decided 
throughout the best understood operations of Nature, that botanists 
may reasonably call on the transitionist to prove, if he can, that the 
exceptions to this tendency may extend so far as species.
On the 
other side, the transitionist may plead that he should not be required 
to show cases of change between very dissimilar species ; but that he 
creates a presumption in favour of his views, when he adduces instan- 
ces of transition in plants which are held to be distinct species by 
botanists of acknowledged skill and reputation.
163 
I must now become, temporarily, a sort of advocate for the traiisi- 
tionist, in adducing some examples which look very like cases of 
transition.
Assuredly I can bring none so wide as the alleged con- 
version of the rye into the oat; which, I may safely assert, is credited 
by extremely few botanists.
But facts of minor conversion are not 
altogether wanting ; and if more diligently looked for, they might be 
found more numerous than is at present supposed to be the case.
Viola canina [Linn.) and Viola flavicornis {Smith).
â€” The dog's 
violet is the commonest species of its genus in Britain.
Being found 
under very diflferent conditions of soil, shelter, humidity, &c., it runs 
into several varieties; so that the line between this one and allied 
species (so reputed) is drawn differently by botanical authorities.
One 
of these (species or varieties, as opinions may run) is the Viola flavi- 
cornis of Smith â€” not the dwarf variety figured under this latter name 
in ' English Botany ' (2736) ; but the one described in ' English Flo- 
ra,' and specimens of which are preserved in Smith's herbarium.
The 
V. flavicornis grows on open commons, and it presents several differ- 
ences of physical character, when compared with the ordinary forms 
of V.
canina which are seen in coppices and hedge-rows.
The dif- 
ferences are not very strong, yet are quite as wide as those which are 
deemed sufficient to distinguish species in the same genus, or those 
in other genera.
It has been stated, also, that these peculiarities re- 
main unchanged in living specimens after removal into a garden.
1 
have not found this stated fact to hold true with a plant brought into 
my own garden.
An example of V.
flavicornis was removed from a 
common in Surrey, into my garden, when flowering, in 1841.
Being 
absent in the summer of 1842, 1 did not see it during that season ; 
but in 1843 and 1844, it had assumed so much the size and shape ol 
leaf, with other peculiarities which belong to V.
canina, as to be bare- 
ly (if at all) distinguishable from some forms of the latter, when press- 
ed and dried.
Moreover, I have raised plants in a flower-pot, from 
the seeds of a wild example of V.
flavicornis, which came still nearer 
to the more usual form of V.
canina than did the changed garden 
plant.
In neither case, has the typical form of V.
canina been fully 
acquired â€” perhaps, it was not to be expected so rapidly ; but toge- 
ther with a series of wild specimens in my herbarium, they suffice as 
links of connexion between the two reputed species.
Polygonum maritimum {Linn.) and Polygonum Raii {Bab.) â€” The 
plant which is now becoming familiar under the name of Polygonum 
Raii, has been imperfectly known to the botanists of England for 
many years.
About the year 1831, when a very young botanist, I was 
164 
struck by the difference between this plant and P.
aviculare, with 
which it had previously been associated ; but the specimens then sent 
to the author of the ' British Flora,' were placed as a variety of P.
aviculare, in the second or third edition of that work.
In the fifth 
edition, it appears as a distinct species, under the name of P.
Roberti; 
but the identity of our plant with the P, Roberti of the continent be- 
ing doubtful, Mr. Babington has described it under the name of P.
Raii.
I am not aware that any botanical author has yet concuiTed 
with me in deeming it rather a variety of P.
maritimum, than of P.
aviculare.
Those who do not believe it a variety of P.
aviculare, hold 
it a proper species.
P. Raii is technically distinguished by the few 
and unbranched nerves of its short ochreae, the long internodes, loose- 
ly trailing habit and annual root.
In P.
maritimum the ochreae are 
longer, with more numerous and branching nerves, the internodes ve- 
ry short, the root perennial, and the plant forming a suberect close 
bush.
Yet the seeds of the true P.
maritimum, collected in the Azores 
and sown in my garden, produced plants in 1843, which partook 
much of the physical characters of P.
Raii from the shores of Britain.
They had the loosely trailing growth and long internodes of P.
Raii, 
though nearer to P.
maritimum in their ochreae ; and they proved an- 
nual in this climate.
Other examples, raised from the seeds ripened 
in 1843, had rather reverted back again towards P.
maritimum in the 
drier and warmer summer of 1844 ; having their ochreae larger, inter- 
nodes shorter, and leaves broader and more coriaceous, than was the 
case in the examples of 1843.
Further experiments will require to be 
made on these plants ; but I may mention one circumstance which will 
show that the general appearance of my garden plants, of 1843, approx- 
imated to that of the British P.
Raii.
One specimen was sent by post 
to a well-known Professor of Botany, who has collected P.
Raii in its 
native localities, with a request that he would name the specimen.
His reply was " P.
Raii." I wish that some kind botanist would send 
me ripe seeds of P.
Raii, for a trial how near this could be brought to 
P. maritimum.
Lolium perenne [Linn.) and Lolium multiflonim [Lam.) â€” English 
agriculturists have latterly been sowing the Lolium multiflorum, which 
they call " Italian Ryegrass," instead of the better known L.
perenne 
of Britain.
That there is some decided difference between the two 
species, and that this difference is perpetuated by seed, may be infer- 
red from the preference shown for the Italian ryegrass.
The most 
conspicuous distinction between them, botanically speaking, occurs 
in the awned paleae of L.
multiflorum.
Besides this, the spikelets are 
165 
composed of more numerous flowers, whence the specific name ; and 
the plant is usually of a paler colour and more upright growth.
It 
has been stated, as a further distinction, that the L.
multiflorum is 
annual, producing no " barren shoots." On examining this grass in 
sown fields, I have found a very large proportion of the plants corre- 
sponding with the alleged characters of the species ; but I have also 
found among them examples in exception to each one of the distinc- 
tive characters in turn; some having the awns very small or obsolete; 
some having fewer flowers in the spikelets than L.
perenne ; some 
producing barren shoots, &c.
About Midsummer, 1843, I transplant- 
ed a root from a sown field of L.
multiflorum, into a small flower-pot ; 
cutting down the flower-stems, and supplying the plant rather spar- 
ingly with water.
It grew rapidly, soon filled the flower-pot with its 
roots, and again produced flowering-stems in September and October.
The flowers were now less numerous than usual in the spikelets of L.
perenne, and were scarcely awned at all.
This same plant lived 
through the winter in the flower-pot, and was transplanted into the 
open ground in spring.
In the summer of 1844, it grew into a strong 
tuft, producing many flowering stems, with numerous flowers in the 
spikelets, bearing very short awns ; also many barren shoots ; the co- 
lour of the whole plant being equally deep green as that of L.
perenne.
It was scarcely distinguishable fi-om L.
perenne, except by its short 
awns â€” if this can be deemed a distinction, for L.
perenne is occasion- 
ally awned in Britain.
My observations and experiments upon this 
grass were intended to try the constancy of its distinctive characters ; 
and thus the case is left short of full transition, although the changes 
went so far as to give a strong presumption in favour of the possibi- 
lity of transition.
Primula veris (Linn.) and Primula vulgaris [Huds.) â€” In my second 
paper on the present subject, I cited some examples of two reputed 
species being so connected by intermediate varieties, as to (muse dif- 
ficulty in tracing any clear line of distinction between them.
One of 
these examples was found in the cowslip and primrose, which are closely 
connected by intermediate varieties, usually called oxlips.
These va- 
rieties occur under such circumstances as create a presumption that 
they are the offspring of one or both of the two species mentioned.
I 
have lately proved by direct experiment, that the seeds of an oxlip, 
all taken from the same plant, at the same time, and sown together, 
will produce a mingled assemblage of cowslips, oxlips and primroses; 
the oxlips forming a series of intermediate forms, passing into the 
cowslips at one extremity of the series, and into the primroses at the 
166 
other extremity.
I hope shortly to publish a detailed account of this 
experiment, and shall therefore not give more exact particulars here.
I had expected to obtain primroses and oxlips, but had not antici- 
pated the occurrence of cowslips also.
It is true, the recorded expe- 
riments of Herbert and Henslow might have led me to expect the 
result which appeared ; but I may now confess a lurking suspicion 
that some unascertained cause of error had been at work in their ex- 
periments.
And since Hooker, Babington, and other botanists still 
continued to describe the cowslip and primrose as two distinct spe- 
cies, I may presume that they were also sceptical on the point.
Now 
I can see only a choice between two inferences ; namely, that the 
cowslip and primrose are a single species only, or, that one species 
can pass into the other in two descents â€” the oxlip being the interme- 
diate step.
The experiments of Herbert and Henslow show the cows- 
lip passing into the primrose in one descent.
Festuca pratensis (Huds.) and Festuca loliacea {Huds.) â€” For half 
a century past, it has been customary with British botanists, to de- 
scribe the Festuca pratensis and F.
loliacea as two distinct species.
The difference between them has appeared so strong in the eyes of 
some botanists, as to warrant them in placing F.
loliacea under ano- 
ther genus (Brachypodium).
In Steudel's Nomenclator, which bears 
the date of 1841, they are entered as distinct species ; as also in the 
Catalogue published the same year for the Botanical Society of Edin- 
burgh.
I had, however, seen some evidences that one could change 
into the other, before the Edinburgh Catalogue was published ; and 
in the same year of 1841, I brought a wild root of F.
loliacea into my 
garden.
Though planted in close unworked soil, it had become a 
large tuft by 1 843, and in the summer of that year it produced nume- 
rous flowering stems.
Some of the stems retained almost exactly the 
character ("spiked raceme") which distinguishes the wild F.
loliacea; 
while ot]fers of them had so far assumed the branched or panicled in- 
florescence of F.
pratensis, that a botanist would assuredly have as- 
signed them to F.
pratensis, unless informed that they had been taken 
from a root of F.
loliacea, or shown the intermediate forms, which 
were also produced from the same root.
A root of F.
pratensis, re- 
moved into the same garden, became in 1843 rather less like F.
lolia- 
cea, than it was in its wild state ; but in the dry summer of 1844, some 
of its panicles were reduced nearly into racemes.
I have also seen 
these two reputed species pretty closely connected in a series of wild 
specimens, collected by Mr. Tatham, in the neighbourhood of Settle.
In this case, F.
loliacea appears to become F.
pratensis simply by 
167 
increased luxuriance, which is favoured by the free space allowed to 
it in the garden.
Tolpis umbellata {Bert.) and Tolpis crinita {Lowe).â€”Tho^e charac- 
ters which are sufficient to warrant the assignment of plants to two 
different genera, should be of a more important kind than are the cha- 
racters which suffice only to distinguish two species of the same ge- 
nus.
In the Prodromus of DeCandolle, the Tolpis umbellata and T.
crinita, though brought under the same genus, are assigned to differ- 
ent sections of their genus.
These sections represent the genera of 
other authors, Drepania and Schmidtia, founded on differences in the 
pappus of the fruit, akin to those which separate Thrincia from Leon- 
todon.
In the year 1842, I collected specimens and seeds of Tolpis 
crinita in the Azores.
The specimens corresponded with one from 
Madeira, which was given to me under the same name by Dr. C.
Le- 
mann, who has enjoyed the best opportunities for becoming well ac- 
quainted with Mr. Lowe's plants.
The seeds were sown in my garden, 
and produced plants which I could refer only to T.
umbellata, I com- 
municated one of these living examples to Dr. Lemann, and he wrote 
me that the plant was T.
umbellata ; thus corroborating my own view 
of them, and showing that Tolpis (Drepania) umbellata and Tolpis 
(Schmidtia) crinita are not permanently distinct species â€” much less 
distinct genera.
This instance, if so explained, may be considered a 
case of unnecessary " hair-splitting " in the formation of genera.
Or, 
on the other side, the transitionist may argue that characters which 
have been deemed sufficient to separate genera, may be acquired and 
lost in such manner as should throw doubt on the supposed impassa- 
ble distinctions of species.
Orchidaceous genera.
â€” Mr. Schomburgk published a paper in the 
Linnean Transactions, to show that orchidaceous epiphytes, referred 
to three different genera by first-rate authorities in this order, could 
change into or produce one another.
One of the plants " produced a 
scape with six flowers of Monachanthus viridis and two of the Myan- 
thus barbatus, while a second scape of the same bulb had twenty-five 
blossoms of the Myanthus barbatus." The same combination of ge- 
nera occurred on a second plant in another collection.
A third plant 
produced the flowers of Monachanthus viridis at one period, and 
those of Catasetum tridentatum at another time.
And on Mr. Bach 
sowing the seeds of Monachanthus viridis, one among the plants pro- 
duced a scape with the flowers of Catasetum tridentatum.
Here, also, 
it may be said that the plants had been incorrectly described as dif- 
ferent species and genera.
But the fact still shows that cases of tran- 
168 
sition can occur, where the differences were so wide that a first-rate 
botanical authority deemed the plants to be not only specifically, but 
even generically, distinct.
In fact, nothing less than the actually ob- 
served transition would have caused botanists to unite the three into 
one species.
Among the cellular plants there are instances alleged, which, if 
correct, would establish the possibility of transition fi-om one order to 
another.
Perhaps, not much stress should be laid on these instances 
at present.
I do not know that stronger examples than the preceding 
can be adduced from the vascular plants.
Their tendency is in favour 
of the theory of transition ; although, from admitting of a different 
explanation in each example, they do not yield unquestionable evi- 
dence in support of that theory.
I will not write more on the subject just now; though it may per- 
haps be desirable to add two or three pages more, on a future occa- 
sion, for a short summary of the leading arguments, on both sides of 
the question.
I have curtailed argument as much as possible, under 
the idea that the reasoning faculties are so poorly developed in bota- 
nists (as a class â€” but with exceptions) that very few of them will feel 
any interest, or see any importance, in such an inquiry.
The idea of 
its bearing in any way on the moral condition of the human race, will 
doubtless appear ridiculous before the eyes of nineteen in twenty bota- 
nists.
But slender as may be his knowledge of plants, the author 
of the ' Vestiges ' can see much farther than this into Nature and 
Nature's laws.

Note on Luzula congesta, (Smith).
By Thomas Bentall, Esq.
Mr. Babington, contrary to the opinion entertained by some other 
botanists, still considers this to be a distinct species ; and describes 
it in his Manual under the name of Luzula multiflora, {Lej.) The 
characters by which Mr. B.
distinguishes it from L.
campestris, are 
the greater comparative length of the filaments, and the oblong (not 
reniform) seeds.
The following remark is appended to the descrip- 
tion : â€” "I introduce this as a species, in order to draw attention to 
the character which appears to distinguish it from li.
campestris, that 
its constancy may be ascertained." It appears to me that there has 
been some misunderstanding connected with these plants.
In the 
' British Flora ' it is stated that both grow together, which I believe is 
rarely the case, as L.
campestris abounds most in open meadows and 
169 
pastures, whilst L.
congesta prefers woods and shady places, and has 
always seemed to me to preserve a very distinct appearance.
Per- 
haps some of the readers of the ' Phytologist ' may feel inclined to 
examine them minutely during the present season, and will commu- 
nicate some information respecting them.
The seeds will probably be 
found to afford a good distinguishing character ; should they be de- 
siderata with any of your readers, I should feel very happy in supply- 
ing them.

Note on Equisetiim hyemale.
By J.
B. B rich an, Esq.
You will remember that in my first paper regarding Equisetum 
hyemale &c.
(Phytol.
i. 374), I mentioned the existence of a " pile of 
cones," which I found on the top of the stems.
Subsequent observa- 
tion has led me to the following conclusions.
A young stem, of about 
half an inch in height, consisting apparently of one sheath, contains, 
as you are aware, the embryos of all the sheaths which compose the 
full-grown stem.
In this stage it exhibits a conical termination, 
which is composed of the black appendages tei'med teeth united into 
one.
As the second sheath rises out of the first, it carries with it this 
cone, into which, of course, its own teeth, coalescing in a similar man- 
ner, are inserted.
And thus each sheath, as it emerges from its enve- 
lope, carries atop the matured and withered and conically united teeth 
of all that have grown before it, until at last the "pile of cones" ap- 
pears on the top of the full-grown stem, and either falls off before the 
catkin appears, or is by it cast down from its somewhat singular emi- 
nence.
These remarks are confirmed by the fact, that the uppermost 
cone is the largest, and that the cones decrease in size as they ap- 
proach the apex of the stem.
The rationale, if I may be allowed the 
expression, of this curious elevating process, I must leave to be ex- 
plained by more able botanists.
I am satisfied that the account I give 
of it is correct : and I think it goes far to prove that Equisetum hye- 
male at least is distinct from E.
Mackaii and variegatum as a species.

The true signification of the term " recurvus" 
By Hewett C.
Watson, Esq., F.L.S.
With due deference to the able individuals whose opinions on this 
word are recorded in the ' Phytologist,' I would suggest that all of 
them are correct, although too limited in their definitions of the term 
"recurvus." The value of the prefix "re" may be expressed tolera- 
bly well by the words " back " and " again," when used in the sense 
of a change from the actual course of things to one which is contrary 
thereto.
In passive objects (as distinguished from events) a change 
from the usual state or direction seems to be implied by the use of re.
It may thus signify "upwards," "downwards," "outwards," or "back- 
wards," whichsoever of these is contrary to the usual direction.
Some examples may make this more clear.
A curve in the bill 
of birds usually brings the tip downwards ; but the upward bend in 
the bill of the avocet, being in the contrary direction, is expressed by 
calling it " recurved." The antennae of insects usually extend for- 
wards from the head ; but if so curved that the direction of the tip is 
reversed and turned backwards, they are called "recurved." The 
leaves of plants usually ascend from the bases by which they are at- 
tached to a stem ; but when this direction is so far reversed that the 
tips of the leaves point downwards, they are said to be "recurved" or 
reflexed.
In feras, there is usually some convexity of the upper sur- 
face, the edges of the frond bending downwards ; but if the direction 
of the edges becomes reversed and turned upwards, which is contrary 
to the usual direction, the term "recurved" will here correctly express 
the change.
By a larger definition of the term " recurvus," so as to include any 
direction contrary to the usual or principal direction, it will take in 
all the special examples, whether their curves are upwards, down- 
wards, outwards or backwards.
The name "concava" really appears less aptly given to Mr. Bree's 
fern ; since it does not necessarily imply a concavity of the upper 
surface.
A hat and a wine-glass are each concave, though the con- 
cavity is upwards in one, downwards in the other ; but the brim of an 
English hat, as well as that of a champagne-glass, is recurved, because 
it is bent in a direction contrary to the principal and usual concavity 
of hats and wine-glasses.

On the duration of Rubus discolor.
By Thomas Meehan, Esq.
In Dr. Salter's ' Observations on the Genus Rubus,' inserted in the 
Mai-ch number (Phytol.
ii.
87), I observe that considerable uncertainty 
exists in the botanical world respecting the age to which the shoots 
of these plants attain.
The general opinion seems to be, that they 
are biennial ; but, as Dr. Salter observes, some of them live for a much 
longer period.
There is growing in a hedge-bank adjoining a wood 
at St. Clare, a plant of Rubus discolor ; the main stem of which, to 
my knowledge, is seven years old: it may possibly be older, but I have 
observed there for that time.
It is above three inches in circumfer 
ence, and at about four feet from the ground branches out into a large 
head, which, being entangled in that of an adjacent willow, is sup- 
ported by it.
There is a quantity of dead biennial wood, but of no 
other age, among the rest, which seems to me to afford good ground 
for a conjecture, that if the wood live above two years, it will live for 
an indefinite period.
The tree is otherwise healthy, and budding 
well.

Remarks on Calamintha sylvatica, (Bromfield).
By T.
Bell Salter, M.D., F.L.S.
Having now for nearly two years observed with much interest and 
some little attention that most remarkable and truly beautiful addition 
to our Flora, which was made by my friend Dr. Bromfield, in August, 
1843, by the discovery in this island of the Calamintha sylvatica, no- 
tices of which have appeared in former numbers of the ' Phytologist,' 
I am myself induced to offer a few remarks on the same plant.
The 
last account given by Dr. Bromfield, in the February number (Phytol.
ii.
49) was so extremely clear, that it would appear to leave little to 
be said on the same subject.
The opinion of many of the most emi- 
nent botanists in the country, who received early specimens of the 
plant, that it was only a variety of Calamintha officinalis, produced 
by growing in shady situations, was at first so decidedly and strongly 
held by them, that I cannot but think that the testimony of one who 
has watched it attentively in its native wood, for both two flowering 
and two springing seasons, may be of some interest.
Added to this, 
however, I am able to give some account of its behaviour under cul- 
172 
tivation, and what is more decisive, under precisely similar circum- 
stances with its ally, C officinalis.
I shall confine my remarks to 
what I have myself observed ; and it will be seen that my observations 
are entirely in confirmation of the opinions expressed by my friend 
its discoverer.
A single glance at the plant growing in its natural 
habitat, would satisfy any observer of its distinctness from C.
offici- 
nalis ; and it is worthy of remark, that all who were able to visit the 
station, held this opinion from the first, while all the eminent bota- 
nists to whom dried specimens were sent, came to the contrary con- 
clusion.
Different as are the habits of the two species, it appeared 
difficult at first to find distinctive characters between them, such as 
should be explicit and easily recognized from description.
These, 
however, have been subsequently detected, and are perfectly sufficient 
to mark the specific distinctness of the two plants.
Dr. Bromfield 
(Phytol.
ii.
51) mentions the circumstance of my having pointed out 
to him one of these characters, namely, the difference of the roots in 
respect to creeping stolons ; and in their habits in this particular will 
be found the principal difference between the two plants, which is 
available for descriptive distinction : â€” the characters on this point 
being absolute, whereas, the others, striking as they appear when the 
plants are viewed together, are yet only comparative.
Dr. Bromfield, 
in his excellent and elaborate description, does not, however, in giv- 
ing the habit of the root of his species, describe its peculiarity quite 
to its full extent.
He speaks of its " sending out one or more under- 
ground runners or stolons," whereas, in fact, it sends them out very 
numerously, and sometimes literally by dozens.
Presuming that the mode of growth of the common calamint (C.
officinalis), which is truly suffrutescent, the lower part of the stem be- 
ing woody and persistent, and throwing out each spring new upper 
shoots, but never producing stolons, â€” presuming that the habit of 
this, the common species is generally known, I shall only proceed to 
detail the mode of growth in the new species.
In Calamintha sylvatica may be detected, at the time of flowering, 
numerous stolons, some running underground, and some visible above, 
and a few low trailing branches.
After the infloi-escence has passed, 
these low trailing branches continue to grow in an ascending form, 
and finally terminate, in the early winter, with a little tuft of folded 
leaves or false bracteas, such as those which may be so frequently seen 
in the autumn in Glechoma and some of our perennial species of Ve- 
ronica.
The mode of growth above described, will be allowed to be 
very different from that of C.
officinalis.
173 
During the winter the ascending shoots perish, together with a con- 
â–  siderable portion of the stolons ; the latter probably in proportion to 
the amount of protection which the plant may happen to receive, and 
the severity of the winter, but as far as I have yet observed, the great- 
er portion of the plant which is above ground perishes.
In the early 
spring the underground stolons begin to shoot, and the young plants 
sprout up all around the former stems, â€” some of them at a distance 
of many inches, sometimes as many as six ; but the base of the old 
stem has not the slightest remaining vitality.
I have planted in my 
garden both species, and under similar circumstances they both pre- 
serve their characters and habits, the only difference 1 observe being 
that with C.
sylvatica, when growing in bare mould, where the protec- 
tion of moss, leaves and dead twigs is wanting, which is so abundant 
in its native copse, not only nearly, but quite the whole of the super- 
ficial stolons perish in the winter.
This plant is so ornamental, that it appears fully desirable to adopt 
it in cultivation.
The difficulty of succeeding in the cultivation of 
some of our native plants, which yet grow freely and abundantly in 
their natural condition, is sometimes so great, that perhaps some ac- 
count of my first attempt with the plant, the subject of these remarks, 
may be worth recording, particularly as some of the consequent chan- 
ges are rather interesting.
Young plants spring so numerously from 
the stolons, that they may be readily multiplied by merely dividing 
them : in addition to this, any early top or branch may be readily 
rooted, and seedlings also spring up abundantly around the old plant, 
so that it is most easily propagated.
If any of the young plants be 
placed in a shaded part of a garden, they retain the characters natural 
to the wild plant ; but in altered circumstances they undergo consi- 
derable modifications â€” yet not such as influence the essential habits 
and characters of the plants.
The results of altered circumstances of 
two kinds I have noticed, and shall proceed to detail.
If placed in a sunny border, the whole plant is much shorter, the 
inflorescence bears a larger proportion to the foliage, while the indi- 
vidual flowers acquire a much deeper tint.
The plant however loses 
much of its elegance, assumes an unhealthy appearance, and its dura- 
tion is very much diminished.
These effects are probably due to an 
increase of both light and evaporation.
When, however, it is sub- 
jected to an increased abundance of light, but without a greater de- 
gree of evaporation, as, for instance, under glass, where it will most 
readily grow in a pot of rich mould, the effect is very remarkable.
Under these circumstances it becomes a most ornamental plant, â€” 
174 
retaining the full vigour of health, while the inflorescence is immense- 
ly increased, and a succession of flowers is constantly reproduced 
from the same verticillaster for a period of six weeks.
The number 
of flowers thus produced on one plant, is truly immense.
As a plant 
for the greenhouse, it is well worth the notice of floriculturists.
To those readers of the ' Phytologist ' who may be residing in Lon- 
don, or visiting the metropolis, it may be well to mention an opportu- 
nity of seeing this plant growing under circumstances which, a priori, 
I should conclude would veiy little change its habits.
My friend, 
Mr. Edward Newman, has had fitted up a Ward's case at the Phy- 
tologist Office in Devonshire-street, for the purpose of keeping a set 
of ferns for reference and authentication ; and he has also introduced 
into this select company a few phanerogamous plants of interest, â€” 
our Calamintha amongst the number : thus giving botanists a conve- 
nient opportunity of witnessing, in a growing state, plants which 
otherwise many would be unable to see, except as dried specimens.
I 
feel that we are much indebted to Mr. Newman for this new boon, 
added to the many we have already received from the truly scientific 
discovery of my valued friend, the inventor of the glazed cases.

Comnients on some Observations by Dr. Bell Salter, on the Genus 
Rubus.
By Edwin Lees, Esq., F.L.S., &c.
I AM disposed to hail with pleasure every fellow-labourer in the 
thorny thicket, and have perused Dr. Bell Salter's observations on 
our Rubi with much interest ; and for the trouble he has taken to 
make out the Selborne species, by communication with eminent bota- 
nists, and his examination of the works of preceding observers, much 
credit is certainly due to him.
I should not therefore have responded 
on the present occasion, having rather a disinclination for controver- 
sy, which too often becomes as prickly as the bramble itself, had not 
the Doctor brought me out so prominently in his paper â€” first in 
agreement and lastly in discordance with my ideas, on which he has 
descanted freely, which he had a perfect right to do.
But this renders 
it absolutely necessary for me to explain one or two points, that seem 
to require elucidation ; the rest I leave to another occasion, when 1 
can enter more fully on the subject.
In the remarks I am about to make, I have not the slightest wish 
175 
to do otherwise than honour Dr. Bell Salter's powers of discrimma- 
tion; but I must say this, that no "three days'" nor even three years' 
observation of dried Rubi in herbaria, are sufficient to enable any per- 
son to speak with absolute confidence in doubtful or difficult cases, as 
to the specific distinctions of the fruticose brambles, who has not like- 
wise for many years narrowly watched them in a growing state.
This 
is a hard saying for railroad botanists, I confess, but in my own case, 
I will candidly say, prohatum est.
I have myself carefully regarded 
the subject for ten years, and am on some points doubtful even now.
Dr. B.
Salter has very handsomely expressed his general agreement 
from his own experience with my exhibition of the mode of growth of 
the British fruticose Rubi, contained in my paper in the ' Transactions 
of the Edinburgh Botanical Society,' but " takes the most decided 
exception" to the modification which habit exercises upon apparent 
specific character.
The Doctor has however altogether omitted to 
say what characters he considers unchangeable^ and what are varia- 
ble.
Now this is a point of the utmost importance in the enquiry, 
and on this everything hinges.
I fear it would take up too much 
space to go fully into the subject on the present occasion, but this, at 
least, my experience fully warrants me in affirming, that the glandu- 
losity of the panicle is not to be depended upon as an unalterable 
specific character in the Rubi.
Hence, strange as it may appear to 
Dr. B.
Salter, R.
radula may present itself without a gland^ and R.
suberectus exhibit abundance of them, contrary as this is to their cha- 
racter generally.
Indeed, I can state confidently, that I have traced 
R. caesius on the one hand from being moderately glandular, to a state 
profusely so, and on the other, to a variety where not a gland can be 
seen, even with a lens.
So in the form I have called R.
sublustris,* 
(equivalent to Smith's R.
corylifolius, and Leighton's " second form 
of R.
rhamnifolius"), where in a full sunny exposure abundant glands 
are induced on the panicle, peduncles and calyces, while in the shade 
the pubescence smothers and entirely obliterates the glands.
Even 
the barren stem is thus affected, the exclusion of light often prevent- 
ing the appearance of setae and glands, which a bright sun and power- 
ful temperature would call forth.
This fact should hint caution to the 
namers of dried specimens, and indeed collectors should be precise 
in stating whether their specimens were gathered in a sunny expo- 
sure or in the shade.
* This is substantially the same form as that I called R.
caenosus in the Edin- 
burgh Transactions, the name seeming more appropriate.
170 
Dr. Salter objects to my speaking of R.
dunietoruni as growing 
erect, but 1 meant relatively to the usually creeping R.
caesius, and 
had perhaps better have written assiirgent.
True enough, Weihe and 
Nees say technically, " caule procumbente ; " but these literal unac- 
commodating definitions perpetually mislead.
The stem would of 
course arch, trail, and root, if it could ; but, imprisoned in a stout 
hedge, it is impelled upwards, and cannot do so, and the very name, 
dumetorum, shows the idea of the plant raised from the ground and 
supported among bushes, which is usually the case â€” if a shoot es- 
capes, it of course arches and becomes deciiiTibent.
In alluding, then, 
to the " erect dumetorum," I refer to the plant as kept from being 
procumbent by circumstances ; and unquestionably, observation ge- 
nerally shows it to be supported, and thus it will flower at the top of 
the very highest hedge.
Very well, then, my deduction is this, made 
from hundreds of cases, that however convenient it is (and I admit it 
is so) to separate dumetorum from casius, still that the former is really 
a metamorphosis of the latter, the flowers being larger and more spe- 
cious, while the fruit is never so fine as in caesius, and is indeed most- 
ly abortive.
In fact, between caesius, laid low in a ditch, and dume- 
torum, elevated in excelsis, every possible variation may and does 
occur; and I have gathered specimens so nearly midway between 
them, that they were appropriable by either or both.* 
But there is some error, Dr. B.
Salter thinks, in my deriving the R.
diversifolius of Dr. Lindley also from caesius ; â€” let us see.
The old 
proverb says that " it is a wise son that knows his own father," and in 
Botany I shall be inclined to think in future, that it must be a wise 
father that knows his own son !
It is easy and pleasant enough to 
name a plant, but not so easy, perhaps, to know it again afterwards : 
this difl^iculty, I trust, will not ever accrue to Dr. Salter, with regard 
to his R.
Babingtonii.
We are at issue about the glandulosity of R.
diversifolius, and the Doctor wings me with an arrow from Mr. Bor- 
rer's quiver !
But with every respect to Mr. Borrer, surely the au- 
thority to be relied on in this case, for a correct decision, must be Dr.
Lindley.
Now, some years ago, when I was young in the study of 
Rubi, and with fewer thorns in my side than at present, making, I 
confess, but little progress with Lindley's ingenious but tantalizing 
* Dr. Salter's " decided exception " to this view of the case, seems rather strange, 
since Sir W.
J. Hooker originally made the dumetorum of W.
and N.
the /3.
cmsius of 
his Flora; and the discriminating editor of the new edition of 'English Botany,' says 
that " R.
dumetorum, W.
et N., is either a luxuriant variety of caesius, or as suggested 
by Lindley, synonymous with R.
corylifolius, Smith." 
177 
Synopsis, ray friend, Mr. W.
Allport Leigh ton, of Shrewsbury, the 
acute author of the elaborate ' Flora of Shropshire,' who was him- 
self then hardly out of the labyrinth, liberally supplied me with 
duplicates of all the species Dr. Ltndley had, himself, very kindly 
named for him ; and this courtesy of my friend's 1 ought the more 
gratefully to acknowledge, as it fairly set me up in the blackberry 
business, in which I have since embarked to some extent, though not 
without staining my fingers, and, for aught I know, ultimately leading 
me, as Dr. Salter seems inclined to think, into ruinous speculations !
However, among the suite of named Rubi thus obligingly forwarded 
me by Mr. Leighton, was " R.
diver sifoliiis,^'' thus absolutely from 
the very fingers and observation of Dr. Lindley himself.
This speci- 
men I still possess ; and both the barren stem and panicle are abun- 
dantly clothed with glands, and the former with setae.
But to go 
further than my specimen, and prove decidedly that R.
diversifolius 
is glandular, and was actually understood to be so both by Leighton 
and Lindley, 1 need only refer to the ' Flora of Shropshire,' which is 
not alluded to in the matter by Dr. B.
Salter.
Here, under R.
dume- 
torum, whose abundant glandulosity none will dispute, it is distinctly 
stated : " Specimens of this plant, submitted to Professor Lindley, 
were pronounced by him to be his R.
diversifolius.
Of similar spe- 
cimens, Mr. Borrer says â€” ' R.
dumetorum, W.
8f N.: I incline to 
refer it to R.
corylifolius, Sm., although, in some respects, it is more 
like R.
csesius.' "* Will any one be surprised, if, with these opi- 
nions, and under these circumstances â€” having traced R.
dumetorum 
as a derivative from caesius â€” I should come to the same conclusion 
with R.
diversifolius, represented by Leighton, and thus tacitly ad- 
mitted even by Mr. Borrer to be the same plant.
For, in the follow- 
ing paragraph, after stating that he had sent similar specimens, 
though from a different locality, to Nees von Esenbeck, who had 
named them R.
dumetorum, /3.
&c., Mr. Leighton goes on to say 
that from the latter locality, specimens were forwarded to Mr. Borrer 
with Esenbeck's remarks ; and " he also (that is Mr. Borrer) concurs 
in naming them R.
dumetorum, W.
& N., and identifies them with 
specimens rnarked by Lindley R.
diversifolius, Lind.
/" Now, what 
can be possibly plainer than this ?
As to the solitary specimen in 
Mr. BoiTcr's herbarium, which it appears is non-glandular, and which 
is rather cautiously said to be " as from the authentic bush, &c.," t 
as if it was not absolutely certain, although taken from some bush in 
* Leighton's ' Flora of Shropshire,' p.
238.

the Chiswick Garden, I cannot, of course, unravel its history, nor 
was I called upon to do it.
There was no difficulty apparent in my 
path ; but, surely.
Dr. Bell Salter â€” seeing the discrepancy between 
himself and me as to the glandulosity of R.
diversifolius, and seeing 
too, what Leigh ton has said on the subject, as I have quoted above, 
where Dr. Lindley himself is made to concur with dumetorum and 
diversifolius presenting no marks of difference from each other â€” 
really, I think when Dr. B.
Salter saw the aspect of the specimen, 
" as from the authentic bush," &c., before he founded any argument 
upon it as against me, he was bound to clear up the mystery there is 
in the affair.
For the fact is apparent, that either Dr. Lindley has 
mistaken his own plant, which I can scarcely conceive, its original 
character has been altered by cultivation, or Mr. Borrer's specimen is 
not " from the authentic bush." This latter may be, indeed, for aught 
I know to the contrary, R.
vestitus, ( W.
8^ N.) and yet not the true 
R. diversifolius, [Lind.) On this point I shall not dilate, because I 
have not seen the specimens Dr. Salter terms R.
vestitus, and which 
clearly are not the same I have had in view as R.
diversifolius, 
{Lind.) * But, after all, just to show how little a single specimen 
ought to be trusted, even from an " authentic bush," and how vary- 
ing and perplexing the glandulose brambles especially are, T may 
mention that the year before last I received a packet of Rubi to exa- 
mine, which had been gathered in Leicestershire by the Rev. A.
Bloxam.
A set of specimens, all collected at the same time and 
place, and from the same bush, in admirable order, were ticketed

var.
On comparison, the panicles approached very 
closely in character to â€” if not absolutely identical with â€” R.
Leightoni 
of Flor.
Shrops.
; but out of four, two were copiously glandular : in 
one the pubescence had overpowered the glands, and in the other no 
glands were discernible, even with a powei-ful lens !
Dr. Salter, I 
ought to say, observes absolutely of the specimen of Mr. Borrer he 
states to be R.
vestitus, {W.
8f N.) " which he had from Dr. Lind- 
ley's own plant in the Horticultural Gardens ;" but Mr. Borrer him- 
self, in Leighton, only says that he received it "Â«Â« from the au- 
* Is there any botanist resident in London, sufficiently interested about the point in 
dispute, or who will act as umpire, just to see if any specimens " from the authentic 
bush '' of R.
diversifolius are in the Linnean or Botanical Society's collections, and 
report thereon ; or if not, why not make a dash at " the authentic bush " itself 
in the Chiswick Garden ?
The thoughtful bystander may, perhaps, be tempted to 
answer with Gammon, in ' Ten Thousand a Year,'â€”" He'd let me scratch my hands 
in getting the blackberries, and then he'd come smiling in to eat 'em.'' 
179 
thentic bush," &c., but from or by whom no mention is made.
How- 
ever this may be, or with whomsoever any mistake in the matter may 
rest, with a glandulose specimen of R.
diversifolius before me, named 
by the original describer, and authenticated in Leighton's ' Flora,' I 
trust to be exonerated from being the propounder of error so far, and 
it remains to be seen if R.
diversifolius and R.
dumetorum be the 
same they were when Mr. Leighton's ' Flora ' was published in 1840.
Having, then, disposed of two of the points excepted to by Dr. B.
Salter, I come to the third, on which, he says, he is " equally scep- 
tical." Observation can alone decide here, but it must be the obser- 
vation of years.
My remarks had reference to Smith's R.
corylifo- 
lius,* to which, seeing the necessity of altering a name so prone to 
deceive, I had at first thought to give the appellation of cmnosus, but 
afterwards substituted sublustris as more applicable, from its usually 
large and often specious flowers, and under this name it appears in 
the Catalogue of Plants published by the London Botanical Society.
When I commenced my enquiries, I had some difficulty in procuring 
a true specimen of R.
corylifolius, [Linn.) ; but having at last received 
numerous brambles sent me from the Botanical Society, as well as 
from correspondents in various counties, the corylifolii soon swarmed 
about me, " thick as leaves in Vallambrosa," proving rather too nu- 
merous and unmanageable, so that I was actually obliged to billet 
them off through the whole series of forms from suberectus to 
casius.
I found, at last, that there was a form very nearly allied to 
R. cceskcs, as truly stated by the editor of the 2nd.
edit, of ' English 
Botany,' " being a much stouter plant in its general form, less humble 
in growth, the stems being rather arched than prostrate, with stronger 
and more uniform prickles and setae," t which technically could not 
be referred to R.
caesius, and which was very different from R.
dume- 
torum, ( W.
8f N.) This form I found to be exceedingly variable, 
sometimes glandular, but more frequently not so, the barren stem 
being angular, and always stouter than ccbsius, the leaves being 
always quinate, with a white tomentosity beneath.
But the most 
puzzling point respecting it was, that in the shade its barren stems 
were smooth and devoid of setae, though in full exposure to the sun 
* It must be noted that Weihe and Nees have no R.
corylifolius in their Rub.

the caesiau bloom was more or less obs'ious, with the usual character 
of numerous prickles scattered irregularly round the stem, with a few 
intermixed seta).
I sent a glandular specimen with remarkably large 
foliage to Mr. Leighton, who stated it to be the " second form of R.
rhamnifolius " of his Flora, differing as to the glands only, the Shrop- 
shire specimens having none.
This fact still further induced me to 
name and fix the position of so remarkable a form, which, though 
traceable to R.
caesius, and most certainly closely allied to it, has 
been considered even by Esenbeck as a variety of R.
rhamnifolius, 
as well as of ajfflnis.
For having obtained authentic specimens of 
y. affinis from Shropshire, (and indeed this very form had been named 
" probably R.
afjUnis " by Dr. Lindley in the first suite of specimens 
I had from Mr. Leighton some years ago), 1 soon found, on reference 
to other specimens and growing plants, that there was really a com- 
plete connexion between it and the " second form of R.
rhamni- 
folius ;" in short, that they were only varieties of one species ; and, 
therefore, I agree with Dr. Bell Salter that they must be combined.
Now, this is a point of difficulty got over ; but then, instead of 
classing them with affinis, I place them next to casius, under the 
name R.
sublustris.
The question would here arise, what is B.
affijiis, (W.
& N.) ?
Very few botanists seem to understand it, and the name, as is too 
often the case among the Rubi, is very bad and deceptive.
The affinity 
of the plant is stated by Weihe and Nees to be with R.
plicatus and 
fastigiatus (that is the suberect tribe), * and hence stouter specimens 
than usual of R.
suberectus or plicatus have been referred to it, and 
1 may formerly have partaken of the same error.
The typical form 
I consider to be uncommon, except in moist subalpine localities, and 
this, as far as habit is concerned, may be said to be related to R.
suberectus.
But if Leighton's |3.
is to be considered as affinis, also, 
then, there is very little like R.
suberectus about it ; for, though the 
barren stem is almost smooth, or with a very scanty fringe of scat- 
tered hairs, it trails along the ground to a great extent, in fact, 
longer than I have noticed any other bramble ; and hence, in the 
' London Catalogue of British Plants,' I have called it amplificatus 
* "Pioximam hie friitex cum praecedentibus ambobus tenet affinitatem, quippe 
cui crescendi modus Rubi fastigiati, folia vero Rubi plicati,'' is the statement in Rub.
Germ.
; and really the typical R.
affinis exhibits the fastigiate growth alluded to, as I 
noticed in growing specimens last year at Ganliwd, Merionethshire ; but I never 
noticed this to occur iu R.
amplificatus, /3.
affinis.
181 
on this very account, not being satisfied it could rightly belong to 
affinis, whose barren stem is very smooth.* At all events, this am- 
plijicate Rubus is very common, especially in hilly thickets ; I have 
it from various counties, and observed it last summer in North Wales 
also.
But if incongruous forms are not to be allocated together, 
under one name, then surely I may be allowed to urge that whatever 
becomes of my amplificate bramble, the &.
ajffitiis of Leighton, and 
which Dr. Bell Salter, I presume, understands by his var.
of Weihe 
and Nees, " an exceedingly common plant," the second form of 
rhamnifolius cannot be joined to it, or the typical affinis.
It is to be 
observed, that warm exposed situations, with some moisture super- 
added, bring out brambles to their utmost dilatation, while every- 
body knows that pent up in a dark close thicket or grove they be- 
come starved changelings.
Now, this " second form of rhamnifolius," 
vai-yinginto y.
affinis, and equivalent to R.
corylifoUus^ Sm., for which I 
proposed the name of suhlustris in Cat. of Bot. Soc, exhibits, in 
the fullest exposure to light and in moist localities â€” as I have wit- 
nessed on the banks of the Mellte, in South Wales â€” a barren stem 
differing only from that of R.
caesius in its much greater size and 
thickness, with an obvious bloom, and with short, straight, purple 
prickles dispersed on every side of the round stem.
This appears to 
me quite decisive of the matter, for it is really ccesius on a grand 
scale, but is quite different from R.
amplificatus, the /3, ajfinis of 
Leighton, of which I have seen numbers of growing specimens, the 
barren stem always angular, without bloom, and the prickles not dis- 
persed irregularly, but confined to the angles.
I have restricted myself, in this paper, to those points that Dr.
Bell Salter has either denied, or considered I was mistaken in.
The 
matter between us is purely one of observation, which dried speci- 
mens are scarcely adequate to decide.
To swim out boldly into the 
stream of observation, we must throw aside the corks of mere opi- 
nion, founded on, perhaps, a badly preserved specimen ; and Mr.
Leighton's enumeration of the species of Rubi, in his ' Flora of 
Shropshire,' abundantly shows that, like the painter's picture placed 
for judgment in the market-place, we may find no want of critics, 
and a variety of opinions, but an unpleasant uncertainty in reach- 
ing a sound conclusion.
* Weihe and Nees describe the stem of their iJ.
ft^m's as " glabenimus ;'' but 
Leighton says, iu his description of /3.
" hairy," which doubtless it is, and this is a 
discrepancy which renders it very inconvenient to combine the two.

With regard to Dr. Bell Salter's own interesting gatherings at Sel- 
bome, the foundation of this discussion, not having seen them, I am, 
of course, precluded from offering an opinion on the deductions he 
has arrived at from the examination of those particular plants.
I 
can, therefore, only express my cordial hope that, for the sake of the 
learned and acute botanist he commemorates, that his R.
Babingtonii 
will not only be enabled to exist beyond its third or fourth year, but 
take a permanent place in our British Flora.
Yet, however we may 
feel disposed to sport among the forty-seven species of fruticose 
Rubi of Weihe and Nees, or be tempted ourselves to add to the com- 
plex number, I feel persuaded that our only rational course is to be 
guided by the vestiture of the barren stem in its fullest exposure, and so 
group our plants hy the various distinctions thus presented, which, as I 
have previously shown, are only seven, exclusive of E,.
Idaeus, which 
will keep us within moderate limits, and be as near a natural arrange- 
ment as possible.

A few Parting Notes.
By Thomas Edmondston, Esq.
Intense occupation has, for some time back, prevented me from 
troubling you and the readers of the ' Phytologist ' with several pa- 
pers I had partly prepared, as I am most unexpectedly and suddenly 
summoned to go to the west coast of America, no time remaining to 
put them into the meditated form ; but before I go I shall have one 
parting shot, and briefly notice two or three subjects.
First, then, relative to a discussion on Botanical Classification, be- 
tween Dr. Ayres and myself.
I trust my friend.
Dr. A., will not 
think me uncourteous in not having answered his last paper.
Neither 
do I wish your readers to consider me beat ; the fact is, that I did 
not, owing to a blunder of my bookseller's, receive the number of 
'The Phytologist' containing his last letter till several months after 
its publication, and when I was extremely engaged about matters 
which brooked no delay ; and, as I thought there was little chance of 
one converting the other, I judged it then better to be silent, at least 
for a time.
It was, perhaps, injudicious in me to have started such a 
very controversial point ; yet I must say that nothing Dr. Ayres has 
said can be considered as at all militating against my position, if it be 
borne in mind that I merely advocate an " artificial " system as an 
183 
introductory means of acquiring knowledge.
The controversy has 
latterly got narrowed down into a discussion on the existence or non- 
existence, in nature, of species : and in his last letter Dr. Ayres 
brings forward a most extraordinary argument â€” one, in fact, in which 
I can scarcely conceive him serious â€” in support of his views.
This 
argument, which he so triumphantly appeals to, is derived from the 
inorganic kingdom.
Now, Linnaeus and other naturalists do use the 
term species as applied to certain forms or aggregations of inor- 
ganized matter, but just in the same way as we should apply the 
term " species " to a particular kind of chair or table ; while in or- 
ganic nature it implies a distinct idea connected with the repro- 
duction of the individuals.
I think Dr. A.
will require a very little 
reflection to convince him (I hope he will not be offended at the 
strength of the term) of the absurdity of such a line of argument.
If any naturalist ever used the term species, genus, class, or order in 
the same sense in the inorganic as in the organic kingdom, I never 
heard of him.
The only other point in Dr. Ayres' letter 1 shall notice, is where he 
wishes to entangle me in a contradiction.
I do not happen to have 
the numbers of 'The Phytologist' in which Dr. Ayres or my own 
papers are, and therefore cannot quote the exact words ; but if he 
refers to my letter again, he will see that I do not talk of the " natu- 
ral " system properly so called, or the systems of Jussieu, Decandolle, 
or Lindley, as " debris," or unconnected fragments : I only say that 
if, as Dr. Ayres asserts, every plant and animal has its own peculiar 
niche in a grand system of nature, considering the paucity of species 
we are perfectly acquainted with, it must be an unconnected and 
fragmentary scheme ; so that he will see that my condemnation oi his 
ideas, and my praise of the " natural " system (whose authors dis- 
claim his theory,) are perfectly compatible.
Enough of this : my 
best thanks are due to Dr. Ayres for his courtesy throughout 
our little passage of arms ; and now, save some other champion, 
not willing to see the immortal Swede, (well and truly called the 
father of natural science), thrown like useless lumber on the shelf, 
take up my relinquished lance, this discussion must perforce drop.
I want to say a word or two on Lastraea recurva of Bree and New- 
man.
This said fern must be very scarce in Scotland ; for anxiously 
as I have searched for it, I have never yet seen a frond of it grow- 
ing.
As a species, it is one of the most distinct we have ; how it 
has been so much overlooked and confounded is the only wonder.
I think great credit is due to Mr. Bree and Mr. Newman for their 
184 
able elucidation of it.
My friend, Mr, Babington, objects to the 
name as tending to give a wrong impression of the plant, and wishes 
the ideas of writers in ' The Phytologist' on the subject.
" What's 
in a name .^" we exclaim !
Not much now-a-days, when the name is 
never looked to without the description.
It is, nevertheless, desirable 
that names should be as characteristic as possible, or that at least 
they should not teach error.
Such are the only names I would allow 
should be changed if once imposed.
Now, Mr. Babington considers 
" recurva" as teaching quite the opposite of what is the fact, namely, 
" incurva :" with regard to the frond of a fern, the two terms must be 
considered synonymous, though such is not, in strict Natural-History 
^ei^m\ioxx,always the case.
It is rather curious that Mr. Babington's own 
"pet" name, c'owertvÂ«, is just in the same predicament, "convexa" 
being equally appropriate ; and to put the case arithmetically â€” as 
concava is to recurva, so is convexa to incurva.
Mr. Babington is 
not here so happy as usual in his Orismology.
I wish, in concluding this omnium gatherum communication, to no- 
tice a Hieracium, apparently undescribed and distinct, which, during 
a delightful two months' botanical exploration in Morayshire last 
summer, I gathered on the banks of the river Findhorn, about six 
miles-above Forres.
The following is a brief description : â€” 
Hieracium nudicaule, Edmond.
Rhizoma long, black, creeping, and tortuous ; leaves all radical, 
lanceolate, sagittate at the base, exceedingly thin and flaccid, slightly 
pubescent, their petioles villous ; scape terminating in a few-flowered 
corymb of more or less nodding flowers.
Banks of the Findhorn, near Forres, Morays., July, 1844.
I have since seen a specimen in Dr. Balfour's collection, from 
Breadalbane, placed in the same sheet with H.
Lawsoni, from which 
species it is, howevei", quite distinct.
Several other apparent novelties occurred in Morayshire, but nei- 
ther time nor materials are at present forthcoming, to do justice to 
them.
And now, wishing every success to * The Phytologist' and phytolo- 
gists, I hope, on my return from California, to find it and them well 
and flourishing.

Mr. Eclmomhton s Appointment to the Harold.
Since the foregoing paragraphs were penned, our correspondent, 
Mr. Edmondston, has sailed in the surveying-ship, Harold, bound 
for the west coast of North America, Knowing his zeal, industry and 
ability in the cause of Phytology, we anticipate great results from his 
appointment as Naturalist to the Expedition.
Most heartily do we 
return the good wishes he bequeaths us as a parting legacy : may suc- 
cess attend his exertions, and may they prove equally advantageous 
to science and honorable to himself!
The Californian plants which 
have hitherto reached this country through other channels, give pro- 
mise of a plentiful harvest still to be reaped ; and with youth, health 
and energy on his side, we can scarcely point to an individual so well 
fitted as Mr. Edmondston for such an undertaking.
Discovery of Lychnis alpina in England.
By Richard Matthews, 
Esq.
Having nowhere seen Lychnis alpina recorded as a native of Cum- 
berland, I send you a specimen of that plant, which was gathered in 
a narrow and deep ravine of Hobeartin Fell, a clay-slate mountain, 
which rises from the Vale of Lorton.
When found, it was growing at 
an elevation of about 2,000 feet, and had done flowering ; but being- 
preserved, and planted in my garden, it produced the head of flowers 
which I now inclose, thus affording an instance that Lychnis alpina 
inhabits the mountains of Cumberland.

Under the head of 'Botanical Information,' we find a reprint of Mr.
Watson's Circular relative to the discontinuance of his great work on 
' The Geographical Distribution of British Plants,' previously noticed 
(Phytol.
i. 635).
In place of this work, the design of which was found 
to be too extensive to allow of its being completed with a reasonable 
time, it is Mr. Watson's intention to bring out three separate treatises, 
under the heads of â€” 1.
Botanical Geography: 2.
Areas of British 
Plants : and 3.
Localities of British Plants.
Under each of these 
heads the circular contains separate and distinct specimen-pages, so 
printed as to exhibit the plan of each of the three books ; the printer 
of the Journal has however contrived to defeat Mr. Watson's object, 
by most ingeniously combining the three specimens into one (cer- 
tainly not harmonious) whole.
In a short article on ' Cistopteris montana,' discovered by Mr. Wil- 
son on Ben Lawers in 1836 (Phytol.
i. 671), the editor of the Journal 
states that he has examined Plukenet's volumes in the British Muse- 
um, with a view of verifying Swartz's reference to " Pluk.
Phyt.
t. 89, 
f. 4, ' Filix alpina Myrrhidis facie Cambro-Britannica, &c.' " but 
that no corresponding specimens exist there ; so that the supposition 
of its having been found in Wales by Petiver, appears to be without 
foundation.
In Buddie's and Petiver's herbaria are Welsh specimens 
"corresponding with Plukenet's figure, whose synonym is quoted ; 
and these plants are Aspidium spinulosum, so that to us it appears 
clear that that is the species intended by Plukenet.
Mr. Wilson will 
therefore remain the first discoverer of it in Britain.
We may add, 
that it is a native of the Rocky Mountains, in North America, and, as 
such, is described in Hook.
Fl. Bor.-Americana."

' On the correct Nomenclature of the Lastraea spinosa and L.
mul- 
tiflora of Newman.
By Charles C.
Babington, M.A., F.G.S., F.L.S.' 
With regard to Mr. Babington's paper, we are compelled to ex- 
press our regret that it should have ever seen the light, since it 
is calculated to lead into error all those who blindly adopt this 
190 
author's suggestions, and to prejudice him very materially in the 
estimation of all who enquire for themselves.
It is well known to 
those who have paid any attention to our British ferns, that Smith, 
(followed by Mr. Babington), applied the name of dilatata to a group 
of species which he supposed to constitute but one.
Hooker sub- 
sequently applied the name of spinulosa to the same group.
Conti- 
nental authors have generally adopted the same plan, sometimes 
giving one name, sometimes another, according as they considered 
one or other name possessed the claim of priority.
Mr. Newman, in the 
â€¢ * History of British Ferns ' just published, has shown that this group 
comprised several species, three of which he proves have been 
clearly described before under the names of multiflora, spinosa, and 
recurva : he therefore adopts these names, because the other names, 
though perhaps having the claim of priority â€” as Mr. Babington 
attempts, but not satisfactorily, to explain â€” were never applied to 
species, but to families, or groups of species.
The object of Mr.
Babington 's present paper is to sink the names of the species altoge- 
ther â€” to assign one synonyme to one species, and another synonyme 
to another species This is very illogical.
Linneus himself included 
several species of Ophrys under the name of insectifera ; but we 
never think of debating whether that name shall be assigned to the 
* Bee ' or to the ' Fly.' Papers like this of Mr. Babingtou's do infi- 
nite mischief.
We hope we shall see no more of them.
Notice of ' A Catalogue of British Ferns, including the Equisetace<B 
and Lycopodiacece : intended for Labels.
London : Edward 
Newman, 9, Devonshire-street, Bishopsgate.
1845.
The author's object in printing this Catalogue, is to introduce a 
greater uniformity in the nomenclature of British Ferns.
Until lately, 
scarcely any attention had been given to this subject ; and if he has 
succeeded in detecting and correcting a few errors, it is no more than 
was to be anticipated from the labours of any one who ventured on a 
task from which all others appear to have shrunk, from a feeling of 
distaste.
Such a circumstance should never be viewed with jealousy 
or distrust.
The author's own collections, deposited with the Linne- 
an Society and other public bodies, will be labelled with this Cata- 
logue; so that until an abler hand shall supply another ' History of 
British Ferns,' the present names must be considered to carry with 
them that degree of authority which is ever granted to the compiler of 
191 
a careliil Monograph.
Under every name, the author gives a refer- 
ence to the correspondhig figure of the species or variety ; so that no 
confusion can creep in as to the plant intended to be indicated by the 
name.
As every collector of British Ferns must possess himself of 
this Catalogue, its appearance at the present moment may, in some 
degree, act as an antidote to the unwholesome attempts now making 
to introduce ill-judged alterations.

" Remarks on some specimens of Ruhi sent to the Botanical So- 
ciety of London, by T.
Bell Salter, M.D., F.L.S.
" The accompanying specimens are of forms of Rubi, descriptions 
192 
of which appear in the May number of the ' Annals of Natural His- 
tory.' [See ante.
p. 189.] 
" Desirous that the Botanical Society might possess early speci- 
mens, the accompanying ones are sent.
It is acknowledged that the 
specimens are small, and some imperfect ; but I have preferred 
sending immediately such as I can afford, to delaying till another 
year's collection.
That the specimens may not appear altogether 
without remarks, I offer the following hasty ones : â€” 
" Ruhus tenuis is by no means an unfrequent bramble, having the 
habit of Ruhus coisius, from which it is distinguished by its black 
fruit, and the absence of hairs and glands in the surculi.
The sepals 
are broader, and the fruit, though pleasantly acid, has not that ex- 
tremely fine flavour which belongs to R.
ccesius, and which, once ob- 
served, cannot be forgotten.
In the plates of Rubus affinis, in the 
work of Weihe and Nees, one variety (8) is figured with reflexed 
calyx.
As this is the principal artificial character which distinguishes 
the present from the more slender forms of that species, no doubt 
rests on my mind that that drawing must have been taken from a 
plant of this species ; an opinion in which I am confirmed by having 
noticed, in the Herbarium of Mr. Borrer, a specimen of Mr.
Leighton's, which Nees had labelled as a variety of his ajffinis.
In 
this country I believe it has commonly been included under Ruhus 
ccesius, and probably sometimes under the convenient name of 
Ruhus corylifolius.
The variety labelled ^^ var.ferox^'' in the accom- 
panying specimens, is distinguished from the other form by the 
greater number and size of the prickles.
" Ruhus Borreri, which I have so named in honour of my excellent 
friend, Mr. Borrer, in acknowledgment of his successful labours in 
this genus, belongs to the section of which Ruhus vilUcaulis (W.
& 
N.) may be considered the type ; but it is distinguished from all the 
species allied to it by its corymbose panicle, and by its long sepals, 
which, instead of being reflexed, loosely embrace the fruit.
" The remaining specimen to be referred to, I have named Ruhus 
Bahingtonii, after my friend the distinguished author of the ' Manual 
of British Botany.' It is a remarkably large plant, combining the 
hispid stem of rudis with the shaggy clothing in the panicle of 
leucostachijs, from both of which it is abundantly distinguished by 
its teraate leaves, and the breadth and crenate margins of its leaflets."

Rus in Urhe.
By Edward Newman.
It seems most forcibly impressed on me that I am never more to 
ramble at leisure among our ferns in their native homes ; and, con- 
sequently, never to enjoy the opportunity of studying differences 
where alone they are to be satisfactorily determined.
Combined with 
this feeling is a knowledge of the fact, the irresistible, the manifest 
fact, that I have left much to be done.
In Cystopteris fragilis, a 
group rather than a species, nothing satisfactory has yet been accom- 
plished, not one step has been taken in the right direction.
It is 
true, we have five names, and those botanists who delight in multi- 
plying species, or who estimate the value of their herbarium by the 
multitude of its names, apply these names according to their pleasure, 
often making the most ingenious and fanciful combinations : but, 
with this exception, which may be called playing at Botany, not a 
single step has been taken towards ascertaining whether we really 
possess more than one British species of Cystopteris : on the other 
hand, it may truly be said, we have no reason to give for grouping 
together so vast an assemblage of heterogeneous forms.
In Filix- 
femina we have advanced a step further ; but still no more than a step : 
although forty-five years have elapsed since Roth elaborately de- 
scribed five species of this family, and nearly fifty years since Hoff- 
mann characterised a similar number ; no British author has ever 
enquired whether the characters given by these eminent botanists are 
sufficient or insufficient, or whether we possess in this country one 
species or five.
In the group, called by Hooker Aspidium spinulosum, 
it has been shown that five most distinct and unvarying species had 
been " rolled into one " ; and these have at length been extricated with 
some exactitude under the names of Cystopteris montana, Lastrsea 
recurva, L.
spinosa, L.
multiflora, and L.
rigida.
But is no more to 
be accomplished ?
are we sure that we have no other species equally 
distinct ?
I cannot for a moment doubt that the task is still imper- 
fectly accomplished.
Our knowledge will not remain stationary at this 
point, now that attention is awakened : the result will be sure to re- 
ward the diligent enquirer.
Perhaps there is egotism even in recurring to our errors : I think it 
is so ; and yet I cannot refrain from reverting to mine, since I fear 
they tended to repress investigation, and, consequently, to retard elu- 
cidation.
When very young in the study, I drew conclusions from 
insufficient data, a practice far too common.
I found that Smith 
described a fern under three names, calling the more perfect form, 
Vol. it.
2 b 
194 
Aspidium dilatatum, the young, Aspidium spinulosum, and a blighted 
frond, Aspidium dumetorum ; hence I concluded that we had but one 
species of this family in Britain : the only just conclusion would have 
been that Smith described but one.
Cystopteris fragilis is described 
three times by the same author ; Athyrium Felix-femina twice ; 
Polystichum aculeatum twice ; and so on.
These facts, logically 
viewed, in no degree militate against the existence of many cognate 
British species.
The only just inference to be drawn from such facts 
must bear reference to the ability or inability of the author.
It can- 
not bear on the plants which he does or does not describe.
Well had 
it been for me had I then read some clearly expressed treatise on 
logic, like the masterly productions since published by Duval-Jouve 
and Mill.
I might, in that case, have escaped manifold errors.
***** 
Even with those who seek the truth with singleness of purpose, 
several barriers exist to the attainment of precise knowledge : one, and 
a most formidable barrier it is, may be observed in the almost ine- 
radicable propensity to regard differences resulting from age as 
indicative of specific distinction.
I never recollect meeting with a 
botanist who would wish to seize on a young dicotyledon, and raise it 
to specific honours : I never saw an entomologist treasuring a cater- 
pillar or a chrysalis, as something totally distinct from the imago : 
neither do we see the botanist contrasting the seedling sycamore with 
the giant oak ; nor the entomologist comparing the caterpillar of a 
moth with a perfect butterfly ; yet such feats are commonly performed 
by the collector of ferns, and the common characteristics of baby- 
hood are regarded as indicating nondescripts.
This is no recent 
foible ; our great Ray made a species out of the seedling or larva of 
Oreopteris ; and Smith, who detected the error, still gives the seed- 
ling as a variety, and, with ludicrous gravity, designates it as Oreop- 
teris /3.
Why do we not follow the example of the botanist who rears 
his plants from seed ; or the entomologist, who raises his butterfly 
from the egg ?
I do not counsel a pteridologist to reject all informa- 
tion to be derived from seedlings, but most strenuously do I recom- 
mend him always to regard them as mere stepping-stones to 
knowledge, and as incidents in the life of a species, whose history is 
not to be written until it has attained maturity.
But, although the seedling of a fern is unavailable for scientific 
description, the young frond of the mature plant is an invaluable 
auxiliary, a safe pilot, in our search for truth ; and I believe there is 
not a botanist living, who, had he watched the fronds of mature roots 
195 
of recuvva, spinulosa and multiflora, as they gradually uncoiled, and 
by slow degrees developed their various divisions, but would long ago 
have pronounced these species as different from each other, as any of 
those which he had always acknowledged to be such.
Recurva, 
while expanding, may, by the unpractised eye, be passed as Pteris 
aquilina, or as Polypodium robertianum, but never as either of those 
species to which it has been so unnaturally united.
A second barrier to the discovery of truth, is the imperfection of 
the specimens selected for preservation.
It has been an almost in- 
variable rule to select convenient rather than characteristic specimens.
I use the modifying" almost," not because I have met with an exception, 
but because my knowledge of herbaria is not so complete as to warrant 
my saying the rule is invariable ; the full-grown, full-fruited, mature, 
cheiracteristic fronds, are rejected as inconveniently large, except, in- 
deed, in the rarer and smaller species, which being supposed valuable 
in proportion to their magnitude, are generally selected by size ; thus 
we invariably find the largest possible Lastraea rigida, and the smallest 
possible Lastraea Filix-mas placed side by side, as the truthful repre- 
sentatives of the respective species : the largest possible Allosorus cris- 
pus, and the smallest possible Pteris aquilina always perform the same 
office, and quite as unfaithfully.
For the common species a mere fragment 
is generally supposed sufficient.
In the herbaria of Linneus and Smith, 
the great authorities for reference, a bit nipped off" at random, fre- 
quently suffices to exemplify a species.
May I venture, as one who 
has experienced the difficulty of drawing satisfactory conclusions 
from such materials as these, to recommend an entirely new plan in 
the preservation of ferns ?
â€” that is, to select fronds, of whatever spe- 
cies, of full size, of full developement, in full fructification, and perfect 
from the very apex of the frond to the very base of the stipes ; and if 
a portion of the rhizoma and root can be included, so much the better.
When the rhizoma is a running one, as in Thelypteris, its preservation 
is indispensable.
A third barrier is the disposition to preserve and value malforma- 
tions and monstrosities, whether originating in blight, injury, or 
other casualties.
This taste prevails more generally than I could 
have believed, had I not repeatedly been required to inspect as in- 
estimable treasures, fronds with two tips, or deficient in the pinnae on 
one side, or curled to the right hand or to the left.
Far be it from me 
to depreciate any fact, or class of facts, but this taste induces atten- 
tion to matters that are totally at variance with the elucidation of 
species.
196 
A fourth barrier is the disposition to regard certain plants as under 
the influence of a kind of ban or proscription : thus, who does not 
pass the most beautiful ferns with the conclusion, expressed or felt, 
" Oh !
that is only spinulosum," or " only Filix-femina." These de- 
cisions are totally unaccompanied by any examination ; they are 
made quite off-hand, and with the greatest possible confidence : thus 
we rivet the fetters of ignorance on our own minds, and cherish them 
with admirable complacency.
I look forward with ardent hopes to the day when all ferns shall be 
collected, or at least examined with equal zest ; when the taste for 
deformities shall cease ; when specimens for preservation shall be 
carefully selected, the full-grown, the perfect, the mature ; when seed- 
lings shall cease to be regarded with interest, except as the progeny 
of the respective parents.
We require competent observers, multi- 
plied observations, and abundance of specimens such as I have de- 
scribed.
Then truth may enter largely into our conclusions ; at pre- 
sent we draw inferences from hypotheses, like the young housewife 
who regarded her cookery-book as sufficient for the manufacture of a 
l)udding, and so neglected to provide the ingredients.
What are the casements lined with creeping herbs, 
The prouder sashes fronted with a range 
Of orange, myrtle, or the fragrant weed, 
The Frenchman's darling ?
are they not all proofs 
That man, immured in cities, still retains 
His inborn inextinguishable thirst 
Of rural scenes, compensating his loss 
By supplemental shifts, the best he may ?

There ferns and equisetums planted thick 
And watered duly.
There the pitcher stands 
A fragment, and the spoutless tea-pot there ; 
Sad witnesses how close-pent man regrets 
The country ; with what ardour he contrives 
A peep at nature, when he can no more.
In the first of these passages, Cowper's prophetic eye foresees 
the taste of Devonshire-street generally ; in the second, he indivi- 
dualises a house, evidently No. 9.
1 have long taken an interest in 
the horticultural pursuits of my neighbours.
Many and many a plant 
have I seen piu'chased, cherished, watered, nursed, and killed : a 
valuable table might be compiled for the " statistic section of the Bri- 
197 
tish Association i'or the advancement of Science," showing the 
average life of a horse-shoe geranium, a verbena, a myrtle, a heath, or 
a Fuchsia, when translated into the â€” atmosphere â€” I was about to 
write soil â€” of Devonshire-street.
The myrtle, I think, enjoys the 
maximum, and the blue bell (Scilla nutans) the minimum of exist- 
ence ; the latter is imported every spring, " all-a-blowing, all-a-grow- 
ing," from the woods of Kent and Surrey ; but never lifts its head 
amid the impurities of our atmosphere.
Without any attempt to ascertain the causes of this mortality, in- 
deed, bowing implicity to the researches of Mr. Ward, who has so 
ably investigated " the causes which interfere with the natural condi- 
tions of plants in large towns," â€” I could not but conclude that the 
air contained or conveyed something eminently fatal to vegetable 
life : while, on the other hand, the partial success of the Wardian 
cases induced me to believe in the possibility of excluding all that 
was injurious : in fact, I imagined 1 could get up an atmospheric esta- 
blishment on a small scale, which should have but little connexion 
with the atmosphere of the metropolis.
I have said " the partial suc- 
cess of the Wardian cases ;" for candour compels me to add that I 
consider the success of the Wardian cases incomplete.
The enclosed 
plants adopt too literally the plan of self government : they inconti- 
nently run their heads against the glass, which is always streaming 
with condensed vapour, and, in that position, flatten their faces 
and decay piecemeal.
Then, again, you very rarely obtain a com- 
fortable view of the interior of a well-filled and well-closed Wardian 
case : the water on the glass, and the exuberant growth of some of 
the plants, greatly interfere with this : how often does some luxuriant 
monster overwhelm and stifle the rarer and more tender species, on 
which you happened peculiarly to have set your affections !
" Aye !" 
says Mr. Ward, " this is perfectly true if the cases are not properly 
managed, but not otherwise ; all the evil arises from mismanagement." 
Bad management may be the cause of all these disagreeables : I will 
not contest the point ; but, judging from the numerous cases I have 
seen, I think I may safely state that bad management is the rule, 
good management the exception : for closely glazed cases are almost 
invariably labouring under the diflSculties enumerated.
***** 
Submitting with resignation to the belief that I was never more to 
enjoy the opportunity of watching my favourite ferns perfom their 
various acts of existence in a state of nature ; confident of the neces- 
sity of such watching before I made any further progress in their his- 
198 
tory ; satisfied of the impossibility of growing them, exposed to the 
atmosphere of Devonshire-street ; dissatisfied with the effects of 
closely glazed cases ; I still determined to make trial of a plan that 
should bring these wildings of the woods to my own door, and give 
them the advantages, without the disadvantages, of a Wardian case.
Should the trial prove successful, should the results appear worth 
communicating, I may resume my pen and scribble a few more dis- 
jointed paragraphs, as a continuation of the present paper.

Remarks on Ruhus diversifolius of Lindley.
By T.
Bell Salter, M.D., F.L.S.
Without wishing to become controversial, there is yet one point in 
the communication of Mr. Lees, on which a few words appear to be 
required ; and it is one which involves the question, what is the R.
diversifolius of Professor Lindley ?
I believe all the difficulty and 
doubt of the matter, may, at once, to adopt the facetious metaphor of 
Mr. Lees, be solved by the fact, in' Dr. Lindley's case, of " the father 
not knowing his own son." In the first edition of his Synopsis, Dr.
Lindley first describes a species by this name, which is placed in the 
section with hairs and " neither bloom nor glands." The description 
agrees with the form which is the R.
vestitus (W.
& N.), and which I 
enumerate in my Selborne list as a variety of R.
leucostachys ; and 
the Horticultural Society's garden furnished Mr. Borrer with pre- 
cisely this very form from the authentic plant of diversifolius.
Subsequently to this, a second edition of the Synopsis appears, and 
a specimen is named by Professor Lindley for Mr. Leighton.
The 
order of priority of these two latter circumstances I do not know, nor is 
it material ; but that which concerns the point at issue, is as follows : 
â€” a specimen of R.
dumetorura was named, and that by the author 
of the supposed species, R.
diversifolius ; and, coincidently with 
this, in the second edition of the Synopsis, though the description 
itself is not materially altered, it is yet ranged under a fresh section 
â€” that " with glandular bristles." The fact of Dr. Lindley's having 
named a glandulose specimen as diversifolius for Mr. Leighton, I 
had been aware of from Mr. Borrer's herbarium ; and I confess I was 
a little amused at so distinguished a Professor mistaking a species of 
199 
which he himself was the author.
Still 1 considered the mistake as 
only accidental, â€” a mere lapsus as it were, until, after my remarks in 
the ' Phytologist ' were published, I observed on comparing the two 
editions of the Synopsis, that diversifoUus had, in the second edition, 
been transferred to another section ; and that thus, in truth, the name 
had been applied to another plant, though without any comment to 
shew that the author had intended or was even aware of the trans- 
ference.
In addition to this negative evidence, the authority of " Ed.
pr^ placed after the name in the second edition, may be looked upon 
as so far a positive evidence that this change was made unwittingly.
The whole of the confusion, therefore, on this subject, rests with 
the author of the supposed new species, and it at once becomes evi- 
dent that by the name Rubus diversifoUus [Lindl.)^ Mr. Lees, with 
the second edition of the Synopsis, and Mr. Leighton's specimen to 
support his opinion, refers to one plant ; whilst I, with the original 
description in the first edition, and the authentic plant in the garden 
of the Horticultural Society to support my view, refer to another.
Were the forms to which the name had been applied, species which 
had not received previous names, it would be for decision, which is 
the R.
diversifoUus, and in that case I believe every admitted rule of 
scientific nomenclature would have applied it, as I, as a name of 
synonomy merely, have done in my former communication.
But, as 
each form had already been described and figured by Weihe and 
Nees, this question becomes quite immaterial.
One consideration, however, arising from this error is worth noti- 
cing ; and that is, that it quite alters the force of Dr. Lindley's re- 
flection respecting Mr. Borrer's opinion of the identity of diversifolius 
and leucostachys, which I quoted in my former observations on thi s 
subject (p.
106).
Mr. Borrer's opinion was founded on the first 
edition of the Synopsis and the eglandulose plant there intended, 
while the Professor's remark was made on the supposition that Mr.
Borrer had actually considered the glandulose dumetorum to be only 
a variety of R.
leucostachys !
One can well imagine his surprise, 
though the cause of the mistake thus appears to be on his own part.
The variety vesiitus contrasts very remarkably with the typical leu- 
costachys, but of course in no degree to be compared with the differ- 
ence between these two widely separate species.
I have read with much interest and pleasure the paper of Mr. Lees, 
to which 1 have referred above.
With respect to some other points 
in his communication, in which I hold opinions different from his â€” 
having no wish for controversy, T shall not now reply to them, but 
200 
only bring forward any fresh remarks on lliis snbject as facts and 
observations shall fmnish thcni, and then 1 hope I shall be equally 
ready to offer them whether they tend to confirm or change the 
opinions I now hold.
The present communication, however, ap- 
peared to be called for, to put in a proper light that which we had 
both written, or I would not again have so soon troubled the readers 
of the 'Phytologist' with any fresh remarks on a subject, which I fear 
is not of very general interest.

On the meaning of the word recurvus.
By T.
Bell Salter, M.D., F.L.S.
I have read with much pleasure Mr. Watson's lucid remarks on the 
meaning of the word recurvus, and certainly very desirable it is that 
some definite idea should be attached to a term, on which there aj)- 
j)ears so much diversity of opinion.
In all the ornithological and 
entomological instances of the use of this word, which have been 
adduced, the curvature is in a direction from the face or the venter, 
towards the dorsum, which is, as Mr. Watson says, " contrary to the 
usual direction." It is, however, I apprehend in force of the former 
fact, â€” the part being bent toward the dorsum, â€” that the terra is used, 
for if it come to be considered as merely signifying its being con- 
trary to the usual direction, it at once ceases to be an absolute term, 
and will convey no certain meaning to the person whom it may be in- 
tended to enlighten by a description, â€” he not being aware what may 
be the usual direction in that particular tribe or genus ; â€” or even spe- 
cies, for where is a limit to be drawn, where a mere comparison is 
indefinitely implied ?
Now, from the numerous definitions from the highest authorities, 
so carefully cited at page 113 of this work, it would appear that in 
Botany, as well as in Ornithology and Entomology, â€” and Mr. Wat- 
son's definition of re implies the same, â€” it would appear, then, that 
here too the particle re gives the sense of backwardness in the direc- 
tion ; a curving or bending towards some real or supposed back or 
dorsum.
The question is, therefore, what is the back or dorsum 
in any part of a plant.
Common acceptation has universally ap- 
plied it to that surface of any part, which is situated outwardly be- 
fore its having expanded ; and, in accordance with this, we have in 
applied to every curvature, which, supposing the part in question to 
201 
be imexpanded, would be towards the axis of the plant, as involutus; 
and 9'e, with the solitary exception of the controverted Lastra^a, to a 
curvature, which, on a similar supposition, would be in the opposite 
direction, as rejiexus.
Every one understands the words involute and revolute as applied 
to leaves, and with respect to ferns every one attaches the idea of the 
back or dorsum to that side on which the sori are placed.
In fact, 
the term is universally applied in the definition of the Polypodiacece, 
viz., the fructification being placed on the hack of the frond, which is, 
in fact, that side which before unfolding is directed outwardly from 
the axis of the rhizoma.
According, therefore, to the universal application of the particles 
in and re, a fern would be incurved or inflected, which is concave on 
the polished or smooth surface, and recurved or reflexed if concave 
towards that which bears the sori, and that alike whether the bending 
happen to be upwards or downwards.
The name " recurva^'' there- 
fore, as applied to the Lastrsea of Bree, would appear to the author 
of these remarks, to be used in a sense in every way isolated and 
exceptional.

Catalogue of Plants observed in the neighbourhood of Fareham, 
Hants.
By W.
L. Notcutt, Esq.
In offering a contribution towards a Flora of this neighbourhood, a 
few remarks with regard to the locality may not be useless.
Fareham 
is situated at the north-west corner of the inlet known by the name of 
Portsmouth Harbour ; but which is, in fact, a kind of lake, mea- 
suring about four miles by four or five ; and communicating with the 
sea by a neck about a mile wide, on one side of which lies Gosport, and 
on the other Portsea and Portsmouth.
This lake is, however, little 
more than a large bed of ooze for the greater part of its extent, but 
being subject to the influence of the tide, affords support on its mar- 
gin to a consideiable number of maritime plants.
The district here 
attempted to be elucidated comprehends a circuit around Fareham, 
varying in its distance from the town from two to four miles ; Hill 
Head, the farthest point of it, being about the latter distance : the 
average may, however, be taken at about two miles and a half.
On 
the east side it includes Portchester and the neighbouring shore, 
taking in the west end of Portsdown, on which stands the monument 
Vol. II.
2 c 
202 
erected in honour of Nelson.
Boarhunt, and Millis's Bottom, a com- 
mon about a mile from Wickham, are the limits on the north-east, 
and Fontley, and the south side of Titchfield common on the north.
On the south and west it includes the river-side from Titchfield to 
Hill Head : also Stiibbington, and the Gosport road and its neigh- 
bourhood for about the distance of two miles.
In mentioning Titch- 
field common, it must not be supposed that I include the whole of it : 
but the part to which allusion is so frequently made in the ensuing 
list, is that which borders the sides of the Southampton road as far as 
the point where it is joined by the road from Cattisfield : and also a 
small part of the common a little beyond West Hill, the seat of Sir 
H. Paulett.
It is in this last mentioned part that most of the bog 
plants were found.
The chalk formation embraces a large extent of country on the east 
side of the town, and generally lies near, or comes to, the surface ; 
and on the west the London clay is the prevailing substratum, though 
gravel, sand, &c., overlie it in many places.
It must not be supposed that the following list professes to be by 
any means a complete one, as it is the result of the labours of only 
three summers, and my time for botanical pursuits is but limited.
I 
do not doubt, therefore, that further research would bring to light 
many plants not included in this list, and prove this neighbourhood 
to be excelled by few in richness and variety.
As, however, my re- 
sidence here will probably soon terminate, I do not suppose that I 
shall be able to complete the task.
I may just allude, as a singular 
circumstance, to the excessive rarity of Draba verna here ; one or two 
plants being all that I have met with.
The figures refer to the com- 
parative rarity or frequency of some of the species ; their signification 
is the same as in the Edinburgh Catalogue.
I regret that my brief 
acquaintance with the neighbourhood will not justify my applying 
them to all.

Report of an experiment which hears upon the specijic identity of the 
Cowslip and Primrose.
By Hewett C.
Watson, Esq., F.L.S.
While the botanists of this country were still imperfectly ac- 
quainted with the true Primula elatior (of Jacquin), and were apply- 
ing that name to vaiieties of the Primula vulgaris, I called the 
attention of the Botanical Society to one of those varieties which 
differed from the ordinary form of P.
vulgaris, not only by having the 
umbel of flowers raised above the leaves on an elongated scape (a va- 
riation of character not rare in P.
vulgaris), but also by approaching 
nearer towards P.
veris in the size and colour of its flowers, the 
pubescence and other characters.
This is the variety which is en- 
tered in the London Catalogue, under the name of Primula vulgaris 
var.
intermedia, and which has been alluded to in the pages of the 
' Phytologist ' on diff"erent occasions (Phytol.
i. pp.
9, 232, 1002), under 
the name of the " Claygate Oxlip." It has also been distributed by the 
Botanical Society, under the name of " Oxlip, No. 2," in contrast 
with other forms of Primulas which are designated " Oxlips " also.
A wild root of this Claygate oxlip was removed to my garden in 
the spring of 1841, Neither in that year, nor during the three suc- 
ceeding years, did I observe any seedlings about the plant.
In the 
summer of 1843, I saved some of the seed, all from the one plant, in 
order to ascertain whether it would germinate.
This seed was sown 
in a flower-pot, in the spring of 1844, and kept well watered.
Nume- 
rous plants thus raised, were removed to the open ground in the 
autumn of 1844.
On the 2d of May, 1845, there were eighty-eight 
of these plants alive ; seventy of them then being in flower.
Several 
were in no wise distinguishable from the common primrose ; some few 
were perfect cowslips ; the greater number being intermediate varie- 
ties, which might fairly be said to connect the cowslips and prim- 
roses, step by step, so gradually did these varieties pass one to the 
other.
On throwing them into groups, to correspond with the ar- 
rangement given in the ' London Catalogue of British Plants,' I 
obtained the following numerical results : â€” 
True cowslips (Primula veris) 4 
Cowslips passing to oxlips (P.
veris, var.
major) 5 
Oxlips (P.
vulgaris, vnr.
intermedia) 23 
Caulescent primroses (P.
vulgaris var.
caulescens) ....

The Clay gate oxli]), the parent plant, was growing in my kitchen 
garden, in which neither cowslip nor primrose was grown in 1843.
Nor was it easy to conceive the parent plant fertilized from either of 
the two species, unless through the agency of bees.
Under the cir- 
cumstances of the experiment, though not impossible, I think it 
highly imj^robable, that the seed of any other Primula than the one 
plant, could have been in the flower-pot.
When the young plants 
were removed to the open ground, they were set in four different 
])laccs, in order to try them in dissimilar soils and situations.
Among 
those placed most in the shade there were no " cowslips," or " cow- 
slips passing to oxlips." This circumstance might be attributable to 
the paucity of plants so placed : the cowslips bearing a small propor- 
tion among the plants placed more in the sun.
The conclusion ap- 
pears unavoidable to me, that a variety of the primrose gave origin at 
the same time to cowslips, to primroses, and to many varieties of 
these two reputed species.
All the flowers had the colours of the 
wild cowslip or primrose, or intermediate tints ; and in other respects, 
they kept to the characters of the wild plants, without sporting into 
the monstrosities of calyx or corolla, which are so frequently seen in 
the garden Primulas.
It will be observed of this experiment, that the first change from 
P. vulgaris was made (so to write) by the hand of Nature ; the parent 
stock of my mixed assemblage having been a wild variety (as I sup- 
pose) of the primrose.
In the experiment of the Rev. W.
Herbert, 
somewhat similar results are said to have been produced by sowing 
tlie seeds of a " red cowslip," â€” query, an oxlip .?
In recording his 
own experiment, it is stated by the Rev. J.
S. Henslow that he 
sowed the seeds of " some cowslips " which were growing in his 
garden, and that these produced varieties intermediate between the 
cowslip and primrose, with one " perfect primrose." Remarkably 
enough, no cowslip appears to have been produced from the seeds 
sown by Mr. Henslow ; and I cannot avoid a still lingering doubt 
whether the seeds may not inadvertently have been taken from plants 
of the oxlip or caulescent primrose, instead of the cowslip.
More- 
over, it is now desirable to ascertain whether the " Westhoe" oxlips 
are not referrible to the Primula elatior of Jacquin, and, equally so 
with the garden cowslips from which the seeds were collected.
In 
the few following remarks, which naturally arise on these experi- 
ments, I assume the accuracy of my own experiment, as before 
reported ; although a repetition of it is rendered desirable on account 
of the admitted possibility that a seed or seeds of another Primula 
219 
could have been in the soil used in the tlower-pot.
But whence the 
connecting series of varieties in that case ?
According to the technical idea of a species, which makes it em- 
brace all individual examples which have (or might have) descended 
from a common progenitor, all my plants â€” whether cowslips, prim- 
roses, or varieties of either â€” must belong to one single species ; and 
thus we fall back upon the Linnean notion of one " Primula veris," 
with its subordinate varieties of " elatior " and " acaulis." This view 
will scarce find favour in the eyes of those botanists who labour un- 
der the " species-splitting " monomania.
The wild cowslip and 
primrose have well-marked characters for distinction, and characters 
which are usually very regular and constant.
So far they are now 
dissimilar, and more constantly dissimilar, than are numerous pairs 
of " book-species," which are unhesitatingly received as really dis- 
tinct in nature.
Unite plants so dissimilar and so readily distin- 
guished, as are the cowslip and primrose, â€” and what are we then to 
say about the frivolous attempts at species-making among the Rubi 
and Polygona in vogue at present, as among the Rosae and Menthae 
in former years ?
If we allow the cowslip and primrose to be two species, and yet 
allow that one can pass into the other, either directly or through the 
intermediate oxlip, we abandon the definition of species, as usually 
given, and fall into the transition-of-species theory, advocated in the 
* Vestiges.' 
I do not see that we get more clear of the difficulty by assuming, 
without proof thereof, that the " Claygate oxlip " is a true example of 
hybridity.
Do hybrids, if fertile, produce at once their own like, 
the like of each parent, and a progeny of intermediate likeness also ?
At best, the hybrid is only half of either species, â€” and can the half 
produce the whole ?
Such an event would assuredly not be " like 
producing like " through an endless succession of descents ?
Let a few other cases be adduced, between reputed species equally 
dissimilar, and we shall be forced to recast our ideas and definition 
of the term " species." It would unavoidably become arbitrary and 
conventional ; with no more exactness or constancy of application, 
than we can give to the terms " genus " or " order."

Myosotis stiicta.
â€” A plant possessing several characters in ac- 
cordance with the descriptions of Myosotis stricta, Link, occurs in 
several places.
It was first observed on a sandy bank in company 
with M.
versicolor and M.
collina, from both which it may be rea- 
dily distinguished by its flowers commencing at the base of the stem, 
below several of the leaves, and the calyx not spreading as in collina ; 
the flowers are paler and rather smaller ; in M.
collina the flowers 
appear perfect when erect, while in my plant they are fully blown 
on the curled portion of the raceme, and by the time they arrive in 
the erect position are withered.
I have not been able to detect the 
hooked hairs in the living plant, but when dry they are curved in 
various directions.
I have observed this plant for some time, and 
find no forms approaching either M.
versicolor or M.
collina.
I 
shall be happy to submit my specimens to a comparison with conti- 
nental specimens of Myosotis stricta.

Occurrence of Alyssum calycinum near Epping.
By Edward Newman.
Mr. Henry Doubleday informs me that Alyssum calycinum, a 
plant well known as a native of Europe, has been found several times 
by Mr. John Ray in the vicinity of Epping.
It occurs in corn-fields, 
and Mr. Doubleday considers that, in all probability, it has been in- 
troduced, like many other plants, in foreign seed.

It creeps up here and there among the Gymnomitrion concinnatum 
of Nees, overtopping it and then reclining : the colour of the ujDper 
part is reddish brown, but that of the lower, older, and more shaded 
parts is quite discharged ; stems slender, an inch long, consisting of 
the growth of former seasons, topped by that of the present year.
Except near the top it is attached by rootlets throughout its length.
The leaves are convex and largely cellular, the sinus between the seg-

characterized by Professor Lindley.' 
' On a monstrosity of Gentiana campestris.

Dickie, M.D., 
Lecturer on Botany in the University and King's College of Aber- 
deen.' 
' On the British Desmidieae.
By John Ralfs, Esq., M.R.C.S., 
Penzance.' 
Dr. Dickie's paper describes certain malformations in the flowers 
of Gentiana campestris, which occurred growing in almost pure sand 
near the sea at Aberdeen.
The calyx presented the usual number 
and arrangement of parts ; the corolla was mostly natural, but some- 
times 5-cleft ; stamens four, sometimes mare, in most cases partially 
or entirely petaloid ; these three whorls, sepals, petals and stamens, 
presenting the usual relation to each other.
The greatest deviation 
from the natural structure occurred in the pistil, which, in many in- 
stances, was represented by flower-buds, extending, in one instance, 
to eight, in another to six, five of them forming a whorl round a cen- 
tral bud ; and sometimes ovaries, nearly natural, were intermixed with 
flower-buds.
Dr. Dickie gives a table showing the number of divisions of corolla, 
number of stamens and number of flower-buds representing the pistil, 
as they occurred in ten specimens.
The ninth of these contained 
six flower-buds, five forming a regular whorl, and the sixth occupy- 
ing the centre of each.
Of these buds he gives a detailed description 
as under : 
No. 1.
Calyx none; corolla of ten petals ; stamens ten, alternate 
with the petals ; the place of the ovary was occupied by two flower- 
buds, each with single perianth, imperfect stamens and one ovary in each.
No. 2.
Sepals five ; petals eight ; stamens ten, in two whorls ; ova- 
ries two, almost natural.
No. 3.
Sepals three ; petals three ; stamens three, alternate with 
the petals ; ovary of three carpellary leaves with six rows of ovules.
No. 4.
Sepals five, an ovary adhering to the outside of one ; petals 
five ; stamens five, alternate with the petals ; ovary of five carpellary 
leaves, with ten rows of ovules.
No. 5.
Sepals three ; corollas two, each of three petals ; stamens 
three ; ovary single.
224 
No. 6.
The central flower ; calyx none ; corolla 5-cleft ; stamens 
five, petaloid ; ovary of three carpellary leaves ; ovules in six rows.
" In the tenth flower the centre was occupied by three ovaries and 
two small flower-buds.
One of the ovaries was much compressed, 
two carpellary leaves open half way, its ovules perfect ; another of 
the same size and structure enclosed one like itself, the ovules imper- 
fect." A few other deviations are recorded, and the author continues : 
" I would particularly allude to the changes which the ovarium and 
ovules present, and the inferences which may be drawn from these.
A simple ovarium is considered to be a modified leaf folded upon it- 
self, the margins united, and these alone, in most cases, constituting 
the placenta (necessarily double), and producing ovules.
It was at 
the same time supposed that the stigma was a mere prolongation of 
the midrib of the carpellary leaf, and, therefore, single and terminal.
The greatest botanist of this or any other age, has satisfactorily de- 
monstrated that each simple pistillum or carpel has necessarily two 
stigmata, which are to be regarded not as terminal, but lateral ; the 
style where present being only a mere attenuation, in many cases very 
gradual, of the whole body of the ovarium.
Most Gramineae, many 
Euphorbiaceae, several Irideae, &c., are stated as illustrating this 
point.
The ovaria, in some of the monstrous flowers already de- 
scribed, appeared to afford proof of the same, and many carpels in 
the earlier stages of their development, yield ample evidence that 
the opinion alluded to is in strict accordance with nature." 
After alluding to observations of Professor Henslow, on the trans- 
formation of the ovules of mignionette into leaves, and those of M.
Brogniart on a monstrosity of Delphinium elatum.
Dr. Dickie dis- 
sents in some degree from the opinions of the last-named botanist.
" From careful examination I have been convinced that in some car- 
pels, whose ovules are numerous, the order of development is from 
the base to the apex.
In very early stages of the carpel, the ovules 
are confined to the lower part alone, there being no trace of them to- 
wards the upper part of the placenta.
At a more advanced stage they 
occur throughout a greater portion of its extent, but still there is a very 
evident difference, previous to impregnation, between the progress 
made by ovules from the base of a placenta, and those nearer to its 
apex ; this is obvious to the unassisted eye in regard to the deve- 
lopment of the membranes, but actual measurement removes all 
doubt."

On the Theory of * Progressive Development^ applied in explana- 
tion of the Origin and Transmutation of Species.
By 
Hewett C.
Watson, Esq., F.L.S.
(Concluded from page 168).
My former communications upon this subject ( Phytol.
for April, 
May and June ) shortly stated the theory of ' Progressive Develop- 
ment,' as set forth in a work lately published under the title of 'Vesti- 
ges of the Natural History of Creation.' And 1 endeavoured to supply 
a botanical deficiency in that work, by adducing some examples of 
the facts and arguments bearing upon the question, which might be 
drawn from phytological investigations.
It is now proposed to bring 
the question within narrower limits, by adverting to the conclusions 
which are suggested by the facts before mentioned.
I am informed 
that the author of the ' Vestiges ' has much modified his views in the 
later editions of his volume.
If so, it is of little consequence to my 
present object.
The idea of progressive development was not his 
own, except by adoption ; nor, as I think, did it derive the support of 
a single additional fact from the work in question.
The merit of the 
volume consisted in its well-told and well-arranged assemblage of 
known facts, not in any novelty of ideas or novelty of facts.
The 
author had read rather than observed, had speculated rather than 
experimented ; and hence, while he may have popularised and diffused 
his subject, he can scarcely be held to have advanced it in any way, 
as a question of science or philosophy.
His mere opinions, apart 
from facts, are of no value, and may change with each edition.
The conclusion, that " like produces like," through an indefinite 
series of generations, seems almost inevitable to the botanist, whose 
range of observation takes in only the natural course of events during 
the quarter of a century, more or less, which comprehends the period 
of vigorous mental power in a single individual.
The same conclu- 
sion must still appear sound, although we extend the range of obser- 
vation, by comparing living plants of the present year, with careful 
descriptions, pictorial representations, or dried specimens of those 
which lived a hundred years ago.
Still the same conclusion must be 
drawn, when we compare a young oak or chestnut with old trees of 
their kind which have existed through centuries past.
Thus far, the resemblance between the past and the present, in the 
vegetable world, is sufficiently close and certain to warrant a conclu- 
sion that plants repeat their own images by hereditary descent through 
a long series of years, to which we can assign no limit.
These images, it is true, are not always perfect likenesses.

tions of climate and soil, or of other conditions, are accompanied by 
corresponding variations in the plants.
But, limiting the period of 
our observation, as above, these variations are usually found to be 
temporary ; so that we may say, there is a standard or average type 
for each kind, which is repeated in the individual plants as nearly as 
internal health and external conditions will allow.
This supposed 
standard or average 1 will here express by the term ' central type.' 
The central type will thus be nearly synonymous with the proper 
metaphysical notion of a species, apart from its varieties.
It is usu- 
ally this same central type which is described in the specific charac- 
ter of a plant; although occasionally authors endeavour so to form their 
specific characters, that these shall include all varieties of the species 
as well as the central type.
Individual plants which differ from the central type are designated 
" varieties." Among varieties we may include all the plants which are 
marked by any obvious difference, ranging from the more trifling 
variations of colour or size, to those which are so wide as to raise a 
question whether the plants really belong to the same central type or 
species.
Varieties appear to be less permanent than the central types from 
which they originate.
A tendency to change again is usually observed 
in the descendants of such varieties ; and the further change is 
frequently in a reversed direction, or back towards the central type.
Among plants in a wild state, the tendency to keep or to resume the 
central type commonly seems to be greater than the tendency to vary 
from it.
Hence there is an appearance of permanence in species, as 
though each kind had a limit to its power of change, beyond which 
its descendants can never pass in a direction aberrant from the central 
type, and from which limit there is a tendency to return to that type.
But all this, be it remembered, refers to a very restricted period in 
the history of our globe.
It is that space of time only, the events of 
which are most clearly seen and understood by botanists.
And it is 
so very short a space, comparatively with the spaces which come into 
the estimates of geologists, that we can scarcely deem an inappreci- 
able change of the central type, during that short space, to be suflici- 
ently conclusive proof against the gradual transition of species during 
spaces of time immeasurably more extended.
Moreover, we must avoid the straining of our fact beyond its true 
bearings.
Though the central types of certain species may have 
remained the same during some scores or centuries of years, this one 
fact cannot negative a possibility that there are also varieties of the 
same or of other species which, during the same time, have gradually 
227 
become more aud more unlike their respective central types ; until, 
through diminished likeness, they may now actually be referred to 
different central types, â€” that is, may be described as distinct species.
Further, it is to be kept in memory, that when it becomes man's 
interest or pleasure to extend the variations of plants from their cen- 
tral types, he can effect this desired result much more rapidly and 
widely than is seen to occur amongst plants in a state of nature.
By 
taking the more decided varieties as parents of a fresh stock, through 
several successive generations, and so gradually rendering them more 
and more unlike the central type, we appear to weaken their tendency 
to resume that type.
Hitherto, no limit has been ascertained to this 
power of changing plants by varying varieties.
Some of the species 
which have been long subjected to this process, have been run into 
varieties so widely different from their known or supposed central 
types, that if any botanist had first found their extreme forms in a 
newly explored country, he would assuredly have believed them to 
belong to different central types â€” to be totally distinct species.
In this, as in every other such process, man works only with the 
powers of nature.
Although brought about immediately through his 
instrumentality, the changes effected in the plants are simply the na- 
tural results of those conditions to which he subjects them.
There 
seems no reason to suppose that the same result which man brings 
about more rapidly, could not have been brought about, though more 
gradually, without his interference.
If man can produce hereditary 
varieties of plants, which remain permanently different from their cen- 
tral types, under his care, why cannot nature also produce such heredi- 
tary varieties ?
And in what respect does an hereditary variety, the 
origin of which is unknown, differ from a species ?
Looking to present events in nature, and to results produced by the 
interfering agency of man, the following conclusions seem reason- 
able : â€” 
1st.
â€” The central type of a species is reproduced and remains the 
same through many successive generations.
2ndly.
â€” Nevertheless, individual plants do occasionally differ more 
or less widely from their central type, and thus become varieties.
3rdly.
â€” The descendants of varieties frequently revert to the central 
type of the species from which those varieties originated.
But we 
cannot show that all varieties eventually do thus revert.
4thly.
â€” The effects of cultivation, in rendering varieties more differ- 
ent, and perhaps more permanently different, from their central types, 
together with the occurrence of hereditary varieties among wild plants, 
228 
give plausibility to the supposition that varieties do not always revert 
to the central types of the species from which they originated.
5thly.
â€” A variety ( if such there be ) in which the tendency to re- 
produce its own like has superseded the tendency to revert to the 
central type of the original species, would possess the essential 
character of a species in itself,â€” namely, its own distinct and per- 
manent central type.
It has not yet been proved that any such variety 
exists, neither can it be disproved.
6thly.
â€” The discordant opinions of botanists, as to which plants are 
species and which are varieties only â€” the occurrence of varieties in- 
termediate between presumed species â€” the power of changing from 
the central type into varieties, and back again to the central type â€” 
the tendency of some varieties to become hereditary, probably in obe- 
dience to the law of ' like producing like ' â€” with other facts, point to- 
wards the conclusion that varieties may gradually become species ; 
although these facts are far from sufficient to establish that conclusion.
On the whole, therefore, we seem to be justified in asserting, that 
our knowledge of the present events in nature, taken by itself, should 
incline us to a conclusion which is directly adverse to the theory of 
" progressive development " or " transition of species ;" yet without 
affording us any actual disproof of that theory.
It is otherwise when our range of thought embraces the vastly 
wider space of time, the events of which are investigated by geolo- 
gists.
There we find ample evidence to justify the conclusion that 
different species succeeded to each other.
And no better mode of ac- 
counting for this succession has been suggested, than the hypothesis 
that one species passed into another, under changing external condi- 
tions.
Supposing this transition of species to have taken place very 
gradually, and through a very long series of descents, it would not re- 
quire more rapid change ( from central types into varieties, and from 
a less variety into a greater ) than we see actually occurring in the 
production of varieties at the present period of the earth's history.
Could we ascertain that some varieties will continue to vary from 
their central type, through many successive descents ; and that, as 
they become less similar to their original central type, the tendency 
of " like to produce like " will overpower and supersede the tendency 
to revert to the original type ; â€” in this case, we might hold the " tran- 
sition of species " to be a theory founded on facts.
At present, it is 
scarcely more than a plausible hypothesis, invented to account for 
facts, and accounting for them better than any other hypothetical 
suggestion has done.

Notes on Structural Botany.
By William Wilson, Esq.
Anatropous Ovule; what is it?
â€” If any of the readers of the 
' Phytologist' have had the same difficulty in understanding this terra 
that I have experienced, they will not regard the following remarks 
as superfluous.
My reasons for supposing them of importance, and 
my excuse for certain crude observations which appear in my " Re- 
searches in Embryogeny" ( Phytol.
i. 734 ), will appear in the follow- 
ing quotations from a work which furnishes but few occasions for criti- 
cism, and is therefore the more likely to inspire implicit confidence 
in the accuracy and perspicuity of all its statements.
I allude to Pro- 
fessor Lindley's ' Introduction to Botany.' 
In reference to the anatropous class of ovules, he states that the 
" axis remains rectilinear ; but one of the sides grows rapidly, while 
the opposite side does not grow at all, so that the [forameniferous] 
point of the ovule is gradually pushed round to the base; while the base 
of the nucleus is removed from the hilum [point of attachment of the 
ovule to the funiculus or placenta] to the opposite extremity.
â€” When 
the base of the nucleus is thus removed from the base of the ovule, a 
communication between the two is always maintained by means of a 
vascular cord called the raphe.
This raphe, which originates in the 
placenta, runs up one side of the ovule until it reaches the base of the 
nucleus ; and there expands into a sort of vascular disk, which is call- 
ed the chalaza.''â€”{ Ed. 2, p, 180 ).
I would first remark on the vagueness of this definition in reference 
to the time when the assumed change of position of the nucleus com- 
mences, and especially to the time of its completion.
An explanation 
on this point is indeed given with PI.
5, but was overlooked by me 
until very recently.
Secondly, the definition implies that it is only the nucleus which 
makes culhutes, and that the two integuments remain, as to their bascy 
quite stationary, the inevitable inference being that the raphe or vas- 
cular cord of connexion is within the secundine and primine.
This 
to me has been a grievous stumbling-block, and I have repeatedly 
sought for such a proof of locomotion on the part of the nucule, but 
always in vain.
Foiled in my endeavours to detect an internal raphe, 
I began to doubt the propriety of the term anatropous.
Mr. Bentham (whose merit and profound science as a botanist 
need no acknowledgment from me ) appears to have had some difli- 
culty in adjusting his correct idea of this modification of an ovule to 
the conventional term used to express it.
He says of the Leguminosce 
230 
( in the ' London Journal of Botany,' iii.
130) that the "ovule is 
essentially anatropous, that is to say, the chalaza is separated from 
the hilum by a raphe of greater or less length, and the foramen is 
brought down to near the hilum," but he does not observe upon the 
fact that in every instance of an anatropous ovule, the chalaza and 
raphe are both external with regard to the primine and secundine.
If we suppose an orthotropous ovule ( that is, one in which the base 
is really the lowest point as to position, and the foramen at the top ) 
standing at first upright upon a funiculus of its own length, and after- 
wards the apex of the ovule ( primine, secundine and all) turned down 
so as to touch the base of the funiculus, and the funiculus itself 
brought into a state of intimate adhesion throughout its whole length 
with the surface of the primine, we shall have a correct representation 
of the actual structure and appearance of an anatropous ovule at the 
period of fecundation.
Would it not therefore be more correct, and 
more in harmony with the original use of the term hilum, to consider 
the apex of the adhering funiculus the real point of attachment be- 
tween the funiculus and the ovule ?
The fact appears to be, that the primine, secundine and nucleus 
have invariably one common point of junction : any thing asserted to 
the contrary depends solely on the technical ( and in this case mis- 
chievous ) employment of the term base.
Had the foramen of the 
ovule always been fixed upon as indicating the apex of the ovule and 
the opposite extremity the base ( except in those cases where the nu- 
cleus is bent or doubled), the confusion evident in the present defini- 
tion would have been avoided, and the term anatropous, independent 
almost of any theory on the subject, would have been unobjection- 
able ; at present, it expresses what to me appears a false view of the 
actual growth and development of the ovule.
The illustrations in 
Lindley's work at Plate V, figs.
18, 19 and 20, are probably imagi- 
nary, and not from nature : but even admitting them to be accurate 
representations, they do not, in the points here commented upon, sup- 
port the definition.
1 have never been able to find a period when the 
ovule, if cognisable at all, had not already assumed the anatropous 
state.
To prevent any misconception of my meaning, I would here define 
a raphe as an adherent funiculus, embracing a portion of the ovule; 
and I propose that in future, the extremity of the raphe most remote 
from the placenta be considered the true base of the ovule ; that being 
the real point of junction, as indicated by the line of vascular tissue 
within the raphe.
231 
Spines.
â€” Professor Lindley defines a spine as " the imperfect evo- 
lution of a leaf-bud, and therefore a branch." That some branches 
may be checked in their growth so as to be changed into spines, I 
will not deny ; but the usual development of spines is not in accord- 
ance with this view.
They are found on the shoots of the current 
year, and occupy ( as to time as well as position ) the place of a leaf- 
bud ; in other words, they appear one year sooner than a branch, 
under ordinary circumstances, can be developed at that point.
Nettle Stings.
â€” The extremity of the sting is at first hermetically 
closed up by a small globular button, not unlike the button of a fen- 
cing-foil, but placed obliquely, so that the slightest touch breaks it off, 
when the sharp extremity of the tubular sting enters the skin, and 
pours into the wound the venomousjuice lodged in the spongy elastic 
receptacle at the base of the sting.
If a nettle leaf be grasped with 
violence, the hand is seldom injured ; owing to the fracture of the 
sting itself, which cannot puncture the skin after its fine point has 
been turned aside or broken off.
Spiral Vessels on the Seeds of Collomia, 8^c.
â€” Those who have not 
examined them will be much gratified by placing thin slices of the 
seeds, one at a time, under a microscope of moderate power, and ob- 
serving the effect which immediately ensues when a drop of water is 
added ; but they will be still more interested with the serpent-like 
movements of similar vessels in the Â«c/(eÂ«m of Salvia.
If an unripe 
berry of the mistletoe be examined under a microscope, a portion of the 
internal viscous substance lying nearest to the seed will be found to ex- 
hibit traces of similar spirals.
May not the economy of all these be 
the same ?
Anthers of Viscum album.
â€” I know of no analogous structure in 
other plants : the anther is not valvular, and adheres, without any fi- 
lament, to the surface of the petal.
The pollen is contained in little 
cysts imbedded in the substance of the anther, opening irregularly.
William Wilson.
Orford Mount, Warrington, July 1, 1845.
P. S.
â€” If it be not a misemployment of the pages of the 'Phytolo- 
gist' to correct an inadvertance in one of my former communications 
(Phytol.
i. 6 ), I beg to state that the leaves of the holly have the pe- 
tiole articulated as in ordinary cases, but that the articulation in ao-e 
is scarcely if at all perceptible.
If the young leaves be examined 
there can be no mistake.

Agaricus cristatus raised from Seed.
By George Sparkes, Esq.
For some years past I have been industriously sowing in a Ward's 
case the sporules of different Agarics, and during the two last months 
have had the pleasure of obtaining a good crop of Agaricus cristatus.
Perhaps this may interest some of your readers.

Bromley in Kent, 30th June, 1845.
Our Reply on the name Lastroia recurva.
The discussion on the name Lastraea recurva appears to have origi- 
nated in a review (Phytol.
ii.
22), in which we endeavoured to defend 
the term recurva against Mr. Babington's strictures previously pub- 
lished in the 93rd number of the ' Annals and Magazine of Natural 
History.' Our contributors having expressed their opinions freely on 
the subject, and nothing now remaining in our hands for publication, 
it seems desirable that we close the discussion by availing ourselves 
of our undoubted right to reply.
Our view of the case has been sup- 
ported by the Rev. Mr.
Bree ( Phytol.
ii.
75), Mr. Wilson ( Id. 113 ), 
Mr. Newman (Id. 114), Mr. Watson ( Id. 170), and Mr. Edmonston 
( Id. 183), and has been opposed by Mr. Babington (Id. 113 ) and 
Dr. Bell Salter ( Id. 200 ).
It may perhaps be said that the question 
under discussion is one of individual interest to three of these bota- 
nists, since Mr. Bree is its author, Mr. Newman its adopter, and Mr.
Babington wishes to suppress it in favour of a name of his own.
We 
therefore exclude the arguments of these gentlemen from the observa- 
tions which follow.
The other disputants are perfectly unprejudiced, 
and can only have in view the adoption of the best name.
We believe 
that almost all British botanists will regard the brief but pithy con- 
tribution of Mr. Wilson as overwhelming evidence in our favour, and 
not a few have regarded Mr. Watson's remarks as equally decisive, but 
we must not shelter ourselves under these high authorities, and thus 
endeavour to escape from the clever and pointed remarks of Dr.
Bell Salter, the only disinterested opponent of the name.
Dr. Bell Salter seems to place the matter before our readers some- 
what syllogistically, thus : â€” 
1. â€” There exists a uniformity of practice among botanists in the 
use of the prefixes in and re.
2. â€” The structure of Lastrsea recurva is that expressed by the pre- 
fix in.
233 
Ergo, the name of recurva as applied to the Lastra^a in question is 
in every way isolated and exceptional.
The^V*^ of these positions we hold to be totally unsupported by 
evidence ; hence the second becomes scarcely more than a matter of 
opinion, and the conclusion, if based upon false premises, falls to the 
ground.
Let us examine the first position : â€” 
Dr. Bell Salter asserts that " common acceptation has universally ap- 
plied the term dorsum or back to that surface of any part which is si- 
tuated outwardly before its having expanded, and in accordance with 
this we have in applied to every curvature, which, supposing the part 
in question to be unexpanded, would be towards the axis of the plant, 
as iwvolutus ; and re, with the solitary exception of the controverted 
Lastraea, to a curvature, which, on a similar supposition, would be in 
the opposite direction, as reflexus," ( Phytol.
ii.
200).
Now it ap- 
pears to us, that our correspondent assumes this position without tak- 
ing the trouble to examine a single page of his Smith, his Hooker or 
his Babington to see how far his statement is in accordance with their 
usage.
Let him turn to the genus Pteris as characterised by either of 
these authors.
Smith says " Cover from the iwflexed margin of the 
frond." Hooker says " Involucres formed of the Â«??flexed margin of 
the frond." Babington says " Covered by a continuous indusium 
formed of the mflexed margin." Now every botanist knows the direc- 
tion in which the margin of Pteris is curved, and every botariist will 
at once see that it is precisely the curvature which Dr. Salter asserts is 
described by re, for he goes on to inform our readers that " according 
to the universal application of the particles in and re, a fern would be 
mcurvedor2/?flected, which is concave on the polished or smooth sur- 
face, and recurved or reflexed if concave towards that which bears the 
sori, and that alike whether the bending happen to be upwards or 
downwards," ( Id. 201 ).
In the familiar instance of Pteris, the 
usage of Smith and Babington is diametrically at variance with this 
passage, and supposing Smith accidentally in error, supposing Hooker 
accidentally adopting Smith's phraseology, still Babington's is a new, 
we might say, an original description, and the word zwflexed is used, 
not because Smith used it or because Hooker used it, but because the 
author thought it the right word.
Whether in strict justice we may 
or may not suppose that all these authors use the in advisedly, in 
courtesy we are surely bound to believe that they duly investigated 
the curvature in the pinnules of Pteris, and considered that such a 
curvature was properly described by the prefix in question.
Our next aim would have been to show that the prefixes in and re 
Vol. II.
2 g 
234 
should, in order to give them an intelligible meaning, be opposed to 
each other, that they should express curvatures in opposite directions; 
but Dr. Salter admits this, and therefore there is no necessity for our 
urging it on his attention.
Well then.
Smith, Hooker and Babington 
having carefully and advisedly declared a pinnule //iflexed which is 
convex on the polished or smooth suface, these authors, supposing 
they assigned the opposite prefix re to the opposite curvature, would 
describe as reflexed or recurved the pinnules of Lastraea recurva, 
which are cor\cnve on the polished or smooth surface.
But here we must pause, for we are scarcely inclined to allow our 
great authorities the benefit of the implied compliment that they use 
these prefixes in accordance with any plan : were we to do this, we 
should convey a very erroneous idea to our readers.
Those in ad- 
vance of ourselves would exclaim "Does the 'Phytologist' imagine these 
authors adopt any uniform plan in their orismology ?" Those who 
have not studied the English Flora, the British Flora and the Manual 
as we have done, may exclaim, " The point must be settled now that 
the 'Phytologist' adduces such united and overwhelming evidence !" 
The first conclusion, dear readers !
would be unjust to us, the second 
unjust to yourselves.
These great authors follow no uniform plan of 
orismology.
A facetious writer, judging from the strangeness of cer- 
tain Old-Bailey verdicts given after dinner,has suggested that the juries, 
in order to save themselves the labour of thinking, pronounced the 
prisoners alternately guilty or not guilty.
Our botanists have done 
much the same.
It is well known that the fertile pinnules of Thelypteris, 
aquilina and crispus possess a curvature in the same direction.
Smith 
describes them as revolute in Thelypteris, mflexed in the genus Pteris, 
revolute in the species aquilina, and reflexed in the species crispus ; 
Hooker omits this important character in Thelypteris, calls it Â«wflexed 
in aquilina, and revolute in crispus ; and Babington calls it revolute 
in Thelypteris, 2wflexed in aquilina, reflexed in crispus.
So much 
for uniformity of practice in attaching the prefixes : we are really as- 
tonished that any botanist should allude to "universal" practice in 
this respect : we fancy our correspondent must have written the pas- 
sage ironically.
Be that as it may.
Dr. Bell Salter will see that he 
has provoked this analysis : he has brought to light this discrepancy 
in practice, this unutterable confusion in terms, by not confining the 
question within its proper limits, by allowing himself to lose sight of 
the word recurvus and limiting his attention almost exclusively to 
terms which formed no part of the original inquiry.
We therefore are 
compelled to fallback on the views of Mr. Watson ( Phytol.
ii.
170), 
235 
who explains the meaning of recurvus as curved contrary to the usual 
direction, whether upwards, downwards, outwards or backwards ; and 
this is most undoubtedly a distinguishing character of Lastraea re- 
curva : no other British Fern has a similar curvature, while several, 
as we have already seen, possess an opposite ( the usual ) curvature.
But before the terra received the powerful advocacy of Mr. Watson, 
Mr. Wilson's opinion (Phytol.
ii.
113) that the name " was a/?/ and 
expressive, and in perfect harmony with the use of the term in other 
cases" appeared to us so sound, so satisfactory and so incontrovertible, 
that we have regretted any attempt should be made to renew the dis- 
cussion.
We venture to express a hope that no further idea of chang- 
ing the name will be entertained : but that our botanists will rather 
endeavour by diligent search to find this fern in other localities, since 
its great beauty and peculiarity is rapidly causing its extermination in 
the vicinity of London.
A Day's Botanizing on the Lizard.
By the Rev. W.
S. Hore, 
M.A., F.L.S.
A SHORT account of a day's botanizing on the Lizard, a district most 
interesting not only on account of its geological features, but also from 
the many rare and beautiful plants which grow on its rocky and steep 
cliffs, may not prove unacceptable to the readers of the ' Phytologist.' 
Should any of them undertake an investigation of the Botany of this 
mass of sei-pentine, micaceous and hornblende rocks, the present 
sketch will enable them with little difficulty to obtain, in a single day, 
the species referred to below, and thus afford time for inspecting more 
carefully the whole line of coast from Porthalla to Mullion, the limits 
of the serpentine formation.
I believe that a close examination of this 
district would amply reward the exertions of any active botanist, who 
might feel inclined to dedicate a fortnight to its accomplishment, and 
that he would find himself at the expiration of that time in posses- 
sion of a richer stock of plants than he could have collected during a 
similar period in any other part of England.
The season that I would recommend is the beginning of July, when 
the Lizard plants are in finest condition, and when the whole of those 
enumerated in the present paper, with the exception of Scilla verna, 
may be obtained.
To prevent disappointment I would however state 
that Erica vagans, the Cornish or Goonhilly heath, does not flower till 
August, and that any one whose principal object was to witness this 
236 
lovely plant, covering, with its snowy and pink blossoms, acres upon 
acres of barren moor, would do well to postpone his visit till the first 
week in September.
The summer species, it is true, will then have 
passed away ; but still a rich harvest of Corrigiola littoralis, Elatine 
hexandra, Chenopodium botryoides &c.
may be culled on the banks 
of Loo Pool, a wide expanse of water near Helston, about six miles 
from the Lizard, and also Illecebrum verticillatum, Exacum filiforme, 
and Lotus hispidus, from the adjoining country : so that even at that 
advanced period of the year a visit would not prove altogether fruitless.
I have deviated somewhat from my intentions when I commenced 
this paper, having entered upon what may be called a general sum- 
mary of Lizard vegetation, and'an invitation to botanists to come, in- 
spect and gather for themselves.
I shall therefore proceed at once 
without further interruption to furnish an account of a day's wanderings 
on the Lizard in June.
I started with my friend, the Rev. C.
A. Johns, in a gig from Helston 
on the morning of the 11th for Landewednack, the village adjacent to 
the Lizard lighthouses.
Our immediate object was to search for the 
Trifolium discovered near Cadgewith by Babington,in July, 1839, and 
which he identified as Trifolium Bocconi, Savi.
I had been kindly 
furnished by this indefatigable botanist, both with the exact locality 
and a specimen of the plant; but the latter was in such a scorched and 
mutilated condition; that I really feared some mistake had been made, 
and that the plant was nothing more than a stunted example of Trifo- 
lium striatum.
Though well aware of my friend Babiugton's botanical 
accuracy, I could not consent to receive even his dictum, pronounced 
over such imperfect plants as those collected by him, and therefore 
determined to use no ordinary exertions in my attempts to rediscover the 
habitat.
I knew well that the plant must be in good condition, and 
that its identity with or distinctness from striatum would be at once 
manifest.
Having traversed the Goonhilly downs, on which we found 
Genista anglica and Chara gracilis, and succeeded in capturing a 
beautiful specimen of Zootoca vivipara, of a splendid green colour, we 
reached the road leading to Ruan minor.
Here I quitted the gig for 
the Bocconi station, which is situated about two miles from the turn- 
ing.
At Ruan minor I commenced work, and shortly met with a lux- 
uriant specimen of Trifolium striatum near the spot marked out by 
Babington : my doubts were now much increased, but I continued, 
almost microscopically, to examine, step by step, the stony walls 
which bound the road to Cadgewith.
At length a lighter hue on the 
western wall some yards a-head, announced the presence of a new 
237 
plant ; this, on approaching it nearer, I found to be Trit'olium Bocconi, 
occupying a space of about twenty yards in extent.
It was in good 
condition, and at once all doubts vanished as to its being a species 
perfectly distinct from both T.
striatum and scabrum.
It is a much 
smaller plant, of erect growth, with smooth leaves and of palish foliage.
The corolla is light straw-coloured, but in one patch which I gather- 
ed it was tinged with red : the fruit in no single instance had been 
perfected.
Johns, who had now rejoined me, and myself hunted for 
it in the adjoining fields, but without success, possibly on account of 
the short time we could afford to dedicate to the search.
Whether 
the plant be indigenous or introduced would be difficult to say : had 
we discovered it in an additional spot we should both have firmly as- 
serted the former.
Having obtained a fair supply for ourselves and 
correspondents of this interesting trefoil, we proceeded with the Rev.
P. V, Robinson, rector of Landewednack, through Cadgewith to one 
of the stations of Asparagus officinalis, which is situated about a quar- 
ter of a mile to the eastward of that place.
Before reaching it I found 
Herniaria glabra in a luxuriant state, and Johns about the same spot 
met with the Trifolium which I discovered in 1838 near the Lizard 
Lights, and which is given in Babington's Manual as Trifolium incar- 
natura, var.
/3, Molinieri.
Whether the plant is a mere variety of T.
incarnatum I much doubt, and therefore avail myself of the present 
opportunity to point out the differences between its characters and 
those found in the diagnoses of the typical form, as given by Koch, 
Babington and others.
Trifolium incarnatum is said to be erect by 
Babington, Koch and De CandoUe, and ascending by Reichenbach ; 
to have its stipules obtuse by Babington, broad and obtuse by Koch, 
and obtuse and spJiacelate by De Candolle (the Molinieri variety 
wanting the latter character) : to have the mouth of the calyx hairy by 
Babington, and the throat obsoletely hairy by Koch.
The Lizard 
plant is in most cases prostrate, but sometimes with a tendency to as- 
cend ; the stipules are narrow, ovate and acute ; the throat most de- 
cidedly naked ; the hairs about the mouth of the calyx are such only 
as necessarily result from the villose character which this part pre- 
sents.
Whether these discrepancies are of sufficient importance to 
justify a separation of the two plants, I leave to more able botanists 
to determine.
I should not omit to state, that not a single specimen 
with a red corolla was to be seen amongst the countless numbers 
which we observed on this and the former occasions.
As to this Trifolium being decidedly indigenous, the shadow of a 
doubt cannot be entertained by any one who has seen it growing in 
238 
another locality near Ky nance Cove, which we subsequently detected.
There, on the side of a ravine, quite out of sight of any land which 
has been cultivated, it grows in the greatest luxuriance, forming a 
large portion of the herbage.
Years and years must have elapsed un- 
der the most favourable circumstances to have allowed it to have 
taken possession of such a residence, and to have ejected its previous 
possessors, supposing that it had been cultivated within a moderate 
distance of this locality.
But the summit of the cliff appears never 
to have been broken by the plough, and the turf is as compact and 
solid as can be imagined, producing the ordinary plants of the dis- 
trict.
I also made inquiries respecting the cultivation of the Trifo- 
lium incarnatura, and found that it was not known in the neighbour- 
hood.
These incidental, though I trust not irrelevant remarks on the two 
Trifolia, have somewhat extended the original limits within which I 
purposed confining the account of my Lizard w^anderings.
I will 
therefore more briefly record our further proceedings.
We did not venture into the Asparagus station, partly I believe for 
want of time, and partly on account of the numerous vipers which 
domicile in the long grass where the plant grows.
We consequently 
retraced our steps to Cadgewith, and proceeded along the coast to 
Landewednack, where we were engaged to dine with Mr. Robinson.
On our road we met with Vicia lutea, which Johns had found during 
our excursion in 1838, and which was then not known to grow in the 
south-western counties, and Herniaria glabra, ft.
suhciliata.
The 
scenery along this part of the coast is most beautiful, withdrawing our 
attention most repeatedly from the legitimate duties of the day.
Having partaken of Mr. Robinson's hospitality, we again started 
forth, directing our steps coastwise to that richest of spots, Kynance 
Cove.
Here the scenery was of a higher character than that which 
we had witnessed in the morning, and we lingered ofttimes in our 
course to gaze on the many beauties which presented themselves to our 
notice.
Still we bore in mind that our vasculums were to be filled, 
and we accordingly proceeded to store away such rarities as Alsine 
verna, AnthyllisVulneraria,/3.
Dillenii, Allium Schcenoprasum, Genista 
pilosa, Scilla verna, &c.
It was between the Lizard Lights and Ky- 
nance Cove that we came on the locality of Trifolium incarnatum, var.
Molinieri ?
alluded to above, a distance of five miles along the coast, 
and upwards of two in a straight line from the Cadgewith habitat.
When we arrived at Kynance Cove, the shades of evening were be- 
ginning to close around us, and we had yet to obtain other botanical 
239 
rarities.
We accordingly gave up all idea of passing over to Aspa- 
ragus Island, and calling at the post-office and other departments be- 
longing to his Satanic majesty at that spot.
Geranium sylvaticum, 
Cladium mariscus, &c.
we allowed to remain immolested ; and having 
found ourselves too early for Orobanche rubra and Achyrophorus raacu- 
latus ?
which we had gathered on a former occasion, and of each of 
which we now only met with a single plant in bud, we proceeded on 
to another locality for Asparagus officinalis and Allium Schoenoprasum.
Night, however, overtook us and we were compelled to forego our in- 
tentions and return to Landewednack, which we left about 10 o'clock 
for Helston, where we found ourselves at 12, after a pleasant drive

I need 
not say that we were highly satisfied with the result of the day's

Description of a species of Orohanche new to Great Britain, probably 
Orobanche amethystea, Thuillier.
By the Rev. W.
S. Hore, 
M.A., F.L.S.
The plants from which the following description was taken were 
collected by the Rev. C.
A. Johns, Mr. Thomas Edmondston, Jun.
and myself, in a farewell botanical excursion to Whitsand Bay, a few 
days before Edmondston's departure on the Californian expedition.
His friends will be glad to learn that he quitted England in excellent 
health and spirits, anticipating with delight an investigation into the 
botanical and zoological riches of an almost unknown country.
Orobanche amethystea, Th.
Bracts rather shorter than the corolla ; sepals bifid, with two strong 
nerves and several rather indistinct ones, ovate at the base, with the 
laciniae subulate and shorter than the tube of the corolla.
Corolla 
tubular, curved immediately from the base and subsequently straight ; 
lips unequally toothed, undulate, with branched veins ; upper lip 
hooded, emarginate, the border recurved ; lower lip three-lobed, the 
lateral ones smaller than the intermediate one ; between the lobes on 
each side is a convex process, caused by the sudden expansion of the 
substance of the corolla on leaving the tube.
Stamens inserted near 
the base of the corolla, glabrous externally, but furnished with nume- 
rous hairs internally at the base, which gradually disappear about the 
240 
middle of the filaments.
Stigma two-lobed, with the lobes divaricate.
Style nearly glabrous, furnished with only a few glandular hairs.
Cap- 
sules oblong, cylindrical.
The stem is originally whitish, assuming a purple hue as the flow- 
er expands and finally becoming reddish brown.
The tube of the 
corolla is whitish, with the lips straw-coloured, marked with purple 
veins ; the purple marlnngs extend in some cases for a short distance 
down the tube.
The bracts and sepals of a light purple.
The stigma 
purple and the stamens in unopened flowers the same, becoming brown- 
ish-black on attaining maturity.
The spike is lax, and the bracts at 
the base of the stem not numerous.
Parasitical on Daucus maritimus.
This plant is very distinct in the form of its corolla and general 
characters from Orobanche barbata, the only species growing in the 
western counties with which it may be confounded.
1 have carefully 
examined the two plants in a living state at the same time, having re- 
ceived through the kindness of Miss A.
E. Grifliths beautiful speci- 
mens of the latter from Torquay, where it grows in abundance on ivy.
Orobanche minor is a very different plant.
The description given above agrees very nearly with those by Koch 
and Reichenbach of Orobanche amethystea, Thuillier.
The chief 
difference is in the length of the sepals, which certainly do not exceed 
or even equal the corolla.
But Reichenbach and Koch are themselves 
at issue on this point, and therefore much importance is not to be at- 
tached to such a varying and indefinite character.
A slight discre- 
pancy also apparently exists in ray description of the under lip of the 
corolla and that given by Koch : he describes the intermediate lobe 
as trifid, apparently assigning an equality of value to the three divi- 
sions of which it is composed, whilst I look upon it as simple, furnish- 
ed with two convex processes : my reasons for so doing are that no 
nerves enter into these processes, whilst they are very apparent in the 
true lobes.
One other difference remains to be pointed out : it is 
that whilst Orobanche amethystea is parasitical, according to the 
above authorities, on Eryngium carapestre, the Whitsand Bay plant 
grows on Daucus maritimus.
Whether our very critical botanists 
will deem this latter point sufficient to keep the two plants distinct, I 
cannot say ; but for my part I have no hesitation in considering them 
identical, agreeing as they so thoroughly do in the curvature of the 
tube of the corolla and the characters of the pistil and stamens.

On a Monstroiiity of Carddmine pratenfiifi.
By W.
A. Bromfikld, 
M.D., F.L.S.
I FOUNt) on the 2Sth of May last, in a moory meadow by the Me- 
(liua, below Ilookley, a Solitary specimen of Cavdamine pratensis, 
affording a singular instance of abnormal development, and which, 
though possibly not very uncommon, it may yet be interesting to vege- 
table morphologists to record.
On the lower part of the corymb were 
several seed-vessels elevated on very distinct pedicels, and changed 
from their usual linear form to an ovate elliptical figure, so as to re- 
semble the short pod or siliqua of genera belonging to the first sec- 
tion of the natural order Crucifera?.
These, on being opened, were 
found to contain petals of the usual pale pink or purple colour, which 
in the pods above had burst from their confinement at the commissures 
and appeared as semi-double flowers, the valves of the pods answer- 
ing exactly by their position to the true calyx.
At the summit of the 
stem the flowers had the ordinary appearance, except that the sta- 
mens were changed into petals; and on opening the ovary of the high- 
est blossom, no ovules were discoverable amongst the mass of petaloid 
laminae with which the cavity was filled.
From their verticillate ar- 
rangement it is evident that these petaloid expansions were not trans- 
formed seeds, as I hoped to have found them, but simply a develop- 
ment of the common axis within the ovary into an abortive whorl of 
floral organs, which structure was clearly manifested by the evident 
rudiments both of stamens and pistil in the centre of the verticil.
The 
lowermost pedicellate pods had doubtless been at first surrounded by 
the regular floral envelopes ; from some cause they had not emitted 
these last at the sutures like the rest, but assumed the puzzling appear- 
ance of well-formed seed-vessels, belonging to sjaecies of a different 
section of the order.

Mr. E.

the inconstancy of what 1 assume for the present to be the same specieg

ing whether one or both might not rather be referred to CE.
Lachena- 
lii of Mr. Babington's excellent Manual, not having as yet devoted 
much attention to the subject.
Whether from something unfavourable 
in the season, or from a consciousness of demerit in passing through 
life under false names, I know not, but certain it is, that when wanted 
particularly for examination, both species contrived to make them- 
selves so exceedingly scarce, that I only fell in with a few specimens 
of what I have been in the habit of calling Qi. peucedanifolia at the 
close of the summer.
I am greatly inclined to the opinion that we 
have but one genuine species (under the above-names) in the I.
of Wight, 
and perhaps, may I not add, in the whole of Britain ?
Our common 
plant here (pimpinelloides ?), assuredly a most variable species, and 
accommodating itself to every kind of situation, from dry pasture and 
mowing lands to the wettest salt marsh, it is not to be wondered at 
if its external characters should be as multifarious as its localities are 
different.
I shall not enter at present upon any discussion of a ques- 
tion so difficult as the determination of the British species of CEnanthe, 
but as the plant which currently passes for ffi.

vouchsafed to present itself again this year in its usual abundance, I 
trust to be enabled to lay before the readers of the ' Phytologist ' the

Account of a Botanical Excursion to the Bass Rock, in July, 1844.
By William Keddie, Secretary of the Botanical Society of 
Glasgow.* 
Professor Balfour's class excursions, which have contributed so 
much during the last three summers to extend our knowledge of the 
flora of the west of Scotland, were this season diversified by a visit to 
the east coast, including the Bass Rock.
The pleasure of exploring 
a field of botanical research which was new to all the party except 
* Read before the Botanical Society of Glasgow, and communicated by Pro- 
fessor Balfour.
243 
the Professor himself, was greatly enhanced by the historical interest 
of the district which they traversed.
It is hoped that a cursory notice 
of the plants which they collected and of the places which they visited 
may not be unacceptable to the Society.
On Friday, the 12th of July, 1844, the party went by the 11 o'clock 
train to Edinburgh, where they arrived at 1, p.
m.; and having been 
joined by three gentlemen belonging to that city, making the number 
sixteen in all,* they immediately drove off in a stage coach which had 
been engaged to convey them to their destination.
The rout lay 
along the coast of the Firth of Forth for about 25 miles in a south- 
east direction.
There is little to interest the stranger in the general 
aspect of the coast, which consists chiefly of long flat reaches of sand, 
and possesses few of the features which lend beauty and variety to 
the shores of the Firth of Clyde.
The inland district, however, is 
highly cultivated, and fertile to a degree scarcely exceeded in any 
other part of Scotland ; and it was curious to observe, that this lux- 
uriant vegetation often owed its protection from the sea breeze solely to 
a stripe, of blighted shrubbery, separating the fields and gardens from 
the bleak and exposed shore.
This is particularly the case at Gosford, 
the seat of the Earl of Wemyss, where the plantation behind the walls 
is cut down by the blast in such a way as to exhibit the appearance 
of an inclined plane rising from the top of the wall.
But the absence 
of interest in the monotonous appearance of the coast was amply com- 
pensated for by the charms of historical association with which it 
abounds ; and neither the peculiar aim nor the rapidity of the journey 
could altogether exclude objects of this kind from our curiosity and re- 
gard.
The ancient town of Musselburgh and its immediate neigbour- 
hood is singularly rich in antiquities, having, from its proximity to the 
capital, been the scene of some of the most striking events of our his- 
tory.
While crossing the Esk, which divides the burgh from the sub- 
urban village of Fisherrow, we had a view of an old bridge, which is 
worth travelling as far to see on its own account, â€” " a structure " Mr.
R. Chambers mentions, " supposed to be of Roman origin, and over 
which the Highland army of Prince Charles Stuart passed on their way 
to the field of Prestonpans in 1745, and which had been crossed in like 
manner, two centuries before, in 1547, by the Scottish army on their 
march to the field of Pinkie j a structure," he adds, "over which all of 
* The party consisted of Dr. Balfour, Messrs.
Miller, Craig, Murray, MacLel- 
lau, Thomson, Risk, Sharp, Crawford, Ramsay, Stevenson, Keddic, Connal, Holden, 
Ashby and Douglas.
244 
noble or kingly birth, that had approached Edinburgh for at least a thou- 
sand years, must certainly have passed ; which has bome processions 
of monks, and marches of armies, and trains of kings; which has rattled 
under the feet of Mary's frolic steed, and thundered beneath the war- 
horse of Cromwell." Near the bridge are found Mentha sativa, 0.
rubra, and Chenopodium olidum.
At the eastern extremity of Mus- 
selburgh the road skirts the links or sand downs where the Marquis of 
Hamilton, as the commissioner of Charles I.
was met in 1638 by as- 
sembled thousands of the Covenanters, who lined the road to Edin- 
burgh during his progress ; and here also Cromwell encamped his in- 
fantry while his cavalry were quartered in the burgh in 1650.
The 
Links are famous in a botanical point of view as being a station for 
Trifolium ornithopodioides.
Pinkie House, which has been celebra- 
ted both in song and story, is beautifully situated in the same neigh- 
bourhood, within sight of the road ; and as we passed along we caught 
glimpses of the battle-field of Prestonpans, and of the house inhabited 
in 1745, by the gallant and pious Colonel Gardiner, who fell in that 
engagement.
Prestonpans, which has become celebrated in modern 
times for the ale it brews, still carries on its ancient manufacture of 
salt.
The monks of Holyrood and Newbattle, the early superiors of 
this and the adjoining parish of Tranent, were the first to establish 
salt-pans on the shore of Preston (Priestistown) village, which there- 
fore received the name it bears in ancient ecclesiastical records of 
' Salt Preston.' The manufacture, however, is now carried on, not by 
the evaporation of sea-water, but by the purifying and recrystallising 
of rock-salt imported from the neighbourhood of Liverpool.
We 
made a brief stay at the village of Aberlady, which is remarkable only 
for its spacious bay, affording sea-room for a whole fleet.
Our coun- 
trymen in these parts, at the period of the threatened invasion by 
France, considered this to be the spot which Napoleon would in all 
probability select for disembarking his troops.
Had'he done so, the 
probability is equally strong that he would not have tarried longer 
than we did in a region offering but indifferent temptations to the cu- 
pidity of an invader, whether he comes armed with the munitions of 
war, or bearing the peaceful implements of the spadix and vasculum.
About 5 o'clock we reached North Berwick, and having made the 
necessary arrangements for our accommodation for the night, set off 
by our stage coach for the Bass.
The shore here becomes rocky and 
precipitous, presenting a succession of bold cliffs, contrasting agree- 
ably with the quiet sandy bays by which they are intersected.
This 
is the trappean district of the coal-measures, and the junctions of the 
245 
trap and sandstone exhibit many curious alterations in the texture of 
both rocks.
The conical hill named North Berwick Law, which 
springs sheer from the surrounding plain to a height of about 900 feet 
above the sea-level, and is seen for many miles on both sides of the 
Firth, together with several scattered islets of the shore, appear to be- 
long to the same geological period, and consist of felspathic trajD of a 
reddish hue.
One of these islets, standing about a mile and a half 
from the shore, and to which access is obtained by a boat from Canty 
Bay, is the Bass, which is celebrated as having been the bastile of 
Scotland in the time of the Covenanters.
It presented some rare bo- 
tanical as well as historical attractions to our party, and after a long 
day's expectation of the reward that awaited them, it was perhaps ex- 
cusable to gratify their botanical ardour first, and then to indulge in 
the recollections which the place was so well fitted to awaken.
Ac- 
cordingly, no sooner had they achieved a footing in a somewhat 
difficult landing-place, and scrambled up the rocks on the only 
side of the islet where it is accessible, than they were gratified to 
find abundance of Beta maritima growing under the shade of the 
dismantled fort.
The crowning attraction, however, was within the 
walls, where the Professor introduced them to a sight which was in- 
deed a novel one to all present except himself.
This was a perfect 
forest of Lavatera arborea, the tree mallow of the Bass, a plant in- 
digenous in a very few localities in Scotland.
The rarity and profu- 
sion of this beautiful plant in a station so unpromising and inhospi- 
table, afforded the party unmingled delight â€” that kind of delight which 
only botanists feel in discovering a new or rare plant in a new station.
The rock is productive of no other plants of note, and the catalogue 
of its entire flora is very soon exhausted.
In addition to the above 
we observed Silene maritima, Cochlearia officinalis.
Lychnis diurna, 
Hieracium Pilosella, Geranium molle, Urtica dioica, Holcus lanatus, 
a glaucous var.
of Festuca ovina, Cerastium semidecandrum, Dac- 
tylis glomerata and Carduus lanceolatus.
The rock is about a mile 
in circumference, and rises 420 feet above the level of the sea.
Its 
northern face rises perpendicularly nearly to the full height of the 
rock.
On the south it slopes down gradually till near the base, pre- 
senting an outline which has been compared to that of the old-fa- 
shioned box which used to grace the side-board as a receptacle for 
knives and forks, A cavern penetrates the rock from east to west, and 
may be explored at ebb-tide.
The islet offers but one landing-place, 
which is on the south-east.
We were fortunate enough to have visit- 
ed the Bass during the period of incubation of the solan geese, which 
246 
frequent the rock in incredible numbers.
The discharge of a fowling 
piece as we sailed round the rock before landing, startled myriads of 
these and other sea-birds, which literally darkened the air as they 
took flight ; although successive repetitions of the experiment were 
less and less successful in alarming them.
The bare shelves and 
ledges of the rock were whitened on all sides, except at the landing- 
place, with birds watching their callow young or hatching their eggs ; 
and in these circumstances they allowed themselves to be approach- 
ed without evincing any symptoms of uneasiness, unless when certain 
of the more adventurous of the party poked their fingers into their 
open bills.
The solan goose, the black and white gull, the kittiwake, 
the puffin or Tammy-norrie, the falcon, the eider-duck and the cormo- 
rant, with a few other birds, divide the tenantry of the rock with about 
two dozen sheep, which yield to gourmands the celebrated Bass 
mutton.
The Bass was for many generations the property of an ancient fa- 
mily named Lauder of the Bass, but was purchased by government in 
1671, and converted into a state prison for the Covenanters under the 
reign of Charles II.
; which purpose it continued to serve till the revo- 
lution.
It held out against the new tlynasty at that period, and was 
signalised as being the last place in Great Britain which yielded to 
William III.
In 1701 the fortifications were demolished, and in 1706 
the Bass was granted by the Crown to Sir Hew Dalrymple, then Pre- 
sident of the Court of Session, in the possession of whose descendants 
it has hitherto continued.
The fort and the prison-house are now un- 
roofed.
An old chapel is alone distinguishable by the niches for the 
fonts, which would appear to assign it an origin prior to the reforma- 
tion.
The early history of the place is buried in obscurity, but it has 
acquired an interest from its associations with the martyr-memories of 
the Covenanters, which none who revere their characters and princi- 
ples " would willingly let die." It is surely no unfit application of 
Dr. Johnson's well-known sentiment on visiting lona, to say, that the 
man is little to be envied whose piety, and whose patriotism too, would 
not grow warmer amidst the ruins of the Bass.
On regaining the shore, we directed our steps during a beautiful 
sunset towards Tantallan Castle, gathering on the way specimens of 
Scabiosa Columbaria.
This magnificent and venerable ruin covers a 
bluff'headland about three miles from North Berwick, and overlooks the 
German Ocean, by which it is surrounded on three sides, the fourth 
having been protected by a double ditch and powerful out-works.
The external structure is nearly entire, the walls being of prodigious 
247 
thickness.
Tantallan was a stronghold of the Donglas family.
Over 
the entrance there still remains, though nearly obliterated, the sculp- 
tured blazon of the bloody heart, the well-known emblem of that 
powerful and haughty family.
The situation and strength of this fort- 
alice long set at defiance every attempt at its reduction, and gave rise 
to the popular belief that it was impregnable and indestructible.
"Ding 
down Tantallan !
â€” mak a brig to the Bass !" became a proverb ex- 
pressive of the belief that the one project was as impracticable as the 
other.
The barony of North Berwick and the castle of Tantallan 
were forfeited by the earl of Douglas in 1455, and were given by James 
III.
to the fifth earl of Angus, known in history as " Archibald Bell- 
the-cat;" and whose earnest but ill-requited remonstrance with James 
IV.
on the eve of the battle of Flodden, against the war with England, 
and his consequent retirement to Tantallan, have been celebrated by 
Sir Walter Scott in Marmion.
When the succeeding earl of Angus 
had incurred the displeasure of James V,, he shut himself up in this 
castle, which held out against a siege conducted by the monarch in 
person.
The king " borrowed " says Sir Walter " from the castle of 
Dunbar, then belonging to the Duke of Albany, two great cannons, 
whose names, as Pitscottie informs us with laudable minuteness, were 
' Thrawn-mouth'd Meg and her Marrow ;' also * two great botcards, 
and two moyan, two double falcons, and four quarter falcons,' for the 
safe guiding and redelivery of which, three lords were laid in pawn at 
Dunbar !" King James, notwithstanding these means and appliances, 
was obliged to raise the siege, and only got possession of the place 
afterwards by treaty with the governor.
It is foreign to the present 
purpose to trace the history of this remarkable seat of feudal power.
Amidst its varying fortunes it continued to maintain its reputation as 
a place of strength, and set at defiance the military art of the times, 
till it was " dung down " by the Covenanters in the reign of Charles I., 
its lord at that time, the Marquis of Douglas, having identified himself 
with the royal cause.
Sir Walter Scott describes the castle with cha- 
racteristic minuteness and vivacity : â€” 
" But scant three miles the band had rode, 
When o'er a height they passed, 
And sudden, close before them show'd 
His lowers, Tantallan vast.
Broad, massive, high and stretching far.
And held impregnable in war.
On a projecting rock they rose 
And round three sides the ocean flows, 
248 
The fourth did battled walls inclose, 
And douhle mound and fosse.
By narrow draw-bridge, out-works strong.
Through studded gates an entrance long, 
To the main court they cross.
It was a wide and stately square ;â€” 
Around were lodgings, fit and fair^ 
Aiid towers of various form, 
Which in the court projected far, 
And broke its lines quadrangular.
Here was square keep, there turret high, 
Or pinnacle that sought the sky, 
Whence oft the warder could dfescry 
The gathering ocean storm." 
In the spacious court of the castle Conium maculatum grows rank 
amongst the ruins.
We gathered also Lepidium latifolium on the edge 
of the cliff, and were fortunate in discovering a quantity of Hyoscy- 
amus niger in fine condition, occupying, with its drooping lurid flow- 
ers and foetid odour, an appropriate place in an obscure corner of the 
castle.
Sambucus nigra grows here in wild profusion, as indeed it does 
along the whole coast.
Carduus acanthoides and marianus were also 
found.
We left Tantallan with reluctance, while the evening sun was 
pouring a stream of golden light into its silent court and deserted halls, 
and had instinctively turned, ere we leaped across the moat, to take a lin- 
gering look at the venerable pile, when our reveries were broken by the 
last of the party rushing from the entrance in a fine fit of poetical 
frenzy, and shouting after us the parting words of Angus to Marmion : 
" And hop'st thou hence unscathed to go ?
No, by Saint Bryde of Bothwell, no !
Up draw-bridge, grooms !
â€” what, warder, ho !
Let the portcullis fall !'' 
By this time the Professor, with a considerate regard for the condi- 
tion of his " followers," who had been fasting all day, was in full cry 
upon a bank of mushrooms (Agaricus campestris and Georgii) in an 
adjoining meadow, which were carefully deposited in his vasculum to 
give an additional relish to a repast intended to do for the threefold 
duty of dinner, tea and supper.
As we retraced our steps to North 
Berwick, we picked Triticum junceum and Briza media near the 
shore ; and in the fields and by the way-side Lithospermum arvense, 
Scandix pecten, Anthriscus vulgaris.
Lychnis vespertina shedding its 
tiehest odors to a beautiful Scottish ' gloarain,' Lychnis Githago^ and 
249 
Serrafalcus commutatus ; and thus occupied we proceeded on our way 
till we reached the inn in the twilight.
At an early hour next morning we left North Berwick on foot, to 
botanize along the coast on our return, and were successful in meeting 
with a number of plants which w^ere new to most of the party, and se- 
veral of them peculiar to that part of the county.
On the sandy shore 
near North Berwick, and as we proceeded along the extensive sand- 
downs stretching to a considerable distance inward from the shore, 
we gathered Astragalus hypoglottis, Thalictrum minus, Equisetum 
variegatum, Habenaria viridis, and Eryngium maritimum.
Amongst 
the numerous sandy knolls which hav^e been thrown up in the interior, 
we found abundance of Ammophila arenaria and Carex arenaria, the 
long creeping stems and roots of both of which plants serve the useful 
purpose of preventing the sand from drifting further inland upon the 
cultivated fields.
Cynoglossum officinale was also found growing 
profusely on these knolls, and occurred in other parts of our morning 
walk.
In the same neighbourhood we picked Tragopogon minor ; 
and in marshy spots on the common, Veronica Anagallis and Helos- 
ciadium repens.
On Dirleton Common, after a good deal of search- 
ing, we found Acinos vulgaris and Silene conica in small quantities, 
the station having evidently suflered from the depredations of previous 
botanical visiters, equally entitled with ourselves, there is reason to 
believe, to the designation of Radicals.
From the common we ram- 
bled into the adjoining fields, which presented us with a favourable 
example of the cultivation and fertility for which the county of Had- 
dington is celebrated.
Here we gathered Reseda lutea, Papaver Ar- 
gemone, dubium and Rhoeas, the two latter growing in great abun- 
dance, â€” a characteristic of the eastern district of the county.
When 
these species occur near Glasgow, they appear to be chiefly in fields, 
sown perhaps with grain brought from the east.
We picked also Si- 
lene inflata and noctiflora, Galium Mollugo, Trifolium arvense, Anagal- 
lis arvensis, Fumaria capreolata, officinalis and raicrantha.
Alyssum 
calycinum also grows in small quantities on the common.
The ram- 
ble fi-om North Berwick to Dirleton by this circuitous route, occupied 
about four hours, and as the weather was most agreeable, and our suc- 
cess had fully equalled our expectation, we arrived at Dirleton in 
high spirits, with full vasculums and empty stomachs, and a keen 
relish for breakfast, which we afterwards flattered ourselves must have 
made the statistics of that repast somewhat memorable to the hostess 
of Dirleton Inn. And Dirleton, we all confessed, when we had time 
to draw breath, to be the most perfectly beautiful village we had ever 
Vol. II.
2 i 
250 
seen, perhaps all the more beautiful from the Englisli rather than the 
Scottish taste displayed in its arrangement.
In laying it out, every 
advantage has been taken of a choice situation.
The cottages, which 
are screened by trees, and wreathed with climbing plants, are ranged 
along two sides of a green, representing the English common on a 
small scale, with its appropriate flock of geese.
Even the sign-board 
of the village shoe-maker peeped out upon the green through the 
branches of a Fuchsia radiant with a blaze of drooping blossoms.
Everywhere there is an air of tidiness and taste, of comfort and quiet- 
ness about the place, alike novel and refreshing, and which justly en- 
titles Dirleton, to be regarded, like Goldsmith's Auburn, as the " love- 
liest village of the plain." Mr. Chambers remarks that " altogether 
Dirleton may be termed one of the prettiest, â€” if not actually the 
prettiest, â€” village in Scotland." On the south side of the green, 
stands the ancient ruin of Dirleton Castle covered with ivy and em- 
bosomed among trees, and commanding a magnificent view of the sea 
coast on one side, and the luxuriant plains of the interior on the other.
The garden in which it is situated is surrounded by a modern wall, 
"built" the above-mentioned writer says, "in the style of a barbican 
with turrets ;" and nearly the whole of the improvements in its vici- 
nity have been effected in the very best taste.
The general style of 
the cottages in the neighbourhood preserves a corresponding antique 
character.
The proprietors of the estate are Mr. and Mrs. Ferguson, 
of Raith, the latter possessing the right by descent ; and they gene- 
rously afford free access to the garden and castle.
We availed our- 
selves of this privilege, and found the garden under excellent manage- 
ment.
The arrangement of the grounds has been conducted with the 
exquisite discrimination and skill displayed in all the improvements 
effected by the proprietors.
The mildness of the climate is favourable 
to the growth of many of the more delicate exotics, of which we saw 
a rich variety in the open air, including numerous fine annuals.
Amongst the ruins of the castle we picked Parietaria officinalis, re- 
markable for the elasticity of its stamens, Cheiranthus cheiri, Smyr- 
nium Olusatrum and Vicia hirsuta ; also Sedum reflexum and album, 
Corydalis lutea and Linaria Cymbalaria, which wei'e, however, evi- 
dently escapes from the garden.
Dirleton Castle is of high antiquity, 
and has been associated with the fortunes of several families, occupy- 
ing a prominent place in our early history.
It was dismantled by the 
Parliamentary army in 1650.
Possession of the castle in its better 
days was held out, and not unsuccessfully, to the Earl of Ruthven, as 
an inducement to join the Gowrie conspiracy.
His written corre- 
251 
spondeiice with Logan of Restalrig on this subject, not only shows 
his desire to become the possessor of such an eligible property, but 
the terms in which he expresses himself imply that the district of 
country in which it is situated was even at that early period enriched 
by cultivation.
" I cair nocht" says he " for all the land I hae in this 
kingdume, in case I get a grip of Dirleton, for I esteme it the pleasant- 
est dwelling in Scotland." 
We now took our departure from 'pleasant' Dirleton, and made for 
the neighbouring woods of Archerfield.
In the ditches on our way 
we observed Veronica Anagallis growing to the unusual height of four 
feet or more, and interspersed with Nasturtium officinale, also very 
large.
In the wooded grounds we picked Rumex sanguineus, Listera 
ovata, Epipactis latifolia, Epilobium hirsutum, and observed Nuphar 
lutea growing in the pond and adjoining stream.
Emerging upon the 
public road, we picked Pyrethrum Partheniura growing in a hedge.
Along the road-sides between Archerfield and Gullan we found Con- 
volvulus arvensis, Knautia arvensis, Centaurea Scabiosaand Anthemis 
Cotula.
At Gullan, a village which has acquired some celebrity for 
the training of race-horses on its ample sand-downs, we continued 
to pursue our own pleasant and innocent sport ;* and here again we 
met with Hyoscyamus niger, also Geranium pusillum, and rarer still, 
by the margin of a small pond near the village, we picked Limosella 
aquatica.
It being now about mid-day, several of the party, who con- 
templated returning to Glasgow that evening, were under the necessity 
of reluctantly separating from the main body, who continued to ex- 
plore the coast during a leisurely walk towards Edinburgh.
Three of 
our number who had risen with the morning sun to ascend North 
Berwick Law, had been informed by the fishermen, that the peculiar 
ruddy light portended a rainy day.
We had little apprehension of 
the fulfilment of this prediction as we scoured the links between North 
Berwick and Dirleton during the bright sunshine of a delightful morn- 
ing ; but as the day advanced it brought unpleasant symptoms of the 
soundness of the old fishermen's conclusions.
Latterly it rained in 
torrents, but botanists wear a charmed life.
A slight degree of dis- 
comfort was the only inconvenience the party sustained from their 
drenching, which conld not damp the ardour of their pursuit, as the 
remainder of the list of plants collected will testify.
On Gullan Links 
we gathered Cerastium arvense, Erylhraea linarifolia, Thrincia hirta, 
Echium vulgare and Anagallis tenella, a plant which abounds in the 
* Wordsworth says of liotauists, " there is no poison in their sport.'

west but is by no means common on the east coast.
In Gullan loch 
and its vicinity Sium angustifolium, Helosciadium repens, Ulricularia 
vulgaris, Poa aquatica, Hippuris vulgaris, Scirpus lacustris, Potamo- 
geton densus, Carex intermedia, teretiuscula and fulva.
In the fields 
near Luffness, Campanula hybrida, Silene noctiflora.
At Luffness 
Burn, Carex paludosa.
On the neighbouring shore, Salicornia her- 
bacea, Schoberia maritiraa and Zostera marina.
Between Luffness and 
Aberlady, Trifolium fi-agiferum, Blysmus rufus, Rottbollia incurvata, 
ft.Jiliformis, Carex distans, Carduus tenuiflorus and Malva rotundi- 
folia.
Near Aberlady, Hippophae rharanoides.
At Gosford, Gera- 
nium sanguineum, Gentiana campestris and Amarella.
Near Cocken- 
zie, Pulicaria dysenterica, Ononis arvensis, Carduus nutans, Rosa 
spinosissima, rubiginosa, canina and tomentosa.

June 1845.
Memoir of the late Mr. Griffith (from the ^Transactions of the Royal 
Asiatic Society'' for JiDie, 1845^*.
Mr. Griffith was one of the most accomplished botanists of our 
day ; with the most accurate and extensive acquisition of learning in 
his department, he combined such a spirit of activity and enterprise 
as has been rarely equalled, great talents, and a very remarkable power 
of labour, arrangement, and application.
He was born in the year 
1810, and was educated at the London University.
He went out to 
India, as an assistant-surgeon on the Madras Establishment, where he 
arrived on the 24th September 1832, and was shortly afterwards select- 
ed by the Bengal Government to examine the Botany of the Tenas- 
serim Provinces.
He was, in 1835, deputed to Assam, with Dr. M' 
Clelland, for the purpose of assisting Dr. Wallich in his inspection of 
the growth of the tea plant in Assam, and proceeded from thence, in 
company with Dr. Bayfield, to the then unexplored tracts which lie 
between Suddiya and Ava, upon the extreme frontier of our Eastern 
territory.
In 1837 he accompanied Captain Pemberton on his mission 
to the wild countries of Boutan, and two years after was sent, with 
the army of Indus, to prosecute inquiries into the Botany of Affghani- 
stan.
In 1841 he was appointed to the medical duties of Malacca.
Upon Dr. Wallich's absence, owing to illness, at the Cape, Mr. Grif- 
fith was intrusted with the superintendence of the Botanical Garden 
at Calcutta, and with the duties of Botanical Professor in the Medical 
253 
College ; but having, on the return of Dr. Wallich from the Cape, re- 
sumed his place at Malacca, he was there seized with disease of the 
liver, and died at the early age of thirty-four, having already acquired 
a distinguished reputation, â€” having, in every capacity wherein he serv- 
ed the government, received its approbation and its thanks ; and 
having given a promise of such further services to botanical science 
as few have had either the opportunity or the talent of aflfording.
In 
all his varied and extensive journeys his courage and his energy never 
failed him; whether in the jungles of Assam, or the hills of Affghani- 
stan, he still pursued his researches, undeterred by danger, either of 
disease or of violence ; and if disabled, as he was more than once by 
fever and debility, his first convalescence found him ever ready for 
fresh exertions.
He had thus, by the application of extraordinary 
powers of observation, and in researches extending through the vast 
regions which have been enumerated, formed large and valuable col- 
lections, and brought together materials for a great botanical work ; 
and he looked with impatience to a period of repose for compiling a 
scientific Flora of India, when he sunk under his last fatal illness.
Perhaps no more impressive picture of the energy of this extraordinary 
man, and of his devotion to his favourite science, can be given than 
that which may be drawn from the following extracts from a letter 
dictated by him on his death-bed, and addressed to Dr. M'Clelland : â€” 
" I write this by deputy, being seriously ill of hepatitis ; the attack 
has been very severe, and the treatment necessarily active, so that I 
am reduced to an extreme state of weakness.
Although my adviser 
does not despair, still the issue is doubtful, and under this impression 
I commence a few lines to you on business.
" Mrs. Griffith (supposing the result of this illness to be fatal to me) 
will bring up with her all the collections at Malacca, and they being 
added to those at the export warehouse, and all having been previous- 
ly cleaned and packed, I leave you to present to Government, for the 
Honourable Court of Directors, to be sent home without any delay.
As you know the trouble I have taken with these collections, and the 
hopes I had entertained of making them subservient to a general sci- 
entific Flora of India, I need not impress on you how much I am 
interested in their proper disposal, and their being brought properly 
before the scientific public ; and I would say the same regarding my 
drawings and manuscripts, which will accompany my wife to Calcutta, 
should it so happen that I leave her.
" In all the plans which I have consigned to your execution, both 
regarding my wife and collections, I am confident your own feelings 
254 
will prompt you to every exertion on my account.
Asking God's 
blessing on you and your wife, I bid you good bye." 
" Thus far," continues Dr. Moorhead, his medical attendant, " was 
written at Mr. Griffith's dictation ; but I grieve to say the fatal result 
came to pass yesterday evening, Sunday, 9th February, at half-past 
seven o'clock." 
Memoranda on the above by Dr. McClelland.
â€” "To the above 
details, furnished by Dr. Moorhead, I may add that Mr. Griffith's con- 
stitution for the last two or three years seemed greatly shattered, his 
energies alone remaining unchanged.
Exposure during his former 
journeys and travels laid the seeds of a fatal malady in his constitution, 
while his anxiety about his pursuits and his zeal increased ; he be- 
came care-worn and haggard in his looks, often complaining of ano- 
malous symptoms marked by an extreme rapidity of pulse, in conse- 
quence of which he had left off wine for some years, and was obliged 
to observe great care and attention in his diet.
In Affghanistan he was 
very nearly carried off by fever, to which he had been subject on his 
former travels in Assam.
No government ever had a more devoted or 
zealous servant, and I impute much of the evil consequences to his 
health, to his attempting more than the means at his disposal enabled 
him to accomplish with justice to himself." 
Although Mr. Griffith's researches were directed primarily to Botany, 
he neglected no opportunity, during his visits to various parts of India, 
of attending also to other departments of Natural History.
Of his 
zeal and success in Zoology, his collections afford abundant proof; 
they consist chiefly of Mammalia, birds, fishes, and insects.
While 
attached to the army of the Indus, he made, on account of Govern- 
ment, large collections of Mammalia and birds, which have been trans- 
mitted to the Honourable Court of Directors, and constitute a valua- 
ble addition to the museum at the India House.
In Mammology he 
collected a considerable number of the smaller animals of Affghanistan, 
among which are several new to science ; but his ornithological col- 
lections are still more extensive, having brought together about six 
hundred specimens, not only from the route of the army, but from se- 
veral separate excursions to the ranges of mountains north of Cabul.
Besides the discovery of a considerable number of new species, the 
interest of these collections consists in their affording, perhaps, the 
most extensive and instructive illustration of the geographical distri- 
bution of the several species of birds found in India, which has as yet 
been attempted.
Mr. Griffith has also been zealous and successful as a collector of 
255 
the fresh-water fishes of India, daring his various travels : the impor- 
tance and extent of these is detailed in a paper on the subject, printed 
in the second volume of the ' Calcutta Journal of Natural History ' ; 
and some of his discoveries in Entomology have been communicated 
to the public by the Rev, F.
W. Hope, in the eighteenth volume of 
the 'Transactions of the Linnean Society of London.' 
He was most especially remarkable for the philosophical spirit in 
which he invariably prosecuted his researches, and for the patience 
with which he watched the most minute phenomenon which appeared 
to him connected with the subjects of investigation.
Some of his 
published papers, especially those on Vegetable Impregnation, and 
the Progressive Development of Organs, have never been excelled, 
and rarely equalled.
The merits of this accomplished naturalist and devoted labourer in 
the field of scientific discovery, were appreciated and fostered by the 
noble President of this Society while at the head of the Government 
of India, and it is to his Lordship's kindness that the Society are in- 
debted for some of the most interesting parts of the foregoing com- 
munication.
His loss was also recently noticed in terms of deep re- 
gret by the present Governor-General, Sir Henry Hardinge, in His 
Excellency's Address at the annual distribution of honours and prizes 
at the Bengal Medical College.
As it is understood that the whole of the valuable materials prepa- 
red and collected by Mr. Griffith, are consigned to the Directors of 
the East India Company, the most confident hopes may be cherished 
that the expectations of the scientific world will not be disappointed 
of the full benefit which they are calculated, and were intended by 
him, to confer on botanical and zoological knowledge ; and that the 
irreparable loss entailed on his widow by his early death, and the sud- 
den extinction of all those hopes of fortune, honour and reward which 
his extensive know^lege and indomitable energy were so well calcula- 
ted to raise, will meet with such alleviation as, to the enlightened 
liberality of the Honourable Court, the great value of his labours, and 
the forlorn and ill-provided state of his widow and family, may be 
considered to merit.*

Account of a Botanical Excursion to Ailsa Cray, in July, 1844.
By 
J. H.
Balfour, M.D., F.L.S., Regius Professor of Botany in 
the University of Glasgow.* 
' At a previous meeting of the Society, Mr. Keddie gave an account 
of a botanical trip to the Bass Rock, that remarkable trap island which 
lies on the east coast of Scotland, and by way of contrast 1 now pro- 
pose to give a short notice of an excursion made about a fortnight 
afterwards to Ailsa Crag, an equally, or perhaps still more remarkable 
island on the west coast.
Our party, consisting of myself and seven pupils, viz.
: Messrs.
F. 
and O.
G. Adamson, Caldwell, Craig, Risk, Stevenson and Connal, 
left Glasgow on Friday, 21st July, 1844, by an afternoon railway train 
for Ayr, where we went on board the Stranraer steamboat.
The wea- 
ther was propitious, and we had a fine view of the Ayrshire coast as 
we skirted along.
Greenan Castle, the Heads of Ayr, Dunure Castle 
and Culzean Castle were among the objects of interest which we no- 
ticed.
We reached the rocks called the Maidens in the evening, 
having previously arranged that a boat should be in readiness to take 
us ashore.
The landing here is by no means easy in rough weather, 
and even when calm, the shallowness of the water on the sandy beach 
prevents a boat of large size from landing its passengers comfortably.
Having secured quarters at Kirkoswald, we proceeded along the shore 
to Culzean Castle.
On the way we picked Atriplex laciniata and ro- 
sea, Salsola Kali, Polygonum Raii, Convolvulus Soldanella, Mentha 
sativa, /3, rubra, Agrimonia Eupatoria, Habenaria viridis, Eryngium 
maritimum, Ribes nigrum, Carex arenaria, Ammophila arenaria, Pyre- 
thrum inodorum, &.
maritimum, Zostera marina and several sea-shore 
plants.
Leaving the shore, we proceeded to the woods of Culzean, 
where Epipactis latifolia, Campanula latifolia, both blue and white, 
Epilobium angustifolium, Listera ovata and Symphytum officinale 
were gathered.
A visit was paid to the pond, which is frequented by 
a great number of interesting species of water-fowl, and we afterwards 
directed our steps towards the castle.
Culzean Castle was founded 
by David, late earl of Cassilis, in the year 1777.
It stands on a rock 
which rises perpendicularly out of the sea to the height of 100 feet.
It is interesting both as regards its architecture and the splendid view 
which it commands of the Frith of Clyde and of Ailsa Crag.
On the 
fort at the castle there is a cannon marked as being of the time of 
Charles I.
There are several remarkable caves in the rock, some of

them extending nearly 200 feet.
The gardens, which have been form- 
ed in a terraced manner out of the rock, produce many rare and showy 
plants.
The nature of the climate allows some delicate plants to 
thrive well.
The woods in the neighbourhood are beautiful and pic- 
turesque, and extend over several hundred acres of ground.
After a complete examination of the castle and grounds, we proceeded 
to our evening quarters at Kirkoswald.
The inn, kept by a person of 
the name of Campbell, was by no means capacious, and we had to 
adopt various contrivances with the view of getting beds, and with all 
our efforts, I fear that several of our party slept very little.
The inn- 
keeper and his wife, however, did all in their power to promote our 
comfort.
Saturday, 27th July, 1844.
â€” Rose at half-past 2 this morning, and 
after arranging the provisions which we were to take with us, we pro- 
ceeded to the Maidens, and between 3 and 4 o'clock set sail in two 
boats for Ailsa Crag.
There was a light breeze when we started, and 
by means of sails we were enabled to make way.
The breeze, how- 
ever, not being in our favour, we were forced to make towards Arran 
with the view of afterwards running down on Ailsa.
But ere long 
the wind fell, and there was a complete calm, so that we were com- 
pelled to have recourse to oars.
The day was beautiful and the sea 
was like a lake, and all we wanted to make us enjoy our sail was 
some means of propelling the boats rapidly through the water.
Each 
took his turn at the oars, but in spite of our exertions we did not 
reach the rock till 11 o'clock.
The distance of Ailsa from the Mai- 
dens in a direct line is about fifteen miles, but by our tacking we in- 
creased the distance much.
The nearest point where a boat might 
be procured is Girvan.
We landed on the eastern side of the rock, 
which is the only part accessible to boats.
The shore here consists 
of rolled pebbles, which have been thrown up by the waves of the sea.
Near the landing-place there is a house for the use of the tacksman 
of the island, who accompanied us, and who showed us every atten- 
tion.
At this habitation we got breakfast prepared, and we sat down 
in the open air to a rude but most acceptable repast.
The day was 
remarkably fine, and we were enabled to make a complete survey of 
the Crag.
Ailsa, although one of the most interesting objects in the Frith of 
Clyde, is not often visited by tourists.
Its distance from the shore and 
the want of any regular means of conveyance have contributed in no 
small degree to prevent strangers from viewing the grand and majestic 
scenery of the island.
The rock rises suddenly from the sea to the 
259 
height of nearly 1100 feet.
It assumes a conoidal form, and is said 
to be upwards of 3000 feet in length and 2000 in breadth.
In our examination of the Crag we first proceeded along the loose 
shingles of the shores towards the point where we meant to ascend.
There is only one side on which the ascent can be made, all the others 
being bounded by perpendicular cliffs.
The ascent is by no means 
easy, owing to the loose rocks and stones which are scattered over 
the sides of the island.
The rocks are easily detached, and on this 
account great caution is required in passing over them.
A boy, it ap- 
pears, was killed in the spring by the fall of some of these loose masses 
of rock.
After reaching a height of about 200 feet, we came to the 
ruins of an old square tower, with some arched chambers, which are 
still entire.
The history of this tower does not seem to be known.
The vegetation of the island we found to be of a remarkably lux- 
uriant nature, but to be very limited as regards species.
The plants 
which form the herbage of the Crag near the tower, are Lychnis diur- 
na, both pink and white, Silene maritima, Teucrium Scorodonia, Ru- 
mex acetosa and Acetosella, and Senecio Jacobaea.
The two first- 
mentioned species attained a remarkable size, and with their showy 
pink and white blossoms added much to the beauty of the vegetation.
On some of the rocks Cotyledon Umbilicus grew in great luxuriance, 
attaining a height of nearly two feet, with its leaves large in proportion.
Macculloch probably mistook this for Hydrocotyle vulgaris, which 
was not seen to attain the large size mentioned by him.
There are 
some springs of water on this side of the crag, and in marshy spots 
we found Scirpus setaceus forming a complete turf.
There are nume- 
rous rabbits and a few goats and sheep on the island.
On reaching the summit of the rock we had an extensive view of the 
surrounding coasts, and were amply repaid for our toil in ascend- 
ing.
After examining the upper part of the Crag and admiring the 
scenery, we descended to the shore again, and then proceeded by the 
bottom of the cliffs to the southern part, and as the tide was low, we 
were enabled to make a complete circuit of the Crag.
The shore is a 
very narrow belt, covered with debris of fallen rocks, and ending ab- 
ruptly in very deep water.
The cliffs are on a grand scale, and ex- 
tend from the south round by the west and towards the north side.
In most instances they assume a columnar form.
A good representa- 
tion is given of them in Macculloch's ' Description of the Western 
Islands of Scotland.' The precipices rise to the height of 400 or 500 
feet, and the columns are stated by Macculloch to be 400 feet in 
height in many places, thus far exceeding the columns of Staffa, which 
260 
are only 60 feet high.
They want, however, the regularity and the 
defined forms which the rocks at StafFa present ; but they have less 
of the dark and gloomy aspect of the latter.
They are covered with 
innumerable tribes of birds, especially gannets or solan geese, gulls, 
cormorants, auks and puffins.
The firing of a gun caused the air to 
be darkened by the birds.
The young geese are prized by some as 
an article of diet, and a rent is paid for them.
They require to be 
cooked in a particular manner in order to render them at all palatable.
The tacksman of the island employs people to capture the young 
birds, and there is no small risk incurred in doing so.
We saw some 
men engaged in taking the birds on a narrow ledge of rocks, which 
they had reached by being let down by ropes from the summit.
Every 
now and then the rocks crumble and give way, so as to add much 
to the danger of this perilous undertaking.
The rocks of the island consist of a porphyritic sienite, which is 
sometimes amorphous and sometimes columnar.
The basis is felspar, 
with small grains of quartz and sometimes hornblende interspersed.
We observed numerous trap veins traversing the rocks, and occasionally 
fine caves are formed.
One of these caves occurs towards the north- 
ern part : it is about twelve feet wide, between twenty and thirty feet 
in height and extends about fifty feet.
Asplenium marinum lined its 
walls, and near its entrance magnificent specimens of Cochlearia offi- 
cinalis were picked, with the leaves 4^ inches in diameter.
The lux- 
uriance of this and the other plants in the island may depend in pai't 
on the dung of the sea-fowl, which serves as excellent manure when 
applied in moderate quantity.
At the foot of some of the cliffs there 
is a large accumulation of black mould, mixed with the dung of sea- 
fowl and the remains of niunerous birds that have fallen from the cliffs.
The ammoniacal odour arising from these sources under the influence 
of the sun's rays, was very powerful.
The wet nature of the climate 
prevents the guano from accumulating in large quantity so as to ren- 
der it an object of importance.
Some of the soil was analysed by Dr.
R. D.
Thomson, and was found to contain a notable quantity of am- 
monia.
Where the guano existed in the greatest quantity there was 
scarcely any vegetation, and it was only where the manure was spar- 
ingly applied that the plants assumed the luxuriance which I have 
described.
On the rocks in the south of the island we picked Lavatera arborea 
and Sagina maritima.
The former of these plants occupies many in- 
accessible ledges on the cliffs, and it is curious to remark that it is 
found both on the Bass rock and on Ailsa.
Raphanus maritimus was 
261 
also seen on the cliffs, as well as Angelica sylveslris and Erodium 
cicutarium.
The rocks on the shore are covered with masses of sea- 
weeds, and we noticed all the more common species in profusion.
Towards evening a brisk breeze sprung up, and we left the island 
at 6 o'clock, p.
M., with all our sails set, and reached the Maidens in 
two hours, not, however, without some of the party suffering all the 
horrors of sea-sickness.
From Kirkoswald we walked to Maybole, 
where we took up our quarters for the evening.
The only plant of in- 
terest which we noticed was Rumex alpinus.
On our way we passed 
some antiquarian remains, among which may be noticed the Abbey 
of Crossraguel, situated about two miles from the village of Kirkoswald.
It was founded by Duncan, king of Scotland, in 1260, and is said to 
be more perfect than any abbey in the west of Scotland.
The side 
walls of the church and choir still remain to the height of fourteen 
feet.
The niche for the altar, the vestry, the abbot's ecclesiastical 
court and house are all visible.
In Maybole parish there are several chalybeate springs, and there 
are some excellent wells.
From the sloping grounds on which the 
town is built, and which consist of strata of red sandstone, spiings of 
the purest water gush out in abundance and contribute to the health 
and well-being of the inhabitants.
We visited one which is called 
Well Trees Spout.
It is situated at the base of the declivity on which 
the town is built, and is overhung by some old trees.
The stream 
which flows is sufficient to drive the wheel of a mill, and the spring- 
is said to discharge not less than 10,000 imperial gallons per hour.
On Monday the 29th we returned to Glasgow by Ayr, after having 
enjoyed a most delightful botanical trip.
Although there were few 
rare plants collected, yet we had the pleasure of visiting a previously 
unexplored island and of ascertaining with tolerable accuracy its floral 
productions.

collected represent 33 natural orders, and amount to 79 species and 
one variety.
The list of cryptogaraic plants is by no means complete, 
partly from the short time allowed for the examination of the island 
and partly on account of many of the mosses and lichens not being in 
fructification.
There were observed 7 species of ferns, 14 mosses, 
4 Hepaticae, 19 lichens and 14 sea- weeds, making in all 68 crypto- 
gamic species.
It will be remarked that the ferns are in the propor- 
tion of 1 to about every 11 of the flowering plants ; and taking phane- 
rogamous plants and ferns together, the latter will form nearly l-12th 
of the species.

Cursory Thoughts on the Philosophy of Botany.
By Edwin Lees, 
Esq., F.L.S., &c.
1 HAVE frequently had to complain, either orally or in writing, of the 
contempt cast upon the "mere botanist," â€” a favourite term used by 
professed philosophical writers, as if there was something paltry and 
senseless in the pursuit of Botany itself, technically considered ; â€” 
something so very mechanical, that thought was never called forth 
by it, reflection never aroused, or truth sought for or arrived at.
Such ideal degradation of labourers in other walks than their own, 
if not excusable, may be accounted for ; but surely the unkind asper- 
sion should not come from the practical botanist to his own brethren.
Mr. H.
C. Watson, has, in some of his late papers, however, rather 
unnecessarily fallen foul upon the humble yet perhaps not altogether 
inutile tribe of plant-collectors, who, as observers and recorders of "un- 
considered trifles," are denominated hair-splitters, and species-splitting 
monomaniacs.* This seems rather unqualified language to apply to 
poor wandering simplers after rifling their stores !
As Mr. Watson's 
name is so deservedly honoured among British botanists, I presume 
he has a license, like the heroes of old, to brandish his battle-axe on 
all sides without let or hindrance, though almost as much to the ter- 
ror of friend as foe ; but in his last flourish it has so nearly fallen 
upon my own toes, that if no one else calls out, I must.

" What are we to say," observes Mr. Watson " about the frivolous 
attempts at species-maliing among the Rubi and Polygona in vogue 
at present, as among the Rosse and Menthae in former years ?
"* I 
adduce this sentence, though the last on the record, as rather coming 
home to myself from having laboured at what Mr. Watson thus by 
implication condemns, and object entirely to the spirit in which it is 
written.
Why should it be esteemed more frivolous to attempt unra- 
velling the intricate forms of the Rubi, than to sovir primrose-seeds and 
make varieties of their produce } If Mr. Watson will really allow 
thought on the subject, by others as well as by himself, then I should 
be disposed to say, that not only were the observers of Roses in times 
past doing good service to Botany, but that the observers and de- 
scribers of Rubi and Polygona, as well as the experimenters on the 
permanent charactei's of species in any family, are doing so now.f 
Mr. Watson's remarks tend to repress observation except in his own 
way ; but surely knowledge is only to be obtained correctly by unre- 
stricted observation on all sides.
But why this objection to " species-making," â€” or rather the obser- 
vation of minute differences in plants .'' If this minute attention be 
not given, do not the greatest mistakes arise ?
If, then, an individual 
plant differing from another in some particular point is not to be noted, 
why attend to species at all, or attempt to set bounds to them ?
Bet- 
ter at once say with Thomson, as we contemplate the flowery meadow 
and its grasses, " beyond the power of botanist to number " up their 
forms.
But if Mr. Watson admits the discovery or designation of 
species to be advantageous, then why decry that attentive examination 
of them which every tyro in Botany has been taught it is important to 
attend to ?
But here we come to the opprohrium hotanicum â€” the 
definition of species so carefully constituted as to form what Mr. Wat- 
* Phytol.

f I wish botanical writers would exercise a little more candour and forbearance as 
well as due appreciation towards their compeers and fellow-labourers than is usually 
the case, and not at all events attribute any depreciating motive as influencing their 
labours â€” if they can help it.
Yet alas !
somebody or other has always to complain on 
this score.
Sir James Smith murmured at Dr. Hooker's making nought of all his ef- 
forts on the willows, and the latter possibly thinks he may have been slighted in his 
turn.
Dr. Lindley warmly reproached the friends of Sir J.
E. Smith with not allow- 
ing him to participate in the spoils of the Rubi, as he says they " determined to keep 
the game in their own hands ;" yet he himself with equal injustice denounced the 
school of Linnaeus as an " incubus upon science," and as leading to no one useful pur- 
pose.
Now Mr. Watson comes to the charge, blaming botanists for " love of appro- 
bation," or as seeking notoriety, and I, in my turn, grumble at his uiicharitableness !
205 
son calls an " impassable barrier between s^arieties and species." If 
this is not to be expected or attainable, then an arbitrary boundary 
must be proposed, subject to the influences of observation and experi- 
ment ; and this really renders it expedient that at one time a variety 
should be named as a species, and at another a supposed species sub- 
side into a variety, just as the evidence before an observer preponde- 
rates one way or the other.
If this be inconvenient to the systeraatist 
or botanical statist, it must be submitted to, till it has been decidedly 
shown what are the characters to distinguish species from variety in 
every natural family.
It is doubtless true, as remarlced by Fries, that small is the diffe- 
rence that depends upon a hair, and yet a haii''s breadth may be a 
sufficient line of demarcation between safety and destruction, and 
therefore not quite to be despised.
But until botanists have decided 
what is absolutely essential to specific distinction, and what is not so, 
in every family, we may be justified, I think, in attending to minute 
characters, and noting them, until extended observation produces 
conviction of truth or error.
But is not the variety of Nature's pro- 
ductions a source of the most ravishing delight, and the contemplation 
and examination of her numerous vegetable forms a pursuit well wor- 
thy of our attention, as giving rise to mental pleasure, and exercising 
the perceptive faculties ?
Our predecessors in the field, indeed, have 
only left us in our own countiy the gleanings of the harvest ; but let 
us not rest satisfied that they have done all that can be accomplished, 
but carefully look out for ourselves.
Some botanists appear displeas- 
ed with Nature because she smiles at the rules of art, and hence they 
would, if possible, fetter her within their own definitions.
In their ca- 
priciousness they will expand some genera agreeable to them with 
well-turned species, but others must remain locked up with all their 
inmates, and no liberty is to be allowed them.
How many fresh delights 
have opened upon me since I studied minutely the characters of the 
Rubi, unchilled by the remark too often made on every hedge, that it 
is only Rubus fi'uticosus that is there !
And as to the objection of an 
herbarium's containing too many specimens of varieties or supposed 
species, I am of opinion that it is only by the study of numerous sjje- 
cimens that a fair judgment of the claims of any species can be arri- 
ved at, and that it is injudicious to found a species upon a single 
specimen only.
I think also, that it is unfair to contend sweepingly that botanists 
in general are guided in all they do by a " love of approbation " or no- 
toriety-seeking.
This is not my experience of my own botanical

acquaintance, antl many have I known whose love of Nature's beauties 
was as enthusiastic as it was modest, unassuming, and unaffected.
Perhaps there may be occasionally professional aspirers, who, anxious 
to gain the top of the tree, may be careless of disarranging its branches, 
if the rustling they make only brings them into notice ; such a casual 
disturbance may knock the dry sticks about our heads, and call for 
Mr. Watson's reprobation ; but such an annoyance from notoriety-seek- 
ing, if that be the only motive, is not likely to be of long continuance, 
nor are the whole body of practical botanists to be held responsible 
for it.
Without insisting upon the principles of phrenological deve- 
lopment in the matter, I should judge the feelings of the botanical 
rambler to be instigated first by the love of novelty, for this is common 
to us all, and to " range in fresh fields and pastures new," or gather 
for the first time, as Lucretius says, " new flowers," is exciting even to 
the uninitiated.
" 'Tis not for nothing that we life pursue, 
It pays our hopes with something still that's ne^v!^ â€” Dryden.
The love of knowledge follows upon the excitement of novelty, and 
we hasten to understand what we have discovered j and surely it is 
but cold comfort in return for our efforts to be told that instead of 
having progressed in knowledge, we only show our deficiency in rea- 
soning powers, but have the bump of notoriety well developed !
It 
would, I think, be but charitable to infer that in most instances truth 
is sought after ; for if a plant be found really not answering to re- 
corded descriptions, I cannot but think it deserves to be noted, even 
if it eventually turns out that it is the description only which requires 
correction.
Instead, therefore, of Mr. Watson's too sweeping condem- 
nation of " species-making," as he terms it, I would propose a resolu- 
tion by way of amendment, restricting all young botanists from pub- 
lishing new names till they had studied the science for at least five 
years, and preserved their specimens for examination and criticism.
But I think if a person has made any class, family, or genus, his pe- 
culiar study for upwards of five years, it is but fair to infer that he 
has found out something, and if so, let us by all means have the bene- 
fit of his labours, even if a change of names or a new species does re- 
sult in consequence.
That the term species, as Mr. Watson suggests, requires a more ex- 
tended definition, or recasting, may be correct ; or rather perhaps the 
characters on which a species is supposed to depend, are not the 
267 
same in every famil}', and hence a too rigorous form of words will be 
in all cases inapplicable.* Certainly, I think this requires to be look- 
ed into, for if characters are employed to determine species which are 
variable in themselves, the fault rests in the employment of this ex- 
ceptionable character.
Thus the involucra were formerly employed 
to determine the species of the Umbelliferse, and Q^^nanthe pimpinel- 
loides was described to have a general involucre, while GEnanthe 
peucedanifolia had not.
From this unimportant point being regarded 
iRimerous errors have arisen, and the two plants became confounded, 
and the former even erased from the British Flora by Mr. Babington ; 
and yet their roots show them to be perfectly distinct, and this cha- 
racter is constantly available, and probably may be most discrimina- 
tive in all the Umbelliferae, the roots of which are most important to 
mankind, though in some other orders this character may be of no ac- 
count.
So that whatever may be asserted about the oat changing into 
rye, I think all the ingenuity of the greatest advocate of transmutation 
would not be able to effect the change of a parsnip into a carrot, or 
induce the QE nan the phellandrium to become a celery.
Only then 
find out the character that is really the most important in an order or 
tribe, and much doubt and confusion is removed, and we find indica- 
tions of permanent boundaries in Nature there, at any rate.
In the rose tribe Nature appears most capricious ; root, leaves, 
armature and fruit all fail us at need as unerring absolute characters ; 
yet surely the attempt to discriminate between the variable forms that 
occur is not to be despised, because in the effort truth may be arrived 
* Whatever theory may suggest, practically, botanists are right in separating as 
species plants of the satne family that have permanent palpable differences in a wild 
state in some particular charactei'.
It is obviously impossible for a travelling collector 
to make experiments, and any assumption on his part could only be productive of error.
Experimental botany should be considered a separate department, and let the experi- 
mentalist make his claims to regulate or modify specific nomenclature, as the lawyers 
say " without prejudice." With respect to varieties, there is perhaps more anomaly and 
ambiguity than even in species, since uo weight appears to be bestowed upon the rela- 
tive amount of variation, and thus almost every botanical author's "Alpha â€” Beta â€” 
Gamma '' â€” is different to that of others, giving rise to whole columns of synonyms.
Now this really requires emendation.
Transient varieties, therefore, should be distin- 
guished from pennanent ones, and rules laid down for this purpose.
A plant with an 
additional petal or two, a white-blotched or fissile leaf, or a white flower instead of a 
coloured one, though curious, is rather a sport or luxuriation, than a variety, and does 
not deserve to be estimated in the same manner as more important and continuing 
characters would, affecting the appearance of the whole plant.
Hence varieties ought 
to be classed as casual or permanent.
268 
at, and this would be an abundant reward of all past labour.
Besides, 
in such a labyrinth a proposition must at first be made, and experi- 
ence will eventually decide as to its correctness ; but assumption 
without proof, that an alleged species is only a variety, ought to be 
reprobated in every case.
The boundaries of species both in the ge- 
nera Rosa and Rubus are not yet perfectly ascertained, and therefore 
I cannot agree with Mr. Watson that the attempt to ascertain these 
boundaries is " frivolous." Neither, if the usual definition of species 
will not apply in every family alike, is it philosophical to give up the 
term as useless and " fall into the transition-of-species theory." For 
in some families there may be and is a transition of one form into 
another to a limited but not a constantly progressive extent, just as 
the river winds in a thousand sinuosities to reach the ocean, its waters 
by evaporation again returning to the mountains to pass over the same 
windings as before.
So in every tribe of plants, the seed more or less 
may have power to sport whether in leaves, flowers, or fruit, to an ex- 
tent perhaps unknown or unascertained, but not unlimited ; it can 
only go through the changes providentially assigned to it ; in its seed 
again brought back to its old position.
This is to be particularly 
borne in mind, for these restricted changes by no means oblige us to 
side with the never-ending transmutation theory.
The Vesligians 
would infer that certain metamorphoses which we see confined in 
their range, prove former transmutations which we have not witnessed, 
and that to an unlimited extent.
But this is most fallacious reason- 
ing, for all the varieties, for instance, that horticulture shows us in the 
Dahlia or the geranium, even if exhibited in a wild state, could give 
us no just reason to believe that something else other than the seed 
of a Dahlia or geranium had given rise originally to them, and that 
they would eventually spur on to ulterior developments different from 
their present family appearances.
Because Tilia Europaea and par- 
vifolia may, as I believe is the case, be the same species under diffe- 
rent phases of growth, and the character of the leaf in the lime may 
be therefore variable, it would be absurd to suppose that because we 
must alter our definition in this respect, our confidence ceases as to 
the Tilia really remaining one, and that we may rationally look out 
for something else arising from the transmutation of its roots, when it 
falls or is cut down.
It may be inconvenient to find that Nature does not respect our 
definition of species in every case, and that thus between the primrose 
and the cowslip she will sport into oxlips, stalked primroses, or red 
cowslips ; but it being once established that it is so, from repeated 
269 
observations, the difficulty ceases there, and we find that the oxlip 
cannot be placed as a permanent species, alternating as it does be- 
tween, and producible from either the cowslip or primrose.
Other 
families may be found to present similar anomalies, and let observ^a- 
tion go on detecting them wherever they are perceivable, and thus we 
may eventually know the extent of Flora's sportive footsteps.
But 
wherever these may lead us, let us not be afraid of finding out the 
truth, or attempt to repress observation as " frivolous " in any depart- 
ment, from the fear of our science becoming too complicated, or that 
it will oblige us to remodel our definitions.
Would, indeed, that in 
numerous cases they were remodelled, for too often, it is not the thing 
itself that is obscure, but the dark cloud of obscure words in which 
its description is clothed !
Here we have to grope as in a darkened 
gallery, where the windows have been purposely closed up for solemn 
effect, and we can only find our way by the aid of the friendly chinks 
unintentionally left open.
This is too often the effect of a long la- 
boured description.
But to come to an end of these " cursory thoughts," I cannot but 
remark, that whatever sports and floral variations may be detected by 
the experimentalist in Phytology to a bounded extent, we need not 
fear that the grand principle of the general identity and permanence 
of species can be broken in upon or materially disturbed.
We may 
not in every case find the " impassable barrier " Mi-.
Watson desires 
between species and varieties, but we may detect the species that do 
vary, and like the oscillations of the pendulum, note the extent of 
their utmost variations.
This will assist our judgments in doubtful 
cases ; and instead, therefore, of checking observation from the idea 
that all is done that can be done in British Botany, I believe that 
much remains to be effected, and something perhaps to be undone.
While, then, I would wish observers to be cautious, undogmatical, 
truth-seeking, and not unconscious of what others have done before 
them, I believe we shall only profit by an increase of observers and 
an increase of observations, which, whether arising from a " love of 
approbation " only, as Mr. Watson suggests, or from a love of science 
and truth, as I would myself sincerely hope and believe, is really of 
no account, if science ultimately progresses in consequence.

Report of the Meeting of the British Association, extracted from the 
'Athenaeum,'' No. 923, dated July 5th, 1845.
Section D.â€” ZOOLOGY AND BOTANY.
The Rev. L, Jenyns read a paper ' On the Turf of the Cambridge- 
shire Fens.' â€” This turf was not formed by Sphagnum, as most peat, 
but from various species of aquatic plants which had been accumulat- 
ing for a long period of years above the remains of forest trees which 
lie buried at the bottom of the moor.
There are two distinct kinds 
oi turf, the upper Siwd the lower.
The former is the more compact 
and heavy of the two.
The latter consists entirely of the bark, wood 
and branches of the submerged trees.
The turf is not now rapidly 
formed on account of the improved system of drainage.
Formerly it 
was su])posed to grow about twenty inches in sixteen years.
Dr. Falconer said, that he had observed in Cashmere, at the bot- 
toms of lakes, turf of a very similar kind to the lower bed just men- 
tioned.
It consisted of the remains of various aquatic plants, as 
Chara, Potamogeton, Utricularia and Nelumbium.
The inhabitants 
obtained it from the bottom of the lake by means of a rake, and used 
it as fuel.
â€” Mr. Babington stated that the character of the Scotch 
and Irish bogs was different from that of the fens of Cambridgeshire.
He had seen peat procured in Ireland from the bottoms of ponds in 
the same way as described by Dr. Falconer in Cashmere.
Mr. H.
E. 
Strickland had seen peat in Ireland converted into a substance as 
hard as jet, so that it might be used by the turner.
The formation 
of this peat threw much light on the formation of coal.
There could 
be no doubt that our coal beds were some of them formed in the man- 
ner of bogs, whilst others resulted from vegetable matter deposited at 
the bottom of the sea.
â€” Mr. Selby had seen peat quite solid and 
bright as amber.
â€” The Bishop of Norwich stated, that the trees bu- 
ried in the bogs of Lancashire exhibited marks of being burnt, and 
many of them had on them the strokes of the axe, â€” Mr. Dowden 
pointed out the remarkable fact in Mr. Jenyns's observations that the 
light turf was undermost.
The laws of nature were better observed 
in Ireland, where the heaviest turf was at the bottom.
â€” Mr, Murchi- 
soN remarked, that it was an extraordinary fact that there were no 
bofs in Russia, and yet throughout that country there was a great 
extent of mountain limestone as in Ireland, the most boggy country 
in the world.
He supposed it was attributable to the character of the 
climate.
In Ireland it was always raining, and moisture favoured the 
271 
development of bogs.
â€” Mr. R.
Ball, of Dublin, had lately observed 
a number of trees which were blown down in 1839, covered over with 
gi'ass, and the interspaces between the trees was filling up with vege- 
table matter, and in the course of time he believed they would form a 
bog.
â€” Prof.
Oldham, of Dublin, observed, that there was a difference 
in the mountain limestone of Ireland and Russia, inasmuch as the 
former was covered with beds of clay, and it was on these clay beds 
that the bogs were formed.
Sir R.
ScHOMBURGK read a description of the Murichi, or Ita Palm, 
of Guiana.
This tree grows from the Llanos of Cumana to the west- 
ern tributaries of the Rio Negro and the mouth of the Amazon, or 
over an area of 550,000 square miles.
It was called by Father Gura- 
illa the arbol cle la vida, or tree of life, on account of its various uses.
It is of the greatest importance to the inhabitants of the country in 
which it grows.
The trunk and its leaves are used for various house- 
hold purposes.
The sap is a saccharine fluid, much drunk by the 
natives.
The flowers afford a sweet fermentable liquid, resembling 
champagne.
The pith of its trunk affords a kind of sago.
Even in its 
decay, this palm is of use, and affords a delicacy to the Indians, which 
likewise many colonists do not refuse, namely, the larva of a large 
beetle.
The Curculio palmarum is found in large numbers in the pith 
when the trunk is near its decay, and which, when boiled or roasted, 
resembles in taste the marrow of a beef-bone.
Its average height is 
about 50 feet, and it has been observed growing at a height of 3000 
to 4000 feet above the level of the sea.
Prof.
Allman laid before the Section a monstrosity occurring in 
Saxifraga Geum.
The three external verticils of the flowers were 
normal, but between the stamens and pistil there was developed a se- 
ries of adventitious carpels crowded upon the margin of a cup-like 
production which surrounds the lower half of the pistil.
These ad- 
ventitious carpels were characterised by their backs being turned to- 
wards the axis of the flower.
The carpels bear ovules on their mar- 
gins, which acquired a very considerable degree of development, 
becoming completely anatropous, like those of the normal ovary.
Dr.
Allman explained this monstrosity by supposing the existence of a 
series of secondary axes, which are given off in a whorl between the 
stamens and the primary axis of the flower.
These axes terminate in 
imperfect flowers, of which the additional carpels are the only 
remains.
Prof.
Henslow exhibited a specimen of Papaver orientalis, in which 
the filaments of the stamens were converted into bodies bearing ovules.
272 
Prof.
E. Forbes read a paper ' On the Distribution of Endemic 
Plants, more especially those of the British Islands, considered with 
regard to Geological Changes.' The author stated that the hypothe- 
sis of the descent of all the individuals of a species, either from a first 
pair, or from a first individual, being assumed, the isolation of assem- 
blages of individuals from those centres, and the existence of endemic 
or very local plants remains to be accounted for.
Natural transport, 
the agency of sea, rivers, and winds, and carriage by animals or 
through the agency of man, are means in the majority of cases insuf- 
ficient.
The true cause the author proposed to seek in an ancient 
connexion of the outposts or isolated areas with the original centres, 
and the subsequent isolation of the former through geological changes 
and events, especially those dependent on the elevation and depression 
of land.
Selecting the Flora of the British Isles as a means of test- 
ing his theory, he divided its vegetation into five Floras : first, a west 
Pyrenean, confined to the west of Ireland, and mostly to the moun- 
tains of that district ; second, a Flora related to that of the south- 
west of France, extending from the Channel Isles across Devon and 
Cornwall to the south-east, and part of the south-west of Ireland ; 
third, a Flora common to the north of France and south-east of Eng- 
land, and especially developed in the chalk districts ; fourth, an Al- 
pine Flora developed in the mountains of Wales, north of England 
and Scotland ; and fifth, a Germanic Flora, extending over the greater 
part of Great Britain and Ireland, mingling with the other Floras, and 
diminishing, though slightly, as we proceed westwards, indicating its 
easterly origin and relation to the characteristic Flora of northern and 
western Germany.
The author then went into details, pointing out 
the circumstances which gave a probable age to each of these British 
Floras, and the geological changes which had occurred to isolate 
them from Floras of other parts of Europe, with which they were for- 
merly in connexion, and with which they had a common parentage.
He maintained, in conclusion, that the peculiar distribution of en- 
demic animals, especially of the terrestrial Mollusca, bore him out in 
these views.
He proposed to pursue the subject in detail, with refe- 
rence to both animal and vegetable life, in connexion with the re- 
searches of the Geological Survey.
This paper produced a long and interesting discussion.
Mr. J.
Ball argued against the hypothesis of there being only a single species 
created.
If there were but one individual we were not in a position 
to say what were its characters from our present forms.
He saw no 
objection to the view that the same species might be created at two 
273 
distinct periods of time, as well as of space.
â€” Prof.
Phillips would 
not enter into the question of the hypothesis, but as a geologist he 
could say, that the changes required to produce the isolation of the 
Floras spoLen of by Mr. Forbes, were not greater than must have 
taken place to produce other well-known geological phenomena.
He 
believed the views of Prof.
Forbes of great importance ; and, in re- 
gard to the examination of the distribution of extinct forms of animals 
and vegetables, would furnish a mode of investigation of the greatest 
value.
â€” Mr. C.
C. Babington stated, that if the presumed geological 
phenomena of Prof.
Forbes could be granted to have taken place, that 
would be a strong argument in favour of the hypothesis he had adopt- 
ed.
The great difficulty in the way of supposing the creation of but 
one individual of a species was their frequent disti'ibution over various 
parts of the world.
â€” Prof.
Forbes, in reply, stated that if the hypothe- 
sis of a single pair or an individual of each species were not granted, 
there was an end to all palaeontology and its value in geological in- 
quiry.
If the hypothesis of descent be not true, then the deductions 
of geologists from it are erroneous.

The hot weather and a direct southern aspect have well nigh ter- 
minated my experimental city garden.
The heat became intolerable 
and the loss of plants pi'oportionably great: some few, however, seem 
to bear any degi'ee of heat, and even now there is a goodly sprinkling 
of fronds, all of them young and of the tenderest green.
Some north- 
ern ferns seem well satisfied with the high temperature, while others 
perish from its effects.
As yet, however, my experience in these 
matters is so limited that I prefer saying but little, since I may very 
possibly find myself attempting to raise mere casualties to the rank 
and importance of laws.
***** 
T am disposed to believe that our Pteridologists have rarely taken 
that comprehensive view of the characters of feras which is requisite 
for their classification in accordance with nature.
It is well known that 
feras, in common with other beings, whether animal or vegetable, 
possess organs tending to two different purposes ; â€” the preservation 
of the individual and the preservation of its kind : and these purposes, 
though intimately connected, though the means of their attainment

274 
be so elaborately interwoven that they are often confounded in our 
short-sighted investigations, are yet, in every instance, found to be dis- 
tinct if the inquiry be skilfully and carefully conducted.
In ferns, 
it will be at once seen that the roots tend to the preservation of the 
individual, so also does the stem : under all its names of root, rhizoma, 
underground stem, caudex, trunk, &c.,* the discerning mind recog- 
nises the same organ under a variety of forms.
The fructification 
is obviously a provision for the preservation of the kind, and it may 
be remarked that it never appears in any degree to subserve the pre- 
servation of the individual, but rather tends to its exhaustion and im- 
poverishment.
The frond which bears the fructification, may perhaps 
occur to some botanists as holding a debatable office between the 
preservation of the individual and that of the kind ; but this view will, 
I think, be dispelled when we consider that in those ferns, where the 
fructification occupies the entire surface of some fronds, others, per- 
fectly sterile, are provided, and there can be no doubt that these per- 
form the offices of nutrition, respiration, &c., and therefore, that when 
a frond is foliaceous, and produces masses of fruit at intervals, the por- 
tions not thus occupied may be regarded as subserving the preservation 
of the individual.
In Botrychium, Ophioglossura, Aneiraia, &c., we find 
the frond divided into a fertile and a barren branch, and there is no 
reason to doubt that the barren branch, not being in these instances 
required for the perfecting of the fruit, is provided for the service of 
the plant itself.
Having thus indicated the existence of two classes of functions and 
the provision of parts adapted to each, on proceeding to weigh the 
importance of the two, we shall, I think, be inclined to concede the 
greater importance to those which subserve the preservation of the 
kind,t and therefore shall consider that botanists have acted wisely in 
laying so great stress on fructification.
J I am, however, inclined to 
think, that the first class of organs has not received that consideration 
to which it is entitled ; and I could wish to see characters carefully 
drawn from the direction and form of the rhizoma, the attachment and 
vernation of the fronds, and the presence, situation or absence of dis- 
tinct articulation in the stipes.
In two, at least, of our British ferns 
* Sir J.
E. Smith adds the term " runners." 
f This subject, however, admits of question, and deserves a more rigid examination 
than is desirable in this phice.
X Throughout Zoology we trust almost exclusively to characters derived from parts 
provided for the requirings of the individual, but I believe not from a conviction of 
their greater importance.
275 
articulation exists : in Polypodium vulgarc the joint is at the junction 
of the stipes with the rhizoma, and I find that every discoloured frond 
in my little city fernery falls off at the slightest touch, leaving a round 
scar on the rhizoma.
In Woodsia the articulation is higher up in the 
stipes, the disjunction always leaving a portion thereof attached to ihe 
rhizoma.
In Lastraa Callipteris the stipes is long-persistent, its un- 
derground portion living many years ; there is no trace of articulation, 
and separation can only be produced by force.
A contrast is often 
produced in the habit of a .species by the character of its rhizoma : 
thus we see the fronds of Lastra^a multiflora arranged regularly round 
a centre, w^hile in Lastrsea spinosa they are without arrangement : the 
cause is to be found in the vertical position of the rhizoma in one, its 
horizontal position in the other.
Who that is aware of this remarka- 
bly constant distinction could by any possibility confound the species ?
In vernation the observant eye will detect great differences, and in no 
group is this more strikingly displayed than in Pteris, as at present 
restricted.
Thus Pteris tremula is circinate, while aquilina and cau- 
data have a distinct form of vernation.
Excepting for the more easy 
distinguishing of species, I am inclined to consider the form of frond 
unavailable.
On contrasting a vertical with a horizontal rhizoma, an articulate 
with an inarticulate stipes, a circinate with a simply bent vernation, 
I find great difficulty in drawing any conclusions as regards the pri- 
mary grouping of ferns : but it is far different with the fructification, 
which ajjpears to possess points of structural resemblance throughout 
groups consisting of many hundred species.
I am therefore com- 
pelled to consider the diversity of structure in those organs whose 
function is the preservation of the individual, as minor or secondary 
characters ; while the diversity of structure in those organs w^hose 
destination is the preservation of the kind, are major or primary cha- 
racters, and in all natural arrangements must take the precedence of 
the others.
May w^e not subdivide these primary and secondary characters, 
and establish subdivisions in each ?
For instance, regarding the veins 
as receptacles, and therefore equal in importance to the receptacles of 
flowering plants, we cannot fail to observe that the attachment of the 
capsules is sometimes median, sometimes lateral ; and this appears 
to me the distinction between Polypodimn and Asplenium as these 
were formerly understood.
Again, the involucre is sometimes pi*esent 
and sometimes absent ; and it requires much careful consideration 
before we can arrive at any just decision whether this discrepancy 
276 
affords a just ground for subdivision, and if so to what amount.
In 
order to judge fairly of the vakxe of characters derived from these 
sources, let us compare their constancy.
The median or dorsal attachment of the capsules is common to the 
vast tribe or suborder which comprises the genus Polypodium of Lin- 
neus.
The large section subtracted from the genus by Swartz under 
the name of Aspidium, offers no objection in this respect.
The chief 
groups into which the British examples of this tribe are divisible are 
these : â€” 
Woodsia 
ex.
Ilvensis 
Cystopteris 
ex.
fragilis 
Polystichurn 
ex.
aculeatum 
Lasliaea, Presi 
ex.
multiflora 
Lastraea, Bory 
exs.
( Oreoptcris 
\ Phegopleris 
Polypodium 
ex.
vulgare 
If we carefully examine these, we shall find no exception to the rule 
that the attachment of the capsules to the receptacle is median or 
dorsal.
But if we turn our attention to the presence or absence of 
the involucre, the result of the investigation will be widely different.
In Ilvensis the hairy fringe around the base of the capsules is consi- 
dered an involucre : in fragilis a hoodlike involucre springs from the 
receptacle at the point where the capsules are attached : in aculeatum 
it spreads like an umbrella over the capsules, standing on a central 
stipes like a mushroom : in multiflora the capsules are about half co- 
vered, the involucre being forced on one side, and the capsules pro- 
truding on the other : in Oreopteris the involucre may be said to have 
reached a minimum as regards size, when present, but its presence 
seems rather the exception than the rule : in Phegopteris it is so rare- 
ly observed that most authors deny its existence, and in vulgare I 
believe no author has asserted that he has found it.
Those who are 
acquainted with exotic ferns are well aware how perfect a series is to 
be found filling the gap between aculeatum and multiflora : in some 
instances the involucre is so exactly intermediate, that it is a most 
difficult problem to solve whether its attachment is central or lateral.
Again, some exotic ferns exhibit the involucre in every intermediate 
state between that of multiflora and that of Oreopteris ; while others 
most completely connect Oreopteris and Phegopteris.
It is remark- 
able, that in Oreopteris the same plant will produce fronds with and 
fronds without involucres, and even the same frond may not unfre- 
quently be found having some of its clusters accompanied by an in- 
volucre and some of them perfectly naked.
277 
The constancy or inconstancy of the mode of attachment of the 
capsules and of the presence of the involucre may thus be exhibited :

Robert Brown was the first to perceive how essentially the fructifica- 
tion of the common Brakes differed from that of other ferns with which 
it was associated under the name of Pteris.
Sir J.
E. Smith dwelt 
on this discrepancy, but appears not to have considered it generic ; 
and it seems to have escaped the notice of almost every other botanist.
John Smith â€” a name I am ever ready to honour â€” gives the weight of 
his authority against separating aquilina from the genuine Pterides : 
he remarks in the * Journal of Botany' (vol.
iv.
p. 165), " some obser- 
vers have stated that the sori of Pteris aquilina are furnished with a 
narrow indusium situated on the inner side of the receptacle, but 
from my own observation I cannot consider the slightly elevated fim- 
briate ridge which bounds the inner side of the sporangia as being 
analogous to an indusium." In my attempt therefore to separate 
generically, Pteris aquilina from the genuine Pterides, I fear I shall 
meet with slender encouragement.
It should, however, be observed 
that the genus Pteris has long been disintegrated : several marked 
forms having been separated under the names of Allosorus, Platyloma, 
Doryopteris, Litobrochia and Cassebeera : while a group, more strik- 
ingly heterogeneous since the abduction of these divisions, still 
retains the original appellation of Pteris.
In accordance with esta- 
blished usage the name of Pteris should remain with the first or typi- 
cal species, and such others as may be supposed to possess the great- 
est number of distinctive characters in common with that typical 
species : while aquilina, the thirteenth on the Linnean list, and per- 
haps more decidedly remote than either of the others, seems to require 
a new name.
I therefore propose calling it Eupteris aquilina, since, 
although it is not the Linnean type, it is essentially the Pteris of all 
botanists.
278 
Genus Eupteris.
Roots fibrous.
Rhizoma subterranean, horizontal, rapidly extending.
Frond single, rising perpendicularly from the rhizoma at longer or 
shorter intervals : its stipes erect ; its vernation bent, not cir- 
cinate ; its texture subcoriaceous ; its division compound ; its 
ultimate divisiofis sessile, with distinct midvein and many di- 
chotomously branched lateral veins, all of which are united to a 
marginal vein.
Fructijlcation.
The marginal vein of the ultimate divisions serves as 
a receptacle for the capsules, these being attached almost 
throughout its length in a continuous linear series, which is co- 
vered by the bleached fimbriate superior epidermis : involucre 
linear, its free margin fimbriate, its fixed margin attached to 
the marginal vein beneath the capsules.
Many years have elapsed since I ventured to express an opinion 
that genera were for the most part human inventions, designed to ac- 
commodate or promote the views of their author, and by no means 
positive indications of natural grouping.
Up to the present time I 
have seen no reason to alter or modify the opinion then expressed : 
still, when the work of subdivision has been commenced, when a 
striking species has been abstracted here and there fromalai'ge group, 
and a number of " common and less interesting forms "* allowed to 
remain under the original generic title, then the constitution of the 
genus becomes wholly changed, and its author could not recognise his 
own handywork in the impoverished group as subsequently restricted.
This is the case with Pteris, and here I should observe, that in ven- 
turing on my present task, it is not the Pteris of Linneus of which I 
treat, but that fractional part thereof â€” the Pteris of John Smith, or 
the Allosori aquilini of Presl.
I will now endeavour to explain somewhat more at large the pecu- 
liarities of the new genus which I propose to establish.
The rhizoma, fig.
1, a, is entirely subterranean, nearly cylindrical, 
and usually about the size of a goose-quill ; it is remarkably succulent, 
and is clothed with a dark brown velvety coating : it extends very 
rapidly in a horizontal direction.
The fronds rise perpendicularly from the rhizoma at unequal inter- 
vals : until they nearly reach the surface of the ground the stipes only 
is discernible, the apex being rounded and disjjlaying no trace what- 
* I quote the fashionable botanical ])hrascology.

indentation does, however, exist at the point a in fig.

projection above this, shown better at b in the sectional view fig.

Eupteris aquiliiia.

contains the future foliaceons portion.
Figures 4 and 6 represent the 
same frond in a state somewhat more advanced, and figs.
5 and 7 are 
280 
median longitudinal sectional views of the same.
Tn all these it will 
be seen, that the foliaceous part is bent forward on the stipes, forming 
therewith a kind of hook ; a structure strikingly different from that 
of Pteris tremula, represented at figs.
8, 9, 10, which, although gene- 
rally held to be closely allied to aquilina, very clearly exhibits the 
usual circinate vernation.
It may, however, be observed, that the ex- 
treme point of the bent rhizoma has a slight tendency to exhibit a 
curve, as shown in fig.
7, and all the partial rachides are more or less 
circinate, as shown at b in fig.
1. There is something very anoma- 
lous in the rapid development of the foliaceous portion of the frond : 
at a stage, as regards the stipes, when the circinate frond of multiflora 
exhibits, if unrolled, all its pinnae and pinnules, and even clusters of 
capsules, that of aquilina is a mere indication, a slight inequality on 
the surface, and its component parts cannot be detected under a lens 
of high power : yet in a few days we find it has increased and un- 
folded with such marvellous rapidity, that in aquilina we have a frond 
surpassing that of nearly every other British fern in magnitude.
The texture of the frond,* when the plant has grown in its naturally 
exposed situation, is tough and somewhat leathery : in the autumn it 
assumes a brown hue, and becomes still more rigid and coriaceous.
When growing in shade, as in woods, this texture is not so observable.
The lobes or ultimate divisions of the frond have a median vein, Â«, 
fif^.
11, and many branched lateral veins, all of which run to the ex- 
treme margin and there unite with a marginal vein, h b.
The margin is 
convolute, and its elasticity is so invincible that it is ex- 
tremely difficult to maintain a lobe in a sufficiently flat 
position to exhibit, as in the accompanying diagram, 
the formula of venation.
Attached to the marginal 
vein and extending throughout its length, is a bleached 
semi-hyaline membrane fringed with a series of jointed 
capillary segments.f Beneath this membrane are the 
capsules, also attached to the marginal vein, and ar- 
ranged along it in a continuous linear series.
Again, 
beneath this linear series of capsules is a second bleach- 
ed and fringed membrane very similar to the first." 
This inner membrane I regard as the true involucre.
Venation, Fig. 11.

* These observations have reference exclusively to Eupteris aquilina ; they will per- 
haps require modifying, since a North American species, which appears to be uniform- 
ly less rigid than aquilina, must unquestionably be included in the same genus.

Remarks on Structural Botany.
By William Wilson, Esq.
(Continued from page 229).
In the published part of the present paper (see Phytol.
ii.
p. 229), 
instead of defining Raphe as an ^^ adherent funiculus^'' \V "^ovXdihe 
better to substitute the following : â€” " a funiculus adhering laterally 
throughout its whole length to the ovule." 
It follows from this view of the subject, that the term chalaza is 
wholly unnecessary, and should therefore be discarded.
In connexion with this topic it may be proper to obviate some con- 
fusion which has crept into the definition of an ovule &c.
In Lindley's Introduction, p.
1 79, the ovule is said to be " inclosed 
in two sacs or integuments :" it is much more correct to say that it 
consists of two sacs inclosing a nucleus.
(See Lindley's Key, No.
398, p.
30).
In Lindley's Introduction (p.
218), the term orthotropal is used to 
express a certain position of the embryo, which is at variance with 
the definition at p.
417, where orthotropal is described as "straight, 
and having the same direction as the body to which it belongs ;" 
whereas it is intended, in the case of an embryo, to indicate that its 
radicle is the lowest point ; that is, where the ovule is anatropous 
with its foramen downwards, the embryo will be orthotropal, with its 
cotyledons directed upwards.
It seems advisable therefore to discard 
this and the cognate words in reference to an embryo, per se ; as they 
Vol. n.
2 n 
282 
confound rather than illustrate.
As a general rule, it is sufficient to 
say, that the direction of the embryo is such, that the foramen of the 
ovule points out the future position of the radicle.
(See Lindley's 
Key, No. 412, p.
81).
The radicle, however, is not ^^ always next 
the foramen " as there stated.
An exception occurs in Lemna gibba, 
where the indurated foramen of the secundine or mesosperm is carried 
up in germination on the tip of the cotyledon, to whose lower lip it is 
firmly attached like a little circular shield, and the radicle remains 
within the testa, which bears the same relation to it as the sheath does 
to the root of the full-grown plant.
Here, then, we have an instance 
of an anatropous ovule containing an " anatropal " embryo ; though 
inasmuch as that embryo has the same dii'ection as the body of the 
seed, it ought rather to be called orthotropal.
In Lemna minor the 
embryo is " heterotropal " because the ovule is in a position interme- 
diate between orthotropous and anatropous, viz.
â€” the base and fora- 
men directed horizontally across the ovary.

Note on Cinclidotus riparius, var.
&. terrestris.
By William Wilson, 
Esq.
This is the moss found near Bristol by Mr. Thwaites, to which I at 
first applied the name Barbula cylindrical Wis. MSS.
Some doubts still exist about the propriety of referring it as a va- 
riety to Cinclidotus riparius, because the aquatic state, though dili- 
gently sought for in the stream of the river Frome, has not yet been 
found.

On the claims of Alyssum calycinum to a place in the British Flora.
By the Rev. Gerard Edwards Smith, M.A.
Allow me the space to make a few remarks on the claims of Alys- 
sum calycinum to a place in the native Flora of this island.
The distribution of this plant in this country is extensive.
Your 
friends and the records of English Botany have traced the species 
from Arbroath and Edinburgh through Yorkshire into Leicestershire, 
and southwards into Essex.
It is remarkable that all these localities 
283 
approach or touch the eastern coast, and, in a descending line through 
the island, lie in the general longitude of Belgium, Germany and 
France, countries considered the native habitat of the plant in ques- 
tion.
There is no circumstance of which T am aware, connected with 
the distribution of Alyssum calycinum, which invalidates its claim to 
a place in our indigenous Flora.
The objections raised against its claims rely principally on two 
grounds.
J. That it has not been noticed as a British plant until re- 
cently.
2. That it occurs in England only upon ploughed land.
The first objection is of no more weight than doubts as to the in- 
digenous character of Bunium Bulbocastanum, Ophrys arachnites, 
Orobanche caryophyllacese, or Neottia aestivalis would be.
" Full many a flower is doomed to blush unseen,'' 
and that is not the flower's fault.
2. It appears that Alyssum calyci- 
num has been gathered only on ploughed land in England : whereas 
in Scotland it is collected upon grassy commons near the sea-coast.
But in the continental range of the species, dry fields and sandy way- 
sides, and walls are mentioned as its favourite habitats.
These are 
scarcely more uncultivated localities than arable land.
Besides this, 
many of our common plants equally affect ploughed and virgin soil, 
as Plantago lanceolata, Leontodon Taraxacum, Trifolium procumbens 
and filiforme, &c., &c.
It is a new objection to the indigenous origin 
of an annual or biennial that it occurs only on ploughed land, in a 
certain locality.
If this be a good rule in favour of the naturalization 
of a species, how many of our commonest plants, such as the three 
above mentioned, must be rejected from all claim to a place in our 
native Flora ?
If the plate in the 'Supplement to English Botany' is 
the likeness of average Scotch specimens, the stature of the Scotch 
plant is short indeed compared with other specimens, and all which I 
have observed in the fallows of this parish.
It is worthy remark, that in Cantley the Alyssum calycinum has 
been noticed only upon land which has been untouched by the plough 
eighteen months, or at least twelve.
The plants in May had a woody 
branched decumbent base, stripped of leaves, from which the shoots 
which produced the spring flowers rose upward erect.
These branches 
had not certainly grown up since the winter.
The plant is, I suspect, a 
biennial ; and if so, its presence, as to ploughed land ox fallows only is 
accounted for, as well as its rare occurrence : the young plants being 
mostly ploughed in at Michaelmas or Lent.
I have detected it, however, upon every fallow, with a sandy loam 
284 
soil having an excess of sand, which I have had time to examine care- 
fully : most abundantly in a field nearest and north of Besecar Grange 
farm ; but in a similar soil on Wilby, Besecar, and the Glebe farms, 
it associates with Veronica triphyllos, which is frequent and plentiful 
on the sandy loam of this parish : not so abundant, however, as the 
elegant Agrostis Spica-venti, which is indeed universal.
I do not understand the observation in Mr. Babington's excellent 
' Manual,' " Shorter filaments with two setaceous appendages at the 
base." These processes are attached to the base of the flower, and 
remain so, after the stamens have been removed.
They have the ap- 
pearance of abortive filaments, and might perhaps distinguish the 
yellow-flowered species of Alyssum from the white.
These appen- 
dages are represented, imperfectly, in the figure in ' Supplement to 
English Botany,' t.
2853.
The following is a list of the localities of Alyssum calycinum which 
T have noticed in your pages, and in the communications of firiends.

Notes on the Cowslip and Primrose.
By W, Marshall, Esq.
Will you allow one who takes a great interest in everything relat- 
ing to Phytology, to contribute a fact which bears somewhat on the 
specific identity of the cowslip and primrose ?
Some few years ago, 
when all, and more than all my leisure time was devoted to botanical 
pursuits, having heard of the results of Professor Henslow's experi- 
ments on this subject, and being desirous of testing their accuracy, by 
an independent observation, I procured a wild cowslip from an ad- 
joining pasture, very early in the season, and planted it in my garden 
in rich soil, in which, at the time, I had neither polyanthus, primrose, 
nor oxlip.
The plant grew vigorously, and at the proper season I collected the 
seeds and sowed them broad-cast on a small plot of ground.
When 
they had attained a convenient size, 1 planted out about sixty of the 
285 
seedlings, four inches apart every way.
They grew vigorously, and I 
believe all, but certainly nearly all, flowered the following season, and 
with what result think you ?
Why, every individual of them was a 
mere cowslip, in all respects like its parent, not one of the sixty indivi- 
duals having sported either in form or colour.
After this decided result the plants were neglected and trodden 
upon, but some flowered again the second year without any change.
Would not this experiment, which can be attested by others as well 
as myself, lead to the conclusion, that there must have been a "hitch" 
somewhere in the recorded experiments of Professor Henslow and Mr.
Watson ?
I do not pretend to suggest where.
A year or two after the above experiment, I sowed in like man- 
ner, a few seeds of the oxlip, with a similar result.

BOTANICAL SOCIETY OF EDINBURGH.
Thursday, May Sth, 1845.
â€” Dr. Seller, V.
P., in the chair.
A collection of British specimens was announced from the London 
Botanical Society ; and fresh specimens of a Primula, regarded as 
the P.
elatior of Jacquin, from Dr. Dewar, Dunfermline, were placed 
on the table.
The following papers were read â€” 
1. 'On some species of Cuscuta.' By Charles C.
Babington, M.A., 
F.L.S., &c., Cambridge.
2. ' On the genus Diodium, Breb: By John Ralfs, M.R.C.S., &c.,

Thursday, June I2th, 1845.
â€” Dr. Douglas Maclagan, President, 
in the chair.
The Secretary read a letter from Professor Graham, pointing out an 
error in the minutes relative to the donation of South American plants 
presented at the April meeting, (Phytol, ii.
191), and moved that the 
notice of said donation should be corrected as follows : â€” "A commu- 
nication was read from Professor Graham, intimating a donation by 
Captain P.
King, R.N,, of South American plants collected during the 
voyages of H.M.S. Beagle, and which he had directed Mr. Brown, of 
London, to present, in his name, to the University Herbarium.
The 
286 
special thanks of the Society (whose office-bearers, together with the 
Professor of Botany, are the regularly appointed custodiers of the Uni- 
versity Herbarium) were voted to Captain King for this valuable dona- 
tion of plants, and also to Mr. Brown for his care of them, and the 
trouble he had taken in their transmission," and that a copy be sent 
to each of the gentlemen named, and to the ' Phytologist.' 
The following communications were read : â€” 
1. List of the rarer Lichens found in the neighbourhood of Oswes- 
try and Ludlow, with occasional observations, by the Rev. T.
Salwey.
This list will shortly appear in the 'Annals and Magazine of Natural 
History.' 
2. Dr. Seller read part of a paper entitled " Observations on some 
Plants obtained from the shores of Davis' Straits," With these plants 
Dr. Seller was presented by Mr. Sutherland, a student of medicine, 
who, last summer, had been a medical officer in a whaler.
There are 
about twenty-five species in all, and some of them are of considerable 
interest to the botanist.
Among them are Cochlearias, a Draba, a 
Lychnis and some other Caryophyllacete, Potentillas, Epilobiums, 
Saxifrages, an Arnica, a Ledum, a Pyrola, a Pedicularis, a Statice, a 
Polygonum, Empetrum, some Salices and Eriophorums.
All of them 
were gathered within or close upon the Arctic circle on the shores of 
Davis' Straits, adjacent to the usual course of whale-fishing vessels, 
and such collections might often be obtained by holding out a slight 
inducement to some of the many young men who go out annually in 
the same capacity with Mr. Sutherland.
The advantage of encouraging such collections in arctic latitudes, 
would be an improved knowledge of the nature of the variations to 
which certain species are liable under different circumstances of soil, 
situation and climate.
Without such a knowledge, the definitions of 
these species are likely to continue local instead of universal, that is, 
applicable to certain localities only, and such as render it difficult 
and often impossible to recognise them in new situations without 
other assistance, while the want of the same knowledge is a fruitful 
source of the unnecessary multiplication of species.
Sir William 
Hooker had some excellent observations on the extreme variations 
which some species, known in the temperate parts of Europe, undergo 
in the arctic regions, and Wahlenberg had spoken strongly of the 
errors introduced when the study of a species is confined to one lo- 
cality or latitude.
Some of the plants in this small collection afforded 
a striking illustration of the justness of their sentiments.
These variations must take place in obedience to fixed general laws.
287 
If these laws vvere discoverable, it must be by the multiplication of 
facts, such as were presented in some of the species now exhibited.
In the mean time, as the definitions of some species were nearly use- 
less under a change in the natural circumstances of their growth, the 
only course left was to adopt prolix description when varieties are met 
with of species known to undergo much alteration.
And this Dr.
Seller made his apology to the Society for giving some particulars of 
this kind in regard to a few of the species now before them.
He then proceeded to offer some particular observations on the spe- 
cimens exhibited of Cochlearia anglica, Cochlearia fenestrata, Draba 
hirta, and Epilobium latifolium, in comparison with the accounts 
given of these species by different authorities.
His observations of the same kind on some of the other species were 
deferred till next meeting.
3. 'On Datura Tatula, as a specific for relief of asthma,' by Mrs. H.
N. Ferguson, of Biel.
In this communication (which is an extract 
from a letter), the Datura Tatula is described as most efficacious in re- 
lieving asthmatical complaints, while the D.
Stramonium, the species 
commonly used, was found quite inert by the writer.
The following directions regarding the preparation of the plant may 
be deemed useful : â€” " The proper time for taking up the roots is to- 
wards the end of October, when the seed-pods are ripe ; the plants 
should be drawn from the ground, and the roots cut off, with an inch 
or two of the stalk.
They should then be freed from soil, and dried 
in the shade.
When required for use, the root should be torn into 
small shreds, and put into a clean tobacco-pipe." " The smoke causes 
no nausea, so that the most delicate lady may use it." 
Mr. Thomas M'Nab was elected an Associate of the Society.
July 10/ A, 1845.
â€” This Society held its last meeting for the session 
in the Royal Botanic Garden, on the 10th inst, â€” Dr. Douglas Macla- 
gan.
President, in the chair.
The Curator reported that several valuable additions had been made 
to the Society's collections during the present season, both in the Fo- 
reign and British departments, and that the Library had received 
valuable additions through the liberality of members and correspon- 
dents.
During the past year the Assistant-curator has been chiefly 
engaged in adding to and arranging the Society's Herbarium, and he 
has to acknowledge the valuable assistance rendered by Mr. C.
C. 
Babington of Cambridge, in reducing to order the extensive collec- 
tion of European plants.
A very valuable and instructive series of 
these has been selected for the Society, the remainder being set aside 
288 
for distribution among the members.
Much of the Assistant-curator's 
time has also been employed in the distribution of the Society's du- 
plicates, especially to foreign members.
This work is now nearly com- 
pleted, the parcels being ready for sending off.
A large collection of 
British plants, which have been accumulating for several years, is 
now being arranged, and specimens for the Society selected, in order 
to fill up.
the different sections marked out in Mi*.
Brand's plan for 
arranging that part of the Herbarium.
A detailed account of the do- 
nations to the Herbarium and Library will be published in the annual 
report.
The following communications were read : â€” 
1. Dr. Seller read the remainder of his paper, entitled ' Observations 
on some plants from the shores of Davis' Straits,' begun at the pre- 
vious meeting.
Among the species on which he particularly com- 
mented were, Stellaria scapigera, Potentilla nana, Saxifraga tricuspi- 
data, Saxifraga cernua, Saxifraga rivularis, Arnica montana, and Pe- 
dicularis hirsuta.
The Stellaria scapigera appeared to be new to the catalogue of Arc- 
tic plants.
Under the name, however, of Stellaria Edwardsii, he had 
seen, in the Society's collection, what appeared to be the same plant, 
brought also from the shores of Davis' Straits.
He had referred the 
Potentilla, of which there were several excellent specimens, to Poten- 
tilla nana, trusting a good deal to the rounded form of the outer sepals 
of the calyx, which, according to Lehmann, distinguishes this from 
all the allied species.
Of the Saxifraga tricuspidata, the specimens 
were several and well marked, agreeing perfectly with the descriptions 
of that Arctic species.
Of the Saxifraga cernua the specimens were 
also rather numerous.
As usual, most of these had no flowers ; but 
in lieu of them little bulbils in the axils of the upper leaves.
What 
is unusual, of the flowered stems one had three flowers, another two.
In all these specimens amylaceous scales covered the roots, giving 
them at first sight no slight resemblance to Saxifraga granulata.
The 
specimens of Saxifraga rivularis might be described as gigantic, being 
about three inches high ; no doubt, however, could be entertained of 
their belonging to that species, notwithstanding the defect of the 
pigmy aspect.
The plants referred by Dr. S.
to Arnica montana dif- 
fered much from the specimens of that species produced in the more 
temperate parts of Europe, and as this striking difference of aspect 
had raised some doubt at the previous meeting, he entered at some 
length on the characters by which it appeared that these specimens 
belonged to the genus Arnica.
In the specimens of Pedicularis hir- 
289 
suta, he pointed out the resemblance which the petiole and its leaflets 
bear to the snout of the saw-fish, the peculiar character of this 
species.
Dr. Seller having intimated his intention of presenting to the Soci- 
ety's Herbarium the specimens which had been the subject of this 
paper, amounting in all to about 25 S]iecies, the thanks of the meet- 
ing were unanimously voted to him for his liberality and for the trou- 
ble he had taken in determining the species.
2. On two species of DesmidiejB, by Mr. J.
Ralfs, Penzance.
Mr. James M'Nab exhibited a Pelargonium belonging to Mrs. Cap- 
tain Sinclair, Inverleith Row, bearing two distinct varieties of flowers.
The flowers, which were strikingly dissimilar, were growing on sepa- 
rate branches, no artificial means having been employed in their pro- 
duction.
Dr. Neill sent a specimen of the Tussac grass, received from the 
Falkland Islands.
Thanks were voted to Mrs. Captain Sinclair and 
Dr. Neill.â€” fF.

Mr. F.
Barham exhibited specimens of CEnanthe fistulosa ( L.)^ 
collected by him in Battersea Fields, Surrey.
They were growing 
in water, on a very moist spot, and on })asture of the usual character.
Mr. B.
observed the roots of the plants in water to be of a fibrous 
nature, in the moist soil somewhat stoloniferous, and in some more 
dry situations, tuberous, of the fusiform character.
One plant that 
grew on the spongy soil at the edge of the water, and had fibrous 
roots, possessed also large decaying tubers of last year, the result, 
Mr. B.
imagined, of the very dry summer.

Notice of the Discovery and descriptioyi of Carex montana, {L.) 
By William Mitten, Esq.
In the early part of May, 1843, I had the good fortune to gather a 
specimen of this plant in a field, by the road-side towards Eridge in 
Vol. it.
2 o 
290 
Sussex, about a mile south of Tunbvidge Wells; and not being able to 
reduce it to any described British species, I labelled it Carex mon- 
tana, from the short description in Reichenbach's 'Excursoria,' reserv- 
ing it for comparison with specimens of that plant.
A short time 
since, having occasion to show Mr. Borrer Sussex specimens of Carex 
axillaris, I fortunately showed him my C.
montana, and he most 
obligingly sent me his specimens from Hoppe, which, with the figure 
in Schkuhr, exactly corresponded with my plant.
In company with 
Mr. Borrer I visited the locality in July last, and found the plant in 
considerable quantity, but so very far past maturity, that we had great 
difficulty in obtaining specimens with entire spikelets.
Mr. Babing- 
ton has kindly favoured me with the description of this species, drawn 
up for his Manual, and which is as follows : â€” " Carex montana, L.
Fertile spikes 1 â€” 3, ovate, near together, sessile ; bracts small, mem- 
branous, the lowest with an awl-shaped point ; glumes obtuse or 
retuse mucronate ; fr.
narrowed below, oblong-obovate, trigonous, 
with a short notched beak ; nut oblong, narrowed below, with a 
pyramidal beak ; root fibrous.

Stem about a 
span long, slender.
L. narrow, glumes very dark, midrib narrowly

To the above excellent description 1 can only remark, that the root 
is remarkably stout and woody, and bears a large tuft of long and 
narrow leaves, the sheathing bases of which are deeply stained with 
purple, and connected in the same manner with netted filaments, as 
those of Carex palulosa.
Carex montana is cited in Sir .T. W.
Hooker's ' British Flora,' un- 
der C.
pilulifera, which may be accounted for by the specimens in 
the Linnean herbarium being by accident C.
pilulifera.

bach says, under C.

we learn from Wahlenberg's ' Fl. Upsal.' that our plant is found near 
that city.

Note on Cystopterls alpina, Desv., the Low Layton plant.
By 
Frederic Barham, Esq.
It being i*eported that this plant was still in existence (notwith- 
standing Sir W.
Hooker mentions the destruction of its habitat) I 
resolved to go, and if possible search closely the spot, and also its 
immediate neighbourhood.
After examining the exterior walls and 
buildings, I sent in my card, stating the purport of ray visit.
The 
291 
lady of the house told me she understood it was destroyed when the 
walls were repaired some years since, but kindly requested that I 
should examine for myself, and that should I find it.
she would have 
it preserved.
I searched all the walls around the grounds, &c., saw 
the gardener, who showed me the spot where it grew, and told me it 
had been dead some years.
By making this known you may save 
botanists a fruitless search, and the polite proprietor of the house will 
be relieved from many inquiries.
Just previous to my visit, among 
several inquirers was an eminent Professor of Botany.

Account of a Botanical Excursioti to iJie Mull of Cantyre and the 
Island of Islay^ in August, 1844.
By J.
H. Balfour, M.D.
A party, consisting of Mr. Babington, author of the 'Manual of Bri- 
tish Botany,' Dr. Parnell, author of the work on British Grasses, Mr.
John Miller, Jun., Mr. John Alexander, Mr. R.
Holden, Mr. Risk, 
Mr. Craig and myself, left Glasgow by the St. Kiavan steam-boat at 
11, A.
M., on Saturday, the lOlh of August, 1844.
There was a large 
party on board returning from the Highland Society's cattle-show.
The day was remarkably fine, and we had an excellent view of the 
beautiful scenery on the shores of the Frith of Clyde.
This in some 
measure compensated for the slow progress of our boat, which did not 
reach Carapbelton till near 9, p.
m. Campbelton is prettily situated 
in an inlet of the sea, the opening of the bay being protected by an 
island, which, however, becomes a peninsula at low water.
The island 
is composed of a porphyritic rock, which is sometimes used for mak- 
ing ornaments of various kinds.
The climate is mild, and many of 
the more delicate plants stand the winter well.
On visiting one of the 
gardens in the vicinity, under the guidance of Mr. Stewart, chamber- 
lain to His Grace the Duke of Argyll, we found myrtles, hydrangeas 
and other tender plants thriving in the open air, and we observed a 
fine Fuchsia hedge which was in full flower, and contributed in no 
small degree to ornament the garden.
On the 12th of August we left Campbelton early, and proceeded by 
the shore towards Kildalloig, and thence by the rocky and sandy 
shores of the Mull as far as Ballishear.
The cliffs are not so precipi- 
tous as those on the Galloway coast, and did not produce many rare 
plants.
The most interesting plants were found on the shore.
Some 
of the party who went inland, were by no means successful in their 
botanizing, but this may probably be attributed in some measure to 
292 
their having spent a portion of their time with Mr. Stewart, enjoying 
the pleasures of grouse-shooting.
The result of their sport was found 
to be by no means unacceptable at the end of the day's work.
Among the plants met with, I may notice Epilobium angustifoliura, 
which grew in great profusion and beauty, Hypericum Androsaeraum, 
a common plant in all our western counties, Hieracium umbellatum.
Convolvulus Soldanella and sepium, Atriplex laciniata, rosea and an- 
gustifolia, Sinapis monensis, Helosciadium nodiflorum, both in a large 
erect, and in a small creeping form, Cotyledon Umbilicus, Vicia syl- 
vatica, Lolium temulentum and Epilobium virgatum, distinguished 
from Epilobium tetragonum by its leaves being truly decurrent, the 
scions from the lower part of the stem being very slender and filiform.
It is a species of Fries, but it does not appear to me to be well marked.
In salt-marshes we picked Scirpus maritimus, Blysmus rufus, CEnan- 
the Lachenalii, a common plant in the west of Scotland and usually 
mistaken for (E.
pimpinelloides, from which it is distinguished by its 
elongated, slender, fusiform and subcylindrical tubers, gradually en- 
larging from the base of the stem, and having no distinct pedicle, as 
well as by its fruit being broader than the calyx and contracted at the 
base :* Dr. M'Donald mentioned his having found Linnaja borealis 
near Kildalloig.
At Southend the shore and the inland party met, and the latter 
were so satisfied with their day's sport and with the comfort of Mr.
Mackay's inn, as well as with the prospect of a good dinner, that they 
declined proceeding further for the night.
The movement party was 
thus reduced to three, who visited the sandy shores in the neighbour- 
hood and walked on to the lighthouse at the Mull.
On the sands at 
Southend, Convolvulus Soldanella, Raphanus maritimus, Sinapis mo- 
nensis, Sagina maritima and Reseda Luteola were foimd in profusion.
The old church at Keill and the ruins of the castle of Dunlavader at- 
tracted attention.
Near an old church-yard on the road-side, Hyos- 
cyamus niger was met with, and near Carskay, Geranium pratense 
was picked.
The rocks in the vicinity have been hollowed out into 
caves, some of them of great size and depth.
Similar caves had been 
noticed in the rocks along the shore from Campbelton to Southend, 
and one of them is designated the cave of St. Kiavan, from some le- 
gend connected with that saint.

bulky portion of which consisted of paper and boards, we crossed the 
peninsula of Kintyre or Cantyre, towards Machrihanish bay, passing 
the old church of Kilchingie.
The shores at the bay are composed of 
immense hills of sand raised by the waves of the ocean, which roll on 
the beach at times with enormous fury, causing their roar to be heard 
for many miles.
The sands are kept together and prevented from 
being blown inland by Ammophila arenaria, Carex arenaria, Triticura 
junceum, and other plants commonly known as bent or marram, the 
stems and roots of which, extending in all directions and interlacing 
together, form a sort of basket-work, and this gives a certain degree 
of firmness to the loose soil.* Plants thus contribute in some measure 
to the solidity of the land and prevent the inroads of the ocean.
In 
Norfolk there are low hills of blown sand 50 or 60 feet high, bound to- 
gether by means of grasses and sedges in the way I have mentioned.
The maritime part of Lincolnshire which lies below the sea-level is pro- 
tected in a similar manner from the invasion of the sea; and the great 
embankment in Holland owes its stability, in no small degree, to the 
plants which grow on it.
The drifting of sands often causes great de- 
vastation, covering thousands of acres of land, and destroying vegeta- 
tion.
This is seen in many parts of this county, as well as in France, 
Holland and Russia.
About the commencement of last century the 
French government took up the subject, and directed attention to the 
shifting sands in that part of France which lies near the Bay of Bis- 
cay.
A species of fir, Pinus maritimus, major, was planted, which 
now covers the sandy desert, and has effectually checked the progress 
of the sand drift.
Some interesting facts on this subject were lately 
given in the ' Gardener's Chronicle,' where it is also stated, that on 
the estate of Lord Palmerston, on the west coast of Ireland, between 
the towns of Ballyshannon and Sligo, nearly 1000 acres of land were 
covered with sand, in some cases to the depth of 100 feet or more.
About eighteen years ago, the Ammophila arenaria or bent was 
planted in these sands in large quantity, and the Pinus maritimus 
major, from Bourdeaux, and other pines, were also introduced, and by 
this means a most striking improvement has taken place.
About 800 
imperial acres have been reclaimed and converted into productive 
pasture land.
On reaching the lighthouse we were most hospitably entertained by 
* Besides the plants mentioned, Elymus aienarius, Triticum repeus, Festuca rubra 
and arenaria, Galium verum and Trifolium repens are commonly found assisting in 
fixing the sand.
294 
Mr. Noble and Mr. King, the superintendents, and everything was 
done to promote our comfort.
The country around the lighthouse is 
bare and rocky, and produces no plants of any interest.
The Mull is 
well described by MaccuUoch as a rude hilly tract, without beauty, 
even on its sea-shores.
The only interest is connected with the caves 
in the rocks to which I have alluded.
In the interior of the district 
little is to be seen, and it is chiefly on the shores that a botanist or 
geologist finds materials for research.
At the point of the Mull the 
tides flow with rapidity and turbulence, and it is by no means plea- 
sant for one who is unpractised in a sea-voyage, to beat round the 
headland in a boat.
On the morning of the 13th we examined the peculiarly rugged and 
precipitous rocks near the lighthouse, some of them rising to several 
hundred feet above the level of the sea.
Sedum Rhodiola was seen 
in abundance, but no other plants deserving notice.
After breakfast 
we walked along the upper part of the cliffs towards Largybean, where 
fine caves and stalactites occur.
The rocks, composed principally of 
micaceous slate, were comparatively unproductive, and it was chiefly 
in those parts where limestone occurred, that our researches were re- 
warded by plants in any way rare.
One of the most interesting plants 
was Dryas octopetala,* associated with Saxifraga aizoides, oppositifo- 
lia and hypnoides, Spergula subulata, and a hairy variety of Hiera- 
cium sylvaticum.
The day was very wet and misty, and not favoura- 
ble for botanical pursuits.
Nevertheless, we examined the rocks 
carefully, and reached Sossit, after being joined by the Southend 
party, about 3, p.
m., and were kindly received at Mr. M'Neill's.
We 
visited his garden, and saw a sjjecies of passion-flower in full bloom, 
which stands the winter well, also hydrangeas attaining an enormous 
size and covered with a profusion of flowers, besides Fuchsias, pelar- 
goniums, Salvia pratensis, &c.
Passing through the fishing village near 
Sossit house, we made the best of our way to our old quarters at 
Campbelton, traversing a flat country, in some parts furnishing coal, 
which is conveyed by means of a canal to the eastern shore of Cantyre.
On either side of the flat heath which extends from Machrihanish bay 
to Campbelton, there is a hilly, moorish district, which has not yet 
been brought into cultivation.
Lint (Linum usitatissimum ) is commonly cultivated in this dis- 
trict of Scotland, and in all the fields w^e observed abundance of 
* This plant is often found on limestone rocks not far from the sea-level, as at 
Ossynt in Sutherlandshire.

Cuscuta epilinum twining round the stems and destroying the crop.
The CusciUas or dodders, of which three species are natives of Bri- 
tain, are most troublesome weeds, which are not easily extirpated.
Their seeds germinate in the soil, and the plants immediately turn 
themselves round others in their neighbourhood, becoming attached 
to them parasitically by means of suckers, and ultimately losing their 
connexion with the soil.
They are very destructive to crops, and dif- 
ferent species are connected with different plants.
A species lately 
imported into Britain has done much harm to the crops of clover.
In 
the lint fields Camelina sativa was also present, probably imported 
along with the seed.
The party walked along the shore of Machrihanish bay, passing 
Ballochantry Kirk, Barr House (Mr. M'Alister), Glenacardock 
Point, Linanraere Kirk, and Killian ; and reached Taynlone in the 
evening.
The rocks were chiefly micaceous and calcareous.
At 
some places, as near Barr House, the limestone is quarried, and there 
are caves which extend to a great depth ; we entered one which ex- 
tended about 150 feet.
The road from Machrihanish bay northward, 
runs along the shore, and enables the traveller to have a fine view of the 
channel of Gigha, as well as of the islands of Jura and Islay.
The 
Paps of Jura form very conspicuous objects in the distance.
In some 
places near Balloshantrey and Killian, where the road winds among 
broken, detached rocks, the scenery is romantic and interesting.
At 
Killian there is a curious old church in ruins, apparently referrible to 
the Norman times, with round arches, coupled circular-headed win- 
dows, and peculiar doors, made with two side stones converging up- 
wards, and a flat stone on the top, resembling in some degree what is 
seen in Egyptian architecture.
Part of the old church is used as a 
burying ground by the Mac Donalds of Largy.
In the church-yard 
are many old inscriptions and some curious carvings on stone.
The 
ruins are prettily situated on the banks of a stream.
There is a vitri- 
fied fort in the neighbourhood.
At a little distance from the shore in 
this quarter, and parallel to it, there runs a ridge of old red sandstone 
rocks, and the streams coming from the higher grounds when descend- 
ing over these rocks, give rise to numerous picturesque water-falls.
The plants gathered this day were, Thalictrum minus.
Convolvulus 
Soldanella, Sinapis monensis, Ranunculus sceleratus and Scirpus Savii 
in moist places, Crambe maritima, Ligusticum Scoticum, Hypericum 
Androsffimum, Epilobium angustifolium, Vicia sylvatica in great quan- 
tity on the dry, stony beach, Pulicaria dysenterica, Vicia sativa on 
sandy shores near Taynlone, Eryngium maritimum, Steenhammera 
296 
naaritinia, or, as it is usually called in this county, the oyster plant, from 
the taste of its leaves,* Apium graveolens near Taynlone,Coninm macu-

moist places, Schoenus nigricans, Atriplex erecta in fields near Barr, 
Fumaria capreolata, Cerastium atrovirens, Pyrethrum maritimum, and 
Catabrosa aquatica assuming a remarkably stunted and creeping ap- 
pearance on moist sandy shores near Killian ; the fruit of this grass is 
very sweet, having the taste of liquorice.
Hieracium boreale was also 
picked near Linanmore Kirk and Barr, Tanacetura vulgare near Kil- 
lian, Carex vulpina near Barr, Equisetum Telmateia in many places 
between Campbelton and Taynlone.
We reached this latter place between 5 and 6 p.
m., and took up our 
quarters in a small inn, where we had considerable difficulty in getting 
accommodation, some of the party sleeping, or attempting to sleep, on 
the floor, and others on the tops of tables.
In the neighbourhood of 
the village w^e saw Potamogeton pusillus, Alisma Plantago, Samolus 
Valerandi, Catabrosa aquatica and the maritime variety already al- 
luded to, Hippuris vulgaris, Bidens cernua, Q^^nanthe Lachenalii, and 
Lolium teraulentum, or the poisonous darnel-grass.
This grass seems 
to be common in many parts of Kintyre.
All along the shore, espe- 
cially near Taynlone, we met with profusion of Alga?, and after storms 
T have no doubt that many rare species might be gathered.
Aug. 15th.
â€” This day we intended to have crossed by a ferry-boat 
to the island of Gigha, but the weather was so stormy, and a north- 
west wind was blowing with such fury, that it was deemed advisable 
to proceed along the shore to the fort of Loch Tarbet, where the 
steam-boat touches on its way to Islay.
Accordingly we proceeded 
to Clachan and Stewartfield and thence to Porthullion.
The shore is 
bare and unproductive.
Helosciadium nodiflorum, Trollius europaeus, 
Lycopus europaeus, Bidens tripartita and Papaver dubium, were the 
chief plants which we picked.
Near Porthullion we were more suc- 
cessful, having gathered Radiola millegrana, Carum verticillatum, 
Pinguicula lusitanica, Salicornia herbacea (the procumbent variety), 
Schoberia maritima, Epilobium virgatum, Eleocharis pauciflora, Myr- 
rhis odorata, Veronica scutellata, Habenaria viridis and Sedum Tele- 
phium.
About 4 p.
m, we joined the Maid of Islay steamboat, and 
after encountering a heavy swell off the northern point of Gigha, to 
the no small discomfort of some of the party, we entered the sound of 
* In America, Tragopogon porrifolius, or salsafy, receives the same name.
Its roots 
are used for soup, which is said to resemlile oyster soup.

Islay and reached Portaskaig about 9 p.
m. Here, through the kind- 
ness of Mr. G.
T. Chieve, factor for Mr. Campbell of Islay, we found 
a cart ready for our baggage, and a cai'riage-and-four to convey the 
party to Bridgend and Ealabus, our drive commencing in true High- 
land style, with a bagpipe accompaniment.
A comfortable inn at 
Bridgend received some of the party, and the remainder were kindly 
accommodated in Mr. Chieve's house at Ealabus.
Before considering the Botany of Islay I shall make a few remarks 
on the general features of Cantyre Botany.
The part of Cantyre ex- 
amined by the party did not yield many rare plants.
This may 
depend in some measure on the nature of the rocks, which are often of 
a hard, non-disintegrating and dry micaceous nature.
The most pre- 
valent rock is mica-slate.
This, along with some chlorite-slate, forms 
the greater part of Cantyre.
The old red sandstone formation occurs 
on the shore between Campbelton and Ballyshare, and is also found 
on the island of Sunda.
It likewise appears on the west coast, and 
can be traced from Campbelton by Kilchinzie to Machrihanish bay.
I have already stated, that it forms a range of cliffs at a short distance 
from the shore near Killian.
Primary limestone occurs to the north 
of Campbelton and in several places near Killian and Taynlone, as 
well as in the Largybean district, not far from the point of the Mull.
In the valley which extends from Campbelton to Sossit we meet with 
the carboniferous series of rocks.
The island of Gigha is composed 
of mica-slate.
The crops, so far as we observed, were good, and the harvest was 
early.
On the 13th of August we saw some barley cut.
Rye is cul- 
tivated in many places.
We could not detect any ergot in it.
Bear 
or big (Hordeum hexastichon) is also cultivated for the use of the 
distilleries, which are numerous in this part of the country.
Potatoes 
were excellent in the sandy and peaty soil.
Much might be done to improve the agriculture of the county by 
proper drainage, the use of the new manures, and the introduction of 
some good grasses.
Arrhenatherum avenaceum or oat-grass is a com- 
mon weed in Cantyre, and might be advantageously sown on waste 
lands as a grass of which horses and cows are fond.
Timothy grass 
(Pleum pratense) thrives well, and might be sown with benefit as a 
late grass, while Alopecurus pratensis might be sown as an early one.
These two last-named grasses are not common in Cantyre.
Holcus 
lanatus or Yorkshire fag is very common.
It is a poor grass, and 
might be replaced by others of a more nutritious quality.
Festuca 
elatior would do well in boggy places.
Avena flavescens was not met 
Vol. II.

with, but it is well fitted for dry lands.
Italian rye-grass might be 
sown with advantage, as it thrives in a mild climate.
We did not see 
this grass during our walk.
Catabrosa aquatica is a very nutritious, 
saccharine grass, which does well in wet land where draining cannot 
be carried on easily.
In Belgium, Dr. Parnell informed me, it is 
much used for fodder, and the cows there are said to give excellent 
milk and butter.
Near Taynlone this grass occupies a great extent 
of the sea-shore, and the seeds might easily be collected in large quan- 
tity.
The poisonous darnel-grass was met with among the crops in 
several places ; although it did not occur in such quantity as to give 
rise to injurious effects, so far as we could ascertain.
It ought, how- 
ever, to be extirpated, as cases of poisoning have occurred from using 
it in the preparation of bread.
Besides the part of Can tyre to which I have alluded, on our return 
from Islay, we also examined part of the shore of Loch Tarbet, near 
its northern extremity, and the neck of land between west and east 
Tarbet, which is not much more than a mile broad.
Boats are some- 
times carried across from one sea to the other ; and there is a curious 
fable mentioned by Pennant, that Donald Bane ceded the western 
Isles to Magnus, as the condition of his receiving the aid of Norway 
against the fainily of Malcolm.
By the contract, Magnus was to 
have all the islands, â€” the definition of an island being, whatever 
could be circumnavigated.
The Norwegians, it is said, caused his 
boat to be drawn across the isthmus, between the two lochs Tarbet, 
and thus included Cantyre in the bargain.
This story is considered 
as a mere fable by Macculloch.
The shores of Loch Tarbet are beautiful and picturesque, and the 
sail up the Loch in a fine day is very interesting.
The country around 
has an undulated surface, with here and there some fine woods com- 
ing down to the water's edge, and surrounding cultivated spots of va- 
rious extent.
We made a few additions to the Flora of Cantyre, on 
the shores of the Loch, by picking Milium effusum, Circaea interme- 
dia, and large specimens of Salix pentandra.
I now proceed to give an account of our excursion to the island of 
Islay, and in doing so, I shall allude only to the more interesting phane- 
rogamous plants and ferns, inasmuch as the mosses, lichens and sea- 
weeds observed by the party, possessed no attractions as regards rarity.
299 
Islay is one of the western islands of Scotland, and was at one time 
famous as the residence of MacDonald, one of the great kings of the 
isles.
The holds or castles of the MacDonalds exist on islands in 
some of the fresh-water lakes, to which T shall afterwards allude, espe- 
cially Loch Gurim and Loch Finlaggan.
The extreme length of the 
island from the Moile of Oe in the south, to Rumhail in the north, is 
about 30 miles, and its breadth from the point of Ardmore on the east 
to Sanig in the west, is upwards of 20 miles.
The superficial extent 
is about 154,000 acres, and the extent of coast is nearly 200 miles.
The form of the island is irregular, and it is deeply indented by an arm 
of the sea, called Lochindal.
It is chiefly composed of those hypo- 
gean rocks, termed by Lyell metamorphic, or altered rocks, in conse- 
quence of the supposed changes which have taken place in them since 
their deposition.
These metamorphic rocks contain few or no orga- 
nic remains, and are thus separated from the palaeozoic stratified rocks.
Clay-slate is looked upon as intermediate between the metamorphic 
and the fossiliferous strata.
The transition, primary, fossiliferous and 
grauwacke of authors, are considered as belonging to the palaeozoic 
series, being the strata which contain the fossil remains of the earliest 
formed animals.
The principal part of the island of Islay consists of 
quartz rock, with beds of clay-slate, grauwacke-slate and micaceous 
schist.
Quartz forms the high grounds of the north, and the great 
mass of the Oe district.
Gneiss occurs in some parts of the island 
and limestone in others.
Porphyritic and basaltic rocks and veins are 
met with in many places ; the basalt being often of an amygdaloidal 
nature.
Near Portaskaig a peculiar kind of conglomerate occurs.
Lead and iron are found in the island, the former being mixed with 
copper and some silver.
At Ballegrant the lead is worked, and the 
veins are tolerably productive.
In the Rhins a vein of magnetic iron 
ore occurs, which, according to Mr. Campbell, contains a small per 
centage of titanium.
A rich ore of iron is found on Sossit hill, and a 
vein of iron glance at Ballyneal.
At Stramishmore, in the Oe, there 
is a vein of impure graphite, 200 or 300 feet wide.
Mr. Campbell 
states that he has analysed this, and finds that the quantity of carbon 
varies from 9 to 60 per cent, and iron from 5 to 16 per cent.
He also 
has detected manganese in small quantity.
Dr. R.
D. Thomson has 
examined two specimens of this impure graphite, and the following 
are the results he has obtained : â€”

Near Ealabus there is a chalybeate well.
Throughout the island 
monumental stones, forts, and other antiquities occur.
The climate 
is similar to that of the other western islands, being mild and moist.
Plants which will not bear the rigour of a continental climate succeed 
well.
At Islay House many of the more delicate plants thrive in the 
open air.
The garden contains several plants which are interesting 
both in a floricultural and horticultural point of view.
At Mr. Camp- 
bell's cottage, in the south-east of the island, many fine plants were 
observed.
Rhododendrons there attained a very large size.
In Islay there is still a great extent of improvable land which might 
easily be brought into cultivation.
Much has already been done in 
the way of improvement by the spirited and enlightened proprietor, 
Mr. Campbell, and he has been ably seconded in his efforts by Mr.
Chieve, his intelligent, indefatigable, and I may justly add, hospitable 
factor.
By draining, burning, paring, and the application of lime, 
much moorish land has been rendered productive.
We saw excellent 
crops of oats on land recently reclaimed.
Mr. Campbell seems to be 
anxious to introduce all the improvements which have been suggested 
of late by agricultural chemists, and I believe that his well-directed 
efforts will soon make a great change in the aspect of the island.
The 
zeal and energy of his factor, too, are seen in the mode in which va- 
rious improvements have been carried out in the neighbourhood of Is- 
lay House, and perhaps in none more than in the formation of a road 
through a wet peat-moss, which is now in the course of being drained 
and brought under the action of the plough.
We commenced our excursion in Islay, on Friday, the 16th of Au- 
gust, by starting after breakfast for Kilchoman, which is situated in 
the south-west of the island.
We reached this place by the aid of 
conveyances provided by Mr. Chieve, and at once proceeded to exa- 
mine the sandy shores in the neighbourhood.
The sands here, as in 
Cantyre, are kept together by Ammophila arenaria, Carex arenaria, 
Triticum juuceum and other creeping grasses and sedges.
Near Kil- 
301 
choraan we found Sinapis alba, Listera ovata, Habenaria viridis and 
Gentiana Amarella, both blue and white.
In the church-yard of Kil- 
choman there are some curious grave-stones, and an old cross similar 
to one in the main street of Campbelton.
It is said, indeed, that the 
latter was originally taken from Islay.
At Kilchoman our party sepa- 
rated into two divisions, one proceeding along the shore, and the other 
going inland to examine the marshy ground in the vicinity of Loch 
Gurim or Gurm.
The shore party was, upon the whole, most success- 
ful, having picked Mentha rubra, Gentiana Amarella, Convolvulus Sol- 
danella, Malva sylvestris, Conium maculatum, Epilobium virgatum 
already noticed in the Cantyre trip, and Equisetum Telmateia of 
Ehrhart.* The latter plant is the Equisetum fluviatile of Smith, 
Hooker and Babington.
The name is derived from TEA/otaTEjoj, growing 
in mud, but we found the plant growing in moist sand.
Both fertile 
and barren stems were gathered, the former being unbranched, and 
having numerous large, deeply toothed sheaths, while the latter had 
whorled branches, were nearly smooth, and presented about thirty striae 
on the stalk.
A remarkable trailing variety of Juncus lamprocarpus, 
with regular rootings at the joints, covered the shores in profusion, 
along with Agrostis alba, var.
maritima of Babington, with a procum- 
bent rooting stem, a creeping form of Eleocharis palustris and the sea- 
shore variety of Catabrosa aquatica, already noticed in Cantyre.
This 
latter variety is minor of Babington and litloralis of Parnell.
It is 
abundant on the west coast of Scotland, on sandy shores within the 
influence of the tide.
In some places it covers patches of at least 
half an acre.
I have picked it in Bute in considerable quantity.
It 
differs from Catabrosa aquatica in its smaller growth, and in the glumes 
having mostly only one floret.
I may here remark, that the tendency 
to a trailing habit was seen in many of the plants on the shore, espe- 
cially at the points where rivulets joined the sea, and some of the 
species on this account presented an aspect very different from that 
which they assume in their usual localities.
On sandy ground in the vicinity of the shore, numerous other plants 
were seen, such as Arabis hirsuta, Gymnadenia conopsea, with its odo- 
riferous, purple blossoms, Eryngium maritimum forming spiny tufts of 
great extent, the beautiful Anagallis arvensis and tenella, Pyrethrum 
maritimum, Ligusticum scoticum, Viola lutea, with all its shades of 
purple and yellow, Thalictrum minus in a very dwarf state, Spergula 
nodosa, Arenai'ia serpyllifolia and marina, Pimpinella Saxifraga, and 
Erythraea Centaurium and linarifolia.
One of the plants noticed at-

tracted our attention particularly, inasmuch as in Scotland it is usually 
seen only in alpine districts, while here it was flourishing luxuriantly 
at the sea-level.
I allude to the Draba incana, or twisted-podded 
whitlow-grass.
No doubt in many instances in the north of Scotland 
we see alpine plants coming down to the level of the shore, as at Cape 
Wrath, in Sutherlandshire ; but the northern nature of the locality 
accounts in a great measure for the apparent anomaly.
But in the 
case of Islay, the occurrence of alpine species so low, cannot be 
accounted for in the same way.
Mr. H.
C. Watson says that Draba 
incana belongs to the alpine and upland regions of Scotland and Eng- 
land.
It is often found on alpine limestone rocks.
It is met with 
near the summits of the mountains in Wales, Westmoreland and Scot- 
land.
I have specimens from Raven-scar, Walden, and from Teesdale 
in Yorkshire.
In marshy spots near the shore we observed Hyperi- 
cum elodes, Sparganium ramosum, Gi^nanthe Lachenalii, a common 
plant in the west, an 1 Samoliis Valerandi ; while in fields Papaver 
dubium and Lamium intermedium were abundant.
The only other 
plants of interest remarked in this locality were Radiola millegrana, 
Ononis arvensis, Atriplex laciniata and rosea, Cerastium atro-vivens, 
Cakile raaritima, Trifoliiim arvense and Eleocharis pauciflora.
After a thorough examination of the sandy shore, the party proceed- 
ed towards some slaty rocks, where Sedum Rhodiola and Asplenium 
marinum were found.
Here the two divisions were to have joined, 
but by some mistake no union was effected, and in our search for each 
other a still further separation took place.
Moreover, the day which 
had been gloomy, now exhibited a most pluvious tendency, and ere 
long the rain descended in torrents, so as to damp in some measure 
the ardour of the party, and in the course of the afternoon, there was 
seen a solitary botanist wending his way through the marshes and 
bogs, with his habiliments thoroughly saturated with moisture, and his 
fingers so benumbed as scarcely to be fit for the eff"ort of pulling a 
plant, while parties of two or three, ignorant of their exact position, 
and anxious to get to comfortable quarters as soon as possible, pro- 
ceeded by various devious paths to the nearest huts for information.
All fortunately reached their destination in the course of the evening, 
their arrivals occurring at various intervals, and their adventures being 
very much diversified.
The peat-bogs which were visited in the course of the day, lie be- 
tween Kilchoman and Loch Gurinart.
They are very wet, and in 
many places quite impassable in rainy weather, so that it required con- 
siderable dexterity on the part of the traveller to avoid being immersed 
303 
up to the shoulders.
This is particularly the case with the boggy 
ground near the western extremity of Loch Gurim.
In these localities 
Scirpus lacustris, Sparganium simplex, Ranunculus aquatilis, Peplis 
Portula, Schoenus nigricans, Drosera rotundifolia, anglica and longifo- 
lia, Utricularia minor, with its elegant vesicles, Rhynchospora alba, 
Hippuris vulgaris, Scirpus Savii and setaceus, and the delicate Pin- 
guicula lusitanica were observed.
Triglochin maritimum was picked, 
along with Scirpus lacustris, about two miles from the shore.
A Salix 
resembling rosmarinifolius was also gathered.
In all, there were 320 
phanerogamous species noticed in the course of the day's walk.
The roads in this part of the island were upon the whole good, but 
they pass in some places over hilly districts.
Potatoes seemed to 
thrive well, and the fields gave excellent crops of oats.
Near Islay 
House there was a good field of wheat.
The flax in the district was 
not infested with Cuscuta.
August 17 th.
â€” The morning was very showery and unpromising, 
and in place of visiting Portnahaven as was proposed, we proceeded 
along the shore to Bowmore, and thence round Laggan Point as far as 
the mouth of the river Laggan, along the banks of which we botaniz- 
ed as far as the bridge.
The piscatorial members of the party consi- 
dered the day peculiarly favourable for enjoying the luxury of a nibble, 
but their success was not so great as they anticipated, and as usual, 
this was attributed to some fault on the part of the river and the fish.
One of the party expatiated in glowing terms on the mode in which 
he hooked a salmon, described his excitement on the occasion, and 
all the emotions which arise in the bosom of one whose fly, for the 
first time in its existence, has been honoured by the grasp of so noble 
a visitor.
But unfortunately, this splendid animal preferred living in 
its native river, even with the appendage of a hook and a broken line, 
to the pleasure of contributing to the repast of a hungry botanical 
party.
Some sea-trout, river-trout and parr were taken, but even Par- 
nell's prepared minnow, or minnow-persuader, as it was called, though 
wielded most dexterously by the Doctor himself, failed to procure a 
large supply, and we looked in vain for th.e salmon which he had pro- 
mised for dinner.
On the shore near Bowmore we met with the usual maritime plants, 
as Aster Tripolium, Plantago maritima and Coronopus, Salicomia 
herbacea (the erect form), and Juncus compressus.
Great quantities 
of Zostera marina had been thrown on the shore by the waves, and 
were used as manure by the farmers along with sea-weeds.
This plant 
has been employed for various purposes ; among others it has been 
304 
reconimendecl as a stuffiing for beds and cusliions.
At Laggan Point 
fine cliffs occur, but they are not productive, being chiefly covered with 
Pyrethrum maritimum, Arenaria maritima, Cochlearia officinalis and 
some grasses.
Beyond this point the shore becomes sandy and is cover- 
ed with bent.
A little way inland boggy ground occurs, in which the 
three species of Drosera, Rhynchospora alba, Utricularia minor, Meny- 
anthes trifoliata and other marshy plants are found.
This boggy ground, 
like that near Kilchoman, was in many places very wet, and resembled, 
in that respect, the bogs which occur in Ireland, such as those of Cun- 
nemara, in Galway.
The peat is of excellent quality, and is used 
extensively for fuel.
Much might be done to improve this peaty soil by paring, burning, 
draining and the admixture of sand, which is abundant in the neigh- 
bourhood.
In cases where draining could not be easily accomplished 
at once from the nature of the level, the system of colmation, as pur- 
sued in Italy, might be practised, so as to deposit soil on the surface 
of the peat, and thus raise its level so as to enable draining to be af- 
terwards undertaken with success.* The introduction of Dactylis 
cffispitosa, or tussac grass, might be successful in this situation, both 
from the nature of the climate and the proximity to the sea.
Should 
this grass be introduced into the country, the peaty soil on the west- 
ern islands of Scotland would probably be that best fitted for its 
growth.
In this way the waste lands of these localities might be made, 
without preparation, to afford excellent pasture, as well as protection 
to cattle.
This grass was noticed in the Falkland Islands during the 
recent Antarctic Expedition.
A short account of it was published by 
Sir William Hookerf.
The plant is called tussack or tussac grass, 
from the lower part of its culms forming a tuft or tussack.
The stems 
rise to the height of four or six feet, and the leaves hang down all 
round.
It is perennial, and produces large leaves and an enormous 
quantity of herbage, which is saccharine and nutritious.
The cattle 
in the Falkland Islands are remarkably fond of it.
The plant thrives 
best in a wet peaty soil, in insular situations where the spray of the

nificamento et sul metodo cou cui vi si Eseguiscono le Colmate, di G.

The system of colmation was fully explained by Professor Gordon atone of the 
late conversational meetings, and its application to such localities as Lochan Moss, near 
Dumfries was pointed out by Mr. Smith.

sea dashes over it.
Judging from the soil and climate in which it 
grows, there is every reason to believe that it might be most advanta- 
geously sown on the western islands of Scotland.
Seeds have been 
sent home to this country, but only a few of them have germinated.
Those sent to the Glasgow garden have not sprouted.
Besides the 
tussac, Festuca i\.lopecurus of D'Urville, or Arundo Alopecurus of 
Gaudichaud also deserves to be noticed as an important Falkland 
Island grass found in peat-bogs.
The climate of Islay is well adapted for oats, and much of the peaty 
soil might be rendered highly productive.
Wheat also thrives in 
some places, but this crop probably requires a warmer summer than 
occurs in the island in general.
On the sandy shores at Laggan we found Convolvulus Soldanella, 
and in the fields Lamium intermedium and Fumaria capreolata ; while 
the banks of the river furnished luxuriant specimens of Hieracium 
umbellatum, sylvaticum and boreale.
The last mentioned species 
has been usually regarded as a form of H.
sabaudum, and is figured 
as such in English Botany.
It is distinguished by its upper leaves 
being sessile with a round base, not with a cordate clasping base as 
in sabaudum : the involucral scales are appressed in three regular 
vows, and uniform in colour.
In the woods near Ealabus and Islay House, which we examined 
at different times, we found a number of plants which deserve at- 
tention, such as Aquilegia vulgaris, Hesperis matronalis, Valeriana 
pyrenaica.
Campanula latifolia, Epilobium angustifolium.
Polygonum 
Bistorta, Prunus Padus, Lysimachia nemorum, Ruscus aculeatus, Ca- 
rex remota and Scolopendrium vulgare.
Some of these species, how- 
ever, have undoubtedly escaped from the garden.
Betula alba and 
glutinosa were also seen.
The latter is looked upon by most botanists 
as a mere variety of the former, but Mr. Babington thinks that he has 
found a marked character in the stipules, which in B.
glutinosa are 
rolled back, while in B.
alba they are circinate.
The form of the fruit, 
he also thinks, is diflFerent in the two cases.
In a pond near Ealabus 
grow Lycopus europaeus, Potamogeton natans and Nymphaea alba.
On making a transverse section of the petiole of the Nymphaea, it was 
observed that the large tubes had hairs in their interior, which gene- 
rally came off in threes.
Again, in making a similar section of the 
peduncle, or flower stalk, we noticed generally four or five large tubes 
in the centre and smaller ones around, but in none of them could any 
hairs be detected.
These tubes in the stalks of the flower and leaf 
appear to contain air for the purjiose of floating the various parts of 
306 
the plant.* Carex vesicaria and Equisetura limosiim, both in an iin- 
branched and branched state, were picked at Loch Skiros.
On examining some of the Carices and grasses, it was found that 
the rule in regard to the solid stem in the former and the hollow stem 
in the latter was not universal.
Thus Carex remota and ovalis had 
distinctly hollow stems, while Ammophila arundinacea had a solid 
stem.
This grass is said by Dr. Parnell to be the only British one 
with a stem always completely solid.f It also differs from other 
grasses in not having a striated stem.
It may also be remarked here, 
that in the Umbellifera3 the character founded on the fistulose stem 
does not invariably hold good, for on the same root solid and fistulose 
stems will be occasionally found.
Many of the grasses in Islay displayed much of the ergot, or that 
disease which is common in rye, and which is an altered state of the 
ovary caused by the attack of a fungus, Ergotsetia abortifaciens of 
Quekett.
This plant produces sporules, which communicate the 
disease to healthy grain, either by being directly applied, or by being 
taken up from the soil.
Mr. Quekett has produced the disease arti- 
ficially by watering healthy plants of rye with water containing the 
sporules.
Proper draining will probably prevent the attack of ergot.
Ergot injures the quality of the flour, and cases are detailed in which 
the use of diseased rye has caused dry gangrene.
The disease is not, 
however, peculiar to rye ; it occurs in many grasses.
Professor 
Henslow has observed it in wheat in Suffolk, and in the district in 
which he saw it, it is stated, that about a century ago, several cases 
of poisoning occurred from diseased wheat.
Our party observed 
ergot in considerable quantity on Anthoxanthum odoratum, and on 
Phalaris arundinacea.
The former grass is very abundant in many 
parts of the island, and is well deserving of cultivation.
Besides the 
ergot, we noticed the disease in oats caused by a species of Uredo, 
and commonly called smut.
In many fields the disease was very pre- 
valent.
It is said to be prevented by steeping the grain in stale urine 
and afterwards sifting lime on it.
A solution of salt and a weak solu- 
tion of sulphate of copper have also been employed.
August 19th.
â€”The day was very unpromising, and thick mist and 
* On examining the peduncle of Nymphasa alba lately, in Bute, I detected hairs 
in its tubes as well as in those of the petiole.
The same thing was seen in the pe- 
duncles and petioles of Nuphar lutea.
In the latter plant, the air-tubes in the petiole 
were larger than those in the peduncle, and displayed the hairs most distinctly.
f See Dr. Parnell's able work on British Grasses.
Broraus patulus and some other 
foreign grasses have also solid stems, and Mr. Gorrie has noticed the same occurrence 
in some varieties of wheat.
307 
rain set in about 7 o'clock, a.
m. Nevertheless, four of the party 
started in a conveyance for Portnahaven, while the rest went to Bal- 
lagrant Loch, to fish.
The south-western shores of the island, as far 
as Portnahaven or the Rhins are low, gravelly, and occasionally 
rocky, and consist chiefly of clay-slate, with greywacke slate in 
alternate beds.
Gneiss is met with in some parts of the shore, espe- 
cially between Octofad and the point of the Rhins or Rinus.
These 
shores produced few plants of interest.
Geranium pratense was no- 
ticed near Port Charlotte, and in a neglected garden at the same 
place we observed profusion of Papaver somniferum, of a pink colour, 
with dark spots at the base of the petals, similar to what occurs in 
Papaver Argemone.
The same variety was picked by Dr. Parnell at 
Ballagrant.
At Portnahaven there is a lighthouse on an island close 
to the shore, and there are other islands in the neighbourhood.
The 
tides in this quarter, more particularly at the point of the Rinns, are 
very violent and rapid, and it is interesting to notice the agitation 
which is caused even by a moderate degree of wind.
On arriving at 
Portnahaven the weather was so bad and the rain so heavy, that two 
of the party did not choose to quit the conveyance, and accordingly 
they proceeded directly to Kilchearan, and there enjoyed the hospita- 
lity of Mr. Ralston, until the other two botanists met them.
Proceeding along the western shore of the Rinns from Portnahaven, 
we encounter a very rugged and rocky coast, intersected by numerous 
indentations, and broken up by narrow ravines, into which the sea 
enters with' great violence.
Fine caves, and gigantic natural arches 
occur in many places.
The prevailing rocks are clay-slate and grey- 
wacke, with occasional trap dykes of considerable extent.
In some 
places, as at Sosset Hill, we meet with a peculiar kind of conglome- 
rate.
Near Sosset, which is a fishing village, the cliffs are remarkably 
fine, attaining a height of many hundred feet, and covered with innu- 
merable sea-fowl.
In this quarter there are the remains of a fort.
The most interesting plants seen on the cliffs were Sedum Rhodiola, 
Pyrethrum maritimum, in some cases with a singular flattened or 
fasciated stem, caused apparently by the union of several stalks, Li- 
gusticum scoticum, Carex extensa, Spergula subulata and Inula 
dysenterica.
The cliffs are now and then interrupted by sandy shores 
covered with bent, and there Convolvulus Soldanella and Equisetum 
Telmateia were found, along with Galium verum curiously altered by 
the attacks of insects.
At Kilchearan, where a slate-quarry is worked, we joined the rain- 
dreading botanists, whom we found comfortably accommodated in 
the house of Mr. Ralston, the tenant of the farm in this quarter, who 
308 
kindly entertained the whole party, Mr. Ralston seems to be an 
intelligent farmer, and has contributed to the improvement of the 
agriculture of this district.
He pointed out to us a field of from twenty 
to thirty acres, beaiing an excellent crop of wheat.
He has intro- 
duced Cheviot sheep with profit, and in his dairy he has the Ayrshire 
breed of cows, to the excellence of the produce of which, some of the 
party can bear testimony.
Returning by the shore to Ealabus, we did not observe any plants 
of peculiar interest.
On our return, we had the pleasure of meeting 
Mr. Christison, who had been sent to this county by the Norwegian 
government for the purpose of getting information as to agriculture.
Foreign governments, in the encouragement which they thus give to 
science, set an excellent example to Britain.
August 20th.
â€” This day the botanical section proceeded first by 
the shore and then across the island to Loch Gruinart, examining the 
southern shore of the Loch, and going as far as Ardnave and the point 
of the Nave.
The rest of the party indulged their fishing propensities 
by visiting the river Laggan.
The day was showery, but upon the 
whole favourable.
In the salt-marshes near Islay House many common sea-plants were 
found, as Salicornia herbacea, Glaux maritima, Aster Tripolium and 
Poa maritima.
In a ditch near Gruinart, Rumex Hydrolapathum or 
great water-dock was picked, a species well distinguished by its lan- 
ceolate acute leaves, tapering below into a petiole, which is flat above, 
and by the enlarged ovato-triangular divisions of its perianth nearly 
all with tubercles.
It was formerly described by botanists as Rumex 
aquations, a distinct species, with broader leaves, not tapering, and 
non-tubercled fruit, hence called grainless dock.
R. Hydrolapa- 
thum is rare in Scotland, although it is found in many places in 
England.
Mr. Stewart Murray observed the plant in ditches near 
Meikleoun, in Perthshire, and I have a specimen from the station, 
picked by Mr. Gorrie.
Hopkirk mentions the plant as growing near 
Old Kilpatrick, on the Clyde, but I have not been able to see it 
in that locality.
I have gathered the plant abundantly near Oxford 
and in other parts of England, but I never before picked it in Scotland.
The shore on the south side of Loch Gruinart is partly gravelly 
and partly sandy.
The sand occurs near the Nave, and on the west 
shore exposed to the Atlantic.
The dunes of sand in this quarter 
attain a great elevation, and are, as usual, kept together by gi'asses 
and sedges.
In lint fields near Gruinart, Camelina sativa was observ- 
ed, and on the sandy shores Draba incana, Gentiana campestris and 
309 
Amarella and Arabis hirsuta.
Scutellaria galericnlata grew profusely 
among the pebbles on the shore, Papaver Argeraone and dubium in 
sandy fields, and Juncus maritimus in salt marshes : in moist places 
near the loch, Callitriche verna and pedunculata, Potamogeton pusil- 
lus and crispus, Helosciadium inundatum, Myriophyllum spicatum 
and Scirpus glaucus.
Loch Gruinart has a sandy bottom, and it is nearly emptied when 
the tide is low.
Sand-banks exist in many places, and on these we 
saw numerous seals sporting in the sun.
The tide flows here with 
great rapidity.
A bar of sand extends across the mouth of the Loch, 
and at its head there is an alluvial plain.
The shores to the south- 
west of the point of the Nave are rocky and inhospitable, and exhibit 
reefs of various extent.
The cliffs become more elevated as we pro- 
ceed south and caves occur in many places.
The interior of the 
island in the neighbourhood of Loch Gruinart is composed of boggy 
and peaty soil, furnishing such plants as Droseras, Rhynchospora alba 
and Utricularia minor.
On Nave Island Crambe maritima is said to 
grow.
In this part of the island there are the ruins of the old church of 
Kilnave.
It is a building of considerable antiquity, and seems to 
have had only two windows, the arches of which are very peculiar.
In the church-yard there is an old stone cross, which differs in the 
curvature of the cross portion from those seen at Campbelton and in 
lona.
August 21st.
â€” Early this moraing I started for Ballytarson, and 
gathered Anthemis nobilis in abundance.
This plant is by no means 
common in Scotland.
In Islay it occurs in several places, and always 
associated with limestone rock.
After breakfast we prepared for a 
visit to the south-eastern district of the island, but the stormy nature 
of the weather caused no small alarm to some of the party, and the 
number of zealous botanists willing to encounter a long and wet walk 
was found to be very small.
One of the party preferred botanizing 
near Ealabus, within sound of the dinner-bell.
Undismayed by the 
desertion of friends, our little band proceeded in one of Mr. Chieve's 
conveyances as far as Kintra, at the southern extremity of Laggan 
sands, and thence walked towards the Oe. On the sands the chief 
plants were Convolvulus Soldanella, Poa pratensis var.
arenaria and 
Kceleria cristata.
On none of the sands in the island did we observe 
Sinapis monensis, a plant which is common in many of the sandy 
shores on the west coast.
From Laggan sands we proceeded along the rocks to Slochd Mhaol 
310 
torrai* where splendid precipices and caves are seen.
Tlie rocks in 
this district, and indeed all the way from Islay House to the Mull of 
the Oe, consist of alternations of a bluish quartz rock, clay-slate and 
occasional trap dykes and veins.
Some of the rocks are bent and 
contorted in a remarkable manner, and others are hollowed out into 
enormous caves, some of which extend a great vray inland and open 
at the distance of several hundred feet from the shore.
Some of the 
rocks stand out prominently in the sea, with rugged and peaked sum- 
mits.
One of these is called " Saighdair Ruadh," or red soldier rock, 
from its colour.
It is 150 or 200 feet high, and presents a very re- 
markable aspect.
There are often very narrow chasms or rents in the 
rocks, into which the waves of the ocean are rolled with great force.
Land-slips have also occurred in some places.
The rocks, although 
interesting in their appearance, are by no means productive.
Beta 
maritima grows in considerable quantity on some of the cliffs, and 
Sedum Rhodiola and Pyrethrum maritimum abound.
The other 
plants worthy of notice were Listera ovata, Luzula pilosa, Lastraea 
Oreopteris, Ligusticum scoticum, Lycopodium selaginoides, Hyperi- 
cum humifusum and Androsa^mum, Rubus saxatilis and Saxifraga 
aizoides.
The last mentioned plant extends from nearly the sea-level 
to a considerable elevation on the hills.
After examining the rocks in the Oe or Oa, a parliamentary parish, 
we proceeded to the Moile or Mull of Islay, passing lower Killian, 
where oddly twisted rocks are seen.
The Moile is a line cliff or pro- 
montory projecting into the sea, forming the south-eastern extremity 
of Islay, and surrounded by cliffs of a reddish colour, in which the 
alternations of quartz rock and clay-slate are well seen.
On one of 
these rocks there are the remains of an old fort, called Dunad or Dun 
Athad, which seems to have been a place of great strength in former 
times.
The rock on which it is situated projects towards the sea, is 
bounded on three sides by perpendicular cliffs, and is connected with 
the land only by a narrow isthmus wnth precipices on each side.
In 
some of the rocks near the fort remarkable caves and arches are seen.
After examining the fort we proceeded through upper Killian parish 
towards Port Ellen.
We passed Kinnabus and Assabus Loch, and 
at Cragabus we saw the remains of an old church-yard, marked by 
large stones placed so as to enclose graves, similar to some which 
* This means the gulf of Mhaol torrai, a person concerning whom there is some 
tradition.
He is said to have been killed at the place in endeavouring to leap across 
one of the chasms on horseback.
311 
occur near Lag, in the island of Arran.
The party reached Port Ellen 
about Sj p.
M., after a long and fatiguing walk.
At this port a light- 
house has been erected by Mr. Campbell.
August, 22nd.
â€” Leaving Port Ellen at 7, a.
m., we went along the 
shore to Ardinisteil, where we breakfasted with Mr. Stein.
On our 
way we picked Galeopsis versicolor and Convolvulus sepium.
After 
breakfast we directed our course towards Loch Knook or Knook-hill, 
where Mr. Campbell has a summer residence, called Ardimersay cot- 
tage.
Here there is a considerable extent of thriving plantations, and 
we spent some hours in the examination of them.
The chief plants 
which rewarded our exertions were, Circaea intermedia, Carex lasvi- 
gata, Hymenophyllum Wilsoni, Polypodium Phegopteris, Cardamine 
sylvatica and Prunus Cerasus.
On the rocks in the neighbourhood 
were seen Milium effusum, Tanacetum vulgare and Inula Helenium, 
evidently an escape from an old garden.
Near the cottage there is 
an old fort, now in ruins, called Dun Naomhaig, and pronounced Du- 
navaig, remarkable as being the last held by the MacDonalds.
It 
was taken by the Campbells, who, it is said, resorted to the method 
of cutting the water-pipes, which were conveyed under the sea in the 
bay, and thus causing a surrender.
The rock of the fort seems to be 
impregnable on all sides but that next the land.
In the vicinity of 
the cottage a place is shown which is said to be the grave of the 
Princess Isla.
After partaking of refreshment kindly supplied by the housekeeper 
at the cottage, we walked partly by the shore and partly inland as far 
as Kildalton, where porphyritic rocks present themselves.
Here a 
fine old church is seen in ruins.
It had two windows in the east end 
and two at each side, with two doors.
Two stone crosses differing 
slightly in character are seen, one in the church -yard surrounding 
the chapel, and the other at a little distance from it.
Some curious 
old grave-stones occur.
Nettles and Anthriscus sylvestris now grow 
in profusion within the precincts of the chapel ; and the procumbent 
variety of the common juniper on its walls.
The various species of 
nettle seem to follow the footsteps of man, and delight to grow in 
places where nitrate of lime is produced.
" At the wall's base the fiery nettle springs 
With fruit globose and fierce with poisoned stings." 
In boggy places in the vicinity of the old chapel, we found Helo- 
sciadium nodiflorum, Hypericum elodes, Carex remota and filiforrais.
312 
This part of the island is separated from the district near Islay House 
by a lofty range of hills, some of them attaining an elevation of 1500 
or 2000 feet, and composed chiefly of quartz rock.
We ascended 
one of them called Ben Vigors, or Ben Bhiggars, and found it by no 
means productive.
The princiijal plants collected were Gnaphalium 
dioicum, Lycopodium Selago, Arctostaphylos Uva-ursi, Carex rigida, 
Armeria maritima var.
alptna, Juniperus communis var.
nana.
The 
occurrence of Arctostaphylos would probably indicate an elevation of 
at least 2000 feet, corresponding with the sub-alpine region of Mr.
Watson.
On reaching the summit of the hill we were involved in mist 
and rain, and the guide who accompanied us lost his way, and after 
wandering for an hour or two landed us in the valley whence we had 
ascended.
Fortunately he knew the direction which our place of des- 
tination bore to the valley and accordingly we followed our compass 
and crossed the hills in a very thick mist, amidst the fears and doubts 
of our guide as to the correctness of our procedure.
Our anxiety as 
to the result of our exploration made us forget all the discomfort of a 
thorough drenching, and one of the party who had been complaining 
sadly of fatigue now walked on most manfully.
After reaching the 
summit of the range of hills (probably the summit of Gloan Leor), we 
descended, not without doubts as to the result.
At this time a slight 
clearance took place in the mist, and we descried some green patches 
of verdure which seemed to indicate a limestone district.
We knew 
that this was the geological nature of the district which we wished to 
reach, and our hopes of extrication from our difficulties brightened 
considerably.
We now proceeded on our descent with increased vi- 
gour and alacrity, and reached AUaladh, where some oat-cakes and 
milk from one of the cottagers were most thankfully received, and ere 
long we had the pleasure of finding ourselves at Catladale, where a 
conveyance was waiting to convey us to Ealabus.
This adventure 
shows, in a certain degree, the importance of knowing the geology of 
a district and the kind of vegetation which is connected with particu- 
lar rocks.
The limestone district to which I have alluded is extensive.
It crosses from Laggan to Ardmore point and extends to the north- 
east of Islay House.
In some places the water has hollowed out a 
passage for itself through the rocks, and in one instance we observed 
the rivulet disappear under ground for several hundred feet.
Near 
Catladale the ruins of a fort are seen, called Nose-bridge fort.
To be continued.

Observations on Mr. MarshaWs Experiments with the Seeds of the 
Cowslip and 0:vlip.
By Hewett C.
Watson, Esq., F.L.S.
Will Mr. Marshall allow me to call upon him for some additional 
explanation of his experiments in raising- cowslips and oxlips fiom 
seeds, as recorded in the August number of the ' Phytologist' (Phytol.
ii.
285) } He apparently draws a " conclusion " from those experi- 
ments, which is not supported by the facts stated.
Mr. Marshall writes that he raised many plants from the seeds of 
one wild cowslip, which had been transplanted into his garden ; the 
result being, that " every individual of them was a mere cowslip, in 
all respects like its parent, not one of the sixty individuals having 
sported either in form or colour." If this is to be understood literally 
as expressed, it is such a result as I have scarce ever met with in the 
case of any species of plant.
But if it means, as is more likely, that 
the sixty plants differed only to the extent (not inconsiderable) to 
which wild cowslips differ among themselves, then the result is close- 
ly in accordance with those which have fallen under my own observa- 
tions upon the seedlings of Primula veris.
Still, I do not see how or 
why the fact of a cowslip producing only cowslips, on one occasion, 
should "lead to the conclusion, that there must have been ' a hitch ' 
somewhere in the recorded experiments " .
. " of Mr. Watson ; " 
since my experiment was made with seeds of an oxlip-variety of the 
Primula vulgaris, not with those of a cowslip.
The tendency to vary 
again, as far as my experience goes, is much greater with the progeny 
of a variety, than with that of a typical example of a genus.
Mr. Marshall afterwards mentions that he sowed " a few seeds of 
the oxlip, with a similar result." Without knowing what oxlip is in- 
tended, I cannot say whether this other experiment bears any more 
closely upon that which I have recently recorded in the 'Phytologist' 
(Phytol.
ii.
217).
Was it Jacquin's Primula elatior.?
â€” or the large-flow- 
ered and flat-limbed variety of Primula veris ?
â€” or the common um- 
bellate variety of Primula vulgaris .â€¢' â€” or that cowslip-looking variety 
of the last, which (for sake of distinction) I have usually designated 
the " Claygate oxlip," and which is the Primula vulgaris, var.
inter- 
media of the London Catalogue.
These various oxlips (except the 
large- flowered P.
veris) must now be familiar to many readers of the 
' Phy tologist,' by the specimens distributed through the Botanical So- 
ciety of London.
It has already been stated in the ' Phytologist,' 
that Jacquin's Primula elatior comes up true from seeds sown in the 
garden (Phytol.
i. 975).
But I should now be greatly surprised to find 
Vol. II.
2 Q 
314 
numerous seedlings of any umbellate variety of P.
vulgaris coming 
into flower without variation from the parent form.
As our native 
species and varieties of Primula were not sufficiently understood at 
the date of Professor Henslow's experiments, some doubt will una- 
voidably arise about it ; and perhaps we should take the result as a 
suggestion rather than a proof.

Some words on " Species-making.'" By Hewett C.
Watson, 
Esq., F.L.S.
In the August ' Phytologist,' Mr. Lees has hastily taken to himself 
my incidental mention of the genus Rubus, among others, in example 
of the species-making taste now in vogue ; and he has indited half-a- 
dozen pages of verbal vengeance against me, under the inspirations 
of the cap which he has supposed to fit his ovfn head (Phytol.
ii.
263).
I can assure Mr. Lees, however, that there was no intention of allud- 
ing to him individually by the example ; and that he is perfectly at 
liberty to read Salix, Poa, or any other be-species-ed genus, instead 
of Rubus, as an illustration of the remark, which had a general appli- 
cation to the practice of species-making on slight grounds, without 
reference to any particular individual whose taste may lead him to 
ioin the section of species-makers.
I do not recollect that I ever 
publicly connected the name of Mr. Lees with any i-emark which could 
be fairly construed into the expression of a feeling at variance with 
those of good will and respect towards that gentleman.
On some 
occasions, in epistolary or oral communications with other botanists, 
I have found it necessary to give them a hint against relying too im- 
plicitly on his botanical exactness, and some such hint may have been 
repeated to him.
But I have not done this on slight grounds.
The immediate object of this paper, is to rescue my own printed 
remarks from the erroneous construction put upon them by Mr. Lees, 
and likely to be adopted by readers equally " cursory " as the thinker 
in the ' Phytologist.' It is not to " the observation of minute differ- 
ences in plants " that I ever objected, but to the hasty practice of 
species-making, as soon as such differences are observed, although 
there may exist little or no other reason for supposing the plants to 
be genuine species.
Mr. Lees adroitly enough turns the attention of 
his readers from this essential distinction, by a stratagem which would 
315 
look more available in a legal pleader than in a writer on science.
After imperfectly quoting my words " about the frivolous attempts at 
species-making," he puts an interrogation, â€” " But why this objection 
to ' species-making,' â€” or rather the observation of minute differences 
in plants ?
" And by thus connecting together two things so totally 
different, he is then enabled to hold me forth to his readers in the 
character of one who objects to the observation of minute differences, 
and who decries the attentive examination of species !
This is unjust towards me, individually, and not much less so to- 
wards those readers whose judgment would be distorted by such a 
strategic connexion of things quite dissimilar.
There may be some 
egotism in the illustration, but I will appeal to my own practice in 
proof of the distinction.
During several years past 1 have been in 
the habit of collecting examples of variation in plants from every 
available source, and several of these have been already put on record 
in books, or distributed as specimens for the herbaria ; â€” but nobody 
has yet charged me with being one of the species-makers.
The study 
of varieties, and the love of species-making, are thus completely dis- 
severed in practice ; and therefore the strongest objection expressed 
against the one custom, cannot justly be construed into any censure 
of the other.
I shall still venture to repeat my own conviction, that science is 
much impeded by the prevalent habit of raising varieties to the rank 
of species (as it is expressed), without first taking the pains to ascer- 
tain whether they merge into known species during cultivation or 
through intermediate examples.
Things which are obscure and un- 
certain are thus equalized with those which are clear and certain, 
error becomes largely commingled with truth, and the difficulties of 
scientific definition are greatly increased.
On the contrary, I conceive that experiments have a decided ten- 
dency to promote science, by removing error, and by substituting 
certainty in place of obscurity.
Suppose, for instance, I find a wild 
plant which is distinguishable from known species by some peculia- 
rity which could readily be described after the manner of drawing a 
specific character.
Two courses are open.
I may at once invent a 
specific name, write a specific character, and publish the plant as a 
new species.
Or, I may first diligently seek for other examples which 
will suffice to connect it with a known species, observe it when culti- 
vated under different conditions of soil, and raise it afresh from seeds.
The species-maker takes the former course ; while the experimenter 
takes the latter â€” at least in the first instance.
I do not think that 
316 
the species-maker would here be manifesting the greatest love of truth, 
or the smallest zest for notoriety.

September 5, 1845.
â€” J.
E. Gray, Esq., F.R.S.
&c., President, in 
the chair.
The Secretary announced that British plants had been re- 
ceived from Dr. Bossey, Dr. Wood, Dr. Dewar, Dr. Taylor, Mrs. F.
Russell, Mr. S.
Hailstone, Mr. Freeman, the Rev. W.
S. Hore and 
the Rev. C.
A. Johns.
Mr. William Mitten presented a specimen of a species of Carex 
[described in the present number of the 'Phytologist' under the name 
of Carex montana, Z.] but owing to the imperfect condition of the one 
specimen before the Society, in which the flower-stems had withered, 
without perfecting iruit, it could not be certainly referred to the Carex 
montana of continental authors.
The specimen was collected by Mr.
M. in July last, " in the county of Sussex, about a mile south of Tun- 
bridge Wells, in the way to Eridge." 
Read, a communication from Mr. T.
Bentall, On the Luzula con- 
gesta of British authors, in which Mr. B.
supported the views set 
318 
forth in Koch's Synopsis, and repeated in Babington's Manual, where 
the plant is described under the specific name of Luzula multiflora.
Mr. Bentall's remarks run as follows : â€” 
" I beg to lay before the Botanical Society the enclosed specimens 
of Luzula multiflora (Babington's Manual), which, after a close exa- 
mination, I am disposed to consider as a perfectly distinct species, 
although often confounded with Luzula campestris.
This error has 
probably arisen from the great variation of the inflorescence in differ- 
ent specimens.
The flowers are often collected into an almost orbi- 
cular head, when it becomes the Luzula campestris, /3.
congesta, of 
Hooker and others ; at other times they form a panicle of numerous 
sessile and stalked clusters, when it bears a strong resemblance to 
the common form of Luzula campestris, and is often mistaken for it.
" There appears to be a decided and strongly marked difference in 
the form of the seeds of the two plants, those of multiflora being usu- 
ally nearly twice as long as broad, whilst those of campestris are 
nearly globular ; the basal appendage with which they are furnished 
I find to be much more conspicuous in the latter than in the former.
The character pointed out by Mr, Babington as existing in the fila- 
ments, I believe to be constant.
Luzula multiflora generally inhabits 
woods and shady places, being seldom found in dry open pastures, in 
which campestris usually abounds." â€” G.

BOTANICAL SOCIETY OF GLASGOW.
May 27, 1845.
â€” The Society met in the College, Dr. Balfour, the 
President, in the chair.
Dr. Balfour exhibited a spatha of Areca oleracea, upwards of four 
feet in length ; also specimens of the stem of the guaiac tree, rose- 
w^ood tree, and Moreton-bay pine ; specimens of American ferns, be- 
longing to the section Osmundacea?
; the fruit of Cocos lapidea, with 
the concrete oil obtained from it ; a specimen of Cycas revoluta, with 
the seeds developed on the peculiarly altered leaves ; and hazel-nuts, 
presented to him by Mr. Kidley, which had been found in a peat-moss 
under sand, the pericarp being soft and natural, while the kernel was 
hardened by a siliceous deposit.
Dr. B.
then gave an account of a botanical trip to Castlecarey, 
Denny, the banks of the Carron and Falkirk, on the 24th of May.
Among the more interesting plants gathered were Adoxa moschatel- 
lina, Viola lutea both yellow and blue, Paris quadri folia, Stellaria 
nemorum, Melica nutans, Carduus heterophyllus with entire and pin- 
319 
natifid leaves on the same stem, Prunus Padus, Polj'podium Dryop- 
teris, Trollius emopoeus, Potentilla Fragariastruin, Ranunculus auri- 
comus, Myrrhis odorata, Geranium sylvaticum, Orchis mascula, &c.
He also gave an account of exem'sions to Arran on the 4th and 5th of 
July, 1844 ; and to Toward-point, and the shore between that and 
Dunoun.
The discovery of Carex vesicaria and Thalictrum flavum 
in the latter quarter was particularly noticed.
Dr. Balfour laid on the table Mr. Keddie's prize herbarium, which 
Mr. K.
kindly proposed to incorporate with the Society's collection, 
on the condition that it is to be accessible, under proper regulations, 
to the students of the botanical class in the University.
June 24, 1845.
â€” The President in the chair.
Dr. Balfour exhibited growing specimens of Cypi'ipedium pubes- 
cens and spectabile, from the Botanic Garden.
The specimens had 
been transmitted by Dr. Gavin Watson, of Philadelphia.
Dr. B.
also 
gave a description of the plants belonging to the section Cypripedieae 
of the natural order Orchidacese, and explained the structural charac- 
ters.
The remarks were illustrated by dried specimens from North 
America, Siberia, Europe, Brazil and Nepaul.
Of twenty species of 
Cypripedium mentioned by Steudel, one is found in Britain and in 
other parts of Europe, four in Siberia, six in North America, four 
in Brazil, three in Nepaul, one in Japan and one in the Malay 
Archipelago.
Dr. Balfour next exhibited a large specimen of the root of Calotro- 
pis gigantea, which had been sent from Scinde, by Lieut.
Maclagan, 
of the Engineers.
The plant belongs to the natural order Asclepia- 
daceae, and receives the name of the Mudar or Madar plant.
It is 
common in India, where it attains a large size.
Specimens of the 
plant were exhibited.
The bark of the root furnishes the article of 
Materia Medica called Mudar, which is used in various affections of 
the skin, and in rheumatism as a diaphoretic.
The juice of the plant 
is acrid and milky ; and a principle called Mudarrin was detected by 
the late Dr. Duncan, of Edinbm-gh, which is remai'kable for the pro- 
perty of gelatinising on being heated, and becoming fluid on cooling.
Dr. B.
then showed dried specimens of Cheirostemou platanoides, 
the hand-tree or Manitas of South America, and explained the pecu- 
liar structure of the stamens.
A specimen of Androsace alpina was exhibited, which had been 
gathered by Dr. Barry on Mont Blanc, at the height of 10,000 feet.
Dr. Balfour then gave a short account of botanical trips with his 
pupils to Roseneath, Ross, Largs and Wemyss-bay, Dumbarton and 
320 
Bowling ; and noticed some of the more interesting plants collected, 
such as Uymenophyllum Wilsoni in Ardenconnel Glen, Valeriana 
pyrenaica, Cardamine amara, Sedum Telephium, Carum verticillatum, 
CEnanthe crocata exhibiting no orange juice when cut, Rumex san- 
guineus, 0.
viridis, Milium effusum, Sagina maritima, Raphanus ma- 
ritimus, Sinapis monensis, Steenhammera maritima, Trollius euro- 
pgeus, Mimulus luteus, naturalised near Largs, Pinguicula lusitanica, 
Osmunda regalis, Peucedanum Ostruthium, Lysimachia Nummularia, 
Asplenium marinum, Smyrnium olusatrum, Carex muricata.
Inula 
Helenium, Conium maculatum, Malva moschata and sylvestris, Poa 
maritima.
Geranium Columbinum, Allium vineale and Solanum Dul- 
camara.
Dr. Balfour also gave a detailed account of an excursion to Loch 
Winnock and Castle Semple woods, and exhibited most of the plants 
collected, in a fresh state; such as Nuphar lutea, Ranunculus Lin- 
gua, Hippuris vulgaris, Carex acuta and vesicaria, Aconitum Napellus, 
Hesperis matronalis, Serrafalcus commutatus, Sedum villosum and S.
Telephium, Littorella lacustris, Staphylea pinnata, Berberis vulgaris, 
Lythrum Salicaria, Spiraea salicifolia, Verbascum Thapsus, Acer cam- 
pestre and Epipactis latifolia.
He described the gardens at Castle 
Semple, which are very extensive.
The quantity of glass in the vi- 
neries, peach and pine houses, greenhouses and stoves, is probably 
unequalled in any private garden in Scotland.
The party were 
received most hospitably by the proprietor, Colonel Harvey, who 
accompanied them through the woods in the neighbourhood of the 
Castle.
In the plantations, some fine cedars, larches and oaks were 
observed.
It was agreed, on the motion of the President, that the Committee 
on the Flora of Glasgow, formerly appointed, be authorised to make 
up a Catalogue of British Plants, to be published under the direction 
of the Glasgow Botanical Society.
A specimen of Cirsium setosum of Bieberstein was received from 
Dr. Dewar of Dunfermline, for the herbarium.
Dr. Rottinger, curator of the herbarium, exhibited specimens of the 
following vegetable alkaloids : â€” viz., Morphin, Meconin, Codein, 
Narcotin, Solanin, Atropin, Delphinin, Lactucin, Emetin, Berberin, 
Aconitin, Veratrin, Picrotoxin, Brucin, Peucedanin, Cinchonin, Jala- 
pin, iEsculin, Santonin.

Account of a Botanical Excursion to the Mull of Cantyre and the 
Island of Islay, in August, 1844.
By J.
H. Balfour, M.D.
(Concluded from page 312).
The party left at home had made some additions to the Flora of the 
island during om- absence, by gathering Ruppia maritima, Potamoge- 
ton rufescens, Polemonium ca^ruleum, Malva moschata, Carex acuta, 
Solanum Dulcamara, and Rubus afiinis of Weihe and Nees, a species 
described in Mr. Babington's Manual, and the specimen named on 
his authority.
August 23rd.
â€” This day, like its predecessors, was gloomy and un- 
propitious, and acted in the most cooling manner on the enthusiasm 
of the party.
One gave up Botany for shooting, others remained at 
home, and a party of two only kept up the credit of the expedition.
This party bent their steps towards Losset, passing Kilmeny and Bal- 
lygrant.
At the latter place there is a beautifully wooded lake, well 
stocked with trout, some of them presenting peculiar characters.
On 
the way Ranunculus aquatilis, var.
fluitans, Potamogeton pusillus 
and rufescens were picked.
Near Losset, in a glen not far from the 
Sound of Islay, Ribes rubrum grows in profusion, apparently wild, 
along with Rubus Idaeus and saxatilis.
We got fresh specimens from 
Mr. Stuart.
Near Losset there is a lead-mine, which is worked, and 
there is abundance of iron in the vicinity.
From Losset we proceeded 
to the lake of Finlaggan, or the Loch of Portaneilan, as it is some- 
times called, and collected a few common aquatic plants.
On an 
island in the loch stand the ruins of the castle of Finlaggan, famous 
as the place where the MacDonalds, Lords of the Isles, were crowned.
There is no means of reaching the island except by wading, inasmuch 
as there is no boat on the loch.
The water is about four feet deep at 
the place where the island can be reached.
We accordingly had to 
wade up to the middle in order to get a view of the ruins.
The 
buildings seem to have been extensive.
There are the remains of an 
old chapel, with some antiquated grave- stones, having swords carved 
on them.
The grandeur of this castle of the Lords of the Isles is 
now gone, and nettles and Stachys sylvatica, along with other ignoble 
weeds, occupy the halls of the MacDonalds.
On the walls of the 
chapel Asplenium Ruta-muraria and Adiantum-nigrum grow in profu- 
sion, filling up every chink and crevice with their fronds.
The con- 
templation of these cnimbling walls and the vegetation covering them, 
recalled to my mind the words of the American poet, who, when 
speaking of flowers as stars in earth's firmament, and describing the 
Vol. ti.
2 r 
322 
various lessons which they furnish, goes on to say, â€” 
" Not alone in her vast dome of glory, 
Not on graves of birds and beasts alone, 
But in old cathedrals high and hoary 
On the tombs of heroes carved in stone.
In the cottage of the rudest peasant, 
In ancestral homes whose crumbling towers 
Speaking of the past unto the present 
Tell us of the ancient games of flowers.
In all places then and in all seasons 
Flowers expand their light and soul-like wings, 
Teaching us by most persuasive reasons 
How akin they are to human things.'' 
On an island near that already mentioned, and separated from it only 
by a narrow strait, are the ruins of some buildings where the Lords 
of the Isles held their councils.
The islands were formerly united by 
a draw-bridge.
On one side of the island on which Finlaggan Castle 
stands there are the remains of a pier, and a similar pier exists on the 
mainland.
In the loch grew Phragmites communis, Nymphaea alba 
and Potamogeton natans.
From Finlaggan we w alked to Duisker, where Agrimonia Eupatoria, 
Eupatorium cannabinum and Festuca gigantea were found.
This 
being a limestone district the vegetation was luxuriant, and the rocks 
were undermined in many places by the streams.
On our way from 
this district to Ealabus, we visited Loch Skiros, and gathered Pota- 
mogeton perfoliatus and pusillus and Callitriche autumnalis.
In the evening the party were conveyed to Portaskaig, and went on 
board the steam-boat which was to start early next morning for 
Tarbet.
Thus ended our Islay trip, one from which all of us derived the 
greatest gratification, and for which we were deeply indebted to the 
kindness and hospitality of Mr. Chiene.
Without his kind offices we 
could not have examined the island in the manner we did.
He spared 
no trouble in conveying us to different parts of the island, and in 
affording us every facility for the prosecution of our researches.

Note on Vinca minor in the Isle of Wight.
By W.
A. Bromfield, 
M.D., F.L.S.
Although the greater periwinkle [Vinca major) does occasionally 
perfect seed in the climate of Britain, I believe instances in which 
the lesser periwinkle produces its fruit with us are of such extremely 
rare occurrence as to have come under the notice of but few obser- 
vers.* The readers of the ' Phytologist ' may therefore feel an interest 
in knowing that Vinca minor ripens its follicles abundantly in a hilly 
wood, called, I believe, Bottomground Copse, a short half-mile W.
N. 
W. of Idlecombe-farm on the road from Carisbrooke to Shorwell.
The 
copse lies off from the road nearly at the foot of the eastern slope of 
* It has been suggested to me by Mr. Smith, of the Kew Gardens, to whom I 
showed specimens of the fruit not long since, that the seed-vessels are in all probabi- 
lity not so rarely developed as is generally supposed, but merely overlooked, which, 
from what T have observed and remarked on below, is, I think, likely to be the case.
329 
Buccouibe or Bowcorabe Down, and is almost completely surround- 
ed by corn-fields.
The Vinca here grows in most luxuriant profusion 
over the greater part of the wood, covering the ground with a thick 
carpet of densely interwoven stems, to the utter annihilation of every 
plant of weaker vegetating powers than itself.
The station is the 
only one yet known to me in which this species, so common in the 
mainland woods of Hampshire, is to be seen in a truly natural condi- 
tion on this side of the Solent.
The seed-vessels, though plentifully 
produced, are not very easily detected amongst the mass of entangled 
stems and leaves, as they are chiefly found low down on the flowering- 
shoots, their green colour and the prone curvature of the peduncles 
in this fructiferous state materially aiding their concealment.
They 
appear to be a long time in attaining maturity when the very early 
flowering of the plant is taken into account, since, though fully grown, 
but few of the capsules had begun to open and discharge the seed 
when I last visited the spot (August 22nd), having made but little 
progress towards ripening in the fortnight before, when I first detected 
them, but which is perhaps attributable to the cold and moisture then 
prevailing.
In a warmer season they would probably have been in 
perfection by that time.
The follicles are small (from about half an inch to an inch in 
length), geminate, parallel to each other or diverging, mostly unequal, 
and often very much so, one of each pair frequently altogether aboi*- 
tive ; oblong, more or less beaked, the apex somewhat obtuse, 
straight or a little curved ; angular, sulcate and glabrous, green, or 
here and there brownish, coriaceous, bursting along the inner side, 
and having a pair of small yellowish glands at their base.
Seeds two, 
or (by abortion ?) solitary, when in pairs often imperfect, elliptical 
oblong, subcylindrical, truncate at the ends opposed to each other, 
with a deep channel along one side, formed by the inflexion of the 
pale, fleshy, or rather cartilaginous albumen upon the line of placen- 
tation, which is parallel to, and close upon, the sutural margins ; dull 
rusty brown, rugose, scabrous, punctate and cellular.
Embryo in the 
axis of the seed, linear, straight, or nearly so.
I find the follicles 
often perforated and the seeds devoured by some insect I have not 
yet had the means of ascertaining.

Note on Melilolus officinalis.
By W.
A. Bromfield, M.D., F.L.S.
Sir William Hooker gives this as an annual in his ' British Flora,' 
by most authors it is more correctly marked as biennial or perennial.
That it is not annual I have a convincing proof, in its appearance this 
year in prodigious quantity all over a copse called Bloodstone Copse,* 
near Ashey in this island, where, previous to the brushwood having 
been cleared last spring, little or none of the plant was to be seen.
At 
this moment the entire cleared space is filled with tall bushy plants 
of Melilotus, so closely crowded as completely to hide the ground, yet, 
of the many thousands, I might almost say millions, of specimens, I 
could find but a single individual producing a small flowering branch, 
and which was doubtless one amongst the few scattered unnoticed 
about the copse, that had passed the first year of its growth.

Note on Atriplex hortensis.
By W.
A. Bromfield, M.D., F.L.S.
Rambling about a month since upon the shore between Ryde and 
Binstead, I was much struck by finding an Atriplex scattered along 
the beach, in company with other species of the genus, which appeared 
wholly new to me.
On showing specimens of it in seed to Mr. Ba- 
bington when down here lately, that gentleman pronounced them to 
be A.
hortensis, a plant formerly cultivated in British gardens in lieu 
of spinach, but at the present day, I believe, wholly disused and for- 
gotten.
The locality in which I found it was quite a wild one, 
namely, on the sea-beach just above high- water-mark, and close 
under the wooded banks of slipped clay which skirt that part of the 
coast, growing, as I have said, with other species of Orache (Atriplex 
rosea, patula, &c.), either on the bare soil or amidst masses of sea- 
weed.
The plant was not abundant, neither was it very sparingly 
dispersed the whole distance along the line of coast, single plants oc- 
curring at moderate intervals for the space of, perhaps, one third of a 
mile or more.
The difiiculty is, to account for the appearance of a 
* This copse derives its name from the pebbles in a spring which rises here being 
stained with marks exactly resembling blood, in miraculous commemoration of a san- 
guinary conflict, which tradition records to have taken place on the spot between the 
islanders and their Danish invaders.
The legend is still current amongst, and de- 
voutly credited by, the rustics of Ashley and its neighbourhood.
331 
plant in so secluded a situation which seems almost to have become 
extinct with us as an object of cultivation, and even of curiosity.
I 
can find no reference to any modern figure given by British writers of 
this plant, neither have I ever met with the species in any old-fashion- 
ed garden, in which such obsolete productions as this and many other 
vegetables now discarded are still cherished and preserved.
On the 
continent, indeed, where its employment as a pot-herb is not gone out 
of date, the garden Orache occasionally finds a place in the European 
Floras, from becoming naturalized about the site of its cultivation ; 
but I was little prepared to see this native of eastern Asia growing as 
if perfectly at home on a lonely part of our own coast.
I can only 
conjecture that the seeds may have been thrown ashore from some 
foreign vessel, feeling pretty confident that no such species of Atri- 
plex is to be found in any Isle-of- Wight garden at the present day ; 
if this be not its origin with us it must have been long naturalized, 
though unobserved in the locality just given.
Amongst the figures of 
old authors, that of Gerarde (Johnston's ed.), p.
325, fig.
I (White 
Orache), is the best and most characteristic of the species as it presents 
itself with us, except that the leaves are here very obtuse.
The plant 
is easily recognized when not in fruit, by the great size of its leaves, 
which somewhat resemble those of beet in their fleshy, oleraceous 
character, and those of spinach in form, but are much larger, the low- 
ermost being often as long and wide as the expanded hand or bigger.
The fructiferous valves or perigones of the pistillate flowers are very 
conspicuous from their great dimensions, and are broadly ovate or 
nearly orbicular, slightly pointed and mucronulate, quite entire and 
destitute of tubercles or crystalline granulations.
They are besides 
of a thin, membranous texture, particularly when fully ripe, at which 
time they are elegantly reticulated with prominent veins, and bear a 
considerable resemblance to the enlarged perianth of a dock.
The 
perigones are quite free to the very base, and distinct, or not imbedded 
in fleshy tissue, subpedicellate, closely applied to one another by 
their flat margins to their apex and enclosing a large vertical seed of 
a greyish black or oftener yellowish colour, orbicular, much compress- 
ed, covered with a pale, close-wrinkled skin, sessile at the base of 
the perigones and quite unconnected with either of them.
Amongst 
these pistillate flowers are interspersed others that are hermaphrodite, 
on very short but distinct pedicels, and bearing each a blackish and 
coated seed like the rest, but smaller and horizontal, partially en- 
closed by the five connivent perianth-segments, and in all respects 
resembling the same parts in Chenopodium.
" Strange is it," ex- 
claims Linnffius, when speaking of the genus in his charming work 
332 
the ' Flora Lapponica,'* "that if you abstract the female flowers the 
plant will be no longer an Atriplex but exactly a Chenopodium." 
A remark, which, by the way, is not so strictly applicable to many 
species of Atriplex as the one now before us.
1 have a perfect recollection of gathering a specimen of our Atri- 
plex on an old compost heap at Sandown, several years ago, and 
being considerably puzzled at the time wdiat to make of it, as the 
plant was only just beginning to form flower- spikes.
I judged it 
might be a very luxuriant example of Chenopodium hybridum, with 
which I was then practically unacquainted, or a monstrously over- 
grown root of spinach.
1 have now no doubt of what was its real 
nature, since I have met with it a second time in a state for determi- 
nation, and in a much more satisfactory locality.
T have been thus 
led into detail, because I believe this old denizen of the kitchen-gar- 
den is become extremely rare and known but to few ; that it is pro- 
bably no longer cultivated by any but the curious botanist, but that 
it occasionally maintains its ground in this as in other parts of Europe, 
where, from its general family resemblance to the rest of this too 
much neglected and perhaps uninviting tribe, it is passed by or con- 
founded with its congeners.
Since writing the above, I have been informed by an intelligent 
young gardener, whose name has already appeared in the pages of this 
Journal, Mr. Thomas Meehan, that Atriplex hortensis frequently ap- 
pears as a weed in and about St. Clare, near this town, but is not 
cultivated there.

On the Polygonum mite of Schrank, and allied species.
By Hewett C.
Watson, Esq., F.L.S.
Three additional species of Polygonum have been lately enume- 
rated in the descriptive Floras of Britain, which were either omitted 
altogether in preceding works, or noticed only as varieties of other 
better known species.
They appear in the ' British Flora,' fifth edi- 
tion, under the names of Roberti, mite and laxum.
Having been 
* Fl. Lapp., p.

333 
kindly supplied with seeds of P.
Roberti (P.
Raii, Bah.), by the Rev.
W. S.
Hore, I hope next year to ascertain whether it will remain 
permanently distinct from P.
maritimura, when grown under the same 
conditions of soil and temperature.
Though P.
maritimum assumes 
very much the general appearance of P.
Roberti, when grown in my 
garden, it has now retained, through three descents, the strongly- 
nerved ochreae which Mr. Babington deems the best character for dis- 
tinction from his P.
Raii.
Polygonum mite has been something of a puzzle to me until this 
present autumn ; and finding other (and better) botanists at fault in 
distinguishing this species from its allies, I trust that some remarks on 
its character and synonyms may not be mistimed, particularly as I 
have just been drying a supply of P.
mite for the distributing Botani- 
cal Society.
In the following dichotomous sort of arrangement of their charac- 
ters, the native species of the group are contrasted against each other 
in such a w^ay as to show both their resemblances and differences ; 
and if printed as written, it may afford a sufficient diagnosis for each 
of them.
I. Fruit triangular, or compressed, with convex faces, one face 
usually rising into a third angle at the base.
Peduncles nearly or 
quite glabrous.
Ochreas fringed.
A. Fruit shining.
Spikes erect.
Ochreae strigose.
a. Styles connected half their length.
Fruit large, with broadly ovate faces.
1. Spikes oblong, dense, usually leafless, (Persicaria).
2. Spikes filiform, interrupted and leafy below, (mite).
b. Styles connected two-thirds of their length.
Fruit small, narrowly ovate.
3. Spikes filiform, {minus).
B. Fruit opaque.
Spikes drooping.
Ochreae subglabrous.
c. Styles distinct almost from their base.
Fruit large ovate.
4. Spikes filiform, interrupted and leafy below, {Hydropiper).
II.
Fruit compressed, with concave faces.
Peduncles glandular- 
hispid.
Ochreae slightly or only partially fringed.
C. Fruit shining.
Spikes erect.
Ochreae subglabrous.
d. Styles distinct almost from their base.
Fruit rather large, roundish ovate.
5. Spikes oblong, dense.
Lower ochres without fringe, (lapathifolium).
6. " Spikes elongated slender." "Ochreae shortly fringed," {Inxum).
334 
Polygonum mite is usually contrasted against the Hydropiper or 
minus ; and as it is sometimes confused with one or the other of them 
by good botanists, that course would seem to be necessary.
Accord- 
ing to my own view, it is much more closely allied to Persicaria than 
to either of those two species ; and, indeed, I can separate it from 
Persicaria by no other good mark besides the difference of inflores- 
cence, which is slight enough in some examples.
It may be that I am not sufiiciently familiar with P.
laxum.
If 
understood, I take it to be simply a variety of lapathifolium.
Taken 
together, these two are readily distinguished from the rest by the hol- 
low surfaces of their fruit.
Persicaria and mite are recognized by 
their larger flowers, which are opaquely milk-white when expanded, 
though the perianth is usually coloured on the outside.
Their fruit 
distinguishes them from the two former, by its angularity or convexity, 
from minus, by its greater size ; from Hydropiper, by its shining sur- 
face.
The flowers and fruit of minus are scarce half so large as those 
of the other species.
The drooping inflorescence, glandular perianths, 
and opaque fruit amply distinguish P.
Hydropiper, which is also fur- 
ther distinguishable from mite by the narrower segments of the peri- 
anth, and their more transparent or watery-white tint internally.
The 
real difficulty comes when Persicaria and mite have to be distinguished 
fi'om each other, since we have only the difference of broad and slen- 
der spikes for contrast here, and some examples of mite come rather 
inconveniently near to Persicaria.
In respect to some other characters which have been used for spe- 
cific diagnosis, it may be said that they are too variable for reliance 
apart from the fruit and inflorescence.
Thus, the ochreae of mite are 
sometimes almost glabrous, and those of Hydropiper are occasionally 
strigose.
The fringe of the same organ, formed by the excurrent 
nerves, is absent in some of the upper ochreae of Hydropiper, and oc- 
casionally present in some of the lower ochreae of lapathifolium.
I 
have seen both glabrous and hispid peduncles on the same plant of 
Persicaria.
The rounded or attenuated bases of the leaves are incon- 
stant characters.
And the stems of all these species (unless P.
laxum 
be an exception), vary from simple to much branched, from erect to 
decumbent and rooting at the lower joints.
On the whole, the fiuit 
and inflorescence offer the best characters for specific diagnosis.
I have not had the opportunity of seeing the figure and description 
of P.
mite, in the ' Supplement to English Botany.' Here I possess 
only the small edition of that work, and I do not find P.
mite among 
335 
the supplementary plates sent with that edition.
The volume which 
should include the figure, has been lost from the Linnean Society, 
where there appears no haste to replace it.
The character and syno- 
nyms of this plant are correctly given in the fifth edition of the ' Bri- 
tish Flora,' except that the spikes are said to be " drooping," which I 
do not find to be the case.
The description in Babington's Manual 
is also correct, or nearly so.
As in allied species, the stamens vary 
in number ; but I think that six (not five) is the usual number ; one 
close on each side the ovary, and four others in an outer whorl.
The 
" spikes thickening upwards " I do not quite understand.
I have collected P.
mite along the gravelly margin of the Thames, 
Surrey side, between Walton bridge and Sunbury lock ; more espe- 
cially near the bridge, where Lord Tankerville's lawn runs alongside 
the river.
It occurs also in a ditch, at the entrance of the first (short) 
lane on the right hand, in passing along the road from Hampton 
Court bridge towards the South-western Railway.
I have likewise a 
fi*agment, apparently of the same species, though in a young state, 
firom the neighbourhood of Southampton.
Cheshire specimens are in 
the herbarium of Sir W.
J. Hooker, sent by Mr. W.
Wilson, under 
the name of P.
minus, (1828).
I have also European specimens of 
the same species, sent with the names of laxiflorum (Weihe), dubiura 
(Braun), Braunii (Bluff and Fing.), and mite (Pers.).
With the excep- 
tion of the last, these names may be taken for synonyms of our Eng- 
lish P.
mite (Schrank).
Persoon apparently intended the American 
species, which is not the same as the European one (previously .?) 
named " mite " by Schrank.
It is difficult to say whether Allioni's 
figure and description of P.
strictura belong to mite or minus.
Ber- 
toloni, with specimens from Piedmont before him, refers them to P.
minus of ' English Botany.' 
It should be mentioned that a specimen of the Walton-bridge plant 
was last year communicated to an eminent English botanist, whom I 
supposed to be well acquainted with P.
mite of the * British Flora ' 
and ' Manual of British Botan3\' He referred my plant to P.
minus, 
considering it to be the form which Fries has called P.
strictum, and 
with which he unites our P.
minus as a smaller variety.
After re-ex- 
amining the Walton plant this year, together with Persicaria and 
minus, all in a fresh state, I find myself unable to concur with the 
botanical friend alluded to.
I refer my plant unhesitatingly to the 
species received as P.
laxiflorum, from botanists of Prussia and 
336 
Austria.
Of its distinctness from Persicaria, there seems much more 
reason to doubt, although my series of specimens are not yet suffi- 
cient to connect the two presumed species.

On the prevalence of European Genera and Species of Plants in the 
hilly parts of the province of South Australia.
By Thomas 
CoRDER, Esq., A.L.S.
The settled part of the above province is pretty much confined to 
the district between the Gulf of St. Vincent and the river Murray, 
and is divided into two parts by a range of hills of considerable ele- 
vation.
Running north and south between these hills and the sea, the 
country is principally a level plain, lightly timbered with various 
species of Eucalyptus, Callitris, Banksia, Casuarina, Exocarpus and 
Acacia, which list comprises nearly all the trees in the colony.
The 
vegetation is of a very exotic character, but in the vicinity of Adelaide 
I have noticed Poa annua and Polygonum aviculare in great profusion 
by the sides of foot-paths and roads.
The country beyond the hills is table-land, elevated about 1200 feet, 
and sloping gradually towards the Murray and lake Alexandrina.
It 
is diversified with forest ranges and open grassy valleys, and watered 
by numerous small streams, which, however, cease to flow in the dry 
season.
The vegetation in this district bears great affinity to that of 
Europe, with the exception of the trees, which are pretty much the 
same as described above.
The most common grass is the kangaroo 
grass ( Anthisteria australis), but Poa trivialis and annua, Festuca, 
Bromus, Avena, Briza, Agrostis and several others are frequently met 
with.
The brooks and streams abound with the common reed 
(Arundo Phragmitis), Typha angustifolia, Glyceria fluitans, Lycopus 
europseus ; and the swampy ground produces the marsh mallow 
{Althaa officinalis).
The only Australian llubus [R.
australis) grows 
in similar situations ; the fruit resembles the raspberry, but is very 
rarely produced.
The pastures are covered in spring with a Ranun- 
culus closely resembling R.
bulbosus, but with tuberous roots, and 
two species of Viola.
I have also gathered Matricaria Chamomilla, 
Melilotus officinalis, Centaurea solstitialis, Lotus corniculatus (in very 
337 
great profusion), a Hax, which I could not distinguish from Linuui 
perennc, a Medicago, closely resembling M.
maculata, two species of 
Convolvulus, exactly resembling C.
sepium and C.
arvensis, a Gera- 
nium, with the habit of G.
dissectum, but with very large bulbous 
roots, Stellaria graminea, Polygonum Persicaria, and several others.
But this vegetation is entirely confined to the open grassy country ; 
the Flora of the forest ranges being entirely of an exotic character, 
abounding particularly in orchidaceous plants, most of which I believe 
lo be nondescript.
These flower in the early spring, with the excep- 
tion of a Neottia, which takes the place of N.
spiralis, and is nearly 
similar, but larger, and with very fi'agrant pink flowers.
As I was one of the first settlers in that district, 1 feel fully assured 
that the species I have enumerated were not introduced, the land being 
then entirely in a state of nature.

On the identity of Avena sativa with A.
fatua, being the result of 
observations during a residence of five years in the province 
of South Australia.
By Thomas Corder, Esq., A.L.S.
On my first settling in the above colony, I found it to be a general 
belief amongst farmers, that the common oat was apt to degenerate if 
sown several years in succession on the same soil ; and was also in- 
formed that the farmers in Van Diemen's Laud were in the habit of 
renewing their seed from England every year.
This led me to inquire 
into the subject, and I will now proceed to give the result of my ob- 
servations.
In August, 1842, I procured some seed oats of excellent 
quality, weighing about 421bs.
per bushel, which had been grown two 
seasons in the province : these I sowed on three acres of new ground 
which had never before been cropped.
In January, 1843, my crop 
was ripe, but the quality of the grain was inferior to that sown, and a 
portion of the plants began to assume the appearance of Avena fatua.
The oat, though still white, was somewhat hairy at the extremity, and 
in some cases was awned.
The summer being hot, a large quantity 
dropped out in cutting, so that I allowed it to remain as a self-sown 
crop, without ploughing, and in January, 1844, I had a second crop 
ripe, about equal in quantity to the first, but by this time a portion 
had changed entirely to fatua, and a very small part of the remainder 
Vol. II.
2 t 
338 
preserved its original character.
I allowed it to remain a third season, 
and when I left the colony in the beginning of the present year, about 
two thirds had become fatua, and nearly all the rest was in the interme- 
diate stages.
The soil was rather poor and stony, but I found the trans- 
formation to take place much more rapidly in a deep, rich soil.
I 
examined a field of that description which had been self-sown two 
years in succession, and was not able to find a single plant which re- 
tained any appearance of the original, in a very dense crop on about 
twenty acres of land, which was consequently cut green for hay, a 
very common custom in the Australian colonies and also at the Cape.
I could multiply instances, if necessary, to prove this remarkable and 
interesting fact, which shows the origin of one of the cereal plants, 
if what T have already mentioned (which would be confirmed by any 
practical farmer in the colonies) were not sufficient to prove what I 
have asserted.
The variety called the Tartarian oat is, I think, distinct, as I found 
it to remain unchanged for several years on the same soil, but I am 
not aware that it has ever been found in a wild state.
Perhaps it 
might be referred to A.

Occurrence of Alyssiim calycuium and Narcissus hiflorus near 
Dawlish, By R.
C. R.
Jordan, Esq.
Your correspondent, the Rev. Gerard Smith, in a paper in the 'Phy- 
tologist' (Phytol.
ii.
282) on the claims of Alyssum calycinum to be 
regarded as a native, says that all the localities hitherto recorded in 
England lie near the eastern coast ; it will therefore be interesting, at 
least to him, to know that my brother found it near Dawlish, occur- 
ring rather plentifully in a sandy ploughed field.
It may be well to 
add, that although w^e must have often passed through the field, even 
in the time of its flowering (May), we never noticed it before this 
year.
Narcissus hijlorus.
â€” This plant occurs in small clumps of two or 
three, scattered here and there, over the whole of the Dawlish warren.
It does not seem probable that in such a situation it could be merely 
an exile from a garden ; and its being nowhere abundant and yet 
found on opposite parts (in some places where the turf seems not to 
339 
have been disturbed for many years), seem to prove that it has either 
been planted there by the hand of Nature, or else by that of some bo- 
tanist who has thought fit to help her in her operations.
The first 
plant that I saw there I procured, thinking (as it was not yet in 
flower) that it might possibly prove to be N.
poeticus.
I was, however, 
disappointed, but yet it in some measure repaid me to find an old 
friend in so unexpected a locality.
Orchards near farm-houses often 
produce it abundantly, when its white flowers, intermixed with those 
of N.
Pseudo-narcissus, have really a most brilliant appearance.

Remarks upon the Potato-murrain.^ By H.
O. Stephens, Esq.
The destruction of so large a portion of the potato crop is a cala- 
mity of such magnitude, that it would necessarily occupy the attention 
of this Society ; but when it is supposed this destruction is eff*ected 
through the agency of a minute cryptogamic plant, the interest of the 
inquiry is greatly increased, and the whole matter falls at once within 
that department of Natural History for the cultivation of which tlie 
Botanical Society of London was formed.
Your Hon. Secretary has requested me to draw up a few remarks 
on the potato-murrain, as it has been called, and it is only my desire 
to be useful to the Society that emboldens me to forward these remarks, 
which are very imperfect, being hastily put together amidst all man- 
ner of interruptions.
They must be regarded as sketches towards a 
history of the disease, rather than as a complete description of the 
phenomena in all their aspects.
It will perhaps be better to enumerate the symptoms in succession, 
commencing with the external and internal physical characters of the 
disease, and then endeavour to ascertain if the immediate cause of the 
decay of the foliage and tubers can be detected.
The potato crop, at least in the district in which 1 reside, was, up 
to a certain period, one of unusual promise, but it was generally ob- 
served that the haulm was excessively luxuriant, and this rankness of 
growth was attributed with justice to the excessive moisture of the 
summer.
Suddenly the leaves began to shrivel and roll backwards, 
* Read before the Botanical Society of London, 3id October, 1845.
340 
and turn black, and the same kind of black patches appeared on the 
stem, and a field of potatoes smitten by the disease, presented much 
the same aspect as if the haulm had been destroyed by the sharp frost 
of an autumnal night.
And so alike was the appearance, that many 
were deceived by it, and thought their crops were killed by the frost.
In a very few days from the appearance of the disease the haulm de- 
cayed down to the ground.
The tubers of the blackened plants 
shared in the sudden destruction, their surface became discoloured, 
and of a livid leaden hue, and the rind presented a rugose or pustu- 
lated appearance, but the same root bore tubers both sound and 
unsound, and in all states of disease.
I did not notice that the per- 
fection of the tuber at all interfered with the progress of the disease, 
because fully grown and immature tubers were equally infected on 
the same root, nor could I at all ascertain, as some have asserted, that 
the tubers nearest the surface of the ground were first attacked.
When an infected tuber is cut across, the circumference is disco- 
loured, and turned brown beneath the rind ; the external portion of 
the potato being the part first affected.
The brown spots seem drier 
than the rest of the structure, and the whole much resembles the 
brown discoloiu'ation beneath the skin of a bruised apple.
It is pretty 
generally stated that the tubers soon pass into a state of complete 
decay, a nioist rottenness, but this is, I think, an accidental circum- 
stance, for if kept in a dry place, they desiccate and shrivel, at least 
such is the case with my specimens.
In a state of moist decay they 
exhale a most unpleasant odour.
Only a portion of a tuber is some- 
times diseased, and the eyes of the sound poition germinate as usual ; 
and if a part of the potato is above ground and exposed to light, 
chlorophylle is formed in the tissues.
When cooked, the appearance 
of the unsound potato is very disgusting.
All the portions which 
were brown when raw, when boiled turn of an ashen livid hue, and the 
substance of tlie whole is waxy and the odour and taste very unplea- 
sant.
There can be no doubt that these potatoes are totally unfit for 
human food, and that eating such would be dangerous, it being too 
well known that decayed or decomposing vegetable or animal sub- 
stances, when eaten, produce severe diseases.
A microscopical examination of a portion of a diseased potato ex- 
hibits the following conditions.
That portion, usually the centre, 
which is still tolerably sound, contains the starch corpuscles in an un- 
altered state, whilst the circumference of the tuber, which is usually 
discoloured and unsound, will be found nearly exhausted of starch.
The starch corpuscles disappear, or are absorbed or disintegrated in 
341 
the diseased portions, and the cells which before contained the fecula 
are either empty or contain brownish crystalline bodies, which are, I 
suppose, the remains of the decomposed starch globules.
The 
potato, then, is deprived of its natural principle by this disease, in a 
manner analogous to the process of germination, in which the starch 
entirely disappears.
It is quite certain that the present potato-death is entirely a new 
plague, as far, at least, as England is concerned ; it is true that some 
years ago the potato crop was injured by what was called the curl, 
in which the leaves curled or shrivelled up, but we have no accurate 
account of this affection, but it was altogether different from the pre- 
sent visitation.
What, then, is the immediate cause of the destruction of the potato 
crop throughout Europe, for all botanists agree in the identity of the 
disease ?
It can only be ascribed, with any degree of probability, to 
one of two causes, either to atmospheric influences, or to the imme- 
diate agency of some destroying principle acting directly upon the 
plants.
The latter seems to be most generally received as nearest to 
truth, and for this reason, that the leaves and stem, and the exterior of 
the tubers are found to be infested with a mucous fungus, whilst it is 
likewise stated, on the highest and best authority, that a singular 
mycetoid production inhabits the intercellular spaces in the diseased 
tubers.
I will merely relate the result of my own investigations, leaving it 
to the Society to receive them or reject them according to their own 
standard of evidence.
I, like all other observers, notice that the leaves 
in most specimens sent for examination, present a hoariness of aspect, 
and this hoariness is caused by countless plants of a species of the 
genus Botrytis, in which I find the stem branches into three divisions.
This is the Botrytis infestans, and Mr. Berkeley states in the ' Gar- 
dener's Chronicle,' he finds this fungus invariably preceding the work 
of destruction.
I likewise find on the black patches of the stem, ano- 
ther excessively minute fungus, which appears to belong to the genus 
Fusisporium of Link.
It consists of innumerable, excessively minute, 
elliptic sporidia, collected together in heaps.
They exist in countless 
multitudes, so that the field of the microscope is covered by them.
It is utterly impossible to confound these with the sporidia of the 
Botrytis.
These mycetoid plants inhabit the stem, leaves and exterior 
of the tubers; there is still a most singular mucous fungus, which is 
described both by Montagne and the Rev. Mr.
Berkeley as spreading 
its mycelia through the intercellular spaces of the tuber itself.
Mr.
342 
Berkeley states in the ' Gardener's Chronicle,' this parasite was disco- 
vered by Dr Kayer on potatoes during, or immediately after, the pro- 
cess of germination.
Dr. Montagne, of Lisle, considers this as a new 
genus between, or allied to, Sepedonium and Asterophora, two genera 
of fungi which are parasitic within or upon other fungi, e.
g. Agarics 
and Boleti ; it is said to be furnished with bristly spores, whilst those 
of Sepedonium are echinulate, and those of Asterophora, as the name 
implies, star-shaped.
Dr. Montagne proposes to name this parasite 
Arlotrogus hydnosporus.
I have carefully examined many samples of unsound potatoes, and 
have not succeeded in detecting this fungus.
There can be no doubt 
of its existence; such observers as the Rev. Mr.
Berkeley and D.
Montagne cannot be mistaken; but the question which suggests itself 
to my mind is this, â€” Is the Arlotrogus hydnosporus invariably present 
in the diseased potato ?
I think I scarcely should have failed to 
detect it if it was.
I have been shown what some supposed to be 
spores of fungi in the intercellular spaces, but these turned out to be 
the crystalline brownish bodies before noticed, which I conclude to be 
the remains of the decomposed starch corpuscles.
Mr. Berkeley states he finds the spawn very evident in the diseased 
cells when there was no external symptom of the presence of mould.
This, then, was the spawn of the Botrytis infestans, and not of the 
Arlotrogus.
Admitting the destruction to be caused by the immediate 
agency of mucose fungi, which is the destructive parasite .'' â€” the Fu- 
sisporium Solani, to which many continental botanists attribute the 
death of the stem and leaves ; the Arlotrogus hydnosporus of Mon- 
tagne, which spreads its mycelia through the intercellular spaces of 
the substance of the tubers ; or the Botrytis infestans, the spawn of 
which Mr. Berkeley has abundantly detected in the cells of the tubers 
likewise, and as I am informed by a friend, bursting thi'ough the sto- 
mata of the leaves, just as Cylindrospora major is figured issuing from 
the stomata of Tussilago Petasites by Nees and Henry, ' System der 
Pibse.

2. It is considered unphilosophical to ascribe one 
effect to the operation of several causes, when one would suffice for its 
explanation, and I suppose the potato-murrain will scarcely be attri- 
buted to the combined operation of these fungi.
Mr. Berkeley says 
he is convinced the spots upon the tubers arise from the attack of the 
mould, and that the mould {Botrytis) is not an after organization.
No opinion advanced by this accurate observer and profound Myco- 
logist can be lightly controverted, but other writers attribute the 
destruction to other fungi, which beyond all doubt certainly exist in 
343 
some tubers.
It may be thought this is an inquiry into the operation 
of immediate causes, which, although very curious, is of no practical 
importance, but this is an error : it is a question of vast amount.
If 
this disease is really produced by germs of endophytal fungi, nestling 
within the structure of the parent ; many of these germs will remain 
in a latent condition within the cellular structure of the potato, and 
when such an apparently sound but really infected tuber is used for 
planting in the ensuing year, they will be called into activity again 
during the process of germination of the potato-set, and the same 
disease will probably appear in the potato crop next autumn ; whereas, 
if the present murrain be only the effect of an unusually cold and wet 
season, it may reasonably be hoped a more congenial summer will rid 
us of the calamity.
At all events, it will be highly desirable that in 
the next planting-season the farmer should select his sets, not only 
from sound tubers, but if possible from seed plants obtained from lo- 
calities in which the disease did not appear.
I do not venture to speak dogmatically on the exciting cause of the 
murrain, especially when so many excellent observers maintain a con- 
trary opinion, but I am not perfectly satisfied these fungi are really 
more than accidental accompaniments, rather than the essence, as it 
were, of the malady.
I cannot divest my mind of the impression, 
that with more probability it may be referred to atmospheric influ- 
ences, that is, to the direct debilitating operation of a prolonged low 
temperature, combined with excessive moisture, upon the structure of 
the plant.
The potato plants, as I have before observed, exhibited 
an unusual rankness of growth during the summer, when their struc- 
tures, doubtless, were over-filled with watery sap, just that state of the 
vegetable constitution which renders their vitality low, and therefore 
less able to resist the debilitating effects of cold.
They therefore 
in many situations perished by what I shall denominate vegetable 
sphacelus.
Without speaking confidently, I merely state I am at 
present rather inclined to take this view of the subject, which is 
borne out by many analogies in the animal economy.
It is a singular 
fact, if true, that where the potato crop is exposed to the stimulating 
atmosphere of the sea, e.
g. the coast of Devon and Somerset, the 
murrain is said not to have appeared.
Perhaps the sea-breeze, loaded 
with salt impregnation, may operate as a tonic or stimulant to the 
foliage of the potato-plants, and thus preserve them from the ten- 
dency to decay.
The whole of Europe in which the potato-murrain 
rages, has suffered fi-om the same ungenial wet and cold summer 
which has afflicted England ; therefore the same explanation may be 
344 
applied to all those countries.
But, on the other hand, it must be 
stated that the ciyptogamic parasites are identical in all countries and 
situations.
If newspaper reports may be relied on, it is stated that the same 
disease destroyed the crops in New Brunswick and some parts of 
Canada last year.
Admitting this statement to be correct, much light 
would be thrown on the question of the exciting cause of the murrain, 
if it was ascertained if the season last year, in those provinces, was fine, 
or cold and wet, like the present summer in Europe.
If it turns out 
that the summer of last year in those parts of America was dry and 
genial, of course the opinion I have expressed will be scarcely tenable, 
and that explanation which attributes the disease to the destructive 
ravages of fungi must, I presume, be accepted.
So much has been written upon the best method of turning the dis- 
eased potatoes to account, that I need not refer to the subject at any 
length.
I find that up to this day, all my specimens of diseased tu- 
bers which are kept in a dry place, remain in sfaht, quo, and do not 
pass into moist decay.
I therefore strongly recommend, as many other 
writers have done, that they should be washed clean as soon as dug 
up, and immediately dried, either in a kiln or in a room with a large 
fire in it.
Those which are very bad should at once be crushed, and 
the flour extracted, and the remainder, if kept perfectly dry, would 
keep during the winter, and might be used, when boiled with a little 
salt, as food for pigs, &c.
I have no doubt this will be found in the 
long run more profitable to the farmer than making flour from them, 
which will not prove a very acceptable article of diet, and if not care- 
fully separated from all the diseased matter during the process of ma- 
nufacture, will likewise, I am afraid, not be very wholesome.

Notes of a Botanical Ramble in Connemara and Arran.
By Leslie Ogilby, Esq.* 
You have urged me to give some account of my late excursion to 
Connemara and Arran.
You are pleased to think it would be botani- 
cally interesting, and even acceptable to the editor of the ' Phytolo- 
gist.' In responding to your wish, it is not without the greatest diffi- 
dence, both as to my ability for the attempt, but also as to the quality 
of the material I have to communicate.
- 
I shall commence my ramble from the historically interesting town 
of Galvvay.
Mounted on a comfortable Bianconi car, I left the town 
on the 15th of August, about 10 o'clock in the morning.
The car 
runs to Clifden, on the western coast, at which place it arrives at 7 
in the evening.
The scenery between Galvvay and Oughterard is very 
pleasing : you have, for nearly the whole way, views of the great 
Lough or Lake Corrib, and along the road there appears a good deal 
of young plantation, an evidence of means, taste, and consequent im- 
provement.
The very neat little town of Oughterard is the first place 
of any note you come to ; the situation is very pleasing, and seems to 
occupy, as it were, the boundary between the primitive mountains of 
Connemara and the secondary range forming the lowlands.
A very 
handsome river runs through part of the town, opposite OTlaherty's 
Hotel, and a branch of Lough Corrib approaches it on the eastern 
side.
In this immense sheet of water are many islands.
The whole 
neighbourhood, indeed, affords a field for the general naturalist.
In 
the rivers the Mya Margaritifera abounds ; and I learned fi-om two 
eminent conchologists whom I met at Roundstone, that some good 
pearls are occasionally offered for sale in the town.
I have often 
heard the late talented Mr. James White, for so many years under- 
gardener at Glasnevin, speak of this place.
He accompanied the 
then Professor of Botany, Dr. Wade, in his botanic journey to Con- 
nemara, some thirty or forty years ago, and they made Oughterard a 
kind of head-quarters.
On one of the islands of Lough Corrib I per- 
fectly recollect Mr. White informing me he found Potentilla fruticosa, 
and on a visit he made to the large island of Boffin, off the western 
coast, he found that beautiful variety (if such it be) of Convolvulus 
sepium, with the corolla pink coloured, so very like Convolvulus Sol- 
danella.
He long cherished this plant in the Glasnevin Garden as a

Moore, Esq., of the Dublin Glasnevin Garden, by whom it is 
communicated.

special favourite.
You are aware I was fortunate enough to find, two 
years ago, a similar plant in the neighbourhood of Newcastle Bear- 
haven, and you have mentioned to me your having found a like plant 
in the island of Rathlin, off the north coast of Antrim.
It was from 
this excursion to Connemara that Dr. Wade brought his three little 
treasures, as he called them, viz.
: Phleum alpinum, Agrostis minima 
and Juncus filiformis.
The car stops for dinner at Flynn's Inn, or 
the half-way-house, a hospitable and comfortable country cottage, well 
known to visiters to this western region.
The distance between 
Oughterard and Flynn's is but ten miles, and this, as well as the other 
stages to Clifden, the ardent botanist should by all means walk.
On 
leaving the former place he at once gets into the wild region of moun- 
tain, lake and bog.
At some distance he will have the mountains 
with him on each side, as also those small lakes so prominent a fea- 
ture in this western district, and some one or other of which he never 
loses sight of until he reaches Clifden.
In most of these lakes he will 
find the delicate Lobelia Dortmanna, accompanied by that rai'e plant to 
England and Scotland, Eriocaulon septangulare, appearing, as some 
writer fancifully observes, like a West Indian beauty, with her negro 
slave.
His attention will also be drawn, as he passes along, to the pride 
of Connemara, the beautiful Menziesia polifolia, a plant first made 
known to the botanical world by the illustrious naturalist Ray, upwards 
of a hundred years ago.
He will also see in abundance the Os- 
munda regalis, or royal fern.
I stopped a day at Flynn's, and made 
a long iiiarch through the mountains north of the inn, with but little 
success.
By the banks of a mountain stream I found Orobus sylva- 
ticus, a rare Irish plant.
In the neighbourhood of Flynn's you find 
the Menziesia in great perfection.
Here, too, you get splendid speci- 
mens of Drosera, particularly of D.
longifolia, I never before saw 
such large plants.
Pinguicula vulgaris and lusitanica are quite com- 
mon, and the elegant little Anagallis tenella is to be found running at 
the bottom of every ditch-bank.
In all the surrounding bogs 
Rhynchospora alba grows in profusion, the white and level heads of 
which give, in some measure, a relief to the dark, monotonous colour 
of the peat.
Leaving Flynn's, I came to Adams's Inn by the car.
This 
snug little place is about fourteen miles from Flynn's and five fi-om 
Clifden.
The cottage, for such it is, is an important place to the 
lovers of the angle, being but a short distance from the far-famed lake 
and river of Ballynahinch, situated too, as it were, under the mag- 
nificent group of mountains, called the Twelve Pins of Ballabola, it 
affords the best opportunity of exploring the recesses of these impos- 
347 
ing masses, as also of" seeing the charming lakes of Derriclare and 
Ina running into the very bosom of the mountains.
Behind the inn 
is a road leading to the green marble or serpentine quarries.
At 
Adams's 1 hired a car to take me to Roundstone.
Mr. Martin, of 
Ballynahinch grants the privilege of passing through his grounds, and 
the distance by this route is six miles.
After passing Ballynahinch 
and getting to the river side, I was so captivated by the beauty of the 
place that I sent on my car and determined to walk.
The banks of 
the river were bounded here and there by rocky knolls, now gar- 
nished with the autumnal furze [Ulex nana), Erica cinerea, Calluna 
vulgaris and Menziesia polifolia, the tall, elegant spikes of this last 
overtopping the rest; altogether they formed a blaze of bloom.
You 
know my partiality for the heath tribe, and can appreciate my feelings 
on the occasion.
I never saw a more beautiful sight ; I dwelt upon 
it with delight, and felt as if I could never sufficiently admire it.
" Tarn thought his very een enriched." 
A unique object here presents itself, so singular as to attract every 
passer by.
A mass of rock, some ten or twelve feet in height, rises in 
the middle of the stream, encircled near its top by a wreath of Poly- 
podium vulgare growing in the utmost luxuriance.
On leaving the 
river bank, the rest of my walk was by no means so attractive.
When 
within a short mile of Roundstone, however, and close by the little 
hamlet of Letterdife, my eye at once detected a plant or two of 
Erica Mackaiana in the ditch-bank bordering the road-side.
Return- 
ing to reconnoitre the place, 1 found on the other side of the ditch 
many plants of this very dubious species.
This I consider an inte- 
resting discovery, being a new locality for the plant, distant from the 
original habitat at least two miles.
Near this same place I also found 
the very diminutive moss-like form of Calluna vulgaris, similar in 
every respect to a specimen found by me in Donegal last year.
1 
found the inn in Roundstone, kept by M'cAuley, clean and comfort- 
able, and the landlord and his wife so very attentive, that 1 was in- 
duced to make a considerable stay in the place, and was so fortunate 
as to have as an associate a most agreeable and intelligent English 
gentleman and zealous conchologist.
I did not fail to make a visit 
to Glan Iskey, a valley imbosomed in the beautiful mountain of 
Urrisbeg, and the home, " Sweet home," of the Mediterranean heath, 
or rather the Irish representative of that plant.
What a peculiarly 
interesting sight does this lonely ^ alley present, â€” can any spot be 
348 
more woilliy of a botanical pilgrimage ?
A stream rises iu and tates 
its course through the valley, spreading and ramifying to some dis- 
tance on either side, and along this stream the heath runs for a mile 
or so ; it grows in tufts, and you step from one of these to the other, 
and I remarked that the plant never leaves the influence of the water.
Glan Iskey is accessible without any difficulty, and nothing can be 
more appropriate than its Irish appellation, the watery glen or valley.
I also paid more than one visit to Craigga More (the large rough hill), 
a most conspicuous hill on the new road to Clifden.
This is the first 
described habitat of the Erica Mackaiana, and here, indeed, it grows 
in profusion along the road-side, appearing at this time, 23rd August, 
in all its perfection and loveliness.
As I have much to detail to you 
respecting this singular plant, I shall defer saying more respecting it 
to another time.
It was on one of my trips to this locality that I 
found Rhynchospora fusca, and Peplis Portula, and found every 
boggy ditch green, or rather bronzed, with the Utricularia minor.
Looking from the hill of Craigga More, on the one hand towards 
Unisbeg mountain, and on the other in the direction of the Twelve 
Pins, there appears a perfect maze of lakes ; what a field for the 
young and enterprising botanist !
At some of these small lakes T saw 
several men employed raking out the white water-lily, the roots of 
which they use as a dye in some of their simple, home-wrought ma- 
nufactures.
East of Roundstone, at about half-a-mile distant, between 
the old road to Clifden and the sea, are some interesting little lakes.
They are like bowls, appearing sunk beneath small rocky hills.
These 
small lakes abound with the Eriocaulon, Lobelia Dortmanna being 
comparatively rare.
On these small rocky hills I picked some beau- 
tifully coloured varieties of the Menziesia.
On crossing over the bay 
of Roundstone to the long, straggling island of Innisnee, lying oppo- 
site the town, and dividing Roundstone bay from that splendid ex- 
panse of water, called Birterbuy bay, I found during my ramble a splen- 
did plant of the white variety of the Menziesia.
This was the first time 
during all my wanderings in this country that I ever found this variety.
In an old church-yard on the island I found Inula Helenium or ele- 
campane, and as I never but once before found the plant, and then in 
a kindred situation (Whaley Abbey, in the county Wicklow), I am led 
to suppose it in former times connected with religious feeling or ob- 
servance.
On the 3rd of September I left Roundstone for the island of Arran 
(Arran More), about twenty miles distant, accompanied by my friend, 
]\Ir. B.
We left at 11 o'clock in the morning, but being beset with a 
349 
calm, we did not arrive at our destination until nightfall.
Fortunately 
the little inn at Kilronan (the principal place in the island), was close 
to the shore, so that we soon established ourselves aud baggage in 
Mrs. Costello's best parlour.
I shall never forget my surprise next 
morning on a view of the place, I had imagined the island a most 
fertile spot, clothed with verdure, but to my astonishment it appeared 
a rude mass of limestone, the whole surface, wherever you went, 
scattered over with loose fragments of the same material.
A short 
acquaintance with the place shows you its remarkable character and 
peculiarities.
A long strip of land, running nearly east and west, ten 
miles in length and perhaps not more than from three to four in 
breadth.
This form gives it a large sea-board, and with a surface 
rising gradually and in a curved form from its northern shore, it attains 
a considerable elevation or ridge, and then falls abruptly on the other 
side in perpendicular cliffs.
From this peculiarity of form the surface 
of the island in its whole length is thrown up so as to have a northern 
aspect, or nearly such.
The climate must be a very peculiar one, ex- 
ceedingly moist and mild.
The arable ground is indeed very small 
in proportion to the mass of rock, but it must be of a peculiarly nu- 
tritious and fattening quality, for the place is noted all over Galway 
for producing the largest and finest calves.
There is a peculiarity of 
the place, but artificial, that strikes a stranger.
The whole island is 
parcelled off into small enclosures by loose stone walls, which appear 
a serious obstacle to progression.
With an attendant or guide, how- 
ever, these walls fall like magic before you : he goes before, and with- 
out any ceremony pushes down so much of the frail structure as to 
leave a breach for you to pass.
Tn numerous instances, generally on 
the higher parts of the island, you meet immense boulders of con- 
glomerate ; these are erratic blocks, and evidently quite foreign to the 
place.
I walked to the buildings called the Seven Churches, which 
I found insignificant as to size, and totally devoid of ornament ; and 
also visited two out of the four of those very remarkable circular stone 
forts as they are called, and which structures, from their size, form a 
feature in the scenery of the place.
I shall now give the result of my botanical research on the island.
Adiantum Capillus- Veneris.
This charming rarity is to be found 
in abundance, and grows generally over the island wherever there are 
fissures or clefts in the rock.
The usual depth it grows at is from 
eighteen inches to two feet, keeping just so much below the surface 
as to shelter its delicate fronds from the blast.
There is a great deal 
of the plant heedlessly destroyed.
The inhabitants use it in decoc- 
350 
tion in cases of bad colds and complaints of the lungs, and for this 
purpose, instead of merely cutting the fronds, they pull it up root and 
branch.
I looked in vain for the variety or species with the annu- 
late pinnules said to have been found here.
Neoitia spiralis.
DiflPused over the whole island.
I could have 
gathered hundreds of plants.
Helianthemum canum.
1 was most fortunate in this discovery, 
adding by it a new and interesting plant to the Irish Flora.
It is 
abundant, growing in small tufts in the interstices of the I'ock.
Its 
season of flowering was past.
I found but two single flowers.
Euotiymus europceus.
In the clefts, but stunted.
Arenaria verna.
In several instances.
Carduus nutans.
In a particular spot near the town.
Crithmum marilimum.
Rocks, Kilronan bay.
Juniperus communis.
Common in the fissures of the rock ; always 
dwarfed.
Prunus insiiitia.
Found in the rocky clefts : in fruit.
Marrubium vulgare.
Common, mostly near the villages or hamlets.
Thymus Calamintha.
In such profusion on the way to the Seven 
Churches as to look as if a crop had been sown.
Saxifraga hypnoides.
Common.
Bleclitimn horeale.
Not scarce.
Asplenimn Ruta-muraria.
Abundant.
Trichomanes.
In plenty.
Adiantum-nigriim.
Not frequent.
Polypodium vulgare.
Quite common.
Ceterach officinariim.
By no means frequent.
Scolopendrium vulgare.
Of large size : in the fissures along with 
the Adiantum.
Pteris Aquilina.
Stunted, but scattered over the whole island.
Bartsia Odontites.
Everywhere a perfect weed.
Astragalus hypoglottis.
Rare.
Ruhus saxatilis and casius.
Both abundant, the first in such 
profusion as in many places to be the only covering of the rock.
They were both in fruit, the former with its bright red, and the other 
with its dull blue berry, both very acidulous.
After spending two days on the island, I returned with my com- 
panion to Roundstone.
Here I was fortunate to find Allium Hallerii, 
which you so much wished me to obtain.
After being detained for 
some days at Roundstone by bad weather, I took leave of my very 
kind and talented English friend on the 17th of September, and pro- 
351 
ceeded to Clifdeu.
I found nothing worthy of notice in this pictu- 
resque place, but visited Mr. Darcy's castle and green marble quarry.
My usual stay-away time had now expired, and though I could not 
go so far as to say, â€” 
" Tired of the mountains and pure air, 
And sick from being devoid of care, 
I pined to see the town and folk 
And swallow down delicious smoke :" 
Yet I felt anxious to see home and friends once more.
You are perfectly aware that I always send home living plants of 
those species I consider rare or interesting, and you will vouch for 
my having done so on the present occasion.

BOTANICAL SOCIETY OF GLASGOW.
July 29, 1845.
â€” The Society met in the College at half-past 7, 
P. M.
Dr. Balfour, President, in the chair.
Dr. Bottinger made a report on the state of the Society's Her- 
barium.
Dr. Balfour exhibited a growing specimen of Phallus impndicus, 
which had been gathered in the undeveloped state, near Linlithgow, 
352 
and had been put into a pot among mould and leaves.
It had burst 
the volva and pushed up its stipe and pileus to the height of several 
inches in the course of the night.
He also showed a specimen of Babel bark, imported from Calcutta, 
for the purpose of tanning.
He next showed a specimen of coffee, 
covered with what is technically called parchment, or the thin, brittle 
covering which is spread over the seed within the pulpy part of the 
fruit.
Coffee was occasionally imported in this state with the view 
of being cleaned and winnowed in this country, but it was not found 
profitable.
He also exhibited a specimen of a species of Mespilus, 
destroyed by the attack of a moth of a gregarious nature.
He then 
read extracts fi-om a letter from Dr. R.
C. Alexander, dated Naples, 
21st June, 1845.
" I arrived here" Dr. A.
writes, "about the middle 
of November, and had time before the winter set in, to collect a good 
deal, and to get acquainted with the beautiful scenery round Naples.
In the north of Europe people talk of the south of Italy as though 
there were perpetual spring here during the colder months.
There 
never was a greater error.
I have known frosts as severe at night as 
I have ever witnessed in England, though certainly the mid-day sun 
soon restored the usual appearance of things.
But besides such occa- 
sional pinches, there was a continuance of cold, damp, wretched 
weather till the end of March, now and then a brilliant day or two, 
but nothing like spring.
Many of the shrubs came into blossom and 
made a brilliant show, â€” the splendid Lithospermum rosmarinifolium, 
Cytisus triflorus, ramosissimus, laniger and infestus.
Erica arborea, 
Passerina hirsuta, Daphne collina, Teucrium fruticans, Anagyris 
foetida, &c.
Still it was so completely winter that I started for Pa- 
lermo, and spent two months, April and May, in Sicily.
Prof.
Tineo 
showed me every possible kindness, and what with good advice as to 
localities and pretty fair weather, I collected 270 species that I had 
never before seen growing.
Few enough, you will think, for the two 
best months of the year, in so rich an island as Sicily.
But in that, 
too, we northerns are under a delusion.
A v^ast number of the species 
in catalogues are only other names for our own plants.
When I ask 
the Professors and the resident botanists, to point me out any diffe- 
rence between their plant and the similar one of the north, they usually 
laugh, and tell me it is a ' Permesso del nostro Giovanni :' â€” our good 
friend John has amused himself with making a new species of an old 
one.
Then from the mildness of the climate there is something blos- 
soming all the twelve months of the year, and adding to the catalogue, 
while the foreign botanist can only devote a few weeks to herborizing 
353 
there, and misses a much greater proportion of the Flora than in Swit- 
zerland for instance, where in four months he could collect much 
more than in the same time in Sicily.
The island is not beautiful on 
the whole.
Palermo has a fine site, and the road from Messina along 
the coast is one of the finest that I know.
But the want of forests 
gives a bare, African look to the scenery.
The interior of the coun- 
try has a very desolate look.
For fifteen or twenty miles one does not 
see a cottage or dwelling of any kind.
Plains covered with Arundo 
ampelodesmos and Chamaerops humilis, with a dark, deep soil, fit to 
bear anything, here and there broken up, but apparently neglected for 
want of inhabitants.
Those that are there live in large cottage cities, 
where, except the monasteries and church, everything bespeaks 
poverty.
There is not one good house to 10,000 inhabitants, and yet 
there is no squalid misery.
Far from it, the people are better clothed 
perhaps, than in any other south European country.
It seems as if 
the population were wearing out, unable to keep up its numbers, as 
is the case in Greece, where Sclavonians have, even in the Morea, re- 
placed the ancient race.
* * * * 
Upon ^tna, where I hoped to have found something peculiar, as 
upon the largest European volcano might be expected, I got very 
little indeed.
The Berberis is one of those * Permessi,' really nothing 
but vulgaris.
The Astragalus Siculus was the only plant that I had 
not seen elsewhere, and upon other (not volcanic) strata.
I have made some delightful excursions in the mountains nearest 
Naples.
Everything reminded me of the lUyrian provinces of Austria, 
although few of the species are identical with their Austrian conge- 
ners.
At between 4000 and 5000 feet there are many beautiful sub- 
alpine plants, more than 1 should have expected in this latitude, but 
it is still rather too early.
I mean to visit the Abruzzi in July.
These 
are Alps of 800â€”9000 feet.
In this country the monasteries replace the excellent inns of the 
Swiss, Tyrolese and Austrian Alps." 
The next communication was an account of various trips by Dr.
Balfour and his pupils.
The first being to Ardenenny and Loch Eck, 
on the 28th June.
The party examined the rocks and woods in Glen 
Finnart, and proceeded towards the shores of Loch Eck, skirting 
them as far as Ben More and thence walking to Kilmun.
The chief 
plants noticed were Hymenophyllum Wilsoni, Osmunda regalis, Jun- 
germannia minutissima, Sphaerophorum compressum in fine fruit, 
Rubus saxatilis, Saxifraga aizoides and stellaris, Gymnadenia al- 
bida, Carex stricta, fulva and remota, Polygonum Bistorta, Sedum

anglicum, Silene maritima on sandy shores of Loch Eck, Serrafalcus 
commutatus, Carum verticillatum.
In the woods of Glen Finnavt 
fourteen species of ferns were gathered.
Another trip was undertaken to Bute, on the 4th of July.
Dr. Bal- 
four and his party proceeded from Rothesay to Mount Stuart, picking 
in the way, Pinguicula lusitanica, Saxifraga aizoides, Habenaria chlo- 
rantha and bifolia, Anagallis tenella, Osmunda regalis, &c.
The 
party visited the gardens at Mount Stuart, where many delicate 
plants thrive well in the open air, such as Rhododendrons, Azaleas, 
Fuchsias, Camellias, Hydrangeas, Robinias, Liriodendrons, &c.
Many 
evergreens, such as species of Laurus and Pinus and Thuya had at- 
tained a large size.
Leaving Mount Stuart, the party proceeded to 
Kingarth, whence next day they walked by the shore towards Scalp - 
sie bay.
In this walk they gathered Hypericum elodes, Utricularia 
minor, Carex vesicaria.
Cotyledon Umbilicus, Sinapis monensis and 
many other good plants.
From Scalpsie bay they returned by Fort 
Fad, to Rothesay.
On Thursday, July 10th, Dr. Balfour and his party visited Arran 
and examined the hilly districts of the island, especially Goat fell and 
Cior More, whence they proceeded to Loch Ranza.
From this they 
returned by the coast of Arran and Corrie to Brodrick.
Dr. B .
gave 
an account of the geological features of the part of the island visited, 
and enumerated some of the more important plants gathered, speci- 
mens of which were exhibited.
One of the most interesting plants 
noticed was Pyrus pinnatifida, which was picked in considerable 
quantity on the banks of a mountain stream which terminates at Loch 
Ranza.

Investigation of the specific distinctions of (Enanthe pimpinelloides, 
(E.
peucedanifolia and CE.
Lachenalii.
By Edwin Lees, 
Esq., F.L.S.
' 
From various inquiries I have received about CE.
pimpinelloides, 
Linn., it would appear to be either misunderstood or of very local oc- 
currence, and at all events of uncertain appearance, as I have found 
out by experience ; and from Mr. Mill's observation (Phytol.
ii.
116), 
365 
as well as the doubts on the subject mentioned by Dr. Bell Salter and 
others, its erasure from the British Flora by Mr. Babington, and its 
subsequent restoration on the examination of authentic specimens 
gathered by myself, by Mr. Ball,* I imagine botanists in general do 
not easily recognize it.
I have therefore felt anxious to elucidate, if 
possible, the specific distinctions between the three related species of 
CEnanthe designated above, so that no further doubt may exist on the 
subject.
I was unable to accomplish this last year, as my old locality 
at Powick was unproductive, and during a peregrination of three 
months in North Wales, not a specimen of the genus fell under my 
review, save QL.
fistulosa and QE, crocata.
In the cycle of events, 
however, " Saturnian times return ;" and the present season has pro- 
duced me an abundant harvest, not only of CE.
pimpinelloides, but of 
QE.
peucedanifolia and Lachenalii also, so that having had a previous 
acquaintance with pimpinelloides of fourteen or fifteen years, I can 
now speak with some confidence.
First on the habitats of the three CEnanthes.
It is curious that QE.
pimpinelloides is stated by Smith and Hooker, as well as other bota- 
nical writers, to grow in " salt marshes," but I much doubt whether 
this is ever the case.
For, as I have before stated in my ' Botany of 
the Malvern Hills,' I have always found it " growing on the driest 
ground." In fact, it seems to delight in the veiy driest red marl mea- 
dows, where the ground is so hard that it is a difiicult task, without a 
strong digger or trowel, to get the plant up by the roots.
Indeed, I 
have gathered it on the very summit of Wainlode Cliff, Gloucester- 
shire, where the soil is a stiff lias clay and limestone.
Unfortunately, 
a good look-out is required to get it in perfection, for it flowers just as 
the grass is fit for mowing, and if not taken in the nick of time, the 
scythe remorselessly cuts down every plant.
On the other hand, the 
farmer gives great discouragement to any assault on his mowing grass, 
and unless one meets with it in a field left for grazing, it is necessary 
to be sparing in getting many up.
One beautiful little meadow at 
Powick, near the road to the Old Hills, contained this year hundreds 
of plants, but without trespassing unnecessarily on that, I have found 
an adjacent strip of barren, thistly pasture, which gives me all I want 
at present.
In July last, a curious and pretty appearance presented 
itself to my view in a large pasture at Maddresfield, three miles east 
of Great Malvern.
The field was covered with bushes of Genista

tinctoria, brilliant with its golden flowers, among which, and overtop- 
ping them with pure white, densely clustered lunbels, grew abundance 
of CEnanthe pimpinelloides most luxuiiantly, while the green turf 
itself was bedecked with numerous plants of Spiraea Filipendula, whose 
tall stems trembled with their panicled loads of rose-tinged blossoms.
This was a perfectly dry and hilly meadow.
But O^.
peucedanifolia,* of Smith, is really a marsh plant, and I 
have never found it except in wet places, or low flat meadows close 
to water, but as far as my observation goes, always fresh.
T have met 
with it abundantly in Longdon marshes, near Upton-on-Severn, in 
the Severn Ham at Tewkesbury, and on the banks of the Severn, 
Deerhurst, Gloucestershire, as well as on Kempsey Ham, below Wor- 
cester.
The Rev. Andrew Bloxam also finds it in a marshy spot on 
Bosworth Field, Leicestershire.
OE.
Lachenalii, though a marsh plant, has, however, quite a difle- 
rent habit from CE.
peucedanifolia.
It seems entirely confined to 
muddy ditches, absolutely growing in the water in many instances, 
and sending down its elongated vermiform tubercles so deep into the 
mud, that it is very difficult to get them out without breaking.
My 
fiiend, the Rev. Andrew Bloxam, incumbent of Twycross, Leicester- 
shire, well known for his botanical zeal and acumen, kindly invited 
me to gather the plant in his company this season, for I had it not 
near me to study ; and he took me to a lonely lane close to Sutton 
Wharf, on the Ashby canal, on the borders of Bosworth Field.
Here 
we found the plant growing abundantly in a muddy ditch, so deep, 
and half filled up with thorns, that it was exceedingly scratching 
work to the fingers to get up any number of specimens.
Although 
this was the latter end of August, I was surprised to find that the 
CEnanthe here located was only just coming into flower, while a month 
previously I had considerable difficulty in meeting with GE.
peuceda- 
nifolia even in fruit, so soon does it wither after flowering, and QPi.
pimpinelloides flowers constantly in June and July.
So that it ap- 
peared at once evident to me that the three plants could be kept dis- 
tinct by attention only to the period of their flowering; and Mr.
Bloxam concurred in this observation, remarking that Lachenalii 
remained in flower to the end of September.
This is worth noting, 
as botanists have generally completed their collecting stores before 
* According to Smith, Hooker and Babington, the CE.
peucedanifolia of Pollich, 
which name I should think it preferable to retain, though Mr. Ball calls it (E.
silai- 
folia, Bieberstein^ and Mr. Watson suggests that it should take the name of Smithii.
357 
that time.
To complete my knowledge of the subject, I determined 
on my return into Worcestershire to have a field-day at Longdon 
Marsh, near Upton-on-Severn, thinking possibly that Qi. Lachenalii 
might be found there, as I had seldom examined the marsh botanically 
so late as September, though within ray legitimate district.
I accord- 
ingly beat up the bushes between Malvern and Longdon the first 
week in September, but with no success near Longdon ; nor in a well 
known part of the marsh, where I had previously gathered many plants 
of CE.
peucedanifolia, was there the least appearance of Lachenalii.
At last I accidentally got into a wild lane almost unknown to me, be- 
tween Welland and Castlemorton, having very deep, muddy ditches 
on either hand, nearly filled up with an exuberant growth of Helo- 
sciadium nodiflorum ; and looking closely as I went along, a single 
umbel of an QEnauthe presented itself on the side of the ditch, which 
on getting up the root proved to be Lachenalii.
Finding myself now 
on the right scent, I got on the other side of the hedge, and here, in 
a ditch or deep furrow running across a neglected, very boggy pas- 
ture, I was delighted to perceive a whole host of the plant encamped, 
with banners displayed.
I quickly broke in upon their entrenchment, 
but they were all so deeply rooted in such a tenacious mud, that it 
was with great difficulty I could disentangle them from it, and secure 
my prisoners.
A farmer came up to me before I had finished my ope- 
rations, wondering what game I could have in view, and from him I 
learned that the spot was called the Welland Marshes.
I thus, how- 
ever, add CE nan the Lachenalii to my Malvern Flora, and to that of 
Worcestershire also, for 1 believe no other person has previously met 
with it in the county.
I now feel assured that the CEnanthes said to 
grow in salt marshes, and the muddy ditches on their confines, ought 
to be referred to Q^.
Lachenalii and not to pimpinelloides.
At all 
events, I now find those I have myself formerly gathered on the coast 
of Cardiganshire and Pembroke, as well as on Cromlyn Burrows, near 
Swansea, and Braunton Burrows, Devonshire, and which, from their 
very elongated roots, I was at the time dubious about, are all really 
referable to QE.
Lachenalii.
Having thus entered into detail on the different habitats of the three 
plants, I trust to be able to demonstrate their specific distinctness by 
an examination of their roots, to which T have paid particular atten- 
tion, and in illustration of this T refer to the annexed representations, 
sketched from plants just taken from their places of growth.
And 
here I would remark, that the general character of the root as thus 
exhibited can be decidedly depended upon ; for though its size and 
358 
length may be variable, according to the luxuriance and age of the 
plant, still in 05.
pinipinelloides the tubercles are always seated on 
evident stalks : those of GE.
peucedanifolia are invariably thick and 
sessile, more or less elliptical, and fleshy ; while those of CE.
Lache- 
nalii are long, slender, vermiform, thickening only towards the posterior 
end, and that very gradually.
Thus we may present these differences 
in a succinct form, which, in connexion with the cuts, will render the 
matter fully intelligible.

tubercles on lignose stalks, terminating in fibres.

By attending to the characters thus laid down, the root alone will 
be found perfectly discriminative in these three species ; and this is 
very remarkable, for cursorily noticed, Ch\.
pimpinelloides and CE.
peucedanifolia can scarcely be distinguished from each other except 
by a very nice eye, though there are other points of distinction to 
which I shall presently revert.
In an early stage of grow^th, the tu- 
bercles of pimpinelloides have very short stalks indeed, but these 
rapidly extend themselves around the plant, so that in maturity then 
are far removed from it, and are broken off unless the plant is takey 
up with care.
In perfection they are marbled with scales, often be- 
come angular from obstacles they meet with in progressing through 
the soil, and have a pleasant nutty taste.
I should conjecture these 
tubercles to form receptacles of nutriment to keep up the growth of 
the plant in those very dry meadows where it grows, for at the close 
of summer the majority of them are found shrivelled up, dry, and ex- 
hausted.
The tubercles of peucedanifolia vary considerably in thick- 
ness and length, even on the same root, but they are totally different 
from those of QÂ£.
pimpinelloides in their constantly sessile character, 
and though some of them are as slender as those of QC.
Lachenalii, there 
are always others in company with them thick and fleshy, elliptical, 
and suddenly swollen towai'ds their base.
Sometimes they are so sud- 
denly incrassated, as to assume a pyriform aspect.
The tubercles of 
CE.
Lachenalii, on the other hand, are all uniformly slender and ver- 
miform,* imperceptibly thickening towards their termination, and 
359 
abundantly fibrous.
In luxuriant specimens they are four or five 
inches long, and almost as thick and numerous as in the bird's-nest

orchis.
But though shorter in smaller plants, their long, slender cha- 
racter is always remarkable.
Another curious trait in the root of this 
360 
species is, that the tubercles are occasionally branched, secondary 
tubercles arising from the primary ones, and they are often studded 
with points from which fibres originate, which gives them a striated 
appearance.

I have been anxious to represent and define the roots of these 
CEnanthes, as much doubt has been thrown upon the subject, and 
these organs are too frequently unnoticed by British botanists.
But 
361 
I shall now attend to the general appearance and description of the 
plants, so as to found our discrimination on other points, which will 
settle the matter for the future.
Mr. Ball has given an elaborate Latin description of our three allied 
species of ffinanthe in the ' Annals of Natural History,' but there are

some important omissions, and the differences between each are not so 
clearly contrasted as to remain fixed upon the mind.
But he had not 
then seen the root of CE.
Lachenalii, and considers the disposition and 
362 
proportion of the leaves as much to be depended upon, but doubts 
the constancy of the form of the root, while, in fact, the reverse is the 
case.
I shall therefore touch upon the distinctions between CE.
pim- 
pinelloides and CE.
peucedanifolia.
Both appear so similar when 
growing, that a practised eye only can detect the difference between 
them without looking at the radical leaves.
But these, when not 
withered up, are very discriminative, for in Ql^.
pimpinelloides they 
are bi-pinnate, the pinnulse broadly elliptical or wedge-shaped, so 
deeply cut as to be almost pinnatifid, the segments very acute, mucro- 
nate, with a broadly sheathing, membranous petiole; while in GE.
peucedanifolia there are mostly no radical leaflets at all, or if any, 
they are ascending (not extending Jtorizontanp,3iS in pimpinelloides), 
and they agree entirely with the stem-leaves, viz., bi-pinnate, with 
acute, entire lanceolate or linear pinnae.
But the stem-leaves are ex- 
ceedingly variable in aspect, both in pimpinelloides as well as peuce- 
danifolia ; frequently they are only simply pinnate, and then the pinnaj 
are very long, nari'ow, linear and acute.
Sometimes the radical leaves 
of pimpinelloides have their pinnae almost as narrow as those of the 
stem-leaves, and then without examining the root it becomes very dif- 
ficult to distinguish it at first sight from CE.
peucedanifolia.
The 
upper leaves of both are simply pinnate.
No dependance can be 
placed on the general involucra, which, though stated by Smith to be 
"numerous" in CE.
pimpinelloides, are so far from being so, that scarce- 
ly one specimen in twenty has any at all, or only a single setaceous leaf- 
let; sometimes, however, an involucre of five or six unequal leaflets is 
present.
On the other hand, CE.
peucedanifolia, said by Smith to have 
no general involucre, has very frequently one, and sometimes several 
leaflets at the base of its umbel.
The umbels in pimpinelloides have 
from six to fourteen I'ays, while those of peucedanifolia have never 
more than eight ;* the unfbellules are many-flowered, very dense, when 
in perfection forming globular heads ; the external florets, which have 
very large petals, unequal in size, are barren, on long pedicels, the 
internal fertile florets on short swollen callous ones.
In CE.
peuceda- 
nifolia the internal pedicels are not at all swollen, nor is the fruit so 
densely clustered.
This latter is a stouter and taller plant than pim- 
pinelloides ; often exceeding a yard in height, with a thick, striated; 
hollow stem, which, after flowering becomes incapable of supporting

inconspicuous that it is difficult to detect it.
The exterior florets of 
llie imibellule are elevated upon long pedicels, and being barren, drop 
off, leaving only the dense, fertile, almost sessile florets of the centre, 
whose divergent styles become very stiff and bristly, and though 
white at first, assume ultimately a bright vinaceous tint.

has altogether vanished from the scene long before QE.
Lachenalii 
appears.
(K.
Lachenalii varies much in size according to the place where it 
grows, but rises to upwards of four feet in height if growing in a deep 
ditch, the stem striated and fistulose.
The radical leaves, when pre- 
sent, are discriminative, and very different from those of pimpinelloi- 
des ; they are simply pinnate, with pinnatifid, bifid, or trifid pinnae, 
their segments broadly lanceolate, entire, blunt.
The radical and 
stem-leaves are all on long, membranous petioles, and sometimes the 
latter in small specimens quite agree in character with the former, but 
in general they are simply pinnate, the pinnae linear-lanceolate, very 
acute ; the lower stem-leaves are sometimes bipinnate, or rather the 
pinnae have their segments bifid or trifid, but the upper leaves are 
always simply pinnate.
The general involucre consists of six, seven, 
or eight linear leaflets, often attended by a simple elongated leaf, but 
it is by no means constantly present, though more generally so than 
in the two other species.
The umbels consist of five to sixteen 
spreading radii on long peduncles ; the umbellules consist of nume- 
rous florets, the external ones barren, on long pedicels, the internal 
ones crowded together, almost sessile.

late leaflets, paler and membranous at the edges, shorter than the

Mr. Babington in his Manual refers the CE.
pimpinelloides of Smith, 
in ' English Botany,' 347, to this, and I believe that (E.
Lachenalii is 
there really represented, though the root is not fully given.* In the 
'English Flora ' it is likely enough that CE.
Lachenalii and pimpinel- 
loides were confounded together, but from Smith's statement of the ra- 
dical leaves being "doubly pinnate," and the leaflets "wedge-shaped 
with one or two notches," I conclude he had pimpinelloides at least 
* I have carefully compared specimens of CE.
Lachenalii with this plate, and there- 
fore so far coincide with ^Ir. Babington.

partly in view.
I have not, hovrever, seen his specimens.
His salt 
marsh localities, doubtless, belong to OE.
Lachenalii ; but this may 
now be easily cleared up.
I have delayed to speak of the fruit of the three species, thinking it 
better to present their peculiarities iu juxta-position, as I think it will 
then clearly appear that from this character also, the species can be 
accurately discriminated as distinct from each other.
Fruit cylindrical, sharply ribbed, of nearly equal breadth through- 
out, the base callous aud incrassated ; styles nearly straight, di- 
vergent only at the apex, arching at the extremities, as long as 
the diachenium.

pimpinelloides.
Fruit oblong, contracted below, deeply furrowed, the base callous 
but not enlarged ; styles widely divergent from the very base, 
and longer than the diachenium.

Fruit small, inversely conical, with thin prominent ribs, compressed, 
always narrow at the base but not callous ; styles divergent, 
rather incrassated, only half the length of the diachenium.
â€” CE.
Lachenalii.
In all three species the diachenium is crowned with the erect 
pointed persistent calyx.
The length of the styles in (E.
pimpinelloi- 
des and CE.
peucedanifolia gives the fruit in those species a peculiar 
bristly appearance, a character scarcely noticeable in CE.
Lachenalii ; 
and while in pimpinelloides the diachenia are rigidly stiff and erect, 
closely pressed together, in Lachenalii they are comparatively lax, and 
by no means closely in contact.
Still, the flowers in the umbellules of 
the latter are so numerous, that pressing in some degree upon each 
other, the fruit is affected thereby, and thus the diachenium is often 
narrow and elliptical.
It is constantly smaller than in either of the 
preceding species.
The sketches of the finit will show their distin- 
guishing characters, so that they cannot be mistaken.
I trust the British botanist will now be able satisfactorily to identify 
the three species of CEnanthe I have here examined, so that there can 
be no further dispute or misunderstanding on the subject.
I have 
tested them in all their details, aud their distinctness surely cannot be 
doubted.
There is certainly a general similarity in the foliage of all, 
but the radical leaves of CE.
Lachenalii are very different to those of 
CE.
pimpinelloides.
I rely, however, on these three points to prove 
my case : popularly the time of flowering, so different in each ; prac- 
tically the shape of the roots, which is always available ; and on the 
principles of botanical science, the form of the fruit ; â€” all now ascer- 
tained facts of distinctiveness, which combined together, must carry 
conviction to every mind open to receive the truth.
365 
With regard to the distribution of the plants under review, if I am 
correct in my surmises, founded on my own gatherings, CE.
Lachenalii 
will be found pretty generally located in the salt marshes of the coast, 
as well as in deep, muddy ditches of the interior, and according to 
Smith, on Mr. Mackay's authority (but mistaken for CE.
pimpinel- 
loides) extending far into Scotland.
Mr. Ball states that he has re- 
ceived it from the coast of Galloway, one of the localities Smith men- 
tions.
I have myself observed it on the Welsh coast, from Swansea 
to Borth morass, six miles north of Aberystwith.
CE.
peucedanifolia 
is certainly principally a denizen of marshes in the interior country, 
and thus in the midland counties it is of more frequent occurrence 
than either of the other species here mentioned, though not so abun- 
dant in its localities.
I find it rather plentiftil in Gloucestershire and 
Worcestershire.
CE.
pimpinelloides appears to be truly local, though 
abundantly developed where it does occur, at least in favourable sea- 
sons.
My friend, the Rev. A Bloxam, who has botanized extensively 
in Leicestershire, tells me he has never seen it there, and I have not 
detected it in any of my excursions in Wales.
It is absent also from 
the Rev. W.
A. Leighton's * Flora of Shropshire.' Yet in the dry, 
hilly meadows about Powick and Maddresfield, towards the Malvern 
Hills, Worcestershire, it luxuriates on the red marl, and on the same 
soil at Forthampton, Gloucestershire.
The true plant has also been 
shown me by Mr. Buckman, of Cheltenham, growing at Marl Hill, 
near that town.
It will now probably be found in other dry, inland 
spots when diligently sought.

Correction of certain errors in Dr. Balfour'' s communication to the 
Botanical Society of Glasgow.
By G.
A. Walker Arnott, 
L.L.D., F.L.S., &c.
In the last number of the ' Phy tologist ' (Phytol.
ii.
319), are two 
statements rather startling to the systematic botanist, and which per- 
haps you will allow me to correct ; they are the more remarkable as 
coming from one who holds a public appointment as teacher of 
Botany.
The learned Professor states that he exhibited to the Botanical So- 
ciety of Glasgow specimens of several species of Cypripedium from 
various parts of the world, among which were some from Brazil ; and 
on the authority of Steudel's * Nomenclator Botanicus,' asserts that 
there are four species natives of that country: of course, as Steudel 
gives no descriptions, and as Dr. Lindley appears to be ignorant of 
so many, Dr. Balfour must, before affirming this, have consulted the 
' Flora Fluminensis,' which is the original authority for all these spe- 
cies ; but on the other hand, I feel somewhat puzzled how any one 
who knows what a Cypripedium is, did not at once perceive that only 
one of the four can belong to the genus ; the other three exhibiting 
the truly tropical forms of Orchidaceae.
The only true Brazilian spe- 
cies is probably the same as that in Von Martins' herbarium, noticed 
by Dr. Lindley, and supposed not to be distinct from what has been 
likewise found in Guiana.
Two species only can therefore be said to 
grow in South America, on the eastern side of the Andes.
The geo- 
graphical distribution usually assigned to the genus can therefore be 
scarcely said to be invalidated by these aberrant and very little known 
species, for although six are enumerated as natives of tropical Ame- 
rica, four belong either to the Andes of Peru, or to the north of the 
isthmus of Panama.
But the other statement contains an important error in medical 
Botany, in so far as Dr. Balfour refers the Mudar plant of India to 
Calitropis gigantea of Brown.
Various memoirs have been written 
on the subject, particularly in India, but since 1835, when Dr. Wight 
took up the subject in the Madras 'Literary and Scientific Journal,' 
p. 69, the old hypothesis of C.
gigantea being the Mudar plant, has 
not been revived till now, by Dr. Balfour.
The properties of the two 
are different.
The difference between the species was in some 
measure pointed out in the ' Proceedings of the Calcutta Medical and 
Physical Society ' for 1824, but Dr. Wight, by giving a figure of the 
Mudar plant, with dissections of the gynostigium, enabled all to com- 
307 
prehend the distinction more clearly.
Dr. Hamilton, at one time, 
gave it the barbarous name of C.
Mudari, but afterwards suspected it 
to be the same as C.
procera, of Persia.
Dr. Wight, in the paper 
already referred to, follows Hamilton in calling it C.
procera, probably 
through inadvertency, as in his MSS.
of the East India Asclepiadese, 
left by him in Scotland, and published in the ' Contributions to the 
Botany of India,' it is called C.
Hamiltonii, and is accompanied with 
the remark that the Persian C.
procera, judging from Andrew's figure, 
appeared very distinct ; a supposition which has been since verified.
While on this subject I may allude to the little confidence one must 
place in a mere catalogue of names, such as Steudel's 'Nomenclator 
Botanicus.' In that work, published in 1840, only three species of 
Calitropis are mentioned, and all are said to be natives of India, while 
six years previously Dr. Wight described from India five species, the 
Persian one forming a sixth.
The C.
acia of Hamilton and Steudel 
is the C.
herbacea of Wight, or Asclepias herbacea of Roxburgh's 
* Flora of India.'

On the country of Cliococca tenuifolia.
By G.
A. Walker Arnott, 
L.L.D., F.L.S., &c.
Although the * Phytologist ' is principally devoted to British 
Botany, still you wWX perhaps allow me to allude to the Cliococca 
tenuifolia of Mr. Babington, published in vol.
xix.
of the Linnean 
Society's Transactions (p.
33, t.
iii.).
Mr. B., on the authority of 
the Cambridge gardens, states it to be a native of New Holland, but 
any one acquainted with South American Botany will at once recog- 
nize its affinity with Linum selaginoides {Lam.).
Of this Chamisso 
and Schlechtendal in the ' Linnaea,' i.
p. 67, describe the ten hard 
nuts of the fruit.
But the most complete account of it is by St.
Hilaire, in his 'Flora Brasiliensis Merid.' i.
p. 130 and 131, published 
in 1825.
St. Hilaire there points out the mistake into which De Can- 
dolle had fallen as to the colour of the petals, which are not yellow, 
but " albida vel rufescentia, apice quandoque rosea ;" and in the de- 
scription of the fruit, demonstrates that this very species and some 
analogous ones, reveal the true structure of that organ in the order 
368 
Linaceae, Only two points of difference occur between Mr. Babing- 
ton's description and St. Hilaire's : Mr. B.
says the petals are imbri- 
cated, while St. Hilaire describes the entire genus with contorted 
petals ; St. Hilaire says that the petals are " in unguem attenuata ;" 
Mr. B.
says that they are " baud unguiculata." Notwithstanding 
these discrepancies, there can be no rational doubt of the identity of 
the two plants, and this induces a belief that there must be some eiTor 
in the supposition that Mr. B.'s plant was raised from seeds gathered 
in the interior of New Holland, as it is only known in herbaria as a 
native of the southern parts of Brazil, Monte Video, Chili and perhaps 
Peru, and does not, T believe, occur in any collection from Australia.

An Account of the Bog Lands of Sussex.
By F.
A. Malleson, Esq.
On examining a geological chart of the county of Sussex, it will be 
seen that there is an outlying stratum of sandstone, known as Shank- 
lin sand, running parallel with the South Downs in their whole extent, 
at the distance of a mile or two ; and with an average breadth of two 
or four with us, though much more at the continuation of the same 
formation in Surrey.
This is so distinct a feature of the country that 
it cannot fail to attract the notice of every traveller of common obser- 
vation, who approaches the hills from that central tract of the great 
chalk basin, denominated the Weald, or Wild, and who perceives that 
he must necessarily cross a sandy or a boggy district.
In most places 
this sand is the soil of heaths, both hilly and level ; in others that of 
bog, marsh or quagmire, and in the alluvial districts of good pasture 
land.
The formation and progress of a bog is a subject of considerable 
interest, especially when it is remembered that it is always naturally 
in a state of increase.
In the uncultured territories of the vast conti- 
nent of America, a marsh is frequently originated by the accidental 
fall of a few trees into some stream that had hitherto flowed uninter- 
rupted through the forest.
The waters, thus obstructed, overflow and 
stagnate beyond the banks, rotting and decomposing much vegetable 
matter incapable of enduring such an excess of moisture.
However 
indispensable the influence of pure, running water may be to some 
369 
forms of vegetable life, nothing is more pernicious than a putrid pool ; 
those shrubs and trees, therefore, which are thus attacked, root and 
branch, perish and fall, adding their decaying limbs and leaves to 
tlie increase of the destructive powers now in full operation.
Minor 
streams overflow in the same neighbourhood, acted upon by similar 
or collateral causes ; and where a luxuriant verdure once gladdened 
the woods, the lapse of a few years shows extensive tracts covered 
with blackening vegetation, and emitting those unhealthy exhalations 
which the naturalist finds it his best interest seriously to guard against.
But, once formed, this marsh has become a fit soil for the propagation 
of plants peculiarly adapted to it, which rise and fall in their appoint- 
ed seasons, gradually, though slowly, increasing the thickness of the 
mass of decayed vegetation.
In course of time, the land becomes of 
too solid a texture, by reason of the deposit both of carbon and of 
mineral soil from chemical and alluvial causes, to support its old de- 
pendants, and a new race slowly springs into life, â€” in our climate 
principally heaths ; in South America, chiefly species of Cactus, and 
enormous grasses and Cyperaceae.
These are precisely the causes 
distinctly seen in operation in some of the finest districts of Ross and 
Inverness.
The usual composition, therefore, of the peat of our fens and 
marshes is Sphagnum, and every aquatic plant, the inferior layers of 
which are always densest, on account of the great weight of the super- 
incumbent mass.
Such extreme density, indeed, is attained in some 
cases, as to form a substance convertible into ornaments resembling 
jet, and susceptible of a fine polish.
1 have seen beautiful sections, 
though only six to eight feet in thickness, of the peat soil in the 
great Amberley Wild Brock, in this vicinity, in which the fineness 
of the texture of the lower peat, clearly demonstrates the efilcacy of 
the decomposing process which has acted on it for centuries.
A key 
to the rate of the increase of bogs might be afforded by the discovery 
which a labourer of Nutbourne made several years since, of an ancient 
British lance-head, constructed of copper, buried to the depth of seven 
feet in a marsh near Pulborough.
This relic was lately in the pos- 
session of a gentleman at Storrington, since deceased, and has since 
passed into other hands.
The depth of eight feet would give a very 
slow rate of increase indeed, far less than that of twenty inches in 
sixteen years, assigned by Mr. Jenyns to the turf of the Cambridge- 
shire fens, and w hich seems to be unaccountably rapid ; but it must 
also be taken into account that this peat marsh has pretty frequent 
demands made upon its contents by the turf-cutters, as well as by the 
Vol. II.
2 y 
370 
farmers who cut the long sedges {Carex ampullaâ‚¬ea,paniculata, tere- 
tiuscula and axillaris), for an admirable covering for stacks.
There is every reason for believing that a process similar to that 
described above, has operated in the formation of every one of the 
" brooks " in our vicinity ; especially the Wild Brook, in which huge 
trunks of trees, the relics of remote ages, are continually being dug 
up to this day.
In their remains, indeed, we perceive further cause 
for the creation of a bog, as the deposition of silt and disorganized 
vegetation in the spaces between the prostrate trunks would have 
afforded a ready nucleus for fresh deposits.
It was here that the in- 
teresting discovery was made of that huge boat, of ancient British 
manufacture, which formed, till lately, the first object of attention 
in entering the gateway of the British Museum.
A section of the ground usually presents, first, vegetable mould ; 
then, from four to five feet, and in many places more, of peat, contain- 
ing considerable masses of decayed vegetable matter, consisting of 
leaves and trunks of trees.
A dark blue clay or silt is then reached, 
containing fresh-water shells, the deposits of ancient floods.
A finer 
clay follows ; and then the main foundation of sandstone appears.
(Manteirs ' Geology of the S.E. of England').
In those parts of our county which are watered by the Arun, the 
Cuckmere, Ouse and Rother, all of which annually overflow their 
banks, and lay the surrounding country under water, a very slow and 
gradual rise takes place in the soil, amounting to an average of no 
more than one half or one quarter of an inch per annum.
It is well 
known how considerable a mass of sand, clay, &c., is carried down 
the stream of every river.
If, as is the case with the river Po, the 
waters are always confined within their proper channel, without ever 
flooding the land, the deposit takes place in the bed itself, and be- 
comes an incessant source of trouble and weariness to the inhabitants 
of its banks, who are periodically obliged in self defence to dyke up 
the river, the stream's level being already more than fifteen feet above 
the level of the land which it traverses.
On the other hand, if an an- 
nual inundation regulaily takes place, the consequence is a very slow 
rise of the land, so slow as to be almost imperceptible in the life of a 
man, though certainly considerable enough to force itself at last into 
notice in certain instances.
One case under my own observation is 
that of a farm house in Hardham, erected many years ago, in a situa- 
tion fairly out of the reach of the annual flood, but now, in conse- 
quence of the insidious aggressions of yearly deposits of less than half 
an inch, well drenched almost every winter, the kitchen and its depen- 
371 
dencies, with the neat little parlour, all float in streams none of the 
bluest.
A gentleman of this neighbourhood, whose elegant garden bor- 
ders the Arun at a height of eight feet above the summer level of the 
river, discovered in the high flood of 1843, that his gay parterres were 
at last within the reach of the strongest assaults of his encroaching foe, 
and has added a foot and a half to his garden wall, to be placed above 
high-water-mark.
Should a railroad ever be carried across our levels, 
it will not be amiss to keep several feet clear of the high-water-mark, 
out of regard to the probable emergencies of future generations.
A botanist may be allowed to express his regrets at the gradual 
merging of that richly prolific bog-land into pastures.
Where mile 
after mile of a wild, unchecked vegetation waved and rustled in the 
wind, all rank with that freedom which the plant enjoys as well as the 
animal, brilliant with those gaudy flowers, which, by the capricious 
allotment of Nature adorn the inaccessible marsh even more profusely 
than more attainable spots, and where tall sedges and rushes shared 
the land with the delicate cranberry, â€” there, long, formal ditches have 
been sliced out in all directions ; little by little, the peculiar Flora of 
the bogs has disappeared, and the farmer calculates his profits, and 
the landlord collects his rents, out of those territories which erewhile 
profited none but the humble turf-cutter and our curious tribe.
The 
Pulborough brooks, now covered with a luxuriant herbage, retain no 
signs of having once been a bog, but the existence of a rather coarse 
sedge {Carex riparia), which alone has survived.
The Amberley 
Wild Brook, an immense tract for a county like Sussex, is feeling the 
effects of deep drainage, and supports considerable herds of cattle.
I have never heard here of that plan being adopted which is so ex- 
tensively carried on in the fens of Lincolnshre.
I mean the process 
of claying.
Deep holes are dug through the peat until they reach 
the clay, which is then thrown up, and scattered over the swampy 
land till a firm ground is obtained, which eventually becomes fit for 
cultivation.
The wages of this work are 15s.
a week.
The Nutbourne peat-marsh is well entitled by its richness to be 
the object of a botanical excursion.
It is a mile from Pulborough 
and very near Heath Mill, a long valley bordered on two sides by hills 
deeply clothed with the finest heath.
I wish it were some other than 
the common Erica cinerea, but this and E.
Tetralix are the only 
Sussex species, though why we should have none of the Cornish spe- 
cies too I cannot tell.
This marsh and others in the vicinity are 
known to be dangerous to persons not well acquainted with them.
The ground is so treacherous, and the imperfect path-ways are so per- 
372 
plexing, that none should venture there too boldly.
Cattle are repeat- 
edly straying into the midst of the bog, supporting themselves on the 
tussocks, but have occasionally sunk in, and I think they only owe 
their more frequent impunity to the possession of four feet, on two of 
which they can balance themselves, while the others act as pioneers.
Bipeds are less fortunate.
On one occasion, after a long afternoon of 
" peripatetic " philosophy among these mazy marshes, when twilight 
was advancing, I found six yards of very doubtful soil indeed in- 
tervening between dry land and me, with the only alternative of 
boldly crossing it, or retreating amongst dangers not so light as to be 
encountered in the dark without careful deliberation.
This was a di- 
lemma such as the practical botanist may often expect.
" Well," 
thought T, "perhaps Guizot's ' Recta brevissima omnium' is after all, 
preferable to the ' Sat cito, si sat bene ' of the Lord Chancellor," and 
with a forward dash, which made the dingy bog quake for yards 
around, four of the lightest and longest strides carried me safe over, 
though with some remains of a natural apprehension, and a good be- 
spattering.
It is a good rule to remember, in botanizing in such 
places, that Coraarum palustre denotes unsafe, and Carex flava a 
secure ground.
The first object of note in a walk hither, will be the rare Carex 
axillaris, first observed by Mr. BoiTer,on a ditch-bank, in the meadow 
adjoining Heath Mill-pond.
I believe it is known but in one other 
spot in Sussex.
This whole neighbourhood may be considered rich 
in species of Carex.
With C.
axillaris is found abundance of the 
handsome C.
pseudo-Cyperus ; C.
paniculata and teretiuscula form 
their great tussocks, the accumulation of repeated decay, along the 
banks of the pond, and about the bogs C.
ampullacea abounds, and is 
easily recognized by its slender, hoary leaves.
It is not unlikely that 
C. filiforrais may be found here too, as Mr. Borrer has pointed out to 
me, in places unfortunately inaccessible to us, clumps of leaves, much 
resembling, at a distance, those of this Carex.
I hope to explore the 
spot when T find the proper means of doing so with safety.
Carex 
flava and ffideri are both here, and in their wild state I always find 
the character of the barren spike sufficiently plain to distinguish the 
species ; though in Botanic Gardens, it seems, the effect of culture is 
to confound the species by making the male spikes either sessile or 
stalked indifferently.

THE PHYTOLOGIST.
Botanical Notes for 1845.
By George Stacey Gibson, Esq.
The following notes made during last summer, unconnected as they 
are, and put down at the time with no intention of publication, I have 
since thought contain a few facts which may prove interesting to some 
of the readers of the ' Phytologist,' and therefore I shall make no apo- 
logy for sending them, in their present form, for insertion.
Helmsley is a pleasant little town situated about twenty miles from 
York ; near it, is Duncombe Park, the seat of Lord Feversham, the 
scenery of which is peculiarly diversified and beautiful, and the ge- 
neral aspect of the country is one of much interest to the lover of Na- 
ture.
There are several ruins around, among which Rievaulx Abbey 
stands pre-eminent.
The views near this fine edifice are very impos- 
ing, and situated as it is, like many similar ones, in a rich valley, with 
the hills rising around in the form of an amphitheatre, their sides co- 
piously clothed with the foliage of extensive woods, this must be con- 
sidered one of the most striking ruins remaining in the country.
The 
celebrated Kirkdale cave, in which so many bones of hyaenas and 
other animals, extinct in this country, were discovered some years ago, 
is also situated in this neighbourhood ; there is little now to be 
seen in it, and 1 believe it is closed.
Near Helmsley was formerly a well-known locality for Cypripedium 
Calceolus, and when there I took some pains to make inquiry respect- 
ing it, and had the weather permitted, fully intended to have explored 
the locality myself.
This is in a woody glen, about three miles from 
the town, near the rise of a small stream which runs through it.
Some years ago it grew there rather plentifully, but from the rapacity 
of some individuals it has been nearly exterminated, and last year 
only one plant of it was seen.
This year the place had not been 
much searched, but none had then been found, so that in a few years 
at least, we may expect this beautiful native of our northern woods 
will be quite eradicated ip another of its few remaining localities, 
which is the more to be regretted, as it arises, in great measure, from 
that selfish desire which cannot be too strongly deprecated, on the 
Vol. II.
2 z

part of some botanists to possess themselves of every specimeu within 
their reach, regardless alike of those who may come after them, and 
of the preservation of the plant.
This practice, if carried on, as it has 
been of late years, will soon have the same eflFect on others of the 
rarities which now ornament our fields and woods, as it has already 
had on this, and some others of our most interesting plants.
The importance attached to having specimens with the root, very 
much increases this danger; and unless persons can be sufficiently dis- 
interested sometimes to dispense with a perfect specimen, rather than 
injure the locality of the plant, it argues very strongly of the selfish- 
ness which is too often apparent, even among professed lovers of Na- 
ture, whether in an individual or collective character ; professed, I 
must call them, as their love appears rather to attach to the posses- 
sion of a complete collection, than to Nature herself.
But I return 
fi'om this digression into which the subject has led me, and which I 
feel to be a caution specially needed at the present time.
Another locality of Cypripedium was near Rievaulx Abbey, but it 
does not appear to have been seen there for many years.
The woods, 
however, still present some choice rarities, among which may be no- 
ticed Epipactis ensifolia, which grows plentifully, also Ophrys apifera 
and muscifera, one or two Pyrolas, &c.
The old man who has care 
of the terrace is very particular about some of these plants, placing 
sticks by them, &c.
and was at first rather angry at my gathering one, 
but finding it was not done, as often is the case with visitors, care- 
lessly, just to be looked at and thrown away, he became very civil, 
pointed out several plants of which he wished to know the names, and 
allowed me to collect as many as I desired.
Near the ancient town of Richmond, I have simply to noticÂ£, that 
on the remains of some of its numerous relics of antiquity, and espe- 
cially on the massive walls of its castle, Linaria Cymbalaria was 
growing abundantly in situations where it was very unlikely to have 
been planted by the hand of man ; this could not but lead to the con- 
clusion, that although in many localities it is only naturalized, yet 
that it may really be a native of this country, and I think observation 
upon it here, would lead others to a similar opinion, while there re- 
quires care not to be hasty in admitting doubtful plants into our 
Flora, as has been very much the case lately, and even those not na- 
turalized ; perhaps, on the other hand we should not be too ready to 
consider any plant merely naturalized, because it is so in some places.
In a wood near Cotherstone, I gathered Pyrola minor abundantly ; 
and in spending a few hours at the High Force, in Teesdale, the 
375 
scene of our interesting rambles the previous summer, I noticed se- 
veral of the Hieracia in flower.
This is probably the richest district 
in England for this tribe of plants, and a further examination of their 
different forms here, would probably lead to this difficult genus being 
better understood.
Among them, besides the common ones, were H.
rigidum, Lawsoni, Lapeyrousii, &c.
Though the two last-named species sometimes rather resemble each 
other, I cannot at all doubt the permanence of their specific diffe- 
rences.
They grow near together, and in similar situations, yet still 
preserve their characters, and these are even more strongly developed 
by cultivation, as has been proved by my friend James Backhouse, of 
York, who has had plants of them in his garden for a considerable 
time.
The grass recently called Poa Parnellii was in full perfection, 
but I feel fully persuaded that it is merely a variety of P.
nemoralis.
Equisetum umbrosum was growing abundantly near Winch Bridge, 
but I am informed that the fertile stems were very scarce in the spring.
Its peculiar habit renders it easily distinguishable fi:om any other spe- 
cies.
I had no opportunity to visit the locality of Alsine uliginosa, 
neither have I heard that any one has done so during the summer, 
but had rather hoped that it might have been discovered in some new 
situation.
Woodsia ilvensis was gathered from one of the plants we 
noticed last year, on the upper ridge of rocks at Falcon Glints.
But I must leave this interesting locality and proceed.
On the banks of Ulleswater, near Pooley Bridge, grows.
Ranunculus 
Flammula, B.
reptans, presenting an appearance materially different 
jfrom the usual form of Flammula, so as to give some reason for sup- 
posing it a distinct species, but this seems to consist chiefly in the 
very small size of the plant, especially of the flower.
Near Stock 
Gill Force, a picturesque waterfall at Ambleside, is a good locality.
Impatiens Noli-me-tangere has long been known to grow there, and it 
is still found abundantly, apparently wild, though it is difficult to tell 
when plants so easily propagated may have been introduced.
It 
grows on the steep sides of the Gill, both above and below the path 
near the mill.
In the same woody glen I gathered Festuca Calamaria, 
Poly podium Phegopteris, Dryopteris, &c.
Hymenophyllum Wilsoni 
is also found there, as well as near several other waterfalls among the 
lakes, as Scale Force, Lodore, and clothing the sides of the steep 
rocks at the curious fall of Dungeon Gill, which is embosomed in the 
romantic valley of Great Langdale.
At Keswick my information is chiefly borrowed, but I give it, be- 
cause it may stimulate botanists more fully to explore that rich neigh- 
376 
bourhood, which could scarcely fail to repay a diligent search, and 
thereby probably might be brought to light some hitherto hidden 
treasures, really natives of our island, and not naturalized exotics.
Besides this, the traveller would be amply rewarded for any toil, by 
the sight of such magnificent scenery as there abounds on every hand, 
and often most interesting where least visited by the rude hand of 
man.
There is a person at Keswick, named Wright, who has a good col- 
lection of plants, and considerable acquaintance with the localities of 
them, having employed herself in collecting specimens for sale, &c., 
and having visited many of the neighbouring places in company with 
botanists who have occasionally been in that part.
Any one would be 
repaid by making her a call, as she speaks from personal observation 
and knowledge.
She, as well as her father, who acts as a guide to 
strangers, has explored many of the recesses of the mountains, in 
which several rare species have been found.
Among these may be 
noticed Geranium nodosum, gathered a few years ago near Leathes 
Water pretty plentifully, but now, in consequence of the land having 
been cultivated, it is supposed to have disappeared from that spot, 
though probably it still grows in some adjacent situations.
Geranium striatum is found on the coast, near Flimby, Cumberland, 
plentifully, and apparently wild.
Rosa gracilis on the road-side pass- 
ing over Whinlatter towards Lorton.
Rosa cinnamomea ?
In Howrey field, Keswick.
This is so named 
by Wright, and if one can judge by dried specimens, greatly resembles 
that species, which has usually been considered to have such slender 
claims to be a native.
I hope this plant will be examined by bota- 
nists more carefully in this spot, as it deserves attention.
Lysimachia ciliata, which was first noticed by W.
Backhouse, be- 
tween Penrith and Wigton, has been discovered in a fresh locality at 
the foot of Warnel Fell, Cumberland, a wild situation, thus leaving no 
reasonable doubt of its being a native plant.
Saxifraga rotundifolia, 
too, was found a few years ago among the rocks in the vale of New- 
lands, but has since been searched for in vain.
Alchemilla alpina 
grows abundantly in Gatesgarth Pass, and sometimes approaches so 
near to the form called conjuncta, that I much doubt their being per- 
manently distinct.
Rumex alpinus was found sparingly on one of the mountains near 
Keswick.
Cypripedium Calceolus formerly grew in Legberthwaite, but is now 
thought to be extinct there.
377 
Juncus filiformis still grows plentifully in a meadow between the 
town and the lake at Keswick.
Asarum europaeum is found in small 
quantities in Troutbeck.
Meum athamanticum, scarce near Keswick ; 
Hieracium aurantiacum, vale of Newlands ; Euphorbia Cyparissias, 
in Ulpha ; Meconopsis cambrica and Spiraea salicifolia between 
Hawkshead and the Ferry ; Lobelia Dortraanna grows in most of the 
lakes ; Atropa Belladonna at Furness Abbey apd Arnside Tower, 
Also Pyrola secunda, Listera Nidus-avis and Oxyria reniformis, near 
Keswick.
Specimens of all the plants above enumerated were shown to me, 
from their respective localities, except Cypripedium.
Before concluding, I may just say, that Galium Vaillantii has reap- 
peared in this neighbourhood, and in several situations where it was 
not noticed last year, so that I cannot doubt that it will be found in 
other places, having been mistaken for G.
Aparine, from which I 
believe it is now generally allowed to be distinct.
The differences 
between the two plants, as pointed out in a former communication, 
are clear, and proved to be permanent by cultivation, which only 
renders them more striking.
I shall be glad to supply any botanical 
friends with a specimen of this interesting addition to our British 
Flora, as far as my stock will allow, and doubt not that another sea- 
son any deficiency can be made up.
I hope, too, that throughout 
the country botanists will search for it, and quite expect they will be 
rewarded by the discovery of it in many other places.

Remarks on Mr. Watson's Report of an Experiment which bears on 
the specific identity of the Cowslip and Primrose, (Phytol.
ii.
217).
By Edward S.
Wilson, Esq.
As no one else seems inclined to take up the subject of Mr. Wat- 
son's experiment, I venture to suggest an explanation, which, though 
merely hypothetical, may possibly prove to be the true one.
It appears to me that the whole question may be resolved into these 
two : â€” 
1. â€” Does the vegetable hybrid possess the power of reproduction ?
2. â€” If so, was the plant of which the seeds were sown by Mr.
Watson, a hybrid ?
378 
If these two questions can be answered in the affirmative, I do not 
see that the results of Mr. Watson's experiment are in any way in- 
consistent with the received law of species.
1. â€” As to the fertility of the vegetable hybrid, I confess that I am 
ignorant of any facts bearing upon the subject, but some of your cor- 
respondents will, no doubt, be better informed.
2. â€” The plant sown by Mr. Watson is said to have been P.
inter- 
media of the 'London Catalogue.' I cannot certainly say that this 
plant has fallen under my own observation ; but there is an oxlip, of 
no unfrequent occurrence in the cowslip-fields of this neighbourhood, 
to which I have always attached the name of " intermedia," from its 
significance.
It is found either with or without a scape, or with both 
forms of inflorescence proceeding from the same root.
In the form 
and pubescence of its calyx, the colour and expanse of its corolla, 
the shape of its leaves and the odour of its flowers, it is exactly half- 
way, so to speak, between the primrose and the cowslip.
It grows 
near the margin of the field, where there are primroses on the hedge- 
bank.
That this plant is a hybrid, I have scarcely any doubt, but 
whether it is identical with the subject of Mr. Watson's experiment, 
remains to be seen.
Supposing it granted, however, that Mr. Watson's plant was really 
a hybrid, and of course a fertile hybrid, we have to consider next, 
what would be its law of reproduction.
And here we must recollect 
that a hybrid is not a species, nor is it, properly speaking, a variety of 
any one species.
It is a variety compounded of two species, from nei- 
ther of which is it sepaiated by more than the usual range of variation.
Now, if we were to speculate, a priori, on the probable offspring of such 
a being (having respect to the two grand laws of generation, â€” that like 
produces like, within certain limits, â€” and that varieties tend to revert 
to their original types; assuming also that the parental influence might 
be unequally distributed through the reproductive system of the hy- 
brid), should we not say that it would consist of precisely such a 
series of forms as that obtained by Mr. Watson ?
The case seems to 
me analogous to that of a large family of children, where one child 
may be a copy of the father, a second of the mother, while the rest 
may exhibit various degrees of resemblance to both parents.
I am 
aware that the two cases are not exactly parallel, but the analogy be- 
tween them is sufficiently strong for the purpose of illustration.
Now I admit that all this is purely hypothetical.
Still, if it be not 
contradicted by facts, T think it may fairly be w eighed against other 
hypotheses of a more startling and improbable aspect.
If, indeed, 
379 
Mr. Watson had succeeded (and I am far from asserting that he may 
not) in raising the primrose from the seed of the cowslip, or the cow- 
slip from the seed of the primrose, we should then have been driven 
to the adoption of one or the other of his two alternatives : to wit, 
either that one species may generate another, or that the primrose and 
the cowslip are of one and the same species : the former implying 
that there is no such thing as species, in the strict sense of the term ; 
the latter, that if there is such a thing as species, no assignable 
amount of outward character will suffice for its determination.
But 
if it only appears that two distinct species have been elicited from the 
mongrel form which contained them both, I do not see that we are 
under any such compulsion.
Perhaps I may be allowed, in conclusion, to express my surprise 
that such experiments as that of Mr. Watson are not more frequent 
among those who have time and opportunity for the purpose.
Sure I 
am, that the conductors of such experiments are entitled to the grati- 
tude of all true botanists.
For, without depreciating the labours of 
those who are engaged in the demonstration of external differences, 
we must admit that those labours will be greatly assisted by a fre- 
quent reference to the test of reproduction.

Remarks on the usefulness of a Periodical devoted to British Botany ; 
suggested hy the ' Transactions of the Botanical Society of 
Edinburgh.^ By Hewett C.
Watson, Esq.
Perhaps the editor of the ^ Phy tologist ' will allow me to call the 
attention of its readers to the just-published parts of the ' Transac- 
tions of the Botanical Society of Edinburgh ;' and in connexion 
therewith, to suggest a remedy for a disadvantage which must have 
been felt by all who are interested in the progress of British Botany.
The first and second parts of the second volume of those " Transac- 
tions," I believe, have only just come out.
They are thus described 
in an advertisement circulated by post : 
"These parts, which occupy 174 pages of letter-press, with no fewer thau nineteen 
plates, contain many valuable papers on botanical subjects, selected from those read 
before the Society during the years 1843 and 1844 ; and the committee feel assured 
that they will be found well calculated to promote the Society's reputation as a scien- 
tific body." 
380 
In a general sense, the truth of this adv ertisement may be admitted, 
although some rather important part of the truth is suppressed.
The 
Transactions do include papers of botanical value ; and taken in the 
aggregate, the " papers " are such as deserve the eulogy pronounced 
upon them by the committee.
But it does not so surely follow that 
" the Society's reputation as a scientific body" will be much promoted 
by the republication, in 1845, of papers read before the Society in 
1843 and 1844, and then printed as articles in a periodical.
I cannot 
help thinking, that the republication of articles from old Nos. of a pe- 
riodical, ivithout change or correction, under the name of " Transac- 
tions," is not very creditable to a scientific society.
To say nothing of 
their being, as they must of course be, only such a selection from the 
real Transactions as the individual editor of a periodical had thought 
fit to print in his journal.
And moreover, taking into account the 
post-date (1845) of the republication, the act looks very like wilful 
injustice to other botanists, and an obstacle in the progress of science.
It is unjust to other botanists by its silent neglect of those works, 
in which more accurate elucidations of the same subjects had been 
published, between the original date of the articles and the post-date 
of their republication under the imposing name of "Transactions." 
It becomes also an obstacle in the progress of science, because it 
lays before botanists the earlier and less accurate, in place of the 
later and more accurate, knowledge on the subjects treated, and that, 
too, with all the impress and influence which the name of a scientific 
society can give.
In this way it is eminently calculated to mislead 
those who have not the leisure for collation and comparison of facts 
and dates in different periodicals ; or, it may be, not the means or in- 
clination to purchase all the works which would be required for the 
purpose of amending the false impressions conveyed to them.
That this is not mere conjecture, but a positive fact, may easily be 
shown by an example from the " Transactions." In plate IX.
we have 
some good representations of the leaves of "Robertsonian Saxifrages." 
The plate is intended to illustrate a paper firom the pen of Mr. Babing- 
ton, entitled, " On the difference between the Robertsonian Saxifrages 
of Ireland and those of the Pyrenees." The sole purport of this emi- 
nent botanist's paper, is to state that the leaves of the Pyrenean Saxi- 
frages {Sax. hirsuta, Sax. Geum, Sax. umhrosa), all differ in rather a 
remarkable manner from those of the Irish examples of the same 
species : namely, in the leaves of the Pyrenean plants being "crenate," 
while those of the Irish plants are " acutely crenate," " serrate," or 
" dentate." If this really had been a fact, it would have been a cu- 
381 
rious circumstance to account for.
But it so happens that the state- 
ments in Mr. Babington's paper are quite erroneous.
Some time 
back Mr. Andrews directed my attention to the true state of the case, 
and obligingly supplied me with Irish plants, which afforded the most 
unequivocal contradiction of Mr. Babington's (supposed) fact.
Spe- 
cimens in proof of this were laid before a meeting of the Botanical 
Society of London, in June, 1844; and the circumstance was expli- 
citly recorded in the ' Phytologist ' of the next month, July, 1844.
Moreover, I feel assured that Mr. Babington would not deny his own 
knowledge (or belief) of his supposition being untenable.
Notwith- 
standing this, however, the untenable supposition is republished, a 
year after, as though it were still an unquestioned fact !
This is not the only example of its kind which could be adduced 
from the * Transactions ' before me.
But one example will suffice 
whereon to found two questions, which may be answered by the " com- 
mittee," or for them by the readers of the ' Phytologist.' 1st.
â€” Is it 
conducive to the progress of science, that a statement should be re- 
published, without correction or qualification, after it had been proved 
totally inaccurate ?
2ndly.
â€” Is it justice to that botanist, by whose 
superior knowledge and more careful observation of Irish plants the 
mistake was corrected, that readers of a work published in 1845 
should be thus kept in ignorance of the correction made in 1844 ?
It appears to my judgment, that a postscript was necessary to the 
post-dated republication, in order to contradict or qualify any state- 
ments therein, which, at the date of republication were known to be 
inaccurate.
To republish statements, known to be erroneous, seems 
very little better than wilful mis-statement: there is suppression of 
truth, with statements that are not true.
The case selected is a decided one.
Mr. Babington's knowledge of 
British plants, and his general accuracy of observation, are unques- 
tionable.
And yet even this eminent botanist's own papers render 
the republished "Transactions" thus liable to objection.
Much 
more so may they become, in the case of other contributors less con- 
versant with British Botany.
In prosecuting scientific inquiries, any 
of us may commit occasional mistakes, and I have committed too 
many errors myself, to find fault with other parties simply on account 
of a mistake.
I beg therefore, to repeat, that no censure is here di- 
rected towards the error itself, but simply against the republication 
of statements ivithout correction, although known to be erroneous.
The preceding instance shows one bad effect which can hardly fail 
to result from the peculiar mode of publication adopted by the Cora- 
VOL.

mittee ot the Edinburgh Society.
I have next to mention another 
disadvantage which is strongly felt by many of those botanists who 
wish to keep up their knowledge of anything done or discovered in 
British Botany.
Papers on this subject are sent to the Edinburgh 
Society.
They are transmitted thence for insertion in the ' Annals 
of Natural History,' provided, I may presume, they chance to meet 
the approbation of the part-editor of that periodical who looks to the 
botanical department.
Readers who desire to see these botanical 
papers, must therefor eprocure the 'Annals,' the cost of which is thirty 
shillings a year.
Doubtless that is a well-conducted and valuable 
periodical, but the larger part of it being devoted to other subjects 
than Botany, any one who buys it for papers on British Botany, trans- 
mitted from the Edinburgh Society, must pay about six times the 
actual value of its botanical pages.
Should a botanist decline to pay 
this high price, he may procure the same pages, two or three years, 
after, under the name of ' Transactions,' that is, the periodical arti- 
cles of 1843 and 1844, may be bought collected as 'Transactions,' 
m 1845, â€” when their novelty is no more, and much of their interest 
or usefulness has evaporated under the rays of improved knowledge.
It is not alone in the Annals, that papers on British Botany are lost 
to many botanical eyes, through being dispersed amid a large quantity 
of more miscellaneous matter.
Such papers are occasionally sent by 
their authors direct to other similarly comprehensive periodicals ; the 
general result being, that we, residents in the country, must expend 
many pounds annually, before we can feel assured that all the current 
contributions to British Botany are likely to come under our eyes.
I 
consider and feel this to be a great disadvantage.
As a class, bota- 
nists are not those men of wealth and leisure, to whom money and 
time are, as the saying runs, " no object." On the contrary, I take it, 
that most of those who feel really interested in the progress of British 
Botany, would like well enough to find some one periodical becom- 
ing, as nearly as possible, a complete record and index of all that is 
done or discovered in British Botany, and which would still be 
brought within the reach of purses lightly filled.
To accomplish this, the periodical must be devoted exclusively to 
the Botany of the British Isles.
It must be published at a moderate 
price ; and the editor must himself take some pains to render it com- 
plete, as far as the progress of British Botany is concerned.
On the 
other side, English botanists should send thereto as many of their 
contributions as they could compress into a moderate space ; ab- 
stracts of all such papers as they might prefer to print in the larger 
383 
periodicals, being likewise still comraimicated to the one for British 
Botany, by their respective authors.
A periodical on this plan would of course be read by all British 
Botanists ; and it would be kept on their book-shelves, as an indis- 
pensible book of reference, a dictionary and history of the progress 
of British Botany.
The proprietor would be benefitted by the larger 
circulation ; the purchaser would find his account in the complete- 
ness and cheapness of the information conveyed in it ; and the con- 
tributors would know that any useful information which they had to 
give, would be pretty sure of meeting the eyes of those for whom it 
was written ; and that, by no other channel could they so well insure 
this important object.
The next point is, where to find the periodical ; and fortunately this 
appears within compass.
We have now two monthly periodicals de- 
voted W' holly to Botany.
The " London Journal of Botany " has not 
many articles on exclusively British Botany, though it affords excel- 
lent means for circulating papers of wider general interest through 
the botanical world.
The ' Phytologist,' on the other hand, is almost 
limited to British Botany, and might become quite so ; â€” it is pub- 
lished at a small price â€” it does already receive the chief portion of 
the most interesting papers on British Botany, and though not hither- 
to the complete record and index suggested, it goes already so far 
towards that desirable object, as to bring within prospect the possi- 
bility and likelihood of its attainment.
The additional space would 
be gained by the easy and required process of pruning down those exu- 
berant articles, whose purpose is little more than to say over again 
matters previously on record and sufiiciently well understood.
There 
are perhaps few papers, even those of the poorest contributions among 
the " rambles " and " visits " which do not include some facts or sug- 
gestions which might be worthy of record, if cleared out from the 
bushel of chaff within which the grains are hidden and lost.
The 
space so saved would be ready for the abstracts and references, and 
notices of articles elsewhere printed, which are indispensable for mak- 
ing the ' Phytologist' that full and complete register of British Botany 
now so much needed.

List of Mosses found near Chelmsford.
By A.
Greenwood, Esq.
I AM induced to offer the following list of mosses to the readers of 
the * Phytologist,' from the belief that no account of the cryptogamic 
productions of the immediate vicinity of Chelmsford has yet appear- 
ed in publication.
The species mentioned, which all grow within the distance of about 
ten miles from the town, amount to 109 ; and when it is considered 
that they are the result of the investigations of the last winter only, 
and of my own individual exertions, we may suppose that many must 
necessarily have been overlooked.
In the genera Bryura, Orthotri- 
chum and Sphagnum particularly, I think there must be a deficiency 
in the number of species, but as it is my intention to leave home short- 
ly, I prefer sending the list as it is, to waiting an indefinite time for 
an opportunity of adding to it.
Doubtless, also, the majority of those 
to which stations are given, grow in many other places as well.
I 
merely state where I myself have found them.
At the advice of some 
of my friends, I have adhered, where possible, to the nomenclature of 
Hooker and Taylor, as being that at present in most general use 
among botanists.
To the kindness of Mr. G.
H. K.
Thwaites, of Bristol, I am indebt- 
ed for confirmation in the names of some of the species.
Phascum crispum.
Banks, &c., rather common.

â€¢ contortum, Schultz, B*.
I believe this is not uncommon in 
company with other Sphagna.
I have gathered it on Wood- 
ham Walter Common, and on Warley Common, near Brent- 
wood.
Gymnostomum mridissimum, B.
On a tree in Bligh's Wood, Spring- 
field ; also on a tree in the parish of Roxwell.

I believe I have observed 
this in several places, but neglected to gather good specimens 
at the proper time.

TelrapJiis pelludda.
Abundant on shaded ditch-sides in the neigh- 
bourhood of Woodhara Walter Common ; also in a little

386 
Barbula cylindrica, Wils.
MSS.
Common on trees and wood 
subject to be inundated by the water ; in fruit on a tree 
near Writtle Park.
I can scarcely believe this to be a variety 
of Cinclidotus riparius, as I have carefully sought for that 
species around where the Barbula cylindrica grows, and in 
water adjoining, but in vain.
Mr. Thwaites also, makes the 
same remark respecting the Bristol B.

On the occurrence of Mimulus luteus in Forfarshire.
By George 
Lawson, Esq.
In the report given in the October number of the *Phytologist' 
(Phytol.
ii.
319), of a meeting of the Botanical Society of Glasgow, 
held on the 24th of June last, I find Mimulus luteus noticed as having 
been mentioned in an account of a botanical trip by Dr. Balfour, read 
to the Society at that meeting, it having been found by him " natura- 
lized near Largs." Mimulus luteus I have observed in two stations 
in Forfarshire : the one at Invergowrie burn, which separates the 
counties of Perth and Forfar, about four miles west of Dundee, and 
the other by the margin of the water of Dighty, at Strathmartine, four 
or five miles north of Dundee.
At both these stations the plant is 
plentiful, and grows luxuriantly, being quite naturalized, and, it may 
be, indigenous ; as to this, however, I will not venture an opinion.
This may be interesting to the readers of the * Phytologist,' and I 
think the plant deserves the particular attention of British botanists, 
as it may perhaps have claims to a place in the British Flora.
Those 
who have met with it in other stations than those mentioned by Dr.
Balfour and myself, will perhaps be kind enough to communicate 
such, with their observations, through the medium of the ' Phytolo- 
gist.' Although a plant somewhat showy, it is often not easily de- 
tected, being hid by the luxuriant grass at the margins of the streams, 
where it usually grows.

On the Country of Cliococca tenuifolia.
By Charles C.
Babing- 
TON, Esq., M.A., F.L.S.
I may state that our late curator, Mr. A.
Biggs, always said that 
the seeds of this plant were obtained from the interior of New Hol- 
land, by a person who was not a botanist, and who was, at the time of 
gathering them, far beyond the settled country in pursuit of bush-ran- 
gers.
At the time when I published the account of the genus Clio- 
cocca, I had confidence in the correctness of Mr. Bigg's memory, but 
he has since fallen into such a state of health that it becomes quite 
possible that he may have committed an error, and that the seeds did 
really come from S.
America.
1 trust that this is a sufficient excuse 
for my having fallen into an error, if that is the case.
I have so great confidence in the opinion of Dr. Walker Arnott, 
that T shall now believe that Cliococca tenuifolia and Linum selagi- 
noides are very probably the same species.
My description was 
drawn from the living plant, and I therefore feel certain of its accu- 
racy.
Lamarck's plant may perhaps be another species of the new 
genus to which some other Linea3 may be referable.
These are 
points which 1 most willingly leave in the very able hands of Dr.
Arnott.

Corrections of various errors in Mr. Lees' paper on the (Enanthe 
pimpinelloides, Lachenalii and silaifolia.
By Hewett C.
Watson, Esq.
With mingled surprise and regret 1 have read a paper from the 
pen of Mr. Lees, in the December No. of the ' Phy tologist ' (Vol. ii, 
pp.
354-365), upon the three species of QEnanthe which were so long 
misunderstood and confused together in this country under the two 
names of pimpinelloides and peucedanifolia.
I was surprised to see 
so much looseness of statement and positive error again brought into 
the discussion, after the progress made by other botanists towards an 
accurate elucidation of those plants.
And 1 regretted to see the un- 
friendly and ungenerous animus which too obviously urged on the 
pen and distorted the writer's judgement ; and the effect of which is 
far more likely to be felt in a recoil upon himself, than in any damage 
to the individual against whom the battery was so awkwardly worked.
301 
The imcertaiiities respecting these three species of CEnanthe had 
been brought into a narrow compass by the papers of Mr. Ball, Mr.
Babington and myself; each of whom had successively elucidated 
some of the points previously obscure ; although each in turn had still 
left some unsettled questions to be answered by others.
Mr. Lees 
now comes forward at the eleventh hour, when the doubts are nearly 
all solved and settled, and contrives to write the longest paper hitherto 
printed on the subject; so much easier is it, to write a diffuse paper, 
than to give really useful information in succinct terms.
In that paper 
Mr. Lees writes as if almost nothing had been done by othersâ€” states 
over again many things previously made public â€” commits several 
notable blunders â€” and adds very little indeed to our previous stock 
of real knowledge.
Mr. Babington or Mr. Ball would have told in a 
single page all that was new and worth recording in the paper referred 
to.
Surely, it could not be held necessary for Mr. Lees to restate 
those circumstances which had already been more accurately or more 
fully stated by preceding writers.
And it was not simply unnecessary, 
but highly mischievous, to put forth unqualified statements, in the 
character of general truths, notwithstanding that facts previously on 
record, and certified on sufficient authority, proved some of those 
statements to be quite incorrect, and showed that others of them 
could be true only to a limited extent.
Taking the three former 
papers (those of Ball, Babington and Watson), in connexion, the 
most important points left uncertain may be thus put into the form of 
queries : 
L â€” Is the peucedanifolia of Smith an identical species with the 
peucedanifolia of Pollich ?
â€” or, with the silaifolia of Bieberstein ?
â€” or, 
a third species distinct from both ?
2. â€” What is the form of the leaflets of the truly radical leaves of 
Smith's peucedanifolia ?
â€” and, what is the form of its mature fruit ?
Nothing whatever is attempted by Mr. Lees, in the way of answer 
to these queries, or the nomenclature of the species.
He has a pas- 
sing allusion to the names, in a foot-note on page 356, but this allu- 
sion is penned in such terms, as almost unavoidably to force us upon 
a supposition that Mr. Lees has yet to learn the recognized principles 
of botanical nomenclature.
He thinks it " preferable to retain " the 
name of " peucedanifolia of Pollich," and yet he assigns no reason for 
a preference, which has a weight of authority against it vastly greater 
than any in favour of it.
According to existing knowledge, and the 
established rules of nomenclature, the question may be held now al- 
most entirely reduced to a choice between " silaifolia " and " Sraithii." 
392 
Should it hereafter appear that Bieberstein's plant is only a variety of 
Pollich's, in such case the earlier name " peucedanifolia " must be 
resumed ; but so long as they are esteemed two species, our British 
plant must take the name of that reputed species to which it truly be- 
longs, and this is almost certainly the silaifolia of Bieberstein.
The 
name of " Smithii " was suggested only as a temporary designation, 
to fall into oblivion, provided the British species could be refen'ed 
satisfactorily to any other described species.
After that name was 
suggested, I met with a very strong additional reason for believing 
the British plant to be really the silaifolia, as was explained in a sup- 
plementary paper on the ffinanthe peucedanifolia of Smith (Phytol.
ii.
94).
Taking that reason in connexion with the specific character and 
references given in Bieberstein's own work, and the papers of Ball and 
Babington, it seems to my judgment that every botanist, competent 
to give an opinion upon the matter, will hold it "preferable to retain " 
the name assigned to the British plant by Ball.
But in this paper, to 
prevent confusion in contrasting the British against the continental 
silaifolia, I will use the name of " Smithii " to distinguish the former.
In reference to the second queries, Mr. Lees is more successful, for 
here he affords one small item of information, which was much wanted.
He writes that the radical leaves of Smithii " agree entirely with the 
stem-leaves, namely, bipinnate, with acute, entire, lanceolate or linear 
pinnie " (p.
362).
If correct, this is useful infonnation ; because no 
opportunity for ascertaining the character of the true radical leaves had 
occurred to Ball, Babington, or myself.
It adds another fact towards 
showing the identity of our Smithii with the silaifolia of Koch's Sy- 
nopsis.
I had described the leaflets of the lower stem-leaves, as being 
" linear-lanceolate acute, scarcely broader than those of the upper 
leaves ;" and had commented upon this character as a difficulty, when 
compared with Bieberstein's statement that the lower leaves of his 
silaifolia are much abbreviated and dilated â€” " valde abbreviatis atque 
dilatatis." It may be, however, that the "valde" is not meant to ex- 
tend to "dilatatis;" and that this strong expression must be construed 
only with reference to long and narrow lower leaves in Pollich's peu- 
cedanifolia.
Adopting this construction, and my own term "subcylin- 
drical" to express the character of the fruit (as presently to be 
explained), there will remain no serious objection against a belief of 
the British Smithii being truly identical with the silaifolia of Bieber- 
stein and of Koch.
Mr. Lees describes and figures the fruit of Smithii ; and here it is 
necessary to correct and limit his description.
He describes the fruit 
393 
" oblong, contracted below." Mr. Ball said " clavate, and somewhat 
contracted below." I called it " subcylindrical." Here we see three 
different observers using as many different terms.
The fact is, the 
fruits vary considerably in form, even in the same umbel.
I have 
before remarked of the three species, " while immature, the fruits of 
all are contracted downwards" (Phytol.
ii.
15); and Ball expressly states 
that he describes fruits not fully mature.
Apparently this form of 
immaturity is retained in some of the full-grown fruits of Smithii ; as 
is certainly the case with those of Lachenalii.
The exterior fruits, 
in the umbellule of Smithii, are rarely of equal thickness from base to 
summit, when full grown, but not being quite equal throughout, and 
moreover also somewhat angular, the term "cylindrical" requires 
the qualifying prefix " sub." In the interior of the umbellule, the 
fruits are compressed one by another, and (seemingly through their 
mutual pressure) they assume a more angular and tapering form.
Such a fruit is represented in the figure given by Mr. Lees ; and 
which is, indeed, more clavate than oblong.
I presume, however, 
that the form of the exterior fruits should be considered typical or 
normal.
Apparently this is also the opinion of Koch, who writes of 
silaifolia " fructibus cylindricis." The exterior fruits are nearly cy- 
lindrical, the interior being oblong-clavate and angular.
Having thus gleaned from the paper of Mr. Lees, and applied to 
scientific use, the little information of value which it can be said to 
have added to previously recorded knowledge, I next ask myself the 
question, ' Shall the inaccuracies of the paper be left to that inevitable 
fate which ultimately befalls all error ?
or is it better at once to qua- 
lify and correct them, in order to check the temporary mischief con- 
sequent on the propagation of errors ?' There is inconvenience in 
the latter course.
Easy as it is, to state simple facts in concise terms, 
it is by no means equally easy to apply them in the correction of 
errors and inaccuracies, without adding quotations and explanations 
which would greatly extend the necessary amount of text.
I will 
therefore not attempt to quote in detail, and then to correct, all the 
inaccuracies and untenable statements which occur in the paper of 
Mr. Lees.
Instead of pursuing that course, I will mention some of the 
circumstances which seem calculated to place the subject of discus- 
sion in a more correct position ; though even this will unavoidably 
lead to repetitions and explanations, which have become necessary 
only through the faults of Mr. Lees' paper.
394 
As before explained in the ' Phytologist,' the misapplication of the 
names " pimpinelloides " and " peucedanifolia " to the British species 
known to Smith, was mentioned in the 'British Flora' of 1838, or 
some earlier date ; and it is to be regretted that the author of that 
work did not then substitute the names "Lachenalii" and "silaifolia" 
in their stead.
The (reputedly) true Linnean pimpinelloides was 
certainly in some British herbaria before that date ; but its various 
collectors had apparently always mistaken it for Lachenalii â€” in other 
words, for Smitli's pimpinelloides.
There is no reason to suppose 
that any British specimen of the true pimpinelloides had come under 
the examination either of Smith or of Hooker.
In or about 1842, specimens of Lachenalii, correctly so labelled, 
were sent to the Botanical Societies of London and Edinburgh, from 
the locality of Michelfeld, near Basle ; a locality which brings the 
plant home, or nearly so, to the ' Flora Badensis' of Gmelin.
Proba- 
bly these specimens came under the eyes of Mr. Babington, who 
could appreciate their value.
He had retained Smith's nomenclature 
in the 'Edinburgh Catalogue' of 1841, but substituted the name 
"Lachenalii" (instead of "pimpinelloides") in his Manual, which 
was published in May, 1843.
The specimens received by the Lon- 
don Society, at the same time, passed through the hands of their 
curator ; the identity of these specimens with Smith's pimpinelloides 
remaining unobserved there, until I stumbled upon one of them acci- 
dentally, late in 1844, while looking out something else.
As for Smithii, whenever found in England, it appears to have been 
rightly referred to Smith's peucedanifolia.
But many botanists fell 
into the error of referring their examples of Lachenalii also to the 
peucedanifolia of Smith.
It was obvious to me that such was the 
case, even some years before I had seen a specimen of Smithii.
But 
my herbarium then containing only imperfect specimens of Lache- 
nalii, and neither of our other two species, I saw the en-or without 
being able to correct it properly.
There is a passage on page 411 of 
the 'New Botanist's Guide' (1837), in which the misnomers are men- 
tioned ; but, of course, the " pimpinelloides " there spoken of was 
that of Smith and ' English Botany,' not the species now believed to 
be that of Linnaeus.
No instance has come imder my knowledge, 
where Smithii was mistaken for Lachenalii : the errors were always 
the converse of this.
When did the Linnean pimpinelloides become known as a British 
plant?
In May of 1840, I had brought a young plant of it, from the 
Isle of Wight, to my garden, where that specimen and its descendants 
395 
are still growing.
During a great part of the summer of 1841, and the 
whole botanical season of 1842, I was absent from home ; but in 
1843 I began to consider what this same plant really was.
Even at 
this late date, however, I was still at fault about the other two species ; 
one of which (Smithii) I had never seen alive, and the other (Lache- 
nalii) only twelve years before, when I was quite a beginner in 
Botany.
About the close of 1843, I compared my garden plant with 
the Sardinian specimen of pimpinelloides {Linn.) in the herbarium of 
Sir William Hooker ; and of course that species was then clearly 
proved a native of Britain.
In 1844, Professor Balfour kindly sup- 
plied my garden with living plants of Lachenalii, and in the autumn 
of that year, I again collected that species on the coast of Devon.
Of Smithii I have seen dried specimens only.
Mr. Ball appears to have been the first botanist (Mr. Lees excepted, 
of whom I will presently speak) who got together specimens of all 
three species, in a sufficiently good condition for determination.
Mr.
Babington was in train, however, and I suspect that he had failed to 
determine the plants, through not possessing a sufficient set of speci- 
mens.
I had, indeed, given him garden examples of the Isle-of- Wight 
pimpinelloides, dried in 1843 ; but these having been sent simply to 
illustrate changes in the roots, according to age, they were not well 
calculated to show an unfamiliar species distinctly, and in his paper 
of June, 1844, they appear to be alluded to as examples of Lachenalii.
Meantime, what was Mr. Lees doing ?
This gentleman had seen 
and collected all three species in a living state.
His advantages and 
opportunities were thus greatly superior to those enjoyed by any 
other botanist ; and it is truly remarkable that he should have done 
nothing towards their elucidation.
Speaking of the species by their 
present names, his operations were these : â€” 1.
He collected pimpi- 
nelloides, and mistook it for Lachenalii.
2. â€” He collected Lachenalii 
and mistook it for silaifolia.
3. â€” He collected silaifolia and gave it 
a right name (peucedanifolia of Smith), and yet he failed to see that 
it was a different thing fi'om Lachenalii.
We all blundered through deficiency of specimens.
But Mr. Lees 
thoroughly beat all of us at blundering.
He saw all three species in 
a living state, and in their native localities, and yet he blundered 
more than any of us.
It is true, as stated in the ^ Phytologist,' that he 
labelled his specimens of pimpinelloides' {Linn.) with the name 
" pimpinelloides ;" but he did so under the mistake of supposing it 
the Smithian plant so named.
The species was mistaken, though the 
name was right by a misapplication.
It was the name of Smith's 
396 
species applied to the Linnean species.
There is no ground for sup- 
posing that Mr. Lees had the slightest idea of his specimens being 
anything different from the Smithian pimpinelloides.
His labels, up 
to 1843, show that he referred plants of the latter species to Smith's 
peucedanifolia.
And even in the paper which calls forth this present 
one from myself, he still confuses the Linnean and Smithian pimpi- 
nelloides, as though he thought them one and the same thing, because 
they have been unfortunately designated by the same name.
If any reader should doubt the possibility of this confusion of ideas 
so late in the discussion, he has only to read some few lines in the 
middle of page 355 of Mr. Lees's paper, and he will see a glaring 
proof that such is the case.
The plant of the " driest ground " is the 
Linnean pimpinelloides ; the plant of " salt-marshes " is the Smithian 
pimpinelloides â€” really Lachenalii ; and yet these two allied situa- 
tions of growth are there put in opposition to each other, as if they 
really had been assigned for the same single species only.
The like 
strangely illogical confusion of ideas is again repeated about the mid- 
dle of page 362, where the author is writing about the involucral 
bracts of " pimpinelloides ;" the Linnean and Smithian species being 
still confounded together, and Smith's statement, respecting the bracts 
of one species being disputed, because Mr. Lees finds something dif- 
ferent in the bracts of the other species.
I have thus dwelt on the history of these plants, or, rather, that of 
our knowledge of them ; because, unless we can clearly make out 
which species was intended at different dates, under the same name, 
the recorded localities will still lead to many mistakes.
In most of 
the localities recorded for pimpinelloides {Smith), before 1844, we 
may expect to find Lachenalii ; which is only another name for the 
same species.
To this, it may be presumed, we shall have exceptions 
in any localities recorded by Mr. Lees ; and in these we may expect 
to find the species now designated pimpinelloides {Linn.).
In loca- 
lities recorded for peucedanifolia {Smith), we may sometimes find 
that species ; but as fi-equently it will be the Lachenalii.
As far as I 
have seen specimens, all the Scottish and Irish localities, assigned 
for peucedanifolia, belong to Lachenalii only.
My own account of 
the ascertained distribution of the three species, derived from speci- 
mens examined, is more complete than that attempted by Mr. Lees 
(Phytol.
ii.
pp.
13, 14, 15).
My remarks are running out so far that I must pass over some 
other inaccuracies without allusion ; but Mr. Lees' description of the 
roots of the three species is so confidently expressed, although far 
397 
indeed from the whole truth, that it will certainly perplex and mislead 
those who rely implicitly upon his text and figures.
That gentle- 
man's two first figures give excellent representations of the roots of 
pimpinelloides and'peucedanifolia (Smithii) in 'what may be deemed 
their typical or usual forms.
The third figure, intended to represent 
the root of Lachenalii, is much less successful.
1 have occasionally 
seen roots almost as slender and tapering, on plants which had pro- 
bably grown in very damp ground or ditches.
But the examples 
which I dug up on the coast of Devon (among Juncus acutus) in 1844, 
and many of those which 1 have examined from other localities, had 
tuber-like roots, far thicker and shorter than those represented in the 
figiue of Lachenalii ; being, in fact, much nearer, both in size and 
shape, to the tubers of Smithii, as represented and described by 
Mr. Lees.
In my former paper, of January, 1844, I remarked about the tubers 
of the three species â€” " Still they vary greatly, even in the same spe- 
cies ; and single tubers might be taken from one species which would 
then readily pass for those of another" (Phytol.
ii.
12).
Notwithstand- 
ing this statement, the simple expression of facts actually in existence, 
and ready for the eyes of any botanist who might choose to look at 
them â€” Mr. Lees confidently as- 
serts that the species may always 
be distinguished by the roots 
alone, as figured and described 
by himself; that is to say, by 
terms and figures which abso- 
lutely deny the smallest approxi- 
mation or resemblance between 
the roots of the three species.
Whence springs this utter disre- 
gard and virtual contradiction of 
the published statements of a- 
nother botanist, whose practical 
acquaintance with plants may at 
least be pronounced equally ex- 
tensive as that of Mr. Lees 
himself ?
The annexed cuts show vari- 
ous forms of the tubers in each 
of the three species.

the cuts.
Being copied from dried 
specimens, they are probably rather 
thinner, and of course more distorted, 
than would be the case in fresh ex- 
amples ; but the process of desicca- 
tion could never thus convert the 
tubers of one, into almost precise si- 
militudes of the tubers of another 
species : it is Nature who does that 
part of the business.
The two tubers of Lachenalii, 
which are represented as attached

of London.
The others are all from 
British specimens in my own herba- 
rium.
Nobody can deny that those 
two tubers are more like Mr. Lees' 
figure of peucedanifolia, than his 
figure of Lachenalii.
Several of the 
Basle specimens, however, had roots 
quite long and slender.

in fruit.
After looking at these forms, readers of the ' Phytologist ' 
will understand the necessity of limiting and qualifying Mr. Lees' 
hasty generalizations.
And they will be prepared to believe that 
even good botanists might mistake one species for another, if deciding 
by their roots alone.
I have put this to the test of a direct experi- 
ment by sending roots of the Shanldin pimpinelloides, which is un- 
doubtedly the true species, to one of our best English botanists ; ripe 
fruit being also sent to assist his judgment.
This botanist, expressly 
referring to Mr. Lees' oivn statements about the roots of pimpinel- 
loides, most confidently pronounced the plant to be â€” Lachenalii !*

This plant grows by the road-side between Chelmsford and Gal-

There are no gardens in the immediate vicinity, and Mr. Thomas 
Corder, who first pointed the station out to me, states that it grew 
there eight years ago, he believes before the nearest cottages and gar- 
dens adjoining were in existence.
I have also found this plant still further removed from garden cul- 
tivation, by the side of a field between Great Bakering and Foul- 
ness Island.

Young 
plants grow up around its base, in the form of suckers.
The roots of these young

When the plants are more ad-

so as to form one elliptic or fusiform tubercle on each fibre.
The upper portion of the 
fibre, above the tubercle, usually remains thin and forms a peduncle by which the tu- 
bercle is attached to the base of the stem.
The peduncles vary in length on the same

If nearly obliterated (by the tubercle forming near the base of the growing

Rarer Plants observed at Halstead, Essex.
By T.
Bentall, Esq.
Having for several years past devoted a great portion of my leisure 
time to the examination of the flowering plants of Halstead, I have 
thought that a list of the rarer species which have come under my 
observation might not be altogether uninteresting to the readers of the 
' Phytologist.' In order to avoid the necessity of giving localities, 
and for other reasons, I consider it advisable to confine myself exclu- 
sively to Halstead, consequently all the species enumerated below 
must be considered as occurring within the limits of that parish.

duced.

On (Enanthe pimpinelloides and (Enanthe Lachenalii.
By Edward 
FoRSTER, Esq., V.P.L.S.
After the full investigation of the specific distinction of Q^nanthe 
pimpinelloides, ffinanthe peucedanifolia and QEnanthe Lachenalii 
by Mr. Edwin Lees in the last * Phytologist ' (Phytol.
ii.
334).
accom- 
panied with such instructive figures of the roots and fruits, it may 
seem superfluous to add more, yet as I have examined the Linnean 
and Smithian herbariums, I trust Mr. Lees will like to hear the result, 
confirming his views.
In the herbarium of Linnaeus, the specimen named by him QEnan- 
404 
the pimpinelloides, and marked H.
U,, showing that it came from the 
Upsal garden, is most decidedly that species which has lately been 
added to the British Flora, and by no means the CEnanthe pimpinel- 
loides of Hudson, Smith, and subsequent British authors.
It is true 
that there is no root, but the radical leaf is decisive.
Our librarian, 
Mr. Kippist, with his usual accuracy, reminds me that I ought to 
state that this leaf is detPtched from the stem.
The cause of this is 
evidently the small-sized paper on which Linnseus' specimens are 
fixed.
To this paper is pinned another, with an unnamed specimen 
of a very different plant, imknown to me, then follows one, again 
named Q^nanthe pimpinelloides, and marked H.
U. In this speci- 
men the radical leaf is somewhat different from the first as to the 
sharpness of the incisions, but not more so than the leaves of two 
plants which 1 have growing, given to me by Mr. Borrer, from Dr.
Bromfield, one with round bulbs, the other with oblong.
There is 
another which 1 think is a very wretched specimen of Qi^nanthe peu- 
cedanifolia, but it is not named, and therefore is of no avail whatever.
I may here mention that Jacquin's figure in ''''Flora Austriaca^'' 394 
(not 395, as erroneously quoted) is a truly excellent delineation of 
the CEnanthe pimpinelloides, Linn., and is rightly so named.
In the herbarium of Smith, the specimen named by him Q'^inanthe 
pimpinelloides is undoubtedly the plant we have now learnt to call 
CEnanthe Lachenalii, and is very distinct from the Linnean Q^.
pim- 
pinelloides.
One specimen is from "Aber, Htigli Davies^'' and one from 
" Scotland, Mackay, vide * English Flora,' ii.
60," then comes another, 
whether his own or his friend Daval's does not appear.
This is a 
very interesting specimen of the same plant; it is unnamed, but 
marked ^^Hort.
Lachenal, the Michelfeld plant^'' clearly meaning that 
it was gathered in Lachenal's garden, from a plant originally from 
Michelfeld.
I have not been able to meet with Gmelin, ^Fl. Bad.,^ 
in which it seems to have been first named.
Koch has a synonym 
" CEnanthe Michelfeldiense, Lachenal.'''' This may be from some 
garden catalogue, or a temporary manuscript name, for it does not 
occur in Steudel.
The specimen in Smith's herbarium is strong 
corroborative evidence.
I have no doubt that Mr. Lees is correct in his account of the soils 
in which these plants are found, but I would beg to call his further 
attention to the dry places he mentions for Qinanthe pimpinelloides 
and to suggest whether these may not be an exception to a general 
rule, for 1 cannot help fancying that the habit of the plant in my gar- 
den is that of a bog plant.
We know that many plants sport in this 
405 
way, for example, Scrophularia aquatica, in dry chalk-pits, Orchis 
conopsea, in wet marshes, and many others.
With regard to Ob^-nan- 
the peucedanifolia, surely "denizen" must be a slip of the pen, for it is 
impossible to think that this is a naturalized plant, not indigenous.
Of GEnanthe Lachenalii I should say with Hudson, " in paludihus 
maritimis frequens ;" it scarcely deserves a particular habitat.

WorcestersJiire hahitat of (Enanihe Lachenalii.
By Robert J.
N. 
Streeten, M.D.
V^ouR correspondent, Mr. Lees, to the general accuracy of whose 
description of the species of Qj^nanthe I have pleasure in bearing tes- 
timony, will find Q^nanthe Lachenalii growing in considerable plenty 
in the muddy ditches on Defford Common, in this county, and espe- 
cially in the vicinity of the salt spring.
I gathered the plant in this 
locality in the year 1840, considering it to be, at that time, the CE.
pimpinelloides of the ' English Flora.' Soon after the publication of 
Mr. Babington's Manual, and the papers by Mr. Ball and others in 
the ' Annals of Natural History,' I satisfactorily ascertained the Def- 
ford plant to be the same as that described under the name of CE.
Lachenalii, and requested Mr. Reece, the intelligent sub-curator of 
the Worcestershire Natural History Society, to collect specimens for 
the Society, having myself again previously visited the locality and 
obtained specimens of the plant, though too early for the fruit.
Some 
of Mr. Recce's specimens collected in September, 1844, are now in 
the herbarium of the Society.
The Defford plant, like Mr. Lees' 
plant on Welland Common, is accompanied by Helosciadium nodi- 
florum.

Correction of some errors in the papers on the species of (Enanthe, 
in the Phytologist for January, 1846.
By H.
C. Watson, Esq.
Some errors, either of the pen or of the press, occur in my own 
paper on the species of Q^nanthe, in the Phytologist for this month.
I beg leave to coiTect those errors, because they alter and vitiate the 
Vol. II.
3 d 
406 
meaning of the passages in which they occur.
At the same time, I 
will take the liberty also of correcting one or two errors (as 1 conceive 
them to be) in the paper of Mr. Forster, in reference to the specimens 
in the Linnean herbarium.
Perhaps it will be the readiest way of 
putting right my own expressions, if I quote the sentences, and inter- 
polate the corrections at their proper places.

species which has lately been added to the British Flora, and by no

quent British authors.
It is true that there is no root, but the radical 
leaf is decisive.
Our librarian, Mr. Kippist, with his usual accuracy, 
reminds me that I ought to state that this leaf is detached from the 
stem.
â€” To this paper is pinned another, with an unnamed specimen 
of a very different plant, unknown to me ; then follows one, again 
named GEnanthe pimpinelloides, and marked H.
U. â€” There is ano- 
ther, which I think is a very wretched specimen of Qi^nanthe peuce- 
danifolia, but it is not named, and therefore is of no avail whatever." 
Doubtless it will become me to consider well what 1 say, in ex- 
pressing opinions exactly opposite to those of the respected botanist 
whose words I have just quoted.
But I have had the species of 
Qinanthe so much in thought and observation during the past twelve 
months, and have examined so very many specimens from different 
localities in Britain, Europe and Asia, that I cannot help feeling myself 
familiar with their appearance and characters.
I had carefully com- 
pared British specimens with those of the Linnean herbarium, before I 
ventured to say, while writing of pimpinelloides, in a former number of 
the * Phytologist ' (Jan. 1845), twelve months ago, that "the speci- 
mens in the Linnean herbarium, wanting root and fruit, apparently 
belong here." Curiously enough, it was precisely that " unnamed 
specimen " thought so different by Mr. Forster, which satisfied me of 
the identity of our British species with that of Linnaeus ; while the 
407 
single detached leaf, on tlie other sheet of ])ai)er, came in as a diffi- 
culty, and induced me to write "apparently belong" instead of "cer- 
tainly belong." 
Since reading the remarks of Mr. Forster, I have again compared 
British specimens with those of Linnoeus, and still I can only come to 
the same conviction.
The unnamed specimen, pinned to the named 
one, is exactly identical with specimens sent from Powick, by Mr.
Lees, to the Botanical Society of London ; as also with my garden 
plant, originally from the Isle of Wight, and with wild specimens, 
kindly supplied to me from the same island by Dr. Bromfield.
The 
detached leaf mny belong to this species also ; though I do not yet 
feel assured on that point.
The " wretched specimen," also without name, which Mr. Forster 
thinks may be referrible to CEuanthe peucedani folia, is most assuredly 
not Smith's species so called â€” our silaifolia : the fruit is quite diffe- 
rent, and brings it nearer to globulosa.
Possibly Mr. Forster may 
have been misled in this instance, by Smith's herbarium, in which a 
foreign fragment in fruit (probably of globulosa) is fastened on the 
sheet of paper, which holds his British specimen of peucedanifolia.
In my earlier paper, which described the three species (Phytol.
ii, 12), 
1 mentioned Smith's blunder, for he has obviously described the fruit 
of a wrong species in the ' English Flora,' and thus led to no little 
confusion.
The G5.
globularis (if I remember right, such is the ma- 
nuscript name) of the Linnean herbarium, seems different from the 
globulosa of more modern authors, and looks much like another ex- 
ample of pimpinelloides j but this remark is simjjly from recollection 
of it.
I presume that Mr. Forster did not honour me by looking at my 
paper on these Q^nanthes in last year's ' Phytologist ' for January ; 
otherwise he would have seen that I particularly mentioned the Basle 
specimens, in describing Lachenalii (Phytol.
ii.
14).
1 have not yet 
discovered any errors in that paper.
But I do believe myself able to 
point out errors in all the other descriptive papers on these plants 
whether printed in the ' Phytologist ' or in the ' Annals.' For the 
greater accuracy of that paper, I may acknowledge my obligations to 
the specimens procured through the Botanical Society of London 
an institution now quite unrivalled in the assistance which it affords 
members towards obtaining desiderata in British Botany.

Correction of an error in Mr. Malleson^s paper (Phytol.
ii.
368).
By William Borrer, Esq., F.R.S.
It may be worth while to correct an inaccuracy in Mr. Malleson's 
late communication to the 'Phytologist' (ii.
372), into which the writer 
was led by a too implicit reliance on my prima facie knowledge of 
Carices.
The Carex growing near Pulborough, which I took for C.
axillaris, proves to be the little known C.
Boenninghauseniana, agree- 
ing precisely with Mr. Coleman's Hertford plant, and with the figure in 
Kunze's Supplement to Schkur.
Dr. Bromfield has found the same in 
the Isle of Wight, and it may very probably have been overlooked or 
mistaken for C.
axillaris in other places.
Mr. Mitten has found the true 
C. axillaris at Hurstpierpoint.
C. Boenninghauseniana has the glumes 
more membranous than C.
axillaris, and the beak of the fruit not bifid, 
differences which Mr. Malleson himself has remarked in the Pulbo- 
rough plant.

BOTANICAL SOCIETY OF EDINBURGH.
Nov. 13, 1845.
â€” Dr. Douglas Maclagan, President, in the chair.
The President, on taking the chair, begged to offer a few remarks 
on the present state and prospects of the Society.
During the past, 
as well as former sessions, many valuable papers had been read to 
them, and much interesting botanical information, especially on some 
of the more obscure classes of vegetables, had been brought before the 
public through the medium of their Reports and Transactions.
In 
one respect only the Society had been deficient ; he meant in the at- 
tendance of members at its meetings.
This was owing, in great mea- 
sure, to the circumstance, that almost all the members were profes- 
sionally occupied, and, therefore, unable to give to a purely scientific 
society, that attendance which they were able to bestow on profes- 
sional societies and meetings.
During last session, they had also felt 
a great blank in the absence from their meetings of their former dis- 
tinguished president, Dr. Graham, whose long and painful illness had, 
for many months previous to his death, precluded his taking any part 
in their proceedings.
Dr. M.
felt it to be unnecessary in such a 
meeting to eulogize the character of Professor Graham.
They all 
409 
not only knew him to be a zealous cultivator and successful teacher 
of Botanj', but they had individually found in him a kind, upright, 
and sincere friend.
His affable manner, conjoined with his highly 
honourable deportment, had procured for him the respect and esteem 
of all who had the pleasure of knowing him.
It was a gratification to find in Dr. Graham's successor, the gen- 
tleman to whose zeal and activity the Botanical Society of Edinburgh 
owed its origin.
He congratulated Dr. Balfour on his return to his 
native city, and expressed the hope and expectation that in his new 
position he would materially support and advance the interests of the 
Society.
Samuel Hailstone, Esq., F.L.S., &c, Horton Hall, near Bradford, 
was elected a non-resident Fellow of the Society.
The following communications were read : â€” 
1. Contributions to the Physiology of Fecundation in Plants.

George Dickie, M.D., Lecturer on Botany in the University and 
King's College of Aberdeen.
2. Remarks on some forms of Rubus.

Bell Salter, M.D., 
F.L.S., Ryde, Isle of Wight.
Mr. James M'Nab exhibited a specimen of silk cotton {Bomhax 
Ceiba), and mentioned that this substance was under trial in this city, 
with the view of its being employed in the manufacture of hats.
Specimens of Barkhausia setosa, gathered near North Queensferry, 
by Andrew Dewar, Esq., Dunfermline, were placed on the table.
December 11th, 1845.
â€” Dr. Archibald Inglis in the chair.
Donations to the Library and Museum were announced from Dr.
Dickenson, Liverpool ; W.
Brown, Esq., R.
N. ; Philosophical So- 
ciety of Glasgow ; Literary and Philosopical Society of Liverpool ; 
and Professor Koch, Erlangen.
Ralph Holden, Esq., and John Waller, Esq., were elected resident 
Fellows of the Society.
Mr. J.
M'Nab read a continuation of his journal of a tour through 
part of the United States and the Canadas.
The last portion com- 
municated to the Society gave an account of the botanical rarities 
observed in the neighbourhood of Toronto, and concluded with an 
excursion from Fort Niagara to Queenston, and thence to the Falls.
The portion of the journal describing the remarkable distribution of 
the trees, shrubs and herbaceous plants in the vicinity of the famous 
Falls, having been read before the Society at a previous meeting, was 
therefore omitted.
In the present notice, embracing the journey from Niagara to New 
410 
London, Mr. M'Nab particularly alluded to the excellent state of the 
cultivated grounds through the Hamilton and Gore districts, and the 
suitableness of large tracts of wooded country for emigrants.
On 
some waste land round the head of Burlington Bay, many good spe- 
cimens of herbaceous plants were picked in flower ; of these the Les- 
pideza hirta, Polygala verticillata, Gerardia tenuifolia, and G.
pedicu- 
laria, were abundant, with Chrysopsis alba ; the latter plant being 
noticed for the first time as an inhabitant of Canada.
Two strong- 
herbaged grasses, Andropogon furcatus and Limnetus cynosuroides, 
were mentioned as abounding in the neighbourhood of Hamilton, but 
neither seemed to be relished by cattle.
The moorland ground in the 
vicinity of Brantford afforded many interesting botanical rarities, 
among which Euphorbia corollata was conspicuous.
Liatris stricta, 
Aletris farinosa, Lespideza frutescens, Batschia Gmelini, Arenaria 
stricta, Viola palmata, with many others, were plentiful in flower, and 
proved most attractive objects on the dry sandy plains ; while the 
moister places yielded Tofieldia glutinosa, Zigadinus chloranthus, 
and Glycine apios in profusion.
The forests through the inland dis- 
tricts were exceedingly rich and varied, many of them containing 
large and lofty trees of oak, elm, beech, hickory, ash, and white pine.
Some of these districts, in the process of clearing by the recent set- 
tlers, presented a very remarkable appearance in consequence of large 
groups of stately trees standing dead, many with stems from ten to 
fourteen feet in circumference, and varying from eighty to one hun- 
dred feet in height.
The mode resorted to by the settlers for killing 
the trees is by cutting, during the early part of winter, a notch five or 
six inches deep round the lower part of their stems.
The white 
pines presented a very singular appearance caused by a peculiar seem- 
ing twisting of the decayed trunks in a uniform direction from left to 
right throughout their whole length.
During the drying of the stems 
numerous fissures or rents are.
formed in a spiral manner from l-8th 
to half an inch in width, about four inches deep, and generally from 
four to ten inches distant at the bottom, presenting a ragged edge and 
narrowing upwards, causing the bark to fall off in large flakes.
When 
dead, they are hewn down, piled in heaps, and set fire to.
The quan- 
tity of splendid timber annually consumed in this way was described 
as being very great ; but being at a distance from water communica- 
tion it is rendered comparatively worthless.
Many of the road-sides 
through the wooded districts for miles together, were richly adorned 
with the scarlet and blue cardinal flowers [Lobelia carditialis and si- 
philiiica), and the crimson Monarda [Monarda didyma).
The Ame- 
411 
rican elderberry fSamhucus CanadetisisJ, also presented a striking 
feature, being very abundant and densely clothed with fruit.
The 
only tree noticed by the party, not previously seen in any other dis- 
trict, was th6 Tamarack, or black American Larch (Larix pendulaj.
This tree, of which there was an extensive forest on the banks of the 
Thames river, near New London, was generally of straggling growth, 
and never exceeded three feet in circumference.
Dr. Balfour read an account of a botanical trip to Ben Voirlich and 
Ben Nevis in August last.
He gave an account of the general fea- 
tures of the district, and noticed the occurrence of moraines and large 
angular boulders near the upper part of Loch Lomond, and the 
smooth rounded rocks, with distinct groovings, which are seen near 
the waterfall of Glen Nevis : both of these phenomena being proba- 
bly indicative of the former existence of glaciers.
He then gave an 
account of the Flora, and noticed the occurrence of Carex irrigua, 
near Loch Hoy; of Isoetes lacustris, Carex saxatilis and Poa Bal- 
fourii, in large quantities on Ben Voirlich ; and of Lysimachia vulga- 
ris, Carex vesicavia, Rubus afSnis, suberectus, and adula var.
foliosus, 
Bab., near Inverarnon.
After noticing the varieties of Quercus pe- 
dunculata and sessilifloi*a, which occur in Glen Falloch, he proceeded 
to give a detailed account of the Botany of Ben Nevis.
Besides the 
usual alpine plants, he picked Saxifraga rivularis, Stellaria cerastoi- 
des, Poa alpina vivipara, Poa laxa and Poa montana, Cornus sue- 
cica, Cistopteris dentata, Carex saxatilis, and various alpine forms of 
Hieracia.
Specimens of the plants were exhibited to the meeting.
At this meeting the election of office-bearers for the ensuing year 
took place, when Professor Balfour was chosen President, and Drs.
Greville, Seller, Archibald Inglis and Douglas Maclagan, V^ice-presi- 
dents.

â€” Professor Balfour, President, in the chair.
The Treasurer read a letter from Mrs. Graham, presenting to the 
Society some valuable MS.
papers on botanical subjects, by the late 
Professor Graham, 
W. Ivory, Esq., W.S., 26, York Place, was elected a resident Fel- 
low of the Society.
The following communications were read : â€” 
Notice regarding some species of plants recently observed as na- 
tives of Britain, by Mr. Evans.
Among the species referred to in 
this notice, were Alsine stricta, Carduus arvensis, &.
setosus, Glyceria 
412 
plicata, Barkhausia setosa, &c., specimens of these, and of Silene 
italica, from two Scotch stations, were exhibited to the meeting.
Dr. Balfour read a short notice from Dr. R.
C. Alexander, relative 
to the Flora of Sicily.
Dr. Alexander regards the Sicilian Flora as 
not an aboriginal one, but as derived from Africa on the one side, and 
from Greece and other Mediterranean countries on the other.
The 
plants peculiar to this island are by no means numerous, and the 
Flora is meagre when compared with that of Dalmatia and other 
countries on the shores of the Adriatic.
In the course of two months' 
residence in the island Dr. Alexander found only about 250 species 
which he had not seen in Dalmatia.
A communication was also read from Dr. Alexander regarding the 
plants found on the Apennines.
He considers the Flora of the Apen- 
nines from Piedmont downwards, to be also a derived one ; for 
excepting the genera which occupy fallow land and broken ground, 
such as Medicago, Ononis, Convolvulus, and sea-shore plants, he 
fovmd no genus developed, but a species of one type and a species of 
another, without connecting links.
On ascending the mountains, 
when he got to a region where a magnificent Flora ought to be, he 
found at most a hardy hill plant that had crept up, but nothing 
whatever of an alpine nature.
On the Matese, about forty miles north of Naples, vegetation near- 
ly ceased at about 6000 feet, and at the top, which is 7000 feet above 
the level of the sea, and where there is a snow-field that never en- 
tirely melts, and therefore cold enough for alpine plants, he met with 
Aubrietia Columnae, (a mere variety of A.
deltoides).
Ranunculus mon- 
tanus, a Geranium resembling a Carniolian species, Arab is alpina, an 
Allium not in flower, Scrophularia glandulosa, and three forms of 
Saxifraga aizoon, which are reckoned by some as species.
In nearly 
the same latitude, on the other side of the Adriatic, on the Biakovo, 
near Macarska, in Dalmatia, there is, at the same height, a most inte- 
resting alpine Flora, and in uiEtolia, in the M.
Velugo, one equally 
so.
Dr. Alexander found the Apennines by no means so productive 
as the Alps of Upper Styria and Upper Corinthia ; and he looks upon 
the range as probably so recent in its formation, as to be only receiv- 
ing its alpine Flora gradually from other districts.
Dr. Balfour also read a communication which he had received fi*om 
Mr. Campbell, of Islay, relative to mummy wheat, specimens of which 
were exhibited.
The wheat sent by Mr. Campbell resembled what 
is called Bellevue Talavera.
Other specimens of the so called 
mummy wheat were shown, having all the characteristics of Egyptian 
413 
wheat {Triticum compositum).
There appeared to be great doubts 
as to the fact of the wheat found in mummy cases havmg germinated.
Jn all the instances mentioned, there are numerous sources of fallacy 
which have not been guarded against.
The most authentic and best 
corroborated instance of the germination of mummy wheat seems to be 
that noticed by Mr. Tupper, who got from Mr. Pettigrew grains which 
had been taken by Sir Gardiner Wilkinson from some alabaster se- 
pulchral vases.
Even in this case, however, it is difficult to prove 
that the grains had not been recently inserted into the vases.
The 
wheat which was then produced was the same variety as that now 
sent by Mr. Campbell.
A communication was read from Mr. Cruickshank, regarding the 
discovery of Typha angustifolia in Lochmaben Loch, aud of Centun- 
culus minimus near Dumfries.
Specimens were exhibited by Dr. Balfour of Mentha rotundifolia, 
var.
vein Una, in flower, and of Pyrus pinnatifida in fruit, from the 
island of Arran.
Mr. James M'Nab exhibited specimens of Ardisia crenulata, from 
the Horticultural Society's garden, in which the seeds had germinated 
within the berries while hanging on the plant.

O. 
Stephens, Esq.
(see Phytol.

The paper was accompanied by 
some beautiful drawings.
Further observations on the Potato- Murrain.* By Henry Oxley 
Stephens, Esq.
In a paper on the potato-murrain read at a meeting of the Society, 
October 3rd, and published in the November * Phytologist ' (Phytol.
ii.
330), I expressed an opinion that the Fungi found in the diseased 
tubers were to be considered rather as accidental accompaniments 
than the proximate cause of the disease, and that I considered it im- 
possible that the Arlotrogus could be the cause of their decomposi- 
tion because that Fungus was not invariably present, and that up to 
the period at which that communication was written, I had not suc- 
ceeded in detecting it.
Subsequent observations have convinced me 
*Eead before the Botanical Society of London, 2nd January, 1846.
415 
that this inference was correct.
The identical sample of potatoes 
which were then free from cryptogamic organisms, now certainly con- 
tain them.
I now find the Arlotrogus hydnosporus, or at least a 
mucorine fungus according with the description of Montagne, except- 
ing that in my specimens the spores appear tuberculated or granulat- 
ed and not bristly, but this may possiblj-^ depend upon age.
It 
inhabits the cavities of the cells, perfecting its spores within them, 
and I think its creeping filaments perforate the cell-walls.
It is pro- 
per to mention that the same microscopic power has been used in 
all these observations.
In last August, these potatoes, then clearly 
diseased, contained no fungus ; now being farther advanced in decay 
they contain it in tolerable abundance.
I therefore conclude the Ar- 
lotrogus is not the cause of the disease which had progressed mate- 
rially in the tubers before any sign of cryptogamic life was discernible 
in them.
I believe I am therefore justified in expressing my con- 
firmed opinion that the potato-murrain, at least as far as the destruc- 
tion of the tubers is concerned, is not produced through the agency 
of cryptogamic parasites.
These mucedinous fungi, when present, are very easily seen, and it 
is quite idle to assert the contrary.
I am altogether at a loss to ac- 
count for the statement of Mr. Phillips (I quote firom a notice in the 
' Pictorial Times,' not having seen the original essay), " That no in- 
sect or fungi can be perceived in the diseased tubers by any means 
the microscope affords." Either he could not have employed a suffi- 
ciently high power, or not being a mycologist he must have passed 
these minute organisms over without recognizing them ; or what is 
quite possible, the sample of diseased potatoes examined by this gen- 
tleman happened to be free from them, and he concluded this was 
invariably the case.
But making every allowance, so direct a con- 
tradiction to the observations of such investigators as Montagne, 
Berkeley, &c., ought not to have been hazarded on light grounds.
I am fully aware that filamentous mucedines are generally found 
in decaying vegetable matter, e.
g. apples, &c., but am not so certain 
that they are invariably present; and to what extent they may be 
considered as the agents of decay, is a question yet to be solved.
I 
doubt whether their presence in decaying fruits, &c., proves more 
than the simple fact, that decomposing vegetable matter affords a soil 
suitable for the nourishment of these cryptogamics.

Silybum Mariamim a hiennial.
By George Lawson, Esq.
The Silybum Marianum, Gart.
(Carduus Marianus, L.), is given 
in the ' Edinburgh Catalogue ' as an annual, while in ' Hooker's Bri- 
tish Flora,' the period of duration is omitted.
From what I have seen 
of the plant, I should at once set it down as a biennial.
It grows at 
Momfieth, a village about six miles east of Dundee, Forfarshire, 
where I have frequently had opportunities of observing it, and there 
the plants are produced from the seed in one season, and flower and 
perfect seed during the succeeding summer.
Generally a few of the 
plants produce flowers the same year in which they rise from the seed, 
but such plants assume a low, stunted and unhealthy appearance.
Under cultivation, however, this plant may be made fully to develope 
itself, and to perfect flowers and seeds during the same season in 
which the seeds are committed to the soil ; but this is the case with 
many biennials, and in a state of nature this plant is utterly incapa- 
ble, as far as / have observed, of arriving fully at perfection in one 
season, and therefore I must consider it a biennial.
In other situa- 
tions, however, the case may be different.
I only speak from what 
has come under my own notice.

Occurrence of Salvia Verbenaca near Dundee.
By G.
Lawson, Esq.
It is stated in Sir William Jackson Hooker's ' British Flora,' in 
regard to Salvia Verbenaca, that it is " in Scotland only found about 
Edinburgh." This statement is, however, scarcely correct, as the 
plant is also found near this place, growing with all appearance of 
being really indigenous.
The situation where it is here found, to 
which I refer, is the Magdalen-yard Green, an open common at the 
west end of the town, on the margin of the Tay, to which many of our 
townspeople resort for amusement and recreation.
Two or three 
years ago, extensive alterations and improvements were made upon 
the grounds, and in consequence of these the plant was reported to 
have been destroyed.
During the past summer, however, I had the 
pleasure of rediscovering it growing on a dry sunny bank, in gravelly 
soil, a short space from the spot it formerly inhabited, and, although 
in a very public situation, where it was exposed to the merciless tread 
417 
of the multitude, and the ravages of children attracted by its beautiful 
flowers, still it bore a very healthy appearance.
1 may, however, re- 
mark that the specimens were not of very great height, the tallest not 
exceeding a foot and a half.
Should this interesting plant be a desideratum with any of your 
readers, I shall feel a pleasure in communicating specimens.

Stray Tlioughts on Botanical Rambles and Visits ; suggested hy Mr.
Hewett Cottrell JVatson^s " Remarks on the usefulness of a 
Periodical devoted to British Botany^ By G.
Lawson, Esq.
In perusing Mr. Watson's " Remarks on the usefulness of a Perio- 
dical devoted to British Botany," which appeared in the January 
number of the ' Phytologist'' (Phytol.
ii.
379), I was somewhat surpris- 
ed to notice the disrespect with which he regards the contributions 
which appear under the head of "rambles and visits," for I have all 
along considered contributions of such a character highly valuable, 
not the less from their being amusing and interesting than being in- 
structive and highly beneficial to science, and always up till the date 
of the appearance of Mr. Watson's paper, 1 have been under the im- 
pression that such was the universal opinion of botanists on the point.
I am sori-y to occupy any of your valuable space with remarks on 
this subject, and would have said not a word in regard to it j but 
when I consider that what Mr. Watson has stated may, if allowed to 
pass without observation, be the means of deterring many able con- 
tributors from transmitting you for record their valuable observations, 
which, perhaps, from circumstances could be put into no other feasi- 
ble shape than a " ramble " or a " visit," I feel called upon to make a 
few remarks, and these tending to show that all the readers do not, or 
at least ought not to peruse what he is pleased to class amongst the 
" poorest contributions" with the same indignant spirit.
I shall, 
however, be very brief, as I am fully aware that the pages of the 
* Phytologist ' might be occupied by matter which would prove much 
more intei-esting to the readers generally than the present.
The reason Mr. Watson urges for the exclusion of such contribu- 
tions is, I admit, one of very great importance ; but 1 really do not 
think that the end in view, viz., the rendering the 'Phytologist' "a 
418 
complete record and index of all that is done or discovered in British 
Botany," can possibly be gained by such means, for the very fact of 
these being excluded would show the * Phytologist ' not to be a com- 
plete record.
If such articles are to be excluded, I am fully satisfied 
that many doings and discoveries would never be made known to the 
world, but remain, to all intents and purposes useless, in the pages of 
private note-books.
For in a ramble many facts may be stated, and 
interesting facts, too, which might never be supposed worthy of a 
place in any journal in the shape of separate articles, and even pub- 
lished in such a form, I hesitate not to say, that in very many, if not 
in all cases, they would occupy much more space than if amalgamated 
in the form of a ramble.
I can therefore see no reason whatever for 
the exclusion of rambles from the pages of the ' Phytologist.' 
The principal feature for tvhich I love rambles, is the much useful 
information which through them is conveyed to the reader of the ge- 
neral appearance of vegetation in particular localities, for although a 
list of the rarer plants of a certain locality may be interesting, its in- 
terest must be greatly enhanced by a knowledge of the plants com- 
posing the greater portion of the vegetation of that locality, it being 
not exclusively by observations on rare, and what is generally meant 
by the term " interesting" plants, that science is benefitted.
But besides this, and a host of other pleas for botanical " rambles," 
there is the pleasure in reading a ramble, which to me, and I should 
think to every lover of Flora is very great, and ought to be taken into 
account.
If there is a pleasure in botanizing, and few of the readers 
of the ' Phytologist' will deny the fact that there is, then there must 
be a pleasure in reading a ramble.
By such we are carried in imagi- 
nation to the scene of action â€” we gaze on the lovely flowers â€” we 
cull the rarities, and all without pains or exertion on our part, being 
all the while comfortably seated in our studio.
1 cannot allow the present opportunity to pass without expressing 
my heartfelt gratitude to the many able gentlemen who have so libe- 
rally contributed " rambles " to the ' Phytologist,' for I consider the 
rambles to be amongst the most valuable articles, and I sincerely trust 
that some other means than the exclusion of that interesting portion 
of the contributions will be found for the completion of your 
ably-conducted Journal, as a full record of botanical discovery in the 
British Isles, and it is almost such already.
The only way in which the object in view can be properly accom- 
plished is, I think, by the addition of a few pages sufficient to contain 
the additional matter.
A very few additional pages would suffice.
419 
and I cannot think for a moment that any of the readers would hesi- 
tate in giving a few additional pence for the carrying out of so 
desirable an object.
If this is not done, but the "rambles" and 
" visits " excluded, the ' Phytologist ' will lose much of its interest.
It will then become a mere " matter-of-fact " record, similar in all 
respects to the diary or ledger of a man of business, and will not be 
perused with so much interest or be of the like service to science it is 
at present.
It is important that facts be recorded not only in the 
pages of the * Phytologist ' but on the mind of every student of sci- 
ence, and this can only be done by a familiar narration, which is 
most easily got at in such a form as that referred to, viz., a " ramble " 
or a " visit." 
I have long ere now conversed with several botanists on the sub- 
ject, and have found their opinions of rambles to agree in every par- 
ticular with my own.
Mr. Watson suggests as another means of adding to the space 
required for the admission of the additional matter " the easy and re- 
quired process of pruning down those exuberant articles, whose 
purpose is little more than to say over again matters previously on 
record, and sufficiently well understood." I may, however, remark in 
regard to this, that I have very seldom, if ever, met with such articles 
in the pages of the ' Phytologist.' Indeed, I have not, as yet, read 
an article in it which 'pruning would not materially injure, and I am 
fully satisfied that the remedy here would be worse than the disease, 
for if " pruning " is resorted to, much information must necessarily be 
omitted.
There is a decided difference betwixt literary and scien- 
tific periodicals : the articles for the former may be pruned, but it is 
dangerous to prune the latter.
I fear, however, I have already extended my notes too far, but hope 
the importance of the subject in hand, though not strictly speaking 
botanical^ will plead my excuse for thus trespassing on your valuable 
pages.
I mean no offence to Mr. Watson, and hope he will take my 
remarks kindly, for in such a spirit are they given.

On the occurrence of Mimulus luteus in South Wales.
By the Rev.
W. T.
Bree, M.A.
Mr. Lawson, in the January number of the ' Phytologist' (Phytol.
ii.
389), records the fact of Mimulus luteus having been met with in 
several situations in Scotland " quite naturalized," and he adds, "it 
may be indigenous ;" and he requests that those who may have met 
with the plant in other situations, would communicate the circum- 
stance through the medium of the ' Phytologist.' I take the opportu- 
nity, therefore, of stating for the information of Mr Lawson and others 
who may be interested in the subject, that so long ago as the summer 
of 1824, T met with Mimulus luteus naturalized and thriving robustly 
on the boggy margin of a mountain rill, not more than a mile or two 
from Abergavenny (see Mag. Nat.
Hist., Vol. v.
p. 198).
The plant 
was in flower, and attracted the eye at a distance by the profusion of 
its bright yellow blossoms, making a most showy appearance, far 
more so, indeed, than I had ever seen it do in a cultivated state.
The 
place, in short, seemed to suit it.
Not having the remotest idea that 
the plant was indigenous in that situation, or other than introduced 
by the hand of man, I did not think it worth while even to preserve 
specimens.
It appears to me extremely improbable that a plant so 
conspicuous, if really indigenous, should have so long escaped the 
notice of botanists, or even of common observers.
If truly a native, 
it would, I think, have been one of the oldest inhabitants of the gar- 
den, instead of being indebted to comparatively modern days for its 
introduction.
Nevertheless, its occurrence in several distant locali- 
ties favours, in some slight degree, its claims as a native.
The plant 
near Abergavenny, 1 may add, so far as I have observed, appeared to 
be confined to one spot only, which, again, is another circumstance 
militating against the notion of its being truly indigenous.

Occurrence of Mimulus luteus near Stirling.
By F.
Townsend, Esq.
You will oblige me by the insertion of the following in the next 
number of the ' Phytologist.' 
I am happy to record another station in Scotland for Mimulus lu- 
teus, which plant I found in July, 1845, growing sparingly on the 
421 
banks of the Forth, rather less than a quarter of a mile above the 
bridge at Stirling.
I did not pursue my course further up the river, 
or I might have met with other specimens.
At the time of gathering 
the plant I supposed it to have escaped from a garden, probably car- 
ried down the river, and thence naturalized where 1 found it.
But 
the additional stations given by Prof.
Balfour and Mr. Lawson render 
the above worthy of note, tending to prove that Mimulus luteus, 
either will soon become generally naturalized, or has claims to be 
considered an indigenous genus.
It appears that the plant is easily 
propagated, enduring the severest frosts, and requiring no particular 
soil, but a damp situation.
Loudon gives the date of its introduction 
1826, ' Bot. Reg.

On the occurrence of Mimulus luteus in Perthshire and Forfarshire.
By William Jackson, Jun., Esq.
Tn the last number of the 'Phytologist' my friend Mr. Lawson has 
recorded the existence of Mimulus luteus, as being perfectly natura- 
lized in two stations in Forfarshire.
In corroboration of Mr. Law- 
son's statement, I may mention that it is now upwards of fifteen years 
since I remember first seeing the plant growing by the side of Inver- 
gowrie burn.
My father tells me he recollects having found it 
growing to all appearance truly wild and at large, more than twenty- 
two years ago, in the same locality, and I believe it was known to 
some botanists a good many years previous to that date, and supposed 
to be a South American plant naturalized.
At the above station the 
plant may be indigenous, as I am unable to procure any information 
of its being planted there by the hand of man, or of its escape from a 
garden.
It may, however, have been washed down by the stream 
from some garden and deposited on its banks.
Last summer I found this showy plant growing luxuriantly and 
apparently wild, in Perthshire, occupying a considerable extent on 
the banks of the Tay, a little below the picturesque ruins of Kinclaven 
Castle, which stands at the junction of the rivers Tay and Islay, em- 
bowered amongst lovely woods and waters.
At this part of the river 
the banks are beautifully clothed with gigantic trees, while the water 
runs smooth and placid over a pebbly bed.
Such observations as 
Mr. Lawson's are extremely useful, as they tend, in a great measure.

to illustrate the history of numerous foreign plants, now entirely na- 
turalized in our island, and which deserve as good a place in the 
British Flora as some others, such as Saxifraga umbrosa, which the 
Rev. W.
T. Bree I think, has clearly shown to be of exotic origin 
(Annals Nat. History).
A correspondent to Grove's 'Naturalist's 
Journal,' published in 1832, mentions Mimulus luteus as being "na- 
turalized in various places throughout the country," without speci- 
fying the stations ; this is the more to be regretted, as a complete list 
of the stations where found growing would be extremely interesting, 
with the dates when first found recorded.

By James Backhouse, Jun.
During a short tour among the lakes and mountains of Cumber- 
land and Westmoreland, in the 7th month of last year, I left the inn 
at Patterdale with two companions and a guide, on a gloomy after- 
noon, to ascend Helvellyn.
We took the course up Grisedale, and 
after a long, yet easy ascent, reached the foot of the " Striding Edge." 
Here the wind was so strong that we hesitated a little before deter- 
mining to take this exposed and narrow ridge for our course, instead 
of the easier way of passing over the foot of Catchedicam and along 
the " Swirrel Edge." Yet as we learned from the guide that the for- 
mer ridge was the best locality on the mountain for plants, we con- 
cluded to try it.
We therefore ascended to the first point, which is 
the highest part of it.
Here, under the shelter of the craggy rocks, 
we rested awhile, and enjoyed the fine prospect beneath and around.
Many hundred feet below us, on one side was the beautiful valley of 
Grisedale, watered by a mountain stream, and backed by the tower- 
ing rocks of St. Sunday, Crag and Fairfield.
On the other side, in a dark hollow far beneath our feet, lay the 
Red Tarn, hemmed in by the precipices of the Swirrell Edge and the 
sharply-peaked Catchedicam, behind which Skiddaw reared his head 
in the distance.
This Tarn is more than 2400 feet above the level of 
the sea ; its surface was agitated by the violence of the wind, which 
roared among the bleak and barren rocks over which we had to pass 
423 
before reaching the summit of Helvellyn.
In proceeding, the first 
plant of interest which attracted my attention was Saxifraga stellaris, 
scattered in solitary tufts among the crevices of the rock.
In Tees- 
dale this plant is almost entirely confined, so far as I have seen, to 
boggy places, not on rocks.
Further on I noticed Sedum Rhodiola 
and Oxyria reniformis, the latter in tolerable abundance.
On the 
rocks towards the western extremity of the ridge I found some fine 
tufts of Cerastium alpinum, a plant frequently met with in Scotland, 
but not, that I know of, recorded in any botanical work as a native of 
England.
I also saw a Hieracium of dwarf habit, with large downy 
buds, to which I should like to call* the attention of those who may 
hereafter visit this spot.
Besides these, Salix herbacea in seed, was 
the only plant I observed worth mentioning.
When we reached the 
summit of the mountain we were completely enveloped with fog and 
cloud, so that we could see nothing but the upper part of the deep 
gorges and chasms in the precipitous cliffs with which the top of the 
mountain is faced.
We therefore made our way against wind and 
rain, down to Gh-isedale Tarn, where I left my companions and the 
guide, and crossing the hollow between Seat Sandal and Fairfield, 
took the course of a mountain stream, which ultimately guided me to 
the Keswick road at a point between five and six miles from the sum- 
mit of Helvellyn.
With another five miles' walk I reached Ambleside 
in safety about 10 o'clock.
I may perhaps here mention a few other plants which I noticed in 
this district.
Ranunculus hederaceus with remarkably large flowers, pi'obably R.
hederaceus /3, grandijlorus of Babington, near the head of Coniston 
Lake.
This may be a common mountain plant, but it was new to me.
Symphytum tuberosum, near Foxhow, the residence of the lamented 
Dr. Arnold.
This I think was the true tuberosum ; it produced soli- 
tary stems, rarely exceeding two feet in height, with flowers of a dull 
pale yellow, and leaves scarcely, if at all, decurrent.
Teesdalia nudicaulis, among the tumbled rocks on the face of 
Loughrigg Fell.
Hymenophyllum Wilsoni, of unusually large size at Dungeon Gill.
The longest frond I measured exceeded A^ inches in length ; some of 
the fronds also were strongly forked.
Pyrola minor, near Stock Gill Force.
Geranium Vliaum, foot of Loughrigg Fell.
Isoetes lacustris, and Lobelia Dortmanna , in Crummock Lake.

Notice of ^A Flora of Tunhridge Wells, being a list of indigenous 
Plants within a Radius of Fifteen Miles round that Place.
By 
Edward Jenner, A.L.S, 
This Flora appears to have been founded upon the original ' Flora 
Tunhrigensis'' of the late Mr. T.
F. Forster, but is by no means an 
idle copy of that work.
Most of the species and stations have been 
verified afresh, while many others are added to those previously 
recorded in the work of Mr. Forster.
The additions seem partly at- 
tributable to the more extended space over which the present Flora 
is made to range ; but several of the more recently discovered plants 
and localities are within the more narrow circle of the earlier work.
The volume is of portable size, neatly got up, and well calculated to 
be serviceable to botanical collectors who may visit Tunbridge or its 
neighbourhood ; besides supplying a very full list of species to those 
who may have occasion to make use of such a list at a distance.
The 
discovery of Carex montana, the most interesting novelty of the Flora, 
has been already recorded in the ' Phytologist ' (ii.
289).
C. 
Notices uf North of England Plants.
By W.
Borrer, Esq., F.R.S.
Instigated by a perusal of Mr. G.
S. Gibson's 'Notes' in the 'Phy- 
tologist' of the present month, (Phytol.
ii.
373), I send a few notices, 
chiefly of my own want of success in some recent botanical researches 
in the same parts of England.
At Helmsley, May 28, 1844, I was more fortunate than Mr. Gibson.
The weather was fine, and James Spence, the gardener who showed 
Mr. Woods " the hole from which the last specimen of Cypripedium 
was dug in May, 1834" (Comp.
to Bot. Mag.
i. 192), guided me up 
the beautiful valley of Birkdale to the same spot, where was now 
coming up, weakly and with no sign of flowering, the only plant, as 
he stated, that he had found since Mr. Woods' visit.
He had shown 
it in 1843 to a botanist, whom he had permitted to cut off the flower- 
ing stem, but, mindful of Mr. Woods' threat of an Act of Parliament 
to hang him, he had not allowed the root to be disturbed.
Hellebo- 
rus viridis (as remarked by Mr. Woods) and Actaea spicata abound in 
the wood.
The old man who so carefully guards the Orchideae on 
the Rievaulx terrace from the sythe, by marking them with sticks, 
told me that he had once found a single specimen of Cypripedium.
425 
In two gardens at Keswick I saw this beautiful plant, thriving and in 
full flower, early in June.
The roots were supposed to have been 
brought from a wood in Legberthwaite ; but understanding the spe- 
cies to be now lost there, and having seen it in Yorkshire and ga- 
thered it in Durham, I did not visit the locality.
I subsequently 
searched a reported station in Fairfield, among debris of rocks, be- 
tween Rydal-head and the Dove Crag, but, I acknowledge, without 
expectation of finding it.
In Teesdale, August, 1845, I had the pleasure of seeing Hieracium 
Lapeyrousii [Bab.), and the other species named by Mr. Gibson, and 
H. inuloides in addition, but sought in vain for Arenaria uliginosa, 
although the younger Mr. Backhouse, the actual discoverer, I believe, 
had kindly given me a most accurate direction to the station.
It is 
said that the place was visited by another collector subsequently to 
the discovery, and I fear the plant may have been extirpated.
Yet, 
surely, it may be expected to re-appear.
Arenaria verna abounds 
there.
Juncus triglumis grows by the stream in one place ; and some 
of the good Teesdale plants, Gentiana verna, Kobresia caricina, Carex 
capillaris, are in plenty near at hand.
Poa Parnellii occurs at Caldron Snout, and at the confluence of 
the Greta, the highest and the lowest points that I visited of the course 
of the Tees, and in various places between.
Rmnex aquaticus seems common in Teesdale.
In some wet mea- 
dows it is a troublesome weed.
Guided by "Kit Dent" of Cotherstone, early in June, 1842, I vi- 
sited the spot by Balderdale where he had long before discovered 
Saxifraga Hirculus.
It is in some boggy rills in the Cotherstone 
Fells, which, uniting, form a little gully, and fall, after a very short 
course, into the Balder, a mile or two above the highest farm-house 
by the valley, and perhaps about the same distance below the other 
station by the junction of the Black Beck.
The place is well marked 
by a solitary old mountain ash, the only tree in the neighbourhood, a 
very little way above the gully, and on the opposite side of the river.
The plant was not in flower, of course.
I did not go to the Black 
Beck.
I am glad to learn that Woodsia ilvensis still exists at the Falcon 
Glints.
I saw it there in 1842.
I have not visited the spot since.
I could not find Equisetum umbrosum at Winch Bridge.
E. vari- 
egatum was there, and the common E.
arvense.
Epilohium virgatum grows near Barnard Castle, by the road to 
Greta Bridge, and by the Gormire Pool near Thirsk.
By this pool a 
426 
youth who accompanied me rediscovered Lysimachia thyrsiflora, 
which, as T was told at York, had been sought for there in vain since 
Mr. Woods observed it in 1835.
We found it in very small quantity: 
a remarkable circumstance of a plant that usually spreads so exten- 
sively by root.
I saw it and the Scheuchzeria in plenty in Leckby 
Carr, in May, 1844.
For the latter, however, I had a long search, 
finding it at last about the middle of the bog, where it would be 
scarcely accessible except in a particularly dry season.
Myriophyllum alteriiifoUmn grows in Gormire, and Potamogeton 
heterophyllus in abundance, and another Potamogeton, about which I 
am in doubt.
It has very long leaves and fruit- stalks, and the point 
of the leaf is somewhat hooded ; whence at the time of gathering it I 
supposed it P.
praelongus.
I met with it again, again accompanied 
by the Myriophyllum, in the mountain pool in Place Fell, by Ulles- 
water, called the Angle Tam. I saw the true P.
praelongus in Win- 
dermere, near the Ferry Inn, over against Bowness.
I sought twice, 
June and July, 1844, for P.
longifolius in Rydal Water, Mr. John 
Ball having given me a barren specimen so named, of his own gather- 
ing in that place.
I found a great quantity of P.
heterophyllus ; and 
upon subsequent examination, with Mr. Babington, Mr. Ball's speci- 
men proved to be, in fact, of the same species.
I am not aware that 
the true P.
longifolius (Mr. Ball's Irish plant) has been observed in 
England.
I have not seen the specimens of Mr. Ball's Linaria from "the rocks 
of Coniston Water," of which Mr. Babington says, " If the seeds I 
have with the specimens are correctly referrible to the plant (I have 
no ripe capsules), it is a very distinct species, and as far as I have yet 
seen quite new." It had been supposed L.
italica.
I found on a rock 
by the road on the lake side, in quite a wild place, near Nibsthwaite, 
a variety of L.
repens with a white unstriped flower, which I saw 
afterwards near Newby-bridge, on a dwarf wall facing a lawn by the 
road to Stavely, and in gardens at Stavely and at Ambleside.
I have 
seen it also among the common L.
repens, in Normandy, near Rouen.
I have not, indeed, examined the seeds, my specimens being in an 
early state of flowering ; but I have no doubt that I refer it correctly 
to L.
repens.
There seems reason to suppose the Truro and South- 
ampton " L.
Bauhinii," or L.
italica, a hybrid between L.
repens and 
L. vulgaris, such as Dr. Bromfield has found in the Isle of Wight.
I 
believe that Mr. Babington now thinks the Irish plant different from 
all these, and a specimen that he has given me looks so.
L. purpurea 
grows in some quantity on the ruins at Barnard Castle : I have seen 
427 
it escaped occasionally in the south of England.
L. Cymbalaria has 
indeed a very wild appearance in many parts of the country.
It is 
become very common in Sussex since I brought it in my pocket, when 
a boy, from Westminster Bridge, the first time I ever met with it.
I 
have seen it looking very native-like near Boxgrove, not, as usual, on 
a wall, but on a hedge-bank by the road-side.
I know not whether 
it continues there.
I can scarcely doubt that Impatiens Noli-me-tangere is truly indi- 
genous in Westmoreland.
It is not confined to Stock Gill (where I 
saw it in 1810, and where, as Mr. Gibson observes, it still grows), but 
far up the Scandale Beck, and separated from Stock Gill by the ridge 
running down from the Snaka Moss, and in various places by Win- 
dermere, into which lake the waters of both these streams, after unit- 
ing with the Rothay and the Brathay, are ultimately discharged.
Spircea salicifolia has long been recorded as a native of the shores 
of Windermere ; yet I regard it as most probably introduced, like 
Rosa alpina, of which there are many bushes along the road through 
the Bellegrange woods on the western shore.
The Spiraea grows also 
in a hedge by the road from Penrith to Wigton, not far from Hutton 
Hall.
I doubt much whether it is truly indigenous anywhere in Bri- 
tain.
It was quite naturalized near Dunkeld, as long ago as 1808 ; 
but we learned that it had been planted.
It has been planted too 
near Bala, North Wales, in various places along the road towards 
Corwen, where a stranger, without inquiry, might well believe it a 
native.
I have not seen it by the Dee below Bala, where Mr. Woods 
observed it many years ago ; but I should suppose it very likely to 
have been carried down from some garden by the river.
Meconopsis cambrica occurs in many places in the lake district : 1 
should suppose it indigenous.
Jiincus Jiliformis grows by Thirlemere, on the west shore of the 
upper lake, and in a meadow at its head, as well as in the long-known 
place near Keswick.
Miss Wright showed me Rosa gracilis {Woods) in Mr. Woods' ori- 
ginal place, by the road over Whinlatter.
The rose in " Howrey 
Field," Keswick, which has been taken for R.
cinnamomea, is the 
American R.
lucida.
There are two plants of it in the hedge near 
the junction of the river Greta with the Derwent, and they are spread- 
ing by their creeping roots.
I saw a quantity of the common double- 
flowered R.
cinnamomea in a hedge by the road from Bowness to 
Kendal, â€” planted, of course.
By the Crummock Lake, by the road 
from Buttermere to Scale Hill, I found one bush of a rose which Mr.
428 
Woods is inclined to agree with me in referring to R.
hibernica, al- 
though its leaves are smooth.
Rumex alpinus grows by the road-side about a mile from Mun- 
grisedale towards Greystoke Park, accompanied by Imperatoria Os- 
truthium, in an adjoining meadow.
A cottage is near at hand.
Mr.
Wright mentioned another place where " he had seen the Rumex in 
large quantity," about the vestiges of a Roman camp.
The Impera- 
toria has a more wild appearance by Thirlemere, and by the stream 
that issues from it, near the head of the Vale of St. John, than I ha^ve 
seen it present elsewhere, either in England or in Scotland.
I had a walk of some hours in vain search for Staphylea pinnata, 
about Finsthwaite, near Newby Bridge, (misprinted Kensthwaite, in 
Bab. Man.
Bot.).
Senecio sarracenicus still grows by the river at Newby Bridge, 
where Mr. Woods observed it; also near Hutton Hall (by a stream ?) 
separated by a hedge-row from the Penrith road.
Alcheniilla alpina is common in many of the mountains.
Large 
specimens occur in Gatesgarth Pass, and larger in Wastdale Screes ; 
but, excepting in size, I saw no approach to A.
conjuncta.
Hieracium inuloides is not uncommon in the lake-district, growing 
mostly on the borders of the lakes or by streams in the valleys I 
found it however occasionally about mountain rills, â€” T recollect par- 
ticularly near Hayes Water ; and in one place, near Fox How, in a 
dry wood.
H. sabaudum occurs perhaps as commonly as H.
boreale 
in these parts.
These two grow together by the Tees about Barnard 
Castle, and look different.
H. prenanthoides 1 have seen nowhere in 
South Britain but by the river Allen, near Ridley Hall, Northumber- 
land, where it was shown me by Mr. John Thompson, the discoverer 
of Carex irrigua.
He showed me this Carex and C.
pauciflora grow- 
ing in profusion on the Muckle Moss, and beginning to flower.
May 
31, 1844 ; also, near the same place, Crepis succisaefolia, which I 
have since seen at Whelpington, Northumberland ; about the High 
Force, in Teesdale ; and in Heseldine Gill, Yorkshire, near the sta- 
tion of Saxifraga umbrosa.
Charles Wright, of Keswick, is an excellent guide, intelligent, in- 
defatigably active and intimately acquainted with the mountains: 
but with regard to the stations of rare plants discovered by him I was 
particularly unfortunate, although I took care to engage him to guide 
me to all of them in which I felt an interest, except Pyrola uniflora 
and Allium Schcenoprasum.
The Pyrola "he had found" at Bardsea, 
near Ulverstone, and he gave me a very particular direction to the 
^129 
spot ; the Allium at Dalton in Furness, where there is also other au- 
thority for its occurrence.
I found neither of them.
Of Epimedium 
alpiuum I have already spoken in the ' Phytologist,' (Phytol.
ii.
2), as 
well as of Saxifraga rotundifolia, found by Miss Wright ; and the Rev.
W. T.
Bree has communicated additional information respecting the 
latter (Id. 65).
Mr, Wright "had seen" Asarura europceum at Troutbeck, "in a spot 
which he knew well ; " a Saxifraga different from S.
hypnoides, and 
which he supposed to be S.
ca3spitosa of Hudson, or, at least, S.
mos- 
chata of Withering, in Kirkstone Pass ; another Saxifraga, allied to 
S. Aizoon, wild on rocks at Crosthwaite, Westmoreland, for which he 
showed me, as the same species, S.
Cotyledon, planted on a wall by 
Troutbeck Bridge.
We visited each of these places in vain.
Saxi- 
fraga Geum has been reported to be an English plant on the sole 
authority of Mr. Wright, who " has discovered it at the head of the 
Duddon in Bowfell," and he gave me a specimen " gathered there by 
himself." He conducted me, however, over the lofty pass of Oar 
(pronounced Ewar) Gap, in Bowfell, to some gills of Esk, not Dud- 
don, in a deep valley below, 
" A lowly vale, and yet uplifted high 
Among the mountains," 
as the places in one or other of which he had found the plant, ac- 
knowledging that, having never been there before but in thick cloud, 
he had erroneously supposed the waters to fall thence into Devon, the 
head of which, the source of the Cockley Beck, we found in a bog on 
the other side of a low green ridge ; betw^een the mountains Crinkle- 
crags and Hard Knot, I believe.
I found the walk from Seathwaite 
in Borrodale to this ridge and back a laborious one, in a bright hot 
day ; the more so perhaps as I returned without the Saxifraga : but 
the mountain-views were glorious.
" The colour and the form " of 
Great Gable, as seen at sunset that June evening, in coming from the 
Esk-hause, between Great End and Glaramara, are scarcely to be 
forgotten.
I have not been in the vale of Duddon ; but, in a walk from Conis- 
ton Water-head, by the way of the Old Man to Fell Foot in Langdale, 
I visited several of the feeders of that river, and their sources, some 
in the Coniston Fells, above Seathwaite Tarn, and some on either side 
of the Wrynose Pass, without finding any plant of much interest.
Mr. Wright told me I should find Saxifraga Geum wuld at " The 
Station," on the west side of Windermere, and all along the road from 
The Station to Newby Bridge.
It completely covers some rocks in 
Vol. ti.
3 g 
430 
the garden below The Station, but no one can doubt its having been 
planted there.
I observed one patch among stones by the lake, a lit- 
tle way out of the gardens, by the road towards Ambleside ; but not 
a plant of it could I find in a drive to and from Newby Bridge.
Se- 
dum rupestre, possibly wild, grows above the edge of the lake not far 
northward from the Ferry.
Carex stricta {Good.) grows behind the 
Ferry Inn.
The wall-tops about the towns and hamlets of this district are very 
commonly covered with various plants, chiefly Saxifrages and Sedums, 
Sax. Geura and umbrosa occasionally among them ; but neither of 
these have I seen in any place where I could regard it as indigenous, 
except the latter in its recorded station, Heselden Gill, Yorkshire.
I saw Pyrola secunda in two of Wright's places.
Wallow Crag by 
Keswick, and Fisher-place Gill, above Thrispot ; and he brought it to 
me down from some rocks in the Vale of St. John.
Of Geranium nodosum Miss Wright had no specimen to show.
I 
sent her a garden one, , in 1844, that she might know the plant.
Her 
father " had known two patches of this species by Thirlemere (or 
licatheswater), one of which had been removed to the garden at Dale 
Head," a house hard by the lake.
Of the other he knew not the fate, 
but it also had disappeared.
He showed me "where they formerly 
grew." It was on the stony bushy margin of the lake, not on any 
land now cultivated.
The plant in the garden, " brought from the 
lake-side," proved to be G.
angulatum of Curtis (Bot. Mag.
t. 203) ; a 
plant of which the native country is still, I believe, unknown, and 
which so nearly approaches G.
sylvaticum, that it might almost be 
supposed a large smooth variety of that species.
Some other not 
very common garden flowers were there : but Wright " was certain " 
that the Geranium was the very root that had grown by the lake.
G. 
sylvaticum is so abundant through the lake district as to be, in early 
summer, the great ornament of the meadows and thickets.
Its flow- 
ers are extremely variable in size, being sometimes scarcely so large 
as those of G.
pyrenaicum, and sometimes almost rivalling those of 
G. pratense.
They vary much, too, in their bluer or redder tinge ; 
and on one plant, between Rydal and Fox How, I found them of a 
pale pinkish hue, like those of G.
angulatum.
I found G.
lancastriense among the sand-hills towards the north 
end of Walney island, in moderate plenty, in immense beds of G.
san- 
guineura, of which it is a mere variety, differing only in the pale flow- 
ers.
It is not, in its native place, at all more prostrate than the red- 
flowered plants, which vary much, both in intensity of colour and in 
size of the flower.
The sandy shores in various places in the north, 
431 
at Fleetwood, for example, at Embleton, Northumberland, and at 
Hartley Pans, are richly adorned with this beautiful species.
Mr.
Storey, of Newcastle, gave me a white-flowered specimen from the 
last-named place.
The same gentleman showed me there the only 
known station of Anchusa officinalis, a spot of fifty paces by fifteen, 
and near the same place, Ruppia rostellata; as well as Eryngium 
campestre still abounding at Gateshead, although much of the ground 
it formerly occupied is now built over.
I did not visit the station of 
this plant near South Shields.
I did not go to Workington to look for Geranium striatum ; neither 
my experience elsewhere, nor Mr. Woods' statement in the ' Compa- 
nion to the Botanical Magazine,' aflfording much encouragement.
I 
have seen aspecimen of this Geranium, gathered by the Rev. Mr.
Bil- 
lingsley, in a foot-path through a wood above the Wye, near English 
Bicknor.
He saw but one plant.
I have visited the place and hunted 
in vain.
This species has established itself in the avenue to Horneck 
Castle, near Penzance, and in a neighbouring lane.
It was shown to 
me there by the Rev. H.
Penneck.
Miss Wright showed me Hieracium aurantiacum in a meadow in 
the Vale of Newlands.
It was too near to a garden, and Aconitum 
Lycoctouum was growing close by, also on the outside of the garden- 
fence.
The Hieracium " grew formerly in another meadow, farther 
from the house, which is now a corn-field " {Miss W.), and " on one 
of the islands of Derwent Water, before it was converted into its pre- 
sent state," that of a pleasure-ground, {Mr. W.) 
Lysimachia ciliata I found, by a direction kindly sent me by the 
late Mr. W.
Backhouse, immediately before his death, in the place 
where he discovered it, between Penrith and Wigton.
It is by the 
road- side, near Sebergham.
The plant forms one large patch.
Mr.
Wright had " found it in 1832," in a slate-quarry in Warnell Fells, 
about a mile from Mr. Backhouse's place.
The "one specimen which 
he gathered, and preserved a long while in his pocket-book," was 
unfortunately lost.
" The Andromeda was growing near it." I vi- 
sited the quarry, with Mr. Wright, but it had been extended on the 
side " where he had seen the plant," which was consequently no 
longer there.
There never could have been a bog for the Andromeda.
Mr. W.
introduced me to an inhabitant, of respectable appearance, 
who was " beyond convinced " that he had seen the Lysimachia in a 
large wood by the river Caldew, at some distance from Sebergham, 
in more places than one.
He accompanied me into the wood, but his 
recollection of the spots was not sufficient to find any one of them.
432 
He promised to write to me when he had found the plant again, which 
he expressed a very sanguine expectation of doing ; but I have not 
heard from him.
Mr. Backhouse observed some differences in the 
habit and mode of growtli between a Sebergham plant removed to his 
garden, and another of American origin, as he believed, that he had 
in cultivation.
Mr. Wilson showed me what seems a variety of this 
species, with broader leaves and larger flowers, quite naturalized, to- 
gether with an American Aster (by Orford Hall, 1 think it was), near 
Warrington ; and in a spot adjoining, Onoclea sensibilis was thriving 
over a considerable space of boggy ground, planted as a nursery with 
young poplars.
He told me that a botanical garden formerly existed 
there.
Borago orientalis grows in some quantity in a wood by the road- 
side at Portiuscale, near Keswick.
Mr. Wright says that it grew 
there before the adjoining house and garden were in existence; and 
that there is another station of the plant, which I did not visit, about 
half a mile from this.
He had not learned the name of the plant.
I did not go to look for Meum Athamanlicura, but Miss Wright 
sent me a recent specimen.
Having never been in the Vale of Duddon, I, of course, have not 
seen Euphorbia Cyparissias in Ulpha ; nor have I seen a specimen.
To returu once more into Northumberland, I gathered the plant so 
called from the wall at Hulne Abbey in Alnwick Park, under the kind 
guidance of Mr. Embleton, in August, 1845.
It was quite out of 
flower, and even the capsules had fallen.
I cannot speak positively, 
but I strongly suspect that it is E.
Esula in a starved state, and not 
the genuine E.
Cyparissias.
1 have the plant now in my garden, and 
hope to decide the question next summer.
Mr. Embleton took me to the place where Maianthemum bifoliura 
had been found at Howick.
The plant has been completely extir- 
pated.
The spot was close by Earl Grey's garden.
1 have since vi- 
sited Kenwood (or Caen Wood), not in Northumberland, but Lord 
Mansfield's seat near Hampstead, where the plant exists in two large 
patches ; one of them a circular one of seven paces in diameter, in a 
part of the park which is said to have been never cleared from the ab- 
original forest.
Opinion will vary as to whether it is indigenous or 
not.
It is desirable that the ancient Lancashire stations should be 
explored.
Mr. Embleton showed me Ligusticum scoticum among the stones 
on the shore at Dunstanburgh Castle.
By the bridge over the Alne, going from Alnwick towards Emble- 
433 
ton, I gathered what I take for Barbarea arcuata.
It seems to me far 
less satisfactorily distinct from B.
vulgaris than B.
stricta, which is so 
common about York and in other parts of Yorkshire, and which I first 
noticed by the side of the railway near Rotherham, and in many pla- 
ces going thence to Halifax, late in May, 1842.
Obligingly guided by Mr. Arthur Trevellyan, I visited the one plant 
of Linnaea borealis discovered many years ago by Miss Trevellyan, at 
Catcherside, some four miles from Wallington Hall.
It is a wide 
patch, in a plantation of Scotch firs, said to have been brought, about 
eighty years ago, from Norway.
Pyrola minor grows with it; and 
Sedura villosum on the neighbouring moor.
I regretted want of time to visit the pool in which Mr. Winch dis- 
covered his Nuphar pumila.
Mr. Trevellyan pointed out the direc- 
tion in which it lies, some miles over the moor from Catcherside, and 
showed me the plant in a pond at Wallington, to which it had been 
brought.
I have had it long in my own garden, from a plant origi- 
nally sent from Northumberland (by Mr. Winch, I believe) to the 
Oxford Botanic Garden.
It is not the true N.
pumila.
I have re- 
garded it as a small variety of N.
lutea, but it deserves further atten- 
tion.
It may possibly be N.
tenella, of which Reichenbach gives a 
character under N.
sericea, in his 'Plantae Criticae' (cent.
2, p.
10) and 
' Flora Excursoria ' (p.
14).
I regretted still more that I had not time to go to Wall Town for 
Allium Schoenoprasum.
Mr. Thompson has some idea that there are 
two species in that neighbourhood, confounded under this name.' 
Some living plants that he has kindly sent me, have the upright habit 
of the chives of our gardens, but the leaves are rough as in A.
sibi- 
ricum.
If I had not the satisfaction of verifying Mr. Wright's discoveries, 
I had no better success in hunting for Hudson's lost plants, his Saxi- 
fraga csespitosa, Hieracium dubium and H.
Auricula.
For want of 
time and fine weather I did not ascend Loughrigg Fell, nor Wansfell ; 
but I left scarcely any other mountain " above Ambleside " unvisited.
A thorough investigation of those mountains, however, would require 
weeks, or months, and Hudson's plants, and many a plant as yet un- 
observed besides, may perhaps reward the industry of future visitants.
I flattered myself that I had got a clew to the Saxifrage, when I ob- 
served S.
hirta on a rock in the chapel-yard at Rydal, and was shown 
the same on a planted rock in the gaiden at Rydal Hall, by the cha- 
pel-clerk, George Bankes, who is also gardener to Mrs. Arnold, at 
Fox How, and assured by him that it had been planted in both places 
434 
by himself, and that he had originally brought it many years ago from 
the neighbouring fells.
He was not aware of the rarity of the plant, 
not having distinguished it from S.
hypnoides, and he could not tell 
precisely where he had found it ; but he had no recollection of bring- 
ing any Saxifrage from any place but a ruined ancient wall, that tra- 
verses the breast of the mountain, below the Rydal Pikes, for a mile 
or more.
I did not fail to search the wall thoroughly, and that twice, 
through its whole length : but I found no Saxifrage of this group, 
either on the wall or on the neighbouring rocks, but S.
hypnoides, 
which is common in this and other branches of Fairfield, and varies 
much in size of flower and width of petals.
S. platypetala itself, 
which grows in plenty in the eastern precipices of Fairfield, is per- 
haps but a variety.
In justice to my respectable informant, I must 
declare my confidence in his sincere belief that he brought the S.
hirta 
from a wild place in the mountains, although I had not the good for- 
tune to find it.
In several excursions in Fairfield I traversed almost 
the whole of the main ridge, from the Red Screes above Kirkstone 
to the opposite extremity above Grisedale, and all its southern 
branches, distinguished as the Scandale, Rydal, and Grasmere Fells.
I clambered too among the eastern precipices in a few points, and 
saw, 1 believe, all the scarcer plants found there by modern botanists, 
except Saxifraga oppositifolia, which, by the way, I found in plenty 
on Ingleborough ; but, except a moss or two, added nothing new.
Hieracia do not abound there.
The most common are, perhaps, va- 
rieties, some more, some less glaucous, of H.
Schmidtii of Tausch.
The glaucous and spotted-leaved " H.
murorum," so common in some 
parts of Wales, which has been mistaken for H.
maculatum [Smith), 
I saw in the mountains, I think only in the Rydal Pikes, and there 
sparingly.
Another spotted-leaved plant, H.
rigidum, y.
pictum {Bab.
Man. Bot.), 1 did not observe here, but Mr. Thompson showed it me in 
Tynedale, and I saw it and H.
Lawsoni in some gills of the Great 
End mountain towards Wastdale.
H. Lawsoni was also very fine on 
rocks due west of the inn at the head of Kirkstone Pass.
Stockgill is 
rich in Hieracia of the murorum group.
Among them is one which I 
fancy may be H.
nudicaule of Edmondston.
I gathered the same by 
the Findhorn, and by some other Highland streams, in 1810 ; but I 
have never satisfied myself about it.
I hope now to study it under 
cultivation.
[See Phytol.
ii.
184, Ed.] 
I see no reason to doubt that Hudson's " Dalehead, non longe a 
Grassmere in IVesfmorelandia" is, as Mr. Otley suggested to me, 
above Easedale, between the High Raise and Steel Fell mountains.
435 
where are some small pools almost filled up, one or other of which is 
the Daleheatl Tarn of some of the maps, and whence the waters fall 
into Cumberland, North, and into Westmoreland, South.
I ascended 
to this place both from Wythburn and from Grasmere, and sought for 
" H.
Auricula " as assiduously as my time in the two walks admitted.
I left ample space, however, uninvestigated, and great choice of gills 
and dry rocks, grassy turf and bog, in which the plant may yet be 
found again.
I had the good fortune to meet with a few plants of H.
alpinum at Langdale Pikes.
They were in leaf only ; but I cannot 
doubt the species, although, at the time, I hoped T had got " H.
Au- 
ricula." 1 have no idea that the Dale-head mountain above New- 
lands can be Hudson's place ; although Wright told me that a speci- 
men labelled as one or the other of Hudson's Hieracia, from Dale 
Head, " near Keswick^'' from the late Bishop Goodenough's collec- 
tion, exists in the museum of some institution at Carlisle.
I walked 
from the Gatesgarth Pass, over that mountain and the neighbouring 
Hindscorth, into the Vale of Newlands, but found nothing of much 
interest.
There are some interesting brambles among the lakes; but I will 
say nothing more about them than that the form which abounds in the 
Rydal Woods, not exactly to the exclusion of all its congeners, is not 
the Rubus Bellardi ( Weihe), as Turner's specimen in the Smithian 
herbarium hasd led me to suspect.
I believe I brought home two of the grasses recently distinguished 
by Parnell : Poa subcompressa, from a bridge-wall at Greta Bridge ; 
and Poa polynoda, from rocks at the Colwith Force, Langdale, near 
Ambleside.
In mosses I was as fortunate as one so slightly acquainted with the 
tribe could expect to be.
I will mention a few of the best that I met 
with.
CEdipodiimi Griffithianum.
On the higher mountains, Bowfell, Fair- 
field, High Raise, &c., on soil in crevices of the rocks, not rare.
Zygodon Mougeotii, B.
& S.
In dry chasms of rocks in many places: 
barren.

Rocks due west of the house at the head 
of Kirkstone Pass ; Wallow Crag, by Keswick ; Dove Crag, in 
Fairfield : barren.

Mr. Spruce previously found it.

the road toKirkstone; Dove Crag, Fairfield; among birch-trees 
by the side of Riddingdale, Haweswater : barren.

Common in mountain rills : fruiting abundantly 
in Kirkstone Pass, and in Wythburn Beck.

Common in the mountains, but usually barren : 
with capsules in Wastdale Screes ; and in Smelt-house Gill, at 
the foot of Cawsey Pike.

thered it.
Duvallii.
B. & S.
} Barren from a gill in Glaramara.
I brought home also two or three other barren mosses, apparently 
Brya, which friends, more learned than myself, have not positively 
determined.
Of lichens I saw but few of much interest, although the leafy ones 
were very luxuriant in many places.
Mrs. Stanger gave me Peltidea 
aphthosa, with fine apothecia, just gathered by herself near Grange 
Bridge, Borrowdale; and I found it in the same state on mossy rocks 
on the west side of Thirleniere, in June, 1844.
Stereocaulon denu- 
datum is common in the mountains, but rare in fruit.
I found a few 
^137 
specimens in that state near the summit of Rydal Pikes.
I did not 
meet with S.
paschale, nor S.
corallinura.
S. Cereolus I found, very 
fine, on a wall by Wastwater.
Lecanora upsaliensis spread among 
the thin herbage of some of the mountain-tops, Grasmere Fell, for ex- 
ample, and Dale Head above Newlands.
I observed Verrucaria laevigata, very fine, in the bed of the Tees at 
Barnard Castle, and one patch of V.
isidoides [Pertusaria of Hooker 
in Brit.
Flor.) at the High Force.
I believe this lichen has heretofore 
been found only by Miss Hutchins, who discovered it near Bantry.
I was sorry to learn from Mr. Robertson that the station of Endocar- 
pon euplacum [Ach.) near Newcastle, the only known one in Britain, 
is destroyed, a quay, I think he said, now occupying the place.
I will now bring my rambling and egotistical gossip to a conclu- 
sion ; wishing to future visitants more success in finding the rare 
plants of these interesting districts, and as much enjoyment as I had 
in hunting for them.

Notice of a ' Flora of Shetland ; comprehending a list of the Flower- 
ing and Cryptogamic Plants of the Shetland Isles, with re- 
marks on their Topography, Geology and Climate.
By Thomas 
Edmonston, Professor of Botany in the Andersonian University 
of Glasgow, 1845.' 
Circumstances, unimportant to the readers of the ' Phytologist,' 
interfered with an earlier notice of the ' Flora of Shetland,' published 
by Mr. Edmonston when about to quit the shores of Britain, on an 
important botanical expedition, which is likely to occupy him for 
several years (Phytol.
ii.
185).
It seems that Mr. E.
is a Shetland 
"rrtra avis'" in his botanical acquirements, since we are told in the In- 
troduction to his volume, that he " has never heard of any native who 
had studied the science," saving himself The ground was new and 
all his own ; but novelty has its disadvantages along with its plea- 
sures.
The botanist who writes a Flora of a cluster of islets, whereon 
dwelleth no second votary of the floral goddess, is likely to find few 
purchasers, and still fewer readers of his book.
He must look for the 
latter, at least, among those who occupy themselves with the geogra- 
phical relations of plants.
And, indeed, from the position of the 
Shetland Isles, like a connecting step between Great Britain and the 
more arctic islands, subject to the crown of Denmark, a list of their 
plants will possess more geographical interest than usually attaches 
to a local Flora for a very limited tract.
Until their floral produc- 
tions were investigated by Mr. Edmondston, these " hundred isles " 
remained almost a terra incognita in a botanical view ; and hence, 
however small its usefulness to the non-botanical islanders, the 'Flora 
of Shetland' is nevertheless a publication of some importance in the 
literature of Botany.
The volume includes a list of all the species (fungi excepted) which 
have been detected in the isles by the zealous author of the work.
The phanerogamic portion of the list comprises about three hundred 
and thirty species.
Adding thirteen Filices, four species of Equise- 
tum and three of Lycopodium, we have an islet Flora of three hun- 
dred and fifty species, exclusive of the strictly cellular plants.
Al- 
though the author intimates that the group of isles has not 'been fully 
examined, we believe this numerical result may be accepted as a 
probable approximation to their true floral census, which is not likely 
to exceed four hundred species, even should it hereafter be raised to 
that number.
The data afforded by the neighbouring islands, both 
southward and northward of Shetland, appear to justify this supposi- 
439 
tion.
Messrs.
Babington and Balfour detected three hundred and 
thh-ty-eight species in the outer Hebrides, during a short tour in those 
more southerly isles, at the most favourable season of the year for 
ascertaining their plants.
The number reported for the Orkney Isles, 
indeed, exceeds four hundred ; but the list is brought under that 
number by deducting many species which have been reported on 
authority botanically insufficient, and which are very unlikely to be 
found so far north.
The Flora of the Faroe Isles, as reported by 
Mr. Trevelyan, includes only two hundred and eighty species, while 
that of Iceland embraces three hundred and seventy species.
Thus 
there seems fair reason to believe that Mr. Edmondston's botanical 
industry and research have supplied us with a creditably copious and 
pretty complete list of Shetland plants, although some few of the spe- 
cies may have been left out.
But doubtless a goodly number of those 
enumerated in his volume, more especially the agricultural weeds, 
owe their existence in Shetland to the operations and importations of 
farmers or others.
The most novel feature of the work can scarcely be accounted a 
recommendation, being one which makes troublesome any reference 
to its contents, to ascertain the presence or absence of certain species.
This is a new scheme of classification, imperfectly explained, and 
considerably at variance from our preconceived ideas on that debate- 
able subject.
Several of our author's orders are exactly identical with 
those which are generally or universally adopted by systematists, by 
reason of the close and well marked similarities of the plants includ- 
ed in them, such, for instance, as the Gramineae and Cyperaceae, or 
the CrucifersB and Umbellatas.
But other orders bear very much the 
look of arbitrary assemblages of things having little in common, and 
nothing whereby to distinguish them satisfactorily from other groups.
One of these assemblages, designated " Speciosse," includes the fol- 
lowing genera : Anagallis, Armeria, Statice, Primula, Menyanthes, 
Erythraea, Azalea, Jasione, Campanula, Caprifolium, Gentiana, Trien- 
talis â€” an odd sort of assemblage, and more odd still in this (which 
is the author's own) arranged series of the genera.
We have another 
order, under the name of " Diandriae," which includes Pinguicula, 
Utricularia and Veronica, Another combines Scabiosa, Plantago, 
Asperula, Galium, Littorella.
The leading idea of the scheme would 
seem to run upon some dovetailing together of the Linnean and Jus- 
sieuan principles of classification â€” the sexual and natural systems.
This has frequently been attempted by young botanists, or by older 
heads to which advancing age had not brought wisdom ; and the at- 
tempt has always proved a failure.
440 
The author does not record many localities in detail, resting con- 
lent with general indications ; and in a work little likely to be much 
used within the isles, this course was judicious enough.
Equally so 
is the omission of specific characters and descriptions, excepting in 
some few cases where there seemed need for them, as in describing a 
new species, for, of course, like other very local discoverers, our young 
author must find a novelty or two to name and describe.
A moun- 
tain form (usually so deemed) of Plantago maritima is " raised to the 
rank of a species," and the following characters are given to distin- 
guish the new species from the plant of the sea coast : â€” 
P. maritima.
â€” Leaves erect, narrow lanceolate, smooth ; spikes 
cylindrical, 
P. setacea.
â€” Leaves lying flat on the ground, cylindrical or semi- 
cylindrical; spikes globular.
Another "new species" is " Laminaria Cloustonii (Edmons.
MSS.) ;" 
but, while the first to impose the new name upon the plant, our au- 
thor is not here the first to propose the new species.
In alluding to 
the fancy for making or naming new species, sparingly exercised, we 
should also record an instance of personal forbearance under this 
head, shown by Mr. Edmondston, in his retaining as a variety only, 
the plant formerly figured in the ' Phy tologist ' (i.
497), erroneously, 
as the true or typical form of the Linnean Cerastium latifolium ; and 
afterwards distributed as a new species, under the manuscript name 
of C.
nigrescens, Edmonds.
(Phytol.
ii.
96).
Some little uncertainty, 
however, seems even still to attend this plant.
No available distinc- 
tion has been found between the plant of Shetland and the Linnean 
C. latifolium of the Highland mountains ; and yet its peculiarly broad 
and obtuse leaves, deeply tinged with purple, afford a decided first- 
sight or physiognomical difference, which is even more pronounced 
in some examples raised from seeds of it in the neighbourhood of 
London.
Besides this dubious Cerastium, thei'e is only one other 
species peculiar to Shetland, when contrasted against other parts of 
Britain, namely, Arenaria norvegica, Gunn.
â€” an inhabitant of Nor- 
way, as indicated by the specific name.
The geographical notices introductory to the list of plants, and re- 
marks scattered through the list itself, are deserving of attention.
And on the whole, though not free from some of the defects of haste 
and youthful inexperience, the ' Flora of Shetland ' is a creditable 
evidence to the author's ability and industry of research.

Notes on some British Specimens distributed hy the Botanical So- 
ciety of London, in 1846.
By Hewett C.
Watson, Esq.
In the ' Phytologist ' for February of last year, the editor obliged 
me by printing some explanations about certain new or otherwise in- 
teresting British plants, then distributing by the Botanical Society.
Perhaps I may be allowed the same privilege again, as there appears 
no other channel so suitable for recording the information which can- 
not be conveyed by labels.
Unfortunately, there are very few exam- 
ples of the two first species in the following list, so that the plants 
will still remain desiderata with almost all of the members.
1. â€” Vaccinium macrocarpum (Ait.) â€” This elegant plant was dis- 
covered in August last, by Dr. Bidwell, and should it prove to be 
truly a native of Britain, the fact will be important and unexpected in 
geographical Botany.
The locality in which it was found, is that of 
Soughton bog, two miles and a half from Mold, by the road to Flint.
The bog is stated to be of small size, and close to the road.
Dr.
Bid well's inquiries failed to elicit any evidence towards showing that 
the plant had been designedly planted in this station.
Hitherto the 
species has been known as a native only of North America, but it is 
occasionally cultivated in English Gardens, either for its fruit, or as 
an ornament around ponds of water.
In general appearance it resem- 
bles our Vaccinium Oxycoccus, but is a much larger and more showy 
plant.
2. â€” Cerastium strictum (Linn.).
â€” Mr. Andrews discovered this 
plant last autumn, on Great Arran Isle, Galway.
The examples are 
labelled by the discoverer " Cerastium arvense var.
strictum^'' and 
they certainly approach very near to some forms of C.
arvense, with 
which many other good botanists now unite the C.
strictum.
3. â€” Cirsium setosum (Bieb,).
â€” Twenty specimens of this recent ad- 
dition to the Scottish Flora, were obligingly sent for the Society by its 
original discoverer in Britain, Dr. Dewar.
This is one of the inter- 
mediate species which connect the genera Carduus and Serratula.
It 
is nearly allied to Carduus (Cnicus or Cirsium) arvensis.
4. â€” Galium Vaillantii (De C).
â€” The Society is indebted to G.
S. 
Gibson, Esq., the discoverer of this Galium in England, for the speci- 
mens distributed.
Mr. Gibson's experiments in raising this plant 
from seeds, equally as further observation of the wild examples, con- 
firm him in the belief that it is quite distinct from G.
Aparine, of 
which it has been deemed a variety.
It seems, however, that G.
spu- 
rium (said to have been fuuud in Shetland by George Don) must be 
442 
united with G.
Vaillantii.
Steudel adopts the name of G.
agieste 
(Wallr.), for the two united into one species (Phytol.
i. 1123).
5. â€” Luzula congesta (Sm.).
â€” This is a very common plant in Bri- 
tain ; but Mr. Bentall having good grounds for believing that large 
forms of L, campestris are frequently mistaken for it, examples of the 
true congesta, collected by Mr. Bentall, are enclosed in each parcel 
sent out.
The correction of errors, by the distribution of properly 
labelled examples, may be held one of the most useful offices of a 
Botanical Society (see Phytol.
ii.
168).
6. â€” " Hieracium pulmonarium ?
" (Smith's Herb.).
â€” The Hiera- 
cium pulmonarium of Smith, has been a puzzling species to botanists, 
and is yet insufficiently understood.
It has usually been accounted 
a variety of H.
murorum by those who refused to receive it as a true 
species, while in the ' Manual of British Botany,' Babington quotes 
it as synonymous with the H.
diaphanum of Fries, and gives H.
Law- 
soni as a variety of the same species.
The examples now distributed 
are from my own garden.
They are unquestionably the same species 
as those in Smith's herbarium, interrogatively labelled " H.
pulmona- 
rium ?
" To those specimens Smith alludes in the three last lines of 
his account of the species in the 'English Flora ;" but in the herba- 
rium (contrary to the statement in his printed work) they are men- 
tioned to be garden examples.
Curiously enough, however, these 
examples of H.
pulmonarium from my own garden, are certainly de- 
scendants from three roots of H.
nigrescens {JVilld.), which were 
brought from Ben Aulder, in 1841.
Indeed, three or four of the spe- 
cimens actually came from those still living roots, while the others 
were raised from seeds produced on them in 1843 and 1844.
As the 
H. nigrescens is usually deemed a variety of H.
alpinum, while H.
pulmonarium has been often considered a variety of H.
murorum, 
this assertion about their identity will be received with some doubt, 
and reasonably so.
In expectation of this scepticism, I will defer 
further explanations on the subject to a separate paper on these and 
allied species, which I have been carefully watching under cultivation.
Meantime, I would refer to remarks on them already printed in the 
' Phytologist,' from Mr. Babington and myself (see Phytol.
i. 804, 
865, 1139).
7. â€” Q^nanthe phnpinelloides (Linn.), Lac/ietmlii (Gmel.), and 67- 
laifolia (Bieb.).
â€” These plants have been abundantly written about 
in the ' Phytologist' and elsewhere.
They will, as a series, be much 
better illustrated by the specimens now distributing, than was done 
last year.
Those of Lachenalii and silaifolia, collected by the Rev, 
443 
A. Bloxam, are well dried and characteristic examples of the plants, 
including roots, at the stage of flowering.
But the tubers (of Lache- 
palii especially) are so brittle, that many may be broken off before the 
specimens reach the hands of members.
Unfortunately, the roots 
were broken short off in nearly all the specimens sent by Mr. Lees ; 
but as some of them were advanced in fruit, they show one character 
which was wanting in the better-dried specimens from Mr. Bloxam.
For the wild examples of pimpinelloides the Society was indebted 
solely to Mr. Lees.
Though in a sad condition as respects pressure 
and drying, they come very opportunely to be compared with those 
of the other two species.
I added some specimens from my 
garden, in order to show, at the same time, the broad radical leaf of 
the winter season, and the callous base of the fruit at the stage (before 
maturity) where it is most conspicuous.
Taken together, the speci- 
mens in the earlier parcels of this year will sufficiently illustrate all 
three species, but the later sent parcels may probably have less com- 
plete examples.
I will hope that Dr. Bromfield may be induced to 
dry a quantity of pimpinelloides, which is plentiful in the Isle of 
Wight ; because, by so good and careful a botanist, the specimens 
would doubtless be well selected and well dried.
8. â€” Primula vulgaris and its varieties.
â€” These are examples of the 
plants which were recorded in the * Phytologist ' for July last, as 
having been all raised from seeds of one variety of P.
vulgaris.
I dried 
a number of the flowers and leaves, and divided the whole into ten 
sets, calculated to show the range of variation.
Only half-a-dozen 
sets could be spared for the Society, and of course, every variety could 
not be included in any single set.
One pretty complete series has 
been sent to the Society's rooms in Bedford Street.
In connexion 
with these specimens, I would beg to call attention to the necessity 
of preserving examples of the parent plants, as well as of the varieties 
produced, in all cases where similar experiments are made for scien- 
tific purposes.
Inexact expressions, like "seeds of the red cowslip," 
are indifferent substitutes for the physical illustrations placed within 
reach of after examination (Pytol.
ii.
217).
9. â€” The fine series of Irish Saxifrages from Mr. Andrews, will be 
appreciated by the members.
Though the range of variation in the 
leaves of Saxifraga Geum and S.
umbrosa is very wide, the different 
varieties run so insensibly into each other, that it becomes impossible 
to separate them by rigid lines.
Two varieties are distributed under 
the name of S.
Geum, one with the crenatures obtuse, the other 
having them so acute as to be almost dentate in some examples ; yet 
444 
these two forms, so dissimilar at the opposite extremities of their se- 
ries, were scarce distinguishable in some of the intermediate examples.
Indeed, at this time I have a living plant before me, on which both 
the acute and the obtuse crenatures are found very clearly shown on 
different leaves.
It is highly probable that S.
hirsuta (Linn.) must 
be sunk into the grade of a variety ; the Irish species of the section 
remaining only two, Geum and umbrosa, and even these two running 
almost together in hirsuta and elegans.
10.
â€” Glyceria plicata ("Fries") and Glyceria Jluitans (Br.).
â€” Mr.
Moore kindly supplied examples of these two species, lately distin- 
guished as such, from Hampstead.
The G.
plicata is likely to occur 
in many counties, though less common than the G.
fluitans, from 
which it does not appear to have been hitherto distinguished, even as 
a variety, by the botanists of Britain.
They are certainly very similar 
in most respects ; and if I have ever seen G.
plicata in a living state, 
it has been passed by, as only G.
fluitans.
All the specimens in my 
own herbarium belong to the latter species solely.
Unfortunately, 
these grasses were not included in several of the parcels sent out in 
January and February.
Though other interesting species or varieties are to be found among 
the plants distributing this year from the Society, they do not seem to 
call for any particular notice, having been already recorded in the 
' London Catalogue,' or in my former paper on the Society's distribu- 
tion of last year (Phytol.
ii.

February, 1846.
Thoughts on the progressive development of species.
By William 
Wilson, Esq.
In reference to Mr. Watson's remarks on this subject, I think that 
too much has been conceded to the transitionists.
To admit the pos- 
sibility of a variety assuming the essential properties of a central spe- 
cies, or an acquired tendency to perpetuate its own likeness prepon- 
derating over that paternity which would induce it to return to the 
form of the central species, seems to me very like the surrender of two 
important principles, without which the debate cannot be profitably 
carried on.
445 
One of these principles is, that a species must possess certain per- 
maneiit characters by which it may be known : unless this is assumed, 
our idea of a species becomes a mere metaphysical abstraction, having 
no foundation in nature.
The other principle is one laid down by 
Mr. Watson, viz., that the changes effected in plants are simply the 
natural results of certain conditions to which they are subjected: a 
principle which admits, if it does not absolutely require, that when 
the changed plant is no longer exposed to distorting influences, it 
will naturally and immediately begin to revert to the original form.
It seems to be a groundless figment to suppose that the abnormal cha- 
racters of the variety could be perpetuated, apart from those condi- 
tions, on the principle of "like producing like," which has no meaning 
if we do not confine it to some law impressed on organized matter, a 
law which becomes unintelligible or rather nullified by the supposition 
that a new inherent tendency is imparted.
It has indeed yet to be 
proved that a variety does acquire an idiosyncrasy of such a perma- 
nent and independent character that no conditions will alter it.
The 
probability is, that a susceptibility of change must remain in all plants 
which have been once effected by previous influences, greater even 
than what may be supposed to reside in unchanged plants, unless we 
assume that the very same conditions will invariably produce the very 
same results in every individual subjected to their action : a position 
which can scarcely be established from any experiments hitherto 
made.
Mr. Watson says it cannot be disproved that there exist per- 
manent varieties which possess the essential characters of a species.
It is not at all necessary to disprove it ; and is it not enough to show 
its iraprobabihty ?
If we admit the possibihty of such a permanent 
change, we virtually adopt the views of the transitionists, without their 
having brought out anything in the shape of facts to require our 
assent.
I believe it is Spence who remarks that when we say " we are in- 
clined to think so and so," we say much more than we mean â€” are 
more candid than discreet.
The views of the transitionists appear to 
be very much the result of temperament, unless we suppose that they 
have been subjected to certain conditions which have brought them 
into an unhealthy state, unfitting them for making sound conclusions 
firom given premises.
There are varieties oi men as well as oi plants, 
though I never yet heard of human monsters producing their like (a 
race of Calibans) in unchangeable perpetuity ; but with Mr. Watson 
I should be very unwilling to think the advocates for transition so far 
gone in absurdity as to be incapable of hearing reason.
To those 
Vol. II.

446 
who hold that doctrine, 1 wouhl say, that if their views are right, we 
cannot determine what a species is, unless we define it to be a mere 
temporary and transitory modification of matter.
The adoption of 
such a definition may lead to conclusions of a very sceptical charac- 
ter concerning matter, as to its origin and self-motive properties.
It 
is surely the most rational course to assume that an intelligent, crea- 
tive power, in benevolence to rational creatures, would not so consti- 
tute existing races of animals and plants as to elude recognition after 
a certain lapse of time, and thus impress a character of fluctuation 
and uncertainty upon all the works of creation, even upon man himself 
as a species, and by a lamentable consequence, upon his intellect also, 
rendering it (I may say) impossible to know anything, according to 
the doctrine of ancient sceptics, whose tenets seem only to be revived 
in another shape by the transitionists.
Before I close this paper, 1 will add a few remarks on Festuca lo- 
liacea, about which I have formed (perhaps erroneous) conclusions at 
variance with those of Mr. Watson.
Several years ago, I visited a 
meadow on the banks of the Weaver above Northwich, where F.
pra- 
tensis and F.
loliacea were growing together in profusion.
At that 
time I had serious misgivings about their specific diversity, and fully 
expected to find intermediate links connecting the two forms into one 
species.
Since then I have also had similar doubts concerning F.
pratensis and F.
elatior.
This year and last year T have paid parti- 
cular attention to F.
loliacea, growing by itself near my present resi- 
dence, and am led to think that it possesses claims to be considered 
a species.
It flowers later here than F.
pratensis, and I have omitted 
to preserve growing specimens of the latter for comparison.
It is not 
my present intention to contend for F.
loliacea, but only to request 
that further observation and experiment may be employed before the 
question is treated as settled.
With Sir W.
J. Hooker, I am disposed 
to consider F.
pratensis more nearly related to elatior than to loliacea, 
and would direct attention to the long outer valve of the calyx of the 
latter, also to the numerous florets of the spikelet and to the genicu- 
late character of the culm.
Perhaps it might not be quite absurd to 
ask how Lolium pratense is to be permanently distinguished from Fes- 
tuca loliacea if the latter be considered as a mere variety, and I would 
direct attention to the remarks of Sir J.
E. Smith, in 'Eng. Flora,' 
concerning Lolium as a genus.
W. Wilson.
Orford Mount, August 2, 1845.
447 
P.S. â€” The paper now sent has been hitherto kept back, in the hope 
that I should ere this have had an opportunity of reading the work 
referred to by Mr Watson.
My namesake's queries (Phytol.
ii.
377) 
addressed to him on the subject of hybrids, induces me to submit what 
I have written to the readers of the ' Phytologist.' My own impres- 
sion is, that true hybrids are not capable of reproducing their kind.
Professor Henslow has stated that " Koelreuter ascertained that all the 
plants raised between Digitalis purpurea and D.
Thapsi, by fertilizing 
the ovules of either by the pollen of the other, were constantly proli- 
fic ; but then he also ascertained that D.
Thapsi itself, when cultiva- 
ted by him, after five generations assumed all the characters of pur- 
pm'ea.
He consequently rightly inferred that D.
Thapsi was to be 
considered no otherwise than as a Spanish variety of the more com- 
mon form of the species." If other reported examples of fertile 
hybrids were as rigorously scrutinized, I believe that the same result 
would be obtained.
Meanwhile it may be safely assumed, in reply 
to Mr. E.
S. Wilson's queries, that we shall never be able to deter- 
mine what is or is not a hybrid, until we shall have first ascertained 
what is really a species.
In the present state of our knowledge, it ap- 
pears to be the safest rule to pronounce a " fertile hybrid " a variety ; 
and I confess I do not see the utility of such experiments as those in- 
stituted by Mr. Watson and recommended by Mr. E.
S. Wilson, unless 
the permanency of a form under every variety of cultivation be assumed 
as 'prima facie evidence of a species on the one hand; and on the 
other, every deviation from the form of a parent stock, which is con- 
tinued in the progeny of a variety, be considered conclusive evidence 
that the variety is not a hybrid.
What other test can be applied ?

An Outline of the Flora of the Neighbourhood of Godahning, in the 
County of Surrey ; with brief Notices of the Geological Features 
of the District.* By J.
D. Salmon, Esq.
In bringing the Flora of Godalming and its neighbourhood before 
the notice of botanists, it is necessary that the limits of the district 
should be clearly defined, and that the geological features which pre- 
sent themselves should be noticed: for the outline of the latter I have 
availed myself principally of Dr. Mantell's Memoir in the ' History of 
Surrey.' 
* Read before the Botanical Society of London, February 6, 1846.
448 
Extent and Boundary.
â€” The tract of country about to be illus- 
trated is comprised within a square, the sides of which are about eight 
miles in extent, having Godalming for the centre ; every portion of 
the district is therefore within a moderate walk of the town.
The chalk ridge, well known as the Hog's Back, running east and 
west, has been taken in part as the northern boundary ; a narrow slip 
of London clay on the north side of this range, is, however, included 
within the district, as affording an additional variety of soil.
From 
the abrupt termination of the Hog's Back at Guildford, the northern 
boundary is continued along to Merrow Downs: from thence the east- 
ern boundary passes by St. Martha's Chapel, and crossing the valley 
of Chilworth by the powder-mills, it skirts Blackheath to Shumeley 
Green, is continued across the Wey and Arun canal to the junction of 
the Cranley and Horsham turnpike-roads, and follows the latter to 
Pain's Hill.
The southern boundary is taken hence in a westerly direction 
through the wealden clay, immediately at the base of the lofty range 
of hills commencing at Hascomb Beech, and terminating at Bowler 
Green near Hindhead.
From this point the western boundary is 
formed by an imaginary line through Cosford crossing Thursley Com- 
mon to Elstead, and continued thence over Crooksbury and Fatten - 
ham Commons by Hampton Lodge, passing over the Hog's Back near 
Shoeland Farm to the commencement of the northern boundary.
Geological Features of the District.
â€” In noticing these, 1 com- 
mence with the northern limit, which is a termination of the liondon 
clay resting upon the chalk, I am not aware that any portion of the 
plastic clay is to be found within the limits : the Bagshot sand, which 
is so conspicuous, does not approach nearer than Romping Downs, 
about two miles distant.
The principal feature is the beautiful chalk 
ridge called the Hog's Back, which scarcely exceeds half a mile in 
breadth.
" This remarkable ridge of the North Downs extends from 
Guildford to a point about two miles from Farnham, and has evident- 
ly been produced by an upthrow of the chalk, and the breaking off of 
the southern portion of the curve.
The inclined position of the re- 
maining side of the flexure is seen at the western .extremity of a large 
chalk-pit, between Guildford and Puttenham, where the strata dip to- 
wards the north at an angle of about 30Â°.
The upper beds are very 
white, with courses of the usual dark flint nodules ; and a remarkable 
feature in this quarry is the distinctness with which the chalk is 
divided into masses ap])roaching to a rhomboidal figure, by seams 
449 
oblique to the stratification ; the angles of the portion thus formed 
standing out in the face of the cliff, like splinters in the shattered 
fracture of a crystal." 
Descending its southern side we meet with a narrow stratum of fire- 
stone, which " forms a slight projection along the foot of the Hog's 
Back ; the gait, a corresponding depression along its whole length," 
varying in breadth from a few hundred yards to a quarter of a mile, 
towards the eastward, opposite Littleton.
Having passed this tract, 
we approach the principal stratum of the district, which is a portion 
of " one of the most extensive surfaces of the Shanklin sand in Eng- 
land.
This sand rises rapidly in many places to a considerable ele- 
vation: at St. Martha's Chapel it equals or out-tops the chalk, though 
less than a mile from it horizontally." This character extends over a 
great portion of the district, presenting numerous acclivities, the most 
conspicuous of which are St. Martha's Chapel, already mentioned, 
Chinchurst Hill, heights around Godalming, Highdown Heath, Has- 
comb Beech, and the ridge of hills stretching thence by Burgate, 
Hambledon, Barnacle and Wormley towards Hindhead, where an ele- 
vation of upwards of 900 feet above the level of the sea is attained.
The heights in the immediate vicinity of Godalming offer excellent 
sections of the Shanklin sand.
Holloway Hill affords a good exam- 
ple of the strata, which are composed of loose sandy materials, and 
abound in large concretions of chert and of Burgate-stone, "a conglo- 
merate of quartz-grains and pebbles, held together by a strong calca- 
reous cement, which is hard and sparry, and much used for the pur- 
pose of building." 
" The ferruginous concretions termed curstone are abundant on the 
Witley and Thursley Commons, and from being so compact as to ring 
under the hammer, are called clinkers by the quarry men.
This stone 
sometimes occurs in plates or flakes, more than a quarter of an inch in 
thickness, and curved so as to resemble portions of consecutive layers 
of petrified wood." It furnishes an excellent road-material, and gives 
that remarkable reddish hue to those roads which are Macadamized 
with this stone.
Fragments of brown haematite, a kind of iron ore, oc- 
cur in this district.
There were anciently several iron-furnaces, of 
which the only memorials are four large ponds, called the Hammer 
Ponds.
The only remaining portion of the district to be noticed is that 
forming the southern boundary, and which is occupied by the clay 
formation of the northern limit of the thickly wooded weald of Surrey.
450 
The General Aspect of the District.
â€” In many parts it is highly 
diversified with hill and vale.
The town of Godalming stands on the 
high road to Portsmouth, and is pleasantly situated in a beautiful val- 
ley bordered by lofty hills, the sides of which, for the most part, are 
richly clothed with ample foliage, rendering the surrounding scenery 
highly picturesque.
This character extends more or less through the 
adjoining valleys towards Guildford, adding much beauty to the ge- 
neral scenery ; and from the different eminences a series of splendid 
views are to be obtained.
The Hog's Back commands a most exten- 
sive prospect.
The view towards the southward presents a magnifi- 
cent landscape ; in the foreground, the undulating ridges of the vari- 
ous hills, interspersed with beautiful winding valleys, presenting to 
the vision a lovely and rural scene.
Further on, the eye wanders over 
the whole extent of the weald of Sussex, rich in foliage, and only ar- 
rested to the eastward by the bold and mountainous ridge of Leith 
Hill, which rises to an elevation of nearly 1,000 feet above the level 
of the sea.
This splendid panorama is backed by the lofty outline of 
the South Downs, which border the English Channel and extend into 
Hampshire.
From other points the views are equally extensive, pe- 
netrating into the adjoining counties.
The extensive heaths, "though not unpicturesque, are wild and bar- 
ren in their aspect, destitute of wood ; " yet there are several large 
ponds, formed by the embankments across the valleys, the margins of 
which will afford much pleasure and gratification to the ardent bota- 
nist.
" The surface is, in fact, to this hour, nearly such as it may be 
conceived to have been when first uncovered by the departure of the 
sea."' The whole district is intersected with delightful valleys, through 
which run several rivulets, that flow into the Wey from various sour- 
ces, amongst which is one that is almost rendered classical by the de- 
lightful author of Selbome.
This, meeting the Blackdown stream at 
Headley, is joined by the Alton and Farnham branch, at Tilford- 
bridge, where they form a considerable stream.
From this point the 
Wey proceeds in an eastwardly direction by Elstead &c., receiving in 
its course several small streams from the neighbourhood of Thursley 
and Witley, one of which takes its rise in the Devil's Punchbowl, from 
which source flows a delicious stream, as clear as crystal.
The river, 
after passing by Godalming, from whence it is navigable by the addi- 
tion of a canal, runs through a long line of pleasant meadows to 
Guildford, and in its progress receives the tribute of two additional 
streams, the Arun canal and the Tillingbourne, which add much to 
its importance ; it ultimately falls into the Thames near Weybridge.
451 
According to Mr. Stevenson, "the waters of the Wey are of much less 
fertilizing quality than other streams in Surrey.
This is attributed to 
the sandy country through which the Wey flows in the beginning of 
its course, and to the large quantities of sand which, after every heavy 
shower, are washed into the river from the steep hills near Godalming." 
Localities of Plants.
â€” From the diversity of soil included in the 
foregoing sketch, it is evident that many of our rarer plants may be 
expected to be met with.
The Flora of the district will be better elu- 
cidated under the three following divisions.
The first division comprises the chalk and adjoining strata of Lon- 
don clay and gait, forming a large portion of the northern boundary.
This district is rich in Orchidaceaj and other calcareous plants.
The 
extensive quarries at Compton and Wanborough, will afford a rich 
treat to the admirer of this beautiful and interesting tribe of plants.
Orchis pyramidalis, Gymnadenia Conopsea, Listera ovata, Aceras an- 
thropophora and Herminium Monorchis may be found in this locality 
in the greatest profusion ; Ophrys apifera and O.
muscifera more 
sparingly.
The following interesting plants are found in this part of the dis- 
trict.
On the face of the quarries, Arabis hirsuta ; on the sloping 
debris, Reseda lutea, Yiola hirta, Rhamnus catharticus, An thy His 
Vulneraria, Hippocrepis comosa, Onobrychis sativa, Poterium Sangui- 
sorba, Asperula cynanchica, Phyteuma orbiculare, Thesium linophyl- 
lum and Juniperus communis, in abundance.
Gentiana Amarella 
equally so upon the level surface, as is the case with Carduus acaulis 
and Carlina vulgaris ; in the same situation Chlora perfoliata is occa- 
sionally met with.
On the ridge, Taxus baccata is abundant, many 
of the trees denoting a good old age.
Cineraria campestris has been 
found on a down towards the New Inn. Monotropa Hypopitys in 
some seasons is plentiful under the beech trees in a plantation over- 
hanging the Compton quarry ; in other seasons scarcely a plant is to 
be seen.
Upon the lands forming the sloping portions of the Hog's 
Back, the following plants are generally distributed.
Pastinaca sa- 
tiva, Torilis nodosa, Tragopogon pratensis, Picris hieracioides, Cam- 
panula hybrida, Linaria spuria, L.
Elatine and L.
minor, Calamintha 
Acinos, Galeopsis Ladanum and Euphorbia exigua.
Pyrus Aria can- 
not fail to attract attention by the snow-white under surface of the 
leaves, which are rendered very conspicuous by the slightest breeze 
of wind.
Clematis Vitalba trails over all the fences, in which also 
Viburnum Lantana and Ligustrum vulgare form a prominent feature 
452 
upon divers portions of the chalk ridge.
Several interesting plants 
are to be met with in an old discontinued chalk-quarry at the back of 
Losely Park.
In addition to the several species of Orchidaceae before 
enumerated, Scabiosa Columbaria, Helminthia echioides and Campa- 
nula glomerata abound; and in the field adjoining, I have found Pe- 
troselinum segetum.
In the woods at the foot of the chalk, principally 
upon the gait, Silaus pratensis, Senecio tenuifolius.
Primula veris, var.
elaiior, Daphne Laureola and Habenaria bifolia ; and in an arable 
field upon the sand adjoining Veronica Buxbaumii plentifully.
Pri- 
or s wood will afford many an interesting plant, amongst which may 
be noticed Aquilegia vulgaris (sometimes with white flowers), Orobus 
tuberosus and Serratula tinctoria.
The chalk-quarries round Guildford will amply repay investigation, 
and are rich in calcareous plants : in addition to those of the Comp- 
ton and Wanborough stations will be found Cichorium Intybus, grow- 
ing in the greatest profusion near St. Catherine's Hill; Allium vineale 
is located in one spot on the Stoke road ; Chenopodium olidum will 
be found at the foot of an old wall in Quarry-street.
Isatis tinctoria 
grows in the greatest profusion, principally from the fissures on the 
perpendicular face of the chalk in the Shalford quarry ; here also will 
be found Reseda Luteola ; and towards St. Martha's Chapel Brachy- 
podium pinnatum occurs in a disused chalk-pit.
In this neighbourhood Mr. Mill has recorded Fumaria parviflora 
and Bupleurum rotundifolium, (Phytol.
i. 40).
The central or great division is that which is occupied by the cul- 
tivated portions of the Shanklin sand, in which will be found the fol- 
lowing rare or local plants.
Smyrnium Olusatrum, by the side of the 
Shalford road, opposite the park-paling, Dianthus plumarius, in the 
greatest profusion on an old wall in Shalford-street, and on the wall 
of Westbrook Park.
Saponaria officinalis in a hedge-bank near St.
Martha's Chapel.
Corydalis claviculata, sparingly on St. Martha's 
Hill, amongst the trees.
This delicate plant is abundant in a withy- 
bed below Perrydean field (Thorncombe-street), also in a wet coppice 
atHambledon Heath.
Mr. Mill (Phytol.
i. 41) records Listera Nidus- 
avis as growing " in a heathy wood between Guildford and Martha's 
Chapel." Hyoscyamus niger, by the road-side against Stone-bridge 
wharf, by no means a common plant.
Impatiens fulva, by the sides 
of the Tillingbourne at Chilworth, this beautiful exotic is naturalized, 
growing in the greatest profusion, and is equally abundant by the 
sides of the Wey to its junction with the Thames.
The river-sides 
and adjoining meadows offer a rich treat.
The occurrence of Stellaria 
453 
glauca in marshy meadows at the foot of St. Catherine's Hill, of Cus- 
cuta europaea in an osier-holt by the side of the Wey a little above 
Guildford, and of Lepidium sativum and Barbarea praecox, upon the 
banks of the river, have been already recorded by Mr. Mill (Phytol.
i. 
41 and 64).
Nasturtium sylvestre is found by the river-side against 
Unstead-bridge, and in an adjoining meadow Scabiosa succisa, which 
also occurs towards Hurtmore Bottom, and near Mungrove.
Chry- 
sosplenium alternifolium, intermixed with C.
oppositifolium, on a wet 
hedge-bank near the bridge.
There are several other stations for this 
beautiful plant, as the alder-car on Wood Farm, the Withy-beds, in the 
Deanery meadows, &c.
Medicago raaculata grows on the towing- 
path near Catteshall-bridge, a situation in which I am unable to ac- 
count for its appearance.
In the ditches in the common meadows will 
be found CEnanthe crocata, Alisma Plantago, Sagittaria sagittifolia, 
Butomus umbellatus, and several species of Potamogeton, as densus, 
pusillus, pectinatus, gramineus, perfoliatus ; and in that portion known 
as Salgaston, Cardamine amara and Menyanthes trifoliata, which also 
occurs in a meadow higher up the river, and at Bom-moors, Compton.
The boggy parts of Hurtmore Bottom will amply repay the labour of 
investigation.
Here several of the marsh plants will be found, among 
others, Thalictrum flavum, Ribes nigrum, Angelica sylvestris, Samo- 
lus Valerandi, Triglochin palustre, Scirpus sylvaticus, and several 
Carices.
Gagea lutea is recorded in the ' Botanist's Guide ' as grow- 
ing in a " meadow near Godalming." I have not been able to verify 
this information.
The woods surrounding Godalming are rich in botanical rarities.
Euonymus europaeus, Cornus sanguinea, Campanula Trachelium, 
Veronica montana, Lamium Galeobdolon and Ruscus aculeatus are 
common.
Cardamine impatiens is abundant for the first two or three 
years after the clearing of the copsewood.
Turritis glabra is sparingly 
found in the coppices and hedge-rows.
The declivities of the woods 
with south and west aspects afford the rare Carex depauperata; the 
only other station for this plant is Charlton, in Kent.
On Frith Hill, 
Lepidium campestre, Dianthus Armeria, Astragalus glycyphyllos, Se- 
dum Telephium and Marrubium vulgare are plentiful.
In the corn- 
fields at the foot will be found Thlaspi arvense, Sisymbrium Sophia 
and Agrostis Spica-venti.
Upon the tops of the old walls in and about the town several plants 
have established themselves.
Corydalis lutea grows luxuriantly be- 
tween Meadrow and Famcomb, and sparingly in other situations.
Sedum album towards Crown pits, with S.
reflexum, Saxifraga tridac-

tylites, Centranthiis ruber and Hieracinm murornm.
Erigeron acris 
against the Vicarage, also Linaria Cymbalaria ; this beautiful little 
plant is located in many additional situations.
Many interesting plants are distributed over the central portion of 
the district.
Lepidiura Smithii sparingly upon Hascoiub road-side, 
opposite the second mile-stone.
Erysimum cheiranthoides in several 
corn-fields, principally in the direction of Unstead.
Cerastiura aqua- 
ticum in wet situations against Spring Place.
Silene anglica, abun- 
dant in Perrydean-field, Enton fields, &c.
Hypericum montanum and 
Geranium lucidum upon most of the hedge-banks ; the former in great 
abundance in the direction of Crown-pits.
Rhamnus Frangula, Spring 
Place, an alder-car on Hambledon Heath ; abundant in a wood near 
Compton, as stated by Mr. Mill (Phytol.
i. 41).
Potentilla argentea, 
this beautiful ])laut is by no means rare, and will be found upon the 
slopes near Milden's wood, also occupying various other situations on 
the tops of old walls and on hedge-bauks.
A fine tree of Pyrus com- 
munis occui's in a thorny state in a fence upon Hasted Farm.
Pyrus 
Aucuparia is plentiful in the hanging woods at Burgate.
Bryonia di- 
oica, amongst hedges and thickets in several situations.
Dipsacus 
pilosus, sparingly in a lane near Busbridge Park leading from Hollo- 
way-hill, and in a withy-bed towards Milden's Wood.
Lactuca muralis, 
upon the dry walls of Busbridge Park, in the direction of Hambledon.
Gnaphalium sylvaticum (|3.
rectum) has been found very sparingly upon 
the slopes towards Hurtmore ; the same with Iris foetidissima.
Ver- 
bascum Thapsus and nigrum are generally distributed in the different 
lanes.
Antirrhinum Orontium is a common plant in the corn-fields 
at Hide-stile Farm, Enton &c.
Orobanche minor is abundant in most 
of the clover-fields; O.
major, sparingly in a furze-field on Munstead 
Farm.
Verbena officinalis at the foot of a wall against the bridge 
and other similar situations.
Salvia verbenaca is plentifully distribu- 
ted over the slopes near Milden's Wood and St. Catherine's Hill.
Pulmonaria officinalis, B.
angusti folia, occurs by the road-side at Mil- 
ford, in all probality an outcast from the nursery- ground.
Chenopo- 
diura olidum, plentiful at the foot of a wall in Farncomb-street, against 
the chapel.
Polygonum dumetorum appears to be by no means rare 
in coppices and hedge-rows ; it was first noticed in this vicinity by 
my friend Mr. Henry Bull, in an alder-car on Manor Farm.
P. Bis- 
torta is abundant in a coppice at Tewsley, by the path-side.
Orchis 
Morio, heath in Hoe Farm towards Burgate-woods.
Epipactis latifo- 
lia, corn-field next Busbridge Coppice, opposite the pond at Thorn- 
comb-street.
Carex Pseudocyperus in an alder-car on Manor Farm, 
455 
and Barn Moors, Compton.
Melica unitlora is abundant upon most 
of the shady hedge-banks &c.
Viscum album is abundant upon most 
of the tine old whitethorns in Peperharrow Park, and in two instances 
it has established itself upon the Acacia.
Several lime-trees in Lose- 
ley Park present a remarkable appearance from the exuberance of this 
parasite.
The third division comprehends large tracts of barren heath, princi- 
pally occupying the western and south-western portions of the district 
rising in many places into arid elevations, while the plains and hol- 
lows afford boggy ground and extensive ponds.
Many delightiul rambles may be made in these directions.
Witley 
Lagg is rich in bog-plants : â€” here may be found Viola palustris, Dro- 
sera rotundifolia and intermedia, Epilobium angustifolium, towering 
with its beautiful and conspicuous racemes of rose-coloured flowers ; 
the delicate and interesting Campanula hederacea is found intermixed 
with Vaccinium Oxycoccus, Scutellaria minor, Narthecium ossifragum 
and a plentiful supply of Carices.
The numerous morasses on Witley 
Common will offer similar plants, with the addition of Hypericum 
elodes, Radiola millegrana, Peplis Portula, Anagallis tenella and Salix 
fusca.
On the drier and elevated portions Teesdalia nudicaulis and 
Arenaria rubra are plentiful.
Cuscuta Epithymum is frequently to be 
seen in tangled masses, profusely overrunning the Erica?, Ulex nanus, 
&c.
Matricaria Chamomilla is also plentiful, and its perfume is quite 
overpowering on a warm sunny evening; this plant also occurs upon 
Highdown Heath, in the vicinity of Pleck Pond, on the margins of 
which grow Veronica scutellata and Littorella lacustris, â€” the latter in 
abundance.
The moors skirting Witley Common on the north, will 
afford, amongst other good things, Carduus pratensis and Eriophorum 
vaginatum.
Upon the margin of Forked Pond, Typha angustifolia is 
plentiful.
Arnoseris pusilla abounds in a gravelly field behind the 
public house at the Hammer Ponds.
The extensive heaths in the di- 
rection of Thursley cannot fail to attract attention, and will amply 
repay the trouble of investigation.
In the turf-pits will be found Utii- 
cularia minor, Rhynchospora alba, the Eriophori, and a host of bog 
plants.
Elstead and Puttenham Commons are equally prolific.
On 
the latter, at Cut-mill Pond, immediately bordering upon the parish of 
Godalming, the interesting addition of Elatine Hydropiper to the 
southern Flora, has been made by Mr. Walter Reeves, for I have no 
doubt " Cuck mills " is a misprint in the ' Annals and Magazine of 
Natural History' for Cut Mill, as this is within five miles of Farn- 
hani, and I can hear of no such place as Cuck Mills.
This very 
456 
rare plant grows plentifully here, accompanied by E.
hexandra and 
is invariably submerged, whilst the latter not only grows luxuriantly 
under the surface, but extends itself upon the sandy margins that are 
occasionally covered with water.
On the margin of the same pond 
occurs Limosella aquatica, and in a deep morass under the park-pal- 
ing of Hampton Lodge will be found Potentilla Comarum.
Omitting the mention of Phaenogamous plants of a less interesting 
character, I proceed in conclusion to notice the Cryptogamic produc- 
tions of the district.
And from the foregoing description of the geo- 
logical features and general aspect of the country, it may be expected 
that this branch of the subject will prove equally interesting and ex- 
tensive.
With the exception however of the Filices and Pteroides I 
have hitherto been unable to devote the necessary attention to this di- 
vision of the Flora for its satisfactory elucidation.
I hope at some 
future period to be able to supply this desideratum.
The deep rich cuttings and damp woods and shady lanes are par- 
ticularly favourable for the growth of several species of the Filices.
Many of the commoner species grow in the greatest luxuriance, as in 
the case of Polypodium vulgare, which completely covers the tops and 
sides of the hedge-banks, preferring to locate on the decayed stumps 
of trees, and is equally abundant upon the walls at Westbrook &c.
Polystichum lobatum and aculeatum appear to be equally distri- 
buted ; the dingle towards Hurtmore is a favourable station, as is the 
case with Lovers' Lane, Farley Hill.
Lastraea Thelypteris occurs very sparingly at Hurtmore Bottom ; 
hitherto I have only found it with barren fronds.
L. Oreopteris spar- 
ingly upon the extreme end of Witley Common, by the edge of a 
wood towards the Hammer Ponds : this beautiful fern grows in the 
greatest luxuriance in the Devil's Punchbowl at Hindhead.
L. Filix- 
mas is very common in the shady lanes and coppices.
L. dilatata 
{multijlora?
of Newman) grows luxuriantly in most of the wet woods.
At Cosford, Westbrook, &c.
it abounds at the foot of the alder-stumps 
and in other similar situations, whilst Athyrium Filix-fcemina gene- 
rally prefers a more open situation, by the sides of ditches and water- 
courses that are inclosed with underwood.
Aspleniura Trichomanes 
is very common upon the north sides of most of the old walls and 
bridges in the neighbourhood.
On a damp hedge-bank at the back 
of Farley Hill, the fronds attain a great length.
A. Adiantum- nigrum 
abundantly in the same locality, and equally so in several others ; it 
rarely occurs upon any of the walls in this district.
A. Ruta-muraria 
is plentiful upon the garden-wall of Unstead House, and is found more 
457 
sparingly in other situations.
Scolopendrium vulgare will be found 
in the greatest exuberance in the dingle towards Hurtmore, where the 
variety with nuiltifid fronds frequently occurs.
Blechnum boreale is 
a common plant upon the barren heaths, preferring the sides of the 
moist ditches.
Highdown Heath and Witley Common will afford 
this plant in the greatest perfection.
Pteris aquilina is generally dis- 
tributed over all the uncultivated ground.
Osmunda regalis grows 
plentifully by the side of Forked Pond next Thursley Common, and 
sparingly upon Hambledon and Highdown Heaths : but to see it in 
perfection, the admirer of this elegant species must visit the Devil's 
Punchbowl, where the fronds attain a great height, and will convey 
the idea of a truly royal fern.
Cattle do not reject the fronds of this 
species ; those at Forked Ponds are annually eaten off by the stock.
Botrychium Lunaria is evidently a rare species in this neighbourhood.
During the summer of 1840, I found three plants opposite Pleck Pond 
on Highdown Heath, since which I have not seen a single specimen 
growing.
Ophioglossum vulgatum appears to be equally as scarce ; a 
small patch occurs in the Compton chalk-quarries : a closer investi- 
gation on the north side of the Hog's Back will probably yield this 
plant abundantly.
Ceterach officinarum has been found very sparing- 
ly in two situations ; my friend Mr. H.
Bull first noticed it on West- 
brook garden-wall, and a few days subsequently I discovered it on a 
w^all at Catteshall Farm : with the exception of the station at Hasle- 
mere, noticed in Phytol.
i. 1110, no other locality in this county has 
been recorded for this plant.
Lycopodium clavatum is in great plenty on High-down heath, L.
Selago very sparingly in the same locality, L.
inundatum occurs abun- 
dantly in all the wet parts of the different commons.
Equisetum Tel- 
mateia is generally distributed in the wet parts of the hills; it is 
abundant upon the hedge-banks against Busbridge Park, in the 
direction of Tuesley: whilst E.
arvense appears to be more gene- 
rally located higher up in the corn-fields which are inclined to be 
rather springy.
E. palustre, in marshy meadows.
At the back of 
Shalford, this species occurs abundantly in a wet meadow.
E. flu- 
viatile is in most of the ditches, and will be found in the greatest 
perfection at Hurtmore Bottom, where the turf for fuel has been 
dug, also at New Pond, and one of the Hammer Ponds.
E. sylvati- 
cum : this species I noticed for the first time last summer in a wood 
near Burgate, on the weald clay.

Remarks on the Poiato-Mtirrain.
By W.
Wilson, Esq.
The Warrington Natural History Society having engaged ray ser- 
vices in the investigation of this subject, 1 am induced to send you a 
brief statement of the contents of my paper recently delivered to that 
body, so far as the same may be applicable to the present occasion, 
when my juincipal design is to discuss the opinions and statements 
made public by Mr. Stephens, and by tlie Rev. M.
J. Berkeley, whose 
very elaborate essay appears in the ' New Journal of the London Hor- 
ticultural Society.' 
Mr. Berkeley considers the peculiar characteristic of the potato- 
murrain is found in the brown spots of the tuber ; and the foetid, pu- 
trescent state, according to his view, is only the advanced stage of 
the same disease.
My own conclusion is, that these two states have 
no actual connexion, and may be considered as two distinct diseases.
The brown spots are owing to an incrustation of earthy matter, most 
probably silica, since it resists the action of acids, even when the tis- 
sue is incinerated.
The "dry-rot" of Germany in 1830, 1 consider 
to have been an aggravated form of the same disease, and as much 
the opposite of the foetid rot as petrifactioji is the opposite of puire- 
jaclion.
I do not consider it fully proved, as yet, that either of the 
diseases is necessarily connected with the presence of fungi in the 
tuber, though 1 admit the fact, that Botrytis infestans was present in 
those numerous cases which led Mr. Berkeley to state " that in au 
earlier stage of the disease the Botrytis is uniformly produced," and 
that one potato, when divided, produced the fungus from every brown 
speck of the cut surface.
The only fungus that I could find in the 
cellular tissue was Fusarium Solani, and this occurred in one instance 
only, and not much below the cuticle of the tuber.
In all other cases 
the brown specks had nothing but earthy incrustation.
The cells so 
affected were not emptied of their starch granules, as Mr. Stephens 
says, nor could 1 perceive any difference in this respect, except that 
a number of ceils immediately surrounding the brown cells seemed 
to be empty, no starch having been deposited therein during the 
growth of the tuber.
Mr. Berkeley is disposed to support Dr. Morren's opinion that the 
disease is attributable to the action of Botrytis upon the foliage of 
the growing potato-plant.
It is certainly a very remarkable circum- 
stance that the fungus should have infested the leaves so extensively, 
growing out from the interior through the stomata and insinuating 
the raycelia ihroughout the parenchymatous substance, where the 
459 
principal vegetative functions of the potato-plant are carried on.
No 
one who has witnessed this can hesitate to admit that very great de- 
rangement of the functions must arise from such interference on the 
part of the fungus, and the consequence may have been a diseased 
action upon the tubers then in the course of formation.
Mr. Berkeley 
accounts for the presence of the fungus upon the plants while as yet 
in a healthy state.
I quite agree with him in the opinion that " as far 
as the aerial portions of the plant are concerned, the Botrytis is the 
immediate cause of destruction in all those cases where the potato 
herbage was not cut down by unseasonable frost" â€” that the disease 
commences in the leaves, and that the potato-herbage was very gene- 
rally infested with the Botrytis.
I admit also, that " it is not the habit 
of the allied species of fungi to prey on decayed or decaying mat- 
ter, but to produce decay," but I do not admit the conclusion that 
" the plant becomes unliealthy in consequence of the presence of the 
mould which feeds upon its juices and prevents the elaboration of nu- 
tritive sap in the leaves." That an injurious effect does ensue under 
the action of the fungus, I admit, but then 1 consider that a previous- 
ly unhealthy condition of the potato-plant (whether from atmospheric 
causes or otherwise) may be a necessary condition for the establish- 
ment of the parasitic fungus upon the potato-plants.
Until the disease is better defined and ascertained, and its history 
better known in reference to former years, I am induced to consider 
that the atmospheric influences of the past season were quite sufficient 
to produce a diseased state of the potato-plants before the Botrytis 
attacked them.
With Dr. Montagne, I however admit the intimate 
connexion of the disease with parasitic fungi.
Dr. Andrew Ure, in the 'Lancet' for January, has given a very sin- 
gular view of the disease : he says, " This vegetable distemper, like 
that of the cholera, while general in its diffusion, is determined to par- 
ticular localities and plants by certain predisposing causes; yet is 
independent of these, having occurred in many regions where such 
causes did not materially operate.
Whether it will recur no human 
being can predict." Certainly a disease of such a capricious charac- 
ter as this is represented to be, must baffle every attempt at prognos- 
tication.
We are principally concerned at present to ascertain what 
are the predisposing causes.
In this neighbourhood the potato-her- 
bage was certainly killed off by frost, which also destroyed the Dah- 
lias and scorched the Fuchsias of the gardens round Warrington ; but 
T am not by any means disposed to deny that the Botrytis was, until 
then, exerting an injurious action upon the crops.
I believe that the 
460 
very same causes materially operated here as elsewhere in producing 
the brown-spotted and also the foetid disease, and I hope that the 
readers of the ' Phytologist ' will keep a good look-out in the coming 
season for the fungus which is suspected to have been influential in 
some way to the detriment of the crops of the past season.
Dr. Ure, in the same article, has levelled an ill-directed criticism at 
Professor Liebig, overlooking the fact, that Liebig states that not only 
the diseased, but apparently sound potatoes, were found last year to 
contain an unwonted principle, casein, and that in his work on ' Che- 
mistry applied to Agriculture,' casein, whenever present in vegetables, 
is said to be always in a state of extreme wluhility, and therefore 
does not require an alkaline menstruum, such as Dr. Ure employed.
The filtered juice of the potato contains the casein, and on the addi- 
tion of any acid it is precipitated.
As to the protective efiects of sea-air, I would suggest to Mr. Ste- 
phens that the mild temperature of the coast may have operated only 
in preventing the injury from frost.
I do not find that the potato- 
disease was confined to inland situations.
My remarks must close here for the present.
I shall probably re- 
sume the subject in a future number of the 'Phytologist." 
I will just add, since Mr. Stephens has omitted to supply the cor- 
rection, that Dr. Montague's fungus, observed by him only in potatoes 
that had germinated, is named Artotrogus hydnosporus (from a^roj and 
rpccyu).
For the knowledge of this interesting fungus J am indebted 
to the kindness of the JRev. M.
J. Berkeley, whose assistance during 
my inquiries has been of the greatest service to me.

Note on Mimuhis luteus.
By George Lawson, Esq.
In writing the note on the occurrence of Mimulus luteus in Forfar- 
shire, which appeared in the January number of the 'Phytologist' 
(Phytol.
ii.
389), I merely wished to call the attention of botanists to 
the plant, for it seemed to me, that although its claim to rank as Bri- 
tish did not appear to be strong, it at least merited notice from the 
fact that it is really naturalized in this country.
Since the appearance 
of that note several articles on the subject have been published in the 
' Phytologist.' These, however, do not, I think, go to prove that it is 
really a native.
461 
Mr. Townsend remarl^s (Phytol.
ii.
421) that " Loudon gives the 
date of its introduction 1826, ' Bot. Reg.,' 1830." I fear, however, 
there must be some mistake here, for in Loudon's ' Encyclopaedia of 
Plants' the date of its introduction is stated " 1812." I have, how- 
ever, at present in my hands no other authority to refer to.
The date 
of introduction of the plant seems to be of some importance, as on it 
depends, in a degree, the probability of its being considered indige- 
nous.
The Rev. W.
T. Bree states (Phytol.
ii.
421) that he found the 
plant naturalized and thriving robustly near Abergavenny " so long 
ago as the summer of 1824," and Mr. Jackson mentions the circum- 
stance of his father's having found it at the Invergowrie station " more 
than twenty-tvro years ago," adding " I believe it was known to some 
botanists a good many years previous to that date ;" and this former 
statement of Mr. J.
is corroborated by a very intelligent person who 
has long resided near Invergowrie, with whom I was lately conversing 
on the subject.
Now all these dates are prior to 1826, and if the 
plant was not introduced into the gardens until that year, as stated 
by Mr. Townsend, it is clear that it could not be a garden fugitive.
But I am rather inclined to think that the date of introduction given 
in the Encyclopaedia (1812) is correct, the more so, from being cre- 
dibly informed that the plant was known in the gardens in this 
quarter so early as the year 1814.
If it has been really found natural- 
ized previous to the date of its introduction, the circumstance would 
form a strong proof in favour of its being indigenous ; but assuming 
1812 to be the correct date of introduction, I am not aware of any 
report to this effect having yet appeared.
If it can be ascertained 
that the plant has somewhere been found previous to 1812, then the 
probability will be strong that it is a native.
In the meantime, how- 
ever, I think we can only consider it naturalized.

Notice of 'â–  Flora Azorica ; founded upon the Collections and Notes of 
the two Hochsletters.
By Mauritius Seubert, M.D., &c.
Bonn, 1844.' 
A peculiar interest has been given to the Botany of the Atlantic by 
the ingenious hypothesis on ' Endemic Plants ' laid before the last 
meeting of the British Association by Professor Edward Forbes, in 
Vol. II.
3 l 
402 
which he endeavours to account for the present distribution of species 
in Britain, by supposing them to have been originally created at 
widely distant epochs of time, and to have migrated into Britain from 
different and distant centres of creation.
The views of Mr. Forbes 
may be conveniently divided into facts and conjectures.
Firstly, as- 
certained facts respecting the actual present distribution of plants in 
Britain ; secondly, conjectures about the original causes of certain re- 
markable peculiarities in their distribution.
There is originality, 
doubtless, in the conjectures, but so far as the botanical facts are 
given with accuracy, they do not possess that novelty which has been 
claimed for them on behalf of Mr. Forbes.
The basis of this, the 
only substantiated part of this paper, was in print ten years ago.
Our immediate purpose, however, is not to enter upon any critical 
examination of the views propounded by Mr. Forbes, but rather to 
suggest to those who may feel interested in testing their soundness, 
that the work whose title is translated above, is well calculated to be 
of use in their examinations.
The first islands south-west from Bri- 
tain, and almost a central group in the Atlantic, should afford a Flora 
well adapted for trying the soundness of Mr. Forbes's bold conjec- 
tures, as to the geographical centres from which Britain has derived 
its own Flora.
And we may perhaps say with equal propriety, that 
they should also afibrd a test of the supposed different epochs of cre- 
ation, since their geographical position should connect them more 
proximately with the (supposed) oldest Floras, while their apparently 
recent formation, even now only in progress, ought to connect them 
rather with the (supposed) newest Floras.
In this view, the ' Flora 
Azorica' seems particularly worthy the attention of British botanists.
It is a remarkable circumstance that we should have reached near- 
ly to the middle of the nineteenth century, in almost complete igno- 
rance, botanically speaking, of a group of islands which lie so near to 
Europe, with which a considerable trade is carried on from England, 
and which are so frequently touched at by our homeward-bound ves- 
sels.
Some few of the more conspicuous plants were introduced into 
Kew Gardens by Masson, and others were placed in the herbaria of 
Banks and Smith from the same source, though with unpublished 
manuscript names only.
In the year 1838 the islands were partially 
explored by the younger Hochstetter, with his fellow-traveller Guth- 
nick, who visited six of the nine islands.
Six years afterwards.
Dr.
Seubert published the first and only ' Flora Azorica,' being a descrip- 
tive list of the species collected by Hochstetter, with some few addi- 
tions from other sources.
Seubert enumerates nearly four hundred 
463 
species, cellular ami vascular ; a very largo proportion oi" these (more 
than half?) being species identical with those of Britain ; and includ- 
ing amongst them examples of all the (supposed) five distantly cre- 
ated and distantly derived Floras, now differently distributed in 
Britain ; as well as others which cannot be considered belonging to 
any one of the five.
About a hundred and fifty additional species of vascular plants 
have been brought to this country from the Azore islands, since the 
collections of Hochstetter and Guthnick were formed.
A conside- 
rable number of these still remain unrecorded from those islands, ex- 
cept by their labels in herbaria ; but upwards of a hundred of them 
were enumerated in Mr. Hewett Watson's list of his collection, made 
in the same islands, in 1842.
The ' Flora Azorica,' however, remains 
the standard work on Azoric Botany, including the original descrip- 
tions of the new and endemic species, with accurate figures of a score 
of them.
According to the census of Dr. Seubert, among the 400 
species there are fifty which are peculiar to those small islands, only 
twenty-three which are common to those isles with Madeira and Ca- 
nary (one or both) but not known in Europe.
Increased knowledge 
of the Botany of the Azores, with the more complete series of Madei- 
ran plants preserved in English herbaria, now lead to some changes 
in these estimates.
The number of species absolutely limited to the 
Azores is rather less than stated by Seubert, while the number of 
species common to them and Madeira requires to be taken at a higher 
figure.
Speaking in round numbers, we may say that four-fifths of all 
the species now wild in the Azores, are wild also in Europe, from 
which many of them have been doubtless carried to the Azores by the 
early settlers.
Of the remaining one-fifth, nearly the whole number 
are peculiar to the Azores, or to the archipelago of Atlantic Islands, 
which includes also Madeira and the Canaries.
Some have emigrated 
to the Azores from the continents of Africa and America.
Among the few exceptions, one is striking.
The elegant Lycopo- 
dium cernuum, quite a tropical form of its genus, unknown in Madei- 
ra and (as we remember) in the Canaries, reappears in the more 
northern latitude of the Azores, where it grows only by the warm 
springs in St. Michael's.
Here is a fine fact for vestigians and 
geologists, who explain the tropical character of our fossil Flora, in 
boreal latitudes, by a supposed internal heat in the ground dining 
long ante-human eras.
In these same isles the arctic l^ycopodium 
464 
Selago flourishes in the cool climate of the higher mountains, in com- 
pany with Calluna vulgaris and Blechnum boreale.
Notice of the * London Journal of Botany,^ Nos. 44, dated August , 
1845, to No. 50, dialed February 1846, inclusive.
No. 44.
â€” The first article is entitled " Notes of a Botanical visit to 
Madras, Coimbatore and the Neelgherry Mountains," by George 
Gardner.
This embraces Mr. Gardner's personal adventures and re- 
marks, during an excursion from Ceylon to the residence of Dr.
Wight ; interspersed, too, with some valuable observations on the 
structure and technical characters of the plants seen on the journey.
The following passage may have some interest and instruction for our 
younger readers.
About Coimbatore grows the Ficus Benjamina, " very remarkable 
for the profusion of roots which it throws down from its branches.
These, when they reach the ground, become secondary stems, as in 
the true Banyan tree.
Those who wish additional facts to prove that 
the wood of exogenous trees is formed by bud-roots, have only to look 
at one of these trees to be fully convinced of the truth of this beauti- 
ful doctrine.
The main stem of some of them, indeed, I may say all, 
does not form one solid mass, as usually occurs in other trees, but is 
a congeries of thick, branching roots, which come down from the 
lower ends of the large branches, surround the original shoot or stem, 
and overlay each other in such an open reticulated manner, that day- 
light can often be seen through a trunk several feet in diameter." 
The next is an elaborate article upon the Piperaceae of Hooker's 
herbarium, by a learned botanist of Holland, and is entitled, " Ani- 
madversiones in Piperaceas Herbarii Hookeriani ; auctore Dr. F.

" Many

" Botanical Information " succeeds, chiefly concerned with 
the journeys and collectings of Geyer and Gordon, in western Ame-

" Algae 
Novae Zealandiae," by Hooker and Harvey, occupying a considerable 
portion of this number, which concludes with the continuation of Mr.

Here Mr. G.
describes his excur-

Their 
first excursion took them to the highest summit, that of Dodabetta,

of 56** or 57.Â° " On shady banks, and even in open, exposed places, 
the wild strawberry {Fragaria elatior) grows in the greatest profusion, 
from the level of Ootacamund [about 7000 feet], even to the very 
summit of the mountain, in which latter situation I found it, both in 
flower and fruit." At this elevation, while the species are mostly dif- 
ferent, the generic character of the Flora partakes much of the Euro- 
pean.
Omitting the specific names, as unnecessary to the British 
botanist, we find the following genera enumerated : Anemone, Ra- 
nunculus, Dipsacus, Wahlenbergia, Bupleurum, Pimpinella, Vale- 
riana, Senecio, Gnaphalium, Gaultheria, Anaphalis, Cotoneaster, 
Hedyotis, Euonymus, Microtropis, Monocera, Eugenia, Celtis, with 
Prunella vulgaris and Alchemilla Zeylandica ; the latter so like our 
British A.

Amott.

On the occurrence of Ranunculus Lenormandi in Westmoreland.
By C.

In the last number of the ' Phytologist ' (Phytol.
ii.
423) Mr. James 
Backhouse mentioned his having found, near Coniston Water, a 
Ranunculus, which he named R.
hederaceus, &.
grandijlorus, of my 
Manual.
I have recently obtained, through his kindness, a specimen of the 
plant, and have the satisfaction of stating that it is the R.
Lenormandi 
of F.
W. Schultz, which is well figured in the ' Atlas de la Flore des 
Environs de Paris' (tab.
1, f.
3, 4), of Cosson and Germain.
The first 
notice of it as a native of Britain is in the ' Annals of Natural His- 
tory,' xvi.
141.
I have now seen it from Westmoreland, Staffordshire, Leicester- 
shire, and Devonshire, and I believe that Mr. Boner has found it in 
Sussex.
It differs from R.
hederaceus in the form of its carpels : in 
this they are obovale, and tipped with a terminal style ; in R.
hedera- 
ceus they are obtuse, and have a lateral ascending style.
It has also 
much broader and scarcely at all adnate stipules, whilst those in its 
ally are adnate nearly throughout.
This plant will probably prove to 
be common in Britain now that attention has been drawn to it.

Early Flowering of Plants, in 1846.
By Peter Inchbald, Esq.
Among the phajnogamous plants I have noticed in my walks during 
the month of January, there are some few which I think you may con- 
sider worth recording in the pages of the ' Phytologist,' as a proof of 
the mildness of the season.
I have given some attention to Botany 
during several years, but I never remember vegetation to have made 
such rapid advances in January of any former year.
I have gathered 
between thirty and forty flowers in the past month, exotic and native, 
468 
in our immediate neighbourhood.
Among them are Sherardia arven- 
sis, Helleborus viridis, Anemone neraorosa, Draba verna, Potentilla 
fragarioides, Ficana verna, Ruscus aculeatus, Chaerophyllum sylves- 
tre, Daphne Laureola, and Erigeron acre.

The following communications were read : â€” 
1. On the Potato Disease.
By Mr. John Goodsir, Demonstrator of 
Anatomy in the University of Edinburgh.
In reference to the nature of the potato-disease, Mr. Goodsir stated 
that there could be no doubt as to its general resemblance to an epi- 
demic.
Although we may not have discovered the causes of epidemic 
diseases, we know they depend partly on local or individual circum- 
stances which may be obviated, and which influence some epidemics 
more than others ; and partly to general influences, commonly sup- 
posed to be atmospheric, but regarding w^hich we actually know 
nothing but their existence.
Mr. Goodsir then alluded to the striking 
general resemblance between the rise and progress of epidemics, and 
the appearance, non-appearance, and increase of fungi from season to 
season.
Coupling this analogy with the opinion generally gaining 
ground, that certain epidemics owe their existence to the growth of 
fungi or analogous beings in the animals afflicted, Mr Goodsir con- 
ceived that we are bound, in our attempts to explain the nature of the 
potato-disease, not to overlook the fungi which exist in the diseased 
tubers.
After stating Mr. Berkeley's late researches into the fungoid 
nature of the disease, Mr. Goodsir observed, that he was still inclined 
to believe in the organic nature of the brown matter, and he founded 
his belief chiefly on its peculiar form, and on its position in the cells.
This view of the nature of the potato-disease did not afford an indica- 
tion of cure or prevention, for the diseases with the nature of vrhich 
we are best acquainted are not always those we can most certainly 
cure.
It holds out, however, a hope that the muiTain may not recur.
The occurrence of fungi as the cause of disease was pointed out in 
various instances, especially diseases of the skin, where mycodermatous 
fungi are seen, diseases of the mucous membrane, and diseases of the 
stomach.
The occurrence of cellular plants {Torula cerevisia) during 
fermentation, was also alluded to as corroborative of Mr. Goodsir's 
views.
(The paper was illustrated by large drawings of the diseased 
Vol. II.

structure of the potato, of the brown granules, and of Botrytis infes- 
tans, &c.).
Dr. Greville, in making a few observations, commenced by paying 
a high compliment to the talents of Mr. Goodsir, and the general ac- 
curacy of his microscopical researches.
"With reference to that gen- 
tleman's theory," said Dr. Greville, " I see nothing improbable in the 
potato-murrain being analogous to epidemic diseases in the animal 
kingdom.
In fact, the analogies between the two great kingdoms of 
organized matter are so many and so strong, that he might reasonably 
look for much similarity among some of the phenomena exhibited in 
both, with regard to disease.
Like epidemics in the animal world, 
the one under consideration has appeared almost simultaneously in 
various and remote parts of the globe; a fact which seems to indicate 
some atmospheric influence.
The real cause, as in the case of all 
epidemics, is involved in the greatest mystery.
Possibly a union of 
conditions may have taken place, favourable to the development of 
the fungus which appears to be invariably present.
We all know 
that iu the germination of monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous 
seeds, a union of three conditions is essential : the presence of air, 
warmth and moisture.
If any one of these conditions be wanting, the 
seed will not germinate, but, if otherwise favourably circumstanced, 
will remain in a dormant state for an indefinite period.
In like man- 
ner I think it not improbable that certain conditions â€” one or more 
of them being of a meteorological character â€” may have combined in 
the course of the past season to promote the growth of the potato- 
fungus.
The question has been asked.
How do the spores of the 
fungus obtain access to the vegetable tissue ?
This at present is a 
matter of mere speculation.
They are excessively minute ; and it 
has occurred to me, that they, as well as the spores of other of the 
minute fungi, may at all times inhabit the tissue of those species of 
plants to which they are respectively peculiar, without, under ordi- 
nary circumstances, deranging the vegetable functions, in the same 
manner as minute parasites infest different parts of the animal struc- 
ture.
In addition to this, there must be in plants as well as in ani- 
mals, a predisposition to receive the disease j for even epidemics 
make a selection of their victims.
The fungus did not attack all the 
plants of the potato indiscriminately ; some varieties throughout the 
infected districts having, comparatively speaking, escaped : a most 
valuable fact for the consideration of the practical agriculturist.
With 
reference to the brown granules, which Mr. Goodsir believes to be or- 
ganic, I confess I have been quite unable to satisfy myself regarding 
471 
their nature.
Their form is not constant, and under the microscope I 
sometimes find it impossible to distinguish them from the grains of 
starch.
I cannot, besides, detect any determinate arrangement of the 
granules, which the microscopical observer would naturally expect to 
exist in a series of more or less spherical organic bodies.
Certainly 
the brown spots in the tuber require more investigation than they (so 
far as I know) have received.
My attention was directed to the pota- 
to-disease late in the season, and no opportunity was afforded me of 
examining the leaves or the stalks.
It has struck me, however, in 
reading Mr. Berkeley's valuable memoir, that the black spots on the 
stalk, where the cellular tissue is described as filled with a dark, gru- 
mose mass, may correspond with the brown spots in the tuber, the 
cells of which contain the brown, grumose granules, and that the one 
may throw some light on the other.
Mr. Walter Crum, of Glasgow, detailed his experiments on the 
brown colouring matter of diseased potatoes, and stated that it con- 
tained nitrogen, He had carefully examined the brown granules al- 
luded to by Mr. Goodsir, but did believe it was a fungus.
Dr. George Wilson was much interested in what Mr. Goodsir had 
said in reference to the connexion between the disease in the potato 
and the appearance of a fungus, and in the comparison which he had 
drawn between it and a solution of sugar undergoing the vinous fer- 
mentation, in which a cryptogamic plant always showed itself Dr.
Wilson was of opinion, however, that the vegetable physiologist was 
not entitled to refer to the fungus as the cause of fermentation, or to 
speak of it as more than an accompaniment.
On the other hand, he 
was free to acknowledge, that as the chemist could not point to a sin- 
gle example of the vinous fermentation having been observed without 
the saccharrmyces being seen also, he was not at liberty to explain 
the fermentation without reference to the fungus, as he generally did.
Dr. Wilson believed that fermentation was at present an Oregon ter- 
ritory in science, which the chemist and physiologist must, in the 
meanwhile, agree to hold in joint occupancy till it could be settled 
which had the best right to it, or on what terms it should be divided.
Mr. Goodsir had not done himself the justice to mention, that in a 
remarkable case of disease in the human subject, in which the con- 
tents of the stomach underwent a change exceedingly like that which 
vegetable juices suffer when the lactic or viscous fermentation is going 
on in them, he predicted the great likelihood of a cryptogamic plant 
being found, and discovered a very curious one â€” the Sarcinula ven- 
triculi.
Dr. W.
would suggest to microscopic observers, that it was 
472 
possible each of the true fermentations might have an Alga peculiar to 
itself, and that it was well worth their attention to investigate the sub- 
ject.
Sugar could be fermented into alcohol and carbonic acid â€” 
into lactic acid â€” or into mannite and mucilage.
It was desirable to 
know if a new Alga appeared when the fermentation changed its cha- 
racter.
Dr. W.
anticipated that no cryptogamic plant would be 
found when diluted alcohol was converted into acetic acid bj platina 
black, because no azotized compound was present to yield nitrogen 
to the fungus, without which, in all probability, it could not be deve- 
loped.
The acetous fermentation, however, differed in several impor- 
tant particulars from the others referred to.
Dr. Douglas Maclagan entertained no doubt from the observations 
of Mr. Goodsir, Mr. Berkeley, and others, that the fungus present in 
the diseased potato had originated in the leaves, and been propagated 
down along the stem to the tubers.
He had himself observed, and 
rudely sketched, an organism in the diseased tubers, which, from the 
drawings exhibited this evening, he had no doubt was identical with 
that observed by Mr. Berkeley growing from the stomata of the leaves.
There was also, he thought, little doubt as to the nature of the brown 
matter which pervaded the diseased portions.
Although it had not 
been demonstrated microscopically to be a fungus, the fact of its hav- 
ing been separated by M.
Payen, by maceration, and subsequent boil- 
ing with diluted sulphuric acid, and its being ascertained to contain 
a proportion of azote equal to that found in analogous parasitical ve- 
getable organisms, appeared to warrant the conclusion that it really 
was of the nature of a fungus.
Dr. Maclagan thought, however, that 
the question as to the nature of the potato-disease was not settled by 
proving the presence of a fungus in the altered portions.
It was still 
a disputable point, whether the fungus was antecedent to, or conse- 
quent upon, the morbid state of the tubers ; it was yet doubtful, whe- 
ther the discrimination of the first advances towards the disease fell 
within the province of the chemist or the botanist.
He had frequent- 
ly observed, on making sections of affected potatoes, portions in the 
interior of the tubers in which no discolouration had commenced, but 
which were in a softened, pulpy condition.
A portion of this could 
at once be lifted out on the point of a knife, and on being subjected 
to microscopic examination, no fungus or brown granular matter could 
be observed; but the amyliferous cells of the tuber, and these contain- 
ed starch grains, were found in a swollen state, as if they had been 
filled with fluid by endosmose, and the compartments of the cellular 
tissue had thus become so entirely detached from each other, as to 
473 
have assumed a complete round form, instead of their characteristic 
hexagonal shape.
It appeared to him to resemble what might be ex- 
pected from the maceration of the textures in water, and it was a pos- 
sible supposition that this might be the first stage of the disease, and 
that the change thus effected in the tuber formed a nidus fitted for the 
development and growth of the fungus already existing in the aerial 
parts of the plant.
Mr. Milne being invited by the President to give his opinion, stated 
the gratification with which he had listened to the statements made 
by Mr. Goodsir and other speakers.
Nothing could be more distinct 
than the description given of the nature of the fungus which appeared 
to accompany the disease, and the parts of the potato affected by it.
The discussion, however, had been confined entirely to a description 
of the fungus, and to speculations on its probable effect in altering 
the condition of the potato.
No one had, as yet, offered any opinion 
as to the circumstances which led to the production of the fungus.
If it arose from seeds dormant in the potato, what was it which had 
caused them to germinate .?
If it arose from seed or matter in the at- 
mosphere, was there anything in the state of the atmosphere to account 
for it in one part of the globe and not another ?
He had been devot- 
ing attention to the meteorological branch of the inquiry, and he 
thought that he had made a discovery which would explain the ap- 
pearance of the disease in some places and not in others.
But he had 
not come prepared to enter into particulars, not supposing that any 
persons, unless they were members of this Society, could take part 
iti the proceedings; he would therefore indicate generally the results.
Mr. Milne then described some peculiarities of the weather in Eng- 
land and Scotland during the summer and autumn of last year, as 
shown by meteorological returns which he had obtained from a num- 
ber of places, both in those districts where the disease prevailed, and 
in those from which it had been absent.
He mentioned that the 
maximum summer heat had occurred in England and southern parts 
of Scotland in June, whereas in the northern parts of Scotland, where 
the potato-disease had not appeared, the maximum heat had occurred 
in August, as usual.
He alluded also to repeated and sudden ther- 
mometric changes which had occurred in the south of England.
Mr. Brand and Mr. Girdwood remarked, that potatoes in the early 
part of the season were not affected, and that where the stems and 
leaves had been cut away early, the disease had not appeared in the 
tubers left in the ground.
These facts seem to indicate some atmo- 
spheric influences which had come into operation late in the season, 
474 
or some cause which did not take effect till the tubers were fully de- 
veloped.

Notice of ' Flora Calpensis.' By E.
F. Kelaakt, M.D., F.L.S., &c., 
Army Medical Staff.
London : John Van Voorst, 1846.
In the present day, when the advocates of fact and fiction are so 
nearly balanced, we hail this little work, in which facts only are de- 
tailed, as a valuable boon to the former.
The ' Phytologist ' may, 
with honest pride, claim the leadership of the fact party, and therefore 
must regard with approbation every attempt to add to the general 
store of knowledge.
The celebrated remai'k of Savigny, that " Ento- 
mologists multiply observations to admiration but dispense with all 
attempts to generalize them," may perhaps equally apply to many 
botanists; but if so, it is far more creditable than the opposite extreme 
into which a few of our (self-styled) 'philosophical botanists' have 
certainly fallen, that of generalizing without a prior knowledge of facts.
It was aptly said by Newton that " whatever is not deduced from facts 
must be regarded as hypothesis," but hypothesis appears to us a title 
too honourable for the crude guessings to which we allude.
Such 
guessings we hold to be highly derogatory to the dignity of our sci- 
ence, and its great opprobrium as regards this country.
Dr. Kelaart's 
work comes opportunely : it is full of information for the labourers in 
geographical Botany, while its unvarnished facts must of necessity 
militate against the wild speculations now rife on the same subject.
We know of no spot not absolutely an island more completely cir- 
cumscribed geographically and politically than the Rock of Gibraltar.
Seen from the beautiful bay which bears its name, the Rock, rising 
abruptly from the ocean, appears to be completely insulated, since the 
narrow sandy level which connects it with the main land of Spain is 
lost to sight and merges in the bright blue sea.
The whole surface 
is irregular and rugged, and rises to a height of 1439 feet above the 
level of the sea.
The entire area is estimated at two hundred acres, 
and of this about forty acres are cultivated as gardens and parterres.
475 
The remainder, with the exception of that part occupied by the fortifi- 
cations, is as nearly as possible in a state of nature.
Although the dis- 
tant appearance of the Rock would lead one to suppose its precipitous 
sides totally devoid of vegetation, this is by no means the case : "even 
as early as December the colour of the Rock is varied by luxuriant 
vegetation, though of a diminutive description, which changes with 
magical rapidity its summer dress and arid appearance immediately 
after the first falls of rain ; masses of green of every tint, harmonizing 
beautifully with the yellow bloom of the Spartium and Genista and 
the fi-agile umbels of Oxalis cernua, which grows here almost wild.
The whole appearance of the Rock, near the Alameda, is charming, 
and one who has not seen tropical vegetation would scarcely believe 
that at such a season Nature could look so beautiful." 
In speaking of the Chamaerops humilis, a palm very generally dis- 
tributed over the Rock, our author indulges in a little zoological di- 
gression which is highly interesting.
" Its tender leaves " says Dr.
Kelaart, " and young roots constitute the principal food of the apes, 
which abound in this part of the Rock.
The origin of this, the only 
quadrumanous animal in Europe, has been naturally the subject of 
many speculative opinions, and I regret to say that I cannot throw 
any new light on its history ; but I am disposed to side with the opi- 
nion, that these apes were introduced into Gibraltar by the Moors, 
during their early possession of the Rock ; for even in the present 
day similar apes are brought over from Barbary and sold in the mar- 
ket.
Abyla, the hill on the opposite coast of Africa, is still called 
Ape's Hill, from the number of those animals seen there.
The sta- 
tionary habits of this animal on the Rock give additional interest to 
its history.
There is no obvious reason why some of the apes should 
not have migrated to the neighbouring hills.
The Queen of Spain's 
Chair, which is only three miles from Gibraltar, might afford them 
some diversity ; but no, â€” they seem to prefer looking on their father- 
land from the heights of Gibraltar, and feeding upon the palms which 
grow there, rather than travel to the fruitful valleys of Andalusia.
They are never likely to be exterminated from the Rock, no person 
being allowed to shoot, or in anywise hurt them, unless they venture 
near the town, which they seldom do.
Some years ago, one used to 
come down on the declivities above the Alameda pretty regularly, 
during the time the guards trooped, and it consequently went by the 
name of the ' Town Major.' The curious history of another of these 
apes is given by an 'Old Inhabitant,' in his very interesting ' Guide to 
Gibraltar;' who also very properly remarks, "where they bury their 
476 
dead it is impossible to say," for no one has as yet found the carcass 
of any on the Rock.
Some think the lowermost caves their mauso- 
leum, whilst others go even further in their surmise, and suppose that 
they carry their dead into Africa, through a subterranean passage 
under the waters of the Mediterranean." Returning to Botany we find 
that the proportion of flowering plants to feras is greatly in favour of 
the former, the number of species being 446 flowering plants and 10 
ferns, or nearly 45 to 1.
Of the ten ferns enumerated, seven only 
were found by our author : of the remaining three, Davallia Canari- 
ensis is abundant on the oak-trees at Cork-wood, in the neighbour- 
hood of Gibraltar, and perhaps this is really the habitat indicated by 
authors as ' Gibraltar :' Nothochlaena lanuginosa is given on the au- 
thority of Edmund Boissier ; and Asplenium Adiantum-nigrum on 
that of Dr. Lemann.
The seven ferns found by Dr. Kelaart during 
two years energetic search, are, Cheilanthes odora, Gymnogramraa 
leptophylla, Notolepeum Ceterach, Phyllitis Hemionitis, Adiantum 
Capillus-Veneris, Asplenium Trichomanes and Polypodium vulgare.
If we take Dr. Kelaart's oÂ«vn researches as the guide, the ratio will be 
64 to 1.
In Britain, Mr. Watson supposes the number of truly indigenous 
flowering plants to be 1200 (see Phytol.
i. 358), exclusive of the va- 
rieties which are made into species by recent authors.
Mr. Newman 
has clearly shown that we have 40 distinct species of ferns, exclusive 
of Cystopteris regia, C.
dentata, C.
alpina, Aspidium lobatum, Sm.^ 
A. irriguum, Sm., A.

The authors who increase the number of flower- 
ing plants would probably increase that of ferns in the same ratio, so 
that take whose estimate we may, the proportion will be the same, 30 
to 1.
In Iceland the ratio is 25 to 1.
In Belgium it is no less than 
67 to 1.
Hence it would appear that the Flora of Gibraltar, notwith- 
standing the apparent favourable site for the higher ratio of ferns, re- 
cedes to the low ratio of a completely inland country.
The entire 
absence of the genera Lastraea, Polystichum and Cystopteris is worthy 
of notice.
Of the 456 species which Dr. Kelaart reckons truly indigenous to 
the Rock, 40 are generally distributed throughout Europe, 58 are na- 
tives of the south of Europe only, 63 are common to Europe gene- 
rally and Africa, 174 to the south of Europe and Africa, 13 are con- 
fined to Spain and Barbary, QQ are common to Europe, Asia Minor 
and the north of Africa, and 12 are confined to Europe and Asia 
Minor.
It should also be added that no less than 140 of the species 
477 
also occur in Britain, 170 in Madeira, as many in the Canary Isles, 73 
in the Azores, 160 in Sicily, and more than 300 in Malta, one only, 
Iberis Gibraltarica, is peculiar to the Rock of Gibraltar.
Besides these.
Dr. Kelaart has, and we think unadvisedly, included 
44 species notoriously cultivated or introduced ; such, for instance, 
as the Asiatic genus Citrus, four species of which appear in the list, 
Melia Azederach, the Cape Oxalis cernua, the Chinese Eriobotrya 
japonica, the American Cactus opuntia and Magnolia grandiflora, &c., 
&c.
It is true that an acknowledgment accompanies each name, that 
the plant is found only in cultivation, but then they have no more 
claim to a place in the list than the ornamental shrubs and flowers 
introduced so abundantly in our English gardens, to a place in the 
British Flora.
It is diflicult to say on what principle Dr. Kelaart has 
made his selection, since the plants he has thus introduced consti- 
tute but a small part of those to be found in the elegant gardens of 
Gibraltar.
The relative number of species in the different orders is scarcely 
such as we should have expected to find.
There are 60 LeguminosaB, 
or nearly a seventh part of the entire phaenogamous Flora, and only 
1 Saxifrage : there are 56 Composita?, or an eighth of the entire Flora 
and only 25 grasses.
The number of Cruciferae is 17, of Caryophylleae 
19 and of Umbelliferse 28.
In conclusion, we cannot but consider this unpretending hrochure 
a valuable addition to our knowledge of the geographical distribution 
of plants.

â€” The contents are, " Botanical Information," "Remarks 
on some rare Mosses of the southern Hemisphere," by W.
Wilson, 
Esq., "Contributions to the Botany of South America," by John 
Miers, Esq., continued from the former volume.
There is little of in- 
terest to the exclusively British botanist in the present number.
The 
" Information " consists of the south African tour of C.
L. Zeyher, and 
a letter from Mr. Richard Spruce, describing his doings in the Pyre- 
nees.
Though not botanical, the following passage from Zeyher's 
Vol. II.
3 n 
478 
notes appears best worthy of extract : " We arrived towards evening, 
at the side of a range of hills, called ' Zuureberg.' * * The 
name indicates the acid or sour quality of its pasturage, and was given 
by the farmers.
It is a curious fact, that the sourness of a pasture is 
always indicated by the cattle chewing bones, which they never do 
when the grasses are quite sweet ; they know by instinct, what remedy 
to take for neutralizing the acidity in their stomachs.
It was very in- 
teresting sometimes, to see our oxen chasing each other to get hold 
of a bone out of the mouth of another.
The farmers believe, from ig- 
norance of the true state of things, that the cattle use these bones to 
sharpen their teeth, and generally affirm that the teeth of cattle be- 
come sensible and painful from the sour nature of their food, while 
the fact is, they chew and swallow the bones as a cure for the internal 
acidity, which would not be a remedy against the painful sensation 
of the teeth." 
The writer does not mention any of the sour plants which are thus 
supposed to make the oxen of Africa emulate the paupers of Andover 
by becoming " gnawers of bones." How is it with the English cattle 
when turned into pasturage abounding with Rumex Acetosa or ace- 
tosella ?
Mr. Spruce intimates that he has been highly successful in collect- 
ing mosses, notwithstanding the unfavourable reports about the Pyre- 
nean mosses given by other botanists.
His letter bears the date of 
January 6th, and it would seem that he designs to prolong his sojourn 
in the Pyrenees to another season.

The ' Phytologist ' has long been in arrears with its notices of the 
botanical papers in the ' Annals,' through necessarily giving priority to 
those contributions on British Botany which have been sent to us in 
the form of original articles.
The papers in the ' Annals ' may be 
thrown into two principle categories, â€” first, the original articles, re- 
lating chiefly to British plants â€” secondly, the articles translated from 
foreign publications, many of which are valuable contributions to 
physiological or geographical Botany.

Fossil Woods, which tend to elucidate the structure of certain tissues 
in the recent plant," from a paper communicated to the Linnean So- 
ciety.

"On the tendrils of the Cucurbitacese," by M.
J. 
Payer (also from the 'Annales,' same number).
Among these papers we give the preference to that of Barneoud, 
not only as a valuable contribution to structural Botany, but also from 
its bearing upon taxonomy.
Of late years, unfortunately, there has 
been an increasing tendency to impose unnecessary difficulties in the 
way of the student who seeks to acquire a knowledge of plants as in- 
dividual objects.
This is always the starting point of human know- 
ledge.
The first words spoken by a child, with any appreciation of 
their meaning, are nouns or names of individual objects around him, 
whether of persons or things.
The beginning of Botany, in like man- 
ner, is to know plants by sight, and to know one kind from another.
Doubtless this is an unreasoning kind of knowledge ; but every bo- 
tanist feels it to be pleasurable in its kind, and it is a needful prelimi- 
nary to any subsequent process of reasoning in Botany.
It is highly 
desirable that the acquisition of such knowledge should be rendered 
as easy as possible, without the sacrifice of clearness and precision.
This is, however, rendered difficult, not easy, when the distinctive 
characters of plants are drawn from minute parts.
And great confu- 
sion of ideas can hardly fail to result, when genera and species, which 
are closely alike in all the more obvious characters, are widely sepa- 
rated in our systems, through strictly following some one or two almost 
invisible and arbitrarily selected characters.
The example which is brought prominently forward in the remarks 
of Barneoud, will be much less familiar, and therefore less apparent 
to British botanists, than one taken from our own Flora ; and we will 
venture upon a few lines of digression, by making some of our own 
species of Scirpus [Linn.), into precursory examples, before quoting 
the remarks on Schyzopetalon.
Every student of British Botany 
480 
must be aware of the close similarity between Scirpus palustris, multi- 
caulis, pauciflorus, caespitosa and acicularis.
There is also a strong 
general similarity between Scirpus maritimus, sylvaticus, triqueter 
and lacustris, which resemble each other much more than they resem- 
ble any of the first-mentioned five species.
Nevertheless, in Smith's 
'English Flora' we find the four last united with two of the others (pau- 
ciflorus and ca3spitosus) into one genus, Scirpus, the remaining three 
retaining the generic name Eleocharis, under which Hooker includes 
all the five.
This disjunction of species closely alike one another, and 
conjunction of two of them with species to which they have much 
less resemblance, arises from strict adherence to a singly selected 
character, namely, the base of the style being slender or dilated.
The sectional or the generic characters among the Cruciferse, Um- 
bellifera?, Composite and other orders, are too frequently founded 
upon minute characters, difiicult to observe, and leading, after all, to 
disjunction of resembling plants, and conjunction of those which are 
less similar.
This is strikingly shown in the small group of Schizo- 
petaleae.
" Nature " says Barneoud, alluding to A.
P. De CandoUe's 
embryonal classification of the Cruciferae, " appears to have created 
the group of the Schizopetaleae to prove how little stable are frequent- 
1}^ the majority of those sections or subdivisions of family which are 
not founded upon a totality of characters of aflinity, as the true natu- 
ral method requires.
In the herbarium from Chili we find six species 
of Schizopetalon, of which five are new.
If we study these plants 
with care before dissecting the seed, we are led to arrange them all in 
the same genus ; all have a perfect similitude in the various organs of 
the flower, the same aspect, and nearly the same habit ; in a word, we 
find an almost uniform plan of generic structure.
The anatomy of 
the seed then demonstrates a considerable diff'erence between several 
of the species.
We find on the one hand, verj^ minute globular seeds 
presenting an embryo with four linear and spiral cotyledons, with 
curved radicle, evidently belonging to the Spirolobeae of De Can- 
dolle ; and on the other, oval seeds, larger than the preceding, their 
embryo with two incumbent, spathulate cotyledons, and with an al- 
most straight dorsal radicle, evidently belonging to the section Noto- 
rhizeae.
This is the most striking character of the new genus Perrey- 
mondia.
Now it is quite plain that it is impossible to separate, 
without violating the laws of natural affinity, in the methodical dis- 
tribution of the Cruciferous plants, these two genera (Schizopetalon 
and Perreymondia), so nearly related, and solely distinct as respects 
the embryo, as it would be necessary to do according to the classifi- 
481 
cation of De Candolle." Thus we see, that the minute and difficult 
character has not even the advantage of exactness or natural-wess to 
compensate for the difficulties which it puts in the track of the stu- 
dent, â€” and all botanists are students to the end of their lives : no one 
learns all plants.
Put down Mr. Babington on the shores of the Falk- 
land Islands, and Dr. Hooker on the coasts of Britain, each would be 
sadly at fault, but change their positions, and they find themselves 
among their familiar acquaintances in plants.
In the paper on Cuscuta, more interesting to the observers of Bri- 
tish plants, Mr. Babington describes three species, all of which might 
likely have been " lumped " under the one name of C.
Epithy- 
mum by less close observers of Nature, and two of them, indeed, 
certainly have been so.
First, we have the common C.
Epithymum 
of our heaths, reduced in its comprehensiveness.
Secondly, C.
Tri- 
folii {Bab.), a species carved out of the former, and on fair enough 
characters, provided they prove constant when examined by persons 
less inclined to subdivide.
Thirdly, C.
appro ximata {Bab.), said to 
have been imported from the East Indies with seeds of Melilotus offi- 
cinalis ; and this has still clearer characters for distinction.
The 
paper is illustrated by figures, which greatly assist in explaining the 
differences of these three species.
Their assigned characters run 
thus : â€” 
1. â€” C.
Epithymum (Murr.).
Clusters of flowers bracteated, sessile, 
calyx campanulate, shorter than the tube of the corolla ; its 
segments ovate, corona appressed ; its lobes (scales) subequal 
to the cylindrical tube of the corolla, rounded at the apex, fim- 
briated, convergent approximate at the base ; stigmas filiform.
2. â€” C.
Trifolii (Bab.).
Clusters of flowers bracteated sessile ; ca- 
lyx infundibuliform, subequal to the tube of the corolla, its 
segments lanceolate ; interstices of the corona saccate, its lobes 
half the size of the tube of the infundibuliform coroZ/a, rounded 
at the apex, fimbriated, convergent, distant at the base ; stig- 
mas filiform.
3. â€” C.
approximata (Bab.).
Clusters of flowers bracteated sessile, 
calyx campanulate fleshy, somewhat shorter than the tube of 
the corolla, its segments broad, truncate and apiculate or rhom- 
boidal ; corona appressed, its lobes broad appressed, slightly 
shorter than the cylindrical tube of the corolla, bifid, with di- 
vergent segments, fimbriate at the apex, approximate at the 
base ; stigmas filiform.
The object of Mr. Nourse's paper, is that of pointing out those 
482 
" mechanical or structural " conditions on which the colours of leaves 
and petals are in part dependent.
These are, he writes, " 1st, the 
situation of the coloured cells ; 2nd, their size, form and number; 3rd, 
their intermixture with each other, and 4th, their degree of visibility.
He distinguished the parts of a leaf or petal into three, namely, " the 
substance^ consisting of cellular tissue and venous ramifications, the 
cuticle, or epidermis, and a layer of cells immediately beneath the cu- 
ticle, to which we may give the provisional name of retey Mr.
Nourse states that " the situation of the coloured cells is different in 
leaves and petals, though their general structure is anatomically simi- 
lar," He adds that in petals the rate " contains the entire colouring; 
the yellow, red, blue, brown, black, and all the intermediate tints are 
wholly produced in its cells, and can be completely removed by sim- 
ply stripping it off with the cuticle." He also considers that "in leaves 
the rete is the seat of all the modifications of the green colour which 
those organs present, excepting variegation, cuticular changes, and 
what may be called vinous colours, like red cabbage, &c." But he 
says that the green colour of leaves is itself in the substance of the 
leaf, while in petals the substance is " either white or lightish, or some 
faint shade of the general colour of the flower." We suspect â€” nay, 
we are assured by individual observation â€” that there is some error 
in the observations of Mr. Nourse, or, rather, he may have observed 
correctly, and yet may have compared incorrectly.
It would lead us 
into an incompatible length of detail, were we to go fully into this 
question ; but a single fact will probably suffice as a hint to Mr.
Nourse himself.
There is a pretty dwarf tulip often brought into 
London in flower-pots, between Christmas and spring, and familiarly 
known to gardeners under the name of the ' Duke Van Thol.' Its 
colour is orange-red, with a bright yellow margin.
If Mr. Nourse 
will strip off the cuticle from both sides of a petal, he will remove the 
whole of the red colour, through the adhesion of the rete to the cuti- 
cle.
The whole substance of the leaf will then be found of a bright 
yellow colour, similar to the yellow margins of the entire petal.
It is 
true the colour of the margin of the entire petal is somewhat brighter, 
but this appears to be only because part of the yellow colouring mat- 
ter of the margin is situate in the rete, and the greater thickness of 
colour (in the rete and substance together) is seen through a transpa- 
rent and shining membrane, namely, the cuticle.
We may safely as- 
sert, with this easily-reached fact before us, that the general law of 
position of colour is the same for leaves and petals.
Doubtless there 
are flowers in which the interior substance of the petals is pale, but 
483 
these are not to be selected for comparison with leaves, independently 
of those other flowers in which the substance is richly coloured.

Writing here from 
recollection, we do not quite agree with the description and explana- 
tion put forward by the learned Professor ; but the difference of view 
is not greatly important, and may wait renewed examination of the 
plant.
Dr. Allman's report of the fact runs thus : " The three exter- 
nal verticils of the flowers were normal, but between the stamens and 
pistils there was developed a series of adventitious carpels, crowded 
upon the margin of a cup-like production which surrounds the lower 
half of the pistil.
These adventitious carpels were characterized by 
their backs being turned towards the axis of the flower.
The carpels 
bear ovules on their margins, which acquired a considerable degree 
of development, becoming completely anatropous, like those in the 
normal ovary." 
The longest report is devoted to Mr. Forbes' communication "On 
the Endemic distribution of Plants." There is a good share of clever 
ingenuity manifested in the geologic hypothesis of the learned botanist 
of King's College, and as it is made to appear based upon botanical 
facts, it will doubtless be received by those who are slenderly ac- 
quainted with the actual present distribution of plants, and who are 
484 
unprepared to separate what is true and borrowed from what is origi- 
nal and imaginary, in the botanical foundation of the paper.
For our 
own individual part, we must confess a great distaste for ad captan-

We can find nothing for extract.
" What is new is not true : what

Still, unsound as we

nated from an intellect of mediocre character.
Regarded as a fig- 
ment of the imagination, it is ingenious â€” as a contribution to science 
it is only vicious.

H. B.
It is a rather remarkable circumstance that the two forms or species 
of Glyceria should never have been distinguished, even as varieties, 
by the botanists of England, who have latterly become so alert in 
finding and recording varieties and describing them for species.
Closely alike as these plants are in general habit and the more obvious 
characters, they certainly offer quite as clear peculiarities for specific 
distinction as may be found in many other couples of closely allied 
435 
species, received as such.
It has been said that discoveries of new 
])lants are matters of chance, and they are so in a certain light.
But 
to see that one thing differs from another, and to know that it is 
something new, are not matters of chance only.
It requires good ob- 
servation, and the previous possession of knowledge, to profit by a 
chance, and we therefore give credit to Mr. Moore for his discovery, 
postponing our decision upon the validity of the species for a more 
extended examination of their characters in the living plants.
The 
more branched panicle of G.
plicata, with its shorter outer palea, dis- 
tinctly divided into three teeth at the tip, are sufficiently obvious dis- 
tinctions from G.
fluitans, in the dried examples distributed by Mr.
Moore.
Other differences are pointed out by Mr. Moore and Mr.
Babington, though these are less obvious in the specimens.
The "J.
H. B." subscribed to the obituary-notice of the late Dr.
Graham, doubtless indicates his successor in the chair, himself gifted 
with much the same popular qualities by which Dr. Graham was ho- 
nourably and amiably distinguished; and, we may add, with a far bet- 
ter general knowledge of Botany to start from.
The botanical ap- 
pointments made by our government, have seldom been appropriate, 
but we fear that this defect appertains also to those made by other 
patrons, so that we can make no special charge against the highest 
powers.
Too frequently men are appointed to academical chairs, or 
other offices of emolument and honour whose knowledge of Botany is 
of the slenderest kind, while in other instances good botanists are un- 
fortunately selected to fill situations which are totally out of the circle 
of their actual attainments.
Though the late Dr. Graham did after- 
wards acquire a respectable amount of botanical knowledge, to 
meet the exigencies of his position, there can be no question about 
the impropriety of his appointment to a botanical chair at a period 
when his Botany had yet to be learned.
Dr. Thomas Brown held the 
office of Lecturer on Botany in Glasgow, before Dr. Graham.
" Be- 
fore retiring " writes Dr. Balfour, " he asked Dr. Graham to lecture 
for him, which Dr. Graham declined to do, urging as an apology the 
inadequacy of his botanical knowledge ; but ultimately he was pre- 
vailed on to read Dr. Brown's lectures.
On the resignation of Dr.
Brown, the Crown instituted a distinct Chair of Botany, and conferred 
it on Dr. Graham, who was in the habit of referring to this appoint- 
ment as an unexpected event, on which his future success in life de- 
pended." Considerately and delicately as this passage is worded, it 
nevertheless exposes a gross abuse of patronage, such as cannot be

Montague.
We would recommend Dr. Salter's introductory remarks on the un- 
certainty of species in the genus Rubus : they are rather too long for 
our space at present.
Formerly Dr. Salter appeared in the character 
of a describer of 7iew species ; when we half suspected him of in- 
tending a little playful satire upon Messrs.
Borrer and Babington, in 
giving their names to two of his new species, with a third bearing the 
significant name of " tenuis.'''' At any rate, intended or not intended, 
he " hit the right nail on the head," for we have few botanists more 
inclined to accept, if they do not make, new species on slender 
grounds.
In this number we have Dr. S.
taking the side of the " lum- 
pers," and swamping species in the most remorseless manner.
"The ma-jority of the forms," writes Dr. S., " eighteen in number, 
are of the value of varieties only, and where this is the case, it does 
not appear needful to give any description of the character of the spe- 
cies, but only of those points in which the variety differs from the 
normal form.
This applies to the first six plants ; for the description 
of the species to which these belong, I would refer to Babington's 
' Manual.' The last two forms constitute a species which I have long 
observed in the Isle of Wight ; and the ten intermediate ones, which 
now appear grouped as three species, are plants about which the 
greatest confusion has existed, both as to the number of species they 
really constitute â€” each being by many held to be a species â€” and 
also as to the naming of them, their names having been transposed 
in almost every supposable change." The truth is, that no two bota- 
nists agree (as far as our own opportunities go) in applying names to 
Rubi, unless those who hunt in couples, or constantly exchange spe- 
cimens, so that each may know what thing the other intends by any 
given name.
Even this pairing and comparing will not always suf- 
fice, as we have seen proved experimentally.
Nor is it likely it 
should always prove sufficient for uniformity ; for the same botanist 
487 
who names a set of Rubi in 1843 or 1844, will re-name the same 
forms differently in 1845.
This is also a proved fact with a botanist 
who is one of those best known as a describer of British brambles.

Mr. Ord concludes that the true potato [Solanum tuberosum) is in-

under cultivation, and that it was brought into Britain by Drake.
The wild potato of the North American States is the Apios titherosa 
of Pursh, 
Mr. Babington's Synopsis of the Rubi will of course be hailed with 
satisfaction by the botanists who delight in these endlessly varying 
shrubs.
We do not mean to write in terms of disrespect to those very 
acute observers of plants, Mr. Borrer and Mr. Babington, in express- 
ing a supposition that botanists of their school (right or wrong as may 
turn out) will gradually carve out as many species of Rubus as have 
been carved out of Salix ; and that eventually it will be found so im- 
possible to identify them by descriptions, that they will be recom- 
bined into some half-dozen probable species.
The allied genus, Rosa, 
has been dragged through a similar course, by being split into a host 
of book-species, inseparable and undistinguishable in Nature ; but 
these are fast dropping into disregard or oblivion ; and so, we opine, 
488 
will it fare with " sixty three " species of Rubus long before the end 
of this century.
Of Agrimonia odorata, of Aiton, we are compelled to confess entire 
non-acquaintance, unless an indifferent Cornish specimen shall prove 
an English representative thereof.
The specific character given in 
the ' Hortus Kevvensis ' amounts to no character at all as a distinction 
from our ordinary A.
Eupatoria.
The A.
odorata is said to be a larger 
plant, with deeper-coloured flowers, leaves hairy and glandular be- 
neath, not cano-tomentose, calyx less furrowed, and with the lower 
spines reflexed.
The latter character exists in the pressed specimens 
of A.
Eupatoria.

Note on the Disappearance of Plants in certain Localities.
By Thomas Meehan, Esq.
Many botanists cannot have failed to observe that certain plants 
often exhibit a remarkable degree of inconstancy in some localities 
with regard to quantity.
Sometimes a locality which is known to 
produce a large quantity of any given species, will barely produce a 
handful; sometimes it will even totally disappear in that, and reappear 
in no situation near the other.
Usually, however, if they disappear 
in one locality, they may be found in some situation near to the for- 
mer one, which occurrence may perhaps be termed a migration .
The 
following example may probably illustrate this better : it is a case of 
the Sisymbrium Sophia, which, in a work I have now before me by 
Dr. Pulteney, ' Catalogues of the Birds, Shells, and some of the more 
rare Plants of Dorsetshire,' published in 1813, is stated to "be met 
with near the Ferry, on the Ham side of the water, at Poole," but now, 
and I am indebted for the knowledge of this fact to Dr. Bell Salter, it 
may scarcely be met with there, but is in great plenty in a situation 
a little distance from this.
Circumstances may often be met with in the Isle of Wight, which 
bring these observations repeatedly before the memory, and which in- 
cite the ardent admirer and devoted lover of Nature to an investiga- 
tion of the causes that may lead to such curious results.
There are many plants that certainly existed in the Flora of the 
Isle of Wight that are now missing; and there are many that have 
been reported to exist by various accurate observers, that have hitherto 
been vainly sought for.
Among the former may be mentioned An- 
489 
chusa sempervirens, Atropa Belladonna, Lathyrus maritimus, Mentha 
piperita and Teucrium Chamaedrys ; and among the lattei* Cineraria 
campestris, Diotis raaritima, Gentiana campestris, Gnaphalium sylva- 
ticum and Scilla verna.
The circumstances T would more particularly narrate have for their 
subject the Chlora perfoliata.
It was in 1841 that I first became ac- 
quainted with this plant, which was then growing plentifully on the 
calcareous clay on the sea-shore between Ryde and St. Clare.
In 
consequence of a notice which I saw, â€” I think in Mrs. Loudon's 
' Ornamental Annuals,' I was desirous to obtain seed of it for cultiva- 
tion in the flower-garden, but when the blooming season in 1842 
came, there was not a plant in existence.
In 1843 the same thing 
occurred, and I suppose I was satisfied with the idea, that the sea 
had washed away all the soil on which the plants grew, for I thought 
no more on the subject.
However, in 1844, while strolling over the 
clay, I was agreeably surprised to observe plants in bloom in the 
greatest abundance.
During the past year, 1845, I frequently search- 
ed for it, but the whole number of plants found was three, and these 
so starved and melancholy looking, as rather to excite pity than ad- 
miration.
In this narrative there are two things worthy of being taken into 
consideration : the great decrease in the quantity or total disappear- 
ance of the plant in some seasons, and the vitality of the seeds.
The 
first of these subjects will be attended in its examination with some 
little difficulty, because the same effects do not happen to the same 
plants in different localities, for, while the plant was scarcely found 
last season at St. Clare, it might be found in great abundance on the 
chalky ground and dry banks at Carisbrook.
If the same effect had 
been observed in both places, if the plant had been equally scarce at 
Carisbrook as at St. Clare, we should have admitted, as good pre- 
sumptive evidence, that some atmospheric peculiarity had been the 
acting cause ; and the constitutional nature of the plant, which is 
well known to gardeners to be impatient of moisture, would have ma- 
terially strengthened the coincidence between the disappearance of 
the plant and the cold and wet season of 1845, and between its plen- 
tifulness and the warm and dry season of 1844.
But while it is evident that we may not look to the atmosphere 
alone for a solution of our subject^^ we may take it into consideration 
in connexion with the state of the soil in each separate locality, and 
if we find that there is a great and manifest degree of difference be- 
tween the two, we may not look for equal results from them, even 
490 
though they may be under exactly the same atmospheric conditions : 
these considerations are necessary to be borne in mind in the present 
examination, because, as I have ah-eady stated, there is a great diffe- 
rence between the soils of the stations mentioned.
I am unable to 
adduce anything, either pro or con, for the disappearance of the plant 
in 1842 and 43, in consequence of a want of sufficiently attentive ob- 
servation.
But in 1844 the season was remarkable for an unusual 
amount of dryness, which had the effect of well drying the usually 
over-saturated clay on the sea-shore ; and consequently the seed of 
Chlora perfoliata were in the conditions necessary for germination.
In the past season the effects on the clay have been the reverse, and 
hence the non-appearance of the plants.
The fact of seeds preserving their vitality for a long time in the 
earth is well known, and the present case of seeds of Chlora perfoliata 
having remained ibr three years in the soil without germinating, only 
adds one more item to our stock of useful knowledge.

Remarks on certain Plants growing near Fareham.
By W.
L. NoTCUTT, Esq.
It was my intention, in communicating to your periodical some time 
since, a list of the plants found in the vicinity of Fareham, Hants, to 
have followed it by a paper containing a few remarks upon certain of 
the species therein mentioned, but a variety of circumstances have hi- 
therto prevented by making the attempt.
The present paper I there- 
fore commence with the view of carrying out my intention, and I 
trust that the desultoriness of my observations will be pardoned.
I 
may first notice a few typographical errors which should be corrected, 
as they would mislead any botanist who inquired for the places as 
printed.
In pp.
203 â€” 8 " Cams " should be read instead of " Cams." 
In the remainder of the list it is correct.
P. 204, 1.
39, " Paxol" lane 
should be " Puxol " lane.
P. 205, 1.
31, Redenham should be Beden- 
ham, and p.
205, 1.41, "Warsath" should be "Warsash," "Mrs.
Robinson " should have been printed instead of " Mr. R." Hyperi- 
cum tetragonum ought to have been H.
quadrangulum.
Viola trico- 
lor should have added to it B.
arvensis, the normal form not being 
491 
found near Fareham, as far as I am aware.
The localities printed for 
Ranunculus aquatilis, fi.
panthorix, belong to R.
fluitans, and the lo- 
cality for the former is Chai'k Common.
Three plants have been ac- 
cidentally omitted from the list, viz.
: â€” 
Potamogeton crispum.
Pond at Uplands.
Chenopodiiim murale.
Under a wall at liower Quay.
Fagus sylvatica.
Common.
Thus much for errors.
A very interesting feature in this list is the fact that it contains 
some plants which appear, as far as is hitherto known, to be entirely 
absent from the Isle of Wight, a district in the immediate vicinity, 
though some of them grow at or near Hill Head, which is opposite 
the shores of the island and only four or five miles distant.
Thus 
Glyceria aquatica, Scirpus lacustris, Matricaria Chamomilla and Car- 
damine amara are, I am informed by Dr. Bromfield, thus absent from 
the island Flora, while they are truly wild in the localities indicated 
for them in the list, and, except the second, in tolerable plenty.
Spe- 
cimens have been communicated to Dr. B.
as verifying the correct- 
ness of the names.
The case may be reversed, and there are doubt- 
less many in the Isle of Wight which are quite absent from the neigh- 
bourhood of Fareham : thus, Anthemis Cotula, though the pest of 
farmers on the island, I never could find about Fareham, though we 
had both A.
arvensis and A.
nobilis.
Another curious fact is the al- 
most total absence of two common species, Draba verna and Arabis 
Thaliana.
They are both included in the list, I having found a plant 
or two of each, far advanced in seed, on a wall at the iron-mills, Font- 
ley ; yet as common plants they may be considered as absent.
The 
absence of such common plants from particular districts is very inte- 
resting, and in this case also it stands in contrast to the Isle of Wight 
Flora, for in that district the Draba is very abundant.
Potamogeton 
natans, Papaver dubium, Bidens cernua, Scutellaria galericulata, and 
Chrysanthemum segetum are among other common plants which ap- 
pear to be absent from the district, not, however, for want of suitable 
situations for their growth.
Of the last, I once found a specimen, but 
I expect it had been dropped with some corn accidentally.
OEnanthe pimpinelloides as marked on my list, is, I have no doubt, 
the plant of Linnaeus.
Its roundish-ovate tubers at a distance of an 
inch or more from the base of the stem â€” its fruit and inflorescence, 
together with its habitat, all concur in marking it as the true plant ; 
and Fareham will therefore afford a new station for it.
In " the Sal- 
terns " its chief companion is Genista tinctoria, and in the field at 
492 
" Cams " plenty of Silavis piatensis springs into flower when the 
CEnanthe has vanished.
My observation of the plant at Fareham 
enables me to corroborate Dr. Bromfield's account (Phytol.
ii.
241) of 
the uncertainty of its appearance.
In 1843 it was abundant in the 
Salterns, and in 1844 not a plant was to be found there, while in 1844 
it was plentiful in the field at Cams, where J had not previously seen 
it.
A similar instance is mentioned in an interesting work, ' Wild 
Flowers of the Year," in the disappearance of Spiranthes autumnalis 
from a field at Tunbridge Wells in 1844, where, in the previous year 
it was extremely abundant.
It seems desirable that those plants 
should be noticed which are subject to these periodical disappearances, 
and, as far as can be, the causes traced.
I have in a former paper 
mentioned Thlaspi arvense to possess such a character.
The oxlip [Primula vulgaris, (3.
caulescens) grows, though very 
sparingly, in a copse at White-dell ; and here I found it in a curious 
state, of which I had previously heard, but never before had an oppor- 
tunity of observing, viz., true primroses and oxlips (i3.
caulescens) 
growing from the same root.
There were several specimens which 
exhibited the same phenomenon.
Carex extensa, which grows in great plenty at Cams, just a little 
further from the edge of the water than Statice rariflora, puts on a 
caespitose appearance, which I have not seen noticed.
It grows in 
tufts or stools of considerable size.
In the Salterns, where there are 
a few plants of it, it does not assume this character.
At Cams it has 
to push its way through shingle, and it grows in a clayey soil full of 
pebbles : this may perhaps have some influence on its mode of 
growth.
In gathering a quantity of specimens of Pyrus communis to be 
dried as duplicates, from the only wild specimen in the district, I no- 
ticed a curious circumstance after bringing them home, a distance of 
about two miles ; on turning them out for the purpose of putting 
them in press, I observed that they possessed a very offensive odour, 
exactly like that of Chenopodium olidum, only not in so powerful a 
degree, and having no other plants with me at the time, it could not 
have originated with another plant.
Potamogeton plantagineus is very abundant on Titchfield Common, 
and 1 think it will eventually be found to be no uncommon plant in 
boggy situations.
I remember seeing it at the new reservoir, Daven- 
try, Northamptonshire, in great plenty, though at the time I was un- 
acquainted with it.
The radiate variety of Centaurea nigra is very abundant : is this 
493 
only a variety ?
I am inclined to think that it has quite as good claims 
to be considered a species, as some which, in these hair-splitting days, 
have that honour.
Is it not peculiar to the south of England ?
Of 
that variable plant, Scolopcndrium vulgare, there is a ourious variety 
at Place-house, but it is scarce.
The frond is rather stunted, irregu- 
lar in the outline, and minutely crisped or plaited only just on the 
edge : the var.
crispum is a very different form, the frond being waved 
in rather large folds, which extend almost to the midrib.
Respecting Equisetum Telraateia, I may perhaps contribute a re- 
mark or two bearing on the discussion respecting its habits, which 
appeared in the first volume of the ' Phytologist.' At Fontley it is 
abundant on banks of earth and clay which have been thrown up from 
excavations on the South-western railway, which passes close by.
Ponds have been formed in the hollows between some of these banks, 
and the Equisetum grows both on the banks and down to and within 
the margin of the water.
I gathered several specimens in flower, 
which were growing in the water where it was three or four inches 
deep.
In Gill copse, where it also grows, there is one part of the 
copse which is quite swampy, and in winter is covered with water, 
and there, and there alone, grows the Equisetum.
In every instance 
where I have seen Equisetum Telmateia, it has always been on 
marshy ground.
I have certainly never seen it in what could be call- 
ed a dry situation.
The driest was on the upper part of the banks at 
Fontley, where it is stunted, not being more than twelve to eighteen 
inches high, while in the swamp in Gill copse I have seen it four or 
five feet high.
In a shallow pond in the same situation with the Equisetum, at 
Fontley, grows Ranunculus fluitans in abundance, and presenting ex- 
actly the same appearance as in a rapid stream, where the swiftness 
of the current might appear to have caused its peculiar appearance.
In this pond, however, the water is quite still, and there is no current 
to cause the different chai'acter which it displays from R.
aquatilis.
The neighbourhood of Faversham, in Kent (of which the Flora has 
been published by Mr. Cowell), appears to be very similar to that of 
Fareham, both in geological character, in physical aspect, in the num- 
ber of plants ascertained to inhabit the respective districts, and in the 
degree of latitude.
A comparison of the two Floras shows a singu- 
lar correspondence and yet a remarkable difference, as will appear 
from the following analysis : â€”

may be common to both, though not yet detected.
I have not ap-

should you think them of any value, I could forward them another

[I MAY perhaps be allowed to add a note to Mr. Notcutt's observa- 
tion on Centaurea nigra.
In Herefordshire the radiate variety of this 
plant is very abundant, much more so than the normal form.
The 
radiate form has a greater partiality for hedge-banks and ditches 
than the normal form, which prefers pastures ; but occasionally they 
occur in the same field, growing side by side.
Under all circum- 
stances, the difference seems marked and decided, and I have often 
been inclined to ask with Mr. Notcutt, " is this only a variety ?" I 
need not inform so able a botanist as Mr. Notcutt, that the radiate 
plant is usually considered a species on the continent, whence it 
comes labelled as C.
nigrescens of Willdenow, whose description is 
very clear and intelligible.
Our English authors unite these two 
plants without expressing even a doubt, a circumstance rather to be 
admired in Mr. Babington, whose aversion to the multiplication of 
species is not often exhibited.

Note on the English Localities for Cerastiiim alpinum.
By Hewett C.
Watson, Esq.
In the February * Phytologist ' (Phytol.
ii.
423) Mr. James Back- 
house records the finding of Cerastium alpinum on Striden Edge, 
Helvellyn ; and he adds, " a plant frequently met with in Scotland, 
but not, that I know of, recorded in any botanical work as a native 
of England." There would have seemed more justice to his prede- 
cessors, had Mr. Backhouse looked into the most likely work for as- 
certaining the fact, before sending the remark for print.
The same 
locality, of the Patterdale side of Helvellyn, was recorded in the first 
volume of the * New Botanist's Guide,' ten years ago, on the authority 
of the late Mr. Winch's manuscript notes â€” a most industrious and 
generally correct compiler of botanical localities in the northern coun- 
ties.
In the Supplement, printed in the second volume of the same 
work, the locality is explained more specially by the mention of "Stri- 
den Edge," on the authority of Mr. Joseph Woods, who, indeed, was 
the original informant of Mr. Winch, so long ago as 1828.
Mr.
Woods first, I think, published that locality in Hooker's ' Companion 
to the Botanical Magazine.' A Lincolnshire locality is copied into 
Turner and Dillwyn's ' Guide ;' and it is re-copied into the * New 
Guide,' though as one probably erroneous.
The same species has 
been repeatedly recorded as a Caernarvonshire plant ; but Mr. Back- 
house may not consider that locality sufficiently an English one, even 
in contrast with the Scottish Highlands.
I communicated these facts 
to Mr. Backhouse, in the hope that he might correct the error himself, 
but in reply, that gentleman writes, " Thou art quite at liberty to rec- 
tify my mistake in the * Phytologist,' and it may be well, at the same 
time, to correct another of my blunders of a similar character, where, 
at page 894, it is stated that Polemonium caeruleum, which is found 
in Teesdale, was new to that district, whereas we afterwards noticed 
that it had been previously found by John Bell, of Middleton, in 
Teesdale.
See 'Phytologist,' page 741."

Borrera Jlavicans discovered in Fruit near Penzance, 
By Alfred Greenwood, Esq.
I HAVE great pleasure in communicating the discovery of the fruit 
of Borrera flavicans, which I found some days ago in an orchard, in 
the neighbourhood of this town.
I first brought home a single speci- 
men, not being aware, at the time of gathering, that it was in fruit.
Afterwards Mr. Ralfs and myself succeeded in getting in the same 
and surrounding orchards about seventeen more : most of these had 
from one to three apothecia upon each of them, but a few were more 
thickly fruited, and one specimen had, I believe, as many as one hun- 
dred shields upon it.
I understand there is only one recorded instance of the fruit of this 
lichen having been previously found in Britain : this was a single 
specimen gathered by Mr. liobb in the eastern part of the county.
It is now at Truro, in the herbarium of the Horticultural Society of 
Cornwall.
Even the barren specimens of the Borrera are valuable, from the 
size which they attain in some of these orchards ; indeed, the fruit- 
trees are so covered with different species of Parmelia, Usnea, &c., 
that frequently but little of the bark can be seen, and many of the 
smaller branches are quite destroyed by these epiphytes.
The ap- 
pearance thus given to the orchards struck me as peculiarly charac- 
teristic of the country on ray first arrival from Essex, where the trees 
are comparatively free from this nuisance, for such it is to the gardener, 
although it adds to the beauty of the scenery, and is interesting to 
the botanist, particularly when he finds among the lichens such a ra- 
rity as Borrera flavicans in fruit.

Note on Hieracium pulmonarium.
By Wm. Borrer, Esq., F.L.S.
I AM glad to learn from the remarks in the ' Phytologist ' (ii.
442), 
that Mr. Watson has come independently to the same conclusion as 
myself respecting Hieracium pulmonarium of Smith, viz., that it is 
identical with the plant which we regard as H.
nigrescens of Willde- 
now.
I believe that Mr. Babington, too, now agrees with us.
My 
opinion has reference to the specimens which I gathered in 1810, from 
rocks by the river Nevis (or Nivis) from one of which the figure in 
407 
'English Botany,' t.
2307, was drawn.
I believe it is distinguishable 
as a species from H.
alpinum, but it is certainly more nearly allied to 
it than to H.
murorum.
This is far from being the only one of the genus, even among our 
comparatively few British species, that is, as yet, imperfectly under- 
stood, although some of them have been much written about.
I will 
hope for additional light when we have Mr. Watson's further remarks 
on those which he is cultivating.

P.S. â€” I have one more error to correct in the list of mosses, p.
436 
of the present volume.
The supposed Bryum mnioides, from Helvellyn, is, as I thought it 
at first, B.
punctatum.
The Malham plant is the true B.
mnioides.

Notes on the Ranunculus Lenormandi of Schultz.
By Hewett C.
Watson, Esq., Mem. Imp.
Acad.
Cajs.
Leop.
Nat. Curios.
In Mr. Babington's ' Manual of British Botany,' a variety of Ra- 
nunculus hederaceus is mentioned, under the name of " grandiflorus," 
distinguished by having petals " broad and much longer than the ca- 
lyx ; " but no mention is made there respecting any peculiarity in 
the leaves of that variety.
In the ' London Catalogue of British Plants,' a variety of R.
hede- 
raceus is entered under the name of " partitus." That Catalogue not 
being descriptive, of course only the name occurs ; which was sug- 
gested by the plant having an intermediate form of leaf between the 
ordinary R.
hederaceus and the R.
tripartitus of De Candolle.
In the 'Annals' for last year (xvi.
141) we find an account of "Ra- 
nunculus Lenormandi, F.
IV.
Schultz,''' which is there identified with 
Mr. Babington's variety ' grandiflorus ; ' and the following description 
is given of it : â€” " It differs from R.
hederaceus by each lobe of its 
leaves bearing two or three notches, its carpels obovate and tipped 
with a terminal style, petals broader and longer, stipules very broad 
and scarcely at all adnate to the petiole.
It is a considerably larger 
plant than R.
hederaceus, and has probably been overlooked in Eng- 
land, as either that species in a vigorous state, or perhaps as a state of 
R. aquatilis, from which the want of capillary-divided leaves, and the 
absence of setae on the receptacle, distinguish it." 
498 
In the 'Phytologist' for February (Phytol.
ii.
423) Mr. James Back- 
house mentions his having found a variety of Ranunculus hederaceus 
" with remarkably large flowers " near the head of Coniston Water, 
which was new to him, but probably the variety named ' grandiflorus ' 
by Babington.
Mr. Backhouse obligingly sent me a specimen of his Coniston 
plant ; at the same time informing me that Mr. Babington had recog- 
nized it as his variety ' grandiflorus.' This specimen has shown me 
that the variety ' partitus ' of the London Catalogue is identical with 
Mr. Babington's variety ' grandiflorus,' which I was fully prepared to 
believe ; though Mr. Babington takes great care that T shall not get 
from himself any authentic examples of his newly recorded species or 
varieties.
Thus, the three names â€” Lenormandi, grandiflorus, and 
partitus â€” are synonyms of each other.
Whether regarded as a spe- 
cies or as a variety, it will be advisable to adopt the name of ' Lenor- 
mandi' for this plant; that of 'grandiflorus' having been long applied 
as a specific name for an Asiatic Ranunculus, which has really large 
flowers.
I have a specimen brought from Cumberland twelve years ago ; 
and have frequently observed the plant about Esher and Claygate, in 
this neighbourhood.
I should say that the most obvious difference 
between the ordinary form of hederaceus and Lenormandi, is found 
in the latter having the lobes of its leaves more deeply divided, in ad- 
dition to the secondary notches or lobes, which gives it considerable 
resemblance to R.
aquatilis.
The flower is certainly larger than usual 
with R.
hederaceus ; but it is still small when compared with that of 
R. aquatilis, in its usual size.
I cannot say that Lenormandi is a 
larger plant than hederaceus.
I have seen the latter both larger and 
smaller than any examples of the former.
Though I have often look- 
ed at the two plants, where growing intermixed, I could never satisfy 
myself of their distinctness as species ; and, indeed, I have some- 
times felt uncertain to which of the two some examples should be 
assigned.
There is still a third form of R.
hederaceus, which grows out of wa- 
ter, and is distinguished by its more deeply divided, almost deltoid, 
and divergent lobes of the leaves, the flowers varying in size, but less

On the other side, I have seen some spe- 
cimens of hederaceus with reniform and entire leaves.

p.S. _ I beg leave to send two additional remarks, by way of post- 
script to my notes on Ranunculus Lenormandi, which has been 
brought before the readers of the ' Phytologist ' by Mr. Babington's 
paper, of an earlier date than mine (Phytol.
ii.
467) ; and which I did 
not see before the 6th of March.
When Mr. B.
writes that " the first 
notice of it as a native of Britain is in the ' Annals of Natural Histo- 
ry,' xiv.
141," he must only intend to say the first notice of the name 
" Lenormandi," â€” one of very recent origin.
The plant itself had been 
recorded as a native of Britain, both in his own Manual and in the 
London Catalogue.
Secondly.
â€” I fear that the characters mentioned by Mr. Babington 
will not be found sufficiently discriminative.
But this point must be 
determined by examination of the living plants.
In specimens glued 
to paper, as are most of those in my herbarium, it is not easy to de- 
cide whether the stipules are a little more or less adnate; but in some 
loose examples of Lenormandi I find them certainly adnate for one- 
third to one-half of their length ; and, moreover, varying considerably 
in breadth.
Again, I cannot find much difference in the position of 
the style, when fruits are compared together at equal stages of growth.
At a very early stage, the style is more distinctly terminal in both ; 
but it is rendered apparently lateral, by the obliquity (or unequal en- 
largement of the two sides) of the fruit in its advance towards maturity.
The question therefore arises, whether the alleged difference in the 
position of the style has been discovered only by comparing the fruit 
of Lenormandi in an earlier stage with that of hederaceus in a later 
stage of development ?
Half a dozen pods of the common garden 
pea, at different ages between the flower and maturity, will illustrate 
this change in the position of the style, by the unequal growth of two 
sides of a fruit ; â€” allowance being made for the difference between a 
roundish and single-seeded fruit, and the elongated pod of a pea.

â€”Edward Doubleday, Esq., V.P., F.L.S., in the 
chair.
Donations to the Library were announced from the American Phi- 
losophical Society, Mr. G.
Rich and Mr. W.
Pamplin.
Dr. Gilbert 
M'Nab presented some plants from Jamaica.
500 
The following plants were exhibited : â€” 
1. Sisyrinchium fanceps?
). â€” Communicated by the Rev. H.
L. 
Jenner, by whom it had been received as an indigenous Irish plant, 
collected in a wood near Woodford, county of Galway.
The speci- 
mens were past flowering, but the genus is certain, and the species 
probably correct.
If truly native, this will be another added to the 
short list of plants common to America and the British Isles, but un- 
known in Europe, unless as naturalized plants.
2. Ranunculus Lenormandi, Schultz.
â€” Communicated by Mr.
James Backhouse, from the head of Coniston Lake ; also by Mr.
Hewett Watson, from Esher Common, Surrey.
This has been long 
known, but has usually (and perhaps correctly) been considered a va- 
riety of R.
hederaceus.
The Esher specimens are larger, and less 
like R.
hederaceus than are those of Coniston.
It is the variety 
"partitus" of the ' London Catalogue.' [See Phytol.
ii.
467, 497].
3. Erica Mackaii, Hook.
â€” Seven specimens selected from others 
communicated by Mr. Mackay.
They were selected in order to show 
that Mackaii passes into Tetralix by intermediate forms, which illus- 
trate the gradual change of habit and charactf r.
4. Glyceria Jluitans, Br., and G.
plicata, Fr. â€” Communicated 
by Mr. Moore, from a field near Hampstead, to illustrate the diffe- 
rences between the (reputedly two) species.
[See Phytol.
ii.
484].
5. Saxifraga umbrosa, Linn.
â€” A numerous series, selected from 
others comnuuiicated by Mr. Mackay and Mr. Andrews, illustrating 
the gradual change in the character of the leaves, from the crenate 
form found in Yorkshire and on the Pyrenees, to the very acutely ser- 
rate form named " serratifolia." Of this latter there is a duplicato-ser- 
rate sub-variety, which Mr. Andrews sends under the name of 
" Ogilby's Saxifrage." 
6. (Enanthes.
â€” A selection from the specimens collected by the 
Rev. Andrew Bloxam and Mr. Lees, in 1845.
The specimens of 
Lachenalii sent by Mr. Lees, had the roots broken short, so that no 
thickness or tuber-like portion appears.
The roots of Mr. Bloxam's 
plants of Lachenalii were whole, and mostly showed a very decided 
thickening at one to three inches below the base of the stem.
One 
of these had short and fusiform roots, precisely of the same character 
with the roots of Mr. Lees' examples of peucedanifolia or silaifolia, 
showing indisputably that the root alone would not distinguish the 
two species.
Two of Mr. Lees' specimens of pimpinelloides {Linn.) 
had most different roots, although both were in the early flowering 
stage : in one the knobs were numerous, and so fully grown as to 
501 
look like large beads on a thread ; while in the other the roots might 
have passed for slender forms of liachenalii, except for a single half- 
grown tuber on one of them.
Internally the roots of pimpinelloides 
are tough and fibrous at maturity, requiring an effort to break them ; 
while those of Lachenalii are very brittle.
The Society has now a 
very full series of these three species.

Dr. Alexander stated that he had been persuaded by his friend.
Dr.

"A 
country that had been little explored by botanists, though seeming to 
claim their especial notice.
Situated in a degree of latitude almost 
the same as that of the middle of France, at the base of the great cen- 
tral alpine group of Europe â€” three branches of which terminate in 
this province ; â€” and on the eastern side exposed to the influence of 
the great plain of Hungary, where the winter is as cold as in the Steppes 
of Russia, and the summer as hot as the warmest parts of Italy or 
vSpain, it might be expected to evince in its vegetation the effects of a

climate so modified." The excursion commenced about the begin- 
ning of May and lasted till the end of July ; during which time Dr.
A. was enabled to make a large and valuable collection of plants, in- 
cluding several species new to Styria.
Specimens of the more inte- 
resting species were exhibited to the meeting, the Society's herbarium 
having been enriched by a very complete set through the kindness of 
Dr. Alexander, and were greatly admired for their beauty and the ex- 
cellent manner in which they have been preserved.
A letter from Dr. Bid well, Albrighton, was read, announcing the 
discovery of Vaccinium macrocarpum near Mold, in Flintshire, in Au-

and from Mr. W.
A. Stables, noticing the discovery of Neottia nidus- 
avis, in Cawdor Woods, Nairnshire.
Dr. Balfour exhibited specimens of diseases in plants caused by in- 
sects ; one of these consisted of peculiar stipitate excrescences on the 
leaves of a North American tree, concerning which Dr. B.
read some 
extracts from a letter which he had received from Mr. Adam White, 
of the British Museum : â€” 
" The swellings on the leaves of the plant seem to be caused by 
some species of plant-louse ; one kind is very hurtful to the peach 
tree, but attacks the leaves in a different way to the insect on your 
specimen.
Dr. Harris, in his admirable work on the Insects of Mas- 
sachussets injurious to vegetation, speaks of some Aphides, 'the punc- 
tures of which affect plants in a most singular manner, producing 
warts or swellings, which are sometimes solid and sometimes hollow, 
and contain in their interior a swarm of lice, the descendants of a sin- 
gle individual, whose punctures were the original cause of the tumour.
1 have seen reddish tumours of this kind as big as a pigeon's egg, 
growing upon leaves, to which they were attached by a slender neck, 
and containing thousands of small lice in their interior.' Possibly 
the excrescences may be caused by some minute moth (Tortricidous 
or Tineidous), as there are evidences of some little larva that has 
eaten away the parts between the cuticle at the base of some of the 
excrescences.
Yom* specimens I have examined, but do not find any 
fragments of the insects, although there are traces of dung, and a 
small part of a web, certainly remains of a moth, and there is no rea- 
son why the excrescences may not be the nidi for the eggs of an 
Eriosoma (an aphidious insect), and the web, dung and eaten part, 
evidences of some Tinea.
Mr. Doubleday has observed similar warts 
on leaves, but knows not how they are produced." â€” W.

Remarks on (Enanthe Lachenalii.
By George Fitt, Esq.
There being some discrepancy between the statements of Messrs.
Watson and Lees in the ' Phy tologist ' respecting the form of the roots 
of this plant, I thought that if I could obtain some Yarmouth speci- 
mens, they would perhaps throw light on the subject in dispute.
Most of the roots which I had seen differed considerably from that 
figured by Mr. Lees ; and Mr. Watson having, for the most part, 
figured only single tubers, I felt sure that the roots of our Yarmouth 
plant were not described in the papers of those gentlemen.
At the time I read their remarks, the ditches in which our plant 
principally grows, were covered with ice : by breaking it, however, I 
succeeded in obtaining a few small roots, which I found by the leaves 
appearing beneath the surface of the water.
Of these specimens I 
sent a i&w to each of the above-named gentlemen.
The ice having 
entirely disappeared a few days after, I easily obtained a larger sup- 
ply, a selection from which, now in Mr. Newman's possession, have 
already been alluded to on the cover of the 'Phytologist' of last 
month.
The first thing apparent in these is the constant presence of tubers 
intermixed with fibrous roots, but on closer inspection the tubers are 
found to be attached to the withered stem of last season, and the fi- 
brous roots to be of a more recent growth and proceeding from an off- 
set, now in course of development, and which is to be the plant of 
next season.
This may be proved by any specimen ; for simply by 
the pressure of the finger the offset will break from the old stem, 
which will then be found adhering to the tubers, and the fibrous roots 
proceeding firom the offset.
In some instances the tuber appears to 
have been buried an inch or two beneath the surface of the mud, to 
which it has sent up a stem, and where a whorl of fibrous roots have 
been produced.
This will be clearly understood by a glance at the 
annexed figure, selected from many similar ones, as best showing this 
peculiarity, as well as the twofold character of the root.
The speci- 
men itself is now in Mr. Newman's hands.
The upper portion of this root, a, a, which might be easily sepa- 
rated from the lower, if caution were not used in taking it up, repre- 
sents the fibrous root of Lachenalii, as figured by Mr. Lees, and the 
lower portion, 6, 5, resembles his figure of peucedanifolia.
In those 
roots which have not sunk beneath the surface of the mud the offsets 
grow out of the woody crown which unites the tubers, and then the 
two kinds of root are mingled together, and their different age is not 
504 
so apparent, unless the new ones are broken off in the manner already 
described.
I have now in water nearly 100 roots : amongst them is every vari- 
ety of form from the nearly fibrous, described by Mr. Lees' figure, to 
<i, a, Root of Lachenalii according lo Mr. Lees.

d, Old Stem withered and fallen.
Others which include all the forms figured by Mr. Watson in the 
' Phytologist ' (Phytol.
ii.
398), as peucedanifolia and Lachenalii, as 
well as most of that gentleman's figures of pimpinelloides, p.
397.
It 
may be observed that in all the former kind (that is to say, those most 
nearly resembling Mr. Lees' figure), there is the evident disposition to 
become tuberous, most of the roots being in a state of transition 
where not already tuberous.
This twofold character of root can hardly be peculiar to the Yar- 
mouth and some few other stations, although it would appear to be so 
from the testimony of some coiTespondents in the ' Phytologist,' but 
who have, I suspect, possessed themselves of only the upper portion 
of the roots, from not having taken them up with sufficient care.
I 
am the more inclined to this opinion, because some of my large fibrous 
roots lately taken up agree with Mr. Lees' figure of Lachenalii, not 
only in form, but in the presence of fibrillae ; and because many, if 
505 
not all, the mature specimens which I have dried, have had roots 
more or less inclined to be tuberous.
It must not therefore be infer- 
red that the form of my roots is owing to the season at which they 
were taken up.
The following circumstance quite disproves such a 
supposition, and shows, moreover, that the root of our Yarmouth plant 
is essentially tuberous.
In the summer of 1844 I took up a large root 
without stem, consisting of several tubers, and carried it home for ex- 
amination.
Something caused me to forget it and it lay a month or 
more in water before I again noticed it.
One of its tubers had then 
been broken off at about half its length from its connexion with the 
stem, and the lower or detached portion had thrown out leaves from 
two of the eyes with which the tubers are studded.
No appearance 
of stems was visible, owing, I imagine, to the tuber not having been 
buried, but fully exposed to light while lying in water.
This speci- 
men I showed to Dr. Lindley last summer.
The following appears to be the process of formation in the root of 
Lachenalii : originally a fibre, it swells for a portion of its length 
commencing at a little distance from its lower extremity, and gradu- 
ally tapering upwards.
The lower extremity itself remains unaltered, 
and is the terminal fibre of the tuber, just like that represented in Mr.
Lees' figure of peucedauifolia, the tuber of which is doubtless formed 
on the same principle.
In the 'Penny Cyclopaedia' is a cut of GE.
crocata, showing Siji- 
brous root above the tubers.
The expense of engraving forbids the 
introduction of more figures here.
I have dried forty-four roots for the Botanical Society, and to de- 
scribe them it will be sufficient to refer to the figures already shown 
in the ' Phytologist.' They may be classed as follows : â€” 
Eight, exhibiting the peculiarity of the annexed figure.
Three, large, coming near to Mr. Lees' figure, but agreeing rather 
with his description (Phytol.
ii.
358), in "thickening gradually towards 
the posterior end." The old stems are attached to these.
Six roots, some having tubers six inches long, and including all 
the forms of such figured by Mr. Watson.
Old stems remaining.
Two roots, large ; tubers thick at the lower extremity, so much so 
in one as almost to appear stalked, resembling Mr. Watson's pimpi- 
nelloides (Phytol.
ii.
397), the third figure from the right hand.
Old 
stems remaining..
Nineteen smaller roots, of various sizes, including every form, even 
that of the Basle specimen, given by Mr. Watson as Lachenalii.
Most, if not all, of these have produced stems.
506 
Six roots found in a cluster, matted together, very small, which are 
probably seedlings ; they have generally a double tuber forked down- 
wards.
In all my specimens the thickening of the roots varies much in the 
same plant; generally the medium sized roots are the stoutest in pro- 
portion ; the larger being more inclined to the slender form, although 
there are many exceptions to this.
One of the roots sent to Mr. Newman has a peculiarity which I 
have seen in only three or four instances.
It is similar to the an- 
nexed figure, except in one respect, that is, the withered stem of last 
year, which is still remaining, proceeds from the upper part of the 
subterranean stem at the base of the offset, instead of from the crown 
of the tubers, as seen in the engraving.
This makes the tubers a sea- 
son older than the stem of last year, and proves that they do not al- 
ways wither annually.
Indeed, to judge from two other roots amongst 
my specimens, they appear to be capable of three or even four years 
duration.
One of them has the ascending shoot, to the left of the an- 
nexed figure, of last years growth, with the old stem attached to it, 
and just below where its fibrous root may be supposed to have grown, 
is a single tuber still remaining.
The other ascending shoot has this 
winter produced an oflset.
In the second specimen there is only one ascending shoot, and 
which has tubers at the lower end, one tuber half way up, and an off- 
set at the surface.
Now if the fibrous root is produced in winter or 
in early spring and becomes tuberous during the summer, these two 
plants were produced thus : the lower tubers were fibrous in the spring 
of 1844 and tuberous in the autumn.
The second tuber was fibrous 
in the spring of 1845, and matured in the following autumn.
The 
present fibres are of recent growth, and will be tubers next autumn ; 
the plant will then have existed during three seasons at least.
I have been thus particular in my statements, because it may be 
an assistance to others who may feel disposed to pursue the inquiry 
still further, which 1 hope to do myself.
My plan in taking up the 
roots is to dig out as large a lump of mud as will contain the whole 
root, and then to wash it away, the only method to avoid fracturing 
the tubers.
Of the rest of the plant I cannot say much at present, except that 
some of the lower leaves, at this early season, are decidedly bi-pin- 
nate.
Mr. Lees has kindly sent me specimens of his pimpinelloides and 
peucedanifolia.
I have met with nothing like the former, and scarcely 
507 
anything which could be mistaken for the root he sent me of the lat- 
ter, taken as a whole.
Amongst the numerous specimens here alluded to, are some so 
much stouter in all their parts, and having the remaining old stems so 
much more strong and woody than others, that I feel inclined to attri- 
bute it to some other cause than accidental luxuriance of growth.
It 
may be found in the age of the plant â€” and this I shall endeavour to 
ascertain by the examination of other roots.
Geo. Fitt.
Yarmouth, February 10, 1846.
P.S. â€” I have planted about twenty roots, both tubers and fibres, 
in pots, where I shall endeavour to bring them to the flowering state 
for the examination of their roots.

With the exception of the " Botanical Information," these contents

The " Information "

Bangdom,' an advertisement of Mr. Lobb's Javanese plants, collected 
for sale, and a continuation of Mr. Geyer's Notes on the plants of the 
Missouri and Oregon territories.
From the notes of Mr. Geyer we 
extract a further corroboration of a natural fact which has been ob- 
served in other parts of America.
It would be well if other travellers 
would also give examples, by name, in support of the alleged facts.
508 
" It is a curious fact " says Mr. Geyer, " that while the forests are left 
undisturbed, the remains are always composed of such or such kinds 
in almost unchanged proportion.
Not so when fire has swept over, 
and has destroyed the pristine races of trees ; then others spring up, 
which were either not at all there, or in the minority.
So, where Fi- 
nns ponderosa is removed by fire, Abies rubra will fill that place to 
suffocation ; if, after a few years it is burnt again, another tree takes 
the place." In Britain we have few opportunities for observing the 
effect of burning off arborescent species ; but the natural covering of 
ericaceous shrubs is repeatedly burnt off the Highland mountains, and 
there the bared ground is soon re-occupied by the very same species; 
seedlings of Calluna vulgaris, &c., springing up plentifully among the 
fresh shoots from many undestroyed old roots.
Frequently repeated 
burnings will effect a gradual change from Ericaceae to Cyperaceae 
and Gramineae, when aided by the presence of sheep ; for explaining 
which there are obvious mechanical and chemical conditions.
It is 
more difficult to say why, where one species of pine has been destroy- 
ed by fire, another and different species shall forthwith occupy its 
room, though a careful observer of Nature would probably detect the 
true cause of this, if on the spot to seek for it.

Correction of a mistake in Mr. Lawson^s " Stray Thoughts^^ in the 
January No. of the 'â–  Phyioloyist.'' By Hewett C.
Watson, Esq.
If Mr. Lawson will again refer to the remark of mine in the January 
number of the ' Phy tologst,' which he has written against on page 417, 
he will find that he has misconceived the meaning of the sentence.
I remarked that something useful might be gleaned from the " poorest 
contributions among the rambles and visits ;" but I did not say that 
the rambles and visits are the poorest contributions to the ^Phytolo- 
gist.' There are valuable contributions to British Botany among that 
class of papers, though some of them are very trifling.
The remark 
having been misread, Mr. Lawson's strictures upon it fall for want of 
basis.

On the identity of Nephrodium faenisecii, var.
alatum, of Madeira, 
with Lastnea recurva of Britain.
By Edward Newman.
The Nephrodium fcenisecii of Mr. Lowe, like the Polypodium cris- 
tatum of Linnaeus, the Aspidium dilatatum of Smith and the Aspidium 
spinulosum of Hooker, comprises that little group of species belong- 
ing to the genus Lastraea, the ultimate divisions of whose pinnge are 
aristate or spinulose.
It is, in fact, the Madeira representative of this 
little group.
I will not here anticipate the conclusions of a paper 
long since written but still unpublished, on the exact nature of simi- 
larities existing between plants of distant countries, but merely say 
that little group in question has been called cristatum in Sweden, di- 
latatum or spinulosum in Britain and fcenisecii in Madeira : it abounds 
in other parts of the world, particularly North America, where it still 
remains to be divided, the various names at present in use applying 
equally to all the species.
Mr. Lowe has, however, done more than Linneus or Smith (neither 
of whom indicate the existence of other species, by the mention of va- 
rieties) ; for he expressly describes two varieties under the names of 
a. alatum and &.
productum, and I am indebted to Mr. Watson for 
calling my attention to the fact that the variety alatum possesses all 
the characters of our British Lastraea recurva ; and a sight of Mr.
Watson's specimens, which he has most kindly placed before me, has 
fully convinced me of the correctness of his views.
It is, however, a 
fact worthy of remark, that Mr. Lowe has not made the slightest allu- 
sion to either of the three characters which immediately distinguish 
recurva from any other aristate Lastraea, although these characters are 
possessed by the Madeira specimens in a very pronounced matter : I 
allude to the minute, sessile, grain-like glands scattered over both sur- 
faces of the frond : the jagged, eglandulose involucre : and the long, 
slender and laciniated scales of the stipes.
Mr. Lowe's description 
is principally confined to the figure and cutting of the frond, charac- 
ters which till lately obtained the exclusive attention of our botanists.
The var.
B. productum is less distinctly marked, and may be sup- 
posed to contain the remainder of the aristate group.
Among the 
specimens thus named, Lastraea multiflora occurs in a very pronounced 
state.
Mr. Lowe's descriptions are published in the fourth volume of the 
* Cambridge Philosophical Transactions,' at page 7, and were read 
in 1830.
They are reprinted verbatim below.

utroque tamen statu saltem sub-tripinnata, et longe frequentius, sc.
in 
a, statu normali, sub-g'ac^ripinnata.
Hebc omnia, cum aliis characte- 
ribus supra indicatis, nullibus exemplaribus stabilita sunt ; et in 
planta a, adeo per totam insulam pervulgata, constantia, nee in tanta 
differentia loci coelique (fi enim potius monstrosa) variantia inveni.
We now arrive at the question of nomenclature.
We find that the 
species recurva has been previously described by Mr. Lowe as a por- 
tion of his foenisecii : not " lumped in " without judgment or conside- 
tion, but carefully and advisedly included, and not only thus, but the 
author, evidently struck with its remarkable habit, has separated it 
511 
from the less marked forms and given it a name as a variety, and I 
presume from the text, he considers it the most marked or typical va- 
riety.
We have thus two names positively identified with the plant 
now under consideration.
The first of these, foenisecii, is assigned 
to this species in common with others as a specific name, the second, 
alatum, is given it as that of a variety, and applies exclusively to this 
one species.
The name foenisecii having been given to a group of species, and 
that group being the Madeira representative of cristatum or dilatatum, 
is objectionable on two grounds: in the first place it yields in priority 
to dilatatum, as this again to cristatum : in the second place, the name 
being applied to a group of species rather than to a single species, 
the choice of fixing it on either of the included species is a privilege, 
the exercise of which leads to inextricable confusion.
In proof of 
this the reader is referred to Mr. Babington's ingenious but unsuccess- 
ful attempt to apply the names spinulosum and dilatatum, as an unan- 
swerable proof that both those synonymous appellations should be 
discontinued, since it seems impossible to fix to w^hich species either 
of them properly belongs.
I would therefore suggest that the name 
foenisecii, like its prototypes, should be altogether suppressed.
A remarkable instance of the impropriety of converting a patrony- 
mic into a specific appellation occurs in entomology.
Linneus de- 
signated by the specific name Puella, that large genus of dragonflies 
which now forms the genus Agrion.
The name Puella is consequent- 
ly equally applicable to either species provided it be an inhabitant of 
Sweden, and no entomologist knows how to restrict it.
Having thus attempted to dispose of the name foenisecii, I have to 
consider the claim of the second name, alatum.
This was advisedly 
and most properly restricted to one species, and that species posses- 
sing all the distinguishing characters of our recurva.
It is, I think, a 
departure from the general practice, to give any leading or typical 
form a name distinct from that of the species.
The usage is this : 
Salix fusca, var.
/3.
repens, var.
y. prostrata, &c., &c.
: var.
a., if it be 
not paradoxical to call the typical form a variety, is supposed to bear 
the name of Salix fusca without any addition.
In the present in- 
stance, however, Mr. Lowe has taken especial care that his plant â€” for 
I doubt not that his description enjoys a priority of several years â€” 
shall bear a name ; and yet with equal care has he provided that 
that name shall only be applied as to a variety : he purposely and ad- 
visedly mixes up two plants (in my opinion many, but avowedly, pur- 
posely and advisedly ttvo) ; and with elaborate care, with singular 
512 
ingenuity, so constructs his description that it shall apply to both.
When an author has thus taken great pains to show that his plant, al- 
though named, is only a variety, when he has been at the trouble of 
placing a specific name over it as if the more to enforce its restriction 
to the variety, surely the name of that variety cannot, by any law of 
botanical usage, be introduced to supersede a name accompanied by a 
specific description, and applied without doubt or hesitation to the 
same plant as a distinct species.
I may perhaps be allowed, before concluding this brief paper, to 
confess that the result of this inquiry has not been such as I antici- 
pated ; for fi"om the moment Mr. Watson announced to me his disco- 
very of the identity of the British and Madeira plants, I concluded to 
give up the name of recurva, since its adoption seemed rather annoy- 
ing to some of my friends who had advocated a change.
A candid 
investigation of the matter has been attended with a different result, 
and the present, like every other inquiry into the propriety of retain- 
ing the name recurva, seems to issue in establishing that name more 
firmly than before.

Botanical Ramble in Ireland.
By Charles Carter, Esq.
I VENTURE to give you a slight outline of a ramble through a part 
of Clare in July last.
Business conducting me at stated times 
throughout the year, to the west of Ireland, and having occasionally 
many days of leisure, I thought I could not devote them to a better 
purpose than to the study of Nature.
To such pursuits 1 have been 
led by the delightful excursions recorded in your excellent journal, 
by Professor Balfour to Ailsa Craig and the Mull of Cantyre, and by 
Mr. Keddie to the Bass Rock, but above all by that of Mr. Ogilby in my 
own localities, picturing so vividly and so poetically, beauties that 
many minds are wholly insensible to.
His is the spirit of a true na- 
turalist.
I hate your dry pedantic lore â€” your freezing descriptions of 
Nature's works : very few are the converts to science made by such !
In September last, being with some friends in the neighbourhood 
of Clifden, I had heard of Mr. Ogilby, as an accomplished naturalist 
and botanist, being there.
He had discovered another station for the 
513 
beautiful Erica Mackaii, a heath admired by all, but which that gen- 
tleman (who originally found it) I am informed now considers to be a 
mere form of the more common species ; and his views are concurred 
in by his friend, the Professor of Botany in the Royal Dublin Society, 
one of the first indigenous botanists in Ireland.
About the 10th of July I walked from Oranmore to Kilcolgan, by a' 
road which bounds the eastern end of Galway-bay, but not presenting 
much of interest.
Proceeding to Ardrahan, the scenery becomes fine, 
and the limestone soil affords much for the inquiring botanist.
Near 
Kiltarton I was delighted with masses of the lovely Gentiana verna â€” 
the most beautiful of all our Gentians.
It was in full bloom â€” 
" Blue â€” blue â€” as if the sky let fall 
A flower from its own cserulean wall." 
Here also I met with Carduus nutans, Asperula Cynanchica and odo- 
rata, Chlora perfoliata, Gentiana campestris and Amarella, and a host 
of Galiums of all forms and sizes.
In the romantic lake Teeneran 
grew Butomus umbellatus, and the rocks around were covered with 
Lonicera and Hypericum Androsaemum.
Resting at Gort, 1 next day 
took the car which daily runs, during the summer, to New Quay, a 
sweet and retired bathing-place, about nine miles across the bay from 
Galway.
Here the limestone shows itself in sterile grandeur around, 
being barren in the extreme.
From New Quay I walked a distance 
of five miles round the creek to Ballyvaughan, a wretched little vil- 
lage.
Such fare, and such a bed for a poor weary naturalist, who is 
only enlivened by a far too intimate acquaintance with hosts of the 
order Siphonaptera.
Getting clear at daylight of these loving friends, I trudged up a 
long and weary ascent to the top of Beal-na-thulloch, and then what 
dreariness is seen around I Towards Block-bead were piles upon 
piles of large lime-stone blocks, and mass upon mass extended until 
lost in the thick mist that covered the headland.
Beyond the hill I saw the mountain avens {Dri/as octopetala) abun- 
dantly in flower, the rock bramble with its bright red berries, and a 
few plants of Cistopteris and Grammitis Ceterach, with frequent tufts 
of Saxifi-aga hypnoides: â€” a wretched tract, however, for the botanist.
In the evening I reached Ennistymon, a delightfully situated little 
village about two miles from the bathing place of Lahinch, and but 
four from the famous cliffs of Mohir.
I never saw such specimens of 
Erica cinerea as grew around the rocky hills of the village.
I have 
seen plants three feet in height, with corollas almost as large as in 
514 
Menzesia.
The sand-hills of Lahinch are covered with Asperula Cy- 
nanchica and Viola lutea, and numbers of plants peculiar to the sand 
hills of the west, amongst which I plentifully gathered Polygonum 
maritimum.
From thence I journeyed by the coast to Miltown, pass- 
ing by the cliffs near Spanish-point, where grows abundantly sam- 
phire, Aster Tripolium of a large size, Lavatera arborea, and many of 
the beautiful Orchis tribe.
My time being limited, I pursued my way from the hotel at Mil- 
town Malbay, across the wild and exposed beach of Cassina, where 
enormous blocks of rock, of many tons weight, have been rolled up 
by the furious surges of the Atlantic.
I turned up the deep defile, 
through which the little river Anna falls into the ocean â€” a river famed 
for its delicious white trout and fine salmon : its steep banks on either 
side were covered with a brushwood of Salix caprea, the hazle, Prunus 
spinosa, and a variety of Rubi.
Opposite the romantically situated 
mill was the salmon-leap, w'here many a fine fish has been gaffed: the 
leap is over-shadowed by magnificent trees of Salix pentandra.
Crossing the bogs en route to Kilrush, I visited several of the nu- 
merous lakes that are spread over the great bog of Mon Mor : here I 
was rejoiced to meet in profusion the white water-lily {Nymphaa al- 
ba) and Nuphar lutea, called in Irish, Billeog bhaithe buidhe â€” the 
yellow drowning leaf.
I explored several turloughs, but could no- 
where see Po ten till a fruticosa.
But what gave me the greatest delight was the discovery, in several 
pools in the bog, of Eriocaulon septangulare, which Mr. Mackay, in 
his admirable 'Flora Hibernica,' says is confined to Connemara; and 
with it, in a small lake, grew a species of Elatine, Alisma natans and 
Lobelia Dortmanna.
Rhynchospora alba, a variety of Carices, the 
three species of Drosera, Scutellaria minor and Radiola Millegrana, 
were abundant in the bogs around, and the drains were filled with 
Utricularia minor and vulgaris.
The luxuriance and beauty of Erica 
Tetralix were rich in the extreme ; and had I not seen in my own 
county, the magnificence of Menziesia, and the delicate beauty of the 
compact and profusely flowering Mackaii, I should indeed have con- 
sidered it surpassing.
My stay in Kilrush was but short, the steamer starting with the 
early morning tide for Limerick.

On the occurrence of Ranunculus Lenormandi at Godalming.
By Henry Bull, Esq.
The Ranunculus Lenormandi of Schultz, the R.
hederaceus, &.
grandijlorus of Babington, or the R.
hederaceus, (3.
partitus of the 
' London Catalogue,' by whichsoever name it is hereafter to be distin- 
guished, is much more plentiful in this neighbourhood than the typi- 
cal form of R.
hederaceus, occurring on the margins of ponds and in 
ditches on the commons, and pending the inquiry, whether it is to 
rank as a species or is to be considered as merely a variety of R.
he- 
deraceus, I should feel pleasure in supplying specimens, as far as 
my stock will allow, to any reader of the 'Phytologist' who may think 
it worth while to write for them, 
I do not observe, in any of the plants that I have examined, that 
the leaves of R.
Lenormandi are variegated with the markings of dark- 
er green or brown, which are seen extending into each lobe of the 
leaf in R.
hederaceus.
The different form of the carpels in the two 
plants is very apparent, but the relatively more or less adnate state of 
the stipules I do not find to be so distinct.

On the occurrence of Primula elatior (J acq.), at Halstead, Essex.
By Thomas Bentall, Esq.
T HAVE much pleasure in recording the occurrence of Primula ela- 
tior (Jacq.J, at Halstead, having recently met with it in small quan- 
tity in a damp meadow at this place.
In this locality it is accompanied by a profiision of P.
vulgaris, and 
where the two plants are growing intermixed I have observed speci- 
mens which I have no hesitation in pronouncing to be hybrids be- 
tween them.
The circumstance altogether has a little surprised me, 
knowing that most of the stations where P.
elatior occurs, are charac- 
terized by the entire absence of P.
vulgaris, and although the former 
is frequently accompanied by P.
veris, I have never seen or heard of 
an example of hybridity between them.
It is well known that P.
vulgaris will form hybrids with P.
veris 
when they grow intermixed ; in fact, the peasantry in this part of the 
516 
country not unfrequently resort to the practice of planting " paigles " 
and "primroses" together in their gardens in order to obtain these 
hybrid " oxlips," which they always cherish as objects of great curi- 
osity from the novel way in which they go to work to procure them.
I may just add, that there can be no doubt as to the Halstead plant 
being the true P.
elatior.
It is perfectly identical with authentic spe- 
cimens from Bardfield and elsewhere, now growing in my garden ; 
indeed, the plant is altogether so distinct in appearance from the hy- 
brids between P.
vulgaris and veris that they are not easily to be 
confounded.

Scirpus (Isolepis) Savii known and distinguished as a Species by 
our older English Botanists.
By W.
A. Bromfield, M.D., 
RL.S.
That this plant, supposed to be a modem, and indeed, rather re- 
cent addition to the British Flora, was known to and well distinguish- 
ed by at least a couple of our earlier botanical writers, is, I apprehend, 
clearly established on the testimony of Merrett and Parkinson.
The 
latter, in the 'Theatrura Botanicum' gives us, at p.
1270, No. 9, a 
tolerably accurate figure, and on the next page a very fair, though 
brief description of S.
Savii, under the rather cumbrous title of Gra- 
men junceum maritimum exile Plimostii, or " small sea rush grasse of 
Plimmouth." He adds, " This was found as well at Plimmouth as Do- 
ver in their wet grounds." To this Merrett correctly refers at p.
55, of 
his ' Pinax,' a plant which he found " plentiftil where a small dril is- 
sueth out betwixt the rocks, near the south east point of the Isle of 
Wight." This station accords with one of the most prolific of the 
localities for S.
Savii in the island at the present day, namely, on the 
wet, springy, slipped land under the cliff at Shanklin, where it will 
be found in great abundance, particularly a little to the northward of 
the Chine, beyond the baths, growing in dense, caespitose tufts, often 
above a foot in diameter, spreading or radiating in a circular form.
Parkinson's figure represents the variety /3.
monostachys, the only one 
found with us here, where it is extremely common in wet, boggy 
places, especially along the coast, somewhat rarer in plashy spots on 
heaths, and in woods, &c., inland.
Fig. 10 of the same page is evi- 
dently that of S.
setaceus, as appears also by the description, in which 
517 
the comparatively fewer stems and larger and more compound (or, as 
he calls it "prickly") heads are quite discriminative of that species, by 
far the rarer of the two in this island.

Notes on the wild Currants of the Isle of Wight.
By W.
A. Bromfield, M.D., F.L.S.
From those standard works on British Botany, the Floras of Smith 
and Hooker, it would seem that the red currant and its varieties are 
to be found truly wild only in the north of England and in Scotland, 
at least, if not so asserted in direct terms, it is by implication to 
be inferred that the same plant is to be met with in a merely natural- 
ized state south of the Tees, or including its now acknowledged va- 
rieties, R.
petrsBum and R.
spicatum, not nearer to us than Yorkshire.
Even those accurate and scrutinizing botanists, Mr. Babington and 
Mr. H.
C. Watson, who take little or nothing for granted or without 
inquiry, seem to participate in the same opinion with the eminent au- 
thors before mentioned; Mr. Watson affixing to all the stations for R, 
rubrum in his Guide south of Yorkshire, the usual mark, either indi- 
cative of doubt or of positive certainty that it has been introduced in- 
to the respective localities by other than natural agency, whilst Mr.
Babington says simply " woods in mountainous districts," v/hich must 
of course be held to exclude all but the northern parts of England 
and Wales.
That this opinion is erroneous, I have for many years 
past been convinced by finding the red currant in situations near 
Hastings, where it had perfectly the aspect of a genuine native, and 
since then have been the more confirmed in the truth of this view of 
the matter, by observing it in this island, over which it is very gene- 
rally distributed, occurring frequently, and often most abundantly, 
not only in our hedge-rows and thickets of the enclosed country, but 
in the remotest recesses of all our hilly woods or deep boggy coppices, 
flourishing indifferently at the sea level and in the wettest soil, or at 
a few hundred feet of elevation, in ground comparatively firee from 
moisture, though always in tolerably shaded, cool situations.
It is, 
indeed, so common an Isle of Wight shrub, that there is scarcely a 
patch of copse or brushwood, however small, from which it is wholly

absent, and some of our larger woods produce specimens by hun- 
dreds.* 
I am not disposed to attach any importance to the usual mode 
of accounting for the dissemination 6f naturalized species by birds 
dropping the seeds, because I take that to be the means which Na- 
ture mainly relies on for the propagation of species unfurnished with 
such mechanical contrivances for the ready conveyance of their seeds 
abroad, as we see in the pappus of the Compositae, the dissilient cap- 
sules of many EuphorbiaceÂ®, the Oxalidaceae, balsams, &c.
She 
would avail herself of the like animal agency in the wilds of America 
or the virgin forests of Guiana, as in the well-peopled and cultivated 
fields of Europe.
It is the extent and power of occupancy which 
must guide us in determining the indigenous origin of species amongst 
us, coupled with a careful inquiry into their geographical distribution 
elsewhere,!
which last will often clear up doubts and overcome our 
scruples when nothing else would arise to do so.
Unless it can be shown that a species did not formerly exist where 
it now grows in abundance, such hypothetical appeal to the fowls of 
the air will not advance us a step nearer to a settlement of the point 
at issue.
But T have an additional reason, which I shall now state, 
for believing the red currant to be truly indigenous to this and other 
of our southern counties of England.
* I may mention in particular, the beautiful sloping woods about Swainston, and 
various flat, wet coppices in the parish of Freshwater, some of which are full of red 
currant plants, for the most part small, single shrubs, a foot or two in height, occa- 
sionally branched, and even somewhat bushy, but of a lax, straggling habit, quite dif- 
ferent from the garden red currant.
f Till a greater number of our botanists devote some share of attention to this 
most important and interesting department of their science, it is in vain to expect 
any agreement amongst them as to what plants are or are not indigenous to our is- 
land.
At present we seem to do little but copy the opinions of others without much 
inquiry, or pin our belief on some antiquated, obscure, or distorted passage of classi- 
cal authority.
The traditional reasons which have been advanced for rejecting the 
cherry, the beech and the hop from the catalogue of our aborigines, are known to most 
readers.
An excellent practical botanist gravely told me he thought it probable the 
holly was originally introduced into this country from Japan !
Loudon (Arbor.
Brit.) 
thought the elder not indigenous, and the Arbutus of the west of Ireland must have 
been planted, in the opinion of some, by the good monks of Mucruss, though it is evi- 
dent, from certain species that accompany it thither, that its occurrence is owing to a 
natural extension in a north-westerly direction, of a part of the Spanish and Portu- 
guese Floras to the mild and equable shores of that island.
Even the humble violet 
of our woods and groves has been robbed of the rights of a true born Briton, and boldly 
declared an alien in a catalogue lately published by botanists of undoubted ability.
519 
I have long remarked that in every individual specimen of the wild 
currant seen in flower, the blossoms were invariably more or less 
streaked, dotted or suffused with a purplish brown or russet red co- 
lour, and remarkably so on the perigynous glandular disk of the ca- 
lyx, from which that tinge is never entirely absent, whereas in the 
garden red currant the flowers are of an uniform pale green, without 
any such mixture of red.
Some other differences between them will 
be noticed presently.
Our Vectian, and I think also the Sussex plant, 
is, in fact, the R.
rubrum, /3.
sylvestre of Mertens and Koch,* whilst 
the figure in ' English Botany ' represents that form which we find in 
cultivation, but which I have never seen wild, or even naturalized 
here.
I am far from believing that the two are anything more than 
varieties of the same species, and that but slight ones ; nevertheless, 
where a marked difference is uniformly stamped on the aspect of the 
one which is not found to be possessed by the other, good grounds 
are afforded for supposing them to be derived, in distinct collateral 
lines, from some common but remote ancestor.
I shall now proceed to state the differences observable betwixt the 
wild, or as it may be called, the primary f form of R.
rubrum, and the 
state of the species as exhibited in cultivation, or the garden form of 
the plant, premising that I do not wish to lay much stress upon cha- 
ractei'S taken from cultivated examples of a species, although, as the 
same characters, with some trifling variations have been remarked by 
many and distantly situated observers, it is fair to assume the existence 
of two tolerably definite races; one, of a type unknown in cultivation, 
and hence aboriginal with us, which is the point sought to be esta- 
blished.

hairiness on the racemes, well marked in some of my specimens which 
are quite villous in this part.
The dark colour of the disk, and above 
all, the extreme shortness and peculiar form of the stamens, appear 
the most permanent marks of distinction.
The narrow anthers and 
elongated filaments are clearly expressed in the E.

have little doubt that our wild southern variety is identical with the 
"E,.
fructu parvo" of Merrett and Ray's Synopsis, found at Wimbledon 
and in Lancashire.
These two forms of the red currant are widely dispersed over the 
greater part of central and northern Europe, and in America, ranging 
beyond the arctic circle in both hemispheres.
The Swedish and 
Lapland plant would seem to belong to our first variety.
The flowering time of our wild currant seems to precede that of the 
garden type, contrary to what we should expect, since the former 
was, for the most part, in full bloom in its cool, damp, native situa^ 
tions for some days previous to the date of these remarks (April 11th), 
whilst the flowers of the latter are as yet but very partially expand- 
ed in gardens open to the sun.
This may, in some measure, account 
for the discrepancy in time assigned by different authors to the blow- 
ing of the red currant, some giving April, others May, as the blos- 
soming season.
In this island all the British species are out of 
521 
bloom in May in ordinary years, excepting R.
nigrum, which extends 
a little into that month.* 
In conclusion, I may state that I regard both R.
nigrum and R.
grossularia as being genuine natives of the Isle of Wight.
The for- 
mer, though rare, is found in several of our deep, boggy woods, which 
produce some other northern species abundantly, as Epilobium an- 
gustifolium (the long-podded, ciisped-leaved form, with small, deep- 
coloured flowers, a common Hampshire and Sussex plant), Ruhus 
Id<eus (raspberry), Viola palustris, Myrica Gale, Equisetum sylvati- 
cum, &c., and in rotten, swampy thickets, where the soil and atmo- 
sphere are still more cold and humid than that in which the red 
currant delights ; whilst R.
grossularia occurs frequently but spora- 
dically everywhere, both in the open and woodland, high and low 
districts, in the clefts of rocky dells and the deepest recesses of our 
remaining ancient forest ground.

With upwards of Jive hundred 
illustrations.
Of this most voluminous volume it has been remarked by a cotem- 
poraiy of high authority, " it is not too much to say that none more 
important to the student of Botany has ever appeared, for to the pro- 
* The flowering season of plants, as given in our ordinary and popular Floras, re- 
quires careful revision, being lamentably incorrect in numberless instances.
The pe- 
riods assigned are for the most part too limited or contracted, as an example of which 
I shall adduce Pulmonaria angustifolia, which is said to flower in May and June.
Now on the cold, stiflf clay about Ryde, where the species abounds, it is always in 
flower by the middle of March, and sometimes at the close of February ; it is in high- 
est perfection of bloom by the middle of April; in May half the plants are out of 
blow, and any one who should visit its localities in June, with a view of obtaining 
good flowering specimens, would experience some difficulty in finding one in the con- 
dition required.
So again, Cyperus longus flowers in August and September, or even 
till later, not in July, as the books inform us.
The continental writers are more ex- 
act than ourselves in this point, so important to the young or inexperienced collector, 
who is always prone to go by the letter, and to suppose naturally that when June is 
given as the flowering season for a species it would be in vain to seek it in May or 
July.
Mr. Babington, in his excellent Manual, has done much towards correcting 
these inaccuracies of his predecessors.
522 
ficient in that branch of study, it contains an immense mass of useful 
information." Eulogistic as is this opinion, it is yet scarcely more than 
a just tribute to the value of the work, or to the acquirements and re- 
searches of the author.
There is no volume in the English language, 
relating to any department of Botany, which can be set on a level 
with ' The Vegetable Kingdom ;' the vast amount of solid information 
comprised in the volume, and (considering the quantity) the prevail- 
ing accuracy and completeness of the details, are quite unrivalled.
It recalls to mind at once the more remarkable qualities which sepa- 
rately characterize the works of a Loudon and a Brown.
There are 
here the comprehensiveness and condensation of detail which give 
value to some of Loudon's large compilations, united with the philo- 
sophical spirit of combination resulting from accurate analysis, and 
the suggestive originality of a Robert Brown.
In thus warmly expressing a sense of the value of the work before 
us, we refer to its general character as a whole, and with an eye to 
the intellectual exertion necessarily implied in its production.
Doubt- 
less there is much within the 970 closely printed pages, to which 
plausible and reasonable objections might be set forth.
And in so 
great an undertaking small errors and deficiencies are unavoidable.
But it would be a paltry spirit of injustice or jealousy that could urge 
any one to pick and cull out little things of this kind, which are so 
completely overshadowed and lost in the practical utility and sterling 
value of such a work, executed so well.
We have tested the volume, 
here and there, by looking for matters, such as recently published 
genera, &c., which appeared likely to have escaped the glance of any 
hurried searcher or careless compiler, and we have mostly found them 
not overlooked by the author of ' The Vegetable Kingdom.' As an 
inference, fairly drawn from the test, we seem entitled to pronounce 
the work highly complete and accurate.
The numerous, and generally well-drawn cuts, the many remarks 
on structure and affinities, with the valuable notices concerning the 
economical and medicinal uses of the plants, add greatly to the at- 
tractiveness of the volume, rendering it altogether the kind of book 
for a botanist to keep within easy reach of his hands, that it may be 
taken up and opened, whether for instruction or amusement, at inter- 
vals of waiting or unoccupied time ; and this over and above its in- 
dispensable presence as a dictionary of reference and consultation.
Looking to the quantity and quality of its contents, the volume is re- 
markably cheap in price.
Among the most debateable portions of the plan and contents, may 
523 
be mentioned the sometimes rather peculiar grouping of the orders 
into alliances, and the choice or fonnation of English names for the 
orders.
And not a small practical objection might be raised against 
the author's wide changes in the series, or relative position of the or- 
ders and alliances.
As an example of the peculiar grouping into alliances, we may cite 
the disseverance of FumariacesB and Papaveraceae into different al- 
liances ; the former being combined with Vitaceae, &c.
and the latter 
with Ranunculaceae, &c.
The union of Silenaceae and Polygonaceae 
under the same single alliance, seems equally forced at first view ; 
though it may be that familiarity will gradually reconcile botanists to 
these seeming incongruities, after a little restiveness at first.
On 
placing Polygonum Convolvulus by the side of Silene acaulis, for in- 
stance, it appears more easy to find distinctions than affinities ; but 
the outrageous non-resemblance is a good deal softened down, when 
Polygonum aviculare stands by Arenaria rubra ; and closer resem- 
blances might be found in other plants less familiar to British 
botanists.
On the whole, one of our greatest objections to be urged against 
Dr. Lindley's systematic methods, is that relating to the changed se- 
ries or relative positions of the orders.
It is on the ground of practi- 
cal inconvenience, however, more than upon scientific views or 
supposed affinities, that such changes are objected to.
Herbaria ar- 
ranged in accordance with the ordinal and generic series of one 
author, are not much better than a chaotic medley when they require 
to be referred to or consulted in connexion with the writings of other 
systematists.
And with the works of Dr. Lindley before us, we need 
not advert to the varied arrangements of different authors merely, but 
even to the varying arrangements of different editions from the pen of 
the same author.
With the complete ' Vegetable Kingdom ' at hand, there would be 
found considerable advantage in the arrangement of orders and genera 
in correspondence with the series and lists set forth in that volume.
But, on the other side, such an arrangement would render a working 
herbarium highly inconvenient with reference to the Prodromus of De 
Candolle, or to the Repertorium of Walpers ; to which, as works on 
species, there is a great practical convenience in adapting the se- 
quence of orders and genera in herbaria.
This ever-recurring c^is-correspondence between the arrangements 
of different authors, and of the same authors at different dates, implies 
some radical fault of method.
No doubt it may be partly attributed 
524 
to a progressive advance in knowledge of Nature, and to the conse- 
quent change or expansion of mental ideas.
But more than this 
single circumstance must be called in, to account for the very remark- 
able changes in the grouping and relative position of orders, by the 
same botanist, after short intervals of time.
It is believed that the 
following passage from the pen of another systematist, points pretty 
clearly to the true reason of such discrepancies : â€” 
" In a work on Astronomy, if the theory be not Newtonian it is no- 
thing ; but when a systematic work on Zoology makes its appearance, 
we immediately inquire ' what is the arrangement ?' We compare 
its merits with those of other arrangements, and so unusual a thing is 
it for an author to adopt the theory proposed by a prior author, that 
such a proceeding would be held a matter of literary piracy : and 
should both authors have their works in the same market, this pirating 
an arrangement would be considered ample ground for an action at 
law.
Thus it appears we all tacitly acknowledge that arrangement, 
so far as yet earned, is the result of human wisdom, judgment and in- 
ventive faculty, and neither has, nor is supposed to have, any refe- 
rence to the designs of an omnipotent Creator.
Those, therefore, who 
have looked on me with perhaps rather a jealous eye, as a competitor 
for reputation in the same field â€” the just classification of natural ob- 
jects â€” have given themselves needless anxiety from a mistaken idea 
of my views : our objects are not the same; our labours do not and 
cannot clash : their desire is, by the application of human knowledge, 
and human skill, and human industry to build up a system that shall 
be permanent; mine to discover one already built, â€” a system in 
which human knowledge, skill and industry have had no part, â€” a sys- 
tem, in fine, whose Founder and Builder is the Almighty." â€” (New- 
man's ' System of Nature,' pp.
1, 2).
The fact seems to be, that the method of Dr. Lindley is also to 
" build up a system," and not " to discover one already built." But 
as he proceeds upon a large amount of acquired knowledge, which is 
considered, compared and arranged by a mind of superior order, the 
author of 'The Vegetable Kingdom' does put forth a system with a 
very natural look about great part of it : that is to say, plants are 
well brought into proximity, according to their degrees of resemblance 
in the main.
Still, there are too many things, even here, which ap- 
pear to have been bundled together simply because the author knew 
not what else to do with them ; their natural repulsion, by points of 
dissimilaiity, being only overcome in a book through the pressure 
firom without â€” the external force of the master's ^^ sic jubeo.'''' 
525 
As an individual opinion, however, we hold that there is no system 
of Nature at all, in the sense of separate and distinct groups, whether 
they are to be called alliances, or orders, or genera.
We conceive it 
quite as natural to classify temperatures into tens, twenties, thirties, 
&c., or into temperatures melting ice, temperatures melting wax, tem- 
peratures melting metals, &c., as to classify the objects of organic 
Nature into orders and genera.
The gradations of structure slide 
into each other ; and draw the lines of separation where we will, the 
objects on the two sides of the same dividing line, will be more alike 
^an are the objects on the contrary margins of the space between 
two lines.
It matters not whether we take a linear series, or circles, 
or rays from a centre ; wherever we throw many objects into groups, 
we cut through links of connexion, by which some of them are inti- 
mately connected with others to be left out of their own group.
To 
revert to our former example of the Fumariaceag, we find Hypecoum 
placed in the Berberal alliance, and Chelidonium placed in the Ranal 
alliance ; yet surely no botanist could hesitate to say that Hypecoum 
is much more like unto a Chelidonium than unto a Vitis or Berberis !
We alluded also to another debateable matter in the Englished 
names of orders.
An authority before referred to, objects very decid- 
edly to this part of ' The Vegetable Kingdom,' pronouncing the terms 
Orchids, Hippurids, Typhads and Arads "intolerable" to his ears, 
and conceiving that " no educated person will prefer the use of these 
terms." Some of the terms are rather harsh-sounding, it must be al- 
lowed ; yet to our ears there is nothing intolerable in them, and some 
of them even sound better than the Latinized terms themselves ; more 
particularly so when used in the singular number.
An Orchid sounds 
equally well, and is more conveniently uttered than an Orchidacea ; 
a Cucurbit sounds quite as euphoniously as a Cucurhitacea.
The 
reviewer appeals to educated persons.
We believe the appeal ought 
to be to those educated persons who are not familiar with Latin ; for 
there is a prejudice of education, which may reconcile us to sounds 
that in themselves are less euphonious, though more familiar.
We 
will acknowledge ourselves wrong, when the ears of educated ladies, 
little used to the Latinized terminations, have decided against Dr.
liindley's innovations.
In short, we prefer most of them, for writing 
or speaking, in the English language.
Our own objection lies rather 
against the partiality of their use.
Though Celastrads cannot be 
called one of the sweet sounds, it should be preferred before Spindle- 
trees, which is substituting a generic in place of an ordinal name, and 
thus confusing grades of classification.
Or, should Celastrads be 
Vol. II.
3 t 
526 
deemed too " intolerable," why not say Spindleworts, on the same 
principle implied in translating Aquifoliacece into Hollyworts ?
Under each order the author gives a list of its genera, with syno- 
nyms, and an estimate of the number of its species.
Adding thereto 
the alliances and orders, we get the following general summary of

6722 genera and 78005 species, exclusive of the "Flowerless Plants," 
so that Dr. Lindley reduces the species, but greatly increases the ge- 
nera, unless some misprint occurs which we have not yet detected.
Should the number of genera in Exogens be 8062 instead of 1 8062 ?

This is an unusually full number in its botanical department; the 
more important papers, as will be seen, being borrowed from the con- 
tinent.
Mr. Babington brings down his descriptions of Rubi to a 
527 
twenty-first species, with numerous varieties.
When the whole have 
been described w^e may take the liberty of copying out a list of the 
names ; but doubtless, the descriptions will be published again, as 
the 'Transactions of the Botanical Society of Edinburgh,' and be thus 
brought more conveniently within the reach of British botanists.
Whatever differences of opinion may be entertained respecting the 
limits of species, there can be no such diversity of view respecting the 
value of accurate descriptions and synonyms of the various forms in 
this ever-varying mass of species, subspecies, varieties, variations and 
" states ;" and there is no other British botanist so well fitted for effi- 
ciently accomplishing this task, as the individual into whose hands it 
has now been taken.
The descriptions are very long, averaging up- 
wards of a page to a species.
The following passage, from the paper of Mr. Thwaites, has an in- 
terest, at least, for Algologists : " On examining, a few days ago, 
some spores of Mesocarpus scalaris, Hassall, I thought I could detect 
in them indications of a quaternary division, and I sent specimens to 
Mr. Berkeley for his inspection, who wrote me in reply, that he could 
see the division into four pretty distinctly.
I have since observed the 
same peculiarity in the spores of Tyndaridea insignis, Hass., and 
Staurocarpus gracilis, Hass., and, as Mr. Berkeley remarks to me, it 
may prove more general than has hitherto been supposed.
The sepa- 
ration of the contents of the sporangium into four portions, does not 
take place in our three species until the fruit is nearly mature, and 
this soon afterwards becomes too opaque for the character to be seen, 
so that it can be observed only in a particular state of the plant.
The sporangium in all the species I have mentioned is more or less 
compressed vertically."

Correction of an inaccuracy in a Character assigned to the Primula 
elatior of Jacquin.
By Hewett C.
Watson, Esq.
A NOTABLE inaccuracy of expression occurs in the first volume of 
the * Phytologist,' page 1002, fourth line from the top, which must 
have puzzled any looker into Nature, who sought the peculiarity in 
the corolla, by which the Primula elatior was there stated to be dis- 
tinguishable from the P.
vulgaris and veris, and their varieties.
The 
passage runs thus : " In the cowslip and primrose, and all their varie- 
528 
ties, a circle of scale-like glands [?-ead folds] surrounds the orifice of 
the tube of the corolla.
These glands [read folds] are absent from 
the Primula elatior." How the printed word came to be substituted 
for the one which ought to have occupied its place, I cannot now di- 
vine ; but probably the note was copied for the press, and the wrong 
word written by mistake at the time of doing this.
If a primrose 
flower be torn into two halves, it will be seen that the corolla has a 
thickening or puffiness just at the angle where the horizontal limb 
passes to the vertical tube ; the inner surface of the corolla slightly 
contracting the orifice of the tube.
When looked at from above, in 
the entire corolla, these prominences appear like imperfect scales, 
which would make a valve to close the tube if more elongated.
The 
like peculiarity occurs both in the cowslip and primrose, although 
more obvious in the pin-eyed forms of the primrose.
In the Primula 
elatior the limb passes more gi'adually into the tube, which is widest 
at the orifice.
On looking at numerous examples of the three species, 
and the undistinguishable varieties of veris and vulgaris, I find that 
in some of them this character becomes comparatively inconspicuous, 
although clear enough in the majority.
I presume that the five seg- 
ments of circles round the tube of P.
vulgaris, in ' English Botany,' 
are designed to represent this peculiarity.
In the figure of P.
veris, 
they are (correctly) made bifid or emarginate, and thus appear as ten 
instead of five.
In the figure of P.
elatior, it will be seen, they are 
not introduced.

Experiments on preserving Potatoes, conducted in the Glasnevin 
Botanic Garden, with Remarks on Parasitical Fungi in 
general.
By David Moore, Esq.* 
In bringing forward this subject, so fully discussed already by men 
eminent for their scientific and practical acquirements, it is not to be 
expected that much additional information can now be afforded.
But 
when its national importance is considered, with the large share of 
public attention which it continues to engross, and particularly as we 
have now arrived at that period when the effects produced on the 
* Read at the evening Meeting of the Royal Dublin Society on the 14lh of April.
529 
potato crop of last year are fully known, and forebodings of the worst 
description rife, relative to the fate of the crop of the present season, 
I trust I need make no further apology for detailing the results of a 
series of experiments, conducted in the Botanic Garden during the 
past winter.
1st.
On preserving potatoes.
2nd.
On the prospect of potatoes partially diseased being fit to use 
for seed ; and, 
3rd.
Whether the fungus which has appeared so uniformly on dis- 
eased potatoes is capable of extending itself to sound tubers when 
brought into contact with it.
The experiments were commenced on the 29th of October last, and 
continued to the 1st of the present month, when the results which I 
now purpose detailing were observed to have taken place.
With a view of ascertaining what effect the drying process would 
produce, we selected four tubers partially diseased, and one sound, 
which were steeped an hour in water mixed with fresh lime, and then 
put into a large flower-pot, on the cool end of the flue of a stove, 
where the temperature ranged between 55Â° and 56Â° of Fahrenheit.
The diseased tubers soon collapsed, and produced fungi in the course 
of three weeks, after which they continued to dry up into a hardened 
mass.
The sound tuber remained quite fresh, and was not infected 
with the fungus, although the others were placed over and under it.
An equal number of tubers, in the same state, were subjected to si- 
milar treatment, after being dusted with fresh lime, which appeared 
to produce no different effect.
The diseased potatoes shrivelled up, 
and decayed quite as soon as those which were neither steeped nor 
dusted.
In these experiments, I would beg to observe, that the tubers were 
exposed to the light, and not covered with any kind of mould ; but 
duplicates of the several lots were treated in a similar manner, when 
covered with earth, which had only the effect of keeping them longer 
from shrivelling.
The diseased tubers decayed, and left the sound 
ones without being infected as before.
A large garden potful, about one half sound and the other half dis- 
eased, as they were dug out of the earth, afforded similar results.
We next tried them on the shelves of a seed-room, where they were 
circumstanced in some degree similar to being placed on lofts.
Four 
diseased and two sound tubers were put together,, after being steeped 
an hour in lime and water; two of the diseased dried up into a hard- 
ened mass, two partially so, but were putting out strong buds.
Those 
530 
originally sound remained quite perfect.
The same number unsteep- 
ed were similarly treated, but the diseased were not pushing forth 
buds when examined.
Along with these were duplicates covered with 
mould, which merely had the effect of keeping the potatoes longer 
fresh.
We next tried packing in the following drying materials, namely, 
powdered charcoal, turf-mould, and dry sand.
Six tubers, placed in 
charcoal, two sound, two slightly diseased, and two considerably dis- 
eased ; and after remaining five months covered up they appeared as 
follows : those much diseased, quite decayed ; those slightly diseased, 
apparently as sound as when put in, and pushing forth strong shoots; 
the sound still remained so, but had not pushed their buds so forward 
as the others.
The duplicates placed in sand and turf-mould exhi- 
bited similar results.
In a damp cellar, six potatoes, all diseased, were placed in dry sand, 
after being steeped an hour in lime and water, out of which four re- 
main nearly as they were when put up ; two have decayed into a pu- 
trid mass.
Out of a large potful, half sound, half diseased, as they 
were dug from the field, and placed in dry sand without steeping, a 
few have decayed into soft putrescence, without producing any bad 
effects on those which were sound, which remain strong and healthy.
I did not find that charcoal or bog- mould preserved them better than 
sand ; in each parcel, those that were much diseased when put up 
had decayed.
The next experiment I consider to be fraught with considerable 
interest.
It was first suggested, I believe, by Mr. Leland Croswaithe, 
one of the members of the Botanical Committee â€” to ascertain the ef- 
fect of cutting off the diseased parts before storing.
The tubers ope- 
rated on were those of the apple variety, and out of twenty which 
were considerably diseased, only two have decayed.
Ten were put 
up in dry sand and ten in turf-mould, after being steeped an hour in 
lime and water.
The two which decayed were covered with sand.
Those in the turf-mould continued sound.
The last experiment in preserving, was to leave every alternate drill 
undug in the open ground, after putting a sufficient quantity of mould 
over them to preserve them from frost ; and the results, in this in- 
stance, have been very remarkable.
The tubers, both sound and dis- 
eased, remain, to all appearance, precisely as they were last October.
The decay does not appear to have progressed, even in the partially 
diseased tubers ; the only change which has taken place is in the cu- 
ticle, which has become cracked, and presents fissures similar to 
531 
those which occur iu some sorts of apples.
Several of them were 
pushing forth strong buds when examined.
The probability of the crop of the present season being infected by 
planting partially diseased seed has now become the most important 
inquiry ; and with a view of obtaining some information on this point, 
a quantity of apple potatoes were selected, and divided into three 
classes â€” those that were apparently sound, a second portion slightly 
diseased, and a third more so.
Of the first class, four tubers were 
planted, one of them divided into two halves, which have produced 
apparently healthy plants.
An equal number of the second class 
produced three plants, two of which became sickly, when about eight 
inches over the surface, and were evidently decaying.
On examining 
the lower portion of the stems, they were found to be getting into a 
putrid state, close to the old tubers, but no fungi had appeared on the 
backs of the leaves ; the third plant remains apparently healthy, but 
weak.
None of the third class produced plants ; but, on examining 
the mould, a few small, misshapen young tubers were found to have 
been produced by one of the sets.
1 ought to state that the whole 
were steeped an hour in lime and water before being planted.
Dupli- 
cates were planted without being steeped, which gave nearly similar 
results.
I have, however, observed, within the last week, that the 
leaves of one of the plants raised from a diseased tuber, has become 
infected with the fungus, Botrytis infestans, the same species which 
was so general on the leaves of diseased potatoes last season.
Cup potatoes were classed in the same manner, and two tubers of 
each planted.
The sound tubers have produced sound plants ; those 
partially diseased produced plants very weak, and out of the two that 
were most diseased, one produced a plant, the lower leaver of which 
have been affected with the fungus, and it is otherwise very weakly.
Two tubers, partially diseased, of the pink-eye variety, were plant- 
ed, after dividing one of them separating the rose from the root 
end, which produced two plants, one from the whole tuber, and one 
from the rose end of the cut tuber : they are both strong and coming 
into bloom.
A few of the tips of the lower leaves of one of the plants 
have shrivelled, on which the Botrytis has been observed.
The last experiment was made on three diseased tubers â€” one of 
each of the varieties of the potato I have already noticed.
They were 
cut in halves and allowed to dry on the flue, until the cuts were heal- 
ed over before being planted, but none of them have produced plants.
To ascertain whether the fungus, w^hich has prevailed so generally 
on rotting potatoes, infected sound tubers when a few only were put 
532 
together, large pots were filled with potatoes, some sound and others 
in various stages of disease.
The pots were placed together in dry 
and moist situations, when the diseased tubers soon decayed into a 
soft putrid state, without, in any instance, infecting those that were 
sound, although in close contact with them.
Such were the experiments I considered advisable to conduct, with 
their results ; and, although made on a small scale, the inferences de- 
ducible from them are not devoid of interest to the practical agricul- 
turist.
In the first place, it appears that diseased tubers, exposed to a dry, 
warm atmosphere, decayed much quicker than those subjected to any 
of the other modes of treatment.
Secondly, that diseased tubers placed on shelves in a cool room, 
but exposed to atmospheric changes, decayed sooner than their du- 
plicates which were in the same house, but covered with mould.
Thirdly, that diseased tubers placed in a dry cellar, where the tem- 
perature was low and uniform, kept much better than those which 
were in drier media.
Fourthly, that where the affected parts were cut off diseased tubers, 
and then steeped in lime and water, they have not decayed nearly so 
much as when left whole.
Fifthly, that potatoes left in the ground have not decayed further 
than they were last November.
Sixthly, that sound potatoes have kept as well as in ordinary sea- 
sons.
In reference to plants produced from different states of the tubers â€” 
1 .
Those that were much diseased decay quickly when placed un- 
der the influence of heat and moisture, and do not produce plants.
2. Those slightly diseased are liable to fail, and the plants pro- 
duced are weaker than those from healthy tubers; and, further, that 
they are liable to become afiected on the lower portion of the stem, 
and decay.
3. Sound tubers produce, apparently, sound plants.
4. Cup potatoes, though slightly diseased, are not so liable to fail 
as some others in the same state, though the produce of such is not so 
healthy nor strong as those of sound tubers.
5. Steeping in lime and water appears to have had very little effect.
Now I am inclined to infer from these facts, that the decay which 
has taken place among stored potatoes, has not been caused by the 
disease progressing, but rather from the effect it produced last au- 
tumn, and the manner in which they have been stored.
It is well 
533 
known, that large quantities of potatoes, heaped together, always pro- 
duce a slight heat which, as a matter of course, would be increased 
by the decaying material of the diseased tubers, to a degree, it is rea- 
sonable to suppose, that would prove injurious to the whole heap, es- 
pecially if many of them were effected.
Indeed, one instance is 
recorded by Professor Henslow of spontaneous combustion being 
nearly generated by a heap of decaying potatoes.
When the heaps 
have been attended to, and occasionally turned over, having the dis- 
eased tubers picked out, T believe they have kept as well as they 
usually do, without further trouble.
It is apparent that much of the success of this year's crop depends 
on selecting sound seed ; for, although diseased tubers vegetate and 
produce plants, they are mostly weak, and certainly liable to decay ; 
and very many of them will fail if used, because it is to be observed, 
that the conditions necessary for active vegetation are, precisely, those 
conducive to putrefaction, which may become too powerful for the 
vital force to resist, before the young shoot has increased sufficiently 
to be independent of the old tuber for support.
With reference to the decay which has already manifested itself 
this season, I am not prepared to offer a decided opinion as to whe- 
ther it is the result of last year's disease, or a modification of it : but 
in most of the cases which came under my observation, from 
plants raised in the Garden, as well as those sent to me from the 
country, the decay is clearly traceable to the old tuber.
It takes 
place on the lower portion of the stem, generally close to the tuber.
In some of the worst cases I could not observe that the Botrytis had 
been produced on the leaves, but in two instances it was very evident 
and agreed, in every way, with the specimens collected last season by 
the Rev. Mr.
Berkeley, and kindly communicated to me.
In such 
cases, however, had sound seed been used, it is probable that we 
should have had no appearance of disease.
This leads me to offer a few remarks on parasitical fungi which are 
destructive to agricultural plants.
Those who have attended to the 
subject must be aware that some of the most distinguished investiga- 
tors of the cause of the potato-disease, consider this minute mould, 
Botrytis infestans, to have been the immediate cause of the murrain 
of last year, and, no doubt, it has very generally accompanied it both 
in this country and on the continent.
Its appearance on diseased 
plants this season, is, therefore, the more remarkable.
I can, however, 
state with confidence, that two of the plants on which I have observed 
It, were diseased long prior to the appearance of the fungi on the 
Vol. II.
3 y 
534 
leaves ; consequently, if the mould were the cause, the spawn pro- 
ducuig it must have affected the plant at a very early stage of its 
growth, and proceeded from the root in place of the stem.
The Rev. Mr.
Berkeley has accompanied his interesting memoir on 
the potato-murrain with a beautiful series of microscopical drawings, 
showing how this mucedinous plant grows, extending its filamentous 
spawn under the cuticle of the leaf, and shooting up singly, or in fas- 
cicles, through the apertures of the stomates, thereby obstructing the 
admission of air, and the emission of perspiration, besides preventing 
the plants from elaborating nutritive sap in the leaves.
Although I still consider the mould only an accompaniment of the 
disease, I am well aware of the vast devastation such minute plants 
are capable of producing on the tissue of the larger vegetables.
The 
ravages of mildew, smut and bunt, are well known, and afford familiar 
instances.
The dry-rot â€” which was formerly such a dreadful pest in 
rotting the timbers of ships and buildings, caused by the growth of 
Merulias lachrymans â€” is another, but happily it has been, to some 
extent, subdued since the process of steeping timber in certain saline 
and acid mixtures became general.
These parasites, further, are particular in selecting the victims for 
their attacks, and confine themselves, in most instances, either to a 
single species, or to those of a genus ; but occasionally, the same 
species of parasite is found to grow on many of the plants belonging 
to one natural family, and the conditions necessary for their develop- 
ment are so peculiar as to preclude the possibility of effectually guard- 
ing against them.
The spores or seeds are so numerous, that if those 
produced from a single head of diseased grain were all to vegetate, 
they would be sufficient to infect a whole district; and I believe there 
are few fields of wheat ever found effectually free from them ; but as 
these minute spores depend so entirely on peculiar atmospheric con- 
ditions for development, it is probable that one out of every million 
will not vegetate the same season in which they are produced, though, 
like the seeds of some of the larger vegetables, they may, if favour- 
ably circumstanced, remain dormant for a great length of time, until 
the conditions essential to their development do occur, when they 
will appear in extraordinary quantities, as we occasionally find to be 
the case.
It is not well known how the spores gain admission to the 
vegetable tissue, but Dr. Greville, of Edinburgh, whose knowledge of 
the fungi is so accurate and extensive, has lately expressed an opi- 
nion, that they may at all times inhabit the tissue of those species of 
plants to which they are respectively peculiar, without, under ordi- 
535 
nary circumstances, deranging the vegetable functions, in the same 
manner as minute parasites infest different parts of the animal 
structure.
A. good opportunity occurred casually in the Botanic Gar- 
den of affording data to judge of the fearful consequences of the corn 
fungi when no means are used to check them.
In cultivating small 
samples of as many of the different kinds of the cereal grains as we 
could procure, constantly on the same piece of ground, without 
change of seed, the samples which were originally clean soon became 
infected, which increased every subsequent year, until at length the 
varieties which had been longest cultivated became so completely co- 
vered with mildew and smut, that out of the produce of three square 
yards or so, we could get scarcely a single head free from the fungi.
In this instance there is reason to suppose that the spores were pro- 
pagated by inoculation on the seed, and also that they were imbibed 
through the cellular tissue of the rootlets, along with the water con- 
taining the nutritive matters afforded by the soil.
Many more interesting cases might be brought forward to show the 
extensive operations which these minute plants perform in the vege- 
table economy, which I cannot follow further at present.
In the fore- 
going observations I have endeavoured to treat the subject in rather a 
popular manner, avoiding such scientific details as would necessarily 
be tedious, if not uninteresting, to those who have not hitherto turned 
their attention to such investigations.
I believe the only cure yet 
known for smut and mildew, is steeping the seed, if grain, in chemi- 
cal solutions calculated to destroy the vegetative principle of the 
spores of the fungi, with a proper rotation of cropping.
My object in 
noticing the matter in connexion with the foregoing part of this pa- 
per, has been with a view of directing the attention of practical gentle- 
men to its importance.
The fungi which have so uniformly accom- 
panied the potato-disease, prove that they have some connexion with 
it, as I do not think I have seen a single tuber on which the decay 
had progressed to any considerable extent, but what became more or 
less covered with the Psilonia rosea of Berkeley.
At a late meeting 
of the Highland and Agricultural Society of Scotland, a paper was 
read on this subject by Mr. Goodsir, when a practical gentleman who 
was present, stated that he had been for a number of years in the 
habit of steeping a bole* of wheat in three quarters of a pound of sul- 
phate of copper (or bluestone) dissolved in water, which he had found 
* Six bushels.
536 
to be an effectual remedy against the corn fungi.
I would beg to sug- 
gest to such as are fond of trying experiments, to steep some of the 
seed-potatoes in such solutions as our chemical friends may recom- 
mend, being persuaded the root is the right end to begin at in endea- 
vouring to find a remedy for the evil.
I am aware that several persons 
have already tried this, and I am doing so myself, having steeped 
some in a solution of salt in water, and am making preparation to try 
the sulphate of copper steep.
The great importance of raising new seedling varieties of the po- 
tato ought to be specially attended to, not that 1 think seedlings re- 
cently raised were less subject to be affected by the disease, but 
because I feel convinced there yet remains gi'eat room for improving 
this important esculent in form, produce and quality, though it might 
be supposed, that by general consent, it were agreed that potato cul- 
ture had reached the acme of perfection, so far as attempts have been 
made to improve varieties of late years; and in this point of view, the 
late failure may yet be found to have been the cause of producing 
important results.
To make the most of sound seed is another consideration which 
forces itself on our attention at the present time.
I believe it has ge- 
nerally occurred that tubers which were much divided at planting, 
were more liable to decay than those which were planted whole.
It 
might, therefore, be a somewhat hazardous experiment to cut potatoes 
much while such uncertainty prevails concerning their growth ; but 
from experience I can vouch that young shoots, taken from tubers 
after they have grown three or four inches, and have their rootlets, 
will grow and produce excellent crops, if carefully removed from the 
tuber and planted separately, and in this way sound seed might be 
amazingly increased, as we annually prove in the Botanic Garden.
I 
do not, however, mean the long, blanched shoots which grow from 
potatoes crowded in close pits ; to be successful, the tubers must be 
placed in situations where the young shoots will get both light and 
air, and thereby gain some strength before they are removed from the 
old tuber.
It is also necessary to choose moist, cloudy weather for 
planting, if possible.
An experiment of this nature is now being tried in the Garden, at 
the suggestion of his Excellency the Lord liieutenant.
I have been 
directed by the Council of the Royal Dublin Society to remove the 
young shoots, produced from diseased tubers, and plant them sepa- 
rately, to prove what effect that will have in staying the decay, the 
637 
results of which I shall have the honour of reporting to the Society 
at a future period.

[The foregoing very important paper was illustrated by specimens

BOTANICAL SOCIETY OF LONDON.
April 4, 1846.
â€” Edward Doubleday, Esq., F.L.S., Vice President, 
in the chair.
Donations to the Library were announced from the Horticultural 
Society of Berlin and Mr. W.
Pamplin.
The following specimens were exhibited : â€” 
1. Dwarf and much branched forms of Gnaphalium minimum, sent 
by the Rev. G.
W. Sandys, as bearing the general appearance of 
Gnaphalium uliginosum, and at first sight seemingly distinct from 
both of these species.
2. Examples of the peculiar Linaria from Bandon, in Ireland, la- 
belled with the MS.
name " Lin aria sepium, Allm.'''' For these spe- 
cimens the Society was indebted to Professor Allman, who, however, 
did not add any remarks in explanation of the change of name.
They 
are identical with the Cornish Linaria, described by Mr. Hewett 
Watson in the ' London Journal of Botany ' under the name of Lina- 
ria Bauhini.
The specimens are so completely intermediate between 
L. vulgaris and L.
repens, in their technical characters, as to have led 
several botanists into an opinion of their hybrid origin ; and this 
view is certainly supported by the fact that Hampshire specimens are 
again intermediate between L.
repens and L.
Italica (Bauhini and 
sepium).
3. Continuation of Mr. Andrew's series of Irish Saxifrages to illus- 
trate their wide range of variation ; the species exhibited on this oc- 
casion being the S.
Geum and S.
hirsuta.
From the beautiful series 
of specimens now in the Society's herbarium, the fact of the Hiber- 
nian forms including those of the Pyrenees, is placed beyond all 
doubt or cavil, while the specific identity of S.
Geum and S.
hirsuta 
is rendered probable.

The Herbarium Committee of the Society has just issued the follow- 
ing Address to their Fellow Members.
The Herbarium Committee appointed by the Botanical Society of 
London, feel themselves called upon to make one more effort to insure 
observance of the rules which are indispensably necessary for carrying 
out the leading object of the Society, â€” namely, the Exchange of 
Specimens.
The Committee regret to be under the necessity of stat- 
ing, that several of the Contributors still habitually disregard the rules 
laid down for their guidance.
The effect of this inattention, is to in- 
jure the good name of the Society, and also to cause so much per- 
sonal trouble and loss of time to the resident Members, as to excite 
serious apprehension that the Society will be compelled to suspend 
the exchanges of British specimens, unless the present remonstrance 
shall prove effectual in inducing a more uniform and systematic at- 
tention to their regulations.
At the same time, the Committee feel 
bound to limit this censure, by stating that, in general, the rules are 
much better observed by those Contributors who are most favourably 
known as botanists ; the defaulters being chiefly among those who are 
believed to have less acquaintance with botanical science, than many 
of their fellow Members.
This circumstance leads to a presumption, 
that the faults arise chiefly from inexperience, and may be amended 
by due attention to rules explicitly stated.
On the part of the Committee, also, increased experience has shown 
the expediency of some changes in the regulations printed on the 
cover of the ' London Catalogue of British Plants.' It has, therefore, 
appeared desirable to reprint the rules, in an amended form, and to 
send a copy of them to each Member of the Society.
It is not com- 
patible with the limits of a circular intended for post, to give reasons 
for all these rules at length.
They are now the result of much expe- 
rience and careful consideration ; and the Committee earnestly re- 
quest a strict observance of each and all of them.
Distant Members, 
unacquainted with the routine management in London, can form no 
estimate of the inconvenience which they may occasion by neglecting 
one or other of these rules : the only safe and proper course, being 
that of uniformly attending to all of them.
Provided the Contributors 
will do this (their own) duty, no reasonable exertion will be wanting 
in London towards continuing the efficiency and increasing the use- 
fulness of the Society.
The Committee deem themselves entitled to 
add, and they do so with confidence and gratification, that neither 
private correspondence, nor membership of any other association, has 
639 
ever given British botanists those advantages in forming their herba- 
ria, which are now realized by membership of the Botanical Society 
OF London.
Regulations for the exchange of British Specimens.
â€” 1.
The So- 
ciety exchanges specimens with any Member ; also with foreign bo- 
tanists, who are not required to become members.
2. The annual subscription entitles a Member to claim fifty species, 
without the necessity of contributing specimens in return.
â€” [N.B. In 
justice to those who do contribute them, the non-contributing mem- 
bers are thus supplied from the surplus specimens, which are not 
required by Contributors for the same year.] 
3. The return made to any Contributor in future, will not bear refe- 
rence to the number of specimens sent by him ; but is to be deter- 
mined by their condition and quality, and by the exactness of his 
attention to these regulations.
â€” [N.
B. It has been found that the 
parcels which include the greatest number of specimens, are often the 
least valuable to the Society ; the numbers being made out by break- 
ing the plants into fragments, â€” by introducing common species, not 
likely to be useful to the Members, â€” or by attempting to dry too 
many specimens in proportion to the quantity of paper used, and thus 
spoiling the whole lot.
A parcel is set down " Good," when it con- 
tains complete and well-dried examples, whether few or many.] 
4. Contributors may send parcels at any season convenient to them- 
selves ; a return parcel to be made up for each Contributor, as soon 
as practicable after receipt of one from him.
5. Lists of desiderata may be made by attaching a short horizontal 
mark before the names of the species and varieties in the ' London 
Catalogue ;' the marks being prefixed only to those which are requir- 
ed by the applicant.
If preferred, a manuscript list may be sent 
instead, including both the numbers and the names, written in the 
same order or series in which they are printed in the ^ London Cata- 
logue.' 
6. Lists of the Society's desiderata will be supplied to the contri- 
buting Members from time to time.
And in order to prevent the 
accumulation of useless specimens, Contributors are requested to send 
only the species asked for ; an exception to this rule, however, being 
made in the case of newly discovered species, or remarkable varieties 
not included in the ' London Catalogue.' 
7. It is greatly more convenient for the Society to ha.ve few species 
and many specimens sent in the same parcel.' â€” [N.
B. Fifty speci- 
mens of one really scarce species, may often be more useful than five 
540 
hundred specimens divided among fifty different species ; while the 
loss of time in sorting and arranging, might be nearly fifty times great- 
er in the latter case,] 
8. The specimens are required to be sufficient examples of their 
species.
Small plants should be sent entire, roots inclusive.
Long 
plants should be folded to a convenient size.
No fragments ought 
to be sent, unless in the case of trees, or other large and branched 
plants, which cannot be folded within the proper dimensions.
â€” [N.B.
The figures in Newman's 'British Ferns,' second edition, pp.
122, 209, 
215, 223, &c., afford examples of folded specimens.
In a parcel late- 
ly received from the Azores, plants of three and four feet long were 
sent entire, having been carefully folded before they were dried in 
Bentall's sixteen-inch drying paper.] 
9. Specimens ought never to exceed fifteen inches in length when 
dried.
If longer, they must be bent and folded to that length while 
fresh.
â€” [N.
B. The Society's duplicate paper is seventeen inches in 
length, â€” a size seldom exceeded in herbaria.
The specimens should 
be considerably shorter than the paper in which they are to be kept, 
in order to lessen the chance of breaking in turning over the duplicate 
store, while selecting the desiderata of Members.] 
10.
The specimens should be pressed in porous paper, sufficient in 
quantity to dry them rapidly, and thus to preserve their colour, â€” 
being also placed under a pressure sufficiently heavy to keep their 
leaves from becoming wrinkled and brittle.
â€” [N.
B. It is quite evi- 
dent that inexperienced botanists frequently use too slight pressure, 
and very frequently put too many specimens into their drying paper 
at once.
It is better to dry a half or a quarter the number, and to do 
it properly.] 
11.
It is found necessary to require, in future, that all British spe- 
cimens, sent for exchange, he labelled by the Contributors themselves ; 
the labels to be attached to the specimens in such a manner, as to 
leave the number and the name perfectly clear and uncovered by the 
specimen.
â€” [N.
B. A single slit at the base of the label, or in any 
blank part of it, is a quick and convenient mode of attachment.
But 
the neatest method hitherto in use, is that of placing the specimen 
wholly behind the label, and attaching it thereto by a small strip of 
gummed paper ; as in many of the Irish specimens from Mr. Andrews, 
dated in 1845.] 
12.
The labels are expected to show the following particulars, â€” 
at least so far as the Contributor's knowledge can supply them : â€” 
541 
1. The No. of the species according to the 'London Cata- 
logue;' if a variety, the No. and letter.
[N.
B. The No.
and letter should precede the name of the plant at the upper 
corner of the labels.] 
2. The name of the species, from the same Catalogue ; always 
with the addition of the authority after the specific name.
3. The name of the county in which the specimen was collect- 
ed ; together with any more exact description of the locality, 
which the Contributor may think fit to give.
â€” [N.
B. Dif- 
ferent places bear the same name in so many instances, as 
to create much error and confusion about localities when the 
county is omitted.] 
4. The name of the Contributor; that of the Collector also being 
added, if not the Contributor himself.
â€” [N.
B. The best 
place for the names of Contributor and Collector is at the 
base of the label â€” not at the top.] 
5. It will be understood, that the labels are those of the indivi- 
dual Contributor ; consequently, the words " Botanical 
Society of London" should not be used on them.
L3, Each parcel should enclose a list of the species sent, stating the 
number of specimens, dated, and signed with the name of the Contri- 
butor.
â€” [N.
B. It is requested that these lists may be written on 
pieces of paper, the size of a leaf from an octavo volume, the writing 
being on one page of each leaf only, with a clear margin opposite the 
left hand ; in order that they may be preserved and bound together, 
as a registry of the Society's obligations to the individual Contri- 
butors.] 
14.
Any unsuitable specimens will be returned to the member who 
sends them, in order that he may clearly understand which of his 
specimens appeared unsuitable for the objects of the Society, and may 
thus be enabled to avoid repetition of the same mistake.
15.
It is requested, lastly, that Contributors will not feel themselves 
entitled to imitate the defective specimens sent to them from London.
It is obvious that the Society can send out only such as are received, 
and that the Contributors themselves must take the lead in sending 
better.
â€” [N.
B. Though hundreds of specimens are burnt each year, 
still, in the absence of better examples of their species, many ill-dried, 
mutilated, and otherwise insufficient specimens are unavoidably sent 
out.
Members may keep these, as temporary substitutes for better, 
and still mark the species in their lists of desiderata.] 
Suggestions to Contributors of Foreign Specimens.
â€” In collecting 
Vol. II.
3 x 
542 
and drying the plants of otliei' countries, the preceding regulations may 
be followed as far as circumstances will admit.
But in parcels of fo- 
reign plants, it is desirable to include as many different species as possi- 
ble, omitting only the common European plants.
It is not required that 
all the specimens should be labelled, though it is wished that each 
species should have its label.
When a foreign parcel includes 500 
specimens, or upwards, the Society will print labels for them, â€” if 
from the same country and Contributor.

BOTANICAL SOCIETY OF EDINBURGH.
Tltursdaij, April 9th, 1846.
â€” Professor Balfour, President, in the 
chair.
Holmes Ivory, jun., Esq., 9, Ainslie Place, was elected a Resident 
Fellow, and Frederick Townsend, Esq., Trinity College, Cambridge, 
a non-resident Fellow of the Society.
Several donations to the library aud museum were announced ; par- 
ticularly from Mr. William Gardiner, jun., Dundee, his elegant little 
work on the Mosses, intended as an introduction to the study of that 
interesting tribe of plants, and which seems Mxll fitted to accomplish 
the object in view; also his list of Hepaticae, and prospectus of the 
' Flora of Forfarshire', now preparing for publication by subscription j 
also proceedings of the Horticultural Society of Liege, from Professor 
Morran.
The following communications were read : â€” 
1. Botanical Excursions in Upper Styria in 1842.
By Dr. R.
C. 
Alexander.
In this paper Dr. A gave an account of various excursions to the 
mountainous parts of Styria, during which he visited the Schokel, 
Lantsch, Leoben, Reiting, Yolling, Klagenfurt and Saltzbach.
He 
also gave a detail of the various plants observed during his tour; and 
stated that he had collected in all about 900 species, of which up- 
wards of twenty were new to the Flora of Styria.
The paper was ac- 
companied by a list of the principal plants collected south of the 
Drave.
Specimens from the Society's herbarium, contributed by Dr.
Alexander, were produced to illustrate the paper, of which an abstract 
will probably appear in the ' Annals of Natural History ' and in the 
Society's Transactions.
2. ' Remarks on the claims of certain species of plants to be con- 
sidered indigenous to Britain.' By Mr. R.
M. Stark.
At the commencement Mr. S.
adverted to the progress of botanical 
geography, and particularly to the labours of Mr. Hewett C.
Watson, 
in his works on the distribution of the British Flora.
Passing over 
the instances of shrubs and perennial herbaceous plants found appa- 
rently wild, but which have undoubtedly escaped from the gai'den, 
he directed the attention of the meeting to the large family of annual 
corn-weeds, and their claims to be regarded as truly indigenous to 
Britain.
Though universally dispersed wherever the plough and the 
agency of man extended, the fact of their not being found associated 
with other annuals where the land was waste and uncultivated, seem- 
544 
ed to prove that they were the companions of the cereal grains, and 
with them had been introduced at a very remote period.
Some of 
them (of which several instance were given) are confined to one side 
of the island, or to certain districts of the country, which showed that, 
notwithstanding their probable exotic origin, they were more or less 
subject to the laws regulating the distribution of organic life.
He 
expressed his opinion that it would be desirable, both for the interests 
of science and agriculture, that these plants and their prevalence or 
rarity in various districts should be recorded in our catalogues, local 
Floras, and other works of a similar description.
Mr. James M'Nab exhibited flowering plants of two curious species 
of Arum (A.
cordatum and A.
cornutum), raised in the garden of the 
Horticultural Society, from seeds sent home by William Jameson, 
Esq., Saharumpore, in April, 1843.
The flowering spathe of the one 
was two feet, and of the other eighteen inches in length, both being 
beautifully mottled with brown and yellow spots ; and, what is very 
remarkable, the two species were sown on the same day, and after re- 
ceiving the same treatment for about three years, flowered within 
twenty-four hours of each other.
Beautiful specimens of Pinguicula grandiflora, from Bandon, near 
Cork, communicated by Miss Carpenter, Bristol ; of Vaccinium ma- 
crocarpum, from near Mold, in Flintshire, by Dr. Bidwell, Albrighton; 
and of Dianthus ca3sius, from the debris of Salisbury Crags, by Mr.
John Laing, Experimental Garden, were exhibited to the meeting.
â€” TV.
W.E, 
Discovery of Sp]i(Brocarpus terrestris in Fruit near Norwich.
By George Fitt, Esq.
I HAVE lately found this plant abundantly in fructification near 
Yarmouth.
Sir W.
Hooker mentions in the 2d vol.
of the 'British 
Flora,' that he had never been fortunate enough to meet with it in 
fruit, and had never seen its ripened capsules, â€” and he now believes 
that they have not before been found in England.
Mr. Turner, who 
found it for many years in this neighbourhood, and to whose kindness 
1 am indebted for a knowledge of its habitat, never gathered it in that 
state.
I have met with it only sparingly for three or four years, but 
it has been very plentiful this season, and I first observed its capsules 
on some patches which were laid aside in water for a few days, to 
keep them fresh.
Last week I gathered a good number in fruit, in a 
545 
clover layer, where I this year find it most plentifully.
The author 
of the ' British Flora' says "much more rarely I have found one of 
these pistilliform bodies enlarged into a perfectly spherical form, tip- 
ped with a short, slender style, the whole not larger than the eighth 
of a perianth." He here describes, probably, an immature or abor- 
tive capsule ; for the description answers to those which I have ex- 
amined, excepting that the latter fill two thirds of a perianth, the 
lower portion of which is distended by the bulk of the capsule.
He 
says further, " the contents of so small a body I could not satisfacto- 
rily ascertain, but they appeared, when pressed out, to consist of a 
pulpy substance." One fine one, which 1 broke open, contained 300 
seeds, if I may so call them, each much resembling the capsule in 
their beautiful reticulations.
They differ, however, from the latter, 
in being perfectly transparent, the light reflected from the mirror of 
the microscope being seen through their reticulations, while the cap- 
sule is yellow and opaque.
The seeds are surrounded by a fluid 
substance, which disappears as they ripen, and amongst them are a 
few, irregular-shaped bodies, or collections of minute cells, of a 
bright green colour, beautifully contrasting with the pale yellowish 
hue of the seeds.
The capsules are tough and highly elastic, bound- 
ing away from the microscope two or three feet w^hen pressed witli a 
needle.
The seeds from one very ripe capsule appeared to have an aperture 
on one side, but I have not been able to detect this appearance in 
any others ; possibly because not sufficiently ripe.

Notes on the Wild and Cultivated examples of Rihes rubrum.
By Hewett C.
Watson, Esq.
On reading Dr. Bromfield's remarks upon the wild and garden cur- 
rants of the Isle of Wight, in last month's ' Phytologist ' (ii, 517), T 
proceeded to ascertain how far those in my own garden would corres- 
pond with either of the two varieties mentioned by Dr. Bromfield, the 
"sylvestre" and " sativum." I found the characters combined diffe- 
rently from their combinations reported by that exact botanist.
But 
as there are several slight varieties of the red currant in cultivation.
546 
it was to be expected that some would approach nearer to wild 
varieties.
On the 5th of May there were still several fi'esh-opened flowers, and 
even some unopened buds, on the bushes in my garden.
In those 
recently expanded, the filament was about equal in length to the 
breadth of the anther ; but in those which were fading, the filament 
was twice as long.
(Such an elongation of the filament is observable 
in many plants).
The lobes of the anthers, out-topping the connec- 
tivum, were separated by a space equal to their own breadth, or near- 
ly so ; being thus unlike the figure in 'English Botany,' and corres- 
ponding well with Dr. Bromfield's apt comparison to the head or 
" handle of a crutch." 
On some bushes the flowers were of one uniform and yellowish 
green colour ; while on others, each lobe of the calyx had a large 
blotch of brown or dull purple.
The leaves of all had the character 
mentioned by Dr. Bromfield, though not equally so.
Thus, my garden bushes agree with the variety " sativum," in the 
main ; but in the character of the anther, and partially in the colour 
of the flower, they belong rather to the variety " sylvestre." More- 
over, I have several times observed that the leaves of stray seedlings, 
which spring up about the kitchen garden, and also (bird sown) 
among the shrubs in the flower-garden, are much more pubescent than 
those of their presumed parents, the cultivated bushes ; nevertheless, 
some of these young examples have shown their parent foliage.
As 
such stray seedlings usually fall victims to the gardener's destructive 
labours, 1 cannot now find one of them sufiiciently advanced to pro- 
duce flowers.
But under the facts here stated, the differences ob- 
served by Dr. Bromfield do not appear conclusive arguments against 
the likelihood of the wild bushes in the Isle of Wight being bird- 
sown descendants of the garden currants.
They may have multiplied 
in their wild state ; but this fact, if it be such, will not make them 
" natives," in case their primary stock was that of the gardens.
Dr. Bromfield's opinion is no slight testimony in favour of the view 
which makes the currant a true native of Hampshire and Sussex.
Still, it appears to myself, that in the absence of certain proof either 
way, the probability leans against the native claim of the red currant 
in the midland and southern counties.
The propagation of fruit from 
seeds by the agency of man and birds, is an admitted and familiar fact; 
and we do not find currant bushes so numerous and general in the 
southern half of England, as to give this instrumentality the semblance 
of a cause inadequate to the results observed.
I may confidently say 
547 
that, since July of last year, hundreds of seedling currants have 
sprung \A'ithin the limits of my own gardens ; many of them in spots 
to which they must have been conveyed by birds.
I should there- 
fore consider that birds and mankind might unconsciously stock the 
woods of the Isle of Wight in the space of a few years.
The supply 
of seeds being constantly renewed, the stock would be kept up, under 
suiting conditions of soil and climate, even supposing the wild (be- 
come wild) bushes not to produce others fi'om their own seeds, as 
would more probably be done under such conditions.
Dr. Bromfield obseiTcs that the wild currants flower at an earlier 
date than those of the garden, in the Isle of Wight.
This is some- 
thing additional to the evidence on' the native side ; but still far from 
conclusive.
I cannot state anything positive about the currant ; but 
we have an analogous case in the gooseberry.
Occasionally the seed- 
lings of the gooseberry have here escaped destruction, and produced 
flowers and fruit among the ornamental shrubs of the flower-garden.
In this shaded situation, the leaf-buds of the gooseberry are at least a 
fortnight earlier in expanding than are those of their parents cultivated 
in the open borders of the kitchen-garden.
I scarcely know whether 
to attribute this difierence to the variety or to the shade.
It is, how- 
ever, a fact, that the shelter of trees will frequently hasten the leafing 
and flowering of plants in spring ; the ground being much less cooled 
by radiation during the severe nights of winter and eai'lier spring, in 
such situations.
At the same season, the surface of damp ground is 
less cold than that of dry ground, at least, it is so where the damp- 
ness is occasioned by water oozing out from underneath the surface.
The damp and shaded places in the Isle of Wight, may really be less 
cold to a plant in early spring ; although, as the season progresses, 
the open borders of a garden may acquire a higher temperature un- 
der the sun's rays ; the balance left after radiation being then turned 
in favour of the garden ground.
Among notes of the dates at which garden plants open their first 
flowers in my own garden (say fifty feet above the sea), near the north 
base of a ridge of hills, rising from one to two hundred feet higher, I 
find the following :

Notice of ' Outlines of Structural and PJiysiological Botany?
By 
Arthur Henfre;y, F.L.S., &c..
Lecturer on Botany at the 
Middlesex Hospital, late Botanist to the Geological Survey of 
the United Kingdom.
Part I.
Van Voorst, London.
Aided by the wonderful improvement in microscopes, and the great 
advances in chemical science which have been made in late years, 
several eminent physiologists on the continent have laboured to ex- 
plore the secrets of vegetable nature ; but hitherto their publications 
have been almost inaccessible to many persons in this kingdom, who 
find it inconvenient to spend much money and time in the perusal of 
foreign periodicals.
Such readers will now find the first part of this 
admirable little treatise an instructive summary of what has been 
written on the subject of elementary structures, to be followed up in 
two succeeding parts by an exposition of the organs of vegetation and 
those of reproduction and general Physiology.
The book is not a 
mere compilation ; but one of a class which in these days is very 
much wanted, where an accomplished student of Nature, judiciously 
availing himself of the labours of his predecessors and contemporaries, 
and submitting them to the test of re-examination, presents them in 
a concise and lucid form, enriched with original comments of his own.
Here, too, the reader will find the various opinions of different writers 
usefully contrasted.
Mr. Henfrey has laudably aimed at the exclu- 
sion of groundless hypotheses.
The subject, indeed, cannot be pro- 
fitably discussed without the introduction of theory.
An actual 
knowledge of the process of vegetation is at present beyond our reach ; 
but there are analogies observable in the lowest and simplest plants 
which tend to show that every individual plant originates in a single 
cellule.
This conclusion can only be met by the difficulty of ac- 
counting for the diversity of structure presented by different parts of 
the tissue in the higher tribes.
Physiologists have not been able to 
ascertain how many cellules exist in the embryo oak while it is yet 
lodged in the acorn ; but it is almost impossible to conceive them to 
549 
be equal in number to those of the full-grown tree.
If fewer, then 
the subsequent addition must have been elaborated by the primordial 
cellules.
In the base of a stem of Botrychium Lunaria the rudimen- 
tary plant which is to expand two years hence, may be found lodged 
in the heart of another rudimentary plant which takes precedence of 
it, and waits to succeed the plant of the pi'esent season.
The forma- 
tion of buds in exogenous plants may commence at an equally early 
period : and if so, we may in vain hope to detect their elementary 
cellule, or to trace the order of development.
Mr. Henfrey's useful 
book does all that can be done to simplify the study of vegetable phy- 
siology, and we cordially recommend it on account both of its excel- 
lence and its moderate price.
The numerous illustrations, executed by himself, are more truthful 
than any we have previously seen, and the details of the work are 
more in accordance with our own views than are given in any other 
English work.
Only one exceptionable statement occurs to us.
The 
commonly entertained opinion that the evolution of carbonic acid by 
night from the leaves of plants, proceeds from the oxidation of the 
tissues has, we think, been disproved by Liebig, who shows that it 
may be nothing more than the escape of what was contained in the 
water previously absorbed by the plant and passing off by evaporation.

en France," of Gardiner's ' Twenty Lessons on British Mosses,' and 
of Harvey's ' Phycologia Britannica,' The Catalogue of Lobb's Java 
plants will give some increased value to the sets ; though, as might 
be expected, it is far from being a catalogue of the species, only the 
name of the order or genus being mentioned for the greater number.
In describing his new genus, which is designated ' Purdicea,'' Dr.
Planchon suggests that the genus Sarracenia has an " immediate affi- 
nity " with Pyrola.
His views are not fully explained ; but it seems 
that he regards Sarracenia, Pyrola, Monotropa, Dionsea and Drosera 
as nearly allied genera, and therefore all closely related to Ericaceae, 
with which it has been usual to associate two of them, namely, Py- 
rola and Monotropa.
In his new work, ' The Vegetable Kingdom,' Dr.
Lindley places Sarraceniacea^ between Papaveracea?
and Ranuncula- 
ceae.
But in his ' Natural System,' dated in 1836, he had pointed out 
the relationship of Sarracenia to Dionaea, which latter genus is refer- 
red to Droseraceae in ' The Vegetable Kingdom.' After all, it is a 
question of convenience or caprice, not of nature, whether Pyrola 
should be associated more closely with Sarracenia or with Erica.
We can scarcely conceive any botanist bringing Sarraceniaceae into 
the Erical alliance ; but we may more readily concur with those who 
would remove Pyrolaceae and Monotropaceas therefrom, and associate 
them with Droseraceae and Sarraceniaceae â€” an alliance of oddities.

Botanical Notes.
By E.
S. Wilson, Esq.
Having paid some attention this year to the two allied species of 
Cardaraine, hirsuta and sylvatica, I send you the following result of 
my observations.
Of a hundred specimens of C.
hirsuta, gathered at different times, 
and in various localities, eighty-seven had their stems and pods per- 
fectly smooth ; eleven had them both hairy, and the remaining two 
had the stems hairy and the pods smooth.
Of the same number of 
specimens of C.
sylvatica, taken in the same way, not one had the 
stems otherwise than hairy, nor the pods otherwise than glabrous.
I have lately been made acquainted with a fact of some botanical 
interest, which I will not suppress, though it seems to lead to no con- 
clusion.
About two miles from Congleton is the village of Danein- 
shaw, so called from the little river of that name, which runs through 
551 
it.
At the upper end of the village stands the mill ; and behind the 
mill is a long, narrow slip of meadow land, bounded on one side by the 
river, and on the other by a hanging wood.
Between the wood and 
the meadow runs the mill-race, or artificial channel which conveys 
the water to the wheel.
The country beyond is of a remarlvably wild 
and sylvan character.
I was told by a gentleman residing in Congle- 
ton, that in the spring of last year he found a blue-flowered anemone 
in this meadow ; that he carried the plant home to his garden, where 
it perished during the winter.
My informant does not profess to be a 
botanist, and therefore could not say whether the plant was, or was 
not, A.
apenuina ; but to this extent he was quite sure, that it was 
not one of the common purple-tinged varieties of A.
nemorosa.
The 
colour of the flower was a clear azure blue.
During the present year 
I have repeatedly searched the adjoining woods and fields for another 
specimen, but without success.
On the last occasion I observed Ri- 
bes rubrum in half-a-dozen places along the mill-race, and the recol- 
lection of Dr. Bromfield's interesting paper led me to examine it with 
some attention.
I was unable, however, to detect any of the charac- 
ters mentioned by your correspondent, except that the perianths were 
slightly tinged with brownish purple.
May I call the attention of your readers to a form of Myosotis, 
which occurs not unfrequently in damp meadows ?
It belongs to the 
group with small flowers and short pedicels, and has hitherto, I be- 
lieve, been referred to M.
versicolor, which in many respects it resem- 
bles, but has the calyx much less deeply cleft, and the opening flower 
white instead of yellow.
It also begins to flower about three weeks 
later.
From M.
collina it is effectually distinguished by its closed 
calyx; besides that the opening flower in that species, as in all the 
other British Myosotides, is pink.
When Smith and Hooker speak 
of M.
versicolor as occasionally found in wet meadows, there can be 
no doubt that they allude to the plant of which I am now writing, 
though they give not a hint of any difference in colour or structure.
You shall have specimens as soon as I can procure them.
Last summer I observed Oxalis corniculata growing as a weed in 
the rectory garden, at Astbury.
It seemed to grow as freely as Vero- 
nica polita, or any other garden weed.
I was rather surprised at this, 
having always understood that the plant was confined to the Channel 
counties.
I could not learn whether it was of annual occurrence.
Going through one of our woods a few days ago, I met with a cu- 
rious state of Tussilago Farfara, which was new to me, though per- 
haps it may not be so to your readers.
The peculiarity consisted in 
552 
the branched stems, bearing from two to four heads of flowers, on 
longish stalks.
All the lateral heads were plainly of secondary 
growth, and inferior in size to the terminal one.
Ranunculus Lenormandi, if so it must be called, is plentiful on our 
peat mosses.
Besides the differences already mentioned, the leaves are 
much rounder and less ivy-like than those of E,.
hederaceus.
Talking 
of these plants, I may perhaps be allowed to observe, that I used to 
experience great difficulty in drying them, from the curling of the 
leaves, and the twisting and entangling of the stalks during the pro- 
cess of removal.
All this I now avoid by the following simple me- 
thod : having carefully washed the plant in clear water, 1 lay it down, 
while dripping wet, upon a sheet of drying paper, to which, in that 
state, it will stick like a plaster, and so put it into the press.
On the 
following day, without attempting to detach the half-dried plant from 
the sheet on which it lies, I take the sheet and plant both together, 
place them between thick folds of dry paper, and return them to the 
press.
This process I repeat every day, until the specimen is tho- 
roughly dried, when it may be finally removed, as perfect in form and 
colour as on the day it was gathered.
The same method may be em- 
ployed with all those plants, such as Callitriche, the Potamogetons, 
&c., whose weak and flaccid habit makes them difficult to deal with 
by the ordinary process.

Linn<Ea horealis, 8fc., on Ben Beck, Braemar.
By William Gardiner, Esq.
On the 28th of July last I found this sweetest gem of our native 
Flora in considerable abundance on Ben Beck, a hill bounding the 
valley of Castleton, on the south-east.
The station is not ten minutes 
walk from the village, the plants spreading over little hillocks, among 
birch trees, about half-way up the hill, and were at the above date 
partly out of flower.
I am not aware that this locality has been no- 
ticed before.
Pyrola media, minor and secunda also occur upon this 
hill, and among the more interesting cryptogamic plants observed 
were Tetraphis pellucida, Hookeria lucens, Hypnum cordifolium, &.
purpureiwi, Splachnum mnioides, Dicranum scoparium, B.
fuscescens, 
Jungermannia minuta, concinnata, Taylori, ciliaris, multifida and bi- 
cuspidata, Gyrophora erosa, pellita, cylindrica, polyphylla and pro- 
553 
boscidea, Cornicularia tristis, bicolor, aculeata and lanata, Lecidea si- 
lacea, CEderi and sanguinaria, Nephroma resupinata, Peltidea scu- 
tata and various other mosses, lichens and Hepatica;.
After examining numerous specimens of the three lichens known as 
Lecidea confluens, silacea and CEderi, I could not discover any good 
marks of distinction, except in the colour of the crust, and even that 
is not constant.
Frequently the forms with a cinereous, yellow and 
orange-red thallus may be seen distinct enough upon the same rock, 
but in other cases the cinereous is seen blending into the yellow and 
the orange-red.
The apothecia are much alike in all, though varying 
in form and size.
They are at first flat, with a narrow, entire, eleva- 
ted border, afterwards convex, and where they become confluent, an- 
gular.
The yellow form, or L.
silacea, has frequently soredia resem- 
bling the apothecia of Urceoloria.

Note on Equisetum variegatum of Weber and Mohr.
By Edward Newman.
I am indebted to the kindness of the Rev. Mr.
Cresswell, of Sal- 
combe vicarage, near Sidmouth, for an interesting series of the true 
Equisetum variegatum of Weber and Mohr, the erect, aquatic form of 
the plant which had previously occurred to botanists only on the 
banks of the Dee, in Kincardineshire, and in the Dublin canal.
The 
specimens received on the 20th of March were in full flower, indeed, 
perhaps, rather passed perfection, so that this form of unbranched 
Equisetum must be regarded as one of the earliest in flowering.
Mr.
Cresswell's note, copied below, contains a most interesting observa- 
tion on this subject.
I may remark that Mr. Moore, of Dublin, still continues to regard 
this form as a distinct species of Equisetum ; cultivating it in com- 
pany with the more feeble and prostrate form called ' arenarium,' he 
finds both plants preserve their respective habits and characters : I 
am not desirous of enforcing my opinion against that of so distin- 
guished a botanist, but feel disinclined to the multiplication of names, 
except on very clear evidence : it may, however, be observed that in 
the present instance Mr. Moore will scarcely propose an additional 
554 
name, since the erect form is certainly the type of Equisetum variega- 
tum, and the only form known by the authors of that name ; and the 
prostrate plant has been described as Equisetum arenarium, this name 
also being restricted to one form.

Mr. CressweWs note.
" I TAKE the liberty of enclosing for your inspection the accompany- 
ing Equisetum, of which I can find no exact description in your 
volume of ' British Ferns.' It appears to me to hold a position very 
near your Equisetum variegatum, var.
Wihoni.
It does not, how- 
ever, exactly accord with that, being, I should suppose, more slight 
and weak.
I know of only one locality for the plant, which grows on the un- 
dercliff facing the sea, in a small muddy stream issuing from beneath 
the overlying green sand formation, about 200 feet above the sea, and 
more than 200 from the top of the cliff.
I enclose you fronds in almost every state, in order that you may 
see how much it varies in size and branching; you will also see that 
the branches are often fertile, in which it appears to differ from E.
Wilsoni.
The greater number of fronds are not branched at all.
I first observed the plant in August last, when I found the fructifi- 
cation rare, and generally unripe.
In November more capsules wei'e 
ripe, and to day, March 19, it appears to me to be in the greatest 
perfection.
I may also observe that in the same sjDOt, and growing with this 
plant, I found fertile fronds of E.
Telmateia, one of which was eigh- 
teen inches long.
The cHff faces direct south.
The dark green ver- 
dure of the Equisetum sent, contrasted strongly with the brown, dead 
leaves of Arundo Phragmitis and the last year's fronds of E.
Tel- 
mateia.

Notice of^ Twenty Lessons on British Mosses.^ By Wm. Gardiner, 
Dundee, illustrated with specimens.
Dundee: Mathers, 1846.
This is one of those unpretending little volumes which are almost 
sure to win their way to the good graces of all into whose hands they 
fall.
It does not claim to be a descriptive list of our mosses or a de- 
tailed account of their structure.
It makes no pretensions to be con- 
sidered a work of science : or to rank as authority.
It is exactly such 
a simple, unassuming discourse as a botanist might address to his 
children when wandering with them in the woods, and such also as 
he might exemplify and illustrate Avith the mosses he would find 
around him on all sides.
But we shall allow Mr. Gardiner to speak 
for himself 
"my dear young readers, 
" You have doubtless, in some of your rural walks, noticed the little 
mosses, that, in the beautiful woods, cover the ground with a fresh 
green carpet, and adorn the tops of old walls with their lovely ver- 
dure.
But, perhaps, you have not examined them attentively, nor 
are aware that there are so many kinds of them, all differing from one 
another in the structure of their various parts.
It shall be my object 
in these lessons to lead you to a better acquaintance with them.
" Possibly you may have often passed them by with little more than 
a heedless glance, â€” thinking that, because there were plenty of 
bright-coloured flowers and stately trees around to delight your eye, 
the humble moss was scarcely worth your attention.
Because things 
are small or humble, however, they should not be treated with con- 
tempt nor carelessness.
God made the little moss as well as the 
glowing flower and lofty tree, and He has made nothing in vain.
We 
may not know all the uses for which such tiny things were created, 
but we know some of them.
We love what is beautiful, for God has 
implanted in our minds that love ; and in the structure of the mosses, 
as well as in that of many others of his smallest works, there is a 
very great deal of beauty.
We love them, therefore, because it is 
natural for us to love what is beautiful.
This love yields us true plea- 
sure, which constitutes our earthly happiness, and ought to awaken 
our gratitude to the benevolent Creator, who hath so kindly provided 
for our purer gratifications.
" Mosses are found in all parts of the world ; and in Britain alone, 
there are about 400 different kinds.
Their places of growth are as 
varied as their forms.
Some are found in the deepest valleys, by the 
sides of lonely streams, or within the spray-clouds of roaring water- 
556 
falls ; others brave the tempests of lofty mountain summits, or seek 
shelter among their shelving rocks ; many court the shade of the 
forest, or nestle about the roots of the hedge-rows ; whilst various 
species seek the open fields or the sunny wall-tops, or have their 
homes in the deep morass, or dwell on the sandy shores of the mighty 
ocean." â€” p.
5. 
"The Structure of Mosses.
â€” A moss, like plants of a larger growth, 
is furnished with a root, stem and leaves, and, in place of a flower, 
has a little vessel usually supported on a stalk, and containing the 
seeds.
The stems vary from the twentieth part of an inch to a foot 
in height, but not many of them exceed three or four inches.
The 
leaves are in some kinds nearly round ; in others ovate, or egg-shap- 
ed ; oJ/ow^, or longer than broad ; /awceo/a^e, or lance-shaped ; subu- 
late, or awl-shaped ; setaceous, or bristle-shaped, and of various other 
forms.
Some of them are beautifully reticulated or netted, which is 
best seen under a microscope.
They are often furnished with a nerve 
or midrib, which varies in length, â€” in some shorter than the leaf, in 
others longer.
In colour, they are found from the palest tint of green 
to the darkest, and even brown, purple, or nearly black.
Their edges 
are frequently denticulated, or toothed, or serrated, or notched like a 
saw, and their direction straight or curved.
" The little vessel containing the seeds is called the capsule, or 
fruit, and the stalk which supports it the seta, or fruit- stalk.
The 
capsule is covered by a hood, called the calyptra, or veil ; and when 
this is pulled off, or falls off, we see an operculum, or lid covering the 
the mouth of the capsule.
When the lid is removed, we find the 
mouth of the capsule either surrounded with a number of little teeth, 
or naked.
The teeth are named the peristome, or fringe, and are in 
number 4, 8, 16, 32, or 64.
They are variable in length and form in 
the different kinds of mosses, and either in a single or double row.
Their use is to protect the seeds in moist weather, which you will see 
by merely breathing upon a capsule, when its fringe is expanded in 
the sunshine, â€” the slight moisture of your breath making the little 
teeth instantly close over its mouth.
The seeds are very small and 
simple, having no lobes nor germ like the pea and bean.
In dry, 
sunny weather, the fringe opens, and the ripe seeds are scattered 
abroad by the gentle winds, and wafted to places fitted for their abode, 
where in time they put forth their delicate stems and leaves.
These 
mosses, when fully grown, produce, like their parents, little capsules 
filled with seeds, and these seeds again in due season spring up into 
other mosses of the same kind, and thus continue to perpetuate their

Specimens of the capsule, seta, calyptra, operculum and peristome 
are neatly gummed on the paper, and illustrate the description.
Twenty species of mosses are more minutely described, and a spe- 
cimen accompanies each description ; the following are selected as 
examples : â€” 
" Encalypia vulgaris.
â€” Common Extinguisher Moss.
This genus 
is so named because the veil or calyptra covers the capsule in the 
same way as we cover the flame of a candle by what is called an ex- 
tinguisher, to put it out.
The fringe has sixteen short teeth, and the 
veil is entire at the base, â€” the other four species, which are alpine, 
having the base of the veil toothed.
This grows upon wall-tops, and 
early in the spring is found along with the little Draba verna, almost 
the earliest of our spring flowers, and perhaps the smallest, â€” its white 
blossoms and diminutive seed-pods being often produced on stems a 
quarter of an inch high.
About the time when these two plants are 
found in perfection, we listen with delight to the far-off" lark filling the 
blue heavens with its cheerful melody, and the happy thrush pouring 
from the topmost branch of some yet leafless tree its sprightly song.
There is thus, you will perceive, a great deal of pleasure connected 
with plants, besides what we derive from contemplating their own 
beauty.
We associate them in our minds with the scenery amid 
which they grow, the season in which they are gathered, and other 
circumstances ; which, for many a day or even year afterwards, affords 
us the most pleasant reflections." â€” p.
17.
" Weissia nigrita.
â€” Black-fruited Weissia.
The genus Weissia is 
named in honour of a German botanist, Weiss, and includes about 
twenty native species.
The fringe has sixteen teeth, placed round the 
mouth of the capsule at equal distances, and are mostly short.
The 
Weissia nigrita derives its specific name from the mature capsule 
being of a black colour.
It is a very rare moss, being found only in 
a few places.
It is said to grow on the mountains near Blair in AthoU, 
forty miles inland ; and the specimen here given is from the Sands of 
Barrie, on the coast of Forfarshire.
This is a remarkable circum- 
stance, and shows that the climate of the lofty mountain and that of 
the sea-shore are very similar.
"Many mosses, as well as flowers, are so common that they are found 
all over the country ; others are only met with here and there ; while 
some are so rai'e, that they are found but in a few particular places.
The place where a plant is found is called its locality.
The Sands 
of Barrie is one locality for the black-fruited Weissia â€” the mountain, 
Ben-y-Gloe, is said to be another.

" Sir James E.
Smith, the author of the ' English Flora,' observes, 
that ' a plant gathered in a celebrated or delightful spot, is like the 
hair of a friend, more dear to memory than even a portrait, because it 
excites the imagination without presuming to fill it.' When we look 
upon this little moss, neither its own simple beauty, nor that of the 
various species with which it has a family relation, alone engage the 
attention, for before it flits glorious remembrances or imaginative an- 
ticipations of magnificent Highland mountains and ocean shores." â€” 
p. 19.
" Fissideus bryoides.
Small Fern-leaved Fork Moss, or Mungo 
Park's Moss.
â€” This pretty little moss is found in various parts of the 
world.
Even in the sandy deserts of Africa, it is met with; and we 
are told by that intrepid traveller, Mungo Park, that the contempla- 
tion of its beauty was at one time the means of preserving his life.
Plundered by banditti, worn out with fatigue, and surrounded by all 
the horrors of the desert, his courage almost failed him, and he sat 
down to rest his weary limbs, and ponder on his destitute condition.
' At this moment,' he says, ' painful as my reflections were, the ex- 
traordinary beauty of a small moss irresistibly caught my eye ; and 
though the whole plant was not larger than the tip of one of my fin- 
gers, I could not contemplate the delicate conformation of the roots, 
leaves, &c., without admiration.
Can that Being (I thought) who 
planted, watered, and brought to perfection, in this obscure part of 
the world, a thing of so small importance, look with unconcern upon 
the situation and sufferings of creatures formed after his own image ?
Surely not !
Reflections such as these would not allow me to 
despair : I started up, and, disregarding both hunger and fatigue, 
travelled forwards, assured that relief was at hand, and I was not 
disappointed.' 
" Fissidens is closely allied to Dicranum, and both are named from 
the sixteen teeth of the fringe being bijid, or divided like a fork.
There are several species, and the leaves of all are very curious in 
their structure, the upper half being double, or composed as it were 
of two plates or leaves.
" This grows diffusedly spread over shady banks, particularly un- 
der the shade of hedges and woods, and is met with in fructification 
at various seasons.
It is an exquisite little moss, and cannot fail to 
strike with admiration any one who will bestow upon it an attentive 
examination." â€” p.

In conclusion, we heartily recommend this little publication to the 
notice of our readers, as one of the prettiest botanical presents that 
could be made to their juvenile acquaintance.

Microscopical Society^ May 13^^, 1846.
J. S.
Bowerbank, Esq., President, in the chair.
This evening a paper by E.
J. Quekett, Esq., entitled " Some Ob- 
servations on the microscopic appearances in diseased Potatoes of the 
present season " was read.
After some preliminary observations, Mr.
Quekett went on to state that if a section be made of a potato in which 
the disease is only just commencing, it will be observed that a large 
quantity of fluid follows the incision, and that many minute points, of 
a brown colour, of various sizes, may be detected in the cut surface.
As the disease advances, these spots become larger, those on the sur- 
face being of a brownish black, and exhibiting evident marks of the 
commencement of decomposition in them.
If very thin sections of 
the interior diseased portions be submitted to the microscope, it will 
be seen that certain cells, beside containing grains of starch, have for 
the most part their walls lined with a brown, granular matter, the par- 
ticles being very minute.
In a section from the exterior, where the 
marks of the disease have become very manifest, all the cells are found 
to be of this brown colour, and masses of irregular, grumous matters 
occupy their interior.
Upon close examination tubes may be disco- 
vered between the cells, containing minute granules, which tubes 
branch according to the interspaces of the cells, and it often occurs 
that the interspaces appear to be filled with granules alone.
These 
appearances are referred by Mr. Quekett to the presence of minute 
fungi, whose growth is exceedingly rapid, and which appear under 
the forms of particles, sporidia and filaments.
The particles, which 
are not ^Tj^iy-^ of an inch in diameter, appear to compose the greater 
portion of the mass of diseased structure : they require a power of at 
least 300 linear to separate them.
The sporidia are of various sizes, 
the larger a little curved, and containing some nuclei or cytoblasts 
within, and probably are species of the genus Fusarium.
The fila- 
ments are jointed and branched, and contain granular matter.
A mi- 
nute fungus, having filaments, bearing globular heads containing 
sporules, apparently belonging to some species of Botrytis, is also 
frequently seen on the exterior.
The author then proceeded to state 
560 
the opinions of various writers on this subject, and gave as the result 
of his own observations that the origin of the disease was evidently 
connected with the appearance of a ramifying, filamentous fungus, 
that the brown spots indicative of the same are secondary, and that 
the decay arises from the vitality of the cells being destroyed by the 
presence of the fungus ; and he concluded by adducing various facts 
in proof of the correctness of his particular views.

An Arrangement of the British Flora in accordance with the AU 
liances and Orders of Professor Lindleifs * Vegetable Kingdom.^ 
Professor Lindley's great work, * The Vegetable Kingdom,' is so 
certain to take rank among those of the highest authority in relation 
to systematic Botany, that we have thought it would prove service- 
able to the readers of the ' Phytologist,' to have before them a list of 
the classes and alliances now recognized by the learned author of that 
work ; together with a list of such of the orders and genera as are 
represented by species in the British Flora ; but shortening the lists 
of genera by omitting those of the cellular plants, and also such 
among the vascular plants as fall under orders almost invariably re- 
cognized and adopted by systematic authors, and hence sufficiently 
familiar; for example, the numerous genera of Graminaceae andAste- 
racege, or grasses and syngenesious plants, which are always brought 
together in systems of classification.
By separating the leaf-bearing cryptogamic plants from the rest; 
the reticulate-veined monocotyledons from such as bear leaves with 
parallel veins ; the Coniferae and Cycadeaceai from other exogens ; 
and by taking RafBesia, Cytinus, Balanophora and their allies, for a 
distinct class of themselves ; the author of ' The Vegetable Kingdom ' 
forms seven primary groups, instead of the trinitarian number more 
usually received.
The following characters are given for these seven 
"Classes."

Such is the classification of Dr. Lindley, in its bearings upon the 
568 
plants of Britaiu.
It will at once be observed that in combining 
orders into alliances, the author has totally changed the consecutive 
series usually adhered to, more or less closely, by the botanists of this 
country.
Orders are thus grouped together which have usually been 
placed far apart.
And on the other hand, several equally wide dis- 
junctions have been deemed necessary or expedient.
But the changes 
of genera from one order to another are by no means numerous in pro- 
portion : in several instances, such changes in the place of genera 
occur with those of anomalous or peculiar structural disposition of 
organs, or in which certain organs are reduced in number or wholly 
absent.
But our immediate object is that of showing what is the new 
arrangement, not that of criticism upon its details ; and we therefore 
close the abstract without further remark.

Notes on the LastrcBa foenesecii as a species including both forms oj 
Nephrodimn fcenesecii (Lowe), and Aspidiuni dilatatum, var.
recurvum, (BreeJ.
By Hewett C.
Watson, Esq.
When two persons who give their attention to the same facts do 
yet deduce conflicting opinions therefrom, it may fairly be assumed 
that some third party must be appealed to for judgment between them.
To a certain extent, I find Mr. Newman and myself thus in conflict 
respecting the specific identity of (the formerly supposed two) ferns 
above named.
The opinions of Mr. Newman are given in a recent 
number of this periodical (Phytol.
ii.
509) ; and in his paper this gen- 
tleman there mentions that I had requested his attention to the sub- 
ject.
In thus making mention of me, he was writing only with refe- 
rence to one point, in which our views concurred, and therefore he 
made no allusion to more essential points of non-concurrence.
But 
as in some respects we have got to opposite conclusions, from inspec- 
tion of the same specimens, I feel desirous to place before the same 
body of readers that which 1 deem to be a necessary qualification of 
Mr. Newman's views.
In order to render the points intelligible, it may be well to first 
mention briefly some items of the history of the (so considered) spe- 
cies and their names.
In the fourth volume of the * Magazine of 
Natural History,' published in 1831, the Rev. Mr.
Bree figured a fern 
under the name of "Aspidiuni dilatatum, xar.
recurvmnJ'^ Though 
he thus named the fern only as a variety, yet in a foot-note he ex- 
569 
pressed his opinion that it " is really a distinct species." He there 
mentioned two characters by which to distinguish it from dilatatum, 
namely, the recurved divisions of the leaflets, and the triangular form 
of the frond, arising from the larger size of the lower pinnae.
In the Cambridge 'Philosophical Transactions,' a year or two after- 
wards, the Rev. Mr.
Lowe published a paper which had been read 
before the Cambridge Society in 1830, In that paper Mr. Lowe de- 
scribed a fern which he had found to be common in Madeira, and to 
which he gave the new specijic name of " fcenesecii." As he found 
the frond of his fern assuming two different forms of outline, triangu- 
lar or oblong, under different conditions of shade, he gave a subordi- 
nate name to each form, viz., that of "alatum" to the triangular form, 
and that of " productum " to the oblong form.
Explicitly and unmis- 
takeably he showed that the triangular form was to be considered the 
true and typical form of his species " fcenesecii ; the other form being, 
in his opinion, rather a state or monstrosity produced by deficiency 
of light.
He did not confuse his fern with the dilatatum or spinulo- 
sum of authors, but expressly stated it to be distinct from both.
Very recently it has been suggested that Bree's fern and Lowe's 
fern are identical species ; and assuming this identity admitted, the 
question arises, ' what is the proper specific name of the united spe- 
cies ?' Mr. Bree gave no specific name to his fern, but treated it as 
a variety of dilatatum, shortly and imperfectly distinguished from the 
latter.
On the contrary, Mr. Lowe published his fern unhesitatingly 
as an undescribed species, invented a specific name, and drew out a 
scientific character and elaborate description.
Mr. Lowe's name and 
description enjoyed the priority of a semi-publication through being 
read to the Cambridge Society ; but Mr. Bree's name had priority in 
printed publication.
Under these circumstances, were the question one of simple priority 
of name, it might be more advisable to adopt the name first fully pub- 
lished in print.
Unfortunately, that name was not imposed as a spe- 
cific name, nor was it accompanied by any properly constructed spe- 
cific diagnosis.
It thus seems to myself that Mr. Lowe's name of 
"fcenesecii" ought to be retained.
He first publicly announced the 
species, and he first printed a specific name and ample description of 
the species so announced.
Nothing but an earlier specijic name and 
description should be allowed to set aside those of Mr. Lowe, and 
Mr. Bree's name of "recurvum" was not such.
Here is my clash of opinion with Mr. Newman.
This gentleman 
would discard the name given to the fern by Mr. Lowe.
He does not 
570 
make this proposition on the only ground which could be taken up, 
namely, that Bree's name was first in print.
He cashiers the name 
on the inadmissible argument, that, in his individual opinion, Mr.
Lowe included two or more distinct species under the one name of 
foenesecii.
Were Mr. Newman's opinion unquestioned and establish- 
ed, there would still be a breach of botanical usage in re-naming the 
true typical form of Mr. Lowe's species, which he so carefully points 
out; though it might afford an ample reason for imposing a different 
specific name on the other form or forms, erroneously referred to the 
same species by Mr. Lowe.
Of this innovation on botanical usage I 
will presently speak by illustration, after premising my own more in- 
dividual objection against the suggestion or practice of Mr. Newman.
I consider Mr. Lowe to have been correct, not in error, when he 
included both a triangular and an oblong form of frond under one spe- 
cific name.
I must admit myself to be moving on to hazardous 
ground, in thus placing a negative against the views entertained by 
one who has so closely and so successfully studied the ferns of Bri- 
tain, and their synonymes ; and who has also inspected the very same 
specimens which have led me to this contradictory conclusion.
But 
facts are stubborn things, and Mr. Newman has made no allusion to 
the facts which seem to warrant the different conclusion on my part.
Among the specimens submitted to Mr. Newman's examination, from 
my own herbarium, were those collected in the Azores by myself.
Of these no mention is made by Mr. N., although they were the spe- 
cimens which originally showed me the identity of the English and 
Madeiran species, being intermediate in size and form between Eng- 
lish specimens, for which I was indebted to Mr. Newman, and 
Madeiran specimens, given to me by Dr. C.
Lemann, who knows 
perfectly well the species of Mr. Lowe.
This idea, once formed, was 
soon converted into conviction by inspection of the larger series of 
Madeiran specimens in the herbaria of Sir W.
J. Hooker and Dr. C.
Lemann, And by a letter recently received from Mr. Webb, whose 
knowledge of the Atlantic Flora is unequalled, I find that accomplish- 
ed botanist to have independently arrived at the same conclusion.
Now, it so happens, that among my half-dozen Azoric specimens, 
there is one of the oblong form, in which the lower pinnae are neither 
larger nor more compound than those above them ; and generally, the 
Azoric specimens have a more elongated frond than those of Britain.
Still, that one with the oblong outline, as well as others, possesses the 
three characters which Mr. Newman emphatically pronounces, in his 
last article on the Lastra^a foenesecii or recurva, to be those "which 
571 
immediately distinguish recurva from any other aristate Lastraea.
. .
. 
1 alkide to the minute, sessile, grain-like glands scattered over both 
surfaces of the frond : the jagged, eglandulose involucre: and the 
long, slender, laciniated scales of the stipes" (Phytol.
ii.
509).
It is 
true, that on this oblong variety the glands are few, and several of the 
scales scarcely laciniated at all ; but the presence of those specifie 
characters is nevertheless indisputable.
As to the jagged edges of the 
involucrum, I fear that will be found an untenable character, between 
dilatatum and foenesecii.
To sum up, I must consider Mr. Lowe's specific name to have all 
in its favour.
The species was first announced by that botanist, as 
something distinct from dilatatum and spinulosum.
Its first specific 
name was printed in his paper.
He showed unequivocally which was 
to be taken as the true typical form of his species.
The second, or 
oblong form may be still only a variety of the type, and not specifi- 
cally distinct.
But if distinct, that affords no sufficient reason for 
changing the specific name of the type.
I have now only to make good the charge of innovation on botani- 
cal usage, implied in Mr. Newman's reason for changing the name of 
Lowe's fern.
The pages of the 'Phytologist' have lately included 
communications about an alleged new species of Ranunculus, under 
name of R.
Lenormandi.
There can be no doubt whatever that this 
same species has been grouped with another under the common 
name of R.
hederaceus.
Twice, at least, in this country it has been 
published as a named variety of the latter.
But no botanist has sug- 
gested that the older name of R.
hederaceus should be quashed, as 
the name applied to " a group of species," or " purposely and advis- 
edly " to what are now received as two species.
Nor, in like argu- 
ment, do those botanists who distinguish R.
fluitans and R.
circina- 
tus as species, discard the name of R.
aquatilis : they merely restrict 
this latter to the more usual or typical forms, and apply new names 
to the others.
Under limitations dictated by convenience or certainty, I would 
agree with Mr. Newman's view, that a name given to a group of spe- 
cies, should be retained for the group ; each included species receiv- 
ing its own specially applied name.
But I cannot see that Mr.
Lowe's foenesecii should come under the rule, supposing such a rule 
in force, which is not the case now.

BOTANICAL SOCIETY OF EDINBURGH.
Thursday f \Uh May, 1846.
â€” Professor Balfour, President, in the 
chair.
Donations to the library and museum were announced from the 
Leopoldine Academy of Breslau, and from Alfred Greenwood, Esq.
The following gentlemen were elected Fellows of the Society, 
viz.
: â€” 
James Duncan, M.D., F.R.C.S.E., &c., 12, Heriot Row ; Rev. Dr.
Fleming, F.R.S.E., M.W.S., 54, India Street ; Robert H.
Gunning, 
Esq., 12, Argyll Square; and William Stark Dougall, Esq.
The following communications were read : â€” 
1. Biographical Sketch of the late Professor Graham, by Dr.
Ransford.
Robert Graham was the third son of the late Dr. Graham, of Stir- 
ling (afterwards Moir of Leckie), and of Mrs. Ann Stewart, daughter 
of the late Charles Stewart, Esq., of Appin.
His early education was 
obtained at Stirling.
He was apprenticed in 1804 to the late Mr.
Andrew Wood, F.R.C.S., Edinburgh, and became a licentiate of the 
College of Surgeons in 1808, and graduated at the University during 
the same year.
Dr. Graham then studied for twelve months in Lon- 
don, at St. Bartholomew's Hospital, and afterwards commenced prac- 
tice in Glasgow.
In 1812 he was appointed physician to the Infir- 
mary of that city and lecturer on Clinical Medicine, and published 
an essay on the continued fever, which at that time was epidemic in 
Glasgow.
Dr. Graham succeeded Dr. Brown as lecturer on Botany ; 
and in the following year, having been appointed by the government 
Professor of Botany in the University of Glasgow, he succeeded, in 
conjunction with some other gentlemen, in getting a Botanical Gar- 
den established, and took the principal share in its formation.
Dr.
Graham married the youngest daughter of David Carrick Buchanan, 
Esq., of Drumpellier and Mount Vernon.
On the decease of Dr.
Rutherford he was appointed by the Crown Regius Professor of Bo- 
tany and Keeper of the King's Garden, and by the patrons to the 
Professorship of Medicine and Botany in the University of Edinburgh.
Soon after his appointment, and principally through his exertions, the 
present Botanical Garden was formed ; and with the able assistance 
of Mr. William M'Nab, all the trees, shrubs, and plants, were removed 
from the garden at Leith Walk to their present situation.
He also 
prevailed upon the government to increase the annual allowance to 
the institution (which is still insufficient, and only half the sum which 
573 
is given to a move private one in Dublin), and expended considerable 
sums tiom his own resources to maintain its efficiency.
Dr. Graham's 
character as a clinical physician and private practitioner, was distin- 
guished by unbending integrity and honour.
He succeeded in greatly 
interesting the students in botanical science, by giving many prizes 
and making botanical excursions.
Dr. Ransford then noticed his plan 
of conducting the course, gave some anecdotes of his journeys, and 
alluded to his annual descriptions of new plants flowering in Edin- 
burgh ; the great interest he displayed in the welfare of the Botanical 
Society, of which he was an original member, and thrice President; 
the history of the formation of the Society, and his contributions to 
its Transactions ; his papers read to the Royal Society on the gam- 
boge plant ; and his researches into the nomenclature and botanical 
sources of the articles of the Materia Medica.
He was most attentive 
to the interests of the University, and supported all the measures of 
reform in medical education carried into effect between the years 1822 
and 1836.
In 1840 Dr. Graham was elected President of the Royal 
College of Physicians ; he was a member of most of the scientific so- 
cieties in this city, and President of many of them.
From over-tax- 
ing his strength during one of his botanical excursions in 1843, he 
dated the commencement of his last illness.
His case was an obscure 
one.
The town council, at his request, appointed Dr. Joseph Hooker 
to be his assistant.
Although in a very weak state, he introduced 
him to the class on the morning of the 5th of May, 1845.
This was 
the last occasion on which he visited the gardens.
Dr. Ransford then 
gave anecdotes of his generosity, and resignation during his illness.
He was removed to Coldoch, in Perthshire, on the 24th of July, and 
expired on the 7th of August.
The disease was ascertained to be a 
malignant tumour resting on the dorsal vertebrae, and pressing upon 
the thoracic duct, vessels, and nerves.
He was buried on the 13th in 
the private burying-ground of Leckie, belonging to his brother Charles 
A. Moir, Esq. Dr.
Graham's whole life was distinguished by up- 
rightness of conduct, cheerfulness of disposition, combined with real 
kindheartedness.
He was very energetic and industrious, most con- 
scientious in the discharge of every duty, and beloved by all who 
were acquainted with him.

ing, with lofty bushes of heliotrope covered with blossoms, and gera- 
niums in full flower ; an avenue of young Phytolacca dioica, and other 
symptoms of a warm climate.
The first crop of peas we find is over, 
beans are now in perfection, strawberries in fruit, sweet roses in blos- 
som.
The wild plants are coming forward rapidly, the limestone 
hills are covered with the beautiful Iris sisyrinchium and sambucina, 
though the latter is not so abundant ; Ophrys vespifera or lutea 
and arachnites, Orchis Morio, several Antirrhinums, Cistuses, the de- 
licate Ulex australis, several Rutas, Cerinthe aspera, or a variety with 
purple blossoms striped with white (that I got in Italy and Greece was 
tinged with yellow) ; several species of Calendula, Bellis annua, syl- 
vestris and perennis, the last the least common, the beautiful Narcis- 
sus Bulbocodium, Ornithogalum umbellatura, Vinca major, in great 
profusion and beauty ; Cynoglossa, Lupinus, lUecebrum, Paronychia, 
Arum arisarum and maculatum (or one which comes very near it), 
Aristolochia longa, Asphodelus ramosus and fistulosus, Oxalis tube- 
rosus and corniculatus, Genista triacanthos.
Anemone ranunculoides, 
and many other plants are now in perfection, as is the delicate annual 
fern, Gymnogramma leptophylla.
In the hedges, Rubus fruticosus, 
Smilax nigra and aspera are abundant, the two latter in fruit.
Fica- 
ria ranunculoides is very large.
Urtica membranacea and urens, 
both abundant.
I have not observed any other species of this genus.
One of the most showy plants in the gardens at present is Antholyza 
oethiopica, which grows in large beds in damp, shady situations.
Calla 
oethiopica is also in great abundance, and very fine.
Palms, bam- 
boos, Dracaena Draco, and other tropical plants, also flourish in the 
open air." 
In a subsequent letter to Dr. Neill, Mr. Trevelyan gives a full list 
of the plants in flower on 28th of March.
In this letter Mr. Trevelyan 
writes â€” " The Cynomorium coccineum, formerly known in medicine 
under the name of Fungus melitensis, is a very common plant, very 
showy, and in great abundance on the roots of the shrubby Cistus.
I 
hear that a company has been formed in Spain for the cultivation of 
the sugar-cane.
Many things might be cultivated, were it not for the 
indolence and unenterprising nature of the people.
No railroad has 
been commenced nor determined on, and scarcely any improvements 
are going on in the country." 
Dr. Balfour read a letter which he had received fi-om Dr. Cleghorn, 
a Fellow of the Society, dated Teerthully, 27th March, in which he 
states that since the end of October he had made a tour through the 
north-western division of Mysore, and collected a great number of in- 
575 
teresting plants, especially in the western Ghats.
Coloured drawings 
of most of them had been executed by a native (Mahratta) draughts- 
man who accompanied him.
Specimens of many of the plants he 
purposes to send to the herbarium of the University of Edinburgh, 
under the charge of the Botanical Society.
Dr. Balfour also read a letter from Dr. H.
Giraud, also an active 
member of the Society, dated Bombay, 26th February.
In this letter 
Dr. Gu'aud gave an account of the Horticultural Society's Garden at 
Bombay, of which he is Secretary, and alluded generally to the na- 
ture of the vegetation in the neighbourhood.
He also noticed the 
mode of instruction adopted in the Medical College at Bombay, in 
which he lectures on Chemistry, Materia Medica and Botany.

involucral leaves with a broad base, and long, taper point.
Our plant 
flowers later than F.
germanica, and is rarely obseiTed in the midst 
of fields, where F.
germanica abounds.
The scent of the latter is very 
feeble : the spinous points of the flower-scales yellow, or very rarely, 
orpiment.
The leaves of our plant are smoother above, and rather 
woolly, than silvery with short down, as those of F.

Remarks on Equisetum variegatum, S^c.
By D.
Moore, Esq., A.L.S., &c.
In the number of the ' Phytologist ' for the present month (Phytol.
ii.
553), 1 observe a note on Equisetum variegatum, Weber and Mohr, 
where it is stated that 1 " still continue to regard that plant as dis- 
tinct from the prostrate form called E.
arenarium," the plant figured 
in 'English Botany' imder the name of E.
variegatum.
That such 
is the case I admit, and farther, T have no longer any hesitation in as- 
serting that our Dublin canal plant is identical with the Killarney 
plant, E.
Wilsoni, Newman.
At page 40 of the ' British Ferns,' you 
say you " cannot concur in this opinion without additional evidence 
in its support," which I shall now endeavour to afford.
It is this : 
in March, 1845, I wrote to a friend residing at Killarney, requesting 
he would search the shores of the Lake near Muckruss, for the Equi- 
setum Mr. Wilson had previously discovered there, at the same time 
affording him all the detail 1 thought likely to assist him in finding it.
In the course of a fortnight afterwards, I was gratified on receiving a 
letter from him, inclosing specimens of the plant, with a description 
of the locality where he found it, which perfectly agreed with that 
577 
given by Mr. Wilson.
I immediately wrote back to my friend, and 
begged he would at once send me some good plants to cultivate, 
which he kindly did, and on receiving them I had no difficulty in iden- 
tifying them with the canal plant.
To prove this, as well as to afford 
others an opportunity of judging for themselves, I had plants from 
both localities planted together, where they have now been growing 
upwards of one year, and they continue to bear as much general re- 
semblance to each other as any two things of the same kind in nature 
can well do, but you know there are those who go so far as to affirm 
that no two eggs laid by the same fowl are exactly alike.
E, Mackaii 
and E.
arenarium are also growing along with them, each species, or 
permanent variety, whichever you will, retaining its respective cha- 
racters without the slightest appearance of altering.
In Ireland I 
have not yet seen intermediate states of either collected by any bota- 
nist, but the English specimens of E.
arenarium from sand-hills at 
the mouth of the Mersey, appear rather different from the Portmarnock 
plant, inasmuch as they are considerably larger in all their parts.
The 
Scotch plant from the Sands of Barry is identical with the Portmar- 
nock one.
The distinguishing characters which mark the hyemale section of 
British Equiseta have been so ably detailed in the second edition of 
the * British Ferns,' that I have nothing new to add to support the 
opinion of the plants in question being permanently distinct forms of 
the genus.
I may, however, be permitted to ask the natural conclu- 
sion likely to be arrived at, when we thus find that they occur in lo- 
calities widely apart, precisely under similar circumstances, retaining 
all their respective characters, and that they remain unaltered when 
submitted to the test of cultivation.
Surely we cannot think them 
accidental varieties, nor permanent local varieties, because neither 
changes of soil or situation essentially affect them.
The only remain- 
ing test, then, to prove them to be what we are in the habit of regard- 
ing as species, is, to try whether their reproductive organs will perpe- 
tuate the same forms without any sensible degree of change ; and 
this, I venture to conjecture, will be the case when fairly tested.
I 
have no wish, as you observe, that any ne\^ name should be added.
I am perfectly satisfied now that they are clearly defined, and have 
no doubt of the correctness of your views in referring the semi-aqua- 
tic plant to the true E.
variegatum of Weber and Mohr.
E. arena- 
rium is probably the best name we could have to distinguish the 
578 
' English Botany ' plant by, and one which in all fairness may be 
employed, at least until the synonymes of early authors respecting the 
plant be better unravelled.

â€” In July last year, while on a ramble in com- 
pany with my friend, Mr. James Adie, I had the pleasure of finding a 
solitary specimen of this rare and lovely floral gem near the summit, 
on the south side of the white hill of Auchter-house (one of the Sid- 
laws), growing among some small larch trees.
We culled the speci- 
men, leaving the root; but as a very heavy rain fell at the time, and 
we had previously had a good soaking during the ramble, we did not 
continue long to search for other specimens.
It would appear that 
this plant is frequently confounded with the P.
media and P.
minor.
I am, however, quite sure that the plant I found was the true P.
ro- 
tundifolia.
P. minor grows very abundantly in the woods in this 
quarter.
Alchemilla alpina.
â€” A small patch of this interesting alpine plant 
grows in a sheltered hollow on the top of a low hill among the Sid- 
laws, where I first found it during the summer of 1 844.
It appears 
to be indigenous, maintaining its situation amongst close-growing 
heather and matted Trichostomum lanuginosum.
Viola lutea, var.
y. â€” A few days ago I observed on the top of the 
white hill what appears to me to be the variety y.
of Viola lutea, 
found by Mr. S.
Murray on the Isle of Arran.
It is distinguished by 
its broadly ovate, subcoÂ»iaceous leaves and deep yellow flowers.

On a monstrosity of Cardamine pratensis.
By Geo. Lawson, Esq.
A FEW days ago, by the margin of a peat-bog at the Sidlaw hills, 
in Forfarshire, I found an instance of abnormal development in the 
Cardamine pratensis, somewhat similar to that written of by Dr.
Bromfield, at page 241 of the present volume of the ' Phytologist.' 
Several of the seed-pods on the lower part of the corymb were 
changed from their usual linear to a subulate form, and on opening 
them, T found a little below the middle of the pod, a mass of petaloid 
laminae, completely filling that part of it ; and above these a number 
of ovules, arranged in the ordinary manner along either side of the 
vessel.
On the upper part of the corymb was a flower, with petals 
having a foliaceous appearance, but on the margins having a true 
petaloid character : that flower had, before opening, been enclosed 
in an ovate-elliptical seed-vessel, such as those mentioned by Dr. B., 
but the petals &c.
"had burst from their confinement at the commis- 
sures, * * the valves of the pod answering exactly by their 
position to the true calyx." It was furnished with the proper num- 
ber of anthers (six), but two of these were placed on one filament : 
the filaments of the stamina were much swollen, as indeed were all 
the other parts of this monstrous combination of blossom and seed- 
vessel.
It also contained a germen of about half an inch in length, of 
a tapering form, being thickest at the basal extremity : this germen 
was hollow, but I could detect no ovules in it.
The other flowers of 
the corymb were in all respects of the normal form.
I observed seve- 
ral minute caterpillars of a bright scarlet colour on the inside of the 
petals of this latter flower: might these be the cause of the deformity?
Insects are often found to give curious forms to leaves and flowers.
Sir William Jackson Hooker, in speaking of this plant, remarks, â€” 
" Sometimes found double, in which state the leaflets are known to 
produce new plants, when they come in contact with the ground, 
while still attached to the parent plant," (Brit.
Flora, ed.
5. i.
25).
Is 
the state here referred to that spoken of by Dr. Bromfield ?

Note on Arenaria i^liginosa {Alsine stricta).
By J.
Backhouse, jun.
It may not be uninteresting to some of the readers of the ' Phyto- 
logist ' to know that in the early part of last month, in company with 
G. S.
Gibson, Jas. H.
Tuke (of York), and my father, T found several 
plants of Arenaria uliginosa [Alsine stricta) in the old locality on 
580 
Widdy-bank Fell, Teesdale.
It was not in flower, and we saw no 
trace of it until we had reached the exact spot where we previously 
found it.
Equisetum umbrosum was abundant on the Yorkshire side 
of the Tees, near Winch Bridge.

Death of Mr. Tliomas Edmondston.
Twelve months ago we mentioned Mr. Edmondston's appoint- 
ment to the Harold, as botanist to the expedition for exploring the 
north-west coast of America; it is now our duty to record his decease 
under the melancholy circumstances stated in the following extract 
from the Morning Chronicle of June the 11th, 1846.
Letters written 
by Mr. Edmondston, when full of health and spirits, were received in 
England by several of his friends almost simultaneously with the ap- 
pearance of the paragraph in the Chronicle.
" Melancholy Accident on Board H.M.S. Harold, in the Pacijic.
Letters from some of the officers of that ship, and her tender the Pan- 
dora, have been received, dated April 24, 1846.
The Harold, Capt.
Kellet, had been to the Galapagos, and returned to the coast on the 
2'2nd of February.
While off the mouth of the small river Sua, about 
five miles from Atacaraez, an accident occurred which has deprived 
the expedition of one of its most valuable officers, just at the period 
when his services were beginning to be required.
A party had been 
employed on shore, and on returning to the boats a loaded rifle hap- 
pened to be touched by one of them when jumping into a boat, wad- 
ing through the surf â€” it went off", and the ball first struck the arm of 
the clerk, slightly wounding him, and then passed through the head 
of Mr. Edmondston, the botanist of the expedition, killing him on 
the spot.
His death was instantaneous.
The loss will be greatly 
felt, as Mr. Edmondston was an exceedingly amiable and talented 
young man, deservedly regarded by his messmates and all on board 
the Harold ; and although but twenty-three years of age, had greatly 
distinguished himself in his profession.
He had lately been elected 
botanical professor of the Andersonian University of Glasgow ; he 
was also the author of a botanical work, the ' Flora of Shetland.' His 
remains were buried on shore on the following day, with funeral ho- 
nors, and attended by the greater part of the officers of the expedition.
The Harold and Pandora had commenced their surveys of the coast 
of California, and were occupied in March last in the Bay of Choco."

A Notice of the Botany of Mildenhall.
By J.
Townsend, Esq.
As the * Phytologist ' expressly states one of its objects in view, to 
ybe the notice of localities of rare and remarkable plants, I have drawn 
up a short list of those observed about the neighbourhood of Milden- 
hall, on the eastern borders of Suffolk, during two days botanizing at 
' that place, in the beginning of the present month.
The list must ne- 
cessarily be imperfect, being the result of only two days observation, 
and this, too, chiefly confined to those plants peculiar to this neigh- 
bourhood and other parts of Suffolk.
The Flora of this part of Suffolk appears so peculiar and remark- 
able as to deserve a short description.
Immediately on leaving the 
town I was struck with the peculiar appearance of vegetation ; the 
subsoil is chalk, covered over by vast quantities of sand and gravel, 
which give the character to the neighbourhood.
On the high land 
the chalk is frequently seen at the surface.
In many fields, sand forms 
the only soil, and scarcely a stone or rolled pebble is to be met with; 
it may easily be imagined that many plants would find but poor sus- 
tenance on so dry and unstable a foundation, and such is found to be 
the case, for many of even our common plants are rarely, if at all, to 
be met with.
In such places the farmer need bestow little labour in 
weeding, for there are no weeds to be seen ; and the corn is dried up 
and withered, or has never struggled to the surface.
A great part of the land is totally uncultivated, and the barren 
heaths are ploughed only by the rabbits, who here find a suitable 
dwelling-place, but not unmolested, as persons are employed solely in 
destroying them.
There are many chalk and gravel-pits on these 
heaths.
The open woods consist principally of fir, and produce little 
else but nettles, stonecrop and chervil {Anthriscus vulgaris)^ which 
last is one of the most frequent weeds, both in the woods and on the 
heaths, encircling the rabbit-burrows with its welcome shade, and 
climbing the sides and tops of the mud walls in luxuriant profusion.
But what struck me particularly was the occurrence of Phleum are- 
narium, fine plants of which are met with at every step, and Carex 
arenaria, which creeps along the dry heath, binding firmly the loose 
sand and gravel ; these plants I had only known as natives of the 
sea-shore, and on first beholding them I almost listened for the roar- 
ing of the waves, and sought the cool sea-breeze to protect me from 
the piercing rays of the hottest noon-day sun.
I should much wish 
to know if these two last-named plants are to be met with constantly 
between this and the sea-shore of Suffolk.
I should imagine such 
Vol. II.
4 c 
582 
would be case, and geologically considered, it would offer an interest- 
ing problem with regard to geographical distribution.
I never before noticed so clearly the creeping character of C.
are- 
naria : along the even ground are seen long streaks of green continu- 
ing in a straight line for four yards or more, the rhizoma creeping on- 
wards and throwing up its numerous shoots along the whole length.
In the corn-fields immediately around Mildenhall I found sparingly 
Veronica triphyllos, though every plant was so burnt up as to crumble 
in the hand ; and on the heath, under the shade of the furze, Veronica 
verna, also withered, and in this state difficult to distinguish from 
dwarf specimens of V.
arvensis, whose habit it closely resembles.
It 
must be understood I am speaking of the north, east and south sides 
of Mildenhall, occupying a space of about three miles as a radius, and 
as yet principally of the low land.
There still exists here and there in patches, some bog land and fen, 
although at a former period there must have been much more, parti- 
cularly near the river.
Beneath the village of Eriswell, east of Mil- 
denhall, there is some good fen land and sandy bogs: in these 1 
sought earnestly for Sturmia Loeselii, but without success ; those 
plants that I met with will be found in the list below.
On the high land principally, I gathered Silene Otites and conica, 
Phleum Bcehmeri, Artemisia campestris, Scleranthus perennis, with 
others.
I had no time to search the ponds and ditches.
I have already swelled these notes to a greater extent than I had 
intended, and will now give the list of plants worthy of notice ; but 
I hope the above remarks may not prove without interest, indepen- 
dent of the verification of localities of the rarer plants.

Notice of the ^London Journal of Botany,' No 55, dated July, 1846.
(Continued from page, 550.) 
The contents are: "Botanical Information." "Enumeration of 
plants collected by Sir Robert Schomburgk, in British Guiana;" 
by George Bentham, Esq.
" New Hepaticse ;" by Thomas Taylor, 
M.D.
The first seven leaves are devoted to the " Botanical Information," 
which comprises miscellaneous notes on South Africa, by M.
Zeyher ; 
with some " Notes on the Botany of the Pyrenees," by Mr. Spruce.
As 
the Robertsonian Saxifrages have lately excited some attention, in 
consequence of Mr. C.
C. Babington's rather hasty statements respect- 
ing imaginary differences between those of Ireland and the Pyrenees, 
it may be interesting to the readers of the ' Phytologist,' to learn that 
Mr. Spruce fiiids those of the Pyrenees running through the same 
changes which had been so completely established by Mr. Andrews, 
in reference to the Irish plants.
It always appeared very strange that 
Mr. Babington should have visited the localities of the Irish Saxi- 
frages, and yet there found nothing in exception to the descriptions 
which he put forth, while Mr. Andrews should find and distribute 
such ample proofs of their inaccuracy.
It is more easy to understand 
the errors with respect to the Pyrenean examples, perhaps few in 
number, and examined only in herbaria.
The case shows how care- 
ful scientific men ought to be in making and circulating positive 
585 
statements on merely negative evidence.
To assume and assert 
that things do not exist, simply because they have not been detected 
by a certain individual, is a rash proceeding, where everything else 
renders their existence probable.
It is high time that the Annals, 
which gave such prominence, and its circulation to the error, should 
correct the false evidence which was inadvertently spread thereby.
On these Saxifrages, Mr. Spruce writes thus : 
" I must not omit to state that I gathered Saxifraga umbrosa, hir- 
suta and Geum growing together, and I wish I could say, not pass- 
ing into each other.
I feel satisfied, however, that if we will have two 
species, we must, to be consistent, admit three, the three above named, 
which are admirably though briefly characterised in the second edi- 
tion of Koch's Synopsis.
I have seen few Saxifragae in the Pyrenees, 
which might not safely be referred to one or the other of these, yet 
there are some which appear exactly intermediate between S, um- 
brosa and S hirsuta ; for example, I have observed a state possessing 
an expanded and cuneate petiole as in the former, and yet hairy on 
the entire upper surface ; and another with leaves oblong-rotundate, 
tapering suddenly into the petiole (as in S.
hirsuta) and yet the latter 
merely ciliate at the margins.
As to the cuttings of the edges of the leaves, all the three vary from 
crenate to inciso-serrate.
(See Phytol.
ii, 380 and 381, for the facts 
and references in the discussion about the Saxifrages of Ireland.) 
The rest of the No. is occupied with Mr. Bentham's descriptions of 
South American plants, and Dr. Taylor's account of the new Junger- 
mannias, from various distant lands.

J. B.
in 'Gardener's Chronicle.' 
For the most part the Botanical contents of No. 113, are useful or 
valuable contributions to science, creditable to their contributors or 
to editorial selection.
But they are not such as present passages 
adapted for separate perusal, as illustrative extracts.
From this 
general approval we must make an exception of some parts of the 
notice of the ' Flora Calpensis ;' the reviewer having unfortunately 
selected for his commendation, and for extract, just those particular 
matters in the work reviewed, which are most imperfect and untrust- 
worthy : we refer to the habitats of the species in other parts of the 
world, and the numerical summaries founded thereon.
Whatever opi- 
nion we may form of the ' Flora Calpensis' in other respects, we may 
confidently say that the holding up of such exceedingly imperfect 
notices, as " a very valuable addition to the list of species, showing at a 
glance the countries in which each plant has been observed," is a serious 
mistake on the part of the reviewer.
We do not suppose that the 
author intended them to be so received; for he expressly qualifies the 
numerical results, by saying " as far as the extent of my inquiry has 
enabled me to judge ;" and this qualification was really very neces- 
sary.
But when these same results are blindly copied by a reviewer, 
who omits the requisite qualification, and substitutes a high eulogy 
in place thereof, they can only mislead and confuse, instead of yield- 
ing suggestive ideas, confessedly requiring more research.
The importance of the subject may justify a reprint of the few lines, 
on ' the potato fungus.' " Mr. Moore of Glasuevin, has sent me this 
morning a leaf of a potato clothed with our old enemy, Botrytis infes- 
tans, from potatoes in the Royal Botanic Garden, Dublin.
Every- 
thing seems to tend to a repetition of the ravages of last year.
I can 
persuade nobody here that there are any [reason for] fears, and all 
advice is vain." The existence of some plants infested with the 
Botrytis infestans, really does not appear any strong reason for fears, 
so long as it does not spread largely, as was the case last year.
At 
the date of writing these remarks, we have been using this year's 
potatoes from the open garden, full three weeks, and not a single 
diseased tuber has been found among those dug up : on the contrary, 
they are found to be remarkably healthy and good, in the ground to 
which we allude, on the south side of London.
But should continued 
cold and wet weather follow the dry heat of June, as was the case 
last year, we may then be too successful in persuading people to fear.

the circulation in Chara ?" 
The "Botany of Scinde" is an attractive title; but the contents of 
the short letter on that subject, yield very little information.
The 
writer enumerates Tamarix gallica and Rumex acutus, as found 
there ; but we must say that a sight of the specimens would be more 
satisfactory than their names in the letter of a botanist, who seems 
somewhat young in the study.
The reply to the query, on the faith 
of Dutrochet's experiments is, that magnetism does not influence the 
circulation in Chara, and that " there is no relation between the mag- 
netic force and the vital force producing this circulation." This con- 
clusion, however, is much more comprehensive than the experiments 
would seem reasonably to justify.

Junghuhn (a transla- 
tion, continued from a former No.) 
Though these two papers may be held good of their class, they be- 
long to a class or style of writing which is seldom of any value in 
science.
Only a botanist who is already well acquainted with plants, 
and their distribution in the neighbouring countries, can be prepared 
to select for record, those facts which are most important to the pro- 
gress of science.
In the absence of this previous preparation, he 
must notice and tell what he saw at random, often passing by the new 
and important, to dwell upon the trivial and familiar.
Dr. Alexander 
enjoyed the advantage of an excellent knowledge of European plants ; 
having studied them in various countries, in a state of nature, and 
also as dried specimens in the library and museum.
He knew when 
he detected any species which was a novelty to the recorded Flora of 
Styina ; and conversant with the differences of identical species, 
under changed conditions of soil and climate, he keeps clear from the 
common error of merely local botanists, in mistaking each trifling 
variation of character for marks of a new species.
Of late, it has 
been attempted to conform our lists of British plants, to the con- 
tracted views of certain Swedish and German botanists, acute 
observers of trifling differences, among the plants of narrow area.
Dr.
588 
Alexander specifies some instances of spurious species which are 
recognized or invented by botanists of that school ; and as the evil is 
spreading into England, it may not be out of place to quote a passage 
or two, in relation to this subject.
" With regard to the Erysimum, I may say as I did of the Potentil- 
las and Primulas, that there is no drawing an exact line between the 
different forms in the genus.
E. carniolicum, odoratum, strictum, 
repandura, crepidifolium, change their names with every herbarium 
one looks into." ....
" The fact is, that all five are one and the 
same species.
Books are usually written by chamber botanists, who 
receive only the exti'eme forms, characteristic specimens, and hence 
arises this multiplicity of species." 
Again, " Bohemian botanists, Tausch and Co., who live in a coun- 
try where there is very little variety of climate and situation, seem in- 
capable of conceiving the vei-satility of plants in accommodating them- 
selves to circumstances.
A more remarkable instance of this qual- 
ity is seen in the Moehringia, which on hot, dry limestone rocks 
is M.
Ponae, and in the crevices and under the shadow of bushes M.
muscosa.
In ravines which are constantly damp and shady I have 
remarked the same transition of M.
trinervia into M.
heterophylla.
A 
very careful and excellent botanist, Mr. Zehentner, has collected 
transition forms with as much care as others throw them away ; among 
Arenarias, Campanulas, Primulas and other genera, he has shown that 
great number of so-called species are only varieties." 
We heartily wish that a number of English botanists, would set to 
work to collect varieties and intermediates.
The accumulation and 
preservation of such physical evidences, is the best antidote to the 
vanity of species-making, and to the less excuseable dishonesty in 
science, which sometimes prompts authors and editors, to suppress facts 
of this kind, when they happen to conflict with the opinions which 
they have themselves too hastily printed.

Occurrence of a new Variety of Silene injlata in Fifeshire.
By George Lawson, Esq., 
On the flowery banks of the river Eden, at the delightful spot call- 
ed Eden-grove, where, under the cooling shade of the waving trees, 
and round a lovely luxuriance of Geranium pratense, Iris pseud- 
acorus, Valeriana officinalis, and other floral beauties, may frequently 
be seen the wary angler, eyeing the lively trout as it nibbles his 
bait, I find a variety of the Silene inflata, with the stem, and 
leaves (on both sides) covered with a rough pubescence, while the 
peduncle and calyx are perfectly glabrous.
I presume this variety to 
be intermediate betwixt the normal form and the variety &., which has 
been found "near Cromer, Norfolk" and " Banks of the Clyde." The 
normal form is always wholly glabrous, while the var.
&. has the 
" calyx, stem and leaves downy." This variety, which I believe to be 
a new one (not having observed it previously noticed), generally grows 
very luxuriantly here ; much more so than the normal form : indeed I 
have not seen instances of pubescence in plants of S.
inflata, of the 
ordinary size.
It may be worthy of remark that I have not been able 
to discover different degrees of pubescence, or anything approaching 
to an " almost glabrous state.

Dron,by Cupar, Fifeshire, July, 1846.
P. S.
I think this variety may be common although hitherto over- 
looked, and am almost certain that I have seen it by the road-side 
to the westward of Dundee in Forfarshire, while residing there, al- 
though I then passed it by without notice.
May I ask local botanists, 
(and I am glad to observe these are on the increase), to look out for 
the plant at that place, as I may not have occasion to pass that way 
soon.

Supposed transformation of Oats into Rye.
By Joseph Sidebotham, Esq., 
The well known statement of Dr. Weissenborn, and others, of a 
plan for the transformation of Oats into Rye, must be familiar to 
every reader of the * Phytologist,' but perhaps few have thought it 
worth the trouble, either to verify or contradict it.
Having seen the 
statement often repeated, like advertisements of quack medicines, and 
recommending " only one triaV to be convinced of its truth, I deter- 
mined to try the experiment.
Vol. II.

The oats ought to be sown in June, but it was not till August that 
I sowed a small plot, having previously examined the seed, to see 
that no rye was mixed with it.
The grain soon sprung up, and to follow Dr. Weissenborn's direc- 
tion, I cut it down twice before Christmas, and thinking that by cut- 
ting it again, I might convert it into barley, or perchance Indian com, 
I cut about half of the crop again in February, and again a portion 
in March.
Being rather impatient to see the result, a few days ago I gathered 
stems of each of the series, and slit them up, to see how far the rye 
was developed.
In the one cut twice, the panicle was fully formed, and 
just ready to burst from its sheath, but it was nothing like rye and 
very much like oats.
I next tried those cut three times, with the 
same success, only the panicle was not so fully developed, and much 
lower in the sheath.
In those cut four times, the panicle was very 
young indeed, only just distinguishable, but it would have required 
a considerable stretch of imagination to think that it would ever be- 
come rye : should any of it do so, I shall not neglect to inform 
your readers.
Should any of your readers have been more fortunate in the trans- 
mutation, perhaps they will oblige us with a detail of their experi- 
ments.
Joseph Sidebotham.
Manchester, June 11th, 1846.
[Dr. Weissenbom would perhaps attribute the apparent failure 
of the above experiment to his instructions not having been followed 
to the letter : since, in order to insure success, he insists on the ab- 
solute necessity of the oats being sown about the end of June : he 
certainly says nothing about their being sown later than that time ; 
but in all experiments, undertaken with the object of verifying the 
statements of previous observers, their own directions should be 
scrupulously followed.

Extract of a letter from the late Mr. Edmondston to Mr. Sidebotham.
I RECEIVED a letter a few days ago from Mr. Edmondston, and as 
some of the readers of the ' Phytologist ' may feel interested, I send 
you an extract from it.
The letter is dated " H.
M. S.
Harold, on 
passage from Valparaiso to Callao, December, 8th, 1845," and was 
591 
addressed via "Panama." After various remarks not of general 
interest, he says, " The ship to which I am attached is a frigate, of 
26 guns, and we are accompanied by the Pandora, a brigantine of 
320 tons, as tender.
Our destination is to survey the coasts of 
Central America, CaUfornia and the N.
W. coast, including the 
Columbia river, north to Nootka, this will take about five years.
I suppose we shall return by India, and the Cape of Good Hope ; 
we stayed a day at Teneriffe, where I made an excursion, but the 
season was unfavourable for plants: some scarce British species 
were abundant, as Polypogon Monspeliensis, Bromus maximus, Cen- 
taurea solstitialis, &c.
Our next resting place was Rio de Janeiro : 
here we staid twelve days, and I made a good collection of the mag- 
nificent plants and insects of that splendid country.
We now steered 
our course to the Falkland islands : there we staid twelve days also, but 
the weather was so rigorous, storms and snow, that little could be 
done.
Some plants the most interesting of which is the Tussack 
grass, were procured, the Lichens are very fine, especially the Strictae; 
but owing to the season iew Phanerogamia were in perfection.
After 
a very tedious and gloomy passage we reached Valparaiso on the 
16th of last month: I immediately hired horses and started for the 
interior ; here I spent a week most delightfully, botanizing among the 
mountains.
The climate of Chili is delightful, very dry, and in con- 
sequence scarcely any Cryptogamia, and few insects, but the Flora is 
most beautiful ; the most abundant genera are Epilobium, (Enothera, 
Calceolaria, Fuchsia, Cynarum, Gentiana, Convolvulus, Mesembry- 
anthemum, Papaver, Lilium, Hesperis, Oxalis, Lobelia, and hosts of 
Compositae.
1 made a very large collection, and enjoyed myself ex- 
tremely.
We left Valparaiso on the 4th inst., and are now on our way to 
Callao where we shall stay a few days, thence proceed to the Gallapagos 
Archipelago, and thence up the coast towards Panama.
Our route 
hitherto has been such, that except a few at the Falkland islands, 
I have got no mosses : as we get north, we shall have lots of oppor- 
tunities for getting them.
I have by no means lost any of my old 
relish for these ' atoms of creation,' and I trust when I see old Eng- 
land again (if God spare me) to give you some fine ones from the 
Rocky mountains." 
The above is the principal part of the letter which will be of 
interest to your readers.

Occurrence of Lepidium Draha, near the Croydon Railway.
By William Ilott, Esq.
I DISCOVERED the Other day, a profusion of Lepidium Draba, near 
the Croydon railway, about a mile from the Dartmouth Arms : the 
spot may either be found by keeping the sides of the remaining por- 
tions of the old Croydon canal, till you come to a house near the end 
of the canal, in the occupation of Mr. Cutbush, or by leaving the road 
over Forest-hill from Peckham Rye, and taking a foot path, which 
leads direct to the said house of Mr. Cutbush.
Abundance of the 
plant will be found among the rubbish, near the first bridge over the 
Croydon railway.
As there appear hitherto to have been only 
three known stations for the above plant, the knowledge of a new 
station will probably be interesting to our metropolitan botanists, as 
it is so easily accessible.
I have procured abundant specimens, for 
those who may apply for them.

On the occurrence of the White-flowered Variety of Orchis 
latifolia in Glen Isla.
By W.
Ogilvie, Esq.
A FEW days ago, a friend who had been on a ramble (though not 
strictly speaking a botanical one) in the Highlands, handed me a few 
specimens of the white-flowered variety of Orchis latifolia, gathered 
by him in Glen Isla.
The variety is I believe one of rare occurrence, 
only one locality being recorded for it in Hooker's Flora, viz., Sands 
of Barry, where however, I never had the pleasure of meeting with it.

Mode of preserving the Color of Flowers.
By F.
J. Ogden, Esq.
This spring I have adopted a plan of preserving flowers, which 
may be new to some of your readers, as it has proved to be to the 
botanical gentlemen to whom I have showed it here.
I will pro- 
ceed to explain how it is done.
You take the flower or leaf and press 
it for two or three hours, then gum it on the paper, upon which it 
593 
is to remain.
Afterwards return it to the press to dry.
In this way 
the colors of the flowers are kept.
The following are a few of the 
flowers I have tried successfully.
Snowdrop Wall-flower Jonquil 
Crocus Pyrus Japonica Narcissus 
Primrose Polyanthus Primula cortusoides 
Heart's-ease Yellow Auricula 
I find this plan to do better than any other I have tried.
The 
flowers preserved in this way are less liable to be lost or injured.
The color of the leaves too keeps very well, nor do they shrivel, as 
as they often do, when pressed loose in a book.

[It must be borne in mind, that, although the Editor is always 
willing to publish recommendations of this kind, still he is in no way 
responsible for them.
On a former occasion he incurred great blame 
for publishing recommendations on this subject, which other corre- 
spondents were led to try, and found utterly worthless.
He has not 
the pleasure of a personal acquaintance with Mr. Ogden, but ven- 
tures to hope that the recommendation now before him, has not been 
published without abundant proof of the eflacacy of the plan.
It is 
as impossible for the Editor to test the value of such recommenda- 
tions, as to examine and compare the characters of plants, which may 
be casually contrasted.
Let it therefore be distinctly understood that 
every contribution is like a separate work : the responsibility is with 
the author alone.

By Dr. Dewar.
" Its habit when growing is very different from the C.
arvensis.
The leaves are sinuated rather than pinnatifid, not crisped and curled, 
694 
but nearly flat, and shai-ply spinous, with a decurrence of spines from 
each leaf.
The involucre differs in nothing from the C.

Further notice of Lindley's ' Vegetable Kingdom.'' 
In a former number (Phytol.
ii.
521), M^e gave a review of this ela- 
borate work, in which we expressed a doubt as to the correctness of 
the numbers assigned to the aggregate of genera and species.
Our 
observations have induced the author to revise these various statements, 
and he has sent the following important corrections.
" 1st.
In the body of the work the number of species of Berberids, is 
misprinted 10 instead of 100.
" 2nd.
In the table of genera and species at p.
797, the drawing 
up of which being a mere mechanical operation, was entrusted to an 
assistant, there are several small errors.
In order 11-3 the number of 
genera is 12 instead of 2.
In order 213, the number of genera 
should be 38 instead of 30.
In order 273, alliance 50, the number of 
genera has been cast up wrong : it should be 1102, instead of 1094.
In order 286 the number of species is printed 500, instead of 800.
But in addition to these minor matters, there are two enormous mis- 
takes in casting up the columns of genera and species of Exogens, 
which should be 6,191 and 66,225 instead of 18,062 and 55, 911.
The total number of genera and species now known, according to 
the estimates of the ' Vegetable Kingdom ' are 
Genera 8,935 
Species 92,930 
"I need not say" continues Prof.
Lindley, "that the existence of 
errors of such magnitude is to me extremely vexatious, but I fear 
that no one can escape from them who trusts to the accuracy of 
assistants, in even so small a matter as casting up a few columns of 
figures.
My only consolation is, that they do not occur in the body 
of the work." 
For ourselves we could take no " consolation" at all from any cir- 
cumstances connected with these truly "enormous" blunders, but 
should consider it our bounden duty to reprint the sheets in which 
they occur : the public ought not to suffer for such gross neglect, and 
we hold the author responsible for the competency of his servants.
595 
Within a year we may have speculators quoting the * Vegetable 
Kingdom ' in favour of some wild hypothesis, and repeating to the 
world these ludicrously inaccurate summaries, as a proof that the 
number of natural genera is rapidly advancing towards that of 
species.

Note on Trichomanes speciosum.
Mr. William Andrews, Secretary to the Dublin Natural History 
Society, read a paper upon the genera Trichomanes and Hyme- 
nophyllum.
His remarks were chiefly directed to the species of 
Trichomanes discovered by him in September, 1842, in the western 
part of the county of Kerry, and which presented a variety of growth 
and state of fructification so much more developed and characteristic 
of the genus of that beautiful fern, than had hitherto been met with in 
Ireland, that it determined him to examine its affinities with some of 
the exotic ferns, particularly with those of the West India islands.
The Trichomanes was first discovered in Britain, by Dr. Richard- 
son, at Belbank, near Bingley, Yorkshire, a wretched specimen of 
which is in the Banksian Herbarium, now in the British Museum : a 
figure of a barren frond is given by Dillenius in Raii Syn. p.
127, t, 3.
This specimen, however, not having been found in fructification, was 
supposed to be identical with the Filix (Trichomanes) pyxidifera of 
Plumier, and was described as such by Hudson, in his Flora Anglica, 
p. 461 : and this name it retained until its discovery, in the month of 
October, 1804, at Turk Waterfall, near Killarney, by Mr. Mackay 
curator of the botanic garden at Trinity College.
Mr. Mackay ob- 
taining this beautiful fern in fructification, forwarded specimens to Sir 
James Edward Smith, who at once decided its distinctness from 
Plumier's plant and considered it to be a new species, which he nam- 
ed and figured in ' English Botany ' as Hymenophyllura alatum, from 
its winged stipe.
The distinguished Robert Brown, the first physio- 
logical botanist of the day, corrected this specific appellation to that 
of brevisetum (Br. in Hort.
Kew. ed.
2, 5, p.
529), from the short and 
barely exserted state of the receptacles that the Killarney plants ge- 
nerally presented.
Mr. E.
Newman, who has devoted so much atten- 
tion to the specific characteristics of the British ferns, formed the 
first view, that the Killarney species perfectly agreed with Willde- 
now's description (Sp. Plant, v.
p. 514) of the speciosum of Teneriffe, 
and published it as such, in his first edition of the ' History of British 
596 
Ferns.' The specific name brevisetum, however, was still retained 
through the several editions of the ' British Flora,' until the discovery 
by Mr. Andrews, in September, 1842, in a wild and wooded glen in 
the western part of the county of Kerry.
The striking characters 
and fine state of fructification exhibited by these splendid plants, the 
most rare and most beautiful of British ferns, and now altogether 
confined to the south-western parts of Ireland, led Mr. Andrews to ex- 
amine them minutely, and to trace their affinities with the numerous 
exotic species of that beautiful genus; and from communications 
with Sir William J.
Hooker, and to the great kindness of that most 
excellent botanist and encourager of science, and the reference to his 
very extensive fern-herbarium, it was traced and detected to be the 
true Trichomanes radicans of Swartz, setting aside the species brevise- 
tum of the 'English Flora,' and the speciosum of Willdenow.
Thus 
the mild temperature of the south-western parts of this country pro- 
duced, in the utmost luxuriance of tropical growth, a plant peculiar 
to the West India islands, and to the western coast of South America.
To Dr. Scouler's kindness Mr. Andrews was also much indebted for 
specimens of Trichomanes radicans and T.
scandens, collected by 
Dr. S.
in Brazil, and which enabled many doubts to be cleared up.
Mr. Andrews noticed a very remarkable character of fructification 
in the new variety from Kerry, " that the capsules formed around the 
base of the receptacles within the cylindrical involucres, and as the 
receptacles elongated and became exserted considerably beyond the 
involucres, the capsules continued forming in an even dense mass to 
the extremity of the receptacles." This is described as of rare occur- 
rence in Trichomanes.
The Trichomanes reniforme of New Zealand, 
and the Hymenophyllum fuciforme of Chiloe, are noticed as having 
the capsules external to the involucres, but their being exposed to 
view was supposed merely to result from the spreading and shrinking 
of the valves.
Loxsoma appears to be the only recorded genus as 
possessing that peculiarity of fructification.
[Observations have already appeared in the 'Phytologist,' on the sup- 
posed identity of our Trichomanes speciosum with the T.
radicans 
of Jamaica and Brazil.
The idea, I believe, originated with myself, 
and indeed there is sufficient superficial resemblance between the 
two, to warrant such a conclusion at first sight, but a careful com- 
parison of the habit, rhizoma, stipes and involucre of the two species, 
would convince Mr. Andrews that they are well-marked and perfectly 
distinct.
Mr. Andrews's observation on the fructification of the 
newly discovered variety (Andrewsii) is highly interesting.

Notice of * Outlines of Structural and Physiological Botany.
By 
Arthur Henfrey, F.L.S., &c.' Part II., Organs of Vegeta- 
tion.
The second part of this useful little book fully bears out our re- 
marks on the^rs^ In that notice we confined ourselves to a general 
expression of approval without giving examples of the author's la- 
bours, an omission which we shall now supply, premising that what 
may be wanting in the novelty of the passages we shall cite is abun- 
dantly compensated by the lucid arrangement of the matter.
The 
chapter commencing this partis entitled "The Individual Plant," and 
the section which we cite " Morphological Considerations." 
" In a former chapter it was stated that certain plants consist of a 
simple cell, and that all plants make their first appearance under that 
form ; it is only at the extreme limit of the vegetable kingdom, how- 
ever, that they remain in such a simple condition.
The primary cell 
divides, but as an evidence of an advance in the scale of organization, 
these cells do not become independent of each other; on the con- 
trary, remaining attached, they subdivide again and again, till we find 
individual plants composed of an innumerable mass of such cells.
The plant thus begins to acquire parts or organs destined to perform 
fiinctions distinct from each other, and subservient to the general nu- 
trition and propagation of the whole.
" Looking at vegetables in their generality, we may say that a plant 
consists of three parts, the leaf, the stem, and the root ; although in 
the lower classes it is often the case that one or even two of these are 
wanting.
Advancing again, as in the case of the cell, we find that a 
plant may be composed of one of these individuals, or phytons as 
they have been called, producing its like, the progeny immediately 
obtaining an independent existence ; or the new individuals may re- 
main attached almost to an unlimited extent, constituting highly com- 
pound plants, the difierent organs or phytons of which undergo vari- 
ous modifications of form and acquire very distinct functions.
Thus 
in a flowering plant, or, as a stronger example, in a forest tree, every 
leaf is to be considered as essentially a distinct individual ; but as a 
member of a compound body, working for the general benefit of the 
whole.
In obedience to the requirements of this, they undergo mo- 
difications to fit them to execute distinct oflSces in the economy of 
the plant ; some are destined to the nutritive functions, others to the 
reproductive ; and among these latter we find them still further losing

their individuality, and becoming blended in all their parts with their 
fellows, until almost all trace of their real origin is lost.
" This is the substance of the doctrine of Morphology, the most 
important generalization in the whole science of Botany, as affording 
a clear and systematic view of the vegetable kingdom as a whole (in 
addition to the important relations it establishes with Zoology) ; this 
general statement is as much as can be indicated at the present stage 
of the subject, the proofs and elucidations of the theory being those 
very facts to which the greater portion of the following pages will be 
devoted.
" The presence or absence of the middle portion or stem of the 
typical phyton characterizes the most important distinction in the 
condition of plants, and on this ground the primary divisions are es- 
tablished.
" Plants which have no axis, but consist of cellular expansions, 
are called stemless plants.
The filamentous or foliaceous expansion 
is called a thallus, from whence the division has received the name 
of Thallophytes.
" Plants which possess an axis or stem interposed between the 
leaves and roots, either simple or compound, are called Cormophytes." 
â€”p.
47.
Chapter V.
treats of the Axis and its Appendages : the first section 
describes the structure of stems, giving a separate consideration to 
Acotyledonous Stems, Monocotyledonous Stems, Dicotyledonous 
Stems, Ligneous System and Cortical System.
The second section 
describes the root, and after a few general considerations we have the 
following detailed account of the root in the three different classes.
" Acotyledonous Roots.
â€” The simplest form of the roots of this class 
are mere cellular fibrillae, which supply the young stem with nourish- 
ment.
When this has become developed it gives origin to adventi- 
tious roots ; that is, the radicle merithal of each phyton becomes free.
Roots are usually produced all round if the stem be erect, or on the 
lower side if the stem be horizontal.
" In the arborescent ferns these adventitious or free roots accumu- 
late in such numbers that the base of the tree becomes increased in a 
conical form to two or three times the thickness of its real stem, 
" The roots of these plants correspond in the nature of their ele- 
mentary stnictures to the stems from which they grow ; cellular in 
the cellular plants, as the mosses ; in the Lycopodiaceae and ferns, 
&c., they contain fibro- vascular bundles.
These bundles, however, 
are generally central in the roots, enveloped in a layer of parenchyraay 
599 
which, in situations where it is in contact with the bundle, forms a 
hard brown or blackish layer.
In some ferns and Lycopodiaceae the 
fibro-vascular bundles lie within the external cellular portion of the 
stem for some distance before they become free in the roots.
In old 
stems of some Lycopodiaceae this parenchyma is separated from the 
central fibro-vascular column, and such descending bundles are found 
lying in the interval.
" Monocoiyledonous Roots.
â€” The radicle of germinating monocoty- 
ledons does not appear as a direct continuation of the stem, but 
breaks through the radicular extremity of the embryo.
A layer of the 
superficial cellular tissue clothes this radicle as with a sheath at its 
base.
Hence the embryos of this class have been called endorhizae, 
and the sheath formed by the radicular extremity is termed the coleo- 
rhiza.
" The roots of monocotyledons are usually compound, and the 
branches are occasionally again divided.
These partial roots, form- 
ing together the compound, are only temporary formations ; if the 
stem is perennial they die in the order of their production, from the 
centre outward, new roots being developed in circles continually more 
external.
The aerial roots commonly occurring in this class fre- 
quently exhibit this phenomenon.
They are produced from various 
parts of the stem : in the palms the base of the stem becomes cover- 
ed by the production of a large number of these adventitious or free 
roots, giving the base a conical form ; in the Pandanus they are de- 
veloped in a continually enlarging spiral, the most recently formed 
being the largest, and rising high up on the stem ; the death of the 
lower roots and the gradual destruction of the base of the stem often 
cause these free roots to become finally almost the sole connexion be- 
tween the stem and the earth.
In Dracaena the descending portion 
of the fibro-vascular bundles which belong to the radicle system do 
not become fi-ee and develope adventitious roots upon the stem, but 
are found as wood beneath the cortical layer, until they reach the 
base of the stem, where they are united to a certain extent by paren- 
chyma, so as to present a root somewhat resembling that of a dicoty- 
ledonous tap-root.
Cordyline australis has two such main divisions, 
called by Mirbel souches.
Here, however, the monocotyledonous 
structure is retained, the radicles are developed centrifugally, and 
break through the cortical parenchyma, which clothes them with a 
coleorhiza.
The flattened stems in the bulbs of our climates exhibit 
also the centrifugal development of the radicles.
" The anatomical structure corresponds to that of the stems.
The 
600 
fibro-vascular bundles are mostly situated toward the exterior, and a 
fibrous layer is often found beneath the cortical parenchyma.
In 
small rootlets the bundle is sometimes reduced to a single vessel sur- 
rounded by cellular tissue.
A difference of relative position occurs 
between the elements of the bundles in roots and stems ; the large, 
porous vessels of the bundles are most external in the stem ; in the 
root they are the most internal in relation to the axis of the root.
" Dicotyledonous Roots.
â€” In this class we find the root presenting 
a great central aggregation of the descending system, corresponding 
and opposed to the stem.
This kind of development of the root gives 
rise to what is called the caudex or tap-root, and is especially re- 
markable in.
trees, where its ramifications have frequently a definite 
relation to the size, number and extent of those of the stem.
The 
caudex does not generally become prolonged down very far into the 
earth, but its branches acquire a great lateral development.
Although 
this corresponds in some degree to the ramification of certain stems, 
the form and size of the stems and roots do not bear a constant rela- 
tion.
Either of the two systems may be proportionately much more 
extensively developed.
" The structure of the root may be considered as resembling ex- 
actly that of the stem devoid of pith, and consequently without the 
unrollable spiral vessels of its sheath.
This is the real structure in 
most herbaceous plants, but not in all trees.
The walnut, for in- 
stance, and the horse-chestnut exhibit a pith highly developed, ex- 
tending to a considerable distance in the root.
" The growth takes place by the periodical production of new lay- 
ers of wood and bark over the whole surface.
The increase of length 
is strictly terminal, no interstitial growth of the cells occurring; the 
ramifications are prolongations from the parenchyma of the cortical 
system, in which the fibro-vascular bundles are very quickly develop- 
ed, and become continuous with those of the parent branch.
" It has been mentioned that adventitious buds may occur under 
peculiar circumstances upon roots, even as they do in the bark of the 
stem.
Adventitious roots may also be produced from the stem, a 
striking example of this being afforded by the rooting of cuttings by 
which plants are propagated in horticulture.
The anomalies of stems, 
such as the coherence of contiguous ramifications into one, the forma- 
tion of concentric rings of parenchyma, as in certain Menispermaceaj 
stems and some of the climbing woody Convolvulaceae of Brazil, are 
frequently repeated in the roots." â€” p.
65.
The next section treats of the Leaf, its " anatomical structure," and 
601 
"form," and this latter, perhaps, is the least commendable portion of 
our author's labours ; in fact, a well digested arrangement and nomen- 
clature of the diversified forms in this beautiful portion of every plant 
is still a desideratum in botanical science : we consider few botanists 
of the present day capable of undertaking the task and accomplish- 
ing it to general satisfaction ; indeed, only one who could combine 
the needful qualities of knowledge, industry and judgment; and that 
one is Mr. Woods : he possesses an intimate knowledge of all that 
has been done, industry sufficient to collect it, and judgment suffi- 
cient to classify and arrange.
Much that is useless and tautological 
has to be rejected ; uniformity and simplicity must be kept in view.
It is tine that Mr. Henfrey makes no attempt beyond that of giving a 
superficial view of the commonly received nomenclature, and even in 
this he has not fully succeeded.
The description of the leaves of Acotyledons, Monocotyledons and 
Dicotyledons presents nothing new or worthy of comment, but on the 
subject of " Arrangement of Leaves" we have some useful generaliza- 
tions.
" In stems where the leaves arise one after another with the inter- 
position of a certain length of the axis between them, the leaves are 
called alternate, and this, the commonest condition, offers the most 
favourable opportunity of detecting the spiral arrangement.
" Alternate leaves are rarely placed exactly upon opposite sides of 
the stem ; the second leaf will be found to arise rather on one side of 
the point above and opposite the first, and the third on one side of a 
line perpendicular to the first.
In the apple the sixth leaf comes to 
be directly over the first, and a line drawn round the stem connect- 
ing all their bases will be found to be a simple spiral passing twice 
round the stem.
The point where a leaf is found coinciding perpen- 
dicularly with the first, indicates the completion of a series or ci/cle, 
and thus in the apple the cycles are series of fives.
Carrying the 
examination further up, we shall find the seventh leaf over the second, 
the eighth over the third, &c., until we reach the eleventh over the 
first and sixth, completing a second cycle.
" This arrangement in cycles of fives is that most common in Dicoty- 
ledons, but others also occur.
The lime presents a very simple con- 
dition.
Here the second leaf is directly opposite, and the third di- 
rectly over the first ; the latter completing one spire and being the 
point where the second commences.
This arrangement, which is call- 
ed distichous, is found in many Monocotyledons, but spires contain- 
602 
ing three leaves, forming the tristichous arrangement, are the most 
characteristic of that class of plants.
" The spire becomes much more complicated where it contains 
many more elements, but the relations are found to be constant, and 
in plants exhibiting such forms the spiral arrangement becomes 
much more apparent, as in the Pandanus or screw-pine, the pine- 
apple, and among the Coniferae.
" A little consideration renders it evident how this spiral disposition 
of the organs ensures the symmetrical distribution of the leaves, and 
the equable formation of new^ parts deriving their assimilated nutri- 
ment from them.
A proof of this influence is afforded by the manner 
in which the form of the stem deviates from the cylindrical in those 
plants where the spiral arrangement of the leaves is least obvious.
The various organs resulting from the higher states of development of 
the typical organ, namely, the floral envelopes, and even the carpels 
(as in the Coniferge), are all subject to the law of spiral disposition, 
and the importance of this view in elucidating the structure of the 
flowers will hereafter be seen.
In a large number of plants the law 
of arrangement just described does not at first appear to hold good, 
namely, in those which have opposite or verticillate leaves.
But op- 
posite leaves may be supposed to proceed from two spirals proceed- 
ing up the stem simultaneously, or from the non-development or 
shortening of the alternate internodes.
The whorl or verticil^ again, 
may be conceived to originate from the non-development of the inter- 
nodes of a whole cycle, each spiral cycle being thus reduced to a cir- 
cle.
Examining the succeeding whorls, we do not often find the 
leaves of the second perpendicular to the first, but with their midribs 
over the intervals between those below.
Supposing the leaves to be 
opposite, the second pair would stand at right angles to the first {de- 
cussate) : if the whorl contained three, it would require a greater 
number of series before the leaves would again correspond vertically.
In these cases the number of cycles or whorls required to complete 
the vertical coincidence constitutes a rectilinear series, and in oppo- 
site leaves consist of four cycles ; where the whorls are composed of 
three leaves, of six, and so on.
If the pairs do not cross exactly at 
right angles it will require several pairs to form a series, and these 
pairs follow a spiral arrangement like that which is commonly found 
in alternate leaves.
" Some authors contend that the normal arrangement of leaves is 
verticillate, and that the spire arises from the breaking up of this by 
the elongation of the stem.
Those, on the contrary, who contend 
603 
that the spiral is the typical disposition, assume that the elongation 
is suspended from time to time, to allow of the accumulation of the 
cycle into a circle, and that each internode separating these circles is 
made up of as many internodes or cauline merithals as the whorl 
contains leaves." â€” p.
81.
There may be nothing new in all this, but it is clearly and neatly 
expressed, and much good matter is compressed without injury.
It 
is, however, very evident that Mr. Henfrey's strong point is structure : 
he has not only read, but understood what has been done by our con- 
tinental neighbours, and has taken the now unusual plan of following 
and verifying their observations.
For a long time our magazines and 
other publications, in default of original contributions, have been 
crammed with translations from the German, not because such papers 
are good or useful, but because they are German : the Ray Society 
presents glaring instances of this, and circulates rubbish which the 
translators appear to understand as little as those who attempt to 
read it.* It is quite refreshing to find an author really understanding 
and appreciating the Germans, and from his own knowledge of the 
subject capable of digesting, and even in some instances, checking 
and correcting slight errors in their views, and this Mr. Henfrey has 
certainly achieved.
We shall conclude our notice with the following 
extracts from Mr. Henfrey's chapter on the " Physiology of Vegeta- 
tion." 
" The vital processes are so intimately connected, and so greatly 
depend upon each other, that divisions into distinct classes or sys- 
tems of function must be in a great measure artificial.
But an ar- 
rangement sufficiently natural may be found by taking the phenome- 
na in the order of their succession in the life of the plant ; these, 
indeed, move as it were in a circle ; the highest function, develop- 
ment, being at once dependent on and reproducing those of absorp- 
tion and respiration ; but since absorption must precede all else, and 
is that function which is most particularly dependent upon external 
circumstances, it affords a convenient starting-point.
Next in order 
will follow the circulation^ or to speak more correctly, the distribution 
of the fluids absorbed, bringing them within the influence of respira- 
* An extraordinary puff of this Society has just appeared in the 'Athenaeum,' but 
whether this puff be a legitimate bait for new members, laid by one of the salaried of- 
ficers of the Society, or a paid advertisement, or a burlesque, slily slipped into the edi- 
tor's box by some malicious wag, it is difficult to say.
Be this as it may, the puff, 
like the squeaking of Punch, arrests our attention, and we now feel it a duty to review 
a set of publications which previously we felt inclined to pass by without notice.

tion and assimilation, to render them fit materials for development 
and secretion.
The term nutrition does not appear to be applicable 
to any process in vegetable life.
Unlike animal organisms, where 
absorption is continually removing effete structures, to be replaced 
by the nutritive powers, the organs of plants are produced by deve- 
lopment, which continues up to a certain point ; the organ after this 
merely acts in consequence of mechanical structure, and when effete 
dies and decays.
In plants all is growth, as distinguished from the 
reproduction of removed or decayed parts, which is the office of the 
nutrition of animals.* 
" Absorption.
â€” From what has already been said with regard to 
peculiarities of cell-membrane producing the phenomena of endos- 
mose, it will readily be seen how perfectly the structure of the fibrillae 
of the roots is adapted to the absorption of the fluids around them.
The nature of the development, too, of the radical tissues, the root 
always growing by its extremity, continually furnishes fresh cells in 
the most favourable condition for absorption.
The absence of epi- 
dermis, that denser and more impermeable layer of tissue which is 
produced in other parts to moderate the transmission of fluids, is 
another important condition in the absorbing extremities ; the deli- 
cate epihlema by which young roots are clothed being composed of 
cells which have lost none of their absorbent power, while their ap- 
position as a continuous layer guards against the entrance of solid 
matter into the cavities of the internal parenchyma.
The roots ab- 
sorb only fluid, and all substances which afterwards present them- 
selves in a solid form within the cells, such as crystals, &c., must 
have entered the plant in a state of solution.
Experiments have been 
made, placing the roots of plants in water containing finely powdered 
solids, such as charcoal and colouring matters ; these were always 
found to accumulate upon the surface of the root, but never to pene- 
trate the tissues.
" Although roots thus reject all solia matter (and this is most pro- 
bably a simple mechanical necessity), they do not appear to have 
any power of selection ; they absorb poisons as readily as innocuous 
or beneficial fluids.
Difference of the relative densities of fluids, as 
would follow from the recognition of endosmosis as the agent of ab- 
sorption, is the only circumstance which requires any manifestation 
of preference by the absorbing surfaces." â€” p.

Experiment on the alleged conversion of the Oat irdo Rye.
By Hewett C.
Watson, Esq.
Like Mr. Sidebotham (Phytol.
ii.
589), I also tried the experi- 
ment of Dr. Weissenborn, last year, and without precisely following 
the instructions set forth.
My departure from prescribed rules was 
on the contrary side from that of Mr. Sidebotham ; the seed being 
sown earlier than it should have been.
Expecting to be from home 
at the latter end of June, and wishing to have the oats above ground 
before I left, their seed was sown either a few days earlier or a few 
days later (I forget which) than the first of .Tune.
It will be remembered that the summer was unusually wet and 
cold, and in consequence the young plants were kept in that state of 
constant green growth which our corn-fields usually show during a 
showery May. Many of the plants grew so rapidly that I was com- 
pelled to cut down some of their shoots repeatedly, as the only means 
of preventing them from throwing up culms, and, by flowering in the 
autumn, completely destroying the experiment.
Out of two hundred 
plants, scarcely a score survived the winter.
These came into flower 
about Midsummer (before and after) of this year.
Every one of them 
was a genuine Avena sativa.
Tn accordance with the editorial comment upon Mr. Sidebotham's 
experiment, mine also may be objected against, because not literally 
in accordance with the instructions set forth by Weissenborn.
Grant- 
ed.
But, even though we should literally follow the prescribed rules, 
both as to date of sowing and times of cutting down, the variations of 
seasons would still make the experiments differ.
Plants raised from seeds sown at Midsummer, in 1845 and 1846, 
would have been quite in a different state of growth and luxuriance 
in the August month of the respective years.
During the earlier part 
of this year of 1846, various garden operations were necessarily per- 
formed a month earlier than last year, reckoning by dates, in order 
the better to accommodate them to the season.
Though very little disposed to put faith in Dr. Weissenborn's ex- 
periments, I was thrown upon making the trial so far, by the reply of 
a gentleman to whom I had spoken in slighting terms of the alleged 
results.
His reply was, that the alleged result of one experiment 
could be refuted only by that of another and similarly conducted ex- 
periment.
Such a reply is sound argument in general.
Neverthe- 
less, there must be some practical limit to the suspension of judgment 
in such cases.
If there were no limit practically allowable, we 
Vol. ir.
4 f .
000 
slioulcl be compelled to not disbelieve the old nursery receipt for mak- 
ing black roses, namely, by grafting white roses on black-currant 
bushes.
We practically reject this, not on trial, but because analo- 
gies are against its probability, and because we see no intelligible re- 
lation between the act and the pretended result.
In the case of the alleged conversion of the oat into rye, there are 
circumstances which appear to warrant disbelief.
Similar experi- 
ments are constaiitly performed by the natural agency of insects and 
other animals, which gnaw down plants ; and yet no one has seen 
any generic change in the character of the plants induced thereby.
More closely resembling experiments are performed on a large scale 
by farmers, in their twice-mown crops of clover and ryegrass, and 
equally without any approximation to resembling results.
The gar- 
dener, too, cuts down his rows of mustard or parsley, without ever 
seeing them change into cress or celery.
The florist " stops " his 
choice plants, to postpone their flowering ; and the only result is that 
of increasing the number and size of the flowers, or the plant grown 
larger and more vigorous in its roots and foliage.
And lastly, besides 
these more or less analogical facts, which make against the credibility 
of Weissenborn's experimental results, there is absolutely nothing in 
the kind of experiment, or the mode of performing it, which could 
make us anticipate any other result than that obtained by Mr. Side- 
botham and myself.

Thames Ditton, August 2nd, 1846.
Extract from a letter from the late Mr. Edynondston to the Rev. Mr.
Hove, hy whom it is communicated.
" I WROTE you from Rio, and consequently need not say anything 
more regarding that loveliest spot under heaven.
We left it on the 
25th August, and speedily began to fall in with more boisterous and 
colder weather.
After encountering the usual allowance of 'pamperos' 
off" the Rio de la Plata, on the 19th September we reached the Falk- 
land Islands, where we staid till the 30th.
Alas !
alas !
what a mise- 
rable change from the palm and Acacia groves of Brazil â€” a wretched 
lot of long, low, bay-indented islands of quartz, covered with peat, 
a species of Myrtus (M.
nummularia), an Empetrum, and a small, 
compound, Hippophae-leaved shrub covering the soil.
There is 
only one small settlement in the islands, consisting of a few misera- 
607 â€¢ 
ble wooden and turf huts.
There are lots of wild cattle, which the 
settlers chiefly live on : they are taken by some Buenos Ayreans who 
live there, with the lasso.
There are also lots of wild horses, one of 
which I shot in one of my rambles, and dined off him in the follow- 
ing manner.
A large round mass of flesh, the skin adhering, is cut off 
and roasted, hide downwards, on the fire : this is termed * carne con 
cuero,' or ' flesh with the skin,' and to a ravenously hungry naturalist, 
a piece of colt's flesh treated in this manner, albeit roasted two mi- 
nutes after the animal was gallopping over the hills, and eaten without 
bread or salt, is no contemptible grub.
You may laugh at my Tartar 
banquet, but had I not come across the unfortunate ' cheval' which 
furnished our meat, I had serious thoughts of supping on a turkey- 
buzzard, which might have been rather tough and somewhat carrion- 
tasted.
Birds swarm everywhere at the Falklands, wild geese espe- 
cially, and from being so little molested are so tame that they may 
be knocked down with the oar ; a gun, in fact, is almost superfluous.
These birds are at this season found only along the sea-shore.
Be- 
sides these there are two or three vultures, two penguins, the Chionis, 
and numerous other sea and shore birds.
As it was the end of winter 
scarcely a single plant was in flower, and the heath was covered with 
tufts of withered grasses and Cyperacege.
I got some very good 
Cryptogamia, especially lichens, five Stictse and Usneas, and a good 
many Algae, one species, a large Irida3a, scarcely differs from I.
edu- 
lis, unless in size : it is sometimes four or five feet long.
The shore 
is everywhere belted by an enormous growth of Macrocystis pyrife- 
ra, which extends to the depth of eight or ten fathoms, and renders 
landing in a boat frequently very difficult, or almost impossible.
It 
grows in an immense matted mass, the stems being very slender, and 
each lanceolate, toothed leaf having at the base a large, oblong vesi- 
cle.
From its excessively branched and entangled growth it is al- 
most impossible to ascertain the length of any one plant, but I have 
unravelled thirty-three feet without any appearance of end, and I 
doubt not it attains 100 feet, or even much more.
Another giant 
Alga is also abundant, the Lessonia fuscescens, before whose dimen- 
sions our Laminaria bulbosa and digitata sink into insignificance; the 
enormous stems seem more like the trunks of trees as they lie on the 
sea-beach than anything else.
The upper part of the stem is divided 
into an immense number of dichotomous branches, each of which is 
terminated by a lanceolate frond.
" I got specimens and live plants of the magnificent tussack-grass 
608 
[Dactylis ccespitosa).
It was almost the only plant in flower in the 
islands.
" So much for the natural productions of the Falklands.
A more 
villanous climate cannot be imagined, at least while we were there it 
blew and snowed without intermission, preventing anything like ex- 
tensive excursions and occasioning the most exquisite discomfort.
It 
was never moderate enough to allow me to have a day's dredging, 
even in our own large, fine cutter.
Delighted were we to leave the 
Archipelago, j^ar excellence, of storms, and did leave it on the 30th 
ult., and here we have been tossing ever since.
Oh !
this charming 
Cape Horn amply deserves its character ; gale after gale, storm after 
storm, hurricane after hurricane.
I wish you could have seen three 
gales we have had when we were scudding under bare poles.
I 
never saw so magnificent a sight; but that ill makes up for other dis- 
comforts : the wind is always dead against, and we are half think- 
ing that we must be distantly related to the Flying Dutchman.
We 
leak like a spout, besides, I have six inches water in my cabin every 
morning.
It is doubtless very pleasant, in awakening during the 
night, to be lulled again to sleep by the gentle music of running wa- 
ter in your cabin ; but I am so unromantic as to prefer the contrary.
However, one must put up with these small discomforts at sea ; and 
in a week or two, the trade- wind and blue sky of the Pacific, will, 
we trust, welcome us, and waft us moderately, at least to Valparaiso.
Our destination is somewhat uncertain, but as the season is so far 
advanced that the coasts of Mexico will be extremely unhealthy, it is 
probable we will see the Columbia River about June or July, and af- 
terwards return to the southward, and endeavour in that way to cheat 
the ' Yellow Jack ' of Guayaquill." 
"Thomas Edmondston." 
Distinguishing Character of Circcea alpina.
Circea alpina.
â€” " It is almost amusing to peruse the characters by 
which botanists ever since the days of Linnaeus have been endeavour- 
ing to distinguish Circa^a lutetiana and alpina, which, whether indi- 
vidually or collectively, would, in any doubtful case, enable any one, 
except by chance, to tell the one from the other, even though the 
species are certainly distinct.
The genus, until extended by Indian 
additions, consisted of those two species only, the fruit of the former 
of which is two-celled, with a single, erect seed in each cell, hence 
609 
the generic character ' ovarium 2-cellecl, fruit 2-cclled, 2-seeded.' 
Such being the case in one species, it is inferred it must be equally 
so in the other, and the flower being small and fruit rarely produced, 
this is taken for granted.
By taking it for granted botanists have 
puzzled themselves in vain, for at least a century, to find good speci- 
fic characters by which to distinguish them.
The ovary at once sup- 
plies this long-sought desideratum.

New locality for Cyperus fuscus, Linn.
By J.
D. Salmon, Esq.
This plant, for which the only hitherto recorded locality is the Eel 
Brook meadow.
Little Chelsea, near Walham-green, Middlesex, I 
had yesterday the good fortune to discover in great plenty on the 
margins of Peat-pond, on Shalford common, about two miles from 
this place.
Your coiTespondeut, Mr. Mill (Phytol.
i. 146), who de- 
feuds the practice of the dissemination of seeds of rare indigenous 
plants, on the ground that some species may otherwise be lost to Bri- 
tain, particularly mentions C.
fuscus as likely to be destroyed by 
the progress of cultivation or building.
I am happy to be able to 
allay such fears by the discovery of yesterday, the plants growing in 
abundance, and in a situation not likely to be disturbed.
Has Mr.
Mill or any other gentleman carried out the suggestion in the article 
referred to, by introducing the plant here ?
Since my notice of the 'Outlines of the Flora of Godalming' ap- 
peared in the March number of the 'Phytologist' of the present year, 
in addition to several new plants and stations, I beg to notice the oc- 
currence of Equisetum hyemale in Wanborough wood, occupying an 
extent of two or three acres.
I should think this is the most south- 
erly station for this species yet recorded in England.

Corrections of erroneous habitats given to British Plants.
By Edward Forster, Esq., V.P.L.S.
I TRUST you will find room in your * Phytologist ' for the correction 
of erroneous habitats which have been given to British plants.
In Turner and Dillwyn's Guide, Crepis biennis and Crepis (Bark- 
610 
hausia) fQ3tida are stated on ray authority to grow at Purfleet, in 
Essex, whereas, in fact, neither of them has been found there.
At 
the time of the publication of that work, it must be remembered that 
Barkhausia taraxacifolia and Crepis foetida were not distinguished, 
the plant, therefore, called Crepis biennis is now Barkhausia taraxaci- 
folia.
The Crepis fcetida was inserted in consequence of the cele- 
brated William Curtis, author of the ' Flora Londinensis,' &c,, hav- 
ing so pronounced a specimen in ray herbarium, owing, doubtless, to 
the fruit being beaked, by which it will appear that this eminent bo- 
tanist was better acquainted with the true Crepis biennis than with 
the more common Barkhausia taraxacifolia.
The siaecimen is bad as 
to foliage, and it was simply from the fruit that Curtis conceived it to 
be C.
fcEtida.
Having searched many times since and found no trace 
of this species, I am well convinced that there is only Barkhausia ta- 
raxacifolia to be found there.
Here I shall take the opportunity of 
saying that 1 differ from ray friend Babington in referring to ^Eng- 
lish Botany,' f.
149, for Crepis biennis, ^^ except the fruit''' It ap- 
pears to me that both figure and description belong to Barkhausia ta- 
raxacifolia, more especially as nothing is said about the fruit being 
added from another specimen.
1 had much pleasure, not long since, 
in being shown by Mr. G.
S. Gibson and Mr. Joshua Clarke, the 
Crepis biennis at Littlebury, near Saffron Walden.
I rather think I 
once found it at Harlow, but my specimen is not far enough advanced 
to judge.
I am also quoted for Lathy rus hirsutus, " near the shore above 
South End ; " this ought to have been Vicia bithynica ; Lathyrus 
hirsutus grows at Hadley Castle sparingly, and at Rawreth in abun- 
dance.
Having given you my own erroneous habitats of Essex plants, I 
will now notice those of others.
Mr. Cooper, in the ' Flora Metropo- 
litana,' inserts Lepidium Smithii, Winch.
This, I suspect, T ought to 
have put among ray own blunders ; for I once fancied I had found 
Lepidium Smithii at Walthamstow, but T fear it was only L.
campes- 
tre with a somewhat persistent style.
This I probably showed to ray 
late friend Winch, as I do not believe he ever was at Waltharastow 
except with me.

" G.

It is on the Forest,

Note on the TVJiite-Jlowered variety of Orchis latifolia, Sfc.
By Charles Prentice, Esq.
In the * Phy tologist ' of this month there is a note fi-om Mr. Ogil- 
vie, concerning the occurrence of the white-flowered variety of Orchis 
latifolia in the Highlands of Scotland.
This variety is far from being 
so rare as he seems to consider it, for it occurs in considerable abun- 
dance on Roydon Green, near Diss, in Suffolk, together with the 
usual reddish, pink-coloured plant, though the white variety is rather 
the more fi-equent of the two.
Lipavis Loeselii, Utricularia niinor 
and Cladium Mariscus are found on the same fen.
With regard to Mr. Townsend's remarks on the occurrence of 
Phleum arenarium inland, I can state from personal observation it 
grows sparingly on Waltham Lyng, near Diss, in Suffolk.
I once 
gathered a single plant of Littorella lacustris, on a wet part of the 
same heath, which is singularly barren and stony.
I need not say it 
is quite inland.
Carex arenaria does not occur there.
Liparis Loe- 
selii is, I fear, fast being extirpated, as it is sure to be gathered with 
its roots, which, from the sandy, soft, boggy soil in which they grow 
are easily eradicated.
The destruction of Gamlingay Heath has 
also taken away one of the best localities for this curious and rare 
plant, as well as for several others.

[I do not consider the white variety of Orchis latifolia as a plant 
of uncommon occurrence.
I have seen it plentifully near Loch Fyne, 
in Scotland, and near the Black Mountain, in Wales, besides occa- 
sionally in other localities.
The white varieties of some Orchideaj 
613 
are exceedingly beautiful, and none more so than that of O.
Morio, 
which I have occasionally met with in the vicinity of Leominster, in 
Herefordshire.
In some instances the flowers were of a pure, unmix- 
ed white, while in others the green lines, which serve as an excellent 
distinguishing character of the species, were not only present but 
very conspicuous, greatly increasing the beauty and remarkable ap- 
pearance of the flower.

A few words on the first appearance of diseased Potatoes in a 
Garden.
By Hewett C.
Watson, Esq.
With reference to two remarks on the ' Potato Fungus,' in the 
* Phytologist ' for this month (p.
586 and wrapper), I beg to say a few 
words.
Curious to watch the first appearance of diseased tubers, 
with reference to weather and ground, 1 became the practical potato- 
provider for my small household, taking up, with ray own hands, all 
the potatoes used during the first two months of the season, from the 
open ground, namely, from the first week in June, to the second week 
of August, excepting a few days of absence from home.
Being very 
much engaged otherwise about the middle of August, I transferred 
the duty of potato -digging into the hands of the gardener.
During the whole of that period, of about nine weeks, I did not 
find a single diseased tuber, nor did I observe any trace of the "fun- 
VOL.

gus" on the stems or leaves.
But about the thirteenth of August, 
the gardener forked over the ground from which T had taken the po- 
tatoes, in order to sow turnips, and he found one potato which had 
been left in the ground, and that one was infected, as my cook said, 
and I can trust her eyes, exactly like the diseased potatoes of last 
year.
Being from home that day I did not see it, nor hear about it 
until lost or thrown away by the gardener, who had cut it across to 
show its condition to the cook.
The gardener has now been digging 
up potatoes daily for a week past, and has not found another diseased 
example.
He also has scratched here and there among the later va- 
rieties, and finds no bad potatoes.
Last year, by this time, the disease had probably attacked a fourth 
or a third of the tubers of the same varieties.
Is it not somewhat 
curious that the only potato found left in the ground should have be- 
come infected, and yet none of those attached to the roots or shoots of 
the living plants should be so affected ?
I regret, however, to say that this immunity of my own garden 
from the pest, is no criterion of the condition of the fields and gar- 
dens of my neighbours ; many of them being very seriously infested 
and damaged already.
One instance was narrated to me, of a farmer 
offering to sell four acres of potatoes for a sovereign.
I was watch- 
ful not to allow any diseased tubers to be planted.
The potatoes 
hitherto got up for domestic use were planted in dry and loose earth ; 
but some of the later crops, where the gardener's scratchings have 
failed to detect disease, are in stiff, loamy soil, which would grow 
wheat well, and did so within a dozen years.
Before the rains of August set in, I could hear of no bad potatoes 
in this neighbourhood.
With us, the dry weather lasted until the 
day of the storm in London, on the 1st of August, when we had heavy 
rains, interspersed with some few large hailstones.
During June and 
July we had very little rain ; and, as I remember, only on one day 
was the ground wet by rain to the depth of two inches.

Notes on Polygonum maritimum and P.
Rati, as grown together in 
Jlower-pots inland.
By Hewett C.
Watson, Esq.
In the current volume of the ' Phy tologist ' (Phytol.
ii.
45 and 333), 
are some brief notes on the approximation of P.
maritimum towards 
P. Roberti (British Flora) or P.
Raii (Bab. Man.), when cultivated 
inland in a garden.
Last autumn I was kindly supplied with seeds 
of the British P.
Raii, by the good offices of the Rev. W.
S. Hore.
Some of these were sown in flower-pots, at different dates in ihe 
spring of the present year ; as also, seeds of the garden-descended 
P. maritimum (of Azoric origin, in 1842) in other pots at the same 
time.
The cotyledons of the two were scarce distinguishable from each 
other, in their stage of vegetation ; but after the appearance of two or 
three of the earliest true leaves, the plants were so visibly different 
that had they all been pulled up by the roots and mixed together, it 
would have been perfectly easy to separate them into their two origi- 
nal species or varieties.
This does not prove them to be permanent- 
ly distinct, as species, although it may increase the probability of 
such being the fact ; as it so far shows their peculiarities to be trans- 
mitted, without inter-commingling, for one generation, when external 
conditions are made equal.
In its early state, the Polygonum Raii might more likely have been 
mistaken for the ordinary corn-field form of Polygonum aviculare, 
than for Polygonum maritimum ; but in its more advanced stage of 
flower and fruit, the resemblance became much closer to the P.
mari- 
timum than to the P.
aviculare.
The young plants of Polygonum Raii grew quite erect until two or 
three inches high, when the stems suddenly bent at one of their lower 
joints, almost at a right angle, so as to give a horizontal direction to 
their growth.
At the time of writing this notice (August 20), their 
stems and branches are eight to twelve inches long, still keeping to 
their horizontal mode of growth, and very slightly bending upwards 
at the growing extremities.
They neither hang down over the sides 
of the flower-pots, as would any creeping or softer-stemmed plant, 
nor do they ascend much above the rims of the pots, except that, 
when v/et by rain or dew, they incline below the horizontal line, ap- 
pai'ently through increase of weight upon the wiry stems.
Compara- 
tively with those of P.
maritimum, the ochreae are thinner and much 
less nerved ; and although pretty long at first, they tear and wear 
away more rapidly.
The leaves are longer in proportion to breadth.
616 
less coriaceous, rather less glaucous, bending upwards (or inwards 
towards the stem) between base and tip, and with less tendency to 
become revolute at their margins.
The internodes are somewhat lar- 
ger on the whole ; though this is not a well-marked chai'acter.
On the contrary, the young plants of Polygonum maritimum never 
became abruptly bent into the horizontal position.
They increased 
in length, they gradually became procumbent at their base, with as- 
cending or even almost erect branches.
At a later stage they are 
distinguishable from Polygonum Raii by the harsher texture of their 
ochreaj, which have numerous, strong, dark russet nerves.
The 
leaves are more ovate or oval, coriaceous, very glaucous, convex on 
the upper surface, revolute at their margins, from the tip backwards 
for the half or two-thirds of their length, and diverging from the stem 
or branch.
The seeds are rather smaller ; but it is doubtful whether 
a botanist could again correctly separate the seeds of the two species 
if mixed together.
During our past mild winter, one of the last year's plants of P.
ma- 
ritimum survived in the open ground, and several in flower-pots in a 
cold frame.
These have become quite ligneous at the bases of their 
stems or branches, and the internodes of this summer's growth are 
much shorter than was the case with those of first-year plants, during 
1843, 4, 5, which were made annuals by the severity of our winters.
Thus, as might have been anticipated, the length of the internodes 
proves to be only a fallacious character, changing with age and 
season.
So far as my garden- grown plants aflford good distinctive charac- 
ters â€” and these correspond well enough with my recollections of the 
wild plants on the coasts of England and the Azores â€” the specific 
or varietic (to coin a termination) characters may be taken as below.
Between the prostrate plants of our own shores, and the lavender-like 
bushes of the Azores, evidently the growth of many years, the first- 
sight difference is wide enough.
Whether this may not arise as much 
from climate and place, as from distinctness of species, may still ad- 
mit of question.
Compared with each other, the following characters 
will distinguish these two and Polygonum aviculare : â€” 
P. maritimum.
â€” Perennial.
Stems ascending from a procumbent 
and ligneous base.
Leaves coriaceous, very glaucous, convex 
above, revolute at the margin, diverging from the stem.
Ochreae with numerous, strong, dark nerves.
Fruit large, 
smooth, shining, conspicuously longer than the perianth.
P. Raii.
â€” Perennial .'' Stems prostrate.
Leaves glaucous, plane.
617 
but curving upwards from base to tip, so as to bend towards 
the stem again.
Ochreae with few short nerves.
Fruit large, 
smooth, shining, conspicuously longer than the perianth.
P. aviculare.
â€” Annual.
Stems prostrate or ascending.
Leaves 
very variable in colour, form and consistence.
Ochrese with 
few weak nerves.
Fruit small, striated with elevated dots, 
opaque, shorter or slightly longer than the perianth.

Notice of the '^Transactions of the Microscopical Society ,"* 
Vol. IL Part 1.
The Microscope, which has been too much the plaything of triflers, 
is now contributing largely to our knowledge of structure, and the 
Society founded in its name, is becoming a means of extending a 
taste for, and knowledge of, that branch of Natural History.
Some of 
the papers read before the Society are of considerable value, and 
among such we may particularly mention three by Mr. John Quekett, 
which appear in the present publication ; these are on the Cilia of 
the common Mussel, on the Structure of Feathers in the Owl tribe, 
and on the Structure of the Flabella in some of the Crustacea : the 
utility of these papers is unalloyed by the admixture of that mawkish 
and speculative philosophy in which modern discoveries are usually 
dished up ; and they are therefore the more available for the real 
student of nature.
But the crack paper of the session, that by Mr.
Smee on Adipose Tissue, does not appear : this paper was peculiarly 
calculated to command the respect of the learned at home and abroad 
and thus to elevate the standing of the Society, and we have reason 
to know that the publication of the present part of the Transactions 
was looked forward to with intense interest, on the faith of its con- 
taining a record of Mr. Smee's brilliant observations.
What has be- 
come of this extraordinary paper .^ Has the author found that his 
statements are erroneous ?
Has the Society permitted him to with- 
draw it for separate publication ?
Has the publishing committee 
submitted the paper to some rival, but less successful, observer, 
who recommends its suppression ?
The members of the Microscopi- 
cal Society have a right to know the truth : it is impolitic in the 
highest degree to allow such a paper to be withdrawn or suppressed, 
and equally impolitic to pass over its withdrawal or suppression in 
silence.
The world has to thank Mr. Williams, the able Assistant- 
618 
secretary of the Society, for a very masterly abstract of Mr. Smee's 
paper which appeared in the ' Zoologist' for January, 1845.
It is however with Botany alone that we must treat here, and the 
only botanical paper in the part before us is on a monstrosity in Agari- 
cus personatus, by Dr. Lankester, although we find but little of in- 
terest in the monstrosity itself, and not the slightest connexion 
between the monstrosity and the microscope ; yet, for all this, there 
is a matter of great moment discussed in the course of the paper, and 
one which we think cannot fail to interest our readers.
In the first place let us premise that the monstrosity is thus descri- 
bed.
The "agaric was dried up and decaying from the effects of frost.
[!] 
In all its parts, however, it exhibited a normal structure, with the ex- 
ception of the pileus, in the centre of which, directly over the inser- 
tion of the stipes into the hymenium, a second and smaller hymenium 
was developed.
The gills of the smaller hymenium were uppermost, 
and, presented towards the light, the edges were covered with the 
pileus, which gradually united itself with the pileus of the lower 
hymenium." A monstrosity very nearly if not exactly identical with 
this, was described long since by the Rev. M.
J. Berkeley, and we 
have seen others too frequently to consider them worthyof espe- 
cial notice.
The * matter of moment ' is contained in the following 
passage.
"Before concluding this paper, perhaps I may be allowed to make 
one or two remarks on the Morphology of the Cryptogamia.
It is 
only by the observation of abnormal forms like the present, that we 
shall be enabled to point out what are the real relations of one form 
of fungus to another, and classify them according to their natural affi- 
nities.
Morphology has done much for classification amongst phae- 
nogamous plants, but little or nothing amongst the cryptogaraous.
The ' Transactions of the Microscopical Society' contain, however, 
the record of a single fact of monstrosity amongst the mosses, which 
has afforded an interesting illustration of the application of the prin- 
ciples of Morphology in the higher departments of the animal king- 
dom ; Professor E.
Forbes, in his paper on the Morphology of the 
SertulariadcB, having pointed out the analogy between the change of 
structure taking place in those animals and the mosses, from the simi- 
larity of form in their organs of nutrition and reproduction.
Have 
we, then, in this fungus an analogous condition to that which has 
been found in the higher plants?
If in the fungi we regard the pileus 
and stipes as the representatives of the leaf or nutritive organ in the 
higher plants, then the hymenium must be regarded as the analogue 
019 
of the flower, or repioductive organs.
We may then suppose that un- 
der the influence of the cold or other external agent, an arrest of de- 
velopment in the vegetable tissue of the fungus would be attended 
with the development of reproductive tissue, as we know occurs 
amongst the higher forms of plants.
It may be objected that we need 
some further proof that the pileus and stipes are really the analogues 
of the nutritive tissue.
I think that this can be clearly made out by 
passing along from the fungi to the lichens, and from these to the He- 
paticcB and the mosses and ferns, where every one will allow that the 
green parts are the nutritive tissue of the plant and the analogues of 
the leaves.
There is one curious point with regard to the morpholo- 
gical structure of the fungi which I would here point out.
It is that 
the whole body of the fungus is the analogue of the flower in the 
higher plants, the thallus of all the Cryptogamia being in this family 
as its minimum of development ; the only analogue of the thallus 
being the mycelium, which is seen in the early part of the development 
of all fungi, and disappears when the hymenium is developed.
I may 
perhaps here be allowed to mention how beautifully this fact con- 
firms the relation of polarity which Professor E.
Forbes has pointed 
out, as existing in every part of the animal and vegetable kingdom.
The Fungi and the Algte must be regarded as parallel groups, and in 
fact, up to the present moment, there is no definition that will distin- 
guish between many of their groups, so that a whole tribe, ByssoidecBy 
are referred sometimes to one, sometimes to the other, and Sometimes 
distributed variously through each.
The characteristics of the con- 
centrate sphere are a tendency to concentration in the organs of re- 
production, to the formation of an internal skeleton in the organs of 
support, and to a unity in the combination of its parts.
Of these 
three characters the fungi are a remarkable exhibition, as seen in the 
Agarics, and generally in the higher forms of Hymenomycetes.
On the 
other hand, the characters of the articulate sphere are a tendency to 
elongation, the formation of an external skeleton, and articulation, all 
of which characters are conspicuous in the Conferva:, the LarninariiB, 
and other forms of the family Algce.
The whole fungus may then be 
said to be the analogue of the flower, and just in the same way as the 
calyx and corolla stand in the relation of nutritive organs to the more 
especially reproductive stamens and pistil, so do the pileus and stipes 
stand in the relation of nutritive organs to the hymenium." â€” p 34.
In this long and somewhat obscurely worded paragraph we find the 
" pileus and stipes" regarded" as the representatives of the leaf or nutri- 
tive organ in the higher plants," and " the hymenium as the analogue 
620 
of the flower :" wc are next told that "the whole body of the fungus" 
is '' the analogue of the flower in higher plants" and lastly we learn 
that "just in the same way as the calyx and corolla stand in the 
relation of nutritive organs to the more especially reproductive stamens 
and pistil, so do the pileus and stipes stand in the relation of nutritive 
organs to the hymenium." It must be admitted that these assertions 
are rather obscure and contradictory, and of course it is no part of 
our duty to explain or harmonise them ; the pith of the paragraph 
is in this line, " the whole body of the fungus is the analogue of the 
flower in higher plants^ Now we believe this to mean that an 
agaric, a mushroom for instance, is merely the flower of a plant, and 
not an entire plant, as has been so frequently supposed.
This we 
take to be a true and valuable observation.
Some years have elapsed 
since a paper was written and handed about among botanists, entitled 
the ' Theory of Fairy Rings.' It was pronounced to be wild and 
hypothetical, and the author was dissuaded from committing himself 
by its publication.
But although all agreed in pronouncing the 
entire paper worthless, some parts of it were thought less exception- 
able than other parts, indeed it found readers who condescended to 
borrow a passage here, and an idea there, to patronise a fact, or adopt 
a suggestion, until in one shape or other the contents of the paper 
have been pretty widely disseminated, although the paper itself was 
pronounced valueless.
The ' Theory of Fairy Rings' was something in this way.
The 
seed* of an agaric was supposed to be carried by the wind to a cer- 
tain spot in some open down, and there to germinate ; assuming a 
shape totally different from the mushroom from whence it sprang, it 
was supposed to become entirely subterranean, to consist of white 
tortuous thread-like fibres, the ramifications of which radiated from 
the spot where the seed had fallen, their extremities forming the cir- 
cumference of a small circle, the extent whereof was shown on the sur- 
face of the soil, by the short herbage assuming a more intense green.
Up to this point it must be admitted much was conjectural, but here 
observations and admeasurements began : the circles were found 
to increase annually in size, and while the circumference retained 
the brighter green, the centre reassumed the usual livery of the 
down.
Experiments, carefully conducted, proved the existence of the 
fibrous fungus beneath the greener circumference of the circle and its 
absence from the superficies.
Here then appeared to be a new plant, 
* We use the terra in preference to either of the odd names which have been invent- 
ed to mystify beginners.
021 
a subterranean, fibrous, fungoid vegetable : it spread from a common 
centre, and while it extended itself in every direction around the 
margin of the green ring which superficially marked its presence, it 
seemed to perish and disappear from the inner margin.
The next noticeable feature in the case was, that from these green 
rings issued a number of agarics ; a fact familiar to all botanists, and 
to every shepherd who traverses the downs.
Some of the rings pro- 
duced but two or three agarics, some produced them in tens, some in 
hundreds ; but very few of these fairy-rings were wholly unproductive.
It was a work of little trouble to establish the fact that these agarics 
were connected with the subterranean fibrous fungus before described ; 
they were found in a state of absolute continuity with this fungus.
A 
parellel instance occurs in the common mushroom, except as regards 
the uniformity of its figure : the cultivators of this delicious esculent 
purchase and plant a fibrous fungus, in order that they may gather 
one totally different in all its characters.
They know it by a diffe- 
rent name; they plant mushroom-spawn that they may gather mush- 
rooms, exactly as they would plant a gooseherry-hush that they might 
gather gooseberries ; and the two processes are conducted with equal 
certainty of success.
We believe it to be incontestible that the fine powder emitted by 
the fungUs tribe is reproductive seed : we see multitudes of agarics 
rising in the course of a night, emitting seed and perishing : there is 
no other vegetable so evanescent.
Now, if we admit the connexion 
of the agaric with the fungoid fibrous vegetable usually known as the 
mycelium, thallus, or spawn ; if we admit the evanescent character of 
the agaric, and the enduring character of the spawn â€” and who shall 
resist these admissions, â€” we are driven either to the illogical conclu- 
sion that the spawn is an entirely subterranean perennial vegetable, 
and the agaric a parasite whose seeds have to penetrate the earth, in 
order to find a fitting substance whereon to germinate, and that this 
fitting substance is supplied in the spawn ; or, that the spawn is a sub- 
terranean vegetable except when pushing its blossoms to the surface, 
in order that its seeds may be dispersed on the wings of the wind, and 
that the agarics are those blossoms.
If it be asked why the presence of the spawn should alter the 
colour of the grass on the surface ?
we acknowledge the question to 
be one of great interest, but at the same time we must maintain, that 
our inability to give a satisfactory reply, in no degree militates 
against the theory we have ventured to propound.
The presence of 
the spawn beneath the turf of the fairy-rings is indisputable, and we

could quote numerous authors who have born witness to the fact, if 
our own evidence were considered insufficient.
It should here how- 
ever be observed, that this alteration in the colour of the turf is not 
the constant concomitant of the presence of agaric-spawn : on the 
contrary we have found this appearance produced by a very limited 
number of species : and in some meadows where agarics (particularly 
mushrooms) abound, fairy rings are altogether absent.
It should fur- 
ther be observed that the figure assumed by the spreading spawn may 
be either regular or irregular : in the mushroom it is certainly irregu- 
lar : this variation has an exact analogue among phsenogamous 
plants ; in the Umbellifera; we have perfect regularity in the disposi- 
tion of the flowers ; in almost all other orders great irregularity.
A series of observations made on the common mushroom during 
several successive years, have furnished additional presumptive evi- 
dence, that they are the flowers of some plant which is concealed 
from the eye.
The mushroom-gatherers also supply this evidence : 
from them it appears that common meadows, and meadows having a 
much frequented right of way through them, are tenfold more produc- 
tive than neighbouring meadows, which are strictly private; and 
hence there is no temptation for the mushroom-gatherer to trespass 
or break hedges.
The solution of this curious fact appears to us 
very easy : there is in almost all plants, in an ordinary state of health 
and vigour, a tendency to produce blossoms : if this propensity be 
allowed free scope, the plant puts forth its blossoms, and rests con- 
tent with its achievement : but, if the blossoms are nipped ofi" in the 
bud, the propensity is not satisfied, the end not being accomplished ; 
and the plant, in many instances, will continue to produce flower- 
buds, each succeeding supply being more numerous than the first, 
but the size being generally much diminished.
Now this is precisely 
the case with mushrooms : picking them as fast as they appear inter- 
feres with the design of nature in producing them : nature redoubles 
her efforts, and the supply becomes far greater in number, but, at the 
same time, the individuals are diminished in size.
Now, were we to 
regard a mushroom as an entire and perfect plant, it seems to us very 
obvious that the avidity with which they are sought and gathered, 
before they can by any possibility shed their seed, must soon exter- 
minate the race in such public localities as those we have described, 
instead of perpetuating, increasing and improving the supply, as is 
confessedly and most incontestibly the case.
It is with great pleasure that we have perused a pamphlet from the 
pen of Mr. Allies, in which he touches (with his usual ability) on the 
623 
interesting subject of Fairy-rings.
After alluding to the theory here 
broached of their being " caused by a species of vegetable matter, 
which progresses from the centre of each of them, and spreads larger 
and larger in a circle, causing the grass to be greener on the rim 
than it is either within or without the circle;" Mr. Allies proceeds 
to inform us that " upon the rim of one of them being dug into, 
a whitish, fibrous, starchy-looking matter appears under the sod, 
amongst the roots of the grass, and at certain seasons, several species 
of Fungi or agarics grow in great number on such rims." In a note 
to the word ' fibrous ' Mr. Allies adds, " That it is fibrous T believe 
there can be no doubt; for several years ago I had a portion of it 
examined by a gentleman, with a powerful microscope, who pronoun- 
ced it to be fibrous." Of course, no one will doubt that the spawn is 
fibrous after such authority as this, but we arrived at the same conclu- 
sion by the assistance of our unai*med eye.
And here we would have 
laid down our pen, and reckoned our case established, but " Audi et 
alteram partem'''' is a wise and unanswerable rule; we therefore cite 
an authority on the other side of the question.
In the Wiltshire Col- 
lection of Aubrey relative to the ' fairies,' published about the middle 
of the seventeenth century, we have the following theory of Fairy- 
rings.
" As to these circles, I presume they are generated from the 
breathing out of a fertile subteraneous vapour, which comes from a 
kind of conical concave, and endeavours to get out of a narrow pas- 
sage at the top, which forces it to make another inversely situated to 
the other, the top of which is the green circle." 
The reader is permitted to adopt the theory of which he most 
approves.

The Indigenous Plants of the Mauritius.
Nearly sixty years ago, a paper was read at a meeting of the Lin- 
nean Society, which must have occasioned no little mirth among the 
members present.
It was written by Sir J.
E. Smith, the Founder 
and first President of the Society, and entitled a " Review of a Dutch 
edition of the Systema Naturae of Linnaeus." This book was a folio 
volume, in Dutch, French, and English ; and was published at the 
Hague, in 1765.
Sir James says : "I have often contemplated this 
production with equal wonder and contempt, and have amused my- 
self in conjecturing how the ignorant compiler of it could fall into 
such strange errors as he has done." Passing strange, indeed, are 
624 
some of his errors ; and truly are they described by the author of the 
review as being " like the ravings of a maniac, whose origin or con- 
nexion cannot be traced." But some of our readers will ask, " what 
has the learned Dutchman's ' Systema Naturae ' to do with the plants 
of the Mauritius ?" We reply, simply this ; that in the year of grace, 
1846, eighty-one years after Mynheer Staatman, of the Hague, put 
ibrth his curious tri-lingual ' Systematis Linncei corruptor^ as Haller 
calls it, there is published in London, by a respectable house, the 
first volume of a work of much pretension,* in the appendix to which 
may be found an exact parallel, so far as blunders go, to the ingeni- 
ous old Dutchman's puzzling production.
With the historical, political and statistical portion of this volume 
we have nothing to do in this place : our business is with that part of 
the appendix which professes to give an account of "The Indigenous 
Plants of the Mauritius," and to which we turned in expectation of 
finding something new and interesting relative to the plants of a spot 
rendered classical by St. Pierre's charming tale, ' Paul and Virginia.' 
Something new there undoubtedly is ; for we were wholly unprepar- 
ed to meet with such a farrago of ignorance and error as is here put 
forth under the authority of a " B.A., F.R.G.S.
;" and again quoting 
from the review of the Dutch book, we may truly say that " with re- 
spect to the vegetable part, a young student might be much misled 
by this work, and an old one puzzled in no small degree." We 
could not understand the matter at all, until turning to the introduc- 
tory paragraph, we found a statement to the effect that " the author 
had collated a rather detailed account of the plants indigenous to the 
Isle of France from the German and French botanical works of the 
last century." Here, then, is the key to the mystery.
The author, 
utterly ignorant of Botany, yet conceited enough to suppose he can, 
unassisted, add value to a book by subjoining details of a science of 
which he absolutely knows nothing, gets together a heap of descrip- 
tions from the " French and German botanical works of the last cen- 
tury," and without consulting any competent individual, of whom 
many might be met with in the metropolis, both able and willing to 
render their assistance, sets to work, and, like the Dutchman, turns to 
a dictionary for every word ; and though his perseverance may deserve 
all praise, yet the result shows that "perseverance without judgment

may often go very far out of the way ;" for his article on ' The Indi- 
genous Plants of the Mauritius ' is such a precious compound of con- 
ceit and " ignorance as in the present age one would hardly expect 
to meet with." 
That our readers may not be required to take our assertions on 
trust and without proof, we subjoin numerous extracts quoted verba- 
tim, literatim et pimctaiim : beginning with the introductory para- 
graph, in which the author sets forth that " He may be allowed per- 
haps to remark that no English botanical work (and he has searched 
the most eminent), contains a correct list of the indigenous plants of 
the Mauritius.

that the labour he has devoted to this investigation may be found use- 
ful even to the naturalist.
In the arrangement of the genera, the au- 
thor has preferred the Jussiaean to the Linnean system as being less 
complex, and therefore better understood." 
So far the plan was good ; and there is nothing to complain of but 
the bad execution of it.
And first with respect to the author's idea 
of what he calls the Jussicean system, but which, from its originality 
ought rather to bear his own name.

We entreat our readers not to skip the above formidable array of 
names (which, by the way, are followed by a supplement, equally 
clever), for they really display considerable ingenuity, both as regards 
location and orthogiaphy, both particulars being strictly observed 
in our quotation.
But better remains behind.

The Dutch editor of the work we have before mentioned, in his 
laudable endeavour to Anglicise the Linnaean Latin, sometimes makes 
a strange mess of it; thus, "in Syngenesia, he says, 'the males and 
fructifyers are monstrous.' In Gynandria, ' the males and females 
have the members monstrous.' In Monoecia, ' the males and fe- 
males live in the same place, but in different pipes.'' " Laughable as 
this is, we find its parallel in some of the enumerations of the plants 
belonging to the various orders of the above unique system.
Thus : 
" Euphorbiaceae are a genus of evergreen shrubs, named after Eu- 
phorbus, physician to Juba, king of Mauritania, who first used this 
plant in medicine : it has a number of species, which are natives of 
Mauritius, and were discovered there by Comraerson, viz., Euphorbia 
a feuilles de Poirier (pyrifolia), peduncle subumbelled ; a feuilles de 
thym (thymifolia), Tithymalus humilis of Commerson.
This noxious 
plant (which is dichotomous) renders almost sterile the fields it in- 
fests ; a feuilles d'estragon (dracunloides), umbel trifid.
Splendens, 
the finest of the genus, grows to the height of four feet, and flowers 
in June and September, branchlets covered with straight spines ; hy- 
pericifolia, found near St. Louis, leaves subvillose underneath : hirta, 
this species has some resemblance to the preceding.
These (Secur- 
inega nitida or durissimaj, is the Otaheite myrtle, so called by Com- 
merson â€” from securis, a hatchet â€” because the wood was so hard as 
to be capable of being manufactured into cutting instruments : an 
evergreen timber tree, flowers in June or July ; this species, which 
grows at Mauritius to the height of forty feet, is one of such varied 
appearance that it is scarcely possible to assign them a character in 
common ; in cold countries their vegetation is mostly herbaceous ; in 
hot, fruticose.
La ricinelle (Acalypha integrifolia), an evergreen 
shrub, flowers diaecious, of a pale green colour, and appear in June 
and September, grows to the height of five feet ; a epis filiformis, 
Acalypha filiformis.
Kirganelia virginea, or Phyllanthus casticus, 
vulgo bois de demoiselle), is a pretty little tree, six or seven feet 
high, a genus of the chilotydones, but of the family of the Euphor- 
bias : fruit an oval red berry, which finally becomes black.
Another 
species is found : the Croton Mauritanum and aromaticum are both 
indigenous to the Mauritius.
Gluttier a feuilles obtuses (Sapium ob- 
tusifolium), leaves cuneiform ; discovered by Commerson.
To these 
may be added, Phyllanlhe en buisson (dumetosa) ; found by Com- 
merson at Rodriguez." â€” p.
356.
The above quotation needs no comment : indeed, if our readers 
understand some parts of it, we candidly confess it is more than we 
627 
do.
The definition of the order, number of species, &c., are rich.
We proceed : â€” 
" To the LegurainosÂ£e belong Cylista albiflora, an ornamental ever- 
green twiner, six feet high ; flowers white, and appear in April and 
May, corymb larger than calyx.
The Crotalaria are a numerous ge- 
nus : Crotalaria verrucosa is found near St. Louis ; sericea exists in 
the same locality, and flowers in March ; striata, an ornamental ever- 
green, three feet high, flowers yellow ; angulosa, leaves hastato-lan- 
ceolate ; arborescens, an ornamental shrub, resembling the cytisus, 
and rises to the height of the common bagne nandier (four or five feet), 
whose name it bears at the Mauritius, and is charged for many months 
of the year with numerous bouquets of flowers very agreeable to the 
eye ; it is especially remarkable by its stipules, which fall off" as soon 
as the flower withers ; it is distinguished by many shades of diffe- 
rence from the preceding ; the flowers are beautiful, but it bears no 
fruit ; purpurascens, is from one to three feet high ; pentaphylloides ; 
this flower has entirely the aspect of a lutin, flowers of a yellow co- 
lour, and disposed in clusters.
Acacia a fruit aile, or Mimosa ptero- 
carpa : the wood of this tree is of a yellowish-white, fruit is in a shell, 
and is remarkable by a longitudinal wing.
Aspalat soyeux (Aspala'- 
thus sericea), leaves silky ; this flower resembles an Absinthe ; it 
grows several feet high.
" Courbrail verruqueux (Hymensea verrucosa), found in the Isle of 
France by M.
Smeathman.
Indigotier des Indes (Indigofera Indica), 
the pendules of this plant are subteretal.
There is another species 
with shorter legumes." â€” p.
358.
What can the man here mean by saying that the corymb of Cylista 
albiflora is "larger than the calyx V What is the hagne nandier to 
which the Crotalaria arborescens is compared ?
And the description 
of the latter plant is in itself somewhat novel, particularly where 
it is stated to be " especially remarkable by its stipules, which 
fall off as soon as the jiower withers^ Most extraordinary plants 
these !
But one of the most extraordinary, perhaps, of all the novel- 
ties is the new position given to the genus Grammitis, in the midst of 
the Compositae.
Thus : â€” 
" Lactuc de ITsle Maurice (Lactuca Mauritiana), found in the 
woods; Eperviere filiforme (Hieracium filiforme), stem filiform, leaves 
spathulated.
. .
. Grammite naine (Grammitis pumila) resem- 
bles the Pteris cheilanthoides, fironds sub-bipinnate, resembles the 
cheilanthus; Gnaphale feuille (Gnaphalium foliosum), fruticose, 
found by Labillardiere ; proteoides, flowers subglobular, found on the 
G28 
summits of the most arid mountains, and the clefts of perpendicular 
rocks ;" &c.â€” p.
363.
" To the Vagumlati Olocarpi belong Orthotric plisse (Orthotricum 
plicatum), flowers axillary, leaves imbricated, angulosum, stem short, 
flowers axillary ; pallidum, leaves a pale green ; there are several va- 
rieties of this species, which with the others, was discovered by 
Thouars ; Hypnum intortum, stem creeping." â€” p.
364.
The Vagumlati, from the names given, we presume to be mosses, 
which are as much out of place here as Grammitis, which is a fern, is 
among the Compositas.
" To the Asclepiadeae, Cynanque vomitive (Cynanchum vomitivum), 
stem villous, corymbs lateral, called also Ipecacuanha ; the root is a 
vomitive, and when bruised is given as a dose." â€” p.
365.
" To the Iridoese belong Glayent a larges feuillcs (Gladiolus latifo- 
lius), leaves hairy ; Dufoure a trois rangs (Dufouria trifaria), leaves 
trifarious, this plant lies between the mosses and Lycopodes, is found 
in the waters." â€” p.
366.
Here is another puzzler.
From the name of Gladiolus being given, 
we presume Iridoece means Iridece : but then what can be the Du- 
fouria, which " lies between the mosses and Lycopodes," and " is 
found in the waters ?" Certainly it can have nothing to do with the 
IridesB ; but may possibly be the Tristicha of Thouars {Dufourea, 
Bory), one of the Podostemacese.
" To the Scitamineaj belong Alpinia magnifica, an evergreen her- 
baceous plant of a splendid character, it is ten feet high, and flowers 
in August, the colour is red, leaves broad.
Sir W.
Hooker says of 
this species, ' It is one of the noblest plants that has ever graced the 
pages of the botanist.' This plant is stemless, and very fragrant." 
â€”p.
366.
Here our ingenious author is tolerably correct, so far as the order 
of his plant is concerned ; though the name of Brown's Scitamineae 
has been sunk in that of Zingiberacege.
A stemless plant, ten feet 
high, miist, however, be a curiosity.
" To the Cucurbitacceae, Lufia foetida, a dicotyledone, male 
flowers racemose, this is a species of gourd." â€” P.
367.
A monocotyledonous member of the Cucurbitaceae would be some- 
thing " new and sti'ange." 
" To the Menispermeae, Lampourde commune (Xanthium struma- 
rium), stem unarmed, fruit terminal ; there is another variety, with 
more angular leaves and more acute lobes, which flowers in July." â€” 
p. 367.
629 
We here have an Asteraceous (or Composite) genus placed in an 
order with which it would be somewhat difficult to trace any con- 
nexion.
But we fear that by this time our readers are as tired of the vaga- 
ries of this ingenious blunderer, as we ourselves are ; before we take 
leave of him, however, we must quote his description of the sea cocoa- 
nut (Lodoicea Seychellarum).
Some parts of this precious document 
are so laughable, that we trust we shall be excused for introducing 
one of the most curious botanical productions that has appeared since 
our old friend, the Dutchman, figured Ferrtiria Pavonia, and called 
it Eriophorum.
" Lodoice des Maldives or Seychelles (Coco de mer), of the genus 
monoclytedones, and the family of the palms, is one of the most 
extraordinary and valuable productions in nature, and may be classed 
among the Lataniers, though it resembles the cocoa-nut in many 
respects.
It is unarmed; the fronds bij)innate, folioles bifid al, 
flowers dioecious, and grows to the height of from fifty to eighty feet.
It is perfectly straight, but its circumference is small.
Every tree 
bears about twenty or thirty cocoa-nuts, weighing from twenty to 
twenty-five pounds, each of which are borne on a peduncle of six feet 
in length.
The head is covered with from ten to twelve palms, of 
nearly twenty feet in length.
The pedicle is sloping in its contour.
The leaf is in the shape of a fan, and has a fuller appearance than that 
of the cocoa.
The wood of this tree is very hard at the surface, but the 
interior is filled with soft fibres.
After being cleared and deprived of its 
interior fibres, the trunk, which differs little in form from that of the 
ordinary cocoa, but is harder and thicker, is of use for making tanks to 
receive water, and palisades for dwellings and gardens.
The common 
name is coco de mer, which was given by the Portuguese, the first dis- 
coverers; because, in their early voyages to the East Indies, they dis- 
covered several of these nuts cast up by the sea on the coasts of Mala- 
bar and the Maldives ; and as they could never find any at all resem- 
bling them elsewhere, they were led to believe it a marine production.
The husk, from which rope is manufactured, resembles, in colour and 
fibrous consistency, that of the cocoa-nut.
The form of the nut is 
bizarre.
The shell is thick, large, and fibrous, and divided into two 
compartments, containing a light-coloured and trans})arent gelatinous 
substance, which, though brought to table and good to eat, is with- 
out any flavour, and as a fi'uit valueless.
The shell of the nut is em- 
ployed in the construction of pitchers of different forms ; those 
designed to bear water are formed of the whole nut, bored at the top,

the contents of the interior being scooped out.
The negroes carry 
them suspended from the top of a stick.
They will contain from six 
to eight pints of water.
They are an object of commerce for this 
reason, and highly prized by sailors from their not being subject to 
breakage.
They can be graved, and will take a most excellent polish.
When sawn in two, these shells serve as dishes and plates for the 
negroes.
Brooms and baskets are made of the ribs of the leaves, 
and mattresses and pillows are stuffed with the down attached to the 
leaves.
The pistil of the flowers gives, when ripe, a spherical fruit of 
from eight to ten inches in diameter.
The seed-vessel is about two 
feet long, and three inches in diameter, studded with small yellow 
flowers, issuing from the angular projections, which resemble those 
of a pine apple.
When stripped of its hair, this fruit, raulieris cor- 
poris bifurcationem * * * representat.
Another fact 
connected with this singular production is, that the smell arising from 
it after some days is so offensive (resembling human excrement, 
* * * * * * ) that its vicinity is 
hardly bearable, which increases the longer it is kept\ In proportion 
as the fruit dies, the jelly is changed into a hard kernel like a horn.
The stem of the leaves proves highly serviceable in constructing the 
negro huts and the cottages of the lower order of farmers, while from 
the young leaves, when dry and cut into twists and lashes, hats are 
manufactured of a superior quality, which are universally worn in the 
islands by all classes male and female.
The old leaves serve to cover 
the roofs.
With one hundred leaves a commodious cottage may be 
erected, covered in, doors made, with windows and partitions to 
chambers.
At Praslin most of the cottages of the labourers are thus 
built.
Besides these purposes, there are many more to which this 
extraordinary fruit is applied.
So important is this tree to the Sey- 
chelles that its loss would be more severely felt than that of any, pro- 
duction of which they can boast, yet its cultivation appears to be 
totally neglected.
It is an extraordinary fact that the tree which 
bears the nut is known only at the Seychelles, and even there is con- 
fined to two islands alone, all efforts to transplant them to others hav- 
ing proved fruitless, though the whole group apparently possess 
the same soil and climate.
Praslin and Curieuse are the two upon 
which they flourish, growing in the interstices of the rocks.
Immedi- 
ately at the junction of the leaves with the trunk of the tree, hang 
the nuts and seed ; the former about a foot long and eight inches 
thick.
The Indians held these nuts in high estimation, attributing to 
them many curious and salutary properties, and, indeed, the value set 
G31 
upon them throughout Asia was once so enormous that, previous to 
the discovery of these islands, a single nut has been known to sell for 
between ^Â£300.
and ^Â£400.
and the Indian princes had cups made of 
them, ornamented with gold and precious stones ; but since the French 
traders furnished the Indian market with them more plentifully, they 
have lost much of their estimation and with it their rarity.
Among 
the different properties which have been attributed to this tree, some 
are fabulous, and the others are not sufficiently consistent.
The phy- 
sicians of Asia pretended that this nut was an antiscorbutic, would ef- 
fect a radical cure of the venereal disease, and was an antidote against 
poison.
It was also believed that the kernel had an astruigent qual- 
ity and might be used to remove dysentry.
It is known to botanists 
as the nux medica.
The discovery of this nut on the coasts of the 
Maldives and Malabar, more than four hundred leagues from the 
place of growth, is useful for making known the direction of the 
currents."â€” p.
398.
We fully agree with our friend when he says that his Coco de mer 
is one of the most extraordinary productions in nature ; since a tree 
which possesses the following characteristics must indeed be a phe- 
nomenon.
It belongs to " the genus monoclytedones." " The head is 
covered with from ten to twelve palms, of nearly twenty feet in length.
The pedicle is sloping in its contour," " The pistil of the Jlower 
gives, when ripe, a spherical fruit of from eight to ten inches in 
diameter," though " the seed-vessel is about two feet long, and three 
inches in diameter, studded with small yellow flowers, issuing from 
the angular productions, which resemble those of a pine apple." We 
need not dwell on the extraordinary fact described in the untranslated 
passage, nor on that mentioned in the succeeding sentence : the ker- 
nel being " known to botanists as the nux medica.^'' 
We know not the nature of " the sternest possible ordeal " to which 
the author assures us " every pari of the work has been subjected :" 
we can only advise him, and that seriously, to subject the sixteen or 
seventeen pages filled with such rubbish as we have quoted to an 
ordeal still more stern than his " sternest possible," â€” the ordeal by fire.

On the Potato Disease.
* By P.
B. Ayres.
M. D.
At the request of the Secretary of the Society, I have drawn uj) the 
few following hasty observations on the affection of the potatoes, which 
has contributed to produce so powerful an effect on our economical 
*' Read before the Botanical Society of London, September 4tb, 1846.
632 
and political relations.
The extensive and serious re-appearance of 
the disease in the present crop of that useful plant, has rendered the 
affection of equal interest this season.
Many and various causes 
have been assigned for the decay of the tubers, some of a more, others 
of a less satisfactory nature, but none of them capable of suggesting 
a preventative, and I am not aware that any such preventative has 
been yet brought to trial.
But the disease was looked upon last year 
as in all probability of a transitory nature, and attention was directed 
more to the preservation of the tubers of that year, than to the pre- 
vention of the disease for the fului*e.
It was, of course, on the suppo- 
sition that the disease was dependant on the growth of fungi, recom- 
mended that good tubers only should be planted in the ensuing 
spring, but beyond this, I believe nothing further was done.
It has 
been stated that minute insects have been found on the leaves, which, 
by making numerous punctures, destroyed the vitality of those por- 
tions so injured, and thus caused the leaves to shrivel, and afforded a 
dead nidus for the vegetation of the Botrytis, which is very generally 
found on the decaying portions of the leaves.
This may be true in some 
instances, but I have very carefully examined the leaves of potatoes 
affected with the disease, without being able to find any trace of such 
insects on the healthy or diseased portions of the leaves.
If there 
had been any insects, these had long since disappeared, and left no 
marks that I could discover of their ravages.
As to the excessively 
minute perforations in the cuticle, discoverable only by a high power 
of the microscope, which have been described, they might be either 
the result of the decay, or they might exist only in the imagination 
of the observer, or again they might be the result of want of practice 
in microscopic examinations.
If the eminent observer Mirbel, des- 
cribed the ultimate tissues of plants as riddled with holes or slits, 
it may be easily believed that others less practised in the use of the 
microscope, should be led into similar errors.
But in this instance 
we require that the insect should be be found on the potato, that it 
should be accurately described, that it should be seen while occupied 
in its destructive vocation, and that it should be universally observa- 
ble or observed.
Until these conditions are fulfilled, we may be 
allowed to doubt whether this is to be recorded among the causes of 
the disease.
The CQunexion of certain fungi with the diseased state of the 
leaves and tubers of the plant is of much greater importance, inas- 
much as the Botrytis is almost universally observable on the 
leaves of the diseased plant j and statements have been made that 
633 
other fungi have been found growing within the stem and tubers.
We may therefore fairly say, that the development of fungi has a 
striking connexion with the premature decay of the tubers.
But the 
question may be asked, Is this development of fungi the cause or the 
consequence of the disease ?
It requires for the elucidation of this 
point, that the general history and physiological relations of epiphytic 
fungi should be brought under review, and to this task I shall first 
proceed.
We may for the present purpose divide the whole of the 
fungi into two classes, those that grow on dead animal or vegetable 
matter, and those which infest living plants.
Of the former, those 
which grow on the common soil, generally spring up where this has 
been well manured by the decay of animal manure, of animals them- 
selves, or on stumps of trees and other decaying vegetable substances.
The latter consisting chiefly of the ordinary diseases of corn and other 
plants, belonging to the genera Uredo, ^Ecidium, Puccinia, Aregma, 
&c., are as evidently absorbed by the root, carried up by the stem, and 
finally develope themselves in various parts of the plants, according to 
their peculiar nature.
These plants consist of simple cells contain- 
ing spores, and, like the parasitical animals, may exist in the plant with- 
out causing much injury, except to the particular part which they infest, 
unless the parasite is developed in great abundance.
Neither does 
the fungus cause the destruction of the vitality of the cells of the stem, 
or of the leaves, except those immediately occupied by it.
Other 
genera of fungi, belonging to a different order, fix themselves on the 
leaves of plants, and are probably produced in the same way as those 
just noticed, namely, by the absorption of the spores by the roots, and 
their transit with the sap to the leaves, where they are developed.
The genus Dothidea is an example, Asteroraa another, but still these, 
although causing some unhealthy appearance in the leaves, do not 
cause that absolute death of the cells which is seen in the patches of 
the leaves in the potato disease.
Descending to the tribe Mucedines, we find that very few of these 
grow on living plants, and even when such is the case, they spring 
from previously diseased spots of the leaves ; these spots become yel- 
low, the cellules flaccid, and in a great measure deprived of vitality, 
before they afibrd a fit nidus for the development of the fungus.
In the genus Botrytis, of which the fungus of the potato is a species, 
we have three species inhabiting still living but unhealthy plants, 
and this previous state of debility or diminution of vitality of the 
diseased plant, is especially observable in one of these cases.
It is 
common to find the Shepherd's purse {Thlaspi Bursa-pastoris) covered 
634 
with the white Ureclo [Ureclo Candida), and it is ahtiost as common to 
find this again covered with the Botrytis parasitica, although the lat- 
ter is sometimes present on plants free from the Uredo.
In this case 
it is sufficiently evident that the vitality of the plant has been 
diminished by the growth of the Uredo before the Botrytis is able to 
fix itself upon it.
Moreover, both these plants occiu' chiefly in the 
autumn, when the leaves are verging toward decay.
The Botrytis 
effusa, which is a pest of spinach, and another species found on the 
Chenopodium albidum, occur on yellowish, half-decayed spots, or 
certainly spots in which the cellules of the leaf have lost their vital 
turgidity.
With this brief and imperfect outline of the habits of the parasitical 
fungi, I arrive at the consideration of the question, â€” is the Botrytis 
found on the potato leaf, a cause or, consequence of the disease ?
If 
wc were to take the anology of the Uredo, .^cidium and Puccinia, 
we should be inclined to imagine that the sporules of this Botrytis 
were absorbed by the roots, and carried with the sap to the parts in 
which they are ultimately developed ; but this analogy does not ap- 
pear to me to hold good, for reasons I shall presently detail.
The 
Uredines occur, as I have stated above, in otherwise healthy plants, 
and provided they are not developed in very great abundance, the 
functions of the plants are but little disturbed.
The Mucorines 
on the other hand seldom make their appearance except on decaying 
vegetable or animal matter, and even when they do so, the plant or 
the part of the plant on which they occur is usually if not invariably 
in an unhealthy state ; the cells become more or less flaccid and the 
colour is changed to yellow or brown ; they are indeed emphatically 
the inhabitants of putridity.
In the plants of potato affected with 
this disease, I observed that the leaves became flaccid, either at their 
edges, or presented flaccid and half-dried spots in the areolae of the 
veins of the leaves, which quickly changed to brown, and ultimately 
were crisped and curled, exactly such effects as I have seen to follow 
the immersion of the roots in some poisonous metallic solutions.
The Botrytis was not to be found on all these spots ; some were 
entirely free from it, while others were covered with the fungus.
I 
shall presently have to insist more strongly on this circumstance.
Where the Botrytis was found, on such spots it could not be traced 
beyond the flaccid and dying or dead portions of parenchyma, and 
gradually diminished in amount as it approached the margins of the 
spots.
I need not describe the characters or appearance of the Botry- 
635 
tis as this has been ably done by Mr. Berkeley, Taking these circum- 
stances into consideration, the absence of the fungus from some even of 
the recent spots, the fact that the Botrytis only appears on the dead, 
half-dead, or even decaying portions of the leaf, I think that I am 
justified in concluding that the Botrytis is not the cause, but the con- 
sequence of the death of some portion of the tissue of the leaf.
It 
seems to me quite as rational to believe that the sporules of this fun- 
gus floating in the atmosphere affix themselves to the dying leaf, and 
finding thus a fitting nidus for their development, arrive at maturity, as 
to suppose that they are absorbed and carried by the juices to every 
part of the plant, ft would be quite as rational to believe that the 
sporules of any of the common moulds, were circulated in the tiuids 
of an animal whose flesh, after a few days' exposure to the atmos- 
phere, is found to be covered by them.
The experiments of Schultzc 
have shewn that unless these sporules, which from their excessive 
minuteness float easily in and are diffused through the air, are ad- 
mitted to animal, or vegetable substances undergoing decay, no de- 
velopment of Mucors or animalcules can occur.
I conclude therefore 
that the appearance of the Botrytis is a secondary consequence of the 
disorganisation and loss of vitality of some portion of the cellular 
tissue of the leaf.
From the leaf itself we now proceed in a downward course to the 
petioles and stem, and here we find marks of disease.
The petioles 
become brown, some portions retaining their normal or healthy appear- 
ance.
The diseased parts are flaccid, more transparent and more 
watery than natural, but their sections do not show any appearance of 
fungus, or at least I have not been able to detect any traces of either 
mycelia or perfect fungi.
The stem itself is subject to similar changes ; 
but being more bulky and retaining its moisture longer, the color is 
deeper and becomes almost black ; decay goes on, the cellular tissue 
of the pith is disintegrated or destroyed, and fungi are then said to 
be found in the hollow.
In the field of potatoes I examined at Croy- 
don some days since, I could not see any stems in this state, and 1 
have since been favoured by my friend Mr. Cooper, with some of the 
most diseased stems that could be found in a field severely affected 
with the disease ; but in these no appearance of fungus could be dis- 
covered.
It is extremely probable that in a very advanced stage of 
decay, and perhaps later in the present season, such fungi will be 
found, as they will also on almost every decaying stem of an 
herbaceous plant.
At all events 1 can affirm that so far as my inves- 
G30 
ligations have gone, no fungus exists in the early stage of the disease.
We now arrive at the most important part of the plant in an eco- 
nomical point of view, that modification of the stem in which starch 
is so freely deposited, and which is thereby rendered fit for the food of 
man.
Before we discuss the nature of the disease in the tuber, it is ne- 
cessary to pass in review the structure of this part of the plant.
The 
tuber, it is almost unnecessary to say, consists of a simple enlargement 
of the underground stem, by the enormous development of cellular 
tissue, containing an immense multitude of starch granules.
Hence 
we may expect to find in it all the ordinary structures of the stem 
very much separated and as it were disturbed by the excessive deve- 
lopment of the pith, but differing from the stem in the almost if not 
total absence of woody fibre.
If we make a perpendicular section of 
the tuber and look at the cut surface, we see two lines diverging 
from the point of entrance of the stem, and which pass round the 
potato and meet again at its opposite extremity, where the under- 
ground stem was again continued of its ordinary size.
These lines 
are indications of the woody tissue of the stem, the large circle they 
surround being the dilated and enormously developed cellular 
structure of the pith filled with starch granules.
Along the central 
axis of the potato we observe a dull line, which only differs 
in its microscopic structure from the remainder of the cellular portion 
of the tuber, in perhaps containing fewer starch granules.
This dull 
line marks the normal development of the pith in the ordinary stem.
The epidermis is separated from the bundles resembling and continuous 
with the woody tissue, by a considerable interval filled up by similar 
cellules, filled with starch.
The cells are for the most part of an 
hexagonal or pentagonal outline, and filled, or nearly so, with starch 
granules, except near the surface, where they are more compressed 
and contain less starch.
The vascular bundles, which in a transverse 
section of the tuber form a circle, consist of barred or dotted ducts, 
with a very few spiral vessels, and surrounded by compressed or pris- 
matic cellular tissue and little or no woody fibre.
The walls of the 
cellular tissue are perfectly transparent, colourless and slightly gra- 
nular, buds are developed on points of its outer surface ; such is the 
condition of the tuber in its healthy state.
1 must more especially 
remark that nearly the whole of the cellules, except those immediately 
surrounding the vascular bundles, and beneath the epidermis, are ^/fefZ 
with starch granules, which occupy the whole of the cavity, some few 
of the cells being less crowded with starch granules.
When we examine 
637 
a thin slice of the potatoes affected with the disease where the decay is 
confined to minute spots, we see that the still uninjured parts are strikin- 
gly deficient in starch granules, and that the granules themselves are for 
the most part smaller and less perfectly formed.
The decay com- 
mences in the walls of the cells which become, more or less brown 
and moi'e coarsely granulated than in the healthy state of the tissue, and 
lose their transparency.
The process of decay having thus com- 
menced in the walls of a single cell, is propagated to the walls of the 
cells contiguous to it, and by this progressive decay a large portion of 
the tuber is ultimately involved in the disease.
I have not been able 
to detect any fungus or mycelium of fungus in the tubers either of the 
last or the present year, and I would attribute the decay, not to the 
development of fungi, but to the same cause that gives rise to the de- 
cay in apples, and other fruits, the diminution or total loss of the 
vitality of the cell.
That fungi are afterwards developed in the tubers 
as in any other dead vegetable matters, is indisputable, since they 
have been seen by such distinguished microscopical observers and 
mycologists as the Rev. M.
J. Berkeley, and Mr. Stevens of Bristol ; 
but that they are necessary concomitants to, or causes of, the disease, 
I feel inclined to deny, since in none that 1 have examined were they 
present, and as I used an achromatic microscope of such power as to 
make the larger starch granules appear a quarter of an inch in dia- 
meter, I think that I should have readily detected them, had they been 
present.
It would not however be difficult to mistake the junctions 
of the hexagonal cells for the mycelia, as they put on somewhat the 
appearance of tubes; but as these are present in the perfectly healthy 
as well as in the diseased potato, they cannot be considered as 
mycelia.
On the supposition of the presence and direct influence of fungi in 
the production of decay, it would seem improbable that decay should 
take place to so great an extent as I have observed, without the full 
development of the fungus, which was not the case in the specimens 
I have examined.
Fi"om all I have stated above I shall draw the con- 
clusion that the production of fungi in the different parts of the 
potato plant, is the concomitant rather than the cause of the disease.
Let us now endeavour to trace the disease in a more systematic 
manner, and first of the causes which may bring about the disease.
The tracing of chains of causation is at all times difficult, even when 
we have to deal with the more simple bodies of the inorganic king- 
dom, or even the materials of which organized beings are formed ; 
but when a question arises in which the laws of vitality are involved,

we are presented with a more complex and difficult problem.
As we 
descend in the scale of organised beings we find them more influenced 
by external causes, their growth, nutrition, and reproduction are influ- 
enced by causes, which possess no power over the similar functions 
of beings higher in the scale of creation.
But even the highest are 
still more or less under the influence of external causes, some of 
which we have no power to explain, foresee, or prevent.
At intervals 
we find countries ravaged by epidemic diseases, which do not appear 
to be contagious, and are probably dependent on meterological causes.
Many animals are seen in great abundance in certain years, disappear- 
ing and re-appearing at uncertain intervals.
Locusts may be quoted 
as an example.
But if such causes operate on animals, how much 
more may we expect that they should influence beings lower in the 
scale!
We consequently find that our amounts of agricultural pro- 
duce vary very considerably and are dependant on the amount of 
rain, dew, and other atmospheric causes.
But this is more particu- 
larly the case with the lowest orders of vegetationâ€” the fungi.
These 
are often seen in large quantities one year, almost disappearing the 
next, and recurring in a perodical abundance.
What are the known causes of their variations ?
Why should 
epidemical disease, insects and fungi, thus observe an irregular perio- 
dicity in their abundance ?
Such circumstances lead us to the belief 
that they must depend on atmospheric influences ; that variations in 
the density, in the humidity, in the electric state, or finally perhaps 
in the intensity of the earth's magnetism, are capable of influencing 
both animal and vegetable life, and of inducing diseased states of 
organized beings.
The variations of humidity, whether in the state of vapour or rain, 
have been recognised from time immemorial as causes of variations in 
the amount of agricultural produce, but the influence of electricity 
and magnetism, or even the changes of intensity of these powerful 
agents, have not been determined with any degree of accuracy.
It is 
possible then, and I put it forward as an hypothetical statement, 
that these influences may have produced the death of some portions 
of the cellular tissue of the leaves.
If we have a cause for the disease 
of the leaves we may readily account for the subsequent state of the 
stem and tuber.
The leaves being the digestive as well as the respi- 
ratory organs of the plant, if these are extensively diseased or destroyed, 
two important functions will be deranged, or diminished, an insuffi- 
cient, or unhealthy sap will be returned to the stem, and this will suffer 
in its turn.
As the tuber is simply a cellular development or distension 
639 
of the stem, it will be injured in the same manner, but as both the 
structure and function of the tuber, differ from that of the remainder 
of the stem, some peculiarities will be observed.
The starch which fills and distends the cellules of the tuber, has 
been aptly compared with the fat of animals, and as it is sufficiently 
evident that it is deposited as a fund of nourishment to the young 
parts of plants, it performs precisely the same function in their eco- 
nomy.
But the fat of the animal, or the starch of the plant, is only 
deposited when there is an excess of nutriment in the system ; and 
it is to be expected that when there is a diminution of v itality, a dis- 
ease of the digestive and respiratory organs and functions of the 
plant, that this deposit of nutritious matter will also be deficient or 
imperfectly developed.
Now from the observations I have been able 
to make, I come to the conclusion that the starch granules are either 
deficient in number or bulk.
On placing a slice of the diseased 
potato under the microscope, many cells are seen perfectly empty or 
containing only a few small granules, while in other cells they are 
more numerous but still of small size.
Now as the cellular tissue is 
fully developed while the starch granules are deficient, their place is 
supplied with a watery juice, which renders the tissue more prone to 
decay.
The decay as I have mentioned above commences in the cel- 
lular tissue, and spreads along the walls of the cells, rendering them 
brovvn and opaque.
I find that this paper has already grown to a greater length 
than I had at first intended.
I could have wished to have entered 
more fully on the general conditions necessary to the healthy per- 
formance of the functions of a plant, the influence of atmospheric 
changes and other analogous subjects, but other avocations and want 
of time have prevented the fulfilment of my primary intention.
I 
shall therefore content myself with suggesting a remedy for the 
disease in future crops.
As there would appear to be defective vitality 
accompanied by growth of fungi in this disease, I would suggest the 
use of stimulating manures, such as common salt, or the chloride of 
potassium, or even any other alkaline salts, taking care of course to 
avoid too great a quantity, which would prove injurious to the plant.

Its occurrence in clover 
fields, in which the specimens were collected by Mr. Williamson, is 
also in favour of this view.
The specimens differ from the character 
given to Orobanche lucorum, in Koch's Synopsis, by having the se- 
pals shorter than the tube of the corolla ; but in other respects the 
dried specimens do not exhibit any decided difference from the cha- 
racters of Orobanche lucorum, though corresponding as well with 
those of Orobanche elatior.

Of Vital Beauty in Plants.
Extracted from ' Modern Painters,' by 
a Graduate of Oxford.
" I PROCEED more particularly to examine the nature of that second 
kind of Beauty of which I spoke in the third chapter, as consisting 
in * the appearance of felicitous fulfilment of function in living things.' 
I have already noticed the example of very pure and high typical 
beauty which is to be found in the lines and gradations of unsullied 
snow.
If, passing to tbe edge of a sheet of it, upon the lower Alps, 
early in May, we find, as we are nearly sure to find, two or three little 
643 
round openings pierced in it, and through these emergent, a slender, 
pensive, fragile flower,* whose small, dark purple, fringed bell hangs 
down and shudders over the icy cleft that it has cloven, as if partly 
wondering at its own recent grave, and partly dying of very fatigue 
after its hard-won victory ; we shall be, or we ought to be, moved by 
a totally different impression of loveliness from that which we receive 
among the dead ice and the idle clouds.
There is now uttered to us 
a call for sympathy, now offered to us an image of moral purpose and 
achievement, which, however unconscious or senseless the creature 
may indeed be that so seems to call, cannot be heard without affec- 
tion, nor contemplated without worship, by any of us whose heart is 
rightly tuned, or whose mind is clearly and surely sighted." â€” p.
84.
" As we pass from those beings of whose happiness and pain we 
are certain, to those in which it is doubtful or only seeming, as pos- 
sibly in plants (though I would fain hold, if I might, * the faith that 
every flower enjoys the air it breathes,' neither do I ever crush or ga- 
ther one without some pain), yet our feeling for them has in it more 
of sympathy than of actual love, as receiving from them in delight far 
more than we can give ; for love, I think, chiefly grows in giving, at 
least its essence is the desire of doing good, or giving happiness, and 
we cannot feel the desire of that which we cannot conceive, so that if 
we conceive not of a plant as capable of pleasure, w^e cannot desire 
to give it pleasure, that is, we cannot love it in the entire sense of the 
term.
Nevertheless, the sympathy of every lofty and sensitive mind 
usually reaches so far as to the conception of life in the f)lant, and so 
to love, as with Shelly, of the sensitive plant, and Shakespeare always, 
as he has taught us in the sweet voices of Ophelia and Perdita, and 
Wordsworth always, as of the daffodils and the celandine.
' It doth not love the shower nor seek the cold.
This neither is its courage nor its choice, 
But its necessity in being old.' 
And so all other great poets (that is to say, great seers) ; nor do I be- 
lieve that any mind, however rude, is without some slight perception 
or acknowledgment of joyousness in breathless things, as most cer- 
tainly there are none but feel instinctive delight in the appearances of 
such enjoyment.
" For it is matter of easy demonstration, that setting the characters 
of typical beauty aside, the pleasure afforded by every organic form 
is in proportion to its appearance of healthy, vital energy j as in a 
* Soldanella alpina.
644 
rose-bush, setting aside all the considerations of gradated flushing 
of colour and fair folding of line, which it shares with the cloud or 
the snow-wreath, we find in and through all this, certain signs plea- 
sant and acceptable as signs of life and enjoyment in the particular 
individual plant itself.
Every leaf and stalk is seen to have a func- 
tion, to be constantly exercising that function, and as it seems, solely 
for the good and enjoyment of the plant.
It is true that reflection 
will show us that the plant is not living for itself alone, that its life is 
one of benefaction, that it gives as well as receives, but no sense 
of this whatsoever mingles with our perception of physical beauty in 
its forms.
Those forms appear to be necessary to its health, the 
symmetry of its leaflets, the smoothness of its stalks, the vivid green 
of its shoots, are looked upon by us as signs of the plant's own happi- 
ness and perfection ; they are useless to us, except as they give us 
pleasure in our sympathizing with that of the plant, and if we see a 
leaf withered, or shrunk, or worm-eaten, we say it is ugly, and feel it 
to be most painful, not because it hurts us, but because it seems to 
hurt the plant, and conveys to us an idea of pain and disease and 
failure of life in it.
" That the amount of pleasure we receive is in exact proportion to 
the appearance of vigour and sensibility in the plant, is easily proved 
by observing the efi'ect of those which show the evidences of it in the 
least degree, as, for instance, any of the Cacti not in flower.
Their 
masses are heavy and simple, their growth slow, their various parts 
iointed on one to another as if they were buckled or pinned together, 
instead of growing out of each other (note the singular imposition in 
many of them, the prickly pear, for instance, of the fruit upon the 
body of the plant, so that it looks like a swelling or disease), and of- 
ten farther opposed by harsh truncations of line, as in the Cactus 
truncato-phylla.
All these circumstances so concur to deprive the 
plant of vital evidences, that we receive from it more sense of pain 
than of beauty ; and yet even here, the sharpness of the angles, the 
symmetrical order and strength of the spines, the fresh and even co- 
lour of the body, are looked for earnestly as signs of healthy condition, 
our pain is increased by their absence, and indefinitely increased if 
blotches, and other appearances of bruise and decay interfere with 
that little life which the plant seems to possess." â€” p.
86.
" Now I wish particularly to impress upon the reader, that all these 
sensations of beauty in the plant arise from our unselfish sympathy 
with its happiness, and not from any view of the qualities in it which 
may bring good to us, nor even from our acknowledgment, is it of 
645 
any moral condition beyond that of mere felicity ; for such an ac- 
knowledgment belongs to the second operation of the theoretic 
faculty, and not to the sympathetic part which we are at present ex- 
amining ; so that we even find that in this respect, the moment we 
begin to look upon any creature as subordinate to some purpose out 
of itself, some of the sense of organic beauty is lost.
Thus, when we 
are told that the leaves of a plant are occupied in decomposing car- 
bonic acid, and preparing oxygen for us, we begin to look upon it 
with some such indifference as upon a gasometer.
It has become a 
machine ; some of our sense of its happiness has gone ; its emanation 
of inherent life is no longer pure.
The bending trunk, waving to and 
fro in the wind above the waterfall, is beautiful because it is happy, 
though it is perfectly useless to us.
The same trunk, hewn down 
and thrown across the stream, has lost its beauty.
It serves as a 
bridge, â€” it has become useful ; it lives not for itself, and its beauty 
is gone, or what it retains is purely typical, dependent on its lines 
and colours, not on its functions.
Saw it into planks, and though 
now adapted to become permanently useful, its whole beauty is lost 
for ever, or to be regained only in part when decay and ruin shall 
have withdrawn it again from use, and left it to receive from the hand 
of Nature the velvet moss and varied lichen, which may again sug- 
gest ideas of inherent happiness, and tint its mouldering sides with 
hues of life.
" There is something, I think, peculiarly beautiful and instructive 
in this unselfishness of the theoretic faculty, and in its abhorrence of 
all utility which is based on the pain or destruction of any creature, 
for in such ministering to each other as is consistent with the essence 
and energy of both each takes delight, as in the clothing of the rock 
by the herbage, and the feeding of the herbage by the stream." â€” p.
88.
" Of the parallel effects of expression upon plants there is little to 
be noted, as the mere naming of the subject cannot but bring count- 
less illustrations to the mind of every reader : only this, that, as we 
saw they were less susceptible of our sympathetic love, owing to the 
the absence in them of capability of enjoyment, so they are less open 
to the affections based upon the expression of moral virtue, owing to 
their want of volition ; so that even on those of them which are dead- 
ly and unkind, we look not without pleasure, the more, because this 
their evil operation cannot be by them outwardly expressed, but only 
by us empirically known ; so that of the outward seemings and ex- 
pressions of plants, there are few but are in some way good, and 
therefore beautiful, as of humility and modesty, and love of places

and things, in the reaching out of their arms and clasping of their 
tendrils ; and energy of resistance, and patience of suffering, and be- 
neficence one toward another in shade and protection, and to us also 
in scents and fruits (for of their healing virtues, however important to 
us, there is no more outward sense nor seeming than of their proper- 
ties mortal or dangerous)." â€” p.
94.
" Let us next observe the conditions of ideality in vegetables.
Out 
of a large number of primroses or violets, I apprehend that, although 
one or two might be larger than all the rest, the greater part would 
be very sufficient primroses and violets.
And that we could by no 
study nor combination of violets, conceive of a better violet than many 
in the bed.
And so generally of the blossoms and separate members 
of all vegetables.
" But among the entire forms of the complex vegetables, as of oak 
trees, for instance, there exists very large and constant difference, 
some being what we hold to be fine oaks, as in parks, and places 
where they are taken care of, and have their own \^'ay, and some are 
but poor and mean oaks, which have had none to take care of them, 
but have been obliged to maintain themselves.
" That which we have to determine is, whether ideality be predic- 
able of the fine oaks only, or whether the poor and mean oaks also 
may be considered as ideal, that is, coming up to the conditions of 
oak, and the general notion of oak.
" Now there is this difference between the positions held in crea- 
tion by animals and plants, and thence in the dispositions, with which 
we regard them ; that the animals being for the most part locomo- 
tive, are capable both of living where they choose, and of obtaining 
what food they want, and of fulfilling all the conditions necessary to 
their health and perfection, for which reason they are answerable for 
such health and perfection and we should be displeased and hurt if 
we did not find it in one individual as well as another.
" But the case is evidently different with plants.
They are intended 
fixedly to occupy many places comparatively unfit for them, and to 
fill up all the spaces where greenness and coolness, and ornament, 
and oxygen are wanted, and that with very little reference to their 
comfort or convenience.
Now it would be hard upon the plant if, 
after being tied to a particular spot, where it is indeed much wanted, 
and is a great blessing, but where it has enough to doto live, whence 
it cannot move to obtain what it wants or likes, but must stretch its 
unfortunate arms here and there for bare breath and light, and split 
its way among rocks and grope for sustenance in unkindly soil ; it 
647 
would be hard upon the plant, I say, if under all these disadvantages 
it were made answerable for its appearance, and found fault with be- 
cause it was not a fine plant of the kind.
And so we find it ordained 
that in order that no unkind comparisons may be drawn between one 
and another, there are not appointed to plants the fixed number, posi- 
tion, and proportion of members which are ordained in animals (and 
any variation from which in these is unpardonable), but a continually 
varying number and position, even among the more freely growing 
examples, admitting therefore all kinds of license to those which have 
enemies to contend with, and that without in any way detracting from 
their dignity and perfection.
" So then there is in trees no perfect form which can be fixed upon or 
reasoned out as ideal, but that is always an ideal oak which, however 
poverty-striken, or hunger-pinched, or tempest-tortured, is yet seen 
to have done, under its appointed circumstances, all that could be ex- 
pected of oak.
" The ideal therefore of the park oak is that to which I alluded in 
the conclusion of the former part of this work, full size, united ter- 
minated curve, equal and symmetrical range of branches on each 
side.
The ideal of the mountain oak may be anything, twisting, and 
leaning, shattered and rock-encumbered, so only that amidst all 
its misfortunes, it maintain the dignity of oak ; and, indeed, I look 
upon this kind of tree as more ideal than the other, in so far as by its 
efforts and struggles, more of its nature, enduring power, patience in 
waiting for, and ingenuity in obtaining what it vrants, is brought out, 
and so more of the expanse of the oak exhibited, than under more 
fortunate conditions.
" And herein, then, we at last find the cause of that fact 
which we have twice already noted that the exalted or seeming- 
ly improved conditions whether of plant or animal, induced by 
human interference, is not the true and artistical ideal of it.* It 
has been well shown by Dr. Herbert, that many plants are found alone 
on a certain soil or subsoil in a wild state, not because such soil is 
favourable to them, but because they alone are capable of existing 
on it, and because all dangerous rivals are by its inhospitality re- 
" * I speak not here of those conditious of vegetation which have especial reference 
to man, as of seeds and fruits, whose sweetness and farina seem in great measure 
given, not for the plant's sake, but for his, and to which therefore the interruption in 
the harmony of creation of which he was the cause is extended ; and their sweetness 
and larger measure of good to be obtained only by his redeeming labour.
His curse 
has fallen on the corn and the vine, and the wild barley misses of its fulness, that he 
may eat bread by the sweat of his brow." 
648 
moved.
Now if we withdraw the plant from this position, which it 
hardly endures, and supply it with the earth, and maintain about it 
the temperature that it delights in, withdrawing from it at the same 
time all rivals which, in such conditions nature would have thrust 
upon it, we shall indeed obtain a magnificently developed example of 
the plant, colossal in size, and splendid in organization, but we shall 
utterly loose in it that moral ideal which is dependent on its right 
fulfilment of its appointed functions.
It was intended and created by 
the Deity for the covering of those lonely spots where no other plant 
could live ; it has been thereto endowed with courage, and strength, 
and capacities of endurance unequalled ; its character and glory are 
not therefore in the gluttonous and idle feeling of its own over luxu- 
riance, at the expense of other creatures utterly destroyed and 
rooted out for its good alone, but in its right doing of its hard duty, 
and forward climbing into those spots of forlorn hope where it alone 
can bear witness to the kindness and presence of the Spirit that cut- 
teth out rivers among the rocks, as it covers the valleys with corn : 
and there, in its vanward place, and only there where nothing is with- 
drawn for it, nor hurt by it, and where nothing can take part of its 
honour, nor usurp its throne, are its strength, and fairness, and price, 
and goodness in the sight of God, to be truly esteemed.
" The first time that I saw the Sondanella alpina, before spoken of, 
it was growing of magnificent size, on a sunny Alpine pasture, among 
bleating of sheep, and lowing of cattle, associated with a profusion of 
Geum montanum, and Ranunculus pyrenseus.
1 noticed it only be- 
cause new to me, nor perceived any peculiar beauty in its cloven 
flower.
Some days after I found it alone, among the rack of the 
higher clouds, and howling of glacier winds, and, as I described it, 
piercing through an edge of avalanche, which in its retiring half left 
the new ground brown and lifeless, and as if burned by recent fire ; 
the plant was poor and feeble, and seemingly exhausted with its 
efforts, but it was then that I comprehended its ideal character, and 
saw its noble function and order of glory among the constellations of 
the earth.
" The Ranunculus glacialis might perhaps by cultivation be blanch- 
ed from its wan and corpse-like paleness to purer white, and won to 
more branched and lofty development of its ragged leaves.
But the 
ideal of the plant is to be found only in the last, loose stones of the 
moraine, alone there ; wet with the cold unkindly drip of the glacier 
water, and trembling as the loose and steep dust to which it clings 
yields ever and anon, and shudders and crumbles away from about 
its root."â€” p.

On the Botany of the neighbourhood of Ross.
By Wm. Hy.
PuiiCHAS, Esq.
The face of the country in this part of Herefordshire is considera- 
bly diversified, and hence the local Flora is more varied and exten- 
sive than in many parts of England.
Of the truth of this remark I 
leave your readers to judge from the appended list of plants growing 
in the district six miles on each side of the town.
From this list 
such plants as are of universal occurrence are, of course, excluded, 
while many are retained, not on account of their rarity, but because, 
from their preference of peculiar situations, the statement of the fre- 
quency or rarity in which they occur will give a general idea of the 
Botany of the neighbourhood.
The general dependence of the Flora of a district upon the geolo- 
gical formation, receives a striking illustration at Coldwell (about se- 
ven miles from hence), where the mountain limestone appears for a 
short distance forming some fine rocks, and separated only by the 
river, there fifty or sixty yards wide, from the old red sandstone, the 
general formation of the county.
On the side of the river where the 
last-mentioned stratum is found, the plants are the usual ones of the 
neighbourhood, but immediately on crossing, Hypericum montanum.
Origanum vulgare, Ophrys muscifera and apifera, Helianthemum vul- 
gare, Prunus Aria, Prenanthes muralis and Polypodium Dryopteris,

heaps of debris at the foot of the rocks.

Effects of Agitation and Rest upon Plants submerged in Water.
Communicated by Mr. Ward to the Linnean Society.
" Mr. Ward exhibited specimens of the the extreme states of 
Chondrus crispus {Lingb.), gathered by him at Linmouth, N.
Devon, 
growing within a few feet of each other, but under different condi- 
tions ; the broad variety being found in pools among the rocks, where 
it is always submersed, the narrow on the outer ledge of rocks, where 
it is fully exposed to the action of the waves, which produce the same 
053 
effect upon it as is frequently observed in fresh-water aquatics, the 
submersed leaves of which become more or less finely divided in pro- 
portion to the greater or less rapidity of the stream.
It is worthy of 
remark, that the broad state, which is found in comparatively still 
water, is wholly free from zoophytes, while the narrow is entirely 
coated with them." â€” Proceedings of the Linnean Society, 1846, p.

TJie Potato Mania.
By the Editor.
We never recollect a subject that drew forth such a cloud of authors 
as the failure of the potato crop : not only every botanist, but every 
agriculturalist, every gardener, every political economist has rushed in a 
kind of poetic frenzy to his inkstand, and hastened to the printing office 
with the results.
Long unmeaning papers, that on any other subject 
would not have been tolerated for a moment, have on this fashionable 
topic been read with patience and even delight, and we verily believe 
that nothing could be written so absurd, as not to command attention and 
respect.
The poor starving Irishman, with 7d.
for his day's wages, 
has been seriously recommended to erect buildings and apparatus for 
slicing, drying and grinding into flour, the produce of his rood of 
potatoes ; and this, bitter and cruel as the jest may seem to the reflect- 
ing mind, has been sent forth with authority.
In fact nothing has been 
deemed too outrageous to recommend; and those who would scarcely 
know a potato from a turnip, in the field or storehouse, have taken a 
distinguished lead in suggesting alterations in the mode of cultivation 
and storing.
There can be no doubt that this unparalleled mania for writing on 
the subject, has produced a greatly exaggerated idea of the calamity.
The writer of these observations is a householder, and has many 
mouths to feed; potatoes are required in some abundance ; his own 
eating takes place at a variety of places, but no day passes without a 
demand for potatoes, nor without the demand being abundantly sup- 
plied.
Now whether as regards the cost as an item of housekeeping, or 
the quantity supplied wherever he may happen to dine, or the quality of 
the potatoes set before him, he has never in any instance perceived indi- 
cations of scarcity or inferiority, and the fact of the existence of scarcity 
or inferiority is unknown to him, except through the medium of the 
printing-press : and yet there is no doubt that, at the present moment, 
the price of the potato is driven up to the highest pitch to which 
speculation, founded on the newspaper reports, can possibly force it.

If therefore this universal mania for writing on the subject, and this 
boundless love of speculation, produce no effects that he can feel, may 
he not reasonably hope that the calamity is not so enormous as the pub- 
lic has been led to suppose?
â€” may he not hope that it is one which 
by prudence, judgment, and above all by experiment, may yet be 
averted from those whom it seems more particularly to threaten ?
We happen to possess that peculiar temperament that is more in- 
fluenced by precise facts than by superlative expressions : thus, if the 
parish of Littletown produced 20,000 tons of potatoes in 1844, 18,000 
in 1845, and 16,000 in 1846, we should have facts to comment on; 
and if a thousand parishes taken together exhibited an equal decrease, 
it would become still more serious, and calculations might be made 
with still greater precision : but no one seems to aim at obtaining 
or disseminating such information as this.
If the facts of the case were 
as we have stated, we should find them set forth in these terms, " horri- 
ble famine in Littletown, total failure of the potato crop." Living in 
Littletown we should know this statement to be false, and should there- 
fore doubt the truth of any similar statements.
Let us come to tons, 
hundred-weights, quarters and pounds, or to pounds, shillings and 
pence, anything intelligible, but vague poetical statements, albeit 
clothed in forcible language, have little weight with the lovers of 
facts.
That there is disease, and consequently deficiency, it is impossible 
to doubt ; the statements cannot be altogether false ; but there is so 
much exaggeration, so great a love of the marvellous, that it requires a 
very sound judgment, and no small portion of labour, to separate the 
real from the ideal, truth from fiction.
After taking the preliminary step of ascertaining with something 
approaching to precision the real amount of the injury, the next 
would be to publish the result, and thus defeat, as far as practicable, 
the interested designs of speculators, and at the same time allay the 
fears which had been raised by fictitious or exaggerated statements.
It is to be feared that no information can be gained as to the cause of 
the disease, at least the labours of botanists have failed in achieving 
this most desirable object.
Nevertheless we may consider the question 
of mitigation or cure, which, in the absence of all knowledge of the 
complaint is certainly a difficult one, nor do I know any other resource 
than experiment, and here we have been wofully deficient.
Instead 
of the innumerable and elaborately detailed suggestions and recom- 
mendations as to different modes of treatment, the very penning of 
which must have been a work of prodigious labour, the recommenders 
655 
should have quietly and unostentatiously devoted themselves to expe- 
rimenting on the plant itself; tried diflferent modes of earthing up; diffe- 
rent degrees of drought and moisture; varied exposure to light and shade ; 
variety of soil and manure; different periods of planting; different 
periods of digging ; different distances in planting, both as regards 
the individuals and the rows ; different modes of preparing the cut- 
tings, and indeed a thousand departures from the usual routine mode 
of cultivation.
It is hardly possible that many trials of this kind 
could be made without some result; and the pubh cation of the results 
would be infinitely more acceptable than a host of recommendations 
in which experience has had no part.
There is another matter which should have its weight, and conse- 
quently its consolation, with all reflecting minds, and that is the ex- 
treme improbability of the disease continuing to exist: whether result- 
ing from atmospheric agency, the coldness of the summer of 1845, the 
dryness and heat of the summer of 1846, the presence of fungi, the de- 
predations of insects, the Maynooth grant orthei'epeal of the corn-laws, 
which seven causes have been urged with serious and unhesitating faith 
in their validity, we must not anticipate a continuance of what is so great 
a departure from the usual course of nature.
The atmospheric conditions 
may be changed, thefungi may disappear, the insects may die, a no-po- 
pery government may refuse Maynooth grants, and Lord George Ben- 
tinck may be Prime Minister, and give us new corn-laws : in fine if we 
refer to precedent we shall find it abundantly in the history of the past.
Blights, murrains, diseases of man, of beasts, of plants, have repeatedly 
occun-ed, have passed away, and would be forgotton were it not for 
the records that have been preserved : on one occasion the hedges 
were stripped of their leaves by the devastation of a caterpillar {Arctia 
chrysorrhoea), and on the same occasion a multiplicity of natural and 
political causes was found ; some very pious persons firmly believed 
the devastation attributable to the general establishment of Lancas- 
terian schools : then we have had plague, cholera, failure of wheat, tur- 
nips and hops, but a time of health and plenty has always returned, and 
will again.
Whatever be the amount of the disease â€” and far be it from 
us to doubt its existence â€” let us meet it like men : let us coolly ascer- 
tain the worst, and having possessed ourselves of this knowledge, let 
those who are really practical men make the experiments we have 
suggested and report the result, and let all the rest, the fine writers, 
the essayists, the religionists, the politicians, turn their attention from 
causes to effects, ascertain the distress which an increased price of 
potatoes may cause among their poorer neighbours, and then, putting 
656 
their hands in their pockets, furnish them with the means of buying 
bread instead.
Let the leading papers give their thousand pounds 
each, let Dr. Buckland give his thousand pounds, and all the minor 
actors, on the potato-stage, suras in proportion to their essays and 
orations: this is the way to meet the evil and to rejoice the hearts of 
the sufferers.
These observations may perhaps be allowed to serve as an introduc- 
tion to the following sensible paragraphs which appear as the leading 
article in last week's 'Gardener's Chronicle' a paper which has however 
devoted far too much space to the 'notoriety seeking' scribes on this 
hackneyed subject to be excused from a liberal contribution to the 
general fund.
" Last year, wherever the tops of the Potatoes were blighted, the 
tubers were also, invariably, decayed.
We are not aware of any example 
to the contrary.
This year it is not so.
We have ourselves seen Potato 
fields with all the tops blighted, and yet the crop, a very scanty one, 
was either free from disease, or inconsiderably affected.
Our Paris 
correspondent, of last week, spoke to the same fact.
Near Hythe, 
in Kent, the crop is better than last year, both in quantity and quality, 
although the plants were blighted ; and we know that the circum- 
stance is by no means uncommon.
In other cases a second crop of 
small tubers is forming; so that great as the mischief no doubt is, yet 
it is much less than last year in some places.
What does this mean ?
Of course such a fact may be taken to signify that the atmosphere 
was the vehicle by which disease was communicated to the tuber; 
and that in these instances the atmospheric influence, whatever it may 
be, which has swept over the face of the country, was resisted by the 
vigour of the Potato crop.
"Some weeks ago acorrespondent mentioned a report that the Potato 
crops, within the influence of the smoke from the copper works round 
Swansea, were saved from the blight, although the crops perished be- 
yond the circle of their influence.
It was also asserted in the Cam- 
brian newspaper, that: â€” 
"' Last year the Potatoes reared in the neighbourhood of the copper 
works turned out to be healthy, and that in the present season the 
fact is still more determined.
While in Sketty, Langyfelach, and all 
around, the Potatoes are universally diseased, it so happens that in 
the immediate vicinity of the smoke they are sound and healthy, with 
scarcely a trace of disease to be found in them.' 
" This has been contradicted.
But we are now in a condition to 
show that the statement alluded to was true.
The following letter 
657 
from a resident near Swansea sets the question at rest, by proving that 
the copper smoke does protect the Potato crop, and effectually !
"'On the 31st Aug., I examined many pieces of Potatoes within the 
immediate influence of the copper smoke from the smelting works in 
this neighbourhood.
There is no occasion perhaps to note the indi- 
vidual cases, but the general result is that the leaves, haulm, and 
tubers, improve as you approach the works, and that the nearest gar- 
dens, little more than 200 yards from them, are entirely free from the 
blight, and the crop good in quality, quantity, and flavour.
The Po- 
tatoes are of different sorts.
These last-named gardens, as I am in- 
formed by the proprietor, entirely escaped the disease in 1845, and 
have borne Potatoes for 40 years.
The Potatoes are also said to have 
escaped in the vicinity of the chemical works at Newcastle.
As a kin- 
dred misfortune, I may mention that a disease producing rottenness, 
occurs in many instances here in the white Turnip, and it is to be 
feared that its earliest stage is perceptible in the Swedes.
â€” Matthew 
Moggridge, the Willows, Swansea, Sep. 4.' 
" Here it may be urged by the advocates of atmospheric contagion, 
that one miasm has had the power of repelling another from the Potato 
field.
" In former numbers we have given other instances of a similar kind, 
though far less striking, ; such as Potatoes under the shelter of trees, 
or of a mixed crop, or of hedgerows, having also been saved.
These 
also point to atmospheric influence.
Mr. Nevin, in his very valuable 
pamphlet,* adopts the atmospheric theory without hesitation.
Never- 
theless, we are as unable as ever to reconcile this theory with the 
whole of the facts known to us.
We are indebted to Mr. Beck, of 
Isleworth, for the following observation, which bears directly uj)on 
the present question: â€” 
" ' I had a small piece of Ash-leaved Kidneys, which ripened off" a 
healthy yellow colour, and so died down to the ground without a speck of 
the disease.
There was not a speck of it on any of the tubers we cooked.
There was no appearance on the portion I had saved for seed, and 
which was laid out for greening.
But on Saturday last (Sept.
12), I 
was surprised to find that a considerable portion of the whole quanti- 
ty (about a bushel) was greatly affected.
The whole mischief had 
been done in a few days ; for we were about to put them away 
the early part of the week, but thought a few days longer exposure 
would be better.
I had no other Potatoes in my garden, nor are 
there any near me.
I am surrounded on three sides with high 
* ' The Potato Epidemic, and its probable Consequences.' 
658 
walls ; on the fourth, a high Quickset hedge and Grass field form the 
boundary.' 
" We have ourselves a somewhat similar case, with a new variety, 
called " Willison's seedling," the offspring, no doubt, of the Ash- 
leaved Kidney.
It grew, remained healthy, and ripened without a 
trace of disease.
When taken up, the tubers were absolutely sound.
They were laid by in a dry shed, well covered with mats, and in a 
few weeks symptoms of disease, slight ones, made their appearance 
in the tubers.
Similar instances occurred last year with sound Po- 
tatoes that were attacked in sand, kept constantly in a dry place, and 
that never formed tops.
These are apparently irreconcilable with 
atmospheric agency, whether miasm, or anything else, unless it is as- 
sumed that the supposed disease acts directly upon the Potato.
"Even the curious state of the Tomato crop in some places, although 
at first sight favouring the opinion, seems to be, on the whole, irrecon- 
cilable with it.
This fruit has this year been extensively injured in 
the country round London, by a rot, which attacks the ripening Ap- 
ple, and renders it unfit for use.
Sometimes the leaves are blotched, 
sometimes not.
It is evidently, we think, the same as the disease of 
the Potato 'Apple,' or fruit, and in both cases is, as far as we have 
seen, unaccompanied by fungi.
It appears on the exposed side, where 
the fruit receives the most air ; and therefore, it may be said, is at- 
tacked by something in the atmosphere.
But there is this difiiculty 
in the way of admitting such an explanation : the supposed miasm 
ought to attack all Tomatoes in the neighbourhood of tainted Potato 
fields ; but it does not.
Our excellent correspondent " Quercus," 
than whom there is not a more close, shrewd, practical observer, finds 
no such disease in his Tomatoes ; and we have lately seen beautiful sam- 
ples of this fruit in the market of Boulogne, all round which place the 
Potato crops arc blighted.
The French peasants had not even heard 
of the Tomatoes being attacked.
We respectfully present these facts 
to the consideration of those who are striving to find out the cause of 
the Potato disease.
They not only must not be neglected, but no 
theory can be accepted which fails to include them in its scope.
One 
thing, however, they seem to dispose of conclusively, and that is the 
notion that the potato disease is to be kept off by regeneration from 
seed.
Tomatoes are annually regenerated from seed, and Tomatoes 
suffer like Potatoes." 
In many of these remarks our readers will perceive that there is 
much good sense : the idea of appealing to facts is sound, and pos- 
sesses in a great degree the additional charm of novelty : it is a move 
in the right direction, and will be respected by all right-minded readers.
659 
We cannot conclude these observations better than with the report 
published in the ' Athenceum,' of the doings of the British Association 
on this absorbing subject ; the opinions expressed by the savans are 
somewhat too varied to be generally received ; but we think Dr. Lan- 
kester's concluding remark, though somewhat uncomplimentary to 
the Association, will receive universal assent : we have italicised the 
remark to which we allude.
Mr. W.
HoGAN read a paper ' On Potatoes raised from Seed, as a 
means of preventing the extension of the prevailing disease.' â€” EJe 
first read extracts from German publications, giving the result of the 
trial of growing potatoes from the seed of the plant, which had been 
found to be successful as far as the production of tubers, and also the 
preventing the prevailing disease.
Mr. Hogan had also tried the same 
process with success.
The proceeding consisted in growing the seeds 
first in a hot-bed, and then transplanting.
He considered this to be 
a successful way, because the most natural.
Mr. M.
Stirling stated that he had, some time since, recommended 
to the Government of Sweden the plan of procuring the potato seed, 
and deriving thence the crops.
He had advised giving prizes for the 
best seedling potatoes, and he also recommended hybridizing the 
potato, as a means of improvement.
â€” Mr. W.
Ogilby thought grow- 
ing potatoes from the seeds might prevent the scurf and dry rot, but 
not the present wet rot of the potato.
He quoted several instances in 
which seedling crops had been destroyed.
He had been most suc- 
cessful in growing potatoes from a little tuber which sprung from the 
"eyes" of the old ones going to decay.
â€” Dr. Crook attributed the 
attack in the year 1845 to " cold." The cold burst the vessels ; and 
then came the disease.
Heat produces the same effects as cold ; it 
bursts the tissues of the vessels, and the consequence is disease.
â€” Dr.
Daubeny did not think that atmospheric changes had anything to do 
with the disease at all.
He thought that the most satisfactory theory 
was that which referred the disease to fungi.
He had understood 
that there was no potato disease in the neighbourhood of the copper 
furnaces in Swansea.
â€” Dr. Buckland had lately visited Prof.
Payen, 
who advocated the doctrine that the disease arose from fungi; and 
he (Dr. Buckland) believed so too.
There was, in fact, a fungiferous 
miasm existing, which, like cholera, attacked not all, but those who 
were pre-disposed.
It was the weak and intemperate that were 
attacked with cholera ; it was the debilitated potato that had the dis- 
ease.
Extreme conditions of temperature debilitated the potato, and 
then it became diseased.
The potatoes were suddenly attacked.
He 
660 
knew a case in which a whole field became diseased in three days.
He believed the only remedy was mowing down the haulm of the 
potato the moment it was attacked.
â€” Prof.
L. Playfair was certain of 
one thing, â€” and that was, that the disease was not due to fungi.
The 
nature of it was evident, as it could be produced artificially.
If you 
scraped a potato and placed it in the open air it became diseased ; â€” 
and, in the course of a few hours, the fungi would appear on it.
â€” Mr.
E. Solly believed that the disease depended on chemical changes, 
not on the attack of the fungus.
â€” Mr. Bush had examined the dis- 
eased potatoes under the microscope, and in its early stages had al- 
ways failed to discover the slightest indication of the existence of a 
fungus.
As the disease advances, first one fungus appears, and then 
another, â€” and at last animal life.
This was the progress of all vegeta- 
tive decay.
The disease always commences on the outside of the 
potato, and proceeds to the centre.
He had always found the disease 
constantly attended with the development of crystals of oxalate of 
lime.
â€” Prof.
Balfour stated that some fungi attacked living and 
healthy structures, â€” others only diseased ones.
The fungus of the 
potato wasaBotrytis which he believed attacked healthy structures.
â€” 
Mr. A.
Strickland said, in reference to Dr. Buckland's recommenda- 
tion to mow down the potatoes, that, when his neighbours mowed 
down their potatoes, he dug his up.
They had lost neai'ly all theirs, 
whilst he had saved nearly all his.
â€” Dr. Lankester observed on the 
want of evidence to support the theories of either cause or remedies 
that had been brought forward.
Cold and heat had been assigned as 
causes, by destroying the tissues of the potato ; but no destroyed tis- 
sues had been shown to exist.
Debility had also been supposed to 
exist ; but no proof was given of the existence of debility ; â€” and the 
Dean of Westminster himself had admitted that he had seen the 
healthiest potatoes destroyed in three days.
Positive observation was 
evidently opposed to the fungus theory.
As to the remedies recom- 
mended, seedlings had been known to be attacked in more cases than 
Ihey had escaped; and, therefore, sowing the seeds could not be 
recommended.
Mowing down the stalks had not been more successful 
than letting them alone ; â€” and it ought now to he known, that this 
Meeting had done nothing more valuable than to show the insuffi- 
ciency of all theories and remedies hitherto advancedy 
Alas !
then, how little has it done !

On the Leaves of Phyllanthiis and Xylophylla.
"A paper was read by Dr. Lankester, from Mr. B.
Clarke, ' On the 
Foliage and Inlloresence of the genera Phyllanthus and Xylophylla.' 
â€” The leafy appendages from which the flowers in most of the species 
of these genera spring, have been described by authors in general, up 
to the present time, as branches.
The author, having examined their 
structure and relations closely, has come to the conclusion that they 
are in almost all cases true leaves.
Several species of the genera Phyl- 
lanthus and Xylophylla were described ; and the author's views of 
their structure explained by drawings.
In conclusion, he suggested 
whether the additional leaf-buds, which are sometimes seen in the axils 
of leaves, do not originate from the base of the petiole.
Such buds 
occur in the genus Rubus, in some species of which the additional 
bud is developed beneath the axillary bud instead of one side of it."

Autumnal powering of Trees and Shrubs.
By Edward Newman.
The summer which seems at last about to leave us, has been 
remarkable for unusual abundance of sunshine and unusual defi- 
ciency of rain.
From the middle of May to the first of August, the fine 
weather was uninterrupted : on that day occurred the memorable 
storm of hail and rain, and the weather for ten days continued unset- 
tled, inclining to rain : from that time to the present it has been 
almost uniformly bright, dry and serene.
Whether we are to attri- 
bute to these circumstances the facts I am about to mention, I must* 
leave others to decide ; they seem worthy of this slight record.
During the last week in August, and nearly throughout September, 
we have had a second inflorescence on the following trees.
Horse Chesnut.
On one tree, a general and healthy bloom accom- 
panied by a general reproduction of young leaves : â€” maximum, 29th 
August.
Fruit produced.
Plane {Acer pseudoplatanus).
On one tree, a general and healthy 
bloom ; on several others a partial bloom: â€” maximum 31st August.
Corchorus or Kerria Japonica.
A general and healthy bloom on a 
great number of trees : â€” maximum, 2ud September.
Laburnum {Cyiisus Laburnum).
A very partial but beautiful bloom, 
on a great number of trees:â€” -maximum, 2nd September.
Fruit subse- 
quently produced.
4 N 
662 
Pear tree.
On one tree a general and healthy bloom : â€” maximum, 
6th September.
Pyrus Japonica.
On very many trees a scattered but healthy bloom 
up to the present time.
Apple tree.
On one tree a general and healthy bloom ; on others, a 
partial bloom: â€” maximum 10th September.
Elder, [Scwibucus niger.) On one tree a general and most beautiful 
bloom: â€” maximum, 17th September.
Acacia.
[Robmia pseiidacacia).
On two trees a general and most 
healthy bloom : â€” maximum, 11th September.
I do not know whether these two trees had previously flowered 
during the present year.
In a great number of instances the lime stems have produced a 
second and abundant covering of leaves ; but I have not observed 
blossoms.
In London and its immediate vicinity, the leaves remain 
on the limes but a very few weeks ; in Wellclose Square, I have 
known the trees entirely stripped before the end of July.
In Bishops- 
gate church-yard they usually remain ten days later.

On the occurrence of Juncus diffusus near Hoddesdon, and on its 
specific distinctness from J.
glaucus.
By John Ansell, Esq.
Not having observed any notice of the Juncus diffusus of Hoppeui 
the ' Phytologist,' since Mr. Backhouse's mention of it in the number 
for November, 1844, I presume that no one has recently met with 
it, and that it is still a plant unknown to the generality of British 
'botanists.
Perhaps too its having been made a variety of J.
glaucus 
in the ' London Catalogue,' may have prevented so much attention being 
given to it as it deserves.
As I have recently seen it growing in great 
plenty, and feel satisfied of its distinctness as a species, I wish to 
draw the attention of your readers to it, that this point may be set- 
tled, and something learned of its distribution in Britain.
On Saturday afternoon last, I paid a visit to Hoddesdon, in company 
with Mr. Coleman of this place.
We gathered Salvia verbenaca, 
Stellaria glauca, Spergula nodosa, Polygonum minus, Mentha sylves- 
tris, Silene noctiflora, &c., in the neighbourhood of Hoddesdon, and 
were shown Iberis amara, growing with Delphinium consolida and 
Calendula officinalis, in a corn-field there.
In returning to Hertford 
byway of Goose-green and Mangrove-lane, about sun-set, we diverged 
into a barren pasture, (about three miles south of Hertford, and 
663 
adjoining Broxbourne Wood, ou the North), to look at Calamagrostis 
Epigejos growing in the hedge.
Here our attention was caught by a 
tuft of rushes, which Mr. Coleman at once pronounced to be J.
diffusus, 
being acquainted with the plant by a previous discovery of it 
near Cole-green, three miles West of Hertford, in the year 1844.
Sin- 
gularly enough we were unable to find any more in the pasture than 
this one tuft, though it was overrun with other species of Juncus ; 
but on emerging from this field on to a small scrap of roadside grass 
called Darman's green (already known to us as one of the numerous 
stations for Carex axillaris in this county), we were delighted to find 
that there was as much of J.
diffusus as J.
glaucus, in the large crop of 
rushes it produced.
I observed that the two plants might be distin- 
guished at a distance of several yards, even by the imperfect light we 
then had, the sun having now set, by the dark hue which the large 
black shining capsules gave to the panicle of J.
glaucus, those of J.
diffusus being of a light brown, and far smaller.
In the large series 
of specimens which we gathered, we found no intermediate forms ; 
but the species were always readily distinguishable by good and con- 
stant characters; J.
glaucus having constantly a fluted stem with 
inten'upted pith, and an elliptic capsule about equal to the segments 
of the perianth : while J.
diffusus has a smooth stem with continuous 
pith, and an obovate truncate capsule, shorter than the perianth.
In 
the truncate capsule it approaches nearer to J.
effusus and J.
con- 
glomeratus : but in these the capsule equals the perianth and is nearly 
as broad as long, not elongate as in our plant, and the scales at the base 
of the stem are not, in Juncus diffusus, light-coloured and scarious 
(as is the case in them), but dark brown and polished as in J.
glaucus.
I enclose specimens for your satisfaction, and, if you think them 
worth your acceptance, shall be happy to place in your hands a supply 
for distribution among your friends and correspondents.
John Ansell.
P. S.
An evening or two since I met with Amaranthus retroflexus, 
Linn., ou waste ground near Hertford; it has also been found by Mr.
Wolsey near Sawbridgeworth, and seems as much entitled as some 
others to a place in our floras.
I find also Setaria viridis, and Panicum 
Crus-galli in the same place.

On the power of Oxalis Acelosella and Viola canina to produce fertile 
Seed without apparent inflorescence.
By H.
Deane, Esq.* 
It is now about five years since I had a glass case made wherein to 
grow a few hardy ferns, after the manner pi-oposed by Mr. Ward, 
and in which I discovered the curious fact lately mentioned to you 
respecting the fertilization of the seed of Oxalis Acetosella, without 
the slightest appearance of inflorescence, and T will now endeavour to 
give you a correct history of the facts as observed, that in case you 
should think them worth recording in your Phytologist you may do so.
Having planted my ferns in small pots, they were arranged in the 
case, and intermediate spaces carefully and lightly filled in with some 
moss obtained from a neighbouring nurseryman.
Moss was also 
placed over the mould in the pots, to keep it moist and to protect the 
young ferns.
In the course of a few weeks many plants began to 
spring forth from the moss, and among them a few of Oxalis Acetosella.
As with me the wood-sorrel has ever been a favourite plant, I allowed 
them to grow.
The first year they did not flower, but in the follow- 
ing spring they did, but without that peculiar character which adds 
so much to the beauty of the plant in its natural state, viz., the red- 
ness of the stalks, and the delicate striated appearance of the petals.
At first I doubted its identity with my old favourite, but thought seed- 
pods would soon decide the matter.
Alas !
before the pods had time 
to mature, the flower-stalks broke down with dropsical decay, and my 
hopes were gone for that season.
However the plants grew vigor- 
ously, and numerous seedlings had from the early spring made their 
appearance, so there was no fear of the stock being lost.
I watched 
my plants almost daily through the summer, and from the day that 
the last flower fell to the ground, many buds reared their heads above 
the foliage, and at length fell dropsical and abortive, as I thought, 
without an attempt at expansion.
Thus the second year passed 
away.
In the mean time I was much puzzled and surprised at the number 
of seedling plants, that continued to rise in all directions.
The third year, as my ferns did not make satisfactory progress, 
the pots were removed, the greater part of the Oxalis thrown away, 
and the moss shaken up and mixed with a little garden mould, in 
which bed the ferns were planted mostly without the pots.
The old 
rhizomes of the Oxalis that escaped destruction, soon made new 
plants, and numerous seedlings also sprang up, so that I began to 
* In a letter addressed to E.
Newman.
665 
think of the old proverb, that " familiarity begets contempt," even 
with old friends.
Well, I let them grow, but there was no attempt at 
flowering this year, although numerous buds continued for months to 
arise from the strongest plant.
Still seedlings kept coming up, and I 
began to observe many seeds of a brownish yellow colour, lying on 
the surface of the mould, and here and there suspended in the foliage 
of the ferns.
My curiosity was now much excited to ascertain the mean- 
ing of this, particularly as the seeds soon vegetated and produced 
young plants of the Oxalis.
I watched carefully and repeatedly at 
all hours of the day, and soon had my pains rewarded by seeing the 
pods, that had been formed without having expanded or flowered, 
discharge their seeds with great force.
There could now be no doubt 
as to the source of most of my young plants of this season.
Succeeding 
years have shown the same series of phenomena, but as this summer 
they were becoming too plentiful, I took out all I could find, yet 
there are two or three again making their appearance, and will enable 
me to give you a living plant in the state T have been describing.
So long as there was no resting place for the seeds on the surface 
of the moss, and the fronds of my ferns were too small for them to 
lodge on, the real truth of the matter eluded my observation.
But 
now there can be no doubt of the fact, that these seeds were fully 
matured and made capable of germinating, and did germinate through 
several generations, although, from the first appearance of the bud, 
it assumed and maintained the appearance of a pod of seed, without 
the slightest outward trace of a corolla, stamens or pistils!
I am but a sorry botanist, although fond of plants as most persons, 
and cannot therefore describe the anatomy of these metamorphosed 
flowers, yet I will give you my viev/s in a ^e^ words, which you can 
verify or disprove by your superior knowledge and discrimination, 
with the assistance of the pickled plant you will receive with this 
letter.
In the early spring, flower-buds arose and expanded in the natural 
manner.
As soon as the usual flowering period was passed, a multi- 
tude of flower-buds continued to arise, but instead of their proceed- 
ing to form petals for the corolla, the calyx, or rather the membra- 
nous edge of the calyx only, seemed to enlarge, forming a pod of a 
pale yellowish green colour, spotted with pale dirty pink spots.
When these pods had acquired the size of a large pea, and sometimes 
when smaller, they appeard to be ripe, a little slit suddenly opened and 
discharged one or two seeds, and these discharges took place at inter- 
66Q 
vals until nearly all the seeds had left the capsule.
By that time 
the dropsy had got the mastery of the stalk that supported the pod 
and down it fell.
The force with which they were propelled, sent 
many of them a distance of two feet, and each discharge was accom- 
panied by a smart cracking sound.
This mode of fructification I have found has not been confined to 
my Ward's case, for a plant that had been put into a pot and kept in 
the open air, where it vegetated but indifferently in consequence of 
smuts and dust, also fructified in the same way without a blossom.
1 
have also at this time a plant of the dog violet ( Viola canina) that is 
passing through similar changes, which you shall have for inspection, 
as the inferences to be drawn from the circumstance will be bet- 
ter from your pen than mine.
H. Deane.
Clapham, September 18th, 1846.
P. S.
I should have mentioned that the case is placed under a 
wall nearly due north, and surrounded with buildings, so that it rarely 
happens to get a ray of sunshine.

Several species of Fungi, new to science, or new to Britain, are de- 
scribed in the paper of Messrs.
Berkeley and Broome.
The regular 
arrangement of crystals is detected by Mr. Quekett in the testa of the 
seeds of Ulmus campestris, and in the sepals of Geraniacea and Mai- 
667 
vaceas.
On the ground of this similar peculiarity, supported by 
various analogies of structure and number of parts, Mr. Quekett 
thinks that Malvaceae should be placed nearer to Geraniaceaj than 
they are usually placed by systeraatists ; Balsaminaceae, Tropajo- 
laceae, Oxalidaceae and Linaceae, showing no such arrangement 
of crystals.
But the fact of the regularity is, perhaps, more im- 
portant than the infei'cnce connected with technical arrangements; 
for we are afterwards informed by Mr. Quekett, that " the sepals of 
the strawberry exhibit the clustered variety as seen in the Gerania- 
ceae.'" The remarks on Cucurbitaceas bear chiefly on views of 
structure as connected with technical classification, and appear 
matters of intellectual curiosity, more than points of practical use- 
fulness ; but they deserve the space allotted to them.
Bouchardat's 
conclusion, in antagonism with that of Saussure, is, "that a ve- 
getable freely immersed by its roots, in a very dilute solution of 
several salts, having no chemical action on its tissues, absorbs all 
the substances contained in that solution in equal proportions."

Notice of a Monstrosity in the Flowers of the common Sweet William 
(Dianthus barbatus), found at Ross, June 27, 1846.
By Wm.
H. PuRCHAS, Esq.
In this curious state of the plant each branch of the fascicle, the 
ultimate ones excepted, produced a flower, of which the calyx was 
unusually large, yet having no more than the usual number of teeth, 
the petals unusually numerous, and the stamens wholly wanting.
In the centre of the flower was one large ovary, closed at the top, 
and containing, besides imperfect ovules, a second ovary, and this, 
again, enclosing a third and very imperfect one.
Surrounding this 
large ovary were five more or less imperfect flowers, all destitute of 
calyx, and having their pedicels inserted in a fleshy ring.
Of some 
the ovaries contained ovules, of others, a succession of carpel-like 
leaves.
Although there were no stamens in the main flower, a few 
were intermixed with the petals of the smaller ones.
A somewhat similar monstrosity occurred at the same time in a 
668 
flower of the clove carnation.
The calyx was not remarliable except 
for its size, the petals and stamens were very numerous ; in the cen- 
tre of the flower was one large ovary, open at the top, from which, at 
small intervals, sprang five styles.
This ovary contained, besides, a 
few rudimentary ovules at the base, five or more ovaries, one within 
the other ; one or two contained some rudiments of ovules, the inner- 
most and very small one, a few leaf-like scales only.
Mixed with 
the petals were five or more rudimentary ovaries on pedicels, and 
surrounded by petals.

The occurrence of Crocus 7UtdiJlorus in Meadows near Derby.
By J.

Having learned fi-om an old list of Derbyshire plants that Crocus 
nudiflorus was formerly found in the neighbourhood of Derby, I start- 
ed on Saturday last in quest of it, I was fortunate enough to find it 
in abundance in a large meadow called the Siddalls, on the banks of 
the Derwent, near the Derby railway station.
Should this rare and beautiful plant be a desideratum with any of 
the readers of the ' Phytologist,' I shall be happy to supply them with

Correction of an Error.
By Edward Foester, Esq.
In your last 'Phytologist,' (Phytol.
ii.
611), your printer, under Pe- 
dicularis palustris, has made me say that which I did not intend, 
*'near the Sea sparingly." I wrote Lea, meaning the river Lea. The 
spot where I have seen it, is in Walthamstow marsh, opposite Upper 
Clapton, not far from the High bridges.
There is also the trifling 
omission of a letter in the name of the house at Woodford, in which 
Warner, the author of the ' Plantoe Woodfordienses,' dwelt : it should 
be Harts, not Hart.
I hope Mr. Salmon has no reason to suspect that the Cyperus fus- 
cus was planted on Shalford Common ; if not, this second discovery 
069 
of so rare a plant is exceedingly interesting.
Having already ex- 
pressed my sentiments on this very improper practice, I need not now 
repeat my protest against it.

Fairy Rings.
By the Editor.
Our observations in the September number (Phytol.
ii.
620) seem to 
have attracted that attention to which we think the subject is fairly 
entitled: supposing the theory we have therein promulged to be true, 
then are the innumerable hypotheses of fairy-rings, without a single 
exception, based on error: supposing, on the other hand, our views 
to be hypothetical, then must deductions be no longer drawn from 
facts, but our knowledge must cease and determine with the facts 
themselves.
For our own part, we have always held that theory is 
the legitimate child of science, and we regard the aspersions so often 
cast on theory, as the natural result of mental inability to distin- 
guish between theory and hypothesis.
Now hypothesis being found- 
ed on figment, can have no claim to a place in any walk of science, 
for the very essence of science is fact, truth, reality.
Our view of the 
origin of fairy-rings, then, comes clearly under the denomination of 
theory, being deduced from obvious fact.
There was, however, one point left untouched, and that a most in- 
teresting, if not important one : we allude to the altered colour of the 
grass, indeed, to that very circumstance which has called attention to 
the subject ; for were not these rings marked by the altered colour, 
we doubt the circular distribution of the agaiics ever leading to an 
inquiry into the cause : we could readily have suggested that the de- 
composition of the agarics fertilised the soil, but we found ourselves 
without proof of their fertilising properties.
This proof is now sup- 
plied.
A Mr. Way has subjected some of the agarics to a chemical ex- 
amination, and has found that they contained 87*46 per cent, of water 
and 12'54 per cent, of dry matter.
He has given the following analy- 
sis of the dry matter : â€”

Those who are acquainted with the recently published theory of 
manures, will at once see from this analysis that the agaric is almost 
entirely composed of the most valuable manures : 29 per cent, phos- 
phoric acid, 55 per cent, potash : the inevitable result of these ma- 
nures being so abundantly deposited on the surface of the ground, is 
an increased growth in the herbage and a consequent change of co- 
lour.
Our personal observations did not extend to grass preserved 
for mowing, but Mr. Way declares that the grass of which these rings 
are formed, is " always the first to vegetate in the spring, and keeps 
the lead of the ordinary grass in the pastures until the period of cut- 
ting.^'' This may be regarded as positive proof that the circle has re- 
ceived some extraordinary supply of manure, and the analysis now 
explains to us whence that supply comes.
Satisfactory as this appears, and indeed, is, our readers must bear 
in mind that it only touches that branch of the inquiry which relates 
to the influence of the fungus on certain phaenogamous plants, the 
origin, increase, and mode of growth of the fungus itself remains un- 
touched : indeed, from the report of Mr. Way's paper in the Athe- 
naeum,* it is evident that he has no conception of what we suppose to 
be the true state of the case- 
He is made to say " A fungus is developed on a single spot of ground, 
sheds its seed and dies." This, as far as we can comprehend the 
meaning, is purely hypothetical : but we are at a loss to ascertain 
Mr. Way's precise meaning; does the expression "e* developed'''' im- 
* We have to regret the extreme incorrectness and almost unintelligibility of this re- 
port: even the author's name and the analysis are, as Mr. Way points out in a subse- 
quent number, ridiculously erroneous.
671 
ply that the agaric is the entire produce of a seed of another agaric, 
as an oak tree is the entire produce of an acorn or seed of another 
oak tree ?
If so, it is quite at variance with our own observations : we 
believe that the seed of an agaric does not produce another agaric 
except as an ultimate result, and then not one but many.
We have 
no proof of the existence of isolated agarics on a single spot of ground 
any more than of isolated acorns.
We have never found an isolated 
agaric.
Again, a crop of grass springing from rotting agarics is com- 
pared to a phcenix,* a simile we cannot understand.
The old fable 
was, that the ashes of one phoenix produced another phoenix, not 
that a phcenix sprung from some foreign substance going to decay.
But we feel that we are not doing the author justice in thus criti- 
cising observations which the reporter may have been unable to com- 
prehend, and we beg to assure him that we shall be happy to publish 
his paper entire in the pages of the ' Phytologist,' so that all our bo- 
tanists may have an opjDortunity of reading and judging for them- 
selves.
There is, however, one passage which we think it desirable 
to quote, as tending to throw great weight into the scale in favour of 
our theory.
He says the agarics are ^^ situated either entirely on the 
outside of the ring or on the outer border of the grass which composes 
Ur Now we must confess that in those numerous rings which we 
have examined in Sussex, Surrey and Herefordshire, this remarkable 
fact had escaped us, but seeing it thus laid down as a simple fact, and 
not brought to bear on either theory or hypothesis, we cannot but ac- 
cept it, and our readers will in a moment see how directly it tends to 
establish our view as to the radiation of the mycelium or real fungus 
from a common centre, and its development of blossoms or agarics at 
the extremities.
Remarks on the Banana in Navigator s Islands, on Achillea serrata, 
on Alyssum calycinum, and on Juncus diffusus.

Banana.
In the 'Phytologist' for March, 1843 (Phytol.
i. 527, 
528), there is an extract from a letter addressed by Mr. N.
B. Ward 
to Prof.
Graham, respecting the introduction of the banana into the 
Navigator's Islands by the late Rev. J.
Williams.
Having, within 
the last day or two, been favoured with the company of an esteemed 
* " A vigorous crop of grass arising, like a Phoenix, from the ashes of its prede- 
cessor.'' 
672 
missionary from those islands, I mentioned the statement above al- 
luded to, and was surprised to find that there are several inaccuracies 
in it.
The latter part of the statement would induce a supposition in 
the mind of any one not acquainted with the Flora of those islands, 
that the banana was first introduced there by Mr. Williams, but my 
informant states that the banana is indigenous there, and that it was 
only another species which Mr. Williams introduced ; the fruit of 
which, as experience has proved, is not liked by the natives nearly so 
much as that of the native species.
There were about twelve diffe- 
rent kinds of banana growing freely in the islands previously to the 
introduction of the Musa Cavendishii by Mr. Williams; but whether 
these are all, or only some of them, distinct species, I am unable to 
say, as my informant (the Rev. J.
B. Stair), not being a botanist, 
can give only the native names of them.
Although, however, Mr.
Williams's benevolent intentions in taking out the Musa do not ap- 
pear to have effected the end he had in view, I may, perhaps, be al- 
lowed to state, that a very substantial benefit would be conferred 
upon those islands if, when the " John Williams " (which is now, I 
believe, on her way home) next sails from England thither, some be- 
nevolent botanist or society would supply her with a Ward's case or 
two, filled with healthy, living specimens of some of the more impor- 
tant medicinal plants, such as Cephaelis Ipecacuanha, some of the 
most useful species of Cinchona, Cocculus palmatus, any of the Sen- 
na-bearing Cassias, Punica Granatum, Ipoincea Jalapa, Rheum pal- 
matum, Smilax officinalis, &c.
The Colocynth, and some species of 
Aloe and Ricinus seem to have been introduced there already.
The 
natives suffer greatly from intermittent fevers, scrophulous diseases, 
elephantiasis, inflammatory affections, &c.
Some native teachers 
were sent to an island where the inhabitants were still in a state of 
barbarism and paganism ; and ere the " John Williams " visited them 
again, five of their number had been cut off by intermittent fever, and 
their scanty supply of medicine exhausted.
There being at present 
no professional aid on the islands, the natives are compelled to resort 
to their missionaries for such medical aid as they are able to afford, 
while, from the great distance of any place whence medicines can be 
procured (Sydney, the nearest, being 4000 miles from a considerable 
part of the islands), and from the infrequency of communication, the 
supply of medicine is very uncertain.
The prices charged at Sydney 
are very high, being 100, 150, 200 per cent., or even more, above 
English prices, so that they have not the means of procuring a suffi- 
cient sup])ly.
It would therefore be a most important benefit to the 
673 
inhabitants of that distant part of the world, and to the missionaries 
themselves, if such medicinal plants as are most likely to succeed 
under a tropical sun, and to be of most service in the diseases there 
common, could be introduced among them.
With them it would be 
advisable to send a statement of their properties, and some directions 
as to soil and culture.
They would then have remedies within their 
reach, and the missionaries might be furnished with more accessible 
means of relieving the bodily as well as the spiritual necessities of 
those for whom they labour.
I trust I shall be pardoned in making 
these remarks ; for surely one great end of botanical science is its 
practical application, and if two or three cases of medicinal plants 
may be the means of relieving the sufferings of a distant, recently ci- 
vilized, and interesting people, it will be an important and valuable 
service rendered by science to the welfare of mankind at very small 
cost.
I may state that Mr. Stair has brought home with him a collection 
of lithographic impressions of the leaves, &c., of a considerable num- 
ber of the plants indigenous to the islands, fronds of the native ferns, 
sections of stems, &c., which he intends depositing in the Missionary 
Museum, Blomfield St., Finsbury, where any botanist can inspect 
them free of charge.
There may probably be some interesting plants 
among them.
Achillea serrata.
Now to pass to a different subject more con- 
nected with British Botany.
There appears to be some confusion or 
error in the published description of Achillea serrata, to which J.
wish 
to draw attention.
Two specimens which I possess, through the 
kindness of J.
Hardy, Esq., of Sheffield, have their leaves pinnatifid^ 
with the divisions serrate, and the corymb compound.
In the ' Hor- 
tus Kewensis ' the character is as follows : â€” 
" Achillea serrata, foliis tomentosis lineari-lanceolatis pinnatijidis : 
laciniis basi profundioribus." 
Tn Babiugton's Manual these points in the character are thus no- 
ticed : "Leaves linear-lanceolate, bluntish, downy coarse- 
ly and doubly serrate, with spreading serratures, laciniated and ra- 
diating at the base corymb nearly simple." From this I think 
any one would infer that the leaves ai-e not pinnatifid.
In my sjDeci- 
mens they are truly pinnatifid for at least f to 4^ of their length, the 
pinniform lobes of the leaf being |^ to f of an inch long and about -^ 
inch in breadth.
The length of the leaves is from three to four inches 
in my specimens.
The corymb is repeatedly branched, quite as 
much as, or more so than in A.
Millefolium.
The locality of my speci- 
674 
mens is thus described : " Cromford Moor, near Matlocli, Derbyshire, 
July 24, 1843.â€” J.
Hardy." 
Alyssum calycinum.
I am also happy to be able to add another to 
the known localities for Alyssum calycinum.
It was found (for the 
first time in this county) last summer, by Miss Carr, of Foulsham, in 
a field at Twyford, near that place, in some plenty.
I possess speci- 
mens from the locality.
Junciis diffusus.
During the present summer I have visited 
Hunstanton, the locality where Mr. James Backhouse, Jun., states 
that he found a Juncus, which he supposed might turn out J.
diffu- 
sus.
I found the plants in the spot he describes (Phytol.
i. 1140), 
but could find only a few, which differed from J.
glaucus in possess- 
ing solid instead of cellular pith, and on submitting some of these to 
Mr. Babiugton, he pronounced them J.
glaucus, and stated that Mr.
Backhouse's plant proves to be the same.
It may be worthy of 
notice that the solid pith will not alone serve to distinguish the two 
plants, as some of the specimens of J.
glaucus had perfectly solid 
pith.
J. diffusus has been found in Hertfordshire by Mr. Coleman.

On the Specific difference of Glyceria plicata and G.Jluitans.
By Thomas Moore, Esq.
I PERCEIVE that at p.
484 of the ' Phytologist,' where mention is 
made of Glyceria plicata, there is some implied doubt as to its dis- 
tinctness from G.
fluitans.
It may therefore be intei-esting to state 
that continued observation of the two plants, both in a wild and culti- 
vated state, serves only to confirm my original opinion of their dis- 
tinctness.
As far as I have observed, G.
plicata may ahvays be 
distinguished from G.
fluitans in a growing state, by its broad, blunt- 
ish, glaucous leaves, which are so obviously different from those of 
the other plant, as to make it somewhat singular that they could, by 
any possibility, have been confounded with each other.
The shorter 
and differently formed outer paleae in G.
plicata, are also constant 
characters, by which all the plants I have observed might readily be 
distinguished.
The purple anthers in the one, and the yellow (or 
pale buff) anthers in the other, are also constant characters, as well 
as their difference in size and form.
It may be useful to quote Mr. Babington's characters for these two 
675 
plants, as given in the ' Annals and Magazine ol' Natnral History,' 
vol.
xvi.
p. 232 (1845).
" G.

Panicle compound ; branches compound, 
nearly smooth, divaricated whilst in flower ; spikelets linear, 
of 7 â€” 20 flowers ; outer palea oval, twice as long as broad ; 
apex obtuse-angled, with three nearly equal teeth ; anthers 
thrice as long as broad (yellow) ; sheaths compressed.

broader (or flatter) and blunter leaves, shorter paleae, and shorter 
(pale coloured) anthers.
G. fluitans, has narrower (or half-folded) and 
more pointed leaves, longer palese, and longer (purple) anthers.

Notice of some localities of Plants in Cornwall Sfc, in the Sth month, 
1846.
By George Stagey Gibson, Esq.
Several partial notices of the Botany of Cornwall have already 
appeared in the pages of the ' Phytologist,' of which the following notes 
may be considered a repetition, yet as they contain some fresh matter, 
and take np rather a wider range of country, I trust they will not be 
wholly uninteresting to its readers, though for the sake of brevity I shall 
confine my observations very much to actual facts, and not descant 
on the beauties of the country or other incidental subjects, which 
might render it more suitable for the general reader.
Cornwall is a 
most interesting county, both as relates to its scenery and its produc- 
tions, animal, vegetable, and mineral, many of which are different to 
those met with in other parts of this island.
The climate being so 
mild is doubtless one great cause of the presence of plants unknown 
in colder regions, and the great extent of sea coast affords a variety 
of marine animals and plants, equalled by few districts of the same 
extent.
My chief observations were made in the neighbourhood of 
Penzance, where therefore I shall first direct attention.
This is the 
most westerly town of England, pleasantly situated on Mount's Bay, 
and presents many attractions for the tourist as well as for the natu- 
ralist, the neighbourhood furnishing a greater variety of walks than 
almost any other of similar situation.
In the Guide Book to this place 
there is an excellent notice of the Botany of the district, and I was 
much indebted to two gentlemen resident there, for directing me to 
the localities, one of whom kindly accompanied me in several rambles.
To prevent confusion it may be well to divide the plants of this dis- 
trict into Sea, Bog, and other plants, including those in hedges, on 
walls &c.
Of the first class there is not so great a variety as in some 
other districts, on account of the small amount of salt marshes, that 
near Hayle being the only one of any extent ; on it are found Sali- 
077 
cornia herbacea, Glaux maritima, Leptuvus incuivatus, &c.
On the 
sandy shore towards Marazion, Eryngium raaritimum, Salsola Kali, 
Alsine peploides, Atriplex rosea, Beta maritima, Cakile maritima, 
Carduus tenuiflorus, Convolvulus Soldanella, Glauciura luteum spa- 
ringly.
Polygonum Rail, Pyrethrum maiitimum &c.
are met with.
On 
the sea cliffs, at the Logan-stone, St. Ives, &c., Daucus maritimus and 
Crithmum maritimum grow abundantly ; I can scarcely believe that 
the former of these plants is more than a maritime variety of Daucus 
Carota, which is a most abundant plant in Cornwall, and appears to 
assume a more fleshy character as it approaches the sea, as is the case 
with many other plants ; the points of distinction are very slight, and 
such as are likely to be caused by the effect of salt air, viz., the thick 
leaves and short comb-like prickles on the capsules.
Aster Tripo- 
lium, Plantago maritima, Silene maritima, &c., are generally found on 
the cliffs, and those at Newlyn produce Centranthus ruber.
On the 
western green we find Fceniculum vulgare, while on the eastern side 
is Erodium maritimum, which is however more plentiful on St.
Michael's Mount ; Lavatera arborea grows on the cliffs at Mousehole.
Near this little fishing village is a large cave, formed in the cliff by 
the action of the water, the lofty roof and sides of which are beauti- 
fully festooned with luxuriant ferns of very large size ; Aspleniura 
marinum is here most abundant, and it is not uncommon along the 
coast.
I saw it at the Logan, St. Michael's Mount, &c.
Senebiera 
didyma grows on the road-side near the wherry, and on the sands near 
the same spot, Trifolium subterraneum is met with sparingly.
The 
very rare Cynodon Dactylon grows plentifully in many parts of the 
green towards Marazion, particularly opposite Gulval Church ; when 
not in flower it may readily be distinguished by its glaucous foliage 
and creeping stems.
Though the few last may not exactly belong to 
the head of sea plants, yet as their localities are similar to those given 
for others of that class, it seemed to be the most natural place to re- 
fer them to.
Diotis maritima, which grew here in Ray's time, has long 
since disappeared, and Euphorbia Peplis has not been gathered for 
several years as I am informed, and must therefore be considered lost 
in this locality ; I carefully searched the sands and the green from 
Marazion to Penzance, but could find no trace of it.
In the bog- 
plants, Penzance is rich, as many of the upland moors and boggy val- 
leys present us with some very interesting species.
Chyangall is one of 
the most productive of these moors, though limited in extent ; here I 
gathered Cicendia filiformis, Littorella lacustris, Illecebrum verticilla- 
tum abundantly, Anagallis tenella, Peplis Portula, Isolepis fluitans, 
Vol II.
4 p 
678 
Hypericum elodes, Nymphaea alba, Narthecium ossifragum, Radiola 
Millegvana, Scutellaria minor, Wahlenbergia hederacea, Osmunda re- 
galis, &c.
In a marsh near Gulval are found Carex paniculata, 
Cladium Mariscus, Drosera longifolia and rotundifolia, Lycopus 
europseus, Menyanthes trifoliata, Sparganium simplex, &c.
And be- 
yond Gulval, in a hollow between the hills, is a bog, which contains 
Schoenus nigricans, Rhynchospora alba, Pinguiculalusitanica, and oc- 
casionally Bartsia viscosa, which we saw in a field adjacent; this latter 
plant I also met with by the road side, between Tol Pedn Pen with 
and the Land's End, also towards Marazion, but always in small quan- 
tities.
It is said to be frequent about St. Austle, as well as Cicendia 
filiformis &c.
Alisma ranunculoides grows near Marazion, also Isole- 
pis Savii, which I noticed at St. Ives, &c.
Osmunda regalis is very 
fine and abundant in many of the marshy hedges and thickets, and 
some of the plants above enumerated will be found on most of the 
bogs in the neighbourhood.
Briza minor is generally found near 
marshy ground, though not on it, but in fields or road sides ; I gather- 
ed it sparingly near Chyangall, and more plentifully beyond Gulval : 
the first crop had disappeared, and these were late sown plants.
In 
the ponds at Treng Wainton, Chara translucens is abundant ; Typha 
latifolia, &c., are also found here.
The plants not included in the 
two foregoing heads, may now be briefly mentioned.
Anthemis nobilis is 
most abundant on nearly all the open downs, scenting the air as you 
ride or walk over it : Antirrhinum Orontium is occasionally met with ; 
Aquilegia vulgaris near Hayle, Calamintha officinalis, Chenopodium 
raurale, Fumaria capreolata, Helminlhia echioides, Hieracium umbel- 
latum, Lepidium Smithii, Linaria Elatine, Linum an gusti folium, 
Rumex pulcber and sanguineus, Q^nanthe crocata, Ornithopus per- 
pusillus, &c., are common in the neighbourhood.
Clematis Vitalba 
grows near Alverton Bridge ; Erodium moschatura is abundant on 
several dry banks near the town, especially in the path leading to the 
baths; Mentha rotundifolia grows on the western green, and is not un- 
common in moist situations.
Rubia peregrina is rather rare; Stachys 
ambigua is plentiful in Love Lane and some other places.
The rare 
Scrophularia Scorodonia I noticed in several places by the road side, as 
beyond Newlyn, at Chyandower on the road to St. Ives, by the cross 
on the Land's End road about two miles from Penzance, and also 
near St. Ives in ascending the hill on the old road.
The cross above 
mentioned is a locality given in Watson's Botanist's Guide for Lotus 
angustissimus ; that plant and L.
hispidus were then confounded to- 
gether, and it is the latter which was here intended, as it still grows 
679 
sparingly in that spot, on the opposite side of the road.
L. angustissi- 
mus T was not fortunate enough to discover, though several localities 
are given for it in West Penwith.
Sibthorpia europaea is not rai'C on 
wet shady banks, as on the road to Rose Hill, and in a lane beyond 
Gulval rocks.
Geranium striatum is apparently wild on the road to 
Castle Horneck, growing abundantly among the grass, with its beau- 
tifully pencilled flowers sprinkled amongst it ; it must certainly be 
established as a naturalized plant, as I heard of its being found in 
more wild situations near St. Austle, &c., and at least deserves a place 
in the British Flora as much as many recently added species.
On 
the dry grounds near the Logan-rock I gathered Moenchia erecta and 
Spergula subulata.
Cotyledon Umbilicus is very common on walls 
and rocks ; Iris foetidissima is rare, but 1 saw it between Hayle and 
St, Ives ; Cuscuta Epithymnm grows on furze near Tol Pedn Pen- 
with and other places.
The ferns flourish most luxuriantly, and are 
very beautiful in this neighbourhood, though there may not be so 
great a variety as is sometimes met with ; there are however several 
rare species : Asplenium lanceolatum is not uncommon on walls, as 
near Chyandower at the Land's End, and on rocks at St. Michael's 
Mount, where it is also accompanied by Lastra3a recurva ; the latter 
also grows in some other places : Osmunda regalis is common, as has 
been already stated.
The very elegant Adiantum Capillus-Veneris is 
found in a cave about two miles along the coast between St. Ives and 
Hayle, the finest specimens are out of reach, and appeared very luxuri- 
ant, the fronds and stalks of some of those I gathered being more 
than a foot in length.
In the lower parts, where it has been more 
frequently gathered, the plants dwindle, but it is abundant though 
very limited in extent.
I believe it is also found in one or two simi- 
lar spots nearer Hayle.
It was an interesting sight, though rather too 
early in the season, as the time for flowering was scarcely arrived.
Having now completed a hasty notice of the plants which I gathered 
near Penzance, it may not be out of place to refer to a few which 
I did not see, but which are stated in several works to be found there.
Erica ciliaris is said, in the Penzance Guide, to have been found at 
Lamorna, Cynosurus echinatus at Ludgvan, Polycarpon tetraphyllum 
at Newlyn, Scilla verna is frequent on the cliffs.
Lythrum hyssopifo- 
lium is also said to grow at Ludgvan, and Teucrium Chamsedrys ; 
Agrostis setacea at Newlyn ; Reseda fruticulosa near Marazion ; 
Oxalis stricta in orchards, as well as some other introduced plants.
I searched very carefully for Iris tuberosa without success, probably 
on account of the late season of the year ; the locality given for this 
680 
plant in Watson's Guide is TruclifFe Lane, on the the top of a hedge 
turning up from Love Lane, about 50 yards from the turn.
After con- 
siderable inquiry, being unable to hear of such a name as Trucliffe, 
I concluded it was a misprint, and that the name should be Trereife, 
(pronounced Treeve) Lane, where Love Lane terminates.
Here then 
I sought several times on both sides of the hedge, but was surprised 
to find that an orchard extends for some distance along the road, in 
the midst of which, according to the description, this plant would grow: 
and therefore I could not but wonder that the plant had been intro- 
duced into our Flora, from such a more than suspicious locality, and 
where perhaps it ought scarcely to be considered naturalized ; it is 
said to be common in several of the orchards in that vicinity.
It is a curious fact that several plants common in most other dis- 
tricts are unknown, or very rare, in this, as for instance the delightful 
Viola odorata, which is never found wild.
Before leaving Penzance 
I may just say that it is even richer in cryptogamic than in phaenoga- 
raic plants, and would amply repay further research than it has yet 
received.
The next place to be noticed I shall pass over with a very few re- 
marks, as it has been so recently referred to in the interesting descrip- 
tion given by W.
S. Hore in his paper on the Lizard.
The season 
was very favourable for Erica vagans, whose delicate white and pink 
flowers, waving on the crimson wiry stalks, present a most elegant 
and beautiful appearance.
It is curious to observe how very much 
it is in that part confined to the Lizard, and the serpentine formation, 
as it appears scarcely at all till you get within about six or eight 
miles of the Point, when it becomes most abundant, even more so than 
the common species, all of which are also found there.
It does how- 
ever grow on Connor Downs, a few miles from Hayle.
Herniaria 
glabra is plentiful near the Lizard lighthouse, and at Kynance Cove, 
also Scilla autumnalis, Spiranthes autumnalis, and a Bromus, said to be 
the pseudo-velutinus of the London Botanical Society's Catalogue.
Kynance Cove is a delightful spot, the scenery, the formation of 
the rocks, and the variety of plants are most interesting.
It was too 
late for many of its rarities, but Anthyllis vulneraria, /3.
Dillenii, with its 
rich crimson flowers, still formed a conspicuous object ; Genista tinc- 
toria, B.
prostrata, Erythraea ramosissima.
Geranium sanguineum, 
(query, was sylvaticum a slip of the pen in W.
S. Here's account of 
that spot?), Hypochseris maculata in leaf only, Juncus maritimus, 
Orobanche rubra the dried stems, Spiraea Filipendula &c.
were seen.
The scramble to the bellows on Asparagus Island is amply repaid 
681 
by the sight of that curious phenomenon, and the Asparagus which 
grows among the grass on the top, is a further reward to the botanist.
It is not abundant there, and the guides gather it so frequently, to pre- 
sent to their visitors, whether scientific or otherwise, that there is some 
danger of its becoming eradicated in a few years.
AlHum Schoenoprasum grows about half a mile north of the Cove 
among the rocks ; the time of flowering was of course past, but I ob- 
tained a few plants of it.
Alsine verna grows plentifully, but its ap- 
pearance is such that 1 did not at first recognise an old Teesdale ac- 
quaintance ; indeed it looks at a distance more like Spergula nodosa ; 
it is rather surprising that it was not made even a variety by Smith or 
Hooker, and although Babington raises it to the rank under the name 
of &.
Gerardi, I cannot but think it may eventually be considered a 
distinct species, though it may be difficult, as he remarks, to describe 
the points of distinction.
It is so dissimilar to the usual form of A.
vema, both in its fresh and dried state, that to an unpractised eye, 
they would certainly be thought different plants.
Unfortunately I 
did not examine it minutely while growing, and the flowers cannot be 
well seen when dried ; its peculiar dwarf habit and thick-set leaves 
pressed close to the stem, are striking characteristics.
I hope it will 
claim further attention from botanists visiting that part.
Along the 
banks of that curious sheet of water called Looe Pool, I found the three 
plants mentioned by W.
S. Hore, viz., Corrigiola littoralis, Cheno- 
podium botryodes, and Elatine hexandra, most plentifully on the 
south side.
I also noticed Euphorbia portlandica, Trifolium scabrum, 
and Spergula subulata, near the shore, also one or two plants of Erica 
vagans in the woods above the Pool.
Returning eastward I have nothing particular to record till we 
reach Bodmin, where I visited the locality for Physospermum cornu- 
biense, which is known there as a rare plant under its old name Ligus- 
ticum.
I was gratified by seeing it abundantly in the outskirts of 
Steppe's Wood, about one and a half mile from Bodmin, turning off 
to the right at the first milestone on the Launceston road ; it flowered 
chiefly among the furze &c., just outside the wood.
I was informed 
that it also grew in several of the neighbouring woods, Margets, &c.
At Budi, on the north-west coast.
Euphorbia Paralias and Ammo- 
phila arundinacea abound â€” here I also gathered Statice spathulata 
on the cliffs, and several other marine plants, as well as Papaver hy- 
bridum.
The romantic little Clovelly, built as it is on the side of a 
precipitous hill, and surrounded by rocks and hills wooded to their 
base, might not be unlikely to produce some rarities, but all I noticed 
682 
there was Saxifraga urabrosa growing in several wet spots among the 
trees in great profusion ; whether or not it might have been originally 
planted I cannot tell, but there were no other cultivated plants around, 
neither did it bear any marks of having been placed there by the hand 
of man.
At Biddeford I succeeded in finding the wall which produces 
Senecio squalidus; it is near the Inn above the Church ; the plant 
is not very abundant, but I saw it also in a garden, where the woman 
told me it was a weed, and had grown many years.
This is the best 
place from which to visit Braunton Burrows, but I had no opportu- 
nity for doing so.
They are a conspicuous object on the road to 
Barnstaple, along which I saw Artemisia maritiraa and several other 
sea plants.
While at llfracombe I went to see the locality there 
for Adiantum Capillus- Veneris, which is difiicult of access except at 
low water, and at all times care is required not to be overtaken by the 
tide ; it is to the west of the town, beyond the first ridge of rocks after 
the descent to the beach by the Torre walk ; it grows there in rather 
a small quantity, and the lower plants are much stunted from being 
so frequently gathered, as I believe is the case, indeed none of it was 
equal in size to that near St. Ites.
Erodium maritimum, Chlora per- 
foliata, &c., are common there.
At Linton the Hieracia become 
more abundant, some of the ferns also are fine there ; Euphorbia 
hiberna grows in the wood near the "Waters meet" ; Erodium mariti- 
mum and Sedum anglicum too are frequent.
Meconopsis cambrica near 
the West Lyn. At Exeter I gathered Bromus madritensis, on a wall 
in a street opposite the Clarence Hotel, which probably is the one 
referred lo in the Botanist's Guides.
And now I will conclude this detail of localities, many of which 
may be considered only as verifications of what was before known ; 
but even this may not be useless, in a day when cultivation and the 
ravages of collectors so often injure or destroy old-established locali- 
ties.
Sufficient, I doubt not, has been said to prove Cornwall a very 
interesting county in a botanical point of view, and one that would 
richly repay a careful investigation, especially in the Lizard and west- 
ern districts.

Botanical Society of London.

in the Chair.
The Secretary announced that British Plants had been 
received from Dr. Dickie, Mr. R.
J. Mann, Mr. Samuel Hailstone, 
Mr. G.
H. K.
Thwaites, Mr. H.
O. Stephens, Mr. J.

The Royal Botanic Society presented two dried examples 
of the Orobanche sent to that Society as probably the Orobauche luco- 
rum {Brautt), but which cannot be certainly identified with the de- 
scription of that species in the Synopsis of Koch.
Indeed it appeared 
to some of the members, that the two specimens were those of diffe- 
rent species ; one being very similar to Orobanche major, and the 
other equally similar to Orobanche elatior.
It seems highly probable, 
therefore, that some confusion of species has occurred, which may 
have increased the difficulty of determining the plants satisfactorily, 
and may have been instrumental in giving rise to the different views 
expressed by those botanists who had previously examined the plants 
in their living state.

Occurrence of Erica ciliaris in the County Galway, West of 
Ireland.
By the Editok.
We learn that Mr. Bergin has had the good fortune to add this beau- 
tiful species to the already extensive list of Irish heaths.
Its locality 
is in the county Galway, and not far from Clifton, indeed, almost ex- 
actly the same as that previously recorded for Erica Mackaiana ; a 
circumstance which seems to throw an additional doubt over the dis- 
tinctness of that species, by suggesting the possibility of its being 
a hybrid between E.
ciliaris and E.
Tetralix.
As to the accuracy of name in Mr. Bergin's heath we have no doubt, 
since our esteemed correspondent, Mr. Moore, a botanist not likely to 
be deceived, has received specimens, and unhesitatingly pronounces 
them to be Erica ciliaris.
We have long been expecting a communication on this subject, but 
do not like longer to delay announcing so important a discovery.
A neiv locality in Scotland for Ruscus aculeatus.
By the Rev.
George Lawson.
Allow me to record a new Scottish station for the curious Ruscus 
684 
aculeatus, which I found some days ago in a somewhat shady place 
near Picallo Castle, in Fifeshire.
The vicinage of this station^to the 
old castle renders it probable that the plant may have been intro- 
duced : but as I am credibly informed the castle has not been 
inhabited for the last hundred years ; and as the plant bears signs of 
vigour and health, and grows in tolerable abundance ; I presume it 
may be set down as fairly naturalized.
However, it may be indige- 
nous, although / can see no reason for thinking so.

Our attention has been called to these little works by seeing them

ming over their contents.
The Paris ' Flora ' is a very useful work, 
and, as by far the greater number of species are also British, it is 
peculiarly interesting to those who make the productions of our own 
country their particular study ; the descriptions are for the most part 
clear and concise, two great recommendations.
The method followed 
is that of Jussieu, the arrangement of the natural orders that of De 
Candolle, nearly all the recently established genera and orders being 
added.
Mr. Choulette's work is merely introductory, being an analytical table 
of the genera and species arranged under the Linnean classes : there 
is something clever, if not perfectly satisfactory, in the dichotomous 
mode of characterising the species: of this we subjoin an example.

Remarks on the Hieracium macu latum of Smith.* By James 
Bladon, Esq.
Having bestowed considerable attention on several species of Hiera- 
cium the last three seasons, but more especially maculatum, I now 
beg leave to lay before the Society, the result of my observations.
I have used the name "maculatum" from the circumstance that 
the first plants I observed corresponded exactly with Smith's descrip- 
tion of his plant in * English Flora,' vol.
iii.
p. 360, and since then, the 
varieties I have observed have been more easily referrible to this 
description of maculatum than to any of the others that are now 
considered cognate varieties.
The leaf The leaves are subject to very great variations, from 
broadly ovate to nearly linear, the margins vary from entire or with 
one or two teeth about one sixteenth of an inch in length, to twelve or 
fourteen teeth, some of them half an inch in length and one quarter 
in breadth : one character I have observed to be constant through all 
the variations in form, at the base of the leaf (both radical and stem 
leaves), the membrane tapers to the midrib gradually, and is con- 
tinued a short distance on the petiole, never ending abruptly as in a 
common ovate leaf The purple blotches on the leaves from which Sir 
J. Smith took the name, I believe to depend chiefly on the season ; 
in a hot dry summer I have found hardly any plant whose leaves 
were not stained, the latter part of the present summer being rather 
moist, it is equally rare to find one with stains : in the early part of 
this season the marked plants were in much greater proportion than 
they are now.
The foregoing observations respecting the mark- 
ings of the plants refer to those on the same walls, and are therefore 
most probably from the identical roots that plants sprung from in pre- 
vious seasons.
The radical leaves of maculatum I have observed to 
decay much sooner than any other species of Hieracium, being often- 
times withered completely by the time the second flowers are blooming.
The flowers.
In the ' English Flora ' great stress is laid upon the 
number of flowers in discriminating the various species : the number 
of them is the most variable character of the plant : I have had plants 
with only two or three flowers, and others on which I have counted 
near fifty flowers and buds of all sizes at the same time.
Besides the 
diflerence in the number in separate plants, the same plant exhibits 
different numbers according to the time at which it was examined 
(as remarked in a note forwarded to the ' Phytologist').
The only con-

staiit character belonging to the flowers is the one used by Sir J.
Smith for H.
pulmonariura, (Eng. Flora iii.
p. 36) ; " The first partial 
stalk remaining always much lower than the rest, " in fact the first 
flower is always overtopped by the next unopened buds, in the 
axillary branches as well as on the main stem.
I hardly know any 
composite flower that is so much affected by a shower as H.
maculatum, 
especially when growing on walls : the flower becomes rumpled and 
disfigui'ed extremely, so as hardly to be in a fit state to be gathered 
for preservation : (I have several times lately been obliged to acknow- 
ledge the correctness of the foregoing remark).
If trees are near 
them so that the droppings of the leaves fall on them, they are simi- 
larly affected.
The habitat.
The situation that H.
maculatum seems most to 
flourish in, is on old exposed walls, next stony banks on road sides, or 
the elevated edges of foot paths : it is rarely to be found in open fields 
or woods, very rarely in hedge-banks.
One of the places where it 
grows in greatest luxuriance is on some yard-walls, from five to 
twelve feet in height, in one of the streets of the town.
The growth.
The time when it is in highest perfection is about 
the latter end of July ; it may then be found chiefly from two to three 
feet in height ; as those stems decay after flowering, a second growth 
springs up from the same roots, or from the axil of the lowest leaf of 
an injured stem, and are now, September 2nd, in flower, from nine to 
fifteen inches high, with from three to a dozen flowers and buds.
It is very probable that some of the discrepancies of the descriptions 
may have arisen from their authors having seen only the latter plants 
of the second growth.

On the Flowering of Raiiunculus hulhosus.
By Mr. Thomas Meeham.
The time of flowering of many British plants depends so much 
on the nature of the season, as to make the times given in British 
Floras often appear erroneous.
Not only does the season exert its in- 
fluence over the time of flowering of certain plants, but the nature of the 
soil also seems to modify it.
The Ranunculus bulbosus, when grow- 
ing in meadows, is usually in bloom about May, or if the season be 
later, iu the earlier part of June.
I believe that in cultivated ground 
it would often be found in bloom later in the autumn, when not a 
plant would be found in the meadows in bloom.
If this prove cor- 
687 
rect in all cases, it may tend to throw additional light on the causes 
of plants being found in bloom at unusual periods.
In the last week in September, I was searching in this neighbour- 
hood for Ranunculus hirsutus, which T had not hitherto found.
On approaching a cultivated field at the back of Mortlake church, 
1 observed that it was studded with the flowers of some species of 
Ranunculus, and I began to congratulate myself on the discovery of the 
plant I was searching for, but alas !
it was too premature ; it proved 
to be no other than R.
bulbosus.
It was a useful observation, how- 
ever, to me, and I think it may prove so to the readers of the ' Phy- 
tologist,' whom it may induce to note similar observations, should 
they present themselves.
In a botanical excursion to Dorking on the 10th of October, I ob- 
served the common honeysuckle, {Lonicera Periclymenum, L.) in 
full bloom in many places.

On Fairy Rings.
By J.
Ford Davis, Esq.
In writing to you about "Fairy Rings," it is not my intention to 
enter fully upon the scientific view of the subject with WoUaston and 
Way, or the more imaginative ones of your facetious correspondent 
O. P.
and the credulous and superstitious Aubrey.
I propose to state 
merely what has fallen under my own observation, during the course 
of many years, in the lawn before my residence in this city.
The 
rings there are numerous, and so are the fungi, but I have never ob- 
served more than one species, viz.
Agaricus Orcades.
White mentions 
puff-balls, Wollaston A.
Orcades, campestris, terreus, procerus, and 
Lycoperdon bovista.
Way mentions only one, A.
graveolens, grow- 
ing in those around the college at Cirencester.
But what has struck 
me as very remarkable, if not quite new (for I do not know that it has 
been noticed by any writer), is that the colour of the grass in the 
rings is not alone changed, but that the grasses themselves are 
changed; for the finer lawn grasses, with Trifoliura repens, disappear 
in those upon our Crescent lawn, and Cock's-foot {Dactylis glomerata) 
takes their place.
Mr. Way has afforded us a probable explanation of increased fer- 
tility, but will that be sufficient to account for the substitution of a 
solitary, coarse, and darker coloured grass for several others of a finer 
and better quality ?
It may indeed be questioned whether the term 
688 
" increased fertility " be applicable to the case.
Have we not then a 
right to conclude that Fairy Rings still remain, as Knapp said, an 
opprobium physiologicum ?

[Our correspondent, who considers the theory of radiation imagina-

Notice of ' a Catalogue of the Phcenogamous Plants and Ferns of 
Great Britain, arranged according to the natural orders ; with 
a copious list of synonyms carefully compiled from SteudeVs 
Nomenclator Botanicus, Smithes English Flora, Hooker''s Bri- 
tish Flora, Lindleys Synopsis, Babington's Manual, and other 
sources.
By Henry Ibbotson.' Parts I and II.
1846.
(7b be 
completed in six Parts).
Each successive author of an English Flora, whether with or with- 
out good reasons thereunto moving, invariably discards sundry old 
established names of plants, and substitutes other names in their 
stead.
The reasons for such name-changing are various; sometimes 
good and sufficient ; sometimes, it is to be regretted, neither good nor 
sufficient.
A change of name becomes proper and necessary, where any pre- 
ceding author has incorrectly applied the name of some different 
species to the plant which really inhabits Britain ; as, for example, in 
the case of Crepis virens being substituted for Crepis tectorum in re- 
cent works, and in the case of Lepidium Smithii being used instead of 
Lepidium hirtum.
Equally proper and necessary is the introduction 
of a new name, in those instances where two of our native species 
have been confused together, and described under a single name; as 
in the case of OEnanthe Phellandrium and QEnanthe fluviatilis, or in 
689 
that of Ranunculus hederaceus and Ranunculus Lenorraandi â€” as- 
suming these to be couplets, respectively, of two good species.
But it is not proper, and is very unnecessary, to follow the example 
of those species- makers who so eagerly pounce upon any variety, 
howsoever trifling, which falls under their ken, and " raise it to the rank 
of a species." Their course is thus : â€” All intermediate and connect- 
ing links are studiously left out of view, a specific character is con- 
cocted from the peculiarites observable in the extreme forms, a new 
name is invented, and the species is " made " â€” in words.
So utterly 
indifferent to reality and truthfulness, are some of our great species- 
makers, that they will act similarly, although in possession of only 
solitary or imperfect specimens of the " new species.
" And some of 
them will even coolly inform us (after the untenableness of their pre- 
tended species has been rendered too apparent for the longer conti- 
nuance of them in books) that they were described for species simply 
in order " to draw attention to them." As if the only or proper way 
of drawing attention to varieties, were that of designedly misleading 
other botanists, in the question of their specific distinctness or indis- 
tinctness, and of thus loading our books with unnecessary and trouble- 
some synonyms.
In numerous instances, changes are made in the old-established 
generic names of plants, the specific names being retained ; although, 
in nine cases out of ten, such generic changes are uncalled for, and 
really serve no purpose more useful than that of gratifying the per- 
sonal vanity of the botanist who makes them.
By thus coining a 
fi-esh generic name for the plant, the botanist is enabled to substitute 
also an abbreviation of his own surname, as the authority for the spe- 
cies, instead of that of the person who originally described the species.
Thus by substituting the new generic name of " Serrafalcus," in place 
of " Bromus," a notoriety-seeking botanist was enabled to erect him- 
self into the authority for some species of the latter newly made genus ; 
and through this charge, the familiar " Bromus mollis, Linn.'''' becomes 
a " Serrafalcus mollis, Pari.'''' Even the simple adoption of these 
new generic names will frequently answer the same end ; because 
they can still be applied to other species of the original genus, by him 
who only adopts the new generic name.
By so doing, he also is en- 
abled to substitute an abbreviation of his own surname as the authority 
for these other species, and to discard that of an earlier describer of 
the same plants.
It is not wished to give offence to one of our best 
English botanists, in suggesting that the opportunity for substituting 
" Serrafalcus secalinus, Bab.'''' instead of " Bromus secalinus, Linn^ 
690 
may have unconsciously influenced the author of the * Manual,' when 
adopting into that useful work the newly coined generic name from 
the conceited Parlatore.
The subdivision of one large genus into two or more genera, how- 
ever, may be excusable and allowable, when founded upon clear and 
decided characters.
Yet can it seldom be necessary, or even desira- 
ble, thus to multiply synonyms; since a subgeneric section would 
usually answer the scientific purposes fully as well, â€” though not 
ministering so satisfactorily to the personal vanity of the name- 
changer.
Thus, the separation of Luzula from Juncus, of Armeria 
from Statice, being favoured by considerable diversity of general habit, 
as well as by fair enough technical characters, it was soon acquiesced 
in by botanists; as also that of Linaria from Antirrhinum, of Pelargo- 
nium from Geranium, made on conspicuous floral differences, although 
not accompanied with equally decided distinctions of habit.
On the 
contrary, the separation of Eleocharis from Scirpus is bad ; because 
the technical distinction, derived from a trifling peculiarity in the 
style, makes a most unnatural subdivision of the genus; half the 
species which correspond with Eleocharis in general habit, being still 
left in the genus Scirpus.
Some botanists will change also the specific name, together with 
the generic name of a plant, and thus interpose an additional obstacle 
in the way of identifying the synonyms as those of one single species.
This course is necessary, indeed, when a species is removed from one 
genus into another, and becomes associated under the same generic 
name with another species already bearing the same specific name ; 
otherwise we should have two species with the same names, both 
generic and specific.
And when two or more genera are united, the 
one discarded generic name is occasionally taken up for a specific 
name ; as in the instance of Potentilla Tormentilla.
We have premised these remarks on name-changing, as excep- 
tional cases where the recognized rule of priority will not enable 
botanists to select the right name of a species.
By itself, that rule 
is simply a matter of date or time, and its application is usually easy 
and certain.
The true difliculties of nomenclature arise from the 
vexed questions touching the limits between species and varieties, 
and from diversities of opinion respecting the characters which are to 
be deemed sufficient or insuflicient for the establishment of genera.
These are not matters of date.
They are points to be decided by the 
acquired knowledge and sound judgment of botanists ; and as indi- 
viduals differ most widely from each other in such mental qualities, 
691 
their decisions will also differ.
In general, those botanists who are 
endowed with brains of small size, and in whom the observing organs 
predominate over the reasoning organs, will be found great dividers 
of species and genera ; because they inherit from nature a tendency to 
small ideas and to minutely close observation.
On the other hand, those 
botanists who carry brains of large size, and in whom the reasoning 
predominate over the observing organs, often incline to the opposite 
extreme, and would too far combine genera and alleged species; such 
persons having a natural disinclination to minute observation and petty 
distinctions.
Each party, from their mental constitution, believe 
themselves right.
Ultimately, the decision is made by authority or 
majority.
Be the grounds for name-changing what they may, sound or unsound, 
error or the correction of error, truth-seeking or personal vanity, â€” 
the load of synonyms has gradually accumulated into " a great fact " 
in our botanical literature ; and is one so troublesome to all botanists, 
so perplexing to the student, that tables of synonyms become indis- 
pensible to the working botanist, whether learner or learned, who 
requires to use the publications of several different authors.
Of the 
necessity of such compilations of names, under existing circumstances, 
there can be no doubt.
Their usefulness to botanists will depend 
upon their accuracy and completeness, and upon the facility with 
which they can be referred to.
With respect to facility of reference, although there may be some 
convenience in a systematic arrangement of the species, the alphabeti- 
cal series of names and synonyms appears by far the most useful form.
Tables of synonyms are essentially Dictionaries, by means of which 
we may be enabled to find other words or names corresponding with 
any given one.
And universal experience shows that the alphabetical 
series of words is the best and most convenient in all kinds of dictio- 
naries.
Accordingly, Steudel has made his great work, the * Nomen- 
clator Botanicus,' an alphabetical one.
Secondly, with respect to completeness and accuracy, the impor- 
tance of these merits is too obvious to require argument or illustra- 
tion.
Under the most favourable circumstances, a general Nomenclator 
may be expected to contain many errors and omissions.
The most 
careful compiler may himself commit them, through imperfect ac- 
quaintance with the species or with the works from which he quotes ; 
while the most complete knowledge of plants and books, ever acquired 
by an individual botanist, must stQl leave him unprepared to detect 
and correct all the misnomers of other writers.
In short, a general 
692 
Nomenclator ought to be the work of a first-rate botanist ; and all the 
knowledge which such a botanist could bring to the task, would still 
fail to render his undertaking perfectly complete and free from error.
A local Nomenclator, or one restricted to the plants of a single 
country, differs only in extent from the general one.
There should 
still be equal facility in use and reference ; and we might fairly expect 
a greater degree of completeness and freedom from error, within its 
much narrower scope.
We cannot, indeed, say that only a first-rate 
general botanist should undertake this much more limited work.
But 
we may still say that its author ought to posses a first-rate knowledge 
of the plants of the single country, and that he should be familiarly 
acquainted with the works in which they are described, or in which 
their habitats are recorded.
Without such full knowledge and famili- 
arity, he would be unable correctly to identify the synonyms, and to 
rectify the misnomers of other authors.
The compiler of a local No- 
menclator ought to be qualified to supply the omissions and to cor- 
rect the errors of a general Nomenclator, such as that of Steudel, so far 
as the species and the authors of his own single country are con- 
cerned.
Allowing this view to be sound, it would have required a Wilson 
or a Leighton, a Borrer ora Babington, to have executed such a com- 
pilation of synonyms properly, and to have made it critically accu- 
rate and complete.
Our surprise, therefore, was great to find the task 
undertaken by Mr. Ibbotson.
We believe this gentleman to be a 
botanist of good abilities, possessing a considerable knowledge of 
English plants, and to be very useful in his own familiar sphere of 
action.
Still, we cannot regard him as rising to the same level with 
those whom we should deem fairly qualified for the special task which 
he has thus undertaken ; namely, compiling a local Nomenclator, or 
Catalogue of British plants and their synonyms.
With so many Floras 
and Catalogues already before the public, it is doubtless a very easy 
task to copy out or compile a list of British plants.
But to make a 
critical compilation of synonyms, even were it restricted to those of 
British authors only, would be no facile task; and the labour is vastly 
augmented by including the synonyms of foreign botanists also.
Mr. Ibbotson's work is simply a list of British plants, arranged ac- 
cording to the natural method, with numerous synonyms printed in a 
smaller type, underneath the names of the species to which they be- 
long, or are supposed to do so by Mr. Ibbotson.
No distinction is 
made between native and naturalised species ; nor even between those 
which have been erroneously reported as British and those which are 
693 
really so.
The names of all are printed uniformly, and they are num- 
bered consecutively ; as if all the names belonged to species which are 
equally and certainly British.
In these respects, the Catalogue is a 
retrogression towards the inferior models, which were in use some 
years ago, and which have been improved upon in the more recent 
Floras and Catalogues.
Mr. Ibbotson's work is, in truth, a very in- 
correct list of British plants ; or rather, it is a list of species which 
have been reported as British, rightly or falsely, without distinction.
We could have wished to find these defects of the Catalogue, while 
regarded as a list of species, compensated by some peculiar excel- 
lence or usefulness in the compilation of the synonyms.
For the 
most part, however, they are copied wholesale from SteudeFs Nomen- 
clator, without critical selection, apparently without verification, and 
with very few of those additions and corrections from the works of 
English authors, which might so reasonably have been expected in a 
list of names exclusively restricted to the plants of this country.
In 
short, the lists of synonyms are rather plagiarisms from the Nomen- 
clator of Steudel, than fair compilations; or, should that term appear 
too harsh, let us say reprints from the Nomenclator.
In the additions 
made by Mr. Ibbotson himself, we fail to detect any regular plan or 
rule of selection, which can account for the few additions and many 
omissions.
But two or three examples will best illustrate and esta- 
blish the grounds of our censures and objections to this work.
As the Catalogue issues from a provincial press, it may have been 
slowly printed; and we will therefore not hold the author blameable 
for the omission of Ranunculus Lenormandi, Cerastium strictum, or 
other names which should have come in the earlier pages of the work.
But when we turn to the latter portion of part II.
(only two parts 
having yet reached us, and both being dated in 1846), and still find 
errors and omissions which might have been avoided by ordinary care 
in consulting standard or familiar works, we must think the Cata- 
logue to be deserving of serious censure.
In example of omissions which should certainly not have occurred 
in any "carefully compiled" list of synonyms of British plants, for the 
use of British botanists, we will refer to " Crepis virens, Lin^ of the 
Catalogue.
The native species, to which this name is applied, was 
published under that of Hedypnoides tectorum in the ' Flora Anglica,' 
and under that of Crepis tectorum in the 'Flora Britannica,' 'English 
Botany,' 'English Flora,' &c.
Nevertheless we do not find the Hedyp- 
nois tectorum or Crepis tectorum, of any British author, given among 
the synonyms of C virens.
A dozen other synonyms are given ; but 
Vol. II.
4 s 
694 
these are merely transcribed from Steudel's Nomenclator, without 
change or addition.
For anything that appears in Mr. Ibbotson's 
Catalogue, all English authors may have used the name of Crepis 
virens only and constantly.
A similar omission occurs under " Barkhausia taraxacifolia, Z>ec." 
Repeatedly as this plant has been published under the name of 
Crepis biennis, by English botanists, we do not find any English author 
quoted for this synonym.
As for as far as the Catalogue goes, no 
such misnomer may have ever occurred in this country.
Some of the author's own errors, â€” not of omission, but of commis- 
sion â€” seem quite unaccountable.
Thus, for example, the " Hypochoe- 
ris maculata, Sm. E.
^." is placed as a synonym of the stained- 
leaf variety of Hieracium murorum, to which Mr. Samuel Gibson 
gave the name of Hieracium hypochoeroides (Phytol.
i. 741, 802, &c)., 
And this odd mistake becomes still more odd, when we see the name 
of the same species, "Hypochceris maculata, im.," also quoted as a 
synonym of " Achyrophorus maculatus, Scop.,'" and rightly so quoted.
The Hieracium pulmonarium, of Smith, is still entered as two 
species ; first, under name of " nigrescens," and, secondly, under that 
of " pulmonarium ;" under this latter name, being made the typical 
form of Hieracium diaphanum of Fries.
This is doubtless copied 
from Babington's Manual ; and had not the fact of specific identity, 
between the two alleged species, been subsequently made public in 
the pages of the ' Phytologist' (Phytol.
ii.
442 and 496), we should have 
held Mr. Ibbotson quite excused for merely continuing a mistake, 
which had formerly arisen from an imperfect knowledge of the plant 
intended under those names.
At first, we had thought that the excuse 
of date might sufficiently account for the repetition of this inaccu- 
racy; but on the same sheet of the Catalogue we find the name of 
Vaccinium macrocarpum, a species which was first published, as 
British, on the very same leaf of the ' Phy tologist,' on which the identity 
of Hieracium pulmonarium and nigrescens was distinctly announced.
This circumstance proves that the correction was within reach of Mr.
Ibbotson, before he reprinted the error.
Still, this Catalogue may have its use.
First, having the advantage 
of a date two years later, than that of the ' London Catalogue,' it in- 
cludes some few species and corrections which have been published 
within those two years.
But against this small superiority we have 
to balance its price, which is (or, when complete,will be) twelve times 
that of the ' London Catalogue.' Secondly and chiefly, it includes a 
reprint of Steudel's collection of synonyms, with some additions from 
695 
the works of English botanists.
But for the use of those who study 
only British plants, a careful compilation of the synonyms of British 
authors, and even of these alone, would have proved more serviceable 
than this wholesale transcript from Steudel, of the synonyms of foreign 
authors instead.

J. Berkeley.
Readily will it be inferred from the titles of these articles, that they 
can have no particular interest in the eyes of those who devote their 
attention, principally or exclusively, to the Botany of our own islands.
And, indeed, the miscellaneous, and often very inexact notes on plants, 
made during the time of journeying in foreign lands, can afford interest 
to very few general botanists ; while isolated descriptions of new 
genera and species, and " reviews of families," important though 
they may be with relation to the progress of science, can still interest 
but a small section of the botanical world.
We are mostly content, 
therefore, to indicate by their titles, to the readers of the Thy tologist,' 
that such papers have been published, and can be seen by those who 
require to see them.
But some few extracts, culled from the tours 
and travels, may instruct or amuse our readers.
The Editor's anonymous friend, dating from Stockholm, thus al- 
ludes to the Linnean relics, preserved in London : â€” " We went with 
Professor Fries to see the house in which Linna3us lived, and the gar- 
den where he cultivated his ' Hort.
Upsal.' plants, now no longer 
belonging to the family; but in which the buildings used by this great 
father of modern Botany, as green houses and lecture-room, still ex- 
ist ; and a poplar-tree, known to be planted by his own hands, is 
shown with great reverence.
Proud though we be in England of pos- 
sessing his collections, it is impossible to be at Upsala, where so much 
is associated with his name, to see the respect paid to his memory, 
and the value attached to the few manuscripts or other remembrances 
of him which they have been able to amass, without feeling that this 
is the place where his library and herbarium ought to be, and that if 
they had been here, the botanical world would long since have known 
what information can or cannot be derived from the specimens pre- 
served, and as a tribute to his extraordinary genius, such of his manu- 
scripts as are really interesting or curious, (and they are not a few), 
would have been given to the public, instead of lying unknown in the 
attics of our Linnean Society." (No. 58, p.
259).
The same writer incidentally lets slip the following pointed remark 
in allusion to a bad custom which has so much increased of late.
" It 
is a great pity that the great mass of matter (about thirty folio volumes) 
ready for his Enumeration, which Vahl left at his premature death, 
was never published.
His descriptions are amongst the most accurate 
I know amongst descriptions of species, so much better than descrip- 
697 
tious of individuals, which botanists, accurate in miiuitiac, are so apt 
to give us." (No. 58, p.
526).
As a contrast to the habit of describing individuals for species, we 
will now copy a suggestion by Mr. Spruce, which may rather astonish 
some of the "species-splitters." Of Aquilegia pyrenaica, he observes, 
" I do not see how this is to be kept apart from A.
alpina, for I find 
the spur always more or less curved at the extremity ; and I consider 
it highly probable that both of them are merely alpine states of A.
vul- 
garis." (No. 28, p.
537).
Tarry-at-home botanists, with every facility for drying specimens, 
often make heavy complaints against the condition in which those of 
distant countries are sent to us, and more especially those of intertro- 
pical lands.
An extract from Vogel's notes may teach us to make 
some allowance for this frequently unavoidable defect.
He writes, 
" I am very comfortable on board, except when my collections are 
lying about.
When I return laden with plants, I have nowhere 
to prepare them ; and when they are dry, the damp insinuates itself 
to such a degree, that I am compelled to re-dry them.
This is very 
troublesome ; and on board a ship, especially a man-of-war, there is no 
especial place for preparing or preserving plants.
I am quite a nui- 
sance to my messmates when I unpack them ; and so is the servant 
who announces breakfast, lunch, &c., for the table must be cleared.
I must be off, and then I try to work on deck; but there the wind 
and rain attack me, so that I have to contend with all the elements." 
Again, he says, " I regret very much that I have so many difficulties 
to overcome, in reference to my collections, from the scanty room on 
shipboard, and the humidity of the weather.
If not attended to daily, 
everything is covered with mould, and even the paper in the chest be- 
comes quite damp.
Perhaps,'after much pains, I am so fortunate as to 
get my plants dry, with the help of the sun and steam-engine ; but I 
hafe still to look to them again, and often find cause enough for 
repeating the process.
Notwithstanding all this trouble, the specimens 
are bad, they fall to pieces and mould continually ; and I must sit 
down under the sorry consolation, that I have effected with all my 
zeal as much as circumstances will allow." (No. 59, pp.
605 and 
610).

The System of Nature, as displayed in the Vegetable Kingdom.
By Edward Newman.
When a man feels convinced that he has published new and im- 
portant truths, he cannot reasonably be required to keep silence 
respecting them ; it does not argue a lack of modesty that he should 
desire to see those truths known and appreciated.
I do not at all parti- 
cipate in the feelings of authors, who profess to write for another 
and a wiser generation : I wish those whom I know by reputation or 
by familiar intercourse, or with whom I am united in the bond of brother- 
hood and good feeling, or who, like myself, love truth for its own great 
and glorious sake, T wish these to enter on the inquiry, to examine 
699 
what I have written, to condemn what is erroneous, and to cherish, 
and acknowledge, and propagate what is true.
Entertaining these 
views, I make no apology for introducing my ideas of the System of 
Nature to the readers of the ' Phy tologist.
' 
The present era in botanical science is marked by the severity with 
which methods have been analyzed and tested : we seem to have ar- 
rived at a period when nothing that is old and faulty can stand.
The 
sexual method of Linneus is an instance of this ; nothing could be 
more ingenious, more obvious, more triumphant, or at the same time 
more artificial.
Day by day it is losing ground as a method, although 
the services of its details can never be dispensed with.
Every system 
of organs, every series offunctions, is now rigidly investigated, and the 
microscope is perpetually called in, to render the result more complete.
Now it is very desirable to bear in mind that the views I promulged 
respecting System as regards the Animal Kingdom, are mainly depen- 
dant on the laborious researches of Cuvier, GeofFroy St. Hilaire, and 
Owen: without the dissecting knife and microscope, without the rigid 
investigations of the anatomists, no human efforts could ever reach the 
truth : and so in the Vegetable Kingdom, it is the patient and labori- 
ous physiologist who must supply the clew to the true system.
Whatever may be said of the respective merits of the methods of 
Linneus and Jussieu, I believe the feeling is universal, that these me- 
thods owe their merits entirely to their respective authors.
The 
terms natural and artificial^ erroneously applied to them, has misled 
many superficial writers, and some have even been stolid enough to 
assert that Linneus, in speaking of a natural system, made a prophetic 
allusion to the method of Jussieu.
I shall take no pains to enforce the existence of a really natural 
system : it is to me so self-evident a fact, that T waive the inquiry as al- 
together superfluous.
And assuming this, I also deny to man the 
power of erecting one.
Thus supposing a Ray, a Jussieu or a 
De Candolle to excel in the perception of character, and, by great 
discrimination, to succeed informing a series in which species shall fol- 
low each other in what appears orderly succession : the great merit 
of these philosophers still consists in having, by means of their know- 
ledge and discrimination, obtained some idea, more or less precise as 
the case may be, of that universal scheme which is preexistent to hu- 
man knowledge and independent of human genius.
Thus by a strange 
iuvertion of what we are too apt to consider retributive justice, the 
more nearly human intellect can attain to the enunciation of Nature's 
laws as regards system, the further it recedes from that ardently 
700 
sought for notoriety which is the concomitant of human conceptions, 
and is nicely apportioned in degree to their respective briUiancy.
My own ideas of system have been fully explained as regards the 
Animal Kingdom ; but as far as ray information extends, no attempt 
has even been made to test the applicability of the same laws to the 
vegetable world.
I do not pretend that 1 am in a situation to do this, 
but I think enough is now known of the Vegetable Kingdom to show 
the extreme probability, the almost certainty of the applicability of 
the same laws in grouping both animals and vegetables.
The his- 
tory of physical science exhibits a tendency to subdivide large and 
conspicuous forms, rather than small or obscure forms.
This tendency 
spreads itself like an impenetrable fog over the works of our earlier 
naturalists, but becomes gradually dissipated by the advance of know- 
ledge.
And here perhaps I may be allowed to venture a criticism on 
Linnean classification.
It was the failing of this great man to leave 
the more imperfect individuals of every group, without sufficient inves- 
tigation, and hence to institute groups bearing the same title, but of most 
unequal value.
In this respect, Jussieu was infinitely superior : who 
that has the slightest idea of equivalents in natural history, will not 
at once admit that Monandria or Diandria or Triandria, is no equiva- 
lent to the class Cryptogamia, while the Vasculares and Cellulares of 
Jussieu are as justly balanced as the Vertebrata and Invertebrata of 
Lamarck : in saying this I do not assert that either of these divisions 
is unexceptionable, but they are intelligible, and indicate compre- 
hensive ideas in those who defined them.
The value of equivalents 
has yet to be acknowledged, but acknowledged it must be before we 
can make one safe step towards the discovery of the System of 
Nature.
In the Animal Kingdom, the great and simple division suggested by 
Lamarck of Vertebrata and Invertebrata is perfectly truthful, which is 
the highest attribute of all, but is it final .-' Can we show that the 
Invertebrata does not contain several groups equal to the whole of the 
Vertebrata?
Can we not, on the contrary, show that itYloes contain such 
groups ?
Are not the Articulata, Molluscata, and Radiata, as regards 
primary difference in structure, nearly as isolated as the Vertebrata 
themselves ?
The use of the negative in is intensely deceptive : we 
can scarcely resist grasping at so plausible a division as vertebrate 
and ewvertebrate, but if we reflect that a division into radiate and 
2wradiate possesses in an equal degree the merit of a positive and nega- 
tive, we shall pause, before allowing too great weight to such a mode ol 
division.
701 
It was left for the master mind of a Cuvier to divide the Animal 
Kingdom into four provinces, all of them distinguished by positive 
characters only ; and although several attempts have subsequently 
been made to alter and amend these provinces, they are so based on 
real structural character as to meet with universal acceptation : these 
provinces are Vertebrata, MoUusca, Articulata and Radiata.
Now 
without pausing to investigate the methods which have succeeded 
the binary or dichotomous division of vegetables, let us pass at once 
to the most recent and most extensively known classification of the 
Vegetable Kingdom ; I allude to that by Professor Lindley : we 
shall there find four vast comprehensive classes called Exogens, 
Endogens, Thallogens and Acrogcns, and we shall find no botanist 
expressing a doubt as to the naturalness of each of these.
They 
include nearly the whole of the Vegetable Kingdom ; but Professor 
Lindley has separated three minor groups, and given them a stand- 
ing equal to the four comprehensive classes, i.
e., he has called all 
of them classes.
The three minor classes are Rhizogens, constructed 
for the reception of the Rafflesiacese, &c,; Dictyogens, comprising Ta- 
mus, Paris, &c.
; Gymnogens, including the pines, the yew, the juniper.
Without attempting to influence the reader in his judgment of the dis- 
tinctness of these minor classes, the almost immeasurable superi- 
ority of the major classes as regards the number of species they 
contain, is sufficient to warrant our giving them precedence in an in- 
quiry like the present.
We have thus four primary divisions in each 
kingdom : in animals.
Vertebrates, Articulates, Molluscates and 
Radiates ; in plants, Exogens, Endogens, Acrogens and Thallogens : 
each of the two kingdoms, in fine, possesses what Cuvier has called 
four " general plans after which the individuals appear to have been 
modelled." 
Having thus shown that a numerical correspondence exists between 
the primary divisions of the two kingdoms, the next task is to exhibit 
a correspondence between the classes themselves, i.
e., to show that 
each of the four divisions of the Vegetable Kingdom corresponds 
with a division of the Animal Kingdom.
The idea of the existence 
of parallels between the divisions of the two kingdoms is of a very early 
date, and more recently M.
Virey has laid great stress on these pa- 
rallels, and has shown a very marked correspondence between the two 
kingdoms.
At present I have only to touch on this subject as acces- 
sary to the development of the System of Nature.
The analogy existing between the exogens among plants and the 
vertebrates among animals, seems too obvious to require comment : 
Vol II.

702 
neither will,any instructed naturalist express a doubt as to the analogy 
between endogens and articulates.
These analogies have been so fully 
established by more able pens than mine, that I could not attempt to 
adduce new proofs without obvious impertinence, neither could I 
retrace the steps of my predecessors without needless repetition.
The 
case is howes'er somewhat different in what are called the lower classes, 
for we have until lately been taught to combine under the name of 
acrogens, two totally dissimilar and distinct classes : one of these, acro- 
gens is composed of the ferns, Lycopodia and mosses ; the other, thal- 
logens, of the Fungi, Lichens and Algae.
Now the thallogens are 
very evidently analogous to the radiates, many of them display all 
the peculiarities' of the radiate structure, and in those instances in 
which the radiation from a centre is lost, analogues occur in the cor- 
responding group from which this peculiarity is also absent.
It must 
however be observed that our knowledge of both classes is yet in its 
infancy.
Concerning the more conspicuous thallogens, the agarics, 
an opinion has just been broached that they are merely the 
flower of a subterranean plant,* and concerning one of our most inte- 
resting zoophytal radiates, Photocrinus europaeus, it has been dis- 
covered by Mr. J.
V. Thompson, that its head, or armed disk, at a certain 
period of its existence, becomes detached, and thenceforth wanders free 
as Comatula rosacea.
The question must occur to every reflecting 
mind, â€” Are we to consider the Photocrinus or the Comatula the type 
for comparison ?
Is the spawn or the mushroom the perfect plant ?
These questions are not to be answered hastily.
How little do we 
yet know of the laws which regulate the reproduction of species !
It was long a received opinion, that an animal or a plant repro- 
* After describing the hymenium, the pileus, &c., A.
de Jiissieu says, "The 
parts just described do not, however, constitute the whole of the fungus : they are, in 
fact, in a certain sense, nothing more than its inflorescence.
Before this is developed, 
we see a number of filaments, radiating from a common centre (which centre is pro- 
bably a spore in a state of geriniuation), and intersecting each other in all directions ; 
they subsequently become entangled and thickened at certain points, at which are 
formed the organs previously described.
This filamentous net-work is named the 
mycelium ; it is generally concealed below the surface of the ground, and escapes ob- 
servation as well by its situation as by its fragile texture ; it is not however unfre- 
quently developed in damp and dark places ; as, for instance, on w^ood in our cellars.
This mycelium is a sort of subterranean tree, which exposes to the light only the ex- 
tremities of its branches, furnished with the organs of reproduction, so that in general, 
all the fungi which we observe growing in communities, belong in reality but to a 
sinole individual ; hence arises the circular disposition so frequently affected by them, 
the mycelium being regularly developed in the centre, and sending its rays to equal 
distances from that centre.'' â€” Botanique, par Adrien de Jussieu : p.
549.
703 
duces its own likeness, but more careful observation has shown that this 
is far from being uniformly the case, or in other words, that the law^ 
of reproduction is irregular unless it be in undetermined cycles.
Every one knows that the entomologist has laid down a law for the 
reproduction of insects; he tells us that each individual commences life 
as an egg, then becomes a larva, then a pupa, and lastly an imago; but, 
the little insignificant plant-louse refuses these conditions, and mounts 
upwards one step with one or several generations ; thus the egg he- 
comes a larva, the larva produces a larva, this larva a pupa, and the 
pupa becomes an imago.
In the ' Entomological Magazine' for April, 
1833, was published the astounding and then incredible fact that the 
hop-fly was sometimes born with wings.* But this discovery sinks into 
insignificance compared with observations lately published by a Ger- 
man naturalist, on some of the more obscure tribes of radiate animals.
This author asserts that certain forms which have long been considered 
perfect animals, and have been ranged in our methods under other fixed 
technical names, are absolutely the parents or progenitors of certain 
other animals, which are also ranged in our methods under other fixed 
technical names : and it seems that these nurses may succeed each 
other, as in the Aphides, for many generations.
In introducing this 
brief notice of Steenstrup's work, I do not wish to be understood as 
adopting his views ; all I can venture to say is, that his observations 
appear to have been made with patience and care, and his deductions 
drawn with perfect candour and fair reasoning, so that his work is en- 
titled to our respect.
Seeing, then, how difficult it is to fix on states 
that shall exactly correspond, a comparison of the radiates and thallo- 
gens must be madefrom a general, rather than an individual, similarity: 
and we shall find in their equivocal mode of reproduction, in the 
obscurity, if not absence of sexes, in the simplicity of their structure, 
and in their general tendency to radiation from a centre, that there is a 
general similarity between these two primary divisions.
The acrogens, restricted to the ferns, mosses, &c., are supposed by 
systematists to be the analogues of the mollusks, including the Anneli- 
des ; and as in the thallogens, so in the acrogens, we have great 
difficulty in fixing the portion of the plant which shall be the subject 
of comparison.
The frond of a fern has been called a branch, a leaf, 
and a flower ; but the general plan seems to be to treat the fronds, taken 
collectively, as the entire plant : now if this view be correct, I confess 
that there is but slender hope of establishing any analogy between a fern 
and a great yellow slug, or any of the slug tribe.
But let us pause 
*Ent. Masr., i.
315.
704 
before we allow the frond of a fern greater iraportance in the economy 
of the plant than it really possesses.
Three years ago I attempted to 
introduce Polypodium vulgare on a wall at Peckham, the fronds 
withered and fell, but now, since the recent rains in October, and long 
after I supposed the plant dead, two fronds have appeared, and though 
small, they will probably live through the winter : thus it will appear evi- 
dent, not only that the fronds are not the plant, but that the plant can 
exist for two years without their assistance.
I therefore incline to re- 
gard the rhizoma as the plant in Polypodium vulgare, and its fronds 
as respiratory and reproductive appendages, which, when their office is 
performed, wither and fall, without^ injury to the plant which bears 
them : this idea will I think receive additional confirmation from an 
attentive examination of the bulky rhizoma of Davallia Canariensis.
Now if this bulky rhizoma is the plant, as the slug is certainly the 
animal, it is the limaciform rhizoma, and not the beautifully divided 
frond of the Davallia, that we must compare with the slug : the same 
may be said of Polypodium and Trichomanes : their vermiform rhizo- 
mata may fairly be conipared with Annelides, without any extraordinary 
strain on the inventive faculties.
Pursuing this subject still further, we 
shall find that many limaciform nudibranchiate mollusks throw out, as 
respiratory organs, beautifully branched fronds resembling those of 
ferns.* In reproduction there is also a correspondence : mollusks are 
hermaphrodite, each individual is productive, and ferns produce seed 
without the apparent presence of stamens, or anything to which 
can be assigned a similar office ; so that the sexes are mixed, and 
not distinct as in the vertebrates and exogens, and the articulates and- 
endogens.
I believe the more the subject is investigated, the more 
strict will be found the analogy between mollusks among animals, and 
acrogens among vegetables.
We thus arrive at the following parallel 
Plans of Structure.
In the Animal Kingdom.
In the Vegetable Kingdom.
Vertebrate -= Exogen 
Articulate __ Endogen 
Molluscate = Acrogen 
Radiate __ Thallogen 
The next proposition relates to the position of these divisions.
I have taken great pains to show that the four divisions of the Ani- 
* Tritonia arborescens of Cuvier is a remarkable instance of this ; it has seven or 
eight pairs of these branchial fronds, those towards the head being the largest and 
those nearest the tail the smallest : the anterior pairs are beautifully divided and sub- 
divided, like the fronds of Davallia.
705 
nial Kingdom cannot be made to follow each other in a linear series, 
because each of the divisions, articulates, mollusks and radiates, con- 
tains more highly organised animals than some that must necessarily be 
placed in both the others: moreover, the first division, vertebrates, con- 
tains animals which seem to typify or indicate respectively the articulate, 
mollusk and radiate plans of structure.
As I am aware that many of 
my readers are not zoologists, I will select a more strikingly obvious 
example of this typification or indication.
The superior group among 
Vertebrata contains the four well-known classes, called Mammals, 
Birds, Reptiles and Fishes.
All but the first of these are peculiarly 
well marked : a child, before he can speak plainly, knows a bird, a 
reptile, and a fish from each other : the mammals form a group which 
all naturalists agree in considering of higher rank than either of the 
others, and as a concomitant of this superiority, there should be found 
among them animals which respectively indicate, typify, or represent, 
birds, reptiles and fishes ; and this is strictly the case : among mam- 
mals we find birds indicated in the bats; reptiles in the armadilloes 
and anteaters; and fishes in the whales and dolphins.
The uninstruct- 
ed mind at once sees the force of this representation ; it even contends 
that a bat is a bird, that an armadillo is a reptile, and that a whale is 
a fish.
This is going too far: we may fairly consider them the repre- 
sentatives of these classes, but not as belonging to them.
Bats, whales, 
and armadilloes agree in possessing warm blood, in being truly vivi- 
parous, and in suckling their young : it is therefore impossible to dis- 
join them from typical mammals, such as the ordinary quadrupeds, 
although the bats adopt the flight of a bird, together with possession 
of many important similarities of structure ; although armadilloes and 
anteaters have the alimentary canal, the reptant gait, the dermal arma- 
ture of reptiles ; and although the dolphins and whales have the figure, 
the fins, and the habits of fishes.
Now, supposing the mammals 
grouped on a level surface, the most perfect or typical occupying the 
centre of the group, then we shall find a variety of forms, which indi- 
cate, more or less obviously, an approach to one or other of the three 
aberrant forms, namely bats, anteaters and whales, and we shall find 
that these three forms differ from each other as widely as it is pos- 
sible for animals to do, which must necessarily be regarded as part 
of the same superior group : so that abandoning all idea of a linear 
series, which, indeed, it is impossible to construct, and supposing the

then must the bats, anteaters and whales occupy the angles; for we 
can not otherwise express their dissimilarity inter se and their depar- 
ture from the type.
The subjoined figure expresses this.
Bats.
Typical 
Mammals.
Whales.
Anteaters.
The contents of the group called mammals being thus expressed, not 
for any hypothetical end, but because their difference from the typi- 
cal forms and from each other cannot he otherwise expressed, it remains 
only to arrange the great classes of birds, reptiles and fishes, in 
places which common sense will at once assign them, as under.
Birds.
Bats.
Mammals.
Whales.
Anteaters.
Fishes.
Reptiles.
As I have said before, the Vertebrata have been selected rather than 
the entire Animal Kingdom, because their divisions are more obvious 
to those who do not happen to have made structural Zoology their 
particular study : those who have studied this science, will see that 
the same formula of arrangement obtains in the primary divisions, and 
that they range thus : â€” 
ARTICULATES.
VERTEBRATES.
RADIATES.
MOLLUSCATES.
707 
Lest a question be asltecl, " What fixes the relative position of 
Articulata, Molluscata and Radiata ?
" it may be as well to observe 
that this cannot be altered ; place Molluscata or Radiata at the top, and 
the relative position of the four groups, will still be exactly as shown 
above.
It is now necessary to show a correspondence between this formula 
of arrangement and that which obtains in the Vegetable Kingdom : 
the four primary groups of vegetables are placed in a corresponding 
position below.
ENDOGENS.
EXOGENS.
THALLOGENS.
ACROGENS.
This formula, it will doubtless be observed, is only hypothetical at 
present, but a little further investigation will remove this impression, 
and show that it is real.
And here it is necessary to go back to the 
three diminutive groups which have already been noticed as having 
been lately proposed by Professor Lindley: these are Dictyogens, Gym- 
nogens, and Rhizogens, all of which I am willing to take as they are, 
viz.y certain plants which like bats, anteaters and whales, present struc- 
tural peculiarities which render it difficult to class them with either of 
the larger groups.
It is quite foreign to my purpose to claim for 
them the title of Classes, Alliances or Orders ; it is sufficient that a 
botanist of Mr. Lindley's eminence has considered it necessary to 
separate them from the rest.
Dictyogens, as will be seen by turning to the paper (Phytol ii.
561) 
to which I have before alluded, are separated from endogens, because 
the leaves are "net-veined and deciduous, " and because the roothas its 
wood arranged " in a solid concentric circle." Still the plants of this 
gi'oup are monocotyledonous, and are said to have the " wood of their 
stems arranged in a confused manner with the youngest in the centre." 
As far as I am aware, these conditions are accepted by all botanists, 
although Mr. Lindley is the only one who has thought them sufficiently 
important for the foundation of a new division.
Well then, it follows 
that these plants combine the essential characters of exogens with 
some of the more obvious and usually distinctive characters of endo- 
gens, so that we must either consider them a separate class, as Mr.
Lindley has done, or endogenoid exogens, or exogenoid endogens.
708 
One of these courses we must adopt, and I am content with either, 
for either will fix their station between the typical endogens and 
the typical exogens, and will show that these great classes lead into 
each other.
The class Gymnogens, in prior works by the same author, is made 
to combine the pines, the equiseturas and some other groups, but in 
the present publication the equisetums are omitted, and carried over 
the boundary which has hitherto separated them from acrogens, a 
group in which they are generally included by other authors.
The 
plants in this class are separated from the other exogens by the cha- 
racter, " seeds quite naked." The facial or superficial approach of 
the pines to the extinct Calamites, of these again to equisetums and 
tree-ferns, is obvious to all ; much might also be said of the pecu- 
liar wood of the Coniferaj, which has lately attracted so much atten- 
tion, and has shown how this group recedes from the true exogenous 
structure, and approaches the acrogenous structure of the ferns, without 
displaying, as far as I can detect, a similar approach to the structure 
of the endogens, so that by means of the gymnogens, whether we con- 
sider them a distinct class or not, we must pass from the exogens to the 
acrogens without the intervention of the commonly interposed class of 
endogens.
"At this point of the Vegetable Kingdom," says Mr. Lindley, 
" there is a plain transition from the highest form of organization to 
the lowest.
Gymnogens are essentially exogens in all that apper- 
tains to their organs of vegetation ; they have concentric zones in their 
wood, a vascular system, in which spiral vessels are found, and a 
central pith ; but they are analogous to reptiles in the Animal King- 
dom, inasmuch as their ova are fertilized by direct contact with the 
male principle.
The two most remarkable of the orders are conifers 
and cycads.
Of these, the former is connected with club-mosses 
among acrogens by means of the extinct genus, Lepidodendron, and 
their branches are sometimes so similar to those of certain lycopods 
* " Among endogens no difference has been remarked in the mode of propagation, but 
a material peculiarity has been noticed in the manner of growth.
In the great mass 
of the class the stem and root are formed in a similar way, or there is no considerable 
difference between them, and the leaves have no articulation with the stem ; but in a 
part of them the root is exactly like that of an exogen without concentric circles, and 
the leaves fall off the stem by a clean fracture, just as in that class.
Such fundamen- 
tal distinctions have given rise to the separation by me of endogens into â€” 1.
Endo- 
gens proper, and 2.
Dictyogens." â€” Lindley^ Veg. Kingd.

The above is correctly quoted, but the statement that the root is " without concen- 
tric circles '' of woody matter is evidently a misprint.

themselves, as to leave no doubt of their relation.
Compare, for in- 
stance, Lycopodium Phlegmaria and Cunninghamia siamensis.
Some 
cycads have the gyrate vernation of the leaves of true ferns, along 
with the inflorescence of conifers ; and their mode of forming their 
trunk, although essentially the same as that of exogens, yet resembles 
the growth of acrogens in lengthening by a terminal bud only.
While, however, the class of gymnogens is thus distinctly mai'ked by 
the most important physiological peculiarities, it approaches the high- 
est forms of vegetation by that portion of it which bears the name of 
joint-firs, plants with all the structure of their class, but with the 
manner of growth of chloranths and beef-woods," â€” L.

The Rhizogens are a peculiar tribe, and have become intimately 
known to botanists through the descriptions of Robert Brown and 
the inimitable figures of Bauer, published in the " Transactions of the 
Linnean Society of London." It will be sufl&cient to mention the re- 
markable genus Rafilesia as the type of this class, in order to place 
the class itself fully before the mind of a botanist.
Mr. Lindley cha- 
racterises therhizogens as flowering, sexual plants, whose fructification 
springs from a thallus.
Notwithstanding the labours of Robert Brown 
we are still in ignorance of many essential characters of these plants : 
we see nothing more than a huge, fleshy flower, sessile on the root or 
rhizoma of some other vegetable ; there is no stem, leaf, or root ; the 
vast expanded flower is all that we can see.
Many botanists have 
considered it phaenogamous, others cryptogamous.
The substance on 
which it grows must receive farther investigation, the nature of its con- 
nexion with the flower is a point of the greatest interest : â€” Mr.
Lindley's idea of its afiinities is conveyed in this passage.
" At 
this point of the Vegetable Kingdom we find a most curious assem- 
blage, which, with many of the peculiarities of endogens, seem to be 
an intermediate form of organization between them and thallogens.
* " Among exogens there are, however, two totally different modes in which the in- 
fluence of the pollen is communicated to the seed.
The larger part of this great class 
consists of plants provided with the apparatus called style and stigma, through which 
pollen-tubes are introduced into the ovary during the act of fertilization.
But others 
are so constructed that the pollen falls immediately upon the ovules, without the in- 
troduction of any intermediate apparatus ; a peculiarity analogous to what occurs 
among reptiles in the Animal Kingdom: and, as was to have been anticipated, the 
plants in which this singular habit occurs prove, upon being collected together, to 
form a group having no direct affinity with those among which they had been previ- 
ously associated.
Hence exogens have been broken up into, â€” 1.
Exogens proper, or 
those having an ovary, style, and stigma; and 2.
Gymnogens, which have neither.''^ 
Lindley, Veg. Kingd.

They have no relation to acrogens, but they agree with endogens in 
the presence of sexes and sometimes in the ternary structure of their 
flower; they have however scarcely any spiral vessels, and their seeds 
appear, as far as they have been examined, either as some say, to 
want the cotyledons and axis of other flowering plants, or to lose 
themselves in a mass of pulp from which they are almost indistinguish- 
able.
In their amorphous succulent texture, in their color, often in 
their putrid odour when decaying, in the formation of a mycelium or 
spawn, which is evident in Helosis and is with good reason suspected 
to exist in others, and in their parasitical habits, these plants resem- 
ble fungals, while in their flowers and sexes they accord with Arum- 
worts or similar endogens." â€” L.
V.K. 83.
It appears to me very clear that Mr Lindley is mistaken in 
supposing any points of correspondence between the flowers of 
of the rhizogens and those of Arumworts, except such general corre- 
spondence as exists between all flowers.
I could wish this learned 
botanist had pointed out a single point of accordance not equally 
applicable to all the phoenogamous plants.
I confess my own convic- 
tion that there are but two of the primary classes with which the 
rhizogens can be associated : if not in reality constituting a separate 
class, as Mr. Lindley supposes, they must be either fungoid exo- 
gens, or phanerogamous fungi.
They partake of the characters 
of each class so strongly, so decidedly, that should further investiga- 
tions prove them to be fungi, they must necessarily occupy the very 
margin of the group of thallogens, and precisely at the spot where it 
most nearly approaches the group of exogens.
On the other hand, 
should they prove to be exogens, then, certain decidedly fungoid 
characters must lead us to place them at the extreme margin of 
the group of exogens, where these approach the thallogens.
From these observations the following formula results.
ENDOGENS.
DiCTYOGENS.
EXOGENS.
Rhizogens.
Gymnogens.
THALLOGENS.
ACROGENS.
711 
Now this is exactly the formula that I have already shown to 
obtain in the Animal Kingdom ; and so convinced do I feel of its 
truth that I look forward to the result of every investigation into 
the detail of structure, as certain to furnish corroborative evidence.
I am unprepared to pursue the subject further than this, which may 
be termed the mere threshold of the enquiry ; but sincerely do I 
hope that others who are better botanists and better logicians than 
myself will not allow the question to rest ; sincerely do I hope that 
there are those amongst my readers who may not pin their faith on 
the merits of a method however ingenious, merely because it happens 
to be invented by a Ray, a Linneus, a Jussieu, a DeCandolle or a 
Lindley ; but consider whether there be not a system-maker far above 
these.
And let me ask them whether it be not a worthier occupation 
diligently to work out the details of that system which has existed from 
the beginning, than to cavil about the merits of methods, the value of 
which depends solely on the degree of assistance they may render us 
in working out the "System of Nature." Edward Newman.
Supplementary Note.
By Mr. George Luxford, A.L.S., F.B.S.E., 
Lecturer on Botany at St. Thomas's Hospital, 
Having lately reviewed the subject of Rhizogens, as well as the 
materials at my command will allow, I may venture to declare my 
opinion that they must be regarded as an offshoot of Exogens, in op- 
position to Lindley's supposition that they are Endogens, with which 
I must confess I previously agreed ; but supposing them to be En- 
dogenous, there would be a manifest want of a connecting link be- 
tween Exogens and Thallogens, equivalent to the very evident tran- 
sition from Exogens and Acrogens afforded by the Gymnogens, 
and the equally strong connexion between Exogens and Endogens, 
exhibited by Dictyogens.
Before the nature of the rhizogens was so well understood as it 
now is, they were by some botanists considered to be altogether of a 
fungoid character.
That they do actually partake, in a certain degree, 
of the character of thallogens, there seems to be but little doubt ; 
but it is also certain that their strong affinity with phsenogamous 
plants is equally well established.
They possess a distinct sexual 
apparatus, more or less modified indeed, and in some genera of very 
anomalous character, but apparently never so changed as that the 
male and female organs cannot be readily distinguished.
The an- 
thers, in some, open by slits, in others by pores; their pollen has 
712 
been well observed; and in Cytinus R.
Brown has traced the pollen- 
tubes through the tissue of the style, into the ovarium, "where they 
follow the direction of the placentae, and become mixed with the 
ovula." The female flowers of all possess an unmistakeable ovarium, 
furnished with placentae, to which the ovules are attached, each by 
its funiculus : and the seeds, so far as they have been examined, are 
found to have an embryo.
In all these particulars the rhizogens 
evidently agree with flowering, and differ from flowerless plants : 
while the amorphous, fungoid character of their organs of vegetation 
as clearly evince their relationship with the Cellulares.
It is more difficult to make out their aflSnity as regards Exogens or 
Endogens.
In this part of the inquiry their organs of vegetation 
afford us no assistance, since these organs clearly point out their re- 
lationship with another division of the Vegetable Kingdom.
The 
almost normal structure of some parts of their organs of reproduction, 
however, indicate the quarter in which we must seek information.
The quaternary or quinary arrangement of the floral envelopes, in 
the majority of species, accords with the law obtaining in Exogens.
The condition of the embryo is a particular not so easily investigated, 
and from the minuteness of that organ, as well, perhaps, as from its 
not being in a sufficiently advanced stage of development when exa- 
mined, it is diflficult to decide whether it be divided or not.
Bauer 
and Brown seem to be of opinion that the embryo is undivided ; but 
Lindley, in speaking of the seed of Cynomoriura coccineum, says, 
" On one side of this seed is a globular embryo, looking like a speck, 
but found, when properly examined, to be a globose mass of cells, 
destitute of starch, inclosed within the albumen, and apparently un- 
divided on any part of its surface.
It is, however, difficult to speak 
positively upon this point, on account of its smallness, and / am not 
sure that it is not very sligJitly 2-lobed.''^ But after all, the division 
or non-division of the embryo, though in the more highly developed 
plants of very great value, as indicative of accompanying peculiari- 
ties of structure, in many of the humbler members of the Vegetable 
Kingdom seems really to be of minor importance, since in some 
avowedly exogenous genera, as the Monotropaceae, the embryo is 
undivided, while some as undoubtedly endogenous plants possess a 
divided embryo; and R.
Brown says "an embryo of exactly the 
same kind [as that of Rafflesiaceae and Balanoj^horeae] exists in Oro- 
banche, and other, perhaps all other, genera parasitic on roots." 
Indeed, when true leaves arc altogether absent, or are so deficient 
in develo]>ment as they are in such plants as Rafflesiaceae, Oro- 
713 
banchaceae and Monotropaceae, we need not be surprised at the 
absence or slight development of cotyledons in the embryo.
In the 
exogenous Cuscutaceae, too, the species of which are wholly destitute 
of leaves, the embryo is spiral, filiform, and perfectly acotyledonous.
Moreover, R.
Brown evidently considers the Rafilesiacese and their 
allies to be unquestionably related to the Aristolochiacese, which are 
exogens ; although this great botanist is as evidently inclined to dis- 
allow their claims to be looked upon as forming a distinct class.
But 
there are so many anomalies connected with their development and 
mode of growth, and those anomalies seem all to point to the normal 
mode of increase by means of a mycelium or thallus, observed in the 
best understood fungoid members of the class of thallogens, that I 
cannot but agree with Professor Lindley in believing that the rhi- 
zogens do really form a distinct class, the several members of which 
are as intimately related among themselves by numerous unmistake- 
able peculiarities, as by these very peculiarities they are separated 
from the other classes, and naturally located as a connecting link be- 
tween the exogens and thallogens.
In one part of his second paper on Rafflesia in the ' Linnean 
Transactions,' Dr. Brown thus speaks of what has ever been a puz- 
zling question in connexion with the economy of all entophytal para- 
sites : â€” 
" I may here advert to one of the most difficult points in the eco- 
nomy of Rafflesiacea3, namely, by what means their minute embryos, 
which are at the same time of an extremely loose texture, are enabled 
to penetrate through the bark of the plants on which they vegetate, 
so as to account for such appearances as those exhibited in the nas- 
cent Rafflesia Arnoldi represented in [its second stage], in which I 
have been unable to trace any perceptible communication with the 
surface, and where the parasite seems rather to grow out of than into 
the stock."* 
Now it is this very circumstance which I look upon as affording 
one of the strongest evidences of the fungoid nature of the organs of 
vegetation among rhizogens.
It is precisely in accordance with the 
economy of entophytal thallogens, and equally opposed to all we 
know of that of parasitical phaenogamous plants.
By whatever 
means the spores of entophytal fungi obtain access to the interior of 
plants, we see nothing of the fungi until they are ready iojlower^ if I 
* I have described these figiu-es in connexion with Dr. Brown's remarks on the re- 
ticulate base of Rafflesia (Phytol.
ii.
714).

may use the terra.
Their vegetative functions go on unseen within 
the substance of the plant infested by them, until the time arrives for 
the performance of one grand object of their existence, the propaga- 
tion of their kind ; the organs of reproduction then break through 
the epidermis of the infected plant, just in the same way as the young 
flower-buds of Kafflesia penetrate the cortical layers of the vine : the 
spores of the parasite being perfected, are at length dispersed, and 
having found a fitting nidus, a new generation goes through the 
same round of operations as those which characterized the career of 
its parent.
But in most cases of parasitism among the phaenogamous plants, 
the parasites seem invariably to act on their victims from without 
inwards, that is, having fixed themselves on the external part, their 
radicles gradually penetrate the tissue of the internal portion to a 
greater or less depth.
This is equally the case with Viscum and Lo- 
ranthus, the seeds of which germinate on the bark of trees to which 
they have previously been firmly attached by means of their own vis- 
cid coating, and with Cuscuta, whose seeds in the first place germi- 
nate in the soil; the young Cuscuta subsequently attaches itself to its 
nurse by means of suckers, and then the root perishes.
Other phae- 
nogamous root-parasites also first attack the exterior of roots.
Mr.
Bowman has clearly explained in the ' Linnean Transactions' the 
mode in which the young Lathraea attaches itself to the roots of hasel 
and ash ; and Schlauter states, in the ' Annales des Sciences,' that 
when Orobanche attacks Picris hieracioides, the seeds attach them- 
selves to the points of the roots of the latter, which swell, and form a 
base for the parasite.
I am inclined to believe that this is also the 
case with at least one British species, Orobanche minor ; for in all 
cases where I have endeavoured to trace the connexion between this 
parasite and the roots of the clover, I have invariably found the 
former located near the termination of the fibrous roots of the latter : 
and Vaucher states that the seeds of Orobanche ramosa do not sprout 
unless they come in contact with the roots of hemp, and that they 
will even lie inert in the earth for years, except they meet with their 
proper nidus.
Notwithstanding this apparent difference in the mode in which 
the rhizogens and other parasites obtain access to the internal parts 
of the plants on which they vegetate, they all seem to agree in the 
depth to which they penetrate in search of nutriment.
In Cuscuta, 
Lathraja, Viscum and Loranthus, the suckers stop at the first layer of 
completely formed wood, and judging from the figures of Rafflesia in 
715 
the * Linnean Transactions,' the base of that plant descends no lower 
in the roots and stems of the vine on which it grows.
The same 
thing is also represented by Blume in the figures of Rafflesia and 
Brugmansia in his ' Flora Javae,' and by Mr. Griffith in the figures of 
his Sapria in the ' Linnean Transactions.' Indeed, this we might ex- 
pect would be the case, since the proper juices of the plants which 
nourish the parasites, abound only in the outermost layers of new 
wood.
This seems the proper place to introduce some remarks by Mr.
Brown, with regard to the organs of vegetation of the rhizogens, and 
the nature of their connexion with the stock.
" Connected with this point a question may also arise, whether the 
earliest effort of the seed after its deposition in the proper nidus, by 
whatever means this is effected, may not consist in the formation of 
a cellular tissue extending laterally under the bark of the stock and 
capable of producing the fully developed parasite.
" This question might not occur in regard to E,afl3esia and Brug- 
mansia, in both of which the individual plants are in general suffi- 
ciently distant on the root of the Vitis to make it probable that each 
developed parasite is produced from a distinct seed.
But in Pilos- 
tyles, and even Cytinus, where they are closely approximated, their 
possible origin from one common basis or thallus is more readily sug- 
gested, especially on considering that in the former genus, which is 
dioecious, each group of parasites is generally, perhaps always, ex- 
clusively of one sex ; and that these groups, often of great density, 
not unfi-equently surround completely the branch of the stock.
But 
although this view did occur to me as not very improbable, and as 
tending to remove some of the apparent difficulties, I have never been 
able to trace any substance decidedly distinct from the proper tissue 
of the stock : there are, however, some appearances favouring the hy- 
pothesis in both genera, especially in Pilostyles, but which require 
careful examination in the living plants." â€” Linn.
Trans, xix.
232.
And further, on the nature of the connexion of the Rafflesiaceae 
with what Dr. Brown calls " the reticulate base," he says, â€” 
" This I ventured to consider a production of an intermediate kind, 
or rather as one derived from the stock or root of the vine, but excited 
and determined in its form and nature by the specific stimulus of the 
parasite.
I expected, therefore, to find it existing in the form of a 
covering to the bractese in the early state, as in Cytinus.
This point 
has been fully confirmed, and is well shown in Mr. Bauer's drawings 
of the very young buds." These figures represent four buds of the 
716 
parasite, in different stages of development, penetrating the cortical 
layers of a branch (not root) of a vine.* That they proceed from the 
interior of the branch, is evident from the place of the yonngest bud 
being merely indicated by a slight swelling, without any rupture of 
the bark.
In the third stage the parasitical bud has burst the outer 
cortical layer of the branch, and appears entirely inclosed in a reticu- 
lated covering : while in the fourth the reticulated covering itself has 
burst, and discloses the external floral envelopes of the parasite.
In 
reference to this reticulated envelope, Dr. Brown makes the remark 
in a foot-note, " That the whole of this covering belongs to the stock, 
is proved by its containing those raphides or acicular crystals which 
are so abundant in the root of the Vitis or Cissus, and which are al- 
together wanting in the parasite." This will be hereafter referred to.
It is with considerable diffidence that I am induced to express, 
however imperfectly, my reasons for looking upon these curious 
plants as forming a distinct class, especially as in so doing I am pre- 
suming to set up my own views in opposition to those of such able 
botanists as Dr. Brown and Mr. Griffith, who have both possessed 
greater advantages in studying the plants themselves, than I can ever 
hope to enjoy.
I can, however, truly affirm that I have not jumped 
hastily at my conclusions, and in forming them I have been mainly 
assisted by the evidence furnished in the published labours of the 
above-named gentlemen.
I am also happy to find that my views as 
to the distinctness of rhizogens as a class agree with the opinion of 
Dr. Lindley, who, in his last great work, ' the Vegetable Kingdom,' 
in raising them to that rank, appears to have done so on!
purely 
philosophical principles, and I think defends this step in such a way 
as to meet Mr. Griffith's most serious objections.
" The first office," says Dr. Lindley, " which all organized beings 
have to perform is that of feeding ; for it is thus only that their exis- 
tence is maintained.
The second is that of propagating, by means of 
which their species is perpetuated.
These being functions of the 
highest importance, it is reasonable to conclude that the organs pro- 
vided for their proper execution must be of the highest importance 
also, and hence they are beyond all others valuable for the purposes 
of classification.
And, again, because the power of feeding must 
come before that of propagating, it might be conjectured beforehand 
that the organs destined for the former operation would afford the 
first elements of a natural method.
But since the action of feeding is 
* This has been determined by Mr. Jack to be the Cissus angustifolia of Roxburgh.
717 
very simple in the Vegetable Kingdom, because of the similar modes 
of life observable among plants, while, on the contrary, the act of pro- 
pagation is highly diversified, on account of the very varied nature or 
structure of the parts by which it is accomphshed; so might we con- 
jecture that the organs of nutrition would afford but few distinctions 
available for purposes of classification, while those of fructification 
would furnish many.
And such is the fact.
Hence it is, that the 
great classes of plants are principally distinguished by their organs 
of growth, and that in the numerous minor groups such peculiarities 
are comparatively disregarded, their chief distinctions being derived 
from their parts of reproduction." â€” L.
V. K.
xxvi.
And again, according to his axioms : â€” 
" 1.
Peculiarities of structure which are connected with the man- 
ner in which a plant is developed are physiological ; those which are 
connected with the manner in which parts are arranged are structu- 
ral.
Physiological characters are of two kinds, viz., those which are 
connected with the mode of growth (the organs of vegetation J , and 
those which regulate reproduction (the organs of fructification).
Physiological characters are of greater importance in regulating the 
natural classification of plants than structural.
" 3.
The internal or anatomical structure of the axis, and of the 
foliage, is of more importance than any other character; because 
these are the circumstances which essentially regulate the functions 
of growth and the very existence of an individual." â€” Ih.
Now, examining the rhizogens by these axioms, we will endeavour 
to ascertain how far Mr. GriflEith's objections to them as a class are 
well founded.
He declares that " in the construction of the group 
called Rhizantheae, whatever its rank may be, a remarkable diversity 
of characters has been sacrificed to an appearance resulting from pa- 
rasitism on roots, and to an assumed absence of any ordinary form of 
vegetable embryo." â€” {Linn.
Trans, xix.
303).
But these objections 
surely fall to the ground, when we consider, first, the far more strong- 
ly marked diversity of character exhibited by plants composing the 
other classes of the Vegetable Kingdom ; and secondly, the evident 
affinity existing among the true rhizogens, with regard to their habit 
and structure.
For instance, what can possibly be more unlike, in 
nearly every character, among endogens, than the towering, highly 
developed, terrestrial palms, and the minute, simple, aquatic duck- 
weeds .'' And yet, they are both placed, not only in the same class, 
but in the same division of that class, notwithstanding that in the one 
we find the lowest, and in the other the highest degree of structural

development among endogenous plants.
Again, take the independent, 
sturdy oak, with its roots spreading far and wide in search of nutri- 
ment, and its hundreds of rings of annual growth, connected with the 
central system by means of the medullary rays ; compare this with 
many of its less developed associates among the exogens, the parasitic 
Clandestina, for example, in the stem of which neither medullary rays 
nor medullary sheath have been found, and whose nutriment is derived 
from the juices elaborated by other plants, by means of its own insi- 
dious roots.
Nothing has yet been observed among the rhizogens so 
utterly opposed to all our notions of structural affinity as these oppo- 
site examples display; and yet the class has been objected to on the 
ground that "a remarkable diversity of characters has been sacrificed 
to an appearance resulting from pai'asitism." But in this very para- 
sitism there is more real agreement than there is between the various 
modes in which plants included in other classes procure their nutri- 
ment; and if, as appears to have been done by Mr. Griffith himself, 
attempts have been made to thrust into the class plants which really 
differ from it in every essential character, the fault lies, not with the 
class, but with those who attribute to it discrepancies from which it is 
entirely free.
And first with regard to the parasitism of the rhizogens.
This, 
Mr. Griffith says, " can only be said to be constant in its effects, 
which are similar to those observed to occur (almost) constantly in all 
phaenogamous plants which are parasitic on roots ;" and he refers to 
four different modes of parasitism observable in the plants which he 
considers to have been included in this class, viz.: 1.
That exhibited 
by Rafflesia, Sapria and Cytinus : 2.
That of Balanophora and Phse- 
ocordylis: 3.
That of his own genus Thisraia: and 4.
That "said 
to occur in Pilostyles." Commencing with the group Rafflesiaceae, 
we will remind our readers of the mode of development exhibited by 
Rafflesia, as figured by Bauer, and previously described (Phytol.
ii.
715).
This plant is there clearly shown to penetrate the cortical lay- 
ers of the vine, proceeding from ivithin outwards ; in this particular 
perfectly agreeing with the mode of growth of the entophytal fungi, 
and being directly opposed to that of parasitic phaenogamous plants.
In this mode of parasitism perfectly agree all the genera included in 
the order ; namely Rafflesia, Brugmansia, Mr. Griffith's own genus 
Sapria, Apodanthes and Pilostyles : and with this is most probably 
combined another peculiarity ; that is, the existence of a subcortical 
mycelium or thallus, forming, in fact, the vegetative organs of the pa- 
rasites, from which are evolved the flowers or reproductive organs, 
719 
without the intervention of any stem or stalk.
To the probability of 
this, Dr. Brown thus alludes : "Connected with this point a question 
may also arise, whether the earliest effort of the seed after its deposi- 
tion in the proper nidus, by whatever means this is effected, may not 
consist in the formation of a cellular tissue extending laterally 
under the bark of the stock, and capable of producing the fully 
developed parasite." {Linn.
Trans, xix.
2.32).
The genus Pilostylis, 
expressly quoted by Dr. Brown as offering a mode of development 
with which he appears to consider both Rafflesia and Brugmansia 
coincide, Mr. Griffith would exclude altogether from the rhizogens, 
because of this peculiarity of growth.
Of the nature of the parasitism of the order Cytinaceae I cannot 
feel so certain, though from the figures I am inclined to suppose it 
differs only in degree from that of the Rafilesiacese; the former plants 
are distinguished from the latter by the scaly stem which rises from 
what, doubtless, is a kind of mycelium, more highly developed than in 
the RafHesiacea, and on this stem the reproductive organs are seated, 
instead of springing directly from the thallus, as in the Rafilesiacese.
In this order Dr. Lindley places Mr. Griffith's genus Thisraia, with 
a mark of doubt ; but this genus appears rather to belong to some 
exogenous or endogenous order.
That it is parasitical, there is hardly 
a doubt ; though its parasitism would seem to be of a very different 
nature from that of any of the rhizogens, and its habit indicates a 
structure of a much higher order.
The parasitism of the Balanophoraceae again appears to bring them 
near the lichens in their organs of vegetation; for the thallus from 
which the clusters of flowers spring bears a very strong resemblance 
to that of the crustaceous thallogens.
But surely, Sparrman's Sar- 
cophyte can have no business in the same order or class as such plants 
as Scybalium and Cynomorium.
On the nature of the organs of vegetation of the plants composing 
his order of rhizogens.
Dr. Lindley has the following remarks : â€” 
" In Helosis and Langsdorffia the rhizome, which is horizontal 
and branched, and which at intervals throws up perpendicular flower- 
ing stalks, is quite analogous to the spawn of fungals.
In Cynomo- 
rium, Scybalium and Balanophora this part is wanting, and in its 
room the roots of these genera emit roundish deformed tubers collect- 
ed in a circle upon the roots of other plants, and growing into [query 
out of] them by some unknown process.
Blume says, 'that at the 
period of germination of Balanophorese there is produced from the 
roots of the fig on which they grow an intermediate body, of a fleshy 
720 
nature and intimately combined with its superficial woody layers, 
and thdt this intermediate body is penetrated by their spiral vessels 
which render it woody.' He moreover adds, that ' several seeds of 
Balanophorese germinate on nearly the same points of the fig-root; 
hence this woody body, or luxuriant product of the juices that are 
sucked out, has generally an irregular form, and the plants proceed- 
ing from such tubers grow out in different directions, much in the 
same manner as the tubers of a potato generate their offsets ; with 
this difference, however, that in a potato the eyes of the plant are in 
the circumference, while in Balanophorathey are placed in the centre, 
and on that account the intermediate body where the offsets break 
out, has necessarily a conical extension.' Something of the same 
kind occurs in Scybalium, whose tubers are expanded in an irregular 
form about the root of some unknown tree, are fleshy, and composed 
even in the substance of the stalk of somewhat irregular cells and no 
spiral vessels." â€” Lind.
Veg. Kingd.
84.
Mr. GrifHth says " there is a wide difference, it appears to me, be- 
tween the parasitism of Sapria, Cytiuus, and very probably of Raffle- 
sia, and that of Balanophora and Pha^ocordylis, which appears to me 
to be of a peculiar nature." Blume's observations quoted above, how- 
ever, shovv a remarkable coincidence between the mode of growth of 
Rafilesia and Balanophora.
What Mr. Brown calls the reticulated 
base of RafBcsia, he has ascertained to be, as he anticipated, " derived 
from the stock or root of the vine, but excited and determined in its 
form and nature by the specific stimulus of the parasite ;" and re- 
specting this part in Balanophora, he thus writes : â€” " In some 
of those that I have examined, especially two species of Balanophora, 
the nature of this connexion is such, as can only be explained on the 
supposition that the germinating seed of the parasite excites a speci- 
fic action in the stock, the result of which is the formation of a struc- 
ture, either wholly or in part, derived from the root, and adapted to 
the support and protection of the undeveloped parasite ; analogous 
therefore to the production of galls by the puncture of insects :" 
{Linn.
Trans, xiii.
227).
Thus are the observations of Blume confirm- 
ed by one of the greatest botanists of the day, and at the same time is 
conclusive evidence afibrded of the identity of the mode of parasitism 
obtaining in two genera, which by some botanists have been consi- 
dered as having little in common ; the only difference being that in 
Rafflesia but one plant is developed from each of these gall-like en- 
largements of the stock, while in Balanophora there are several.
721 
In continuation of this subject I now follow up tie quotation from 
Lindley.
" The genuine species of Helosis show on their rhizome roundish 
conical buds seated on a very short stalk, or altogether sessile, inclos- 
ing the rudiments of a future head within a very thin involucre, as a 
fungus within the volva; this latter after a time splits into three or 
more segments, and emits the flower-head enlarged and furnished 
with a stalk, which is altogether naked except at the base, where it 
is surrounded by the scale-like segments of the withering involucre.
This is the most simple form of involucre, which in the other genera 
becomes more and more complicated, and finally runs into numerous 
series of imbricated scales, which clothe the stipes more or less com- 
pletely.
In those genera which grow upon the bark of the stems of 
trees, there are some diversities of structure in the organs of vegeta- 
tion that are very remarkable.
Blume tells us that Kafflesia Patraa 
appears upon the creeping roots or stems of Cissus scariosa in the 
form of solitary or clustered hemispherical dilatations, which look 
like excrescences or expansions of the root.
These excrescences are 
something of the nature of leaf-buds, consisting of layers of scales 
and a more solid centre.
As the latter increase in size they burst 
through the wrapper by tearing it irregularly from the apex towards 
the base, and develope themselves in the form of numerous scales, at 
first flesh-coloured, then brownish, and finally deep purple, which 
surround the flowers.
As soon as these parts are exposed, richly 
nourished as they are by the humid air that surrounds them, they 
grow with such rapidity, that it is reported that Rafilesia, which, 
when full-blown, is a yard across, and when unexpanded is as large 
as a middle-sized cabbage, only takes about three months for its 
complete development." â€” X.

Remarks on the parasitism of the rhizogens might be indefinitely 
multiplied ; I trust, however, that the above will sufficiently show 
that their mode of growth in the various genera agrees in kind and 
differs only in degree.
I have not much doubt that this will be con- 
firmed by further investigations and discoveries; and that conse- 
quently a conclusive answer will be afforded to Mr. Griffith's 
objection, that a diversity of characters has been *' sacrificed to an 
appearance of parasitism on roots." 
His second objection, referring to the " assumed absence of any 
ordinary form of vegetable embryo," need not detain us, since it is 
more than probable that extended observation will detect the embryo 
722 
in all the genera, as it has already determined the presence of spiral 
vessels even in those members of the class from which they were 
originally supposed to be absent.
But this is a matter of small mo- 
ment in regard to the unity of the class, since the peculiarities of 
the organs of growth among its members, in which they all seem 
to agree, are sufficient to separate them from the phajnogamous 
classes, with which other peculiarities in the organs of reproduction 
indicate their affinity.
One of Mr. Griffith's objections to the rhizogens, as a class, he 
equall}' applies to gymnogens, viz., their inferiority in number of 
species to the " other three natural classes or subkingdoms," allud- 
ing to the exogens, endogens and acrogens (from which, when the 
paper was written, the thallogens had not been separated).
The re- 
cently formed class, dictyogens, also agrees in this small number 
of species.
But this objection, so far from tending to overthrow the 
claims of the rhizogens to a place as a separate class, ought, it seems 
to me, to lead to the full recognition of those claims, and at the same 
time, to the admission of the perfect applicability of Mr. Newman's 
views of system to the vegetable kingdom.
According to Mr.
Newman, as he has himself explained, the whole Animal Kingdom 
naturally divides into four primary and three secondary (or minor) 
groups.
If really founded in Nature, equivalent groups ought to 
exist in the other kingdoms as well as in the Animal Kingdom ; and 
we accordingly find these groups ready made to our hand, and appa- 
rently well defined, in Lindley's ' Vegetable Kingdom,' the latest and 
best work on botanical classification published in this country.
No 
one will deny that the four primary groups are of higher value than 
the three minor groups ; indeed, the inferiority of these latter, with 
respect to the number of species included in them and other particu- 
lars, is so generally understood, that this circumstance has even been 
used as an argument against their admission." But when we consider 
that Professor Lindley, without any reference whatever to Mr. New- 
man's mode of grouping, has seen the necessity of separating the 
gymnogens from the exogens, and the dictyogens from the endogens, 
and has, moreover, from the internal evidence afforded by the rhizo- 
gens, considered it necessary to retain that group entire, notwith- 
standing the objections which have been raised to such a course; we 
may, I think, safely allow that the formation of these three minor 
groups was not altogether an arbitrary proceeding, but that there is 
evidence of their being actually founded in Nature.
723 
Moreover, by the position assigned to the minor groups in the for- 
mula at p.
710, we get rid of the difficulties which would be other- 
wise encountered in locating these groups so that their relative 
affinities might be clearly expressed.
The rhizogens, for example, 
affording, as they do, a natural transition from the exogens to the 
thallogens, cannot be more naturally placed than they are in the for- 
mula at p; 710 ; which position dissipates Mr. Griffith's objection 
that Dr. Lindley has placed them " after or in Monocotyledones." 
In conclusion, I cannot help expressing my opinion that the Sys- 
tem developed by Mr. Newman offers fewer objections and seems 
more in accordance with all the requirements of a natural arrange- 
ment than any other with which I am acquainted.
This is a most 
legitimate subject for discussion in the pages of the 'Phytologist;' 
for although I expect to see Mr. Newman's views entirely con- 
firmed by every fresh discovery, yet I must confess that I am not so 
wedded to my own opinions on certain points as to suppose them 
proof against free and fair discussion.
If no one better qualified 
should think it worth while to work out the minor details of classi- 
fication in accordance with the System above propounded, I may, if 
ever I have leisure, attempt to do so.
For the present, so alarmed do 
1 feel at my own temerity in having broached my ideas on this intri- 
cate matter, that in taking leave of the subject, I may say with Mac- 
beth, " Look on't again, I dare not."

Note on Achillea tanaceiifolia.
By W.

May I request the favour of a corner in next month's 'Phytologist' 
to correct an error in my paper which appeared in the number for 
this month.
The plant there alluded to from Cromford moor proves 
not to be Achillea serrata at all, but a species new to the British 
Flora, A.
tanacetifolia.
For its discovery we are indebted to Mr.
Hardy, who found it in another locality besides that already given.
I ought to state that it is to Mr. Babington that I owe the correction

THE PHYTOLOGIST.
A few Notes on Cornish Plants.
By the Rev. C.
A. Johns, M.A., F.L.S.
Mr. Gibson, in his notices of Cornish plants, lately inserted in the 
*Ph}tologist' (Phytol.
ii.
676), stales his fear that Asparagus officinalis 
may soon become extinct on the island which takes its name from 
that plant.
Botanists who are anxious that the stations of our rarer 
plants should be preserved, will be glad to hear that there is no real 
danger in the case of this interesting plant.
I call it interesting, not 
only from its being a botanical rarity, but because it is said to be the 
origin of the variety of that delicious vegetable, the green Battersea, 
and / A-Â«ozÂ£?
that it has been cultivated with great success.
Little 
harm is done to the plant by the guides, as they never take up the 
roots, and possibly the annual destruction of the foliage, though it 
prevents the plant from flowering, may promote the extension of its 
roots.
But even if this station be destroyed, there are at least two 
others, one of which is about a mile to the west of Kynance Cove, 
among the rocks on the cliff, where it flowers abundantly ; another is 
near the village of Cadgwith, about two miles east of the Lizard.
In 
this last station it grows in great profusion, in a deep ravine, and 
produces flowers and fruit.
A gentleman who was some years since 
stationed there as Lieutenant in the Preventive Service, told me that 
he annually supplied his table from this station during the season, 
and found it very good.
My friend, Mr. Hore's Geranium sylvaticum was undoubtedly a 
slip of the pen for G.
sanguineum.
Alsine verna and Spergula nodo- 
sa grow side by side at Kynance : the latter plant may best be dis- 
tinguished at a distance by its less tufted growth, brighter foliage, 
and larger flowers.
Cladium mariscus and Genista pilosa might have 
been added to the rarities flowering in August.
Orobanche rubra 
was remarkably abundant this year, especially on the sand-hills at 
Kennuck Cove; it withers in July.
Thalictrura flavum formerly 
grew at this place, but I looked for it last June in vain.

tic, rocky glen, between Kennuck and the Lizard Cove, Ruscus acu-

leaius grows in great abundance, conspicuous in early spring for its 
bright crimson berries as large as clierries.
On the banks of the Looe Pool, in addition to the plants mentioned 
by Mr. Gibson, grow Pyrus torminalis, in a thicket near the sea, Lit- 
torella lacustris in several places, and Jungermannia pumila on the 
rocks under Degibna wood.
In this last spot Erica vagans seems 
quite at home: in the woods on the opposite side it has been planted.
Briza minor is common in the neighbourhood of Kelston, growing 
among wheat and barley, which it frequently outtops.
It is remark- 
able for shifting its place of growth, being found in abundance one 
season, and then entirely disappearing for many years.
Silene An- 
glica is a common corn-weed ; Linaria spuria not rare.
Elatine 
hexandra, when I first discovered it, now many years since, grew on 
the banks of the Looe Pool in several places ; where the soil was 
muddy and soft it attained its full size, but where the soil was gra- 
velly and drier it assumed a deep red tint, and grew in tufts less than 
a quarter of an inch high.
It will always give me pleasure to direct any readers of the ' Phy- 
tologist' to the exact localities of these plants, if they are ever tempt- 
ed to botanize over this remote district, reserving to myself the right 
of withholding information about those which are found only in small 
quantities from all travellers who collect for either of the " Societies 
for the Extermination of rare British Plants,"

BOTANICAL SOCIETY OF EDINBURGH.
Nov. 12th, 1846.
â€” Dr. Balfour, President, in the chair.
The following communications were read : â€” 
1. On the species of Glyceria by Mr. Fred.
Townsend, of Ilming- 
ton, Warwickshire.
In this paper the author gave full descriptions 
of Glyceria Jluitaus, Br,, G.
plicnta, Fries, and of a supposed new 
species found in Cambridgeshire and Warwickshire, which he proposes 
to name G.
hyhrida, and pointed out the distinctions by which they 
may be known from each other.
2. Dr. Balfour read a description oi Exogonium Purga, Benth., the 
true Jalap plant, and noticed some points connected with its medical 
history.
The jalap plant was for a long time referred to Convolvulus 
727 
Jalapa of Linnaeus and Willdenow, or Ipomcea macrorhiza of Mi- 
chaux, a native of Vera Cruz.
It has recently been proved, however, 
from various sources, to be the plant now under notice, which grows 
in the hill country near Jalapa, in Mexico, at a height of about 6000 
feet above the level of the sea.
The plant was first sent to the Edin- 
burgh Botanic Garden by Dr. Christison, who received it from Dr.
Coxe, of Philadelphia, and has flowered several times in a cold frame.
It belongs to the natural order Convolvulaceae.
The genus Exogo- 
viiini has been separated from Ipomcea by Choisy, on account of its 
exserted stamens.
Specimens of the recent plant were exhibited.
Dr.
B. also described Stenocarpas Cunninghaini of Hooker, and exhibited 
a fresh specimen in flower.
This plant has been long known in gar- 
dens under the name of Agnostus sinuaius.
It is a small evergreen 
tree, belonging to the natural order Proteaceae, sub-order Folliculares, 
and tribe Grevilleae.
It was found by Allan Cunningham on the banks 
of the Brisbane River, Moreton Bay, and is remarkable for its umbel- 
late inflorescence, and showy orange-scarlet flowers, with reflexed and 
sub-secund segments of the perianth.
The plant was first introduced 
into the Royal Gardens at Kew, whence it has been distributed over 
the kingdom.
It has flowered this season for the first time in 
Britain.
2. Remarks on a Pyrola found in Lancashire, by Mr. Kenyon.
Specimens of this plant, which is considered by its discoverer as a 
new species, and which he proposes to call P.
maritima.
in allusion 
to the localities in which it is generally found, were shown to the 
meeting.
It is nearly allied to P.
rotundifolia^ from which it may be 
distinguished by its size, the form and length of its sepals, and length 
of the stamens.
Some excellent botanists who have examined it, are 
of opinion that it is only a variety of that species.
Mr. Wra.
MTvor, of the Kew Gardens, sent specimens of an Oro- 
hanche, considered by him to be O.
liicornm, Braun, gathered on 
Epsom Downs ; also Hormospora niutahilis, from Studley, Yorkshire, 
and Thorea ramossissima, from the Thames, near Walton.
A series of beautiful photographic delineations of various forms of 
leaves, prepared by Mr. James Lumsdaine, jun., of Lathallan, Fife, was 
exhibited, and an account read of the process by which they were 
obtained.
There was also exhibited a collection of Ruhi from the Rev. A.
Bloxam, of Twycross, Leicestershire, containing some new species 
and varieties.
Framed Portraits of the late professor Graham, Sir Wm. Hooker, 
728 
Robert Brown, Esq., and Dr. Neill, were presented to the Society from 
Mrs. Graham.
Mr. James Davies presented excellent dried specimens of 20 species 
of Agarics, collected by himself in the neighbourhood of Edinburgh.
The following donations to the Library and Museum were an- 
nounced as having been received since last meeting, viz.

Notice of ' Tlie Potato Plants its Uses and Properties : together 
with the Cause of the present Malady.
TJie extension of that 
disease to other Plants, the question of Famine arising there- 
from, and the best means of averting that Calamity.'' By 
Alfred Smee, F.R.S., Surgeon to the Bank of England.
Longman : London, 1846.
We have rarely read a book with such unmingled satisfaction as 
that published under the title which we have given above.
We can- 
not check the smile that returns to our physiognomy as often as we 
peruse any of its profound aphorisms.
Those of our contemporaries 
who have noticed this brochure, appear to have entirely misunder- 
stood its object, which we take to be that of burlesquing the solemn, 
vapid nonsense wuth which the press has lately teemed on the sub- 
ject of the potato.
The entire work is written with the most inimi- 
table skill, even when you have discovered the author's gist, you 
cannot avoid being led away by the solemn vraisemblance of his 
style.
The 'Surgeon to the Bank of England' thus announces, with 
infinite naivete, his qualification for the self-imposed task.
" It fre- 
quently happens that I have to traverse London in two or even more 
directions in a single day, which circumstance has given me abun- 
dant opportunities of making my observations in different localities." 
â€” p.
11.
There is an exquisite keenness in this, under which not 
only the Commissioner but the Essayist must writhe in agony ; 
729 
for they have penned assertions quite as ludicrous as saying that a 
daily journey from Norton Folgate to the Mint, and from St. Giles 
to Rosemary Lane, qualifies a man to write on the potato-disease.
The microscope and its parts, at page 13, would do honour to 
'Punch:' A, the foot, B, the pillar, C, the brass arm, &c., &c.
; we 
venerate that microscope ; we possessed just such an one before our 
beloved parents clothed us in that peculiar, bifurcate garb which in 
this country distinguishes the sexes.
The figure of the potato plant 
at page 17, is equally delicious, and so is the following excellent 
aphorism : â€” 
" In consequence of the set being usually below the ground, and 
the shoots having a tendency to grow towards the light, part must be 
below the earth's surface whilst the other part extends upwards and 
expands its foliage to the atmosphere." â€” p.
18.
Commissioners should have the following reprinted in gold : â€” 
" Potatoes can be cooked either by boiling, steaming, baking or 
frying, the only point requiring attention being the application of the 
heat, which should be managed in such a manner that all part may 
be cooked equally, and not one part overdone before the other is 
warm." â€” p.
39.
The fumbling and cross-reasoning of the various writers is admi- 
rably hit off by our witty author, a curious example of which we 
shall give below.
It is, however, due to Mr. Smee previously to state 
that he charges the potato-disease to the account of a small insect, 
the Aphis rapae of entomologists, to whom he very properly apolo- 
gizes for giving it a new name, " the vastator." 
" The vastator begins at the larger leaves of the potato plant, 
which, after a short time, becoming injured by the abstraction of the 
sap, die either partially or entirely.
In this case the insect follows 
up the leaves till only a few on the top of the plant are left.
" This operation is not going on in one plant alone; it is generally 
progressing in every plant in the field at the same time, leaf by leaf 
all dying, &c.
â€” p.
87.
We are then instructed how the abstraction of the sap causes the 
disease : and after the subject has been treated with the most elabo- 
rate prolixity we are refreshed by the assurance that the vastator 
cannot live " upon a very vigorous plant, because it would be drown- 
ed by the water transpired at night." â€” p.
133.
This bit of nonsense 
is really matched by much that has been previously published, and 
is no caricature.
We are then told that the vastator commences 
upon leaves which have lost their vigour.
" On placing insects upon 
730 
the new leaves of very vigorous plants, I have observed that the crea- 
ture has always been obliged to leave them." â€” p.
134.
In one place the vaslator "lives upon the juices of the plant," 
then, again, " the solid portion is taken away by the insect." 
At pages 19 and 20 we have the physiology of the potato treated 
in the true essay-writer style, and at pages 132 and 133 we have 
another version of the same subject, but both are so quaint, so dry, 
so inimitably serious, that the drift of the writer is concealed in the 
delicious ambiguity of his paragraphs, and we honestly confess our- 
selves to have been his dupes whilst we were reading the earlier 
chapters and verses.
Several species of Aphis or plant louse do really infest the potato, 
but none of them in any abundance, or to an excess that can possibly 
do the plant an injury: and it is a subject worthy the attention of 
cultivators that those plants in wdiich the plague-spots of the disease 
make their appearance, arc remarkably free from Aphides or other 
insects, a circumstance which would go far to show that the disease 
which is so injurious to the plant is equally inimical to its natural 
parasites.
There is an inscrutable intimacy between plants and their 
insect parasites that is well worthy the attention of the instructed 
naturalist: it opens up a wild field for observation, and one which 
we cordially recommend to our readers : we need scarcely assure 
them that the Aphis rapa?
has nothing whatever to do with the dis- 
ease in question.
Indeed, it is by proposing so very ridiculous 
an explanation of the evil, as it were out-Heroding Herod, that the 
author throws his withering sarcasm over the lucubrations of the 
essayists.
We wish that every idle fashion could find a Smee to bring it into 
ridicule : we are convinced that the shafts of satire penetrate much 
farther than those of argument, and we trust that an end will now be 
put to the frivolous pamphleteering about the poor potato.
If this 
happy consummation be achieved by the keen pen that has laid 
waste the mass of rubbish written on the subject, we shall be glad to 
transfer the name of "vastator" from the innocent Aphis to its ta- 
lented biographer.
We may, however, remark that Mr. Smee has selected a rather ex- 
pensive way of accomplishing his object : on future occasions we 
should recommend his publishing through the medium of our respect- 
ed contemporary, ' Punch,' whose columns are ever open to well-in- 
tended satire.

Notice of" Travels in Lycia, Milyas, and the Cibyratis, in company 
with the late Rei\ E.
T. DanielV By Lieutenant T.
A. B.
Spratt, R.N., F.G.S., of the Mediterranean Hydrogi-aphical 
Survey; and Professor Edward Forbes, F.R.S., of King's 
College, London, and tlie Geographical Survey; late Naturalist 
to H.M. Surveying Ship Beacon.
2 vols.
Van Voorst : Lon- 
don, 1847.
This work is one which has been looked for with considerable in- 
terest : Mr. Van Voorst has contrived to keep the promise of its 
appearance so skilfully before the public, that we have never been 
able to lose sight of it, and it is with pleasure we find that the pro- 
mise is now fulfilled.
We began to imagine the work congeneric 
with Mrs. Harris and Professor Forbes' ' Rambles of a Naturalist,' 
inviting shadows cast before by events that were to come, a character 
which they seem destined ever to maintain.
In this faith, however, 
we have met with a most agreeable disappointment.
The ' Travels 
in Lycia' are now before us, in two goodly tomes, illustrated by some 
of the best plans, and some of the worst views we have lately seen.
The plans are admirably drawn and engraved : the views may have 
been well drawn, but are so wretchedly executed in lithotint, that we 
could wish them anywhere but in the work which they disfigure.
The narrative is written in an easy, readable style, and is replete 
with valuable and interesting information.
We almost regret that 
the restricted scope of the ' Phy tologist ' precludes our quoting any 
portion of the first volume, which is by far the more agreeable of the 
two.
The second ti'eats almost exclusively of the Natural History of 
the journey : in the phytological portion we find much that is plea- 
sant, and quite worth transferring to our pages.
The Beacon arrived at Termessus in the first week in January, 
when but few plants were in flower, but three months previously 
Messrs.
Hoskyn and Forbes had landed at Kalamaki, near Patara, 
and found the hills and little sheltered bays around that port, thickly 
covered with woods of the strawberry-tree [Arhuiiis Unedo), then 
forming its fruit, while oaks, carobs, wild olives, figs, &c., united in 
constituting the arborescent vegetation of the coast.
Around the trees 
were thickets of storax.
Daphnes and myrtles of enormous size.
This gives one a very agreeable idea of the face of the country, and 
the more so that the writer has confined himself to a modest state- 
ment of the facts, unaccompanied by any rhapsodical panegyrics.
732 
On crossing the hills to the plain of Xanthus the wild pomegranate 
was observed abundantly and in fruit.
The rarest and most interesting plants met with in February were 
Saxifraga hederacea, which grows on moist roclis and among tombs, 
and Tulipa Sibthorpiana, the small, yellow blossoms of which are 
drooping, and not larger than those of our snowdrop.
The writer 
also observed that the leaves of specimens gathered at Moiri, where 
it grows among the thickets near the theatre, were much narrower 
than those represented in the 'Flora Graeca.' In March a large num- 
ber of the spring flowers had opened, and among them Asphodelus 
ramosus was very conspicuous.
Some common British plants were 
noticed, as Sonchus oleraceus, Saxifraga tridactylites, Stellaria nemo- 
rum and Cerastium vulgatum ; and our beautiful Ranunculus aquati- 
lis was in full bloom in the ponds among the marshes.
At Anliphillus 
the sea-side vegetation was in great luxuriance and full bloom : large 
bushes of Euphorbia dendroides covered the warm, rocky sL-pes of 
the hills, mingled with Styrax and Phillyrea latifolia, and several 
shrubby Labiatas of the genera Teucrium, Phlomis, Salvia and La- 
vandula scented the air with their fragrance.
The beautiful flowers 
of Ophrys speculum seemed as i^ each was a little mirror of ultrama- 
rine glass, framed in a fringe of crimson velvet.
Orchis longicornis 
grew in great abundance on the hills near Cassabar, and it is chiefly 
from the roots of this species that salep is made.
The high plain on 
which the cities called Cyanse formerly stood produced such abun- 
dance of Veronica grandiflora as to render the fields completely blue, 
and induced the writer to query whether this circumstance had not 
given rise to the name.
We must, however, pass over many interesting pages in order to 
quote at length the passage which contains a summary of Lycian 
vegetation, which we feel sure will be read with interest by all our 
subscribers.
" The surface of the country consists of plains and deep valleys, 
bounding or leading from the sea, and of high mountains, with steep 
forest-clad sea-ward slopes, walling in alpine plains, mostly bare and 
ti'eeless, except around the villages.
These topographical features 
indicate as many botanical regions.
The first includes the great 
maritime plains and valle^^s â€” the vegetation from the edge of the sea 
to an elevation of about fifteen hundred feet.
The second includes 
the mountain-slopes towards the sea, from an elevation of fifteen hun- 
dred to nearly three thousand feet, and the yailahs or highland valleys 
which open out seawards.
The third is the great inland regioii of sub- 
733 
alpine plains â€” the true yailahs, the inhabited parts of the table-land of 
Asia Minor, elevated from three, to five thousand five hundred, feet 
above the sea, and in some places presenting an uniform vegetation to 
a greater height.
A fourth botanical region of elevation is presented 
by the mountain peaks and ranges, elevated from six to ten thousand 
feet above the level of the sea, which rise out of the table-lands and 
wall them in.
We shall now attempt to sketch the principal botani- 
cal features of these several regions.
" I.
Region of the maritime plains and valleys.
The vegetation 
of this region is that characteristic of all the mediterranean shores.
The majority of plants which flower on the Lycian shores and mari- 
time plains, may be met with from Spain to Asia.
Oaks, oriental 
planes, and peculiar pines constitute its forests ; Leguminos(B, La- 
biatcB, Crucifera, Caryophyllacece, LiliacedB, and IridecB, make up its 
herbaceous vegetation.
In Lycia, the low hills of this region are 
covered with myrtle.
Arbutus, Daphne, Phlomis, Styrax, Cisiiis and 
Lentisk ; the Elceagnus, the Oleander, the Chaste- tree, and Colutea, 
are the shrubs which are most conspicious on the borders of the 
plains ; the fences are constructed of Christ-thorn fPaliurus echi- 
natusj ; in the neighbourhood of the sandy shores grow Passerina and 
Ruscus : the waste ground is studded with bushes of Juniper (Juni- 
perus Phd^nicea), spiny burnet f Poterinm spinosumj, spiny cichory 
(Cichorium spinosumj, and Lithospermum hispidulum ; on the rocks 
by the sea-side, great bushes of tree spurge (Euphorbia dendroidesj 
are mingled with more humble but more gaily flowering shrubby 
knots of variously coloured knapweeds ( CentaureaJ, and everlastings 
( Helichrysum ) .
These extend up the hill-sides, and mingle with 
shrubby Labiat<B.
In waste places the Ricinus grows, and the gor- 
geous dragon Arum.
Along the marshes the great reed (Arundo Do- 
nax), flourishes in miniature forests, and is often used to fence the 
fields on the alluvial plains.
The damper parts are covered in au- 
tumn by the tall golden-flowered Astericus aquaticus.
"The wild olive covers the hills, wherever the Pine (Pinus mariti- 
mus and halepensis) and the Arbutus leave room.
The balanea oaks 
(Qnercus ballota, aeyilops, and infecloria), afford ample shade.
The 
mastic, the fig, and the mulberry are not unfrequent, both cultivated 
and wild.
The oriental planes afford abundant shade near every vil- 
lage, and the dark and towering cypress is planted by the place of 
burial, but grows wild in the ravines.
The pomegranate flourishes in 
great abundance, and its wild fruit supplies a grateful refreshment un- 
der the warm sun of autumn.
The almond and manna-ash grow wild

among the rocks, and the bay and Judas-tree in the ravines.
The 
orange and the lemon are cultivated.
Melons, cucumbers, sesame, 
maize, cotton, capsicum, lentils, kidney-beans and balmias (Hibiscus 
esculenius) are the common cultivated vegetables.
" The wild herbs of the low country are many and varied.
The 
sandy sea-shore abounds in species of Medicago, among which the 
hoary foliage and yellow flowers of Medicago littornlis, and the Lotus 
creticus, are conspicious.
Also the horned poppy (Glaucium luteuwj, 
the Hypecoum, and the purple flowers of Malcomia.
The weeds of 
cultivated lands and waste grounds are those of the south of Europe, 
and among them the spurting cucumber (Momordica elaterimnj, 
the Acanthus, and the Tribulus, especially attract our attention.
The 
green sward at one season is gay with anemonies, at another with 
many species of ranunculus.
Numerous curious kinds of Orchis and 
Ophrys, musk-hyacinths, asphodels and star of Bethlehem adorn the 
plains, and everywhere are prickly but gaily flowering herbs of the 
genera Echiuni, Lycopsis, Lithospermum, and Anchma among the 
Borage tribe, and Echinops, and Carthamus among the thistles.
" Plants curious rather for aspect than for beauty, as Lapsana stel- 
lata, Hedypnois rhayadioloides, Salvia horininuni, Ziziphora capi- 
tata, Hymcnocarpus circinatus, Trigonella, Biserrnla, Andracline, 
and Arisfolochia, arrest the attention of the botanist at every turn.
" By the sea-shore, in many places, kinds of Staiice abound.
The 
most beautiful is the Statice sinuatum, which covers the interstices of 
bare and waste rocks, with its handsome lilac flowers and wavy foliage, 
the more pleasant to look upon, since in early summer, except some 
bushy and ugly though strongly scented Labiatce, there is little else 
of verdure to attract the eye in such places.
" II.
Region of mountain-slopes and sea-ward uplands.
This is 
the chief realm of the oak and pine-forests, for which Karamania is 
famous.
It is botanically a region of transition, wherein the flora of 
the sun-burnt lo\^â– lands is mingled with more temperate forms, and 
with the characteristic plants of the table land of Asia Minor.
It 
abounds in species of broom, and other shrubby Leguminosce, among 
which, Anagyrisfcetida is especially conspicuous, and sure to attract the 
attention of the traveller when loaded with its singular inflated pods.
The dwarf holly-oak (Quercus coccifera) is abundant everywhere.
The Salep orchis abounds.
The walnut is the most plentiful and con- 
spicuous tree around the villages.
Vineyards and tobacco fields yield 
rich produce in this zone.
Many common British herbs attract atten- 
tion here â€” the primrose, the pimpernel, the dog-violet, the pansy, 
735 
and the self-heal.
Every where the Lamium maculatum, is plentiful.
Such ferns as do occur, are chiefly found here.
Maples are frequent, 
as are also willows, chaste-trees, the Rhus cotimis, and the tamarisk.
The carob is common here as well as in the lowlands.
" III.
Region of the yailahs or mountain table-lands.
The yailahs 
of Almalee, three thousand six hundred feet above the sea, of Seyde- 
leer four thousand, of Cibyra three thousand five hundred, and of 
Stenez three thousand three hundred, furnished us with oiu* chief col- 
lections from this region.
They are very even and apparently flat, 
though really sloping plains, each watered by a stream, and either conti- 
nually or for a portion of the year presenting a lake at the lower ex- 
tremity.
They have no outlets.
The centre of the plain is bare and 
treeless, except near the villages, which are surrounded by walnut 
trees, Lombardy poplars, apples, apricots and pollard willows.
Planes are comparatively scarce.
In some of the warmer and less 
elevated yailahs, large oaks and elms are met with, but the forest belt 
which margins them is commonly of pines.
Thickets of Quercus 
eoccifera, Berberry and yellow jasmine, cover the waste and rocky 
grounds near their edges.
The vine is grown on the plains of 
Almalee and Saideleer, and good grapes for eating are produced.
Much corn is cultivated on the yailahs.
In cultivated grounds the 
common weeds are Alliaria officinalis, Asperugo procnmhens, Sisym- 
brium Sophia, Malope malacoides, Erysiinum officinale, Hypecoum, 
Lamium moschatum, Scandix aust rails, Contaurea cyanus, Fumaria 
parvijlora, and species of Bupleurum.
The more characteristic herbs 
are Geranium tuberosum, Androsace maxima, Scutellaria orientalis, 
Euphorbia rigida, Lithospermum orientale, a yellow Galium and 
species of Cerinthe, Onosma, Arethusa, Cynoglossum, Myosotis and 
Echinospermum.
Many curious forms of Composite and CruciferaB, 
also occur.
Crucifercs, Boraginece, Composited and CaryophyllecB, 
out-number all other orders in the yailahs.
" Region IV.
Above the yailahs, and bounding them, is the region 
of mountain peaks.
These reach to various heights from six to ten 
thousand feet, and are bare and treeless^towards their summits.
The 
snow rests in crevices throughout the year, and during winter and 
spring, forms extensive and conspicious masses.
Below the snow, 
the pale yellow and bare limestone is speckled here and there by the 
gloomy foliage of the Juniperus excelsa, a clumpy and cedar-like tree, 
which becomes more abundant as we descend, until at between six and 
eight thousand feet, it forms a dark zone round the mountain and again 
diminishes to give place to pines.
It is the tree called ' cedar ' by 
736 
travellers in Asia Minor.
Near the snow and above the jumpers, al- 
pine fritillaries and violets, Fumaria rut(BfoUa, Scilla hifolia, Draba 
aizoides, Achillea umbellata, Crocus nivalis, Anemone Appennina, 
and some species of Gagea, Ornithogalum, Veronica, Alyssmn and 
Draha are the characteristic plants.
Where the snow occupies 
crevices considerably lower down, these plants may be often found 
gi'owing beside it.
In the belt of cedar-juniper, and towards its upper 
part, grow species of Gnaplialium, Campanula, Cerinthe, Sideritis, 
Alchemilla, Scorzonera and Santolina, with which, we do not meet 
lower down.
Here are also Pruniis prostrata, Ernodea alpina, Digi- 
talis ferruginea, Auhrietia delloidea, and peculiar species of Aretia, 
Colchiciim and Crocus.
" Throughout our journeys we paid careful attention to the relations 
of the distribution of the indigenous plants to the soil in which they 
grew.
The simple features of the geology of Lycia and the constancy 
of mineral character of the various rocks over considerable tracts of 
country enabled us to do this with facility and precision.
Whilst 
each of the several regions into which we have attempted to divide the 
vegetation of Lycia considered as to its vertical distribution, presented 
a general character of its own, that character, was locally varied, ac- 
cording as the foundation rock was the hard appennine limestone, the 
sandy rocks which cap it, the soft tertiary marls and conglomerates, 
or the brittle and barren serpentine, the only igneous rock in this part 
of Asia Minor which occupies sufficient space to affect the flora.
" At almost any distance we could distinguish the serpentine from 
the limestone country, not merely from the peculiar bossy character 
and pink colour of the hills of the former, contrasting strongly with 
the abrupt and broken escarpments and gray and yellow rocks of the 
latter, but also from the disposition of the arborescent vegetation.
On the serpentine usually pines only grew, and never in thick forest 
masses, but scattered, as it were individually, and as if they had been 
planted in a quincunx arrangement.
Where the limestone was 
wooded, and in many parts it bore great forests, thick clustered oaks 
covered a luxuriant underwood, interupted by groves of strawberry 
trees, and by clumps of lofty pines.
High in the mountains the pines 
prevailed over the oaks, and higher still, the cedar-junipers replaced 
them.
In the region of the upland slopes, much of the mountain 
sides consist of greenish sandstones, probably intermediate in age 
between the secondary and the distinctly tertiary rocks.
These wei*e 
usually covered with dense forests, consisting exclusively of pines, 
though on the neighbouring limestone, the oak was the prevailing tree.
737 
"The contrast between the vegetation of the limestone and the ser- 
pentine, was maintained equally in the yailahs and among the higher 
mountains, and in the low country near the sea.
In the latter we 
found the sepentine in spring always indicated by the presence of 
Senecio squalidus; a conspicious little Erophila, and the fern Chei- 
lanthes odora, which occupied the place taken by the Acrostichum 
lanuginosuvi on the limestone.
Peculiar ^T^ecie^ oi Alyssum also dis- 
tinguished the herbage of the two rocks.
" In order to establish a comparison between the vegetation of the 
serpentine and the limestone in the mountain region, two points were 
selected, the one an isolated hill of serpentine, near Balbura, rising 
about six hundred feet out of a plain, four thousand seven hundred 
feet above the sea ; and the other, that portion of the peak of Cragus 
corresponding in elevation.
Every plant in flower was gathered on 
each station, and such trees as were present noted.
Both localities 
were equally bare and rocky, and the herbaceous vegetation on each 
consisted of little patches of plants growing in crevices of the rocks, 
and was remarkable for presenting scarcely any grasses among the 
species composing it.
" On the serpentine at the Balbura station, we gathered forty-eight 
species.
They belonged to the following genera : â€” 
Ranunculus, 1 
Alyssuiu, 1 (peculiar) 
Thlaspi, 1 
Aienaiia, 1 (peculiar) 
Stellaria, 1

A single grass and u feru 
(Cheilanthes).
"On the limestone station at Cragus we gathered forty-three species.
They belonged to the following genera : â€” 
Ranunculus, 2 
Aubrietia, 1 
Matthiola, 1 
Thlaspi, I 
Brassica, 1 
Draba, 2

Prunus, 1 Acer, 1 Myogalum, 1 
Umbelliferous plantin bud, 1 Juniperus, 1 And two grasses.
Cerastium, 2 (different from 
those at Balbura) 
" The vegetation of the tertiary plains and hills is similar to that of 
the softer and more chalky portions of the limestone.
On them the 
species of Ophrys are most abundant.
The plants of the travertine 
plain of Pamphylia are 'those of the neighbouring limestone.
The 
more recent calcareous formations, both soft and hard, however, do 
not bear the luxuriant arborescent vegetation which flourishes on the 
older.
The sandy plains near the sea, and those of alluvial origin, 
are inhabited by many species not found elsewhere ; these we have 
already noted when describing the succession of plants observed 
during our journey in spring.
" The sea- weeds of the Lycian shores are those of the rest of the 
iEgean.
Along the coast line Pardina pavonia and Dictyota dicJio- 
toma are abundant.
Deeper, and usually on muddy ground, to a 
depth of several fathoms, grow the vivid green and elegant fronds of 
Caulerpa prolifera, which, when enumerating the fishes, we have 
shewn to have probably been the sea plant called Prasium by the 
ancients.
The curious sponge-like Codium hursa, the Sargassum 
salicifoliutn, species of Cystoseira and Sporochnus, Haliseris poly- 
podioides, and Dictyomenia voluhilis, may be taken along with the 
Caulerpa.
The Dictyomenia, conspicious on account of its stiff cork- 
screw-like purple fronds, has a great range in depth, since we dredged 
it even in fifty fathoms of water, associated with Ritiphhea tinctoria 
and Chrysimenia uvaria.
Codium Jlahelliforme ocurred at the en- 
trance of the gulf of Macri in thirty fathoms, associated with that rare 
and curious vegetable net, the Microdictyon umhilicatwn.
Below 
fifty fathoms no flexible sea-weeds were observed.
The coral-like 
Millepora polymorpha took their places, and ranged even as deep as 
one hundred fathoms.
Beyond that depth we found no traces of 
vegetable life, unless some of the minute and microscopic infusorial 
bodies there living be regarded as plants." â€” Vol. ii.
p. 150.
In concluding our brief notice of these volumes we must again in- 
vite attention to the extreme beauty of the engravings which exhibit 
739 
the sites and plans of cities and also to the very elaborately finished 
map at the end of the second volume.
We heartily wish the work 
may meet with a speedy sale and that the views in future editions may 
be produced in any other garb than the doleful one in which they now 
appear.
We see the style has been patented : we sincerely hope that 
no pirate will even infringe on the rights of the patentee.

BOTANICAL SOCIETY OF LONDON.
November 30, 1846.
â€” Tenth Anniversary Meeting; J.
E. Gray, 
pjsq., F.R.S., &c., President, in the chair.
The Secelary read the Annual Report of the Council from which it 
appeared that 27 new members had been elected since the last anni- 
versary, and that the Society now consisted of 201 members.
Many 
thousands of specimens of British and Foreign plants had been re- 
ceived, and much exertion had been used by the Herbarium Committee 
to obtain the rarer British plants, which had been attended with suc- 
cess, valuable and interesting specimens (including many duplicates) 
having been received, and which would shortly be distributed to the 
members.
The Report was unanimously adopted.
A Ballot then 
took place for the Council for the ensuing year, when the President 
was re-elected, and he nominated John Miers, Esq., F.R.S., and Ed- 
ward Doubleday, Esq., F.L.S., Vice-Presidents.
Mr. J.
Woollett, Mr.
G. Cooper and Mr. James Rich, were elected new members of the 
Council in the room of Dr. Bossey, Mr. J.

BOTANICAL SOCIETY OF EDINBURGH 
December 10, 1846.
â€” Professor Balfour, President, in the chair.
The following donations were announced, viz.
Scottish Alpine 
plants from Dr. Balfour; Cryptogamic plants, chiefly Fungi, from M.
Kretschmar, Sonnevvalde, â€” this collection contained about 2500 
specimens most beautifully preserved ; German plants from Major de 
740 
Gansauge, Berlin ; and specimens from the south of Fiance, from M.
Barneoud, Paris.
The following gentlemen were admitted Fellows of the Society, 
viz : â€” John Robertson Esq., 7, Torphichen Street ; James Lumsdaine, 
Esq., 15, Dundas Street; Archibald Douglas, M.D., F.R.C.S., 61, 
Northumberland Street; and John Marshall Jun., Esq., 9, Fettes

Shrewsbury, non-resident ; and Ph. Wirtgen, Coblentz ; Mr. J.
Zohr, 
Trier; Dr Molkenboer, Leyden ; Dr Carl Heinrich Schultz, Zwei- 
brucken, were elected foreign members.
A letter was read from M.
Lange and other Danish botanists, offer- 
ing to supply Scandinavian specimens in exchange for ikitish; and 
transmitting a catalogue of the Danish Flora, with the regulations of 
the Scandinavian Association for the exchange of Botanical speci- 
mens.
In the list there are 1285 Phanerogamous species enumerated, 
263 of which are not found in Britain ; and 39 species of Ferns, of 
which six are not British.
The following communications were read : â€” 
1. Dr Balfour read an account of a botanical trip which he had 
made with some of his pupils to CI ova, Glen Isla, and Braemar, in 
August last.
Dr B.
alluded in an especial manner to the alpine 
Flora of the British Isles, the Scandinavian type of Professor E.
Forbes ; and illustrated it by a complete series of specimens, arranged 
according to the Natural System on pasteboard, so as to be seen at one 
view.
He noticed Professor Forbes' theory, as to the mode in which 
the plants migrated at the Glacial Epoch.
He also alluded to the 
geological nature of the district visited, which is the richest in Britain 
as regards alpine species, and the character of the Flora on the dif- 
ferent kinds of primary rocks, especially granite and mica-slate.
Specimens of the rarer species collected during the excursion were 
exhibited, among which the following are interesting as having been 
found in new localities, or re-discovered, in old ones : â€” Carex rupes- 
tris, abundant in Glen Dole, the specimens being unusually large ; 
Poa Balfourii, near the falls of the Whitewater, and also in Glen Isla, 
and on Lochnagar ; Poa coena, in Glen Isla ; Poa laxa, and the 
variety flexuosa, of Parnell, Lochnagar, and Glen Dole ; Luzula 
arcuata, Lochnagar; Saxifraga rivularis, in several new stations on 
Lochnagar, some specimens 6 inches long ; Gentiana nivalis in a new 
spot in Glen Isla, specimens varying from one 1 0th of an inch to 6 
inches in length ; Ranunculus acris, var.
pumilus, Wahl.
Lochnagar ; 
Phleum alpinum, rocks near Loch Brandy ; Carex vaginata, abundant

near the summit of Lochnagar; Woodsia hyperborea, rocks in Glen 
Phee ; Hieracium nigrescens, Ben na Muick Dhui; and H.

des, var.
latifolium of Fries, in Glen Clova.
Dr. Fleming expressed doubts as to the correctness of Professor 
Forbes's theory regarding the migration of the Scandinavian Flora, 
and noticed the evident depression of the land along the eastern coast 
of Scotland, from which he inferred that the level of the German 
Ocean must have been greatly altered, and was inclined to believe 
that the similarity of the Floras of this country, and of Norway and 
Sweden, might be accounted for by supposing thM these countries 
were at one time united to Britain.

H. Campbell, Deme-

He described the petioles

Unfortunately, neither the Victoria nor Hiarry plant was 
in flower.
The latter is being analyzed by Dr. Sheer, the agricultu-

Dr. Douglas Maclagan stated that he had already made an analysis 
of the Hiarry root, and had detected a peculiar volatile acid, to 
which he believed the poisonous properties of the plant were due.

Panegyric on Mr. M'Alla and other Irish Botanists.* By Charles 
Farran, M.D., Honorary Fellow of King and Queen's College 
of Physicians, Ireland.
It was with feelings of great regret I lately read in the May num- 
ber of the ' Phy tologist ' a paper entitled "Botanical Rambles in 
Ireland," by Charles Carter, Esq. It contains, within a very narrow 
space, a number of inaccuracies, I am confident committed inadver- 
tently by the writer, and I am free to confess that the ignorance of 
the facts connected with the subject to which he refers (and to which 
I am now about to advert) is so very apparent, that it completely 
exonerates the writer from wiliiil misrepresentation.
Thus, for in- 
stance, in the second paragraph of his Rambles he states " that being 
in Clifden (Galway) he had heard of Mr. Ogilby, as an accomplished 
naturalist and botanist, being there.
He had discovered another 
station for the beautiful Erica Mackaii, a lieath admired by all, but 
which that gentleman (who originally found it) I am informed now 
considers to be a mere form of the more common species," I am not 
going to quarrel with the assertion that Mr. Ogilby is an accomplish- 
ed botanist : that he is one of the most successful cultivators of the 
rarer native plants is with one general consent acceded to him ; and 
no one has viewed his fine collection with feelings of more intense 
pleasure than myself, but giving him all the credit he deserves on 
this head, and in addition, that he has discovered a second locality 
for this beautiful heath, I must most emphatically deny his having 
the slightest right, or the shadow of a claim, to be considered the dis- 
coverer of this splendid addition to the Flora of Ireland.
The facts connected with the discovery of this heath present a la- 
mentable instance of men of science reaping where they had not 
sown, enjoying a golden harvest of honours, wearing laurels (perhaps 
heaths) they never won, from the unrequited labours of an humble 
individual, and thus totally excluding the discoverer from any parti- 
cipation in the credit justly due to him for his great discrimination.
I shall now give you.
Sir, the correct account of the discovery as I 
* We feel at a loss to give a projser heading to this article, hut think the ahove 
most appropriate.
Messrs.
M'Alla, .Scouler and Litton being still, we trust, in the 
land of the living-, we at first regarded the inflates terms of their panegyrist as rather 
objectionable ; but our neighbours of the " Green Is^e" are accustomed to use strong- 
er terms than we more phlegmatic English: and therefore the necessary allowance 
will be made by all our readers.
We have long 1 eeii acquainted with Mr. M'Alla's 
deserved reputation, and our best wishes attend him in all his researches.
i 743 
had it from Mr. William M'Alla, to whom alone the merit belongs.
He says, that being engaged some eight or nine years ago m procur- 
ing litter for his father's cattle, he selected a spot where a heath less 
robust than Erica cinerea, and consequently better adapted for that 
purpose, grew abundantly.
When thus engaged he perceived some 
peculiarity in its structure which struck him as singular.
He at once 
compared it with E.
tetralix, and the result of that examination con- 
firmed him in his opinion.
He immediately ceased pulling it, and 
accurately marking the locality, waited with somewhat of impatience 
the season of its blossoming.
It so happened that Mr. Babington, 
accompanied by Mr. J.
Ball, of Dublin, visited Connemara the follow- 
ing summer, and having spent some days in that delightful country, 
were about leaving it (literally being on the car), vs^hen Mr. M'Alla 
asked Mr. Babington would he wish to see a new heath.
He thought 
Mr. M'Alla was passing a jest on him, but in this he was quickly un- 
deceived ; for Mr. M'Alla brought him to the spot where it presented 
its beauteous blossoms in wild luxuriance.
I need scarcely attempt 
to describe the delight expressed by Mr. Babington, who, taking 
away some specimens, exhibited them to Mr. Mackay on his arrival 
in town, and subsequently named the heath after that gentleman.
Now whether Mr. Babington, in taking this step, acted with that 
strict sense of justice to the discoverer, his own mind will best inform 
him.
But for my own part I do not hesitate to say, that I cannot but 
look on it as an act of the greatest injustice ; and I think it would 
have reflected greater brilliancy on Mr. Mackay's high reputation if 
he had rejected the compliment and bestowed the honour on him 
who had so richly deserved it.
However, the Horticultural Society 
of Ireland, in a proper spirit, awarded a silver medal to Mr. M'Alla 
for this and several other additions made to the Flora of Ireland by 
him, thus recognizing, at that early period, his undoubted right to 
the honour of having discovered the plant.
Having thus demonstrated the inaccuracy of the commencement, 
Mr. Carter continues and finishes his sentence by saying, " and his 
views are concurred in by his friend, the Professor of Botany in the 
Royal Dublin Society, one of the first indigenous botanists in Ire- 
land." This finishing part of the sentence contains no less than 
three additional inaccuracies.
I am most strongly inclined to think 
that the gentleman designated (as his Mr. Ogilby's friend) the Pro- 
fessor of Botany in the Royal Dublin Society, is Mr. David Moore, 
Curator of the Botanic Gardens at Glasnevin, and not Professor of 
Botany to the Royal Dublin Society (and may the time be far distant 
744 
when the opportunity shall occur of his being so), that chair being 
most ably filled at present by Doctor Samuel Litton, a gentleman so 
imiversally known for his profound acquirements in the varied 
branches of science that he obtained the name of " the scholar'''' from 
the late Dr. Magee, Archbishop of Dublin (no mean authority on such 
a subject), and whose lectures impart such a grace and dignity to the 
science of Botany.
1 think if his (the Professor's) opinion was re- 
quired as to Erica Mackaii being a mere form of the more common 
species, what species is that .^ that his reply would be, that if so 
Menziesia polifolia was only a mere form of Calluna vulgaris, a most 
unphilosophic and imbotanic induction.
As to Professor Dr. Litton 
being an indigenous botanist, I have been much puzzled in endeavour- 
ing to decipher the meaning of this expression.
If it means that Dr.
Litton is a native of this country, Mr. Carter is correct, Ireland is the 
country of his nativity, and I feel assured that no person is better ac- 
quainted with the Botany of it.
But if, in carrying out the mistake', 
Mr. Carter makes Mr. Moore indigenous to the soil of Ireland, he is 
very inaccurate, Mr. Moore being a Scotchman, and one who has 
earned, since his sojourn in the land, the reputation of being a sound 
botanist, but no more indigenous to the soil of Ireland than I am to 
that of Kamskatka.
I trust I have put this correction into a clear and intelligible form ; 
but I feel that I should not be doing justice either to Mr. Ogilby or 
to Mr. M'Alla if I withheld what in my own opinion is the probable 
origin of Mr. Carter's mistakes.
Mr. Ogilby, some years since, visit- 
ed Connemara, and during his botanical investigations had the good 
fortune to discover the Adiantum Capillus-Veneris, growing in a cal- 
careous seam which occurs in the hornblende rock (of which Urris- 
beg is composed, based on granite), certainly a most unlikely habitat 
for this interesting fern, and displays, in a most favourable manner, 
Mr. Ogilby's power of research as a botanist.
Now from the fact of 
Mr. M'Alla residing in the neighbourhood, and from his being able, 
from Mr. Ogilby showing him the locality, to send specimens of the 
fern to a number of botanists, it was supposed that he had discovered 
it.
Even Mr. Newman, the author of the work on the British Ferns, 
falls into this mistake when describing the localities of the Adiantum 
in Ireland ; for he says, " and Mr. J.
M'Calla (it should be William), 
a most industrious and praiseworthy young botanist, residing in 
Roundstone, in Connemara, found a few plants at the foot of a rock 
facing south-west, on the banks of Lough Bulard, near Urrisbeg." 
But this erroneous opinion was rectified the very first opportunity, at 
745 
a meeting of the Dublin Natural History Society, by Mr. M'Alla un- 
reservedly stating that the merit of the discovery belonged exclusive- 
ly to Mr. Ogilby, and thus you perceive, Sir, by a species of metas- 
tasis, the credit due to Mr. Ogilby's discovery of the Adiantura was 
transferred to the heath of Mr. M'Alla's finding.
Having thus recti- 
fied the inaccuracies of Mr. Carter's " Botanical Rambles," I trust I 
shall be excused if I have in any way transgressed the fair limits of 
criticism, or for any warmth of expression which may have escaped 
from me, ascribing such to the indignation I feel at the treatment 
which this " young and praiseworthy botanist," I will add zoologist, 
has received at the hands of those who should have had "bowels of 
mercy and lovingkindness " towards him ; and combined with these 
the admiration I entertain for his abilities, displayed in almost all the 
branches of Natural History, has compelled me to use it.
And now 
it may not be out of place to say a few words in respect to Mr.
M'Alla : they may be useful to those, who, like him, have an ardent 
thirst for knowledge, and labour under the difficulties which straiten- 
ed means invariably oppose to the acquirement of information.
At the period of Mr. Babington's and Mr. Ball's visit to Connemara 
he was a young man, poor and pennyless ; of this he need not be 
ashamed, it should be a source of honest pride to him ; but if this was 
the case, he was possessed of an indomitable zeal for Natural History, 
an intense love of the science, and indeed he required those assistants 
in the many and severe discouragements he met with in the prosecu- 
tion of his darling persuit.
And in none did he feel those discourage- 
ments more than in this transaction of the heath; finding by it that 
he was deprived of all participation in the merit of the discovery, 
aud one marked by a power of discrimination which falls to the lot of 
fesv botanists ; it was the first fair opportunity that had occurred in 
his course, the first gleam of sunshine, the first fulcrum by which he 
might have risen in public estimation, and thus been placed in a 
position favourable to the development of those talents he is so emi- 
nently gifted with.
These bright prospects being torn from him, was 
quite sufficient to crush the hopes, the very mind of a less ardent vo- 
tary than Mr. M'Alla.
But it was not so with him ; he has perse- 
vered in his noble course : and if it should be enquired of me, where 
and what is he now ?
I should answer, examine that lasting memorial 
of talent and research.
Doctor Johnston's work on the British Sponges 
and Corallines.
You will find him alluded to in almost every page 
of that capital work.
Again, take up Dr. Harvey's ' Phycologia 
Britannica, no terms can express the admiration in which that work is 
746 
held â€” you will find him mentioned in almost every page.
Look at the 
first volume of his own 'Algae Hibernicae.' Can anything exceed the 
beauty of his specimens ?
Read Doctor Harvey's eulogium in that 
volume.
Examine the splendid collection of Irish Zoophytes â€” sponges, 
Crustacea and Millepores, â€” made by him for the Museum of the Royal 
Dublin Society.
And not to occupy too much of your valuable space, 
hear what Doctor Scouler, the most acompUshed naturalist of the day 
[in the strictest sense of the word) says about him at a meeting of the 
Dublin Natural History Society, held on Wednesday 9th Deer.
1846, 
Dr. Scouler read a paper on some new species of Zoophytes ; among 
the first he mentioned was the Ophiurilla, a new and hitherto unde- 
scribed species from the west coast of Ireland, discovered last summer 
by Mr. M'Alla.
Dr. Scouler also entered into a very detailed history of a 
new genus of sponges discovered in Connemara about two years since, 
by the indefatigable industry of Mr. M'Alla, who, of all Irish natural- 
ists had been the most successful in detecting new and rare species of 
this curious family.
The new genus, to which Dr. Scouler gave the 
name of Amphitreraa M'Callai, was characterized by some very inter- 
esting particulars, which Doctor Scouler enumerated, and then pro- 
ceeded to advert to the number of Crustacea which Mr. M'Alla had 
added to the Fauna of Ireland, Thia polita, and Steuosoma acuminata, 
being amongst the number, and concluded by saying that he was 
equally successful in the Mollusca, and among other interesting species 
had discovered the Pholas clavata, a West Indian species of boring 
shell, recorded for the first time as Irish.
This is but a faint outline of Mr. M'Alla's researches, which have 
been crowned with such success.
I consider that in thus recording 
them, I am only doing an act of common justice, by removing any er- 
roneous impressions which may have arisen by Mr. Carter's inadvei*- 
tence in his Botanical Rambles.
I wish the task had fallen into more 
competent hands ; but I have endeavoured to do it honestly.

Remarks on the Ferns occurring at Lynmouth, North Devon.
By the Rev. W.
T. Bree, M.A.
" Multa peteiitibus 
Desunt multa.'' â€” Hor.
During a recent sojourn at Ilfracombe, North Devon, I took the 
opportunity, towards the end of October, of paying a two-days' visit 
to those romantic spots, Lynton and Lynmouth, about twenty miles 
distant from the former place.
The far-famed " Valley of Rocks " I 
confess somewhat disappointed me.
But nothing of the kind can 
surpass the beauty of the deep glens of the west and east Lyn, their 
steep sides richly clothed with wood, oak,* ash, birch, &c., and a 
deliciously limpid stream, bright as crystal, tumbling among the 
rocks in the bottom, and forming a succession of waterfalls and 
rapids in every variety of picturesque shape and beauty.
A land- 
scape painter might live here and work all his days, and die content- 
ed.
These rocky glens might seem to be the very seat of ferns ; and 
accordingly they grew there in the greatest profusion and luxuriance, 
â€” they enjoyed themselves.
There were large masses of Polypodiura 
vulgare, exceeding in extent all that I had ever seen before ; and the 
fronds, in many instances, were nearly the length of the umbrella I 
carried in my hand.
Polystichum aculeatumf (or as some might call 
it, angulare, or rather, both forms of the plant) grew in ihe greatest 
vigour, and of a gigantic size, as did also Scolopendrium vulgare, and 
some other species.
I feel very much disposed to trouble you with a 
list of the ferns I met with in this charming spot ; not that the list is 
at all a copious one, at least not for so favourable a locality, nor does 
it comprise anything that can be considered rare ; quite the contrary ; 
the list is short, and includes only the commoner species.
But my 
object is rather to show what I did not find, and yet should have 
fully expected would occur in this most suitable situation.
The list 
is as follows : â€” 
* Almost, if not entirely, all the oaks in this district are of the species Querciis 
sessiliflora.
t I confess I cannot see the propriety of making three species out of Polystichum 
aculeatum and lobatum, so well understood by Kay (see his Synopsis).
All the varie- 
ties of these very variable fems, as it appears to me, may readily be referred to one or 
other of the two species, aculeatum or lobatum.
Neither can I subscribe to the doc- 
trine, which I have heard broached, that "we must make three species, or sink them 
all to one." I almost think we might with as much propriety make four species as 
three.

Blechnum horeale.
Pteris aquilina 
Polypodium vulgare

Athyrium Filix-foemina 
var.
iiriguum 
Asplenium Adiantum-nigrum 
Ruta-muraria 
Trichomanes 
Scolopendrium vulgare.
Now with the exception of Athyrium Filix-fcemina, var.
irriguum, 
there is not in this list a single fern but what I have heretofore found 
wild in my own parish of AUesley, along with at least two other spe- 
cies besides.
To the above inconsiderable list of not uncommon 
species, 1 perhaps might be justified in adding Osmunda regalis; for 
true it is, I saw two separate plants of it growing in a healthy state 
near the stream in Sir W.
Herries's grounds, on the west Lyn ; but 
to my eye it was at once evident that these were not indigenous, but 
had been introduced by the hand of man ; and, what confirmed me 
in this opinion, not a single specimen besides was observed in any 
other part of either of the glens.
I have formerly seen this noble 
fern in South Devon, particularly at Dawlish, in great vigour; but I 
have not observed it anywhere during my late rambles in the north- 
ern parts of the county.
1 met with no species of Lycopodium in the 
Lynmouth glens ; though from information derived from one of the 
women who attend visiters with donkeys, I have no doubt that L.
clavatum at least, is found there, or in the neighbourhood.
I have 
stated already that Polystichum aculeaium grew in great abundance 
and luxuriance; but its near ally, P.
lobatum, does not occur at Lyn- 
mouth, so far as I observed.
This last fern, though by far the more 
common of the two species in our Warwickshire lanes in my own im- 
mediate neighbourhood, appears to be much less generally distributed 
than aculeatum and angulare.
Lastraea recurva {Newman) is a local 
species, and accordingly I was not surprised at the time by not find-- 
ing it in the glens of the West and East Lyn. Subsequently, how- 
ever, I have met with it rather sparingly in a valley called Chamber- 
combe, about a mile from Ilfracombe, and also more plentifully in 
749 
oue situation near Barnstaple, by the side of a small stream artifi- 
cially conducted to supply a paper mill, just two miles from the 
Ilfracombe road.
Devonshire, therefore, may be added as a new lo- 
cality (so far as I know) for this very beautiful, and, as it seems to 
me, distinct species.
Being, as it is, a native of the district, why it 
should not have taken up its quarters on the delightful banks of the 
Lyn, is a question on whicli I will not now hazard a conjecture ; but 
there I found it not ; and it is too conspicuous a plant to be readily 
passed over by any one on the look-out for ferns.
What surprised 
me most of all was the non-appearance of Cystopteris fragilis, and all 
its various forms, at Lynmouth, and, I may add, of Polypodium Dry- 
opteris and Phegopteris, and of Lycopodium Selaginoides.
The 
moss-grown rocks of Lynmouth, perpetually bedewed with the spray 
of the waterfalls, are just the very spots where one would look to find 
some species of Hyraenophyllum, or perhaps even â€” considering the 
mildness of the Devonshire climate â€” of Trichomanes.
I searched 
most diligently after H.
Wilsoni, but in vain, though the rocks seem- 
ed formed and placed on purpose for its growth.
The following, 
then, are the ferns which I should have expected to meet with at 
Lynmouth, but which, so far as my researches extended, do not ap- 
pear to grow there : â€” 
Cystopteris fragilis 
Polypodium Dryopteris 
Phegopteris 
Polystichum lohatum 
LastrtBd recurva 
Hymen ophyllum Wilsoni 
Lycopodium Selaginoides 
Osmunda regalis?
I avail myself of the present opportunity to state that I had the 
satisfaction, in October last, of seeing the elegant and rare Adiantum 
Capillus-Veneris, flourishing at large on the cliffs facing the sea near 
Rillidge point, about two miles from Ilfracombe.
And I am glad to 
be able to add that it is not very likely to be soon eradicated from the 
spot ; for the fern grows high up on the perpendicular side of the 
cliff, under the drip of a small watercourse, and the assistance of two 
men, with ladders, is required in order to approach it.
Accordingly 
it is out of the reach of wanton spoliation.
I had afterwards the fur- 
ther pleasure of finding small specimens of ' maiden's hair ' in another 
situation at no great distance, and gathering it with my own bands ; 
but from this last spot, which is more accessible, it has been almost 
Vol. II.

eradicated.
T may here state, for the benefit of botanists who visit 
Ilfraconibe and may wish to obtain the fern, that a young man 
of the name of John Cutlilfe, who resides at Heale, about a mile 
from Ilfracorabe, knows the plant, and where to find it, and is 
ready to procure it when required.
Of course he expects to be rea- 
sonably remunerated for his time and trouble, and, indeed, deserves 
to be so ; for it is a service attended with labour and some risk : the 
ladders required for the occasion have to be carried a mile, and con- 
veyed down the cliff by a very awkward, if not dangerous path, and 
afterwards over the rugged rocks on the shore.
J. Cutliffe and his 
father were both drenched to the skin in procuring the fern for me.
T have to apologize for these rambling remarks chiefly about what 
is not found in a particular locality of North Devon.
You are, of 
course, at full liberty to make any use of them for the pages of the 
' Phytologist,' or to reject them as you may think proper.
Tome, 
however, the subject is by no means without interest.

Occurrence of Lythrum lnjssopifolium near Manchester.
By R.
W. M'All, Esq.
Almost on the day of my return from a vain search, in which I 
believe I had been preceded by others, hapless as myself, on the in- 
viting banks of Trent, by rural Wilford, in sight of merry Nottingham, 
for the retiring and transitory hyssop-leaved loosestrife [Lythrum 
hyssopifoUum), said once to have flourished there, I was not a little 
surprised to meet the very object of my pursuit where T least expect- 
ed ii.
It had been gathered for me in the month of August, at Rus- 
holme, near this town, in a damp field, by a narrow watercourse, 
amidst the rush-clad clay beds, and close by the iron-railed enclosures 
which abound in our vicinity.
The specimens were few in number, 
but of average size and well developed.
Thsy grew in a retired cor- 
ner which, though within a short space of busy scenes, seemed to 
have been long undisturbed.
As the plant is rare and local, and par- 
ticularly infrequent in this part of England, it may be interesting to 
your readers to know that it belongs to the Flora of Manchester.
The 
751 
rude hand of innovation will, no doubt, soon obliterate the trace of 
the little wanderer; but its memory may thus be preserved from ob- 
livion.

very complicated movements, without our being able to discover the 
slightest trace of a nervous system.
" The cells of vegetables are contractile ; and exciting agents act 
upon them directly, without the intervention of any intermediate 
body.
The vascular tissue, being highly elastic, readily yields to 
the motion impressed on the cellular tissue.
" We may regard the cellular tissue of the sensitive plant as being 
erectile in its nature.
When it is in a state of active dilatation, the 
plant is turgid, and its leaves are spread out; when the tissue is in a 
contracted condition, the plant closes its leaflets and lowers its pe- 
tioles.
" In a state of active dilatation, the fluids of the plant fill the cells 
of the lower surfaces, and maintain them in a state of turgescence.
" In a state of contraclibility the fluids, being less abundant, leave 
the cells of the upper surfaces hanging down and pressing upon 
the lower surface.
" In this way we may explain the normal diurnal and nocturnal 
movements of the sensitive plant.
In the day time, when the plant 
is exposed to the light, the fluids are attracted towards the cuticle, 
and there maintain a constant equilibrium, the fresh supplies replac- 
ing those which had passed off" by evaporation.
If this equilibrium 
is interrupted by a touch, by cold, or by wounds, the circulation is 
disturbed ; the fluids suddenly abandon the cells of the upper sur- 
faces, dilate the vessels by the reaction, and a state of contractibility 
is the consequence.
" At the approach of evening, the fluids being less strongly propel- 
led towards the superior surfaces, a condensation of the tissues en- 
sues ; the plant contracts, and in the night the phenomenon attains 
its maximum of intensity, ceasing gradually at the return of day.
Darkness opposes no obstacle to the diurnal state of sleeping leaves : 
it even serves to maintain this state, and tends to keep the leaves 
displayed.
" When plants are placed in darkness, in a cool cellar, where the 
air is loaded witii humidity, their waking state may endure for many 
days.
" If plants in a waking state are suddenly shifted from warm to 
cool air, they assume their sleeping state, if there is a considerable 
difference in the temperature.
" If such plants are watered when in their waking state in a dark 
place, they immediately enter upon their sleeping state, which, how- 
ever, does not last long.
753 
" If such plants are brought, whilst they are awake, from the dark- 
ness of a cellar into the open air during the night, they slowly assume 
their sleeping state.
"In a warm cellar situated but little below the surface of the 
ground, or in a dry room from which the light is carefully excluded, 
the same events occur to such plants as if they were in a deep cellar, 
though less perfectly.
" Complete darkness neither increases nor diminishes the sensibi- 
lity of Mimosa pudica.
" Oxalis annua, the flowers of which, in the open air, open only 
towards the middle of the day, remains in flower both night and day 
in darkness.
"Porleria hygrometrica is insensible to the hygrometrical variations 
of the atmosphere, and assumes the condition of all the other sleep- 
ing plants, although it is much more excitable.
"We need not search among leguminous plants for such as most 
readily assume the sleeping condition ; for Phyllanthus cantoniensis 
and Porleria hygrometrica, one belonging to the Euphorbiacese and 
the other to the Rutaceae, ought to stand at the head of the list." 
The above conclusions may account for some of the phenomena of 
vegetable motions, but there are many others, even among the plants 
which M.
Fee has chosen for his experiments, that can in no wise be 
referred to this cause, which seems much less satisfactory than Du- 
trochet's theory of exosmose and endosmose, though in some measure 
approximating to it.
That theory clearly explains such phenomena 
as are exhibited by the ripe fruits of Momordica elaterium and Im- 
patiens ; and in the latter plant the ]ihenomena may be inverted by 
placing fresh valves of the fruit in sugar and water, which, by pro- 
ducing exosmosis, gradually straightens the curved valves and then 
curves them in an opposite direction.
But neither the theory of en- 
dosmosis, nor M.
Fee's modification, will account for the peculiar 
movements of the leaves in Hedysarura gyrans, in which, while the 
terminal leaflet is asleep, the two lateral leaflets are in continual mo- 
tion, even during the night.
That plants possess a system of organs somewhat analogous to the 
nervous system of animals, seems at least to be rendered probable by 
the results of experiments with various irritant and narcotic poisons, 
upon such plants as exhibit, under ordinary circumstances, any pe- 
754 
culiar evidences of irritability.
The researches and experiments of 
M. Marcet, Drs. Christison and Turner, and M.
Macaire, lead to this 
conclusion: the latter gentleman's experiments on the sensitive plant 
{Mimosa pudica) are so interesting, that they will bear repetition 
here, even though some of our readers may be already well acquaint- 
ed with them.
" Experiments were now made with this vegetable {Mimosa pu- 
dica).
When a leaf of this plant is cut, and allowed to fall on pure 
water, the leaflets generally contract rajndly ; but after a few mo- 
ments expand, and are then susceptible of contraction by the touch 
of any other body.
They may thus be preserved in a sensible state 
two or three days.
If the section be made with a very sharp instru- 
ment, and without concussion, the leaves may be separated without 
any contraction.
The branches of this plant may be preserved for 
several days in fresh water.
Gum-water also effects the same purpose.
" When a cut leaf of this plant falls upon a solution of corrosive 
sublimate, the leaf rapidly contracts, and the leaflets curl up in an 
unusual manner, and do not again expand.
When put into pure 
water, the sensibility does not return, but the whole remains stiff and 
immovable.
A little solution of corrosive sublimate being put into a 
portion of pure water, containing an expanded branch of the plant, 
gradually caused curling up of the leaves, which then closed and fell.
If the solution be very weak, the leaves open on the morrow, and are 
still sensible, but ultimately contract, twist, and remain stiff till they 
die.
Solutions of arsenic and arseniate of potash produce the same 
effects.
" A leaf of the sensitive plant was placed in a cold, diluted solution 
of opium: in a few moments it opened out as in water, and, after 
half an hour, gave the usual signs of contractibility.
In six hours it 
was expanded, and had a natural appearance, but could not be ex- 
cited to move.
The leaflets were flexible at the articulations, and 
offered a singular contrast to the state of irritation produced by cor- 
rosive sublimate.
Pure water did not recover the plant.
A large 
branch, similarly situated, expanded its leaves ; but in half an hour 
had lost much of its sensibility : the leaflets, though alive, seemed 
asleep, and required nuich stimulating to cause contraction.
In one 
hour the contractions ceased : in two hours the branch was dead.
" A leaf placed in Prussic acid (Scheele's strength) contracted, 
then slightly dilated, but was quite insensible, and the articulations 
were flexible : water did not recover it.
If the acid be very weak, 
the leaflets dilate and appear to live, but are insensible.
A drop of 
755 
the acid placed on two leaflets of a healthy plant gradually causes 
contraction of the other leaflets, pair by pair.
Solutions of opium 
and corrosive poisons have no effect when applied this way.
After 
some time they dilate, but are insensible to external irritation : the 
sensibility returns in about half an hour; but the leaflets appear as 
if benumbed.
" The plant exposed to the vapour of prussic acid is afliected in 
the same way : ammonia appears to favour tiie recovery of the plant.
"A cup containing dilute prussic acid was so placed that one or 
two leaves, or sometimes a branch, of a healthy plant could be plung- 
ed into the liquid, or left to repose on its surface.
The leaflets re- 
mained fresh and extended, but were almost immediately insensible.
Being left in this state for two hours, they were expanded ; and no 
irritation could cause their contraction, though otherwise there was 
no appearance of an unnatural state.
At five o'clock in the evening 
the leaves were left to themselves.
At nine o'clock they were open 
and insensible.
At midnight they were still open, whilst all the rest 
of the plant, and the neighbouring plants were depressed, contracted, 
and in the state of sleep.
On the morrow they resumed a little sen- 
sibility, but seemed benumbed.
" In the same manner M.
Macaire has interfered with other plants 
as to the state of sleep, and observes that prussic acid thoroughly de- 
ranges the botanical indications of time of Linnasus." â€” Lindle.y's

S. Bowerbank, Esq., F.R.S., President, 
in the chair.
A paper by John Anthony, Esq., on a method of rendering the 
appearances in delicate structures visible by means of oblique trans- 
mitted light.
This method depends upon the placing the object in 
such a position that the fine lines or other delicate markings are ex- 
actly at right angles to the illuminating rays, when these lines, &c., 
will be at their maximum of distinctness, and thus tissues may be 
rendered distinctly visible whose existence, when viewed in the or- 
dinary manner, might be considered as exceedingly doubtful.
The 
object employed to illustrate this position was the Navicula of the 
Humber, one of the most delicate of test-objects, which, under ordi- 
nary circumstances, appears perfectly transparent, but when viewed 
75G 
in this way, not only exhibits a double set of lines, but also transverse 
lines, giving" the whole the appearance of being covered wtth a deli- 
cate net-work.
Four drawings of this object were exhibited, showing 
it in as many different positions, making a complete revolution of the 
field in which the the markings first mentioned were distinctly visible.
In order to bring out these appearances it is necessary that the light 
should be very oblique, and must be passed laterally through the 
"bull's eye" in sucli a manner that the object (the Navicula) may 
appear of an intensely blue colour, nearly opaque.
The stage is then 
to be gradually turned round until the shell is in the position to be 
best seen as described.

A paper " On the application of Polarized Light in Microscopic 
ObservatiouLi," by Mr. Legg, was read.
After noticing the remarks 
of Dr. Brewster respecting the advantages likely to be derived from 
the application of polarized light in the microscopic examination of 
delicate structures, Mr. Legg described a series of pojarizing appa- 
ratus which may be readily adapted to almost any microscope, con- 
sisting, 1st, of a bundle of plates of crown glass, from which the 
light is to be reflected at an angle of 56Â°, in which position one por- 
tion only of the light is refracted and another transmitted, each of 
which portions consists of light polarized in opposite planes.
This 
arrangement is the best adapted to low, single powers.
2ndly, a 
plate of tourmaline, as free from colour as possible, and cut parallel 
to the crystalline axis : and 3rdly, a Nicol's, or single-image prism, 
being a portion of a crystal of Iceland spar, cut, and combined with 
a piece of glass, so as to throw out of the field of view one of the two 
images produced by the double refraction of the crystal.
This he 
described as being the most eligible for the compound microscope, 
inasmuch as it is perfectly free from colour, and requires very little 
adjustment.
He then described a series of experiments illustrating 
the most striking phenomena of double refraction, in which he em- 
ployed the Nicol's prism adapted under the stage, a double refractor 
adapted to the eye-pieces, a film of selenite, of uniform thickness, 
placed in accordance with its crystalline axis, and a plate of brass, 
perforated with holes from about â€”^ to 5- of an inch in diameter.
In 
the first of these experiments, in which the doubly refracting crystal 
757 
was placed over the eye-piece, two distinct images appeared, one of 
which revolved round the other when the eye-piece was turned round, 
thus showing the ordinary and extraordinary rays.
On the second, 
the Nicol's prism was applied under the stage, the other arrange- 
ments remaining the same.
Upon turning the eye-piece, although 
two images are produced, but one is seen when half the revolution is 
peformed, i.
e. at 180Â° from the first position.
Changes also take 
place at every other quadrant.
In the third experiment, the selenite 
plate was interposed, the images were now coloured, and presented the 
complementary colours at every quarter of a circle.
When the hole 
in the piece of brass was of a large size, the images were seen to- 
overlap, and white light was produced.
The author concluded with 
some remarks upon the service likely to be rendered to microscopical 
investigation by the employment of polarized light." â€” J.

The following communications were read : â€” 
1 .
On Fairy Rings, by Dr. George Wilson.
The object of Dr. Wil- 
son's remarks was to show that the chemical theory of the origin of 
these remarkable circles, laid before the meeting of the British As- 
sociation, held at Southampton in September 1846, by Professor Way, 
of Cirencester College, was identical with that published by Wollaston 
in the Philosophical Transactions for 1807.
Dr. Wilson also pointed 
out that analyses of various Fungi had been made by Prof.
Schloss- 
berger, of Tubingen, and Dr. Doepping, long before Mr. Way pub- 
lished his, and thought that these gentlemen's names deserved to be 
mentioned, as confirmers of Wollaston's views and predecessors of 
Professor Way, in establishing the probability of the chemical theory 
Vol. II.
- 5 c 
758 
of Fairy Rings proving true.
To Professor Way, on the other hand, 
belonged the twofold merit of being the first to analyse Agarics actu- 
ally taken from Fairy Rings, and the first to supply a detailed quali- 
tative, and quantitative analysis of the ashes of these Fungi.
Dr. Balfour made remarks on the views of botanists relative to cen- 
trifugal development, and endeavoured to show that a combination of 
the botanical and chemical theories was necessary to account for the 
phenomenon of Fairy Rings.
Dr. Fleming thought that none of the theories were sufficient to ac- 
count for the so-called Fairy Rings in all cases ; and alluded to the 
occurrence of Fungi, especially Agaricus oreades, in a circular ar- 
rangement without any alteration in the grass.
Sir Wm. Jardine agreed with Dr. Fleming ; and stated that the 
growth of Fungi in lawns was often not in a circular manner, but of 
various forms, and without altering the appearance of the grass.
He 
then briefly noticed the points which still required determination, and 
urged upon botanists the importance of attending to them.

On the growth of Ferns from seed.
By Joseph Sidebotham, Esq.
The following easy plan of preserving living plants of ferns, was 
pointed out to me upwards of three years ago, by my friend Mr. Wil- 
son, of Warrington ; and I cannot better recommend it to the attention 
of your readers, than by mentioning the following species, of which I 
have fine plants, obtained by this process: Asplenium septentrionale, A.
viride,Ceterach officinarum,Polystichum,Lonchitis and Lastraea rigida.
Half fill a flower-pot with sifted river sand, and having made the 
surface very level, scatter a few sporules on it, placing small labels to 
mark the spot where each species is sown ; cement a glass over the 
760 
top, aud keep the sand moist.
By this plan any botanist may obtain 
roots of his favourite ferns, referring to his herbarium for a few 
sporules, which can always be procured without damaging the speci- 
mens.
I prepared two pots of various species, one was accidentally 
broken, and the produce of the other I mentioned above.
When the plants are sufficiently grown, they may be removed either 
to a Ward's case, or planted in a p<Dt and covered with a bell glass.

Notes on some British Specimens distributed by the Botanical Soci- 
ety of London, in 1847.
By Hewett C.
Watson," Esq.
In early Nos. of the ' Phytologist' for 1845 and 1846, the Editor 
did me the favour to print some explanations respecting certain speci- 
mens distributed in those years, by the Botanical Society of London.
The object of the notes was to convey such information and sugges- 
tions as, it was conceived, might be acceptable to members of the 
Society, and which could not be communicated to them on the labels 
of the specimens.
I propose again to take a similar course, and to 
offer some explanations and remarks in reference to certain of the 
specimens which are now being distributed.
As the London Society 
counts two himdred members (Englishmen, not foreigners), amongst 
whom are included many of the best practical botanists of the coiui- 
try, and is also in friendly communication with several others who 
have not yet become members, there can be no doubt that many read- 
ers of the 'Phytologist' are comprehended among those botanists 
who receive specimens from London.
1. Filago apiculata (G.
E. Sm.).
â€” The Rev. G.
E. Smith kindly 
supplied specimens of this recently described Filago (Phytol.
ii.
p. 
575), which will afford to several members the opportunity of becom- 
ing acquainted with the plant, and may thus induce them to search 
for it in other parts of the country.
There is good judgment, too, 
and evidence of scientific good faith, in thus giving to others the 
means of trying the validity of the characters which are proposed for 
specific diagnosis, â€” qualities, unfortimately, which have not been 
evinced by some other botanists who have described new British spe- 
cies, but who have also sedulously avoided letting specimens thereof 
be seen by such of their fellow-botanists as were most likely to in- 
quire into the value or validity of their supposed species.
Those 
who receive examples of Filago apiculata, of which the supply will 
761 
only allow one each to one-tenth of the members, will instantly see 
its affinity with the common F.
Germanica (Gnaphaliura, of the Lon- 
don Catalogue) to be so close that most botanists would assign it 
thereto, on first glance, and scarce notice it as a variety.
The cha- 
racters by which Mr. Smith M'ould distinguish it are clearly given in 
a former No. of the ' Phytologist ' (1.
c.) and need not be repeated 
here.
Of those characters 1 think I may say, that the greener colour 
of the leaves, and the purple points of the scales, are the only two 
which constantly distinguish these examples of F.
apiculata from 
those of F.
Germanica in my own herbarium ; and how far the 
want of the brighter tints may be connected with the age of the older 
specimens I am not prepared to say.
The* flexuose growth of the 
stem, and tlie apparently lateral position of the heads of flowers, are 
essentially only a single character; and this character arises from 
the development of a branch in the axil of only one leaf underneath 
the head, instead of the two or three branches, from as many leaves, 
which are usually produced in F.
Germanica.
I take it that the 
heads terminate the stems strictly and equally in both plants; the 
difference being only in the number of branches developed under- 
neath them : and therefore, that any ordinary example of F.
Germa- 
nica might so far be converted into the resemblance of F.
apiculata, 
by stripping away the second branches from under the successively 
produced heads as the plant grows upwards.
We have an instance 
in which terminal heads thus become apparently lateral in the Cen- 
taurea Calcitrapa.
Though characters which thus result from abor- 
tion or simple non-development, are always to be received cautiously, 
yet, if constant in themselves, and constantly accompanied by other 
differences, they may fairly enough be adopted in diagnosis.
I fear 
that such constancy will not be found in the case of these two plants.
Some of Mr. Smith's own examples of F.
apiculata are once and 
twice dichotomously branched below the terminal heads, after the 
mode which is ordinarily seen in F.
Germanica; and, on the other 
side, there are specimens in my herbarium which are veritable F.
Germanica in all respects, except that they present the spuriously 
lateral position of the heads, by the non-development of the second 
branch.
One of these, a French specimen, has the flexuose stem and 
spuriously lateral heads as perfectly and conspicuously as any of Mr.
Smith's Yorkshire specimens ; but in the gray colour of the plant, its 
woolly pubescence, narrow leaves, and yellow-pointed scales, it is a 
true F.
Germanica.
On the contrary, I have an Azoric specimen, 
which in its ramification is F.
germanica to the superlative degree, 
762 
but which has leaves equally broad as the broadest of those hi the 
Yorkshire specimens, and as clearly apiculate.
Of the seeds I can 
say nothing either way.
It may be that 1 am somewhat too conser- 
vative of old species in their undivided integrity ; but I think that so 
careful and accurate an observer, as is the author of the ' Plants of 
South Kent,' will allow that where characters are thus found to inter- 
change between two very closely allied quasi-species, we do rightly 
to pause before adopting their permanent division.
Individually, at 
least, I must await the opportunity of examining a larger series of 
l)oth, from different localities, before I can ventui'e to decide either for 
or against the validity of F.
apiculata, as a genuine species discon- 
nected from F.
Germanica.
2. Epilobium lanceolatum (Sebast.) â€” Of this still unsettled species 
Mr. Thwaites has sent a large supply of specimens from the neigh- 
bourhood of Bristol, full length examples, admirably dried.
And 
some good examples were also communicated by Mr. Stephens.
The specimens are distinguishable into two trifling varieties or states 
of luxuriance, gradually passing into each other; the one being small- 
er, with firmer and much shorter leaves, of a glaucous or grayish 
colour, tinged with purple ; the other being more luxuriant (two or 
three of the specimens near a yard long, but folded to a length con- 
venient for paper), with- longer leaves, which are very thin and flexi- 
ble in their dried state, and of a bright green colour.
The smaller 
and more rigid examples correspond very well with a specimen from 
Heidelberg, for which my herbarium was indebted to Mr. Shuttle- 
worth, of Berne.
This specimen is labelled, with the note of cer- 
tainty, " Epilobium sylvestre, Dierbach !" By Steudel and others, 
Dierbach's E.
sylvestre is cited as a synonym of Sebastiani's E.
lan- 
ceolatum.
I have likewise a specimen (iom Aschersleben, received 
from an excellent Prussian botanist, Herr Hornung, which corresponds 
pretty well with the more flexible and greener-leaved examples from 
Bristol.
This specimen is labelled by Hornung "Epilobium mon- 
tanum v.
lanceolatum, M.
et K." These authorities, in connexion with 
corroborative information given to me by Mr. Thwaites, are sufficient 
to satisfy me on the correctness of the name, under which the speci- 
mens are labelled by Mr. Thwaites and Mr. Stephens.
But the ques- 
tion whether the plant itself should be regarded as a distinct species, 
or simply as a variety of Epilobium raontanum, remains to be 
answered.
Having been sown in ray garden, some few years ago, 
from a source which 1 cannot now distinctly make out, the plant has 
become quite aii established weed there.
Among many examples 
703 
sown in different parts of the garden by winds or other agencies, both 
in sunny and in shady situations, none have shown any greater ten- 
dency to assume the characters of E.
montanum, than that of the less 
luxuriant plants producing shorter and broader leaves ; but these 
leaves are even more petiolated than the wild examples from Bristol, 
and always taper to their petioles.
Notwithstanding this, however, I 
find considerable difficulty or uncertainty in fairly assigning the spe- 
cimens in my herbarium between E.
montanum, lanceolatum, and 
roseum ; for some examples of each of the former two approximate to 
others presumed to belong to the latter very obscure species.
Perhaps 
some of the members who may receive specimens, will look out for 
the E.
lanceolatum in their own beats, as well as for connecting links 
between this and E.
montanum.
The chief difference between them 
is in their leaves, although the smaller flowers of E.
lanceolatum, and 
some minor characters, may be taken into account.
But the analogy 
of other species shows that the leaves of the Epilobia are very variable, 
in comparative length and breadth, in the form of their base, and in 
their insertion.
3. Euphorbia stricta (" Reich.") â€” Specimens from the neighbour- 
hood of Tintern, were supplied by Mr. Thwaites, and (unless I misre- 
member, by some confusion with the preceding plant) also by Mr.
Stephens.
This plant has been partially and insufficiently known to 
English botanists for several years.
It is alluded to, under E.
platy- 
phylla, in the fifth edition of the British Flora, as follows :â–  â€” "A plant, 
according with Reichenbach's figure of '^ E.
stricta^ and differing by 
its narrower leaves fi-om the common E.
plaiyphylla {E.
stricta Sm.), 
occurs between Tintern and the Wind-cliff.
It is at least a strongly 
marked var.
: Borrer^ Unfortunately, the specimens have lost most 
of their stem leaves ; but some of them are in good state for showing 
the better character of difference afforded by the fruit, which, in the 
Tintern plant, is only half the size of that on the ordinary corn-field 
E. stricta or platyphylla, and has the "warts" so prominent as rather 
to be designated by the terra " muricated " than " verrucose." Mr.
Kippist has had the Tintern plant under consideration some time, 
and I must agree with that gentleman in thinking it likely to prove a 
distinct species from our corn-field plant.
The latter, in its luxuriant 
forms, is called " platyphylla ; " and in its more starved or unbranched 
forms, takes the name of "stricta;" and when surviving a mild win- 
ter, so as to flower a second season, it becomes the variety "biennis" 
of the London Catalogue, which is so different that I could not feel 
perfectly satisfied in considering it identical with the E.
stricta of ' Eng- 
764 
lish Botany,' until I had proved its specific identity by raising it from 
seeds.
Should the Tintern plant prove permanently distinct from the 
E. platyphylla (or stricta) of our corn-fields, Reichenbach's name 
must give place to some other which will more clearly distinguish it 
from the E.
stricta of ' English Botany;' unless, indeed, the Tintern 
plant should prove to be the F,.
stricta of Linneus, which does not ap- 
pear likely.
4. Hieracium rigidum ("Hartm.") â€” Here again the Society is in- 
debted to Mr. Thwaites for a good supply of specimens, which it has 
appeared desirable to send out to each member, as far as they will go.
Our native Hieracia are still very imperfectly understood, and no ex- 
isting arrangement of names, or descriptions of the species, will fairly 
stand the test of comparison with the facts in nature.
Among others 
which are not yet well understood by English botanists, is the species 
intended under the name of H.
rigidum, in Babington's Manual.
The specimens so labelled by Mr. Thwaites correspond passably well 
with the description given in that work, and may be the ipsissinui 
species intended by the name.
But they by no means correspond 
with the Teesdale specimens collected in 1844, by Mess.
Gibson and 
Backhouse, and (if I mistake not) mentioned in the ' Phytologist ' as 
those of H.
rigidum.
At the time of writing this remark, my Nos. of 
the 'Phytologist' for the three years preceding 1846 are absent from 
home ; and therefore I refer to this work from memory only ; but four 
specimens (not in flower, though with flower-buds visible) which were 
kindly given to me by Mr. G.
S. Gibson, labelled " Hieracium 
rigidum " and " Hieracium rigidum, v.
angustifolium " bear out 
the remark.
These Teesdale specimens, though not fully answer- 
ing to Babington's description of " H.
inuloides," correspond bet- 
ter with specimens so labelled by the Scottish botanists, than with 
the specimens of Mr. Thwaites.
My nearest example to the latter, is 
a specimen from Mr. Tatham, labelled " Hieracium rigidum," and lo- 
cated from " Attermire Rocks, Settle." Under these circumstances 
of doubt, the specimens are 'sent out to the members, in the hope of 
eliciting definite information or suggestive remarks upon the species.
Is the name of " H.
rigidum" correct?
5. " Hieracium subandum ?" â€” There are a few specimens of a 
plant thus interrogatively labelled by the Rev. Andrew Bloxam, who 
finds them near Twycross, in company with H.
sylvaticum and H.
boreale.
This can scarcely be the species intended under the name 
of " H.
subaudum (Z.)," in Babington's Manual; for the leaves are 
less " cordate clasping " at the base, than are those of specimens 
7t)5 
usually labelled " H.
boreale." As with " H.
rigidum," so also with 
these; â€” they are distributed to ask, rather than to give information.
6. Hieracinni sylvaticum (Sm.) â€” A few garden specimens of this 
species are distributed on account of the form under which a second 
bud is developed in the axillae of the leaves subtending the flowering 
branches of the stem.
A flowering stem has grown from the crown of 
the plant, in the usual manner, throwing out lateral branches from 
each leaf or bract of the stem.
These have flowered and seeded ; 
and then, instead of the stem and branches dying away, buds have 
been formed in the axillae of the leaves, between the leaf and its ax- 
illary branch.
These second buds have developed into young plants.
I call them young plants, not branches, because they consist of a clus- 
ter of leaves, the petioles of which ensheath one another, and the form 
of which is precisely that of the leaves of seedling plants, or of the 
early radical leaves, of spring time, upon the older plants.
In some 
of the specimens a fresh, weakly, flowering stem has shot out from the 
cluster of leaves, precisely like the first flowering stems of small seed- 
ling plants ; thus completing their resemblance to (or, rather, identity 
with) young plants, t could dry only few examples, and not all of 
these so good as might be desired for illustration of the fact indicated.
It is one of not very unusual occurrence, I think, but not sufficiently 
attended to by botanical physiologists.
Taken in connexion with 
other facts, more or less analogous, it points to a general rule ; namely, 
that when a plant is forced by circumstances to renew its growth in a 
direction, or at a part from which it would not grow any more under 
ordinary circumstances, â€” in such case the renewed growth tends to 
reproduction, instead of continuation of the individual ; having the 
characters of infancy, more than those of maturity.
This may not be 
a clear explanation of my notion to others, but to follow it up farther, 
now, would lead astray from the present object of my Notes.
7. Sisyrinchium anceps (Lam.) â€” Mr. Lynam has obligingly sent a 
number of specimens, from the lately discovered locality " near 
Woodford, Loughrea, County of Galway." Assuming it to be clearly 
wild there, the explanation how it got thither will be equally difficult 
with that which is to be given for the occurrence of Neottia gemmi- 
para, or Eriocaulon septangulare.
What transported them from 
America to Ireland ?
I take the name for granted, without special 
search into its accuracy.
8. Luzula nivea (De Cand.) â€” A few good examples from Dr.
Dewar, to whom the Society has been obliged for several valuable do- 
nations.
They are labelled from a " wood at Broomhall, near Dun- 
VoL.
II.

fermline." This discovery is quite unexpected.
I should have con- 
jectured the likelihood of L.
albida being found in Scotland, to be 
much greater ; but the conjecture would have been wrong, it now 
appears, though in conformity with the distribution of the two species 
on the Continent.
It is to be feared that this pretty Luzula will 
prove only very local with us ; as it seems unlikely to be overlooked 
by any botanist fortunate enough to come upon a locality for the 
plant, the white flowers of which should make it rather conspicuous.
9. Carex vulgaris var.
juncea (Fries ?) â€” This is one of the innu- 
merable varieties of the species which English botanists, by common 
consent, and for many years, have (it is said) mis-called " caespitosa;" 
and which, in the fifth edition of the British Flora, in Babington's 
Manual, and in the London Catalogue, is entered under the name of 
" Goodenovii (Gay)." Among other distinctions.
Gay's Carex Goode- 
novii is stated to have its root " creeping, laxly caespitose ; " while 
the supposed Linnean Carex coespitosa (Goodenough's stricta) is de- 
scribed as " densely caespitose." The specimens now distributed 
were pulled from tufts as densely caespitose as ever Carex was ; fifty 
or a hundred flowering stems growing up closely together from the 
same root.
Yet they are not the Linnean caespitosa, nor the stricta 
of Goodenough.
For the suggestion of the name above given to them, 
I am indebted to Dr. Boott.
Wishing to make some further remarks 
on this and allied species, I will not seek to occupy more space of 
the Phytologist at the present time ; but may send a short separate 
paper upon them hereafter.
10.
Lysiinachia Azorica (Hornem.) â€” Two varieties, partly wild 
examples, partly garden-grown in this country.
They are distri- 
buted to English botanists on account of their close affinity (perhaps, 
specific identity) with our L.
nemorum.
I wish to distribute the ex- 
amples among botanists likely to be familiar with the British L.
nemo- 
rum ; because these two varieties, taken in connexion with our native 
plant, aff"ord very decided instances of the uncertainty or inconstancy 
of characters, such as are usually deemed very sufficient for specific 
diagnosis.
As with the preceding Carex, however, I postpone re- 
marks which might prove rather diff'use or lengthy, to a future occa- 
sion ; and will now simply recommend botanists to preserve the speci- 
mens for reference at another time.
IL Cyperusfuscus (Linn.) â€” Mr. Salmon having sent a good sup- 
ply of this very local plant, from the new (second) locality, announced 
lately in the Phytologist (ii.
609), it was thought that members might 
find a specimen acceptable, even though their herbaria might akeady 
767 
have examples of the species from the Chelsea locality.
It is to be 
hoped that Mr, Mill will reply to Mr. Salmon's question, whether the 
Surrey locality is natural or artificial.
Unless the Cyperus was car- 
ried thither from Chelsea, by some botanist desirous of preserving the 
species to our flora, the station may be very readily admitted as a per- 
fectly natural habitat.
And if the Shalford station is genuine, we 
shall find others, in all probability.
12.
Orohanche ametliystea (Tbuil.
.?) â€” Mr. Guilding has supplied 
the Society with several specimens of this Orobanche, lately dis- 
covered by the Rev. W.
S. Hore, on Treganthe Sands, Whitsand Bay, 
Cornwall.
It was announced in the Phytologist, ii.
239.
13.
Linaria supina (Desf.) â€” Mr. Guilding also presented speci- 
mens of this species (lately discovered at Catsdown Quarries, near 
Plymouth) for the Society's herbarium ; two or three of which may 
be spared for some of the members who were sufficiently early in 
sending in their contributions this winter.
(As might be anticipated, 
a great influx of parcels takes place towards the end of each year.
About Christmas, these are taken under examination and arrange- 
ment ; and a very large addition is thus made at once to the dupli- 
cate store.
The desiderata of those members who have sent in their 
contributions between Michaelmas and Christmas, are then looked 
out in rotation, according to the goodness of their contributions.
It 
thus happens, that members who send their parcels after Christmas, 
are much less likely to get specimens of those rare or novel species 
which are obtained only in small quantity.
â€” Verbum sap.
J 
Besides the less known plants which I have enumerated, there are 
various others which will still be desiderata with several members.
For instance, a most liberal supply of Carduus setosus, given by Dr.
Dewar ; â€” numerous good examples oi Galium Vaillantii, sent by Mr.
G. S.
Gibson ; â€” good examples of Gli/ceria plicata, from Mr. Moore 
and Mr. Bentall; â€” well-dried specimens of (Enanthe silaifoUa, from 
Mr. Salmon ; â€” excellent examples of Isatis tinctoria, from the same 
member ; â€” a further supply of Irish Saxifrages, from Mr. Andrews ; 
â€” various Rubi, from Mr. Bentall and Mr. Lees, some of them con- 
sidered new species (that is, not included in the London Catalogue).
But it is unnecessary to make out a long list here ; the members who 
want the specimens, will find their desiderata lists not made in vain.
Cultivated or Foreign specimens of Xanthiam Strumarium, Ajuga 
pyramidalis, and other species, (of which the Society has never re- 
ceived British specimens) have been added to the duplicate store, as 
temporary representatives of the species, better than none at all.
768 
until examples of British growth can be procured to replace them, in 
the herbaria of members.
Lastly, I will trespass still a few lines more, to recommend the 
members who may have received only bad specimens, to keep mark- 
ing the species as a desidei'atum, until they obtain others sufficiently 
good.
For a series of years, any sort of rubbish, paltry fragments, 
wretchedly dried, used to be sent to the London Society ; and these 
were most unwisely accepted, and distributed from the Society, as 
botanical specimens.
The improvement during the past three years 
has been very great, though partial.
Many specimens, even this win- 
ter, must be destroyed or returned to the contributors.
But there are 
also very numerous specimens so perfect and well-dried, that I can 
now truly say, for the first time, we have English parcels nowise in- 
ferior to the best of the Continental parcels, as respects the condition 
of the specimens.
The names on the labels will show to which of 
the contributors the credit of this improvement is fairly due ; and it 
might seem obtrusive and invidious were I to mention their names 
myself.
Continental botanists have long made it matter of reproach 
against those of Britain, that they collect fragments for specimens, 
and dry them as badly as possible.
We are improving, at last ; and 
much of the improvement has sprung from the Bedford Street stimulus.

Note on the New Locality for Cyperus fuscus.
By George G.
Mill, Esq.
In announcing his discovery of the rare Cyperus fuscus on Shal- 
ford Common, near Guildford, Surrey (Phytol.
ii.
609), Mr. Salmon is 
naturally anxious to know whether the habitat is a genuine one, or 
whether the plant has only been naturalized in that spot by some 
botanist, desirous, like myself, that it should not be lost to the Flora 
772 
of Britain.
I am happy to say that so far as I am concerned, the new 
locality is perfectly genuine.
It would only be right that those who naturalize rare plants, should 
give publicity to the fact ; and should I ever do so, I shall not 
fail to make the readers of the ' Phytologist ' acquainted with the 
particulars.
George G.
Mill.
Kensington, Feb. 1847.
Report of Mr. Hincfc's paper " On the causes of disjunctions of 
Vegetable Substance, especially those which are horizontaV* 
" After some preliminary observations on the subject of disruptions 
in general, the author briefly notices certain cases of vertical disrup- 
tion, and then proceeds to the more immediate object of his paper, 
the horizontal separation of vegetable substance by natural means.
This, he observes, may take place in the axis itself, or in any of the 
organs connected with it at their points of attachment, as in the fall 
of the leaf, of sepals and petals, of entire flowers and fruits, and in 
the separation of such buds as form caulinary bulbs ; or it may occur 
at some other part of the organ, a portion separating from the rest, or 
the whole breaking up into pieces.
Every such separation, he argues, 
must depend on one of the three following causes: 1.
on a stoppage 
of the circulation from ligature; 2.
on unequal rapidity of growth of 
the two parts ; or 3.
on the confinement within coherent envelopes 
(which do not admit of extension) of a portion of the axis or of some 
growing part, so that the force of growth bursts the envelope, carry- 
ing ofi" its upper portion.
These general rules he then proceeds to ap- 
ply to the explanation of particular cases.
" Of stems usually termed Articulate, some, such as those of Kleinia 
articulata, have no tendency to disruption at the supposed joint, 
which is merely the commencement of a new branch.
In the misletoe, 
on the other hand, the author believes that the tendency to divide at 
the bases of the branchlets may be consequent on the dichotomous 
structure, which causes a pressure equivalent to a ligature at the point 
of division.
* Eead before tbe Linnean Society Dec. 16, 1845.
773 
"With respect to the fall of the leaf, he refers to the observations of 
DeCandollie and Du Petit Thouars, which he does not think sufficient 
to account for that phenomenon in a multitude of cases, but regrets 
that he can throw no additional light on the subject.
He attributes 
the separation of the sepals and petals when they are caducous, to the 
outward pressure occasioned by the more rapid development of the 
interior circles stopping the circulation of the fluids, and conceives 
this to be strikingly exemplified in Papaveraceae, where the growth of 
the petals within the bud is great and rapid.
He notices a specimen 
of Eschscholtzia in which the sepals cohering less firmly than usual, 
the calyx, instead of being thrown off in the form of a calyptra, re- 
mains after the opening of the flower partially adhering ; and observes 
that the ordinary disruption in this genus takes effect, not at the base 
of the sepals, but at a point above this, where the pressure occasioned 
by the enlargement of the petals is greatest.
He instances also the 
genus Eucalyptus, in which there is a strong coherence of the sepals, 
and the lower portion of the calyx being strengthened by the adherent 
torus, the growth of the interior organs supplies the force which se- 
parates the part of the coherent sepals above the torus in a solid piece 
like the cover of a vessel.
On the cause of the horizontal separation 
of a portion of the anthers in the form of valves, which occurs in a few 
instances, he is not prepared to offer any opinion.
" In the fruit, as in the calyx, the author believes that horizontal dis- 
ruption arises from the force of cohesion of the parts of the circle, the 
absence of any of the causes favourable to dehiscence along the mid- 
rib of the carpellary leaf, and the operation of some force pressing 
either from without or from within on one particular line encircling 
the fniit ; and he proceeds to offer explanations of those cases with 
which he is most familiar.
He lakes first the circumscissile capsule 
of Anagallis, in which he states that the central free receptacle with 
the seeds upon it continuing to enlarge in both diameters after the en- 
velope has ceased to grow, and having occupied from the first the en- 
tire cavity, it is naturally to be expected, since the chief extension of 
the interior parts is upwards (the natural direction of growth), while 
the enlargement of the seeds in the lower half tends to press back the 
parts of the lower hemisphere, that uniform and regular pressure will 
resolve a nearly spherical capsule into two equal hemispheres.
This 
remark he applies to Centunculus also, but confesses himself at a loss 
to give any reason why the opening of Trientalis, which depends on 
the same general causes, should be irregular.
For the separation of 
the lid of the capsule in Hyoscyamus he accounts by the contraction 
Vol. II.

and rigidity of the throat of the calyx excercisiug a gradually in- 
creasing pressure around the upper part of the capsule, and thus 
causing its separation by the first of the general principles laid 
down.
"The author then proceeds to the case of Lecythis, which he thinks 
is to be explained by the third of his general principles.
In illus- 
tration of this principle he refers to a monstrosity of the common 
tulip, described and exhibited by himself some years ago at a meet- 
ing of the British Association.
In this monstrosity, the upper leaf, 
being unusually developed, has cohered by its edges so firmly as to 
imprison the flower, and this constraint occurring at a period when 
the stalk was increasing in length, and previous to any consider- 
able enlargement of the flower-bud, the force applied was chiefly 
vertical, and has carried off" the upper part of the leaf in the form of 
a calyptra, leaving the lower part in the shape of a cup, from the 
centre of which the stem appears to rise.
The separation of the lid 
of the capsule of Lecythis he believes to be effected in an analogous 
manner ; the septa which form the two or four cells into which the 
fruit is divided, meet in a thickened axis, and the outer part of the 
fruit becoming (partly from its natural texture and partly from the 
adherence of the torus and calyx) hard, solid, and fully grown, while 
the axis continues slowly to extend, and thus to press upwai'ds that 
portion of the capsule which rests upon it, causes that portion first to 
become slightly prominent, and finally by a strain upon the vessels 
of that particular part, to fall off" in the shape of a lid.
In Couroupi- 
ta the pressure is sufl[icient to mark the surface of the fruit with a pro- 
minence, but from the partitions giving way early, and from the abun- 
dant juices produced in the interior, there has not been, he conceives, 
sufficient pressure to occasion disruption.
In all the species of 
Lecythis, he observes, the extent of the loose cover corresponds with 
the extent of the axis, and what remains of the latter continues at- 
tached to it.
"As regards lomentaceous fruits in general, the author believes that 
the intervals between the seeds being suflicient to admit of the sides 
of the fruit cohering (which is promoted in particular instances by 
special causes), the swelling of the seeds afterwards stretches the parts 
over them in a degree which this coherence prevents from being 
equally distributed, drags the tissue forcibly from the junctures which 
are fixed points, and thus there being a strain in each direction from 
the middle line of the juncture, the contraction of drying during the 
ripening of the fi-uit eff'ects the separation.
775 
"Finally the author refers to the horizontal separations in the cap- 
sules of Mosses, and observes that the separation of the calyptra af- 
fords a plain example of the operation of his third principle ; but 
with regard to the nature of the operculum, although he has an hypo- 
thesis under consideration, his mind is not yet satisfied.
He states 
his object in the present paper to have been the investigation of the 
immediate physical causes of certain known effects, but he has not 
thought this the place even to touch upon their ultimate causes or the 
ends to accomplish which they are apparently designed, and which 
adapt them to the position and general structure of the particular 
plant." â€” Proc.

BOTANICAL SOCIETY OF EDINBURGH.
Thursday, February Wth, 1847.
â€” Dr. Greville, President, in the 
chair.
Letters were read from Professor De Candolle, Geneva, and Marius 
Barneoud, Paris, announcing donations ; and from Capt.
Portlock, 
giving a short account of his horticultural proceedings at Corfu, and 
suggesting the Convolvulus Batatas, or sweet potato, as a substitute 
for the potato ; â€” the plant has been introduced into Corfu, and appa- 
rently with success.
Capt.
Portlock describes it as an excellent ve- 
getable, being dry and between the potato and parsnip in taste.
He 
noticed having picked Orchis hircina, 18 in.
high, at Butrinto, oppo- 
site Corfu.
The following communications were read : â€” 
1. "On the Defoliation of Trees," by the Rev. Dr.
Fleming, After 
refeiTing to the extremely defective nomenclature connected with the 
" defoliation of trees," employed in the writings of Lindley, Gray, 
and others, Dr. F.
called the attention of the Society to a classifica- 
tion of the phenomena which he had published in the ' Edinburgh 
Journal of Science,' by Brewster, for January, 1826, and where leaves 
are arranged in reference to their duration into three groups â€” Folium 
deciduum, Folium annuum.
Folium perenne.
In the first class the 
leaves cease to exercise their functions when the buds have been per- 
fected, and fall off in succession before winter; or, when the plant is 
trained as a hedge, they frequently remain until the evolution of the 
buds in the following spring.
In the second class the leaves outlive 
the winter, and do not die or fall of!', until a number of new leaves 
have been evolved for the support of the plant in spring or summer.
776 
Such are the bay, laurel, holly and ivy, which are never without living 
leaves, while in the first class such leaves are periodically wanting.
In the third class the leaves continue to exercise their functions for 
several years, as in the firs, an arrangement in part connected with 
the ripening of the seeds.
The author then proceeded to expose the 
erroneous views of those who maintain that it is only the buds of a 
tree which are alive, and that its timber is dead, and destined to serve 
merely as a soil for the buds on their evolution in spring.
He re- 
stricted his proofs to the leaves and branches connected with them 
which live throughout a succession of seasons â€” to the mode in which 
buds can be forced â€” and to the individual differences preserved, in 
the case of fruit trees, between the stock and graft during the whole 
period of their connexion.
2. " On Carex saxatilis, X., and Carex Grahami, Boott.^'' by Dr.
Balfour.
In this communication Dr. B.
endeavoured to show that 
intermediate forms exist which seem to connect the two species.
He 
exhibited specimens picked on Ben na Cruichben, near Killin, in 
1844, which Â§howed chai-acters partly of the one species and partly 
of the other; â€” all gradations are found from the true form of C.
saxa- 
tilis, with its rounded or ovate, dark, erect spikes, and ovate, beaked, 
emarginate perigynia slightly longer than the scale ; to C.
Grahami 
with its oblong-ovate, somewhat nutant spikes, and bifurcate perigy- 
nia, twice as long as the scales.
Dr. Balfour exhibited a series of American ferns, contributed by 
Dr. Gavin Watson, of Philadelphia, among which the following were 
the most interesting species and varieties : Cistopteris tenuis of 
Schott, a variety of C.
fragilis, and various intermediate forms â€” Po- 
ly stichum acrostichoides, some specimens with rounded pinna?, and 
others with the pinnae much divided and deeply serrated : among the 
latter were several with the fructification extending to the lowest 
pinnae ; â€” Diplazium thelypteroides of Presl, several with the segments 
of the pinnae very acute ; â€” Lastraea spinulosa, various forms, includ- 
ing L.
intermedia of American botanists ; â€” Lastraea lancastriensis, a 
form approaching L.
cristata, but apparently distinct : in some speci- 
mens the frond was alternately pinnate, with the pinnae approximated, 
cleft, or slightly pinnatifid, the segments rounded or slightly toothed : 
in others the pinnae were deeply pinnatifid, and much toothed, more 
or less acute; while in a third set the frond was bipinnate.
Nume- 
rous intermediate forms were exhibited, showing the transition from 
the one to the other.
Athyrium Filix-fcemina of Roth ; of this fern a 
complete series was shown, connecting the typical form of the spe- 
777 
cies with the various forms to which the names of irriguum, angusta- 
tum and aspleuoides have been given by some botanists, who regard 
them as distinct species.
Dr. Greville, who had carefully examined the specimens of the two 
last-mentioned ferns, was of opinion that Lastrasa lancastriensis is a 
good species, and that all the forms of Athyrium Filix-fcemina exhi- 
bited were referrible to one species.
Dr. Balfour also showed specimens of Hieracium rigidum, var.
an- 
(jusHfoUum of Fries, from near Inversnaid, Loch Lomond, H.
pre- 
nanthoides, Habbie's Howe, Pentland Hills, and Mimulus lutens, near 
old reservoir, Pentlands.
The last-named plant has now been found 
in several spots near Edinburgh ; also on the banks of the Clyde, 
near Glasgow^ ; near Largs ; in Perthshire, Stirlingshire and Aber- 
deenshire ; near Morpeth, and in South Wales.
Dr. B.
also men- 
tioned the discovery of Achillaea tanacetifolia in England.
The following gentlemen were admitted ordinary fellows of the 
Society, viz..
Dr. Charles Stewart, 7, London Street, William Balfour 
Baikie, Esq., 14, Pitt Street, and William Wright, Esq., 19, Salisbury 
Street.â€” W^.

â€” J.
E. Gray, Esq., F.R.S., &c., President, in the 
chair.
Seven new members were elected, and various donations to the li- 
brary and herbarium were announced.
Among various other specimens exhibited, were examples of the 
species mentioned in Mr. Watson's " Notes " in the ' Phytologist' for 
the present month, and also the following : â€” 
Achillea tanacetifolia (All.).
â€” Communicated by Mr. Hardy, its 
discoverer, from the side of a high, heathy hill, near Ringing Low, 
five miles north of Sheffield.
Undoubtedly an example of that va- 
riable species.
Epilohium hrachycarpum (Leight.).
â€” A garden specimen, commu- 
nicated by Mr. Thwaites.
Many duplicates were sent by Mr.
Thwaites for distribution, and it may hence be worth while to direct 
attention to the peculiarity which gives additional interest to them.
The subdivision of the Linnean species, E.
angustifolium, into two 
others, was founded on the long and short fruit, with other charac- 
778 
ters ; and the two sub-species were accordingly named by their pro- 
posers E.
macrocarpum [Stephens) and E.
brachycarpum [Leighton).
The former is the common wild form, the latter being the common 
garden form in Britain.
On the specimens of Mr. Thwaites the fruit 
is generally under an inch in length ; but a few of the pods on many 
of the specimens range from an inch and a half to even two inches 
in length.
Potentilla rupestris (Linn.).
â€” A specimen communicated by Miss 
Harvey, with a label to indicate that it was collected on Ben Lawers, 
by Dr. Greville.
It required the authority of a trustworthy botanist, 
like Dr. Greville, and the exhibition of an actual specimen of the 
species, to make the locality credible ; and even now it is difficult to 
conceive how so conspicuous a plant could have been overlooked on 
a hill very frequently visited by the best practical botanists of Britain.
Saxifraga umhrosa (Linn.).
â€” Specimens from " Craig y bairns " 
and the "Woods near Dunkeld," communicated by Miss Harvey.
The leaves of these examples correspond with those of the Yorkshire 
specimens from Mr. Tatham, in being crenate, and rather obtusely 
so.
Thus, both the Scottish and the English apparently wild plants 
correspond with the examples usually sent from the Pyrenees, and 
not with the serrated or dentated forms which prevail in Ireland ; but 
it has already been abundantly established that neither form is pecu- 
liar to the Pyrenees or to Ireland.

Living Heath and Fossil Tree.
By Joseph Sidebotham, Esq.
I SEND you the following statement of facts, and leave your readers 
to draw their own conclusions; for I must confess I never could ar- 
rive at any to my own satisfaction.
Six or seven years ago I was told that there was a curious fossil 
tree to be seen in a stone-quarry, at a place called Tintwistle, about 
fifteen miles from this town, and that there was a living branch grow- 
ing from it.
Being rather curious to see this wonder, I took the first 
opportunity of visiting the place, having the same friend for my guide.
Tintwistle is a small village situated in a wild, romantic valley.
779 
through which the Sheffield railway passes, and the river which 
waters it is the principal source of the Mersey.
In the sides of the 
hills are numerous quarries for stone, and it was to one of these that 
I was conducted, which had not been worked for many years.
About ten feet from the ground, lying in a horizontal position, in 
the face of the quarry, was what appeared to be the trunk of a fossil 
tree, a few feet in length, and its impression on the rock some dis- 
tance farther : from the place where the fossil had been broken off 
grew a branch, eight or ten feet long, with foliage near the rock and 
at the extremity.
I climbed up to the place, and found that the 
branch sprang from between the fossil tree and the rock, and appear- 
ed quite firmly planted.
The fossil itself was a mere infiltration of 
sand filling up the cavity left by some decayed tree : the markings 
on the rock where the tree had lain were very indefinite.
Of the liv- 
ing branch I could make nothing ; the foliage was that of a heath, 
but the size did not favour the idea : I gathered a few sprigs, and 
sent them to several friends : the E-ev.
W. A.
Leighton sent me word 
that he considered it to be Erica arborea, a species I had never seen.
Since then the place has been visited by a number of pseudo-geolo- 
gists, who cut down the branch without remorse, and I feared quite 
destroyed it, but have lately learned that it has begun to spring 
again, and that the proprietor of the quarry strictly preserves it from 
further depredations.

Note on the Death of Mr. Riley, of Papplewick, and on his Collec- 
tion of Ferns.
The name of Mr. Riley, of Papplewick, has long been familiar to 
botanists in this country.
Without making any attempt to laud Mr.
Riley's botanical attainments, of which I know but little,* I may 
venture to describe him as an ardent admirer, an assiduous collec- 
tor, and a most successful cultivator of the beautiful tribe of ferns.
I 
believe that he spared neither trouble nor expense in pursuing this 
his favourite study.
It is not perhaps so generally known that Mr. Riley died suddenly

Remarks on Cuscuia approximata (Bab.).
By Thomas Bentall, Esq.
In the list of recent additions to the British Flora given in the 
preface to the ' Phytologist ' for 1846, mention is made of Cuscuta 
approximata [Bab.).
It is, I believe, generally known how this plant 
first found its way into this country, but perhaps the few following 
particulars may be interesting to some of the readers of the ' Phyto- 
781 
legist,' as they serve to corroborate facts previously noticed in one or 
two of the public journals.
About three years ago I received from a friend a packet of lucerne 
seed, which had been imported by the East India Company from Aff- 
ghanistan.
It was at a time when our East Anglian agriculturists were 
much alarmed at the somewhat serious ravages of Cuscuta Trifolii 
amongst their clover crops.
Previously, therefore, to sowing the lu- 
cerne seed in my garden, which I had intended to do to ascertain its 
value in an agricultural point of view, I was induced to examine it, 
and somewhat to ray surprise I found it to contain a considerable ad- 
mixture of what appeared to be seeds of a Cuscuta.
I immediately 
set to work in order to try to raise some plants ; a portion of the 
seed was sown in a large flower-pot, and placed in a cucumber frame, 
and at the same time an additional quantity was sown on a bed in 
the open air.
In both instances the young lucerne plants soon made 
their appearance, but it was only in the flower-pot that I observed 
any trace of the Cuscuta.
Here I was fortunate enough to obtain 
three young specimens, but the many vicissitudes to which plants of 
their peculiar and delicate habit are exposed, soon deprived me of 
two of their number.
With the remaining one, however, I was more 
fortunate ; it soon commenced pushing out its stems in all directions, 
and in a short time destroyed all the lucerne in the pot.
It did not 
at this time exhibit any signs of flowering : I was therefore induced 
to transfer it, flower-pot and all, to the centre of the bed before-men- 
tioned, in order to furnish it with a suflScient supply of food for its 
further development.
Soon after its being placed in this situation 
my hopes were well nigh blasted ; for suddenly the stems, which had 
been previously growing vigorously, became shrivelled, and life ap- 
peared almost extinct.
At first I was at a loss to account for this 
circumstance, but afterwards found that it was occasioned by the 
scorching rays of the sun; a succession of damp, cloudy weather soon 
after ensuing, it reassumed its healthy appearance, and grew with a 
rapidity truly astonishing.
In the course of time my Cuscuta came to maturity ; several clus- 
ters of flowers were produced, which enabled me at once to see that it 
was quite distinct both from C.
Epithymum and C.
trifolii, both of 
which, however, it resembled in habit very closely.
Fresh specimens 
were sent to Mr. Babington, who at once pronounced it to be his C.
approximata.
There appears to be considerable difficulty in getting the seeds of 
Cuscuta to vegetate ; since making the above experiment, I have

been successful.

Halstead, March, 1847.
Notice of ' Cyhele Britannica ; or British Plants and their Geo- 
graphical Relations.
By Hewett Cottrell Watson.' 
The time has been, and the fact is faithfully chronicled in our bo- 
tanical publications, when the entire energies of the British botanist 
were devoted to the acquisition of specimens, and the test of merit 
was the possession of the greatest number of species.
So very blind- 
ly was this propensity for numerical superiority carried out, and so 
totally unaccompanied by any competent botanical knowledge, that 
in the early days of the 'Phytologist' the same plant veri/ frequently/ 
occurred under two names in the lists then forwarded for publication, 
sometimes under three names, and once under four names, and the 
lists sent us for publication were by no means extraordinary instances 
of ignorance.
The two Botanical Societies at that time distributed 
plants with equal inattention to correct nomenclature, so that blun- 
ders became disseminated through the country under the grave and 
pompous sanction of scientific authority.
Indeed, the blundering of 
the Societies may have exercised an influence in increasing the blun- 
dering of writers.
As regards Societies, however, a great improve- 
ment has taken place, and great care is now taken to see that the 
plants distributed are correctly nanied.
There is also another cause for this general carelessness and inac- 
curacy in many ; it is the opprobrium which shallow lecturers endea- 
vour to cast on the " mere species-man." Of all inventions for con- 
cealing ignorance, this is, in every respect, the most deceptive and the 
most baneful : the intimate and perfect knowledge of species is the 
basis of Natural History ; and those men who hide their own igno- 
rance by a subterfuge so flimsy, however they may lecture, however 
they may write, they can never be worth hearing or reading; for they 
possess not that foundation of facts on which all available superstruc- 
ture of conclusions must be based.
As a general writer who confines 
his labours to words of three letters can only find an audience of 
children, so he who writes on Natural History without a knowledge 
of species will only be read by babies in the science, who take com- 
fort in finding an author as ignorant as themselves.
We know from 
783 
experience the fatal effects of this sneering at true knowledge : we 
have repeatedly heard conceited young men assert, with evident feel- 
ings of self-satisfaction, that " they did not study species, they only 
sought to investigate principles." 
In the compilation of his work Mr. Watson has experienced great 
difficulty in obtaining the required data, from the impossibility of de- 
pending on the accuracy of the authors of both printed and written 
lists: there is scarcely a species (except those of such universal oc- 
currence as not to have been recorded at all) which has not recorded 
habitats manifestly at variance with all probability ; and Mr. Wat- 
son's task of sifting the true from the false or doubtful has truly been 
a most laborious one ; yet, in determining geographical distribution 
this information is the sine qua non of the philosophical botanist.
The connexion of the subjects are thus pointed out by Mr.
Watson : â€” 
" Though a knowledge of plants, and a knowledge of their geogra- 
phical relations, may be deemed two distinct subjects of study, yet 
they were perhaps never wholly disjoined, and there is now certainly 
an increasing tendency to bring them into closer connexion.
On the 
one side, indeed, it is impossible to disconnect the two kinds of 
knowledge.
The technical botanist often knows species sufficiently 
well in the herbarium or the garden, although understanding ex- 
tremely little about their geographical relations ; but the botanical 
geographer cannot remain unacquainted with species, while investi- 
gating their distribution.
The latter takes a march forward, beyond 
the ground of the technical describer, or the student of species ; and 
before he can do so, he must first pass over that ground; tarrying 
upon it awhile, to make himself acquainted with species, their names 
and synonymes, and their technical classifications.
" Bearing in mind, then, that the study of geographical relations is 
an advance onward, which cannot be successfully made, unless a fair 
knowledge of species has been previously acquired, it becomes easy 
to explain why the distribution of plants has hitherto attracted only 
a very small share of attention from the botanists of Britain.
The 
great â€” the very great majority have never attempted or wished to go 
beyond the ground first occupied.
Whether their attention has been 
restricted to the comparatively narrow field of British Botany, or 
whether it has ranged widely over the Flora of the whole earth ; â€” 
whether it has been directed to favourite groups of plants, or whether 
it has sought to compass the whole vegetable world ; in either of 
these cases, sufficient mental interest and employment have usually 
784 
been found in the study and description of species, or in their syste- 
matic classification.
"As this latter kind of knowledge is increased in amount and accu- 
racy, the botanical geographer becomes facilitated in his own studies ; 
and of course his investigations will be most successful with those 
plants and those countries, which have been most thoroughly examined 
by the collectors and describers of species.
"Britain and Germany, Sweden and France â€” countries whose floral 
productions have been long stuided and known â€” may now be said to 
have their botanical geographers, as well as their technical discribers 
of plants.
And the same department of phytological science is be- 
coming an important feature even in the descriptive Floras of countries, 
the plants of which are now, for the first time, publishing in distinct 
and complete Floras ; as witness the admirable works on the botany 
of Russia, of the Canaries, and of the Antarctic Lands, â€” respectively, 
by Ledebour, Webb, and Hooker." 
For the sake of convenience Mr. Watson has grouped the counties 
into eighteen provinces, which is in every respect better than the mi- 
nor political divisions.
A list of these provinces is given below.

" The uses of these * Provinces ' may be shortly recapitulated.
First, they afford a method for showing the areas of plants, as facts 
in nature, independently of all theoretical explanations and reasons.
Secondly, they may be taken as a primary step towards a census of 
the species, in respect of their comparative frequency ; those most 
widely and generally distributed, even in large spaces, being usually 
also the most common species.
With increasing knowledge, the 
census will probably be founded on counties or smaller sections ; 
though this degree of exactness cannot be perfectly reached at present.
Thirdly, so far as it is shown, the distribution of the species will be 
shown with greater comparative accuracy ; because our lists for pro- 
vinces can be made much more full and accurate, than would be the 
case with county lists of species, or lists for other smaller sections.
Fourthly, much circumlocution and tedious enumeration of names 
may be avoided, through referring to the distribution of species by few 
provinces, rather than by many counties.
But, fifthly, it is to be re- 
membered that these provinces are only arbitrary sections, adopted 
for convenience in description and reference, instead of counties.
So 
far as they do correspond with peculiarities in the physical geography 
of Britain, it is an advantageous circumstance ; although such a cor- 
respondence is not necessary to their object or use.
The divisions 
next to come under consideration, on the contrary', are natural ; inas- 
much as they will be traced in correspondence with the actual distri- 
bution of plants, and without reference to political or other conventional 
)oundaries." 
The author's observations on regions and zones must be studied by 
every botanist ; they possess great interest, and the more as recording, 
in some instances, records of the author's personal observations : we 
may, however, caution juvenile botanists against drawing inferences 
from any casual list of plants they may have observed at certain ele- 
786 
vations or in certain regions, for these must of necessity be incomplete.
We have noticed several instances, on the Welch mountains, of plants 
appearing in patches without much uniformity as regards elevation : 
thus a patch of juniper commences at a great elevation on Glydir, 
and ascends nearly to the summit ; another patch occurs fifteen hun- 
dred feet lower down : a person descending in a direct line from the 
summit might observe either of these patches, but not both ; and any 
conclusion drawn from such observation must be in some degree fal- 
lacious.
Cnicus heterophyllus occurs in magnificent patches on these 
mountains : on some mountains these patches may be a thousand feet 
above the juniper ; on others, the juniper may have a like superiority 
in elevation over the Cnicus.
On the hills about Loch Lomond we 
observed Polypodium Dryopteris ascending to the very summits ; in 
Ireland the only known locality is the extreme and exposed summit 
of Knocklayd : in Herefordshire this fern only occurs in warm shel- 
tered woods, scarcely above the sea-level.
Lycopodium Selago ap- 
pears quite a mountain plant in North Wales ; in Sussex it rarely 
occurs above the sea-level.
From this conflicting evidence furnished 
by plants, of local occurrence and limited range, we are not led to un- 
dervalue the facts themselves, but we feel little disposed to deduce 
conclusions from them.
Mr. Watson is himself very circumspect in 
drawing such conclusions, and never ventures on the expression of 
any which can be characterized as hypothetical.
We now arrive at a most interesting portion of Mr. Watson's work, 
the distribution of British plants under seven different types : we need 
make no apology to our readers for transferring the entire description 
of these to the pages of the ' Phytologist.' 
" In addition to their distribution by provinces and climatic zones, 
there is a third mode of indicating the geographical relations of 
plants, which may also require some explanation.
It has been be- 
fore observed that certain species are spread over the whole island, 
while others are limited to one, two, three or more of the provinces.
The same holds true in the zones; some species occurring in all of 
them, others in one or more.
Perhaps no two species have exactly 
the same distribution or relative fi-equency ; and yet certain general 
similarities may be traced, by which the species may be grouped to- 
gether under a few leading Types of distribution.
In the small vo- 
lume before alluded to, by the title of ' Remarks,' certain ' geogra- 
phic types ' were indicated (pp.
86 â€” 89) ; and in the ' Tabular 
Appendix' to the same volume (115 â€” 184) the species were severally 
assigned to their peculiar types.
This was simply an attempt to ex- 
787 
press, by a single term, the leading character of their distribution, 
with reference to geographical position and climate.
Six types of 
distribution were particularly mentioned; under one or other of 
which, it was thought, nearly all the species of plants indigenous in 
Britain might respectively be arranged.
No attempt, however, was 
made to define the precise limits of the types geographically.
Nor, 
indeed, could any exact boundary lines be traced on a map, without 
abruptly cutting asunder the fine gradations of Nature ; for the types 
pass into each other without any hard or abrupt lines of distinction.
In slightly describing the several types, in the former volume, a dif- 
ferent order of succession was adopted, and consequently the nos.
affixed to them were different also ; but in other respects they were 
essentially the same as the following : â€” 
" 1.
The British Type.
â€” In this group will be included those spe- 
cies which are found in all, or nearly all, of the eighteen provinces 
before explained ; and which, moreover, are not so exclusively pre- 
valent or predominant in any particular portion of the island, as to 
bring them clearly within one or other of the following types.
Some 
of the species may be regarded as of universal occurrence in this 
country, growing in all the eighteen provinces, probably in every 
county, and even in all the six ascending zones of vegetation or cli- 
mate also.
Fevf species, however, even of this most general type, 
are so very general in their distribution.
By far the larger portion of 
species have a restricted zonal range.
Many, too, which are general 
with reference to the provinces, are absent from some of the counties.
And a considerable number of species which are too widely and 
abundantly distributed to allow of their being placed under any of 
the other types, are yet rare or wholly wanting in one or more of the 
provinces ; particularly in the northerly provinces of Scotland, and 
more especially in that of the North Isles, which has a very scanty 
Flora.
The species which are thus characterized by their general 
presence and prevalence, or rare only in those tracts which are sel- 
dom visited by botanists, become familiarly known and contemned 
under the designation of " common things ;" and being much neg- 
lected, in consequence, it has often been found difficult to ascertain 
their true distribution and comparative frequency, on recorded evi- 
dence.
It is to be observed that the name of 'British type' is ap- 
plied to them, not on any hypothetical notions of their origin within 
Britain, but because such a general distribution and prevalence indi- 
cates great adaptation to the climate and other local conditions of 
this country, and entitles them to be considered thoroughly native 
788 
both in England and Scotland â€” to be Britons in the fullest significa- 
tion of the terra.
It is probable that about two-fifths of the whole 
number of British species (including ' natives,' ' denizens,' ' colonists,' 
as presently to be explained) will be referred to this, the most gene- 
ral type of distribution ; although, at present, the number cannot be 
exactly stated.
Among the more thorough examples of the type may 
be instanced the following, namely, Alnus glutinosa, Betula alba, 
Corylus Avellana, Salix caprasa, Rosa canina, Lonicera Periclyme- 
num, Hedera Helix, Cylisus scoparius, Calluna vulgaris.
Ranunculus 
acris, Cerastium viscosum, Potentilla Tormentilla, Trifolium repens, 
Stellaria media, Lotus corniculatus, Bellis perennis, Senecio vulgaris, 
Carduus palustris, Taraxacum officinale, Myosotis arvensis.
Prunella 
vulgaris, Plantago lanceolata, Polygonum aviculare, Urtica dioica, 
Potamogeton natans, Lemna minor, Juncus efFusus, Carex panicea, 
Poa annua, Festuca ovina, Anthoxanthum odoratum, Pteris aquilina, 
Polypodium vulgare, Lastraea Filix-mas.
" 2.
The E)iglish Type.
â€” The plants of this geographic type are 
distinguished from those of the British type by having their chief 
prevalence in England, and particularly in its more southern pro- 
vinces ; whence they gradually become rare in a northern direction, 
and finally (with few peculiar exceptions) find an earlier northern li- 
mit or cessation than those of the preceding type.
Their terminal 
lines are very different among themselves ; some of the species being 
entirely limited to two or three of the most southern provinces of 
England ; while other species occur in all the provinces of Britain, 
with an exception of two or three of the most northern ; the great 
majority having their limits between these two extremes.
Those 
species which extend into nearly all the provinces, except two or 
three of the northern, approximate very closely to the less general 
examples of the British type ; and, in fact, thei'e are cases where it 
becomes almost optional whether the species are to be referred to the 
one or to the other type.
To the characters of diminished frequency 
and earlier northern termination, which distinguish the species of the 
English from those of the British type, must be added that of spread- 
ing into both the eastern and the western provinces of England, and 
without any very striking difference of comparative frequency towards 
the two sides of the island, beyond that which may be caused by the 
repellent influence of the western mountains, which necessarily tend 
to banish such species as are naturally adapted to low situation, in a 
warmer and drier climate than that of our mountainous tracts.
The 
name of ' English Type ' will not be misunderstood to indicate that 
789 
all the species are peculiar to England, but is to be understood only 
as implying that the species are apparently adapted to the climate of 
England, either being restricted to that part of Britain, or being more 
prevalent there than in Scotland, As a temporary estimate, we may 
reckon the species of the English type at about one-fifth of the whole 
Flora of Britain.
Cyperus longus and Cicendia filiformis are very 
local examples of this type, if, indeed, they can be fairly referred to 
it; being restricted to a few counties southward of the Thames and 
Bristol Channel.
On the other hand, Malva moschata and Poterium 
Sanguisorba approximate to the British type in being distributed from 
the south coast of England up to the middle of Scotland.
More cha- 
racteristic examples of the English type of distribution may be cited 
in Rhamnus catharticus, Ulex nanus, Tamus communis, Bryonia di- 
oica, Hottonia palustris, Chlora perfoliata, Sison Amomum, Moenchia 
erecta, Linaria Elatine, Ranunculus parviflorus, Lamium Galeobdo- 
lon, Hordeum pratense, Alopecurus agrestis, Ceteracli officinarum.
"3.
The Scottish Type.
â€” This may be deemed the opposite of the 
English type ; the distribution of the species referred hereto being 
characterized by a northern tendency, either by absolute limitation to 
Scotland or the north of England, or otherwise by a chief prevalence 
there and increased rarity southward.
Parallel with some of the 
species referred to the English type, so some of those referred to this 
present one are quite restricted to two or three of the most northern 
provinces of Scotland ; while others abound in Scotland, and also 
spread southward, although in diminished frequency, far down Eng- 
land ; others, again, finding their southern limits between the ex- 
tremes of narrow and wide distribution.
With respect to those spe- 
cies which are most widely distributed, their diminished frequency, 
or entire absence in the southerly provinces, applies more particu- 
larly to the south-east of England, where the climate is drier, and the 
summer temperature is higher than usually experienced in the south- 
western provinces of England.
Along with this group, also, may be 
associated certain species which run out to diminished frequency, or 
early absolute cessation, northward as well as southward ; occurring 
chiefly or only in the northern provinces of England and southern 
provinces of Scotland.
Equally with the rest, these are truly plants 
of a boreal distribution and prevalence, when we consider them with 
reference to the southern provinces of England; although it may also 
be said that they are so far species of a southern distribution likewise, 
when considered with reference to the northern provinces of Scot- 
land.
From other species of the Scottish type, however, they differ 
Vol. II.
5 g 
790 
chiefly by their more restricted areas ; for their tendency to the hilly 
districts of England and the Lowlands, like those which extend still 
farther northward in Scotland, indicates a general similarity of clima- 
tal adaptation, while it strongly distinguishes them from species of 
the truly English type.
It will thus be understood that several of 
the species assigned to the Scottish type of distribution are not pre- 
valent only in Scotland ; some of them, indeed, being more prevalent 
in the northern provinces of England.
But since the majority are 
prevalent in Scotland, the name of the type is taken from that north- 
ern portion of the kingdom, as a sufficient contrast to the name 
adopted for the more southern or English type.
Perhaps not more 
than a twentieth of the whole number of British plants will come un- 
der the Scottish type.
Primula scotica and Ajuga pyramidalis are 
instances of an extremely restricted and boreal area.
Goodyera re- 
pens and Corallorhiza innata are also very partial, though less tho- 
roughly boreal with us.
Primula farinosa and Saxifraga Hirculus 
may be instanced as examples of that division of the Scottish group 
which is characterized by a comparatively early limit northward.
But more characteristic examples of the Scottish type may be men- 
tioned in Empetrum nigrum, Rubus saxatilis, Trollius europseus, Ger- 
anium sylvaticum, Trientalis europaea, Habenaria albida, Ligusticum 
scoticum, and Lithospermum maritimum.
" 4.
Highland type.
â€” 'This may be considered the boreal flora in a 
more intense degree, as respects climate, than that of the Scottish type.
The species referred hereto are distinguished from those of the Scot- 
tish type by being more especially limited to the mountains or their 
immediate vicinity.
Some of them are wholly confined to the higher 
mountains, and never descend within the agrarian region ; these being 
the 'arctics' before mentioned on page 54.
Others, though prevalent 
on the mountains, do descend also into their glens and valleys quite 
within the agrarian region.
And others, again, may occasionally be 
seen outside the mountainous tracts, particularly along the course of 
rivers which have their sources among the mountains, or even upon 
the rocks of the sea-coast.
As a group, these species are either 
restricted to the mountains or very decidedly more prevalent there.
Several of them, more especially the true arctics, are strictly peculiar 
to the Highland mountains ; while others occur also on the mountains 
of England and Wales, though less plentifully than in the Highlands 
of Scotland.
The name chosen for the type intimates their most ap- 
propriate habitat, although some of them do likewise find a suitable 
climate on the mountains of England or Wales.
It is probable that 
791 
the Highland type will comprehend about a fifteenth of the whole 
flora of Britain ; its species scarcely reaching a hundred.
But if we 
should unite the Highland and Scottish types, as one boreal type in 
contrast against the austral or English, they would together constitute 
about an eighth of the species now fairly wild in Britain.
As ex- 
amples of thoroughly Highland species, such as do not occur in any 
province southward of the Highlands, we may cite Azalea procura- 
bens, Cherleria sedoides, Veronica alpina, Alopecurus alpinus, Phleum 
alpinum, Juncus trifidus, Sibbaldia procumbens, Erigeron alpinus, and 
Gentiana nivalis.
And as examples of other species which occur like- 
wise on the more southern mountains, and mostly descend lower on 
those of the Highland provinces, we may enumerate Salix herbacea, 
Silene acaulis, Saxifraga stellaris, Oxyria reniformis, Thalictrum al- 
pinum, Luzula spicata, Juncus triglumis, Rubus Chamaemorus, Epi- 
lobium alsinifolium, Draba incana, Dryas octopetala, and Alchemilla 
alpina.
" 5.
The Germanic Type.
â€” The distribution of several species 
which might otherwise be associated with those of the English type, 
is peculiarly characterized by a tendency to the eastern side of the 
island.
Some few of these are absolutely restricted to the south-east- 
ern provinces of England, â€” Channel, Thames, Ouse, one or more ; 
while others of them extend farther northward or westward, yet de- 
cidedly diminishing in abundance in either direction.
As the creta- 
ceous deposits lie almost solely in the eastern and south-eastern pro- 
vinces of England, the ' chalk plants ' are included with the others 
referred to the present type ; although, it is to be recollected, that the 
type is primarily founded upon botanico-geographical pecuUarities, 
and not upon any geological characters.
Some of the eastern species 
extend even into Scotland ; but, for the most part, they are the spe- 
cies of England.
The name of ' Germanic ' type is not apphed with 
reference to any supposed origin from Germany, but simply as indi- 
cating the tendency of the species to a distribution connected with 
those provinces of England which are bounded by the German or 
North Sea eastward, including the Straits of Dover and upper part of 
the English Channel ; for the species of this present, and those of the 
next type, more or less intermingle in the counties of the English 
Channel.
The species which can be assigned to this type may run 
between a fifteenth and a twentieth of those which are reputed to be 
indigenous in Britain ; the number varying according to the degree of 
decrease westward which may be deemed sufficient to warrant the as- 
signment of species to the present rather than to the English type.
792 
Among the examples of the type may be instanced the following : 
namely, Frankenia lajvis, Anemone Pulsatilla, Reseda lutea, Silene noc- 
tiflora, Silene conica, Bupleurum tenuissimum, Pimpinella magna, Pu- 
licaria vulgaris, Lactuca Scariola, Atriplex pedunculata, Aceras an- 
thropophora, Ophrys aranifera, and Spartina stricta.
"6.
The Atlantic Type.
â€” Contrary to the peculiarity of distribu- 
tion which constitutes the Germanic type, there is in that of other 
species a marked tendency towards the western and south-western 
coasts or countries.
Some few species are absolutely restricted to the 
single province of the Peninsula.
Others occur also in one or more 
of the adjacent provinces.
And others, again, run far up the western 
coasts in a northerly direction, often plentifully there, and yet occur 
very rarely, or not at all, towards the eastern coasts of the island.
These species, although thus dissimilar in respect of their area and 
census, correspond in the one circumstance of having some decided 
tendency to the western or Atlantic side of the island, in contradis- 
tinction to the eastern or Germanic side.
Although there may exist 
other reasons for specially denominating some of these the ' Atlantic 
species,' the name of the type will be here understood as having re- 
ference only to their distribution within Britain itself, and by itself 
About the same number of species are likely to be referred to this 
type, as to the Germanic ; its arithmetical value being somewhere be- 
tween a fifteenth and a twentieth part of the Flora of Britain.
As 
examples, we have Siuapis monensis, Matthiola sinuata, Raphanus 
maritimus, Sedum anglicum.
Cotyledon Umbilicus, Bartsia viscosa, 
Pinguicula lusitanica.
Euphorbia Peplis, Euphorbia Portlandica, 
Scirpus Savii, â€” which occur in several counties ; also Sibthorpia eu- 
ropaea, Erica vagans.
Erica ciliaris, Physospermum cornubiense, Po- 
lycarpon tetraphyllum, Adiantum Capillus- Veneris, Cynodon Dacty- 
lon, and others which occur in very few or only single counties.
On 
pages 9 and 12, Cynodon Dactylon is inadvertently said to be found 
only in Cornwall ; that name having been overlooked in Dr. Salter's 
list of plants near Poole, in Dorset : a consequence of its alphabeti- 
cal series of names, which renders comparisons with scientifically ar- 
ranged lists so exceedingly troublesome.
" 7.
A Local or doubtful Type.
â€” Interspersed about the island, there 
are some species whose distribution is restricted to single or few 
counties.
Such species can seldom show that decided tendency to 
the east or the w^est, to the south or the north, to the mountains or 
otherwise, which would fully warrant their assignment to any one of 
the six preceding types of distribution.
In those instances where the 
793 
single or few localities occur clearly and solely within the geographic 
limits of one of the types, the plants will usually be associated with 
the group to which they thus make the nearest approach.
For in- 
stance, there can be no hesitation in assigning the extremely local 
Lychnis alpina and Oxytropis campestris to the Highland type ; and 
not much more doubt can arise respecting the propriety of placing 
Arenaria norvegica and Primula scotica in the Scottish type.
So 
also, the local Cicendia filiformis may go to the English type ; Vero- 
nica verna, to the Germanic type ; Erica A'^agans, to the Atlantic type.
But after thus disposing of a large portion of these local species, 
there are still some others left on hand, which cannot be so fairly as- 
signed to any of our six principal types, Potentilla rupestris and 
Anthericum serotinum, for instance, are peculiar to single mountains 
in North Wales.
As local western species they might be associated 
with the Atlantic type ; but the hilly and inland nature of their loca- 
lities, and their absence from the provinces of South Wales and the 
Peninsula, come inconveniently in conflict with the chief characters 
of the Atlantic type.
Draba aizoides and Cotoneaster vulgaris, found 
on the rocky coasts of Wales very locally, approximate rather nearer 
to that type, and might be associated under it, in so far as Britain is 
concerned ; and yet, if we should extend our views, so as to take in 
their distribution upon the continent of Europe, this would be found 
X a misposition.
Some other less local species have also a distribution 
which does not corres]Jond with that of any of the six types speci- 
fied ; their localities being restricted to calcareous rocks, and occur- 
ring in such positions as not to place them properly under one of 
those types.
Examples may be mentioned in Draba muralis and 
Hutchinsia petraea, the distribution of which is strictly neither east- 
ern nor western, northern nor southern ; and, though they are in 
some degree hill plants, yet they are certainly not Highland species ; 
while their very limited area separates them as clearly from the Bri- 
tish or general type.
Eriocaulon septangulare is another anomaly, 
which was associated with some very few other species into the ' He- 
bridean type ' of the former work.
But as these few did not make a 
congruous group, and were numerically too insignificant to be set up 
against those of the other six types, the Hebridean is here discarded, 
and its half-dozen species divided between the Scottish and Local 
types." 
In connexion with this subject, we are bound to notice some remarks 
comprised by Mr. Watson in an Appendix to the present volume.
In the ' Phytologist,' we have, on several occasions, thought it neccs- 
794 
sary to mention an hypothesis promulged by Mr. Forbes, at the 
meeting of the British Association, held at Cambridge, in 1845, and 
bearing on the distribution of plants in Great Britain : this hypothesis 
we have always mentioned with disapprobation, considering that the 
data used in its support were Mr. Watson's and not Mr. Forbes's, and, 
moreover, that no such conclusions as those advanced by Mr. Forbes 
were deducible from the data.
We now call on our readers to examine 
dispassionately Mr. Watson's observations, and to judge for them- 
selves : we claim no weight or authority for our own remarks, but wish 
all our readers to form their own unbiassed judgment : we cannot 
afford space for the entire Appendix, and will not venture to garble 
or abbreviate : our readers are referred to the book itself, which all 
botanists must of necessity peruse, and which, we rejoice to say, has 
taken the matter entirely out of our jurisdiction.
No expression of 
ours, in regai'd to Mr. Forbes, has originated in any other motive than 
the desire to protect a favorite science from the injurious effects of 
mixing the ideal with the real ; and this course we hope to pursue, in 
all cases, without fear and without favour.
The public acts of public 
men are public property ; and it were not merely an act of cowardice, 
but of dishonesty, to refrain from the candid expression of opinion 
concerning them.
It now only remains for us to give an example of Mr. Watson's 
work, and to explain the areas as defined by the author.

The distribution of this species cannot be 
satisfactorily given ; partly, because the name has been misapplied, 
and false localities consequently introduced into books ; partly, be- 
cause it is doubtful where the true species is wild, and where it exists 
795 
only as an introduced plant.
I have only one locality for the Penin- 
sula; namely, at its northern extremity, on the authority of the Flora 
Bathoniensis, which questions the true nativity there.
Again, some- 
what unexpectedly, I find the name marked in a list of Isle of Wight 
plants, which Dr. Bromfield kindly checked for me, before leaving 
England ; and that being my sole authority for the second province, 
I should have preferred to ascertain from Dr. B.
(now abroad) whether 
the mark was intentionally or inadvertently affixed to the name of 
'nutans:' perhaps it ought to stand so; for Dr. Bromfield rarely is 
inadvertent in his botanical doings.
Next, we have the third province 
to consider ; and here, on the cliffs of Kent, some species certainly 
does grow ; and to which the various names of * nutans,' ' italica,' 
' patens,' and ' paradoxa,' have been applied, in a medley of confusion 
which I ara not just now prepared to unravel.
S. nutans is reported 
also from Hertfordshire, by Messrs.
Webb and Coleman, ' probably 
introduced.' For the province of Ouse, a locality has been published 
' in the corn, between Harrington and Wakerley,' on authority of 
Morton's History of Northamptonshire ; but this species is not a corn- 
field plant, and some other was more likely the one seen there.
No- 
body appears to have confirmed the correctness of the Rev. W.
Wood's 
locality of ' Hawkestone,' in Shropshire, which is the only one in the 
fifth province, as far as my notes go ; but as the S.
nutans grows in 
Dovedale, on the Derbyshire side of a narrow stream, it may also 
grow on the Staffordshire side of the same stream, which will give the 
species a ' local habitation ' just within the county limit of the Severn 
province; though, in respect of physical geography, that part of Staf- 
fordshire belongs of right to the Trent province.
The provinces of 
North Wales and Trent are not disputed.
That of Yorkshire requires 
corroboration ; the single locality, ' rocks about Knaresborough,' 
resting on old and not very safe authority.
' Salisbury Crags,' by 
Edinburgh, is the locality given with specimens, which are labelled 
* S.
italica,' from the Edinburgh Botanical Society ; but surely that 
species must have been sown there, or it would have been earlier dis- 
covered by some of the numerous good botanists with which that city 
is always supplied.
The counties of Fife, Forfar and Kincardine, 
have been several times reported on ample authority.
S. nutans 
seems best to associate with the Anglo-Cambrian group of the Local 
type.
Its head-quarters are on the limestones of North Wales and 
Derbyshire, with several outposts or outlying localities, of which the 
south-east coast of the East Highlands appears to be the strongest.
As to Orkney, it stands only on the faith of Lowe's list, and cannot be 
796 
received without additional authority.
The stations on the borders 
of the East Highlands, and perhaps those among the hills of Derby- 
shire, carry its range almost within the superagrarian zone.
I have 
not so indicated the zonal range, because those northern localities 
seem quite restricted to the coast line, where the climate is hardly 
that of the upper zone." 
Explanation of the foregoing.
" The first line shows, by their numbers, the provinces within which 
the species has been ascertained or reported to grow.
The uninclosed 
numbers show those provinces in which it is so far wild or established 
as to be fairly considered a British species â€” native, denizen, or colo- 
nist, as presently to be explained.
The numbers which are enclosed 
by curves, thus ( ), will indicate the provinces within which the spe- 
cies can scarcely yet be deemed really wild, although existent there.
Those numbers which are enclosed by angles, thus [ ], will refer to 
the provinces within which the species has been reported to occur, 
although under circumstances of doubt which render some confirma- 
tion necessary ; most of the provinces so distinguished being probably 
erroneous.
" The second and third lines give the north and south limits of the 
species in Britain, by naming those counties in which occur their ex- 
treme localities.
The selection of counties to be cited is made with 
reference both to the east and the west sides of the island ; whereby 
to convey some idea of the relation of the species to longitude also.
Thus, for instance, the county of Glamorgan is named in the north 
limit of the Clematis ; although the other two counties, Salop and 
Norfolk, are much more northerly.
This is done, because, so far as 
yet ascertained, the county of Glamorgan is the north limit of the 
Clematis in the longitude of Wales ; the alpine character of the two 
Welch provinces being unfavourable to a shrub which requires a 
warm summer.
Our lists of Cornish plants being yet very incomplete, 
Devon will be named as the south limit of many species which doubt- 
less do grow also in Cornwall.
" The fourth line is devoted to a sort of census of the species.
This 
can only be given approximately, by estimating the number of pro- 
vinces and of counties within which the species is deemed likely to 
occur.
It is probable that the number of provinces will be set down 
correctly for the majority of the species ; though there may still remain 
a considerable minority, for which the number of provinces will ulti- 
mately be found less exact.
The lists of species for South Wales, 
797 
the Lake Province, and the North and West Highlands, are still in- 
completely made out ; and there are several dubious species, whose 
provincial distribution can be very imperfectly known at present.
The 
number of un-enclosed figures in the first line, in contrast with the 
number given as the estimate, will show where additions have been 
made to the latter, on assumed probabilities.
For counties, the esti- 
mated number will often be given much higher than has been actually 
ascertained ; more especially for the common species, which are sel- 
dom noticed, except in local floras and catalogues which profess to 
include everything.
The census for counties is estimated by, first, 
reckoning up those within which the species has been ascertained to 
occur ; secondly, reckoning those from which it is believed to be ab- 
sent; and, thirdly, adding the rest to one or other side, according to 
presumed probabilities.
Though much is here assumed, particularly 
with respect to the distribution of the common species, yet the result 
of this estimate, it is believed, will come very near the truth ; the 
author's attention having been so long directed to the distribution of 
plants in Britain, that he can usually guess pretty accurately whether 
any given species will or will not be found in any given county.
Of 
course, there are some exceptions to the accuracy of such guesses, 
especially in the cases of confused or neglected species, such as 
CEnanthe peucedanifolia or Ranunculus Lenormandi.
As an exam- 
ple, where much has been assumed without certain knowledge, the 
census of Stellaria media may be cited.
On putting together all his 
local lists, the author cannot show, on authority, that this very com- 
mon plant grows in so many as sixty counties ; but he unhesitatingly 
assumes it to occur in every county.
The whole number of counties 
is taken at 82; some small counties (Rutland, Kinross, &c.) being 
sunk into those adjacent, and some isles or groups of isles (Man, 
Hebrides, &c.) being reckoned as counties of themselves.
The inter- 
mediate numbers, between 15 and 80, are taken in steps of 5 or 10, 
since the use of units would there be only an affectation of exactness ; 
and the nature of the test throws the larger proportion of the species 
towards one or other extreme of the scale.
The series of numbers 
actually used in the census of counties runs thus : â€” 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 
8, 9, 10, 12, 15, 20, 25, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 75, 80, 81, 82.
" The fifth line indicates the range of latitude and the geographic 
type.
To show the limits in latitude, those figures are used which 
correspond with the mathematical lines on maps, between which all 
the known localities are situate.
No fractions of degrees are used.
Thus, in marking the range of Clematis Vitalba, as 50 â€” 53, it is not 
Vol. n.
5h 
798 
intended that localities for the species do certainly occur under the 
mathematical lines of 50Â° and 53Â°, but simply that they occur more 
southerly than 51Â°, more northerly than 52Â°.
The native localities of 
the Clematis all occur under the 51st, 52nd, and 53rd degrees ; and 
thus the first lines which indicate whole degrees, south and north of 
the extreme localities, are those of 50Â° and 53Â°.
Some little uncer- 
tainty will arise occasionally in applying the figures.
For example, 
the parallel of 59Â° crosses the Orkney Isles, and there are no records 
adequate to show which of the Orkney species, if any, do not pass to 
the northward of that line.
In this uncertainty, to distinguish those 
of Orkney from the species which cease in Sutherland or Caithness, 
all the former are assumed to be bounded northward by the line of 
60Â°.
At the other end of Britain, the Cornish species are assumed to 
be all on the north side of 50Â°, notwithstanding that the Lizard Point 
is rather short of that line.
Of the Scilly flora, almost nothing is yet 
known; and hence the parallel of 49Â° is scarcely used in this work.
" The types of distribution have been explained in former pages of 
this volume.
It may be as well again to remind those who use this 
work, that such a mode of grouping species, though founded upon 
fact, can be only a rough view or approximation to nature ; many of 
the species being so intermediate in the character of their distribution, 
as to render it doubtful, if not optional, to which of the types they 
should be referred.
The first species of the series, the conspicuous 
Clematis, is an example of a doubtful type ; while the second one, 
the easily overlooked Thalictrum alpinum, is an unquestionable ex- 
ample of the Highland type.
" The sixth line gives the region or regions, and the zonal range of 
the species.
The regions and zones have also been explained in 
former pages.
In the case of species which occur in both the Arctic 
and Agrarian zones, an abbreviation is made into the two initial letters 
* A.
A.' The zonal range is indicated by naming the highest and 
lowest zones inhabited by the species, if growing in more than one 
of them, as is more usually the case.
" The seventh line is intended to show the lowest ascertained limit 
of the species.
Comparatively few British species are wholly restricted 
to localities much above the level of the shores.
Hence, for the 
greater number, the lower limits are indicated with reference to the 
most southerly provinces within which they descend nearly or quite to 
the sea level.
The expression ' coast level ' is not to be construed as 
meaning the actual level of the tides, but simply low situations not 
much above the sea.
For species which do not descend to the coast 
799 
level in any part of Britain, the lowest altitude is indicated by yards, 
and usually reckoned by steps of 50 yards.
" The eighth line shows the highest limit ascertained for the spe- 
cies, also by steps of 50 yards, without affecting more minute exact- 
ness.
There are many plants of the plains or low grounds, not 
ascending the mountains, the upper limits of which can only be 
guessed in general terms.
Thus, for example, the true upper limits 
of the Clematis, Euonymus, Tamus, &c., not having been exactly as- 
certained, they will be indicated in general terms, at 100 or 200 
yards.
" The ninth line is intended to show the range of mean annual 
temperature under which the species grows in Britain.
It will easily 
be understood that this cannot be more than an approximation to the 
true climate.
The estimate is made in the following manner.
The 
mean annual temperature of the air (that of the ground being nearly 
the same), on the south-west coast of England, is taken at 52Â° of 
Fahrenheit's scale; that of the south-east coast, at 51Â°; the estuaries 
of the Thames and Severn, at 50Â°; those of the Humber and Mersey, 
at 49Â° ; those of the Forth and Clyde, at 48Â° ; the extremities of the 
Caledonian Canal, at 47Â°; the north coast of Scotland, at 46Â°.
One 
degree is deducted from inland localities under the same latitude, and 
one degree also for each hundred yards of elevation above the level of 
the sea.
In applying this rule to particular species, however, some 
slight allowance has been made for situation.
It is probable that the 
temperature of the atmosphere, with us, decreases more rapidly than 
one degree for one hundred yards of elevation, while that of the earth 
decreases less rapidly.
On the Highland mountains, between 3000 
and 4000 feet, the temperature of springs varies but little with altitude, 
during the summer months; being usually 37Â° or 38Â°, where the exit 
of the water is unimpeded by vegetation.
" The tenth line, continued into a paragraph, is intended to show 
the civil claims and local situation of the species, in accordance with 
a scale of terms ; also to give any other brief notices which may seem 
desirable or necessary.
The first word is one taken from the follow- 
ing series of terms, used to express the civil claims of the species : â€” 
" 1.
Native.
â€” Apparently an aboriginal British species ; there being 
little or no reason for supposing it to have been 
introduced by human agency.
Examples : Cory- 
lus, Calluna, Bellis, Teesdalia.
" 2.
Denizen.
â€” At present maintaining its habitats, as if a native, 
without the aid of man, yet liable to some sus- 
800 
picion of having been originally introduced.
Examples : Aconitum, Paeonia, Viola odorata, 
Impatiens Noli-me-tangere.
3. Colonist.
â€” A weed of cultivated land or about houses, and sel- 
dom found except in places where the ground 
has been adapted for its production by the opera- 
tions of man ; with some tendency, however, to 
appear also on the shores, landslips, &c.
Exam- 
ples : Adonis, Papaver, Agrostemma, Melilotus 
leucantha.
" 4.
Alien.
â€” Now more or less established, but either presumed or 
certainly known to have been originally introduced 
from other countries.
Examples : Sempervivum, 
Mimulus, Hesperis, Camelina.
" 5.
Incognita.
â€” Reported as British, but requiring confirmation as 
such.
Some of these have been reported through 
mistakes of the species, as Ranunculus gramineus.
Others may have been really seen in the character 
of temporary stragglers from gardens, as Gentiana 
acaulis.
Others cannot now be found in the lo- 
calities published for them, as Tussilago alpina 
and other species, reported by or from Mr. George 
Don ; though it is not improbable that some of 
these may yet be found again.
A few may have 
existed for a time, and become extinct, as Echi- 
nophora spinosa, 
" 6.
Hibernian, or Sarnian.
â€” Native, or apparently so, in Ireland, 
or in the Channel Isles, though not found in 
Britain proper." 
These long and explanatory quotations will give the reader a better 
idea of Mr. Watson's work than any description of ours.
The present 
is a first volume, and contains the author's observations on 503 spe- 
cies, beginning with the Ranunculaceae and ending with the Umbel- 
liferse.
We have only to add, that we wish it that success which the 
labour bestowed on it most assuredly deserves.

Extracts from the Proceedings of the Berwickshire Naturalists' Club.
" Description of an Agaric netv to the British Flora.
Agaricus ca- 
peratus.
â€” Pileus convex, orbiculate, obtusely umbonate, even, very 
dry, of a uniform gall-stone yellow, usually paler about the top, 
covered with a mealy powder of the same colour, which, in some 
places, is gathered into an imperfect scaliness, the margin inflected, 
entire or more or less sinuated : veil as thick as writing paper, per- 
sistent, stretched between the margin and stem, to which it is closely 
attached, thickly covered with the same powder as the pileus, but 
more distinctly squammulose : ^esh thick, solid and firm, white, not 
changing colour, mild and insipid in taste.
Gills numerous, adnate, 
four in a set, dry and smooth, sienna-yellow, juiceless : sporules el- 
liptical, very light honey-yellow.
Stem cylindrical, as thick as a 
man's thumb, erect and solid, the root rounded but not bulbous, 
whitened with the mycelia, the shaft of the same colour as the pileus, 
paler on the lower half, covered with the ochraceous powder or 
slightly squammulose, the flesh white, yellowish under the epidermis ; 
the portion of stalk within the veil is pale, a very little fibrilose, but 
not powdered.
Diameter of the pileus 3 inches ; height of the stem 
5 inches, the diameter nearly an inch ; breadth of the gills 2-lOths.
From the woods at Anton's-hill, Sept.
16, 1845.
" This truly magnificent agaric was ascertained satisfactorily to be 
the Agaricus caperatus of Fl. Dan.
t. 1675, by the Rev. M.
J. Berke- 
ley, to whom a specimen was sent.
It is not the Agaricus caperatus 
of the English Flora, nor the Agaricus pudicus of Bulliard ; and is a 
beautiful addition to the already extensive list of British species, for 
which we are indebted to the researches of Miss Anne Hunter, an 
honorary member of the Club.
The spores, Mr. Berkeley says, are 
very peculiar.
' Its greatest peculiarity,' says Miss Anne Hunter, 
*is its being so profusely covered over its pileus, curtain, and stem, 
with a yellowish powder, in such quantities as to make it disagreeable 
to gather, as gloves and everything it came in contact with was 
covered.
And I am much struck with the toughness and perma- 
nency of the curtain, which remains after the pileus has attained its 
full size.' 
" When small and young the pileus is obtusely campanulate, but in 
other respects it does not differ from the mature plant.
Miss Hunter 
has found it on one spot only in the wood behind the house of An- 
ton's-hill, and there sparingly.
Like most of its genus it is eaten 
greedily by slugs and the maggot of a dipterous fly; and it seems to 
802 
be, says Miss Hunter, * a most favourite food of a sort of beetle,' 
which permits very few specimens to attain maturity without great 
mutilation." 
" On the Medical Properties of our Geraniums.
By Dr. Johnston.
â€” A few weeks ago my friend Dr. Edgar brought a plant to me to 
have it named.
It was a dried fragment of Geranium pratense.
The 
Doctor told me that a person resident in or about Ford had acquii'ed 
great local fame, for the cure of fluxes in general, and the only remedy 
used was an infusion of this Geranium.
One dozen stalks are 
* masked' in a pint of boiling water, and of this two ounces are taken 
three times a-day.
Dr. Edgar's interest had been raised by the cure 
of a patient of his own, who had been greatly reduced by a chronic 
diarrhoea that had resisted the ordinary medicinal treatment, but 
yielded speedily to the geranium infusion.
He felt relief from the 
second dose, and continuing to take it for three or four days, he was 
permanently cured.
It was said to be a good medicine in the 
diarrhcea of teething children, and is easily taken by them, for the 
taste is ' like tea without sugar, rather sweeter.' 
" It is very likely that this remedy is inferior, for general use, to 
more powerful vegetable and mineral astringents of modern introduc- 
tion into practice, but I think it worth while to bring the subject be- 
fore the Club, since it relates to a matter of local interest ; and there 
are cases in which it is well for a medical man to have a wide range 
of medicines to ring the changes upon.
No Geranium has now a 
place in any British Pharmacopa3ia,* but several species hold a con- 
spicuous place in the old Herbals.
Of Geranium pratense and its 
immediate allies, Gerarde says, 'none of these plants are now in vse 
in physicke ; yet Fuschius sayeth that cranes-bill with the blew floure 
(G.
pratense) is an excellent thing to heale wounds.' Our author 
speaks in very different terms of our commoner species, Ger. molle and 
dissectura.
' The herbe and roots dried,' says he, ' beaten into most 
fine powder, and given halfe a spoonful fasting, and the like quanti- 
tie to bedwards in red wine, or old claret, for the space of one and 
twentie days together, cureth miraculously ruptures or burstings, as 
myselfe have often proved, whereby I haue gotten crownes and credit : 
if the ruptures be in aged persons, it shall be needful to adde thereto 
the powder of red snailes (those without shels) dried in an ouen, in 
number nine, which fortifie the herbs in such sort, that it neuer faileth, 
* Several Geiania are introduced into Dr. Stoakes' ' Botanical Materia Medica,' 
but witliuut any indication of their properties.
803 
although the rupture be great and of long continuance : it likewise 
profiteth much those that are wounded into the body, and the decoc- 
tion of the herbe made in wine, prevaileth mightily in healing inward 
wounds, as myselfe haue likewise proved.' (Historic of Plants, p.
939).
" Ray also furnishes us with a proof of the medicinal virtue of the 
Gerania.
When he tells us that Geranium molle and robertanium 
are added to vulnerary potions and fomentations to stay fluxes and ef- 
fusions of blood, and to relieve the pains of cholick, and of the stone 
and gravel, he merely gives us a summary of preceding observation; 
but he speaks from his own knowledge, when he details the case of 
his host at Carlisle, who, subject to frequent severe paroxysms of pain 
from calculus, found in nothing so much relief as from a decoction of 
Ger. robertanium.
(Syn. p.
361.) In a subsequent work, after re- 
peating its virtues as a vulnerary herb, Ray mentions that a decoction 
of the same species is used by shepherds to cure their cattle passing 
bloody urine.
(Hist.
Plant, ii.
p. 1059).
" Geiger informs us that G.
pratense and sanguineum were formerly 
ofiicinal, the root and herb being used, both having an unpleasant 
odour, and a very astringent taste, which is contrary to Dr. Edgar's 
information.
Other compilers repeat the same tale of the astringency 
of the Gerania in general, and of their popular use in fluxes and dis- 
eases of relaxation ; but it is foreign to my purpose to enter farther on 
the subject than what is sufficient to show that the virtue ascribed 
to our district species is not imaginary." 
Occurrence of Poly podium calcareum at Coldwell Rocks, Hereford- 
shire.
By W.
H. PuRCHAS, Esq.
In the ' Phytologist ' for October last is a blunder of mine, which I 
will thank you to correct.
I have, at page 650, said that Polypodium 
Diyopteris grows plentifully at the Coldwell Rocks ; it should be P.
calcareum.
The Penyard station only belongs to P.
Dryopteris.

Notice of ' Outlines of Structural and Physiological Botany.
By 
Arthur Henfrey, F.L.S. Parts III.
and IV.
Organs of Re- 
production and General Physiology.' 
We have already spoken of the prior parts of this little work with 
approbation : the portion now before us confirms the good opinion 
then entertained, although perhaps it has somewhat less claim to the 
title of originality.
In compilations of this kind, great advantage ac- 
crues from the author's familiarity with the subject itself, not simply 
with its bibliography ; and this familiarity was, as we thought, parti- 
cularly evident in Part I.
It is less the case now ; Mr. Henfrey seems 
to trust the eyes of others in preference to his own : this probably re- 
sults from timidity on the part of the lecturer, â€” a needless fear, for his 
audience are not stern critics, and would be as well pleased to trust 
the personal observations of a Henfrey as those of a Martins or Ge- 
lesnow.
Experience has shown us, that of all classes of Her Majesty's 
subjects, medical students are the least addicted to criticise the au- 
thority ; all they care for is, to obtain that very superficial acquaintance 
with the subject, and those authentic certificates of attendance, which 
serve as vouchers for the possession of botanical knowledge.
Mr. Henfrey explains on the wrapper, that the work was " under- 
taken in consequence of the pressing want of some Manual which will 
put the Student in possession of the results of the numerous and im- 
portant researches which have been published during the last few 
years in this department of Science.
The fact of these being scat- 
tered through various journals, English and foreign, or contained in 
the voluminous works which testify so strongly to the industry of 
German observers, places them beyond the reach of many who are 
interested in them, and especially of those whose time is so valuable 
as that of Medical Students." 
And for such a purpose we cordially recommend this little volume : 
it is concise, yet explanatory, â€” scientific, without pedantry or affecta- 
tion ; and we hope its circulation will not be confined to that peculiar 
class for which it appears to have been designed, but that it will work 
its way into other schools than those of medicine, and find a welcome 
in the popular as well as professional lecture-room.
It is the very^ 
thing for the popular lecturers that perambulate the outskirts of Lon- 
don, and will save them a world of blunders, and their audience from 
a world of trash.

The Thorea ramosissima was discovered by Mr. William Mc. Ivor, 
of the Kew Gardens, "in the bed of the river, above Walton Bridge, 
at low water exposed to view abundantly, and where covered 
with clear water showing itself as a vast gelatinous mass of a pur- 
plish-black colour, yet exhibiting its filamentous internal structure in 
the same way as the Batrachosperma do, when seen with the naked 
eye." (No. 61, p.
31).
Although not relating to a British species, the following account of 
a Brazilian representative of a British genus is curious, and worth 
extracting.
The account of it is introduced into the Journal from 
Gardner's Travels : " We shall lastly mention the beautiful and sin- 
gular Utricularia nelumbifolia (Gard.), remarkable no less for its 
large size, 2 to 2^^ feet high, than for its place of growth.
Like our 
bladder-roots, it is aquatic, but is only found ' growing in the water 
which collects in the hollow bases of the leaves of a large Tillandsia, 
that inhabits abundantly an arid, rocky part of the Organ Mountains, 
at an elevation of about 5000 feet above the level of the sea.
Besides 
the ordinary method, by seed, the Utricularia is propagated by run- 
ners, which it throws out from the base of the flower-stem ; this run- 
ner is always found directing itself towards the nearest Tillandsia, 
when it inserts its point in the water, and gives origin to a new plant, 
which, in its turn, emits another shoot.
In this manner not less than 
six plants may be seen united, each deriving support from the water 
contained in as many separate plants of Tillandsia.' In our plants, 
again, there are no leaves ; but bladders (as the name implies) among 
the roots, which enable the plant to float and bring its blossoms above 
the surface of the water.
In the Brazilian species there are the blad- 
dered roots ; and, besides, peltate leaves, three inches across, on 
long footstalks ; while the flower-stem bears numerous large purple 
flowers." (No. 62, p.
57).
807 
The paper by Mr. Mitten on the roots of Thesium linophylhun is 
highly interesting.
The author believes the roots of this and other 
species of the same genus to be parasitically attached to the roots of 
various other plants among which it grows.
Should this view turn 
out to be correct, we may look for parasitical attachments in the roots 
of some other plants, whose roots form tubercles more or less re- 
sembling those of the Thesium.
We gain, too, by Mr. Mitten's dis- 
covery, a collateral support to Dr. Lindley's position of the Santala- 
ceaB (the natural order to which the Thesium belongs) in the same 
alliance with Loranthaceae (the natural order which includes the Vis- 
cum and other parasites).
We shall copy a part of the paper, expla- 
natory of Mr. Mitten's investigations, as a separate article.
The paper by Dr. Dickie, on the Algae found at various altitudes 
in the Highlands, is an useful commencement of its subject ; but the 
facts can be received only as isolated facts at present ; the generali- 
zation of them into a numerical table being surely too premature for 
much reliance.
The author finds 15 species at 3000 feet, 16 species 
at 2000 feet, 37 species at 1000 feet, 68 species about Aberdeen (at 
and near the sea-level) ; the whole number of British species in the 
14 genera being 78.
Of the other papers in these Nos. the interest can be deemed only 
very partial ; that is to say, the papers may have interest respectively 
for small sections of the botanical world, though none of them can be 
deemed of general interest.
For instance, fifty consecutive pages de- 
voted to descriptions of Lichens from distant countries, will hardly 
be cut open by one in ten of the subscribers to the Journal, although 
novel contributions to science, and necessary records of its facts.

" On the Economy of the Roots of Thesium linophylkfm.'" 
" By William Mitten, Esq." 
(Extracted from the ' London Journal of Botany ' for March, 1847).
" The remarkable nature of the root of Thesium linophyllum has 
apparently hitherto altogether escaped attention.
Indeed, from the 
general appearance of the plant, there is nothing to excite suspicion ; 
nor will there be any trace left of its parasitical attachment to the 
roots of surrounding plants unless the roots are taken up with the 
5 I 2 
808 
greatest care.
The very brittle roots of the Thesium itself, and the 
closely interwoven roots of the many plants which compose the turf 
of the chalk hills, render the extrication of a perfect specimen a la- 
bour requiring no small degree of patience.
The root of Thesium, 
after descending into the turf for about an inch, becomes repeatedly 
divided, and spreads for many inches in various directions.
It is 
nearly white, and thus contrasts strongly with the dark epidermis of the 
roots of the generality of its supporters.
On coming in contact vv'ith 
the root of its future support, the root of Thesium produces a hemi- 
spherical tubercle, which firmly fixes itself; while from its centre pro- 
trudes a tongue-like process (spongiole), which penetrates into the 
very heart of its supporter, often causing very considerable derange- 
ment in its tissues.
After the perfection of the first tubercle, the root 
is continued from the side of the tubercle, so as to give it the appear- 
ance of having been formed laterally, and proceeds at greater or less 
intervals to form more tubercles in the same manner on the same or 
neighbouring roots.
On the larger roots of its supporters it is not 
usual to find more than one or two tubercles ; and these are mostly 
large : the largest I have seen being about the eighth of an inch in 
diameter ; but on the fibrous roots of grasses and other small plants 
they are very small, and may be fi-equently found succeeding each 
other so quickly as to resemble a string of beads.
" Like Cuscuta, our species of Thesium appears to be by no means 
particular in the selection of its supporters ; and I have ascertained 
its attachment to the roots of the following plants, namely, Anthyllis 
vulneraria, Thymus Serpyllum,.
Lotus corniculatus, Daucus Carota, 
Scabiosa succisa, Carex glauca, and some grasses.
It is probable 
that a single plant of Thesium subsists, at the same time, on the roots 
of the whole of the plants above enumerated.
" Through the kindness of Mr. Borrer I have been able to examine 
the specimens published in Reichenbach's 'Flora Exsiccata ;' and I 
find the roots of Thesium alpinum {Linn.), T.
ebracteatum [Hayne), 
T. rostratum {Koch), and T.
liuophyllum [Linn.), to have precisely 
the same structure as that of our own species.
Unfortunately the 
roots of the other species contained in this collection were too imper- 
fect to afford any information ; but from the very close relationship 
of all the European species, there is good ground to infer that they 
are all of the same parasitical nature."

Note on Cynodan dactylon at Keiv Green.
By Thomas Meehan, Esq.
In an early number of the * Phy tologist ' I observed Kew Green 
noticed as a station for Cynodon dactylon.
Many botanists to whom 
I mentioned the circumstance expressed doubts as to its being really 
indigenous there, or that it was anything more than an escape from 
the Botanic Garden.
I had an opportunity of examining the given 
station personally last autumn, and found the plant confined to about 
a square yard of ground, in the east corner of the Green, where I 
have no doubt it springs from a stray plant or seeds at no very dis- 
tant date.
From the creeping nature of its roots it will doubtless soon spread 
over a good extent of ground, and if left undisturbed, become fairly 
naturalized.

During a cruise on the coasts of the Mediterranean in the summer 
of 1843, 1 took much pleasure in noting down, as often as I happened 
to meet with them, every old acquaintance familiar to me as a plant 
indigenous to Britain.
I know not whether you would deem this catalogue worthy of a 
page in the ' Phytologist, but thinking that perhaps it might be of 
812 
some interest, as tending in a measure to illustrate the range and dis- 
persion of species, I have ventured to enclose it to you.
The numbers affixed are intended to give some idea of the relative 
abundance or scarcity of each plant.

BOTANICAL SOCIETY OF EDINBURGH.
Thursday, March 11th, 1847.
â€” Professor Balfour in the chair.
Donations to the museum were announced from Mr. William 
M'lvor, Royal Gardens, Kew, and Mr. John Laing, Experimental 
Garden, Edinburgh.
The following communications were read : â€” 
1. List of plants collected in the neighourhood of Auchincaim, 
Kirkcudbrightshire, in July and August, 1846.
By W.
Wells, Esq., 
communicated by Sir Wm. Jardine, Bart.
The author enumerated 
the plants which he had noticed in the district named, among which 
were many rare and some interesting Alpine species.
Among the 
latter several were considered as dubious, and Sir William Jardine 
was requested to communicate with Mr. Wells, and endeavour to 
procure specimens from the localities mentioned, in order to authen- 
ticate them.
2. Description of a new species of Dawsonia.
By Dr. Greville.
814 
This spieijuiu moss, of which a specimen and aiawmg were exuiuiieu, 
has been named D.
superba, by Dr. Greville.
It was received among 
specimens from Australia ; the specimen exhibited was fourteen 
inches high, with leaves fully an inch in length.
3. Notice of Palms at present in flower in the Royal Botanic Gar- 
den.
By Dr. Balfour.
He described Livistona chinensis, Mart., 
and exhibited a specimen of the flowering spadix, and a drawing of 
the plant.
The plant in the garden is about thirty-six years old, 
twenty-five feet high, and the stem at ' the base has a diameter of 
twenty-two inches.
The leaves are upwards of thirteen feet long, and 
the blade of the leaf seven feet across ; the spadices four to four-and- 
a-half feet long.
It is believed that this is the first time the palm has 
flowered in Britain.
Dr. B.
exhibited the spadix and flowering stem 
of Euterpe montana, Graham, or mountain cabbage-palm; and stated 
that the plant in the garden used to fruit regularly, but of late years 
no fruit has been produced, although it continues to flower abun- 
dantly.
The palm is now thirty feet in height.
He also mentioned 
that a specimen of Chameerops humilis, or European fan-palm, in the 
garden, which has for many years produced starainiferous flowers 
only, had this season produced staminiferous and pistilliferous flow- 
ers, and that the fruit was apparently perfect.
Dr. 5alfour stated that he had obtained information that the Lu- 
zula nivea, discovered last year in a wood near Broomhall, by Dr.
Dewar, had been planted there by the former gardener, so that it can 
have no claim to rank as a British plant.
The following gentlemen were admitted ordinary members : Nicol- 
son C.
Mackenzie, Esq., 4, Hill Square; Luiz A.
da Camara, Esq., 
62, Hanover Street, Edinburgh; and Thomas Inraan, Esq., M.D.,

The following donations were announced : â€” 
' Cybele Britannica,' vol.
i., by Mr. Hewett Watson, presented 
by the author ; ' Outlines of Botany ' (Parts 3 and 4), by Mr. A.
Henfrey, presented by the author ; ' Journal of the Royal Agricultu- 
ral Society of England,' presented by that Society ; ' On the Preven- 
815 
tion and Treatment of the Potato Disease,' by Dr. Parkin, presented 
by the author.
Mr. T.
Burnet, of Newcastle-upon-Tyne, Mr. F.
H. Goulding, of 
King William Street, Strand, Dr. Farran, of Stradbally, Waterford, 
Ireland, Mr, J.
W. G.
Gutch, of Great Portland Street, Marylebone, 
and Mrs. Riley, of Papplewick, near Nottingham, were elected mem- 
bers.
Mr. Reynolds, the treasurer, brought forward the subject of the 
testimonial presented by the members to Mr. G.
E. Dennes, the se- 
cretary of the society, and bore testimony in warm language to the 
indefatigable zeal and great services of that gentleman in the cause 
of science in general, and more particularly in promoting the interests 
of the society during the many years that he had devoted his time 
gratuitously to the labours of his office.
The testimonial consisted 
of a portrait of Mr. Dennes, painted in oils, by Mrs. Carpenter, and 
which he had re-presented to the society, to be placed in their rooms.
The Chairman and several members concurred fully in the obser- 
vations of the treasurer.
The Seceetary returned thanks in suitable terms for the gratifying 
manner in which his services were appreciated.
A letter was read from Dr. Parkin, accompanying a copy of his 
work on the prevention and treatment of the potato disease.
It 
alluded to the value of charcoal as a preventive of the disease, and 
mentioned some experiments in which the development of carbonic 
acid, by the mutual decomposition of muriate of soda and carbonate 
of lime in the soil, was attended with the best results in producing a 
healthy crop.
A paper was also read from Mr. W.
Taylor, F.L.S., on the same 
subject.
Mr. Taylor appeared to attribute the disease to atmospheric 
causes, and not to any diminished vitality produced by over-cultiva- 
tion, and in proof of the latter not being the origin of the disease, he 
mentioned that the Solanum, or wild potato, was found in America 
to be as much diseased as the cultivated varieties.
The Chairman said he hoped it would go forth that the theory at- 
tributing the disease to the ravages of a particular kind of insect, and 
which had been promulgated with the most unceasing and unaccount- 
able pertinacity, was repudiated by every scientific man whose opi- 
nion was entitled to any weight.
Mr. Smee had been challenged to 
attend their meetings and defend his theory, but he had not done so.
He mentioned this subject because the manner in which articles were 
forced into local newspapers in every part of the kingdom, describing 
816 
the cause of the disease to have been satisfactorily ascertained, when 
scientific men actually knew nothing whatever about it, in his opi- 
nion, was calculated to produce very considerable mischief.
He 
even saw it stated in a leading article in the ' Times ' a few days ago, 
as a settled fact, that the potato disease was caused by the Aphis 
vastator, and yet he had been unable to find a single scientific man, 
capable of trustworthy investigation, who gave the slightest counte- 
nance to such an absurdity.
The chairman, in conclusion, mentioned 
tha names of several of the leading botanists and naturalists of 
France, Belgium, America, and England, who were all opposed to 
Mr. Smee's theory.
Dr. Ayres said, in allusion to Dr. Parkin's publication, that he 
did not think the action of muriate of soda upon carbonate of lime 
would extricate carbonic acid, unless additional acid already existed 
in the soil.
In reply to a question from the chairman, he added that 
he had examined a quantity of diseased leaves of the potato plant 
without being able to find even the skin of an Aphis upon them, 
though it was well known that these animals frequently changed their 
coverings during the season.
Mr. Hassall said he perfectly agreed with what had fallen from 
the chairman respecting the Aphis.
In his opinion the potato-dis- 
ease was caused by Fungi, and this view was strengthened by the fact, 
that if the sporules of a fungus be shaken over a sound tuber, or 
other soft cellular tissue, the disease will be produced in a few hours.
Mr. N.
B. Ward said he visited Ireland in July last, and traversed 
an extensive district in company with one of the most distinguished 
of living botanists â€” Dr. Harvey, of the University of Dublin â€” but 
though they saw field after field destroyed by the disease in a single 
night, they could only arrive at the conclusion that neither Fungi nor 
Aphides had anything to do with producing the disease.
That they 
were, in fact, the result, and not the cause, and that the origin must 
be traced in some atmospheric influence.
Mr. Hassall would not deny that the atmosphere had a powerful 
existing influence in extending the disease, but he did not think it 
was the proximate cause.
He did not consider it scientific to follow 
the old system of attributing all diseases of which the origin was 
doubtful to the influence of the atmosphere.
Mr. Ward said, in attributing the disease to atmospheric influence, 
he merely intended to intimate that he had no knowledge whatever of 
the real cause of the disease.
The Chairman said, Fungi and insects made their appearance in 
817 
myriads at particular times, and it could not be doubted but that the 
state of the atmosphere had some direct influence in producing their 
extraordinary development on such occasions.
Dr. Ayres said it had been ascertained that there was a deficiency 
in the development of starch granules in the diseased potatoes to the 
extent, he believed, of ten per cent, compared with the quantity usu- 
ally in healthy tubers.
There must, therefore, be a greater propor- 
tion of fluid present ia the root, and a consequent defect of vitality, 
which would render the plant more liable to the attacks both of 
fungi and of animals.
It was remarkable that all the varieties of 
fungi found on the diseased potatoes â€” some dozen he believed in 
number â€” were those usually seen on decaying vegetable matter, 
whereas in the case of the smut in wheat, where another kind of fun- 
gus appeared, the stem and leaves of the plant remained perfectly 
healthy, though the smut invariably made its appearance if the spo- 
rules had been sown with the wheat in the ground.
Mr. Hassall said he could not agree in Dr. Ayres' remarks.
If 
two apples growing on the same tree were perforated, and the sporules 
of the fungi applied to one, it would be found that the apple so im- 
pregnated would become diseased, while the other continued to 
grow.
Dr. Ayres said it was clear that in wounding the apples in the first 
instance the vitality of the cellular tissue was impaired, and the fungi 
were then able to act upon it, which was the very point for which he 
contended.
Mr. Ward said if the leaf of any plant were bruised, so as to in- 
jure its vitality, fungi would make their appearance upon it as a na- 
tural consequence.
Dr. Ayres said there could be no doubt but that fungi were very 
powerful agents in the economy of nature.
For instance, it was now 
known that the phenomena of fermentation were produced by fungi, 
and that their influence had the effect in that case of dividing the 
sugar into alcohol and carbonic acid.
The Chairman, in closing the discussion, said there was at all 
events one point on which they were unanimously agreed, and that 
was, that the real cause of the potato-disease had not yet been clearly 
ascertained, or at all events that the Aphis rapac, or as Mr. Smee 
termed it, the Aphis vastator, had nothing to do with it.
The subject was then adjourned to the next meeting, on the 7th of 
May, and the proceedings terminated.

MICROSCOPICAL SOCIETY.
March I7ih, 1847.â€” J.
S. Bowerbank, Esq., F.R.S., President, in 
the chair.
A paper by Mr. Dean, "On the Growth of Fungus in the Stomata 
of Cactus niger," was read.
The author commenced by stating the 
difficulty which existed in ascertaining whether the stomata of plants 
were pores, either actually opening to the outward air, or covered 
with a delicate membrane, or organs possessing no opening at all.
He then stated that a circumstance he had observed in a plant of 
Cactus niger, which was growing in a Ward's case, and which died 
in the course of the winter, might probably throw some light on the 
subject.
Upon examining this plant, a portion of the surface near 
the top was found to be covered with small black patches, which, on 
applying the microscope, presented the appearance of being fonned 
of tufts of pear-shaped granules attached end to end.
Upon more 
minute investigation it was found that these tufts had their attach- 
ment in the stomata, and from them proceeded a net-work of fila- 
ments, spreading in every direction into the body of the plant, and 
breaking up its whole structure.
These filaments vary in size from 
the T ^^oo to the igooo th of an inch.
When they pass through the 
stomata their character alters, as they then bear fruit, either single 
on short peduncles, or attached end to end, frequently to the number 
of six or eight.
Another plant (a Stapelia) growing in the same case 
had a few weeks before been almost suddenly destroyed by an 
unknown cause, which appeared to proceed from the roots upwards, 
but which at the time Mr. Dean did not investigate, although he has 
no doubt that it was the presence of a similar parasite, as he feels 
convinced that the sporules of the fungus enter by the roots, and gra- 
dually but rapidly extend themselves upwards, and when the plant is 
totally destroyed then they protrude themselves through the stomata, 
as offering less resistance to their progress than any other part of the 
tough epidermis, and thus proving, in his opinion, that the stomata, 
if not open, are at most covered with a membrane much thinner than 
any other portion of the surface, and thus readily allowing these mi- 
nute fungi to find their way from the interior to the exterior.
Another paper by the same gentleman was also read, " On the 
Source whence the Siliceous Cases of Infusorial Animalcules in 
Ichaboe Guano are derived." After premising that aquatic birds, in 
addition to fish, feed largely on marine plants, he proceeded to state 
that on a plant of this kind from Japan, used exclusively in China as 
819 
an ingredient in soups, the name of which he had been unable to as- 
certain, he had found imbedded in great abundance, round disks 
precisely similar to those found in the guano.
He had also found 
them on another marine plant from the Mauritius (Thamnophora 
Telfaria).
From this he infers that these or similar plants inhabited 
by these Infusoria are eaten by the birds, and as the shells, from their 
siliceous nature, are not acted upon by the process of digestion, they 
remain unchanged in the excrements of which the guano is almost 
wholly composed.

Observations on Guano.
{Extracted from TschudVs Travels in Peru).
" Guano (or according to the more correct orthography, Huanu),* 
is found on these islands in enormous layers of from thirty-five to 
forty feet thick.
The upper strata are of a grayish brown colour, 
which lower down becomes darker.
In the lower strata the colour 
is a rusty red, as if tinged by oxide of iron.
The guano becomes 
progressively more and more solid from the surface downward, a cir- 
cumstance naturally accounted for by the gradual deposit of the 
strata, and the evaporation of the fluid particles.
Guano is found on 
all the islands, and on most of the uninhabited promontories of the 
west coast of South America, especially in those parts within the 
tropics.
I have often been assured that beds of guano, several feet 
high, covered with earth, are found inland at some distance from sea; 
but I never met with any, and I have some doubt of the correctness 
of the statement.
If, however, these inland strata really exist, I am 
inclined to believe that they can only be found on hilly ground; and 
in that case they afford strong evidence of a considerable elevation 
of the coast.
* The original word is Huanu, which is a term in the Quichua dialect meaning 
' animal dung ;' for example, Huanacuhana, (excrement of the huanacu).
As the 
word is now generally used, it is an abbreviation of Pishu Huana â€” ' Bird-dung.' The 
Spaniards have converted the final syllable nu into no, as they do in all the words 
adopted from the Quichua which have the like termination.
The European ortho- 
graphy.
Guano, which is also followed in Spanish America, is quite erroneous, for the 
Quichua language is deficient in the letter G, as it is in several other consonants.
The H, in the commencement of the word, is strongly aspirated, whence the error in 
the orthography of the Spaniards, who have sadly corrupted the language of the 
Autochthones of Peru.
820 
" Guano is formed of the excrements of different kinds of marine 
birds, as mews, divers, slieerbeaks, &c.
; but the species which I can 
name with more precision are the following: Larus modest us, Tsch.
; 
Rhinchops nigra, Linn.
; Plotus anhinga, Linn.
; Pelecamis tliayus, 
Mol.
; Phalacrocorax Gaimardii and albigula, Tsch.
{Pelecamis 
Gaiviardii, Less., Carbo albigula, Brandt), and chiefly the Sula va- 
riegata, Tsch.
" The immense flocks of these birds as they fly along the coast 
appear like clouds.
When their vast numbers, their extraordinary 
voracity, and the facility with which they procure their food, are con- 
sidered, one cannot be surprised at the magnitude of the beds of 
guano, which have resulted from uninterrupted accumulations during 
many thousands of years.
I kept for some days a living Sula varie- 
gata, which I fed abundantly with fish.
The average weight of the 
excrements daily was from three-and-a-half to five ounces.
I have 
no doubt that when the bird is in a state of freedom the weight must 
be much greater, for these birds are constantly plunging into the sea, 
in order to devour the fishes which they find in extraordinary masses 
around all the islands.
When an island is inhabited by millions of 
sea-birds, though two-thirds of the guano should be lost while flying, 
still a very considerable stratum would be accumulated in the course 
of a year.
" The marine birds nestle on the uninhabited islands, or on rocks 
near the shore ; but they never settle on the flat beach, or any place 
distant from it inland.
On this fact I ground my conjecture that 
those beds of guano in the interior, which may have been removed 
from the shore by important elevations of the coast, are to be found 
only on hills.
" During the first year of the deposit the strata are white, and the 
guano is then called guano bianco.
In the opinion of the Peruvian 
cultivators, this is the most efficacious kind.
It is found in the 
Punta de Hormillos, on the islands of Islay, Jesus, Margarita, &c.
" As soon as the dealers in guano begin to work one of the beds, 
the island on which it is formed is abandoned by the birds.
It has 
also been remarked, that since the increase of trade and navigation, 
they have withdrawn from the islands in the neighbourhood of the 
ports.
"Much has recently been written on the employment and utility 
of guano ; but the manner in which it is applied as manure in Peru 
seems to be but little known.
The Peruvians use it chiefly in the 
cultivation of maize and potatoes.
A few weeks after the seeds be- 
821 
gin to shoot, a little hollow is dug round each root, and is filled up 
with guano, which is afterwards covered with a layer of earth.
After 
the lapse of twelve or fifteen hours the whole field is laid under 
water, and is left in that state for some hours.
Of the guano bianco 
a less quantity suffices, and the field must be more speedily and 
abundantly watered, otherwise the roots would be destroyed.
The 
efiect of this manure is incredibly rapid.
In a few days the growth 
of a plant is doubled.
If the manure be repeated a second time, but 
in smaller quantity, a rich harvest is certain.
At least, the produce 
will be threefold that which would have been obtained from the un- 
manured soil.
" The haciendas of the valley of Chancay have, during the last 
fifty years, consumed annually from 33,000 to 36,000 bushels of 
guano brought from the islands of Chancha and Pisco.
The price of 
the bushel of coloured guano is one dollar and a quarter, and the 
price of the white from two to three dollars.
The price has recently 
undergone many fluctuations, in consequence of the great exports to 
Europe.
" The employment of this kind of manure is very ancient in Peru ; 
and there is authentic evidence of its having been used in the time 
of the Incas.
The white guano was then chiefly found on the islands 
opposite to Chincha ; so that for upwards of six hundred years the 
deposit has been progressively removed from those islands without 
any apparent decrease of the accumulation.
The uniformity of cli- 
mate on a coast where there is not much rain, must contribute to 
render the Peruvian guano a more arid manure than the African, as 
fewer of the saline particles of the former being in solution, they are 
consequently less subject to evaporation." â€” Tschudi's Travels in 
Peru, 239.

certain interesting observations on the subject of guano, we trust the 
preceding quotation, although not strictly phytological, will be ac- 
ceptable to our readers.

Occurrence of a Whiie-Jlowered Variety of E'pilohium montanum 
in Fifeshire.
By George Lawson, Esq.
During the summer of last year 1 had the pleasure of meeting 
with a beautiful variety of the Epilobium montanum, bearing pure 
milk-white blossoms, growing in a neglected and weed-grown ditch, 
by the margin of an out-of-the-way and little-frequented road, be- 
twixt Airdit and the Briggs-muir, near to the village of Logic, in this 
county.
Instances of variation in the colouring of the flowers of this 
plant are by no means uufrequent ; but I never before found it with 
flowers entirely white.
There were a good number of plants of the 
variety at the place I have mentioned, and these enjoyed a strict 
monopoly of that part of the ditch where they grew, not one rose-co- 
loured flower daring to mingle in the mass of milky blossoms, al- 
though abundance of the usual ruddy flowers decked the hedges and 
way-sides and other parts of the ditch.
And, indeed, I have seldom, 
if ever, seen this Epilobium so abundant and so beautiful, as by the 
way-sides around the place I have mentioned as the station for the 
white-flowered variety.
I could observe nothing peculiar in the situ- 
ation of the plant sufiicient to account for the change of colour of 
the flowers.

Occurrence of Lycopodium annotinum in England, 
By Edward Newman.
In announcing the occurrence of Lycopodium annotinum in Eng- 
land, I have to apologize to its discoverer, the Rev. Robert Rolleston, 
of Ambleside, for expressing somewhat approaching to a doubt of the 
accuracy of his information.
A few days since this gentleman in- 
formed me by letter that this, the rarest of British Lycopodia, and 
never previously found in England, had been discovered near Great 
Langdale.
I had so repeatedly been disappointed by similar reports, 
finding, in every instance, that the plant turned out to be the very 
common L.
clavatum, that I begged for the sight of specimens before 
noting so interesting a fact.
Mr. Rolleston most kindly and promptly 
transmitted them, and they prove most incontestably the accuracy of 
his judgment: they are veritable specimens of the rarer species, and 
thus we have an English habitat of L.
annotinum in addition to the 
Scotch and Welsh ones already published.
Mr. Rolleston very pro- 
perly declines to point out the exact locality, knowing the plant 
would soon be exterminated were its locality and its rarity made 
known to the lake guides.

Note on the Geographical Range in Britain of Native Plants.
By Edward Newman.
A CAREFUL perusal of Mr. Watson's 'Cybele' has led to the reflec- 
tion, how great a service might be rendered to phytology generally, 
and to the geographical portion of that science in particular, by in- 
serting in the pages of the ' Phytologist' a record of careful observa- 
tions on the range of British species, and more particularly of those 
which Mr. Watson has included in his first volume.
A glance at Mr.
Watson's work will show how vast is the extent of information yet to 
be gained : his summaries, laborious though they be, are still confes- 
sedly imperfect, and in many instances seem rather to indicate the 
information required than that possessed.
In most cases this will be 
seen to result mainly from the total untrustworthiness of the authori- 
ties.
This untrustworthiness arises from several causes, for instance: â€” 
1st.
The interested communications of guides and dealers.
825 
2ndly.
The carelessness in recording localities in which a plant 
has really been gathered.
3rdly.
Ignorance of species, by which a name has frequently been 
misapplied.
In making the proposed communications, every species, the identity 
of which admitted of a doubt, should be submitted to some botanist 
thoroughly conversant with British plants.
Such, for instance, as 
Mr. Borrer, Dr. Bromfield, Mr. Watson, Sir Wilham Hooker, Mr.
Luxford or Mr. Babington.
These gentlemen are rarely mistaken 
about a flowering plant, and their authority would add weight and 
value to every record of the kind required, and there is little doubt 
that either of them would lend a helping hand in such a cause.
Mr.
Watson's idea of giving a sketch of the range of each species is a 
most admirable one, and one which calls loudly for the zealous sup- 
port of his botanical brethren in all parts of the empire.
The total omission of Ireland from the ' Cybele ' leaves a vast field 
of labour open for the ardent botanists of that country, a field from 
whence the most interesting results may be anticipated : how little is 
known, even at this moment, of the heaths of Ireland !
and how rich 
is that country in this beautiful order !
It would require, not merely 
a railway trip or a Bianconi expedition, but a summer's residence in 
the west and south-west of Ireland to acquire even a moderate know- 
ledge of her Flora.
1 hope the idea will not be lost sight of, but 
that ere long the ' Phytologist ' may be made the vehicle of the ' Pri- 
mitiae ' of a ' Cybele Hibemica.'

" Note upon the Natural History of Truffles, and their Mode of 
Production.
By M.
Robert." 
"It is well known that naturalists are by no means agreed as to the 
origin and mode of propagation of the truffle {Tuber ciharium), so 
highly prized by epicures.
M. Robert has made some observations 
on these productions, which he has collected in some abundance in 
the forests of the department of the Basses-Alpes.
They are chiefly 
found in the immediate neighbourhood of the evergreen oak ; and 
scarcely ever occur beyond the shade projected by the tree.
If the 
tree dies, or is cut down, the truffles disappear.
But indejjendently 
of the influence of trees in the production of truffles, there is yet 
820 
another cause favourable to their development, and which would ap- 
pear to have escaped our means of observation.
M. Robert believes 
that the truffles grow at the extremities of the radical fibrillae of trees, 
and of the evergreen oak in particular, and that they are in nowise 
connected with the soil.
When the vegetative powers of the fibres 
of the root are quickened by frequent rains, the fibrillae increase in 
number, and the truffles are found in great abundance.
He supposes, 
from analogy, that the truffles owe their origin to a circumstance 
nearly similar to that which produces galls and other excrescences 
upon the leaves of the oak, namely, the puncture of some insect.
Two species of truffles are generally known ; one of which is found 
in summer and autumn, and is pure and white internally, and without 
perfume ; the other, which is collected towards the end of autumn, 
during the winter, and in spring, is black, and highly scented.
This 
difference is generally attributed to the influence of the seasons ; but 
it appears rather to result from the species of tree to which the truffle 
owes its origin." â€” Revue Encyclopediqiie, January, 1847.
Read be- 
fore the Academic des Sciences, January, 1847.

specimens of which have been collected by Professor Henslow, at

Microscopic and General Observations on the Potato.
By Dk.
Tyerman.
[E.xtr acted from the Fourteenth Annual Report of 
the Royal Cornwall Polytechnic Society).
" Having been induced by the conflicting reports respecting the 
potato blight to make some examination of the plant, both in its na- 
tural and diseased condition, I have been urged to record the results, 
and I will also state some of the conclusions to which the investiga- 
tion has led me.
" I have unfortunately not seen any microscopic account of the 
fimgus, or cryptogamic parasite, which causes the decay of the vege- 
table.
I should be glad, however, if in error, to be corrected by any 
other observer, â€” the sole motive of this paper being the discovery of 
the true nature of its subject.
I may premise, that having used a 
compound microscope, capable of high magnifying power, I have not 
observed any insect, or other appearances than I proceed to describe.
827 
" The potato plant, it is almost needless to observe, contains a 
quantity of water, which greatly exceeds that of all its other ingre- 
dients, the proportion contained in the tuber being nearly 80 per 
cent.
â€” starch forming the principal of its remaining elements ; the 
vegetable gluten, saline matters, &c., existing in very minute propor- 
tions.
It is therefore a weakly plant and, perhaps, on that account, 
more easily the prey of certain minute vegetable germs which the at- 
mosphere may be supposed always to contain in great abundance, 
and which (each species selecting its own soil) only await congenial 
occasions to render themselves visible in the growth they originate, 
whether on old and damp books, rotten sticks, plants, &c.
" Fungi of this class generally attack decayed substances, or such 
as possess weak power of life : the pea plant, for instance, whose de- 
cay is rapid as its growth, is peculiarly liable to one species, which, 
magnified, is a most beautiful object: its spawn, or web-like fila- 
ments spreading upon the surface of the leaf, and here and there 
throwing up fruit-bearing heads â€” a little field of microscopic mush- 
rooms.
Indeed, its mode of coursing the surface of the pea-leaf is 
precisely similar to the growth of the potato fungus.
" I think it necessary to refer briefly to the healthy potato plant, as 
some of its appendices are of remarkable formation : I mean chiefly 
the small hairs or bristles which are scattered on both sides of the 
leaf, and more thinly on the stem, and also, small globular bodies 
supported on footstalks, which possibly may be the rudiments of 
the future hairs, which are jointed, and liable to modification with 
the age of the plant.
In the mature or decaying plant, these joints 
become nearly perfect cones, the base of each being very slenderly 
attached to the apex of the cone beneath, presenting a very singular 
appearance These peculiar hairs, or perhaps glands, must not be 
mistaken for the parasitical fungus, from which, indeed, they greatly 
differ.
" The tuber of the potato is cellular, the cells being pentagonal, 
each containing several starch grains (fi:om 8 to 20), which are oval, 
and perfectly unconnected with each other.
If a tuber be cut and 
exposed to the sun and air, the cells will, in the process of drying, 
contract, and force to the surface a layer of starch grains, which have 
a whitish, crystalline appearance.
" 1.
TJie Disease of the Leaf.
" The appearances to be described must not be confounded with 
occasional brown spots and holes, which are obviously the work of 
828 
insects, and which do not increase after the marauders have made 
their meal.
The first obvious indication of the disease is a withered, 
bhiish spot, brown in the centre, where the leaf is killed, and rapidly 
extending, and which always originates on the under surface of the 
leaf.
Closer observation discovers a white halo, or mould, around 
the spot, and this is a certain indication of the total destruction of 
that portion of the plant above the ground, and also of every tuber 
which is subjected under favourable circumstances, as moisture, to the 
infection.
I shall by and by prove that this mould is the identical 
cause of the destruction of the tuber.
Under a lens of very moderate 
magnifying power it has a cottony aspect, and is diffused among the 
hairs of the leaf, cutting them up and disarranging them, and from it 
arise very numerous thready, forked stems, having fruit-bearing, oval 
capsules, which appear to me on a rough calculation to have a 
long diameter equal to y^W of an inch, and which, when ripe, shed 
their seed or sporules, which become, no doubt in myriads, the pro- 
perty of the atmosphere.
But the cottony root or spawn, when once 
produced, appears capable of multiplying itself indefinitely, at least 
until it has effected the destruction of that on which it feeds.
It ex- 
tends to the stalk upon which the fruit capsules are, under favourable 
circumstances, most clearly demonstrated.
" Leaves' are the lungs or resjjiratory organs of plants.
Soon 
therefore after the appearance of the leaf-spot, stains appear on the 
stalks, and are the result of impeded, and then checks, circulation of 
the sap.
In a few days from the first infection, all that portion of the 
plant above the ground is, as it were by one fell swoop, destroyed.
The evaporation of its aqueous vapour is speedily accomplished, and 
a little carbonaceous and saline matter in the shape of a dead stalk 
indicates the situation of the tubers, which are found more or less 
loosely connected with it by decaying attachments.
" 2.
The Disease of the Tuber.
" On digging the tubers it very commonly is observed that one 
only of a bunch is the subject of the disease, which it has derived 
either from an infected parent set (or portion first planted), or from 
the leaves and stalk, and is, I believe, always in the closest approxi- 
mation to them.
" Much moisture on the tuber renders its surface unfit for micro- 
scopic examination, and upon the dry surface of the tuber the fungus 
may not luxuriate, although it has first passed through it on its way 
829 
to the interior.
It is therefore necessary to obtain a part of the in- 
fected potato presenting it in a comparatively dry state, and this is 
very easy, foi on breaking open some specimens, little accidental ca- 
vities or fissures present the spawn in all its luxuriancy, and it is 
precisely identical with that above referred to on the leaf, lining the 
hollows which it has reached.
In cavities which are excluded from 
the air the fruit-bearing stems of the fungus are not thrown up from 
the spawn, but in favourable spots they are as evident as upon the 
leaves.
In every instance the disease of the substance of the tuber is 
most obviously in communication with its outer surface ; small brown 
spots, stains, or lines, marking with certainty the route of the infec- 
tion from without inwards.
If a single instance can be adduced of 
the origin or existence of the disease in the centre of the tuber, inde- 
pendently of this communication with its surface, then this theory 
and the results of my observations are entirely shaken.
In every in- 
stance, I have found it advance from the circumference to the centre.
"I have described the stems and oval fruit-bearing heads of the fun- 
gus.
The cottony ground-work, or spawn, when highly magnified, 
is found to be composed of jointed or vesicular filaments, infinitely 
branched, and which, especially upon the cut surfaces of diseased 
tubers, become heaped together, a white mass being thus formed, 
bearing a resemblance to snow.
" In cellular plants, as mushrooms, the rapidity of growth is most 
surprising, and botanists, attempting the calculation, have supposed 
that many millions of cells are formed in a single hour.
I introduce 
this analogy of the growth of other vegetable formations to reconcile 
the seeming paradox of the plant under consideration advancing 
with such frightful rapidity.
If a diseased potato be cut in two, and 
having been laid aside for a day or two, be then examined, the por- 
tions of the cut surfaces stained by the infection, will be found 
covered with a white mould, which is entirely composed of the web- 
like filaments.
" The inductions and general remarks derived from the investiga- 
tion are as follow : â€” 
" 1.
The blight first attacks the leaf of the plant, and originates 
from invisible germs or prolific particles diffused (perhaps universally) 
through the air, and which await a favourable opportunity for their 
development, just as other parasites, whether Fungi or flower-bearing 
plants, select their own proper soil â€” thus the mistleto selects the 
apple or oak ; the Cuscuta, or dodder, the wild thyme and furze ; a 
Vol. it.
5 l 
830 
fungus, above referred to, the pea-leaf; and the spawn of mushrooms 
certain soils, &c.
" 2.
The parasite affects the tuber secondarily, and inoculates it 
by direct contact.
" 3.
Although the fungus bears fruit and seed, yet its spawn is it- 
self capable of indefinite reproduction, and destroys by encroach- 
ment, and a specific inherent property.
" 4.
Tubers taken from the ground free from infection will not 
necessarily become infected, nor the future plants and tubers.
" 5.
Assuming that the atmosphere always contains, diff'used through 
it, these vegetable germs, but generally in a dormant state, then 
either some atmospheric change congenial to their development may 
be inferred, or some declension in the potato plant, the result of con- 
tinual propagation from the original parent sets, the probability of 
such a result being borne out by the declension of fruits propagated 
from grafts whose original parent tree has consummated the period of 
its existence â€” but observations on seedlings would assist in elucidat- 
ing this point.
" 6.
The dry coat of a tuber is unfavourable to the growth of the 
fungus, but if, with the assistance of moisture, it has become infected, 
the disease will extend to the interior, although its surface be after- 
wards kept dry.
" 7.
The most likely mode of preserving the plant for future crops 
is by carefully separating the healthy from diseased tubers, and ap- 
plying to their surface some substance, as lime, &c., in order to de- 
stroy any part of the fungus which may accidentally have reached 
them.
" 8.
It will be unadvisable to crop the ground extensively with 
potatoes, especially the varieties which are commonly matured at a 
late period of the year, until cautious trial and experience shall have 
proved that the state of the atmosphere or the condition of the plant 
are unfavourable to the luxuriancy of the fungus.
" 9.
This fungus appears peculiar to the potato plant.
" Memorandum.
â€” The leaf of the turnip is often extensively af- 
fected with a fungus which is intimately allied to the potato fungus, 
but its effect is evidently only partially injurious.
" It has been stated that the tuber, although checked in its growth, 
will, even if the leaves and stalks be cut down, mature itself in the 
ground, but, with great deference to those who have advanced this 
opinion, I venture to suggest that the healthy life and natural decay 
831 
of these important parts of the plant are essential to the perfection 
of the tuber, which they were, by nature, destined to ventilate and 
purify."

Mr. Smee and his Aphis vastator.
In a late number of the ' Phytologist ' we noticed Mr. Smee's work 
on the potato-disease as a pleasant and well-timed jeu d'esprit, cal- 
culated to arrest, in some measure, the torrent of hypotheses with 
which the press was at that time teeming on the same subject.
As a 
jeu d'esprit, and written with a benevolent intention, it claimed our 
respect and admiration ; but we think the author has subsequently 
taken up the subject a little too strongly, and we beg to caution him 
against such advertisements as the following, extracted from Satur- 
day's ' Sun,' lest he unexpectedly find the public laughing at him 
instead of with him ; an unpleasant difference.
" IMPORTANT EXPERIMENTUM CRUCIS, or direct proof 
OF THE DESTRUCTION OF THE POTATO PLANT BY THE APHIS 
VASTATOR.
" Sir, â€” In my treatise on the potato plant, I have shown that, an- 
tecedently to all other changes, a certain insect is to be found on the 
leaf, which sucks the juices of the plant and causes it to die, locally, 
at the part affected, or generally through its entire system.
" By tracing the insect to numerous other plants it was found to 
produce similar eflFects â€” the turnip rotted in the bulb, the carrot in the 
root, and even the indestructible groundsel equally suflFered from its 
attacks.
In the damaged plants anatomy demonstrates imperfect tis- 
sue â€” chemistry, a deficiency of the solid materials, and natural history 
indicates the source of the mischief by pointing to the creature which 
abstracts that which should form the fibre and starch of the plant.
" To those who prefer experiment to observation I have now to 
announce that at length the direct proof of the capability of the Aphis 
vastator to destroy the potato plant has been obtained ; an experi- 
ment which has already been performed with the same result upon 
tulips, crocuses, and other plants.
" Several Russian tubers, apparently sound and well filled with 
832 
starch, were planted in a greenhouse, and thoroughly healthy plants 
were produced.
Upon one of the best of the number, when about 
two feet high, was placed a colony of vastators, which fed and throve 
abundantly, and which were prevented from travelling to neighbour- 
ing plants by a covering of gauze.
" For a time, this plant throve as well as its neighbours, but even- 
tually the entire haulm died and withered up, as was observed last 
year in the blighted fields.
Its neighbours, which had no insect to 
suck the vital fluid, were perfectly healthy, forming a striking con- 
trast to the withered and dead stalk.
" On examining the collar it was found partially decayed in the 
manner which 1 have described as being especially attributable to 
the ravages of Aphides.
The roots were found to be extensively rot- 
ten, and the little tubers, although not one-sixth the bulk of the ori- 
ginal set, presented a hardness characteristic of disease.
" The aerial and fungoid theorists have striven hard to divert the 
attention of the farmer from the ravages of the vastator ; and in the 
unparalleled virulence of their opposition, they have even frequently 
substituted acrimony and mis-statement for courtesy and truth.
Ne- 
vertheless, no scientific man in any country has ever disproved my 
statements, or confuted my deductions ; and if amongst practical 
men there be one still left who doubts the destructive power of the 
vastator, 1 beg him to consider deeply and repeat this experiment, 
that all being of one mind we shall not be diverted upon matters 
which are irrelevant, but shall be enabled to concentrate our energies 
in the annihilation of the destroyer, and the protection of our crops.
â€” I am.
Sir, your obedient servant, 
" Alfred Smee." 
" 7, Finsbury Circus, 
April 19, 1847." 
We trust that the ' Phytologist' has not a reader so stolid as to 
swallow so evident a hoax as this vastator affair appears to be.
If 
there be, let him peruse Mr. Smee's numerous letters in the public pa- 
pers, and he will find that gentleman very frequently speaking of bota- 
nists, entomologists, gardeners, &c., as though a knowledge of botany, 
entomology and horticulture were disqualifications for bringing the 
inquiry to a successful issue : surely this cannot be in earnest !
surely 
no surgeon would say, as a matter of self-gratulation, " the anatomists 
are all against me, but 1 care nothing for that, I have hypotheses that 
833 
bid defiance to anatomy 1" If this language be logical, then Mr.
Smee's book is logical, and all his letters are logical : but if a know- 
ledge of anatomy is necessary to the surgeon ; if the structure of a 
watch should be known to the watchmaker; if the ingredients of beer 
should be known to the brewer ; so is a knowledge of physiological 
botany necessary to the writer on the nosology of plants; so is a 
knowledge of entomology needful to those who detail the doings of 
insects ; so is a knowledge of horticulture essential to those who take 
the subject of cultivation.
Let us recommend Mr. Smee to carry his 
witticisms a step farther ; let him suggest to the public the advantage 
of a galvanic wire drawn over the potatoes by a couple of Irishmen, 
one at each side of the plantation ; and let him issue a polite circu- 
lar to the vastators, begging them to come to the wire and be killed.

" Remarks on Double-cropping, as a Means of lessening the Risk of 
Growing Potatoes.
By John S.
Enys, Esq." 
(Extracted from the 14th Annual Beport of the Royal Cornwall Polytechnic Society).
" In consequence of the second failure of the potato crop, it is pro- 
bable many persons will be deterred from planting their accustomed 
quantity of potatoes ; and hence, exclusive of the anticipated conti- 
nuation of the disease, a deficient supply from a less extent of land 
planted with potatoes may be apprehended.
" Under these circumstances no apology I trust will be deemed 
necessary for bringing before this meeting a suggestion for lessening 
the risk of a total loss, by growing potatoes in alternate rows with 
another crop, with a view that in case of the occurrence of the potato 
disease in 1847, the increased growth of the second crop may in 
some degree compensate their loss.
" The expectation of a greatly increased produce from double 
crops has, I apprehend, been but seldom realized ; and the plan is 
open to objection, firom the greater cost of hoeing, and trouble in se- 
parating, the produce.
" Market gardeners, however, often remove one of such crops for 
consumption, leaving the other to stand as the principal crop.
A 
failure of alternate rows of potatoes, if planted in this mode with 
834 
another crop, would be analogous to their removal ; and if our ex- 
pectations were limited to the increased growth of the other crop, 
the plan would become, in a great degree, an assurance against total 
loss.
" Considering beans* an uncertain crop in the climate and soil of 
Cornwall, I have for the last two years grown beans with an insu- 
rance crop under them in alternate rows, and the success has been 
SuflBcient to induce me to extend the practice, and to double the bean 
crop in 1847, and adopt the same principle in growing potatoes.
" A different standard may be required of the width of the rows, in 
different soils and for different varieties of potatoes.
The standard I 
have generally adopted is 27 inches in single crops, and from 18 to 
20 inches in alternate rows of different crops.
" The plan of planting a second crop on land in which potatoes 
have failed, is not practicable on a large scale in the midst of turnip 
hoeing or harvest.
The land can be seldom found in good order for 
this purpose, even if the time for planting the second crop should not 
be past, while the plan of double-cropping may be readily carried 
out to any extent at the proper season, and the secondary crop will 
be ready to grow immediately on the failure of the principal.
" The crop that is considered of the least importance can always 
be kept back to allow of the more free growth of the principal, but 
no reasonable expectation ought to be entertained of a greatly in- 
creased joint produce from double crops; still, under the present cir- 
cumstances of the potato-disease, I conceive it may prove useful if 
our views are limited to the expectation of an increased growth of one 
crop compensating the deficiency of the other, in case of a failure 
from any cause affecting its growth.f 
" The comparative experiment, in 1846, was made fairly.
The 
winter beans and potatoes (large white) were all planted on the last 
day of February, in a clover lay, double ploughed, and manured in 
the rows with 3 cwt.
of guano per acre.
" In 184.5 the tick beans and potatoes (large white) were planted in 
the last week of March, after oats, and manured by 3 cwt.
of guano ; 
and the produce of the potatoes, under the beans, was much larger, 
per acre, than the same variety sown several weeks later.
" * See Lord Lovelace's account of bean crops, with an undercrop of cabbages.
English Agricultural Society's Report, 1844.
f In this place two tables are introduced to illustrate the author's experiments, but 
unfortunately are so arranged in the printing as to be perfectly unintelligible.
â€” Ed.

" In both these cases, the beans were considered the principal, and 
the potatoes the secondary crop ; and, in 1845, fthe latter were twice 
trodden down by a boy, to prevent their interfering with the blossom- 
ing of the bean crop.
In case the potato is considered the main 
crop, carrots especially, or even mangel wurzel, or cabbages, would 
be preferable in the alternate rows, as the insurance or secondary 
crop.
" At the time these remarks were read at the Polytechnic meeting, 
the potato crop of 1846 had not been measured ; and they thus were 
founded on the result obtained from the crops of 1845.
The stems 
of both crops were destroyed by the disease; but the tubers were 
much less injured in 1846 than 1845: in both years the injury was 
below the average."

The entire range of literature offers no subject more intensely in- 
teresting than a general illustrated history of ferns.
The extreme 
beauty of the plants themselves, the ease with which they are now 
cultivated, the impetus and ton given to their cultivation by the in- 
troduction of Mr. Ward's cases in the drawing rooms of the nobility 
and gentry ; the easily understood distinction of species ; the aptness 
of the objects for characteristic and graceful illustration ; these, and 
many other causes combine to render a ' Species Filicum ' the most 
tempting book which a competent author or speculative publisher 
could possibly undertake, and to promise an equal fund of amuse- 
ment, instruction, renown, and profit : a return (5f quid pro quo to all 
parties concerned, a mutual harvest of satisfaction.
Sir William Hooker's deservedly high reputation considerably en- 
hanced the eager expectation with which the appearance of the first 
part was awaited : through a series of works and during a long course 
of years, the learned author has maintained a botanical reputation 
836 
that few of our countrymen have reached, and of which scarcely one 
has hved to enjoy the full fruition and reward.
Add to this the author's office as a principal manager of the Royal 
Gardens at Kew, where Mr. Smith, the first pteridologist in the coun- 
try, has laboured so long and so successfully in making collections 
both of living and dried ferns, and we must acknowledge that the 
' Species Filicum ' comes before the public with every advantage that 
circumstances can bestow.
The first point of interest attached to the publication of a work on 
ferns by so celebrated a writer, was the arrangement to be adopted.
It was a matter of great curiosity with botanists to know whether the 
laborious researches of Presl and John Smith would be availed of, 
the obsolete system of Swartz and Willdenow revived, or a new me- 
thod more comprehensive and convenient than either be raised as a 
superstructure on the united bases of both, combining the merits of 
both, and dismissing the errors of both.
No such opportunity has 
ever before existed : the author, as he himself asserts, had "the power 
of examiningthe almost countless specimens, preserved either in his 
own peculiarly rich herbarium, or in the many others, as well public 
as private, to which he has been allowed access.
The opportunities 
thus afforded * * * have proved of the utmost utility ; 
they have enabled him to arrive at results to which no other means of 
investigation could have led." 
From this quotation it will be evident that our high estimation of 
the author's capability is by no means superior to his own, but who- 
ever peruses the preface, although perhaps fully participating in the 
author's ideas of his own advantages, will have cause to regret that 
he should have gone out of his way to point out the very trivial er- 
rors of fellow-labourers : we do not say that they are not errors, 
but they have scarcely any connexion with what Sir William has be- 
fore him ; and it therefore appears uncourteous and unkind to drag 
them before the public.
We heartily wish that the pages occupied 
by this preface had been devoted to the more legitimate object of 
giving a synoptical table of the author's own views : Sir William 
Hooker is too fond of exhibiting what appears to us uncalled-for 
jealousy ; uncalled-for, because his own great acquirements can af- 
ford that he should give to every labourer in the field of science his 
just modicum of praise, without restricting it to those who are dead 
to the public if yet alive in the body, who can never enter the field of 
literature as competitors with himself.
Throughout the preface not 
a word occurs explanatory of the arrangement about to be adopted.

The author appears to congratulate himself on having, by means of 
the tribes, subtribes, genera and subgenera, sections, asterisks, dag- 
gers, parentheses, &c., avoided the errors of " Dr. Presl and Mr. John 
Smith, who," he declares, " have showed themselves peculiarly ad- 
dicted to multiplying genera, have not always taken Nature for their 
guide, nor succeeded in eliciting a simple and tangible arrange- 
ment." We are therefore compelled to believe that the author 
considers the foregoing " a simple and tangible arrangement," and 
that starred and daggered sections, founded on the characters of 
" pinnatedly " or " pinnatifidly divided," " pinnae more than an inch 
long, " " pinnae less than an inch long," and similar distinctions, are 
really to supersede the elaborately described characters of fructifica- 
tion and venation given by the authors above mentioned ; for he 
expressly says at p.
144, that " the variations of form in the involucre 
or indusium is more useful as aflfording specific, rather than generic 
characters." Can Sir William Hooker be serious in this ?
Is not his 
object rather to apologize for not using the fructification in his mul- 
titudinous divisions, than to enforce the superiority of a method long 
since exploded, although carried out with considerable ingenuity by 
Withering, and the botanists of his day ?
Had Sir William taken 
the third volume of Withering in his hand, and turned to the 
genus Polypodium, divided exactly on the plan he now proposes, we 
think he could not fail to have pencilled certain commentaries against 
the species as they stand.
We give Withering's synopsis in roman, 
and the commentator's supposed pencillings in italics.

We could analyze many of Sir William Hooker's divisions with a 
similar result, particularly his genus Hymenophyllum, which is made 
to comprise a family of ferns separable into generic divisions by cha- 
racters of surpassing distinctness derived from the fructification.
Sir 
William divides this group precisely on the same plan as that adopted 
above by Withering in Polypodium, the result is of course the same, 
that of dissevering allied species, or even varieties of the same spe- 
cies, and of associating species that have no characters in common, 
except the mode in which the frond happens to be divided, a charac- 
ter we might describe as being totally unavailabe.
It would appear from the author's own statement that when he 
wrote this part of the work he was unaware of Presl's admirable 
Monograph of the family; for in Part II., which appeared in 1844, 
this monograph is not mentioned, although it had been nearly two 
years before the public, and therefore this want of knowledge seems 
unaccountable and inexcusable: however, immediately after the pub- 
lication of Part II.
of the * Species Filicum,' a complete analysis of 
Presl's work appeared in the pages of the * Phytologist ;' then, the 
Hymenophyllaceae being still unfinished, it became necessary to no- 
tice Presl's labours, which is accordingly done in Part III, and a 
Synopsis is given, preceded by the remark we have already quoted as 
objecting to generic characters being derived from the fructification.
To those who are not pteridologists any comments on the labours of 
these two authors would be unintelligible, to those who are pterido- 
logists we would suggest a comparison of the two systems.
843 
We cannot but regfet that any author should venture to risk a 
well-earned reputation by carelessness like that we have noticed ; or 
to palliate carelessness by remarks, which, to speak in the mildest 
way, will find no response amongst scientific botanists.
At the pre- 
sent day, when the fructification, the venation, the scales of the 
stipes, and every part of the plant is laboriously studied, and when 
the fructification and venation have been shown to afford such excel- 
lent characters for the discrimination of divisions, we cannot be ex- 
pected to revert to a character often insufficient for ascertaining a 
variety, and never available for a higher distinction than that of 
species.

Notice of a ^Manual of British Botany.
By Charles Cardale 
Babington, M.A., &c.' Second Edition.
The former edition of this work was good â€” very good.
If the use 
of a comparative teiTa can be allowed after the superlative, this second 
edition is better.
Various small blemishes have been expunged ; and 
occasional inaccuracies of the former edition are here rectified.
Some 
unsuccessfiil attempts at originality, in framing the descriptive charac- 
ters, have now given place to more sound views and observations ; 
which have been taken from other sources, indeed, but which appa- 
rently have not been adopted without due examinatioiL Among other 
emendations, we may rank the omission of that trader-like puff" of the 
author's own wares, mingled with insinuations against the works of 
preceding authors, which disfigured the Preface to the former edition.
On glancing through the volume we do not find much that will be 
new to readers of the ' Phytologist.' The plants which have been dis- 
covered or recorded for British, since the publication of the prior edition, 
are duly entered in their appropriate places ; but as almost all of these 
have been already registered in the pages of the ' Phytologist,' they 
are not novelties to our own readers.
Some dozen or so of addition- 
al species are either waifs and stragglers from cultivation, as Lepidium 
sativum and Asperula taurina, â€” or species not yet sufficiently ascer- 
tained, as Viola epipsia and Foeniculum piperatum, â€” or subdivisions 
of familiar species, as Zostera nana and angustifolia, separated from 
Zostera marina.
A little farther extension is likewise made of a good 
^44 
plan commenced in the first edition ; namely, the occasional mention 
of species which are deemed likely to occur in this country, although 
they have not yet been ascertained to grow in the British Islands.
In 
some very few instances, too, the author has even retraced his own 
steps, by re-uniting supposed species which he had before divided, or 
again separating those which he had formerly combined into one.
It 
may be presumed that the evidence was very conclusive and undeniable, 
which compelled our present author to take these courses, especially 
that of re-union.
As instances of re-union, we may refer to Teucrium 
Scordium and Scordioides, to Hieracium boreale and sabaudum.
And as examples of subdivision, we find Newman's three species 
of Lastraea (recurva, multiflora, spinosa), substituted for the L.
dilata- 
ta of the former edition, although under other names ; also in the ge- 
nus Polystichum, we have the angulare again sepai'ated from the acu- 
leatum, the lobatum being retained as a variety of the latter.
As 
might have been anticipated, there appears most re-modelling in the 
genus Hieracium.
Whichever edition we take, the Manual is certainly a work of stan- 
dard value, either for the use of the student who wishes to learn the 
names of plants, or for the use of those botanists who would institute 
comparisons between the botanical productions of Britain and those of 
other European countries.
Its own intrinsic merits and moderate 
price will ensure its success in the book-market, especially if the au- 
thor keeps up to his prudent practice of lauding the lecturers who can 
use it in their class-rooms and recommend it to their pupils.
For our 
part, we have no objection to make against the emplojTnent of a little 
" worldly wisdom " in this instance : it can only increase the sale of a 
work which well deserves to be sold.
Indeed, we consider it a fortunate circumstance that this very ne- 
cessary department of British Botany has been taken under the control 
of an individual who possesses such a combination of natural and ad- 
ventitious qualifications for the office of descriptive botanist.
Evi- 
dently deriving fi'om nature a matter-of-fact cast of mind, adapted to 
minute observation and detail, and not diverted therefrom by any 
great tendency to imagine or to reason, the author is admirably fitted 
for the good execution of a task, which turns chiefly upon the atten- 
tive examination and comparison of small physical differences.
In- 
dividuals of comprehensive mental grasp, especially the imaginative 
and reflective, cannot submit to the patient drudgery of examining 
those innumerable petty details which the technical describer of plants 
must make hunself familiarly acquainted with.
Success in this depart- 
845 
ment of science, as in any othei-, acquires a talent from nature, as well 
as study ; albeit the talent is widely different in kind from that which 
makes a Humboldt or a Combe.
In addition to a natural fitness for the scientific path which he has 
chosen to take, the author of the Manual has enjoyed several adventi- 
tious advantages which have not fallen so favourably to the lot of any 
previous describer of British plants.
Among these we may fairly 
reckon the leisure which is afforded by an entire freedom fi-om pro- 
fessional and domestic ties, frequent and extensive travel about the 
British islands, greatly increased facility of intercommunication 
with other botanists by rail and post, the recent publication of 
various other descriptive and pictorial works of high merit, together 
with access to a vast number of ready-labelled European specimens, 
whether sent originally to the author himself, or to the Botanical So- 
ciety of Edinburgh, which is perhaps much the same thing in practi- 
cal usefulness to him.
The last advantage can scarcely be estimated 
too highly.
We make no doubt that his identifications of species, and 
corrections of nomenclature, have frequently been thus suggested to 
our author ; and that the accuracy and value of the Manual have been 
gi'eatly increased thereby.
In this, there is no detraction from his 
merit as a scientific writer.
He has not only had unusual advantages 
wathin his reach, but he has also known how to use them, â€” to make 
them available to his own object, serviceable to others, and conducive 
to the promotion of science.
The true character of the Manual, however, appears to have been 
imperfectly understood by reviewers and critics.
In a certain sense, it 
really was a new work, as somewhat ostentatiously pronounced to be ; 
and yet it exhibited little of originality in conception or of novelty in 
execution.
It might almost have been termed, ' Koch's Synopsis, 
adapted to the botany of the British Islands, with variations and addi- 
tions fi'om other sources.' It is, and was from the first, an excellent 
critical digest of the descriptions and nomenclature of British plants, 
as set forth in the works of Continental and British authors, and veri- 
fied by comparison with the plants themselves.
In some instances, in- 
deed, the author substituted fresh characters for species, on the faith 
of his own examinations only ; but, as before hinted, these attempts at 
novelty have sometimes proved less sound or successful than his criti- 
cal compilations.
Nor is there anything to excite surprise in this.
Little room could remain for novelty in the descriptions of plants 
which had been described before, and most of them described a hun- 
dred times over.

It may be thought that we use rather eulogistic terms, in thus 
strongly commending a work which, as is admitted, relates only to 
one of the more humble depai'tments of botanical science.
We be- 
lieve, however, while it certainly makes only small demand on the 
loftier powers of mind, that the good execution of such a work does 
truly require a considerable share of intellectual talent, although such 
talent may be of a partial or specific kind.
Moreover, descriptive 
botany is a most essential department of the science ; and some of the 
highest investigations towards which the attention of botanists can be 
directed will be found to depend pretty much upon the ability and 
accuracy of those who devote themselves to technical description.
We believe that exactness in description and nomenclature will con- 
tinue to become of increasing importance to the general progress of 
the science.
Turn we now to the other side of the picture, and say a few words 
on some points where we must think the author fairly liable to a share 
of censure.
Here and there, through the volume, we detect such de- 
cided evidences of partiality as to leave us no means for avoiding a 
conclusion that the author adopts or rejects genera and species, names 
and characters, less on their own merits and soundness, than out of 
personal feelings towards (whether for or against) the botanists by 
whom they may have been suggested or ascertained.
For instance, 
it looks not well to find an untenable species retained, as if it were 
something real in nature, when it happens to have for its authority 
the name of a botanist influential by his social position, and capable 
of conferring favours ; while, on the other hand, a not less tenable 
species is rejected, which happens to have been proposed by some 
less influential person, or by a botanist who is no longer among the 
living.
Neither does it look well to find a marked abstinence from re- 
ferences to writings which might show himself to have been formerly 
in error, or which might prove advantageous to some independent in- 
stitution or individual botanist who is no favourite with the author of 
the Manual.
And when this sort of personal partiality or prejudice 
is carried so far that error, shown to be such on suflicient evidence, is 
repeated in preference to the substitution of fact or truth, it can hardly 
fail to excite a distrust of the author's scientific fidelity, and must un- 
avoidably weaken the reliance which otherwise might have been given 
to the Manual, as a faithful record of the realities of nature.
Not a 
worse, but a more direct and unmistakeable breach of justice is com- 
mitted in misappropriating to himself any little discovery or correc- 
tion of nomenclature, in which he must well know that he had no 
share.
This want of sufficient impartiality, in matters that should be 
847 
purely intellectual or scientific, is the chief defect of the Manual ; and 
although too evident in some particular instances, we would still not 
be understood to imply that it pervades the work generally and as a 
whole.
If called upon to do so, we will give examples in illustration 
of the alleged defect.
Unless so called upon, we shall avoid a course 
which would compel us to name the botanists, towards whom, as ap- 
pears to ourselves, an undue subserviency has been evinced, or the 
opposite conduct exhibited.
Having premised these observations on the general merits and 
character of a book which may be considered a publication of much 
importance to the British botanist, we shall now take a run through 
its pages, in order to select therefrom some of the more novel items 
which may appear most likely to interest readers of the ' Phytologist,' 
or which may offer matter for comment.
Under the head of Thalictrum minus we find a suggestion that T.
flexuosum {Reich.) is likely to prove a native of Britain ; also, that 
the plant on the rocks, near Twll du, in Caernarvonshire, hitherto re- 
ported under the name of T.
minus, is probably T.
Kochii (Fries).
Fries gives long descriptions of all three in his recent work, ' Summa 
Vegetabilium Scandinavia; ;' from which it appears that T.
minus has 
eight-ribbed carpels, while those of the other two alleged species are 
ten-ribbed ; T.
Kochii having its stem hollow, straight, smooth, na- 
ked ; T.
flexuosum having the stem solid, striated, leafy at the base ; 
the stems of T.
minus being solid, flexuose, striated, and leafless at 
the base.
Under the head of R.
aquatilis the author intimates that probably 
two species (exclusive of circinatus and fluitans) are comprehended 
under that name.
The one, Batrachium heterophyllum (Fries), is to 
be distinguished by its leaves having dentate or incised lobes, and its 
flowers growing from the axils either of the submersed or the floating 
leaves.
The other, B.
peltatum (Fries), is to be known by the cor- 
date or truncate base and crenate lobes of its subpeltate, floating 
leaves, with flowers from the axils of those floating leaves only.
Thus far our author appears to have taken the distinctions from 
Fries ; but he farther says, " Often the floating leaves are wanting in 
the former ; never in fertile plants of the latter." It is not easy to 
see how the floating leaves could be wanting in fertile (that is, in 
jlowering) plants of a species, whose flowers are produced from the 
axils of those leaves only !
We before remarked that the author of 
the Manual had no great tendency to imagine or to reason.
If he 
will again read the remarks of Fries, he may see that the short sen- 
848 
tence above quoted just reverses the statement of Fries, and utterly 
destroys its logical propriety by doing so.
We have specimens 
from Surrey, Lanarkshire and Aberdeenshire, which possibly may be- 
long to the 13.
peltatum.
Ranunculus Lenormandi {F.
W. Schultz) is adopted of a species, 
and the variety " grandiflorus " of the former edition is quoted as a 
synonym, although there is a discrepancy which we cannot reconcile 
therewith ; namely, the alleged " broad " petals of grandiflorus ; for 
those of Lenormandi are so narrow in projDortion to length, as to 
give a radiate or starry appearance to the flower.
The normal con- 
dition of Lenormandi, like that of aquatilis or hederaceus, is floating; 
its stems are creeping where left dry.
The contrast with hederaceus 
is too strongly drawn, in comparing the relative length of calyx and 
petals ; for those of R.
hederaceus frequently, if not usually, exceed 
the calyx, and are sometimes full twice as long.
Barbarea arcuata [Reich.) is cashiered from its rank as a species 
and reduced into a variety of B.
vulgaris.
We presume that the 
characters of distinction, drawn from the different shape of the seeds, 
in the former edition, were found erroneous, as they are not repeated.
The specific character of B.
vulgaris is expressed in such manner as 
to convey a totally diff"erent meaning from that which is intended.
In the Manual it runs thus: "lower leaves lyrate: upper pair of 
lobes as broad as the large roundish subcordate terminal lobe." Such 
is not the fact; the upper lobes being less than half as broad as the 
terminal lobe.
The length of the upper lobes, measured from tip to 
tip, across the leaf, equals the breadth of the terminal lobe ; and the 
author should therefore have written, " upper pair of lobes equalling 
the breadth of the terminal lobe." The character is taken fi-om 
Koch's Synopsis, but so translated as to change that author's mean- 
ing, and to state the fact incorrectly.
Erysimum cheiranthoides and E.
virgatum, in the former edition, 
were alike marked as species " possibly introduced, but now having 
the appearance of being a true native." We think it was the 
author of the Manual himself who caused the introduction of E.
vir- 
gatum into lists of British plants : and it may therefore be worth 
while to observe that, in the second edition, E.
cheiranthoides is 
given as a true native, while E.
virgatum is to be expunged from our 
catalogues, being no longer found about Bath, and having been 
" probably introduced accidentally." It is doubtless at times a mat- 
ter of nice judgment to decide whether a newly observed species 
should be received or rejected in our lists of native and naturalized 
849 
plants ; but as no mischief can arise from hesitation, it is surely bet- 
ter not to be in such haste to swell our catalogues by the introduction 
of temporary stragglers, which thus shortly disappear again.
" I have reason to think," writes the author, " that an imperfect 
specimen of Viola from the island of N.
Uist, Scotland, is the V.
epipsia {Led.) Fries, which has short peduncles, longer free stipules, 
and cordate adpressed dentate leaves." Our herbarium has a speci- 
men from Dalwhinnie, which may be this species.
In the genus Cerastium we find the atrovirens and pumilum still 
retained for species distinct from semidecandrum and tetrandrum.
The two latter are very bad names, because at variance with fact ; 
and while continued they will lead to frequent errors.
Cosson and 
Germain use the name "varians" to comprehend this group of "varie- 
ties " and " sub-varieties." In the alpine species of the genus the 
author of the Manual has retraced his steps, by again separating the 
alpinum and latifolium, and placing Edmonston's nigrescens as a 
variety of the latter, instead of being its typical and sole representa- 
tive in Britain.
Of the propriety of separating the Highland alpinum 
and latifolium we are fully confirmed by cultivation for several years, 
and repeatedly raising them from seed.
But it is true, also, that 
Edmondston's C.
nigrescens has come up so exactly identical fi'om 
seed, that branchlets of the offspring and branchlets of the parent 
plant are undistinguishable after removal from the growing plants.
Still, there seems no clear character for a book-distinction between 
the nigrescens and latifolium.
In treating the species of Hypericum we are informed by our au- 
thor, on the authority of Reichenbach, that H.
grandifolium {Chois.) 
grows in Arran, Scotland.
We should deem the presumption very 
strong indeed against the occurrence of this shrub as a native of 
Arran, Scotland.
The Irish isles, so named, may be rather less un- 
likely, though still not to be deemed likely.
Some uncertainty 
attends the nomenclature of H.
grandifolium, however, and Reichen- 
bach may intend something different from the Androsaemum Webbi- 
anum {Spach) or Hypericum foliosum [Ait.) under that name.
The 
last-named species is almost as tender as a Fuchsia; its stems being 
killed to the ground by the ordinary winters of England, though we 
have seen them survive through mild seasons, like the winter of 
1845-6.
Hypericum barbatum is retained among the undoubted 
natives, as is the case with many other pretendedly British plants ; 
for example, Rubus arcticus, Seduni sexangulare, Echinophora spi- 
nosa, &c.
860 
The Oxytropis uralensis of English authors is now named O.
Hal- 
leri {Bunge)y on grounds quoted in the words of Koch, " Planta ura- 
lensis ab europaja differt." 
The remark to the effect that the Eryngium from the banks of the 
Tyne is specifically different from E.
campestre is omitted now; and 
under "E.
campestre" the author says, "I am indebted to Mr. James 
Storey, of Newcastle-upon-Tyne, for specimens from Friar's Goose, 
which are refenible to this species." 
The name of" CEnanthe peucedanifolia {Poll.y is still retained fof 
the species so named by Smith.
It has been distinctly stated in the 
* Phytologist,' by an eye-witness of the fact, and in a paper which has 
been seen by the author of the Manual, that the fruit of Smith's 
plant is subcylindrical in form, and has the callous base obvious even '' 
before maturity (Phytol.
ii.
14 and 15).
Nevertheless, he quotes a 
description of the fruit, which we can apply only to a very immature 
stage, and adds, " Many authors refer the English plant to QE.
silai- 
folia (Bleb.), which has an enlarged callous base to its fruit, accord- 
ing to Koch and Grisebach." The author of the Manual did not 
dare to contradict the description which assigns a callous base to the 
fruit of the English plant, but he passes it by unrecognized, and 
makes a statement which implies a denial.
We could adduce other 
instances of this sly mode of virtually, without actually, contradicting 
the statements of other observers when at variance with views put 
forth or descriptions given by himself on insufficient data.
Fceniculum piperatum {Ten.) is reported as a doubtfully British 
species ; and the habitat of St. Aubin's Bay, Jersey, assigned for it, 
on the authority of the Rev. W.
W. Newbould.
The author of the 
Manual still queries the specific identity of the wild and garden 
plants designated by the name of Fceniculum officinale, on the ground 
of differences in the segments of the leaves, which are "awl-shaped" 
(Hooker), or " capillary " (Babington).
We have seen plants with 
awl-shaped segments around an older plant with capillary segments, 
and to all appearance produced from the seeds of the latter.
Valeriana sambucifolia [Mik.), which was alluded to in the preface 
to the ' Phytologist' for 1846, appears as a true "species universally 
adopted on the continent." The author quotes Fries to this effect: 
" E seminibus educta characteres indicates bene servat, quare ut 
speciem agnoscere cogimur." We cannot, however, allow the con- 
clusive sufficiency of the argument when thus put.
The test of he- 
reditary descent is valuable chiefly for showing forms which are not 
genuine species; that is to say, when the seeds of one alleged species 
851 
produce plants which bear the characters of another species, we may 
safely enough give our verdict against the specific distinctness.
But 
as many varieties, even very trifling varieties, are repeated from ge- 
neration to generation, the simple fact of seeds reproducing only the 
parent form, is by itself an insufl5cient evidence of specijlc distinct- 
ness in that form.
We have above instanced the case of Cerastium 
nigrescens {Edmondstoii), which the author of the Manual now con- 
siders a variety of C.
latifolium, although this latter species or form 
has not yet (that we know of) been produced from the seeds of C.
nigrescens, nor the C.
nigrescens from seeds of latifolium.
Anthemis anglica (<S)?r.) is stated to have been re-discovered at 
Sunderland, by Mr. James Backhouse, in 1844.
But Mr, W.
Wilson's locality of Bearhaven, Ireland, is passed over to Anacyclus 
radiatus {Lois.), which is not adopted as a true British, or rather Hi- 
bernian species.
The Gnaphalium supinum of the Highland mountains was re- 
named " G.
pusillum {Hcenkey^ in the first edition ; the former name 
being still retained for some supposed other species.
In the present 
edition the old name is resumed for the well-known Scottish plant, 
and the supposed second species cashiered into something unknown.
We have seen Mr. Shuttleworth's Swiss plant, to which that expe- 
rienced botanist applies the name of G.
supinum.
It is not quite 
like any of our Scottish specimens ; but we fail to distinguish it 
therefrom as a species.
Differences of age and luxuriance appear to 
account sufficiently well for the alleged distinctive characters.
Our author appears inclined, with other botanists, to degrade Car- 
duus Forsteri from specific rank on the ground of hybridity.
Its 
extreme scarcity, and non-production of fertile seeds, both favour 
this view ; but, if so, what are the parent species ?
The puzzling Car- 
duus found at Saffron Walden, by Mr. Gibson, is placed as a variety 
of C.
acaulis, and the synonym of C.
dubius (Willd.
Flo. Berol.) cited 
for it.
But we find our notes on the species running out to a length which 
suggests the propriety of arresting their course awhile.
Should space 
allow, they may perhaps be resumed and concluded in the next or 
following No.

Further Experiments bearing upon the Specific Identity of the 
Cowslip and Primrose.
By Hewett C.
Watson, Esq.
In the second volume of the * Phy tologist ' (Phytol.
ii.
217) I re- 
corded the result of an experiment by sowing the seeds of a plant, so 
intermediate in its characters between the cowslip and primrose, that 
it might be held a variety of either or a hybrid of both.
The result 
was, that genuine cowslips, genuine primroses, with various interme- 
diates, were all produced from the seeds of the one plant.
Last year 
I repeated the experiment; and on the flowering of the young plants, 
this year, the result is the same.
Such precautions were taken as 
insured an extreme improbability that any seed of a Primula could 
be lurking in the soil used, or could afterwards be carried to it acci- 
dentally.
This time, a smaller number of seeds vegetated, producing 
fourteen young plants, now living, after a few deaths in the family.
Six only of these young plants have flowered this spring, and on 
naming them so as to correspond with my former list, the result is 
numerically thus : â€” 
True cowslip {Primula veris, Lond.
Cat.
&c.) - - 1 ' 
Cowslip passing to oxlip (P.
vei-is var.
major, L.
C.) - 
Oxlip (P.
vulgaris var.
intermedia, L.
C.) - - 1 
Caulescent primroses (P.
vulgaris var.
caidescens, L.
C.) - 3 
True primrose (P.
vulgaris, L.
C, &c.) - - - 1 
Plants producing no flowers this season - - - 8 
The numerical results will appear better another season, when the 
flowerless plants of this year may be strong enough to show what 
they are.
Coincidently with the preceding, I have tried another experiment, 
which has produced a result such as I did not at all anticipate ; and 
which, it may be feared, will make Mr. Marshall still more suspicious 
that there must have been a " hitch " somewhere in the experiment 
(See Phytol.
ii.
285).
I singled out a cowslip, some yards apart from 
any other Primula in my garden, of vigorous growth, but otherwise a 
fair average cowslip in flower and leaf The plant was marked while 
in flower, and ripe seeds afterwards taken and sown, with equal pre- 
cautions, as in the above case of the oxlip, against intermixture with 
the seeds of any other Primula.
From this sowing I have now 
twenty-one young plants alive ; but several of them are very small, 
and only three have produced flowers.
As far as can be determined 
at present, all the young plants possess the ordinary leaves of the 
853 
true cowslip.
But the three flowering examples differ considerably 
in their corollas from the wild cowslip, while they closely resemble 
each other.
By their umbellate inflorescence, short pubescence, and 
broadly toothed calyx, they may be considered cowslips, equally as 
by their leaves ; but their corollas are a third or a half-way towards 
those of the primrose, in size, in form, and in colour.
They might be 
placed as a link between P.
veris and P.
vulgaris, variety intermedia, 
of the London Catalogue ; that is, between the cowslip and the 
' Claygate oxlip.' 
As the wild cowslips and primroses present several very obvious 
dissimilarities, â€” in flowers and leaves, in form, colour, pubescence, 
in mode and time of inflorescence, â€” some skepticism on the point of 
their specific identity is reasonable enough.
Nevertheless, the ulti- 
mate acquiescence in this long-suggested view appears to be inevita- 
able.
Certain assumptions about the laws of hybridity might plau- 
sibly account for some of the facts, yet they will not suffice to explain 
all.
Hybridity would sufficiently account for the appearance of 
intermediate forms ; and the paucity of oxlips, as compared with the 
innumerable cowslips and primroses, is just what might be fairly an- 
ticipated under that theory.
The fertility of the intermediate oxlip, 
or presumed hybrid, is no insuperable difficulty to get over, seeing 
that other hybrids, vegetable and animal, are said to be occasionally 
fertile.
The true difficulty lies in the fact, that the hybrid Primula 
(if such it be) not only reproduces its own likeness in its progeny, 
but the exact counterparts of both the presumed original species also.
Now, would any horse-dealer expect his mules (when fertile) to pro- 
duce indifferently mules, or horses, or asses ?
1 perceive that certain writers in the ' Phytologist ' do not under- 
stand the bearings of these experiments upon some of the great 
problems of science.
In their eyes, accordingly, the repeating and 
recording of such experiments will naturally wear the look of scienti- 
fic peurilities.
But, for my own part, I have no hesitation in 
expressing a conviction, that experiments of this kind, both with 
plants and animals, are at present very much needed ; and that there 
is fair reason to anticipate much important addition to our knowledge 
of the laws of nature, more or less directly arising from them, â€” sup- 
posing them to be made extensively and carefully.
For the purposes of technical or descriptive botany, it is desirable 
to ascertain how widely individual plants or varieties can diff'er from 
the typical character of their species.
And the same remark may be 
equally extended to zoology.

In physiology there are unanswered questions of much interest 
and real importance, connected with the laws of hybridity, hereditary 
transmission of peculiarities, and transmutation of forms and qualities, 
which such experiments are calculated to throw light upon.
And in some ofthe grand (if hypothetical) investigations into the past 
history of the earth and organic nature, which have latterly occupied 
scientific attention, the absence of clearly ascertained facts respecting 
the range of specific variation, has been very strongly felt; and, it 
may be truly added, detrimentally acted upon ; because, in the absence 
of ascertained knowledge, hj^pothetical ideas are substituted in place 
of induction, and cannot be refuted even if erroneous.

BOTANICAL SOCIETY OF LONDON.
Tth May. â€” John Reynolds, Esq., Treasurer, in the chair.
Dr. Parkin, of Brompton, the Rev. J.
F. Crouch, M.A., of Corpus 
Christi College, Oxford, and Mr. R.
Davis, of Pimlico, were elected 
members.
Various donations to the library were announced.
British plants 
had been received from Dr. Wood, Mr. Sansom, Mr. Meehan and 
Mr. Roby, and a collection of Azorean specimens from T.
C. Hunt, 
Esq., H.
M. Consul at St. Michaels.
Mr. Hewett Watson exhibited specimens of an aquatic Ranuculus, 
hitherto unnoticed as a British form in that genus.
In its characters 
it is intermediate between the two groups of varieties (or quasi-spe- 
cies) included under the names of aquatilis and hederaceus ; having 
the floating leaves of aquatilis, with the small flowers of hederaceus.
As far as can be decided while the fruit is immature, the plant ex- 
actly corresponds with the figure of R.
tripartitus in the Atlas of 
Cosson and Germain, making one important exception, in the total 
absence of submersed leaves with the capillary segments.
Fresh ex- 
amples of R.
Lenormandi and R.
hederaceus were shown at the same 
time, in order to illustrate the differences.
Two forms of R.
aquatilis 
were also exhibited ; one with the usual large flowers, the other with 
flowers about half the size ; the latter being possibly R.
Peteveri.
All the five forms were collected the day before, on Esher Common, 
Surrey.
855 ^ 
Mr. Watson also exhibited examples of the true Viola flavicornis 
of Smith in contrast with the V.
canina of Linnaeus.
They were 
brought to the meeting in order to show, by fresh specimens, the dif- 
ferences between the two (both in leaves and flowers), which were 
very perceptible.
Mr. W.
remarked that small specimens of the or- 
dinary V.
canina had been erroneously figured in the ' Supplement to 
'Enghsh Botany' for the V.
flavicornis of Smith, and that Mr. Ba- 
bingtou persisted in repeating the same error in the second edition 
of his Manual (published that day), although he could not fail to 
know now that the application of Smith's name "flavicornis" to the 
plant of the 'Supplement' was an error on the part of Mr. Foi'ster.
Mr. Watson also exhibited a variety of V.
canina with smaller and 
lighter coloured leaves than usual, and a smaller and pale purple or 
pinkish corolla.
He had found the original root several years ago, in 
Surrey, and removed it into his garden, where it had flowered and 
seeded year after year, all the seedling plants springing up around it, 
still resembling the parent plant in size and colour, without a single 
example of the ordinary V.
canina appearing among them.
He ad- 
duced this fact in order to show the hereditary repetition of a variety 
without instances of reversion to the normal characters of the species; 
and that, too, in a character usually deemed so inconstant.
Such a 
repetition is frequently accepted for evidence of specific distinctness; 
and yet cases like this prove its insufficiency.
The secretary stated that he had Dr. Greville's authority to say 
that he never collected Potentilla rupestris on Ben Lawers, and that 
probably some mistake had been made through the similarity of name 
with Potentilla alpestris.
But that it is quite certain that the 
exhibited specimen was P.
rupestris, and it was rightly named on its 
label, although (as now appears), inaccurately localized.
A communication was read from Dr. Parkin "On the Cause of the 
Failure of the Potato Crop," and of epidemic diseases in general, in- 
dicating " that such maladies are not only the effects of volcanic 
action, but also that the immediate cause of their production is the 
generation of a gaseous substance in the internal reservoirs, and its 
extrication into the surrounding atmosphere through the superincum- 
bent strata ; and endeavouring to show that the pathological pheno- 
mena presented by this vegetable pestilence were only reconcileable 
on the supposition that a gaseous, extraneous and deleterious sub- 
stance had been introduced into the interior of the plant." The paper 
went into a train of reasoning to prove this conclusion to be a cor- 
rect one, as indicated by the results of the application, in planting, 
866 
of the different forms of carbon (charcoal), the beneficial operation of 
which appeared to be explained on the supposition that some delete- 
rious and gaseous substance has been absorbed and neutralized.
No 
other cause could account for the success which has attended its em- 
ployment.
The writer argued that it was not as Mr. Jasper Rogers and other 
writers conclude, because charcoal contains within itself that carbo- 
naceous principle which restores to the plant that of which it has 
been deprived (by constitutional debility), that the benefit derived 
from the employment of this substance is to be ascribed, but simply 
to its antiseptic or specific properties, and by its neutralizing some 
gaseous and deleterious substance present in the soil.
Dr. P.
con- 
siders this conclusion important, not only as regards the present cus- 
tom, but also with respect to the operation of manures, more particu- 
larly putrescent ones, at ordinary times.
Hence, his object in 
directing the attention of botanists and agriculturists to this point at 
the present moment.

An adjourned meeting, constituted for the pui-pose of investigating 
the potato-disease, and of more than ordinary public importance, in 
relation to the increasing high price of food, was held on Friday 
evening, at the rooms of the London Botanical Society, Bedford- 
street, Strand; J.
Reynolds, Esq., Treasurer of the Society, in the 
chair.
The Chairman opened the business by calling on the Secretary, 
Mr. G.
E. Dennes, to read the minutes of the last meeting, amongst 
which was a resolution setting forth that the Society wished it to be 
distinctly understood that ihey were unanimous in their opinion of 
the absurdity of the theories brought forward as to the evil produced 
to the potato crop by insects, and more particularly by the Aphis 
vastator.
The Secretaky then read a communication from Mr. Jasper W.
Rogers, C.E., presenting to the Society two essays, published this 
month by him, on the potato disease, its causes and prevention, and 
which were presented to the Government of Ireland previous to the 
labours of the Potato Commissioners, in 1845, and submitted to the 
Royal Dublin Society, and the Royal Agricultural Society of Eng- 
land, in 1846.
The communication stated that Mr. Rogers's object 
was not to detract from Dr. Parkins's merit or originality of idea ; 
857 
and after observing that it was a well-known fact that the same 
thoughts have struck men's minds simultaneously, although hundreds 
of miles asunder, and led them, although acted upon by different in- 
fluences, to identical conclusions, ended in soliciting public replies 
to the following questions : â€” 
" Does the potato contain the quantity of nutritive matter I have 
pointed out ?
" And will not the same extent of land, cultivated at the same cost, 
produce, on the average, at least three times the weight of dry matter, 
or meal, from the potato, that can be produced from wheat ?
" Does not the potato possess the same capability as wheat of 
being converted into meal and flour, at least equally fitted for storage 
and preservation, as food for man ?
" Why, then, should we use it solely as a boiled vegetable ?
" Would it be more barbarous and ungrateful now to only boil 
wheat, and use it as our forefathers have done as ' furmety,' and then 
say wheat should be banished the land, than to save ourselves the 
trouble of making the potato into meal and flour for bread, that we 
now cry out to banish it ?
" In omitting to make ourselves aware of the real capabilities and 
uses of the potato, do we not ignoranlly abuse a generous blessing ?
" In a word, are the means to aid ourselves in our hands, both as 
to the preservation and proper use of the potato, and if so, whether 
should we use them or pray for the grant of some other blessing, to 
be, perhaps, equally abused and forgotten ?
Mr. Rogers, then, at the request of the chairman, stated that the 
disease of the potato, in his opinion, had arisen from planting it in 
the Spring in place of the Autunui ; that by doing so, the potato, 
being placed in the pit or clamp when taken out of the ground, was 
in a warmer atmosphere during the winter than it would be if lying 
on the ground ; that therefore it grew or shot forth, and the growth 
or shoots being afterwards taken off when it came to be planted in 
spring, it followed that the offspring must be weak in proportion to 
the extent of life which the shoot took from the tuber.
That the 
winter quarters of the last ten or twelve years have been of a tempe- 
rature nearly equal to the spring quarters of former years ; and that 
therefore the growth in the pit has been considerably more for the 
last ten or twelve years than formerly ; and of course that, in propor- 
tion as that growth in the pit increased, so must the vitality of the 
potato be diminished, because all the shoots left behind were so 
much of the life absolutely lost.
Now, the remedy for that was, 
858 
simply to plant the potato in autumn in place of spring, because, as 
the shoots came forth, directed by Nature, they would progress, or be 
otherwise affected according to Nature's will.
Nothing, therefore, 
could be lost of the whole vital principle to be derived from the tuber, 
which is absolutely essential in order to the production of a strong 
offspring.
That in planting in autumn no evil need be apprehended 
from frost during the winter; that even, if the potato be frozen in 
the ground, and thaw gradually afterwards, it will not be injured in 
its vital principle.
That, as regards the productive value of the po- 
tato as a food for man, it was equally capable of being converted 
into meal and Hour for use, in bread, soups, porridge, jelly, plumonge, 
&c., as the meal and flour of wheat and oats, and was even more ca- 
pable of being preserved by storage.
Bread, he might add, had been 
made from the potato so far back as the year 1814, for the use of the 
French prisoners at Dartmoor ; and by desire of the Irish Govern- 
ment, he (Mr. Rogers) carried into effect the manufacture of meal, 
flour, &c., from diseased potatoes at the South Union of Dublin ; 
that he there had bread, soups, jellies, plumonges, cakes of all kinds, 
Siudi porridge, for the use of the paupers, and invited about 150 of the 
scientific men of Dublin to partake of the dejeuner, served in the 
Board-room of the South Union ; and that every description of food 
was pronounced to be excellent ; and that it was shown a saving of 
Â£1,500 a year could have been effected in feeding the paupers of the 
Union, by the paupers themselves manufacturing the potato into 
meal and flour ; and that the medical officers of the establishment 
also pronounced the food to be of the best description.
Dr. BossEY here asked Mr. Rogers what quantity of "gluten" was 
contained in the potato in compavison with wheat.
Mr. Rogers replied, that the actual quantit}' of gluten (that which 
creates the bone and muscle of animals) contained in the dry matter, 
or meal of the potato, was only about '2| per cent, less than contained 
in the dry ruatter, or meal of wheat, and that the same quantity of 
ground cultivated with potatoes would produce three times the weight 
of dry matter as the same extent of ground cultivated with wheat j 
that in addition, the whole dry matter of the potato was always capa- 
ble of being made use of in bread, while the whole dry matter of 
wheat was not, insomuch as the bran (in which the greater portions of 
the gluten remained) was solely used for the food of animals ; conse- 
quently, that the genei'al value of the meal or flour of the potato was 
above that of the flour of wheat, and that the usual first flour of wheat, 
in reality, only contained 8 or 9 per cent, of gluten.
(Mr. Rogers 
859 
here exhibited whole meal, meal, inferior flour, and first flour, made 
from diseased potatoes, by the paupers of the South Union of Dublin, 
which were examined and tasted with much interest and curiosity, 
by the gentlemen composing the meeting.
The meal had all the ap- 
pearance of that made of oats and peas, and the flour was as white 
and fine as that produced fi-om wheat.) 
Dr. BossEY asked Mr. Rogers, could it be possible that the potato 
contained one-seventh of gluten ?
Mr. Rogers replied, that the tables which he had given were com- 
piled by Sir Robert Kane, and from all the leading French chemists, 
who understand infinitely more of the potato than we do ourselves ; 
that he did not wish the meeting to depend at all on his ipse dixit, but 
that they would find, in addition to those authorities, that the analysis 
subsequently made by the Potato Commissioners, also by Professor 
Johnson and by Mr. Fromberg, all agreed as to the quantity of gluten, 
or more properly speaking, " protean compound," which was actually 
in the potato.
Dr. Ayres was of opinion that the quantity of gluten stated by Mr.
Rogers could not exist in the potato, inasmuch as there was such a 
quantity of aqueous matter in it as 75 per cent.
His opinion was, 
that the " nitrogenous " matter in the potato was much less than in 
wheat ; and he was also of opinion, that there was much less of nitro- 
genous matter in the potato than in peas, beans, or barley.
The Chairman.
â€” What are the proportions, Mr. Rogers, of gluten 
in wheat and in the potato ?
Mr. Rogers.
â€” About 14 per cent, of gluten in the dry matter of the 
potato, and about l/g- per cent, in the dry matter of the wheat.
The Chairman.
â€” What is the quantity of dry matter contained in 
the potato ?
Mr. Rogers replied, that the average was 25 per cent., or one- 
fourth.
The Chairman.
â€” Have you taken into consideration the quantity 
of wheat and potatoes produced in a given quantity of land ?
Mr. Rogers was glad the Chairman had asked him that question, 
as it afforded him the opportunity to state an interesting fact.
His 
calculations were made according to the experience of the French 
chemists, who took the average of about nine tons of potatoes per acre ; 
while it was a fact now well known that above thirty tons of potatoes 
had been frequently produced from the Irish acre, when properly cul- 
tivated.
860 
Dr. BossEY wished to know what was the quantity of aqueous mat- 
ter in the potato, to which 
Mr. Rogers replied, that it might be averaged from 72 to 78 per 
cent.
Mr. WooLLETT asked whether the process was not more simple in 
the preparation of meal and flour from the potato than from wheat ?
Mr. Rogers replied, that it would be infinitely more simple, and 
that any farmer who had the apparatus for making cheese, would, by 
the addition of a common bread-grater, be enabled to prepare 
meal and flour for his household use.
Mr. Rogers then described 
the operation to consist in grating the potato on a bread-grater into 
a tub of water : the whole matter, when grated, settles down to the 
bottom, and, after changing the water two or three times, becomes fit 
to be placed in a cloth made up in the shape of a small parcel ; and 
the water being pressed out of it by means of a cheese-press, or com- 
mon lever, the cake thus formed may be dried on a cloth or tray before 
the fire, and on being broken up by the hand, and run through a com- 
mon coffee-mill, will present the whole meal of the potato.
This 
whole meal, sifted in the same way that the farmer sifts the whole 
meal of wheat, will give the different descriptions of flour required for 
household use.
Mr. WooLLETT thought that much of the nutriment would go off in 
the water.
Mr. Rogers said his impression was that little, if any, went off so ; 
iDut that if it did, the analysis made by the French chemists and others 
had been on the dry material, and that, therefore, whatever quantity 
had gone off in the water was not taken into account in the tables 
given.
Dr. BossEY was curious to know what quantity of potatoes was con- 
sidered necessary to support a working man per day, he asked the 
question in relation to the quantity of nutriment necessary per day to 
support a man.
Mr. Rogers replied, that those of his poor countrymen who had 
nothing else but the potato to live upon, usually used three-quarters 
of a stone a day, in three divisions or meals ; and that that was his 
principal reason for so strongly advocating the preparation of meal 
and flour from the potato, in order that they might obtain its nutritious 
value in a properly condensed state, in place of being obliged to gorge 
themselves with 75 per cent, of useless aqueous matter contained in 
the potato when only boiled.
He would not, however, be understood to 
advocate altogether the discontinuance of the use of the potato in its 
861 
" boiled " state ; but he had proved that it could be more beneficially 
brought into use in other forms.
Mr. WooLLETT was desirous, before the meeting separated, to com- 
municate an opinion that was daily gaining ground amongst experi- 
enced farmers, that the potato-disease would soon disappear; and 
that the potato would again be restored to its healthy state.
He was 
also anxious to bring under the notice of the Society a singular and 
interesting fact connected with the diseased potato, that had come 
under his own observation in Suffolk, namely, that the potatoes which 
were found to be diseased in August, and which were left in the ground 
as not worth digging, shot forth again in the spring, and produced 
good gi'owth and sound, the only difference between them and pota- 
toes before the disease being that they were a little darker.
Mr. Rogers bore Mr. Woollett out in this statement, having him- 
self witnessed it ; and information from Ireland, within the last few 
weeks, represented that in many instances where potatoes had been 
abandoned in the ground as totally useless, they had every appear- 
ance of producing good crops this year.
He rejoiced at the experi- 
ments which the famine had led to as to the value of the potato; and 
notwithstanding all the attempts which had been made to cry it 
down, and to abolish it, he believed in his heart there was infinitely 
more value in it than in wheat, inasmuch as the same quantity of 
land would produce three times more than could be produced from 
wheat.
And was it not, he would ask, monstrous in the face of such 
a fact, to conceive that the use of the potato, so valuable, should be 
abolished, and that such a recommendation should come from lead- 
ing men of the country } Let them look at the thing in its proper 
light, and consider, if the potato be abolished, how can three acres of 
land be added to the cultivatable soil of the country for the purpose 
of producing wheat, for each acre that is now used to produce po- 
tatoes.
Mr. Franklin Coxworthy addressed some remarks to the Society 
on his opinions as to the cause of the potato-disease, and on mete- 
orological influences.
After which, on the motion of Mr. Woollett, the thanks of the 
Society were voted to Mr. Rogers for his statements, and the meeting 
resolved itself into a conversational party.

hothouses of the gardens.
Dr. Balfour exhibited a piece of turf containing numerous fresh 
specimens of Primula Scotica, received from the vicinity of Thurso, 
through the kindness of R.
Heddle, Esq., who remarks that the plant, 
which is common all along the northern shores of Caithness, flowers 
several times a year, from May to December ; and that in the later 
flowering specimens the limb of the corolla is much thrown back.
He also mentions P.
acaulis as common, but has never observed P.

Notes on Viola odorata, and its Occurrence in Fifeshire, 8jc.
By George Lawson, Esq.
The sweet purple violet is a sweet flower indeed : the very mention 
of its name calls to our minds thoughts of the most pleasing character ; 
â€” our hearts throb with happy emotion â€” and a thousand scenes of 
loveliness are called to our recollection.
Sunny braes and shady 
864 
banks, lofty hills and lowly vales, where are scattered "free and 
wild " the bright gems of Flora, and where we used to wander to be- 
hold their beauty.
It is with feelings of delight, indeed, that the 
lover of nature â€” he "whose pleasures are in wild fields gathered ;" he 
to whom " the meanest flower that blows can give thoughts that do 
often lie too deep for tears," â€” it is with heartfelt delight, indeed, that 
he gazes on the first flower of the spring â€” the little herald of "joyous 
summer time." He reads in its humble flowers of coming pleasures.
He admires the sweet thing for its own sake, as, in its humility, it 
shyly peeps from under the green herbage of its shaded bank, â€” he 
enjoj's its simple beauty and its delicious fragrance â€” and not only 
those of the little flower itself, but the dear remembrance of many 
another sweet gem which it calls to memory.
He reads in its bright 
flowers of the coming of the blushing rose and the briar ; of the pale 
primrose, the purple heather, and the lowly lily of the vale, â€” yes, and 
of many more.
During the present season I have had the pleasure (and it has been 
to me a real heartfelt pleasure) of finding the sweet violet in several 
localities in this county.
From the interest attached to the plant, as 
well as from its being considered " very rare in Scotland," I am in- 
duced to send you a note of these localities for the ' Phytologist.' I 
do not set down the plant as indigenous at each of the following 
stations, or indeed any one of them ; but it seems quite naturalized at 
all of them : and I believe that it can only be considered in the light 
of a naturalized plant to Scotland.
The first station which T desire to record is the north bank of the 
beautiful river Eden, just a short way up the river from the fine old 
bridge of Dairsie, and at the foot of the declivity, at the top of which 
rear in sacred majesty up through the surrounding lofty trees, the ve- 
nerable time-worn church and spire, and the crumbling ivied ruins of 
the old castle.
Here 1 find the plant growing profusely upon the 
steep banks, and even descending to the flat ground within two feet or 
so of the river.
And here have I frequently enjoyed a calm and serene 
wander along the green margin of the placid river, when, under the 
kindly shade of osiers and bird-cherries, the little violet peeped 
modestly forth, and flung its sweet odours to the passing zephyr.
It 
likewise grows in some profusion on a steep sunny bank on the out- 
side of the wall that encloses the old burying-ground on the south 
side.
And here it is delightful to see the sweet things basking in an 
April noon-day sun, and an early wild bee wandering from flower to 
flower gathering honied treasures.
I may here offer a remark in regard 
865 
to the situation of the little bracteas on the scape, as a distinctive 
character betwixt this species and the V.
hirta.
The words of Mr.
Curtis, as quoted at page 36 of vol.
i. of Hook.
Brit.
Flora, ed.
v., in 
regard to this character, are, " here (that is, in hirta) below, in V.
odorata, above the middle." At the Dairsie station for odorata I have 
observed many scapes with their bracteas far below the middle of the 
scape, and many more whose bracteas seemed so exactly in the mid- 
dle, that it was quite impossible to say that they were either above or 
below it.
However, by far the greater number of individuals that I 
have seen (and I have examined some hundreds) have their bracteas 
above the middle of the scape, although this certainly cannot by any 
means be considered a constant character.
I am led to think that the 
situation of the bracteas is much more constant in V.
hirta than in the 
species more particularly before our notice, as last month, while on a 
visit to Dundee, 1 examined numerous specimens (of hirta) at Wills 
braes near that town, in company with my esteemed friend Mr. John 
Sime, and with some difficulty found only a few examples of the 
bracteas being about the middle, and but one with these slightly above 
it.
On referring to the " mummies'''' I possess of the growth of former 
years, I find some specimens of hirta with the bracteas very near to 
the base of the scape ; but none showing these even near so far up as 
the middle.
In specimens I have of V.
odorata, from Derbyshire and 
Forfarshire (the former gatliered by Mr. Joseph Whittaker of Bread- 
sail, the latter by myself) the bracteas are all far above the middle.
My observations lead me to conclude that genei^ally the bracteas are 
in V.
hirta below, and in V.
odorata above the middle of the scape, 
but that the exceptions to these rules are of so frequent occurrence as 
to render them unsuitable as characters of distinction.
The next station 1 have to record for our sweet gem is the Douket 
Hill,* at Craig-foodie, where it grows in great profusion under the leafy 
shade of many trees.
Here the violet grows luxuriantly, and quite 
wild-like : I understand it has done so for many years ; but it has 
probably been originally an escape from Craig-foodie garden, of which 
the station is in the immediate vicinage.
At Clayton the violet grows profusely in the turf of the pleasure- 
grounds ; but the frequent mowing of the grass prevents the flower- 
buds from bursting into blossoms, for they are generally cut off" before 
they reach maturity.
Here there cannot be a doubt that the plant is 
* In plainer English, Dove-cot Hill, so named from a dove-cot or pigeon-house 
standing upon it.
866 
only naturalized ; the more clearly does this appear when it is seen 
growing side by side with the daffodil and the crocus, neither of which 
can, by any mortal, be considered indigenous.
A few straggling plants of the violet grow on the remains of the old 
gateway at Airdit, and near to a little shady bank where the snowdrop 
so pure and pale raises its little flowers.
These sweet things both 
seem wild at Airdit ; but there can be no doubt of their having at one 
time escaped from the garden, which, in the days of old, it was their 
part to lend their beauty in ornamenting.
The mansion and gardens 
are now no more; but these flowers remain to tell of the glory and 
grandeur and gaiety that is gone.
The violet likewise grows in Earls' Hall Wood, near to what used 
to be the entrance to the principal approach to the hall.
The plant 
is not very plentiful at this place, and may probably have wandered 
from the hall garden, although it is now full half-a-mile from it.
It 
seems naturalized here.

Notice of '^ The Elements of Botany, Structural and Physiological, 8fc.
By John Lindley, Ph. D., F.R.S., &c.' 
This is avowedly a fifth edition of the ' Outlines of the First Prin- 
ciples of Botany,' with additions.
We are told in the Preface, that 
" the author has taken advantage of the oppoi'tunity thus aflForded him 
of bringing it completely up to the state of botanical knowledge, 
without, however, interfering with its original plan, by the introduction 
of doubtfid or merely speculative matter, or of questions which do not 
interest a student.
It was in the outset a book for learners ; its pur- 
pose was to state plainly and concisely the great facts of the science, 
and to separate them from the ulterior questions to which they lead," 
&c.
"The book is for learners, and not for proficients ; the author 
regards it in no other light, and puts it forth with no higher preten- 
tions." "The true purpose of the work being thus explained, the 
reason why many things have been omitted will become obvious â€” 
they are of no importance to students.
This is the case with minute 
anatomy, which cannot be prosecuted far in a Botanical course, and 
which, however interesting and important it may be, has no obvious 
bearing upon Vegetable Physiology, when carried beyond what is 
taught in the following pages.
The theory of Spiral Structure, which 
867 
is wholly omitted, does not effect any question which students are in-r 
terested about ; in like manner, the obscure and disputed phenomena 
of Vegetable Fertilization, of Irritability and other vital actions, of the 
little modifications discoverable among seeds and fruits, the structure 
of Cryptogams, belong to a class of facts which can only be dealt with 
by those who have advanced beyond the state of pupillage." 
Of a work planned to meet this purpose, written by an experienced 
teacher and botanist of the highest attainments, and improved and 
corrected through five successive editions, â€” what can we say, or be 
expected to say, except that the work is perfect after its kind; the 
purpose and promise being fulfilled in a satisfactory manner.
It may 
signify little that we, while confessing ourselves inexperienced in 
tuition, do nevertheless deem some of the excluded matters more im- 
portant to students than are some of those which are allowed place 
and notice in the volume.
Such diversities of opinion are certain to 
arise; and that they are not differences which arise only from the re- 
lative position of the parties as instructors or the contrary, might be 
made evident enough by comparing the elementary works of various 
different teachers ; some of whom obviously attach great importance 
to the very points which Dr. Lindley passes by.
The instructor is 
unavoidably biassed in judgment by the natural peculiarities of his 
own mind, by those of his education, by his individual objects and pur- 
suits in life, &c.
So likewise must be the student ; whether medical, 
agricultural, chemical, or otherwise.
We take it, however, that Academical lectures to students, and 
books to be used in connexion therewith, do apply, in far the majority 
of cases, to medical students chiefly ; and to this class we believe that 
the " obscure and disputed phenomena of Vegetable Fertilization, of 
Irritability and other vital actions " are matters of much interest and 
importance, because a comparison between the functions of animal 
life and those of vegetable life tends to their mutual elucidation.
We take it this should be a leading object in botanical classes for me- 
dical students.
Our academical and professional lecturers on botany, 
however, in their attempts to persuade medical students that botanical 
science is oi some use to the medical practitioner, do seldom convince 
them of anything better than the fact, that no practical advantage is 
ever likely to arise to them, from the little knowledge of botany which 
they are compelled by regulations to acquire.
But to pursue this 
subject here would be out of place.
Could we have our own way, we 
would absolve all medical students from their compulsory attendance 
at botanical lectures; as consuming time and intellectual labour which 
868 
might be given to other professional studies with far more compensat- 
ing advantages.
But as we cannot effect this boon and benefit for 
the unlucky students, we should like well to see their abhorred bo- 
tanical lectures i-endered interesting and useful (at least, not quite so 
uninteresting and unuseful) by a tacit understanding between teacher 
and students, that he should teach them botany just so far as it can 
be shown to bear upon their professional views and knowledge, with- 
out exacting, from them any farther acquaintance with the subject.
But the ' Elements of Botany ' is a work of course addressed to stu- 
dents generally ; and if practically for medical students more than for 
others, it is still intended for them as general learners of botany, and 
not as learners of the medical bearings and uses of that science.
As 
such, it must be viewed ; and as such, it is undoubtedly a very useful 
and instructive work.
Many a botanist, who deems himself far above 
" pupillage," might profit by perusal of its pages ; and truly we say 
this on our individual experience.
We have s;'en newspaper Editors 
candidly state that they lived by finding fault; for, if they commended 
only that which pleased them, and avoided that which displeased, they 
would soon cease to be read.
There is much in the ' Elements ' which 
pleases, â€” a little which displeases.
Illustrations of each may be 
drawn fi-om a chapter on " the Manner of Studying" â€” no useless ad- 
dition to the ' Elements of Botany.' 
" Take any common flowering plant," says our author, " no matter 
what, and examine every part of its structure, making careful drawings 
of what you see, and securing preparations for examination at a future 
time." " There can be no doubt that the exact investigation of the 
structure, in all particulars, of the commonest plant, tends more to a 
correct knowledge of botany than the superficial examination of all 
the plants in nature." " Such an investigation forms an exact standard 
of structure, to which all other cases may be compared." "As soon as 
the structure of one plant is ascertained, another should be taken, and 
the points in which it resembles or diflfers from the first subject noted 
down, and, if possible, also drawn.
A continual repetition of this 
operation with fresh plants is what eventually leads to botanical 
knowledge." 
This advice is sound ; and it is so simply because it directs the 
mind of the learner nearly in the same course that nature herself does.
Individualities are the first steps in all departments of knowledge ; 
and exact individualities are the foundation of science.
But we must 
dissent widely indeed from the soundness of our author's advice, when 
he goes on to say, "At first, species should be little attended to, 
869 
genei'a more, and natural orders very much." We have no doubt 
that Dr. Ltndley commenced his botanical knowledge with " species," 
and not with "natural orders;" and the very terms in which he com- 
mences the chapter under consideration are at variance with this 
subsequent advice.
He bids the student " Take any common flower- 
ing plant" and "examine every part of its structure." What is this 
but studying the species ?
If attention to orders were the right way of 
commencing the study, why not say instead "Take a bundle of Com- 
positae, and examine those characters in which they correspond," &c., &c.
But Dr. Lindley is not the author to be charged with advice- 
giving on no plausible reasons ; although, in this instance, we cannot 
admit the sufficiency of his reasons ; namely, " Because," he writes, 
"in a vast science like Botany, containing perhaps 100,000 so-called 
species, distributed through about 9,000 genera, collected under 
scarcely more than 300 natural orders, the mind becomes bewildered 
unless the smallest groups are first investigated.
That is to say, 300 
distinctions are more easily remembered than 9,000." But if Dr.
Lindley will take the trouble to throw the implied assertions con- 
tained in the quoted passage, into the form of syllogisms, he will find 
his reasoning insufficient to establish his conclusion.
We meet it in 
the more familiar manner, by asking whether a child requires to know 
100,000 specific distinctions, or 9,000 generic distinctions, or 300 
ordinal distinctions, before learning to know " buttercups and daisies," 
as the song of Mary Howitt runs ?
â€” or whether, the student of British 
botany may not perfectly well know the species of British plants, that 
is, quite as well as they are known by Dr. Lindley himself, without 
learning the distinctions of all other species, genera, and orders ?
The 
truth is, real knowledge is always special â€” always specific.
General 
ideas are only vague ideas where the mind cannot give them special 
illustrations, that is, cannot represent them by specific facts or objects.
The very names of the orders in botany accord herewith.
They are 
either taken from some single point of structure (Compositae, Cruciferae, 
Leguminosae, &c.) or imply a comparison of all the included species 
with some special type or example (Ranunculaceae, Liliaceae, &c.).
Dr. Lindley adds also, " Nor can the power of generalizing be so 
readily acquired, as when the student habitually descends from gene- 
rals to particulars." This, again, seems just the reverse of the fact.
All 
correct generalization is an ascent fi'om particulars to generals.
It is 
true, we may often advantageously reason downwards from generals to 
particulars, after the general ideas have been acquired ; but their first 
clear acquisition comes through particular and special knowledge.

, 5 Q 
870 
Whatever differences of opinion we may entertain respecting some 
of the author's i*ecommendations on the "manner of studying," we 
shall certainly not express any against his concluding and pithy remark 
that " neither they nor any others have real value in the absence of 
Method, Zeal, and Perseverance." 
What an instructive botanical sermon might be wi'itten upon this 
text !
How strikingly does the deficiency of any one of these three 
qualities detract from the results of the other two !
We know indi- 
viduals of really contracted mental power, who have risen to more 
than respectable eminence in the scientific world, by a happy combi- 
nation of these three qualities.
And, on the contrary, we know indi- 
viduals of higher mental calibre, whose botanical efforts have been 
greatly impeded by the want of one of them.
There is doubtless a 
natural adaptation to botanical pursuits, to be included among the 
requisites ; but this may be said to constitute the chief ingredient of 
true zeal, which is simply a strong mental impulse in a determinate 
direction.
Turn to another portion of the work, and see, reader, what Professor 
Lindley bluntly writes on cell-formation, &c.
" The manner in which 
the elementary organs are developed is at present uncertain." In a 
foot-note he enters more explicitly on his reasons for making this (we 
fear, too true) statement.
"The reader who has never investigated this 
subject for himself, and who is unacquainted with its difficulties, may 
be surprised at this statement ; but I can come to no other conclusion.
In fact, the uncertainty of the facts to which evidence points, and the 
enormous obstacles that exist in determining what are facts and not 
deceptive appearances, are sufficiently shown by the conflicting 
opinions entertained by the most accomplished observers.
When 
men like Mirbel, Mohl, Schleiden, and Nageli, are directly opposed 
to each other, although their lives have been largely devoted to the 
pursuit of the inquiry, the prudent man will pause before he forms his 
opinion." 
Now, when we think of the quantity of pages written on the forma- 
tion of cells or cell-membrane, and regard that as some measure, on a 
very reduced scale, of the quantity of time and labour devoted to the 
subject, it is almost painful to acknowledge that the result is yet nil.
The author of the ' Vestiges,' wishing to show that the opinions of 
most cultivators of science are valueless in great general views, says 
sarcastically that " facts the most minute make scientific reputations." 
871 
Should any satirical botanist call that clever author's attention to Dr.
Lindley's frank admission, and at same time inform him that many 
botanists found much of their pretensions to scientific eminence upon 
microscopical observations on the formation of cells, he might well feel 
warranted in applying more depreciating expressions than the simple 
term " minute." Suppose he should write that " Facts the most mi- 
nute, uncertain and useless, have made scientific reputations." Sup- 
pose he should thus write, we ask, who could say the sarcasm is un- 
true ?
Nevertheless, we trust a time will come, when certainty and 
value may be found in such microscopical investigations ; and at all 
events they now serve for innocent amusement to a class of scientific 
minds which are fitted by nature to look after "facts the most 
minute ; " and minute facts may still be important facts.
C. 
Notice of a ' Manual of British Botany.
By C.
C. Babington, M.A.' 
(Concluded from page 851).
â€¢' 
We resume our comments upon some of the ideas and descriptions 
published in this valuable work ; having before glanced over its 
contents as far as the order Compositge.
The author now follows the continental botanists, in substituting 
the name of Achillea decolorans {Schrad.), in place of Achillea 
serrata {Retz), hitherto applied to a very dubious British plant, which 
is said not to be the species intended by Retz.
It is curious that 
neither the species of Retz, nor the species of Smith, to both of which 
the name " serrata" has been given, should have any certainly known 
native country.
The former has been very doubtfully located in 
Switzerland or Siberia ; and the latter, in Derbyshire.
We do not.
know how far Babington's second English locality for Smith's species, 
that of Temple Cloud, Somerset, on the authority of Mr. Flower, can 
be relied upon as a correct and native habitat.
Filago apiculata {G.
E. Smith) is not adopted in the Manual.
We 
think this alleged species merits further examination.
There can be 
little doubt that it is really the same thing as Filago Jussiaei (Coss.
and Germ.) ; and the omission of some points from the descriptions of 
each quasi-species, those which are less variable being retained, might 
remove the objections against F.
apiculata, urged in a former No.
(See 
Phytol.
ii.
760).
, 
872 
Centaurea nigrescens {Willd.) is adopted for a species distinct 
from C.
nigra, and from a variety " radiata" of C.
nigra.
Centaurea 
Jacea (Z.) is retained as a British species, also, but the author inti- 
mates that he has himself seen no native specimens.
This appears 
remarkable enough, seeing that his friend Mr. Borrer is the authority- 
cited for the occurrence of C.
Jacea in Sussex.
Angus and Belfast 
are the two other localities indicated ; and it would thus appear that 
the C.
Jacea occurs in England, Scotland, and Ireland.
Is not the 
plant so called just the same thing as our author's C.
nigrescens, 
plentiful in some of the most southern counties of England ?
Thrincia hirta affords an example of the author's resolute ad- 
herence to a bad (because very inconstant) character, after its 
inconstancy has been strongly and explicitly pointed out.
The words 
" involucre glabrous " are reprinted from the former edition, in the 
specific character of T.
hirta.
This inaccuracy becomes the more 
likely to mislead, because the variety " dubia" of the former edition, 
distinguished by having its "involucral scales hairy," is now sup- 
pressed, although formerly alleged to be "probably a distinct species." 
It is curious to find varieties deemed not worth mentioning in 1847, 
although four years before they had been thought " probably distinct 
species." We hail these changes as so many indications that the 
author's taste for species-making has been checked by the freely ex- 
pressed comments upon that trouble-creating practice.
However, the 
avowed existence of such a variety is sufficient to prove the author's 
knowledge that the character of " involucre glabrous " was unsound 
for specific diagnosis; and instances of hairy or hispid involucres are 
so frequent that any botanist may find them.
Why is the inaccurate 
character reprinted ?
We can scarcely suppose it to have been done 
in a spirit of petulant opposition against a critic of the former edition, 
w^ho questioned the alleged probable distinctness of the variety ' du- 
bia,' because "the involucrum varies in all degrees from glabrous to 
very hairy." And yet this, in connexion with other similar reiterations 
of errors, almost justifies such an answer to the query.
In the troublesome genus Hieracium, the species of which are yet 
so imperfectly ascertained and agreed upon, wide differences of opinion 
may be expected to prevail, not only between different botanists, but 
even with the same botanist at different times.
The two editions of 
the Manual are illustrations of the latter ; changed names and changed 
views of species occur to an extent which Vestigians might hail as an 
indirect evidence that perfectly definite species have no existence out 
of books, or in them either.
H. nigrescens ( Willd.) is now adopted 
873 
as an ascertained British species, and the figure of H.
pnlmonariura, 
Eng. Bot.
2307, interrogatively referred to as a representation of it.
We believe this to be correct, as was (first, we think,) announced in 
the ' Phy tologist ' two or three yeai's ago.
In place of H.
sylvaticum 
(Sin.) we now find H.
vulgatum [Fries) ; although we do not under- 
stand the grounds upon which Smith's name for his well known plant 
has been thus cashiered to make room for another.
The H.
diapha- 
num [Fries) of the former edition is subdivided into two species, and 
the name of diaphanum dismissed ; H.
Lawsoni [Sinith) being 
resumed as a specific name for one of the two, and H.
Schmidtii 
[Tausch) being conferred upon the other.
If we understand the plant 
intended under this latter name, we can quite concur with the author 
of the Manual in again separating it from Lawsoni, and not (as done 
by Fries) referring to it for Smith's pulmonarium.
But our plant 
comes very near to murorum and sylvaticum ; as also is the case with 
another dubious Highland plant, apparently unnoticed by the author 
of the Manual, which may be the H.
incisum [Hoppe).
The flowers 
of H.
Lawsoni are said to be " cream-coloured ; " though to our eyes 
they are of a bright yellow inclining to lemon-colour, and as little 
meriting the term "cream-coloured" as any of the indigenous species.
We do not see how Lawsoni and Lapeyrousii are to be distinguished ; 
since two or three leaves added upon the stem of the former, below its 
branches, appears to make it into an example of the latter.
H. rigi- 
dum (" Hartm.^'' Fr.) of the former edition is now split into two species ; 
namely, H.
tridentatum [Fries) and H.
rigidum (Fries).
As a coun- 
terbalance to the increase of species by these " splits," we find the H.
sabaudum [L.) and H.
boreale (Fries) of the earlier edition re-com- 
bined into a single species ; the latter name being retained for the 
united brace.
This is going back to the ' English Flora,' with a change 
of name from sabaudum to boreale.
They are, however, still described 
as two subordinate forms ; the fruit of boreale being called " dark 
brown or nearly black," and that of sabaudum " usually red." Such 
differences are scarcely more than those of age ; the fruits of many 
Hieracia running though the stages of pale green, yellowish, red, 
mahogany, brown, blackish, in their advance to maturity.
We happen 
to know that practical botanists of many years' experience, found great 
difficulty in applying to their specimens the names and descriptions of 
the Hieracia, as given in the former edition of the Manual ; and the fol- 
lowing tabular comparison of the names here mentioned may therefore 
prove useful.
It will, at any rate, afford an useful lesson on the uncertain- 
ty of our present nomenclature, which will undergo yet other changes.

In Erica the author still retains his own pet, "E.
Mackaiana 
(Bab.),''' as a genuine species ; and he still omits to notice at all the 
equally remarkable Cornish variety, alluded to in the ' British Flora.' 
This omission will not elevate the author's reputation as a man of sci- 
ence ; and it is only in its bearings upon science that we here men- 
tion the point.
The Mackaiana [Bab.) has the leaves of ciliaris, with 
the flowers of Tetralix ; while the Watsoni [Benth.) has the leaves 
of Tetralix, with flowers like those of ciliaris.
The existence of 
these two crossing varieties, as they may be termed, lessens the pro- 
bability that either of them is a true species.
It is therefore remark- 
able to find only the one, which our author stands sponsor for, con- 
sidered to be deserving of notice in the Manual.
But there is doubt- 
less truth in the adage which predicts strangulation to a dog with a bad 
name ; and the Cornish heath may possibly have received a name 
not acceptable to the author of the Manual ; having been described 
in De Candolle's Prodromus under the name above mentioned.
Both 
varieties, in their extreme forms, do look very like species ; but the 
links of connexion with Tetralix are so close as to render their dis- 
tinctness very questionable, to say the least.
In Orobanche several changes occur.
The species which English 
botanists have hitherto designated " O.
major [Linn.) " is re-named 
" O.
rapum [Thuill)^'' on faith of Fries, who deems the Linnean O.
major to be our O.
elatior.
O. barbata (" Poir^') of the former edi- 
tion now appears with the substituted name of O.
Hederae [Duby), in 
consequence of Koch stating that the English species is not the true 
barbata.
The Rev. Mr.
Here's Cornish plant is adopted as a spe- 
cies, under the name by which it has been already recorded in the 
' Phytologist,' that of O.
amethystea [Thiiill).
Another species is 
added under name of 0.
arenaria [Bork.), about which we must ven- 
ture to remain a little sceptical.
Tlie alleged " O.
lucorum [Branny^ 
is not noticed as a British plant.
Primula vulgaris and P.
veris are still retained for distinct species ; 
nor can we censure this continued separation of two quasi- species 
which have several characters of dissimilarity so strongly marked.
875 
Supposing the specific identity of these two to be made certain, and 
necessarily admitted by botanists, we might question twenty thou- 
sand other presumed species.
The English name " oxlip " is incor- 
rectly given to the Primula elatior {Jacq.) ; for English rustics intend 
the umbel-bearing varieties of P.
vulgaris by that name.
In Euphorbia we have a change which seems more likely to in- 
crease than to remove error and confusion.
The two names of 'stricta' 
and ' platyphylla ' are both adopted ; the former for the Monmouth- 
shire species, and the latter for the ordinary corn-field species.
But 
the corn-field plant having been figured in ' English Botany,' and 
described by Smith, under name of stricta, the application of the 
same name to a different species was far from advisable.
And it is 
contrary to the author's practice in other very similar instances ; for 
he rejected Don's name of Alchemilla argentea, and substituted that 
of Alchemilla conjuncta {Bah.) instead, on the ground that the for- 
mer name had been applied before (although improperly) to A.
al- 
pina {Linn.).
Is it not equally true that the name of " stricta " had 
been before applied to E.
platyphylla ?
Parietaria officinalis {L.) is divided into P.
erecta {Koch) and P.
diffusa {Koch).
In this, and numerous similar cases, it really appears 
the more judicious course to sink an earlier name which includes two 
or more species, and may be applied indifferently to either.
But we 
think it fair and proper to remind the author of the Manual, that he 
is himself here following Koch in a course very similar to that in 
which he refuses to follow Newman ; whose specific names for the 
Lastraeas h'e rejects, although proposed on the only sufficient reason 
which can be assigned by Koch for discarding the name of P.
o ffici- 
nalis ; that is, its applicability alike to several species.
In Potamogeton, contrary to expectation, we find the species 
standing nearly as in the former edition.
P. compi-essus (" L.") is 
recognized for a species apart from P.
pusillus, which is probably a 
correct view.
In the former edition two forms of Zostera marina 
were slightly mentioned ; and a third is now added, the addition of 
which renders their characters less apparently clear on paper.
All 
three are now described for species, as before intimated.
Eleocharis uniglumis {Link) is an added species, stated to have 
been found by Dr. Dickie, in Aberdeenshire ; also in the isle of 
Lewis.
This species so closely resembles the E.
multicaulis {Smith), 
as to suggest the possibility, if not probabihty of their identity.
The 
essential distinction is found in the three stigmas of Smith's species, 
and we have occasionally only been able to detect two in dried spe- 
876 
cimens, in the same spike with other fruits bearing three.
But in 
such cases there is difficulty in feeling certain that one of them had 
not broken close off.
In Carex the changes are proportionally not numerous, though 
confusing enough.
The rather frequent Highland plant, hitherto con- 
sidered an alpine form of C.
curta, is raised to the rank of species 
under the name of C.
Persoonii {Sieb.).
The name of C.
Goodenovii 
(Gay), adopted in the former edition, is dismissed in favour of C.
vul- 
garis {Fries), for the well-known C.
caespitosa of Smith, which is 
now understood not to be the species so called by Linnaeus.
In the 
former edition, this latter name was transferred to C.
stricta {Good.) ; 
and Goodenough's name was suppressed.
In the present edition, 
however, the name of C.
stricta {Good.) is again bestowed upon Good- 
enough's species, and that of C.
caespitosa (L.) is assigned to a third 
species, not satisfactorily ascertained to be a native of Britain.
All 
this is confusing, but the author of the Manual has simply followed 
others, and no blame rests with him.
The various applications of 
the unfortunate name to three species may be thus indicated : â€” 
1. Carex caespitosa, English Flora.
C. caespitosa, British Flora, earlier editions.
C. Goodenowii, British Flora, edition 5.
C. Goodenovii, Manual, edition 1.
C. vulgaris, Manual, edition 2.
2. Carex caespitosa, British Flora, edition 5.
C. caespitosa, Manual, edition 1.
C. stricta, Manual, edition 2.
C. stricta, English Flora j also British Flora, earlier 
editions.
3. Carex caespitosa, Manual, edition 2.
Not included in the English Flora or British Flora.
In Poa, the dubious P.
laxa of Scotland is subdivided into P.
mi- 
nor {Gaud.) and P.
laxa {Hcenke).
The three Parnellian species of 
the genus are still retained ; namely, montana, Balfourii, and poly- 
noda.
That Dr. Parnell must have taken much pains with his work 
on British Grasses, and that his figures are generally very good as 
representations of plants, we are fully prepared to admit ; but we find 
great difficulty in following his minute divisions into species.
If that 
author believes in the soundness of his own species, as may be safely 
877 
supposed that he does, and desires them to be recognized as some- 
thing better than mere names in books, he would materially promote 
this latter object by depositing a good series of specimens in London, 
either in the herbarium of the Botanical Society, or in that of the 
Linnaean Society.
Though a Scottish capital, Edinburgh is only a 
British provincial town, and cannot be the same available centre for 
science as the real metropolis of the kingdom.
It has already been intimated that Newman's three species of Las- 
traea, â€” spinosa, multiflora, recurva, â€” are adopted in the second edi- 
tion of the Manual, although none of these names are used for them.
The choice between these and the other names retained in their 
stead, may perhaps be considered optional.
It is remarkable, how- 
ever, that in adopting Lowe's specific name of Fceuisecii, for L.
recurva, the author of the Manual should so put the matter as to vir- 
tually say that his book is the first instance of the name Lastrgea 
Fceuisecii being applied to the species.
Now, Mr. Newman was the 
first botanist to announce the identity of his L.
recurva and Lowe's 
Nephrodium Fosnisecii (Phytol.
ii.
509).
But in consequence of Mr.
Newman having declined to take up the specific name from Lowe, 
in preference to his adopted name from Bree, Mr. H.
C. Watson sub- 
sequently did so, on the ground that established usage required this 
course (Phytol.
ii.
568).
The word is spelt incorrectly ("foenesecii") 
in Mr. Watson's printed paper; but an error of that kind cannot alter 
the facts of the case.
The author of the Manual had the choice be- 
tween two names, according to ordinary usage and courtesy among 
botanists, that is, between Lastraea recurva {Newm.) and Lastraea foe- 
nisecii {Wats.).
He steers clear of the choice by writing " L.
Foeni- 
secii; frond triangular,^'' &c., which is exactly equivalent to inform- 
ing all readers of the Manual, that the author of that book is the first 
botanist who applies the name " L.
Fceuisecii " to that species !
An 
omission in this case, and an omission above mentioned in the genus 
Erica, may perchance mutually explain each other.
It is with no 
little regret that we feel justified in hinting this solution ; while, of 
course, admitting that its accuracy cannot be proved.
Notwithstanding some petty blemishes in the Manual, it is an ex- 
cellent book on the whole, and we shall rejoice to see other successive 
editions in demand.

Second Notice of a ' Catalogue of Phanogamous Plants and Ferns of 
Great Britain^ 8fc.
Sfc. By Henry Ibbotson.' Part III., 1847.
We noticed this publication at some length in our No. for Decem- 
ber last (Phytol.
ii, 688) ; but we are induced again to call attention 
to it, under the impression that we may have been prematurely ob- 
jecting to its plan in one respect.
Our objection was taken against 
the systematic arrangement of the names instead of an alphabetical 
series, which rendered the Catalogue much less useful as a dictionary of 
synonyms.
This defect might be greatly lessened, however, by an al 
phabetical index to the names and synonyms ; and it seems not im- 
probable that the author may intend to add such an index to the 
work ; for another part (the fourth) will nearly complete the list of 
species, though the work is advertised "to be completed in six Parts." 
The two remaining Parts might, perhaps, be made to include an al- 
phabetical reprint of all the names in the four earlier Parts by print- 
ing in close columns.
For the rest, our former comments upon the Catalogue still hold 
good, without seeming to require any qualification ; and, indeed, we 
are now only making a suggestion as to what should be done, on the 
chance that the author of the Catalogue himself intended to do this.
As in the two former, this third Part has some omissions and some 
inclusions which we should have preferred not to see.
But it is so 
easy to overlook names and references, so difficult to make sure of 
all, that a few omissions may readily be excused ; for example, that 
of Linaria sepium {Allnian).
The inclusions may be matters of fancy 
or taste, in a Catalogue which is not one of British plants simply and 
correctly, but of those reported to be so ; otherwise, the introduction 
of Cuscuta approximata [Bab.) would have appeared most objection- 
able.
The cocoa-nut has been raised in a flower-pot in England, 
fi'ora imported seeds, â€” why not include Cocos nucifera, and thirty 
thousand other things, which have as much real claim to be accounted 
British as the Cuscuta approximata ?

BOTANICAL SOCIETY OF LONDON.
Thursday, June 4th, 1847.
â€” John Reynolds, Esq., Treasurer, in 
the chair.
The Rev. H.
Marsham, of Marsham, Norwich, and Mr. J, W.
Rogers, of Duke Street, Westminster, were elected members.
879 
Donations to the library were announced from the Entomological 
Society of London, the Horticultural Society of Berlin, and Mr. Town- 
ley.
Mr. Hewett Watson exhibited some of the specimens which had 
been received by the Society in the valuable parcels of Azoric plants 
from their active and esteemed fellow-member Thomas Carew Hunt, 
Esq., of St. Michaels, Her Majesty's Consul for the Azores.
Upwards 
of forty species have already been added by Mr. Hunt to the list of 
Azoric plants, enumerated by Mr. Watson in his account of the 
Botany of these isles, published in 1844.
In the last parcel received 
from Mr. Hunt, early this year, there were a few specimens of 
Trichonema Columna, thus adding another point of similarity between 
the flora of these isles and that of the South-western counties of England.
As far as they have been satisfactorily determined, all Mr. Hunt's 
additional species (certainly native in the Azores) are described 
natives of the other Atlantic isles (Madeira and Canary) or of South 
Europe, with one exception, namely, a species of Ammi, which is 
unlike any of those described in the Prodromus of De Candolle, but 
has the peculiar involucre and the fruit of that genus, as it stands in 
the work mentioned.
Mr. Watson was desirous of recording this 
new species by the name of its discoverer, who had kindly sent 
a large supply of duplicates for distribution, imder the impression of 
its being a novelty.
He was more anxious to attach Mr. Hunt's 
name to this plant, because it forms one more in a small group of 
umbelliferous plants which are characteristics in the Azoric Flora, 
and which much resemble one another, although unfortunately 
referrible to three or four different genera, according to the generic 
arrangement of the species of that order at present in use.
One of 
these he had himself described in the ' London Journal of Botany ' 
under name of Petroseliuum trifoliatum.
A second species probably 
belongs to the same genus, and has foliage intermediate between the 
Petroseliuum and the new Ammi ; but as Mr. Watson possesses only 
one immature specimen, he is unable to determine its generic 
character.
A third species is the No. 100 of Mr. W.'s own collection 
and printed list of Azoric plants, which also remains undetermined, 
though apparently neither an Ammi nor a Petroselinum.
A fourth 
species is the new one from Mr. Hunt, and which Mr. Watson 
proposes to distinguish from Ammi majus, by the following character 
and short description : â€”

Mr. Jasper W.
Rogers communicated a paper " On the Potato 
disease," which led to a long discussion, in which the Chairman, 
Dr. Ayres, Dr. Cooke, Mr. Taylor, Dr. Bossey, and other members 
joined.â€” G.
E. D.
A numerously attended meeting of the Botanical Society of Lon- 
don took place on Friday evening, at the Society's Rooms, 20, Bed- 
ford-street, Covent-garden, for the purpose of further considering the 
disease affecting the potato â€” a disease which has unfortunately 
brought so much calamity on the people â€” and of hearing a paper 
read on the nutritious properties of that article of food, by Jasper W.
Rogers, Esq., C.E., a gentleman who has bestowed much considera- 
tion on the subject.
John Reynolds, Esq., Treasurer of the Society, 
in the chair.
The Chairman, in opening the business, referred to the importance 
of the subject, and said that the meeting would feel most happy to 
hear the results of Mr. Rogers' investigations.
Mr. Rogers then read his paper, which abounded in statistical de- 
tails.
The paper opened with a reference to doubts which appeared 
to exist upon the minds of some members of the Society as to the 
quantum of food and nutriment stated by him in his essays to exist 
in the potato, when properly cultivated and converted into meal and 
flour; and proceeded.
to remark, that to remove those doubts the 
writer had investigated various authorities, from whose writings he 
collected the results which he now begged to submit to the attention 
of the meeting.
The meeting would observe that he had carefully 
abstained from giving his own experiments as to the nutritive matter 
to be found in the potato when in its proper state of health, although 
they in some instances even more than bore out the statement he had 
made.
He still adhered to this course, in order that conclusions 
881 
might be arrived at upon the investigations made by high established 
authorities.
It had been stated in his essays that one acre of ground 
cultivated with wheat would produce an average of 1,055 lbs.
of dry 
matter, while a similar extent with potatoes would produce 4,076 lbs., 
the quantity of nutritious material being â€”

These results had been taken from data given by Sir Robert Kane, 
in his ' Industrial Resources of Ireland,' page 300, in which it is 
stated, " The following table, collected from the best authorities, ex- 
hibits the quantity of actual nutritious material usually derived from 
an acre of ground : â€”

Mr. Rogers begged it might be borne in mind that the authorities 
alluded to made their experiments before the appearance of the pota- 
to-disease, and observed that, in addition, it would be found in Wake- 
field's publications-^and his experience was most considerable as an 
English agriculturist â€” per statute acre in Ireland was, in 1812, 
wheat, average, 1,300 lbs.
; maximum, 4,200 lbs.
Potatoes, average, 
13,669 lbs.
; maximum, 72,100 lbs.
Divide the quantity of potatoes 
by four, and it would give the actual dry material ; the nutritious 
matter, therefore, was â€” the average, 3,417 lbs.; the maximum, 
18,025 lbs.
; while of wheat (bran and pollards included) the average 
was but 1,300 lbs.; the maximum, 4,200 lbs.
Consequently, the 
maximum quantity of nutritious material of potato is, according to 
Wakefield, about 4^ times as much as the maximum weight of wheat 
unground.
Professor Solly gives â€” wheat, the average, 1,680 lbs.
; po- 
tatoes, 17,920 lbs.
; Professor Lowe gives â€” wheat, the average, 1,380 
lbs.
; potatoes, the average, 17,920 lbs.
Professor Johnstone â€” wheat, 
the average, 1,440 lbs.; the maximum, 4,200 lbs.; potatoes, the ave- 
882 
rage, 13,440 lbs.
; the maximum, 67,200 lbs.
The two latter publi- 
cations were of 1843, Wakefield's being 1812, still the test of dividing 
the produce from potatoes by four would produce about the same re- 
sults as the table he had given from Sir Robert Kane's computation.
Now, as regarded the amount of absolute nutrition, that table states 
it exhibits " from the best authorities the quantity of actual nutritious 
material usually derived from an acre of ground." It might be pre- 
sumed the table itself was sufficient authority; but all doubt would 
be removed by the following : â€” M.
de Lomes, author of the ' Statis- 
tics of Great Britain and Ireland,' states " In Ireland the potato gives 
an annual produce of 42 to 52,000 lbs.
per hectare.
On dividing 
that number by four, to reduce it to the standard nourishment which 
wheat affords, the hectare thus cultivated, gives 10 to 13,000 lbs.
weight of subsistence ;" and he adds, " Newnham considers three 
pounds of potatoes equivalent to one pound of wheat." Kortes states 
the main result of the examinations of fifty-five varieties of potato, 
gave him, for solid matter, 24'9 ; for starch, 11'85 per cent.
; conse- 
quently the residue was almost 14 per cent.
And Professor Solly, in 
his ' Tables of the average weight per acre of thirteen crops of corn 
or vegetables, and also of their organic or inorganic constituents,' 
gives â€” 
Unazotized 
Protein 
Crop.
Per Acre.
Organic Matter.
Compounds.
Wheat....
....
1,680 
1,184-4 
218-4 
Potatoes 
....
17,920 
3,053-6 
4337 
And, although Solly only allows eight tons of potatoes per acre, in 
place of what may be produced, thirty tons, and gives a much higher 
average of wheat than other authors, we find the gross quantity of 
protein compound from an acre of ground, to be from potatoes almost 
exactly double the quantity from wheat, and the per centage to be 
14-16, almost similar with Sir Robert Kane's table ; besides which, 
Solly gives six per cent, of inorganic matter.
Therefore there can be 
no question of the quantum of nutriment (assumed to be for the pro- 
duction of bone and muscle) in the potato when in its healthy state ; 
but let them now look at the last analysis made, when of course the 
tuber was diseased, as, under existing circumstances, it could hardly 
fail to be otherwise.
Professor Johnson says, in an article recently 
published, with an accurate analysis of the potato, " The quantity of 
dry solid matter depends upon ripeness â€” the ripest leave 30 to 32 per 
883 
cent, dry matter, the least ripe 24; starch varies from 14'08 to 20*71 
per cent.
; fat 24 to 1 ; protein compound, in wet state, maximum, 
3'75 per cent.
Thus giving 15 per cent, protein compound in the 
dry material.
He adds, " In potatoes attacked with the prevailing 
disease, the proportion of protein compounds diminishes ; they are 
partially decomposed, producing ammonia and other compounds." 
Also, " The proportion of protein compounds, chiefly coagulated 
albumen, in the potato fibre, is greater, one would suppose â€” the main 
being found by Fromberg to be 3j to 4 per cent.
The fibre of the 
potato, as he had already said, retained a protein of starch and other 
nutritive matter, and, therefore, the real quantity of indigestible fibrous 
or woody matter, is by no means so great as the per centage of fibre 
appears to represent." Thus it was clear that the quantity of protein 
compounds in the potato was much above what had been generally 
supposed ; and it was to be recollected that the whole dry matter of 
the potato was capable of being converted into a food for man, was 
more fitted for storage than the great portion of the dry matter of 
wheat â€” bran â€” was lost ; and the principal proportion of the flour of 
wheat now used does not contain more than about 10 to 11 per cent, 
of the protein compounds, while the best flour would not average 
9 per cent.
He (Mr. Rogers) would therefore strongly urge on the 
Botanical Society of London the absolute duty, incumbent upon all at 
the present juncture, particularly those to whom the public look for 
instruction and guidance, to thoroughly investigate the question, and 
pronounce a public opinion upon it.
For the last few years it had 
been the fashion to cry down the potato, and absolutely recommend 
its abolishment; but the fallacy had been sadly proved, and they 
should now seek to ascertain its real value.
To his theory of the 
cause of the disease of the potato, viz., "Constitutional weakness, 
caused by unnatural growth in the pit, and that weakened and 
degenerated parentage must produce diseased offspring," he would 
request attention and investigation ; also to the remedy, namely, 
" To sow when nature sows in autumn, and to re-invigorate 
the weakened seed, by giving freely to the soil, carbon ; and let it thus 
draw back, at once, means to reproduce the life-blood it had lost." 
Mr. Rogers's paper was throughout listened to with attention.
A long and animated discussion followed, in which Dr. Ayres, 
Dr. Bossey, Dr. Cooke, and other members, joined.
Various 
donations were announced, and members elected ; and thanks having 
884 
been voted to Mr. Rogers for his paper, and to the Chakman, the 
business terminated.

Occurrence of Rare Plants near Jedburgh.
By Archibald Jerdon, Esq.
I have lately found two or three rather rare plants, a short notice 
of which may not be unacceptable to the readers of the ' Phytologist.' 
About the middle of April I discovered two patches of the yellow 
star of Bethlehem [Onithogaliim luteum) by the side of the Jed, near 
the old castle of Ferniherst, about two miles from Jedburgh.
It was 
growing around the roots of trees, and consequently in a shady situa- 
tion.
The soil is somewhat sandy.

In the beginning of this month (May) I met with a patch of La- 
thraea squamaria, growing in sandy soil, at the root of an elm, by the 
banks of the Jed, about a mile above Femiherst.
This is the only 
time I ever saw this curious plant, which is very uncommon here.
The bitter cardamine [Cardamine amara) grows in some abun- 
dance in marshy spots, and on the banlis of the Jed, near Femiherst 
castle.

On the Occurrence of Carex elongata in Essex.
By Tpiomas Bentall, Esq.
I AM not aware that Carex elongata has been hitherto recorded as 
an Essex plant.
It therefore gives me pleasure to state that it was 
found some time since in one of the Mark's Hall woods, near Cogges- 
hall, by my friend Mr. Varenne, of Kelvedon.
In a recent excursion 
to these woods, made by Mr. V.
and myself, we were fourtunate 
enough to discover two new stations for it, in one of which, a small 
bog, it occurs in some abundance, growing vigorously amidst a pro- 
fusion of Menyanthes trifoliata and Eriophorum polystachion.
A 
short distance from the last-mentioned spot we also gathered Loni- 
cera caprifolium, which we were pleased to find in so interesting a 
locality.

Occurrence of Cynosurus echinatus and Alopecurus arvensis near 
Manchester.
By Leo. H.
Grindon, Esq.
Cynosurus echinatus is now growing in abundance in a field of 
Lolium perenne, at Hough End, two miles south of this town.
The

Alopecurus 
arvensis, a rare plant in this neighbourhood, is equally abundant.

Note on raising Primulas from Seed.
By Joseph Sidebotham, Esq.
I WAS glad to see in the last month's ' Phy tologist ' an account 
of Mr. Watson's further experiments on the specific identity of the 
primrose and cowslip, as I think the records of such experiments 
tend more to the true knowledge of the relation of plants to each 
other than whole volumes of speculative discussion.
For my own 
part, I do not relish the idea of the cowslip and primrose being con- 
sidered forms of the same species, it appears to strike at the very 
root of our notions of specific identity, and to give a good handle to 
the supporters of the progressive-development theory ; but if the idea 
turns out to be a correct one, it would be absurd to attempt to prove 
it an impossibility.
With regard to the first of Mr. Watson's experi- 
ments, I consider it only to prove that the seed of a hybrid is fertile, 
and think that the differences in the seedlings are accounted for by 
my late friend E.
S. Wilson (Phytol.
ii.
378).
The second experi- 
ment certainly shows that seeds of the cowslip produced varieties ap- 
proaching the primrose, but still that is not satisfactory.
Perhaps 
Mr. W.
will favour us with particulars of the remaining seedlings 
when they flower.
For several seasons I have tried experiments, but from some cause 
or other the results were not very satisfactory.
In 1845 the seeds 
of Primulae ripened very imperfectly, and I was unable to collect suf- 
ficient from the plants which were marked.
Last year I secured 
seeds of the cowslip and primrose : the young plants of the former 
were almost all killed during the winter, and the few of the latter 
which have flowered produced common primroses.
I also sowed 
some seeds of the Bardfield oxlip, which produced their like.
This season appears peculiarly favourable to the ripening of seeds : 
I have fine plants of the cowslip and var.
intermedia, transplanted 
from the fields last summer, from which I hope to procure a plentiful 
supply.
I wish all your readers who feel interested in the inquiry would try 
the experiment, that next year we may be able to have this knotty 
question, which has been so long contested, finally settled.
Joseph Sidebotham.

duced in the second and third generation from Primula Jacquinii

We again express a hope that the 
names of elatior and occlip will not be applied to this species.

Remarks on Cnicus Forsteri (Smith).
By David Moore, Esq.
In the ' Phytologist' for this month, your correspondent " C." in his 
notice of the second edition of Babington's 'Manual of British Botany,' 
stai'ts a query of some importance in reference to Cnicus Forsteri, 
namely, supposing that plant a hybrid, which two of our British 
species are we to suppose the parents ?
A similar idea occurred to me 
some years ago, when I collected C.
Forsteri in the north of Ireland, 
in two separate localities, and in both instances growing in company 
with quantities of Cnicus pratensis and Cnicus palustris.
I then adopted Mr. Borrer's original view in considering it a hybrid 
production between those two species, which it appears exactly 
intermediate with, but now, after having a considerable degree of 
experience with the plant in a cultivated state, I feel more doubtful on 
this subject, for the following reasons.
The plants, which were 
brought from the natural habitats, produced some fertile seeds in the 
Botanic Garden, the following year after they were planted, from 
which young plants were raHsed, precisely resembling the parent in 
every tcay, and the experiment has been several times repeated with 
the same result.
I brought C.
Forsteri hither from a marshy meadow 
889 
near Colerainc, in June, 1839, and it has been continued under 
euUivation ever since, by raising two or three sets from seeds.
These 
plants appear to decline during the third year, when they would 
probably die out if not renewed from seeds, though this may depend 
considerably on the rather dry situation where they are planted in the 
garden.
A very large portion of the fliOrets constantly prove barren, but 
fertile seeds occur sparingly, and are to be found when carefully 
looked for.
These facts, although calculated to strengthen the idea 
of C.
Forsteri being an original species, are not by any means in 
themselves sufficient to prove it so, because, every observing cultiva- 
tor must be aware, that hybrids produced between plants which are 
supposed to be specifically distinct, do occasionally produce fertile 
seeds.
A stronger argument against C.
pratensis being one of the 
parents, would probably be, that C.
Forsteri does not partake in any 
degree of the extensively creeping root of the former species.

Tlie Cholera versus the VastatoTi or an Entomologist in the Potato-field.
" TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES.
" Sir, â€” As your journal has contained a number of articles upon the 
potato disease, in which it has been attributed to the attacks of Aphides, 
I beg to request the insertion in your paper of the following obsen^ations 
relative to its re-appearance, at a moment when the generally healthy 
appearance of the crops and the singular absence of Aphides might 
induce a false security and lead to irremediable evils ; and which are 
an abstract of a paper read by me at the Linnean Society, on Tuesday, 
the 15th inst.
; my object being to disprove the assertion which has 
been circulated by Mr. Alfred Smee, with so much activity, that the 
disease has been entirely produced by the attacks of a species of 
Aphis.
" The arguments I adduce in opposition to this theory are â€” 
"1.
That the Aphis which has been found upon the potato, and 
thence considered as the cause of the disease, is neither a newly 
created nor a newly imported species, but was well known long before 
the disease in question appeared.
" 2.
That the disease itself has not been known until the last iew 
years.
890 
" 3.
Tliat the disease may occur independent of Aphides.
" 4.
That Aphides may abound on a plant without producing the 
real disease.
" 5, Hiat the results produced by the attacks of Aphides upon a 
plant are of a widely different character from those exhibited by the 
plants attacked by this disease.
" 6.
That the disease in question may appear in the offspring of a 
sound parent tuber ; and 
" 7.
That the disease appears in many respects to be analogous to 
the cholera, and may thence, for the sake of distinction, be termed the 
potato cholera.
" The facts already before the public fully confirm these arguments, 
which are corroborated by other circumstances which I have noticed 
within the last few days in my own kitchen-garden in Hammersmith, 
and which are briefly as follows : â€” 
" On the 4th inst., a few plants were observed sickly in appearance, 
with the leaves drooping and yellow in colour ; the remainder of the 
crop having a remarkably healthy appearance and being singularly 
free from insects of all kinds.
" On taking up these drooping specimens, the haulm or stem for 
about two inches below the surface of the ground was found to be 
dried and shriveled up in appearance, and of a dirty brown colour ; 
whilst the tuber from which it had sprung, and which had been set 
entire last autumn, was still found perfectly sound, thus proving the 
absence of disease inherited from the parent plant.
With the exception 
of these few plants the entire crop retained its healthy appearance 
until Sunday afternoon, the 13th instant, when a great number of the 
plants in two of the beds were observed flagging, just as though they 
had been trampled over by dogs, which has since been followed by 
the same appearance in other parts of the garden.
It is proper here 
to state that no attempts had been previously made to rid the plants 
of insects, nor had the ground received other than the ordinary 
treatment ; the last year's crop in my garden having been singularly 
free from disease.
On examining some of these plants on the 
following morning, the haulm below the surface of the ground was 
found to present the same dried, withered, and discoloured appearance 
as in the specimens examined ten days previously ; the fibres of the 
roots being likewise dry and incapable of performing their proper 
functions, and which would produce discoloured blotches on the 
leaves in a subsequent stage of the disease.
The plants at the same 
lime were free from insects, and the ]3arent tuber remained in several 
891 
of them, to all appearance, as sound as when first planted.
A number 
of the plants thus attacked were exhibited to the meeting.
" This sudden drooping of so many of the plants, which up to that 
time had appeared so healthy, led to the examination of some of those 
which still remained erect, when it was found that even some of these 
presented precisely the same appearance as those which had dropped, 
and which would doubtless in a few days have shared the same fate 
as the others.
Nothing, therefore, can be more fallacious than to' 
depend upon the present general healthy appearence of the crop 
throughout the country or its freedom from Aphides.
The theory of 
Mr. Alfred Smee is, as that gentleman is well aware, rejected by every 
zoologist and botanist of distinction in London, and its reiteration at 
the present critical moment is a gross attempt to mislead the public, 
and may be productive of the greatest evil by inducing security 
(owing to the absence of Aphides), until too late in the season to 
remedy the evil.
â€” I am, sir, your very obedient servant, 
"John O.
Westwood, 
" Secretary of the Entomological Society.
" St. Peter's, Hammersmith, June 16.'' 
[Although there is nothing new in this letter except the absurd 
attempt to quash enquiry by comparing the disease to cholera, and 
thereby leading readers to suppose that it is not to be arrested ; yet it 
does contain the united verdict of all zoologists that the Aphis has 
nothing whatever to do with the disease : it is quite certain that 
a potato plant on which an Aphis or a lady-bird or any other insect 
happen to be crawling may die of this disease, but no tittle of 
evidence is adduced to show that the Aphis or lady-bird caused the 
death : the house in which Mr. Smee is residing may fall, but he were 
a bold man that should assert that Mr. Smee's presence caused that 
fall : no one should write on this subject who has not the intellectual 
power of correctly estimating facts : nor should any one publish 
without a previous knowledge of the habit of potatoes generally, and 
of the difference of varieties.
Mr. Westwood's potatoes with drooping 
and yellow leaves were individuals of an early variety accidentally 
mixed with the rest in setting them, since the appearance he describes 
indicates nothing more than an advance towards maturity.
The 
drying, shriveling, and turning brown of the stem below ground, 
point plainly to such a conclusion : where are the blotched and 
fungus-infested plague-spots of the leaf ^ where is the rot in the stem ?
where the rot and discoloration of the tuber .?
We wish people would

On the Melanism or Abnormal Colouring of Ferns.
By Edward Newman.
1 HAVE not seen, as far as I recollect, any comments on the striking 
and often beautiful colouring to which the fronds of ferns are liable.
In some instances the veins assume a tint approaching jet black ; in 
others they are of the most exquisite purple, the leafy portion of the 
frond remaining of a vivid green : to this description of melanism our 
British Lastraea recurva and the exotic Cyatheaj are peculiarly liable.
A second phase of the property exhibits the leafy portions of a dull 
purple, the veins retaining the normal green hue : our British 
Cystopteris fragilis affords frequent examples of this.
In a third 
phase the leafy portions assume a resplendent purple, or glittering 
bronzed appearance, the veins partially partaking of the same 
character : beautiful examples of this are exhibited by our common 
Polystichum aculeatum.
It has frequently struck me that the truthful discrimination of 
species might be occasionally retarded by the presence of this 
character in a hastily gathered frond of an exotic species, so completely 
does it alter the appearance of the fern : and I therefore thought I 
might be adding my mite to the general stock of knowledge if I could 
show how so marked a deviation from normal character is occasioned.
With this view I this year watched my ferns very narrowly, and during 
the usual period of their expanding not an instance of melanism 
occurred : I however happened to procure some roots of Cystopteris, 
the fronds of which had been so injured in transit that I thought it 
best to cut them off, and to plant the roots without fronds : I watered 
the spot night and morning, and the plants being full of vigour, new 
fronds were unrolled and rapidly assumed a normal size and appear- 
ance : I should say that the spot on which they grew enjoyed one hour 
of the midday sun.
One morning, circumstances occurred to delay 
the morning watering until near noon ; it was a brilliant day ; the air 
still, and the sky cloudless ; after the lapse of a few minutes the sun 
was shining on the young fronds of Cystopteris still dripping with 
moisture : the evavoration was most rapid, and the vapour might be 
seen curling up over the bricks among which the roots had been 
planted.
On the following morning the young fronds of Cystopteris, 
together with those of a Polystichum which had partaken of the sun 
and water, had become purple, they looked as though died in log- 
wood.
Thus the melanism was produced by natural agents although 
one of them artificially applied.
In ten days both the ferns had 
893 
developed other fronds; the weather was cold and cloudy, and I also 
manufactured an artificial shade, so that they had no sun at all: in 
both species these fronds have retained a vivid green colour, and thus 
the same plants of different genera ai"e novy bearing fronds of the most 
opposite colours.
A series of experiments has convinced me that 
this result is not accidental but always attainable under proper 
management.

Suggestions for recording the Localities and Distribution of British 
Plants.
By Hewett C.
Watson, Esq.
In the ' Phytologist ' for May (Phytol.
ii.
824), Mr. Newman has 
called attention to the services which might be rendered to science, 
"by inserting in the pages of the ' Phytologist' a record of careful 
observations on the range of British species, and more particularly of 
those which Mr. Watson has included in his first volume," that is, of 
the 'Cybele Britannica.' I beg here to offer some further suggestions 
on the manner of carrying forward this recommendation into a practi- 
cal result ; and to explain how much many of the past and present 
very inadequate attempts might now be improved upon.
The great impediment in the path of improvement is obvious 
enough.
It is to be found in the undeniable fact, that most botanists 
are in such haste to publish their own individual observations, in form 
of local lists and localities, that they will not wait until they have 
first ascertained the doings of others in the same line.
They appear 
tacitly to assume that the facts which are new to themselves must be 
novelties also to the records of science, and worthy of public an- 
nouncement.
The consequence of this tacit assumption, without tak- 
ing the trouble to inquire into its soundness, is seen in numerous 
records and announcements of little or no value, which have occupied 
the pages of periodicals more or less during the past twenty years.
The same localities, for the same species, have been announced and 
recorded over and over again; local lists, professedly of "rare plants," 
have abounded with the names of generally-distributed species, while 
those of much more limited species have been omitted therefrom ; 
important deficiencies in our information on the ranges and limits of 
species have not been filled up b}' those botanists who had the oppor- 
tunity and the willingness to do this, lacking only the requisite 
Vol. II.
5 t 
894 
knowledge that such deficiencies existed ; and, in short, the pub- 
lished local lists and localities have usually been drawn up at random, 
with reference to no higher or more general object than the aunounce- 
mentof so many isolated facts, valuable or valueless, as chance might 
turn out.
And yet all this time, there were probably few of those botanists 
who did not enjoy some opportunities for observing and recording 
facts which would have proved really and importantly conducive to 
the progress of science, if they would have only taken the jjains to 
make those preliminary inquiries which qualify scientific observers to 
discriminate between the important and the unimportant, the useful 
and the useless, in science.
It must be allowed, however, that some 
of the necessary data for this sort of preparatory or preliminary know- 
ledge have hitherto been so scattered aud imperfect, that much time 
and patience might be requisite in order to acquire it.
But in other 
instances no such difficulty stood in the way ; the data having been 
readily accessible and sufficient â€” but neglected.
The Botanist's Guides will illustrate this.
The original Guide, by 
Turner and Dillwyn, has been forty years before the public ; and it 
is now a dozen years since the ' New G uide ' was published.
Never- 
theless, we still find botanists recording over again, as if novelties, 
the very same localities which were entered in the older Guide, on 
competent authority, and again confirmed in the ' New Guide,' on the 
additional evidence of other observers.
It would be too much to ex- 
pect that every botanist, fancying himself the discoverer of a locality 
new and worth recording, should make certain that the same locality 
is not anywhere in print, before he sends his own announcement 
thereof to a periodical.
But it might very reasonably be expected 
from those who are pretending thus to instruct others, that they 
should at least take the trouble of consulting such general works as 
are most likely to show whether the fact has been already recorded on 
sufficient authority.
A refusal or neglect to do this approximatees 
so closely upon injustice to their predecessors, that the separation is 
imperceptible, if existent at all.
The meanest botanist would see the inutility of now sending a let- 
ter to the ' Phytologist,' in order to announce the discovery of Erica 
ciliaris in Cornwall.
Why so ?
Simply because that fact is already 
sufficiently established and recorded.
And yet we constantly see 
announcements that a certain species occurs in a certain county, or 
parish, or other more local habitat, although the same fact has been 
previously recorded on superior authority.
I do not hesitate to write 
895 
*' superior authority ;" because it is usually the smatterers in botany 
who indulge in recording the old localities over again ; some of them, 
it may be, in innocent ignorance that such books as Botanist's Guides 
have ever been published.
Much has been done during the past ten years in the way of ascer- 
taining and recording localities ; and the Botanist's Guides have 
doubtless fallen in arrear as general compilations.
But still, as far as 
they do go, they would save us from a vast deal of useless reiteration 
of well-established facts, if they were more usually consulted by our 
hasty recorders of localities.
So, again, with the London Catalogue 
of British Plants; which has placed within the reach of every bota- 
nist such a test of the comparative frequency of our native species as 
may enable them to discriminate between the rare and the common 
plants, with at least sufficient certainty for avoiding unnecessary re- 
cords of localities for species of general occurrence.
A difficulty yet remains.
While the use of a Botanist's Guide and 
a London Catalogue might often save us from the infliction of " old 
over again," or of unimportant facts not worth recording, they may 
still not show, with sufficient clearness for beginners, what facts bear 
an opposite character â€” what may be best worth recording on the 
ground of their novelty, of their tendency to correct errors, or of 
aught else which may give some scientific value to them.
It is prin- 
cipally with a view of offering some suggestions on this head, that I 
have now taken pen in hand.
, To point out the right track, and the 
path of real usefulness, may prove a more successful effort towards 
leading others from the wrong way than any attempt to impede their 
course along the latter.
In doing so, I must take it for granted that 
botanists who seek to record their own observations in Nature, are 
influenced chiefly by two motives ; first, a desire of contributing 
something to the accumulated stores of scientific knowledge ; se- 
condly, such a feeling of personal satisfaction as any one may very 
justifiably entertain under the consciousness of having thus usefully 
employed himself.
But the egotistic individual, who only obtrudes 
on the public with his repetitions of things trite and trifling, neither 
adds to our stores of knowledge nor employs himself usefully.
I ad- 
dress myself to the former, not to the latter class of botanists ; and I 
am satisfied that there are many of the former among the contributors 
to the * Phytologist.' 
A new edition of the 'Manual of British Botany' has very recently 
been published.
It is likely that a new edition of the ' London Cata- 
logue of British Plants' will be required before next year.
Mr.
896 
Ibbotson's Catalogue is far advanced towards completion.
We thus 
have, or shortly may have, three very fidl lists of British plants ; each 
bearing some feature which is not found in the other two.
And it 
seems almost needless to say that the discovery of any species at all 
wild in the British Isles, which is not enumerated in the above lists, 
would be a fact highly worthy of public announcement and record.
Many species are mentioned in the Manual, as likely to be found in 
Britain, and some of which are conjectured to have been seen, al- 
though not certainly ascertained.
Attention is thus directed towards 
points which it is desirable to investigate and ascertain.
And, by 
giving a census of the species, the 'London Catalogue,' in its turn, is 
drawing attention to those species, the scarcity of which renders the 
discovery and record of all their localities so much the more desirable.
These are finger-posts to guide the botanical traveller.
In recording localities, as above intimated, there is always a 
chance, usually a probability, that we are only again putting on re- 
cord the selfsame facts which had been before ascertained and re- 
corded.
To keep clear from this impertinent egotism in science, it 
would be well to take the trouble of first inquiring whether the same 
facts have, or have not, been already placed on record by others.
The Botanist's Guides offer a ready resource here, and afford a pass- 
ably safe test.
In many instances, a still better may be found in 
some local Flora for the county or tract within which the supposed 
new localities are situate.
If not found on record either in the ap- 
propriate Flora or in the Guides, the publication of such localities 
would be quite excusable, even though it might prove to be only a 
re-publication, though an earlier record in some less likely work.
The use of local Floras may sometimes lead to the preservation 
of facts doubly useful and worthy of record, and which might be neg- 
lected and lost by those who failed to examine such works.
Includ- 
ing some catalogues in the periodicals, together with those pubhshed 
separately as local Floras, there are now about forty printed lists of 
plants which profess to include all the known species of the several 
counties or other tracts to which they refer respectively.
In these 
lists, consequently, we have the negative as well as positive evidence 
to work upon ; for any species which is not enumerated in the appro- 
priate Flora, is reasonably enough presumed to be absent from the 
corresponding tract of country.
In divers instances, however, these 
lists have been hastily published, that is, before their authors had 
fully examined the tracts to which they relate ; and they may thus 
mislead by "the imperfect state of their negative evidence.
Any 
807 
omitted species which may be subsequently discovered within the 
same tract, thus becomes doubly worthy of being recorded; its dis- 
covery not only adding a positive fact to the sum of recorded know- 
ledge, but also correcting the negative error implied in the omission 
of that species.
In the Botanist's Guides the lists do not profess to be complete ; 
being simply compilations of such localities for the rarer species as 
had been ascertained at the dates of publication.
It does not appear 
that in the first Guide any fixed list or choice of species was uni- 
formly adopted ; a species which was included in one county list 
being exckided from another.
The negative evidence is thus vitiated, 
and even rendered nugatory for several of the less rare species.
In 
the ' New Guide,' on the contrary, a fixed list of species was adopted 
uniformly for every county, the localities of the same plants in each 
successive county being entered as far as known.
The omission of 
any of the species from any county list was thus equivalent to an in- 
timation of no locality for that species, in that county, having been 
found on record or otherwise ascertained.
To a considerable extent, 
therefore, the county lists of the ' New Guide ' may be held to point 
out what was unknown as well as what was known, at the date of 
publication.
Here, again, the discovery of any omitted species may 
be said to have a two-fold value and claim for public announcement ; 
first, by adding another locality for that species ; secondly, by adding 
another species to that county list.
It would be easy to show that 
numerous localities published in the ' Phytologist ' do truly come un- 
der this head of double value, although intermingled with others of 
no value.
In ' Remarks on the Geographical Distribution of British Plants,' 
the ranges of latitude and elevation were given, as well as various 
other items of information connected with the distribution and locali- 
ties of all the known British species.
Any locality discovered higher 
or lower, more north or more south, than the limits there assigned to 
the species, might thus at once be pronounced a positive addition to 
the sum of our ascertained knowledge ; and, as such, might fairly be 
deemed worthy of record.
I shall, however, not dwell on the 'Re- 
marks ' here, but pass to the ' Cybele Britannica,' â€” the work which 
has led to my offering the present suggestions, through Mr. Newman's 
(I may be allowed to say, judicious) note on the same subject.
I 
wish to show from that work what ample opportunities still remain 
within the reach of our botanical explorers, for bringing fresh sup- 
plies of useful facts to the already accumulated stores, and without 
898 
incurring the discredit of announcing over again those facts which 
are ah*eady well known.
As explained in the ' Phytologist ' for April (Phytol.
ii.
784), the 
counties of Britain are grouped into eighteen provinces, in the Cybele.
The occurrence or non-occurrence of each species, in each of these 
eighteen provinces, is shown ; and if reported to grow there, its con- 
dition also, whether indigenous or introduced, or doubtful from some 
source of error or uncertainty.
At present only the first volume of 
the Cybele is published, which includes nearly six hundred species, 
reckoning varieties treated as such, doubti'uls and aliens, along with 
the rest.
Six hundred multiplied by eighteen gives a total of 10,800 
facts, positive and negative.
More than the half of these facts are 
positive ; and as the condition under which the positive fact (to wit, 
the alleged occurrence of the species in the province) is viewed, is 
likewise to be added, we shall be below truth in saying 15,000 facts, 
under this head of provincial distribution alone.
I use the term 
" facts " because they are set forth as such.
But owing to imperfect 
records, errors, and various other circumstances, there is reason to 
suppose that many of these reputed facts do truly require to be diffe- 
rently stated.
For instance, various species may hereafter be found 
to grow in provinces which are at present set down as blanks for 
them.
Others may be found really wild in provinces where they are 
now entered as introduced or naturalized, and vice versa.
Others 
may be ascertained to grow in provinces where as yet they are entered 
under suspicion of error.
Any discovery of a locality or species 
which will correct any one of the reputed 15,000 facts, must be de- 
serving of announcement and record.
Any such discovery which 
may simply add to the evidence either way, in cases of Tincertainty, 
although without being conclusive in itself, will most likely be also 
worth recording.
By the time the Cybele is completed these 15,000 
reputed facts will have accumulated into 50,000 ; and little indeed 
must be his knowledge of British botany (whatever he may know of 
British plants) who shall find himself unable to make a single correc- 
tion, or to give some useful item of information towards correcting 
some of these 50,000 reputed facts.
In this light, it is to be remem- 
bered, that localities for quite common species may be equally useful 
as those for the rarest.
In the same work, the most northern and the most southern coun- 
ties, in which each native and perfectly naturalized species has been 
ascertained, are also mentioned.
In the one published volume these 
species (with varieties treated as species) amount to about five hun- 
899 
dred.
And as, one with another, about five counties are named for 
the north and south limits of each, we have 2,500 additional facts ; 
which, again, will rise to 8,000 by the completion of the work.
These are given according to present knowledge ; but there is a pro- 
bability, equal to a moral certainty, that several of the species will be 
discovered in counties more northerly or more southerly than those 
now set forth as their ascertained limits ; and where this may be the 
case the discovery will be worth recording.
It will be a fresh fact 
added to our stores of knowledge ; and one of considerably higher 
value than the discovery of any additional locality within the known 
limits of the species.
Again, in the same work, the north and south limits are also indi- 
cated by lines of latitude.
Here, then, we have another thousand 
facts, that is, a thousand lines on the map, beyond which the species 
are stated respectively not to be known in a truly wild state.
On 
completion of the work these will have become 3,000 reputed facts.
In this case, the likelihood of corrections becoming necessary is much 
less than with the county limits.
Still, it is far from improbable that 
some of the species may hereafter be found beyond the lines indicated 
for their latitudinal limits in Britain.
Any observed fact in proof of 
this extension must be worthy of record : it is another item to the 
sum total of knowledge, and one which immediately admits of useful 
application.
The upper and lower limits of the several species are also stated, 
so far as ascertained, both in absolute altitude and in accordance 
with certain zones of climate and elevation (Phytol.
ii.
785, 794).
To perfect this part of the work a vast number of additional observa- 
tions will be required.
Many of the species may yet be found higher 
or lower than the altitudes assigned for them.
And the heights to 
which they ascend or descend on the different mountain ranges 
should also be ascertained and compared in order to afford the ne- 
cessary data for determining the influence of latitude, and numerous 
more local conditions, in elevating or depressing the limits of the 
species.
As the matter now stands, the first volume of the Cybele 
may be said to give 2,000 facts under the head of altitude ; and these 
will become 6,000 in the entire work.
Besides the preceding points, there are the types of distribution ; 
the ranges of mean annual temperature ; occasional enumeration of 
counties or localities for the rarer species ; their usual situations of 
growth ; their claims to be ranked as natives or otherwise ; their es- 
timated census, with various queries and suggestions; including toge- 
900 
ther many thousands of other apparent facts, more or less definitely 
and positively set forth in the Cybele.
Many of these also will 
doubtless need to be confirmed, modified, or corrected, by advancing 
knowledge, derived from fresh observations, â€” from fresh facts which 
have yet to be ascertained and recorded.
It is hardly necessary to say more upon this (with myself) rather 
egotistical subject.
Enough has been said for my ijiimediate purpose 
of showing, that those botanists who may be disposed to observe and 
record facts bearing upon local and geographical botany, may find 
ample scope and opportunity for making them real and useful con- 
irihutions to the stores of scientijic knowledge.
But they will not 
succeed unless they can go to work with some reference to that which 
has been done by others.
They must take the trouble, and it would 
surely not be a great trouble, to ascertain from the general works and 
compilations, first, what is known, and secondly, what is not known.
He who will not take this trouble, but will prefer to publish his lists 
or localities at random and in ignorance, may chance to put on record 
important facts, without knowing them to be such ; but there is a 
greater probability of his putting forth much more that is only old 
and worthless.
The suggestions of Mr. Newman referred to local and geographical 
botany ; and to that I have accordingly directed also my own.
But 
this is only one field.
Mr. Babington or Mr. Borrer might as readily 
show that many facts have yet to be ascertained, many questions to 
be answered, many doubts to be removed, in the department of de- 
scriptive botany, even in that of Britain.
Mr. Wilson or Mr. Henfrey 
might point out how numerous and important are the matters which 
require to be studied and settled in physiological botany ; and still 
by appealing to Nature for fresh facts, or by re-examining old facts 
under new conditions.
Mr. Berkeley or Dr. Harvey might expatiate 
on the ample field for novelty which cryptogamic botany spreads out 
before those who will turn their talents in that direction.
In short, 
while the opportunities are constant and innumerable for ascertaining 
new and useful facts, it is merely wasting type, time and trouble, to 
print the trivial or to reprint the trite.

Observations on the Plants of the Land's End.
By the Rev. C.
A. Johns, M.A., F.L.S.
I HAVE been lodging for the last week in this the most southerly 
parish of England, and have greatly enjoyed the privilege of wander- 
ing at my leisure along the magnificent clifis of the Lizard, places to 
which I have often paid hurried visits, but which I have never hither- 
to had the satisfaction of exploring as naiTowly as I wished.
I have 
been not a little surprised to find how very few tourists resort hither, 
even in the summer ; for lovers of the picturesque would here find the 
grandest rock-scenery of this "rocky land of strangers," and subjects 
for sketching innumerable ; while the geologist would not fail to be 
interested in the treasures afforded by the serpentine district; and 
the botanist would no where in England have within his reach so 
many undeniable rarities.
Lotus hispidus occurs on the cliffs be- 
tween Penvoose Cove and the Lizard lights, near Kennuck Cove, 
and elsewhere ; Littorella lacustris on Grade Downs ; Trifolium 
Bocconi in a new station, a rocky mound on the right-hand side of 
the path between Cadgwith flag-staff and Poltesko Cove ; Thalictrum 
minus among bushes on the sand hills at Kennuck Cove ; and Asple- 
nium lanceolatum with fronds eighteen inches long, in crevices of the 
rocks at Hot Point.
Asparagus officinalis is now in perfection in a 
deep ravine between Cadgwith and the flag-staff", and in sufficient 
quantities to supply all the botanists in Great Britain.
My only diffi- 
culty was to select specimens small enough to dry.
I also found it 
in profusion among the precipitous rocks under the Rill ; but this 
station being more exposed to the sun than that at Cadgwith, the 
flowers had withered, and I could only discover one specimen with 
907 
berries.
This is also the best station for the very elegant but ill-sa- 
voured Allium Schoenoprasum, which grows in tufts in the scanty 
soil afforded by the cracks of the rocks.
Trifolium Molinerii is to 
be found at intervals along several miles of the coast between Cadg- 
with and Kynance, and is as undoubtedly wild as Statice Armeria, and 
in some spots quite as abundant.
Exacum filiforme I found some 
years ago sparingly on Goonhilly Downs, since which time I have 
never found it until within the last few days.
It is now growing in 
great profusion in the ruts of the cart road between Kynance and the 
Lizard-town.
I have been particular in giving the exact stations of these plants 
in case any botanists should happen to be travelling this way, when 
they may learn the names of the headlands and coves from any one 
whom they may meet.
I am sorry I cannot offer to supply your cor- 
respondents with specimens ; for in truth I have been too much oc- 
cupied with scrambling about the cliffs and boating to give much 
attention to drying plants.
I have, however, pointed out all the sta- 
tions of the rare plants of the district to an intelligent person residing 
in the parish, who has already begun to dry specimens, and will at 
the close of the season supply sets of about thirty-five species at a 
moderate price.
(See advertisement on the cover).
I have been much struck with the remarkable number of legumi- 
nose plants growing in this district ; the turf on the cliffs is almost 
made up of them, the grasses, plantains and sedges ; I have counted 
thirty-three distinct species.
The effect of the sea-breeze on some of 
the plants is very singular.
Euphrasia officinalis rarely exceeds two 
inches in height, and has thickly-set, decussate, fleshy leaves ; Trifo- 
lium repens is one of the earliest flowers, and has its stems, leaves 
and flowers closely pressed to the ground ; T.
procumbens has a 
wiry stem and large flowers ; it grows quite erect, and averages a 
height of about two inches : Chrysanthemum Leucanthemum has its 
leaves and stem fleshy ; the latter is rarely more than six or eight 
inches in height, and sometimes entirely wanting, so that the flower 
is sessile on the root.
If singular geological phenomena are not excluded from your pages, 
the following notice may not be without interest.
On the eastern 
side of the Lizard lights a green sward slopes down to the edge of a 
bold but not very lofty cliff, having on either extremity a point, the 
Bumble to the south, Ladmakeen to the north.
Underneath, a cave 
washed by the sea, and known by the name of the "Daw's Hugo,*" 
* " Hugo is Cornish for a cave.
908 
extends inwards in the direction of the lights.
On the night of the 
19th of February hist an irregularly elliptical piece of ground, fifty or 
sixty feet in diameter, and at a considerable distance from the edge 
of the cliff, suddenly, and without giving any previous indication of 
its being insecure, sank, and formed a rugged hole thirty feet deep.
It appears that the roof of the cavern gave way, owing to the loose- 
ness of the material of which it was composed : a gentleman who was 
on the spot the next morning informed me that the sea was tinged for 
a considerable distance by the red soil which had been dislodged.
The depth of the hole is daily increasing ; even the last week has 
made a perceptible difference: and a large mass on the landward side 
of the hole is becoming detached, and will undoubtedly fall shortly.
How near it may come to the light-house is a matter for the calcula- 
tion of the Trinity-board.
What makes this occurrence particularly 
interesting is, that at Cadgwith, a village three miles to the north, 
there is an immense funnel-shaped depression in the cliff, into the 
bottom of which the sea enters every tide under a natural arch-way ; 
and there can be little doubt that this, " The Frying-pan," as it is 
called, owes its formation to a similar subsidence of the soil into a 
cave, the sides of which have been in the course of time enlarged by 
the crumbling of its walls, and the detritus carried out through its 
mouth.
I think it highly probable that another winter will convert 
the pit under the light-house into a " Frying-pan :" but whether the 
lights will be endangered must of course depend on the dimensions 
which it attains.
It goes by the name of " Lions' Den." 
July 9th.
â€” I have had the good fortune to discover another station 
for Trifolium Bocconi, four miles off from the old Cadgwith station, 
on a sloping piece of ground near a cove called Cairn William, or 
Cathillian, between the Lizard Head and Kynance Cove.
On the 
same bank I also discovered in great abundance, but past flowering, 
Trifolium strictum.
So abundant are the Leguminosse at this spot 
that I covered with my hat Trifolium Bocconi, T.
strictum, T.
Moli- 
nerii, T.
scabrum, T.
striatum, T.
arvense, Lotus hispidus and An- 
thyllis vulneraria var.
Dillenii.
Had the rim been a little wider I 
might have included Genista tinctoria and Lotus corniculatus.
I 
have since found T.
strictum in abundance on the cliff between Pis- 
tol meadow and the (old) Lizard Head.
I enclose specimens for 
identification from both localities.

Seventeenth Meeting of the British Association for the Advancement 
of Science.
(From the 'Athenaeum,' dated July 10th, 1847).
Mr, a.
Henfrey read a paper on the Structure of the stems of 
Monocotyledons, in which he came to the conclusion that these stems 
do not increase by additions to the centre as is ordinarily thought, 
but, from the structure of Sparganium and other plants, he believed 
these stems were truly exogenous.
Dr. Lankester did not think it would be advisable to give up the 
terms exogens and endogens, although the distinction on which they 
were originally founded appeared to be erroneous.
He was glad to 
find that Mr. Henfrey's researches confirmed the view of the forma- 
tion of wood that he had maintained before the Association some 
years ago.
A paper was read from Dr. Iliff ' On some Experiments on the 
Koots of the Canna Indica with reference to their Value in an econo- 
mical point of View.' â€” The Dean of Winchester has succeeded in 
cultivating the Canna Indica in the open air ; and upon this fact Dr.
IlifF recommends its cultivation in this country for the purpose of 
procuring arrowroot.
Dr. Lankester stated that as the value of arrowroot starch was 
not greater as an article of diet than potato starch, and as its yield of 
starch did not appear to be so great as that of the potato, it was clear 
there would be little national advantage from such a proceeding.
Prof.
Allman made some remarks on certain peculiarities he had 
observed in the stomates of Ceratopteris thalictroides.
He also de- 
scribed at the same time a new genus of fresh-water Algse.
Mr. Thwaites communicated a paper ' On the Structure of Diato- 
maceae,' in which he stated that he had observed a conjugation of 
the frustules precisely similar to that which had been observed in the 
Desmidieae and some of the Oscillatorise.
Prof.
E. Forbes remarked this fact was of the utmost importance 
to systematic natural history, as it at once settled the disputed posi- 
tion of these beings in the organized scale, and placed them among 
plants.
A paper was read from Miss Twining ' On the British Flora com- 
pared with other Countries.' 
Capt.
Widdrington requested that persons travelling in the Tta-

lian peninsula would notice the various forms of oak, and, if possible, 
procure acorns, and send them to the Horticultural Society or to Kew 
Gardens.
' On the Diatomaceous Vegetation of the Antarctic Ocean,' by Dr.
J, HooKEE.
â€” The author found the Diatomaceae in countless num- 
bers between the parallels 60Â° and 80Â° south, where they gave a co- 
lour to the sea, and also to the icebergs floating on it.
The death of 
these bodies in the south Arctic Ocean is producing a submarine de- 
posit, consisting entirely of the siliceous particles of which the skele- 
tons of these vegetables are composed.
This deposit exists on the 
shores of the Victoria Land, and at the base of the volcanic mountain 
Erebus.
Dr. Hooker accounted for the fact that the skeletons of 
Diatomaceae had been found in the lava of volcanic mountains, by 
referring to the position of the Diatomaceous deposits in relation to 
Mount Erebus, â€” which lie in such a position as to render it quite 
possible that the skeletons of these vegetables should pass into the 
lower fissures of the mountain, and then passing into the stream of 
lava, be thrown out unacted upon by the heat to which they have 
been exposed.
Prof.
Allman made some remarks on the remarkable character of 
the Diatomaceae, â€” showing how, through their siliceous skeleton, 
they approached the mineral kingdom, â€” their power of locomotion, 
the animal kingdom, â€” and the possession of endochrome, the vegeta- 
ble kingdom.
Occurrence of Car ex montana near Ross.
By W.
H. PuRCHAS, Esq.
I AM happy to say that I was fortunate enough last month to dis- 
cover Carex montana, Linn., growing somewhat plentifully in a lime- 
stone wood between Tintern and St. Arvans, Monmouthshire.
To 
remove any doubts as to the genuineness of the plant I may state that 
Mr. Babington is my authority for the name.
I was too late in the 
season (June 17) to obtain any number of specimens, indeed, I could 
find scarcely any plants which had not shed their fruit.
The plant 
grows in tufts, which appear to me to spring in many, if not in all 
cases, from a thick, creeping, branched rhizoma.

Occurrence of June us diffusus near Halstead.
By Thomas Bentall, Esq.
It may perhaps interest the readers of the ' Phytologist' to be in- 
formed of a new locahty for Juncus diffusus {Hoppe).
Within the 
last few days I have found it in small quantity by the side of a road 
near Halstead.
It grows intermixed with J.
glaucus, and not being 
previously acquainted with J.
diffusus, I was rather surprised to find 
the two plants differing so much in appearance; the glaucous, deeply 
striated stems of the former presenting a striking contrast with the 
dark green, faintly striated ones of the latter.
Although it is highly probable that Juncus diffusus will be found 
in other localities besides those at present on record, it seems likely 
to prove a rare species.
I have made diligent search for it in many 
places where I thought it might probably occur, but have never met 
with it excepting in the spot above mentioned, and even there it 
grows very sparingly indeed.

A few Words on the Potato Crop.
By Edward Newman.
Immediately after the publication of Mr. Westwood's paper in the 
' Times' newspaper (Phytol.
ii.
889), I wrote to the Editor of that in- 
fluential journal, stating that Mr. Westwood was entirely in error as 
to his supposed symptoms of the disease in his potatoes, since the 
appearances he described were indicative only of approaching ma- 
turity.
I need scarcely say that my reply was not published : had it 
been on the alarmist side it would probably have received another 
fate.
I now wish to express, even at the risk of repetition, ray firm con- 
viction that the publication of such papers as those of Messrs.
Smee 
and Westwood do a serious injury to the country.
I will not say 
that Mr. Smee, or Mr. Westwood, or the editors or proprietors of 
journals, have a direct pecuniary interest in the high price of corn or 
potatoes : 1 believe the only motive on the part of writers is the 
flashy notoriety thus obtained, and that the journalists ever find their 
reward in the promulgation of the alarming or the extraordinary.
Newspaper readers don't like the vapid statement that matters are 
going on well ; the most moderate thirst for famines and panics ; the 
912 
intemperate require murders and burglaries.
An editor always an- 
nounces, with a modest and melancholy air, that " the potatoes as yet 
are perfectly healthy ;" that the " wheat at present looks unusually 
well." These announcements are made in his smallest type, and in- 
variably thrust into his most obscure corner.
How different when 
the leaves of a potato flag in the sun, or assume the yellow tint that 
indicates maturity !
Then pour in letters to the 'Cerberus :' then the 
* Cerberus' selects its largest type, and its most prominent site : then 
the 'Pict' reprints them from the 'Cerberus' and the 'Cerberus' reprints 
them again from the 'Pict'.
Like the reverberating echoes of thunder, 
the report is bandied from paper to paper, from north to south, until 
its origin is lost sight of altogether.
Journalists plead the taste of 
their readers, and how shall we blame them } 
It is, however, for the wise and prudent to examine for themselves: 
to use their own eyes and their own understandings.
When state- 
ments appear in the public prints that Mr, Verysoft has pulled up all 
his potatoes and sowed haricot beans after reading the very able let- 
ters of Messrs.
Smee and Westwood, there is no real necessity for 
following so strange an example.
A gardener who knew I took great 
interest in the subject, seriously asked my advice whether he should 
imitate Mr. Verysoft : " the haulm is laying about," said he, " the 
leaves are growing yellow, and they are all turning up at the sides." 
E. N.
â€” " Now let me inquire what sort of potatoes those are ?" 
Gardener.
â€” " Ash-leaved kidneys." 
E. N.
â€” " And when ought they to be ripe ?" 
Gardener.
â€” " In another fortnight." 
E. N.
â€” "And now tell me by what signs can it be known when 
they are getting ripe ?" 
Gardener.
â€” " Oh, the haulm falls about and turns yellow." 
E. N.â€” " Just as in these ?" 
Gardener.
â€” "Yes, a good deal like it" â€” (a pause, during which I 
could not help smiling) " but not so soon though, and Mr. Westwood 
says the disease comes this way." 
E. N.
â€” " I suppose, then, Mr. Westwood is a very great grower of 
potatoes : a practical man, who has served his apprenticeship to a 
market- gardener .'' is that so ?" 
Gardener.
â€” " I know not what he is; but the papers make a good 
deal of what he says.
Then a Mr. Verysoft has written a very cle- 
ver letter to say he pulled up his potatoes because they went so.
E. N.
â€” " And yet Mr. Westwood writes against Mr. Smee, and the 
papers made a good deal of Mr. Smee a few weeks before." 
013 
Gardener.
â€” "Yes, T recollect that." 
E. N.
â€” " Leave the potatoes alone for a fortnight, dig them at the 
usual time, and I'll buy the whole lot if there's any disease amongst 
them." 
This man told me eighteen days afterwards that he had housed his 
ash-leaved kidneys in a better state, and that they had afforded a 
better yield than during any year since this variety was introduced.
Here was a practical man, a good gardener, yielding his judgment, 
foregoing the teachings of twenty years' experience in favour of the 
crude vapouring of Messrs.
Westwood and Verysoft.
It is difficult 
to find words by which to characterize the folly of such people : it is 
almost enough to make one question the advantage of the printing- 
press, seeing it circulates such trash over every part of the habitable 
globe.
There are hundreds of people who, like this gardener, are 
willing to abandon, on an instantaneous summons, their knowledge, 
their judgment, their common sense, because one or other of these 
scribes is pleased, in his very ignorance, to issue to the world hypo- 
theses and recommendations which he has never taken the trouble 
either to examine or test.
The distracted gardeners who read the newspapers over their eve- 
ning ale, have made a sad onslaught on the poor ash-leaved kidneys 
this year, on account of the curling leaves, a character by which the 
variety is especially to be distinguished, a character well known to 
themselves, and one which three years ago they would have recog- 
nized as a virtue rather than a fault.
The late frosts of Maj' were 
also fatal to many patches of potatoes, the poor gardeners resolutely 
destroying them in consequence of the blackened leaves.
But as to 
that disease which committed such ravages in 1839, and again in 
1845 and 1846, I am unable to trace a single instance of its recur- 
rence in 1847 : I have received letters from all parts of the country 
from those most capable of giving correct information ; and the re- 
plies invariably inform me that the potato crop never promised a 
more abundant harvest.
These reports embrace England, Ireland 
and Scotland.
It will perhaps be recollected that last year the ear- 
liest positive information of disease was published on the 14th of 
July ; on the first of August, the day of the great hailstorm in Lon- 
don, the papers were teeming with melancholy and doubtless exag- 
gerated accounts of the progress of the disease; and on the 11th of 
August the crop was pronounced a complete failure.
How far the 
report was coiTect we have had subsequent means of judging.
I think it worthy of remark also that the early varieties of potato, 
914 
when harvested last year, had a peculiarly watery and immature appear- 
ance when cooked, and were without that solidity which is the usual 
characteristic of good early potatoes : this year, on the contrary, the 
early potatoes are unusually good and solid, not only as compared 
with last year's crop, but as compared with that of preceding years : 
my attention has been called to this fact by ray friend Mr. Cameron, 
late of the Birmingham Botanic Garden, a thoroughly practical cul- 
tivator and acute observer.
Thus, as far as past experience and 
present appearances can guide us in this momentous matter, the 
prospects for the approaching potato-harvest are peculiarly favour- 
able : the early varieties are already harvested in excellent condition, 
and the late ones are yet unscathed.
The supply is unusually large 
for the time of year ; and, should we have no more public fasts or 
famine prayers, to enrich the speculators through the fears of the 
people, there is every reason to believe that food will shortly be as 
cheap as it promises to be exuberantly abundant.

Researches in Embryology.
By W.
Wilson, Esq.
(Continued from Phytol.
i. 882).
In all investigations which require microscopic aid, the liability to 
error is greatly increased when the parts to be examined are very mi- 
nute and of delicate texture, and so connected with contiguous matter 
that the attempt to sever them without laceration and distortion is 
almost a hopeless task.
Researches in Embryology are attended 
with peculiar difficulties, and the former parts of this essay will show 
the expediency of engaging the attentive scrutiny of an additional 
number of competent observers in order to obtain correct and unde- 
niable conclusions.
My present purpose is to detail the result of an examination of two 
or three species of gourd, commenced last summer, with all the scep- 
ticism natural to one who had been repeatedly baffled in the attempt 
to ascertain the truth of the alleged fact that the pollen-tube pene- 
trates the orifice of the ovule.
Having obtained favourable sections of the fertilized germen, it 
915 
was practicable, by means of careful dissection, to bring into distinct 
view the apex of the ovule, bearing a tube projecting from the atte- 
nuated extremity or neck of the nucleus, and also to ascertain that the 
tube was continuous with the inflated portion of the neck of the nu- 
cleus, lying immediately above the point where the rudimentary em- 
bryo first makes its appearance.
This tube is in every respect similar 
to the pollen-tube itself, and I have traced it from the stigma to within 
a very small distance of the ovule, along the channels of stigmatic tis- 
sue which extend to the back of the placenta, which organ, in all 
probability, constitutes the termination and broadest expansion of 
the stigmatic tissue.
It is certain that a mass of loose tissue, in every 
respect the same as that proceeding downwards from the stigma, is 
always found in close apposition with the apex of the ovule, so that 
the entrance of the pollen-tube may be effected without any specific 
action of the ovule ; but inasmuch as the pollen-tube (if such it be in 
reality) is frequently swelled out and crooked immediately above its 
point of insertion into the nucleus, and the apex of the primine, at 
the period of fecundation, is fringed and gaping (though it is after- 
wards nearly closed upon the nucleus), it is possible that some action 
analogous to that of the Fallopian tubes may be excited at the proper 
juncture.
In two instances two pollen-tubes seemed to have reached 
the ovule, one of them not being inserted into the nucleus, but inter- 
posed between the primine and the nucleus.
It will still admit of a 
doubt whether the tube at the extremity of the nucleus be not a pro- 
longation of the nucleus itself, to meet the pollen-tube at some point 
to which the fertilizing influence is conveyed ; for in one particular 
instance the upper end of the tube proceeding from the nucleus was 
closed up, and rounded at its extremity, the interior being so full of 
grumous matter as to bear being cut in two without sensible derange- 
ment, and the extremity of the tube was so firmly connected with a* 
number of cellules of stigmatic tissue as to forbid the supposition of 
any continuity of that tube with any proper pollen-tube above it.
With this solitary exception my observations are in accordance with 
the opinion that the pollen-tube does actually extend to the ovule.
Previous to fecundation, the long, slender neck of the nucleus is cer- 
tainly quite destitute of any tubular centre : a transverse section 
shows an uniform mass of cellular tissue, containing active molecules, 
and the apex is compact and entire ; but immediately after fecunda- 
tion it is so loosened as to exhibit a fringed, expanding orifice, with 
the membranous tube passing down to the bottom of the neck of the 
nucleus, where it expands to nearly twice the diameter.
Usually the 
916 
expanded cavity is closely lined with the membrane, a circumstance 
in favour of the idea that the tube is only an extension from the nu- 
cleus ; but in two instances, the tube did not expand at the cavity, 
and seemed to be abortive insertions of the pollen-tube : these, con- 
trary to the usual course, were filled with slightly coloured matter.
The tubular lining of the neck of the ovule could not, at the time 
of fecundation, be traced much below the expanded cavity, and the 
embryo sac, when dissected away, appeared to be quite closed at the 
top.
If it be continuous with the tube, it is natural to expect that, 
at its first appearance, a very slight pressure would cause the regres- 
sion of the loose granular matter into the tube ; but this does not 
occur ; and if there must be an inflation of the pollen-tube, after its 
admission within the nucleus, we should rather expect to find it at 
the point where the embryo sac is formed ; but, between that point 
and the cavity in the neck of the ovule, there is, at the time of fecun- 
dation, a sensible barrier of rather compact tissue, through which no 
tubular passage could at any time be traced.
For this reason, I still 
hesitate to receive the theory of Schleider as being fully proved, though 
I admit that the evidence in its favour is very much stronger than I 
anticipated, and indeed all but conclusive ; for in a very short time 
after the insertion of the tube within the nucleus (the time of fe- 
cundation) the tube does appear to descend below the cavity ; so that 
either its lower extremity comes into direct contact with the previ- 
ously existing embryo-sac, or the extremity itself is inflated and con- 
verted into an embryo-sac.
It is difl3cult to say whether any amount 
of skill in dissection will prove which of these interpretations is the 
true one ; and it will be more practicable, and equally satisfactory, to 
obtain dissections of the ovarium at the precise juncture when the 
pollen-tube has reached the apex of the neck of the ovule, but has 
not penetrated so far as the cavity at the base.
To this point of the 
inquiry I would therefore earnestly direct the attention of all who 
may wish to pursue the subject.
The subjoined figures are taken, in every case, from actual dissec- 
tions.

Admeasurement of New Zealand and Norfolk Island Pines.
(Extracted from the ' Proceedings of the Linnean Society ').
" Read an extract from a letter addressed by Captain Sir E.
Home, 
Bart., R.N., to R.
Brown, Esq., V.P.L.S., giving an account of the 
measurement of some of the largest of the New Zealand and Norfolk 
Island Pines.
With reference to the former Sir E.
Home quotes from 
the Journal of Mr. Saddler, Master R.N., who was sent to New Zea- 
land in 1833-4 in command of the Buffaloe Store-ship to procure spars 
for the Navy, The tree which he describes was in a forest near 
Wangaroa, some miles north of the Bay of Islands.
Mr. Saddler 
says, ' On 16th (May, 1834) I went to examine a Kauri tree {Dam- 
mara australis, Lamb.) which Mr. Betts, the purveyor, in his search 
through the forest, had discovered a few days previous ; it is situated 
about two miles from the river, on the steep bant of a ravine.
It 
appeared perfectly sound and healthy, and measured forty-three feet 
nine inches in circumference, and sixty feet high without a branch.
Its head then spread out into forty-one principal branches, some of 
which were four feet through.
It is more than double the size of 
any tree I have before seen in this country.' Sir E.
Home adds, 
that the largest tree of this species that he saw was only eighteen 
feet eight inches in circumference ; but that in Norfolk Island he had 
measured the largest tree (of Araucaria excelsa, Sol.) known to be 
upon the island, and had found it to be 187 feet high, the girth at 
four feet from the ground fifty-four feet, and at twenty feet from the 
ground fifty-one feet.
This tree is hollow for sixteen feet above the 
ground, but is in good health."

Oil the Impregnation of Dischidia.
(Extracted from the ' Proceedings of the Linnean Society ').
" Read also a paper 'On the Impregnation of Dischidia.' By the 
late William Griffith, Esq., F.L.S., &c., &c.
Communicated by 
Robert Brown, Esq., V.P.L.S.
" In this paper, dated ' Mergui, March 7, 1835,' Mr. Griffith de- 
tails a series of observations made in January of that year on Dischi- 
dia Rafflesiana, Wall, and confirmed (with the exception of those 
relating to the development of the ovule) by the examination of an- 
other species, apparently allied to D.
Bengalensis, Colehr.
" Mr. Griffith commences by a description of the progress of the 
ovula from their first appearance as mere rounded elevations on the 
placenta.
The first change consists in a narrowing towards the base, 
which afterwards puts on the appearance of a funiculus, and at the 
same time, a rounded, rather shallow cavity appears on the upper 
edge of the ovulum, close to the funiculus.
The further changes take 
place rapidly ; the rounded cavity assumes the appearance of a deep 
fissure with raised margins, extending from the base of the ovulum, 
close to the funiculus, along the upper margin of the ovulum for 
about one-foiu'th of its length.
This fissure gradually lengthens ; 
its lips become more expanded, and a small, indistinct, groumous- 
looking mass becomes visible in the central line and towards the apex 
of the ovulum, which is the first rudiment of the nucleus, or of the 
cavity within which the future embryo is to be developed, and which 
becomes subsequently more distinct, and frequently assumes a 
rounded form.
In the perfect ovule the fissure is very large, extend- 
ing longitudinally from the base of the funiculus for about one-third 
of the length of the convex upper margin of the ovule ; its lips are 
gaping, and it is of considerable depth, gradually narrowing towards 
its fundus.
The grumous mass is now very distinct, and the first in- 
dications of an excavation around it are appreciable.
When no 
impregnation has taken place in flowers that have passed their meri- 
dian, the excavation is enlarged, the grumous mass is more irregular, 
and it frequently appears to be broken up, the component parts being 
irregularly grouped together.
"The partial closing of the corolla of Dischidia by the connivence 
of its divisions, and the short hairs with which those divisions are 
furnished internally in D.
Rafflesiana, induced Mr. Griffith to regard 
923 
foreign agency as inapplicable in determining the escape of the pol- 
linia from their anthers, and to believe that impregnation in any 
given flower is in this genus the result of the action of its own pol- 
linia.
The pollinia are erect, have no diaphanous margin, and de- 
hisce along that margin which is internal with regard to the cell of 
the anther, and which presents no appreciable difference of structure, 
but corresponds with the margin of dehiscence of the pendulous pol- 
linia first noticed by Mr. Brown.
The base of the stigma is slightly 
papillose in D.
Rafflesiana, and more evidently so in the other spe- 
cies ; and the fissures of communication are open in the former, but 
closely approximated in the latter.
In neither has Mr. Griffith seen 
the pollinia engaged in these fissures, but they are either caught by 
the processes of the corona or fall to the fundus of the corolla ; and 
in whatever situation they emit their boyaux, the cord formed by the 
aggregation of the latter always engages itself in the nearest fissure, 
where it becomes more opaque and grumous.
The cord then passes 
upwards to the base of the stigma, along which it is reflected until it 
reaches the union of the stigma with the styles, at which place it dips 
into one of them, or rarely both, and proceeds downwards to the pla- 
centa, causing a slight discoloration of the adjoining tissue.
The 
boyaux then separate, and proceed in every direction among the 
ovula, to which they become firmly attached.
They contain much 
granular matter, which has a strong tendency to accumulate towards 
their termination.
Mr. Griffith states that he has observed an oscil- 
latory motion, but no motion of ascent or descent, of the contained 
granules.
The tubes are simple, and one appears to be alloted to 
each ovulum, to which it remains applied for some time, invariably 
passing in at the centre of the fissure, and adhering so firmly that 
they break across rather than separate.
Mr, Griffith was unable to 
demonstrate their termination internally by actual dissection, but in 
one instance he observed the boyau to terminate about the fundus 
of the fissure in a cul-de-sac, which was crowded with granules.
Whatever the function of these granules may be, similar bodies exist 
in the cellular tissue of the ovula both before and after the applica- 
tion of the tubes, and the majority certainly disappear before the 
tubes reach the ovula.
"No immediate change appears to be produced in the ovula by the 
application of the tubes ; but some time afterwards the excavation 
appears to enlarge and extend towards the point of insertion of the 
tube ; and this action is continued until the whole of the granular 
mass disappears, and the chief part of the ovulum is occupied by the 
924 
now empty excavation.
No further appreciable change, except in 
size, takes place for some time, and the rudiments of the coma are 
even visible before any part of the embryo appears to be formed." 
Query concerning the First Section of Mr. BahingtorCs genus Cen- 
taur ea.
By Edward Newman.
A FEW days ago I received a note from Mr. Roby, of Great Mal- 
vern, from which 1 extract the following passage : " In a botanical 
excursion a few evenings ago, two specimens of a Centaurea were ga- 
thered, which, on a cursory examination, I supposed to be C.
nigra, 
/3.
radiata : on further examination, however, they proved to be C.
Jacea, Linn.; I coidd not be mistaken, from its having much narrower 
and sharper leaves than C.
nigra, viz., linear-lanceolate, lower ones 
broader and toothed.
In Watson's 'New Botanist's Guide' there is 
a ?
attached to the name in his list of species, indicating that it is 
very questionable whether or not this plant has really been found in 
the places alluded to.
My specimens are undoubtedly wild." 
At my request Mr. Roby kindly forwarded the specimens for exa- 
mination, and 1 immediately saw^ that it was identical with the plant 
I have several times recorded as being abundant in Herefordshire, 
and which I have found to agree with Mr. Babington's C.
nigrescens 
(Bab. Man.
Ed. 2, p.
181).
I forwarded the specimen to Mr. Wat- 
son, who pronounces it the C.
nigra, &.
radiata of Babington's 
Manual : from this decision it were useless for me to appeal.
How- 
ever, I gave Mr. Babington's descriptions a very careful examination, 
and compared them with the plant, and the result is, that I think Mr.
Roby is right in referring his plant to C.
Jacea of Babington ; that 
Mr. Watson is equally right in referring it to C.
nigra, 0.
radiata of 
Babington ; and that I also am right in referring it to C.
nigrescens 
of Babington.
The queries I would propose are these : â€” 
1st.
â€” How many British species are comprised under the following 
names ?
1. C.
Jacea 
2. C.
nigra 
3. C.
nigra, &.
radiata 
4. C.
nigrescens 
2nd.
â€” Are not the first, third and fourth absolutely identical } 
925 
3id.
â€” Is not the plant comprised under 3 and 4 the only British 
representative of C.
Jacea of Linnaeus ?
Does any other British plant 
exist as C.
Jacea in our herbaria ?
4th.
â€” Is the plant comprised under 3 and 4 the C.
nigrescens of 
Willdenovv ?
5tb.
â€” Is it a species, or a variety of C.
nigra ?
I am little inclined to multiply species, but I think the outer row 
of florets in one plant being invariably simple and fertile, and in an- 
other invariably barren and radiated, is a character so obvious as to 
induce one to suppose the two specifically distinct : there is no simi- 
larity in facial appearance as they grow side by side in the meadow^s 
and hedges around Leominster.
I shall feel greatly obliged to any botanist who will answer the 
proposed questions, or throw any light on so interesting a subject.
I 
have read with great care the characters italicized by Mr. Babington 
as important, viz., pappus ; pappus almost tvanting ; pappus very 
short tufted : also the descriptions of the involucral appendages.
The result of a perusal of these characters is the conviction that Mr.
Babington might find examples of each in flowers growing on the 
same stem.
The difference between the pappus being wanting, al- 
most uanting, and very short strikes me as peculiarly unsatisfactory.
The time has arrived for discarding imaginary species, and the duty 
of doing this is as imperative as the admission of new ones when such 
are really discovered.
The talents described under the respective 
names of " hair-splitting" and "lumping" are unquestionably yield- 
ing their power to the mightier power of Truth.

Pollen of the Fir.
"On the afternoon of Friday, the 25th ult., the wooded part of 
Morayshire exhibited a very strange appearance.
A smart breeze 
suddenly got up from the north-east, and all the fir plantations in its 
course appeared as if enveloped in smoke, large wreaths of which 
were seen to issue from them.
For a time the woods pi*esented a 
threatening aspect, and many persons concluded that they had be- 
come ignited from the excessive heat.
As the wind increased, what 
appeared as smoke rose high in the air in columns, the larger ones 
like lengthened, inverted cones, each bearing striking resemblance to

the outline of a waterspout when seen at sea.
At one time no fewer 
than fifty of these columns were seen rising above the various planta- 
tions in the district.
Suddenly the wind fell into a dead calm, and 
all disappeared.
We had the pleasure of being enveloped in a wreath 
of this substance, and were agreeably surprised to find ourselves be- 
daubed from head to foot with the pollen of the fir." â€” Aberdeen

The specimen agrees so well with the description of Bulbine plani-

ferred to, as to leave no doubt of its being that plant, which is the 
Anthericum bicolor of the ' Flora Atlantica.' On very slender charac- 
ters it has been made into a distinct genus by Kunth, who describes 
it under name of Siraethis bicolor.

Observations on the Descriptions of some of the Hieracia by Mr.
Babington in his ' Manual of British Botany^^- By James 
Bladon, Esq.
Being much interested in the different species of Hieracium, my 
first employment after receiving the Manual was to examine the dif- 
ferent specimens I had with Mr. B.'s descriptions.
In some of his 
descriptions he uses the expression ^^ glandular hairy ^'' which, by 
being put in italics, may be considered as indioating a poi-tion of the 
specific difference.
In some of the other descriptions he uses the 
word " seta," which, in botanical nomenclature, is understood to 
mean a stiff bristle not bearing a gland.
If he means any difference 
between the above two expressions he has not been happy in the use 
of them, as he describes H.
murorum "with white stellate pubescence 
and many black setae." In the specimens from Dursley (by Mr. Ste- 
phens), distributed by the Society, the involucral scales and pedun- 
cles are with black glandular hairs, not black setce.
In the specimens 
I have examined in this neighbourhood (amounting to some hun- 
dreds) tliey are much more densely glandular-hairy, and less pubes- 
cent than the Dursley plant, and without any common bristles or 
hairs (setae) being interspersed among the gland-bearing ones.
With 
regard to his separating murorum from maculatum and sylvaticum as 
a species distinct from either, I believe him to be correct.
I have 
observed them several seasons growing on the same bank, within a 
few inches of each other in some instances, yet out of numbers there 
was not one but might be distinguished at the first glance : the flow- 
ers of murorum, although generally a much smaller plant, are consi- 
derably larger than any of maculatum.
The absolute necessity of examining the species of Hieracium dur- 
ing the whole period of their growth, is instanced by his description 
of sylvaticum and maculatum, which he has united under vulgatum.
Fries.
He has inserted them in the section " Radical leaves present 
at the time of flowering." I yesterday examined a great number of 
plants of maculatum in a growing state, and found not one without

928 
its radical leaves being entirely shrivelled up and decayed.
By his 
statement of "Barren radical leafy tufts contemporaneous with the 
flowers," I believe I can suggest how he has committed the error.
In my remarks upon maculatum sent to the Society, September, 1846 
(Phytol.
ii.
686), I alluded to a second growth of flowers, in the same 
season, from the same roots : when the first shoots have nearly deve- 
loped all their flowers, or about the beginning of August, fresh buds 
are sent up from the roots, which throw out a tuft of radical leaves 
(if the summer is showery they are two or three weeks forwarder), but 
they are not " barren," but bear flowers from September until killed 
by the frosts in December.
A stranger to the varied habit of the 
plant, when shown a vigorous stem gathered in the middle of July, 
and another in November, would with great difficulty be induced to 
believe that they had sprung from the same root.
There may sometimes be gathered about the latter end of May a 
few small specimens of maculatum, about the size of the dwarf au- 
tumnal plants mentioned above, with from four to six or eight flowers 
and buds on each, and if gathered when the first flowers open, they 
may then be procured with the radical leaves not all decayed.
In his description of the pubescence of vulgatura and its varieties 
he makes no mention of glandular hairs being intennixed with the 
bristles on the upper part of the peduncles and the involucral scales : 
in some plants they are very copiously intermingled.
As if to show the deceptive character of many of the usual distinc- 
tions of plants when applied to this protean genus, I have now before 
me the panicle of one plant, which in one head has the seeds of a 
bright chestnut colour, and in another head they are a deep, sooty 
black, in others, again, of a light chocolate colour.
Under boreale, 
Mr. B.
alludes to the colour of the seed.
Hypochoeris radicata.
â€” I gathered several plants lately of this 
species, and found the back of the teeth of the corolla bearing glands: 
there were about three on each floret.
In 'English Flora,' iii.
351, 
Apargia hispida is stated to bear glands at the back of the teeth of 
the corolla.
Dactylis glomerata.
â€” Among plants subject to white varieties may 
be enumerated the above.
While out botanizing a few days since, I 
met with a quantity of the foregoing plant in the damp corner of a 
field : the anthers, instead of being of the usual deep violet colour, 
were a cream-coloured white, the stem and leaves were of a very 
pale green.
There were some ])lants of the usual colour growing 
929 
near Iheni, showing by the coulrast the extent of their departure from 
the normal colour.

Note on the Present Appearance of the Potato Crops around Bristol.
By H.
O. Stephens, Esq.
I HAVE carefully and anxiously watched the potatoes this season 
in order to notice, not only the precise day and hour of the attack of 
disease (if it unfortunately again appears), but also the atmospheric 
conditions which may accompany it.
Up to this date, August 10th, the crop is certainly generally sound, 
and of unusual promise, not only as to quantity, but in quality.
True it is, that abundant rumours of disease were afloat a few weeks 
since, and several samples were sent me for examination.
There 
was something wrong in these samples : the foliage was curled, yel- 
low, and flaccid, and like the haulm of nearly ripe plants.
The tu-

bers presented brownish yellow spottings, and cracked through the 
epidermis into deep fissures, an appearance very different to the dis- 
ease of 1845 and 6.
Possibly this might have been the effect of the 
hot and dry weather.
There was no spotting or the slightest traces 
of the Botrytis infestans on the leaves.
At the recommendation of an Aphidean, the haulm of these plants 
had been copiously dusted with lime, in order to destroy a non-exist- 
ent source of evil.
The conditions of these plants certainly were unlike those diseased 
with the murrain of 1845 and 6.
In the last week of July, intelligence of such a pointed nature 
reached me from a friend, that the potato-disease of last year had 
suddenly shown itself in the parish in which he resided, that I could 
not doubt the fact of the identity.
I visited this parish, Newton St.
Loe, near Bath, and found the statement of my friend but too correct.
If I had been led into the field blindfolded, I could have sworn to 
the presence of the murrain by the peculiar stench emitted from the 
foliage.
The disease occupied only a portion of the field, and this 
affected spot contained within its bounds patches of plants variously 
affected in intensity of disease, from a scattered spotting of the leaves, 
to complete rottenness of the whole haulm.
The worst spots or 
patches of disease were in isolated portions, scattered throughout the 
comparatively healthy parts of the crop.
The foliage of these plants was spotted with the blackened sphace- 
lations of the old murrain, and invariably presented abundance of the 
Botrytis infestans.
I have invariably found this fungus on the leaves and stalks of dis- 
eased potatoes, and should, if guided by my own observations alone, 
consider its presence as diagnostic of the malady.
I presume our 
Editor will admit that the disease of 1845 and 6 has re-appeared in 
this locality in 1847.
I trust and believe, however, not in its epide- 
mic, or rather epiphytic form, but as a local or sporadic occurrence.
Potatoes are at present abundant in our market, large, fully deve- 
loped, and full of starch, very different in appearance and quality 
from the watery tubers of last year.
I trust the late crop will prove 
as good and abundant as the early : up to this time there is every 
prospect of it.
If the potato-murrain does not become general upon 
the great fall of temperature we have just suffered, I think there is 
every probability this may be the case.

Notice of Occurrence of Ephnedium alpimim, many years ago, in 
Leigh Woods, near Bristol.
By Henry Oxley Stephens, 
Esq.
I WISH to put on record as a hint to other botanists, that 
many years ago I gathered Epimedium alpinum in Leigh Woods.
Soon after this I left Bristol, in order to complete my medical educa- 
tion, and my botanical researches being interrupted for a considerable 
period of time, the exact spot on which I gathered this interesting 
plant has totally passed from my memory.
It was in Mr. Miles's 
portion of the Wood, but I have searched in vain for it since.
A 
specimen gathered by myself, and marked at the time, is still extant 
in the herbarium of Dr. Rogers, of this city.

There 
was a large attendance of members and visitors, among whom were 
Hewett Cottrell Watson, Esq., member of the Botanical Society of 
London, and G.
E. Dennes, Esq., Secretary of the same Society.
R. A.
C. Austen, Esq., F.G.S., took the Chair, and opened the pro- 
ceedings with some well-timed remarks, and alluded to the fact that 
a better day could not have been chosen, it being the birth-day of 
Gilbert White, of Selborne.
Mr. L-vine, one of the Secretaries, read 
the report of the proceedings of the Council and of the progress the 
Society had made since its formation.
The report was unanimously 
adopted, with thanks to the joint Secretaries, Messrs.
Irvine and 
Medlock, for their attention to the interest of the Society.
From the 
Treasurer's report it appeared that there are 105 members, and the 
Society is in a flourishing state.
The various officers having been 
re-elected, and the name of Henry Lawes Long, Esq., of Hampton 
Lodge, added to the list of Vice Presidents ; the Chairman delivered 
a very interesting statement, in which he alluded to the growing 
wants of such Societies, the pleasure he had in presiding, and in wit- 
nessing the flourishing state of the Society.
He then alluded to the 
932 
valuable gift of boolis which had been made, and the many interest- 
ing plants which had been discovered by the members of the Society.
A vote of thanks was passed to the Chairman, who acknowledged the 
compliment.
A party, accompanied by the Chairman, then went on 
a geological and botanizing excursion, amongst whom were Messrs.
Watson, Denues, the Rev. J.
C. Cox, Messrs.
Bull, Eager, Molyneux, 
Medlock, Salmon, and other members of the Society.
They proceeded 
along the side of Chauntry Downs, through a most interesting coun- 
try, ascending St. Martha's Hill, and from thence to Chilworth Ma- 
nor, the seat of the Chairman, at whose hospitable board they were 
entertained.
During the excursion the attention of the party was 
particularly drawn towards large patches of Cuscuta Trifolii, which 
infested a clover-field, many of the patches occupying a space of se- 
veral yards in diameter, within which the clover was entirely destroy- 
ed by this parasite.
Fedia Auricula was observed intermixed with 
olitoria and dentata.
This species had not been noticed as occur- 
ring in the neighbourhood previously.
On their return to Guildford, 
shortly after seven o'clock, they rejoined the party at the Museum, 
and partook of tea and coffee with about sixty other ladies and gen- 
tlemen, members of the Society, after which they separated, the 
whole evidently much gratified with the day's proceedings.
At the monthly meeting of this Society, held at Guildford, on 
Thursday evening, the oth inst., specimens of Pyrola minor were 
presented by Master Wood, from Old Thorns Wood, in the parish of 
Scale, in this county.
This interesting addition to the Surrey Flora 
was fust discovered by Miss Marian Wood, during the summer of 
1839, and it is owing to the formation of this Society that the fact of 
its existence in this county was brought to notice.
Mr. Salmon vi- 
sited the locality, and found the plant in great abundance growing 
under the underwood.

Characters of several new species of Compositae ;" by George Gar- 
dener, Esq.
Among the above enumerated papers, that which recoi'ds the dis- 
covery of the Malva verlicillata in Wales, may be supposed of most 
interest to British botanists generally.
From the " infoi-mation " 
given in the Join-nal, it appears that the Malva in question was dis- 
covered in a corn-field at Llanelly, in Glamorganshire, by Mr. James 
Motley, in 1845 ; only very few specimens being found.
Mr. Borrer 
has raised the plant in his garden, from the "wild" seed; and he com- 
municated examples of the wild and garden states to Sir W.
J. 
Hooker.
Both these distinguished botanists have thus had before 
them the necessary data for determining the species ; and as some 
degree of unceilainty nevertheless still remains, we shall make a few 
extracts from their remarks and descriptions.
" Mr. Borrer had the kindness to communicate to me," writes Sir 
William, " a small wild specimen from the field at Llanelly, and one 
about twice the size, raised from wild seed, and of which about the 
upper three-fourths of the plant is here represented.
The most re- 
markable characteristic of the species is the absence of margin (or 
angle to the margins) to the carpels, so that there are deep grooves 
or channels, as it were, between them, and they only seem to touch 
or unite at the axis of the entire fruit.
There is, further, a slightly 
elevated dorsal line on each cai'pel, and lines radiating at the sides 
from the axis and extending to the rounded margins.
In my own 
rich herbarium I could not at first detect the species, and was on the 
point of publishing it as new, when, on examining carefully the fruit 
of Malva verticillata in the Linnean herbarium, I did not hesitate to 
refer Mr. Motley's plant to it.
The Linnean sample seems to be a 
cultivated one, and China is the country given as the habitat.
Native 
wild specimens I have not seen ; but I possess the same species from 
the Botanic Garden at Glasgow; and the * Malva microcarpa' of 
Montbret, from Egypt, does not appear different.
The M.
verticil- 
lata of Turczaninow, from Dahuria, in my herbarium, has no perfect 
fruit ; Beruhardi has constituted of that a new M.
pulchella.
I am 
happy to have my view of the identity of this plant with the Linnean 
M. verticillata confirmed by so careful an observer as Mr. Borrer, 
who writes thus," &c.
" Although," adds Sir William, " the discovery of this mallow in 
Wales has thus been, I trust, the means of enabling us in future bet- 
ter to distinguish the species, I fear we must not venture to consider 
it a native of Great Britain.
It is not described even as naturahzed 
935 
anywhere in Europe.
' Is it not odd, however,' Mr. Borrer further 
remarks, ' that Malva crispa should ever have been thought a variety 
of this?
It is rather remarkable that Mr. Motley has seen the M.
crispa in the same field, but concluded that it was from its being- 
kept in gardens for garnishing dishes at table.
Is it possible that af- 
ter all they are but varieties ?
I do not recollect the fruit of M.
crispa.' In regard to M.
crispa," (resumes Sir William) " though it 
is said to be a native of Syria, I possess only a cultivated specimen 
in my herbarium from our English gardens; and the fruit of that, 
though nearly resembling that of M, verticillata, is yet different.
The margin of the carpels is not rounded off, but comes to an angle, 
so as not to present a distinct furrow between the carpels ; and the 
radiating lines from the sides do not become obsolete at the margins, 
but extend across the back to the dorsal line : such is the case with 
the excellent figure in Reichenbach's ' Icones Fl. Germ, et Helv.
MalvaccEe, Tab. 166, n.
4834.'" 
It would seem from our quotations, that Sir W.
Hooker refers the 
Welsh plant to the Linnean Malva verticillata chiefly, if not solely, 
on account of the similarity of its fruit.
Mr. Borrer recognizes this 
point of resemblance, but gives his opinion for their identity more 
guardedly on account of certain differences in the form and disposi- 
tion of the leaves, between the Welsh and Linnean specimens.
Both 
these botanists apparently entertain some suspicion that the Welsh 
plant may be a form of Malva crispa ; and the fact of Mr. Motley 
finding both of them in the same field, must be allowed to weigh 
something on the side of this view.
The Malva crispa is probably a 
garden variety, like the curled parsley or crisp mint ; and it seems 
not beyond probability that the Welsh examples may be those of 
the same species in its more natural condition.
We have not seen 
any of the Welsh specimens ; but the figure of the " single carpel," 
given in the Journal, is truly very like the carpels of M.
crispa ; and 
if we make the necessary allowance for the want of curled leaves, the 
figure of the plant itself might pass for one of M.
crispa.
In our 
dried example of the latter (a road-side specimen, probably from 
some garden) the carpels are not so much rounded on the back as 
the figure of the undivided fruit expresses, and some of the radiating 
lines from the sides of each carpel do extend across the back, as Sir 
William Hooker intimates.
It is to be hoped that some of our coun- 
try botanists will raise the M.
crispa from seed, and ascertain whe- 
ther any of the progeny may sport (revert?) into something more like 
M. verticillata.
We transcribe the description, marking by italics 
936 
those three characters which render it less applicable to a specimen 
of M.
crispa, we can scarcely say, quite inapplicable ; for the diffe- 
rences are those of degree more than those of kind, comparative ra- 
ther than absolute.

Mr. Fitt recorded his discovery of Sphaerocarpus terrestris " abun- 
dantly in fructification near Yarmouth," at page 544 of our present 
volume of the ' Phytologist.' In the 'London Journal' he gives figures 
and a more extended description of the plants observed by himself, 
" on clover layers at Bradwell, Suffolk.
In the mild moist January 
of 1846 the plant was very abundant, producing its capsules in plenty 
from about the middle of February to the middle of March : in the 
early part of April it had disappeared entirely." 
Dr. Dickie's notes on the Algae have reference to the altitudes at 
which he has observed certain species in Aberdeenshire ; together 
with some prefatory remarks on their motions, divisions and conju- 
gation.
Perhaps a paragraph or two from the latter may have inte- 
rest for some readers of the ' Phytologist :' 
" The motions of certain species of Oscillatoria are at least equally 
distinct as those of any organisms usually considered to belong to 
the vegetable kingdom, and yet it has been denied that they possess 
any independent power of motion.
They move notwithstanding.
Three kinds of motion may be observed in them ; first, the oscillat- 
ing, one end of the filament being fixed, the other describing a seg- 
ment of a circle with greater or less rapidity ; second, a distinct 
bending of the filament upon itself, presenting the appearance of a 
writhing motion ; third, the progressive gliding motion of an entire 
filament or of a fragment, resembling that of certain Mollusca or Pla- 
narieae.
" Mr. P.
Grant has directed my attention to a remarkable motion 
which may be observed in newly collected specimens of Haematococcus 
binalis.
This beautiful species propagates freely by self-division ; 
and the cells vary in number in different individuals, in some two 
and four, in others eight, and more rarely sixteen.
The phenome- 
non in question is that of rotation of the cells in the interior of the 
037 
raucous matter which surrounds them.
Leuwenhoeck observed long 
ago that, in the ova of certain Mollusca, the yolk revolves in the sur- 
rounding fluid at a certain stage.
If there be no mistake about the 
phenomenon alluded to in Hajmatococcus, and T cannot detect any 
source of deception, and if to it we add the mode of subdivision of 
the cells, we have a remarkable analogy between the ovum of certain 
animals, and an organism decidedly vegetable, and of very simple 
structure.
In the ovum of the animal it is well known that the mo- 
tion is produced by ciliae, which make their appearance at an ad- 
vanced stage ; what may be the true cause in the plant I am unable 
at present to say.
The motion in the Haematococcus is very slow 
compared with that in the ova in question." 
As the other papers relate to the plants of distant lands, they are 
foreign to the avowed objects of the * Phytologist.' The "Supple- 
mentary Notes on the Botany of the Azores " may be a partial ex- 
ception; the affinities between the Azoric and Britannic Floras being 
close, and constituting important facts in any attempts to account for 
the present distribution of plants on the surface of the earth.
Some 
brief remarks on these aflfinities were made in the ' Phytologist ' for 
last year (Phytol.
ii.
463).
In the article before us, Mr. Watson adds 
a list of forty-eight species, received by him from the Azore Islands, 
since the publication of his former papers on the same subject.
Thirty of these added species are clearly indigenous in the British 
Islands, and four of the others are more or less established with us ; 
the remaining fourteen species, with one exception, being recorded 
natives of South Europe or Madeira.
On looking over the list of 
names, however, there can be no hesitation in ascribing much of the 
specific afiinity between the two insular Floras to the operations of 
mankind, rather than to any more natural agency ; many of the spe- 
cies being those agricultural or road-side weeds which emigrate 
widely with mankind, as Lamium amplexicaule and Capsella Bursa- 
pastoris.
But there are others in the list which appear to be among 
those least likely to have been so conveyed, as Hypericum Elodes 
and Myriophyllum alterniflorum.
It is a circumstance worthy of note, while alluding to similarities 
in the botany of the diff"erent countries, that several of the Azoric 
representatives of British or European species are stated to present 
certain slight differences, sufficient to separate them as varieties, and 
yet not sufficient to establish them as genuine species ; and, more- 
over, that in some instances these differences have been transmitted 
038 
from generation to generation of plants raised in England originally 
from the Azoric stock.
Ten years ago, it might have been said that almost nothing was 
known about the botany of the Azore Islands.
At the present time, 
however, it is probable that the published lists of Azoric species are 
more complete than those of Madeira plants ; and are not much, if 
at all, behind those of the Canary plants.
Nor is it only in published 
lists of the species that this rapid progress has been made in the last 
few years.
Our resident Consul, Thomas Carew Hunt, Esq., has 
enabled the Botanical Society to distribute numerous specimens, par- 
ticularly of the more characteristic species ; and has thus rendered 
them familiar to the eyes of many botanists, who might otherwise 
never have seen samples of Azoric botany.
It seems that Mr. Hunt 
is a member of the Botanical Society of London, and doubtless a 
very useful one ; for we find Mr. Watson thus writing of his contri- 
butions : â€” 
" All the species enumerated in the subjoined supplementary list, 
excepting Viola tricolor and Lolium perenne, which were sent from 
Flores by Dr. Mackay, have been communicated to the Botanical 
Society of London or to myself, from the islands of St. Mary (very 
few) and St. Michael, by Mr. Hunt, together with an ample supply 
of duplicates of most of the rarer species of the Azores, for distribu- 
tion to the members and correspondents of that active and useful So- 
ciety.
I may be allowed to observe here, while referring to Mr.
Hunt's valuable exertions towards completing our knowledge of Azo- 
ric botany, that in sending his collected specimens to the London 
Society, he has taken the course which best insured their immedi- 
ate distribution into numerous herbaria in England, Europe and 
America."

On the Claims of Linaria supina to a place in the British Flora.
By Isaiah W.
N. Keys, Esq.
Mr. Babington has, in the second edition of his Manual, introduced 
Linaria supina as " a true native " at Plymouth.
This he has done 
as upon my authority ; but Mr. B.
has fallen into an error, which I 
exceedingly regret.
I have communicated with him upon the sub- 
ject, and he has requested me to say, in any publicity which I might 
039 
give to the inadvertence into which he has fallen, that he no less re- 
grets the circumstance than myself.
Your readers would perhaps feel an interest in the history of this 
plant, which will enable them to judge of its claims to be in any way 
inserted among the British Flora.
In the summer of 1845 I noticed on some ballast-heaps, composed 
oi chalk andjiini, deposited on the outskirts of the limestone quar- 
ries at Catdown, Plymouth, a Linaria (which had, I believe, been 
previously observed, but passed unregarded) a description of which I 
could not find.
Tn consequence of this, I sent a specimen to Mr.
Babington, and subsequently a second, he not being able to deter- 
mine the species by the first, owing to the absence of seeds.
I fur- 
nished him with all particulars as to the place where I had found the 
plant, and the soil in which it was growing, suggesting for his consi- 
deration the probability of its having been brought to Plymouth with 
ballast.
On the 15th October he wrote me as follows : "Linaria 
from Catdown quarries.
â€” After a very careful examination of this, I 
have come to the conclusion that it is a form of the L.
supina, called 
L. maritima formerly by De Candolle.
It is a native of the south 
and west of France, and therefore may be a native with you.
I hope 
that you or some of your friends will look carefully into the question, 
and endeavour to determine with certainty if it came with ballast or 
not.
Where does the ballast come from ?" 
Not having been able to procure any information at all satisfac- 
tory, here my correspondence with Mr. Babington relative to this 
Linaria dropped, and was not revived until I saw the plant in the 
2nd edition of the ' Manual of British Botany.' I was startled to see 
the words " a true native," and my name attached, because my opi- 
nion always was that the plant came into the quarries by accident.
I immediately wrote to Mr. Babington, expressing my surprise and 
vexation, when he replied (26th July, 1847), " I certainly never felt 
more sure of anything than that you considered the Linaria supina a 
NATIVE plant, not one introduced with ballast.
As the latter, it must 
be expunged from our lists.
My belief is that the words were quoted 
from a letter from you (I cannot find it now) in answer to one from 
me, asking if the plant was really a native or not." The letter of in- 
quiry to which Mr. Babington here alludes, must be that of the 15th 
October, 1845, to which, as already stated, / never replied.
He has 
therefore laboured unr^er a misconception; I acquit him of all design 
to propagate error ; and before this appears in print, he will have 
employed the press to correct the mistake.
940 
If it were not encumbering your pages, I would state my opinion 
that the plant is naturalized at this place.
The heaps of rubble on 
which it grows have not been disturbed for years, and until they be 
cleared away, the plant will in all likelihood remain and spread itself.
It is now to be found more scattered than it was three years ago.

Plymouth, August 5, 1847.
The Castanha Tree.
" Back of the house was a grove of fine trees, some apparently hav- 
ing been planted for ornament, others bearing profusion of various 
sorts of fruits.
The one of all these most attractive was that which 
produces the Brazil-nut, called in the country castanhas.
Botani- 
cally it is the Bertholletia excelsa.
This tree was upwards of one 
hundred feet in height and between two and three in diameter.
From 
the branches were depending the fruits, large as cocoa-nuts.
The 
shell of these is nearly half an inch in thickness, and contains the 
triangular nuts so nicely packed that once removed no skill can re- 
place them.
It is no easy matter to break this tough covering, re- 
quii'ing some instrument and the exercise of considerable strength : 
yet we were assured by an intelligent friend at the Barra of the Rio 
Negro that the Guaribas or howling monkeys are in the habit of 
breaking them by striking them upon stones or the limbs of iron-like 
trees.
This friend related an amusing incident of which he had been 
witness, where the monkey, forgetful of everything else, pounding 
down the nut with might and main, in a fever of excitement struck it 
with tremendous force upon the tip of his tail.
Down dropped the 
nut and away flew monkey, bounding and howling fearfully.
How 
long the victim was laid up by his lame tail our friend was unable to 
inform us ; but we thought one thing certain, that monkeys had 
changed since Goldsmith's day, inasmuch as at that time, as we are 
informed, the tip of a monkey's tail was so remote from the centre of 
circulation as to be destitute of feeling.
When the castanha-nuts are 
fresh they much resemble in taste the cocoa-nut, and the white milk, 
easily expressed, is no bad substitute for milk in coffee.
This soon 
becomes rancid, and at length turns to oil.
The nuts are exported 
largely from Para, and are said to form a very important ingredient in 
the manufacture of sperm candles." â€” A Voyage up the Amazon.

On the Gelatinous Materials of Plants.
Academic des Sciences, June 14, 1847.
â€” " M.
Freray presented a 
memoir upon a question which has occasioned much controversy 
among chemists, namely, the nature of the gelatinous materials of 
plants.
He especially endeavours to show that it is no longer possi- 
ble to confound pectine with the gums, mucilage, and above all, with 
pectic acid, which is soluble in water.
He describes many isomeri- 
cal substances, and gives to each a new name.
He distinguishes by 
the appellation of pectose a substance which, like cellulose, is inso- 
luble in water, alcohol and ether, and by the action of the weaker 
acids is converted into pectine.
It is chiefly found in the tissue of 
vegetables, together with cellulose.
According to M.
Fremy pectose 
occurs in the generality of fruits and roots ; and like diastose, it is 
capable of forming, with the gelatinous substances of plants, a series 
of isomerical metamorphoses.
When a mixture of pectose and pec- 
tine is inclosed in a flask and hermetically sealed, the pectine is seen 
to be successively changed into pectosic, pectic, parapectic and me- 
tapectic acids, without forming any secondary product.
A.11 sub- 
stances composed of carbon differ in composition solely in the ele- 
ments of water which they contain.
The author draws from his 
researches this important physiological conclusion, that fruits, in 
their progress towards maturity, pass through different intermediate 
stages : â€” that pectose predominates in green fruits ; that in propor- 
tion as maturity is attained, the pectose is changed into pectine ; and 
that in fully ripe fruits, the pectine is in its turn converted into meta- 
pectic acid." â€” Nouvelle Revue Encyclopedique, Juin, 1847.
Occurrence of Juncus diffusus on Epping Forest.
By Edward Forster, Esq.
Juncus diffusus, Hoppe, is to be found on Epping Forest, between 
Walthamstow and Woodford, not far east of the seven-mile-stone, on 
the New Road, and also in a wood hard by, called Great Shrubbush, 
in the parish of Wanstead, growing intermixed with two or three va- 
rieties of Juncus glaucus, the most green of which approaches it in 
appearance, but may be easily distinguished by a proper attention to 
the distinctive characters pointed out in the last edition of Babington's 
Manual ; to which may be added, Juncus diffusus is a much more 
Vol. II.

solid, and therefore harder rush, and also that the fruit of this species 
is considerably smaller than that of Juncus glaucus.
The difference of the two species becomes more conspicuous as the 
season advances ; the spikes of Juncus diffusus fall in decay, while 
those of Juncus glaucus, with the larger fruit, remain strong and 
upright.

Account of a Botanical Excursion to WJiitsand Bay.
By Frans.
p. Pascoe, Esq.
Whitsand Bay is a short distance to the north-west of the Rame 
Head, and about three or four miles from Plymouth.
It must be care- 
fully distinguished from another bay of the same name, near the 
Land's End, as ignorance of this has led to very vexatious mistakes.
I left home on the 4th August, taking the coast-road through 
Fowey and Looe.
Crossing Par Sands, midway between St. Austell 
and the former place, Glaucium luteum, in great abundance, is very 
conspicuous, but the rarest plant here to any other than a Cornish 
botanist is Polygonum Raii, which is scattered plentifully over the 
beach, in company with Salsola Kali and Cakile maritima.
The ca- 
verns in the low cliffs abound in Asplenium marinum, and along its 
base are a few plants of Rumex Hydrolapathum.
Another plant 
which grows here, but was not now in flower, is Raphanus maritimus, 
the finest specimens, however, are found in the Lizard district, where 
it is very common.
Ascending the hill from Par, Sison Amomura 
occurs in the hedges; and at Bodinnick, where' the ferry for carriages 
across Fowey river is established, Hypericum maculatum grows by 
the road-side ; in the spring Allium ursinum, a rare plant in Corn- 
wall, abounds here and in the neighbouring hedges.
Bodinnick is a 
small village adjoining Fowey ; in both places Centranthus ruber 
adonis some of the old walls.
As my principal object in this excursion was to obtain Euphorbia 
Peplis, I hastened on through Looe, intending first to examine Sea- 
ton Sands, which I had somehow got the notion was a locality for 
this plant, and the next day to proceed to Whitsand Bay. On my arri- 
val at Seaton, however, the rain, which had now continued some time, 
having completely drenched me, and finding no accommodation 
943 
there, I drove off to Hessenford, distant 2j miles, where I passed the 
night.
Hessenford is beautifully situated in a well wooded valley, 
with cottages surrounded by orchards, its mill-stream and church.
Hieracium umbellatum is common in this part of the county, and 
from the new road to Seaton I observed by the river side Tussilago 
Petasites, with leaves nearly two feet across.
Nine o'clock the next morning saw me on Seaton Sands.
I pro- 
bably spent more than hour here, searching the shore and adjacent 
ground for the Euphorbia.
The sands are of no great extent ; fish- 
ing-nets were drying on one part, and sea-weed for manure, in large 
heaps, was rotting in another ; so that setting aside the rapacity of 
botanists, if the poor Euphorbia grow here, it is not very likely to es- 
cape destruction at no very distant day.
A group of Atriplex rosea, 
all female plants, and of the deepest purple, covered a piece of 
ground where a heap of sea-weed had stood.
Polygonum Raii was 
mixed with P.
aviculare : I do not recollect ever having seen them in 
company before.
My course was now directed along the beach, but the rocky shores 
in many places projecting into the sea, and finding nothing more re- 
markable than Carex distans and Atriplex laciniata, I struck up 
across the country towards Crafthole.
Here I again diverged towards 
the coast, and in a short time, amid thickets abounding in Rubia 
peregrina, descended the cliff, by a narrow pathway, at Whitsand Bay.
Whitsand Bay, or White-sand Bay, for it is spelled either way, is 
certainly something of a misnomer ; a few yards of brown sand along 
the base of the cliffs is all to distinguish it from the rocky coast with 
which it is continuous ; it is, however, a spot of great interest to the 
botanist.
In addition to many other rarities, here Orobanche ame- 
thystea rears its remarkable form, and in Great Britain only here.
We are indebted to the Rev. W.
S. Hore (Phytol.
ii.
239) for having 
brought this plant under the notice of British botanists, although it 
was discovered many years before by the Rev. C.
A. Johns.
It is 
constantly parasitic on Daucus maritimus, and flowering in June, but 
the persistent corollas gave it the appearance of being still in full 
bloom.
A revision of the English, better still of the European spe- 
cies of Orobanche, is a desideratum, and to any botanist wishing to 
undertake it, I shall be happy next season to forward fresh specimens 
of our rarer Cornish ones, viz., O.
rubra, amethystea and Hederae.
Inula Crithmoides was just coming into flower, Statice spathulata 
and Euphorbia Portlandica were, on the other hand, going out, never- 
theless I gathered excellent specimens of the three.
Jones, in his 
944 
Tour, gives " shore near Crafthole " as a station for Statice Liraonium ; 
S. spathulata, which cannot be overlooked, and is not otherwise men- 
tioned, was probably intended by him ; Tinfolium sufFocatura, having 
the same station, seems to have escaped later researches.
More re- 
cently, however, Mr. Hore has added Vicia lutea ; being too late in 
the season 1 did not see it.
Daucus maritimus and Crithmum mari- 
timum, the latter very fine and in dense beds, abounded here, as 
they do on nearly all our rocky shores.
On one part of the cliff I 
think I recognized Squamaria lentigera, but it was out of reach ; it 
is found sparingly at Newquay, on the north coast.
The sun had been early obscured by clouds, and a disagreeable 
drizzle succeeded, which about noon rapidly increased to heavy rain.
1 had now nearly anived at the eastern end of the Bay, and was pre- 
paring for the weather and my return, when at my foot, and sur- 
rounded by bushes of Cakile maritima, was the anxiously sought 
Euphorbia Peplis !
There was but one plant, nor did I, after another 
fruitless search, commit it to my vasculum without a pang that I 
might perhaps have taken the last of its race on the Cornish shores.
In 1830 Mr. H.
C. Watson* found it very sparingly on the sands be- 
tween Penzance and Marazion, a locality where it was very plentiful 
in the time of Ray. I believe it has not been found there since.
The 
localities given in Somerset, Dorset and Cardigan shires require mo- 
dern confirmation ; it may probably be still found in Devonshire.
It is an interesting plant, belonging to a southern race, but once 
plentiful in the west of England.
I shall be glad to see the pages 
of the ' Phytologist' recording what is known of its present localities.
My ride home from Hassenford through Liskeard and Lostwithiel 
was without any interest beyond what the heavy and continued rain 
afforded.
In the hedges near the former town Cornus sanguinea, 
Melittis Melissoph^'llum and Viburnum Opulus, plants common only 
in the eastern part of the county, are to be met with, although not 
now in flower.
Note.

debted for any information, either by lists, specimens, or remarks 
which your readers may be able to afford me.

Notice of the ' Reports and Papers on Botany,' published by the May 
Society, 1846.
The last-published volume of these Reports contains analyses of 
many valuable and interesting papers on various subjects connected 
with Botany, both foreign and British, which appeared during the 
years 1842 and 1843.
These are arranged under the heads of " Mor- 
phology of the Coniferae, by Dr. J.
G. Zuccarini ;" " Reports on 
Botanical Geography, by Prof.
Grisebach ;" " Memoir on the Nu- 
clei, Formation and Growth of Vegetable Cells, by C.
Nageli ;" and 
" Report on the Progress of Physiological Botany, by Dr. H.
F. 
Link." To some of them we may probably revert at a future 
period; for the present we content ourselves with a few extracts, 
which we trust will prove acceptable to such of our readers as may 
not have access to the volume itself.
On the Excretion of a Fluid from the Apex of the Leaves of Cal- 
la and Canna.
â€” This phenomenon has already been mentioned in 
our pages by the late Mr. E.
J. Quekett (Phytol.
i. 218) and Mr.
Wilson {Id. 612); the following observations from the pen of L.
F. Gartner are interesting.
" After an historical introduction follows an accurate diary of this 
phenomenon in specimens of Calla, which the author had under his 
eye.
He then gives a chemical examination of the distilled fluid, 
which contains scarcely any solid matter ; the residue after evapo- 
ration showed principally mucus and hydrochloric acid.
Further, 
with regard to the organization of the leaves, he states, that the ves- 
sels are not continued to the end of the awl-shaped prolongation at 
the apex of the leaf, but that here there is nothing but cellular tissue.
The secretion takes place at the extreme end of this prolongation, in 
a length of 1 to 1*5 m.
in a scarcely visible manner, until the fluid 
has collected into a drop.
After the death of the prolongation, the 
margin of the extreme apex of the leaf itself takes on the same func- 
tion.
The special organ of the exudation of the moisture, seems to 
be the elongated pores of the cuticle ; and the imbibition of the ex- 
creted fluid, which is sometimes observed, seems also to be owing to 
the same.
Light has no perceptible influence on the dropping from 
the leaves.
Warmth alone has no special action ; though it has 
when it is combined with immersion in water.
The excretion was 
feeblest in a morning ; increased towards noon ; was most copious in 
the afternoon, from 2 to 5 p.
m., and declined again during the 
946 
night ; but this periodicity is not accurately determined.
There can 
be no doubt that the dropping arises from an excess of fluid beyond 
that which is requisite for the nourishment of the plant.
The drop- 
ping ceases with the development of the spathe and organs of repro- 
duction.
The necessity of the plant for water was greatest during 
the night, but especially on the development of the spathe.
" A supplement gives a diary of the watery secretions of the 
leaves of Canna angustifolia, indica, and latifolia.
The secretion of 
watery fluid takes place in Canna, not from the apices of the leaves 
as in Calla, but from the apices of the parallel ribs, which terminate 
at the margin of the leaf; and generally more from those which are 
nearer the apex of the leaf, than from those which are situated nearer 
to its base.
From these terminations of the principal veins of the 
leaves, close to the margin, where they lose themselves in a delicate 
network or anastomose (seldom in the middle of the surface of the 
leaf), towards evening and at night, imperceptibly exudes a clear 
watery fluid, which collects in drops and patches on the upper and 
on the under surface of the lamina ; running from it sometimes, but 
rarely, in a quantity, as copious as from the apex of the Calla aethio- 
pica.
The temperature of the air stands at least in no near relation 
to this excretion.
It is rather promoted than hindered by the growth 
of the leaves ; but it is quite the reverse when the plant puts forth 
stalks and flowers.
This secretion then generally ceases for ever." 
On the Ramification of CaryophyllecB.
â€” Professor Wydler, of 
Bern, observes that " the branches [of these plants] are situated, as 
we know, alternately in the angles of the opposite leaves, the upper- 
most pair of leaves excepted, where the branches likewise are oppo- 
site.
The author, however, remarked opposite branches also in 
Cerastium arvense, Stellaria graminea, Spergula nodosa, but one of 
them was always more diminutive than the other.
Also in the Cary- 
ophylleae, the branch connected with the first is always less deve- 
loped, but that of the second bract (vorblatt) is the stronger and more 
ramified.
The author adds that though these may be the external 
appearances, their intimate nature remains a secret to us, but that it 
might be possible to discover it if we were to regard the plant, not as 
a complete, but as a progressive object.
All physiologists have done 
this, and I know of none but descriptive botanists who regard the 
plant as complete, and are able to view it only in that light.
The 
cause does not lie here, but in that we do not take into view the 
whole vegetable kingdom, and consider in all its extent the eflbrt of 
947 
Nature to advance from the raore diffuse vegetable life, to the more 
collected, concentrated animal life, and thus to consciousness." 
" Examen Organographique des Nectaires, par M.
L. Bravais.
â€” 
Linnaeus designated as nectaries those parts of the flower which se- 
crete a sweet fluid ; but he not only included many parts in which no 
such secretion can be perceived, but also described as nectaries 
whatsoever was neither calyx, flower, stamen, pistil nor ovary.
Sci- 
ence is in want of an expression, says the author, to distinguish a 
portion of the male apparatus (andraeceum) or even a circle of parts, 
which may or may not secrete a nectareous fluid.
Most of the ex- 
pressions employed do not answer their purpose.
In the absence of 
better the author chooses the terras nectary and disc ; the first ac- 
cording to the Linnaean definition, the second in the case where the 
nectaries form a circle, or ring (Wirtel).
Then follow the divisions 
of the nectaries, according to situations where they occur.
"1.
Calyx-nectaries.
To this division belong the glands of the 
calyx in many Malpighiacese, some Euphorbiaceae, the spur on Im- 
patiens Balsamina, also the nectary which occurs at the base and 
within the sepals of the Malvaceae, as in many kinds of Malva, in La- 
vatera trimestris, &c.
It forms a whitish and rough swelling (bour- 
relet).
" 2.
Hypopetalous nectaries.
Only one example is known to the 
author ; externally, and at the base of the flower of Chironia decus- 
sata is found a yellow, notched ring, which produces honey.
" 3.
Corolla-nectaries.
They occur in most flowers, especially in 
the lower portions of the petals, in the form of pits, channels, spurs, 
&c.
" 4.
Hypostaminal nectaries (Hypostemone Nektarien), between 
the corolla and the stamens.
The author observed them in sixteen 
natural orders : Capparideae, Resedaceae, Hippocastaneae, Ampelideae, 
Geraniaceae, Oxalidaceae, Sapindaceae, Terebinth aceae, Passifloreae, 
where they constitute numerous filaments and cavities secreting ho- 
ney ; Loaseae (in which I have called them ' Parastaminal '), Cucnrbi- 
taceae, Asclepiadese, the corona of which they form (which I have 
named Paracorolla) .
" 5, Staminal nectaries.
The author describes here many such : 
e. gr.
in a double columbine, in the violet, Fumaria, Corydalis, Dia- 
nella, the Laurineae, Vinca, Phaseolus, Alsine media.
" 6.
Nectaries inserted between the stamens, as in Melianthus ma- 
jor and minor, Tropaeolum, several Cruciferae, Sibbaldia procumbens.
948 
" 7.
Discs between the stamens and the ovary (the perigynium of 
Link).
Very frequent ; occurring in ahnost one half of Dicotyledons.
" 8.
Pistil-nectaries.
Rare, in a few Euphorbiaceae.
Linnaeus re- 
ferred to this division the three glands at the apex of the ovary in 
the hyacinth.
" 9.
Nectaries on the receptacle.
These belong for the most part 
to the preceding ; but with regard to this subject the scales in the 
flowers of some Crassulaceae need investigation.
There are, however, 
many flowers which secrete a nectareous fluid, in which, nevertheless, 
no special nectary can be discovered.
The microscopic examination 
of nectaries shows only cells of various kinds, often filled with sap, 
but no spiral vessels : they may, however, be seen in Campanula Ra- 
punculus, but we cannot be certain here that something has not been 
cut off" from the receptacle.
Under the section, ' On the Symmetry 
of Nectaries,' the author describes their situation in various flowers.
He then distinguishes in each leaf of the ' andra3ceum ' four portions, 
the ' support,' ' nectary,' ' anther,' and ' limb,' and applies this with 
much ingenuity to individual plants: the greater number of nectaries 
are parts which want anthers and limb.
He applies this also to the 
pistillary members, where the ovary is compared with the support, 
the style with the nectary, and the stigma with the anther.
He also 
considers in the last place the leaves of the stem, in which, accord- 
ing to our author, the base of the petiole, very often thickened, cor- 
responds to the support ; the petiole, often covered with glands, to 
the nectary, and the lamina to the anther.
On the use of the secre- 
tion of the nectary the author has but little to say ; he thinks that in 
niany plants it becomes re-absorbed, and probably serves for the nu- 
trition of the ovule.
"The division into discus and nectary, according as they have a cir- 
cular ai-rangement or not, is not much to the purpose, since there are 
undoubted nectaries which stand in a circle, like the pits on the pe- 
tals of Fritillaria imperialis, L., and many others.
That which the 
author also calls disc, includes parts so very various that they can- 
not be well designated by one and the same term.
I adhere to the 
terminology which I formerly adopted, 'which is, at least, readily in- 
telligible, where ' Paracorolla,' ' Parapetala,' ' Parastemones,' are rea- 
dily distinguished as to their position and form.
'Perigynium' 
expresses all the parts surrounding the pistil, whose variations are 
readily announced by the use of an adjective : ' Perigynium discifor- 
me ' is the great disc which in many flowers surrounds the pistil ; the 
only form for which the word disc is applicable.
The word 'glandulae' 
949 
may always remain in use, even when these parts secrete no fluid ; 
first, because it is acknowledged by almost all descriptive bota- 
nists, and also, because even anatomists have retained this expres- 
sion, where no secretion takes place, e.
gr.
' glandular conglobatae.' 
The word nectary may always be retained as a general name ; but in 
descriptions it would be better to say fossae nectariferae, &c.
On the ^ liivolucra^ in Cynosurus and Setaria.
Dr. H.
Koch ob- 
serves " that the so-called involucrum of Cynosurus consists of sterile 
spikelets, is apparent to the eye, and has been already recognized by 
many.
The so-called setae of Setaria are peduncles, whose flowers 
have not attained to perfection.
The author shows this in detail, and 
then adverts to the distinctions between Setaria viridis, italica, and 
verticillata.
He states in conclusion that simple alternation is con- 
fessedly in the grasses the fundamental arrangement, from the leaves 
up to the stamens, which are almost always arranged by threes.
Our Setariae, he continues, present the interesting fact, that the tran- 
sition, the fluctuation between the two numerical proportions (the 
occurrence of twos or of threes), is not confined, as in the other grass- 
es, to the contrast between flowers and leaves, but appears even in 
the distribution of the branches.
Although the endeavour to give 
predominance to a divergence of one-third is sufiiciently well marked, 
yet it is never completely established ; for not only, as frequently 
occurs, do the primary branches, at the commencement and end of 
the spike, revert to a divergence of one half; but all the secondary 
branches up to the last, the peduncle, again exhibit a transition from 
one-third to one-half, and the latter divergence continues thencefor- 
ward, as is usual in double flowers and their parts ; so that the Seta- 
riae change their order of arrangement twice, whilst other grasses do 
so for the most part but once.
" In the leaves of most grasses we see indeed the arrangement in 
threes, for the alternating leaves are in general only a contracted 
whorl.
There is also another circumstance connected with the in- 
florescence constituted by the peduncles, viz., the antecedence (Pro- 
lepsis), the earlier or later development, and of this the author has 
taken no notice.
The expression divergence is very unsuitable, and 
the author himself speaks of the casual magnitude of the angle.
Most morphologists interchange the terminology of descriptive with 
that of morphological botany, which has quite another field.
' Invo- 
lucrum' signifies the arrangement of parts, external and inferior to 
the floral sphere, either around a single flower, or around several.
What is the character of these parts, considered morphologically, has 
Vol. II.

950 
not always been as yet inquired ; and even where this has been done, 
it still remains doubtful, and frequently requires accurate anatomical 
investigation, which cannot be instituted by the descriptive botanist, 
or one who applies description to the recognition of species.
On 
these principles the expression ' involucrum ' for Setaria may be rea- 
dily justified, and the addition 'setosum' likewise, for the fibres 
themselves are stiff and bristly.
What is a seta, is very differently 
defined by botanists, and the describer can only have regard to the 
filamentous form, and stiffness of the bristle of an animal.
Cynosu- 
rus has no involucrum, as I have also stated in * Hort.
Bot. Berol.' â€” 
' spiculae fultae bracteis pinnatifidis ;' for these parts represent bracts, 
though they might also be glumes grown together." 
New Theory of the Fertilization of Plants.
â€” Dr. Hartig has here 
presented some valuable observations on a most interesting subject, 
which has more than once been ably treated on by Mr. Wilson in the 
pages of the ' Phytologist.' After some remarks on the present state 
of the doctrines with regard to Fertilization, the author " proceeds in 
the first section to endogenic impregnation, or to impregnation in the 
interior of the ovary.
In this case, for instance, a pollen-tube, or 
tube of pollen-grain (Ballschlauch), as the author says, reaches as far 
as the ovum, penetrates into the foramen of the ovule, grows through 
the cellular tissue of the nucleus (Befruchtungskegel) to the spot 
where the germ originates.
According to the author, in the Coniferae 
the pollen itself enters the micropyle of the naked ovum, attaches it- 
self firmly to the ovule (Befruchtungsei), and sends a short tube into 
the cellular tissue, in consequence of which a series of remarkable 
formations commences, the last of which, after an interval of more 
than a year, in those Coniferae that are two years in maturing the 
seeds is the commencing germ, as was previously quoted from the 
author's ' Lehrbuch,' in the former yearly Report.
The pene- 
tration of the tube into the ovule has been satisfactorily ascertained 
in many families ; but it is the object of the author to show, that fer- 
tilization does not always take place in this manner.
This is followed 
by the impregnation of the placenta.
In a number of plants by no 
means insignificant, the pollen-tubes can be traced as far as the 
ovary, sometimes even to its base ; while we seek for them in vain in 
the foramen of the ovum, as in many CEnotherae.
In all plants, con- 
tinues the author, to which a deeper introduction of the tube is gene- 
rally peculiar, the tube turns itself in the shortest way to the cellular 
tissue of the stigma, penetrates the cuticle, the superficial and the 
cortical cells, to the central bundle of vessels, and runs from thence 
951 
parallel with this latter to the end of the style, where it passes from 
the cellular tissue of the stigma into the conducting fibres of the ca- 
nal of the style.
When the tube does not enter the cellular tissue of 
the stigma by the shortest course, but runs to a greater extent free on 
its surface, the penetration of the tube does not take place at all in 
most cases, as is seen in Clarkia pulchella.
The author now consi- 
ders the penetration of the pollen-tubes into the canal of the style, 
where they follow the conducting fibres.
The conducting fibres of 
the canal of the style correspond, as the author says, in their struc- 
ture to the absorbent hairs (Saughaaren) of the stigma ; in most cases 
the absorbent hair is nothing more than the most external cell of a 
series of conducting fibres, which latter is, however, destitute of cu- 
ticle.
The conducting fibies consist always of two membranes lying 
one within the other, of a mucous membrane and a tubular membrane.
The pollen-tubes, however, often perforate the outer membrane, in 
parts where an open canal occurs, and reach the interior.
Although 
we can trace the tubes as far as the ovary, but no further, a transmis- 
sion of the fertilizing matter from the tubes adjoining the placenta, 
into its cellular tissue, takes place ; and it is forwarded to the ovule 
through the cells or fibres of the funiculus.
The author attempts to 
prove thereby that in plants with many-seeded ovaries, the number 
of ova presents often a great disproportion to the number of tubes.
In CEnothera longiflora, for example, the ovary contained about 
1000 ova, of which some 250-300 attained complete development.
The usual area of a transverse section of 300 tubes is '00785 of a 
square line ; but the canal of the style close above the ovary has 
only an area of '00785 of a square line, so that even if it contained 
nothing but tubes, it would comprise only one-fifth of those which 
are necessary to fructification ; but in the lower part of the canal of 
the style of this plant not so many as 50 tubes can be counted at the 
most.
The pollen-tubes also appear of greater duration when they 
enter the ovum ; but here, namely, in GEnothera longiflora, the au- 
thor has never found a tube in a single ovum.
Since the tube is 
usually of such a size that it could not easily be contained in the 
pollen-granule from which it arises, the author considers it probable 
that the fertilizing material of the granules which have not advanced 
to the formation of tubes, being absorbed from the surface of the 
stigma and introduced into the cellular tissue, is taken up by the 
tubes, and conveyed in common with their proper contents to the 
spot where impregnation is effected.
" In the second chapter, epigynous impregnation is treated of, un- 
952 
der which the author includes those cases in which the style, the 
stigma, or the absorbent hairs of the stigma act as organs of ingestion 
in the process of fertilization.
First, of fertilization by means of the 
style, especially by means of the curious hairs of the style in Campa- 
nula.
The author saw pollen-globules or grains in the hairs of the 
style, sometimes in remarkable abundance.
He regards it as decided 
that fertilization takes place by means of these hairs ; even the re- 
traction (Einsliilpung) of these hairs could only serve to approximate 
the pollen to the elongated cells of the central bundle of spiral ves- 
sels.
Although, after the separation of the lobes of the stigma (Nar- 
benarme) pollen reaches the inner side of the lobes which are cover- 
ed with hairs, and polleu-tubes become there developed, yet fertiliza- 
tion cannot take place by this means, since that condition is but 
seldom observed.
Moreover, the author coated the stigma with a 
solution of gum, previous to the separation of the lobes from each 
other, and yet fertilization took place.
" To impregnation of the stigma the author refers all cases in 
which the formation of tubes from pollen-grains upon a naked stig- 
ma, that is, one destitute of hairs, cannot be shown to occur, as in 
Petunia, Nicotiana, Alropa, &c.
The pollen here falls on a mucous 
covering, which mucus is produced by peculiarly formed mucus-cells.
" Impregnation of the absorbent hairs of the stigma, or of the pa- 
pillae upon it, takes place in many plants, as for instance, in Matthi- 
ola annua, and others.
The papillae consist of three membranes : 
the middle one is termed by the author the raucous membrane ; it is 
covered with a delicate external membrane, and incloses an internal 
tube, whose granular contents are coloured brown by iodine.
We 
must here distinguish the impregnation which takes place by pene- 
tration of the tubes into the middle membrane of the hair, since the 
cuticle is in that case wanting, as the author has shown with regard 
to Matthiola annua, in the third part of his Elements.
Further, im- 
pregnation of the absorbent hairs by penetration of the tubes into 
their cuticle, as in Glaucium violaceura ; impregnation of the absorb- 
ent hairs by absorption, particularly in Capsella Bursa-pastoris, a 
very frequent occurrence ; impregnation of the absorbent hairs by 
contact, as in Clarkia pulchella.
In all these cases a formation of 
tubes takes place.
Frequently, and especially in those flowers which 
have the stigma covered with large masses of pollen, we see that only 
those granules succeed in forming tubes which are restrained by the 
deeper situated pollen-layers from coming in contact with the surface 
of the stigma or with the hairs ; whilst those granules, which are in 
953 
immediate apposition to the latter, yield their contents to the stigma, 
without developing the least trace of tubes : Eschscholtzia cristata 
affords an example.
Lastly, to epigynous impregnation also belongs 
that form which occurs without the formation of tubes, of which the 
author consequently never found any example in the majority of 
Composita3, Umbelliferae, Lobeliaceae, &c.
" The third section treats of perigynous impregnation.
On the 
outside of the ovary of Reseda odorata, says the author, at the part 
to the inside of which the ovules are attached, and accurately corre- 
sponding to the course of the placenta, run narrow, pectiniform, ele- 
vated striae of papilliform projecting external cells, running in a 
direct line from the upper point of union of the pistils, nearly to the 
base of the ovary.
If we examine the flowers of this plant shortly 
after the successful shedding of the pollen, we find a quantity of pol- 
len adhering to the striae, which has partly discharged its contents 
without forming tubes, and not unfrequently penetrates the cuticle by 
means of a delicate tube, so that a perigynous impregnation in this 
plant can scarcely be questioned.
' EJypogynous ' impregnation is 
the subject of the fourth section.
The coronet of Passiflora seems to 
be intended to assist in fertilization.
It is covered with papillae, like 
the stigma ; the openings of the anthers are directed towards it, in 
the same way as they usually are towards the receptive organs.
Lastly, the author remarks, that those are not always pollen-tubes, 
which appear to be such, even when they are hanging out from the 
ovule ; as in the Cruciferae, where they are prolongations of the con- 
ducting tissue, and in the Cupuliferae, where they belong to the 
ovule.
The former are present before the shedding of the pollen : 
they are even articulated, and the middle chamber is filled with a 
clear sap, containing green granules : the latter often originate long 
after the pollen-shedding, as is the case in Quercus rubra." 
Mr. Wilson has also observed that pollen-grains penetrate the cavity 
of the hairs of the style in Campanula, as reported by him in Hooker's 
'London Journal of Botany,' for 1842.
Monstrous or unusual developments of parts of plants frequently 
furnish a key to the true character of such parts ; witness the 
monstrous state of Cerastium discovered by Mr. Babington and 
figured by Lindley, and many others.
Several curious examples are 
described in the present volume; some of which we select.
Thesium intermedium, Sfc. â€” Reissek describes a monstrosity which 
" was observed in a specimen of Thesium intermedium, and in fact 
in a plant which was covered with the ^cidium Thesii.
It showed 
954 
the following deviations from the typical form.
In the first place, al- 
terations in the carpellary whorl, with normal formation of the other 
whorls ; secondly, alterations in the whorls of both carpels and sta- 
mens, with normal or but slightly irregular arrangement of the peri- 
gonium ; thirdly, alterations in all the whorls, with the formation of 
simple leaves ; and fourthly, alterations in all the whorls, with pro- 
gressive central restoration of flowers.
From a comparison of mon- 
strous plants in all their phases with the allied normal forms, their 
morphological interpretation is ascertained.
It follows, that Thesium 
intermedium which is injured by vEcidium in the formation of the 
stem, attains a higher grade of development, and herein approaches 
nearest to the character of Osyris ; and further, that it also, in regard 
to the production of flowers, stands partly upon a higher scale, and 
herein approaches to the New Holland forms.
From the conforma- 
tion of monstrous flowers it follows : 1.
That the perigonium is ca- 
pable of a gradual transformation into vegetative leaves ; but that 
the whorls of stamens and carpels retain their characters with greater 
tenacity, and rather perish than become transformed into vegetative 
leaves.
2. That the disc disappears with the failure of the stamens, 
and does not remain like an expansion or margin round the bud ge- 
nerated in the interior of the perigonium ; therefore, there is either 
no special expansion of the axis, or in case this takes place, the ex- 
pansion is constantly merged in the elongation of the axis." 
Peucedanum Oreoselinum.
â€” "On the stem, at a certain height, 
were observed a quantity of umbelliferous rays, from thirty to forty, 
which surrounded the stem in a circle ; the involucra were trans- 
formed into compound leaves.
The elongated stem bore a many- 
lobed bract, from whose axil a single distinct umbel proceeded.
The summit of the stem terminated in an ordinary compound umbel.
The author therefore believed that in the umbel one ray always re- 
presents the axis." 
" Peloria of Calceolaria crenatifolia, described by E.
Meyer.
The Peloria of this plant presented a bell-shaped tube, and an in- 
verted, funnel-shaped, four-cleft limbus.
The pistil was perfect, and 
developed without the slightest deviation from the normal standard ; 
but the stamens were wanting altogether, without the slightest trace 
of the situation where they should have grown.
The author proceeds 
to explain the Peloria in the following manner : in the natural corol- 
la both stamens stand below the short upper lip ; the lower lip on 
that account appears larger and more vividly coloured, because no 
stamens arise from it.
Should the stamens now be taken completely 
955 
away, the equilibrium between the two lips must be restored.
The 
Peloria consists then of a whorl of leaves completely reduced 
to corolla ; and exhibits spots all round the base, because all 
round no stamens have come to perfection.
Neither of the Pe- 
loriae was terminal.
The stalk of one was even so much grown 
together for its whole length with the stalk of a completely normal 
neighbouring flower, that the calyx of each stood with its back to 
the other, and both the corollas were extended almost horizontally." 
" Linaria vulgaris.
Monstrous flowers described by E.
Heufler.
A very remarkable monstrosity, and deserving of notice because it is 
out of the usual routine of metamorphoses.
The upper lip of the 
flower had nothing peculiar, beyond the i-udiment of a spur on the 
dorsal surface.
The lower lip was decidedly larger, and was in- 
creased by one or two mis-shapen lobes ; the throat more swollen and 
excessively wrinkled.
The four stamens were changed into trumpet- 
shaped tubes.
Each individual tube stood out from the throat at a 
different inclination.
The lowest part was like a spur ; the middle 
was set with orange-coloured hairs ; the uppermost part was again 
smooth, and opened in the most various ways.
The margin was 
turned irregularly outwards, and in every single segment differently 
formed.
The rudiment of the fifth stamen had become a similar 
tube-shaped leaf, which from the inner surface of the upper lip 
was free, and projected beyond the flowers.
This metamorphosed 
fifth stamen was very delicately formed ; quite naked and transpa- 
rent, of a dilute sulphur-yellow tint.
Very often were traces of a 
sixth and a seventh stamen present, either in the form of a transpa- 
rent spiculum, or as a delicate pedicle, bearing a yellowish, leaf-hke 
scale.
Instead of the pistil, a second flower more or less developed 
was present.
From the description of this Peloria, we see that it is 
no retrogradation from a normal flower, but an advance towards a 
more highly developed form of inflorescence." 
Campanula persicifolia.
â€” " The leaves of the plant constantly ap- 
proximated more to the character of flowers as they reached the upper 
part.
The leaves of the stem, from the ninth to the thirteenth, had 
their margins crisp and wavy ; from the thirteenth to the eighteenth 
they had a blue colour ; from the nineteenth to the twenty-third the 
leaves continually diminished in size, and were of a greenish blue, 
very pale colour ; some were coherent by their margins.
A whorl of 
half-flower, half-leaf-like organs were developed, before the five ver- 
ticillate stamens appeared.
Each of these last bore at its upper and 
anterior part a two-celled, well-developed anther, whose cells were 
956 
filled with pollen not yet granular.
Eacli cell belonged to a half of 
the leaf, and was divided from its fellow by the midrib.
The pollen 
masses, both on the anterior and posterior surfaces, appeared to be 
covered by an epidermic membrane.
Each cell was divided into two 
long chambers (concamerations), which were bent inwards at the 
margin where the anther opened.
At the extremity of the axis were 
three free carpellary leaves ; no traces of ovules could be seen." 
Delphinium Consolida.
â€” "The corolla (the nectary of Linnaeus) 
was protruded of five petals, and almost regular ; the upper petals 
elongated into spur-shaped appendages, and these petals alternated 
with the sepals.
This flower forms a proof of the views of Jussieu.
But indeed they are generally received." 
" With general considerations of monstrosities, (the preceding only 
refer to individual cases) ai*e connected the ' Malformations ' collect- 
ed by Professor von Schlechtendal, in the ' Botan.
Zeitung,' part 29, 
p. 492.
' The four-cleft margin of the corolla of Syringa vulgaris,' 
says the author, ' frequently presents an additional lobe, which is ge- 
nerally not of corresponding size to the rest.
In such cases, the 
number of stamens is also increased by one, and this in consequence 
of the division of one of them, whose filament curves itself, and on 
this incurvation appears a little spot which developes pollen.
More 
rarely flowers are observed, and thisliappens especially in the white- 
flowered variety, the corollar limbus of which is divided into a num- 
ber of lobes ; from thirteen to twenty-five are sometimes noticed.
The stamens are also more numerous in this case ; two pistils stand- 
ing near each other at the base of the flower show that the coales- 
cence of at least two flowers has laid the foundation of this peculiar 
structure.
In Arctotheca repens, the author observed three florets 
of the disc which were united together.' 
" ' Very frequently,' says Von Schlechtendal, ' we may notice the 
spiral twisting of the stem of the plant, and also of the leaves, com- 
monly when their development has been interrupted in any way.
This twisting often coincides with flattening.
In Triticum repens 
the author also remarked a twisting of the uppermost leaf, which he 
here accurately describes.
In roots I have also frequently seen such 
a twisting.' "

TYNESIDE NATURALISTS FIELD CLUB, 
The Club held its second meeting of the year on Wednesday, the 
1 6th June, at Castle Eden Dene, and notwithstanding the unsettled 
state of the weather, the day of meeting was an exceedingly pleasant 
one ; for although rain fell abundantly in many places not far distant, 
the weather at Castle Eden was delightful.
This Dene, celebrated 
throughout England for producing that beautiful and singular flower, 
the lady's-slipper {Cypripedium Calceolus), besides many other rare 
plants, and other objects of natural history, is remarkable also for the 
beauty of its scenery, and the luxuriance of its vegetation.
The first 
meeting of the year was held at Morpeth, and the scene of the ram- 
bles of those members of the Club who were present, was on the 
banks of the Wansbeck, from Morpeth to a little below Bothal ; and 
at this meeting, as well as at the second, the party had a very beau- 
tiful day to add to their enjoyment of scenery, which, for quiet 
beauty, is seldom exceeded.
The usual plan of the Club is to as- 
semble to breakfast at some inn conveniently situated near the place 
of meeting, then to have their excursion, and to dine afterwards at 
such place and hour as may be agreed upon.
When, however, the 
distance from home is too great to allow time for this, each party 
provides for himself, and dines in the open air.
At the meetings at 
breakfast and dinner, when there is time, announcements are made 
of what parties have done in those branches of natural history which 
each may pursue, papers are read, and the proceedings of the com- 
mittee are reported.
When the papers are too long, then they are 
read at an evening meeting, held for that purpose, in the rooms of the 
Natural History Society of this town.
One leading object of the 
Club is the formation and printing of correct lists of the various natu- 
ral productions of the counties of Durham and Northumberland, with 
localities, descriptions of new species, and such observations as may 
be deemed necessary.
It is also in contemplation to draw up and 
publish a succinct account of the Geology of the district, with lists of 
the fossils occurring in different formations.
These various papers,, 
although necessarily printed separately in the first instance, will, 
when complete, form a continuous series in that order which may be 
considered the best.
The first part of the Club's publications will 
comprise the proceedings for the last year, several interesting papers, 
and a list of the Coleoptera and of the Molluscous animals.
Other 
portions of the Entomology and the Botany are in active preparation.
Vol. II.

As it is the intention of the Club to promote the investigation of 
the natural history of the district as much as possible, they intend to 
sell their publications separately, as well as together, in order to ac- 
commodate those pursuing different departments of the science.
Whilst, however, they will further as much as they can the investiga- 
tion of the nature both of the crust of the earth itself, as well as of 
the various living beings which it produces, they will prevent, as far 
as their power may extend, the extirpation of any species or race, 
being aware that such an event cancels a chapter as it were in the 
natural history of the district.
The Club now numbers between 
eighty and ninety members, and is still increasing, and when the na- 
ture of its objects is understood, we can have little doubt of its future 
prosperity.
In conclusion, we may be permitted to imagine how effi- 
ciently the natural productions of other districts might be investi- 
gated by similar institutions.
The Berwickshire Naturalists' Club 
has long been in existence, and much information respecting the na- 
tural history of the banks of the Tweed and its neighbourhood has 
been obtained by its labours ; and if the example were followed and 
carried out in other districts throughout the kingdom, we should thus 
have a better means of forming one good account of the natural his- 
tory of the country than could otherwise be well come at.
Third and Fourth Field Meetings.
â€” The third meeting of the year 
took place in a range of country extending from Haydon Bridge to 
Walltown and Haltwhistle ; a district highly interesting to the geo- 
logist and botanist, and also to the antiquary, from its possessing the 
most extensive lemains of the Roman wall now in existence.
The 
face of the country is very much broken by irregular hills of lime- 
stone or sandstone ; and at Walltown, and from thence towards the 
north, the edge of the great Whin Sill shows itself, after having been 
thrown down by the great Stublick Dyke.
In the hollows are nu- 
merous bogs or mosses, and here and there a small lake.
As might 
be expected, many of the plants peculiar to such districts ai'e found 
here in abundance, amongst them some of our rarer British species.
Several scarce species of Carex occur, especially Carex irrigua, which 
was first noticed as a British plant in this district by Mr. John 
Thompson, then of Crowhall Mill, and who has added many species 
observed in the neighbourhood alluded to, to the Northumberland 
Flora.
Amongst them may be enumerated Hieracium prenanthoides, 
and Crepis succisaefolia.
The day was remarkably fine, and the 
party, after a pleasant wander, reached Haltwhistle just in time for a 
hasty dinner, and to get home by the last train from Carlisle.
The 
959 
fourth meeting was held at Prestwick Car, near Ponteland, a space 
of flat, marshy and boggy land, about two miles across, with a consi- 
derable pool of rather shallow water, communicating with the little 
river Pont by a deep ditch, of about one-third water and the remain- 
ing two-thirds of filthy mud.
It is diflScult to account for this flat 
expanse of bog, marsh, and water.
That it has once been more ele- 
vated is evident, as the stumps of trees, blackened, as is usual in bog- 
wood, are scattered over its whole surface.
"When the lake is low, 
they may be seen in considerable numbers, just showing themselves 
above the surface of the water.
Two sorts of tree may be distin- 
guished : a species of fir, probably the common Scotch fir, as the 
wood when sliced and put under the microscope appears to belong 
to that plant.
The other tree is the common birch ; in this the 
bark is remaining, in many cases almost quite sound, whilst the 
wood is soft, or altogether gone ; thus furnishing us with the means 
of accounting for the fact, that in most of the larger fossil plants of 
our coal mines, we have the impressions of the bark only, the place 
of the wood being usually occupied by mud or sand.
How the trees 
at Prestwick Car have got into their present situation it is diflicult to 
say ; the appearance of the place, an extensive flat, like the bottom 
of a large dish, rising ground on nearly all sides forming the edge, 
would suggest the idea of subsidence of the land at this particular 
spot, more especially as the Car itself is on so low a level, that the 
waters of the Pont frequently flow into it.
As might be expected, 
numerous water and bog plants are to be met with ; for some it is 
the only convenient station near Newcastle.
In the ditches, as well 
as in the lake, Callitriche autumnalis and Chara aspera and hispida 
are abundant.
Amongst the other plants may be mentioned Ranun- 
culus Lingua, Listera cordata, CEnanthe Phellandrium, Triglochin pa- 
lustre, Alisma ranunculoides, Hippuris vulgaris, Utricularia vulgaris 
and intermedia, Carex pauciflora, Potamogeton lucens and hete- 
rophyllus, Anagallis tenella, Parnassia palustris, Nuphar lutea, Eleo- 
charis multicaulis, Andromeda polifolia, Habenaria bifolia, Gymna- 
denia conopsea, Pilularia globulifera, Lycopodium Selago and sela- 
giuoides, and most of the common North-of-England heath and bog 
plants, both cryptogamic and flowering.
Many fresh-water shells 
are found in the lake and the ditches which run into it, but they do 
not appear to be so numerous as they were found some years ago.
At one time the Car was not preserved, and water-birds were driven 
away, and the shells on which they fed were abundant, but now that 
the place is strictly preserved, the birds abound, and the shells ap- 
960 
pear to have become scarcer.
Water-birds, as might be expected, 
have resorted in great numbers to the Car since they have been less 
disturbed, and this year they appear to be more numerous than usual.
Several species also have bred in greater numbers this season than 
usual, and some have bred which had not been previously noticed at 
the Car in the breeding season.
Several broods of the redshank 
were brought out, the water crake bred there this season, and a ruff 
and reeve were seen by Mr. R.
Reay, of Berwick Hill.
Mr. John 
Hancock, by whom this information is furnished, obtained the egg of 
the redshank.
Amongst the other birds seen was a flock of about 
thirty ring-dottrels, a number unusually large to be seen together at 
Prestwick Car. The only business transacted at the meeting was the 
election of four new members, and the presentation, by Mr. J.
Han- 
cock, of a Notice of the Capture of the Thrush Nightingale [Sylvia 
Turdoides, Meyer), the largest European warbler, near the village 
of Swalwell, three or four miles west of Newcastle.
The attention 
of Mr. Thos.
Robson, of Swalwell, a gentleman perfectly acquainted 
with the notes of our different warblers, was, towards the end of last 
May, attracted to a note which he did not recognize.
After some 
trouble he succeeded in seeing, and afterwards in obtaining the bird, 
which proved to be the male of the species above named.
Although 
this was the only specimen obtained, yet, from the time of year and 
other circumstances, there is little doubt that this fine warbler is a 
regular visitant, its peculiarly retired habits having hitherto concealed 
it from observation.
Mr. Hancock has in his possession an egg ob- 
tained in Northamptonshire, which agrees exactly with the descrip- 
tion of the thrush nightingale, but from not supposing the bird to be 
a native of England, Mr. Hancock was unwilling to assign the egg 
to this species ; now, however, that the bird has been obtained here 
in the breeding season, there seems no reason to doubt that it breeds 
also in Northamptonshire.

Description of Hieracium heterophyllum, a Species new to Science.
By James Bladon, Esq.* 
Hieracium heterophyllum, Bladon's MSS.
â€” Leaves all sessile, cau- 
line, lowest lanceolate, upper ovate acuminate.
Situation.
â€” Woods, hedge-banks ; very rare in open ground.
Time of Flowering.
â€” Middle and latter end of August and Sep- 
tember.
The height of the plant varies very much, from ten or twelve inches 
to three feet and a half, or more : the fibres of the root are stout, cy- 
lindrical, not tapering, from two to six inches long; stem stout, at the 
base of the larger plants ^ of an inch in diameter, striated, very brit- 
tle, internally filled with shining, rather largely cellular pith, thickly 
clothed with slender, whitish, downy or silky hairs, intermixed with 
a few dark ones, from one to two lines in length, erect, spreading, or 
a little deflected, springing from an enlarged, oblong, glandular base, 
close to the surface of the stem a thinly scattered, arachnoid pubes- 
cence, which, being generally darkish coloured, gives a smoky appear- 
ance to patches on the plant, especially as the stem and branches 
are very apt to have one side clouded with purple.
In the branch- 
ing of the stem it very much resembles maculatum, the smaller plants 
only bearing six or eight flowers, while the larger ones have axillary 
branches down to the middle of the stem.
Leaves various, none radical, all cauline (thus in an early stage 
bearing a very difierent appearance from murorum and maculatum, 
* Read before the Botanical Society of London, .3rd September, 1847.
962 
in which species the first appearance of the plant is several radical 
leaves close to the surface of the ground, and when they are from one 
to two inches long the stem begins to spring from the centre of 
them; but in this species, when the plant is only half an inch in 
height, the leaves are distinctly seen to be attached to the stem and 
not to the crown of the root) ; the lower leaves are lanceolate, pointed 
at the apex, attenuated towards the base, so that the broadest part of 
the leaf is above the middle, from four to five inches and a half long, 
and from five to seven-eighths of an inch in breadth ; the leaves 
higher up the stem decrease a little in size, and become more regu- 
larly lanceolate ; at about the middle of the stem the leaves have their 
base ovate, and apex acuminate, in many instances attenuate-acumi- 
nate ; the ovate base is not truly clasping, the basal part of the midrib 
being enlarged, causes the leaf to bear the appearance of clasping 
the stem.
When the plant is in flower, from two to four of the lowest 
leaves are decayed ; all the leaves have a few small, scattered teeth 
on their edges, directed forwards, from half a line to a line in length, 
half an inch or more apart in the larger leaves, and about half that 
distance in the smaller ones ; the under side of the leaves, especially 
the midrib, is clothed with the same description of hairs as the stem; 
the leaves are liable to be clouded with purple around their edges, 
not so much in spots or blotches on the disk as maculatum.
It requires 
great care in gathering and handling the plant when in a fresh state, 
to prevent the downy hairs of the stem from being obliterated or 
pressed down flat on the stem, when they become felted together, 
and form a flat, woolly pubescence, which may mislead the observer 
as to its true character.
One remarkable characteristic of the pre- 
sent plant is the disposition of the leaves on the stem : at about one- 
third or one-fourth of the height of the stem firom the root it is so much 
more densely leaved than in any other part, in plants from twelve 
to twenty inches long there are as many as eight to twelve leaves 
within the space of three inches in the part alluded to, whilst proba- 
bly there are not many more than that number on all the rest of the 
stem.
In the very large specimens this is not quite so conspicuous, 
yet even in them it may be traced, the leaves being inserted about half 
an inch apart : above and below they are from one inch and a quarter 
to two inches apart.
In the middle-sized and small specimens it is 
very plain, even in plants of only two or three inches in height.
The flowers are about the size and colour of those of maculatum, not 
being so large as in murorum ; the pistils and stigmas are more promi- 
nent than in either of the above species ; the scales of the involucrum 
963 
are attenuated towards the point, with two to four inserted on the 
stem, under the flower; the peduncles and scales of the involucrum 
are densely covered with the same sort of hairs with glandular bases, 
as the stem ; the arachnoid pubescence is also more dense ; the ca- 
pitate glands so conspicuous on the flower in murorum, are very rare 
in this plant ; the bracteas are ovate-acuminate, same as the upper 
stem leaves, but narrower in proportion ; the seeds are longitudinally 
ribbed, with their down rough when fully ripe ; the scales of the in- 
volucrum are reflected close to the stem.

Note on the Viola Jlavicornis of Smith.
By Edward Forster, Esq., V.P.L.S.
In the ' Phytologist ' (Phytol.
ii.
855), in the report of the Meeting 
of the Botanical Society, on the 7th May, you say " Mr. Watson re- 
marked that small specimens of the ordinary Viola canina had been 
erroneously figured in the ' Supplement to English Botany ' for the 
Viola flavicornis of Smith, and that Mr. Babington persisted in re- 
peating the same in the second edition of his Manual (published that 
day), although he could not fail to know that the application of 
Smith's name, ' flavicornis,' to the plant of the Supplement was an 
eiTor on the part of Mr. Forster." 
Mr. Watson, in his 'Cybele Britannica,' p.
178, under "135d.
Viola flavicornis.
Smith,''' and "135 c.
Viola lactea, .SmzY/A," makes 
the following statement : " Unfortunately dwarf examples of V.
ca- 
nina, differing from the typical form in size alone, have been repeat- 
edly mistaken for Smith's V.
flavicornis ; and Mr. Forster has done 
his best to perpetuate this error, by publishing some such dwarf ex- 
amples of V.
canina, under the name of V.
flavicornis in the 'Sup- 
plement to English Botany,' plate 2376" (2736).
" And apparently 
misled by that plate, Mr. Babington has extended the error by refer- 
ring to the plate as a figure of the true V.
flavicorais of Smith, and 
likewise of his own variety ' pusilla.' He should have omitted the re- 
ference to 'Stn.,^ the plant of Smith being a different thing, and not 
agreeing with any of the varieties recorded in the Manual, though 
coming between raontana and Ruppii of that work." 
Mr. Watson has kindly furnished me with specimens, both of his 
964 
V. flavicornis and of that which he considers V.
canina, var.
pusilla.
After the best investigation I can give, I am still of the same opinion 
as when I drew up for Mr. Sowerby the letter-press, No. 2736; indeed, 
I may say, that opinion is not lessened, but strengthened by the ex- 
amination of Mr. Watson's specimens, and therefore I now boldly 
venture to assert that V.
flavicornis, E.
B., V.
canina, ^.
pusilla, Bab.
Man., 2nd ed., p.
36, is the plant intended by Smith.
The two fi- 
gures in E.
B., and the figure in Dillenius's edition of Ray's Synopsis, 
t. xxiv.
/. 1, well represent the specimen preserved in Smith's own 
herbarium.
I might have recourse to recollected conversations with 
Sir J.
E. Smith, were I not aware that such ought not to be resorted 
to when we have authentic documents to rely on.
The plant considered by Mr. Watson as V.
flavicornis appears to 
me to be one which I have long known, yet never could make up my 
mind whether to consider as a variety of V.
lactea or V.
canina, but 
as it most resembles the former, I agree with Mr. Watson in thinking 
it not unsafe to refer it to that species, as he does in 'Cybele Britan- 
nica.' It is not improbable that this may be intended by V.
canina, 
var.
montana, in the Manual, but it must be observed, that the V.
montana of Linnaeus is a very different plant, of higher growth, with 
larger, narrow leaves, never yet observed in Britain except in gar- 
dens.
V. Ruppii I have always supposed identical with V.
lactea.
Smith : scarcely a variety.
In thanking Mr. Watson for the communication of the specimens 
of the two plants, I have already stated to him privately my present 
sentiments, and I am well convinced he will think that I cannot con- 
scienciously do otherwise than give the same to the public through 
your useful periodical.

[It is perhaps as well to mention that the Reports of the Meetings 
of the Botanical Society of London are official, being kindly trans- 
mitted by the Secretary, Mr. Dennes.
We invite attention to this, 
because Mr. Forster's introductory observation would imply that 
these Reports were editorial.

Note OH Dr. Hartig's New Theorij of the Fertilization of Plants.
By William Wilson, Esq.
In this department of science it is far more easy to speculate than 
to make discoveries, and I fear that until more facts are obtained, and 
the reputed facts more thoroughly established, theories will only tend 
to mislead.
It is incumbent on me here to make a confession of er- 
ror on an important point connected with that part of Dr. Bartig's 
theory which treats of fertilization by means of the style.
I do so 
with less hesitation now that my former statements (which were nei- 
ther hastily nor carelessly made) have been confirmed by such highly 
respectable authority.
I have waited for years in full expectation 
that some one would spare me the task of self-refutation.
True it is, that the pollen-grains of Campanula do enter the hairs 
of the style, and that they are sometimes to be found [e.
g. in Cam- 
panula Rapunculus, where the hairs are of greater diameter) in con- 
siderable abundance ; but the manner in which they get there is the 
question.
During my prolonged examination (continued without 
intermission for days) I was not unaware of the danger of making 
false deductions, and I thought that I used sufficient precautions 
against them ; but after all, I am now persuaded that an error (a par- 
donable one, as I hope) must have been committed ; for I could not, 
in the following year, detect a single pollen-grain in the hairs of any 
style previous to dissection, and I had already ascertained that pol- 
len-tubes are developed in the usual mode upon the stigma of C.
Ra- 
punculus.
It is my present opinion that the pollen-grains obtain 
access to the interior of the hairs of the style precisely at the moment 
when the sections are made with the cutting instrument, and that 
they enter at the base, which then becomes open and exposed, and 
not at the apex.
Of course, I cannot join with Dr. Hartig in regarding it "as de- 
cided that fertilization takes place by means of the hairs ;" nor is it 
yet sufficiently clear to me, though it is not improbable, that the re- 
traction of the hairs (which, however, does assuredly cause a species 
of absorption of the pollen-grains into the substance of the style) is 
essentially productive of fertilization, on the part of the included pol- 
len-grains, which do not (so far as I have observed) put forth tubes 
within the usual period of fecundation, nor for a considerable time 
afterwards, if at all ; nor do they appear to be otherwise altered.

P. S.
â€” After a renewed and most gratifying examination of Cam- 
panula rotundifolia this morning, I can now testify that the stigma is 
the true channel by which fertilization is effected, I have traced the 
pollen-tubes in abundance from the stigma downwards, in unbroken 
continuity, to the distance of half an inch ; and the evidence of their 
being prolonged until they penetrate the ovule is so exceedingly 
strong that 1 now fully admit and believe the fact.
The course of 
the tubes from the base of the style is by a sudden turn from the up- 
per part of the point of junction with the placenta, passing outwards 
between two contiguous surfaces in the centre of the mass to the up- 
per part, and thence over the whole surface of the placenta, to which 
the foramen of each ovule is closely applied ; hence it is not difficult 
to delach an ovule with a tube of six times its own length still adher- 
ing to the foramen.
This T have repeatedly done.
Sometimes a 
tube appears to pass close to the foramen without entering it, or 
otherwise two tubes enter the foramen.
I cannot account for my not 
having seen this before, except through my not having dissected the 
ovarium in a sufliciently advanced state.
The tardy admission of 
one who has been so long sceptical will perhaps be thought conclu- 
sive ; but any microscopist may verify my observations with a lens 
of moderate power.
The stigma obtains its pollen by its branches 
becoming revolute, when its surface comes into direct contact with 
the pollen-grains, already profusely scattered upon the upper part of 
the style.
Thus an ingenious theory fails of one of its main supports, 
if it be not altogether refuted.

Remarks on Polygala depressa of Wenderoth.
By W.
A. Bromfield, M.D., F.L.S.
Polygala depressa.
â€” A plant exactly answering to the description 
given of P.
depressa of Wenderoth, the P.
serpyllacea of Weihe, I 
found in May, 1846, growing sparingly in bare, gravelly spots on 
Bleak Down, an elevated tract of barren heath on the road from 
Newport to Niton, in this island, and which, so far as I am aware, 
has not been noticed in England even as a variety of the common 
milkwort {P.
vulgaris, L.), in which light I was then, and still am 
disposed to regard it.
Absence abroad up to a period much too late 
967 
in the present year for renewing the search after fiesh specimens, and 
a desire to investigate the plant more completely than I had an op- 
portunity of doing so short a time before leaving this country, have 
induced me to delay sending an account of it to the ' Phy tologist ' 
till now.
Hence also, my remarks must be confined to the very few 
original examples of 1846, which were then placed in my herbarium 
under the above names for future examination ; these, however, leave 
no doubt on my mind of their perfect identity with the presumed 
species of the authors whose names have just been quoted.
I could 
wish my convictions were equally clear of the specific distinctness of 
our plant from P.
vulgaris ; the notoriously polymorphous tendencies 
of which forbid my hazarding any positive opinion on the point, and 
counsel me to adopt the safer course of assuming both to be one and 
the same thing, rather than help to burden our English catalogues 
with another of those dubious hook-species with which, unhappily for 
the interests of the science, they are so much encumbered already.* 
The characters that distinguish P.
depressa from P.
vulgaris are 
fully as satisfactory, if not more so than those which are used to se- 
parate the latter from its near allies enumerated in the subjoined 
note.
It should, however, be observed that its affinity is rather to 
P. amara than to P.
vulgaris ; the former of these is not now consi- 
dered a native of Britain, the P.
calcarea, Schultz, having been mis- 
taken for it, if, indeed, the two are not identical, as I more than sus- 
pect them to be, fi:om the slightness of the marks employed to dis- 
criminate them.
In perfect accordance with the descriptions of Koch and others, 
my specimens of P.
depressa differ from P.
vulgaris in the slenderer 
root ?
and diffuse, prostrate, almost filiform stems, which lie quite flat 
upon the ground, and spread in every direction, with irregular, wiry 
branches, which, as well as the principal stems, are for the most part 
closely beset with leaves at their base or about the middle of their 
length ; the older occasionally bare of leaves below, from the falling 
away of the latter through time.
Leaves (in my fresh specimens) 
yellowish green, leathery and shining, the lower and middle oblong- 
elliptical or obovate-elliptical, obtuse or very slightly pointed, crowd- 
* Whoever will be at the pains of comparing together specimens, plates and de- 
scriptions of P.
vulgaris, amara, comosa, austriaca and calcarea, with the innumera- 
ble variations in the size, shape and colour of the flowers and leaves of each, and the 
diversity of opinion in authors concerning them, must be sensible of the reasonable- 
ness of withholding a too ready assent to authority that would dissever forms so inti- 
mately commingled or anastomosing.

ed, opposite or alternate, mostly increasing in size as they ascend up 
to a certain point, beyond which they again diminish, and finally be- 
come longer and narrower, or elliptic-lanceolate, more remote, alter- 
nate or scattered ; racemes terminal and lateral, comparatively with 
P. vulgaris few-flowered and short; flowers small, bluish white (rarely 
deep blue, Koch) ; lateral enlarged sepals (wings) oblong-obovate, 
scarcely pointed, their lateral nervures considerably ramified and con- 
fluent towards the margin, anastomosing with the central nerve by an 
oblique branch or two of the latter, generally towards its apex.* 
Since some botanists may be disposed to regard our plant as con- 
stituting a good species, I subjoin the following diagnostic formula: â€” 
Polygala depressa.
â€” Stems depressed, filiform, branched, leafy ; 
lower leaves mostly crowded, oblong or obovate-elliptical, 
obtuse, upper leaves lanceolate, scattered ; racemes short, 
few-flowered ; flowers crested, lateral sepals (wings) oblong- 
obovate, their lateral nerves reticulate, anastomosing with an 
oblique branch of the central nerve.

differences seem wanting to its undeniable establishment as such.

Crepis seiosa and Atriplex hortensis near Saffron Walden.
By George Stacey Gibson, Esq.
It may interest some of the readers of the 'Phytologist' to know 
that Crepis setosa has again appeared abundantly in several clover 
fields in this neighbourhood, quite in a different direction to that 
where it vt'as first discovered four years ago.
It has probably been 
originally introduced with seed from abroad, but is likely to become 
established as a naturalized plant, having now been found in various 
parts of the country.
Atriplex hortensis was also found a few days ago, by my friend 
J. Clarke, on a heap of manure near the town.
It is not near any 
garden, and I am not aware that the plant is now cultivated here, but 
probably the seeds have lain dormant for some years, and have vege- 
tated on being brought to the surface.
Of course it is not likely to be 
indigenous, but having found its way into some recent British floras, 
it may be well to record a fresh station for it.
The size of the plant 
with its large and peculiar capsules render it very conspicuous.
There 
are several plants of it, but it is confined to a small space of ground.

On the occurrence of Lycopodium annotinum in Cumberland.
By H.

Believing that the plant has not previously been noticed growing 
in England, I have the pleasure of communicating the discovery of 
Lycopodium annotinura on one of the precipitous sides of Bow-Fell, 
Cumberland ; also of Silene acaulis above Grisedale Tarn, on the 
Helvellyn side.
The catkins differing somewhat from those represented in ' History 
of British Ferns,' I take the liberty of enclosing a specimen, and shall 
feel much obliged by an explanatory line when convenient.

[The occurrence of Lycopodium annotinum in England has already 
been recorded in the ' Phytologist' (Phytol.
ii.
824).
The specimens 
in that, as in the present instance, are unquestionably correctly named.
There is no other difference between the catkins on the specimen 
obligingly transmitted with the present communication and that figured 
in the ' History of British Feras,' than that arising from the diffe- 
rent stages of maturity in which the two have been gathered.
The 
figure represents the catkins mature, the specimen now received has 
them in a half-grown state.

Remarks on Centaurea nigrescens, Malva verticillata, and Euphorbia 
Peplis.
By James Motley, Esq.
Centaurea nigra, C.
nigra, B.
radiata, and C.
nigrescens.
â€” Having 
resided for several years near Aberafon, in Glamorganshire, where a 
Centaurea with radiate flowers, I believe C.
nigrescens of the second 
edition of Babington's Manual, is extremely common, and grows con- 
973 
stantly intermixed with the usual form of C.
nigra: I have had many 
opportunities of observing their habits and appearances.
I may premise 
that this supposed C.
nigrescens is very unlike a radiate C.
nigra 
which I once found in Carmarthenshire, and Mr. Borrer, to whom I 
showed my specimens last autumn, declared it not to be C.
Jacea.
It 
differs from C.
nigra in the following points : â€” 
The involucral appendages in C.
nigra are pectinate in a pinnate, 
in C.
nigrescens rather in a palmate, manner.
The leaves of C.
nigrescens are correctly described in the Manual as linear-lanceolate, 
but as far as I have seen, the lower ones are scarcely ovate, but rather 
ovate-lanceolate, sinuate dentate almost up to the flowers, while those 
of C.
nigra are often all entire, except the very lowest.
The characters 
from the pappus I fear will be found dubious, as I have now before me 
seeds of C.
nigra which would answer all the three descriptions in the 
Manual, unless indeed that character refers only to the outermost 
seeds in each head.
The difference in habit between these two plants 
is very striking; C.
nigra is for the most part an erect slender- 
stemmed plant, with rather sparse foliage ; the stem of C.
nigrescens 
is decumbent below, much shorter, thicker, and more leafy, and has 
usually several leaves nearly close together immediately below the 
flowers ; the heads, too, are larger, and I believe always radiate.
The 
specimen of C.
nigra, &.
radiata, to which I have referred, had quite 
the habit and appearance of the normal C.
nigra, not of C.
nigrescens, 
but having unfortunately been unable to preserve it when gathered, I 
cannot speak to the form of the calyx appendages.
Malva veriicillata.
â€” I must beg to correct a slight inaccuracy in 
the notice of this plant, both in the ' London Journal ' and in the 
' Phytologist,' viz., that "very few specimens have been found;" 
when I first observed it, there were many hundreds of specimens, 
scattered over three fields, though most abundant in one : it is true 
that when Mr. Borrer accompanied me to the spot last autumn, w^e 
could only procure five specimens, of which two were only seedlings, 
but it has this year appeared again in considerable abundance ; I have 
procured about one hundred specimens, besides leaving quite as many, 
being anxious that the plant should not be exterminated.
I have 
found several specimens in an old quarry adjoining the field : these 
are only an inch or two high, with solitary flowers, while some in rich 
soil in my garden were upwards of three feet, and the flowers in dense 
clusters.
I cannot believe this plant to be either a variety or the type 
of M.
crispa : with the seeds of that plant I am unacquainted, but its 
ramification is very different from that of M.
verticillata ; when the 
Vol. II.

latter does branch, which is rarely (unless injured, as in several spe- 
cimens which have been cut down with the corn), the branches are 
always spreading, and from the lowest part of the stem only, even in 
my very luxuriant garden specimens ; whereas M.
crispa has, when 
well grown, axillary ascending branches for some distance up the stem, 
and is altogether a much larger plant : to use a familiar comparison, 
M. verticillata resembles a holy-oak, M.
crispa a Lombardy poplar.
Euphorbia Peplis.
â€” In 1834, when quite a boy, I found this plant 
growing abundantly on sand-hills, at Forth Cawl, in Glamorganshire, 
accompanied by Lavatera arborea and Tamarix anglica.
In 1841 I 
sought in vain for the two former, and on my last visit to that place in 
the autumn of 1846, the Tamarix also had disappeared.

Welch Habitat for Asplenium germanicum.
By Edward Newman.
Three years have elapsed since I received an anonymous letter, 
beginning thus, "A Lady who has this season visited North Wales," 
&c., and then stating that she had found Asplenium septentrionale in 
great abundance, and also unmistakeable specimens of Asplenium 
germanicum : the locality was carefully and obligingly given with the 
view of conducting me to the spot.
As far as regards A.
septentrio- 
nale, I knew the statement to be correct, and had no reason whatever 
to doubt the more extraordinary fact of A.
germanicum having 
occurred in Wales, other than the feeling of uncertainty whether the 
nameless lady actually knew the plant which she so called.
The matter is now set at rest.
I have before me a veritable speci- 
men of Asplenium germanicum, gathered (at the very station pointed 
out by my anonymous correspondent) by Mr. H.
Wilson, and obli- 
gingly transmitted for my inspection by Mr. W.
Wilson, of Warrington.
" In August, 1838, I had the good fortune to find A.
septentrionale 
in luxuriant profusion on a wall by the road-side, going out of Llan- 
rwst, towards Conway : the station is on the left-hand, exactly op- 
posite a farm-yard, and about a mile from Llanrwst." Thus I wrote 
in 1840, and botanists, taking this direction in their hands, rushed to 
the spot, and although I should have supposed all the herbaria in 
Europe might have been supplied from that station, yet the fearful 
spirit of devastation was so strong upon them, that the plant is totally 
975 
eradicated.
I think it will not be deemed extraordinary or eccentric after 
such an instance, if T merely record that Asplenium septentrionale 
still exists near Llanrwst in very great profusion and luxuriance, in 
enormous tufts, readily to be removed from between the stones, and 
that Asplenium germanicum occurs more sparingly.
While on the subject of these Aspleniums, I may perhaps be allow- 
ed to introduce to the notice of the readers of the ' Phy tologist ' the 
following interesting note from Mr. Smyttan, of Cambridge : â€” 
" After reading to-day your remarks in your very interesting work 
on British Ferns, on Asplenium alternifolium, I have thought it might 
be interesting to you to know that I found a specimen of this very 
rare plant on Stenton Rock so lately as last summer.
After two 
hours' climbing on the bare rocks in one of the most burning days, I 
at last found the treasure in a fissure of the barest part of the rock.
I am sorry I cannot send you a part of the specimen, as it was a very 
small plant, and I gave a friend one half, the other I have in my 
small collection.
" Septentrionale grows in great abundance on this rock.

Notes on the affinity between Lysimachia nemorum (Linn.) and Ly- 
simachia azorica (Hornem.).
By Hewett C.
Watson, Esq.
Tn some remarks on certain of the specimens distributed last 
winter by the Botanical Society of London (See Phytol.
ii.
766), I al- 
luded to the close affinity between the two plants (I know not whether 
to say ' species ' or ' varieties ') above named ; in illustration of which 
some examples of the L.
azorica had been then recently distributed for 
comparison with our native L.
nemorum.
It was intimated that an 
explanation would be afterwards given in respect to the grounds for 
sending out specimens of an Azoric species in the parcels of British 
plants ; which I propose to do here.
Independently of its bearing upon the distinctions of species for the 
objects of technical description, a very near affinity, without complete 
identity, between plants of distant islands, gives rise also to questions 
of much interest in connexion with vegetable geography and physi- 
ology.
It bears intimately on the often vexed question of what is a 
976 
species and what is a variety, as distinguished or distinguishable by 
technical characters in books.
And if not true species, why do the 
specimens collected in island A invariably present some peculiarities 
by which they can be separated from those collected in island B, by 
the eye of a person familiar with them, although technical language 
may not suffice to convey those peculiarities clearly to the minds of 
others ?
Does climate gradually bring about these differences ; ope- 
rating so slowly that many years or centuries of cultivation in island 
A are required, before the posterity of plants brought from B shall 
have thus far changed ?
Have these apparently two species had dif- 
ferent origins, each under its own climatal conditions, and not been 
afterwards varied ?
But I might ask a score of unanswerable questions, 
or questions that cannot be answered under existing knowledge ; and 
I will therefore prefer to state the circumstances, and leave others to 
ask queries of themselves, and reply thereto as they best can.
When in the islands of Fayal and Flores, in 1842, I found a species 
of Lysimachia in several places, which, while it presented considerable 
resemblance to our native L.
nemorum, yet was sufficiently different 
in general appearance as to be then deemed a novel species by myself; 
and it is not often a fault with me to err on the side of "splitting" 
species.
After returning to England I ascertained that the Azoric 
Lysimachia had been figured in the ' Botanical Magazine,' n.
3273, 
imder name of Lysimachia azorica {Hornem.) ; although, as then ap- 
peared to me, rather inaccurately.
Subsequently, in 1844, a 'Flora 
Azorica' was published by Seubert; and in this latter work the Lysi- 
machia azorica was placed as a variety of the European L.
nemorum, 
on the alleged ground of its indicated characters being too inconstant 
for specific diagnosis.
Nevertheless, my own recollection of the plant, 
as seen in the Azore islands, the specimens brought thence and pre- 
served in my herbarium, and living plants raised in England from 
their seeds, all appeared to forbid this union, or " lumping," of the two 
quasi-species.
I procured roots of the wild English Lysimachia nemorum, and 
kept them in cultivation under precisely the same conditions of soil 
and shelter, as I kept the plants raised from seeds of L.
azorica col- 
lected in Fayal or Flores, and also other plants raised again from seeds 
of the latter ripened in England.
Thus grown side by side, both in 
flower-pots and in the ground, the two apparent species preserved 
sufficiently obvious differences of general habit, to prevent any chance 
of mistaking one for the other, even on a cursory glance ; and on 
closer inspection they yielded characters which would readily distin-

guish them by technical language in books.
Moreover, the Azoric 
species proved decidedly more sensitive to frost than our native plant.
Thus fortified by facts, or visible and describable distinctions, I retain- 
ed the Lysiraachia azorica as a genuine species in my own ' Catalogue 
of Azorean Plants,' published in the ' London Journal of Botany.' 
Other facts, however, have more recently come under my observa- 
tion, which throw considerable doubt on the propriety of my own 
course, while they also account for the opposite view taken up by Seu- 
bert, and explain the apparent inaccuracy of the figure in the * Botani- 
cal Magazine.' In order to render the bearing of these latter facts 
intelligible, it may be necessary first to mention the distinctions 
observed between the plants of our native L.
nemorum and those of 
my own L.
azorica, as they appeared in the cultivated examples.
Lysimachia nemorum spreads closely over the ground, with length- 
ened stems and ramifications, which acquire frequently a purple tinge 
under exposure to the sun, and fi*eely throw out young roots at their 
joints, by which they become tied to the earth, and draw fresh supplies 
of food or moisture for continuing their elongating growth.
The 
leaves are opposite, that is, very rarely in whorls of three, and I have 
never seen them in four.
The veins or nerves are impressed like 
channels on the upper surface of the leaves, which are rather acutely 
pointed, and of a darkish green colour.
The sepals are very narrow, 
linear-lanceolate or almost subulate, and very acute.
Other characters 
need not here be adverted to.
Lysimachia azorica, on the contrary, does not spread closely over 
the ground.
Its stems and ramifications are procumbent at the base 
(except while young and short, when they are nearly erect) and then 
bend upwards in an ascending direction ; throwing out few or no roots 
fi'om those joints which do lie in contact with the ground, attaining 
much less of length, and remaining usually quite pale.
The leaves 
are primarily opposite but frequently in whorls of three or four, pale 
green in colour, and obtuse ; with their veins not channelled, but 
rather prominent.
The sepals are comparatively broad, lanceolate- 
oblong or elliptic and obtuse.
It was chiefly on the characters of a 
procumbent stem and elliptic obtuse sepals that I relied for a book 
distinction between the species.
After I had been thus watching the two quasi-species under cultiva- 
tion, and comparing dried'specimens, our Consul, Mr. Hunt, sent me 
some living shrubs from the island of St. Michael's, one of the Azore 
Group on which I had not landed, but in which the specimens seen 
by Dr. Seubert, author of ' Flora Azorica,' had been collected.
The 
978 
shrubs had been dug up from native localities, and about their own 
roots came various bits of turf containing fresh roots of herbaceous 
plants destitute of leaves.
These were carefully placed in pots, and 
they produced, among other things, a plant of the Lysimachia, which 
differed much from those previously in my possession ; the differences 
bringing the Azoric species so far towards the British L.
nemorum.
The stems and branches of this example from St. Michael's were far 
longer, and more prostrate, than those of the plants raised from the 
seeds collected in Fayal ; and they soon became fixed to the ground 
by roots thrown out from their joints.
And on producing flowers, the 
sepals were found to have the narrow and acute form observed in L.
nemorum.
In short, in most respects the plant from St. Michael's 
stands as an intermediate form, or a connecting link, between the L.
nemorum of Europe and my other examples of L.
azorica from Fayal.
Mr. Hunt likewise sent dried specimens from the island of St.
Michael's ; and most of these correspond with the living plant from 
the same island, although some of them do evince a tendency to as- 
sume tlie peculiarities of the Fayal plants.
The result is, that I am no longer able to write down any technical 
character by which L.
azorica can be clearly distinguished from L.
nemorum ; and yet, whether living or dried, I can readily know one 
from the other when the examples are before me.
1 requested Mr.
Demies to send out, through the parcels from London, two specimens 
of L.
azorica, as far as the number would allow, in order to show both 
forms, that with the narrow, and that with the broad sepals.
On 
placing these by the side of L.
nemorum the recipients will see the 
difficulty of distinguishing between them by written characters, while 
they may still be unable perfectly to match the L.
azorica by any 
native examples of L.
nemorum.
It would, hovrever, be highly 
desirable to find some British or European specimens intermediate, if 
such exist, between the ordinary L.
nemorum and the St. Michael's 
form or variety of L.
azorica, so as to complete the transition from the 
Fayal form into the British.
Taking the two forms of L.
azorica together, they are distinguish- 
able from the ordinary L.
nemorum of Britain, by their less creeping 
stems ; by leaves more obtuse, usually narrower, paler in colour, more 
rigid in consistence, more numerous and closer on the stems ; by the 
sepals being rarely, if ever, quite so narrow ; by greater susceptibility 
to frost.
As yet, I have raised only the Fayal form from seed ; and 
that, as before intimated, comes true and unchanged.
When growing 
wild among other herbage, the L.
nemorum of Britain does not throw 
979 
out roots so plentifully at the joints, as is the case with it when grow- 
ing free in a garden ; but, except for this one circumstance, it is rather 
less like the Ii. azorica in its wild state ; being smaller, less leafy, and 
less rigid.
To sum up, in conclusion, we have the three forms under conside- 
ration : â€” -Jirst, the ordinary L.
nemorum of Britain, with very narrow 
sepals and creeping stems ; second, the L.
azorica of Flores and Fayal, 
distinguished by its broad sepals and procumbent stems ; third, the 
L. azorica of St. Michael's, a more robust plant than either of the other 
two, but intermediate between them in the form of its sepals and 
direction of the stem.
Are they three varieties of one single species ?
Are they three distinct species ?
Are they two species ; the L.
azorica 
comprising two well marked forms ?
It may be worthy of remark here, that several Azoric plants, to 
which I can only assign specific names as being identical with those 
of Europe, do nevertheless differ somewhat from our English represen- 
tatives of the same species as they are presumed to be.
For instance, 
Fumaria capreolata (F.
media of Borgeau's Canary plants), Raphanus 
Raphanistrum, Cakile maritima.
Reseda Luteola, Viola odorata (V.
maderensis of Lowe), Hedera Helix (the " Irish Ivy " of gardeners), 
Mentha Pulegium, Calamintha officinalis, Scrophularia Scorodonia, 
Antirrhinum Orontium, Xanthium Strumarium, Plantago lanceolata, 
Daphne Laureola, Bromus mollis, Polypodium vulgare, &c.

Viscum album.
â€” On my first examination of this plant, several 
years ago, the result was so unsatisfactory (owing to the viscous 
structure of the ovulnm, which seemed to render it impossible to trace 
the pollen-tubes to their destination) that I laid it aside as impracti- 
cable ; now, after recent and more successful attempts, my views are 
considerably altered, and I am led to consider Viscum to be peculiar- 
ly well adapted to explain the mode of the formation of the embryo.
Before I enter into details, it will be useful to refer to the vai-ious 
papers on the Lorantheae, by the late Mr. Griffith, read before the 
Linnean Society.
980 
On the subject of Viscinn, Mr. GrifRtli says "the modifications are 
two ; in the one an evident cavity exists in the ovarium, and the 
ovulum appears to be reduced to an erabryonary sac, hanging from the 
side of the base of a nipple-shaped or conical placenta ; in the other 
the ovulum is reduced to an embryonary sac, but this is erect, and has 
no such obviously distinct point of origin as in the first.
In both the 
albumen has no other proper covering than the incorporated embry- 
onary sac ; and, at least in the last, the embryo appears to be a direct 
transformation of the pollinic vesicle." 
In Santalum, and also in Osyris, " the ovulum is reduced to a 
nucleus and an embryonary sac, prolonged beyond both the apex and 
base of the nucleus ; the albumen and embryo are developed in the 
parts above the septum (in the exserted portion of the sac), the parts 
below and the nucleus remaining unchanged.
The seed has no ac- 
tual proper covering, and no other theoretical covering than the incor- 
porated upper separable parts of the embryo sac." 
In Loranthus " each ovulum appears to be reduced to an embryo- 
nary sac, the albumen is developed either partly within the sac, or 
entirely or almost entirely without it.
The embryo is a growth from 
the ends of the continuations of the pollen-tubes outside the anterior 
ends of the embryo-sacs, and is in one modification (L.
globosus) up 
to a certain period exterior even to the albumen.
In L.
bicolor the 
albumen has no proper tegument; in L.
globosus it may be supposed 
to have a partial one in the incorporated albuminous part of the em- 
bryo-sac." 
In his summary of the novel points of structure, &c., indicated in 
his paper, he mentions {inter alia) 1st.
The longitudinal percursion 
of the embryo-sac by the pollen-tubes.
2nd.
The formation of the 
albumen either only partially within the embryo-sac, or almost entire- 
ly, if not quite so, without it.
3rd.
The confluence of the albumina 
of several sacks into one albumen.
4th.
The growth of the embryo- 
nic tissues from the continuations of the pollen-tubes outside the em- 
bryo-sac.
5th.
The possibility of one embryo-sac resulting from a 
combination of several pollen-tubes, and of its becoming anterior to 
the albumen, although it may have been for some time entirely exte- 
rior to it.
Now, it seems impossible to reconcile, in the same example, the 
first point with the fourth (which indeed appears to have been re- 
tracted as an error in the note of November 19, 1844) ; indeed, the 
general tendency of Mr. Griflith's remarks (if we except his fifth point) 
is to create the impression that he considered the embryo-sac to be 
981 
entirely distinct from the pollen-tube, and as forming an integral part 
of the ovulum previous to fecundation ; all other parts being sup- 
pressed in Loranthus and in some species of Viscum.
As 1 have not 
had the opportunity of examining any of the allied genera to which 
he refers, I must confine myself to Viscum, concerning which ray 
own observations lead me to doubt whether the embryo-sac, properly 
so called, has any existence in the ovulum previous to fecundation.
The second modification of Viscum specified by Mr. GriflSth is that 
of Viscum album, which, in his view, has the ovulum reduced to an 
embryonary sac ; and if we consider it in connexion with the third 
point (" the confluence of the albumina of several sacs into one albu- 
men "), there arises a confusion of terms not very easy to be explain- 
ed.
Did Mr. Griflith suppose that in those cases where the seed 
contained more than one embryo there were originally the same num- 
ber of " embryo-sacs," combined into one ovule previous to fecunda- 
tion ?
or had he obtained a glimpse of those facts which I am about 
to state, but which his multifarious pursuits prevented him from dis- 
tinctly perceiving ?
He appears to have attached much importance 
to the existence of the embryo-sac in the ovulum previous to fecun- 
dation ; for, in his concluding note of November, 1844, he states that 
Osyris and Santalum have alike furnished evidence to prove "the 
non-existence of any cell or body of or in the embryo- sac, from which 
the embryo is derived, independent of the pollen-tube." His ap- 
pended remark, that " the vesicle from which the embryo is to be de- 
rived does not appear to exist before the application of the pollen- 
tubes to the sac, it being in fact, so far as my means of observation 
enable me to go, the anterior extremity of the pollen-tube itself," 
tends to show that he had not obtained full demonstration on the 
main point of the inquiry, and on this point I trust that my own re- 
searches will now throw some further light.
It is well known that the seed of Viscum album usually contains 
two, and sometimes three embryos, and yet the ovulum consists of a 
single cavity.
I consider that this is very improperly termed an em- 
bryo-sac ; for, as such, it presents the strange anomaly of being ex- 
ternal to the albumen, and also of receiving within it a plurality of 
embryos.
At the very bottom of this cavity I find, some time after 
fecundation (July 1, 1847), the three fusiform bodies represented at 
fig.
8, their attenuated bases terminating in a single cellule, and not 
more firmly fixed to the base of the ovule than is the seta of any spe- 
cies of moss within the vaginula.
In two instances I observed what 
seemed to be portions of pollen-tubes, continuous with the apex ; 
Vol. II.

but this is a point which I am compelled to leave for future inquiry, 
having commenced my examination this year and in 1845 too late in 
the season.
It seems highly probable that the pollen-tubes penetrate 
to the bottom of the ovule, and that their extremities become trans- 
formed into these fusiform bodies, and if so, it follows that neither 
the albumen nor the embryo-sac, properly so called, has any exis- 
tence in the ovule until fecundation has been effected.
I consider 
these fusiform bodies lo be each a rudimentary mass of albumen, con- 
taining near its apex the true embryo-sac, with its included embryo- 
nary vesicle, as is evidently shown by their appearance at a subse- 
quent stage (August 23).
They are at this period enlarged, as 
represented at fig.
lie, and not unfrequently one of the three is abor- 
tive.
Such as ai'e fertile now coalesce to form one body of albumen, 
which as yet only partially fills the cavity of the enlarged ovule, and 
the embryos (fig.
11^) are still only half developed, with faint traces 
of cotyledons.
At this period the viscous sarcocarp of the seed may 
be seen radiating in numerous faintly spiral threads, issuing from the 
surface of the veiny innermost integument of the future seed.
The introduction of pollen-tubes is a fact of too much importance 
to be admitted on any but the most incontrovertible evidence; though 
it will materially tend to remove doubt if the tubes can be traced, in 
this plant, even into the style ; for the tissue of the stigma is more 
dense than that of the style, and lower down the cellules are so loose 
as to present no barrier to the progress of the tubes to the very base 
of the ovule (a distance of less than the twelfth part of an inch) ; but 
as yet I have not witnessed any penetration whatever below the sur- 
face of the stigma.
It will be interesting to ascertain why the num- 
ber of pollen-tubes admitted into each ovule is restricted to three.
The union of two or more embryos in one seed seems to be a provi- 
sion to secure the propagation of a plant, which being dioecious might 
otherwise become extinct.
The fusiform bodies are evidently not 
separate ovules; for their attenuated bases have no resemblance in 
structure to funiculi, and have no vascular tissue ; indeed, their con- 
nexion with any supposed placenta, except by mere contact of a cel- 
lule, is altogether problematical.
In Viscum album the ovule appears to be naked, as in Juniperus, 
and to consist of only one distinct membrane (the embryo-sac of Grif- 
fith), which afterwards becomes the veiny inner coat of the seed ; but 
if the sarcocarp exists ah initio, it may be regarded as the primine, 
the veiny integument as the secundine, and the loose cellular tissue 
within it (which also serves the purpose of conducting stigmatic tissue, 
083 
and is certainly a continuation of the style) is analogous to the 
nucleus.
Fig. 1 represents a longitudinal section of the three flowers 
at the summit of a branch, ten tiroes magnified (May 13, 1845).
The 
section is taken at right angles to the direction of the pair of leaves 
below the flowers: a, stigma; h, one of the deciduous petals; c, portions 
of the diphyllous calyx of the central flower.
Fig. 2 represents 
another section of the central flower (in the direction of the leaves), 
the petals having fallen away: a, stigma; c, calyx.
The apparent 
central cavity of the ovule is exhibited somewhat larger than the 
reality, and it appears in the dried section now before me as a mem- 
branous sac within the nucleus, and may be what is usually con- 
sidered as an embryo-sac ; doubtless it is into this cavity that the 
pollen-tubes, if at all, are introduced.
The two pale curved lines like 
lateral cavities may be the primine or future sarcocarp, not further dis- 
tinguishable at this stage.
The lower part of this figure shows the 
base of the leaf with an unexpanded leaf-bud in the axis.
Fig. 3 is 
a transverse section of the central flowei', the lateral ones (whose po- 
sition is at m, m) having been removed ; the outer broad ring repre- 
sents the calyx, which forms no part of the ripe fruit, and is found 
unchanged at its base.
Fig. 4 is a longitudinal section, ten times magnified, of an advanced 
central ovule (July 9, 1845) in the direction of the leaves, showing 
the sarcocarp, d, and the veiny integument, e, within which is the 
nucleus, and, at the base, one of the three fusiform bodies from which 
the albumen and embryo are developed.
Fig. 5 is a transverse sec- 
tion of a similar ovule, and fig.
6 a longitudinal section at right angles 
to the pair of leaves, showing the three fusiform bodies about to coa- 
lesce into one mass of albumen, the tapering bases being at this stage 
obliterated, as is seen at fig.
7, where three dark spots at the top in- 
dicate the position of the first traces of the embryos.
Fig. 8 shows the fusiform bodies at an earlier stage (July 1, 1847) 
in their original position, forty times magnified.
Fig. 9, one of the 
three, 240 times magnified, with traces of a surrounding membrane at 
the apex: the base of this is mutilated.
Fig. 10 shows the unbroken 
bases of the other two, equally magnified.
Fig. 11 represents the longitudial section, ten times magnified, of 
an unripe firuit (August 23, 1847) ; d, sarcocarp ; e, veiny integument; 
/, mass of albumen; g, one of two embryos, the third being absent by 
abortion.
Fig. 12, albumen with the embryos, which are seen de- 
tached at fig.
13.
All these figures are from actual dissections.
The results obtained appear to me to be the most interesting of any 
984 
985 
986 
which have arisen from these researches.
A renewed examination of 
the flower at the proper season (April) may be expected to furnish 
more precise information, now that the economy of the plant is un- 
derstood, than when the early part of this memoir was prepared.

Notice of a ' Handbook of Field Botany, comprising the Flowering 
Plants and Ferns indigenous to the British Isles.
By AVm.
E. Steele, A.B,, M.B., Trinity College, Dublin, Licentiate of 
the King's and Queen's College of Physicians ; Corresponding 
Member of the Botanical Society of London ; Lecturer on Bo- 
tany in the Richmond Hospital School of Medicine and Sur- 
gery.' Dublin: M'Glashan, 1847.
We can scarcely imagine that the most remote probability of suc- 
cess attends the publication of a descriptive list of British plants in 
opposition to the established works of Hooker and Babington ; but 
we have no wish on this account to prejudice the work before us, and 
therefore request the reader's attention to the author's own introduc- 
tion.
" In preparing the following pages for publication, I have been de- 
sirous to supply the student with a guide to the floral productions of 
the British Isles, which, according to the principles of the natural 
system, should embrace all that might be found necessary to enable 
him to identify species with ease and certainty.
" The present advanced and advancing state of botanical science in 
these countries renders it unnecessary for me to defend the adoption 
of the system of natural orders, as the basis of a work like the present, 
in preference to that of Linnaeus ; the public voice has now decided 
this question ; so that the advocate for the Linnsean system, in place 
of being an eifective assailant, is now compelled to act on the defence.
" The very simple and superficial nature of the inquiries necessary 
to be instituted in assigning to any plant its class and order in the 
system of the great Swede, is the chief, if not the only, reason that 
can be urged to justify the continued use of that arrangement.
It 
must be borne in mind, however, that the investigation does not end 
with this ; for in order to determine the genus of which the plant is a 
species in the heterogeneous assemblage thus brought together, other 
and frequently most minute points of structure must be inquired into, 
surrounding this phase of the investigation with considerable diflicul- 
ties.
In the natural system these difficulties are merely transferred 
to the determination of the natural order ; but this once accomplished, 
that of the genus is comparatively simple.
So far, then, it is appa- 
rent that the difficulties in the application of either system, to the 
determination of genera, are nearly balanced.
If, however, we can 
simplify the investigation by which we can assign a plant to its natu- 
ral order, then the onlv nlea against the condemnation of that of 
988 
Linnaeus is removed, and we are justified in venerating it, merely as 
the beautiful structure of a past age, but which is altogether unsuited 
to the requirements of a more enlightened generation.
"It is, however, by junior students that the diflBculties which op- 
pose the application of a Flora, to the practical pursuit of botany, 
constructed on a system so diffuse as that of Natural Orders are 
chiefly felt ; and hence, in the endeavour to render that system avail- 
able to young botanists, it is necessary not only to arrange the orders 
in a clear and judicious method, but to make that arrangement de- 
pendent not on those strictly essential characters which are frequently 
so minute as to require the aid of the dissecting-knife and microscope 
to investigate, but on others more easily determined, yet of a less or- 
dinal value.
In the present work I have attempted to carry out these 
views, and have therefore given analytical tables of the orders, ge- 
nera and species, constructed on characters so practical, as, I have 
reason to believe, may lead even the most inexperienced to the iden- 
tification of any plant.
Many botanists, from early associations and 
long habit, prefer employing the Linnaean arrangement ; for these an 
analysis of the genera according to that system is also prepared, 
" The method of using this book is, therefore, as follows : an un- 
known plant is submitted to examination ; it is first tested by the 
characters given in the analytical table of the natural orders, in order 
to discover to which of them it belongs.
That found, the student is 
to turn to the page indicated by the number affixed to the ordinal 
name ; he there finds the order, with its description, â€” the essential 
or diagnostic characters, taken in connexion with the heading of the 
page, being printed in italics â€” and with which he finds the plant 
under examination to agree.
That natural order embraces an assem- 
blage of genera, arranged in a table similar to that of the natural 
orders ; and by a like process, the genus to which the plant is refer- 
rible is determined, the accuracy of which may be verified by com- 
paring it with the generic description immediately preceding the 
arrangement of the species.
In a similar manner, the specific deno- 
mination is discovered, observing, however, that respecting the spe- 
cies their analyses and descriptions are incorporated.
If, in the 
course of the examination, the meaning of a word is required, the 
student is referred to the glossary ; and should the case need it, he 
may find the form illustrated by a figure in the frontispiece.
" Having now obtained the specific and generic name of the plant, 
to which order, division, sub-class, and class the plant belongs, on 
looking at the symbols under the name of the species, he learns its 
989 
duration, time of flowering, colour, in which of the three kingdoms 
alone the plant has been discovered, if it have not been found in all, 
or if it be exclusively a native of the Isles of Jersey, Guernsey, &c., as 
indicated by the letter C.
; and finally, by the last figure on the right 
hand, whether it be a plant of rare or frequent occurrence." â€” Intro- 
duction, iii.
The analytical method of determining the station and name of an 
unknown plant, originated, as our readers are probably aware, with the 
great French naturalist, Lamarck ; and with various modifications has 
since been successfully employed by De Candolle, Hooker, Lindley, 
and other botanists both in this country and on the continent.
It has 
especially been applied to British plants by Dr. Lindley* and by Mr.
Ralfs.f Thus it is evident that the idea of the analytical method did 
not originate with our author, who does not indeed lay claim to it, 
neither does he acknowledge the labours of predecessors in this par- 
ticular mode of investigation.
Analytical tables of this description, if 
properly prepared and carefully used, are of the greatest use even to 
the practised botanist; on the other hand, as Dr. Lindley has well 
observed, this method "is of all the very worst if used injudiciously:" 
for " one false step, either on the part of the author who frames it, or 
on that of the reader, instantly leads astray, and induces errors of the 
most serious kind." The truth of these remarks we have frequently 
had occasion to notice, while superintending the studies of others.
Several cases of oversight occur in Mr. Steele's analytical table of 
orders, which would not a little puzzle the tyro : among others may 
be mentioned his calling the Plantagineap " Water plants," and Halo- 
rageae " Land plants." Now, so far as the British Flora is concerned, 
the species of Halorageous genera (Myriophyllura and Hippuris) are 
eminently water plants ; and Littorella, the only British genus of the 
PlantaginaCeae which can be said to contain water plants, does so acci- 
dentally rather than normally, since its only species, though located 
on the margins of pools and lakes, and in other localities liable to be 
inundated, where it will grow luxuriantly even when covered with 
water, yet it never flowers until the retiring of the water has left it ex- 
posed to the influence of the atmosphere.
Then again with regard to the Dioscoriacese and the Trilliacese, the 
calyx of the former is said to be " petaloid," and the petals of the 
latter " brightly coloured ; " a tyro would scarcely refer Tamus, with 
its inconspicuous herbaceous perianth, to the former, nor Paris, with 
* Synopsis of the British Flora.

990 
its green herbaceous petals, to the latter ; notwithstanding the conspi- 
cuous coloured petals of the exotic genus, Trillium, belonging to the 
same order.
And this leads to some remarks upon the author's notions 
of a natural system as set forth in this volume.
Entertaining the idea " that the principles of vegetable transforma- 
tion or morphology might be made available in the formation of the 
higher divisions of flowering plants," he thus proceeds to explain his 
views as to the applicability of this doctrine to the arrangement of 
plants in a natural manner.
" To effect these metamorphoses, it is apparent that some special 
vital forces are called into action; and we are justified in the infe- 
rence, that those flowers which exhibit the most extensive departures 
from the original tyj)e, as the result of a more intense action of those 
forces, ought to be regarded as possessing a higher structural nature 
than those wherein the primitive model may be more evidently traced.
It is manifest then, that the most simple metamorphosis the leaves 
undergo is in the production of flowers, all the parts of which most 
nearly resemble the former in being distinct from one another ; and 
that when these separate parts appear in a new condition, by their 
cohering more or less intimately with each other, a more complete 
alteration is effected.
Therefore it is, I conceive, that flowers whose 
parts thus cohere, are to be considei'ed as possessing a more exalted 
structure than those in which the several floral whorls and the mem- 
bers of each are distinct.
" In the construction of a system for the arrangement of flowering 
plants according to these views, the following principle may be 
enunciated : â€” That plants whose Jlowers exhibit their several parts in 
a state of separation, are to be placed in a loiver position than those 
in ivhich their several parts are in a state of cohesion ; and on this 
principle, the table of natural orders immediately preceding the 
descriptions is constructed." â€” p.
vi.
In carrying out these views the author first divides the Exogens into 
three groups â€” Diclinous, Hypogynous and Perigynous; thus appa- 
rently suppressing the epigynous orders, though in reality merging 
the perigyns of other botanists in the hypogynous orders, and giving 
the name of perigynous to the epigyns proper.
To this arrangement 
we cannot subscribe.
We are of opinion that no mode of division can 
be more natural than that applied to the Exogens by Lindley in his 
' Vegetable Kingdom,' where they are primarily broken up into two 
groups, the one diclinous, in which the flowers are absolutely unisex- 
ual ; and the other hermaphrodite, or possessing both stamens and 
991 
pistils in the same flower.
Of these two primary groups, the Diclines 
are undivided ; to this we shall have occasion to allude again pre- 
sently : the hermaphrodite group being broken up into three sub- 
classes, hypogynous, perigynous, and epigynous.
Curiously enough, 
this arrangement affords additional support to that applied by Mr.
Newman to the animal kingdom, which he claims to be considered as 
the System of Nature, and to which allusion has before been made in 
our pages (Phytol.
ii.
711).
In every mode of arrangement claiming 
to be natural, the same principles must be applicable to all the king- 
doms of nature â€” to plants as well as animals : and Professor Lindley 
has unconsciously afforded the means of testing the system as applied 
by Mr. Newman to the latter, by his most matured plan for arranging 
the former.
In the first place, according to the principles of the System above 
alluded to â€” Every natural group should divide obviously into /our.
This condition is well fulfilled by the class of Exogens as now divided 
in accordance with certain peculiarities connected with the organs of 
reproduction.
These four groups are : â€” 
1. Diclinous, including those plants in which the flowers are typi- 
cally unisexual, without any customary tendency to hermaphro- 
ditism.
2. Hypogynous, including such plants as have the stamens entirely 
free from both calyx and corolla ; the flowers being typically 
hermaphrodite and the ovary free.
3. Perigynous, in which the stamens are adherent to either the calyx 
or corolla, and the flowers typically hermaphrodite, with the 
ovary free or nearly so.
4. Epigynous, with the stamens, floral envelopes and ovary com- 
bined, the latter being inferior or adherent in consequence, and 
the flowers typically hermaphrodite.
Thus is the first condition fulfilled by the Exogens ; the second re- 
quires that One of these four groups shall contain representatives of 
the other three.
The first, or diclinous subclass of the Exogens 
meets this demand ; for, as Lindley says, " It would be possible to 
break up the diclinous alliances into Hypogynous, Perigynous, and 
Epigynous clusters." This might indeed be readily effected, although 
it would not be possible to retain the alliances intact as they now 
stand, since some of them include plants belonging to each of the 
minor divisions â€” they must consequently be "broken up." It would 
occupy too much of our space to show at present how this may be 
effected ; we can only intimate the possibility of doing it.
992 
In addition to the three groups thus indicated, there is however a 
fourth, superior to all the others, and whose limits " are in no degree 
invaded." This group seems to consist of the single alliance Quer- 
nales.
Its truly diclinous flowers, its seeds composed of a large 
amygdaloid embryo without albumen, as well as the peculiar venation 
of the foliage, afford genuine marks of recognition and keep it distinct 
from all the groups to which it is most nearly allied.
In it, the per- 
fection of exogenous structure is undeniably most perfectly dis- 
played.
The exalbuminous seeds with their very large embryo are 
indicative of a power of independent self support, well bonie out by 
the prolonged existence of the long-enduring oaks, which are its typi- 
cal members.
This, then, is the group which, from its superiority, its entirety, and 
its peculiarities, is entitled to hold the central place in the System of 
Nature as applied to the vegetable kingdom, in the same way as the 
Primates do among animals.
The Quernales being placed in the 
centre, the hypogynous, perigynous and epigynous Diclines natural- 
ly range themselves around them, and as naturally lead to the typical 
hypogynous, perigynous and epigynous Exogens, and these in their 
turn to the external groups by transitions which at some future time 
we shall endeavour to illustrate ; but for the present we must content 
ourselves with merely sketching a faint outline of what we conceive 
to be a natural mode of grouping plants, and proceed at once to men- 
tion the dichotomous divisions of the three last-named groups.
Externally to the Primates among animals, which, as we have just 
said, are represented by the Diclines among plants, we find three 
groups of Mammalia comprising the remainder of the placental ani- 
mals.
Two of these are in themselves double or dichotomous, and 
the third consists of two equivalent groups ; thus fulfilling another 
condition, which requires that while the central group shall be entire 
and incapable of equal dichotomous division, the other three groups 
shall either he obviously double or dichotomous, or else made up oj 
tivo corresponding equivalent groups.
Now, the hypogynous, perigy- 
nous and epigynous groups are each capable of being dichotomously 
divided into two minor groups, analogous to the Cheiroptera and 
Glires, the Bruta and Belluae, and the Cete and Ferse of the placental 
animals.
Thus, one of the minor groups of hypogyns would in- 
clude such plants as make up the Malval and Sapindal alliances, as 
examples of the other may be mentioned the Berberal alliance ; in 
perigyns, one division would include the Gentianals, Solanals, Rosals, 
&c., the other the Rhamnals, Daphnals, &c.
; and in the epigyns, one 
993 
group would include the Asarals and their allies, and the other the 
Umbellals, &c.
Beyond these lie three other double groups, which, while they are 
esseniiaUy exogenous in their structure, yet do they exhibit such mo- 
difications and peculiarities as warrant us in viewing them in the light 
of transition or connecting links between the Exogens proper and the 
outermost groups of the system.
These transition groups are : â€” 
1. DictyogenSj divisible into two groups ; one containing the Dios- 
coriacese, the other the Tiilliaceae, with their allied plants 
respectively.
This group is analogous, in position at least, to 
that formed by the marsupials and birds combined.
2. Gymnogens, divisible into acrogenous and exogenous, the former 
including the Cycadaceae, the latter the Taxaceae, and collec- 
tively analogous to the double group of reptiles.
3. Rhizogens, divisible into mycelious and thallous, the former in- 
cluding RaiSlesiaceae, the latter Balanophoraceae, and collectively 
analogous to the double group of fishes.
With these three groups, Dictyogens, Gymnogens, and Rhizogens, 
the exogenous orders terminate ; in the same way as the Vertebrata 
are completed by the birds, reptiles and fishes.
Beyond the Dictyogens, and connected by them with the Exogens 
proper, is the double group of Endogens, divisible into complete and 
incomplete, the former including the Palmals, as exhibiting the per- 
fection of exogenous structure, and the latter the Glumals : thus, in its 
twofold composition being analogous to the Articulata of the animal 
kingdom, divided into the Pterota and Aptera.
Beyond the Gymnogens, which connect them with the Exogens 
proper, lies the double group of Acrogens, divisible into those with 
distinct spiral vessels, including the Filices, and those in which spiral 
vessels are less distinct, or altogether absent, including the Musci, 
Equiseta, &c.
This group is analogous to the MoUusca among ani- 
mals, divided into Vermes annelida and Vermes mollusca.
Beyond the Rhizogens, by which they are connected with the Ex- 
ogens proper, is the double group of Thallogens, divisible into the 
mycelious and thallous, the former including the Fungals, the latter the 
Lichenals and Algals.
This group is analogous to the Radiata, 
divided into the Radiata echinodermata and Radiata zoophyta.
And it is at this point that the animal and vegetable kingdoms may 
be said to coalesce, by means of those anomalous beings with respect 
to whose position in either kingdoms naturalists are as yet by no 
means agreed.
994 
The above imperfect attempt to establish a correspondence between 
the groupings of the two kingdoms, claims no merit on the ground of 
originality ; its materials are drawn from a work of which British bo- 
tanists may well be proud, and the idea of arrangement is borrowed 
from Mr. Newman's ' System of Nature.' The unforced coincidences 
between the two kingdoms, are, to say the least, most curious, and can 
scarcely be the effect of chance ; but the idea requires to be more 
elaborately worked out in its minor details, before the proposed 
arrangement can be placed upon a firm footing.
This elaboration, 
even should it prove the fallacy of the idea, will doubtless amply re- 
ward the inquirer by the discovery of numerous unexpected affinities 
and hidden combinations which will prove of value in future investi- 
gations.
This digression has led us far away from the professed object of our 
notice, and from another particular connected therewith, to wit, Mr.
Steele's division of his perigynous and hypogynous Exogens into what 
he terms Synpetalae and Apopetalse ; the former comprising the mono- 
petalous plants of other botanists, the latter both the polypetalous and 
apetalous.
In accordance with the principle quoted at p.
990, he 
assigns to the Synpetalaj a higher position than the ApopetalaB ; but 
this is opposed to the views of the soundest botanists, by whom a plant 
is justly considered to be so much the more elevated in the order of 
development, in proportion as it exhibits fewer suppressions and com- 
binations of parts, and more numerous multiplications : and further, 
in the words of Dr. Lindley, " Whatever points of structure are variable 
in the same species, or in species nearly allied to each other, or in 
neighbouring genera, are unessential to the vital functions, and should 
be set aside, or be regarded as of comparative unimportance.
Hence 
the badness of the Monopetalous, Polypetalous, and Apetalous divi- 
sions of Jussieu, depending upon the mere presence or absence, and 
union or disunion, of petals.
The genus Fuchsia, for example, has 
petals highly developed ; but in F.
excorticata they are absent, and 
yet the plant differs no otherwise from the rest of the genus : the same 
is true of species of Rhamnus.
Again, the rue has the petals se- 
parate ; and Correa, very nearly allied to it, has them combined." â€”

Remarks on the Radiant-Jlowered Variety of Centaurea nigra or 
" C.
nigrescens.'''' By Edwin Lees, Esq., F.L.S.
Mr. Roby, a gentleman known in the literary world as the author 
of ' Traditions of Lancashire,' and several volumes of Travels, and 
who adds botany to his varied accomplishments, has been staying at 
Malvern this summer, and took the opportunity of running over and 
examining the localities of the plants recorded in my ' Malvern Bo- 
tany.' This he has done in the best spirit of his kindly nature, and 
it is a pleasure to be thus " revised and corrected." Having called 
my attention to a radiant-flowered Centaurea, which he considered as 
C. Jacea, and on which Mr. Newman, in a late number of the ' Phy- 
tologist' (Phytol.
ii.
924), has, I see, suggested some queries for more 
certain decision ; perhaps on my own ground I may, without pre- 
sumption, offer an opinion.
The specimens in question grow on a grass plot at Great Malvern, 
near the chalybeate pool, in great profusion and luxuriance, inter- 
mixed with the undoubted C.
nigra.
Having gathered a sufficient 
number, I give the result of my examination.
Whatever the conti- 
nental C.
Jacea may be, the question here only concerns, I appre- 
hend, the plant so called by Sir J.
E. Smith.
On reference to the 
fountain-head in this respect, the plant of Eng. Bot.
t. 1678, it is evi- 
dent that if that plate is implicitly to be depended on, the Malvern 
plant at all events is not C.
Jacea of Smith.
In that plate C.
Jacea 
is represented with few calyx scales, all torn or only toothed, not ci- 
liated ; while in C.
nigra, and in our radiant-flowered form, they are 
numerous, all the lower ones ciliated, the upper only torn.
This, if 
proved constant, appears to be a good distinction, and indeed Smith 
relies entirely upon it, thus remarking, in E.
B., under C.
Jacea, "Mr.
Borrer's specimens agree precisely with the Swedish ones of Linnaeus, 
and differ from C.
nigra in having much narrower and sharper leaves 
(the radical ones being toothed and sometimes laciniated) and radiant 
flowers; more especially in the calyx-leaves being pale brown, mem- 
branous and shining ; the uppermost rounded at the top and almost 
entire ; the rest with a thin, whitish, jagged, pinnatifid margin, totally 
different from the black fringed scales of C.
nigra." Again, in E.
B., 
under C.
nigra, he says, " The true Linnaean C.
Jacea, found in Swe- 
den, is essentially different in having the calyx-scales much paler, 
membranous, laciniated, but not ciliated, and the flowers radiated." 
It is also stated with respect to C.
Jacea by other b'otanists, that there 
is no pappus to the seed ; but as it is also stated by Smith vvith re- 
996 
gard to C.
nigra, " seed without any down ;" and C.
nigvescens is also 
said by Babington to have the " pappus ahnost wanting," it would 
seem that no reliance can be placed upon this character.
The Mal- 
vern plants, radiant and non-radiant, appear all to have a very short 
but in many instances scarcely perceivable seed- down.
However, 
looking to the calyx of Smith's plant, as our specimens are quite dif- 
ferent in that respect, until further is known on that point, so insisted 
upon by Smith, they cannot be properly considered as C.
Jacea.
The question would now be limited to C.
nigra and nigrescens, 
if it can be truly understood what the latter is; but on the closest 
examination of Babington and other writers, I find nothing is pro- 
duced that will stand the test of examination, but the flowers being 
radiant in nigrescens, and all hermaphrodite in nigra.
" Flowers 
without a radius," says Smith, as a part of the specific character of 
nigra in E.
B. ; but then in the Eng. Flora he says, " Ray describes a 
double variety shown him by Thomas Willisel, in which the proper 
florets of the disk were all changed to handsome radiant ones." Now 
in what respect was this plant different from the modern C.
nigres- 
cens ?
I find in the 'Flora Gallica' of Loiseleur Deslongchamps (1828), 
the following attempt to discriminate the three alleged species of 
Centaurea now under review.
" C.
Jacea.
â€” C.
caule erecto ramoso angulato, foliis lanceolato-ob- 
longis, radicalibus subdentatis, squamis involucri interioribus scario- 
sis, exterioribus apice serrato-ciliatis, pappo nullo, seminibus margine 
brevissimo coronatis.
"/3.
foliis lanceolato-oblongis integerrimis.
" y.
foliis lanceolato-linearibus, inferioribus sinuato-dentatis.
^^ C.
nigra.
â€” C.
caule erecto ramoso angulato, foliis lanceolatis 
dentatis, squamis involucri scariosis apice serrato-ciliatis, flosculis 
omnibus sequalibus hermaphroditis, seminibus pappo piloso brevissi- 
mo-coronatis.
" C.
nigrescens.
â€” C.
foliis radicalibus obsolete pinnatifidis, inferio- 
ribus basi subdentatis, superioribus indivisis integerrimis, involucris 
ciliatis, squamulis intimis scariosis." 
It must be admitted here that although there is a varied display of 
words, nothing palpable appears worthy of discrimination, except 
the " pappo nullo " of C.
Jacea, and the " flosculis omnibus aequali- 
bus hermaphroditis" of C.
nigra.
Now if, as shown by Ray, and ad- 
mitted by modern botanists, the florets of C.
nigra are not always 
hermaphrodite, what difference remains to distinguish nigrescens 
997 
from nigi'a ?
There would really appear to be none.
We see in the 
above citation the terms of description of the calyx-scales are only 
slightly varied, and in fact I cannot discover in the Malvern radiated 
and non-radiated plants any difference whatever in the ciliation of 
the scales ; all the lower ones are ciliated, the upper ones more or 
less torn.
Attention is indeed called under nigrescens more particu- 
larly to the foliage, and it would thus appear by leaving out any no- 
tice of radical leaves under C.
nigra, as if nigrescens had a pecu- 
liarity in having its radical leaves obsoletely pinnatifid, its middle 
ones only subdentate, and its upper ones entire.
But this is a mere 
delusion ; for the very same thing is observable in the true herma- 
phrodite nigra, of which Smith remarks in Eng. Flora, " Lower leaves 
somewhat lyrate, partly stalked, finely toothed, upper sessile, either 
partly toothed near the base, or quite entire." So under C.
Jacea 
the French author denotes a variety with radical leaves sinuato-den- 
tate.
In fact, on collecting a series of radical leaves from both the 
radiant and non-radiant plants at Malvern, I found it impossible to 
draw up any satisfactory description that would without exception 
apply to either of them as different from the other.
The radiant seemed 
in general to have the broader leaves with less elongated foot-stalks, 
but then in other specimens they would be quite as narrow as those 
of C.
nigra, and a deeply cut or sinuato-dentate leaf would appear 
close beside an ovate and only subdentate one.
The middle leaves, 
however, I found in both to be most frequently pinnatifid, and the 
upper ones ahvays narrow, entire and sessile ; none even in nigra so 
broad as shown in Eng. Bot.
t. 278.
With regard to the alleged 
darker aspect of the foliage in C.
nigra I must confess that I could in 
this respect perceive very little difference between the radiant and 
non-radiant forms, though the specious and elegant external florets 
of the former gave quite a garden aspect to its flowers, which was of 
course not the case with the dense, compact heads of nigra; but there 
was no difference whatever in the colour of the scales.
I think, then, that while the character of the scales of the calyx in 
C. Jacea, and their permanency of aspect requires to be looked into 
from an examinaiion of Sussex and continental specimens ; that C.
nigrescens has no character sufficiently important to separate it from 
nigra, and that it must stand as a variety of that species, while pro- 
bably the &.
of nigra with radiant flowers is in reality the same 
thing.
I must state, in conclusion, however, that I have never found a ra-

Fritillaria Meleagris and Lotus angustissimus in Hampshire.
By William A.
Bromfield, M.D., F.L.S.
The former of these additions to the Flora of this county was im- 
parted to me through Miss Louisa Minchin, as growing plentifully in 
a moist meadow adjoining the Winchester road, just before entering 
Bishop's Walthara, where it has been known for many years past, in- 
gress being now I understand denied by the owner, Mr. Jonas, in 
consequence of the injury done to the land by persons digging up 
the bulbs for transplanting into their gardens, and from a laudable 
desire to preserve the plant from extirpation.
Tlie Fritillaria grows 
also in a similar meadow near the river at Droxford, a few miles from 
the other station, where it is less distributed, and I believe more 
abundant.
I have seen a specimen from the Bishop's Waltham loca- 
lity in the herbarium of Miss S.
Lovell, of Sandown, Isle of Wight, 
from whom my information is derived.
In this lady's collection are 
two good specimens of Lotus angustissimus, from Stokes Bay, Gos- 
port, likewise gathered by Miss Minchin, who is about to favour me 
with a list of plants found by herself in this and other parts of the 
county, which, if received before the following remarks are forwarded 
for publication, may possibly enable me to announce some new acces- 
sions to the Hants Flora at their conclusion.

Note on a Hampshire Flora.
By Wm. A.
Bromfield, M.D., F.L.S.
No county perhaps in England has been less explored bo- 
tanically than Hampshire, or has fewer working botanists resi- 
dent within its pale, yet the number of its phsenogamous plants and 
ferns already ascertained amounts to very nearly, if not fully, 1000 
999 
species, those of the Isle of Wight of course inchided.
Many 
more I ara persuaded lurk undetected on the varied surface of the 
mainland (by far the most extensive and least examined) section of 
the county, and I heartily wish our travelling botanists would direct 
their attention to this most fertile and promising part of the south of 
England.
One entirely novel species, Simethis bicolor, has very re- 
cently been discovered at Bournraouth, which, from its range extend- 
ing in France to the opposite coasts of the Channel, may equally 
prove to be indigenous on this side of it.
But not from the transient 
researches of botanical tourists must we look for a complete Flora of 
Hampshire, nor is any individual, however active and zealous, com- 
petent to engage, single-handed, in the task of efficiently exploring 
so wide an area.
Partiality for my native county prompts the ex- 
pression of a wish that some of its indwellers would emulate the ex- 
ample of that earliest of Hampshire botanists, honest John Goodyer 
of worthy memory, in examining and reporting on the plants of their 
respective neighbourhoods.
May it be no longer a reproach to the 
county which gave birth to Gilbert White, that it is at least 7iot 
amongst the foremost in animating others with the same ardour for 
the study of Nature as was displayed by him whom it may be so 
justly proud of calling its own.
A better example has been set in 
this respect to the east and west of us by the contiguous counties of 
Sussex, Surrey and Dorset, all of which have produced their botani- 
cal historians, from whose zeal and ability have emanated valuable 
contributions to the science in the form of local lists and Floras.
The few additions to the common stock of botanical information 
which Hampshire can lay claim to have mostly proceeded from the 
pens of strangers and temporary residents.
In proof of the position that little has yet been done for the elucida- 
tion of the Hants Flora, I subjoin a list of fifty-two genera, which, so 
far as I can learn, are wanting (or 1 should rather say are unknown) 
to the county, several of which must nevertheless, from the universa- 
lity of their distribution in the neighbouring counties, really appertain 
to this.

loAved by a ?
denote their having been recorded as found in Hants, 
but are either now extinct, or rest on authority too ancient, or ques- 
tionable and unconfinned.
Sesleria is here introduced because, 
though hitherto supposed to be confined to limestone districts in the 
north of England, it is known to occur on dry chalk banks at Rouen, 
and may possibly be found with us in a similar situation, when the 
fact is kept in remembrance by collectors, who might otherwise over- 
look what they had no reason to expect falling in with; a common 
cause why even conspicuous plants often remain so long undetected.
This very trutli must plead an excuse for troubling the readers of the 
' Phytologist ' with observations so purely negative as the present ; the 
end I have in view will be better attained by engaging their attention 
to the discovery of our botanical desiderata, than in diverting it from 
the search by presenting them with a more palatable catalogue of as- 
certained county plants to pick and choose from, to fill vacant 
shelves in their herbariums.
The adage, " out of sight out of mind," 
would, I fear, be exemplified by the continuance in obscmity and 
concealment of most of my desiderated species, were I not to bring

to whom I confidently look for assistance in their detection.
The follomng species belonging to Hampshire genera should be 
looked for in the county, since there is reasonable probability of any 
one of them being native therein, though yet unrecorded.

A perusal of the foregoing lists will, I think, demonstrate the neg- 
lect the Flora of Hampshire has experienced as compared with those 
of the other south-eastern counties, since in all these last a fair pro- 
portion of the genera and species just enumerated have been found, 
some of them abundantly, and others by no means sparingly distri- 
buted.
The central, southern and eastern districts have received the 
gieater share of the limited attention bestowed on the county ; the 
north and north-western part is nearly an untrodden field for the bo- 
tanical explorer, and merits particular investigation, as likely to pro- 
duce some of the species proper to Berkshire and Oxfordshire, as 
Iberis amara and others, though much remains to be discovered in all 
quarters.
Even whilst penning these remarks, I have made an addi- 
tion to the Flora of this pretty well perambulated island in Polygonum 
minus, which grows in profusion on Sandown Level, mixed with and 
in a great measure masked from observation by the taller P.
Hydro- 
piper ; the drains intersecting the low meadows to the east of the high 
road from Ryde to Ventnor being conspicuous at a distance by a 
fi-inge of the richest colouring, the joint production of the exuberant 
gi-owth of these two species.
Alyssum calycinum has very recently 
been discovered growing abundantly on a fallow field behind Alver- 
stoke, along with Camelina sativa, by Miss L.
Minchin, from whom T 
have a specimen of the former, which is most probably introduced 
with glass or other seeds ; the presence of the latter, which I have not 
received an example of, is curious, as I believe it is seldom seen but 
1003 
where flax is cultivated, at least in this countiy ; for on the continent 
it occurs in similar localities with the one just mentioned.
Before leaving England last year, I learnt that a Flora of Winches- 
ter was in preparation by some botanists of that city : I trust the .in- 
tention is not given up, as the materials must be ample, but should 
such be unfortimately the case, it is to be hoped the authors of the 
projected work will embody the result of their researches in the com- 
pendious form of a catalogue for the ' Phytologist ' rather than with- 
hold them altogether fi'om those to whom, like myself, their publication 
would be useful.
It is my intention to include, though not to incor- 
porate, the Flora of the entire county of Hants in that of the Isle of 
Wight, the materials for which are in a very forward state for the press.
To all who will lend a hand, whether directly by communication with 
myself, or indirectly through the medium of this journal, to advance 
our knowledge of Hampshire Botany, I shall hold myself personally 
indebted, and more especially so to such as may be pleased to favour 
me by the transmission of living or dried specimens of any plants con- 
tained in the lists of genera and species given above.

Note on Leersia oryzoides.
By Wm. A.
Bromfield, M.D., F.L.S.
Transplanted from the marsh ditches of Henfield to a pond in the 
garden at St. John's, near Ryde, this singular grass shows no dis- 
position to the protrusion of its panicles from the sheaths of the top- 
most leaves, favoured as one might suppose the development would" 
have been by the general warmth of the past season.
Hence it may 
perhaps be safely assumed to have been overlooked in many other 
stations in which it will ere long be discovered.
The ordinary aspect 
of the herbage, so like that of other marsh grasses, has little to attract 
the notice of a casual passer by, and might well elude the scrutinizing 
glance of an experienced collector.
Careful search should therefore 
be made along the grassy margins of ditches, drains, ponds, rivers, and 
water courses, as also in wet hollows over our eastern and south-east- 
ern counties, in which alone it is likely to occur, when the extreme 
asperity of the leaves and of the weak reclining or even decumbent 
culms, cannot fail to detect it.
1 have a strong impression of having 
myself once found the Leersia many years ago, probably (from an in- 
1004 
distinct recollection of the time, and a no less misty reminiscence of 
the place) near Hastings, that being my first residence on returning 
from a four years' sojourn on the continent, in 1830, when I first 
turned my attention to botany.
The neglecting to examine so curious 
a "^wo?," if ever found at all, shows that it must have been made in 
the most inexperienced days of my (botanically speaking) juvenility: 
so I will not venture to dispute the discovery with my very worthy 
friend Mr. Borrer, but cheerfully " leave him alone in his glory " to 
enjoy the satisfaction of adding this to the many other "wild weeds" 
he has wreathed into chaplets for the brow of our rustic Flora.
This 
grass ranges over the whole of southern and central Europe to the 
Baltic confines of Germany, and though most prevalent in the deeply 
continental and warmer parts, is found in the maritime and western 
countries of France, Belgium, and Holland.
In America I remarked 
it as one of the commonest of grasses in low wet situations, flowering 
in the central states as early as July or August: there, the panicle is 
constantly exserted as in Italy, a portion at the base always remaining, 
I believe, hidden, and which alone it is said ripens seed.
My friend 
the Rev. Dr.
Bachman, of Charleston, tells me that Leersia oryzoides 
furnishes excellent hay, and that many tons are sent from Columbia 
and other parts of the middle and upper country of Carolina to that 
city, where it is preferred to the hay made with timothy {Plileiwi 
pratense), a staple meadow grass all over America.
As the cut grass 
is now known to be a native of England, its growth might be advan- 
tageously encourged or artificially established in swampy pastures or 
along the ditches of water meadows, where it would in all likelihood 
prove to be both permanent and productive.

Note on Sisyrinchium anceps.
By Wm. A.
Bromfielu, M.D., F.L.S.
In the second edition of his valuable ' Manual of British Botany,' 
Mr. Babington introduces the pretty " blue-eyed grass " of America 
{Sisyrinchium anceps) as a native of Ireland, without any mark 
attached to indicate a doubt in his mind of its claim to be so con- 
sidered.
Were I not assured that so cautious and correct a botanist 
must have good reason for believing a plant foreign to the European 
flora to be indigenous in its alleged place of growth, I should feel very 
sceptical on the propriety of admitting it, at least without some such 
1005 
protest.
The vegetation of Ireland betrays no greater affinity to that 
of North America than the flora of England or any other country of 
western Europe, and the discovery of a single American species so far 
beyond its usual limits, is powerless to establish the supposed transi- 
tion state on which to found its right to be looked upon as indigenous.
Sisyrinchium anceps is an abundant inhabitant of grassy woods and 
pastures from New England to Louisiana : its bright blue flowers peer- 
ing out Hke laughing eyes on the green world and azure heavens, justi- 
fy the poetical name it has received in the land of the setting sun.
S. anceps, mucronatum, and Bermudianum would seem to be all 
referrible to a single species, and my friend Dr. Darlington, of West 
Chester, remarks (Fl. Cestrica) that in his Pennsylvanian plant the 
spathe is decidedly shorter than the flowers, as Mr. Babington finds it 
in that from Ireland.

On the Credit-icorthiness of the Labels distrihuied from the Botanical 
Society of London.
By Hewett C.
Watson, Esq.
In a late Number of the ' Phytologist' some allusion is made to the 
state of botanical nomenclature among British botanists at the period 
when this periodical commenced its useful career.
A part of the 
passage on the subject runs as follows: â€” "The two Botanical Socie- 
ties at that time distributed plants with equal inattention to correct 
nomenclature, so that blunders became disseminated through the 
country under the grave and pompous sanction of scientific authority.
Indeed, the blundering of Societies may have exercised an influence 
in increasing the blundering of writers.
As regards Societies, however, 
a great improvement has taken place, and great care is now taken to 
see that the plants distributed are correctly named." (Phytol.
ii.
782).
This censure is sufficiently sweeping, it must be allowed.
But I 
fear it must also be allowed, that the censure is substantially true and 
justifiable ; some modifications being made, in order to adapt it more 
exactly to the individualities of two different Societies, which have run 
in different courses.
Originally, the nomenclature on the labels of 
the Edinburgh Society was far less inaccurate and blundering than 
that of the London Society.
But while the latter has been iraprovino- 
very rapidly, the Edinburgh Society has been standing still or retro-

grading in attention to nomenclature as well as in too many other 
respects also.
Whatever may have been the relative position of the 
two Societies some years ago, that of London has since most assuredly 
left the other far behind in carrying out the purposes for which they 
were understood to be originally instituted.
The appearance of the censure quoted in the above passage from 
the ' Phytologist,' has not lessened a wish which I had long since felt, 
of making public record of some circumstances which might assist 
botanists in forming a proper estimate of the degree of trust or distrust 
to be given to the labels issued with specimens from the Botanical 
Society of London.
This institution may now be deemed the grand 
centre from which the herbaria of British botanists are supplied with 
such specimens as the individual possessors or collectors of herbaria 
cannot readily procure for themselves.
Among upwards of two hun- 
dred members we now find many of the most active field collectors 
and best practical botanists of Britain.
Their duplicate specimens 
are sent to London as a central depot, whence they are again promptly 
distributed among the individual members in England and foreign 
botanists, according to the requirements of each.
Many thousands 
of labelled specimens are thus distributed from London each year, in 
the name of the Society.
Much influence, whether for good or for 
mischief, must thus be exercised over those departments of botanical 
science in which accuracy of nomenclature is an essential matter; for 
example, among others, in the publication of local lists, or of special 
localities for plants.
Of the London Society's doings during the few first years of its in- 
stituted existence, say from 1836 to 1840, I know very little ; although 
enabled to form legitimate guesses or inferences thereanent, from cir- 
cumstances which have subsequently come within my knowledge.
Under a mistaken idea that sufficient reliance might be placed upon 
the good faith and public pledges of those who were assuming the 
management of the Botanical Society of Edinburgh, I became an 
early member of that Society ; while the association of a few tyros, 
under the pretending title of " Botanical Society of London," appeared 
to presage only an abortive effort and short existence.
Subsequently, 
however, I was induced to join the London Society also; although 
at first only with the design of assisting its objects by one additional 
subscription, and without any thought of actively interfering in the 
management.
But as it soon become too evident that the Edinburgh Society 
would not be worked for the general benefit of its members, and would 
1007 
more and more be converted into a mere instrument for promoting the 
personal interests of two or three individuals, 1 saw that some other 
institution must manage the machinery for producing those more ge- 
neral and less selfish services which had been first expected from the 
Edinburgh Society.
My conviction was, that the scheme of an associ- 
ation for the mutual exchange of specimens, which had long been a 
desideratum with several botanists, would certainly prove futile unless 
the London Society could be raised from its obscurity and usolessness, 
and be rendered generally serviceable to those who might become 
members, whether resident or non-resident, present or distant.
The 
botanical inexperience of its then active managers, and the childish 
character of its management, were serious impediments, it is true.
But I saw among the resident members a spirit of integrity and good- 
will towards others, â€” a wish to render the institution equally service- 
able to others as to themselves ; and on that moral superiority in the 
London Society I relied for its ultimate success, if a sufficient share of 
botanical experience could be united therewith.
Under this conviction, and with this hope, I began to take some 
share in the management of the London Society, though very little at 
first.
But the more I looked into its proceedings, the more imperfect 
and inefficient they appeared to be, both in plan and in execution.
The correction of one erroneous course or method, for a time, appeared 
only to give prominence to another almost as bad ; and the necessity 
of changes for the better seemed to be ever recurring.
A continued 
endeavour to introduce abetter methods, and of giving something like 
scientific precision to the doings of the Society, has thus been gradu- 
ally leading me on, until I now find myself so much implicated that a 
very large portion of the actual work and responsibility now falls upon 
my own head and hands.
Indeed, I may question whether the earnest 
and indefatigable Secretary himself, whose disinterested exertions have 
conduced so much to the Society's efficiency, is called upon to devote 
more time and attention to its affairs.
And I feel quite sure that he 
need not devote more, if he vi^ould rest satisfied with doing what is 
really needful, without letting his zeal force him upon the attempt to 
do more than is necessary from him.
The manner in which these 
circumstances have influenced the Society's distribution of specimens, 
and affected the accuracy of its labels, will presently appear.
In the earlier years of the Society's existence, it was customary to 
have an annual distribution by dividing among its contributors such 
specimens as had been received in the year or season, some imperfect 
arrangements being made for selecting the desiderata of the members, 
1008 
if the chances of the year's receipts should afford the species desired.
This simple and easily managed system was too much of a lottery and 
chance-method; for a member might obtain much that he did not 
want, with little or nothing that he did want, in return for his contri- 
bution.
It was a system which might work passably well among mere 
beginners in botany, and was thus not badly adapted to those of 
whom the association then chiefly consisted.
But the circumstance 
of contributors and distributors being both mostly beginners, unavoid- 
ably led to serious mischief by the circulation of numerous misnamed 
specimens, the labels of which bore the " pompous sanction of 
scientific authority," implied in the pretending title imprinted thereon, 
namely, " Botanical Society of London," or some supposed equivalent 
in the latin language.
I think it was in the winter of 1840-1841 that I was asked to look 
over a large batch of these accumulated specimens, after they had been 
labelled, and also sorted into order for distribution, by the Committee 
appointed for the purpose.
At that time I was not well prepared for 
examining nomenclature, my attention having been diverted to other 
subjects than botany during the preceding few years.
However, the 
re-examination was so evidently needed that I consented to look 
through the lot, including probably a thousand species, and five or ten 
times as many specimens, the greater portion being examples of com- 
mon English plants.
Among the lot I found upwards of eighty spe- 
cies misnamed ; and as the misnomers of course were multiplied by 
the duplicate specimens, they really included several hundreds of false 
labels.
Besides this, I had too much reason to suspect that, in many 
instances, the localities indicated on the labels deserved as little re- 
liance as the names.
Such being the character of the Society's nomenclature in the fifth 
year of its experience, w^e may fairly presume that the distributions of 
former years could not have been more accurate and trustworthy in 
that respect ; and, indeed, the labels of specimens preserved in the 
herbarium, with other visible evidences, left me no room for doubt of 
such being the fact during previous years.
The late Mr. Daniel 
Cooper had been much relied upon for nomenclature and general 
management.
He was certainly an intelligent and active-minded 
young man ; but he had unfortunately imagined himself already com- 
petent to guide and instruct others before he had sufficiently acquired 
knowledge as a learner.
It was thus made very obvious to me, that the labels of the London 
Society would obtain no trust or credit in the botanical world, and 
1009 
could do no service in the way of correcting nomenclature, unless they 
could be rendered far more accurate in future ; and also some mode 
be found and announced, by which a distinction could be made be- 
tween the then past and the then future labels, â€” between those which 
partook so largely of error, and those which I hoped to see more 
deserving of trust thenceforward.
On the labels used up to 1841, the 
words " Ex herbario Bot. Soc.
London," or " Botanical Society of 
London," were printed conspicuously at the top of the label, above 
the blank space left for the name of the plant; â€” a stupid idea, by the 
by, apparently borrowed from the Edinburgh Society.
I suggested 
that in future those words should always be placed at the bottom of 
the labels, so as to let the names of the plants be the first words to 
meet the eye, and thus facilitate the sorting and arranging of speci- 
mens ; a second advantage being likewise obtained thereby, in the 
ready distinction which would thus be afforded between past and 
future labels.
But as one important step towards rendering any after-dated labels 
more trustworthy, it was necessary to abolish altogether a most vicious 
custom previously acted upon to a large extent.
I allude to the inane 
practice of sending any quantity of blank labels, bearing the Society's 
printed designation, to be used by the individual members in labelling 
their own specimens.
No distinction appeared to have been made 
between the experienced and the inexperienced botanists, in this 
practice ; the labels having been promiscuously and lavishly supplied 
to those who asked for them.
There could be little doubt that many 
specimens, so labelled with the Society's printed forms, would be dis- 
tributed by the individual members without ever passing under the 
eyes of the Committe in London.
The Society's name was placed at 
the command of any inexperienced tyro who filled up the labels with 
the names of his specimens, and what the writer in the ' Phytologist ' 
calls " the pompous sanction of scientific authority " might in truth 
be no more than the slender knowledge of the veriest beginner in 
botany.
The Secretary readily acquiesced in my earnest recommendations 
to cease this absurd and mischievous practice of supplying the Socie- 
ty's blank forms to individual members.
But it is much easier for a 
man of obliging disposition to promise a refusal beforehand, than to 
make such refusal at the right time.
I had afterwards the vexation of 
discovering that the blank forms were still sent out after my re- 
monstrance; and in one or more instances this was done, I think, 
even so late as 1843.
Meantime, I had been taking considerable 
1010 
pains to make the labels more accurate, and to keep within reach the 
means of correcting such errors as might still be put into circulation 
from Bedford Street.
But of course my own efforts were greatly frus- 
trated and stultified by the continuance of a pi'actice so much to be 
reprobated.
Nor was this the only instance in which those efforts 
were rendered of little avail.
I have no doubt that many mislabelled 
specimens were also distributed from Bedford Street between the years 
1840 and 1844.
Thus, whether the words " Botanical Society of Lon- 
don " be found at the top or at the bottom of the label, is a difference 
of comparatively little importance.
Adherence to a very bad prece- 
dent has vitiated all the Society's labels up to 1843; possibly likewise 
to a later date, since some of the blank forms may have remained on 
hand, and have been filled up and distributed still more recently, 
without first reaching London.
After these glaring examples, it seems needless to cite in detail 
other instances of inattention to accuracy, or of injudicious practices 
calculated to damage the Society's name, and to detract greatly from 
the usefulness which might otherwise, and much earlier, have charac- 
terized its proceedings.
Suffice it to say that, previous to 1841, the 
errors put into botanical circulation, under sanction of the Society's 
name, appear to have been gigantically numerous, with scarcely any 
compensating advantage from its doings.
From 1841 to 1844, I must 
deem myself a participator in the proceedings and responsibilities of 
the Society.
But during much of that period I could only feel myself 
continually engaged in a vexing struggle against a deficiency of scien- 
tific accuracy, an inattention to orderly arrangements, and a lack of 
methodical management, which would assuredly have driven me from 
the London Society, had there appeared any reasonable likelihood of 
the Edinburgh Society redeeming its pledges, or treating its non-resi- 
dents with even-handed justice.
The want of order and precision in 
the Bedford Street management was too usually carried the length of 
downright disorderliness and slovenly confusion ; while the state of 
dust and dirt in which the rooms and cabinets were suffered to remain, 
rendered it quite disagreeable to do anything in them.
It is true, a verbal and ostensible acquiescence was given to various 
remedial ameliorations which from time to time I suggested.
But too 
frequently I found these rendered profitless through being neglected 
in practice ; or that the anticipated advantages were nullified by some 
ill-judged act which served to counteract the effect desired from them.
It was even more vexatious to find ray own efforts thus impeded or 
neutralized, while there really was an ample store of the best possible 
1011 
intentions, with much anxiety and exertion for promoting the Society's 
objects and interests, on the part of those same persons who were 
nevertheless so impeding and neutralizing mine, simply through their 
own insufficient apprehension of the true requisites for scientific pro- 
gress.
They were doing good service, adulterated with disservice, at 
the same time ; and conscious of the former, but unconscious of the 
latter, they doubtless deemed my remonstrances and grumblings 
highly unreasonable.
Nevertheless, although much might have been 
better done, and it would have been much better if other things had 
not been done at all, there really was some onwai'd progress and im- 
provement between 1840 and 1844.
The Society gained useful mem- 
bers ; experiments were tried, which, though unsuccessful at the time, 
led the way to better measures ; and I make no doubt that, on the 
whole, the number of mislabelled specimens was proportionally much 
less.
From 1844, inclusively, the London Society has advanced with 
rapid and safe progress in that one branch of its operations which I 
have myself always considered to be in truth more like the main stem, 
although various other objects are or were ostensibly embraced in its 
projected ramifications.
It will readily be surmised that I am here 
alluding to the operations of the Society regarded as an institution for 
mutual interchange of specimens ; â€” for bringing into one convenient 
centre, and re-distributing thence the products of various localities and 
countries; â€” for diffusing through Britain a large number of carefully 
labelled specimens, and thus conveying instruction to isolated or 
provincial botanists, whose opportunities for examining authentic spe- 
cimens in other herbaria may be few and far between.
This function 
of the Society appears to me a highly important and useful one.
For 
any other purpose than this one, 1 fear that the Botanical Society of 
London can only be deemed valueless at present.
True, the same 
zeal and perseverance of a few individuals, which has planned and 
gradually worked out the distributing system to its present state of 
practical efficiency, may be extended into other departments also.
But an almost insuperable bar to anything like general efficiency, is 
found in the slender finances of the Society.
After payment of rent 
and other local and fixed expenses, nothing remains to offer as a re- 
muneration for skilled and competent labour; which is a marketable 
commodity not often to be got without payment.
Services which are 
offered for nothing, too often are found to be worth very little ; and 
those which can be bought for little, are likely to prove worth nothing 
at all.
1012 
Without explaiuiug all the steps of the process, and the various ex- 
pedients for facilitating the troublesome labour of distribution on so 
large a scale, it may still be advisable for me to advert briefly to the 
present routine, in order to give botanists the means of judging for 
themselves how far they may now safely trust the labels sent to them 
from the Botanical Society of London.
Our rule is, for the contri- 
butor himself to label the British specimens which he transmits in 
duplicate to London for distribution.
As the parcels are received they 
are deposited in a large box in Bedford Street, which in due time is 
despatched to me here, at Ditton, filled with the parcels.
My first 
work is to take out all the specimens from the various parcels, and re- 
move them to paper of one uniform size ; this preliminary step being 
indispensable for the after sorting and arranging, by which they would 
be much chipped and broken, if turned about upon sheets of unequal 
size.
Any specimens which may be required for the Society's herba- 
rium, or for any other special purpose, are then selected ; and (as may 
be shrewdly guessed) I take the same opportunity of attending to the 
wants of " No. 1 ; " but these being much less numerous than the 
contributions made to the Society by said " No. 1," the abstractions 
are more than repaid.
The specimens are afterwards sorted out and 
arranged, so as to bring all those of the same species together, and to 
place the whole in the same order of succession or sequence as that in 
which their names are printed and numbered in the ' London Cata- 
logue of British Plants.' In the course of sorting and so on, various 
changes and corrections of name have usually to be made ; fresh labels 
being written for such specimens as may have been incorrectly named, 
or for others sent un-labelled by botanists who are not members, and 
therefore not amenable to the rules.
Invariably, hitherto, numerous 
specimens have required to be taken out and destroyed, or else re- 
turned to the member who sent them ; being insuflicient fragments, or 
very badly dried, or too long for the paper, or labelled contrary to rule, 
or objectionable in some other sort.
Ultimately, the rest are again 
boxed, and returned to London, where the ever-working Secretary (in 
the want of a Curator) introduces them, species by species, into their 
proper places among the general store of duplicates for distribution ; 
and from which he selects the desiderata of members, with such 
additional help as he may be fortunate enough to obtain from other 
resident members in town.
From these explanations, although not very full or complete, it 
wiil be understood that the labels of British specimens, distributed 
latterly (during about three or four years) from the London Society, 
1013 
have usually passed under three jjairs of botanical eyes.
The labels 
are penned by the original contributor, who is often also the collector 
of the specimens, and thus sufficiently familiar with them.
They 
have likely passed unchallenged under my own eyes in the processes 
of sorting and arranging, &c.
And they again pass under the inspec- 
tion of Mr. Dennes, or may be some other individual, when he takes 
out the specimens in London, in order to supply the desiderata of 
members.
Usually there are numerous specimens of the same spe- 
cies, and when this is the case I do not read each label singly ; nor 
perhaps does Mr. Dennes always read the labels in selecting speci- 
mens from the general store of duplicates ; so that there may be par- 
ticular instances where a label has been really seen and examined 
only by the original sender.
And on the other hand, when fresh la- 
bels are written, in order to change the nomenclature, the original 
contributor ceases to be responsible for their accuracy.
In certain 
genera, also, where the limits and distinctions of species remain lui- 
settled, we should not change the labels, although our individual opi- 
nions might not concur with that of the contributor who had attached 
his own labels to the specimens ; say, for example, in the genus 
Rtihus, where we should never change the labels of Mr. Bloxara.
These, and some other special instances would be the exceptions ; 
for, in general, the labels will have had the treble sanction.
But I 
need scarcely observe that, in passing thousands of specimens through 
hand, often with considerable rapidity, oversights will be committed, 
labels will occasionally be crossed or misapplied, and other sources 
of error may arise.
There is one particular form of label, among several which have 
been used for British plants, that I will take the present opportunity 
of explaining.
Some years ago, there was a large accumulation of 
specimens with loose labels, which had been mixed and confused to- 
gether in such manner as to render the correct appropriation of the 
labels to the specimens quite impossible.
They were known to be 
British specimens, and that was all that could be said of many of 
them in the way of indicating their habitats.
For these specimens, 
many of which were sent abroad, we had a very general form of label 
printed, simply indicating that they had come iiom the Society's du- 
plicates of British plants.
The same general form of label has been 
also used occasionally for specimens which have been sent to the So- 
ciety without labels, by botanists who are not members.
I mention 
them here by way of intimation to those who might suppose that the 
Society was unmindful of its own rule which directs contributors to 
Vol. II.
L 
1014 
specify the county and locality on their labels.
I may also mention 
here, that some would-be-thought botanists are guilty of the repre- 
hensible practice of mingling specimens and loose labels from diffe- 
rent and even distant localities ; by which means it may frequently 
happen that a label specifying one locality, becomes attached to a 
specimen really brought from a different locality.
Very serious errors 
or falsifications have arisen through this and similar bad practices, 
especially where two species have been mixed and mistaken one for 
the other.
One lady-botanist, of well-known name, has done this to 
a great extent ; and thus has thrown into circulation numerous errors, 
some of which have appeared in print also.
As to the Botanical Society's foreign specimens, I am very sorry 
to say, almost the whole work of exchange and distribution falls to 
my lot, and sadly troublesome and time-stealing 1 find it to be.
Most heartily do I wish that other botanist, in and near London, 
would relieve me from this heavy tax on time ; which requires an 
union, in the same party, of ample leisure and a considerable familia- 
rity with the Botany of various countries.
As numerous specimens 
come from different and distant parts of the world, often only par- 
tially labelled or wholly unlabelled, the head-work in making out the 
species, and the hand-work in labelling them when made out, are both 
great consumers of time, too great indeed, for accuracy and complete- 
ness ; besides all the other work of sorting, arranging, selecting, pack- 
ing, &c., &c.
Here, then, " the pompous sanction of scientific au- 
thority," under the sounding designation "Botanical Society of 
London," is in truth often only the hurried opinion of the individual 
member who subscribes the present paper.
To sum up in conclusion, 
we should distinguish three periods of the Society's existence, in 
which the degree of trust or distrust, attaching to the labels and spe- 
cimens has been shown to vaiy.
First, those distributed previous to 
1841 having been largely mingled with error, are to be distrusted.
Second, from 1841 to 1844, although the probability of correctness is 
considerably increased, there was still a want of sufficient care and 
exactness ; so that, in cases of doubt, the labels are to be received 
with caution or suspicion.
Third, from 1844 to the present time, 
touch more attention has been bestowed upon the labels towards in- 
suring correctness of name and locality ; and the arrangements in 
general have been such as to combine accuracy and facility to a de- 
gree which has probably not been attained elsewhere.
Accuracy and 
tardiness, or quickness and incorrectness, are combinations not diffi- 
cult to make.
But where specimens are annually received in thou- 
1015 
sands and tens of thousands, and have to be again divided among two 
or three hundred botanists, according to the individual wants of each, 
it is truly a difficult achievement to write with sufficient rapidity with 
sufficient accuracy ; especially where this has to be accomplished by 
the unpaid exertions of very few persons, who have also their own 
professional or other absorbing avocations to occupy great part of their 
time and thoughts.
Carefully planned arrangements, methodical pre- 
cision, and uniformity strictly enforced, are the keys of success.
And 
if our valued Secretary would always take these keys with him to Bed- 
ford Street, bright in use, when he goes to perform the duties of Cura- 
tor there, all might go on well and smoothly : unluckily the keys 
sometimes become very rusty.
I am sorry to add, however, that there is one serious difficulty, 
which may be formidable enough to throw back all into confusion 
again.
The difficulty springs from inattention and negligence on the 
part of country contributors.
Certain rules are very explicitly laid 
down for their guidance in selecting and labelling their specimens.
If these rules were strictly attended to by all, it would give great fa- 
cility to the task of sorting and arranging; and the rules themselves 
are simple and easy of observance.
But one member neglects one 
rule ; another neglects a second rule ; another neglects a third rule, 
and so on.
When their parcels eventually meet in London or Ditton, 
instead of that uniformity and exactness which would be so service- 
able, all is variety and confusion ; the labour of arrangement being 
thereby doubled and trebled.
So serious is the evil, that unless the 
approaching winter shall bring a very decided change for the better, 
in regard to the observance of fixed rules, I shall feel compelled to 
relieve myself from effort and responsibility for the future.
I cannot 
afford the additional sacrifice of time caused by this inattention to 
the prescribed regulations ; and truly I know not who else can and 
will afford it.

The Rev. W, W.
Spicer exhibited specimens of Juncus diffusus, 
Hoppe, gathered by him in company with W.
Borrer, Esq., on a heath 
between Guildford and Woking railway station.
The plant was in 
great plenty, intermixed with Juncus glaucus.
Mr. J.
D. Salmon 
1016 
also exhibited a single specimen of the same taken from the vicinity 
of Chilworth, and stated that he had not been able to ascertain its 
existence on many of the heaths in the immediate neighbourhood 
of Godalming, although Juncus glaucus is found in the greatest 
profusion.
Mr. J.
D. Salmon exhibited specimens of Setaria viridis, Beauv., 
from Brook farm, near Albury, a station where this plant was noticed 
several years ago by Mr. Irvine, and pointed out that the specimens 
of the latter differed from the figure in the ' English Botany,' 875, 
which represents the plant as having an erect spike, whereas in those 
shown not only the whole plant, but the spikes were also prostrate, 
and that this was the state of all the plants growing in the same loca- 
lity (a wheat stubble) : in Koch a synonym is given Panicum recli- 
natum.
Will., which is very characteristic.
Mr. Spicer also an- 
nounced that within the last few days he had found some plants of 
this species in the neighbourhood of Puttenham.
Mr. Salmon also 
presented Alopecurus fulvus, S)n., from New Pond, Godalming.
Mr. A.
Irvine exhibited specimens of Trifolium fragiferum, from 
Woodbridge, neighbourhood of Guildford ; also a viviparous state of 
Trifolium repens, and the variety of Eqnisetum palustre, E.
polysta- 
chion of Ray's Synopsis.

Occurrence of Myriophyllum pectinatum at Fakenham.
By W.
L. NoTCUTT, Esq.
It may interest some of your readers to know that I have detected 
during the past summer Myriophyllum peclinatum of De Candolle 
(M.
verticillatum, y.
pectinatum of Koch) in some plenty in this 
neighbourhood.
The habit of the plant is very different from the 
ordinary form of M.
verticillatum, its appearance being that of M.
spi- 
catiim, from which, however, it is readily to be distinguished by the 
pectinately-divided bracteas being two or three times as long as the 
flowers.
I may, perhaps, be pardoned if 1 call attention to the 
characters generally given for M.
spicatum.
The bracts are usually 
described as " entire," or " all entire," and Mr. Babington does not 
seem to have observed the incorrectness of it.
Only the uppermost 
bracts are ovate and entire in the plants 1 have examined, all the rest 
1017 
are pectinately pinnatifid, though smaller than in the plant above 
named, which has all its bracts of this description.
There does not appear to be any character in M.
pectinatum suffi- 
cient to separate it from M, verticillatum as a species, but it is certain- 
ly a remarkable-looking variety.

Note on Bartrarriidula IVilsoni of Bruch and Schimper.
By Alexander Croall, Esq.
Perhaps it may be interesting to the readers of the 'Phytologist' 
to know the exact locality of this beautiful and interesting little plant, in 
order that they may keep a look out for it, should any of them happen 
to visit the same or a similar locality.
To those who have visited 
Clova, the birch-trees at the head of Glen Dole, where flowers and 
fruits in great profusion the lovely Linnaea borealis and Hypnum 
crista- castrensis, will be quite familiar.
Here the Glen is shut up by 
the shoulder of a hill â€” Craig Lunkar, on one side of which the White 
Water pours down over its wild and rocky channel, on the other is a 
sloping hollow occupied by a small stream and leading over to Loch 
Esk. It is the shoulder above described on which grew the Bartra- 
midula, in such profusion as to cover almost the whole of it, under this 
restriction that it only extended over those parts, the surface of which 
had been recently burned.
The plants were mostly single but sometimes tufted, and such was 
the singular beauty of the tiny plant, that I could not resist the 
temptation of picking some two hundred specimens, although I had 
not then studied the mosses, and have still a few specimens to ex- 
1018 
change with any botanical friend to whom it may be acceptable.
The 
larger plants were growing in a beautifully radiating or stellated man- 
ner, and with their cernuous capsules spreading on every side, pre- 
sented an object exceedingly pretty.

On the Viola Jlavicornis of Sjnith and others; in reply to Mr.
Forster.
By Hewett C.
Watson, Esq.
In the * Phy tologist ' for October (Phytol.
ii.
963), Mr. Forster has 
denied the correctness of certain opinions which I had elsewhere set 
forth, to the effect that a wrong plant has been figured in the ' Supple- 
ment to English Botany,' plate 2736, under his sanction, for the 
Viola flavicornis of Smith ; the true plant of Smith, as I understand 
it, being a different thing (whether a good species or the contrary), 
and properly represented by a plant which I have distributed from 
the heaths and commons of Surrey, labelled with the name of V.
fla- 
vicornis.
Since reading Mr. Forster's paper I have again examined the spe- 
cimens in Smith's herbarium, labelled "flavicornis" by himself, but 
only with the same result as before.
I still find myself unable to 
adopt the views of Mr. Forster ; who, be it observed, gives no fact or 
reason beyond his faith in his own eyes, for contradicting my opi- 
nions.
No doubt that highly respected botanist is well entitled to 
prefer the evidence of his own sense of sight before that of another 
person.
But since he and J literally have had the same facts under 
our observation, and have yet formed different opinions therefrom, it 
is clear that some more reasoning argument must be found in sub- 
stantiation, than the words of Mr. Forster, " I now boldly venture to 
assert," which can be received only as the expression of a confident 
opinion, and not as any argument towards proof of its soundness.
The differences between us are rather complicated and confusing, 
because they involve four separate things, all of which have in turn 
been expressed by the name of " Viola flavicornis." I will first dis- 
tinguish the four things here, and temporarily employ other names to 
designate three of them, as the most likely way for avoiding that bias 
of judgment and confusion of ideas, so likely to arise where several 
things are called by one single name before they have been proved 
1019 ^.
suflBciently identical to warrant the common designation.
The four 
things are these : â€” 
1. The plant described by Smith, under name of V.
flavicornis, 
and specimens of which are preserved in his herbarium, so la- 
belled by himself.
For this plant I will here use its undoubted 
name of " Smith's flavicornis." 
2. A plant figured in the ' Supplement to English Botany,' plate 
2736, with the sanction of Mr. Forster, also under the same 
name.
For this plant I will here use the name of " Forster's 
violet." 
3. A plant found on the commons of Surrey, which I have repeat- 
edly labelled by the same name, under the conviction of its 
being the plant truly intended by Smith.
For this plant I will 
here use the name of " Surrey violet." 
4. Another plant, also found on the commons of Surrey, which I 
have labelled " Viola canina, var.
pusilla, Bab.," or " Viola 
flavicornis, Eng. Bot., not Sm.," as being the nearest represen- 
tative which I have ever seen of the plant figured in 'English 
Botany,' and described in the ' Manual of British Botany ' un- 
der those names.
For this plant I will here use the name of 
" dwarf violet." 
The differences between Mr. Forster and myself turn on the ques- 
tion how far these several plants should be considered identical varie- 
ties or species.
We seem agreed that they are not so many as four 
different varieties, and equally so that they are not to be received as 
comprehending only one single variety.
But we unite them differently.
First, Mr. Forster considers 1 and 2 identical, whereas I deem them 
to be two different and distinguishable plants.
Second, I consider 1 
and 3 identical, whereas Mr. Forster holds them different.
Third, I 
consider 2 and 4 to be the same ; but I cannot clearly see from his 
paper whether Mr. Forster concurs with this view or not.
First, then, I propose to discuss the question of identity or other- 
wise between 1 and 2, that is, between " Smith's flavicornis " and 
" Forster's violet." As Mr. Forster asserts, on the faith of his own 
eyes, that these two are truly identical, while I see them differently, 
it may be deemed incumbent on me to state loherein they differ, and 
what grounds there are for supposing that " Forster's violet " is not 
" Smith's flavicornis." My objection to the figure of Forster's violet 
is, that it represents a plant which differs by no describable charac- 
ters from dwarf examples of Viola canina, and wants certain charac- 
ters which Smith mentions in 'English Flora' as those of his V.
1020 
flavicornis.
The leaves of this latter plant (Smith's species) are de- 
scribed as beiug " obtuse minutely crenate," and the flowers are said 
to be " half the size of V.
canina, of a rather deeper blue." Now the 
leaves of Forster's violet are represented as quite acute and sharply 
crenate or rather serrate, the flowers large and with the purple tint of 
V. canina.
Moreover, Mr. Forster states that his violet is the same 
as Babington's variety " pusilla," which is thus described in the 
Manual : " leaves roundish-cordate rather acute small, flowers large." 
Further, Mr. Forster is at variance with Smith in another respect, 
while writing for the ' Phytologist,' that "The two figures in E.
B. 
and the figure in Dillenius's edition of Ray's Synopsis, well represent 
the specimen preserved in Smith's own herbarium." According to 
my sight, the figures in ' English Botany ' are not good representa- 
tions of Smith's specimens, but are passably good figures of the 
" dwarf violet ;" and as to the figure of Dillenius, Smith himself writes 
that "his figure by no means represents the true nature of the stem, nor 
does it exhibit any of the parts most material for specific discrimina- 
tion." Add thereto, that Babington places " Forster's violet" as the 
first variety of Viola canina; intending, I presume, that it is the one 
which differs least from the ordinary or typical form ; whereas Smith 
describes his flavicornis as a distinct species, and places another spe- 
cies (recognized as such by Babington) between it and V.
canina ; 
thus showing that he intends something considerably different.
Put- 
ling these differences and difficulties together, T think they should be 
deemed more weighty in their aggregate, than the mere assertion of 
Mr. Forster, that his violet and Smith's flavicornis are not different.
I shall add something more to their weight in endeavouring to show 
that another plant, the " Surrey violet," is the true flavicornis of 
Smith.
Secondly, I am confirmed in my reasons for believing Mr. Forster 
under a misapprehension about Smith's plant, by finding two plants 
in Surrey (two well marked varieties, if not absolutely different spe- 
cies), one of which, " the Surrej' violet," corresponds w^ell with Smith's 
own description of his flavicornis, and also (to my eyes, at least) with 
the specimens in his herbarium ; while the other, " the dwarf violet," 
corresponds with the figures and description of " Forster's violet," be- 
fore cited.
The former of these two, " the Surrey violet," agrees with 
the plant of Smith precisely in those characters by which Forster's 
violet differs.
It has the smaller and more blue flowers, with the ob- 
tuse leaves ; and it further agrees with Smith's plant in the rigid or 
coriaceous consistence of its leaves.
It is also a persistent variety 
1021 
under cultivation, as Smith remarks of his plant.
But Mr. Forster 
states that this " Surrey violet " is not Smith's flavicornis.
1 am here 
entitled to ask of him, in my turn, by what characters does it differ f^ 
I have mentioned points in which his violet differs from that of 
Smith, â€” can he shew those by which the Surrey violet differs to an 
equal degree ?
â€” or to any describable degree ?
Thirdly, if I were assured that Mr. Forster and Mr. Babington deny 
the identity which I see between the " dwarf violet " and " Forster's 
violet," 1 should say that I so regard them as being identical because 
the figure in 'English Botany,' and the short description in the 
Manual, both correspond better with that " dwarf violet," than they 
correspond with the description of flavicornis in ' English Flora,' or 
with the specimens of it in Smith's herbarium, or with any other 
British violet known to me.
My impression, however, is, that Mr.
Forster admits and recognizes the identity of his violet and that which 
I here call "the dwarf violet;" and that our difference begins only 
when he would include Smith's flavicornis with them also.
Lastly, as an indirect corroboration of my own views, I would allude 
to the circumstance of Mr. Forster and Mr. Babington differing much 
in their opinions regarding the Surrey violet which I deem identical 
with the true flavicornis of Smith.
Mr. Forster thinks it may be re- 
ferred to Smith's V.
lactea ; whereas Mr. Babington pronounces it to 
be his montana, which he gives as a variety of V.
canina, not of 
V. lactea.
So, also, Mr. Babington places " Ruppii " as the next va- 
riety of canina, differing very slightly (as he says by letter) from mon- 
tana, and describes V.
lactea as a different species; whereas Mr.
Forster writes, " V.
Ruppii I have always supposed identical with 
V. lactea Smith ; scarcely a variety." Thus at any rate, one of these 
two gentlemen must widely misunderstand the Surrey violet ; and it is 
my conviction that both are in error.
I have had these violets under observation for several seasons, in 
their wild state, transplanted into my garden, and raised afresh from 
seeds.
Whether there are two permanently distinct species, 1 cannot 
say with any confidence ; but there are two groups or series of varie- 
ties, which are distinguishable one from the other, although the seve- 
ral forms of the same group appear to pass into each other by almost 
insensible degrees.
These two groups include the British violets 
described under the following names: â€” 
1. Viola canina, sylvatica, pusilla (Forster's flavicornis).
2. Viola flavicornis {Smith), lactea, Ruppii, montana.
The first gioup is known by its broader yet more acute leaves, their 
Vol. II.
6 m 
1022 
more flexible consistence, and the more purple tint of the flowers, 
which vary through pale lilac into white.
The second group is known 
by its narrower and more obtuse leaves, their thicker and more rigid 
consistence, and the predominating blue tint of the flowers, which 
ranges from a deep blue through a pale blue (not lilac) gradually into 
white.
There is, however, great variety of form and size, both in 
leaves and flowers.
I have seen the leaves of V.
canina quite reni- 
form, and thus perfectly obtuse ; while those of the " Surrey violet " 
(Babington's montana) are sometimes almost equally acute as in some 
examples of the "pusilla" form of V.
canina.
When collecting the 
"Surrey violet" or "dwarf violet" where they grow intermingled, I 
find the blue or the purple tints excellent practical guides, without 
which I might frequently stoop to pick the wrong plants.

Note on Hieracium heierophyUum .
By James Backhouse, Esq.
I have been much interested with the description of Hieracium 
heterophyllum contained in the last number of the 'Phytologist' 
(Phytol.
ii.
961), with which there is a species closely agreeing, on 
the Yorkshire side of the Tees, at Winch Bridge, above Middleton, 
in Teesdale, which is a district rich in this genus.
From the scales 
of the involucrum being reflexed, the absence of radical leaves, and 
the general habit of the plant, I have looked upon it as a form of um- 
bellatum, to which it appears more closely allied than to H.
murorum 
or H.
maculatum.
It may be a good species, but I should be glad if 
James Bladon, the author of the paper alluded to, or any other per- 
son, would point out the diff'erences between H.
heterophyllum and 
H. umbellatum.
The latter is of pretty common occurrence in the 
sandy districts about this city.

Note on Trichomanes speciosum.
By Edward Newman.
The curious facts handed me by Mr. Andrews, touching the longe- 
vity of the fronds of Trich6manes, and published in 1844, have in- 
duced me to keep a journal of a ie-w observations of my own; and 
bearing in mind the dictum of Sir J.
E. Smith, " that the slightest 
piece of information ought to be thankfully received," I now lay my 
journal before the readers of the 'Phytologisl.' However, let me first 
of all quote Mr. Andrews' interesting remarks.
" The formation of the young frond takes place about May ; the 
stem then gradually lengthens, without much development of the cir- 
cinate character of the frond, till September, when a more rapid growth 
takes place ; about November the full length of the stem is attained, 
but the pinnules are not perfectly formed, nor has the frond attained 
its full development until the autumn of the second year ; no dispo- 
sition to bear fruit is shown till the autumn of the third year, when 
the involucres appear, and the setae and capsules attain maturity in 
October." 
May 24, 1845.
â€” Received from Mr. Moore, of Glasnevin, a small 
plant of Trichomanes speciosum, bearing five small fronds, four of 
them (hereafter referred to, as Â«, h, d and e) nearly erect, the fifth 
(referred to as c) prostrate.
The two largest, h and e, appear healthy, 
their colour being vivid, and their ultimate divisions without any dis- 
coloration ; the remaining three, a, c and d, were considerably 
smaller; apparently older than the others, and exhibiting discolora- 
tion at the extremities of their pinnae.
The frond d, and the stipes 
of the frond h, are beset with numerous seedling Jungermanniae and 
mosses.
The flower-pot containing this plant is placed in a small, 
glazed apartment, and a drip of water so contrived as to keep the 
plant constantly moist.
June 24, 1845.
â€” The plant looks unhealthy ; it is partially covered 
with a white deposit from the water.
Removed the pot from the 
glazed house and placed it in a large milk-pan partially filled with 
broken flower-pots and earth : covered it with a common hand-glass 
that did not fit close.
December 24., 1845.
â€” The white deposit has disappeared.
The 
plant looks healthy: the smaller fronds, a, c and d, remain as before; 
the larger ones, h and e, have slightly increased in length : two inci- 
pient fronds, y* and y, have appeared at opposite extremities of the 
rhizoma : no water has touched the fronds since the 24th June, but 
there is an abundance of water in the pan, and the atmosphere aj)- 
1024 
pears saturated with moisture : seedling ferns, mosses and Junger- 
manniae growing freely.
May \, 1846.
â€” I discovered to my surprise that the prostrate frond 
c was unconnected with the rest of the plant : the rhizoma appeared 
io have rotted at the base of the frond, and a small portion, not larger 
than a mustard-seed, adhered to the frond.
I examined the frond 
very carefully when removed, and could not perceive that it exhibited 
any alteration from its state when first examined in May, 1845, al- 
though it appeared to have been lying prostrate without roots for 
twelve months.
I stuck it in an erect position into some earth under 
another hand-glass.
(It is as well to finish the history of this frond 
at once : it remained under cover until Midsummer, 1847, when I 
found attached to it a rhizoma, seven-eighths of an inch in length, and 
bearing two very minute fronds, neither of them an inch long: it was 
transplanted at this dale, and owing to neglect, subsequently died).
The young fronds,/ and ^, have partially expanded, they exceed the 
others in length : the state of the rest remains the same : something 
like the circinate ball which precedes the development of a frond has 
appeared at another point of the rhizoma: it is densely covered with 
filamentous scales : the rhizoma has elongated at this point.
June I, 1846.
â€” The apparent ball has developed itself, and it is 
evidently a young frond, h.
July 1, 1846.
â€” The frond, h, has partially unfolded itself, and is a 
small one.
August 1, 1846.
â€” The fronds, /and g are completely expanded, /* 
is nearly so ; a young frond, i, has made its appearance.
The others 
exhibit no change.
December 24, 1846.
â€” Two new fi-onds, k and I, have appeared.
June 24, 1847.
â€” The fronds, k and l, are greatly developed, parti- 
cularly k : h and i are completely expanded.
Separated the frond, 
d, with a penknife, taking with it a very small portion of rhizoma, 
and stuck it erect in the earth below the pot.
September 1, 1847.â€” After a temporary absence from home I found 
the interior of the glass much crowded with seedling ferns, the growth 
of which had been astonishingly rapid : removed the greater part of 
them : the young frond, k, exhibited discoloration at the extremities 
of its pinnules, as though decaying : two more fronds, m and n have 
appeared.
October 2.3, 1847.â€” The fronds, m and n, exhibit greatly elongated 
stipes: the frond ^' looks more healthy than on the 1st September, 
the discoloured extremities, however, remain.
This frond is ten 
1025 
inches in length.
The frond a appears as when the plant was receiv- 
ed two years and a half since, discoloured at its extremities : with 
these exceptions, none of the fronds, now eleven in number, exhibit 
any symptoms of decay.
There is no appearance of fructification.
From these records, trivial as they may appear to some, the endur- 
ing nature of the fronds of Trichomanes is established : the peculi- 
arity may be due in some measure to the treatment, but I believe it 
is mainly attributable to an innate character of the plant, which is 
thus truly entitled to the epithet of evergreen.

Observations on the Parasitical Nature of the Wiinanthacea, in 
reference to Mr. Mitten's paper on Thesium linopliyllum 
(Phytol.
ii.
807).
By J.
Decaisne.
Extracted from the 
'Comptes Rendus' for July, 1847, as translated in the 'Annals 
and Magazine of Natural History ' for September.
Since De Candolle established by ingenious observations and accre- 
dited by the authority of his name the separation of parasitic plants 
into two groups, physiologists have generally admitted it as a well- 
established law.
It is known in fact that the phanerogamous plants 
which are parasitic upon the stems of other vegetables have green 
leaves, while those upon roots do not possess true leaves, contain no 
green colouring matter, but are generally of a whitish, yellowish or 
violet colour; in other words, they appear blanched or sickly when 
compared to other plants : their leaves, or the scales with which their 
stems are provided, are generally without epidermic pores.
The ab- 
solute character of the law advanced by De Candolle has however 
been recently modified by the observation of Mr. W.
Mitten [Phytol.
ii.
807] of a plant (Thesium linophyllum) parasitic upon roots and 
nevertheless provided with green leaves.
The observation of Mr. Mitten immediately called to mind a fact 
I had long noticed, that is, the impossibility of cultivating plants be- 
longing to the group of the true Rhinanthaceae.
Wishing to intro- 
duce into cultivation the purple cow-wheat {Melampyrum arvense), I 
fi-equently sowed the seed, which however all perished a few days 
after their germination without my being able to account for this want 
of success.
The same applies to species of Pedicularis and Euphrasia: 
removed with care fi'om the field and transferred with every possible 
1026 
caution into our gardens these plants soon dry up, in a few hours 
they become black and so brittle that they appear to have been 
scorched.
Bearing in mind these facts, the question suggested itself, 
whether the uncuitivable Rhinanthaceae might not be parasitic plants; 
in fact, their rapid death in our gardens and their injurious effects 
upon the neighbouring plants, a fact well known to cultivators, led me 
to suspect their parasitic nature.
The observation which I have the 
honour to bring before the Academy settles this question.
The spe- 
cies of Alectorolophus, Melampyrum and Odontites are true parasitic 
plants which fix themselves to the roots of grasses, shrubs, or even 
trees, by numerous suckers.
These suckers are arranged on the 
branched and delicate rootlets of Melampyrum in the same manner as 
on the filaments of Cuscuta ; the parasitic rootlets are in close contact 
with the young roots of the plants upon which they feed ; the point 
of contact is indicated by a swelling.
I regret that I have not yet been able to verify the parasitic nature 
upon other species than those which occur in our fields.
I propose 
however to examine whether what I have observed in the plants of 
this neighbourhood will occur or not in analogous plants, or whether 
this phenomenon is so modified in them as to afford an explanation of 
the anomalies of structure I am about to point out.
In a memoir* presented to the Academy, M.
Duchartre described 
in a parasitic plant, Lathraea clandestina, a peculiar ligneous structure, 
the most prominent character of which is the absence of medullary 
rays : on the other hand, M.
Elie Brongniart in noticing this fact in his 
report on this paper wished to ascertain whether it did not occur in 
other plants belonging to the same class as L.
clandestina, and he 
found it in Melampyrum : nevertheless in pointing out the anomalous 
structure in these vegetables, MM.
Brongniart and Duchartre did not 
connect it with the fact of parasitism, but merely saw in it a relation 
of family.
However, this peculiar organization appears to me inti- 
mately connected with the parasitic nature of the plants, judging 
from the uniformity of structure and the black colour of the stems of 
Pedicularis, Castilleja, Cymbaria, Bartsia, Buchnera, which are all 
destitute, according to my observations, of medullary rays.
If parasitic plants assume a black tint mixed with blue on drying 
â€” if the absence of medullary rays is one of their attributes â€” and if 
these characters are connected with a special absorption of the nutri- 
tive juices, I may observe that these occur without exception in a

1027 
group of plants which no one has hitherto suspected of being parasites, 
1 mean the sundews, which are hkewise uncultivable.
But with re- 
gard to the species of Drosera there is another anomaly far more 
singular to be investigated, that of a dicotyledonous plant being 
parasitical upon a moss, if, as I suspect, the Sphagnum is necessary 
to the nutrition of the Drosera.
There still remains to ascertain the 
relation of causality between these characters of structure and para- 
sitism.
With respect to the peculiar coloration of the blackening juices 
which these parasitical vegetables contain, that is a question which 
belongs to chemistry.
In conclusion, the foregoing observations 
upon Melampyrum, Odontites and Alectorolophus explain clearly why 
it is impossible to cultivate these plants, which do not meet in the 
artificial soil of our gardens with the roots of those vegetables at 
whose expense they live ; it also throws some light in ray opinion 
upon the fact observed by agriculturists, that the Rhinanthacea3 exert 
an injurious effect upon the grasses and Cerealia.
Notice of ' An Experimental Inquiry into the cause of the Ascent 
and Descent of the Sap, with some observations upon the Nutri- 
tion of Plants ; and the cause of Endosmose and Exosmose.
By G.
Rainey, M.R.C.S.E., Demonstrator of Anatomy, and 
of Microscopic Anatomy, St. Thomas's Hospital.
London : 
Pamplin, 1847.' 
Our own observations on this little work will be very brief, and we 
shall express no opinion as to the value of the theory which Mr.
Rainey has broached.
The subject is yet in its infancy.
Notwith- 
standing the received and poetic version of the theory of sap, notwith- 
standing the more precise labours of our microscopists, the reflecting 
mind cannot but be struck with the paucity of observations and with 
the poverty of conclusions on a subject which in real interest almost 
rivals the circulation of the blood.
But in inverse ratio to the brevity 
of our remarks will be the length of our quotations : we wish to place 
in lucid order before our readers the whole of Mr. Rainey's remarks, 
claiming for these remarks a patient and attentive investigation, but 
by no means asserting that we have followed the author through his 
elaborate researches, or have checked his facts and found his 
reasoning conclusive.
We often observe the man of straw occupying 
the critic's rostrum and dispensing praise or blame as caprice may 
1028 
dictate but the ' Phytologist' has a reputation to support, and can- 
not afford to criticise at random.
It often, we may say generally, 
happens that the reviewer in these pages knows tenfold more of the 
subject than the author he reviews : in the present it is not so, and we 
will not assume a knowledge we do not possess.
The editorial obser- 
vations will therefore only serve to connect quotations, which we 
hope will induce our readers to possess themselves of the volume 
whence they are extracted.
Mr. Rainey begins thus.
" 1.
The fluid which vegetables imbibe from the soil on which 
they grow is generally called the ascending or crude sap.
" 2.
The crude sap, after having been elaborated in the vessels of a 
plant, and fitted for the development and production of new parts, is 
called the elaborated sap.
" 3.
The direction taken by the crude sap is always from the root 
towards the branches, whilst that of the elaborated sap may be either 
upwards or downwards, according as the process of elaboration is 
most active in the vessels of the roots, or in those of the leaves, 
" 4.
Besides the movement of these fluids, there is a distinct and 
separate motion of that within the cells, denominated ' Cyclosis,' in 
which case the contents of one cell move independently of those in 
the adjoining cells : this phenomenon, being a local and not a general 
operation, does not come under the consideration of the ascent and 
descent of the sajx 
" 5.
Before a precise explanation can be given, or a correct notion 
obtained, of the cause of the ascent of the crude sap, or of the ascent 
and descent of the elaborated fluid, the structures which each of these 
fluids traverses in its passage from one extremity of a plant to another, 
must be accurately determined and clearly demonstrated.
" 6.
The following experiments have been instituted and performed 
for the purpose of satisfactorily determining these points, of showing 
first, that the crude sap ascends along a tissue which chiefly exists 
between the cells, but which enters also into the structure of the more 
solid and permanent parts of a plant, and secondly, that the elaborat- 
ed fluid, both in its descent and ascent, passes along the ducts and 
spiral vessels.
" Experiment to show the structure occupied by the crude sap in 
its ascent and diffusion through all parts of a plant.
â€” 7.
The inferior 
extremity of a long branch of the Valeriana rubra was placed in an 
aqueous solution of bichloride of mercury, a short time after it had 
been removed from the plant, and its leaves had slightly shrunken 
1029 
from the evaporation of their water ; and it was found that, in the 
course of a few hours, it had absorbed a considerable quantity of the 
solution, and its leaves had recovered their former freshness and state 
of distension.
Next day, this branch absorbed less of the solution 
than on the preceding one, and the poisonous effects of the bichloride 
were now visible some way up the stem, also the lower leaves were 
partially attacked, having become discoloured and shrunken, but the 
unaffected parts of these leaves and of the other portions of the 
branch retained their natural freshness, and appeared quite healthy.
Thus the bichloride of mercury continued to destroy successive por- 
tions of the branch from day to day ; those parts of it to which the 
influence of the poison had not extended always remaining to all ap- 
pearance sound, and in some cases distinguishable from the affected 
ones by a line of demarcation more or less defined.
" 8.
After the solution had ascended into that part of the stem 
which was soft and contained but little ligneous matter, its diameter 
became very much contracted, from the collapsed state of its vessels 
and ceils, and was rendered so flexible as to be incapable of support- 
ing the sound parts above it, which, notwithstanding this altered and 
contracted state of the inferior portion of the branch, seemed perfectly 
healthy, and continued to receive an abundant supply of fluid.
The 
upper parts of this branch remained vegetating in the solution during 
a fortnight, although the lower ones were completely deprived of every 
trace of vitality, shewing that the passage of the fluid along the latter 
into the former is wholly independent of any vital contraction of the 
sap vessels, as was formerly supposed by the older physiologists.
" 9.
But in order to remove any doubt as to the correctness of this 
conclusion, a stem of Valerian was obtained, from which grew two 
long parallel branches of equal size, and a portion, fifteen inches in 
length, of one of them, was exposed to the action of boiling water dur- 
ing a quarter of an hour, after which the inferior extremity of the parent 
stem was placed in a weak solution of the bichloride of mercury for a 
fortnight.
During this time the process of vegetation was found to bfÂ» 
quite as active in the upper part of the branch which had been acted 
upon by the boiling water, as in that which had been carefully pro- 
tected from the action of the heat." â€” p.
2. 
On repeating the first of these experiments Mr. Rainey found that 
in some plants the process of vegetation ceased immediately on sepa- 
rating them from their stems; others vegetate only at one p^od of 
the year : he also found that in cases when a plant ceased to vegetate 
in the bichloride it also ceased to vegetate in water : when a plant will

not vegetate either in the bichloride or in water its leaves wither from 
the evaporation of their moisture, the plant not possessing the power 
to absorb more fluid, thus showing that mere evaporation is insufficient 
to cause the ascent of sap.
When plants retain their vitality in the 
bichloride the quantity absorbed is in proportion to the vigour of the 
leaves, proving the ascent of sap to be dependent on some vital ope- 
ration.
No bichloride can be found in the portion of any branch 
situated above the junction of the dead and living portions, which 
both stems and leaves below this contain abundance, so that as the 
water which suppled the living part " was derived from the solution, 
a process of decomposition of the bichloride must have been continu- 
ally going on at the union of the dead with the living part of the 
branch all the time it was vegetating in the solution, by which the 
bichloride is converted into pro-chloride and chlorine, the former, 
being insoluble, remains in the vegetable tissue, whilst the latter, 
being set free, is indicated by the change which it produces in the 
colour of the plant; the water of this portion of the solution being 
thus freed of all its bichloride, ascends into the living parts of the 
branch to nourish them, and in this manner they receive their supply 
of water from this poisonous solution the same as if the extremity of 
the branch had been kept in water, or the entire plant had been de- 
riving it from the soil on which it grew : so that a plant, whilst vege- 
tating in a solution of the bichloride of mercury, may be distinguished 
into three parts, the living, the dying, and the part completely dead ; 
the first contains the water of the solution deprived of all its bichloride, 
the second the portion of solution in which the bichloride is in the act 
of being decomposed, and the third the solution unchanged." 
" 13.
Now, as in the plants thus treated, the water of the solution, 
which had been taken up into and nourished the living part of each 
branch, was in reality its crude sap ; and as the same passages which â€¢ 
conveyed this water, now deprived of its bichloride, must have con- 
tained the solution whilst this substance was undergoing decomposi- 
tion, and therefore whilst it contained some of the bichloride un- 
changed ; to detei-mine the part along which the crude sap ascends, 
we have only to ascertain the precise situation of the bichloride of 
mercury and the tissue in which it is lodged." â€” ^5.
5. 
The author next explains an experiment in which the bichloride 
has been converted into an insoluble bisulphuret by a reference to 
plates which we cannot transfer to our pages ; and concludes this 
branch of the inquiry by some remarks on the quantity of intercellu- 
lar tissue contained in different parts of the same plant, and on the 
1031 
impossibility of discovering the pores of this tissue by means of the 
microscope.
^^ Tlie cause of the ascent of the Crude Sap. â€” 20.
Having now- 
shown that the crude sap ascends in a porous tissue, universally 
diffused through all parts of a plant, and occupying in greater or less 
abundance the intervals between the cells, there will be but little 
difficulty in comprehending the mode of its ascent and general 
diflfusion.
If it be admitted that the crude sap is of less density 
than the fluid contained within the cells, and, as the former is derived 
directly from the earth, whilst the latter is mixed with various soluble 
substances elaborated within the cells, doubtless must be so, it will 
then be apparent that the position of the crude sap, in a tissue 
situated all around the cells, is the best possible one for favouring its 
passage by endosmose through their walls into their interior, and for 
causing the intercellular tissue in the immediate vicinity of these cells 
thus to be exhausted of its fluid.
" 21.
The intercellular- tissue being porous and generally continu- 
ous, must of necessity, if deprived of its fluid in any one part, attract, 
in consequence of its capillarity, that which is contained in the tissue 
of the surrounding parts, and thereby cause the crude sap to move 
successively from one situation to another in a direction dependent 
upon the position of that portion of the intercellular tissue which is 
being most rapidly exhausted ; so that when the tissue situated be- 
tween the cells in the leaves is rapidly being deprived of its crude 
sap in consequence of the passage of this fluid by endosmose from 
the exterior to the interior of the cells, this portion of tissue will at- 
tract the water from that situated around the cells in the petioles of 
these leaves, which, becoming more or less exhausted, will attract in 
like manner the water from the intercellular tissue of the stem, and 
thus the crude sap will be drawn up successively from one part of 
the stem to another, until the intercellular tissue in the root, becom- 
ing deprived of a part of its water, will re-fill itself by attracting the 
water from the earth through the porous cuticle which covers the 
radicles : or, if it be a branch vegetating with its extremity placed in 
a solution of the bichloride of mercury, as in the experiment first re- 
lated, the intercellular tissue at its cut extremity will attract the solu- 
tion from the vessel in which it is placed." â€” p.
9. 
Besides its office of subserving the ascent of the sap, the intercel- 
lular tissue is the means of its lateral diffusion.
The cells of the me- 
dullary rays are longest in their horizontal diameter, and are sur- 
rounded by intercellular tissue.
1032 
" Undue distention of the cells is prevented by the constant eva- 
poration which takes place from the leaves, and a larger quantity of 
fluid is by this means caused to pass through a plant to furnish it 
with a sufficient supply of those substances which it requires to ob- 
tain from the soil.
This process, being thus accessory to the function 
of nutrition, is aided by the stomata, and also by the abundant pu- 
bescence present on most leaves, and especially on young leaf-buds.
Although this evaporation, called sometimes transpiration, must aid 
indirectly the ascent of the sap, yet of itself it is altogether insuffici- 
ent to cause it to ascend ; the sap ceasing to ascend as soon as the 
cells lose their power of elaborating their contents, and thereby keep- 
ing up the physical conditions necessary for the continuance of 
endosraose." â€” p.
10.
The author here records experiments tried on portions of Anthris- 
cus vulgaris and Lapsana communis, some of which were placed in 
solutions of gum arable of different degrees of strength, and others in 
water: the results obtained were, in the stronger solution the plants 
ceased to absorb several days sooner than in the weaker, and in this 
several days sooner than in pure water.
"25.
A solution of sugar acts differently to that of gum.
If trans- 
parent vegetables, when placed in a solution of sugar, be examined 
by the microscope, the effect is seen to be very remarkable.
No 
plant which I have seen exhibits this effect better than the Nitella.
Almost the instant a piece of this plant in which the cyclosis is ac- 
tive is brought into contact with the solution, its internal membrane 
becomes partially and suddenly torn from the enclosing cell-wall, its 
contents escape, and the cyclosis ceases.
" 26.
The experiments first described show that the ascending sap 
is attracted and not propelled ; and therefore the explanation of the 
cause of the ascent of the sap given by Dutrochet, as the consequence 
of the passage of fluid from the earth into the roots by endosmose, 
must, in these instances, fail.
Nor is the explanation advanced by 
some physiologists, by whom it is supposed that the crude sap as- 
cends from cell to cell by endosmose, assuming that the contents of 
the cell above are always more dense than those of the cell below, 
less at variance with the facts shown by these experiments.
As in 
the stems whose vitality had been destroyed by the bichloride of 
mercury, along which the sap, or rather the fluid which furnishes the 
sap, has been shown to ascend with perfect facility, there could not 
jiossibly exist that di(fei*ence in the density of the contents of the 
cells at different parts of the stem necessary to ensure the continued 
1033 
passage of the fluid of one cell into another by endosmose during a 
period of a fortnight or three weeks.
For this imaginary state of 
progressive inspissation of the contents of the cells, according to their 
relative distance from the roots, could only be the result of a vital 
process ; and therefore, if the ascent of the sap depended upon it, 
that ascent must immediately cease in any part of a stem as soon as 
its vitality is destroyed.
" 27.
The preceding explanation of the cause of the ascent of the 
sap being made to depend upon the foliaceous organs, pre-supposes 
that they exist before the sap can begin to ascend.
This, without 
doubt, is true, although in some cases it may seem not to be so, as 
these organs appear, at some seasons, from their minuteness and im- 
perfect state of development, to be entirely absent ; yet, notwithstand- 
ing, their existence is unquestionable and their function similar to 
that of the matured leaves.
These parts, before they acquire the 
general characters of leaves, are more or less concealed and denomi- 
nated leaf-buds ; their form is conical.
They consist of a central 
axis composed of cells and a few vessels continuous with those around 
the pith of the branch on which they are situated, and surrounded 
by rudimentary leaves.
The cells resemble those of the pith in hav- 
ing very thin cell-walls and but little intercellular tissue, and in the 
external cells generally containing starch granules or some other so- 
lid matter.
Now, as these germinating bodies (the leaf-buds) require 
a supply of water the instant their germination commences, and the 
solid material within their cells becomes elaborated and a solution 
formed, that is, the instant the conditions required for endosmose are 
set up, it is necessary that they should be situated near to a reservoir 
of that fluid : this is efl'ected by their connexion with, and their prox- 
imity to, the pith ; so that the ofiice of the pith is most probably to 
contain between and within its cells that portion of water which the 
leaf-buds require the moment their transformation into leaves com- 
mences, and before their development is sufficiently advanced to en- 
able them, by the absorbing power of their own intercellular tissue, 
to absorb it from the surrounding tissue, in the manner described 
when treating of the ascent of the sap into the matured leaves.
Hence the reason why the pith is so universally connected with leaf- 
buds, and why it occupies the central portion of the ascending axis 
and those parts derived from it, and is absent in the roots." â€” p.
12.
The author, considering he has proved the ascent of crude sap in 
a tissue surrounding the cells as well as entering the structure of 
1034 
their walls, next proceeds to explain the descent and ascent of elabo- 
rated sap.
" Experiments performed upon Living Plants, with a view to de- 
termine the Passages which convey the Elaborated Sap. â€” 29.
In the 
winter of 1844, three suckers of lilac, of two years' growth, all spring- 
ing from the same root, were severally girt with a piece of copper 
wire, drawn as tight as it would admit of without cutting into the 
bark, and the eflfect was carefully watched until the spring of 1847.
" 30.
In the spring of 1845 it was observed that the budding com- 
menced at the same time in these suckers as in some others growing 
from the same root ; and that during the summer and early part of 
the autumn no difference could be distinguished in the state of the 
vegetation of these shoots, the girt always appearing as healthy as the 
ungirt ones.
In the winter, one of the girt suckers was cut for the 
purpose of examination ; the other two were allowed to remain.
The part of this sucker above the ligature had received a layer of new 
wood of the ordinary thickness, also an addition to the bark : that 
included in it retained of course its former diameter, but had under- 
gone an alteration, a thin layer of wood having been added to that of 
last year, and the bark having become thinner than it was before, in 
consequence of being compressed between the new wood and the 
ligatux'e.
The part below the ligature was smaller than that above, and 
had received a new layer both of wood and of bark, but both much 
thinner than those above the ligature.
In the immediate vicinity of 
the wire the shoot was swollen both above and below, but more so 
above than below.
"31.
In the spring of 1846, the two constricted suckers which re- 
mained were observed to begin budding at the same time as some 
other suckers growing from the same root; and during the spring and 
summer no very material difference could be distinguished in their 
states of vegetation.
The leaves of the constricted suckers appearing 
perhaps a little yellower than those of the unconstricted ones, but in 
all other respects they had the same aspect.
The part of the stem 
close to the ligature was swollen both above and below it ; and 
although the stem above the wire had increased considerably in 
diameter, the part below it had undergone no increase in thickness.
" In the early part of the summer, one of these suckers was cut and 
examined with the microscope, but the other was allowed to remain 
for future observation.
The part of this sucker above the ligature had 
received a layer of new wood, also an addition to its bark : that in- 
cluded in it had undergone a change similar to the one mentioned in 
1035 
the last experiment ; but the part below the ligature had undergone 
no change whatever : not the slightest addition had been made either 
to the wood or to the bark.
" 32.
The sucker which was left, the only remaining one, still con- 
tinued to grow, increasing in size above the ligature, but not in the 
least below it.
Its leaves were as large, and with the exception of a 
slight yellowish tint, appeared as healthy, and remained as long at- 
tached to the plant as those of the suckers which sprang from the 
same root, but had not been experimented upon.
"33.
In the spring of the next year (1847), at the period when all 
the leaf-buds of the unconstricted suckers began to swell and develope 
themselves, those of the constricted one rapidly withered.
Up to this 
time they were as large, and appeared as healthy, as those of the other 
suckers.
"At the commencement of June (1847) this sucker was cut and ex- 
amined.
The part of the stem above the ligature had received a layer 
of wood, and an addition of bark to that of the preceding year.
The 
part included in the ligature it was not considered necessary to ex- 
amine.
The part below the ligature had received no addition whatever 
to the wood of the last year, and the whole thickness of the stem had 
lost its natural aspect, appearing brown and destitute of vitality, 
whilst the part above the ligature was of a greenish colour, and had a 
healthy appearance." â€” p, 15.
From these experiments the author concludes, as the ligature al- 
lows the ascent of the crude sap without permitting the elaborated 
sap to pass below it, â€” the formation of wood and bark going on 
above after it has ceased below the ligature â€” that the ascending and 
descending fluids pass by different channels, and that the elaborated 
sap does not descend along the intercellular tissue ; and farther, that 
w^hen the new wood does not extend below the ligature and does not 
communicate with the root, vegetation ceases in the entire shoot, first 
below, then above the ligature ; proving the layers of wood to be in- 
dependent of each other, and also proving the necessity for each 
layer's having a separate connexion with the roots.
Seeing the de- 
scending sap does not pass along the intercellular tissue, and seeing, 
moreover, that the cells do not communicate with each other, the 
descent of elaborated sap must take place through the vessels, 
which are continuous passages extending from the leaves to the roots, 
and having large and well-defined openings of communication with 
each other, the anatomical requirements of tubes for the transmission 
of fluids.
The paragraphs which follow those whence the foregoing 
1036 
summary is drawn^ arc penned to show the best treatment of leaves 
or petals prior to a microscopical examination ; the author then 
proceeds â€” 
" 39, The vascular bundles of a leaf are continued into its petiole, 
and from thence they pass into the stem, where they become dispersed, 
some are continuous with the spiral vessels situated around the pith, 
and others with the vessels of the layer of wood last formed.
These 
vessels, in their passage through the bark, are contained in large 
canals, situated between the liber and the cuticle, in which they appear 
to lie naked.
Some of the vessels in the petiole do not pass directly 
into the stem, but either become intermixed with a quantity of loosely 
connected cells, or anastomose with the vessels of the adjacent 
bundles ; these can be very well seen in the fig-tree, by making a 
vertical section through the petiole at its insertion into the stem.
The 
canals which transmit the vessels appear to be continuous with spaces 
of various sizes, continued all along the bark of the stem, and situated 
at different distances from the surface.
Their walls or immediate 
boundaries consist of rows of cells piled one row upon another; some- 
times they are smooth and at others they are covered with small 
whitish granules.
Many of the passages seem to become filled up 
more or less completely with clusters of new cells, which have a pale 
greyish tint, and resemble wood cells in their form and general charac- 
ters ; they are also acted upon in a manner similar to such cells by the 
tincture of iodine.
In order to trace distinctly the passage of the 
vessels of the petiole into those of the wood, thin, vertical and hori- 
zontal sections must be made through the attachment of the petiole with 
the stem, and afterwards treated with acetic acid in the manner describ- 
ed.
As the vessels descend from the attachment of the petiole into 
the wood, they lose somewhat the character of true spirals, and become 
more like barred ducts.
Probably a difference in the mechanical 
conditions under which vessels are placed in the leaves and in the 
stem, renders it necessary that the former should be more perfect 
spirals than the latter.
" 40.
The manner in which vessels are formed from cells can be 
very well seen by examining plants during their growth, and contrast- 
ing the same structures at difTerent periods of their development.
The 
petals of the potato, taken a little before the flowers have expanded, 
and previously rendered transparent by the employment of acetic acid, 
show well the manner in which vessels increase in length.
In the 
colourless parts of these petals, bundles of long but very narrow cells 
may be observed marking out the place for the future vessels ; and, at 
1037 
the part where these cells are continuous with the vessels, extremely 
minute dark points are visible in the walls of the former.
These points 
coalescing, form a number of lines, indicating the spaces between the 
coils of the spiral fibre in the perfect vessel.
After several of 
these cells have been thus transformed into vessels, a new joint is 
formed, which at first lies merely in contact with the extremity of a 
previously finished joint, but afterwards communicates with it in the 
manner before described, and thus a vessel is increased in length by 
the successive addition of new joints.
At first, the marking of many 
of the recently formed vessels is so faint as not to be distinguishable, 
excepting by the best lenses of a high magnifying power, but it gradu- 
ally increases in distinctness as the spiral fibre becomes developed." 
The author then explains, by means of a reference to his plates, 
that the larger vessels acquire their diameter by the union of cells, the 
diameter of the vessel depending on the number of cells united : he 
remarks that " the spiral fibre can be observed to become developed 
in the walls of the cells ; " this does not appear very obvious even 
w'ith the assistance of plates, and without that assistance we doubt 
our ability to make it manifest to our readers.
The fibre commences 
in a minute oval spot in the centre of which a "thinning" makes its 
appearance and increases continually in a transverse direction to the 
axis of the vessel, until it joins other similar spots, forming a transverse 
bar; a series of such bars frequently occupies the breadth of a single 
cell without extending at all to the collateral cells : when these lines 
or transversely extended spots become continuous with those of the 
collateral cells and form several circles round the vessels, a spiral fibre 
is the result, and the vessel is called a " spiral" vessel ; but when the 
appearance is bar-like the vessel is called " reticulated." The author 
concludes that as vessels are made up of cells ; as the same structure 
is common to vessels and cells; and as vessels contain a fluid and in 
many cases a solid material ; it is therefore probable that the functions 
of cells and vessels are analogous, and that vessels receive their fluids 
by endosmose from adjacent intercellular tissue and perhaps from 
surrounding cells.
"45.
Now, each cell being isolated, and without any communica- 
tion with those in its vicinity, the pressure exerted upon the inner 
surface of its walls, in consequence of the passage of a larger quantity 
of fluid into it by endosmose, than can escape from it in the same 
time by exosmose (to which pressure the enlargement of the cells is 
due), is altogether local and limited ; and thus the development of one 
part of the cellular system of a plant is independent of that of another

part.
Vessels on the contrary, being a species of cell, designed to 
elaborate materials, like as do the ordinary cells, but, for the pro- 
duction of remote parts, and afterwards being intended to convey 
their elaborated contents to the place of destination, require that free 
communications should exist between them, in order that the fluid 
elaborated and accumulated more particularly in one part of the vas- 
cular system, may, by the force of distension, be propelled into all the 
other parts communicating with it.
Hence, when the process of 
elaboration is most active in the vessels of the leaves, and a quantity 
of fluid, proportionate to the activity of this process [i.
e. to the quan- 
tity of soluble matter which is being formed) is, by endosmose, passing 
into them from the adjacent intercellular tissue, this fluid cannot fail 
to be forced into those vessels which are receiving less fluid from the 
surrounding paits ; for instance, into those of the petioles of the leaves, 
and from these vessels some of the elaborated sap must pass into the 
vessels around the pith to furnish the material necessary for the pro- 
duction of starch, or other nutrient matter for the leaf-buds of the en- 
suing year, but the greater quantity will pass into the ducts of the 
wood (these being continuous with the vessels descending from the 
petioles), for the production of new wood and new bark.
It is possible 
that some part of the contents of the vessels, during their passage 
through the cellular spaces in the bark, may escape, and that to this 
is due the granular matter, or the clusters of cambium cells found in 
these spaces.
But the most probable cause of the passage of the 
elaborated sap from the vessels and ducts must be looked for in the 
endosmic action of the surrounding cells.
These cells in vegetables 
performing probably a function similar to that which epithelial cells 
perform in animal structures, especially in those structures which are 
but sparingly supplied with blood, such for instance as cartilage.
In 
animals a thin membrane called hasement, or limitary membrane, is 
generally situated between the vessels containing the nutrient fluid, â€” 
the blood-vessels, â€” and the epithelial cells, to which physiologists 
ascribe more or less of importance.
In vegetables no such membrane 
is present ; but in the ligneous parts of a plant the walls of the ducts 
are provided with minute nucleated cellules generally of an hexagonal 
figure, and disposed in the form of a tessellated epithelium.
Where 
the vessels of the petiole become continuous with these ducts, the 
spiral fibre gets more and more imperfect in proportion as this dis- 
position of cellules makes its appearance: hence, as the vessels of 
wood must be confessed to have a more active function, in reference 
to the production of new parts, than those of the petiole of leaves (the 
1039 
office of these being only to convey the fluid elaborated in the leaves 
to the ducts of the wood), this apparatus of cellules may be inferred to 
perform some function connected with the especial organization of 
new wood and bark, as yet unknown.
" 46.
Perhaps the spiral fibre of the vessels of leaves, besides tend- 
ing to prevent the dissipation of their fluid by evaporation â€” and thus 
keeping up a greater degree of distension than would be required in 
the ordinary cells, â€” may confer also upon these vessels a resiliency and 
elasticity advantageous in regulating the pressure upon their contents, 
and the passage of the fluid along them.
"47.
That the vessels of the leaves do elaborate a fluid, and con- 
duct it from thence into the branches, stem, and roots, for the pro- 
duction of new wood and new bark, is proved by the fact of these 
structures completely ceasing to be formed, where the descent of the 
elaborated fluid is prevented by ligature, whilst they are produced in 
the ordinary quantity in the stem above the constriction ; for, if the 
intercellular tissue, or the ordinary cells, and not the vessels, had been 
the elaboratories and conductors of the descending sap, these two 
structures, the intercellular tissue, and the cells situated above the 
ligature being so much, and so closely connected with the same 
structures below it, would still have allowed of the descent of a por- 
tion of the elaborated sap, as one of them, the intercellular tissue, al- 
lows the free ascent of the crude sap, and the growth of the stem 
would not have been so completely arrested below the wire whilst it 
was going on uninterruptedly above it.
The layer of wood and bark 
of the sucker, which had been cut at the end of the first year, being 
much thinner below than above the ligature, was the consequence of 
the constriction of the newly formed vessels at the girt part, by the 
pressure of the gradually increasing layer of new wood on one side, and 
the wire on the other.
And the circumstance of there being, in the 
other sucker, no addition whatever made to the wood and bark below 
the ligature during the second year of its application, proceeded from 
the entire closure of these vessels by the continued increase of this 
pressure, so that now no sap could descend below the constricted 
part.
And the fact observable in the same sucker, of the sap elabo- 
rated in the leaves of 1846 not being permitted to descend below the 
ligature applied in 1844, proves that there are no collateral or anas- 
tomosing channels between the layers of wood of separate years, ca- 
pable of conducting the descending sap, although there is no inter- 
ruption whatever to the passage and lateral diffiision of the ascending 
sap.
It shows also that the descent and the ascent of the sap must 
1040 
takiB place through a very different system of parts, the descent of the 
elaborated sap being limited to one direction and confined only to 
one part of a plant, whilst the crude sap, in addition to its passage 
upwards, is diffused throughout its entire substance.
Now, there is 
no other system of organs in plants, excepting vessels, which are ca- 
pable of thus limiting the passage of the elaborated sap ; nor is there 
any one but the intercellular tissue (that is, the tissue filling up the 
intervals between the cavities of the cells) which can allow the crude 
sap to have such an universal diffusion.
" 48.
Now, as long as the process of elaboration is going on most 
actively in the leaves and other foliaceous organs, and the material 
elaborated is disposed of in the parts which are situated below them, 
that is, nearer the roots, the direction taken by the elaborated sap 
along the vessels must be downwards, and thus it ought to continue 
until these organs have accomplished all the purposes for which they 
were intended, until, after having completed their own development, 
they have provided for the propagation of the species by the produc- 
tion of seed.
In this case the process of elaboration is first employed 
in forming cells, and afterwards in depositing within them solid mat- 
ter for the nutrition of the germs at some future period.
As the pro- 
cess of deposition advances, the conditions become less and less 
favourable for endosmose, and after the cells have become full, these 
conditions cease to exist, and no more fluid is attracted into the in- 
tercellular tissue surrounding them : that which they did contain eva- 
porates, and the seed, as well as those parts whose function had been 
subservient to its growth and maturation, become so altered in their 
physical characters as to unfit them for being retained any longer on 
the plant, until also a provision has been made for the leaf-buds of 
the ensuing year, by a deposition of starch or some similar substance 
in the vessels and cells of the stems and roots.
Hence, if the root of 
a vine be dug up in the winter, the cells and vessels situated in the 
outer layer of wood are found filled with starch granules ; if in the 
spring, after it has ceased bleeding, as it is termed, and the leaves 
have appeared, the quantity of starch in these vessels and cells will 
have very much diminished, and at a still later period it will be found 
almost to have disappeared ; and lastly, until a deposit has been 
formed of finely granular matter around the last year's wood.
This 
deposit is contained in minute square cells, compressed in the direc- 
tion of a line extending from the centre to the circumference of the 
stem, and forming collectively a dark-coloured ring all around the 
last year's layer of wood, by which a thin transverse section made in 
1041 
the winter can be distinguished by the microscope from one cut at 
any other period.
This deposit being formed in the autumn, may be 
called the autumnal deposit.
This is one of the earhest parts in 
which, at the commencement of spring, a process of elaboration is 
seen to begin : as this process is going on, the granular matter disap- 
pears, and the cells become of an irregular figure and filled with 
fluid : still later these cells become broken up, and their place occu- 
pied by vessels and ligneous cells.
The distension of these cells 
with fluid, and their consequent breaking up, is the cause of that 
loose connexion between the wood and the bark, so remarkable in the 
branches of most trees at the spring of the year.
The foliaceous 
organs having made these provisions for the future, and fulfilled all 
the purposes for which they were designed, now become useless; and 
the process of elaboration ceasing in their cells and vessels, they at- 
tract no more crude sap, become withered, and unfit to be retained 
on the tree, and are therefore shed ; and the plant experiences a state 
of repose, the duration and completeness of which varies in different 
kinds of plants." â€” p.
27.
Mr. Rainey then proceeds to explain the ascent of elaborated sap.
It having been ascertained that starch is deposited in the roots while 
the leaves are in active operation, and that this starch is undoubtedly 
designed for the supply of leaf-beads ; it becomes necessary j^rÂ«^, that 
the starch or its elements be so changed in physical properties as to 
be capable of being conducted to the part requiring to be nourished; 
and secondly, that they be so propelled as to reach such parts.
The 
author's idea is that the starch is dissolved in the water imbibed fi-om the 
earth by capillary attraction, and that this supply continues to press 
upwards the fluid already in the vessels of the stem, branches, and 
finally of the developing leaf- buds.
Tliis seems to require fiuther ex- 
planation : the ascent of fluid in a previously empty capillary tube is 
supposed to be caused by its very emptiness ; load a sponge with water 
and capillary attraction ceases : squeeze out the water and it recom- 
mences immediately : on the same principle is it not requisite that the 
sap already in the branches and buds should escape before capillary 
attraction can act so powerfully at the root as to drive all upwards in 
the way described ?
We merely suggest this for the author's conside- 
ration : we do not venture to ground an objection to his views on this 
seemingly insufficient explanation.
The author himself is aware that 
the plant with unexpanded leaves has no means of getting rid of the 
superfluous water, and he says that in consequence the vessels become 
distended.
When an incision is made in the bark (especially of the 
1042 
vine) in the spring of the year, the flow of fluid is most copious, and 
this may not only prove that tlie vessels are unusually loaded with 
fluid at that season, but by emptying the vessels may set up a capil- 
laiy attraction from the roots upwards.
The remaining chapters of this little brochure are entitled, " Nutri- 
tion of Plants " and " O71 the cause of Endosmose and Exosmose : " 
they will abundantly repay an attentive perusal, and we have already 
extracted so largely that our article has far exceeded the space 
we can conveniently afford it in the concluding number of the year.
The low price at which the essay is published places it within the reach 
of every one who feels an interest in the subject, and we therefore re- 
commend our readers to procure it for themselves.
In conclusion, we cannot refrain from animadverting on the excessive 
badness of the punctuation, which pei-petually renders the author's 
meaning doubtful, and sometimes destroys it altogether : in our ex- 
tracts we have taken the liberty of altering this in more than a hundred 
instances, substituting commas for colons, semicolons for full points, 
and striking out commas : in doing this we hope we have always re- 
tained the author's meaning.
We recommend Mr. Rainey on ftiture 
occasions to trust this matter to his printer: no compositor, even 
though a boy, in the first year of his apprenticeship, could exhibit 
such ignorance of the principles of punctuation.

JNote on Centaurea Jacea, Linn.
By Edwin Lees, Esq., F.L.S.
Since writing my observations on the radiant-flowered variety of 
C. nigra I have been favoured with a specimen of the true C.
Jacea, 
from Altona, in Denmark, kindly sent me by my worthy friend, the 
Rev. Andrew Bloxam, incumbent of Twycross, Leicestershire, so well 
known to British botanists by his acute observations of species, and 
observations of new plants, as well as by his useful Fasciculus of the 
British Rubi.
This specimen, I am happy to say, shows at once the 
complete distinctness of C.
Jacea from C.
nigra, and confirms the ac- 
curacy of Sir J.
E. Smith in his statement that the calyx of the latter 
is " essentially different " from the former.
None of the involucral 
scales have the black, ciliated appendage so conspicuous and charac- 
teristic in C.
nigra, but their summits are scariose, of a deep chest- 
nut brown, at once justifying the appellation of " Brown-radiant knap- 
weed.
The outer scales are scarcely more than fringed at the upper 
1043 
margin, succeeded by others irregularly torn, while the innermost 
terminate in an orbicular, deeply-divided lobe, jagged in a very irre- 
gular manner.
Thus the difference of structure as well as colour of 
the involucral scales is seen at a glance, when the two plants are 
compared together.
This, then, is the point to attend to, and not 
merely the radiant flowers.
The latter are obvious enough in Jacea, 
though in my specimen by no means so large as in the radiant variety 
of C.
nigra.
Radical leaves are wanting in my specimen from Denmark, the up- 
per ones are narrower, sharper pointed, and much less rough than in 
C. nigra, in fact almost smooth, lineai'-lanceolate, sessile, with a sin- 
gle tooth near the base.
I can say nothing with regard to the seed- 
down.
I have never met with British specimens of C.
Jacea, and Sussex 
is the only county where the true plant appears to have been ga- 
thered by Mr. Borrer.
If, however, collectors will attend to the invo- 
lucral scales rather than the radiant flowers, they may probably be 
rewarded by finding it elsewhere.

Account of a few days' Ramble among the Mountains of Cumberland 
and Westmoreland.
By James Backhouse, Jun., Esq.
Leaving Carlisle by an early train on the morning of the 2nd of 8th 
mo.
(August), we stopped at the village of Shap, and soon found our- 
selves upon the wild moors on our way to Hawes Water.
Crossing 
the sequestered valley of Swindale, which is finely shut in by the 
mountains at the upper part, we reached the lake near its head, after 
descending through Naddle Forest, which skirts its eastern shore for 
some distance.
Hawes Water produces Lobelia Dortmanna and 
Isoetes lacustris, in common with most of the lakes in the district: 
Alchemilla alpina grew almost down to the waters' edge, and Saxifraga 
azoides began to gild the margins of the mountain streamlets.
Bend- 
ing our course up the deep valley Mardale, we reached " Small Water 
Tarn ; " on the rocks between it and Blea Water we saw Oxyria reni- 
foi-mis, Asplenium viride and Hieracium Lawsoni.
From Blea Water 
we climbed to the top of High Street Mountain, which rises im- 
mediately above it, and continued along its ridge until we passed 
Hays Water, when we descended and followed a mountain path 
which led us into the Kirkstone road, near Brothers Water.
After a 
refreshing night's rest at the comfortable inn in Patterdale, we ascended 
Helvellyn to the Red Tarn, round which we passed, finding Juncus 
triglumis, Eriophorum polystachion, var.
elegans (Bab.), and some 
fine specimens of the large form of Carex rigida.
On the Striding 
edge we met with Cerastiura alpinum, Oxyria reniformis, Saxifiaga 
oppositifolia, Hieracium diaphanum and Hieracium nigrescens of 
Babington.
From the top of Helvellyn we descended to Wythburn, 
where we passed the night.
The streams on the western side of the 
mountain abound with Epilobium alsinifolium.
The next morning 
our route lay by Harrop Tarn and Blea Tarn, to the edge of Borrow- 
dale : descending opposite to Eagle Crag, we bent our steps up a 
deep valley, the cliffs on each side of which were fine and imposing; and 
the dark Bow Fell with his head bathed in cloud, formed a fine centre- 
piece to the picture.
On the rocky summit of Glaramara we found 
Hieracium alpinum in its genuine foim, with entire leaves, long silky 
1045 
pubescence, and lax outer involucral scales ; Saxifraga oppositi folia, 
Carcx rigida (usual size) and a very large form of Salix herbacea, were 
also on its craggy sides.
Keeping along the mountain ridge, we 
passed a fine ravine, meeting with scattered plants of Hieracium 
alpinum almost to its edge, but immediately after leaving it, the rocks 
produced H.
nigrescens, which seems a veiy distinct species, and may 
easily be distinguished from H.
alpinum at some distance by its black 
(or very dark) heads of flower: its leaves are slightly notched, 
and the pubescence of the whole plant is shorter and less silky, the 
outer involucral scales are not lax, and the yellow of the corolla is a 
shade darker; we saw no instance of its bearing more than a single 
flower on each stem, although some of the plants had from four to 
eight or ten stems from one root.
Here we noticed again scattered 
plants of Juncus triglumis in stony, wet places.
We kept on this ridge 
till we came to a little cluster of nameless tarns, when we gradually 
descended, rounding the head of Borrowdale, above a deep gorge im- 
mediately under the frowning cliff" of Great End, to a solitary moun- 
tain lake called Sprinkling Tarn : the stream flowing from this lake 
led us to the Stye-head Tarn near the top of the imposing pass be- 
tween Borrowdale and Wastdale.
To the latter valley we bent our 
course amidst clouds, wind and rain, and after a rough descent down 
the side of Great Gavel we reached the farm-house at Wastdale, where 
we were greeted by a kind friend who had come to this wild spot to 
join us in our ramble.
The following morning the mountains were 
almost buried in cloud, but as we were each provided with a pocket- 
compass, we determined to try Scawfell Pike : cloud and mist soon 
enveloped us, and the violence of the wind was such that we were 
glad to obtain temporary shelter in a hole among the rugged rocks on 
the top of Lingmell ; after a hard climb we reached the top of the 
Pike, where we rested awhile, and then carefully descended, having to 
face the blast.
Anxious to avoid the great ravine of Mickledore, we 
got too far to the north, and found ourselves amongst high crags and 
tumbled rocks near the head of a grand ravine, down the perpendicu- 
lar side of which a mountain stream bounded with unbroken fall from 
a great elevation.
Finding ourselves completely " lost," we applied 
to our compasses, as little or nothing could be seen from the density 
of the cloud, and discovered that we were going exactly in the op- 
posite direction from that which we intended ; of course we turned 
directly back again, and slowly reascended the ridge above us : the 
stormy wind from which we had been sheltered when out of our way, 
again burst upon us with great violence, accompanied by heavy rain ; 
Vol. II.

1046 
umbrellas became useless, one being broken to pieces, leaving only 
the iron rod for a walking stick : soaked to the skin we pursued our 
dreary way amid the cloud guided by the compass only, and before 
very long were glad to find ourselves on a grassy ridge similar to the 
one we had ascended ; after a while we emerged from the cloud, and 
soon made our way down to our resting-place.
The prospect was 
brighter the next morning, and gleams of sunshine enlivened our path 
up the rival height of Scawfell, and revealed some of the dangers of 
Mickledore, the precipitous and almost impassable ravine, separating 
this mountain from the Pike.
The Scawfell pink, so much talked 
about in the district, is nothing but Armeria maritima, var.
montana.
After descending Scawfell we climbed the Screes, a range of magnifi- 
cent, shaley cliffs, which skirt the south-eastern side of Wast Water, 
and rise 1,900 feet above the lake.
In Hawl Gill, a granitic valley 
near the western extremity of the Screes, Hymenophyllum Wilsoni 
clothed the rocks.
After refreshing ourselves in the beautiful village 
of " The Strands," we had a delightful row up the lake by twilight, and 
reached our sojourning place ready for bed.
A climb up the back of 
Lingmell, to survey the deep chasm of Pierce Gill, and a long walk 
over the mountains, past Honister Crag, brought us, on the following 
morning, to the little inn at Buttermere, without having seen any 
plants of note but Hieracium alpinum, which grew on the rocks above 
Pierce Gill : after a rest we passed Crummoch Lake and part of 
Lowes Water, reaching Low Mosser in the evening, where we spent 
the next day under the hospitable roof of our felloM^- traveller.
Re- 
suming our journey, we passed through Cockermouth, Keswick and 
Penrith, to Appleby, and the next morning took a car to the village of 
Knock, and commenced a careful examination of Knock-ore-gill, a 
valley in the Crossfell ridge, belonging to the Teesdale district : in 
the head of the gill we found a fresh locality for Saxifraga Hirculus, 
and Juncus triglumis was in almost every bog.
An Epilobium of un- 
common appearance, and not agreeing with the description of any 
English species, grew in the same bog with the Saxifi'aga, also a My- 
osotis differing from the common form of repens, to which it ap- 
proached the nearest.
An extremely fatiguing walk, over part of an 
almost endless moss, conveyed us to the head of High Cup Scar, 
where we saw Saxifraga nivalis in its old locality ; on the ridge be- 
tween this ravine and Murton Pike, which we climbed, there was 
abundance of Rubus chamamorus in fruit; we returned to Appleby 
that evening, and the next day passed through the long and deep 
valley of Scordale, and after four or five miles' journey through a cloud, 
1047 
down the side of Maize-beck, reached Cauldron Snout Bridge: in its 
old locality we saw abundance of Alsine stricta, and on Falcon Glints 
a fine plant of Woodsia Ilvensis ; we lodged at the High Force Inn 
that night, and then returned home.

Note on Centaurea nigra, var.
radiata, and C.
nigrescens.
By Fenton J.
A. Hort, Esq.
In reference to the controversy now continuing respecting the 
Centaurea nigra, /3.
radiata, and the C.
nigrescens of Babington, I 
may mention that in ascending one of the Cotswolds in September, 
from Cheltenham, by one of the beautiful grassy, bushy lanes so nu- 
merous in that locality, I was attracted by the unusual appearance of 
a plant: it proved a Centaurea, with larger, paler, and at the same 
timebrighter flowers, and leaves and whole habit paler and more delicate 
than the common C.
nigra with rays, which grows most abundantly 
in the neighbourhood, in fact quite as abundantly as the normal form 
without rays.
I observed that, as in the C.
nigrescens of Babington, 
" about the three innermost rows" of the involucral appendages were 
" separated from the rest and exposing the scales ;" and I noticed 
the same character in some mutilated and wretched specimens which 
I found a few days after, again struck with the peculiar colour.
The 
other characters appeared to agree with both descriptions equally 
well ; but the difference in the general appearance and habit could 
1049 
not be overlooked, the perfect specimens being exceedingly elegant, 
and having none of that dark, rigid, gaunt growth which is apparent 
in every well-grown plant of the common C.
nigra with rays that I 
have seen.
I should add that this dissimilarity is by no means so 
striking in the dried specimens.
I may also add that I have discovered Polypodium calcareum 
growing sparingly in a stony thicket on Windlass Hill, in the same 
neighbourhood : its occurrence on Cleave Hill, three or four miles 
distant, has been previously recorded by Mr. James Buckman, in his 
Flora of the neighbourhood, and by Mr. Edwin Lees : the specimens 
I found were large and densely " glandular-mealy." P.
Dryopteris 
is not found in that locality.

Notice of Leighton's Shropshire Ruhi.
We are enabled to insert below a hst of the Forms of Brambles 
comprised in the Fasciculus of Dried Specimens of Shropshire Rubi, 
just issued by the Rev. W.
A. Leighton, author of ' Flora of Shrop- 
shire.' Tlie basis of the work has been the specimens authenticated 
by Esenbeck, Bon-er and Lindley, from which the descriptions in the 
* Flora of Shropshire ' were framed.
To these many others have been 
added, which subsequent research has brought to light â€” and the whole 
are now named according to the nomenclature adopted by Mr. Babington 
and Dr. BeU-Salter in Babington's Synopsis.
The work may be re- 
garded as a revision of the genus Rubus in the ' Shropshire Flora ' â€” 
and shows the present views of the author.
The specimens selected 
are generally speaking typical forms â€” and are carefully and well dried.
To botanists generally, the work cannot but prove interesting, and to 
the student of this difficult and perplexing genus, particularly useful 
and valuable.
The impression {technically speaking) is necessarily 
limited â€” and we understand that above one half of the copies are 
already sold an(l distributed.

Occurrence of Uclora Canadensis, a Plant new to Britain and Eu- 
rope, near Market Harhorough, in Leicestershire.
By Edward 
Newman.
I AM indebted to Miss M.
Kirby, of Leicester, who is also the ori- 
ginal discoverer, for the information that a plant, not only new to 
Britain, but also to Europe, has been found growing abundantly and 
luxuriantly in certain reservoirs of the canal near Market Harborough, 
in Leicestershire.
In many instances of our new discoveries, single 
specimens, or a few scattered plants have been esteemed sufficient to 
warrant the introduction of a new name into our catalogues of British 
plants : it has, however, very frequently turned out that the species 
is clearly of exotic original, and its introduction merely accidental.
In the present instance, however, the case is widely different : the 
plant has every appearance of being a true native, and I believe has 
also been found, now that attention has been turned to Miss Kirby's 
discovery, in three other widely separated British localities.
I learn from our best botanists that this plant is the Udora cana- 
densis of Nuttall, ii.
242, the Elodgea canadensis of Michaux, and 
the Serpicula verticillata of Muhlenberg.
It closely resembles the 
plant figured under the last- mentioned name in Roxburgh's Coro- 
mandel plants, although some botanists suppose it can scarcely be 
the same, and it is mentioned in Mr. Dennes' Report on a preceding 
page as Anacharis alsinastrum of Babington, but I know not whether 
this name is published, or merely given provisionally, under the im- 
pression that the plant was previously undescribed.
Not the least interesting fact connected with the 'discovery is the 
remarkable history of the physiology and economy of the plant, which 
is identical with that of Valisneria.

Notice of ' Tlie London Catalogue of British Plants?
Second 
Edition.
Pamplin, London, 1848.
Notwithstanding its date, it seems desirable to acquaint Botanists 
with the fact that the second edition of this Catalogue is already pub- 
lished.
The usefulness of this work for its immediate object has been 
abundantly proved.
Had the Botanical Society of London continued 
to employ the Edinburgh Catalogue, which, notwithstanding the evi- 
dent pains taken to obtain a correct nomenclature, is most confusedly 
printed and most clumsily planned, it must have come to a stand still 
instead of so greatly outstripping the Edinburgh Society as it has done 
notwithstanding the various superior advantages which the latter cer- 
tainly enjoyed.
We can scarcely suppose our readers unacquainted 
with the first edition of the London Catalogue, and have therefore 
only to notice what may be termed the differences between the two : 
these may be ranged under the four following heads : â€” 
First.
All newly-discovered species up to the autumn of 1847 
have been added in their respective places.
Secondly.
The list of excluded species has been gi-eatly increased, 
being now nearly one hundred and fifty with dubious claims : all these 
have either been found occasionally or recorded as British species.
Thirdly.
The list of names under Rubus, meaning nothing certain, 
has been entirely left out for reasons explained in a quotation given 
below.
Fourthly.
The Catalogue is no longer anonymous, being avowedly 
the work of a commission appointed by the Botanical Society of Lon- 
don, and consisting of George Edgar Dennes, Esq., honorary Secre- 
tary, and Hewett Cottrell Watson, Esq., and we fancy we may ascribe 
to the gentleman whose name so modestly stands second in the com- 
mission the chief share in the undertaking.
In getting up Catalogues of this kind two things are to be considered: 
first, accuracy ; secondly, intelligibility : we conceive both of these 
are acheived in an eminent degree in the publication before us, yet in 
some cases we detect a little departm-e from rigid accuracy, not un- 
advisedly, but fi'om some motive of expediency, which the authors, 
had they space, would doubtless explain ; for instance, take the last 
species in the rejected list, Equisetum fluviatile, a common English 
plant to which Linneus and all continental authors apply this name.
A foreigner must suppose that the well-known Equisetum fluviatile, so 
common on the Continent, has been recorded as an inhabitant of 
Britain, but that Messrs.
Dennes and Watson having found that record 
1052 
â€¢â–  
incorrect, expunge tlie name : thej' would have no idea that it is only 
the Linnean name that is struck out, the plant being one of our com- 
monest species.
The name immediately preceding, viz., Asplenium 
fontanum is rejected because the authors do not believe it British.
The passage about Rubi is as follows : â€” 
" As no two of our authors seem to agree in their views respecting 
the-species and nomenclature of the British Rubi, originally included 
under the name of R.
fruticosus, it has appeared useless to extend 
the Catalogue by again printing a long list of mere names, which can 
have no certainty or constancy of application on the labels written 
by individual botanists, one compared with another.
The Society 
will distribute such duplicates of the frulicose Rubi, Nos. 340, &c., 
as maj' be sent ready labelled for the purpose ; and through this 
course different botanists may eventually come to understand the no- 
menclature of each other."

A few more Words about the Centaurece.
By Edward Newman.
I AVAIL myself of the editorial privilege of alluding to a communi- 
cation in the present number, because it will be as well to close the 
discussion with the year, unless new information should be elicited 
by future and more exact observations.
Mr. Lees, in his paper on 
Centaurea Jacea, recommends botanists " to attend to involucral 
scales rather than the radiant flowers," in their endeavours to distin- 
guish between the true Jacea of Linnaeus and the allied species or 
varieties.
Mr. Lees repeats this twice, as something rather impor- 
tant.
Of course I applied the counsel to myself, having been the 
originator of the discussion, and I beg to assure Mr. Lees that he has 
misunderstood me if he thought I wished to introduce this character 
as one whereby Jacea, nigrescens and radiata could be separated.
As far as I am aware, they are all equally "radiant," and I cannot 
find that any botanist has introduced the existence or degree of ra- 
diancy into the question.
In fine, I believe the three appellations, 
as regards Britain, are mere synonyms,
